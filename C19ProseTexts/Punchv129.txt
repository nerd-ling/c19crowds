A HOLESOME IDEA.
Dulre Dumum, Acacia Road,
Upper Tootimjton.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Now that all our
men and women of light and learning
have finished their brilliant suggestions
for the erection of a memorial to WILLIAM
SHAKSPEARE, may I come very humbly
forward with a proposal of my own?
The great idea has been to collect sub-
scriptions, and with them raise something
in the nature of a monument to our
Bard oC Avon. Sir, I advocate the
exact opposite. With great deference
I suggest that the memorial should
take the form of a very, very deep
hole. In this hole to be buried all
SUAKSPEARE-BACON controversial litera-
ture, and all those persons who try (for
some occult reason known only to them-
selves) to prove that BACON wrote SHAK-
SPEARE. The hole then to be covered
with a very heavy granite slab, firmly
cemented down round the edges. I do
believe the Poet's shade would appre-
ciate this far more than any towering
pinnacle. "A CONSTANT HEADER."
CRICKET NEWS A I.A FKAXCAISE.—" A

"INDEPENDENCE DAY."
(.4 memory of July the Fourth.)
EUPHEMIA! Had the Fates designed]
To weave our mortal webs in one;
Had Love, notoriously blind,
Not let liis bandage come undone;
I tremble even now to think
How my career, with yours united,
Might have sustained a horrid kink
And been irrevocably blighted.
We met. My callow heart embraced
What I regarded as a sign
Of dawning literary taste
Fit to respond, almost, to mine;
You had the right artistic bump,
The tact (I said), the intuition
That apprehends a poet's hump
During the pangs of composition.
You may have had. I don't suggest
That youthful judgment read you wrong;
You would, no doubt, have done your best
To help me through my throes of song;
Rather my scorn is levelled at
The hollow hopes a lover nurses
Who dreams that such a type as that
Would tend to lubricate his verses.
I 'in wiser now. I 've come to know
The kind that holds your writing hand
And smooths your brow and murmurs low:
"Poor darling! How I understand!"
They don't, of course! They cannot see
(Their minds are built with this hiatus)
How one revolts from sympathy
When wrestling with a rhyme-afflatus.
Well, well, EITHEMIA, I am weaned
From what was once a poignant pain;
And bless his eyes who intervened—
The broker-man from Mincing I^ane;
He won your hand, good honest soul,
And if it still persists in stroking
His flabby paw, or polished poll,
1 doubt if that disturbs his broking.
"Why have these thoughts just now occurred?"
It is July the Fourth, my dear,
The day on which he spoke the word
Into your pink and willing ear;]
And there is not, I dare to say,
A free-born Yank across the tide who
Keeps up his "Independence Day"
With purer, holier joy than I do. 0. S.
WE are glad to read in the Pout Office- Circular that the
Royal Humane Society "have awarded an Honorary Testi-
monial, on vellum, to GEOROE HAIMJKEAVES, Auxiliary Tosvn
Postman at Lancaster, in recognition of gallant conduct on
his part in saving a child from drowning in a mile-race at
Sherton." We are not certain whether it w;is the postman
or the child, or both, that was, or were, engaged in the said
mile-race at the time, but if the child took part in this aquatic
contest, with or without the postman, we think that a mile
was too long for it, and that the attention of the S.P.C.C.
'<ould be drawn to the episode.
MR. SWINBURNE'S NOVEL.
LlTERAliY gossip-mongers will not have failed to note the
piquant announcement in a recent number of the Athenaeum
that Mr. SWINBURNE is shortly about to publish a prose romance
entitled Loves Cross Currents, satirising certain characteristics
of modern society. By the exercise of that clairvoyant antici-
pation for which he has long been famous, Mr. Punch is able
to present his readers with an extract from an early chapter
of this momentous work, supplemented by a brief scenario of
its enthralling sequel:
"Basil Windmali, the most inexpressibly non-respectable
Guardsman who had ever established the unequivocal supe-
riority of intrepid self-assertion over moral excellence, was
now at the supreme turning-point of his exorbitantly intricate
and incomparably fervent career. Of fearless courage and
herculean strength, he had also all tender and exquisite
qualities of breeding, and all courteous and gracious instincts
of kindness. His Apollonian lineaments recalled the superb
beauty of his grandfather, Ijord Mimntm. His slender feet
and hands were a living proof of his descent on his mother's
side from Lady Sarah Medium, the Cinderella of the Restora-
tion. He rode like a Centaur, he swam like an inspired
conger eel, his dancing would have driven TACJLIOXI delirious
with insupportable envy; and his moustache, undulating in
an ambrosial curve and diffusing an atmosphere of sustained
and aromatic ecstasy, was pronounced by no less distinguished
an authority than the German EMPEKOU to be amongst the
noblest achievements of capillary landscape gardening.
"Basil was beautiful and beloved: impervious to the
malodorous calumnies exhaled by the powine public, serenely
indifferent to the rancid homage of professional sycophants.
Hut still his lot was not one of unmitigated felicity. The
elementary rules of Bridge had always presented to him
insuperable difficulties, and now, after a year's uninterrupted
and disastrous losses, it was borne in upon him that he was
no longer worthy of association with messmates of such
infinitely superior skill. With lightning promptitude he
took his decision and acted tipon it; sent in his papers, com-
posed his will in tetrameter galliambics, and despatched an
intimation to the Moinimj 1'oxt that the morganatic marriage
arranged between Captain Basil Windrusli of the Grenadier
Guards and I^ady Vivien Leycester would shortly take place."
So much for Mr. SWINBURNE'S own hand. We may carry
on this fasciiiating romance, one of the gems of the Putney
School of Fiction, which began with Aylwin, by the follow-
ing crude summary:—
Exasperated to an incredible pitch of fury by the odious
insinuation that she would consent to undergo the ignominy
any matrimonial tie, however lax, Lady Virien seeks
refuge in a Vegetarian Sanatorium kept by the notorious
bigamist Dr. Laiithom Blacl:. Revived and exhilarated by
the treatment which she there receives, Lady Vivien elopes
with Dr. Blacl; to his marine pavilion on the shores of the
Great Salt I/ike, where on the thirteenth anniversary of
their elopement they are married in the Mormon Temple.
It is doubtful if, even in these days of lurid narrative,
inything more convincing and curdling than Mr. SWINBURNE'S
romance has seen the light. It will, we need hardly add, be
dedicated to Mr. WATTS-DI NTON.
THE Westminster Gazette, after giving an account of a
•ollision between a leopard and a small engine on the
Victoria Falls Bridge, adds the following statement: "Sir
.'HAIJI.ES METCAI.FE, Bart., consulting engineer to the Rhodesia
Railways, Limited, contemplates the fixing of two medallions,
me on each side of the bridge, representing Dr. LIVINGSTONE
md Mr. CECIL RHODES." Comment would be invidious.

PRIDE IN THEIR PORT, DEFIANCE IN THEIR EYE.'
Puny lot Patriotic Briton. "I SAY, 'ENRY, 'EHE COJIE SOME OF THESE FOREIGNERS THAT'S OVER 'ERE FOB "ENLET. JCST LET'S PUT
OUR BACKS 13» IT, AND SHOW 'EM WOT THE BRITISHER CAN DO!"
THE MAGIC H'S.
(A Society Story of U]>to-<late Diablerie, in Three Paris.)
PART III.
"You implied just now," said the voluble stranger, as the
train glided out of Bond Street Station, "that, even should
any further disaster overtake HIPPKRHOLME, the talisman given
to him by his Guardian Fairy could safely be depended
upon to extricate him. That was a very natural assumption
on your part, and in the main a perfectly correct one. Under
ordinary circumstances, it is a matter of common knowledge
that a fairy is fully a match for the average fiend. But such
calculations are always liable to be upset by some trivial
accident which it is totally impossible to foresee. As HAfiOLD
was soon to discover:
"He was at a brilliant evening party given by a certain
peeress who shall be nameless, at her magnificent mansion
in Park liine. The Society craze last season, as I daresay
you recollect, took the form of Parlour Games—an intellectual
pastime for which HAROLD had a natural aptitude, and in
which he easily held his own against the very smartest of
the Smart Set. That night he outshone even himself, and
Lady L'ILIA (who with her father, the Earl, was of course
among those invited) was the pleased recipient of many con-
gratulations on the gentlemanly deportment and ready wit
displayed by the object of her choice. At last, after repeated
triumphs, he was required to submit himself to a test
compared with which all previous ones were child's play.
He had to leave the room while the rest of the company
settled among themselves what celebrated historical character
on what particular occasion he was to represent, and it was
for him to guess, if he could, from the cryptic remarks
addressed to him by each of the players in turn, whom they
supposed him to be. Very possibly you have played this
game yourself?" . . .
[I had—and had not found it particularly exhilarating,
though I did not consider it necessary to say so.]
"Well, HiiTKimoLME came in, and brought all the powers
of his mind to bear on the problem—but for once he found
himself completely baffled. Nothing they said afforded him
the faintest clue.
"'I must admit, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,' he owned
at length with a genial frankness, ' that I 'm rather \\p the
stick this time. I 'm really afraid I must ask you to assist
me a little by giving me just the slightest 'int!' . . .
"He knew what he had done, but he was not seriously
perturbed—the talisman would get him out of it as usual,
and instinctively his fingers sought his watch-chain. Judge
of his horror when he found that the crystal locket was no
longer there! He searched his waistcoat pockets in vain—
it was not in either of them ; [he had lost it somehow!
"'Just the slightest 'int,' the wretched man repeated
mechanically, amidst a silence so intense that, had any
patrician present possessed such a thing as a pin and allowed
it to drop, it would assuredly have fallen with a sickening
thud. Fortunately, this was not the case.
"HIJTKHHOLME ga/ed round the semi-circle in wild despair,
as he wiped the perspiration from his clammy brow—and
then he caught sight of a glittering object lying just under-
neath a gilded sofa. He dived for it frantically; with inex-
pressible relief he recognised his lost ladybird, and, as he
resumed the perpendicular with the talisman in his clutch,
the conclusion—' erval for reflection '—fell from his lips, and
the intolerable strain was instantly relaxed.
"Immediately afterwards it flashed upon him that he could

be no other personage but King HAKOLD on the occasion of
being hit, in the eye by an arrow at the Battle of Hastings—
which proved to be perfectly correct.
"But, even amidst the general applause that greeted this
display of penetration, Hirr-KRHOi.ME shivered at the recollec-
tion of the narrow squeak he had just experienced.
"He had the fastening of the talisman repaired—while he
waited —at the earliest opportunity, after which he felt
himself once more invulnerable. To be sure there were two
more 'wrong 'uns' to be expected—but, even if they did clip
out before his marriage with Lady ICILIA, it would not signify
so long as he had the charm at hand—and he would take
uncommonly good care not to lose sight of it in future.
"When she was once his bride he would be safer still. It
would take more than a couple of defective aspirates to sever
them then!
"As it happened, during the weeks that remained he was
never once under the necessity of employing the talisman, a
circumstance which so increased his sense of security that,
while arraying himself on his wedding-morn for the cere-
mony, it occurred to him that he might safely leave the
locket on his dressing-table.
"He had always thought it a rather cheap and tawdry
ornament for a man of his means to wear; it would be an
unsightly blot on the magnificence of his attire on this
momentous occasion; it would not be required, since he
could hold no conversation with either Lady ICILIA or her
parent until after the conclusion of the nuptials.
"Still, he would have to say a few words in the vestry
afterwards—and then there was the drive with his bride
from the church, and the wedding breakfast. Perhaps it
would be wisest to avoid all risks. So, for the present at all
events, he decided to allow the locket to remain on his watch-
chain.
"The wedding was at St. George's, Hanover Square, which
was crowded to suffocation by persons of rank, commone-is
finding it hopeless to obtain admittance, and the vergers
being compelled to turn even Countesses away!
"HAROLD, with Lord NORMAN BEM:COE as his best man, stood
by the altar, awaiting the arrival of the bridal cortege, and,
as he heard the Society small talk behind him drowning even
the pealing notes of the organ, his -bosom swelled with a
satisfaction that made him entirely oblivious of the fact that
he owed the proud position in which he stood to the instru-
mentality of a fiend.
"And then preceded by the choir, and followed by eight
bridesmaids, sill ladies of title and wearing costly diamond
bnxx'hes in the form of two interlaced h's, the gift of the
bridegroom- Lady ICILIA CHILWELL came slowly up the centre
aisle, leaning on (lie arm of her father, the Earl of STONISTAIRS,
and the ceremony commenced:
"It was conducted by the Bishop of MuMDLEDOROur.n,
assisted by several of the minor clergy, and, as the venerable
prelate, in accents almost inaudible with emotion, dictated
the responses, the happy bridegroom repeated them in tones
as full as was his heart. 'To have and to hold,' quavered
the good old Bishop and through the sacred edifice HAROLD'S
resonant voice rang out like a clarion call: 'To 'ave and to
'old!'
"I can only qualify the result as electrical. Never before,
perhaps, had that aristocratic fane heard the aspirate treated
with such appalling irreverence; the walls seemed to rock,
strong men grew pale, the very choristers were visibly con-
cerned, the Bishop was struck dumb, while Lady ICILIA,
withdrawing her hand from HAROLD, shrank from him with
a movement of uncontrollable repulsion.
"HiPPF.juioi.MK alone preserved his composure. He felt
that he could hardly have dropped two li's at a more
unpropitious moment — but fortunately the matter cotdd
easily be set right. How lucky that he had not followed
his first impulse and left his ladybird at home! He fingered
the talisman with confidence.
"To his indescribable dismay it failed him for the first
time! He could not believe it at first, could not understand
how such a thing could have luippened. And then the
terrible truth dawned upon him. It was useless to expect
the talisman to aid him there. Not even a Fairy could
venture to introduce any additions to the Marriage Service.
What he had said he had said!
"Lady ICILIA had already collapsed- a mere heap of white
satin, Brussels lace and orange blossom—into the arms of
her principal bridesmaid, the Earl had stepped forward and
held a whispered colloquy with the Bishop, who seemed to,
agree with him that the ceremony could not proceed, as
HAROLD rushed madly from the building, bareheaded, for he
had resigned his hat to Lord NORMAN BEAUOOE. And, at the
moment he gained the portico, and was descending the steps
into George Street, he heard a malicious snigger, which
seemed to come from the telephone wires overhead, and a
voice he remembered but too well cried out with shrill
derision: 'What did I tell you? Six of 'em wrong 'uns!'
"The Fairy knew more about fiends than he did, after all.
They were not to be trusted!"
"But surely," I said, as we ran into the next station, "that
isn't the end of the story? The Fairy couldn't possibly leave
him in such a fix as that. Or why have a Guardian Fairy at
all?"
"You are right," he said, impressively, patting me with
approval on the chest; "absolutely right! That is not
the end. The finale is singular, but satisfactory, as you
are about to hear. . . . But, bless me, this is Tottenham
Court Road! I 'm afraid I must bid you farewell, with many
thanks for your courteous attention. I get out here."
And he did—so I missed the finale. It was not till I
reached the British Musetun that I missed my pocket-book.
It contained a cheque for royalties on the American sales of a
certain work of mine for the six months ending December 31,
1904, and was for the amount of three-and-fourpence.
Providentially I had not endorsed it. F. A.
LITTLE BOY BLUE.
OH, little Boy Blue, won't you blow up your horn?
Though we can't see a sheep, or a cow in the corn;
But we 're waiting and longing, so blow it up, do,
For these two little sisters, oh little Boy Blue!
You ought to oblige us: we 've painted you in
In a full suit of blue, though the colour was thin.
We have painted you often and know you are true,
As true as the Fairies, oh little Boy Blue.
You 're as true as the Fairies, and bigger than they;
And we 're both of us waiting to hear how you play.
If you come in your suit we shall know that it's you,
With your hat and your feather, oh little Boy Blue.
And your lace and your bows, and your shoes with their tips,
And your hands on the horn and the horn at your lips.
You needn't be bashful, although we are two,
For we '11 both be polite to our little Boy Blue.
We have looked for you, Boy dear, and sent you our love,
As you sailed, so they said, on a white cloud above;
But, although we had rather you walked here than flew,
You can come as you like, if you '11 only wear blue.
You can slide on a sunbeam, or ride on a stick,
Or drop like a lark, but we beg you '11 come quick.
If you don't come to us we shall search the world through
Till we find you and keep you, oh little Boy Blue.

"PILGRIMS OF THE NIGHT."
THE magnificent reception and most cordial welcome given
to Mr. WHITELAW REID, the recently arrived American Am-
3assador, on Friday the 23rd June, by "the Pilgrims" and
their guests at the banquet (a snug little dinner-party of
:hree hundred convives, held at Claridge's) took place too late
in that week to be fittingly reported, as the exceptional
nature of the occasion demanded, by Mr. Punch's special Inter-
national Representative, who gladly avails himself of the very
Brat opportunity offered of giving, in Mr. P.'s immortal pages,
some account of this most thoroughly successful gathering.
Claridge's was the humble hostelrie chosen by the gentle
Pilgrims for their dining-place, and the arrangements
for the simple meal were admirably made and carried
out. To feed in perfect comfort some three hundred weary
Pilgrims (Pilgrims are always weary) and Pilgrims' hungry
guests at various dinner-tables, so that every dinner-table
should have its own pleasant little party, and all and sundry
should eat, drink, and be merry, without slightest cause for
grumbling, is a triumph for Mr. HARRY BBITTAIN, who,
true to his name, is nothing if not "a thorough one" in
every way; who, though "with heart and voice" he, and
others, may declare a fixed determination "never, never, never
to be slaves," yet on this occasion is delighted to become
a servus servorum, and willingly allows himself to be worried
out of his dinner in order to attend to his multifarious duties.
The introductory melon is being discussed and approved of;
our Secretary does not appear. His chair is vacant. Waiter
clears away remnants of melons, and disappears with
Secretary's portion of the cool, luscious fruit.
The soup is served. When we are half through this, our
Secretary, beamingly cheerful, with a lot of telegrams and
papers in his hand, and pencils sticking about him, like
'quills upon the "fretful porcupine,' suddenly appears and
takes his seat as he gives a sigh of relief.
His Guest (sympathetically). Afraid you weren't coming.
Secretary (cheerfully). Loto' things to see to -(places a heap
of papers and telegrams on table)—but shall be able to get a
mouthful now. (Commences mouthful, appears much restored.
At about third mouthful, a foreign-looking hotel-manager
u'ltinpers to him. Secretary pauses, refers to papers.) Eh?
Oh, certainly. Yes. (Foreign manager at his right hand
disappears. Secretary is about to proceed with third mouthful
of soup when sandy-headed man, appearing suddenly on the
scene, touches his left elbow. Secretary turns, listens.) Eh? -
well -I rather think —(Sandy-headed party whispers with
intense eagerness. Secretary considers for a second— then)—
Ah! well—perhaps I 'd better—I will.
[Decides, evidently, on instant action. Jumps up, nearly
overturns sandy-haired man, who disappears among
some waiters, rushes off, and is lost to sight for another
fifteen minutes or so, during which present course is
cleared away; and when the third course is half
finished, Secretary hurriedly returns.
Guest (more sympathetically than ever). Can't you get
someone to do this for you?
Secretary (almost fiercely). Impossible. (Genially) If you
want a thing well done —eh ?—you know—ah- -lamb ?—good!
now I can get a snack in comfort! (Drinks a glass of cham-
/xtgne which lias been fortunately poured out for him. As he
is settling down to the lamb, another hotel-manager, foreign
and dapjx-r, approaches him, speaking mysteriously behind a
menu-card, as if he uxre a ventriloquist giving the Secretary a
private entertainment. Secretary starts and turns round; then
anxiously) Eh ? you don't mean that—(Ventriloquial foreign
hotel-manager, stdl behind menu-card, explains what lie does
mean. Secretary starts up, exclaiming) Certainly; I '11 see
to it at once.
\Qathert up his papers, rushes off, and is engaged until ^
quails hare come and gone, leaving behind them but the
name on tlie daint-y silken pink riband whereon the
menu is printed.
The foregoing will convey some idea of the pleasures of
being a Secretary responsible for everything at a banquet of
three hundred Pilgrims and Strangers.
The dinner was well chosen, but not quite up to the
previous one at either the Savoy or the Hyde Park Hotel, I
forget which it was. Intended for a specialite, the "Olio"
by any other name would have been a soup. The "Delice
de Jambon Ambassadrice" was of course intended as a
delicate compliment to the Hambassador, which, on the part
of the Hambassadrice, no doubt the Hon. WHITELAW REID
thoroughly appreciated. The asparagus was served up with
Sauce Divine, but there is only one sauce for hot asparagus
(if in themselves they are perfect), and that is two table-
spponfuls of cold water with an eggspoonful of salt in it.
This brings out the flavour to perfection. Of course if your
asparagus be indifferent, and you depend on sauce for its
flavour, then I recommend Sauce Divine, or Sauce an diable,
or Sauce a la burette, melee.
Toast-master commands silence for our Chairman. Heart}"
cheering, and Lord ROBERTS drinks to KING and PRESIDENT.
National melodies. After the first toast Secretary BBITTAIN
reads out, clearly and distinctly, kindly telegrams from Pilgrims
at a distance, including one from Mr. CHOATE which, needless
to say, is received witli acclamation. Then Mr. ARTHTR
BALFOUR, in dulcet tones and well-balanced periods, proposes
the toast of the evening, to which, after the enthusiastic
cheering has subsided, Mr. WHITELAW REID replies in an
excellent, straightforward speech which makes the whole
assembly kin.
Lest our enthusiasm should wax too hilarious and our
joviality become excessive, the toast-master's hammer recalls
us to attention, with a sharp rap (as it were) on our heads, and
informs us that now Sir HENRY IRVING (loud cheers) will read
a few verses, specially composed for the occasion by the Poet
Laureate.
The Dantesque figure of our leading tragedian gradually
elongates itself upwards, and but for a slight stoop indicative
of the gentle bent of his amiable disposition lie stands erect.
Our first, tragedian, or, as ho may be correctly described on this
occasion, our rising actor, had but to make a brief speech of
his own composition which he intended should serve as an
introductory prologue to the verses of his " dear and valued
friend the Laureate." No wonder that he stooped, seeing
what an almost unspeakable burden had been laid upon his
shoulders. But manfully he did it. Printed poem in hand,
the author as prompter at his elbow, how could lie fail to
arouse our enthusiasm? Those who had read the verses
wondered how he would deliver the line—
"The April-sent swallow circling round our eaves."
But he did it magnificently! Mounted on the poet's
Pegasus he cleared the obstacle by a clear foot. Some
irreverent convives wished to know what the Adams were
doing while the swallows were thus annoying their Eves.
But to such silly talk deaf ears were turned. In gratitude
"our dear and valued " ALFREDO will no doubt present Sir
HENRY with a little trifle of his own in Five Acts, containing a
fine part for our leading tragedian.
This being over, nothing remained but for Sir GEORGE
WHITE, with all his blushing honours thick upon him, repre-
sented by rows of medals, to propose long life and success to
our hosts the Pilgrims, to which the names of the Hon.
STEWART L. WOODFORD and Sir A. CONAN DOYLE were down for
replies. For these gems of oratory I was, alas, unable to
remain. And so about 11.30 the proceedings came to an
end, and WHITELAW REID'S entire company retired to their
various domiciles. A Big Success!

ACCORDING to the recent statement
of a.high medical authority, the human
neck—especially the male variety—is
gradually lengthening. This is a
curious biological fact which requires
investigating, anil as a result, of careful
and conscientious observation we have
been able to trace a few of the causes
underlying the same. We find in the
first place that giraffe-like development
is dne to the masculine habit, so largely
on the increase in recent years, of stand-
ing five or more deep in the endeavour
to watch cricket and football champion-
ships and passing spectacles in the
streets. Careful measurements have
indicated an average elongation of
4s millimetres among the standing public
at Lord's and elsewhere after each Test
Match. Every " googly " and leg-glance,
therefore, add, however infinitesimally,
to the general stature, and the Austra-
lians, in thus helping to elevate the
Anglo-Saxon race, are bowling and
batting better than they know.
The same phenomenon has been noted
with regard to the linliltues of the
theatre, and especially the frequenters
of the back rows. It is with pain that
we allude once more to the Matinee
Hat and Matinee Hair, but these also
have undoubtedly helped to bring about
the vertebral prolongation of the pittite.
You may at once tell the ardent play-
goer by his telescopic neck—the result
of the last ten years of "picture" head-
gear coupled with the true feminine
instinct that uplifts the otherwise
grovelling male. In this way even
Fashion, too, sings an Excelsior to the
city clerk that comes after and sits in
her wake.
Another contributing cause is the
annual invasion of England by Yankee
"rubber-necks." The stolid British
pldegm has disappeared, and we are
now chronically in a condition which
may be described as "agog"-—ever
craning after some fresh excitement,
and hustling after novelty of the ap-
proved American type. No bullneck
can survive that is perpetually twisting
itself in order to acquire a "sense of
traffic" in a motor-ridden land. Each
hoot of the horn startles it still further
from its collar-bone.
Mr. C'AKXKUIE besides has helped on
the Extension Movement by presenting
the nation with a Diplodocus whose head
is poised some thirty feet in front of its
body. This has caused much envy
among the devotees of a long drink.
Collars have been worn two inches
higher in consequence by the thirstier
visitors to the Natural History Museum,
while the wajside inns and laundries of
the neighbourhood are equally looking
up.
Such are, in fine, the causes of the
present up-grade tendency, which are
patent to every observer with a head
upon his shoulders. They were indeed
foreshadowed long ago by VIRGIL, when
with wonderful insight he penned the
prophetic and remarkable passage, " Nee
mora nee rcquiea" alluding to the restless
growth of evolution. We would fain add,
"to be continued in our necks," but
the prospect gets appalling, and we ring
off. ZioZAU.

In the blare of trumpets and trombones,

\, -v TV
PUNCH AND (THE SUB; JUDY(-CE) SHOW.
Sir William Butler comes down on the War Office. The ex-War Minister doubles up Sir William Butler.
House of Commons, Monday, June 26.
—Most interesting episode in debate on
Vote of Censure based on Butler Com-
mittee Report was the companionship on
Treasury Bench of the late Minister of
War and his successor in the Office. A
flush of natural pride mantled the brow
of PRINCE ARTHUR as he surveyed them.
One of his charms is innate modesty.
He is, perhaps, too proud to take pride
in himself. But in this episode of his
Ministerial career he really thinks lie lias
made his mark. One man of something
exceeding average capacity coidd have
discovered ST. JOHN BRODRICK and, at a
time of sore peril, put him in charge of
the Army. Another might, in moment
of inspiration, at a later time have placed
ARNOI.D-FORSTER in the same supreme
position. None but PRINCE ARTHUR could
have discovered both and in succession
throned them in Pall Mall. No wonder
that as his eye fell upon them seated at
convenient distance on the same Bench
his glance softened, his lips murmured
something that sounded like benediction.
As for the young veterans, their pleased
ivflections on combined effort during the
last five years at the War Office were
ruffled by contemplation of the Report
of the Butler Committee. As AHXOI.D-
FORSTER said, with a tear in his voice
that evoked a roar of laughter from
unsympathetic House,
"Sir WILLIAM BUTLER has not produced
the Report the Government wished for."
On the contrary he, or rather his
Committee, has been exceedingly rude.
They have proved Marplots of a design
calculated to produce the fullest measure
of com fort to the largest number— exclud-
ing of course the British tax-payer, whose
hard-earned five millions sterling.of which
restitution was two years ago definitely
promised by War Office to trustful

COACHING CROOKS IN LATIN ("IN I>ARI MATERIA").

Departmental Committee appointed to
take evidence on the matter. It turned
out to be'of character unprecedented since
Crimean War. This awkward; but publi-
cation delayed, thing might blow over.
Then Public Accounts Committee step
on scene and insist on immediate issue
of Report and evidence, with conse-
quence of fulfilling OOM PAUL'S historic
threat to stagger humanity. Opposition
insist on debating subject through sum-
mer night. So here we are.
Unto the Great Twin Brethren
We keep this solemn feast.
All seems lost, even honour. But, as at
the battle of the Lake Regillus,
Swift, swift, the Great Twin Brethren
Came spurring from the East,
CASTOR ST. JOHN BRODRICK from the India
Office; POLLUX ARNOLD-FOHSTER from the
War Office. Whilst POLLUX bemoaned
the perversity of BUTLER in not bringing
in the Report the Government wished
for, CASTOR, with fiercer energy, fuller
courage, ready to tear the flesh of cap-
tains, to peck the eyes of kings, dashed
at his accuser, savagely beating BUTLER
about the head.
In the end it turned out that the late
Minister for War and his successor, so
far from being culprits, were martyrs.
The real sinner was Sir WILLIAM BUTLER.
He was accordingly held up to reprehen-

sion of a scoffing House, to execration
of an angry country. The Twin Breth-
ren exceedingly reticent in their refer-
ences to each other. POLLUX varies the
habit by more than once precisely naming
the date he succeeded to the War Office.
CASTOR and POLLUX were one in denuncia-
tion of Sir WILLIAM BUTLER.
"Odd evil fate for PRIXCE ARTHUR,"
says the MEMBER FOR SARK, "that in a
single Session his blameless Government
should find its authority undermined by
two officials appointed by as many Depart-
ments. But, whereas in Home Rule diffi-
culty ANTONv MACDONNELL was alluded to
in debate in almost reverential terms,
WILLIAM BUTLER is publicly flogged.
Wonder if there can be anything in the
personality or position of the two men
that makes that attitude safe in one
instance, undesirable in another?"
Business done.—Vote of Censure on
Government moved in respect of Army
Stores Scandals in South Africa. Curious
thing happened. Through long debate
beginning in afternoon, closing at mid-
night, not a single Ministerialist rose to
say a word in extenuation of the Govern-
ment, but on division gave them a
rattling majority of 74, being the full
possible poll.
"O Gemini!" said PRINCE ARTHUR,
beaming on CASTOR and POLLUX, "and
they want me to dissolve. I think not.
I am not quite certain we shall come
back with a majority of 74. Anyhow,
it will do for me to go on with through
another year."
Tuesday n'ujlit.—A little difficult to
shut up Mr. CROOKS. In the family
circle is imderstood to have a pretty wit
of his own. Likes to air it on larger
platform at Westminster. To-day PRINCE
ARTHUR, temporarily at least, achieved
the apparently impossible.
LAMBERT inquired when Redistribution
Resolutions would be brought in. Not
Mr. CROOKS'S funeral; but opportunity
of letting his 'orny-'ancled brother, en-
gaged in less agreeable circumstances,
know that he is around not to be
slighted. So he ups and, by way of
supplementary question, asks whether
the Unemployed Bill will take prece-
dence over the Redistribution proposals?
"The questions," answered PRINCE
ARTHUR dreamily, "are not in part
materia."
"What 'a he givin' us?" growled Mr.
CROOKS to DON'T KEIR-HAKDIE.
"I fancy," said the hon. Negative,
"he means that it's not in Paris. These
swells, you know, call the place Paree."
"Who 's a-talkin' about Paris?" said
Mr. CROOKS, increasingly angry. "And
what does he mean by materia?"
"That's clear enough," said DON'T
KEIR decisively. "It's French again.
He means 'material,' only they don't
pronounce the last letter."
Mr. CROOKS glanced suspiciously in
the region of DON'T KEIR-HARDIE'S many-
hued neck-gear.
"Don't you go a-pullin' my leg," he
remarked threateningly.
"Who 's a-pullin' your leg?" inquired
DON'T KEIR, not for the moment having
anything more pointed to say.
This conversation, audibly conducted
below Gangway, attracted pained atten-
tion. It is significant of the growing
restlessness under the Leadership of
PRINCE ARTHUR that disposition was dis-
played to resent his part, leading up to
the incident. He has, Members say,
been guilty of infringing various House
of Commons traditions. He has ostenta-
tiously withdrawn from his place in
debate, taking his Party with him. On
other occasions he has altogether ignored
sittings of the House. Where it was
possible he has, in interest of Govern-
ment business, gagged the Opposition.
He lias systematically declined to en-
lighten Parliament with regard to his
personal position on Fiscal Question.
He has abused the ten minutes' rule; he
has sneered at C.-B.; has spoken disre-
spectfully of CAP'N TOMMY BOWI-EH. If
he is going to answer questions in the
Latin tongue it is time effective protest
were made.
"Quod erat demonstrandum," says
Doctor MACNAMARA, who wasn't at St.
Thomas's School, Exeter, for nothing.
Business done.—Aliens Bill in Com-
mittee.
Friday niyht. — Trouble for PRIME
MINISTER has broken out in new, unex-
pected quarter. Nothing to do with the
War Office; no connection with DON
JOSE; does not touch the fringe of
Empire in India, where GEORGE CURZOX
is growing restive under the iron rule
of ST. JOHN BRODRICK. It is over the
Irish Office the black cloud bursts.
Years ago a witty Irishman, RONAYNE,
at the time Member for Cork, scornfully
described the Chief Secretary of the day
as "circumnavigating Ireland on an
outside car." WALTER LONC., going

tion, has availed himself of the motor
car. No objection to that, but, accord-
ing to testimony brought forward by
Irish Members, lie has not intermitted
liis educational (motor car) course on
Sundays. A Protestant Bishop has de-
nounced him from the altar steps, foras-
much as his flashing along the high-
ways on motor cars has interfered with
the comfort, even threatened the safety,
of peaceful congregations wending their
way to their parish church.
WALTER LONO says it only happened
once, and there is no evidence to show
that his destination was not a place of
worship in a distant parish. He also
hints that his esteemed Chief has him-
self been fined for riding at a speed in
excess of statutory limitation.
"Abusus non tollit nsiim," said PRINCE
ARTHUR, abstractedly dropping into the
new habit that proved so irritating to
Mr. CROOKS.
"Erin go bratjh!" sharply retorted
WALTER LONG, not to be out of the
fashion.

LAYS OF A LONDONER.
ST. JAMES'S PARK.
I I/IVE the ornamental lake
That laps St. James's leafy glades,
Where amorous milkmen daily make
Frank overtures to kitchen maids,
And press their individual suits
Entwined in amorous salutes.
There sporting urchins pit themselves
Against the hairy tiddler's might,
Till ROBERT'S swart resounding "twelves,"
Approaching, scatter them to flight;
There pregnant poets stand and scowl
Upon the artificial fowl.
1 love those green secluded bowers
Adjoining Storey's ample gate,
Paced, it is said, at latish hours
By anxious Ministers of State,
While house-cats from the neighbouring
squares
Improve the night with native airs.
For it was there the thing occurred,
That deepest, earliest romance—
There first this lonely breast was stirred
By LUCY'S coy, responsive glance.
Alas! what lustres lie between
Myself and that romantic scene!
She stood, a roguish dimpled maid,
The sunlight playing in her hair;
One slightly swollen cheek betrayed
The brandy ball that lingered there;
One hand retained a pink balloon,
The other held a macaroon.
A hasty word, a melting look,
Our mutual passion thus began;
Her nurse \vas buried in a book,
And mine was toying with a man.
Lightly we stole beyond their view,
And broke the macaroon in two.
No tender vows enhanced the scene,
Yet we were all eacli other's own;
We played at being king and queen,
With Earth's green carpet for our
throne,
And growled from visionary lairs,
Imagining that we were bears.
For forty minutes all was bliss,
No sorrow marred our mutual cup;
Then something seemed to go amiss,
And when our nurses hurried up
They found us both in tears immersed
Because the pink balloon had burst.
Torn from her lingering embrace
And vigorously slapped behind,
I watched her small pathetic face
Vanish from sight, but not from mind;
Then roared aloud, for oh! I felt
The tyrant hand upon my pelt.
We parted, ne'er to meet again:
My punctual tears bedewed the grass
For several weeks, and still the pain
Of mad regret declined to pass.
A broken child I used to brood
Through the long hours 'twixt food and
food.
And even now, though borne to man's
Estate upon a sea of cares,
I cannot pass the pelicans
But longing grips me unawares;
The presence of the upland goose
Sets floods of poignant memory loose.
MORE JIU-JITSU TRICKS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—After reading in
your columns IYAMA TERRA'S additional
chapters on Jiu-Jitsu, I am tempted to
give the public the advantage of two of
my favourite tricks which 1 have prac-
tised many years with unvarying success.
(1) To protect yourself from a man
who presents a loaded revolver full in
your face.
At first sight it would appear that the
man with the revolver has the advantage
over you, but a close study of my method
of defence will convince anybody that
the man is really completely in your
power.
First, with an adroit movement, catch
the muzzle of the revolver firmly be-
tween your teeth. Then with a quick
step towards your opponent get out your
matches. Strike one, and set fire to his
hair. He will of course put his hands
up to extinguish the flames, and so let go
of the revolver. He is now at your mercy,
and you can do as you like with him.
(2) To protect yourself from a man
who aims a blow at your face with his
clenched fist.
For the purposes of this trick it is
essential that you should be wearing
heavy boots. In the event of a quarrel
on the football field you will naturally
be forearmed, but should you and your
opponent be playing tennis you must
tactfully postpone the attack until you
have changed your shoes.
The method of defence is very simple.
As ho hits out at your face, and before
he reaches it, quickly stand on your
head. He will obviously hit your hob-
nailed boots, and his fist will suffer. His
next step will naturally be to stand on
his head and renew the attack, when
you immediately resume your former
position and he again hits your boots.
This must be continued until your
opponent is tired.—Yours, EIFIA NOFO.
SALIENT POINTS.
(For tlie July S<tles.)
0 MAIDENS young and frail,
If you 'd patronise a sale,
You must eat a solid meal before you
start;
Chip potatoes and a chop,
At a hasty-luncheon shop,
Ought to stimulate the muscles and the
heart.
You must train for many days,
For athleticism pays,
And to follow MILES and SANDOW is the
plan,
Then projecting life and limb
In the vortex of the scrim
You must tackle low, and collar what
you can.
Like BOADICEA of yore,
Indifferent to gore,
With elbow and umbrella you must
shove;
If insensible to pain,
You '11 eventually gain
The shining chine's chiffons that you
love.
You must gather to your breast
What you fancy, and the rest
It's comme il faut to throw upon the
ground;
And the counter you must leap
On the track of something cheap
If you can't find any way of getting
round.
In the thickest of the fight
There 's no time to be polite,
And only very little to be rude.
You'll find on "Remnant Days"
You return to nursery ways,
When your instinct of propriety was
crude.
But at length you make your haul,
And suburbwards you crawl,
Encumbered by the bargains you have
bagged,
And you struggle off to bed
With a palpitating head
To sleep the fitful slumber of the fagged.

nor compounding it
with the Italian

MONTEBIAXCO. His
great success will
certainly not at
present be as
Mefislo. As we miss BAUERMEISTCR'S Martlie, so do we
PLANCON'S Mefisto, and the absence of these two from the
Garden Scene is specially regrettable. However, to pluralise
the old proverb, "What will they do who come after the
King and Queen?" By the way, their MAJESTIES were
present, but the House was not by any means overcrowded.
"M. HEHOU)," says my lady-accom-
panist to me confidingly, "is the best-
Kxjking Fniixl I have seen for some
time." The other Fmixts mustn't be
angry: after all, this is but an opinion,
and please listen to the discount,—
"But," she added, "there is something
wanting." Quite so: it was not the
Faimt, though the part, at its best, is
not great.
The newly - painted church scene,
which has already been mentioned in
previous notes, works well. But would
it not strengthen the dramatic, effect
of this situation were Mffi&lo only heard
and never seen,—not even at the very
last moment? If there be a demoniacal
chorus it is "heard without," the
demoniacal whispers (battsi profondi)
are heard within: but the Devil who
cannot face a cross - handled sword
is hardly the sort of fiend to enter a
Cathedral, especially while a Requiem
is going on, and to monopolise the
interior of a substantial pillar. No,
Mefisto's promptings here should be vox
et prcetwea nitiil.
Marguerite. Mile. DOSAI.DA improved
greatly towards the finish. Brother
Valentin I had for the moment forgotten;
he ought to have stayed at home and
looked after his sister Mcy. Yet, had he
done eo, we should never have had the
story, nor this opera. Valentin is respon-
sible for everything; for the sake of the
dramatists and composers who have
treated the immortal subject we must
forgive him. On this occasion lie lived happily through
a scene and a halt and then, like CHARLES THE SECOND, only
without his courteous apology to the crowd about him, he
was "a long time a-dying."
Tuesday,—Auia. This Operatic Notist present by deputy.
Deputy remarks on crowded state of house, on absence of
Royalties, on splendid performance of GIUSEPPE VERDI'S opera,
now thirty-four years old and therefore just in its prime, on
the very effective mise-cn-sccne. especially notable in second
scene of Second Act, and, to wind up, on the genuine
enthusiasm of a thoroughly appreciative audience.
For Signor CARUSO as Raaainef and Mile. DESTINN as Aldti
there appear to be no adjectives sufficiently powerful to
express Deputy's admiration. In the regrettable absence of
Mine. KIKKUY LUSH, the part of Anmer'us is finely rendered by
Mile. OI.ITZKA, a name reminiscent of Byronic Ollnska and
Mazeppa, dramatised for ASTLKY'H Amphitheatre, reminiscent
also of H. J. Byronic burlesque on same subject, written
for that eccentric genius "Little ROHSON," who sentimentally
sang:
and
"Walk in, walk in, walk in, Olinnka, pray!
0 walk into the garden, 'tis a bright and sunny day,"
then burst into a lively, tuneful measure, and
an
indescribably nondescript dance which "brought down the
house."
Newly-arrived Signor SAM MARCO, as
my discreet Deputy

Singing and acting of Mile. GERVILLE-REACHE first-rate. As
to costume, Musical and Artistic Assistant supplies illus-
trated report. Is this Signer Orfeo or Mademoiselle Orphee?
Mile. GERVILLE-REACHE seems to have been undecided, and
to have compounded by attiring the character in what may be
described as "a Reavhc-me-down" garment. Spectators,
unfamiliar with the opera, wish to know if this individual, so j
clothed, represents Orpheus or Ettri/ilice. All doubt removed j
by entrance of Euridirc, a handsome young lady with a ,
very fine voice. Orphee is to be congratulated on excellent
taste.
Then followed the new One-Act opera by Signor FRANCO
LEONI entitled L'Oracolo. A gruesome story, known pre-
viously as Tin- Cut ami ll/e Chemb. Opera full of life (also
death) and action. Music charming. It went with a dasli
from start to finish. Performers and composer received
hearty applause. Signor SOOTTI, representing (Jim-Pen, who
is altogether a bad lot, made a very big hit; so did Mile.
DONALDA as Alt-Joe, with M. DALMOUES as her lover San-Lai.
Messrs. MARCOUX and COTREUIL as the two elders Uln-Sci and
Ilu-Tsin, with Mine. PAULIN as Hua-Qui the foolish nurse,
completed a very strong cast.
Not "completed," for there remains the American police-
man, who says nothing, sings nothing, sees nothing, and does
nothing. He is the very impersonation of Justice blind- j
folded. The scene, representing " a street in Chinese Quarter, j
San Francisco," painted by AL BRUK, is very effective. The
orchestra, conducted by M. ANDRE MESSAOER, is all that Signor
LEONI could possibly desire.
More on this subject when next opportunity offers.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
SIR JOHN FUULF.Y has spent a long and busy life in ad-
ministering first aid to the wounded in wac. His attention
has been directed less to surgical operations than to the
Commissariat department. In brief -brevity is forced upon
my Baronite in presence of the imposing catalogue of the
knight-errant's philantliropic enterprises - he lias during the
last thirty-five years followed on the track of armies, distributing
supplies alike to the soldiery and non-combatants. Begin-
ning in the Franco-German \\ar 1870-1 as Commissioner
of the British National Aid Society, he finished (for the
present) on the stricken field of battle in the Transvaal. He
relates his manifold experience in Peace and War (SMITH,
ELDER). Less heroic than other strains on the classic, topic
of war, his pages cast useful sidelights on the interminable
story. He was in Paris during the ruge of the Commune,
and sketches vivid pictures of its daily and nightly course.
Among his companions was LAWRENCE OLIPHANT, then acting
as correspondent of the T'nnex. The two were looking out
of a window in the Place Vcndome, fascinated by the horror
of the scene beneath, when a shot passed into the room
between their heads, covering them with stones and glass.
It was the signal that closed a brilliant career. That vulgar
impostor the "prophet" HARRIS had sent a message to OLIPHANT
that when a bullet passed through the window of a room
in which he chanced to be, he must regard it as a call to
America. As bullets were at this time flying thickly about
windows in Paris and Versailles it was a pretty safe omen,
OLIPHANT promptly accepted it, leaving forthwith for America,
where HARRIS gorged himself with his estate.
The h'eyent of the Roues (HmviiiNSoN) was the Due d'OiiLEANS
who governed France for a while after the death of Louis XI\r.
He was so called from his association with a body of the
dissolute scamps who helped to prepare the way for the
Revolution which cleared the air and the laud at the close
of the century. A suggested derivation of the now familiar
word is that this select circle were so warmly attached
to the Regent that they were ready to be broken on the wheel
(7a roue) for him. My Baronite thinks it is a pity they did
not all come to an end justly deserved. In compiling his
work Colonel HAOOARD has industriously rooted about the
garbage gathered by the memoirists, diarists, and letter-
writers of the ago, and lias produced a series of piquant
chapters which illustrate its lurid, almost incredible wicked-
ness. The State was corrupt from its head to its meanest
agent; the hapless people, dumb driven cattle, bearing the
burden of the cost. The book reveals some gruesome episodes
of public and social life in Paris in the heyday of the Bour-
bons. Colonel H.\(!('!Aiio has forgotten, or never learned, much
authoritative matter about the Man in the Iron Mask revealed
since the conjectures of VOLTAIRE, which In- accepts as finally
solving the mystery.
A Lindsay's Lore, by CHARLEH LOWE (published by
T. WERNER LACRIE in Scotch-plaid cover), purports to be
an .autobiographical account of strange, varied and most
romantic adventures prosaically told by a stalwart hot-headed
Scotchman possessing small sense of humour, but gifted with
a memory for poetic quotations which he has an irritating
knack of applying as mottoes for the headings of all the
chapters. Whether the author assumes a stolid literary
style for the purposes of this story, or whether such style
be his own, the Baron is unable to determine, and he
can only describe this book as the work of a "Wandering
WILLIE," gifted with Mr. Wenrj's weakness for "dropping
into poetry," with the additional faculty of lugging in
his own pure Scotch, -which, to the Baron at least, is as
unintelligible as would be a Maori madrigal. At page 352
the hero, such as he is, correctly sums up his own character
thus, "'What a fool! what a fool!' I muttered. 'The
Emperor?" (asks his cousin Margaret). 'Oh, no, I mean
myself,' I sneered in self-contempt." (" Hear! hear!" from
the Baron.)
Here is an example of the Scot's notion of humour.
Lindsay has identified (as he thinks) the corpse of his
lady-love A/arg«irf, who lias (he concludes) committed suicide.
This body of evidence he causes to be interred in the
cemetery of Pere-la-Chaise. Subsequently he meets his
Margaret very much alive, and when walking together he
points out to her the Morgue, which place, he tells her, "with
a nudge and a grim smile, 'is where I found your corpse.'
at which she nearly burst out laughing at the idea, and
progged me with her muff reproachfully." Hit's humour
the reader wants, can he get anything finer than this as
displayed in the above quotation? "'I doubt it,' said the
Carpenter." Certainly he will not in this book.
That the protagonist of this novel is a muddler and med-
dler will be the verdict of all who read the book, which, in
spite of its dragging its slow
portion of the story, and in
spite of its being considerably
over-written, is not only read-
able, but cu riously exciting, and
as genuinely interesting as
should be any personal revela-
tion of the forces at work
immediately before, and dur-
ing, the Franco-German War.
"Patienza! ivila tout!" says
the Baron while certainly re-
commending this book to those
of his friends who still dearly
love a good romance.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AVEBU Rl AN A.
THE TEST MATCH.
To begin with, what is a test? It is
a trial of strength. The Australians
met the English at "cricket's manly
toil" (BYRON), to see which were the
stronger. The English were the stronger.
May it ever be so! And yet we must
not forget that the Australians are
English too, our own kith and kin, and
so remembering we must not be too
triumphant. For are we not all of one
family, differing only over the advisa-
bility, as I am told, of bowling leg-breaks
wideof the leg stump, yet not wide enough
to be penalised by that ARISTIDES of the
pitch, the umpire? Oh the little more,
and how much it is, as the poet says.
A little more and ARMSTRONG would
have bowled (horresco referens!) a wide;
a little less and he would have been, in
the ropes, in the words of a nephew ol
my own now at school, where language
is elastic, carted over the ropes.
The match just finished contain?
many lessons for us all. Let us look at
TVLDESLEY'S two innings- -how different,
and how illustrative of the uncertainties
of life! In the first innings this gallant
little Lancastrian, who is, I am told, not
above five feet eight, in a vain endeavour
to defend his wicket -his honour, as they
would say in the House of Commons—
fell to one LAYER, a lengthy antipodean
who, coming with the team to arrange its
affairs and pay its bills, is now its best
bowler: another instance of the unfore-
seen. So much for TYLDESLEY'S first
innings, in which he makes a round
round 0. But in the second he makes
—what? a hundred—the same number
of runs as of books in the list which I
once compiled.
Is there not a lesson kere? Nil
dfsperandum, never despair. There 's
no fault so great that it cannot be
amended. Second innings, like second
thoughts, are best. And yet, are they?
For did not the Hon. F. S. JACKSON
make 144 in the first innings and only
17 in the second? Perhaps it is unsafe
to generalise even to the least extent on
this most elusive of games. There is
something curiously interesting about
the first innings of the English captain.
He made 144. What does that repre-
sent? Twelve times twelve. How odd
for the captain of an eleven to make
twelve times twelve !" The dear and the
dumpy twelves," as the poet says.
Let us look at other members of the
English team. There is Mr. FRY. Mr.
FRY has a household name. His Maga-
zine is read far and wide; he heads the
average by many runs. But tall and
powerful man though he be, he could
not make as many nans in two innings
as little TYLDESLEY in one. Do we not see

Dyspeptic Of wi. "H'M, I 'M AFRAID WE SHALL HAVE TO PUT & cum UPON OUR APPETITES."

a lesson there? The race is not always
to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.
I remember once playing a little
stump cricket in the Vale of Chamonix,
and being struck by the littleness of the
game compared with the majesty of
those awful peaks. None the less it is
an admirable pastime, eliciting the best
of its votaries and subjecting .them to
severe tests of endurance and skill. A
long innings can be fatiguing enough
even when one has someone to run for
one—as 1 always do; what must it be
when one runs everything oneself?
TYLDESLEY no doubt would tell us were
he here, which he is not. I remember
how tired I was in making those
hundred best books.
Have you ever thought how interesting
are cricketers' names and initials. W. W.
ARMSTRONG, that is a fine name. And
what does W. W. stand for? They are
magic letters in Anglo-Saxon literature.
WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, WILLIAM WATSON,
WALT WHITMAN—to name none others.
There was also a W. W. READ; but that
obviously should have been Read W. W.,
an incentive to the study of one or
more of these poets. But NOBLE—how
fine a name! M. A. NOBLE—his very
initials make a man. I note that this
cricketer not only bats but bowls, and
it was he who caught out FRY. If ]
were not myself I would be NOBLE or
LII.LEY. That is a name of great and
delicate beauty. "In the beauty of the
lilies," as the poet says. But whose
name is this? A peer's son's? No, the
only peer's son present is named JACKSON.
A gentleman's? No, the gentlemen are
named FRY and BOSANQUET. A mere
professional then? Yes. This beautiful
name falls to a mere professional, one
who does not play merely for his ex-
penses, but is paid a trifle more. Is there
not a lesson there? Is there not u
lesson everywhere? I once met a county
cricketer in an hotel at Florence, and we
walked round the Uffizi together. I
forget his name. Ah, well. "Life is
real, life is earnest, and the grave is not
its goal," but the goal has nothing to do
with cricket. That is a football term.
And here I close.

On notoriety you have your heart set,
It should be easy work to earn a name
And be a boom in what is called the Smart Set;
But why not choose some method (such as charity)
Less open to the charge of mere vulgarity?
Your arts are new to our benighted shores,
Yet now and then we read a Yankee rumour
Of some portentous meal like this of yours,
And say, "We hoped they had a sense of humour!1'

But. there is one thing that puzzles me extremely."
"Yes, Aunt?" said the Sub-Editor meekly, as he sipped
his tea.
"Why, I notice that the contents bill invariably has one
word calculated to stimulate the morbid curiosity of the
reader. An adjective."
"Circulation depends upon adjectives," said the Sub-Editor.
"I don't think 1 object to them," the old lady replied,
"but what I want you to tell me is how you choose them.
How do you decide whether an occurrence is 'remarkable'
or ' extraordinary,''astounding' or 'exciting,''thrilling' or
'alarming,' 'sensational' or merely 'strange,' 'startling' or
'unique '? What tells you which word to use?"
"Well, Aunt, we have a system to indicate the adjective to
a nicety; but——"
"My dear HORACE, I will never breathe a word. You should
know that. No one holds the secrets of the Press more sacred
than I."
The Sub-Editor settled himself more comfortably in his
chair.
"You see, Aunt, the great thing in an evening paper is
human interest. What we want to get is news to hit the
man-in-the-street. Everything that we do is done for the
man-in-the-street. And therefore we keep safely locked up
in a little room a tame man of this description. He may not
be much to look at, but his sympathies are right, unerringly
right. He sits there from nine till six, and lias things to eat
now and then. We call him the Thrillometer."
"How wonderful! How proud you should be, HORACE, to
be a part of this mighty mechanism, die Press."
"I am, Aunt. Well, the duties of the Thrillometer are very
simple. Directly a piece of news comes in, it is the place of
one of the Sub-Editors to hurry to the Tlirillometer's room
and read it to him. I have to do this."
"Poor boy. You are sadly overworked, I fear."
"Yes, Aunt. And while I read I watch his face. Long
study has told me exactly what degree of interest is excited
within him by the announcement. I know instantly whether
his expression means 'phenomenal' or only 'remarkable,'
whether 'distressing' or only 'sad,' whether'
"la there so much difference between 'distressing' and
'sad,' HORACE?"
"Oh, yes, Aunt. A suicide in Half Moon Street is ' distress-
ing ;' in the City Road it is only ' sad.' Again, a raid on a
club in Whitechapel is of no account; but a raid on a West-
End club is worth three lines of large type in the bill, above
FRY'S innings."
"Do you mean a club in Soho when you say West-End?"
"Yes, Aunt, as a rule."
"But why do you call that the West-End?"
"That was the Tlirillometer's doing, Aunt. He fell asleep
over a club raid, and a very good one too, when I said it was
in Soho; but when I told him of the next—also in Soho, chiefly
Italian waiters—and said it was in the West-End, his eyes
nearly came out of his head. So you see how useful the
Thrillometer can be."
"Most ingenious, HORACE. Was this your idea?"
"Yes, Aunt."
"Clever boy. And have the other papers adopted it?"
"Yes, Aunt. All of them."
"Then you are growing rich, HORACE?"
"No, no, Aunt, not at all. Unfortunately I lack the busi-
ness instinct. Other people grow rich on my ideas. In fact,
so far from being rich, I was going to venture to ask you"

Youthfully made-up Spinster, over forty, just engaged, proudly introduces her Young Betrothed to the Family Gardener.
Family Gardener. "AH, Miss LETTT, I'M THAT GLAD! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOB THIS DAY FOB THE LAST TWENTY YEABS!"
TO WOULD-BE WOMEN WRITERS.
(Being a few notes supplementary to a resent
article liy ELL-N 'J U-RN-OB-FT F-WL-B.)
"IF yoii wish to be effective in litera-
ture you must learn the art o£ putting
yourself in another person's place: not
only in that of your characters, but also
of your readers." I used these remark-
able words in a recent article, and doubt-
less you would like to know why I used
them. Well, there were two reasons. I
wrote them because they contained a
good thought well expressed, and had
real literary beauty despite the gram-
matical construction. As to their truth,
that surely is sufficiently proved by the
fact that they appeared in print. When
I wrote them I put myself in the place
of the editor of the great morning paper
for which I intended them. That is
why they were duly published. I feel
quite certain they wouldn't have been if
the editor had been in his place instead
of me.
But there are other things besides
changing places that contribute to
literary effectiveness, and the chief of
these is domestic usefulness. There is,
as I stated in the article, "a general
idea afloat" (and also, let me add now,
ashore) "that a woman's literary success
makes against her domestic usefulness"
—that she cannot "wield the poker as
well as the pen." "Why not ?" I asked.
"She has two hands: therefore, why
cannot she hold both pen and poker at
the same time, using each as she thinks
fit?" Having rubbed in that point
with characteristic humour in the article,
I went on to urge you, the would-be
women writers, "to give your whole
attention to the matter in hand." This,
perhaps, needs further elucidation. You
will ask "Which hand?" Ah, dear
would-be women writers, there is the
secret. I had that difficulty to deal
with when I began — when I was a
would-be. And what did I do? Exactly
what I am advising you to do. When
I wrote that article I had a pen in one
hand and a poker in the other, and I
used each as I thoxight fit. In fact I
wrote it with the poker. It is simplicity
itself.
And it is this very idea—to quote
again from the article—that induces
many a girl who is bored, as I aptly
remarked, by "the trivial round, the
common task," to fly to literature and
to make up her mind to write. Let her
write a book if she can—and must: but
let her remember that doing the one is
no excuse for leaving the other undone.
Those were my very words. The mean-
ing, I think, is obvious. When a girl has
made the fire there is absolutely no
excuse for her not writing the book.
One last word of advice. If you
cannot write anything else, write a wash-
ing book.

TT is officially denied that, when the
crew of the Potemkin formally declared
war against the Russian Government,
the Russian Government formally called
upon France to fulfil her treaty obliga-
tions on the ground that her ally was
now being attacked by two Powers.
It is evidently realised even in Ger-
many that the KAISER'S Morocco policy
has strengthened the Entente between
France and Great Britain, for a leading
German paper now states that it was
never sought to weaken those relations.
As a result of the new War Office
Regulations it is thought that twenty-
five per cent, of the Volunteers will be
weeded out on account of being physi-
cally unfit. But they will not neces-
sarily be lost to their country. A good
many of them will no doubt enlist in
the regular army.
Since a gentleman wrote to the Daily
Mail to say that he had found digging
for an hour or two in stiff soil a cure
for worry, a huge demand has arisen
in the City for offices with a little back
garden, into which the principal can run
each tinie the office-toy makes a mistake.
The Parliamentary Return on the
assessment and payment of income tax
shows that there are only twenty persons
in Great Britain in receipt of incomes
exceeding £50,000 a year. This is a
scandal which calls for an immediate
remedy.
At the attempted inauguration of the
electric system on the Underground,
"the Metropolitan Railway," we read,
"was affected by the breakdowns on the
District Railway." This is very touching.
The members of the Yorkshire Auto-
mobile Club last week took sixty patients
from the Huddersfield Infirmary for a
drive, the members having decided to
lend their cars for this purpose on one
day in each year. It is pleasant to
remember that the relations between
motorists and hospitals have always
been clos-'e.
At the Congress of Medical Officers
of Health Dr. HERBERT JONES, of Hereford,
pointed out the usefulness of motor cars
to medical men in enabling them rapidly
to reach their patients. The more daring
the driver, in fact, the more quickly lie
comes across a patient.
Other doctors expressed the opinion
that motoring undoubtedly benefits
public health. It is certainly reducing
tVip number of deaf persons.
As a result of the visit of the KING
and QUEEN to Harrow the boys are to
have an extra week's holiday, and their
parents' feelings of loyalty are strained
almost to breaking point.
The Summer Sales started last week,
and it has been calculated that already
1,000,000 odd ladies liave purchased
2,000,000 odd articles which they do not
require.
The Cartoon Gallery at Hampton
Court has been closed until further
notice. In some quarters this is believed
to be due to pique at the success of
Mr. F. C. GOILU'S show in Bond Street.
A medical commission in Puerto Rico
is, it is stated, applying with success a
newly - discovered cure to the "lazy
worm" disease, which afflicts with abso-
lute idleness about 95 per cent, of the
inhabitants of the interior of the island.
The fact that the commission is meeting
with no opposition is said to be due to
the fact that labour is not yet properly
organised in those parts.
It is comforting to learn that England
is not the only country where mis-
carriages of justice take place. At
Lemberg in Austria, last week, a taxi-
dermist discovered, in the stomach of a
pet monkey which lie was stuffing, a
diamond brooch, for the alleged theft of
which the owner's valet had been sent
to prison. In this case, we understand,
there was not, as in the BECK case, the
mitigating circumstance of resemblance
between the actual and the supposed
thief.
The Report of the Deputy Master of
the Mint, showing that fewer coins were
issued last year than in the previous
twelve months, confirms the popular
view that the supply of money has
recently been unequal to the demand.
The statement that West Ham is

they have been very well stung.

RIPPLES FROM THE PIERS.
["Now that the Prince of WALES has shown
the way, Society may tnke to the Thames in
London as a fashionable resort." — Daily
Paper.]
STEAMBOAT parties have been notably
gay and many this week, and the floating
piers were quite six inches below the
normal level on Sunday morning as the
result of the "rush to the river." At
Westminster, during the fashionable
hour for boating, the crush was excep-
tionally great. Nothing more serious
occurred, however, than the loss of Lady
LACKGEAR'S Maltese toy. Fortunately
Lord LACKOEAR, who was trying for por-
poises off Old Swan Pier, was able to
gaff the mite as it passed.
There is a stage whisper that a short
season of floating plays is to be tried
with a drama especially written by Mr.
W. W. JACODS, entitled Mud is Thicker
than Water. If the idea is matured it
is possible that the Savoy Thentre, once
the home of light opera, may itself find
a home on a lighter.
Quite a charming innovation was
recently carried out by some members of
the Smart Set. Upon the delightfully
cool and shadowy buttresses of London
Bridge a number of small card-tables were
cunningly clamped, and here Society was
to be seen indulging in the game of the
hour. Between the rubbers, the members
of the Mayfair Otter Club gave a display
of life saving, while as a final surprise,
at twelve o'clock, Mr. HAYDEN COFFIN
appeared upon the parapet and sang, " I
Stood on the Bridge at Midnight"
The next show of the Ladies' Kennel
Association is to be held on the Isle of
Dogs, provided that the Barking authori-
ties are willing.
The new promenade piers in con-
nection with the Savoy Hotel are to be
commenced at once, and it is confidently
anticipated that shrimp and winkle teas
will become a feature of the season.
It was almost impossible to obtain
steamboats on Tuesday when the Guards
held their aquatic sports at Pimlico.
A Duchess, who is noted for her pluck
and energy, was enthusiastically greeted
when she arrived on a life-buoy. An
unfortunate gloom was cast over the
proceedings later, owing to the sudden
disappearance of Captain AVOIR DI' Poia
during the mud hunt.

VI ET ARMIS.
THE Commissioners appointed to in-
quire into the present system of collecting
the Income-tax have at length finished
their labours and drawn up a Report,
advising, inter alia, that additional
Parliamentary powers should be applied
for, to enable collectors to carry out
their duties more effectually. We ven-
ture to suggest that the following powers
should also be added to those recom-
mended by the Commissioners :--
1. Power to enable a collector to enter
the shop of any trader, reasonably sus-
pected of under-rating his income, and
to carry off his books and rifle the
till.
2. Power to enable any Police Con-
stable (without the necessity of applying
for a warrant) to arrest anyone, in any
public highway, who may look as if he
was the sort of man who, if he had an
income, would be likely to make a false
return concerning the same.
3. Power to enable the said P.-C. to
reverse any such person as aforesaid, and
stand him on his head, so that the money
(if any) shall fall out of his trouser-
pockets.
4. Power in all cases to collect the
Income-tax with a club.
5. Power to extract all arrears of
Income-tax, from any person reasonably
suspected of owing the same, by any
known means of persuasion; the said
means to include the rack, thumbscrew
and boiling oil.

ROBERT.
WHEN we recount with proper zeal
Our love of legal institutions,
How Britous base the public weal
On laws and not on revolutions,
That where the British Standard waves
You note an instant slump in slaves;
Our souls are punctured by a sense
Of well-deserved superiority,
And, should our neighbours ask us,
"Whence
This firm obedience to authority?"
We heave an unctuous smile and praise
The Englishman's inherent traits.
We bid them note how down the street,
Where cabs and 'buses wildly jostle,
Guiding them deftly with his feet
Stands Discipline's alert apostle;
Ay, robed in unpretentious blue,
The man to whom the credit 's due!
The highway's autocrat, he stands
Amid the swollen tide of traffic,
And waves a pair of awesome hands,
And grunts his orders, terse but
graphic.
And lo! the headlong stream stands
fast,
While two old fogies trickle past.
As nought to him the cabman's rage,
The shibboleth of foreign chauffeurs,
The costermonger's persiflage,
The idle jeers of casual loafers,
The gross but not unkindly wheeze
Aimed at the man's extremities.
In vain the drayhorse paws the air,
The flow of low abuse grows brisker;
He never turns an injured hair,
Or lifts a deprecating whisker,
For he knows well enough that they
May gibe, but dare not disobey!
Whether in dark, secluded walks
He flouts the schemes that bad men
work us;
Or maiden ladies, screaming " Lawks!"
Hang on his neck in Oxford Circus;
His mien displays an abstract calm
That soothes the fractured nerves like
balm.
Who spoors the burglar's nimble feet,
And spots the three-card man's devices?
Who hales before the judgment seat
The vendor of unwholesome ices?
Who 'K apt at any time to have his
Complexion spoiled by hob-nailed
navvies?
It is indeed our ROBERT, or,
As some prefer to say, our "BOBBY ";
The civil servant, paid to floor
The wiles of those who'd kill or rob

And when we hear of fresh alarms,
Of bombs and mutiny and massacre,
Of citizens dispersed by arms,
In countries where such things, alas!
occur,
Well may we urge our ROBERT'S claim
Alike to gratitude and fame.

HER mother had significantly left them
together in the conservatory. The
moment had come to make her under-
stand how much he loved her. He had
been in a similar situation once or twice
before, under the unc'ien regime, but
then it was comparatively easy. Now,
under a code of etiqtiette founded chiefly
ou the latest fashion Ln bacteria, he felt
his position embarrassing. A kiss had
long been considered a criminal pro-
ceeding, on purely hygienic grounds.
Inapassioued speech was but the setting
free of millions of microscopic prisoners
desirous of a change of lung. He must
not even press her little hand, well know-
ing what malignant hosts science had
placed within its few rounded square
inches—not to mention those that lurked
in his own extensive palm.
Standing at a safe hygienic distance,
therefore, he stretched out his arms
towards her, longingly, like an amorous
tenor at the Opera. He did not sing, of
course. That had long since been for-
bidden, as putting more microbes into
circulation than even impassioned speech.
He did not speak, feeling that the level,
more or less sterilised conversation,
which alone science still permitted to be
sparingly used, would be out of place
on this occasion. But he gazed upon
her so ardently that the few thousand
bacilli temporarily resident amongst his
eyelashes were seriously inconvenienced
by the rising temp Tature.
She smiled, and shook her head very
gently. Everything was done very
gently now, by persons with the
slightest pretence to civilisation, in
order to avoid disturbing the circum-
ambient legions of the enemy. But
whilst he admired her discretion he
doubted her moaning. Was it "No"?
Or that she did not understand? Or
that he was going the wrong way to
work? Or that she deemed herself
unworthy? He carefully sat down at
his end of the conservatory and thought
it out.
Then she frowned—frowned so un-
mistakably that he shuddered to think
how many hundred thousand genus,
happy tenants of the arches of her
brows, would be dislodged by so alarm-
ing a dislocation of their dwelling. As,
however, he still remained motionless,
her behaviour became even more fool-
hardy and unscientific. With a primi-
tive impulsiveness calculated to despatch
every microbe in the conservatory upon
a new predatory errand, she rushed to
the antiseptic fountain that played
amongst the palms, and filled a watering-
can from its cool disinfectant. The last
thing to be civilised, he reflected, will
be woman, but he had barely time to
finish the quotation. For with the rose
of the watering-can she was tracing in
pinkish spray upon the tiled floor the
three letters YES.

IN view of the proposed revival of
Latin for conversational purposes Mr.
Punch has drawn up the following

this context will not have escaped the
notice of even the most superficial ob-

of using strong language in the vernacu-

the ball is lying dead, only a dead
language can render justice to the
situation.

SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVES FOR
CRICKET SCREENS.
DEAR MR. PCXCH,—In view of recent
events, it is a matter of urgent gravity
that the subject of screens for test
matches should be kept before the
public eye, but I have an alternative
proposal to make, which will, I am
assured, meet with approval from player
and spectator alike. ., •-
You will remember that in a recent
match of national importance a famous
batsman was clean bowled in conse-
quence of a lady spectator, attired in
chocolate brown, rising from her seat
in the immediate background of the
ball, and waving her match-card to an
acquaintance. Another brilliant innings
was nipped in the bud, on the same
occasion, entirely owing to the fact that
the sun's rays struck an uplifted ginger-
beer bottle in the shilling seats, and so
dazzled the unfortunate batsman that he
unintentionally placed the ball into the
hands of short slip. In both these cases,
as you will remember, the umpire was
obdurate in his decision, and as it seems
probable that the effervescent sympathy
of the halfpenny press will lead to no
definite results it is incumbent on all
lovers of true sport to come forward and
protect the flower of our British batsmen
and their averages.
Now, Sir, 1 wish to put forward a
proposition which, while not in any way
interfering with the view of the game
on the part of that necessary nuisance
the spectator, will enable the batsman
to see the ball with perfect accuracy
from either end of the pitch. I suggest
the erection of six rows of patent seats
of my own invention, for the accommo-
dation of those who wish to view the
play from the point of vantage behind
the bowler at each end of the ground.
These seats must be painted a uniform
buff colour, and furnished with a
mechanical contrivance which will
render any movement on the part of
the occupant absolutely impossible. As
he takes his seat, steel grips, suitably
padded, spring mechanically from the
arms and legs of the chair and securely
pinion those of the spectator, while a
similar contrivance gently but firmly
encircles the neck and supports the
head in an easy but upright position.
The attendant in charge then proceeds
to fasten a long buff-colotired apron and
combination hood and cape garment, of
the same colour round the person of the
seat-holder, so that the whole scheme of
colour is immovable and unbroken, and
provides a perfect background for the
flight of the ball. At the lunch and tea
interval and the close of an innings, the
attendant touches a secret spring at the
end of each row, when the grips will
fly back again, and the spectator is at

liberty to move if he feels inclined. He
may either leave his cape and apron
behind or take it with him to lunch, but
in this case a small deposit must be
paid. The charge for the seats, however,
will not be raised above the usual
amount, unless the rush on them is so
great that a prohibitive price is deemed
advisable by the management.
Trusting that the adoption of this
idea may be a source of satisfaction to
all concerned, and foster the fraternal
feeling between player and spectator so
necessary for the lasting success of our
national game,
I am, Yours faithfully,
A LOVER OF SPORT.
ACCORDING to the special correspondent
of the Daily Mail, on the occasion of the
visit of His Royal Highness to Cardiff,
"the villagers of St. Fagan sang 'God
bless the Prince of Wales' in Welsh. A
cornet also rendered the same stirring air
in English." We have always regarded
the cornet as a speaking instrument.
"LOST, June 17, ... black and white
mongrel male puppy, rather longish hair, looks
a little like King Charles, answers name Fido."
—Adrt. in "Daily 3/aj?."
IT will be seen that the resemblance
to King CHARLES is only superficial. The
deceased monarch would, of course,
never have answered to the name Fido.

OBEE! 0 busy Bee!
From earliest years I have mistrusted thee.
When in my copy-book I had to praise
Thy model ways,
Scrawling vain pneans of thy virtuous traits;
When, for my boyish sins, they made me write,
By day and night,
Lines from the Geor<jic$ till my head was light,
My hand quite ruined, scribbling repetitions
Of thy confounded tricks by way of impositions—
I loathed thee, Bee! Deep in my inmost heart
I cursed the art
Which with a monomaniac ardour burned
Still to improve the seasons which were sunny,
Until my spirit at thy virtues turned,
As did my tummy from thy nauseous honey.
But now, 0 Bee,
After long years abate thy priggish pride!
The boyish instinct which mistrusted thee
Is more than justified.
Thy industry is but a mad desire,
The passion of the miser to acquire,
At any cost to heap up hoards of wealth,
Regardless of thy soul's and body's health.
Some nervous trouble robs thy wretched breast
Of any thought of rest,
And drives thee evermore to slave and slave.
Then sink exhausted to an early grave.
0 futile Bee!
Why waste the shining hours in drudgery?
Come, learn a lesson in thy turn, and own
The larger wisdom of thy brother drone.
His is the life of leisure: no wild flurry
Keeps him forever in a hurry-scurry;
He lingers round a rose to con its beauties
Unvexed by thoughts of honey-making duties,
And all the time he does not spend in drinking
He may, if so he choose, devote to thinking.
0 over-rated Bee!
Give up thy strait-laced virtues! Try to see
That thou art cursed with a most narrow mind,
To all the nobler things of life stone-blind!
Adopt this broader view—
Remodel on the drone's .thy life anew,
And even yet thou mayest find in me
A follower of thee,
0 neurasthenic Bee!

Ouit ARTIST TRUSTS THAT THE HUMOUR THAT THE "UNnEsiitABLF.s" INTEND TO no A BIT HF LOBBYING THKMSEI.YES is INCORRECT.
House of Commons, Monday, July 3.—
Since on a historical occasion Mr. J. G.
TxrBOT was present in tke House when
GRAND CROSS "heard a smile" he lias not
been so distressed as to-day, when he
learned that on Saturday the SPEAKER
took part in a cricket match. He is not
to be comforted even by the fact that
the right hon. gentleman in the first
innings by masterly play carried out his
bat, having added four to the score.
"It is too risky," J. G. insists, sadly
shaking his head. "Suppose a ball

they say, to leg — had caught the
SPEAKER'S eye? GRANT LAWSON an ex-
cellent Chairman, I admit, and T. P.

to take the SPEAKER'S Chair in the

which is, indeed, that statesman's cus-

weather has marked effect on a tempera-
ment habitually at bubbling point. Ques-
tions cut off by discovery that it was five

tempestuous tossing of coat tails; an-
nounced that on point of order he
desired to put a question to SPEAKER.
Led up to it by discursive remarks ac-
companied by much shaking of fist in
the direction of WALTER LONG, who,
presumably, had been either again
breaking the Sabbath on the motor-car,
or secretly receiving members of the
Orange Society in a dark room at Dublin
Castle. At the end of five minutes,
these alternative points becoming in-
creasingly involved, SPEAKER interposed.
"I understood," he blandly remarked,
"the hon. gentleman desired to ask me
a question."

"Yes, Sir," shouted SWIFT MACNEILL,
grateful that there was at least one man
in the House who understood him.
"Then will he kindly ask it?" said
the SPEAKER.
SWIFT MACNEILL gasped. Why, he was
coining to the question by-and-by! He
hadn't been more than five minutes
offering a few preliminary remarks. So
upset by the turn given to things that,
without more ado, he put, his question.
It turned out to have nothing to do
either with motor-cars or secret conclaves,
but related to alleged nonappearance on
the paper of Ministerial answers to ques-
tions which had not been put.
Business done.—Aliens Bill in Com-
mittee.
2.20 A.M. Thursday.—A quaint place,
this House of ours. With close of Session
almost in view, work is in hopelessly
backward state. Not too much to begin
with. Conducted on ordinary business
methods might have been practically
accomplished. As things stand it is
already evident that several Bills must
be dropped. Whereupon PRINCE ARTHUR
gaily announces intention of grappling
with great Constitutional question of
Redistribution.
That by the way. Question at the
moment is, How is the Aliens Bill to be
got through Committee? Ingenuous
unimaginative man of business would
reply, "Sit down and get to work at it."
An eight-hour day would suffice to
dispose of the remaining amendments
if they were taken in hand by Com-
mittee primarily and solely anxious to
make the best of a Bill.
Is that what we do at Westminster?
! No, my friend. We spend the eight
hours, with eighty minutes thrown in,
; in wrangling round a proposal to set to
work. PRINCE ARTHUR puts his shoulder
not to the wheel but to the guillotine.
With its assistance he undertakes to
turn out a brand-new Aliens Bill by a
given hour on a certain day. Literally,
orders will be executed with Punctuality
and Despatch.
Through the hot summer night the
hosts contended. From the beginning no
doubt about issue. The PINK 'UN, per-
spicacious and perspiring, had whipped
his men in line. There was just the off-
chance that, lured by sense of false
security, Ministerialists might be caught
napping. Such opportunity seemed to
present itself shortly after-9 o'clock,
; when Members, more hurried than
HUDSON at the Vatican in Dizzy's day,
came back grumbling from prematurely
broken-up dinner parties.
There followed one of those little
ironies too familiar to attract attention.
PRINCE ARTHUR'S proposal was to apply
the closure with intent to hurry on the
Aliens Bill. Opposition, affronted at
this attempt to tamper with the privileges
of free speech, denounced it at length.
But if they were to reduce the Govern-
ment majority it must be done at once,
before Sybarites, dallying at the dinner
table, trooped in. Ministers, conscious
of the perilous situation, put up the
faithful EVANS-GORDON to say nothing at
prodigious length. There are on the
Ministerial side several convenient taps
that may at moment's notice be turned
on with the design of filling up time
till the clans muster. BANBURY'S good.
The one labelled "EVANS-GORDON" even
more certain of sustained supply.
Opposition, hungry for a division,
impatiently murmured. The waters of
Tower Hamlets, tepid, inexhaustible,
flowed on till the PINK TN, hurrying
hither and thither counting heads, as-
sured himself that danger was past.
The tap abruptly turned off in the
middle of (so to speak) a pint, DALZIF.I,
jumped up and moved the closure with
j the object of bringing to an immediate
, issue his own amendment directed in
indignant protest against PRINCF. ARTHUR'S
I Closure Resolution.
Yet no one laughed, cried "Ha, ha!"
or wagged his head in commentary on
this application of the homoeopathic prin-
ciple. On the contrary, Ministerialists
supporting PRINCE ARTHUR'S closure
scheme angrily shouted "No!" when
the SPEAKER submitted DALZIEL'S motion
for immediate application of the closure,
the Opposition, blanched with horror at
PRINCE ARTHUR'S attack on freedom of
speech, lustily approving it.
Business done. —After nine hours'
debate, House resolved to begin to debate
on Aliens Bill under closure rules.

THE NET PROPHET.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Deeply impressed by
a great halfpenny paper's reports of the
lawn tennis championship at Wimble-
don, I venture to send you an account
of a game played here at the Puddleton
Tournament. I cannot flatter myself
that I have equalled the brilliance of my
model, but I have done my best.
"With peremptory significance the
neighbouring clocks stnick three. The
hour had come, and as the last stroke
rang out Mr. SLASHER stepped fearlessly
on to the level sward, where BISQUE —the
inimitable BISQUE, unrivalled master of
the three-quarter volley — was calmly
awaiting him. With a single superb
gesture Mr. SLASHKR flung aside his coat,
parted his hair neatly down the middle,
adjusted his tie, and whirled his 48-oz.
racket into position. A frown.of rugged
determination sat firmly on his brow.
Mr. BISQUE was a trifle pale, but he
whistled a bar or two of 'The Dcrout
Locer,' as lie flung his weapon fearlessly
towards the skies. 'Heads!' cried his
opponent, and a close scrutiny of the
racket, now fallen to the ground, showed
that heads it was. Accordingly, BISQUF.
selected the left-hand court and began
to serve. First he put in a series of
brilliant yorkers, eacli of which, how-
ever, was triumphantly volleyed by his
dauntless enemy. But nothing could
disconcert Mr. BISQUE. He merely
snapped his teeth with a loud explosion,
cleared his throat, carelessly flung a
ball full at the umpire's head, and
sneezed twice. And then he delivered
a string of top-screw back-handers which
curled three ways and quite perplexed
liis rival, with the result that after the
score had thrice been called 'half-thirty,
fifteen,' it was noted down on the credit
side of Mr. BISQUE'S account. But Mr.
SLASHER was by no means done with.
Placing his cap inside out on the back
of his head, he ran jauntily in to his
opponent's drive, twice in succession
placing it cleverly beyond the boundary.
Another game, and 'vantage-set all' was
the umpire's verdict.
"The excitement grew fast and furious.
Ladies nervously pulled out their hair-
pins and strewed them on the ground.
The men waited, tense with emotion.
Could BISQUE by means of his drop-hooks
from the base-line out-manoeuvre his foe?
SLASHER alone was calm. He drank two
cups of tea, with three lumps of sugar
in each, placed his tie on the centre of
the net, and sent in the most wonderful
cross-shots right down the middle line.
Not even BISQUE, with all his skill, could
make headway against such tactics, and
with a^ sigh [of resignation he hauled
down his^flag,rand acknowledged defeat
by eleven games to four. How will he
fare in the next round against Mr.
LOBBER? Thousands are asking that to go to a certain firm for petrol, theirs

"Broke a rib, did it?" said the Aus-

.4. lilodern Cricketer speaks:—
OH shades of FELIX, LILLYWHITE,
MYKN, OSBALDESTON, PADR,
I./X)k earthward from your wickets bright
In some tlirice happy star!
Look down and tell us, Is the game
We mortals play to-day the same
AB that which won you deathless fame
When you were what we are?
Shades of the Old Cricketers reply:—
We look down and mark with derision
Your matches abandoned and drawn;
Your pitches of perfect precision;
Your outfield as smooth as a lawn;
Your leisurely midday beginnings;
Your pauses, Great Heavens! for tea;
Your totals knocked up in an innings
Which we could not equal in three.
But little of mowing and rolling
Made ready the wicket we loved,
Yet we feared not the swiftest of bowling,
But hit it unpadded, ungloved.
We laugh at good length-balls deflected
With bats horizontal; we groan
When half-volleys pass wholly neglected,
And long-hops left blandly alone.
Straight bats to straight balls we pre-
sented,
Not legs, in defence of our sticks;
The loose ones we were not contented
To look at, we hit them for six.
You think that your bowlers are 'cuter
Than ours, with their leg-breaks and
swerves,
But one deadly old-fashioned "shooter"
Would shatter your stumps and your
nerves.
Play the game for itself, as we played it,
And not for the money you make:
Gates, boundaries, records, degrade it;
Your picnics are all a mistake!
Play the game, in a spirit more sporting,
For your side, not yourself, or the
Press;
Ix?t onlookers do the reporting.
And think of your average less.
So then when, the last over ended,
You quit your terrestrial sphere,
You haply may find yourself blended
With the true "Band of Brothers " up
here,
Where we play, in the field, at the
wicket,
By one common jealousy bound,
For the honour and glory of Cricket,
And " The Asphodel C. C. and Ground."

OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday, July 1.—We open the operatic month with our
ever-young favourite the immortal Don Giovanni. As good
a cast as ordinarily you could wish to see. Mile. DESTIXN is
a distinguished Donna Anna, and Miss A ONES NICHOLAS is the
other fateful person, Donna Elvira. Signor C'.\nrso appears
as their melancholy companion, Don Ottavio, personally con-
ducting the two injured females. He finds his compensation
in the concerted pieces, and in his DaUa sun pace, sometimes
omitted, but now given with admirable effect, and in 11 mio
tesoro.
Mile. DONALDA is a sprightly Zcrlina, and M. GILIBERT the
traditional old loutish Mazetto.
M. JOORXET is as good a Leporello as the stupid old
traditions of the Opera allow him to be. Was there ever such
absurdity as the "business" of the scene where Leporello is
supposed to disguise himself as Don, Giovanni, and Don
Giovanni to play the part of
Leporello? How can it be for
one moment possible that a
lady, deeply in love with the
seductive Don, could ever mis-
take the low-comic servant for
the high-comedy master, espe-
cially as the servant makes no
sort of attempt at concealing
his face, and only a partially
successful effort to simulate?
his master's tone of voice?
This traditional stage business
is too childish, as also is the
pantomimic " tliwackings," as
GEORGE MEREDITH, O.M., would
style them, with which the
Don, armed with an old pro-
perty padded stick, belabours
Mazetto. Why does not. stage
manager M. ALMAREZ step in
and reform it altogether?
The Don must evidently
have a giant's strength to pro-
duce from the strings of his
guitar such a fortissimo tone
as almost to drown his own
sweetly-sung melody. The
coster's concertina might as
well be substituted for the
stringed instrument. M. AXPRI':
MEFSAGER could rectify* this.
dramatic; but, as to the music, except for one duet between
Ah-Joe Mile. DOXALPA and San-Lui M. DALMORES, the opera
will not at present be robbed, by me at least, of any of its
melodies, as there was not one that, on a first hearing, I
could carry away with me.
Signor Scorn's villainous CiiK-Fen was repulsively
powerful. M. MARCOUX a calm, dignified and determined
Uin-Sci. Had the librettist been a trifle more lively he
would have changed the names and have adled the lover
Win-Shee and the pretty little Chinese girl (Mile. DOXALDA)
should have been Win-svm-Shee.
JjOracolo was preceded by Orpliec, with same cast as on
the previous occasion. Mile. QntTlUE-R&nns was the Urphee,
and on this her second appearance as the love-lorn musician,
or wandering minstrel, made a graceful concession to the
necessary masculinity of the character by cutting, not the
part, but the tunic, and artistically lessening its length by
perhaps an inch or so.

Euridice.— Mine. .Jeanne Raunav.
Lovely old-world opera is this of
GLUCK'S, first produced in
1762. The librettist, M.
MOLIXE, was very tender-
hearted. He could not bear
the separation of the lovers,
and so lie introduced Master
Cupid, T.'ho restores Evridice
to life, and off go Orplu-e
and his bride in a boat,
without a return ticket,
being bound for Paphos,
where, as they have already-
received a marriage license
from Hymen, they may be pre-
sumed to have lived happily
on love ever afterwards. This
of course is not according
to the ancient legend which
shows the travelling musician
ultimately killed by enraged
persons who hacked him to
bits,—critics, probably,--and
threw his head, after he
had lost it, into the river.
Messrs. GLIJCK and MOUSE
took a livelier view of the
story, and sent away their
audience rejoicing in the
happiness of the mythical
heroine and hero.
We dnesday. — Romeo et
Juliette. Mile. DOXALDA as
Monday, July 3.—The new opera UOracolo, of which my dis-
tinguished Musical and Artistic Deputy expressed his opinion
last week, I have now seen on its second performance. I agree
with him to a certain extent, but should like to hear it twice
before positively asserting that it is only a bizarre work, not
for a moment to be placed in the same rank with Pagliaeci
and Car-oiler la Rusticana, though here and there, as it seems
to me, it is pleasantly reminiscent of both. L'Oracolo is a
better title tlian that of the original piny, The Cat and the
Cherub. The word "cherub" is associated with pictures
by the old masters representing sacred subjects, and the
association of the cruel cat with one of these angelic beings
in an irreverent story of, I believe, American origin; so that it
was certainly a happy thought on the part of the adapting
librettist, bearing the Bulwer-Lyttonish-romanesque name of
ZANOXI, to substitute for it The, Oracle. A more fitting title,
on the same lines, for the original tragedy, would have been
either The Wolf and the lambkin, or The Fox and the
Gosling. It is not only most effectively placed on the stage,
but excellently acted as well as sung. The action is strikingly
the sweet Juliette sang and acted well. Great applause from
appreciative audience. M. DALMORES as Romeo, apparently
a bit fatigued at first, was a trifle flat, but when "with love's
light wings" he had to "o'erperch the wall" and climb
up to Juliette's balcony, he rose to both occasions and thence-
forth sang, as he acted, excellently. Whenever I see this
scene of ''scaling the walls "—this opera ought never to be
out of the bills at IM Scala,—I am reminded of an absurd
couplet that used to be said by the inimitable " Little KEF.LEY"
in a burlesque on The Alhambm :-
"With love's light wings I did o'erperch these walls,
I fear with serious damage to my smalls."
And I tremble for the trim and tightly-clad figure of the
"climbing boy" Romeo. Miss E. PARKINA is a charming
Stephana, one of the most brilliant pages in Operatic history,
but on this occasion, after beginning well, she unfortunately
missed "Sister Jane's top note" at the end of her song.
The house was applaudingly sympathetic. As Nurse Gertrude
Mine. PAULIN seemed rather hard, but how can it be otherwise,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT is evident, so my Baronite thinks, that Tlie Hill (JoHN
MURRAY) would not have been written had Torn Broirn's
Schooldays never been recorded. Mr. VACHELL attempts to
do for Harrow what Mr. HIT.HES did for Rugby. My Baronite
notes a fundamental difference in the achievement. Tom
Broirn and his schoolfellows were live lads of flesh and blood,
brain and muscle. Mr. VACHKLL'S Harrovians are types,
puppets elaborately dressed and considerately labelled. The
difference may be briefly stated; but it is vital.
In Kdward Fitzycmld, the latest addition to the Macmillau
series of English Men of Letters, Mr. A. C. BENSON lias done
something more than present a study of the literary work of
tlie adapter of O.MAR KHAYYAM. He enables the reader to see
and know in the flesh the "lonely, shy, kind-hearted man"
whom even CARI.YI.E, with such capacity in that direction as
he possessed, loved. We see him as he lived and worked;
a slovenly-dressed man of strange habits, finding in later life
a choice companion in POSH, a sailor whose acquaintance he
made at Lowestoft. "A gentleman of nature's grandest
type," FITZGERALD ecstatically wrote about his man. POSH,
alack! was prone to drink more than satisfied OMAR KHAYYAM
when he sat beneath his tree in the desert. On one occasion,
having made the most of the good things provided at his
master's house, he lay full length on the sofa. Another
visitor, not of the same type, thought this was going a little
too far. "Poor fellow," said FITZGERALD, ''look how tired he
is!" Here is a -vivid word-picture of FITZGERALD himself:
"With straggling grey hair, slovenly in dress, wearing an
ancient, battered, black-banded, shiny-edged, tall hat, round
which he would in windy weather tie a handkerchief to keep
it in its place. His clothes of baggy blue cloth, his trousers
short, and his shoes low, exhibiting a length of white or
grey stockings. In hot weather walking barefoot with his
boots slung to a stick." Such was FITZGERALD at sixty. But
the man who translated OMAR KHAYYAM might surely dress as he
pleased. My Baronite, having read Mr. BENSON'S book, seems
to have known in the flesh this half mad, altogether lovable
man.
Having endowed the world with a six-volume set of Mr.
SWINBURNE'S collected poems, Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDUS
propose to add to it the treasure of a corresponding Library
edition of his tragedies. The issue will be complete in five
volumes, of which the first, containing the "Queen Mother"
and "Rosamond," is just out. Of these works there is
nothing new to be said. It suffices to note that the ne^r
series is as beautifully printed and daintily bound as was
its predecessor. The work is affectionately inscribed to
DANTE CrAnnm. ROSSETTI.
Canon SHEEHAN, with his intimate knowledge of Irish
peasant life arid character, his strong sympathy with their
wrongs, his keen appreciation of their Immoiir, writes this
novel Glenanaar (LONGMANS, GREEN & Co.) not only with an
earnestness of purpose that deeply impresses tlie reader, but
with a fascination of style that rivets the attention. Romance
though this story may be, it conveys the idea of the personal
presence of the author in the scenes he so graphically describes.
Romance indeed it is, but Romance founded on historic facts,
as were the novels of Sir WALTER SCOTT. Awful is the true
story ('anon SIIKEHAN tells us of the distressful country in the
early part of the nineteenth century, when DAN O'CoNNEi.i.
was "The Liberator" of the Irish people; a time when, as
tlie author says, "it was the Red Terror again transplanted
from the Seine to the I^ee." It was the hour of the
"Approver," of whose black deeds no honest Englishman
could approve, and of the False Witness, the temporary
triumph of the "Informer," against receiving whose evidence
Chief Justice O'GiuDY carefully warned the Grand Jury.
The scenes in Court as here given by Canon SHEEHAN are of
absorbing interest and strikingly dramatic. Nothing more
powerful in any recent novel has been written than our
author's description of the ride for life undertaken by the
poor brother of the man about to be put on his trial, and of
tlie bringing back with him of the "Counsellor" who was to
be victorious over the Solicitor-General and subsequently to
indict him, though unsuccess-
fully, in the House, for suppress-
ing certain facts in the case.
The Baron can heartily recom-
mend this moving story to
all lovers of gcx)d literature, and
more especially to those among
them who, having no personal
knowledge of the Irish in their
own country, may be acquainted
with only the farcically humorous
side of their character as repre-
sented in theamusing Anglo-Irish
novels of CHARLES LEVER.

INWARD BEAUTY.
[It appears that the fifty American ladies who are over here at the
charges of a Cincinnati paper bitterly resent the rumour that they were
selected on the score of external beauty. A Daily Mail rejxirter
describes them as possessing, among other remarkable features, the
gift of "lightning-like comprehension and a sense of humour."]
WHEN you, AMELIA, trampled on my breast,
And promised to regard me as a brother,
And went—before my wound had convalesce;!—
Out of your way, I thought, to wed Another,
I was too sore to see
How bountiful the gods had Ijeen to me.
But now that I have had my fevered brain
Cured of its hurt by Time's reducing blister
I can employ the language, bald and plain,
Which one adopts in dealing with a sister;
I can be almost rude
In analysing what I lately wooed.
For lo! your grace of feature, fairly Greek
(Save for the nose—admittedly retrousse.),
Your eye of Eau de Nil, your cherry cheek,
Your cherelure, so like a shock of loose hay,
Leave me no longer blind
To your profound deficiencies of mind.
Compare yourself with yonder female swarm,
Sent here to boom a Cincinnati paper;
Think you they take a pride in outward form,
Red lips, and waxen skin, and waists that taper?
No, they are up in arms
If you impute to them such paltry charms.
On nobler gifts their claim has been reposed —
Graces of mind! Of such I wisli to mention
One that the Mall's reporter diagnosed,
Namely, a rapid power of comprehension,
Which, when he made a joke,
Leapt on it like the sudden levin's stroke.
AMELIA, are you moved by that report?
/ am: I recognise down what abysses
I should have stumbled, but you stopped me short,
That day when you declined to be my Missis;
Had you endorsed my plan
I should by now have been a blighted man.
I do not often jest (not by design),
But when I do it, as a special favour,
And it is like a jewel flung to swine,
And nobody discerns its subtle flavour,—
Then for a time, I own
That I mislay my suavity of tone.
But, if I played my wit before my wife
And the effect consistently miscarrie:!,
I fear it might curtail our wedded life,
And therefore I am glad we are not married,
For never yet, I know,
Have you perceived the simplest jeu de mot. 0. S.

THE CHARM OF THE CHARMER.
INTERVIEW WITH THE BEAUTIFUL Miss ETHELWYNNE L'ESTIUXGE.
(With acknowledgments to xuch papers as require them.)
IT was at the Premier Theatre during the interval that our
Interviewer sought out Miss ETHELWYNNE L' ESTRANGE, the
charming lady who is to create the rule of the heroine in Little
Dulcie when that diverting and altogether delightful musical
medley of mirth and merriness goes to America in the autumn.
Miss L'EsTRAXGE was just finishing a rehearsal when our Inter-
viewer first saw her.
"Yes," said Miss L'ESTIUMOE, with a sweet little giggle,
"yes, it's simply delicious, my new part. I just lore it. I
hope my friends in America will."
Our Interviewer assured her that they could not fail to do
so. (Our Interviewer has no conscience to speak of.)
"Oh!" she gurgled, "really? That is sweet of you.
But, do you know, I feel dreadfully nervous."
"Lor !" said our Representative, who remembered witness-
ing a performance of the lady.
"And then," continued Miss L'ESTRANGE, "it is so horrid
to leave London. You are such dears over here, you 're
positively heavenly."
"On behalf of England I tender gratitude and illimitable
thanks for the unsolicited and unmerited testimonial," said
Mr. Punch's plenipotentiary, unblushingly.
"Oh !" she said, "that's lovely." Then she sighed.
Perhaps it was the heat. Or she, too, may have had a
conscience.
"But tell me," said the worthy upholder of our literary
dignity, possibly wishing for a change in the subject of
conversation, "tell me about yourself."
"Oh," she said with a girlish simper, "actresses don't like
telling people about themselves. I never do it."
The guardian of our interests gasped slightly for breath
and bowed. "I know," said he, "that such is not your
custom,"—lie was fairly expert, don't you think?—" but won't
you j ust for once break the rule and let readers of Punch have
the first opportunity for at least three days past of hearing
your views?"
Miss L'ESTRANGE pouted prettily.
"If I must, I must," she remarked resignedly. (One cannot
dispute the profundity of this conclusion.) "What do you
wish to know?"
"Firstly," said he for whom the angels must weep, "what
advice do you give to the stage-struck?" (This was quite
an original question to put to an actress.)
"My advice," said Miss L'EsTRANGE decisively, "is most
strongly against their doing anything whatever to place them-
selves among the weekly features of the Sketch."
"Life on the stage, then, is not all nectar and ninepins?"
queried our Innocent One unabashed.
"No," said Mi5s L'EsTRAN'OE, "indeed it is not. It is as
much as some of us can do to appear in the supplements once
a fortnight. What chance, then, has the youthful actress of
gaining an entree to the Sketch's exclusive pages?"
"None," was the murmured reply.
"Besides," said Miss L'ESTRANGE laughingly, "there's the
work. Many foolish people think that the stage is all play.
They forget the drudgery of being always charming, of having
to graciously grant interviews to foolish journalists, to—oh!
I 'in awfully sorry. I didn't mean to be rude."
"It is nothing," sighed our faithful ally, "I can quite
appreciate your feelings. Then your advice" is not to go on
the stage?"
"That is my disinterested advice," she said thoughtfully.
"I and some others have been successful and"
"You want to keep all the soft jobs to yourselves," said
our Representative exultingly. And so fled.

THE Zoo.
WHEN April dries the ready tear,
And greets the world with smiling air;
When, in a word, the weather's clear,
And I 've an afternoon to spare,
I love to spend an hour or two
Observing Nature at the Zoo.
It lends the intellectual mind
A wider speculative range,
To see on every side confined
Wild creatures, wonderful and strange,
Each, as Professor DARWIN proved,
Man's cousin once or twice removed.
Touched by some antic that betrays
The beasts' affinity to man,
One visitor will hymn the praise
Of Nature's well perfected plan,
Another urge in jocund tones,
Similitudes to BHOWN or JONES.
I have remarked a stoutish gent
Observing to the Chimpanzee,
"But for a natural accident
I had been you, my friend, you me."
The ape, unskilled in fancy's flights,
Pursued the search for parasites.
Myself, I own, am not infused
With proper scientific awe;
I simply go to be amused,
To heave the well-provoked guffaw
At the unconscious but absurd
Appearance of some beast or bird.
Armed with a bag of cast-off buns
I roam from cage to cage at will,
And offer tit-bits to the ones
I like, and those I don't get nil;
And that profound but testy wag,
The Dromedary, gets the bag.
I love to watch the restless run,
The look of anxious unconcern,
With which the captive next but one
Impatiently awaits his turn;
Just such a look as Counsel wears
When briefs are eoming up the stairs.
I rather like the Hartebeest,
He wears a melancholy air,
A countenance sublimely tristc,
As one who finds the world a snare;
And yet the creature seems imbued
With quite aii appetite for food!
I 'm fond of Jack, the Piping Crow,
His sense of humour never fails;
You '11 see him any time you go
Pulling the parrots by their tails,
Or gnawing with consummate joy
Some too demonstrative small boy.
Another favourite of mine 's
The Hippopotamus, a beast
Of solid parts, who when he dines
Consumes a stack of hay at least;
He seems to take an obvious pride
In having so much room inside.
But there, one has so many friends
Alike in feather and in fur,
Some that perform for private ends,
And some when sixpences occur,
That one might warble on for aye,
And still have several things to say.
AtQOL.
THE risks of dining just before a rail-
way journey are insufficiently appre-
ciated. Had the gentleman mentioned in

food at the time of the accident, it is
awful to think what his fate might have
been. "At Cannon Street," says the
Weekly Dispatch, "a passenger aud a
goods train collided. The former was
fortunately empty, and there were no
injuries."

"LIFE BELOW STAIRS."'
Edited by iMdy Faith.
[Being specimen pages of :i rival organ to
Lady HOPE'S new periodical for servants, The
Hoine. Club Magazine.]
Editorial.
AT a time when every class has its
well-conducted organ, why should ser-
vants be left out in the cold? It is this
thought, dear friends, which has led me
t'> devote days and nights and weeks to
the preparation of a periodical entirely
for yourselves. Hitherto you have had
to read the ordinary magazines and
papers containing such uncongenial
matter as stories and novelettes; but
henceforward you will have reading
more to your taste. Life Below Stairs
will be published every week, price two-
pence. Everyone can afford twopence.
It is true that most papers now are only
a halfpenny or a penny; but think what
large tips you get (when the mistress
does not—as I am told she too often
does—intercept the coin), und how few
your expenses are—no rent, no board
and lodging, no washing, no rates and
taxes. Some of you also have beer
money; which seldom falls to your
employers. Do not then grudge two-
pence for Life Brloir Stairs.
I am promised the best and most
generous co-operation. Mr. MONTAGU
HOLBEIN will write in an early number
on "Channel Swimming for Domestic
Servants"; Mr. FREDERIC HARRISON will
review Mr. GLADSTONE'S work on Studies
subsidiary to the Art of Butler; Lady
WARWICK will write on "Socialism in
the Servants' Hall"; Mr. JAMES DOUGLAS
on "Mr. WATTS-DL'NTON'S Message to
Lady's - maids"; Mr. CHESTERTON on
"Servants our true Masters "; and there
will be a poem in an early number by
Mr. HAMILTON AIDE entitled "The Tip."
I am hopeful also of inducing Mr. SWIN-
BURNE to contribute a serial novel in the
form of letters.

My Valets.
BY HAI.L (,'AINE.
In the first place I should like to say
at once I was a hero to all of them.
They left me only to better themselves
by becoming literary agents, &c.
A good valet is not to be met with
every day. He needs to have a
number of qualities that are very rare.
Personally I do not require my valet to
shave me,^ having adhered to a beard
for some years, and being unwilling now
to change an appearance that is not
unfamiliar to my warm-hearted friends,
the Great British Public; but a know-
ledge of shaving is very important. A
valet should alsj understand fixing
sheets of manuscript together; repairing
castle chimneys when they smoke; and
the principles of photography.

How to Give Notice.
A SYMPOSIUM.
[So much difference of opinion seems to pre-
vail as to this important duty that we have
asked a number of representative servants to
give us their views.—ED.]
Miss ELIZA GREEN writes : —" I always
says to them, 'Then I beg to give a
month,' quite polite, although not
haughty. If they takes it in the spirit
in which it was given, well and good;
but if they are nasty I can be nasty too,
I give you my word."
Miss SARAH TO.MPSETT writes:—"The
great thing is to give notice first, before
you get it; and this means that you
must be very quick. Yoti have to learn
the missis's eye. The first thing I do
when they come into the kitchen is to
steal a glance at their eye and act ac-
cording. If it looks like mischief, I
just fold my hands and say, 'I wish to
leave as my health won't stand it.' 'I
am very glad,' they says, 'as I was just
going to give you notice myself.' But
I wax first. I always am."
Miss HEMILY TANTRUMS writes:—"How
one gives notice does not matter very
much, but when is important. 1 always
like to catch them when they are happy,
and burst it on them then. The young
ones cry."
Rules for Waiting in England.
BY WILLIAM COCKIIF.AD.
1. Never anticipate a want. Make the
customer ask in turn for everything he
requires.
2. Always say, "Coming, Sir."
3. Remember that all wine should be
shaken before taken.
4. Keep on saying, "Coming, Sir."
5. Do not say "Thank you" for your
tip if you don't think it large enough.
6. Never ask yourself what you are
tipped for.

Areas I Hava Explored.
BY SKRGK&NT ROBERT KITCHENER.
There is not, I suppose, any man
living who has descended single-handed
and at night into so many areas as I
have. Never during my thirty years as
a constable have I been daunted by the
depth and darkness of these subterranean
retreats. Hungry, cold, ay, and thirsty,
I have not been deterred; I have gone
down just the same, or with even more
courage and purpose.
I remember the first time I adventured.
I thought I heard a cry of distress and
instantly was on my way down the
perilous and unlit steps. I peered
through a chink in the shutters, and
there I saw a fat cook struggling with
a cold meat pie. At one time the pie
seemed to be having the best of it; at
another, the cook. To enter the kitchen
and come to her assistance was the work
of a moment, and in a few minutes I
had tli3 pie well under and in safe
custody.

TO A STOUT SHEPHERDESS.
[Watteau, at the present moment, is the only
n-ear, but we should like to remind a certain
class of modish people that it is becoming only

DEAR lady, are you open to a hint
As down our sober pavement you dis-
play
A costume reminiscent of a print
Of Valenciennes and shepherdesses
gay?
When WATTEAU, master of Rococo art.
Depicted nymphs in pastoral disguises,
His cunning pencil only could impart
A charm to graceful shapes and slen-
der sizes.
That saucy Watteau hat where rosebuds
twine
Is not the sort a florid dame should
wear,
Although tip-tilted at the proper line
Upon your own, or someone else's,
hair.
Those panniers of Pompadour brocade,
That scanty skirt, although no doubt
de riguewr,
That corsage laced, with ruffles overlaid,
Are not, I think, intended for your
figure.
Go home, dear lady, lay your gauds aside,
Afflict no more your feet with Louis
heels,
Wear ample garments flowing full and
wide-
Take my advice, and see how nice it
feels.
Accommodate your features with a veil,
And let your hat be quietly trimmed
and shady:
Then, though as shepherdess vou frankly
fail,
You may be more successful as a lady.

METHOD OF SHAVING.—" Try our Soap.
A Boon to those who shave themselves.

THE HERO AND HIS PRICE.
[The Globe suggests that, owing to the iiii'on-
veuience caused by the difficulty of hitting
upon a suitable reward for one's rescuer when
one is saved from death or accident, there
should be a scale of payment for heroes.]
IN Mr. Justice MOTLEY'S court yester-
day, JOBS SMITH, describing himself as a
hero, claimed the sum of fifteen shillings
from THOMAS Biitnvs" as payment for
services rendered on the 16th ult. Mr.
ROBINSON, K.C., counsel for the plaintiff,
briefly set forth the fac's of the case.
On the afternoon of the day in question the
plaintiff, who was a well-known rescuer,
was walking by the River Thames near
Henley, when he observed defendant
struggling in the water. He proceeded
to dive in and bring him safely to shore.
On plaintiff's demanding the usual fee
(fifteen shillings and a cigarette) de-
fendant had refused to admit his claim.
It was more in the interest of his pro-
fession than for personal reasons that
plaintiff, who was a wealthy man, had
brought the action. If rescued men
were to be allowed to evade their
obligations in this manner, the profes-
sion of rescuing could not continue, and
hundreds of deserving workers would
be thrown into the ranks of the un-
employed.
Examined by Mr. JONES, K.C., counsel
for the defence, Mr. JOHN SMITH said that
it was quite true that he was a wealthy
man. He had been a hero for some years.
Mr. Jones. And it is a well-paid
profession?
The Plaintiff. Not ill-paid. For an
ordinary' rescue—that is to say, if the
rescuer is in his ordinary clothes—fifteen
shillings is the reward. If he is in his
Sunday clothes, the fee is higher. Thus,
if he dives in to save a man with his
frock-coat on and wearing patent-leather
boots he receives a guinea and an invita-
tion to High Tea, naming his own day.
But if he happens to he wearing brown
boots with his frock-coat, the invitation
to High Tea is not enforced. In the
eyes of the law, patent-leathers are more
costly than brown boots.
Mr. Justice Motley. What boots it?

Mr. Jones. On this occasion how were

it is a case of look out and hook out, eh?

man's while. Amateur heroes do it, I
believe; but while the rate of payment
is only seventeen-and-six per half-dozen
no professional will touch them.
The defendant then entered the box.
Mr. Jones. Is it true, Mr. Buowx, that
on the afternoon of the 16th of last month
the plaintiff pulled you out of the river?
The Defendant. Yes, confound him!
Mr. Justice Motley. He found you.

Mr. Jones. Why are you annoyed?
The Defendant. Well, I was just
beginning a bathe. I'd been looking
forward to it all day. And no sooner
had I got in than this fellow drags me
out, making me swallow pints of water
on the way.
Mr. Jones. You did not need his
services?
Tlie Defendant. Not a bit.
Mr. Jones. The plaintiff asserts thnt
you were in obvious distress. He says
you were splashing violently.
The Defendant. I was practising the
Trudgeon stroke.
Mr. Jones. You were not sinking?
The Defendant. Not a bit of it.
Mr. Justice Motley. You can take a
man to the water, but you can't make
him sink.

FIVE O'CLOCK IN OLYMPUS.
OXE day, not so very long ago, the weather was hot in
Olympus. Jupiter had done a good morning's exercise with
his thunderbolts, and had afterwards amused himself by
throwing off a few stray famines and pestilences from his
stock of these commodities. He had then eaten a heavy
mid-day meal and was now reclining in an exhausted condition
and the shade of a crag. The other gods, too, had done their
various duties and were tired. So were the goddesses.
"Bring me," said the King of gods, addressing the fair Hebe,
"a jug of nectar, the '92, mind you, and—but no, I 'in tired
of nectar. Bring me something else. I want a new drink."
"We haven't got a new drink," said Hebe, who allowed
herself a certain liberty in conversation with Jupiter.
"No new drink?" said Jupiter petulantly. "No new
drink? And I suppose I'm not a god, and I couldn't wipe
the whole lot of you out by nodding my head? Upon my
word, I 'm disposed to do it right now"- -Jupiter had picked up |
a few modern expressions from a recent importation of assistant"'
Hebes who talked through their pretty little noses—"I guess |
I'm tired of nectar anyway," he continued, "and that's all
there is to it."
"Was there ever so unreasonable a creature? " whispered
Juno very audibly.
"If I 'm to be thwarted like this — "began her husband
fiercely.
"Is anybody thwarting Jupiter?" asked the Queen
blandly. "I've often told you all he's not to be thwarted.
It simply ruins his temper."
Jupiter glared round the circle, but nobody answered.
"Mercury!" he suddenly shouted. The messenger ap-
proached with evident reluctance.
"Put on your wings at once and go below and bring me
back something to drink."
"I can't spare the boy this afternoon," cried Juno. "He's
got to
But Mercury w.as already gone.
First he dropped down in Germany, and he saw the whole
population drinking beer.
"It's no good for Jupiter," he said. "He's putting on
weight too fast as it is."
So he gave a leap, and in a moment he was in New York
in a fashionable club.
"Waiter," said one of the memlxTS, "take the orders."
The cocktails shortly afterwards appeared on a tray, and
Mercury drank a Martini.
"This," he said, "isn't bad, but poor old Jupiter couldn't
do with it. He 'd want to drink it out of a long glass, and
that might ruin us all."
So he leaped again and found himself in Paris, where a
smart gai\on brought him an absinthe. He drank it.
"Absinthes," he murmured, "make the heart grow fonder.
I wonder who said that. Jupiter's quite fond enough as it
is. We really couldn't stand any more scandals."
So he leaped again and dropped in a London club.
A tall stout gentleman with a long grey beard was sitting
on three illustrated papers and reading a fourth, while he
sipped sometliing hot out of a cup. Five other tall stout gentle-
men with long grey beards were looking at him angrily and
also sipping the same sort of something out of cups.
"They're the very image of old Jupiter," said Mercury.
"What suits them is sure to suit him."
So he ordered a consignment of urns and kettles and
teapots and cups and saucers and tea and milk and sugar
and buttered toast and lettuce sandwiches, and back he flew
to Olympus.
And that is how five-o'clock tea became a popular meal in
Olympus.
"My dear," said Juno shortly afterwards to Venus, "I
don't know what's come over Jupiter. He's got so tame and
mild these last few days that I 'd almost trust him to feed
out of my hand."
"Vulcan's just the same," said Venus. "I never saw
anyone so changed. Thank you. Two lumps, and just a
little cream."
A BIRTHDAY SONG.
THE morn ia bright, the skies are clear,
The lark awakes and Chanticleer
Explosively proclaims the anniversary
Of the glad day when I was born
This jolly world of ours t' adorn,
And be, I 'm told, a terror to the nursery.
There are to whom a birthday brings
The solemn thought that Youth has wings,
Who dream of Old Age closing in around them,
And weep to think that man must grow
Old at the age of so-and-so.
(My own contemporaries, too, confound them !)
And there be those whom such a date
Serves only to infuriate,
Who find existence void, and pleasure hollow;
"Why were we ever born?" they say,
And darkly curse their natal day
As the prime cause of all they have to swallow.
Myself, I do not hold with these.
This Vale of Tears has much to please
A merry soul; if Man be born to trouble,
The fact is neither here nor there;
If Life's the Bubble they declare.
It seems a very decent sort of bubble.
Nor do I, like my craven peers,
Confess to getting on in years
Just when the joys of life are fairly started,
And mourn for my departed Youth
Merely because I'm -no, forsooth !—
I don't acknowledge that it has departed.
True, that the carping eye may trace
Some lines on my engaging face,
But what of them? Their cause is very simple;
I've had them for a long, long while:
TJiese are the places where I smile,
And those—well, anyone can tell a dimple.
The polished argent of my crown
Has lost its growth of sheeny brown,
But many a head that's prematurely thinned owes
Its losses to the tropic hat.
You could not call me really fat;
Not fat (I know, from looking into windows).
But there, what boots the outer skin?
If jocund be the heart within
The rolling years affect one very lightly;
And a hilarious turn of mind—
That and my innocence combined—
Has kept me young and eminently sprightly.
Wherefore, 0 pious Morn, to Thee
Be greeting! And I hope to see
Many returns, both prosperous and pleasant.
And, ere the day has gained his height,
I will perform my 'customed rite,
And go and give myself a birthday present.

A BARE SUGGESTION.
(Foe tlie Hard-worked Dine>~-out.)
"THE less we wear, the more we can
eat," says a medical journal. This
epoch-making truth has already been
acted upon by the compilers of the up-
to-date and well-known "Etiquette for
Epicures." We beg leave to cull the
following excerpts from the very latest
edition of their gastronomic handbook:—
"If you are asked whether you like
to take salad undressed, proceed with
caution and be guided by what your
host or hostess does. It requires the
exercise of some little tact to know how
far to venture in the matter of sartorial
omission, and it is well therefore to wait
for a lead and temporise, if possible, by
a remark on the weather, until you have
discovered whether the undressing is
objective or subjective."
"The familiar postscript 'Don't dress
for dinner' appended to tinceremonial
invitations has now acquired a still
more hospitable meaning, and signifies
that the fare is unlimited, and there
will be no vexatious restrictions in the
nature of waistbands, etc."
"The term Remove on the modern
merni now serves a double purpose. At
this stage of the proceedings it acts as a
signal for general deghabillement. It is
not very good form to anticipate such a
direction unless undress has been
specially suggested in the invitation, in
which case a tennis shirt and continua-
tions will be sufficient."
"We do not recommend our readers
to attempt to improve upon the refined
example lately set them by an American
millionaire and dine in the water (of
course in University bathing costume)
instead of upon an artificially blue
lagoon. The newly-established Censor
of Banquets may have a word to
say. . . ."
"Altogether the subject of Mixed
Dinner Parties is rather a ticklish one
under present circumstances. There is,
indeed, a feeling which is gaining
strength, in favour of a reversion to the
old full-dress costume. It is certainly
more advisable for debutantes."

NOT quite three hundred miles from town,
Nor yet profaned by week-end trippers,
Beneath a ridge of rolling down
With velvet strands for infant dippers,
I 've found a holiday retreat
Adapted to a small exchequer,
Where the dyspeptic and effete
At once regain a healthy "pecker."
We only run to one hotel,
We have no chef, no German waiters,
And yet our host amazing well
For every taste and palate caters.
His wife 's a treasure who displays
A perfect genius for baking;
His wines are few, but merit praise,
And never set your temples aching.
The folk who haunt tliis favoured scene

Preserving a judicious mean
Betwixt the rowdy and the pensive.
Their stakes at Bridge are not too high
To lend themselves to punctual pay-

Their daughters do not occupy
The livelong day in change of raiment.
No social problems here perplex,
No scandals lead to comment scathing;
No raucous champions of the sex
Discuss the question of mixed bathing.

The front is void of pseudo-niggers;
To us quite equally absurd
Whole-1 loggers are and little-piggers.
Lapped in our lotus-eating ease,
Far from the bounding advertiser,
We dress exactly as we please,
And take no thought of CZAR or KAISER.
Nor does this list by any means
Exhaust the sum of our resources;
Golfers have here their choice of greens,
And both are highly sporting courses,
Where well-hit Haskells sweetly lie
Untrapped by scrapes of burrowing

Where sporting men for victory vie
And not for medals or for money.

the Division Lobbies with Scott-Montagu.
Habitues of either House grow case-
hardened; few set speeches, by whom-
soever delivered, affect their spirits,
much less their appetites. To-night a
cloud of depression, almost despair,
hung low over the red-cushioned benches
as BOBS, with level voice, unimpassioned
manner, lamented an Army reduced to
the minimum in number, inadequately
trained, with musketry practice hope-
lessly limited, lacking auxiliary forces
so organised as to form a sufficient and
efficient reserve.
Business done.—BOBS makes a few
remarks on the condition of the British
Army he has occasionally led in battle.
Tuesday niijht.-—Behind a boyish
manner SCOTT-MONTAGU hides a shrewd
business capacity. Knows a good open-
ing when he sees it; finds one in the
loss of time arising out of existing
system of taking votes. Reckons that
in a Session with its average of three
hundred divisions, each occupying a
quarter of an hour, bang go ten working
days in perambulating the lobbies.
Old ISAAC HOLDEN who, in his eighty-
fifth year, represented a Yorkshire divi-
sion, took note of the bearings before
SCOTT-MONTAGU left school. The sturdy
octogenarian lived on an apple or two
a day and, lest he should suffer from
the consequences of over-feeding, made
a practice of walking two miles every
night before going to bed. During the
recess he took his walk on the moors
adjoining his Yorkshire home. Through
the Session he combined necessary exer-
cise with public duty. Stepping the
division lobbies he found the length as
| nearly as possible two hundred yards.
Eight divisions at a single sitting (by
no means unusual when the Home Rule
Bill was in Committee) meant near
enough to a mile. Accordingly after
running up his score in the division
list he had only another mile to do on
his way home.
That is another story. What SCOTT-
MONTAGU perceives is opening for a brisk
motor-car business in the division lob-
bies. As soon as House is cleared for a
division the car would lie backed up to
door. Members crowding in would be
whisked down to other end and the car
back again in a jiffy for a fresh load.
Of course it would be a monopoly, with
profits according. All the same canny
ScoTT-MoNTAGU is for cheap fares; say a
penny, with bundles of tickets, thirteen
to the dozen, to be obtained in the
Whips' room at the price of a shilling.
C.-B. gravely shakes his head and
hopes the Government, who, what with
one thing and another, have sufficient
business on hand, will not encourage
the project. PRINCE ARTHUR evidently
attracted by it. As he says, ten days is
a period equal with that allotted to
Ministers for legislation. If, by the use
of means of expeditious transit, half the
time taken in walking through the
lobbies could be saved, it might be
utilised for Redistribution Resolutions,
or some trifle of that kind, for which, at
present, he can afford to give only a
couple of morning Sittings.
Nothing definite settled; but SCOTT-
MONTAGU is to be congratulated on having
made a good start.
Business done. — Aliens Bill run
through Committee by help of guillotine.
Friday night.—Mr. CALDWF.LI. has gone
x-week-ending with light heart. Pacing
the salubrious sands of Southend he may
reflect on the conspicuous service he
rendered the House of Commons on a
?ritical occasion. Of generous mind,
prompt to encourage budding genii s,
he has always been tender in his treat-
ment of PRINCE ARTHUR. Towards the
end of last session, when the Leader of
the House in response to invitation from
C.-B. set forth certain arrangements for
the disposal of accumulated business, he
rose and publicly expressed approval.
He almost hinted that he would hardly
have done better himself had he been in
his natural position on the Treasury
Bench.
On this later occasion his attitude was
minatory. The business arose out of
C.-B.'s springing upon PRINCE ARTHUR
the ghost of EDWARD GREY'S Resolution
of Censure on the Fiscal Question. It
was dead six weeks ago; thought it was
buried, and behold, without a premoni-
tory groan it reappears.
"I hear the right hon. gentleman's
reference to the motion with a shock of
surprise," murmured PRINCE ARTHUR.
Certainly cannot make room for it
now. Every hour up to August 12, on
or about which date prorogation must
take place if the heavens fall, appro-
priated. Happily there was a second
reading of the Appropriation Bill.
Members might talk at large on that,
and a division arising out of debate on
Ministerial attitude on Fiscal Question
would be equivalent to Vote of Cen-
sure.
Nothing else forthcoming, Opposition
reluctantly disposed to accept the
arrangement. Propounded by Leader
of the House, it must be in order. Mr.
CALDWELL knew better. A ruling from
the Chair had limited debate on second
reading of Appropriation Bill to subjects
arising out of money voted in Supply.
No public money yet voted in respect of
Fiscal controversy. The half sheet of
note-paper used at Manchester by PRINCE
ARTHUR was his private property. Ac-
cordingly discussion suggested could
not take place.
Members as usual laughed when they
heard Mr. CALDWELL'S argumentative
voice break in on PREMIER'S discourse.
But Mr. CALDWELL was right. He alone
in the crowded House spotted the flaw
in PRIKCE ARTHUR'S proposal.
Business done. — Scotch Education

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DICKENSIAN CARR-ACTORS.
(First and, temporarily, last niglit of " Oliver Twisl" at His Majesty's.)
AUTHOR first: actors afterwards, in order of merit. With,
his dramatic version of Olirer Ttcist, Mr. COJIYNS CAW has
achieved a signal success. Whether it was self-imposed or
suggested to him, Mr. CARR has cleverly accomplished the
task which, as every dramatist conversant with the old novel
is probably aware, presents to the modern playwright diffi-
culties that, at first sight, seem to be well-nigh insuperable.
The first "facer" is that the story is old-fashioned; and it
may be remembered that DICKENS himself, in later years, wished
he had the chance of re-writing or re-constructing it. The
plot is of the well-worn " transpontine "—as it used to be called
when the Surrey and " the Vic." existed—melodramatic type, in
which CHARLES DICKENS, though no one enjoyed its absurdities
more keenly than he did, actually revelled. The lost child,
the missing documents of the utmost importance—always
mentioned in a general way as "papers,"— the wicked uncle,
the babe in the wood, i.e., Olirer himself, the blood-and-
thunder situations, the comic relief,
the mild and virtuous heroine, the
wicked but repentant woman, are all
here—everyone of these and many
more out of the old melodramatic
store-house of the Early Victorian era.
With such commonplace material
for plot, to score so great a suc-
cess with a representative play-
going first - night audience as
did Mr. COMYNS CARD, is indeed a
genuine triumph for any dramatist.
It-must have been for Mr. CARR the
very dickens of a job. A better cast
for his piece it would have been no
easy matter to find to hand in any
London theatre. The success of the
premiere was undoubtedly scored by
Miss CONSTANCE COLLIER as Nance, and
by Mr. LYN HARDING as Bill 8ikes.
These two must be bracketed together.
Mr. CARR has artistically treated the
awful scene of the murder of Nance
by Bill Sikes. The crime is committed
out of sight, like the tortures in La
Tosca and the terrible scene that Mr.
WARNER so tlirillingly described as he
heard it through the telephone. Only
Fagin is on the stage, cowering, cowardly, and diabolically
vindictive. It was here that Mr. TREE was at his best, forcing
upon the hushed audience the unspeakable terror of the
scene.
Taken as a whole, however, Mr. TREE'S Fagm, on this first
night, was not what it will be after u few performances, when
his managerial nervousness will have passed off, and, being
perfect in his words, he will give full meaning to every
gesture, every look, and every line. Ultimately his Faijin
will rank with his Srentjali.
As we shall have to return to the piece on the resumption
of its run, "here break we off" for the present. But a few
words more. Miss HILDA TREVEI.YAN as Oliver is certainly the
"mealy-faced" boy, as Mr. HILTON, capitally playing Mr.
Grimicig, calls him, just as he is depicted by GEORGE
CRUIKSHANK in his illustrations to the novel. The improba-
bilities of the existence of such an Olirer are to be charged
to the original creation.
Were the monotonous idiotic laughing of Charles Bales
considerably toned down, and were the piece somewhat
relieved of the "comic relief" supposed (in keeping with the
Dickensian tradition) to be afforded by the capers and

eccentric "business" of The Dodyer and Chitling, and were
the Beadle and Mrs. Bumble (well rendered as both these minor
characters are by Mr. HAYNES and Miss KATE MILLS) omitted
altogether, the First Act would play closer and would be
over in forty minutes; whereas on Monday night it lasted,
rather wearisomely, for one hour. The "pruning-knife"
shoiild be freely used: but whether it be so or not, when
once the play has fairly started on its run, the great tragic
scenes of Sikes and Nance, and of Fat/in in the condemned
cell, will attract for months to come, and will live in the
memory of play-goers for a life-time.
But stay—one important character I have forgotten to
mention. Bill Sikes's dog, BulVs-Eye. Bull's-Ei/e was the
bright particular dog-star of this melting July night. It was,
we believe, his first appearance, and, therefore, he must te
dealt gently with; even Sikes was kind to him. Such a
clean, well-fed, gentlemanly, sweet-tempered wag-tail dog!
Evidently he has not yet learnt the art of "making-op."
Not a sulk, not a growl, not the slightest snarl in him,
and he set an excellent example—in being letter-perfect;
he attempted no "gag "; not a
word did he say that was not in his
part. But he was no more Sikes's
and DICKENS'S BuWn-Eye than is Mr.
Punch's Toby.
"OH DEAR! WHERE CAN
THE MOTOR BE?"
SIR,—I have perused with keen
interest the recent correspondence in
the Press on the subject of the high-
handed course pursued by Lord
WINDSOR in closing Hyde Park (which
His Lordship appears to imagine to
be Windsor Park) to those for whose
relaxation it was originally intended,
namely the Great Public, who, by
their industry, astuteness and in-
tegrity, have saved enough to pur-
chase themselves motor-cars.
Now, Sir, no one has hit upon the
compromise which, as it seems to
me, would absolutely fit the case.
Why not give the motorists a/1 they
want and more? Why not permit
them to propel their machines in
Hyde Park, and nowhere else? Let
them whirl as they will from Marble Arch to the Magazine,
from Achilles' Statue to Oxford Street, vying in perfume
with the flower-beds, while, beyond the Park railings, hum-
drum, pettifogging pedestrians may venture forth again into
the streets they used to love.
Under the proposed scheme, it would of course be im-
possible for the motorist to travel from his mansion to the new
Elysium in his machine. But the Knightsbridge Barracks,
the Albert Hall, Kensington Palace, and other suitable build-
ings might easily be converted into coach-houses and garages
in which the Cars of the Privileged (which association of
names is reminiscent of The Seats of the Mighty whether by
GILBERT PARKER or HYDE PARKER 1 forget) might be con-
veniently stored for the night.
Should motorists require the practice and excitement to
which they are accustomed in shaving past---or rollicking
over—the inadvertent young, the Park custodians could be
instructed occasionally to raid the various juvenile angling
clubs which frequent the banks of the Serpentine, and drive
their members across the track in any direction desired. "De
minimis non curat Lex." The Law doesn't bother about very
little children. Your obedient servant, SCOTT-CAPULET.

he represents the U.S. Consul at Nagasaki, who has to break
the sad news to Butterfly of her husband's marriage to an

as little bluntness as possible. He sang splendidly, he acted
capitally, and generally made matters as pleasant as possible
for the unfortunate Butterfly whose wings are thus so cruelly
clipped. Clever M. DUFRICHE as the Marriage Broker was
more than satisfactory. There are many minor characters
in the opera,—minor dramatically speaking and musically
singing,—and all found adequate representatives. It is
a sad story, a tragedy; we do not get many lively
''plots" nowadays,—"for 0, for 0 the hobby-horse is

glimpse of lightness conveyed to the scene in which a little

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Baron thought that in A Daughter of the Manse, by
SARAH TYTLER (Jon,v LONG), he had found a novel superior to
many, one indeed after his own heart. Alas! she was A
Daughter of the Manse but not a child of a Ro-mance, and
though during the greater part of the first hundred pages
there was much most delightful reading, principally of
artistically descriptive writing, and though "The Mystery of
Benji " suggested coming struggles and sensational complica-
tions, yet these hopes are never realised, and not even by the
employment of those faithful and experienced servitors, The
Skipper and his Boy, could the Baron's early aroused interest
in the story and its cliaracters be sustained or revived.
Other readers may have better luck.
Mr. JEROME'S Idle Ideas (HunsT A\D BJ.ACKETT) is an attrac-
tive title in this Indian-like summer season to anyone who
with time at his disposal is ut perfect liberty to lazy away an
afternoon recnbans sub tegmine fagi, or lounging in a boat
rocked occasionally by the swell of a swift launch or laborious
barge. Some of the "fugitive" pieces, as the Baron supposes
them to be, here collected in a volume, are sufficiently amus-
ing for the idle man, who, cradled as above imagined, will
not risk being upset by any overpowering outburst of irre-
pressibly Homeric laughter at such playfully amusing papers
as " Why don't he marry the girl ~?" and "Shmdd soldiers be
polite?" In "Are ire as interesting as ire think tee are?"-—
where the style is pleasingly reminiscent of a certain little
book entitled Happy Thoughts—the author mentions the late
Mr. CORNEY GRAIN as wearing an eyeglass. "CoRXEY fixed
his eyeglass and walked to the window." The Baron, who was
•on most intimate terms with " DICK" GRAIN from the time of
his first appearance in public up to the last, cannot recall any
time when he took to wearing an eyeglass. It certainly was
not characteristic of him.
IN A Lost Cause (JOHN LONG) its author, GUY THORNE,
writing as, apparently, a strong partisan of the ultra-
ritualistic party in the Church of England, depicts certain
types of clergymen belonging to that extreme section. As
to whether fact or fancy may predominate in these cleverly
and amusingly executed presentments, the Baron, being
unfamiliar with the specimens in actual life, is not competent
to decide. But he is able to aver, from his own personal
knowledge, that the specimen given by the author of the
broad-minded Vicar who, being inclined to recognise what
is essentially good in all schools of thought, is disgusted with
the nncharitableness of certain ky representatives of the
ultra-Protestant party in the English Church, is a picture,
drawn without exaggeration, that will recommend itself even
to those who may care little or nothing about such matters.
The author also satirically and amusingly depicts scenes in
the vie intime of the Low Church or Evangelical agitator,
with whose public methods, leading to " brawling " in church,
newspaper reports have long ago familiarised us. One
of these scenes, where the agitator and his son examine
a list of subscriptions to " the Cause," will probably recall to
many the signatures to a somewhat similar document that
Secretary GASHFORD read out aloud to his patron Lord GEORGE
GORDON, the crack-brained leader of the "No Popery" party.
The ordinary reader, unversed in the questions that agitate
the legally established Church of England, coming upon
allusions to and descriptions of the common practice taking
place within her pale of such rites and ceremonies as he had
innocently supposed to be distinctive of the Roman Catholic
Church, will rub his eyes and inquire, "Are there wisions
about?" As a novel A Lost Cause is meagre in plot and
lacking in powerful dramatic situations, except in the last
chapter, when, accompanied by a self-effacing ritualistic
nobleman, His Grace of Canterbury looms large on the scene,
and with an awful severity, far exceeding that of INGOIDSBY'S
Cardinal, who
"with a dignified look
Called for his candle, his bell, and his book,"
asserts his authority over the unhappy leader of "the Luther
League," who shrinks "from the terrible old man," and
"with shaking hands" takes from his pocket a bunch of
keys, which "lie dropped from the floor"—presumably a
misprint for "on the floor." There is, by way probably
of concession to the unecclesiastical novel-reader, a slight
love interest which, commencing rather late in the story,
culminates in the marriage of the broad-minded (gradually
narrowing) Vicar Carr and Lucy Blantyre, who is described
as "pure but not virginal in temperament," and as one
"whose nature needed the complement of a husband." So
Lucy, with her G'arr, starts on the Honeymoon road to
happiness, a goal which it may be hoped the united couple
ultimately reached in perfect safety without so pressing the
pace as to call for police interference. We do not have many
specially clerical novels nowa-
days, and, though this cannot be
mentioned in the same breath
with TROLIOPE'S dew old Bar-
chester Towers, yet, as being
brightly written, and, if a true
picture of certain very modern
ultra-ritualistic Anglican clergy,
certainly instructive, the Baron
thinks he may venture to recom-
mend it to those among his fol-
lowers for whom the sensational
romance, or the purely sporting
novel, offers little attraction.

nuplumbed, salt,
estranging sea," it
had been called by
the poet; but for
him, the speaker, it
was an agreeable
element, admirably
constituted to buoy
up vessels loaded
with lawn tennis
experts. (Loud ap-
plause.) I«iwn ten-
nis was a game
(cheers) not only of
skill but of endur-
ance and j udgment.
It brought out a
man's qualities.
Yes, and a woman's,
too. (Hear, hear.)
"0 woman, in thy
hours of ease, how
much do tennis
meetings please,"
as the poet said.
In his Lordship's
young days archery
was in fashion and
then came croquet:
hence, perhaps, his
comparative unfam-
iliarity with lawn
tennis, which he
could not learn un-
til he had reached
middle age and
had been badly
stung so often that
the nicety of his
touch was impaired.'
He could not per-;
sonally consider that
compensated for the loss of the
and arrow (Oh! Oh .'), but it
doubtless a useful substitute. In his
hot youth his Lordship had frequently
scored a bull's-eye; so much so that his
nickname in the smart set of that day
was Cupid. His was "argent archery"
indeed, as the poet says. How different
from this patting of india-rubber balls
over a net, or rather into a net, which
was his usual fate.
[Prolonged disturbance, in the course
of which RISELEY and SMITH com-
pletely disappeared.
Resuming, his Lordship quoted two
stanzas from one of Dr. WATTS'S hymns
as an indication that his remarks were
meant in no bellicose spirit ; and, com-
plete serenity having returned to the
meeting, he roused much enthusiasm by
offering, just by way of proving his
respect for the game, to enter for the

Urchin Chauffeur (reading notice). "It AIN'T NO USE, 'ONORIA.
MOTORS AIN'T ADMITTED!"
the racket
bow
Championship next year in the Veterans'
class, with a plentiful supply of bisques.
Being, however, nothing if not critical,
ae the poet said, his Lordship remarked
that he might say a little with regard to
the terminology of the pastime, which
was, in his opinion, significant of much.
Each game began with love. All! A
player who failed to score was said to
have only love, against his opponent's
15, 30, 40, and victory. Beautiful is it
to score, to win; but not less beautiful
to retain love. As the poets had said
in their legions, and with an unanimous
voice, "Love is enough " ; and yet, sweet
as it was to hear the word amid the dis-
tractions of the tennis court, his Lordship
felt that a revised terminology was not
undesirable. Why "love?" Why not
"naught?" or even "nothing?" He
begged to make these suggestions to
the controlling body, wherever it was.
It was not fitting that any opportu-
- nity should be given
to the mocker or to
the casuist. It was
unfortunate that to
the question," What
is better than love?"
the answer could—
and truthfully, too
—be returned: "15
is, and 30 is, and 40
is, and game is."
Nothing really is
better than love,
and this was mere
word-splitting, and
yet his Lordship
fancied that he saw
danger there.
[Sensation, during
w hich Miss
SUTTON, the
American cham-
pion, fainted.
His Lordship, re-
suming after some
agitated moments,
next turned to the
materials of the
game. The balls. He
was always greatly
attracted by these
white and restless
spheres. He liked
to think that they
always wore flannel,
for he always wore
flannel himself.even
in summer, and it
gave him a sympa-
thetic feeling for a
tennis ball. Like
them he found it
far safer in the vari-
able climate of this
"tightlittle island,"
this " precious stone
set in a silver sea."
Why the poet called the sea "silver" he
could not determine, for to his eyes it
was usually green, blue, purple or grey;
but kSiiAKSPEARE had the support of the
Daily Telegraph in his choice of epithet,
and silver after all was a pretty word.
His Lordship, however, would not sup-
port a silver basis of coinage.
[Riots, concluded only by the ejection
of one DOHERTY, BROOKES, and an
assortment of twins, which liouecer
involved so much effort that the
speeches then terminated.

A TONIC FOR THE DUMPS.
["The difficulty in the photograph post-card business is to find new
ideas. The public is tiring of the laughing girls. The demand is for
the pensive, the soulful, and the spirituelle."—London Magazine.]
WHEN in my walks abroad, a sombre bard,
I sampled Beauties, unimpaired by age,
Perpetuating on a postal card
The stolid giggle hallowed by the Stage;
When I observed the lips that gaped apart,
The boon expanse of teeth, the dimpled chin,
(Proof of the rapture they derived from Art)—
0! how I grudged them that perennial grin!
"Nightly," I said, "they play their lyric scene,
And wag their legs about, and wear a smile,
And even when they 've washed their faces clean
It won't come off: they wear it all the while.
"I couldn't do it. Though I had the wit
To hum in tights beneath a picture hat,
Or wave my petticoats to thrill the pit,
1 couldn't keep a steady smile like that.
"I follow Art myself—in humbler ways.
Where elements of laughter ought to lurk,
Yet, being photographed, I fail to raise
More than the ghostly semblance of a smirk!"
Something was wanting. That was why I bought
These types of grinning Beauty by the gross,
And set them on my mantelpiece and thought
"This spectacle will make me less morose."
It didn't. On the contrary, I wore
An air of worse depression every day,
Till I could bear the dreadful sight no more,
Because in that direction madness lay.
Thank Heaven that saved my reason in the nick!
For Fashion, not before the hour was ripe,
Dethroned the simpering sort that made me sick
And boomed instead the pensive, soulful type.
Xow in my gallery, stocked with fresh supplies
(Ethereal creatures, save in point of wings),
I see the spirit gaze through dreamy eyes,
Trying to cope with transcendental things;
Above unearthly brows a vague unrest,
Sign of immortal yearning, darkly broods,
And lo! a weight is lifted off my chest,
And I am purged of pessimistic moods;
Yes, when I watch them doing all they know
To look the part of Intellectual Grace,
Then to the winds I let my megrims go,
And laugh till I am crimson in the face! 0. S.
A CORRESPONDENT sends this advertisement from a local
paper:—
HOMER found exhausted in the Irish Sea. Ring on the left leg.
—Apply, &c.
At first, sight this seems an exceptionally good Breakfast
Table Problem. Of course the good Homer sometimes nods, and
might have fallen overboard when in a state of physical
exhaustion. And, as to the left leg, there is the well-known
case of the old man (not necessarily Homer) who never said
his prayers, and was taken by this limb and flung downstairs.
But the ring still presents a difficulty, and, altogether, we
think it best not to keep the answer over till next week.
It was a homing pigeon.
THE COMING OF "TOGO."
"MY dear," said my wife, "I have made up my mind."
Those who know my wife know that when she makes this
tremendous statement anything may be expected.
"Is it much ?" I said. "Will the cheque be a large one?"
"That is not as funny as you think it is," said my wife,
with dignity. "I have made up my mind that we must have
a dog."
"You !" I gasped. "A dog! Why you've always been
afraid of the merest puppies."
"Oh, leave her alone," said my wife's mother, who was
present at this interview. "It's a mere caprice of hers.
She '11 forget all about it to-morrow."
"That," said my wife, " is very unjust, very unjust indeed;
but it decides me: I 'm firmly determined to Live a dog.
You know, my dear, you are sometimes away from home, and
now that we 've got baby the house seems more than ever
lonely and unprotected; and BINNS, though a most faithful
servant, is a sleeper of extraordinary soundness, I believe,
and, in short, we ought to have a dog to stay in the house at
night and watch over us all—you included, Mamma, though
after what you 've said you really don't deserve it, but I can
afford to be generous."
So it was decided that we were to have a dog.
The next question was—what kind of a dog?
St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, and mastiffs were rejected
as being too large. Collies were said to be treacherous.
Our dog was to combine the mildness and traditional play-
fulness of the lamb with the unreasoning and dauntless
ferocity of a polar bear. The former qualities he was to
exhibit towards his owners and their family and dependants;
the latter was to spring into activity immediately upon
contact with burglars.
"He will mistake us all for burglars on his first night,"
said my mother-in-law.
"That shows, Mamma, how little you know about dogs. I
think," added my wife, "I should like a bull-dog best."
It happened that at that moment I knew of no satisfactory
and available bull-dogs. Having heard, however, that the
landlady who had taken care of me in my bachelor-days
desired to find a home for a bull-terrier aged seven months,
I suggested that he would be the very dog for our purpose—
bold, strong, furnished with magnificent teeth, but highly
amenable to kindness, admirably faithful and very sportive.
"A bull-terrier," said my wife, "sounds most attractive.
In fact, that is exactly the dog I 've been thinking of.
What is a bull-terrier like, really?" she continued. "Is his
hair very long?"
When I had furnished the necessary explanations the bull-
terrier was decided upon.
"Mark my words," said my mother-in-law, who has an
agreeable gift of minor prophecy, "you'll be sorry for
this."
On the morning of the day appointed for Togo's arrival
I had, as usual, to go to town. All arrangements for meeting
Togo, conducting him to his home and seeing to his welfare,
had, however, been made, and I felt no anxiety as to the
result. In fact, I forgot all about the matter. When I
returned I found my wife waiting for me at the station,
which is but a short distance from our house. She was
manifestly in a state of great agitation.
"Good heavens, EMILY," said I, "what's the matter with
you? You look as if you 'd seen a ghost."
"Ghost! " she said. "I wish it was. Oh, we've had the
most awful time with that dog. Why, why did I ever yield
to you? I might have known that a bull-terrier seven months
old was no fit dog for a quiet country house. But I 've come
armed," and she showed me the butt end of an old revolver
concealed in a basket which she was carrying.

"But there are no cartridges to that revolver," said I.
"Hush!" said my wife, looking round apprehensively.
"The dog doesn't know that."
Then I gathered the details of all the terrors that had been
undergone. Togo, having been fetched from the station by
the coachman, who was no longer in his first youth, had
dragged that ancient and wheezy retainer at lightning speed
along the road. They had arrived at the house, where the
coachman, having called huskily for beer, had collapsed in the
servants' hall. Togo had seized his opportunity and bolted,
chain and all, into the kitchen, where he had upset the cook
by butting her from behind like a ram. The cook had been
supported to her bedroom by two housemaids, but had been
pursued by the implacable animal and had been again upset,
together with her attendants, on the staircase. All three had
since these awful events been going from hysterics to hysterics.
BiJfXS, after making one futile effort to secure Togo, had
locked himself into the pantry, declaring (through the key-
hole) that lie never did hold with dogs, and that bull-terriers
who had once tasted blood were especially to be feared.
Togo had then entered the drawing-room, had leapt lightly
over a barricade of chairs erected by my wife and her mother,
had jumped at both their throats with his mouth wide open and
his eyes gleaming, and had finally disappeared like a tornado
into the garden, where all trace of him had been lost. My
wife had then taken to the revolver. My mother-in-law, a
most courageous woman, was at this moment, engaged in
pacing the shrubbery with a sword that had belonged to my
uncle the C'olonel.
"Oh, I do hope he's lost for ever," said my wife. "Fortu-
nately he didn't see baby. Otherwise I tremble to think
what the consequences might have been."
As she said this we emerged upon the front lawn, and
there a terrible sight met our eyes.
Our nurse was hanging, shrieking, over the lower branch
of an apple tree. In the middle of the lawn Togo was
Standing with a fatuous expression of pleasure in his pink-
rimmed eyes, his tail wagging thirty to the dozen, and sitting
beside him was our two-year-old hope and heir, with his arms
round Togo's neck and his head propped against Toyos
back. At a distance of a hundred yards my mother-in-law
was making passes in the air with the Colonel's sword from
behind a laurel bush.
0 e 0 o o
Togo is becoming quite a respectable dog. He lives mostly in
the nursery, and the heir does exactly what he likes with him.
ANGLING NOTES.
MINISTERIAL waters continue troubled, but here and there a
pretty kettle of fish has been landed. There has been n'o
Liberal catch of plaice, but" gentle baiting " is being indulged
in with some success.
Japanese waters have been in prime condition for bottom
fishing, and large captures of submerged ironclads are
reported.
Sport in the Black Sea has been chancy, but on the whole
good, with flounders much in evidence. Best killing flies, the
"Mutineer" and the "Cossack."
The Neva is swollen and muddy, and with a continuance
of the present reign lively times are expected. Artisans and
moujiks are rising fitfully. Grand Pukes are a little out of
condition.
Although more rain is wanted on the Nile, crocodiles are
still on the feed: best bait, Cook's tourists, but fellaheen are
not refused.
From South Africa reports are conflicting. Contractors are
said to have been rising well at Army Stores, but few have
been grassed. On the Zambesi lite sun is too strong for
successful daytime angling; there is, however, a fair volume
of water, and in the evenings hippopotami are rising well to
i the tse-tse fly.

THOUGHTS OK DRINK IN TIME OF DROUGHT.
IN Summer-time when, by the Dog-Star's aid,
The Gkss ascends to Eighty in the Shade,
The burning Question of all Questions is:
How can our Thirst be suitably allayed?
I know a Man in occult Lore immersed,
Who says that Christian Science quenches Thirst:
But when I met him in the Indian Plains
In Strength and Length his Drinks were doubly first.
Myself did as a Boy affect a Jar
That held a Drink named Raspberry Vinegar r
But Adults, when they try this Liquid, find
The more they drink the thirstier they are.
What Anglo-Indians call the "Whisky Peg"
One can no longer swallow by the Keg,
Since TREVES condemned the Use of Alcohol;
And TREVES is not the Man to pull your Leg.
Cold Tea is cooling, but the Tyrant HAIG,
In Accents wholly the Reverse of vague
Condemns Tea, Coffee, Cocoa, Chocolate,
And bids us shun them as we should the Plague.
Plain Water, if not carefully distilled,
With pathogenic Germs is mostly filled;
Yet in the Fluid that is filtered best
All Trace of Sparkle is entirely killed.
Our Grandfathers, if I am not at Fault,
Drank freely at all Hours of Home-brewed Malt;
But those who emulate such Habits now
Descend with Speed to the ancestral Vault.
The Wielders of the Willow lean, I fear,
To Gin commingled with Stone Ginger Beer;
But those who covet the " Centurion's" Fame
From this seductive Beverage steer clear.
Champagne, or, for the lower Orders, Rum,
Cheers the Depressed and mollifies the Glum;
But taken freely 'neath a Tropic Sky
Tends to upset the Equilibrium.
Hock, when the Sun is blazing at high Noon,
With Seltzer Water tempered, is a Boon;
Yet we must not forget that decent Hock
Is only purchased once in a blue Moon.
Lime-Juice, when other Liquids can't be had,
Dilute with bubbling Waters is not bad:
And, differing from Gin, which stunts the Growth,
It may be given to a growing Lad.
Good Barley Water, with a gentle Blend
Of Lemon, many Medicos commend;
But, personally, I have found this Brew
Though wholesome, makes for Tedium in the End.
The hardy Denizens of Lancashire
Affect a Tipple called Botanic Beer.
I know a Man who tasted it, but he
In adamantine Boldness had no Peer.
Some Folk the Claims of Lager Beer advance;
But here, as elsewhere, much depends on Chance;
For Pilsen seems in latter Years to have
No geographical Significance.
It needs not to be said that Lemonade
Is always more salubrious when Home made:
And in the golfing Championships is quaffed
By VARDON, TAYLOR, FERNIE, HERD and BRAID.
But Golfers, when inclined their Drives to sclaff,
Correct this Tendency with Shandygaff,
A genial Compound much affected by
The famous Yankee Skipper Captain HAFF.
EDWARD FITZGERALD had a Friend named POSH,
AVith whom he went a-yachting near the Wash;
And POSH, so Mr. SHORTER now has proved,
Once lived for three whole Days on Lemon Squash.

Why Men see double and when Mice seem pink;
But eighteen Quatrains of this Sort of Stuff

MY DEAR COMMODORE PUNCH,—If you 're not a Commodore

and I 've been ashore, feted by all the consuls and captains,
and by every man who could do the thing well; and I have
had "passes" and "sendings off" and "sendings on" from
everybody at Brest, and I 've made speeches, in all sorts of
languages, after dinner, breakfast, and lunch. I don't quite
know now which was which, but I write in the fulness of
my—heart, and I 've made all the jokes I know about "Brest
to Brest," "Brest high," "0 my bonnie Brest knot," (which
I sang in my native language), and " a-Brest with the Times,"
and so forth, and they have all gone in first-rate style,—in fact,
been entente-cordially received, and speaking for everyone
generally we, as your Special Commissioner (you see I use
the double-entente "we" for the single "I")—ice, I say,
have been done to rights; and if I cannot at this moment
sufficiently overcome my emotions to give you a full, true,
and particular account of our Anglo-Frenchy doings, you
must excuse me. But it's coming, Sister MARY, and when my
report does appear you may be able to bet your boots on its
absolute correctness. We're all jolly good fellows and so
say all of us aboard the Anglo-Frenchy or Frencho-Angly
vessels, of which I cannot remember the names, but post this
on to you, lest you should think that I am neglecting duty.

are all as we are. We 're enjoying ourselves. French sailors

on together. As for to-morrow—to-morrow be to-morrow'd!
At present, " Vire le grog franyaix!"

THE news that the British sailors and
the French sailors exchanged hats at
Brest has led to an agitation in our Army
for a similar meeting between the land
forces of the two countries.
With reference to the War Stores
Enquiry, we are requested to state that
the rat which is said to have eaten cer-
tain important documents has been con-
fused with two other rats of the samename.
Lord STANI.EY has refused to withdraw
the charge of " blackmailing and blood-
sucking" which he brings against Post
Office employees. It is even rumoured
that, not satisfied with the fact that the
Post Office vehicles are already painted
a blood red, Lord STANLEY intends to
have the lettering on the same altered to
"The Roval Black Mail."
The young barrister who supplied a
party to a recent action with explicit
instructions as to how to dress for the
jury, has, it is said, received a lucrative
offer from the leading legal paper to
conduct a fashion column in its pages.
We hear that the finger-print experi-
ments have proved so successful in
tracing criminals that the police autho-
rities will in future oppose any proposal
for the erection of more public baths and
wash-houses, as the cleaner the criminal,
the worse the finger-print.
THOMAS DILIX>N, aged 102, was sworn
in last week as special officer in charge
of the public swimming pool at Akron,
Ohio. He has had great experience in
saving his own life.
A lady writes that on an exceptionally
hot day last week she distinctly saw
the funnel of a Thames steamboat faint
while passing under a low bridge.
A contemporary publishes a list of
remarkable crimes said to have been

The weather in America was so hot

to make a dash for the Pole.
"Bathing Costumes greatly reduced,"

shows the danger of bragging.

of the workhouse eluding the vigilance
o£ the officials and getting drunk out-
side, to dress him in trousers of yellow
or some other distinctive colour. We
understand that the Music-Hall Comic
Singers' Association is about to protest
against the action of the Guardians, as
being calculated to bring a respectable
calling into disrepute.
The Admiralty, it has transpired,
recently spent £47 10*. on a sun-print-
ing frame when one could have been
bought for £6, and the War Office
feels sincerely flattered.
Sir JAMES CRICHTON BROWNE thinks that
every child, ought to be brought up
impressed with the obligation of living
to 100. We have no objection to the
proposal so long as someone shall have
power to grant certificates of exemption
to exceptionally unpleasant persons at,
say, the age of 40.
The young ladies of Great Britain are
now face to face with one of the most
serious crises of their existence. The
supply of curates is said to be giving
out.

drunk and disorderly, and the magistrate
made no comment.

moon, nearly at the full, floats like a tissue-paper balloon
in the violet sky above the trees to the south, wliose summits
are tinged with a russet glow by the declining sun. Tlie
centre of the Pond is ruffled with golden ripples; elsewhere
the water is a glassy olive-green, in which the pale blues
and whites and pinks of the frocks of children on the
bank are vaguely repeated. Tlie children themselves are
of most grades, from the Gutter to the Upper Middle
Classes. Amongst, but not of, them are a few elderly
men, prominent members of various Model Yacht Clubs,
to ichom boat-sailing is not so much a pastime as a serious
profession. A bronzed Park-keeper regards children and
grown-ups alike with an official, benevolence.

just finished adjusting the rig of a smart- racing cutter,
coloured green and copper and furnished with a centre-board of
scientific design—to her Nurse, who is seated on a campstool
with a volume of threepenny fiction). There, I shall just port
the helm a very little, Nurse, and then I think she ought to
make a straight course, don't you?
Her Nurse (who belongs to an Older School, with asperity).
It's no use asking me my opinion, Miss BARBARA, because I 've
none to give. Miss ADELA—her in my last place that you 've
heard me talk of before—never wanted to mess about with
no sailing boats, for all the world as if she was a boy. She 'cl
bring out her doll in its pram, and set by me for hours as
quiet as quiet. A reg'lar little lady Miss ADELA was, in all
respec's.
Barbara (without troubling herself to express her private
opinion of the exemplary ADELA). Yes, Nurse, I know. I 'm
going over to that farther corner. I shall get a better breeze
there. No, you needn't come—I can manage much better by
myself.
[She takes her yacht and a boat-hook, and goes off with the
calm independence peculiar to the modern child.

I expostulate with her at any length for
talking to me, as I am frequently com-

an absolutely uncalled-for lit quoque.
This, Sir, is a form of rejoinder no self-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
;EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS.
Some Gentlemen to whom tlie idea of the Redistribution of the Seats they occupy is in the highest degree distasteful.
House of Commons, Monday, July 17.—
If this sort of thing goes on PRINCE
ARTHUR really will throw up the sponge,
hand in his checks, or go through any
other metaphorical form that means
retirement from office. He can stand
continuous hard work and gets plenty of
it. Members who sniff at him because
he is occasionally absent from the
Treasury Bench would find themselves
pretty well done tip if they got through
a tithe of his daily task. That he makes
light of. What he can't stand is the
unreasonableness of man, also of woman.
To-day has had sharp experience of both.
To begin with, the SPEAKER interposed
objection, based on antiquated prece-
dents, against his running through his
Redistribution Resolutions in a couple
of morning sittings. Nothing could
exceed his own sweet reasonableness in
the matter. He originally proposed one
morning sitting for discussion of what is
practically a far-reaching Reform Bill.
Objection taken, he generously gave two.
Now the SPEAKER insists there shall
be a second reading debate on the
scheme as a whole, which would occupy
two or three full sittings; then the
House to go into Committee and severally
discuss with full flush of amendments
eight, possibly nine, distinct Resolutions.
That meant something like eight weeks
of Parliamentary time. It involved the
alternative of extending the Session into
chill October, or adjourning in mid-

"A picturesque figure rarely seen."
(The Duke of Rutland.)
August, meeting again for an autumn
Session. There was one other method
of meeting the dilemma. PRINCE ARTHUR
seized it. He dropped the Resolutions.
This bad enough; what followed,
worse still. The East End has risen in
its despair; this afternoon marched to
Westminster, wanting to know about the
promised Bill providing workmen with
employment. It is the women who have
undertaken the mission, and they come
to Westminster with puny babes in their
arms, wailing enquiry as to what's going
to be done, for their husbands. They
stream into PRINCE ARTHUR'S private room
and put the question to him face to face.
Many interviews taken place in this
chamber, some epwh-making; never
anything like this. A score of gaunt,
hungry-eyed women clustering round
the PRIME MINISTER, clamouring for bread,
or the means to buy it. New precedent
this, by the side of which those quoted
by SPEAKER an hour earlier, with result
01 tearing to pieces the Redistribution
Resolutions, grow mustier and mustier.
To the heated imagination there is
something in it reminiscent of episodes
closely preceding the French Revolution.
Wasn't there an aristocrat who, when
the people [asked for bread, retorted
with inquiry, "Why don't you eat grass?"

THE SUMMONS TO SUURKNDKU.
(The Government were defeated by four votes, July 20, and Sir Henry Campuell-Hunnerimin
demanded an armistice with a view to the surrender of the garrison.)
In the grim story of what later took place
in the streets of Paris there lives for
ever the picture of ;i well-dressed man
dangling from a lamppost, his month
stuffed with grass.
PRINCE ARTHUR spoke to his strange
afternoon callers softly, promising that
everything should be done to bring the
Bill along. Whereupon they withdrew
and, gallantly escorted by Mr. CROOKS,
had tea on the Terrace in the company
of more fortunate sisters, to whom the
refreshment was preliminary to eight-
o'clock dinner. When they had gone
PRINCE ARTHUR went back to Treasury
Bench, to worry round the fourth stage
of Aliens Bill.
Business done.—Redistribution Reso-
lutions abandoned.
House of Ijords, Tuesday night.—"I
suppose if PRINCE ARTHUR insists, we shall
have Redistribution of the electorate.
But," said the LORD CHANCELLOR grimly,
"they sha'n't redistribute the trams so
as to bring them over the bridges and
run along the Embankment. They '11 be
wanting 'em up Constitution Hill next."
Bill authorising the work has passed
the House of Commons. Has been
blessed by nearly every Borough Coun-
cil in the metropolis. Even the City
Corporation have acquiesced. Some
millions living south of the River clamour
for it. Royal Commission on Traffic
support its principal proposal. CARRING-
TON, backing Bill, cited typical case of a
woman who lives at Brixton and goes
daily to her work in Holborn. If, in-
stead of leaving the tram at the foot of
Westminster Bridge, she might ride
along Embankment on her way, it would
mean to her a saving of 450 miles
walked in the year.
What is that to the LORD HIGH CHAN-
OEIXOR, whose longest walk is from his
robing room to the woolsack? Coming
to assistance of his young friend RIDLEY,
properly shocked at prospect of the Em-
bankment reserve being open to common
tram folk, he put his foot down, and the
Bill was thrown out by nearly 2 to 1.
Debate brought down a veteran whose
picturesque figure is rarely seen.
"Protection makes us acquainted with
strange bedfellows," the Duke of RUT-
LAND said to the MEMBER FOR SARK, when
the latter congratulated him on his
speech delivered last year in support of
DON JOSE'S Fiscal Policy.
Thereafter the Duke retired to the
learned leisure of Belvoir Castle. This
attempted outrage on the Embankment
called him once more to the front. Let
wealthjand commerce, laws and learning,
die; but leave, oh leave us this costly
thoroughfare (paid for out of the rates)
free from the contamination of rate-
payers who ride in penny trams.
''My Lords," said the Duke, erect
under the weight of nearly ninety years,
''take your courage in both hands, and
defend the Embankment against attack
year by year made upon it by the
London County Council."
When, sixty-four years ago, Lord
JOHN MANNERS came to sit in the Com-
mons, Member for Newark, with the
rising hope of stern, unbending Toryism
as his colleague, Free Trade was non-
existent, the London County Council
undreamt of. He has lived long enough
to see Protection again uplift its head,
and to-day assists in giving the L. C. C.
what the Curate in The Private Secretary
used to threaten to deal his tormentors—
"a good hard knock."
The Duke begins to believe that,
after all, the world is not in such hope-
less state as in moments of depression he
has feared.
Business done. — L. C. C. Tramways
Bill thrown out by 64 votes against 33.
House of Commons, Friday morning.
One o'clock. — Ministerialists yesterday
morning, opening their billydoo from the
PINK 'L*N, found it almost picturesque
in its phrase. With the emphasis of
three lines it besought Members to be in
their places punctually at nine o'clock.
"The Opposition," so ran the incantation,
"have cancelled their pairs. The Irish
are over in full force. There will be a
lively evening."
Almost up to the stroke of midnight
this last forecast was falsified. Nothing
could be drearier than the speeches
following each other on JOHN REDMOND'S
Amendment to reduce vote for Irish
Land Commission. Shortly after eleven
WALTER LONG made his second speech,
not livelier than the first. Then TAY
PAY for a while whirled his shillelah
in the sultry air. As the limp hand of
the clock stretched forth to clasp welcome
midnight the question was put.
Members hurried forth without visible
sign of emotion. Division would pro-
bably be a close one. Opposition cer-
tainly showed up well. But, after PRINCE
ARTHUR'S Foreign Office appeal to the
loyalty of his Party surely all was well.
On ordinary occasion, if division be
taken at midnight Members hurry forth
to secure a cab, content to wait for the
morning paper to learn precise figures.
This morning they returned to the House
filling the benches, crowding the Bar.
As the minutes sped rumour ran to and
fro. The buzz of conversation rose to
deafening height. The PINK 'UN and
ESMONDE, the Irish \Vhip, were back
almost simultaneously. Evidently a close

There was a moment's silence as the

figures. To whom would he hand the
paper? In many a pitched battle the
PINK 'Ux has awaited it as a matter of
course, taking his place at the extreme

edging a little to the left to make room
for the Irish Whip.

We 're far from common players.
The mason blocks with careful eye;
We dub him " Old Stonewall."
The blacksmith hammers hard and high,
And the spreading chestnuts fall.
Sheer terror strikes our enemies
When comes the postman's knock,
Whereas his slow deliveries
Would suit the veriest crock.
The butcher prides himself on chops;
His leg-cuts are a joke;
But when he lambs the slow long-hops
There's beef behind his stroke.
The grocer seldom cracks his egg:
He cannot catch; lie butters.
The gardener mows each ball to leg,
And trundles daisy-cutters.
Our tailor's cut is world-renowned;
The coachman's drives are rare;
He '11 either cart you from the ground
Or go home with a pair.
The village constable is stout,
Yet tries short runs to win:
They say he 's run more people out
Than ever he ran in.
The curate (captain) every match
Bowls piffle doomed to slaughter,
But still is thought a splendid catch
By the vicar's elderly daughter.
The watchmaker winds up the side,
But fails to time his pulls;
By now he must lie well supplied
With pairs of spectacles.
Our umpire's fair; he says "Not Out,"
Or "Out," just as he thinks;
And gives the benefit of the doubt
To all who stand him drinks.

Can make our pride diminish;

After a glorious finish!

with approval Sir THOMAS LAUDKR Biirx-
TON'S advice that Londoners should go

fully in Battersea Park. Before rush-
ing abroad, therefore, or even out of
town, next month in search of health
and distraction, the jaded West-ender j
would do well to study the following
list of "Kur-orts " and attractions provi-
ded, on the spot, by the ever solicitous'

On Bank Holiday, August 7, at 6 A.M.,:
the new Kouversationshaus and Trink-
halle on the main island in Piccadilly
Circus will be formally opened by HERR
E. A. CORNWALL, Oberbezirksrat, who
will drink a glass of water from the
fountain now re-named the "Schafts-
burgsquelle." Thereafter and until
eight o'clock every morning during the
season, the attendant Blumenmadchen,
in appropriate attire, will dispense the
health-giving fluid to their fashionable
visitors, while five German bands will
simultaneously give local colour to the
proceedings by playing Teutonic airs
on the Regentstrasse and Pikkadilli-
gasse Promenades.
Preparations are being made for a
brilliant season at Putney-Plage, which
bids fair to become a formidable rival to
Scheveningen, Ostend and Trouville.
The boat-houses have lately been con-
verted into a well-appointed Casino, with i
ball-room, ctablissement des bains, and,
facilities for European pool, baccarat and
petits ehecanx. The Societe Anonyme
des Ravageurs de la Bone gives daily
reunions at low tide, when some very
chic, costumes will be noticed among the
Fulham Smart Set. The new accele-
rated service of paddle steamers now,
performs the trajvt from Westminster in
little over two hours.
Alpinists will be glad to hear that
unusual opportunities for their favourite
pursuit are in prospect this summer in
the Holborn Obcrland and the Strand-
Konigsweg ranges. Many unexpected [
crevasses have appeared, which will test
the nerve of the hardiest mountaineer to i
negotiate, and constant avalanches are
reported in these districts. The Mer

district is a thing whereon even a,
WHYMPEK or a MARTIN CONWAY would
fear to tread.
Excellent sport is expected on the
sparrow-moors of Hampstead Heath on
the Twelfth. The birds are strong on
the wing, there has been very little
disease, and keepers are confident of
record bags. It is hoped that the Par-
liamentary session will be wound up in
time for hard-worked legislators to
exchange the stifling atmosphere of St.
Stephen's for breezes of these sportive
uplands on the opening day. Mean-
while, the rush to the North has begun,
and Jack Straw's Castle is crammed to
the ramparts, while every shooting-box
in the neighbourhood has been let
twice over.
The Lea has been in spate recently,
and the souls of fishermen are corre-
spondingly elated. We hear that several
fine gudgeon have gone up the river,
and some ardent spinners with the dry
fly are already after them. With this,
and the welcome news that the close
time for roach on Clapham Common is
now over, and that gaffs at a penny are
being advertised in the New Cut, what
more could our hackle-wielders wish?
It would seem, therefore, that there is
ample scope within sound of Bow Bells
for the valetudinarian, the pleasure-
seeker, and the sportsman to indulge
and repair themselves to their hearts'
content. ZIGZAG.

LAST OPERATIC NOTE OF THE SEASON.

"AFTER THE OPERA IS OVER!"
THE London Operatic Season is over. There is to be an
Autumn Opera in Town, of which more presently. One
down, t'other come on. Judging from what Mr. Punch'a
Operatic Observer has seen and heard, the past has been excep-
tionally profitable to Operatic directors and decidedly satis-
factory to Messrs. MESSAGER, NEIL FORSYTII, and the public.
On the 1st of May RICHTER was enthusiastically received,
conducting WAGNER and all his works. Then, while we were
yet labouring under the Wagnerian nightmare of Giants,
Dwarfs, Floating Fairies, and Pantomimic Dragons, we
were awaked by the delightful Barber of Seville, on which
occasion Mile. BAUERMEISTER was conspicuous by her absence.
Alas ! she was not to appear again until her Farewell Benefit
in July. Farewell, a long farewell, and, if for ever, fare thee
well! Such is operatic life, "which likewise is the end of all
things." You may see her, as depicted by our artist in the
sketch above, waving her adieux, from the deck of a depart-
ing vessel, to her old companions who are disporting them-
selves on the sands of Tune near the Round of Tune.
Then, under MANCINELLI'S sympathetic conducting, were
wafted to us, on a Tuesday night, May 9, the sweet
strains of DONIZETTI'S Don Pasquale, commencing with "Com'
e gentil." This revival—alas! for one night only, as this
deponent does not remember its having been given a second

MESSAGER, FORSVTH and the Directors can tell; but they
won't.
MELBA, as Violetta in IM Traviata, and under a new
umbrella hat depicted by our hawk-eyed artist, next arrived.
In her train came Mini, her Bohemian friends, and Signor
CABUSO, at his very best. Subsequently, excellent Mile.
DESTIXN tried her best to make us forget CALVE as Carmen,
as Micaela. Signor
and Mile. DONALDA scored a success
DAI.MORES was a first-rate Don Jose.
On Derby Day there was no Ring, but WAGNER'S Die
Meitterringer was named as the favourite, with VAN ROOY in
regular right Rooyal voice, and Fraulein ALTEN as Eva-green
Era. Epsom excitement over, we settled down to MELBA-
Marguerite, in Faust, on Thursday after Derby. The King
of SPAIN'S state visit to the Opera on Thursday, June 8, was
a grand gala night indeed, though Don Pasquale and Don
\Giovanni were not invited to be present. Just about this
time happened the deluge, and there were no arks, in shape
1 of cabs, wherein to reach home dry-footed. Opera singers,
however, were uninjured, as immediately afterwards, ere yet
the decorations had disappeared, we find Mile. DESTINN at her
very best in A'ida, and her companions quite unaffected by
the "rain that raineVl every day."
Madame JEANNE RAUNAY distinguished herself in VERDI'S
Un Batto in Maschera, as did also Mile. SELMA KURZ, Signori
SCXITTI and CARUSO. Royalty has patronised the Opera very
regularly, and with royal punctuality Next notable event
was the Orfeo of Madame KIRKBV LUNN and the Euridice of
JEANNE RAUNAY. Afterwards Orfeo was sung and the lyre
played by Mile. GERVILLE-REACHE, the part not being quite
'within her reach,—that is perhaps because this deponent's
I memory reaches back to JULIA RAVOGLI. Next notable event,
| June 28, was the production of a new opera, L'Oracolo, by
j Signor FRANCO LEONI, excellently done. It was a quaint show,
admirably staged, but not the opera for Covent Garden. The
'"working of The Oracle" was well managed, but general
opinion appears to be that, like the majority of oracles, it
cannot be relied upon.
July opened with Don Giovanni and a first-rate cast.

Then The Oracle was given a second chance. The next
production was Romeo et Juliette, with Scotch lassie DONALDA
as heroine, and M. DALMORES as the amorous " climbing boy."
Another novelty, Madama Butterfly, by PUCCINI, was pro-
duced. This Butterfly is out for something more than a
flutter, and it will be in the repertoire for next season, with,
probably, the same cast, on which, as it included Mile.
DESTINN, Madame LEJEUNE, powerful Mile. SIMEOLI, Signori
Soom and CARUSO, it would be difficult to improve. The
title Butterfly suggests a series of Grasshoperas.
In front, the House has been notably well managed, and
on the very hottest nights the Syndics of the Syndicate, who
prefer to take things coolly, ventilated the question of heat
satisfactorily, and introduced a delightful nir arranged for
orchestra and audience, without any such .^Eolian draughts
as not so very long ago gave a blow to several systems, from
which they with difficulty recovered.
An Autumn-tum-tum Season is, as this deponent has
already deposed, announced by the Grand Opera Singdicate
and Mr. FRANK RENDLE. Under this banner and commanded,
presumably, by Generals MESSAGF.R and FonsYrn, the San
Carlo Opera Company is to give an eight-weeks' season,
commencing in October, when the longest vacation is pretty
sure to be over, and London will be re-filling. The prices for
stalls are from 12s. 6d. to 7s. 0(/., and the first row of the pit
circle is 10s. dd., the same price as is charged for seats in
rows L to Q of stalls. The Operatic Singdicate knows best,
hut at first sight most theatre-goers would have considered
it wiser to commence the prices of pit at a shilling less than
the lowest charge for stalls. Such a charge as this might
lead to another row being added, i.e. a row (rhyming with
"how ") between the pit-preferring public and the manage-
ment. Absit omen! This deponent's suggestion would be
6s. 6d. for first row in pit circle; 5s. for all the other rows;
and 4s. each for admission of mere mortals to the seats of
"the Gods." Advice gratis, and best wishes for success of
Syndicate's scheme.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MY Nautical Retainer writes: In that narrow field of
literature to which we give the name of " light verse "(" light,"
that is, for the reader, but difficult enough for the writer),
there is not living to-day a more conscientious craftsman than
Captain KENDALL, late K.A., known by the nom de guerre of
"Dusf-DuM." His new volume, "Rltymcs of the East and
Re-collected Verses (CONSTABLE), is largely made xip of the best
of the work which he had previously published in India,
and of new matter from the pages of Punch. It marks a
great advance upon his earlier books in the direction of self-
criticism and fastidious judgment. Though in many of his
poems the influence of CALVERLEY is easy to trace, there is no
question but that "DuM-Duji's" work i.s distinguished by a
rare individuality. It lias breadth and spaciousness, along
with a studied felicity in the choice of the right word. It reveals
always that "fundamental brainwork" which was ROSSETTI'S
primary demand. If his style betrays any characteristic fault,
it is that of diffuseness; but it is not the diffuseness of the
writer who ekes out his line with the otiose epithet or phrase.
It is due in part to the complex metrical systems which he some-
times adopts; but chiefly it is due to fertility of thought
and expression; and to the fact that, when he has found many
happy ways of urging the same argument, he has not the
heart to make an invidious selection. Yet he seldom wants
for the inevitable brief phrase which clinches a conclusion.
His great charm lies in the trick of a sudden bathos of
colloquialism occurring in the midst of a mock-serious flight
of eloquence. Yet with all his feeling for humorous con-
trasts, and his delightful taste in the grotesque, it is for
his sense of style^ and technique that this volume, so free
from all that is trivial and hackneyed and slipshod, will win
the commendation of the best judges of this form of "belles
lettres. And when one regards the high quality of work-
manship demanded of the maker of light verse if it is to be
worth making at all, one may perhaps apply MATTHEW
ARNOLD'S words to the standard of technique which "Dusr-
Di;>r" sets to other followers of his light-hearted Muse:
Such, poets, is your bride, the Muse! young, gay,
Radiant, adorn'd outside; a hidden ground
Of thought and of austerity within.
In Shrewsbury (METHUEX) Mr. AUDEX presents a historical
and topographical account of one of the most interesting and
picturesque towns in England. My Baronite knew it in his
youth, and welcomes with pleasure, that in degree will be
shared by others, this record. The story of Shrewsbury is
an intimate part of the history of England, and supplies
material for the not least interesting chapter. King JOHN
was quite a latecomer on the scene, his charter to the borough
confirming to the burgesses "all liberties, free customs and
quittances, as they had them in the time of King HENRY, our
great grandfather." In later times known to SHAKSPEARF,
S'Jr Jolni Falxtaff fought at Shrewsbury, in the battle where
Hotspur was killed. There are few towns of contemporary
date that preserve so many fragments of old houses, churches,
council chambers, and other buildings. Charm is added to
the book by the pictures of these contributed by Miss
KATHERINE ROBERTS.
It is not often that an author boldly calls the hero of his
own creation a fool, yet this is what Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT
does in his novel, which he has entitled Tlie Fool Errant
(HF.INEMANN). Not so very long ago, if the Baron's memory
serves him correctly, another writer of romance, Mr. BURLAND,
did something similar, only he was polite enough not to
directly attract attention to the simple-mindedness of his
hero. But in this book of Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT'S we have
a chivalric fool, a sane Quixotic English youth, frank, honest,
religious, coming of an ancient family, which so sturdily adheres
to the persecuted faith of its forefathers, that it must send its
heir abroad, there to obtain, in the University of Padua, the
education, fitting his position, that is denied to him in his
own country. Such a fool as Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT makes
of his hero is a delightful character! Would there were more
fools of the same sort! The tale of his ever-varying romantic
adventures is never tedious. One character, however, namely
the villainous mendicant friar, surely belongs to an earlier
date than that of this story. As to the sweet women who
live or die for the hero (and of one, disguised as a page, the
Baron seems to have some pleasant reminiscence in "quite
another story," and also as a character in an Alexandrine
drama at the St. James's), they are all charmingly drawn;
and the true love of the self-sacrificing woman is forcibly
contrasted with the passion of the woman who is not a crown
to her husband. The. Fool Errant is never the fool
peccant: the shield of his honour is untarnished. He is
disillusioned with regard to one whom he lias foolishly, but
honestly, adored. As to the
Italians of the period, with
whom the Fool is brought into
contact, there is scarcely one of
them who for integrity and
purity can be for one instant
compared with this Fool of
fiction, to whom the reader, if
he be at first a trifle irritated
by his unworldly folly, will
become so attached as to
regret the moment of parting
with so simple and so lovable a
character.

FASHION'S PHASES.
WHEN first I whispered words of love,
When first you turned aside to hear, |
The winged griffin flew above,
The mammoth gaily gumboil'd near;
I wore the latest thing in skins,
Your dock-leaf dress had just been
mended
And fastened up with fishes' fins —
The whole effect was really splendid.
Again—we wandered by the Nile,
In Egypt's far, forgotten land,
And watched the festive crocodile |
Devour papyrus from your hand.
Far off across the plain we saw
The trader urge his flying camel;
Bright shone the scarab belt you wore,
Clasped with a sphinx of rare enamel.
Again—on Trojan plains I knelt;
Alas! in vain I strove to speak
And tell you all the love I felt
In more or less Homeric Greek;
Perhaps my helmet-strap was tight
And checked the thoughts I fain
would utter,
Or else your robe of dreamy white
Bewildered me and made me stutter.
Once more we change the mise-en-scene;,
The white road curves across the hill; \
Excitement makes you rather plain,
But on the whole I love you still,
As wreathed with veils and goggles blue,
And clad in macintosh and leather,
Snug in our motor built for two
We skim the Brighton road together.
THE ART OF DIALOGUE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I read in a review
the other day that very few authors of
the present age could write really natural
dialogue. Having discovered a way of
writing stories without any dialogue at
all, I beg to present my latest effort to,
your readers. If it seems difficult in!
places, a little study will soon discover
the meaning. My tale is entitled,
THE PREVARICATION OF PR(SCILLA.

A HEARTY APPRECIATION.

There was silence for a little while.
Then ARTHUR returned to the attack.
What right had she to be so decided
about it? he thought.
"," he said," ."
"," she admitted.
"," he went on," -." He
paused for a reply.
There was a short silence, while PRIS-
CILLA thought how best she could put
it. At last she began:
"." She looked timidly at him.
"," she urged, pleadingly.
"," was his monosyllabic com-
ment. [? " Rats "—En.]
-," she persisted.
He stood up in front of her, and cried
to her from the fulness of his heart.

"," he muttered witli clenched

lovingly upon the name.
He held out his arms to her, and no
longer could she resist him.
"," she cooed.
"—-?" he asked, hardly able to
believe his ears.
"," she lisped.
How simple and yet how neat, Mr.
Punch, is this method of writing dialogue.
No long, cumbersome, unreal talk; but
at the same time the reader left in no
doubt as to the nature of the conversa-
tion. "—:—," she lisped. "Yes" or
"No" it must have been, and how can
one lisp '.' No "? The subtlety of it, Mr.
Punch! Your humble servant,
THE O'MEREDITH.
IT is reported that DARLING has called
"Tail" to England's toss four tunes,
and is now convinced that the English
team hasn't got one.

TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP.
[The Pall Mall Gazette, in a collection of Press opinions on the
Government's defeat, quoted from tho Daily Netcs the following dictum
which it considered to be piously expressed: "The prevailing thought
to-day is less exultation than a profound thankfulness that the end Has
come at last. The thing has collapsed just as it seemed getting intoler-
able. From to-day a new chapter opens in the history of this isle and
Empire."]
As when a traveller through a tropic laud.
Bored by a sameness in the desert scenery,
Is moved to smack his lips, all caked with sand,
At sight of distant palms or other greenery;
Then, to his own (and camel's) marked disgust,
On drawing near to that alleged oasis,
Sees that his credulous and child-like trust
Was founded on an insufficient basis:—
Or as the climber up an arduous Alp
Grapples the icy steep, and bravely staunches
The rude excoriations on his scalp
Caused by inevitable avalanches;
And, even while he wields his axe in air,
Crying " Another step and so the summit!"—
Slips off, and after bouncing here and there
Drops perpendicularly like a plummet:—
Or, lastly, as an ail-too previous bird
Counts up her family while still in ovo,
Then finds her estimate has wholly erred,
And she must start and sit again de novo:—
Just so collapsed the Liberal Party's'hopes!
How often one gets left when most elated!
As!in the above extremely obvious tropes
I have with some insistence indicated.
"The Righteous triumph," so the voice had said;
"Yet let us not assume a bumptious attitude,
I-et us, dear brethren, rather bow the head
(Or words to that effect) in speechless gratitude.
"After a most intolerable while
Emancipate from yonder foul Chiinaera,
A virgin future waits this precious isle,
On Greater Britain breaks a brand-new era!"
Prophet! that statement looked so like a threat
It shook the Tory from his indecision,
He vowed that never (or at least not yet)
Should you have scope to realise that vision.
New dawn of Empire under REDMOND (J.)?
Though ARTHUR might be sick to death of office, he
Made up his weary mind at once to stay,
And do his best to stultify that prophecy.
And I, a struggler in the motley school,
Reading of your premonitory rumour,
I own I envied, as a rival fool,
Your priceless gift of pure unconscious humour.

NATURE STUDIES.
THE KITTEN.
THE door was ajar, and through the narrow gap the black
kitten slowly and cautiously insinuated itself into the room.
Perceiving suddenly that there was a male person (myself)
seated in a chair it turned to fly, but the door had swung-to
behind it and egress was barred. Thereupon it immediately
turned round, faced its enemy, and advanced by four side-
long springs half towards, half away from him. Its legs
I were rigid, its back partly arched, its tail tremulously
extended, and, as it sprang, its four feet left the carpet
j simultaneously and then reached it again all together.
Finding, after a pause of one gloomy and defiant moment,
that no notice was taken of it, it again sprang high and
sideways, and then for fifteen seconds chased its tail round
and round with extraordinary speed and ferocity, eventually
rolling over on its back, scrabbling at the tail with its hind
paws, clutching it firmly with its front paws, and gnawing
its tip violently with its teeth. During this performance it
appeared to inflict upon itself (and greatly to its own sur-
prise) a considerable amount of pain, for, having given
three mews of agony, it sprang galvanically to its feet and
scampered up a curtain.
Failing to reach the top—no kitten ever did reach the top
—it clung two-thirds of the way up as though it had been
nailed to the stuff, looked down, and, judging the distance
too far for a fall, shrieked for help. I lifted it down. In a
fury of ingratitude it scratched and bit the helping hand,
and on being deposited on the floor scurried away in terror
to a dark corner. A moment afterwards it sprang a distance
of three feet in pursuit of a fly, followed the chase helter-
skelter on to the window-ledge, banged its head against a
pane of glass and fell off on to the floor. This collapse clearly
outraged all its sense of propriety and dignity. It stalked
slowly and moodily to an arm-chair and began with an air of
profound in j ury to perform its toilet. This process brought
no alleviation, and it turned upon the arm-chair's fringe,
which it happened to touch, with a perfectly ruthless anger,
and becoming hopelessly involved in the tassels stood off
suddenly and glared at the arm-chair.
Thence its attention was diverted to a looking-glass which
had been placed upon the floor. It moved carefully and by a
series of ambushes towards this novel piece of furniture, and,
perceiving that another scraggy black kitten was advancing
towards it, it became stiff with indignation, uttered a low
and most ominous growl, and then hurled itself at the
intruder, stopping dead short, however, when it saw the other
kitten similarly hurling itself. Having looked furtively round
to assure itself that I was not observing it, it executed a
series of diagonals which brought it to a puzzled disappoint-
ment behind the looking-glass. Peering deliberately round
the edge it recoiled in horror from a black face peering at it,
and then gave the thing up and walked away in dudgeon.
Five minutes were then spent in chasing a ball of paper,
turning the most remarkable somersaults, tying itself into
seemingly inextricable knots, and cutting the most fantastic
capers. Soon afterwards, the door having been opened, it
flew out, having for no single moment mitigated its attitude
of unreasoning hostility to myself and all the inanimate
objects in my room.

SIR JAMES CRICHTON-BROWNE'S VIEW.
Disagreement is the salt of life. The
more you disagree the better. It has
been my practice to disagree consistently,
not only with doctors, but with laymen
too. I disagreed with Mr. WINSTON-
CHURCHILL about Harris tweed; I dis-
agree with Mr. FRANK RICHARDSON about
whiskers. If a cannibal were to eat me
(which Heaven forbid before I reach my
hundredth year), I would disagree with
him.

Other letters on this vital subject are
earnestly invited. Everything that is
sent in shall be printed, however idiotic.
THE LOOKER-ON SEES LIFE.
(With apologies to the intrepid contributor of
the "Chronicle.")
Ir was at Brighton. The Looker-on
had been standing for some hours on the
upper esplanade watching the motor
races. At last, a wild desire to do some-
thing heroic filled him. To look on all
day was so tame: why should not he
also act? But first there was a little
ritual to perform. He hurried to his
hotel and flung open the doors of the
bookcase in the drawing-room. A row
of books fell to the floor. They were:
The Jxixt Dai/3 of Pompeii, by Lord
LYTTON: The Iron Pirate, by MAX PEM-
BERTON: Sunday Afternoon Hymns, by
Dr. ROBERTSON NICOI.L: Life's Hot Cross
Currents, by Mr. SWINBUN: Mysticism
and Moonliglit, by WILCOX GIBBS: and
Aylirin, by T. WATTS-DuNToN. Picking up
Mysticism and Moonlight at random the
Looker-on read these words: "Before
the end of all things there must come a
preliminary stage, and few have washen
eyes." Ah! He jotted them down on
his cuff lest there should be any mistake,
and hurried out into the strong sun.
A motor-bus was passing and, acting on
a sudden courageous impulse, the Looker-
on hailed it. He had never been in a
motor before. Ought he to have goggles,
he wondered, and then repeated to liim-
self slowly and musically, "And few
have washen eyes.'1
"Hurry up, Cocky," said the conduc-
tor, and the Looker-on leapt on to the
footboard with a wild thrill.
The motor-bus flew on; nothing
stopped it. Police trap after police trap
was passed; the speed was too great. It
slowed down now and then only for
passengers. This, this is life, thought
the Looker-on. "Before the end of all
tilings there must be a preliminary stage,
and few have washen eyes." Ah! What
would the end be? The Looker-on held

to his seat firmly and gazed ahead witli
level brows. Otliers might fear, but not
he. Now and then he glanced at his
cuff. And then the end came; the
motor-bus ha.d reached the station.
The Looker-on, trembling with sup-
pressed emotion, descended to the street,
and as he did so a man came rushing
by. His eyes were the bright eyes ot'
danger. He gasped for breath as he
ran. The Looker-on, ever desirous to
be in the know, ran beside him to hear
his news.
"Have you heard?" the man panted;
"have—you—heard?"
"No," said the Looker-on, "what is
it? Speak, man, speak, I can't bear
it; and you run so fast."
"Queen ANNE is dead," said the man.
The Looker-on fell back and pondered
as he leaned against a post. How won-
derful is life! He then took his Dic-
tionary of Quotations from his pocket,
eager to find an appropriate sentiment.
He found two, on the same page. One
ran thus:
They also serve who only stand and wait.
Ah! It was signed JOHN MILTON, just a
plain, rather cross, blind old man, yet
how true! The other was this:
There 'a a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will.
The Looker-on stood dazed with rapture.
To think that SHAKSPEARE should thus
speak to his very soul, as intimately as
if he had known him personally. He
thought of COROT and RODIN, of BUDDHA
and CONFUCIUS, and then he went home
to bed. What & day! What a night!

LINES ON THE LINKS.
HARD by the biggest hazard on the course,
Beneath the shelter of a clump of gorse,
Secure from shots from off the heel or toe,
I watch the golfers as they come and go.
I see the fat financier, whose "dunch"
Suggests too copious draughts of " fizz" at lunch;
While the lean usher, primed with ginger beer,
Surmounts the yawning bunker and lies clear.
I see a member of the House of Peers
Within an ace of bursting into tears,
When, after six stout niblick shots, his ball
Lies worse than if he had not struck at all.
But some in silent, agony endure
Misfortunes no "recovery" can cure,
While others, even men who stand at plus,
Ixmdly ejaculate the frequent cuss.
An aged Anglo-Indian oft I see
Who waggles endlessly upon the tee,
Causing impatience of the fiercest kind
To speedy couples pressing from behind.
Familiar also is the red-haired PAT
Who plays in rain or shine without a hat,
And who, whenever things are out of joint,
"Sockets" his iron shots to cover point.
Before ten thirty, also after five,
The links with lady players are alive,
At other seasons, by the rules in force,
Restricted to their own inferior course.
One matron, patient in her way as JOB,
I 've seen who nine times running missed the globe;
But then her daughter, limber maid, can smite
Close on two hundred yards the bounding Kite.
Dusk falls upon the bracken, bents and whins;
The careful greenkeeper removes the pins,
To-morrow being Sunday, and the sward
Is freed from gutty and from rubber-cored.
Homeward unchecked by cries of "Fore !" I stroll,
Revolving many problems in my soul,
And marvelling at the mania which bids
Sexagenarians caracole like kids;
Which causes grave and reverend signiors
To talk for hours of nothing but their scores,
And worse, when baffled by a little ball,
On the infernal deities to call;
Which brightens overworked officials' lives;
Which bores to tears their much-enduring wives;
Which fosters the consumption of white port,
And many other drinks, both long and short.
Who then, in face of functions so diverse,
Will call thee, golf, a blessing or a curse?
Or choose between the PRF.MIRR'S predilection
And ROSEHERY'S deliberate rejection?
Not mine to j udge: I merely watch, and note
Thy votaries as they grieve or as they gloat,
Uncertain whether envy or amaze
Or pity most is prompted by the craze.
OUR FOOTMARKS COMPETITION.
(Witfe acknowledgments to the "Dally Express")
DETAILS are being rapidly arranged for our Footmarks
Competition, which has aroused enormous interest all over
the country. Our new serial, entitled "Criminal Feet, or
The Forged Footmark," will appear shortly in instalments,
and a prize of £1000 (One Thousand Pounds), or a house
per week for life, will be awarded to the person solving
the mystery of the murder of RALPH MONTGOMERY. As the
story runs its course, footmarks of very varying character will
be published as clues. By comparing all of these with each
other the reader will be able to discover the foot belonging
to the hand that slew Mr. MONTGOMERY, who, it should clearly
be understood, will be killed in the first instalment.
By this latter arrangement interest in the competition will
run high from the outset, and the comparisons of the foot-
marks are being looked forward to as interesting occupation
for the holidays which so many people are compelled to take
at this time of year.
For the guidance of those readers who have never so far
studied the theory of the subject, we shall first publish a
preliminary article by Messrs. RABBIT ANT> SKINNERS, which
will explain the various kinds of pattern which it is possible
for feet to describe, and a short method of distinguishing,
without measurement, a number nine, for instance, from a
number ten.
Competitors should cut out the footmarks as they appear,
and paste them in rows upon the wall of some convenient
room. In many cases the unsuitability of the footmark to
the hand that must have fired the fatal shot will be instantly
perceived. In such cases the footmark may be at once
discarded. Other marks, however, will require hours of
examination and comparison, sorting into types, and so forth.
The competition, we should explain, will be purely
scientific. There will be no trick in the narration. RALPH
MONTGOMERY, Esquire, will be really murdered, and the feet
of the hand that did it will leave an intelligible mark.
Remember that counting the toes and telling right feet from
left, although necessary proceedings, afford but slight clues.
The reason for the selection of a particular footmark must be
fully stated, and if more than one competitor sends in the
right footmark the thousand pounds will be awarded to the per-
son whose reason is most nearly right. The Editor's decision
on that and other points must be joyfully accepted as final.
FOR THE MENDING OF A BROKEN HARTE.
MR. PUNCH wishes to make an appeal for charitable
assistance in a specially distressing case. The object of it is
to restore to Miss BRET HARTE something of the health and the
means that once were hers in the lifetime of her father whose
works are as familiar as household words among all English-
speaking and English-reading people. Poor BRET HARTE—
alas, that the descriptive epithet should be absolutely true
in its primary sense—left his daughter totally unprovided
for. Her struggle for life has been a hard one, and she has
completely broken down.
The names on the Committee of " The Bret Harte Assistance
Fund," to select only a few from the list, i.e., GEORGE
MEREDITH, O.M., Sir GILBERT PARKER, M.P., Sir ARTHI R CONAN
DOYLE, ANTHONY HOPE HAWKINS and BEERBOHM TREE, are in
themselves a guarantee for the genuineness of the case.
"And to whom shall we send our subscriptions?" ask the
generously-minded intending donors. Mr. Punch gives the
address of the Honorary Secretary to this Fund, Dr. L. C.
ALEXANDER, Holly Lodge, Upper Parkfields, Putney, S.W.
May this case, "heard on appeal" by generous and discrimi-
nating judges, result in a decision that will be of the greatest
benefit to the late BRET HARTE'S invalid daughter whose cause
Mr. Punch pleads.

How from England's Christian strand
Sailed away AUGUSTUS SORREI.L
On a mission to the land
Of the poor, degraded, low.
Walrus-hunting Esquimaux.
When he saw their houses fashioned
Out of whalebone, furs and skin,
SORRKI.I. wept, for his impassioned
Soul was grieved for those within;
For the unenlightened, low,
Blubber-eating Esquimaux.
When he saw their poor condition,
Sad his heart within him grew;
"SoRREU.'s Patent Composition
Is the very thing for you."
Thus he spoke to these same low,
Whale-devouring Esquimaux.
"I will build you better dwellings
Than the huts in which you live,
Where the skins have divers smellings,
And the hides no comfort give;
You shall be no longer low,
But enlightened Esquimaux.
"And lest you should be encumbered
By the whalebone and the hides.
Under which of old you slumbered
When you had no homes besides.
When you still were vulgar, low,
Hovel-dwelling Esquimaux;
"I will take your bone and bearskins,
Though at very great expense.
For no longer will you wear skins
You have too much common-sense."
Thus he played iipon the low,
Poor, transparent Esquimaux.
But the winter came and shattered
BoBHU/8 houses to the core,
Then the winds the fragments scattered
All along the frozen shore
Of the more than ever low,
Hungry, homeless Esquimaux.
Then they hunted for the mission;
"Take again," they would have cried.
"SORRELL'S Patent Composition;
Give us back our bone and hide.
These are best for simple, low,
Poor, eccentric Esquimaux."
But their SORKF.I.L now was sailing
Back to England's Christian strand,
And he reck'd not of the wailing
Lifted from the heathen land
Of the poor, degraded, low,
.Simple-hearted Esquimaux.
And he made a famous corner
With his whalebone thus acquired,
And like JACK (his surname HORNED)
Took the plum he so desired,
Paying nothing to the low,
Greedy, grasping Esquimaux.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 24.
—" Such larks!" as Joe Gargery used
to say to Pip.
House crowded in anticipation of
PBINCE ARTHUR'S declaration as to what,
regardless of personal considerations,
having his eye solely on the interests of
the Empire, he intends to do in view
of Thursday's division, which placed
Ministers in minority of 4. Never since
this Parliament was called to Westmin-
ster has the House been so crowded.
Every seat occupied, Members overflow'
into the side galleries, stand at the Bar,
sit on the Gangway steps, cluster round
the Chair. Peers fight for places in
their gallery us if they were pittites
waiting for the opening of the Theatre 1
doors on a popular play. In the person
of their Ambassadors the Old \Yorld
and the New looked down upon the j
scene from the Diplomatic Gallery.
Pending the opening of the proceedings
a buzz of excited conversation rose
through the sultry air.
At the outset a difficulty presented
itself. Speeches may be made in the
House only upon some definite motion
submitted from the Chair; exception
made in case of personal statement.
Tliis afternoon PRINCE ARTHUR might
speak, and, by favour of House, C. B.
in his capacity of Leader of Opposition,
might follow,
could arise.
But no general debate
PRINCE ARTHUR, secure
of a majority, anxious to see the thing
out and retrieve Thursday's fall, was
eager for opportunity of division. Ac-
cordingly put up the Pis'K 'UN to move
adjournment, and begged Opposition to
be so good as to vote against it.
Then came the speeches, a procession

Tuesday, 11 P.M.—WALTER LONG, at
close of sultry day, morning and evening
discussing Irish Estimates, throws his
arm over back of bench, turns his head
away from his companion in adversity,
the Irish ATTORNEY-GENERAL, and thinks
wistfully of inquiry made with delicate
iteration sinceYThursday last, Why he
doesn't resign? It may not be kindly
meant; it comes from suspicious quarter.
But it opens up a pleasing prospect that,
brings a flush of pleasure to his pallid
cheek.
Why did he leave the pleasant pas-
tures of the Board of Agriculture, passing
through the portals of the Ix>eal Govern-
ment Board, to tread the hot pavement
of Dublin Castle? He who once walked
through the ripening cornland hand in
hand with Ceres, was now condemned to
listen to JOHN DILLON by the hour.
When, this afternoon at end of first
half ho\ir he, in moment of despera-
tion, furtively fared forth, a roar of
execration rose from the Nationalist
Benches, and he was brought back in
chains.
The domination of the minority is
merciless. A while ago one of them,
having a difference of opinion witli a'
certain jury, described it as perjured.
That passed without remonstrance in the
Irish camp; nay, it was cheered. But
when ATKINSON, most amiable of men,
resented the statement as "scurrulous,"
the Irish Members, anxious above all
things for decency of debate, moderation
of language, insisted on withdrawal of
the term.
At this hour, ninth of the sitting, with
hurried interval for dinner, Mr. KILBRIDE
is offering a few remarks in almost empty
House. Their drift not quite clear; but
judging from athletic performance of
delivery they must be portentous.
ATKINSON, dropping sleepily into old
habit when he was a junior in court,
makes a note of the phrases that reach
his ear amid thunder-clap of fist smiting
open pnlm. It reads thus: "Men are
in no sense often so. One was a successf id
butcher, and there was a daughter who
might have been more respectful to their
neighbour. Of all people living in the
west of Ireland there is not a genuine
resident. The difficulty of teaching is
not overcome by the tyranny of Dublin
Castle. What we want is that you should

leave to Irislimcn the land intended for
them."
Here Mr. REDDY burst in with the
cheer that never fails to bring down the
House. There is nothing like it on sea
or land, unless it be the cackle of a hen
when it has laid a superlative egg. It
has not necessarily anything to do with
a stage reached in argument or a point
made in a speech. As a rule effect is
added by absolute inconsequence. A
man may be droning along, sleepily say-
ing nothing in many words; suddenly a
shrill high-noted "Hear! hear! hear!"
breaks forth, followed by a roar of
laughter. The humour is monotonous,
threatening to pall by constant repetition.
It never does. There is an indescribable
something in the shrill cry that makes
it at the end of the Session as fresh as
in its opening days, as irresistible as if
it was heard for the first time.
Just now it stirred WALTER LONG from
his exceeding dolour; relief only tem-
porary. He relapsed when an Irish Mem-
ber, more luminous, and therefore more
commonplace than KILBRIDE, took up the

Friday night.— Complaints have, it is
reported, been received from domestic
circles within the radius of Westminster
of Pa suffering a shock detrimental to
one at his time of life. Going home
after a moderately good dinner, throw-
ing a glance up at Westminster clock
to reassure himself that lie is in good
time, he has seen—or believed he saw
—the face suddenly turn green!
Reassurances have been courteously
sent. It is all right; no illusion what-
ever. By way of signalling pending
division to Members making their way
down to the House, the face of the clock
is deliberately sicklied o'er with pale
cast of green. Experiment worked so
well that proposal made to extend it.
Colonel LEGOE, of course, belongs to the
Land Forces. But he hasn't been aboard
the L. C. C.'s river steamboats for
nothing. To begin with, he paid a
penny; in supplement, being an ob-
servant man. he obtained information
that enabled him to suggest to First
Commissioner of Works that, a green
light being shown on the starboard face
of the clock, a red light should simul-
taneously glow on the port side.
In other quarters doubt arises as to
whether the First Commissioner has any
business to deal with the clock face. Is
the structure within his jurisdiction?
Members have heard about committal to
the Clock Tower in custody of the
Serjeant-at-Arms. If the Tower is under
his rule what does the First Commis-
sioner of Works mean by walking up the
steps with a can of green paint under
his arm and touching up the face of the
clock?
BALCARRES, representing the depart-
ment in the Commons, is happily able
to explain away the apparent difficulty.
It is true, he says, that there is a small
compartment in the Clock Tower upon
occasion at the disposal of the Serjeant-
at-Arms. But it may be occupied only
by the courtesy of the First Commissioner.
The Tower is his, and he may paint the
face of the Clock any colour he pleases.
Re-assured on this constitutional
question, Members, with the exception
of C.-B., who it is well known has rooted
antipathy for the weakness, go off a-
week-ending.

DURING the hot weather the human

after the disaster, a well-known expert
who happened to be an eye-witness
said—
Well, to resume about the pheno-
menon of what is called thirst. Alcohol
should be avoided. So should lemonade,
orangeade, and marmalade. First-aid,
on the contrary, should always be
obtained at once when necessary.
The best drink of all is hot tea. This
should be drunk scalding hot in order
to obtain the best effects. It will
increase the flow of perspiration which,
evaporating, will cool the body. In
fact, arguing on this basis, you will see
that the hotter you get the cooler you
grow. Every " A Physician" is agreed
on this point.
The only admissible drink besides tea
is sparkling spring water taken in a
crystal tumbler straight from the spring.
Londoners should make an especial note
of this.
Putting it in tabular form in ounces,
we arrive at the following as being the
best liquid refreshment allowance for a
hot dav:
Scalding tea.
Spring water
14 OZB.
Total ... 26 ozs.
Turning to food, we find on consulting
our back files that food is taken for the
purpose of maintaining the heat of the
body. A little thought will show us
that, as the body is naturally hotter in
the summer than in the winter, less of
this fuel is required in August than in
January. Meat should be eaten in
moderation with a fork. For an indolent
man nine ounces of meat is sufficient at
this season of the year. Game, also,
should be partaken of sparingly. Even
grouse should be avoided altogether
before about August 12th. As to vege-
tables, these, unlike tea, are not so
cooling when taken hot. About 14^
ounces is a good average allowance, but
scarlet-runners are best left alone during
the hottest summer months.

AT A TEST MATCH.
"On, the referees always wear white
coats," I heard PHYLLIS say to CYNTHIA.
I had taken PHYLLIS to a football match
in the winter. She is an eminently
adaptable girl.
"But there must be some reason for
it." persisted CYNTHIA, turning to me.
CYNTHIA is a girl who knows nothing
about anything, but she knows it so
charmingly that one invariably forgives
her.
"You are quite right," I assured her,
"there is a reason. Their white raiment
is popularly supposed to reflect the
purity of their souls."
"But they 've got black trousers," she
demurred.
"No man is absolutely spotless," I
reminded her.
As she sat considering the point, the
Australian team made —
their appearance from
the pavilion.
"A nice level lot," re-
marked PHYLLIS criti-1
tally.
"'Oh, well caught!"
exclaimed CYNTHIA, as
I>ARLIN<; gently tossed
the ball to one of the
team some twenty yards
away.
PHYLLIS smiled
serenely On her com-
panion.
"A clever piece of
work," she assented,
"but then you must
remember that TRI:MPER
has the safest pair of
hands in the world,
though SYD CLEM runs
him fairly close."
I shuddered in-
voluntarily. With PHYLLIS so many
things are possible. She had evidently
been reading the evening papers.
"Who are these two ?" asked CYNTHIA,
as the first pair of English batsmen
walked on to the field.
Being rather short-sighted, I drew a
bow at a venture.
"It looks like JONES and TYI.UESLEY,"
I said.
"Yes," supplemented PHYLLIS proudly,
"the Sussex crack and the Yorkshire
giant,"
"But they both seem quite middle-
sized men," objected CYNTHIA.
For a moment PHYLLIS looked almost
confused. But I came to the rescue.
•' In the world of cricket," I observed,
"it is considered complimentary to refer
to anyone over five foot one as a giant."
CYNTHIA drew a deep breath of wonder.
"How delightfully quaint!" she
sighed.
At this point a disagreeably accurate
person sitting close behind us volunteered
the information that the batsmen in
question were MACI.AREK and HAYWAHD,
and that JONES was not playing.
"Ah no, of course he isn't," T said.
"I renembr-r now his saying it was
unlikely he would play."
"How interesting !" observed PHYLLIS.
"Do you really know JONES?"
"We were boys together," I answered
guardedly. The person behind sniffed
in a distressingly vulgar manner, and
remarked that the statement was equally
applicable to himself and the Prince of
WALES. But I ignored him.
"Oh, what a shame!" cried CYNTHIA.
One of the batsmen had just been
bowled by a leg-break. "I thought
HOPKINS would soon get him," said
PHYLIIS. "HOPKINS is one of the trickiest
trundlers on the planet. He bowls with
his head, and mixes 'em up a bit."
rose from my seat, determined that we
would no longer remain exposed to the
crude shafts of his plebeian wit,
"I think it. is time that we eec-ured
places for luncheon," I said.
The girls acquiesced readily.
As we moved away, the creature who
had rendered our morning so unpleasant
remarked that if we didn't look sharp
we should miss. the train, an irrelevant
observation which appeared to cause
several people in the vicinity a certain
covert amusement.

was quite merciless.
"HOPKINS isn't playing either," he said,
with an offensive chuckle.
PHYLLIS affected not to hear him, but
her face grew a shade pinker, and she
ventured nothing further for the next
half-hour.
Presently CYNTHIA, who had for some
time been watching in a puzzled way
the change in the field at the end of

moving about so?"
I was on the point of explaining the
phenomenon, when the person behind
again bent forward and said, " Well, you

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FATE OF LONDON.
(Being an Extract from a Political Geography
of A.D. 2005.)
. . . JULY 25, 1905, was a memorable
date in the history of the British Empire.
On that day it was pointed out by the
celebrated Dr. THOMAS GLOVEB LTON, in a
lecture on the Air Supply of London
before the Public Health Congress, that
a large part of the then metropolis was
unfit for human habitation. It was
further insisted by Mr. HoLix) RUSSELL
(who subsequently obtained the Order
of Merit for the idea) that the best of all
remedies against fog was the removal of
the people of London to the country.
The movement thus initiated very
speedily grew to a head, while there
were at this period many other causes
contributing to the dissatisfaction
of Londoners with their environment.
Among them may be named the exorbi-
tant demands of the rating authorities,
an excessive heat-snap coupled with a
plague of flies, the unmitigated party
mania displayed by the Mother of Parlia-
ments, and the chaotic condition of street
traffic.
The leaders of Public Health were
ably reinforced in their propaganda by
the Model Cottage Association and the
Directors of the Garden City near Hitchiu.
It so happened that a National or " Bank"
Holiday fell within a few days of the
closing session of the Congress—to be
precise, upon August 7th. In that fort-
night plans for an epoch-making exodus
were matured in hundreds of thousands
of Cockney homes, and carried into effect
upon a fateful^ Monday, the last-named
date, and the Saturday and Sunday
before.
Never were the railway stations so
thronged by excursionists, who, it was
noticed, on this occasion first brought
their furniture and family impedimenta
with them. The pressure was so great
that every goods train in the kingdom
was brought into requisition. It was
computed that over six-and-a-half million
people journeyed outwards in those
three days, the greater proportion in
open trucks. By dint of superhuman i
exertion and by the conversion of every
pair of rails into a "down" line, this
enormous mass of population was con-
veyed, with the loss of a very few thou-
sands, to various destinations outside
the county of London. Ninety percent.,
however, booked for Letch worth, the
site of the new Garden City and its
suburbs. In all cases single tickets
only were asked for, and not a soul
returned, except, it is said, Sir JOHN
POUND, the then Lord Mayor, to fetch
the City Mace, the Mansion House cat,
and one or two other belongings which
had been hurriedly left behind, and Mr.
J. BURNS, M.P., to have one more final

look at the beauties of Battersea. It
was thus that the new metropolis of the
British World-Empire sprang into being.
The rush to jump lands in Oklahoma
was a Sunday-school picnic compared
with this Babylonian removal.
Since that date, exactly one hundred
years ago, Letch worth - Hitch in has
gjne ahead, and has developed its own
particular brand of fog, which threatens
to cover the whole of the Midlands, now
conterminous with the capital. The
overcrowding question having been
happily solved by the enactment which
stipulated that each house should stand
in three acres of ground, the problems
of transit between suburbs two hundred
miles apart are still awaiting solution.
There is, indeed, a possibility after all
that London may have to be re-colonised
under an improved system of ventilation.
The original ground-landlords and their
descendants have long since disappeared,
their last representatives having taken
refuge in the workhouse. The Lower
Thames Valley, therefore, is practically
virgin soil, and before long will be
opened up to civilisation ....

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE announcement that Mr. SWINBURNE is also among the
novelists created an interest that will not be intensified
bv a study of his essay. To begin with, Love's Cross
Currents (CnATTO AND WINDUS) is not new. At the instance
of Mr. WATTS-DUNTON, to whom it is inscribed, the novel
was rescued from back numbers of a defunct magazine,
for whose death it possibly may not have been wholly
irresponsible. Opening with a prologue, painstakingly
genealogical, it is carried on by a series of letters—admittedly
an undramatic method. To that drawback is added a con-
fusing obscurity as to the identity of the various corre-
spondents. They are all related by blood or marriage, and,
casually introduced, my Baronite frequently found himself
constrained to turn back to the prologue, to make sure of the
identity of the letter-writer. If a fresh edition is called for,
Mr. SWINBURNE would do well to set forth on a single page
the names of his dramatis pcrsonce, as is done in books of the
play. As to the story, it lacks variety, inasmuch as it turns
upon two households in which love is, more or less openly,
quite passionately, made to the wife by a young kinsman. In
the end nothing comes of it all, not even a breath of scandal.
Mr. SWINBURNE, evidently growing tired of the work at the
very stage where a master of the art would have led to the
climax of interest, smooths everything over in a hurried
chapter, which leaves matters much as they were when the
scene opened. But the book is worth reading for two things.
One is the delightful study presented of that polished pagan
Lady Midhurst. The other is Mr. SWINBURNE'S glowing prose,
more beautiful than much verse.
In this collection, which is entitled The Devil's Derelicts
(DiGBY, LONG & Co.), the best story that its author, F. C.
VERNON HARCOUHT, gives us—far ahead of all the others—is
the first, "Big Jock Morrison." It is a real tragedy, told
with most grim humour. "The Vampire" is next in order
of merit. The second story, "Her Last Triumph," is
written in a kind of old-fashioned penny-dreadful style:
"' Pshaw!' she exclaimed, throwing down the pen," Ac.
Who ever heard anyone ejaculate " Pshaw !"? The ejacula-
tion rarely occurs in the work of any writer of repute since
the clays of ALBERT SMITH, who delighted in it. The author
takes us behind the scenes of the Theatre Royal, Melbourne.
The lead ing actress is in her dressing-room. "The prompter
came to ask if GLADYS L. were ready, as her entrance occurred
in a few minutes." Evidently T. R. Melbourne was badly
off for a "call-boy," and so the economical manager substituted
the prompter. A stranger, at haphazard, takes the place of
the suddenly invalided chef-d'orc.hestre, instead of the first
violin stepping into his shoes as, we believe, is customary.
When this newly-installed chef-d'orchestre sees the leading
actress, his "black brows corrugate into a sinister frown, and
the fierce, expressive eyes assume that fiery gleam which one
sees in the glance of the panther when he is about to
spring." Of course the panther's expression is a matter of
common experience. Another queer thing happened at this
queer theatre. From the stage-door " the commissionaire in
charge was absent, attracted from his post into the side
wings by the wonderful power of the divas voice." He
means "the wings ": the word "side" being amateurishly
superfluous. The writing of this story is of the high falutin'
order, and its plot one of the weakest. The other stories are
good; and I have already mentioned "The Vampire" as the
second best. The author, Mr. VERNON HARCOURT, should try
and effect collaboration with Sir CONAN DOYLE, who would
lend him Sherlock Holmes to help him out of some of his
mysterious entanglements.
This Our Sister (DiGBY, LONG & Co.) is a powerfully written
novel by Mrs. HAROLD E. GORST, of a literary type that may
be best described as " Zolaesque." It deals with the lowest
of the low, with the dregs of Ixmdon population. The critic,
unless he be an expert in such matters, which the Baron
does not profess to be, can only testify to the vividness of the
picture and to the impression of actuality conveyed to him
by the description of these terribly repulsive scenes. It
appears to the Baron that only the highest purpose of doing
good and of benefiting the most wretched could possibly
warrant the writing of such a book as this. Unless possessed
of such "extensive and peculiar" knowledge of London
hospitals as Mr. Weller possessed of its taverns, it would be
impossible for any reader of this story to determine the
particular hospital selected by Mrs. HAROLD E. GORST as the
subject of her painfully descriptive picture. By presenting
the scenes at the educational establishment kept by Mr.
Sffitecrs and family, CHARLES DICKENS drew public attention to
the existence of grave scandals in certain Yorkshire schools.
There was no particularisation, but the Baron believes that
an inquiry followed the publication of Nicholas Xiflileby, and
that the type of school indicated by the novelist soon ceased
to exist. Has Mrs. GORST founded this portion of her novel on
facts which have come within her personal experience?
CHARLES READE was ready and willing to back up his indictment
of certain prison systems in Never too iMle in Mend with
facts and evidence. Is such the case here? The hospital
is described at page \'2\ as "one of the most famous in
London." In this novel "with a purpose," there is scarcely
one character that is even naturally good, except the
miserable heroine herself and
an occasional female acquaint-
ance as wretched as herself.
Of course such a study of poor
human nature at its worst
could not be recommended for
mere amusement, but if the
perusal of this book may re-
sult in extending our sympa-
thies, in rousing us to earnest
action on behalf of "these our
brethren," then the Baron may
honestly recommend This Oar
Sister.

THE LAST TEST.
INTEREST in the suggestion that for the
last Test Match at the Oval the Selection
Committee should choose only men wlio
have not previously played cricket is
growing apace, and half a million letters
have readied Punch Office on the subject.
The suggestion was first made in this
paper by "X. Y. Z.," a gentleman well-
known in cricketing circles, though these
are not his actual initials. After stating
that we had already won the Ashes, he
pointed out that this idea of his woidd
inculcate in many a hitherto non-player
a deep and lasting love for the game,
while giving the Australians a sporting
chance of winning at least one Test
Match.
Among the many letters received this
week are the following:
One on the Nob for" X. Y. Z."
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—" X. Y. Z." is guilty
of an extraordinary misstatement in say-
ing that we have won the Ashes. Have
we? I deny it. It has been arranged that
the last Test Match is to be played to a
finish. Now suppose that the Austra-
lians win the toss and stay in until the
middle of September, when the cricket
season ends. It is obvious that in this
case the conditions of play (which said
distinctly that the filth match was to be
played to a finish] will not have been
complied with; thus rendering the
whole series of games nidi and void. It
is obvious, therefore, that the Ashes are
not won until the fifth test is over. It
is therefore obvious that "X. Y. Z." is
a fool. Yours, COMMON SENSE.
[We would point out to "Common Sense'
that " X. Y. Z." is not a fool.—ED.]
A Swj/jestion from Noricich.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—As "X. Y. Z." says
(by the way, can this be my old friend
GRACE ?), we have beaten the Australians
at cricket. Why not, then, let the fifth
Test Match be one at lawn tennis,
in which case I woidd recommend
FAIRSERVICE of Kent as the English
representative. Or perhaps a Bridge
tournament would be more popular.
THUMPER and ARMSTRONG could be the
Australian champions. ARMSTRONG would
be sure to have a strong hand at Bridge.
Meanwhile let us drink life to the LEES.
Thine, THE OLD 'UN.

charge of 1«. a word. Jokes in italics, 2s.— ED.]

SIR,—How can you discuss such trivial
questions as a cricket match when Mr.
BAUOU'R, in the face of repeated rebuffs
from all parties, clings in this miserable
way to office; when the Army is de-
nounced as being even more inefficient
than in 1000; when a life and death

on (lie lines suggested by "X. Y. Z."
Competitors should avoid giving im-
possible selections—such as Queen ANNK

BETWEEN the souffle and the ice,
When talk was running very small
Like little forage-hunting mice
Whose patter hardly counts at all —
You asked me, as a thing you vaguely pitied
(Noting the while another woman's gown),
Whether it bored me, when the World had flitted,
To stay behind in Town?
1 answered briefly, "No, it don't."
(My many candid friends agree
That it has never been my wont
To shine in oral repartee;
But only give me time and works of reference,
Those mental aids which Parliament permits,
And I ran l>e a match, with all due deference,
For Ministerial wits.)

That answer given a week ago—
It i.s indeed a desert land

But yet, believe me, there are consolations,
More than you might suppose.
Thus, while you fly to rural spots
(Like Cowes) and dress five times a day,
Our country cousins leave their cots
To paint the Town a rustic gray;
I love to see them sampling NEURON'S column
Or ALBERT'S elligy (a certain draw),
Giddy witli rapture tempered by a solemn
Touch of mysterious awe.

With Nature's moods to mate your mind,
You leave the finest, fairest flower
Of Town's intelligence behind ;—

From his employ of propping up the State
The Press that still composes masterpieces
Superbly up to date.
And One there is, a very god—
I 'd spoil my summer just for this,
To tread the dust his feet have trod,
And share the same Metropolis;
At other times there seems no special reason
Why he should occupy this earthly sphere,
But in the void of London's empty season
He is without a peer.

Imaginary scribes insist
Upon the right to air their views;

Clad in a cummerbund and pink pyjamas
At 80 in the shade.

You see that I can well afford,
Even when you are gone elsewhere,
To face the risk of being bored;

MR. GARY'S POST BAG.
[Mr. W. L. D. CART, the owner and practically the king of the Calf of
Man, who is a naturalised American, recently arrived at New York.
Mr. CARY is looking for an American purchaser for the island.]
THE Calf of Man is to the Jsle of Man what the Isle of Wight
is to England, what Tasmania is to Australia, what Sicily is
to Italy. When the Isle of Man was finished there was a little
bit over, and that became the Calf of Man. The popular idea
that the phrase refers to Mr. H.M.I, CAINE'S leg is a vulgar
error, fine though that leg be. (" He has a leg," is a well-
known Manx saying of its greatest son.) Nor has this Calf
anything to do with the same Master's L'roditjal Son, though
it took a first prize at Smithfield, and lias frequently received
honourable mention at the Agricultural Hall. The great veal
at Laxey was cut from it. For years it has been in the
possession of the CARV family, an ancestress of Mr. GARY having
perfected there the strain of fowls which are known as Mother
Gary's chickens all the world over. Many illustrious men
have visited the island, the visitors' book at the great house
including such names as Mr. GLADSTONE, W. BREARLEY, Lady
JONES, EZEKIEL WOODSTAFF (ex-Mayor of Bootle), &c. A work
entitled Hlyliicays and Byways in the Calf of Man has just
been rejected by Messrs. MACMILLAN, while the island is
among those which have not yet embraced fiscal reform.
No sooner was Mr. GARY'S intention made public than
thousands of offers and letters of curiosity poured in upon
him, so much so that a white steam motor-van has had to
take the place of the old hand-propelled barrow in which
the post of the Calf of Man has hitherto been carried within
human memory.
Among Mr. GARY'S most interesting letters are the fol-
lowing :—
FROM MR. BALFOUR'S PRIVATE SECRETARY.
The Prime Minister wishes to ascertain what is the popu-
lation of the Calf of Man, and what are their views on
questions of the day. Also, is there good knee-room for a
tired statesman, and would the purchaser have absolute
rights to refuse landing to strangers? There are certain
persons whom ho desires not to sec or hear again for some
centuries, and unless he is assured of no danger of attack
from them he would not proceed with the negotiations. An
early reply will oblige.
FROM SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN'S PRIVATE SECRETAJIY.
Sir HENTIY CAMPBELL-BANNEUMAN instructs me to write to
inquire the price of your island. He is just now looking
out for a quiet spot where he can at last be an absolute
leader, and the description of your property promises well.
He is prepared, if that will influence your reply, to change
his name permanently to Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-CALFOMAN.

SIR,—You have an island for sale. I am a buyer of islands.
Not only inlands but deserts too. Anything in fact. What
is the price? You have but to name it. Address me at the
Cecil, where I shall be arranging for my Calf of Man
Viceroy and standing army. JACQUES.

(Cable.)
Beg offer Free Library to Calf of Man inhabitants. Had
no idea island existed or would have made offer before.
FROM MR. MARMADCKE CROCK.
SIR,—I have for some time past been looking for a quiet
place where I could practise putting and driving, and so far
as I can see your island is just the spot. What do you want
for it per ann.? I am not rich, and I should prefer to rent it
on a lease—not repairing. I am a very careful man, and
should hand it over in perfect condition at the end of the
time. I shall take "BARTON'S book with me and reallv work
hard, for at present I arn quite the worst player on our (the
West Frognal) links. Yours faithfully,
MARMADUKE CROCK.
FROM A FAMOUS NOVELIST.
SIR,—I trust you will not adhere too strictly to your
intention of selling the Calf of Man to an American. An
island so near England should be offered first to an
Englishman or an Englishwoman. My home at Stratford-
on-Avon, although charming, furnishes none but municipal
breezes, and I often find myself pining for sea-air and that
seclusion which it ia difficult for a fellow-townswoman of
SHAKSPEARE to obtain. Please let me know what you are
asking for your island with the indelicate name (which can,
however, quickly be altered), and I will let you know my
decision. I see a great future for the islanders in strong
Christian hands, and I, at any rate, if I once undertook to
govern, would never shirk the task. In time, who knows but
we might influence the Isle of Man itself for good?
Awaiting your reply, I am, MARIE CORELLI.
To players not selected for the final Test Match we recom-
mend the popular ditty: "Airit I no use, Mr. Jackson?"j

DAINTY ANIMALS.
THE correspondence in the Spectator
on the subject of fastidiousness in
animals having proved too copious for
the columxs of our contemporary, a
large number of letters have ricochetted
into Mr. Punch'.? offices, a selection from
which he has the pleasure of now laying
before his readers:
Sin,—Daintiness in animals is not, as
some of your contributors would seem
to think, the exclusive monopoly of
mammals. Some twenty years ago a
maiden aunt of my first wife's who lived
at Arcachon kept a pet oyster in a salt-
water fountain, and used to feed it
on condensed milk and cracknels. This
interesting crustacean, which used to
answer to the name of Mark Antony—
a delicate reference to CLEOPATRA'S
notorious fondness for bivalves —was
singularly tame and friendly, but on one
occasion my wife's aunt inadvertently
gave it a macaroon instead of a cracknel.
Incredible as it may seem, Mark Anton;/
was so incensed that lie bit the hand of
his benefactress and remained in sulky
seclusion for nearly twenty-four hours.
His mistress never got over the shock,
gave up her villa at Arcachon and died
shortly afterwards at Schaffhausen, after
an operation for cataract. My first wife,
I need hardly add, has also departed
this life, but I have been unable to
ascertain what became of Mark Antony.
I am, Sir, &c.
CAVALIEKE MONTE Rosso.
Hotel Pupp, Karlsbad, DoJiemia.
SIR,—Your interesting article on the
subject of dainty animals prompts me
to send you the following biographical
notes on my dog Li-Poo, whose great-
great-grandfather, an Imperial Chow of
the purest strain, formed part of the loot
of the Summer Palace in 1800, and was
brought home by my father, Captain
TALIJOY, R.N. Li-Poo is now about nine
years old, and on my coming to reside
at Hoylake in 1901 at once took the
keenest interest in golf, and was very
quickly initiated into the mysteries of
the game and trained to act as a caddie.
The authorities at first protested, but as
my handicap is one of the highest in the
Royal Liverpool Club soon withdrew
their objections. What, however, I wish
to point out is that, although thoroughly
Anglicised in all his ways, Li-Poo still,
in one important particular, illustrates
the old saying, cochiin tion animnm.
Nothing will induce him to make any-
thing but a Chinese tee. Mr. JOHN
BALI., Mr. HAIIOLD HII.TOX, and Mr. JOHN
GRAHAM have all in turn tried to
break him of this habit, but in vain.
Personally I have come to prefer it to
any other variety, especially with a slice
of lemon, and since adopting it have
been almost entirely free from the in-
somnia from which I have suffered inter-
mittently since I was an undergraduate
at Balliol.
A propos of Oxford I may perhaps be
permitted to add that my son, who was
awarded a half-blue for Archery, and
rowed the longest bow on record in his
college eight, has just written to me
from Cape Colony to say that he has
started a polo club in which all the
members are mounted on ostriches. The
game as thus played is, he assures me,
far faster and more exciting than when
ponies are used. Unfortunately the
ostriches have a way at times of suddenly
swallowing the balls and even the polo
clubs, which causes a difficulty in keep-
ing the score. I am, Sir, &c.,
A. LEGGE PI.*LI.AR.
The Cfioicbents, Hm/lake, Cheshire.
SIR,—When I was quartered at Maza-
wattee in the Never Kever Land shortly
before the Crimean War, my constant
companion in my hunting expeditions
was a remarkably intelligent black-aml-
tan Tasmanian tiger-cat. Owing to the
length of its whiskers I christened it
Lord Dundreary and taught it the use
of fire-arms, as our camp was constantly
being sniped by the aborigines who
abounded in the vicinity, and were very
dexterous in throwing the boomerang.
But the curious thing about my cat was
this, that although an adept in the use of
the rifle he was never really happy until
I presented him with a Mauser pistol,
with which he attained a proficiency
little short of miraculous. On my return
to England I presented the faithful
animal to Sir HARRY PAIIKES, in whose
service he remained till his death. My
only other experience of this fastidious-
ness in animals was in the case of an
Edinburgh Rock Pigeon, which took
snuff freely, but had a rooted objection
to Virginian tobacco, which invariably
heightened the pitch of its coo.
I am, Sir, &c.,
Vf. GREENER.
P.S.—I forgot to mention that a
brother officer of mine, who was after-
,vards killed in a cab accident at Picca-
dilly Circus, had a pet Southdown sheep
which would eat Neapolitan ices, but
bad an invincible antipathy to red
urrant jelly.
SIR,—When engaged on the compila-
tion of my History of llic Mongols I had
a pet dwarf Mammoth who rendered me
invaluable assistance in the sifting and
sorting of materials, which he was able
lo pick out of their pigeon-holes with his
trunk with extraordinary rapidity and
precision. As he was about 3,000 years
old and possessed a remarkably retentive
memory, I need hardly say that his local
snowledge greatly contributed to the
value—if any—of my momentous under-
taking. Yet such was the modesty and
aversion from publicity evinced by this
massive and faithful collaborator, that
not only did he refuse to allow me to
place his name on the title-page, but
would not even consent to my mention-
ing it in the Preface. In politics he
was— I regret to have to use the past
tense, but he died prematurely after
inadvertently eating several croquet
balls, which he mistook for suet dump-
lings, his favourite dish — a staunch
Tory, and the mere mention of the name
of the Duke of DEVONSHIRE was enough
to excite him to transports of fury. His
place was filled by a fine Mastodon from
the Lena Delta, concerning which I
propose to send you some details in a
further letter. I am, Sir, &c.,
H. H. HOWORTH.
We much regret, in closing this
illuminative correspondence, to state
that we have been unable to print the
whole of Sir HENRY HOWOIITII'S interesting
letter, which extended to upwards of
3000 words, and contained a photograph
of the Mammoth, with Sir HENRY sitting
on its trunk.
CHARIVARIA.
IT is rumoured that the CZAR'S Govern-
ment is about to present a note to the
Powers asking whether the time has not
now arrived for partial naval disarma-
ment among the nations.
Meanwhile, very little enthusiasm has
been aroused in Russia at the news that
another of her battleships, which was
considered a total loss, has been raised
by the Japanese.
The Tteidisiliota asks that the Baltic
shall be closed to foreign warships. It
looks as if the Germans wanted to have
all the hitting below the Belt.
It is stated that China will submit a
large claim for damage done to her terri-
tory at the forthcoming Peace Conference.
It is unlikely, however, that her demand
will be taken seriously, as it is felt that
she should not have got in the way.
The Zionist Inquiry Committee has
reported unfavourably on the tract of
land in East Africa which was offered
to the Zionists by the British Govern-
ment. The territory is declared to be
infested by wild beasts and by dangerous
native tribes, who would regard Jewish
colonists as enemies to be harassed in
all possible ways. Their experiences
in Russia, where most of the Zionists
now tire, discourage them from this new
enterprise.

In connection with the forthcoming
visit of the British Association to Rhode-
sia, the British South Africa Company
lias issued a special set of stamps, the
design on which represents a view of
the Victoria Falls. The proposal that
the stamps should bear the legend,
"What a Fall was there, my country-
men !" was vetoed at the last moment as
smacking too much of advertisement.
A thief who broke into the Central
Schools at Scarborough last week stole
five Bibles, and a reader of the Dnilif
Mail writes to ask, "Should clergymen
criticise him ? "• _
A venerable burglar of eighty-two
made his appearance in the North Lon-
don Police Court the other day. It is
not, we believe, generally known how
the infirmities of age handicap the mem-
bers of this profession. At the portico
of a house in Kensington Park Gardens
there are two life-sized dogs carved out
of stone. Not so long ago, on a dark
night, a poor housebreaker, whose sight
was beginning to fail him, spent over
two hours trying to poison these beasts.
A Kilburn gentleman mounted an
omnibus about fifty yards (lie wrong side
of a penny fare, and then refused to pay
the extra penny " on principle." He has
now had to pay the penny, and fivo
shillings costs. This, we suppose, is
what is known as principle and interest.
There is no satisfying some people.
Messrs. XEWNE.H have published an edition
of Gulliver's Travels at the moderate
price of one penny. A bookseller informs
us that a lady customer refused to pur-
chase it the other day on learning that
the price was net, and not subject to
discount.
Judge LUMLF.Y SMITH has, we think,
been somewhat unjustly criticised for
deciding, in a recent case, that claret-
jugsand vases are necessaries of marriage.
Family jars are, of course, an almost
unavoidable feature of the married state.
In fining a dairyman for selling milk
deficient in fat, Mr. DICKINSON said,
"Change your cows, and try a different
breed." The dairyman is now anxious
to meet someone who will take inferior
cows in exchange for good ones.
While taking notes of evidence at
Glamorgan Assizes, Mr. Justice PHIU.I-
MORE wrote with his left hand when tired
of using his right. Ambidexterity may
compensate to some extent for Justice's
blindness.

London waters. On Monday last, we
are informed, in St. James's Park a
youth landed a magnificent specimen
almost an inch in length, and its weight
was such that the bent pin almost broke
under its load.
The teaching of shooting in schools is
an idea which has been welcomed by
boys all over the country as being
calculated to cause them to be more
respected by their masters.
An immense impetus has been given
to the Teetotal movement by a report
just issued from the Government labora-
tory showing the large percentage of
proof spirit contained in temperance
drinks.
A man who sells matches at Hammer-
smith has only just received twelve
shillings as his share of the prize-money
earned while he was engaged in blockade
work during the Crimean War. We
understand that the Department re-
sponsible for the delay is known as the
Blockhead Department.
A connEsroNPENT forwards to us a copy
of Punch, nearly two years old, which he
discovered at the top of a mountain on
the now famous Whitworth estate. If
there is much more treasure of this kind
in these coal-fields we can well under-
stand the action of the German Syndi-
cate. They know they have got hold of
a good thing.

NATURE STUDIES.
THE ST. BERNARD PUPPY.
THT, St. Bernard puppy was busily occupied in a sunny
corner of the garden. He was a large fat soft ball of fur,
partly white partly tawny in colour, and he was just ten
weeks old. Though he had left his mild kind mother only
three weeks ago, he had entirely forgotten her existence, and
was perfectly happy as the favourite of a large family of boys
and girls who had given him the important name of Leo, and
devoted to the correction of his inadequate manners such
time as was not spent in petting him and feeding him.
At present, as I say, he was busily occupied in a sunny
corner of the garden. , After a time he was observed fey two
of his young mistresses, and was summoned to their imperious
presence. For all answer he wagged his tail rapidly and
proceeded very eagerly with his task, as if lie knew that the
time he would be allowed to spend upon it was getting short.
He was again called, but, having his own fixed ideas about
the beauty and necessity of obedience, he affected not to hear.
One of his mistresses approached him, whereupon lie turned
over on his back and waved his four paws deprecatingly in
the air. It was then discovered that the object of his absorb-
ing labours was an old and dirty piece of shoe-leather. On
being rebuked he rolled round, sat up on his haunches and
presented a paw to his rebuker. The leather was offered to
his gaze, but he looked at it with a distant and unrecognising
expression, and then by a swift and lumbering movement,
which was more eloquent than any verbal acknowledgment
of guilt, escaped into the neighbouring bushes.
From this retreat he was coaxed after a cautious interval,
and was then persuaded to cross the lawn to a spot where the
household cat was taking a morning siesta. The cat, an
ancient retainer who had seen and despised a long series of
puppies, and had in her time lived on terms of intimate friend-
ship with a retriever, paid no attention whatever to his
approach. This indifference appeared to annoy him, for after
considering her for a few moments he gave a short bark, and
then, pouncing heavily, attempted to bite her in the tail.
His punishment was prompt and his yells were piercing. No
dog, he seemed to complain, had ever been so profoundly
misunderstood before, nor had a disinterested tender of affec-
tion ever been so unworthily received. The cat, however,
blinkingly resumed her indifferent attitude, and the puppy
took refuge under a garden chair.
Hence he was carried towards the house, bearing on his
face an expression of angelic meekness and resignation.
Having been deposited outside an open garden window, he
was ordered repeatedly not to move, while his mistresses
went to an upper room for a biscuit. As soon as they were
gone he rose, and made a slow and painful ascent up the
three steps which led from the garden through the window
into the empty room. An inviting sofa was gaping for him,
and he managed after several falls to ascend into it. The
only other occupai t of the sofa was a book, and on this he
rapturously concentrated his attention and his teeth. Five
minutes afterwards he was discovered still hard at work, and
surrounded by minute fragments of literature.
Tliis incident led to another injustice, but was soon followed
by the presentation of the biscuit. His wounded honour
having thus been salved he was taken to a pond in order that
he might observe the water-lilies. The attraction proved so
great that he immediately fell into the water. He was rescued
by his scruff, and having been thus diminished to a tenth of
his former magnitude he was carried to the kitchen to be
dried before the fire and restored to his proper size. A bowl
of milk was given to him. He drank half, put both his fore-
paws in the rest and upset the bowl. After this he went to
sleep, and the cook and the kitchen-maid alternately fell over
him until lunch was ready.
LAYS OF A LONDONER.
ST. CATHERINE'S BY THE TOWER.
"A ROSE however named would smell as sweet!"
Such was the gist of Juliet's lucubrations,
A worthless sophistry contrived to cheat
The righteous anger of her near relations;
The language shows a nice poetic touch,
But can't be called an argument as such.
Not long ago I happened to devour
A tale—'twas lent me by a maiden aunt—
Bearing the name St. Catherine s by the Tower,
By AIXSWOKTH, or it may have been BESAST;
The local colour BO enhanced the plot
That I resolved to go and see the spot.
Primed with the pioneer's portentous zeal
I wended eastward by an early train,
And ultimately eased my labouring chest
Of sulphur in a place called Mincing Lane;
Twelve minutes' steady walking by the clock
Brought me in contact with St. Catherine's Dock.
"St. Catherine's by the Tower "—the name recalls
Visions of midlioned windows, gabled roofs;
Not, as in fact, a world of grimy walls,
And beery loafers and the clang of hoofs;
An air of calm repose—an old-world nook
Should have been there: it was there in the book!
Here was no haunt of peace, but din of wheels
Banging on cobble-stones that rang again;
Men roared aloud and urchins let off squeals
Hilariously, while down a neighbouring lane
Three large policemen stemmed a brave carouse,
Prising a wrathful docker off his spouse.
The Tower was there of course; one knew the place
Where as a child one earned an aching head
Gazing on armour, battle-axe and mace,
And furtively consuming ginger-bread;
Viewing the dungeon where without a doubt
Bad RICHARD snuffed his little nephews out.
It seemed imposing then; but now the Tower
Fades into insignificance beside
That triumph of the age of steel and power.
The Bridge that spans the river's thronging tide;
No old-world nook, one felt, could still be there,
Next to that huge hydraulic thoroughfare!
I passed inside the Dock, where winches creak,
And carmen bawl and donkey-engines groan,
And all the air is heavy with the reek
Of tea and tar and pepper and ozone;
And presently a porter, ripe with ale,
Struck me amidships with a heavy bale.
I turned away, and everywhere I went
Men viewed my presence with profound disdain,
And one low fellow caused some merriment
Saying, "'Ere's ALLY SLOPER back again!"
Even as I left, policemen bade me stand,
And searched my clothes for casual contraband.
A rose, I mused, though called another name
(A turnip, say), might haply smell as sweet;
St. Catherine's by the Tower might do the same,
If known as Shadwell or East Smithfield Street;
It is the intellect and not the nose
On which the name's deceptive charms impose!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

AN UNPARDONABLE MISTAKE.
Miort-sigltied Old Lady. "PORTER!"
THE GREAT HANDKERCHIEF PROBLEM.
DEAR Mn. PCNOII,—Knowing that you
are, and have ever been, the friend and
adviser of the distressed, he they old or
young, of the stronger or of the weaker
sex, I come to you for assistance in a
matter of paramount—I may almost say
vital—importance.
It concerns handkerchiefs. A paltry
thing, cries some scoffer, to bring to the
notice of one so august! Yet is it a
paltry thing? Has not the falling of a
lady's handkerchief decided ere this the
fate of many a male mailed warrior?
And is it less worthy of consideration
now that on it rests the tranquillity of
one of your most devoted admirers among
the fair sex? For I count myself still
among the fair, though my ag&—I may
breathe it to you—is forty-seven. You
will not, I am sure, refuse me a hearing
on a matter even so trivial as a handker-
chief. The question is, what am 1 to do
with mine when I go to Mrs. CATTLIXG-
TON'S Garden Party next Friday week?
You see, I intend to wear my pink.
It is not quite new, but the chiffon can
be pressed, and Mrs. WELLABY was only
saying to me the other day how nice it
looked. I had intended to wear my
reseda green with the orange yoke,' but
I wasn't quite sure alxnit it, because,
although it has always looked most
becoming, Miss BARKLET happened to be
at the dressmaker's (Miss TONKIN, you
know, at the corner), when I took it to
be turned, and, as I've repeatedly
remarked, you never can tell what Miss
BARKI.ET will say, and she says the most
horrid things when she likes. So, as I
was telling you, I was uncertain about
my green, though it's really the smartest
thing I've got, but after what Mrs.
WELLABY said about my pink my mind
was made up. The pink it was to be.
Now, when I first had my pink—not
so very long ago—I was particular to
have the sleeves made full large, so that
I could put away my handkerchief in
one of them. For as you know, or per-
haps you don't, the sleeve is the only
place left us for that purpose—the
fashions change so. Quite between our-
selves, I can. well remember the time
when we had pockets in our under-skirts.
After that came the pocket concealed in
a fold, which was always rather diffi-
cult to find, and awkward, especially in
a crowd, even if you knew the way to it.
Next came Dorothy bags—those little
ribbony things we carried on our
wrists. I went in for one, though I
must confess it was more to keep in the
fashion than because I liked them. They
looked stylish, but they soon went out.
Then we took a hint from our men folk,
who carried their handkerchiefs in their
cuffs, and ours reposed in our sleeves.
That lasted till quite recently. In fact,
here the mode only changed the other
day. You probably know better than I
when it changed in London, for down in
Pedlington Magna we have to look to
Lady MARKISH, the Squire's wife, who
generally manages a day or two in tovn
with her cousin some time during the
year, and this year she only did it last
week-end. I don't approve of this new
craze for week-ending, do you? It's
too much gadding about. Well, as 1
was saying, I'd decided on my pink
chiffon for the garden party when who
should I see coming down the street but
Lady M. icilh Jicr sleeves cut short to the
dhow.
Now I can easily shorten the sleeves
of my pink, for it's just a question of
picking out the insertion, and they will
practically fall apart. Five minutes will
do that, but—and it is here that I want
your advice—where am I to put my
handkerchief? With kind regards to
Mrs. Punch, Yours expectantly,
PRISCILLA PRIM.
PAX ETONEXSIS.— The Eton College
Volunteers will now, it is said, be dis-
banded, the time of WAUKE being over.

"BRADSHAW "?
FIRED by the example of the Dully
Mole, which has unearthed many opinions
on a similar topic, Air. Punch has plea-
sure in presenting the following borrowed
plums :—•
Sir OLIVER LODGE writes (without
mentioning porters):—To suppose that
our present edition is infallible and free
from criticism in the light of growing
knowledge is only possible to a person
of considerable ignorance. Indeed, the
whole notion of "infallibility " is essen-
tially a superstition, wherever it is to be
found; so that emendation and criticism,
from the point of view of historical and
linguistic research, ought to be welcome;
nor should any one be surprised if some
errors of fact, as well as a gradual
expanding of spiritual perception, are
found in that magnificent and venerable
but heterogeneous collection of poetical
and other inspired writings which form
the series of time-tables accepted as
canonical by travellers of the past, and
bound together under one comprehensive
name.
Mr. EUGEN SANDOW writes:—I have
only had to do with porters but once in
my life. That was'when three of them
fought for my liand-bag, in ignorance
that it held 18 cwt. of dumb-bells. I
settled the dispute by carrying the bag,
porters and all, to a cab —which broke
down. Since then I have done my own
porterage, and the profession, so far as
I am concerned, is out of work. It
seems to me that they may as well fill
in their spare time criticising Bradsliaw
as anything else.
Mr. JOHN POUTER writes: —The only
criticism I have to make on firrad»haw is
that it gives very scanty information
about horse-boxes. Personally I never
go by rail between two racing stables.
I always use a motor.
"TRAIN UP A WIFE," ETC.
A LAOT Manager of a "housewifery"
centre (in connection with public elemen-
tary day-schools) forwards the following
jewels from an Examination Paper:—
Q. Give rules for choosing a house.
A. Do not live near a semertery for
if you do the ground will crack in the
night and a gurm will come up into your
house and in the morning you will feel
very ill and the doctor will gay it is lead-
poisoning and there is no hope.
Q. What is meant by " Personal Clean-
liness?"
A. By personal cleanliness we mean
keeping pur brothers and sisters clean
and washing them every week and not
letting the little pours get tilled up.
Q. Name some common ailments and
their remedies.
A. Toothache.—Have it drawn but if
you are afraid keep it warm.
Corns.—Soak the feet thoroughly in
Strong soda water then rub them off
with pumice stone, do not cut them off.
Q. What is meant by a person being
"Thrifty "?
A. A thrifty person is strong and well
made and can eat a lotjand is never
hardly poorly. A thrifty person is'one
who thrives.
Q. Give rules for the feeding of
babies.
A. A baby should have nothing only
milk or it is liable to choke and not get
digested properly and it suffers great
agonies from the follies of its parents.

EXTRACTED FROSC THE DIARY OF TOBIT, M.P.

"A PRETTY KETTLE OF FISH."
Brother Arthur has but a poor " basket" to set before the Friars as the result of his long sitting. Brothers Henry and John do not
much relish having to sit up till past midnight to help him cook it.
House of Commons, Monday, July 31.
—" The measures are few; but where
are the Innocents?"
Thus C.-B. sternly addressing PRINCE
ARTHUR across the Table. Had just
accomplished the task that falls to lot of
Leader of House at this time of the year.
Cast to the wolves ten out of twelve Bills
promised in KING'S Speech. Twelve
little niggers; now there were two.
With that disregard of usage that vexes
soul of Opposition, ruffles equanimity
of C.-B., PIUNCE ARTHUR had not
even mentioned the abandoned Bills.
Customary for PREMIER, massacring his
progeny, to say a few words of pained
regret over their untimely corses. That
well enough for predecessors like DIZZY,
Mr. G., or even the ARTHUR BALFOUR of
last year. At close of another Session,
with temperature 82° in the shade of
Ministerial camp, 101° in irritated Oppo-
sition ranks, not disposed to say a word
more than necessary.
The thing presented itself in mathe-
matical form. Had he really promised
twelve measures in KING'S Speech?
Very well; if only two were carried, ten
must have been dropped. Q. E. D.
Why worry round their untimely tombs?
Let the dead past bury its Bills. The
thing to do was to wind up everything
so as to clap up the shutters on the 12th,
possibly the 10th.
At the end of seven minutes PRINCE
ARTHUR blandly surveyed the astonished
and angered Opposition, who began to
perceive he had a fresh surprise in
store.
"I have briefly, but I think ade-
quately," he sweetly said, "stated the
conditions with regard to the remaining
business of the Session."
"No!" roared the Opposition. He
had resumed his seat; nothing for it but
the raging almost inarticulate C.-B. to
rise and follow.
Then came JOHN REDMOND, "with all
the vehemence at my command" as he
diffidently put it, protesting against the
neglect of Ireland by the Imperial
Parliament.
"As far as Irish interests are con-
cerned," he shouted, "we might as well
have had no Session at all." Which is
a little invidious, considering the dis-
proportionate number of nights conceded
to claim of Irish Members for Irish Bills
and Irish Votes, not to mention daily
appropriation of one-half of the Question
hour. Next CROOKS and DON'T KEIR
HAHDIE, Codiin and Short of a Liter day,
tumbled over each other in effort to
show whom it might concern that lie
was the friend of the Unemployed.
At twenty minutes past seven House
crowded in anticipation of division. An
hour earlier the Benches being nearly
empty PRINCE ARTHUR thought time oppor-
tune for winding up debate. But DON'T
KEIR HARDIE, in character of Short, having
early in debate championed cause of the
Unemployed, Codlin CROOKS took his
turn, and in the excitement engendered
by the fervour of his oratory talked the

House into the dinner-hour. Result was
that at half-past nine, the Opposition
not again mustering and the PINK "Ujr
having marshalled his men with unusual
success, PRINCE ARTHUR moving the
closure got a majority of 101.
"A royal salute," said WALTER LONG,
gleefully rubbing his hands. "Quite
drowns the echoes of the pistol shot of
Thursday week. If division had been
taken at half-past seven we should have
been thankful for majority of fifty. In
the game of tactics our most valuable
friend is the enemy."
Surinam done.—Winding it up.
Agreeing after eight hours' debate to
make it possible to stick to work all
night, House adjourns twenty minutes
after midnight.
Tufsdtii/.—This is Sir WILLIAM
ARSON'S day. Education vote taken in
Committee of Supply. Duty of Parlia-
mentary Secretary to Hoard of Education
to explain and justify it. Occasion
looked forward to in domestic circle
with peculiar pride and pleasure. Hap-
pens of late ARSON lias loomed large in
Parliamentary debate and newspaper
controversy. Has become the most
quoted author of the age. This em-
barrassing to modest man; yet, when
first Bush of awkwardness faded,
useless to deny that it gives pleasure.
The favourite passage appears in his
masterpiece, Law and Custom of tin1
Constitution. He therein shows how
a Government which does not possess
the confidence of the country, has lost
its hold on House of Commons, but
nevertheless clings to office, is no longer
an authoritative body.
"It becomes," he severely wrote, "a
group of personages."
The luminous treatise in which this
gem is entombed was written some
years ago. Appropriateness of passage
to Ministry of to-day obvious. It is
what the Opposition Press and right lion,
gentlemen on Front Bench have been
saying at length for weeks. The joy of
the thing comes in when the dictum is
recited with ARSON blushing on the
Treasury Bench, one of " a group of per-
sonages" whom his prophetic soul dis-
cerned and recognised whilst still afar off.
On the frequent occasions when this
terrible indictment lias been trotted out,
ANSON has assumed far-away look, as if
he heard for the first time, on the
authority of anonymous writer, that the
Constitution had any Law or Custom.
To-day all is changed. He went to bed
last night humming to himself:
You must wake and call mo parly, call me early,
mother dear;
To-morrow '11 bo the happiest time of all the
glad New Year;
Of all the glad New Year, mother, the maddest
merriest day;
For I 'm to be Queen o" the May, mother, I 'in
to be Queen o' the May.
In prose he pictured himself as con-
fronted by House crowded from floor to
gallery, just as itwas the other night when
PRINCE ARTHUR announced that, in spite
of untoward circumstances, the group
of personages intend to go on govern-
ing the country as if nothing had
happened. Human desire to see in the
flesh a famous author would surely
prove irresistible. The only thing that
troubled the Parliamentary Secretary in
advance was apprehension that in-
dulgence in the idle curiosity of gazing
upon the author of IMW and Custom of
the Constitution might divert attention

The " Woolwich Infant" in Action.
(Mr. Will Crooks speaks up for the Unemployed
with rare humour and pathos.)
from the profoundly important topic
committed to his charge.
At the outset his anticipation seemed
realised. When he rose in a moderately
crowded House Members with one accord
also stood up. This not -unusual at
public meetings when popular orator
presents himself upon platform. ANI-'ON
drew his breath quickly; waited for
the cheer which, he understood, usually
accompanies such flattering demonstra-
tion. But what was this? Members
being on their legs, not only remained
erect, but made for the door. In three
minutes the place was a wilderness.
With the exception of ALFRED IATH-XTON
even the group of personages on the
Treasury Bench broke up and fled.
The Parliamentary Secretary to the
Education Board had prepared his essay
and must deliver it, even in the depress-
ing circumstances that surrounded him.
So he went on in level voice for the full
space of an hour, ALFRED LYTTELTON, who
likes slow lobs, gallantly seeing the
performance out. Business done.—In
Committee of Supply.
WHAT TO DO WITH OUR SOHS.
HINTS ON LITERATURE AS A CAREER.
WHY not? Here is a profession,
demanding small outlay of capital (even
a fountain pen am be purchased for
10s. Gr/.\ at which any young man
of moderate industry may secure for
himself an income such as a low-comedian
might not despise. At the time in
which we are fortunate enough to live,
the spread of popular education, the
encouraging circulation of the less expen-
sive magazines, and the publication of
such volumes as How to mal;c Monet/ by
Writing Stories, have happily removed
the literary profession from the narrow-
ing control of mere genius to the wider
activities of a recognised commercial
enterprise.
In this connection it is interesting and
valuable to learn that by an appropriate
diet the Literary Tendency can to-day be
developed to any requisite degree. It. is,
however, obvious that this process of
gastronomic culture, or feeding the sacred
flame, is as yet merely in its infancy.
Before long we may doubtless hope that
the researches of such scientific explorers
as Mr. EUSTACE MILES will enable them
to determine with accuracy the precise
foods provocative of various phases of
literary development.
It may then very possibly be discovered
that while an exclusive indulgence in
Tomato Nuts and Potsim Coffee will
result—as in the case of the author of
that charming little brochure, The- Hoad
t) Wellrille.—in a certain placid and
equable style admirably adapted to what
might be termed Farinaceous Fiction,
quite another diet is indicated for the
cultivation of more robust methods.
The phosphate properties of shell-fish
being already known, we believe that the
time is not far distant when the influence
of these comestibles upon modern litera-
ture (especially when taken late at night)
will receive scientific recognition.
Of the pursuit of letters as a re-
munerative industry it is to be observed
that there are to-day two great methods
by which a respectable competence may
be derived from literary work :—
By writing a Successful Novel.
By inventing a Hair Lotion.
The latter, however, is a process too
highly esoteric for discussion in a popu-
lar journal.
To write a Successful Novel yon will
require three things—plot, characters,
and local colour. With regard to the
first of these we would urge the novice
not to be unduly disheartened by the
failure to secure absolute originality.
After all, plots are bound to be limited
in number, and even should yours
resemble in outline some previous work
of—say—Mr. THOMAS HARDY or Mr. GEORGE
MEREDITH, you may always be consoled

by tlie reflection that the treatment will
probably l>e very different. The image
of Captain FRASER of JabLerjce fame
need have no terrors for you.
Note, by the way, that originality of
method is vastly more important than
originality of manner. A report that
his MS. is invariably written in a dark
room with luminous ink will in itself be
almost as valuable to the beginner as a
prohibition at Mudie's.
Having settled upon a plot, your own
or another's, you will next require
characters with which to work it out.
These you may conveniently take from
your immediate circle. Should the
book eventually be published, a few
hints as to the identity of its more
pleasing personages will greatly enhance
your popularity with the supposed
originals, so long as you are quite sure
that your models would approve the
portraiture. Thus your maiden aunt
may be highly gratified to have fur-
nished the inspiration for the beautiful
gipsy who elopes with the young Earl.
On the other hand she may not.
More important, however, either than
plot or character is the matter of local
colour. It is indeed a reliable maxim
that this last, if laid on thickly enough,
will cover a multitude of deficiencies,
and it is easy to understand that a scene
—say, the encounter of your hero and
heroine—which might be tame and even
fatuous in Balbam, becomes quite another
tiling in Bulawayo. It is of course best,
if possible, to obtain your local colour
from personal inspection, but, failing
this, a cheap and remarkably effective
substitute will be found in the free
employment of a vocabulary native to
the spot selected.
Thus, should you choose the Sahara
as your scene of action, the interview
might legitimately be introduced by
some such passage as the following :—
"They were alone in the Desert, that
mysterious Egyptian tract that had con"
verted a, gentlemanly ascetic into a rude
fi'Uali. In the leafy branches of the
palm-trees the Tom-Tom, or sacred cat
of the Nile, was wailing sadly. . . ."
Or, if in Siberia (very popular just
now, by the way), you could produce
your effect in a similar manner:—
". . . . The snow" (always a safe card
in Russian romance) " was falling heavily.
IVASOVHA threw a heavy dromik over
her shoulders, and went to the window.
Suddenly she perceived IVANOVITCH com-
ing towards her with hasty steppes. He
walked unsteadily; there was something
strange and almost drotehky about his
demeanour that startled her--
And so on; but we have said enough
to indicate the value of italics as a
method of localisation. A little practice
will enable the beginner to attain a
dexterity in the composition of such
tableaux that will astonish even those
most familiar with the scenes depicted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
POLICE PROTECTION.
STRANGELY near to the world of posters
and progress the quaint little town of
Brentford still flourishes under its stern
triumvirate of smells — quaint still,
despite the intruding trams that almost
bmsh the shoulders of its diminutive,
ancient shops. In that section of its
High Street where the predominating
smell is coal and gasworks there slum-
bers in the sun a little hostelry, dis-
tinguished from its ninety or so rivals
by its green sign and by the three dusty
plants in green tubs that stand before it.
It is hardly possible to look upon those
arid plants without being infected by
a sympathetic thirst. Evidently "W.
THATCHER, licensed to sell beor and spirits
to be consumed upon the premises," is
no mere horticultural enthusiast.
In any case the oool little haven, stand-
ing back somewhat from the street,
invites me strongly this blazing day in
August. Above the wire blinds that
shade the lower half of its tiny windows
I catch a glimpse of a number of gentle-
men of a coaly aspect engaged in the
operation of consuming upon the pre-
mises with unmistakable gusto. I cross
the street, and pushing open the door
marked PRIVATE BAR pass into an atmo-
sphere strongly charged with that
indescribable smell that pervades the
interior of rural inns.
A large slowly-moving man in shirt-
sleeves, evidently that same W. THATCHER
who is licensed to sell, &c., serves me
with cider; then, moving over to the
other counter, resumes his interrupted
conversation with the coaly gentlemen
in the public bar. I am left to marvel
upon the breadth of his back, a breadth
rendered the more striking by the fact
that a triangular piece of some dark-
coloured cloth measuring five or six
inches across its inverted base has been
let into the back of his light tweed
trousers, to keep pace with the encroach-
ments of advancing years.
Seating myself on the wooden bench
that runs round the wall, I fall to study-
ing a number of glass cases containing
the stuffed bodies of various yawning
fish, and a highly-coloured print repre-
senting the return of the wanderer in a
red shirt and riding-boots. From the
other bar comes the buzz of voices
dominated by that of a little woman,
apparently Mrs. W. THATCHER, who has
lately joined her husband behind the
counter, and would seem to be dilating
upon some grievance.
"'E comes in 'ere o' Saturday an' 'e
sez, 'Where's yer 'usband?' 'e sez—
like that. 'There's the coin,' 'e sez;
'that's the coin I offered 'im,' 'e sez.
I sez to 'im, 'You can get out of 'ere,' I
sez, 'ice don't want yer custom and we
don't want yer insulting'rernarks neither.
I know 'oo I am,' I sez, 'if some others
don't know 'oo they are"
It is very cool and pleasant in this
little place. I close my eyes and lean
back in my corner. The droning voice
of the woman and the occasional gruff
comments of her listeners merge into a
meaningless lullaby.
e «• « e
"The very coin I offered yer!"
Gradually I awake to the fact that the
continued reiteration of these words in
a hoarse male voice is becoming a grave
disturbance to my rest. I open my eyes.
Standing before the counter of the
public bar, regarding the landlord with a
defiant glare, is a short man wearing the
coating of coal-dust that is de rigueur in
these parts, and a soft felt hat of that
peculiarly shapeless species indispens-
able to the music-hall performer who
with its aid impersonates NAPOLEON, a
Nun, and Lord KITCHENER, and rejoices
in the title of Protean Artiste. In one
open palm lie displays a silver coin, while
with his other, clenched, he punctuates
his remarks upon the counter.
"That's the very coin I offered yer!"
lie declaims, "an' if yer don't believe it
there it is!" (Bang.') "Plain." (Bang .')
"Anyone can see it." (Bang!) "Large
as life."
The landlord, standing back a little on
his own side of the counter, with his wife
at Ids elbow, eyes him warily in silence.
Not so Mrs. THATCHER.
"You can get out of 'ere "she
begins with shrill volubility.
"That ain't Russian money," suddenly
resumes PROTEUS, with another resound-
ing blow upon the counter. "An' it
ain't Japanese money neither. It's good
money. English money."
It seems to me that his listeners do
not fully appreciate the patriotism of
this utterance. There is a growling
chorus of "Clear orf with yer," from the
coaly consumers upon the premises,
while Mrs. THATCHER, emboldened by
their support, waxes still shriller.
"We don't want yer custom," she
cries. "We know 'oo we are if some
others don't know 'oo they are. We"
"An" I know 'oo I am," rejoins
PROTEUS. "I know that's the coin wot
your 'usband refused ter take. There's
a pleece station in Brentford, and don't
you fergit it."
"There is a pleece station "begins
Mrs. THATCHER with falsetto emphasis.
"I 'm a goin' ter show that there coin
to a magistrit," pursues PROTEDS with
another bang. "I 'm a goin' ter take
out a summons agenst your 'usband fer
refusin' money under false pretences."
At this point Mr. WILLIAM THATCHER
suddenly approaches the counter, and
imposing silence with a wave of the
hand upon'his wife,*beginning excitedly
to state her own intentions in the'sum-
mons line, faces his aggressor. An
expectant silence falls upon the coaly
consumers.
"You 're a goin' ter take out a sum-
mons are yer? " he demands deliberately.
"I am," returns PROTEUS with gusto.
"You are, are yer?" presses Mr.
THATCHER with withering scorn.
"Yuss I am," repeats PROTEUS, meeting
his gaze with triumphant determination.
There is a pause while the two men
eye each other.
"Ho," eventually observes Mr. THAT-
CHER.
"Yuss," retorts PROTEUS.
Another pause as before.
"Well then, clear out," says Mr.
THATCHER.
"I ain't a goin' ter clear out," declares
PROTEUS loudly, with a terrific bang upon
the counter. "I 've come 'ere ter pro-
test, that's why I 've come 'ere. I 've
come 'ere ter demonstrate my right as
an Englishman ter receive beer in
exchange fer legal tender. I've come
'ere
He gazes about him as though at a
loss both for words and for adequate
means of emphasising them, then sud-
denly snatches up a glass and holds it
high in air.
"I've come 'ere," he declaims with a
final triumphant burst of oratory, "ter
demonstrate my views."
And he hurls the glass upon the floor.
Crash.
For a moment there is silence. Blue
veins appear upon the temples of the
landlord.
"Now yer know my views," mumbles
PROTEUS with a sudden cahn, and turn-
ing disappears through the swing doors.
In an instant chaos reigns. Mr. WIL-
LIAM THATCHER, purple with rage, throws
up the flap of the counter and dashes
for the door. His wife screams to him
to come back. The coaly consumers
stumble to their feet and tumble through
the door after the landlord.
I rise hastily and run out into the
sunlight.
Mr. WILLIAM THATCHER, restrained by
the partially encircling arms of two of
the coaly consumers, is struggling madly
for liberty and vengeance. A few yards
off, behind a massive electric lamp-post,
stands PROTEUS in a cautious and agile
posture, his hands grasping the post,
his knees bent and ready for any emer-
gency.
"Don't you be a fool, ole man," cries
the first coaly consumer, perspiring
freely as he struggles to maintain his
hold of his own part of the landlord.
"You ain't the man you used ter be."
"Not arf you ain't," gasps C. C. No. 2,
which I cannot help thinking, in view
of the silent testimony of Mr. THATCHER'S
trousers, is putting it rather mildly.
"You 've 'eard wot I 'ave ter say ter

would seem to put the
matter in a new and

recommend the idyllic picture thus con-
jured up to the able poster-designers

panies for the purpose of inducing the
adventurous to try their "Half-days,"
"Week-ends " and other excursions. The
restful ease with which the lotus-eating
cabman (hansom or growler) draws up
at the grass-grown courtyard of the
terminus; the deserted portico that only
resounds to the cooing of the dove and the
timorous tread of the rare explorer; the
Uip-van-Winkle-like janitor at the old-
world wicket-gate; the noon-day siesta of
the other occupants (if any) of this moss-
covered Temple of Peace - all these have
hitherto escaped the notice of the unob-
servant holiday-maker, but there! we
are just off to sample the same at
Victoria! The prospect, indeed, of this
approach to Eden is so alluring that we
expect to spend the rest of the day there,
if not the entire summer vacation.

THE IDEAS EXCHANGE.
ALTHOUGH the importance of the Idea as an article of com-
merce has already obtained some recognition, it has occurred
to Mr. Punch that there still remains a wide field for enter-
prise in this direction that is practically uncultivated. He
lias therefore established an agency in order that ideas which,
though valuable in themselves, cannot, owing to the circum-
stances of their thinkers, be converted to practical use, may
be exchanged for others of equal worth and greater suitability.
Appended are a few of the advertisements already received:

which THACKERAY concluded Vanity Fair. The story breaks
off at a moment that must be the turning-point in the lives of
Lady Betty and her husband, and leaves the interested reader
curious as to what will be the outcome of the most strange and,
it must be admitted, highly improbable scene that shows
the temporary re-union of this ill-assorted couple. Ill-assorted
indeed, for Lady Betty is a Burne-Jonesian woman, lovely,
artistically draped (always more or less in the limelight), and
of Anglo-ritualistic proclivities in the way of prayers to
saints, not to be found in the authorised Church of England
prayer-book, childishly delighting in private oratories,
decorated altars, crucifixes, and somewhat eccentric devo-
tions, all of which pious practices are not inconsistent
with this pure model of a wife falling in love with a heavy,
selfish, sentimental sot, to whose conversion from the error of
his drinking ways she has devoted herself; and of this
muddle-headed Lothario Lad;/ Betty's lawful husband, an
unprincipled but impressionable roue, becomes excusably,
nay rightly, jealous. Saint Elizabeth of London is the nick-
name cynically bestowed upon her by Society, which,
apparently aware only of the legend of the roses (which story
does not, it seems, appear in Acta Sanctorum), appraises her
piety at its true value; for " Society " intuitively perceives the
difference between real diamonds and paste, and Society's
experienced judgment is sound. Admirable is the authoress's
finesse as shown in her portrait of the half-converted toper
Sir Philip, who is a cad of the very first water, or rather
brandy-aud-water. The Lady Betty, "looking beautiful in
the French cambric girlish frock she chose " as the costume in
which to receive and preach to her lover, whom she permits
to "throw his arms around her" and to " bow his head upon
her breast" (" Thy weary head upon my breast "—old song),
while she stands "stroking his head with her hand," is,
at barely twenty years of age, a consummate coquette, dan-
gerous to herself and to those with whom she may be
brought into intimate relations. The character of Lorfi/
Betty is powerfully and remorselessly analysed by LUCAS
CLEEVE, who indeed spares none of her creations, being
cynically severe in her "living pictures" of such originals
as she has mentally photographed. But her readers will
scarcely forgive her for breaking off RO abruptly, as every
one of them, like the recipient of Sam Welters valentine, will
"vish as there wos more." True: but how does that Wellerian
sentence finish? Let it be given in its entirety :—" She '11
vish as there wos more, and that's the great art o' letter
writin'!" Substitute "romance" or "novel" for "letter,"
and there you have a tribute, in this instance, to the art of
LUCAS CLEEVE.

THE AUTOMOTORAMIG COMPANY,
LTD.
PROSPECTUS.
Capital, £100,000 in £1 Shares.
THIS Company is constituted for the
purpose of supplying a want long felt.
The senseless restrictions which legisla-
tion has imposed upon the speed of
motors promises to retard an industry
to which we look to maintain England
in the proud position which she has
hitherto Jield among the Great Powers.
Aqcordangly. the Automate-
ramie Company proposes to
acquire the inventions of
CLAYBVRY CANE-HILL, Esq., for
the purpose of affording real
sport for motorists, while
removing them from the vexa-
tious control of the police.
The risk of damage to cars by
bumping against things which
persist in getting in the way
will also he obviated.
The inventions relate to the
provision of a circular track
in the Company's own abso-
lutely private grounds, on
which there will be standing
room for a very large num-
ber of motors. On each side
of the track an endless pano-
rama of scenery, from the
brushes of our best scenic
artists, will be erected on
rollers. Motors will arrive
under their own petrol and,
on taking up positions, each
will be securely anchored
down. On the word "Go"
being given, the panorama
will be whirled at forty miles
an hour, while steam-driven
fans will supply an appropriate
air-blast, coupled with the
braying of fog-horns. In-
genious automatic contri-
vances will also disseminate
dust (on the principle of the
sand-blast) blended with the
smell of petrol in a state of
imperfect combustion, so that
all the essentialities of a
really enjoyable motor-ride at
high speed will be supplied.

IT is stated that a hundred Russian
(Imschkies are shortly to be introduced
into London, by way of protest against
the vagaries and 'inconveniences of the
present cab service. We are fain to
inquire if the drivers and their ways are
to come along with these engaging little
vehicles. If so, we shall witness some
minor comedies in the streets and on the
cab-ranks. One feature, at any rate, we
expect will prove popular. On account
of the inadequate support pro-
vided by the back of the
conveyance, it is within the
bounds of etiquette for a
gentleman to put his arm
publicly round the waist of
any lady whom he may be
accompanying. . At first, it
may lead to protests on the
part of Mrs. GRUNDY against.
Mixed Cab-riding; but doubt-
less we shall soon get used to
such a touching, simple cus-
tom. We cannot have ladies,
of any age or appearance,
falling out backwards when
the pavement is a trifle un-
even, or the izvostchik whips
up his horse too energetically.
Perhaps, also, the Muscovite
custom of bargaining for the
fare will be sanctioned by the
authorities. It will be a pure
delight to the onlookers to
watch the hirsute and thickly-
padded IVAN IVANOVITCH, late
of the Millionaya, S.P.B., de-
claring by all the wonder-
working saints that he cannot
consent to drive his client
from Charing Cross to Pall
Mall for less than five shillings,
and finally coming down to
four-pence. "Tea - money,"
too, to be promptly converted
into vodka or quass, will be
exacted by our enterprising
Vankas, to the great enlarge-
ment of the licensed victual-
ler's vocabulary.
At any rate, we await the

[To a Laity tcho axkerl the tcrilcr whether he Iclictcd in thought-reading.]
IN that most trying hour of all the day,
When hallowed custom claims this act of grace,
That men should throw the unfinished weed away
And join the ladies in another place;
When, torpid with excess of meat and drink,
In single file, a ludicrous procession,
We feel the mood of exaltation sink
Down to the nadir, point of worst depression ;—
Noting my apathy, you deftly sought
A likely theme to pierce the camal cloud,
And asked if I believed that human thought
Might by a special gift be read aloud;
I answered "Certainly; for by your look
That gift is yours and, if you care to use it,
My mind just now is like an open book,
And you are very welcome to peruse it."
That was my flattery. You read me wrong,
When you divined that in my vapid brain
One lonely thought revolved :—How long, how long
Before I get the chance to smoke again!
I had another, chastely held in check,
And it was this (for absence makes me bolder):—
I really rather like the way her neck
Goes with the pretty dip to meet her shoulder.
But, gravely,—you who probe the inner man—
I 'd not discourage you with cynic smile
From reading people's thoughts as best you can,
If they are legible and worth your while;
But here in so-called England you will find
This art of yours a thankless thing to follow,
For when you perforate our outer rind
You come on nothing but a yawning hollow.
\?oid of ideas, and vain of being void,
WTe eat and sleep and rise to play at ball,
Cocksure that we are far too well employed
To want to entertain a thought at all;
Tail must not think between (or during) meals!
This is our law; and, if it grew more lenient.
Conscience might trouble us with vague appeals,
And that would prove extremely inconvenient.
Thought, is the root of action, saith the Sage,
Which might include self-sacrifice at need;
Therefore, ere yet it reach the thinking stage,
We nip that noxious poison in the seed;
For, once the genii I mention makes a start,
We soon should hear wild talk about the Nation,
How each in Her defence should bear his part,
A thing too horrible for contemplation!
Such are the reasons why the race maintains
Its prophylactic vacancy of head,
And it would save you much expense of pains
To take the thoughts which aren't inside as read;
Indeed, dear lady, till our habits mend
And yield material for you to handle,
Thought-reading seems a game on which to spend
Only a very little length of candle. 0. S.

THE CRICKET OF THE FUTURE.
(Being an extract from the " Weekly Sportsman" of 1920.)
[" Plaving for averages bids fair to become the curse of cricket."
Daily Paper of 1905.
"What in the world do cricketers want with a tea interval ?"—Ibid.']
AN air of profound peace pervaded the Lord's Cricket
Ground on Monday morning when Wessex and Mudfordshire
began their annual six-day match. Had it not been, indeed,
for the usual sprinkling of insomnia patients on the Mound,
and the well-filled seats of the Pavilion, which has recently
been leased to Dr. BLENKINSOP as a rest-cure sanatorium, the
charming St. John's Wood enclosure would have been well-
nigh deserted. The apathy of the public towards this most
interesting match was all the more remarkable since it prac-
tically formed the climax to this season's race for the top
place in the batting averages.
Punctually at five minutes to twelve MACFADDEN, the Wessex
skipper, and SLOCUM, who fills a similar onerous position in
the Mudfordshire eleven, appeared before the Pavilion to spin
the fateful coin, both walking on tiptoe for fear of disturbing
the rest-cure patients. When it became known that MAC-
FADDEN, with, his usual perspicuity, had prophesied correctly,
a low murmur of applause arose from the members of his
eleven, who evidently did not relish the prospect of three
days of leather-hunting in the present weather.
A few minutes later SLOCUM and his men took the field, and on
BLAGROVE (average 87'05)and WILKINSON (average 85'3) emerg-
ing from the Pavilion to open the defence for Wessex, the
insomnia martyrs, who had been aroused by the excitement
incident to the decision of the toss, settled themselves down
for a nap.
It was obvious at once, from the caution with which they
approached their tasks, that both batsmen, intent on increasing
their averages, were prepared to take no risks. Finely though
JOXES and JAMIUCH bowled, they could make no impression on
their sterling defence, and when one o'clock brought the milk-
and-soda interval the score on the board still stood thus: —
\o. 1
0
Total.
0
No. 2.
0
Shortly after the resumption of play, SAUNDERB, as third man,
fumbled the ball, thus enabling BLAGROVE to open the Wessex
account with a single. This occurrence seemed to galvanise
WILKINSON into life, and he instantly began hitting out more
freely, scoring no fewer than seven runs in the next twenty
minutes. After this, however, the play quieted down again,
owing, principally, to the clever tactics of BLAGROVE, who, by
scoring a single off the last ball of each over, kept the bowling
entirely to himself, thus preventing his rival from further
increasing his average. The Sherry-and-Bitters interval at
1'40 found the two batsmen still in partnership, nor did any
change ensue during the play which occupied the last ten
minutes before lunch, when the score stood at
No. 1. Total. No. 2.
17 28 11
Soon after lunch WILKINSON created a considerable sensa-
tion by hitting the first boundary of the match, a neat glide
to leg, which reached the Mound railings before ARBUTHNOT—
who had been dozing on one of the campstools with which all
the outfielders are thoughtfully provided when WILKINSON and
BLAGROVE are at the wickets—was sufficiently awake to stop
it. This stroke provoked such a round of applause from
the solitary occupant of Block B. that Dr. BLENKINSOP was
obliged to send round a special emissary to check his
enthusiasm, applause from the spectators (or spectator) being
strictly forbidden by the terms of his lease.
As the gin-and-ginger interval drew near runs came more
freely, twelve being added in forty minutes, with the result
that the 50 went up on the board after three hours' play.
With a view to keeping them down, SLOCUM wisely decided

to put on TWADDUEB at the nursery end. As neither batsman
could hope to play TWADDLER'S leg-throws without running
some risk of being caught, they wisely left them alone, with
the result that the famous left-hander came out with the
following remarkable analysis :—

Tea was taken, as usual, at 4.30. and shortly after play was
resumed BLAGKOVE cleverly ran his partner out, thus getting
rid of his most formidable rival for premier honours in the
batting list. His action aroused some adverse comment from
the occupant of Block B., an old-fashioned gentleman who
seems to have been thinking of the time, ten years ago, when
to run your partner out intentionally was still considered bad
form. But considering that this modern development is only
a natural outcome of the keen competition for averages, we
cannot see that his ill-natured remarks were warranted.
[A hiatus in the account of this most interesting match
gives reason to believe that the example of the rest-cure
patients proved too much for our reporter. He does not take
up the thread of his discourse again until Saturday evening,
•when he writes thus :]
And so the great contest'between Wessex and Mudfordshire
ended in a very even draw. During the first three days
Wessex scored 3(J1 for the loss of seven wickets, and then
declared the innings closed. During the last three days the
Mndford batsmen, playing very bright cricket, knocked up a
total of 370 for six wickets. What would have happened if
it had been possible to continue the match for another fortnight
it is impossible to say. We cannot, however, refrain from
congratulating UPJOHN, the famous stonewaller, on his superb
120 not out, which, occupying as it did a little over fourteen
hours, eclipsed all his previous records for care and circum-
spection, and raised him from the fifth to the fourth place in
the averages.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHARIVARIA.
WE understand that some of the greet-
ings in French in our streets led our
visitors to believe that Esperanto had
obtained a greater hold over here than
is the actual case.
The Entente crops up in unexpected
places. It has been decided that at the
Russo-Japanese Peace Conference the
English and French languages shall be
used jointly, and the official minutes are
to be recorded in both languages.
As was expected, Mr. BALFOUR has
categorically stated in the House that
the Government were not responsible for
Lord EGBERTS' speech concerning the
unpreparedness of the Army for war.
Their responsibility is limited to the
unpreparedness. _
However, one did not have to wait
long for proof that Lord ROBERTS did not
exaggerate the danger of the present
condition of the Army. Two days after
his speech a .poem on the subject appeared
by Mr. AUSTIN.
An attempt is to be made by Mr.
HENNIKER HEATON to promote inter-
national brotherhood by the institution
of universal penny postage. It is good
to know that, if the Russo-Japanese
peace negotiations should fail, there
may still be this.
A sturgeon caught some time ago by
a fisherman near Goole was forwarded
to the KING in accordance with custom,
but has now been returned with the
intimation that His MAJESTY does not
wish to enforce his right; and the pro-
blem propounded by the Westminster
Gazette, "Can Fish Smell?" should now
be solved without difficulty.
Homes have been established in Ber-
lin for singing birds whose owners have
left them behind on their departure for
their summer holidays, and a bird of
good pedigree may now command an
entire suite of apartments.
We trust that the Poor Law Commis-
sion which is about to be appointed will
have power to consider whether some-
thing cannot be done in regard to the
poor law of the average Act of Parlia-
ment, through which, as a rule, the
traditional coach-and-four can be driven
with ease.
Now that the Law Courts have closed
for the vacation, we have been requested
to voice a grievance which is a very real
one. There is a growing tendency
among litigants, after an action has
been partly [heard and ] the public has
become thoroughly interested in it—
when, perhaps, it has reached its most
exciting stage—to settle the matter out of
Court. As often as not the Judge aids and
abets. We think that when a case has
once been partly reported in the Press the
public has a vested interest in it, and is
entitled to protection against the parties.
At a performance of "looping the
loop" in Hanover there was a praise-
worthy innovation. The vehicle contain-
ing the artist fell off the track among
the audience, injuring many of them,
while the performer was scarcely hurt.
This is undoubtedly the right way to put
a stop to the demand for these foolish
exhibitions.
"It is always a perplexing problem,"
says the Ladles' Field, "for a woman
to find out how to indulge in any of
our field or national sports and look
nice at the same time." The failure
which dogs the footsteps of female
hockey-players is peculiarly deplorable.
Where to send our cats during the
holidays is a problem which apparently
worries many persons. Meanwhile a
misogynist has written to complain of
the large numbers sent to sea-side
boarding-houses.
A dear old lady, on hearing that one
of our China battleships had broken
down on her way home, remarked that
we must expect such mishaps if we build
our vessels of that fragile material.
Some of our watering-places seem to
be waking up at last to the necessity of
offering increased attractions to visitors.
At Filey, last week, Mr. and Mrs. KESDAL
formally opened a water-trough for
j donkeys.
The two following statements appeared
in different parts of one and the same
number of the Express last week. Which
!are we to believe? (1) "A pleasing
I compliment was paid by the Lord Chief
Justice to Mr. Justice GILDERSI.EEVE, of
I the United States. The latter was pre-
sented to Lord ALVEKSTONE at the Law
Courts, and the unusual honour was
paid of asking him to take a seat upon the
Bench." (2) "A large tabby cat walked
into the Lord Chief Justice's Court
yesterday, sat down by the Judge, and
listened to the evidence for a while, and
then moved leisurelv out."
FRED. RAIKS, the American travelling
boot-black, intends to visit, in addition
to King EDWARD, the Czar of RUSSIA and
the Emperor of JAPAN, if the difficult
question of precedence can be arranged.
A Revenue Officer has written to the
Daily Mail to say that "The vilest
Scotch plain spirit, a few days old, with
a little burnt sugar added, may be sold
as fine old Irish whiskey, and vice versa."
This is perhaps the most startling of all
the "Falsehoods in Business" which
have been exposed in the columns of
our contemporary. Even the most wide-
awake among us never guessed that fine
old Irish whiskey might be palmed off
on us as the vilest Scotch plain spirit.

IN these sultry days, when ordinary

j sit up in the shade, we welcome a new
j brand to which reference (though not by
name) is made in the Girl's Oitn Paper
for August. One of its "Reliable Re-
ceipts" begins as follows :—" Line a
dish with butter that will stand the fire."
By the by, the "No reasonable offer
refused " fraud has not yet, we believe,
been shown up. Allured by such a
notice in a shop which exhibited a
number of Continental oil paintings, all
"guaranteed done by hand and signed,"
we made an offer of five shillings for the
lot the other day, and the proprietor, a
foreign gentleman, after trying to get us
to be satisfied with two of the works of
art, finally shuffled out of his agreement.
FROM the Glasgow Kreninij Citizens
report of a recent action for the infringe-
ment of a patent for printing and de-
livering tram-tickets, we learn that "the
introduction of electric tramways has de-
veloped the number of people who travel
by enormous strides." This, of course, is
due to the foolish habit of attempting to
overtake these rapid cars en route.

And "extra cover" make it one,—

Upon dull sheets and notch each run.

CROSSING THE CHANNEL.
AT 9 A.M. this morning Mr. CHARLES
BURGESS SWINBURNE, the redoubtable
Northumbrian acrobat, commenced his
great attempt to negotiate the passage of
the Channel amid a vast concourse of
spectators. Interviewed an hour and a
half before immersion the athlete
remarked to our representative that
everything depended upon the Wheel of
Fortune, "but unfortunately," he added
with a laugh, "one can never tell which
way it is going to turn." Mr. RUDY'ARD
KIPLING (the poet) who was present, and
was also interviewed, wished the swimmer
all success, but expressed a fear that the
scour of the Channel tide might even-
tually upset his apple-cart,—an appre-
hension which unfortunately proved only
too well grounded. A telegram was
received from Mr. W. L. MURDOCH con-
taining the words, "Our boys wish you
luck," and M. LOUBET wired, "Hearty
felicitations upon your so splendid
undertaking."
At 8.30 A.M. Mr. SWIMBURNE set out
from Dover Pier for Danger Point, con-
voyed by the entire strength of the
British and French fleets, and accom-
panied by the sounds of "For he's a
jolly good fellow," played upon gramo-
phones. Arrived at the fateful rock he
prepared for his long encounter with the
deep. The athlete wore a motor-cap,

[AUGUST 16, 1905.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BILKINGTON SQUIRE.
"ARE all you chaps asleep ?" remarked
Rilkinyton Squire, Champion Old English
Sheepdog and winner of a hundred
prizes. It was midnight, and the central
hall of the Dog Show was in darkness,
save where a flickering lamp marked the
place where the night attendant lay
snoring heavily, and dimly illuminated
the long lines of benches.
"Asleep!" snarled a neighbouring
Collie, shaking his chain with an angry
rattle. "Not a chance! Here I 've been
barking twelve hours at a stretch, and
my head 's fit to split."
"So's mine," moaned an Airedale
terrier, "and now Master's gone and
left me sore at heart."
"Heart only?" sneered a Borzoi.
"Why, great shanks and marrowbones!
I'm sore all over! What with combing
and grooming, there's no pleasure left
in scratching, or anything left to scratch,
as far as that goes."
"That's nothing to me," yelped a
corded Poodle; "I 'hi shaved dangerously
close one half, and the other tied up in
excruciatingly tight pink bows- while
the language, if 1 so much as shake my
head, isn't fit for a well-bred dog to
listen to."
"What a life !" bayed a tieep-voiced
St. Bernard, frorn a distant bench.
"We 're for all the world like a parcel
of schoolgirls at a strict boarding school,
never allowed to lark or fight or jump
into green scummy ponds or roll in the
long wet grass when we want to."
Bilkington Squire, chuckled good-
hnniQuredly.
"Cheer up," he said. "Think of the
honour and glory, boys."
'• Honour and glory!" snapped a
wire-haired Terrier. "What's the good
of that—you can't kill it. Give me a
rat in a rick before all the honour and
glory in the world."
"Rats?" exclaimed a prick-eared
Skye. "Who said Hats?" and the
chorus ran along the benches.
"Stop it!" said Bilkington Squire
angrily, "or you '11 wake the man, and
the wrong dogs will get whacked as
usual. Why can't you keep quiet, like
my little friend King Charlie here, with
his tongue hanging out at one side as
good as gold?"
"Don't laugh at my tongue," pleaded
the little dog, goggling his eyes wistfully.
"I 've got to keep it there. It's a point!"
"Point or no point, it didn't do you
much good in the ring," chipped in a
Schipperke. "Is it true you actually
flew at the judge when she didn't give
you a prizfe?"
"Quite true," replied King Charlie.
"1 heard my mistress say she was a cat,
so, of course, I went for her."
"Cats—who said Cats?" began the
Yorkshire terriers, but Bilkington Squire
hurriedly suppressed them.
"Look here," he said, "if you fellows
will keep quiet I '11 tell you the tale of
my life. Like my other it's quite short
and rather lively. To begin with, it's a
popular fallacy to think a dog is judged
on his points, it's merely a question of
breeder and pedigree, and though mine
are the envy of every kennel in the
county as a matter of fact my origin is
unknown-- and I am no more Bilkington
Squire than that dish of biscuit at my
side."
Having thus reduced his audience to
breathless attention, he resumed:
"Three years ago my late master
bought me from a travelling tinker for
half-a-crown. I was a big chap, and he
got me into condition with a view to
getting a bit more than his money back
at the shows. I should be sorry to say
how much he dropped over the trans-
action. It was heart-breaking work for
both of us. We were always the first to
be waved aside in the ring, and the
coveted prize-tickets seemed to adorn
every pen on the bench but mine. I
was as fine a dog then as now, but I was
unknown, and likely to remain so.
"One day, at a big show in the Mid-
lands, when my master and I were
heartily sick of the whole business, I
found myself in the next pen to the
Champion Old English Sheepdog of the
country, who swept the board of prizes
at every show he went to. I looked at
him over the small wire partition that
divided us, and he looked at me. Looked!
---we stared, and no wonder, for we were
as like as two peas. From the lop of our
ears to the last patch of colour on our
flanks we were absolutely identical, and
as I looked I laughed rather bitterly at
the irony of fate.
"'Hallo,1 he cried in amazement,
'where on earth did you come from?'
"' Heaven knows—I don't,' I replied,
flippantly; 'but I can tell you where I 'in
going to. After to-day my Master takes
me home and sells me to the butcher
for five bob!'
"'Will the butcher show you?' he
said.
"'Oh dear no,' I replied; 'he's only
got a fancy for me. I shall run after
the cart, eat the scraps and sleep on the
sawdust.'
"'Lucky chap!' lie groaned. 'Just
the life I've always longed for. I'd
give the world to be in your pen!'
"'And I—to be in yours,'I replied,
bitterly.
"He looked furtively round—it was
lunch time and the place was deserted.
"' Come along over, then !' he said -
with a strange thrill in his voice, and
next moment, with a rattle of claws
against the wire, the deed was accom-
plished. The transformation was com-
plete. I was Champion Bilkington
Squire, and speedily surrounded by a
group of admirers who, having first
read my credentials, proceeded to
demonstrate to their friends the match-
less superiority of my points. Presently
I noticed out of the corner of my eye my
old master approach the next pen; but
all he did was to cuff the real Bilkington
Squire on the head for being a failure,
and lead him away to complete his bar-
gain with the butcher.
"Since then, as you know, my career
has been one unbroken line of brilliant
successes, I am worth a fabulous amount
of money, and I have never once regretted
the day when I changed places and
pens with Jiilkiiiijton Squire—nor, to all
appearances, has he.
"I saw him two days ago, as I was
on my way here in a cab. We were
blocked by the traffic just as we were
abreast of a prosperous butcher's shop,
and there he lay among the sawdust
beside .the block, gross as a pig. his coat
a mass of clotted tangles. He opened
one eye, and recognised me.
"' How goes it ?' I said.
'' All right,' lie replied, in an oozy
voice. 'Look at our stock--no Canter-
bury lamb here, if you please. By the
way, if you see a mongrel Retriever
round the corner tell him 1 'm ready for
the last round at 9.30 to-night in the
mews at the back. How 's yourself?'
But without waiting for a reply he
began scratching methodically, and was
still so employed when my master pulled
my head in and put the window up,
for fear I should get a cold in my eye.
And that's all about it," concluded
Bilkington Squire.
He paused—but the only sound that
reached his ears was an occasional snore,
grunt, or a deep sigh, as with twitching
limbs and in uneasy attitudes his
exhausted audience snatched a little
fitful slumber against the last day of
the Show.
NOT GUILTY.
OH, the silly season's reigning belle
Is the Thriftless Wife of the Daily Tel—
A frivolous, frilly, expensive flirt,
WTith the newest sleeve and the latest
skirt;—
But they 're all quite wrong who describe
her so;
For the female fop, as I soon will show,
'Mid the thriftless can't be placed;
For it stands to reason, the constant aim
Of the silk-draped, chiffon-frilled, lace-
flounced dame
Is the smallest possible waste.

A regular nugget without alloy,

A wonderful boy of gold.

And run like a hunted hare; <
Whatever he said was brave and true,
Whatever he did was fair.
The "sapping" that makes your senses swim,
And your hair stand up, and your eyes grow dim,
Was a kind of jolly good joke to him—
He did it with time to spare.
Whenever he bowled he gained u hat
By scattering wickets three;
He punished the bowling and kept his bat
As straight as a bat could be.
Oh, the balls he slogged and the balls he snicked,
And the goals he saved aud the goals he kicked,
And the blustering bullies he fought and licked,
Were a marvellous sight to see!
And now he's a Judge in a tip-top wig,
A Colonel, or College Don,
This wonderful boy who started big
. And never stopped getting on;
For no one ever could call a halt
To the boy who was born without a fault—
Though I take the tiniest grain of salt
With the tale of the paragon.
But he kept a rule, if a thing seemed right—
I hope 1 may keep the same—
To go and do it with all his might
And hardly a thought of fame;
For it isn't the winning that makes'a man,
But it's playing the game on the good old plan,
As hard and straight as a mortal can—
In fact it's playing the game. R. C. L.

Jfoiixe of Commons, Monday, Aug. 1.—
Hush fell on crowded House when, at
Question time, ST. JOHN BrioimifK strode
in.
Mai brook s'en va-t-en guerre.
BRODBIOK hasn't. Just as lie turned his
face to it word reached him from head-
quarters that he would better serve his
country in the groves of peace at West-
minster. Had arranged to he present
this very afternoon at Primrose gathering
at Cranleigh; prepared notes of speech
demonstrating indispensability of pre-
sent Government to welfare of State,
safety of Empire.
To watchful ear of the PINK 'UN
came rumour of ambush nearer home.
Making his daily peregrination of subter-
raneous passages of the House in search
of contraband Radicals or Irish Members,
his lantern flashed light on deep design.
Instead of spending Bank Holiday on
Hampstead Heath or slopes of Greenwich,
a wicked Opposition had planned sur-
prise for patriotic Ministry. Ostenta-
tiously announcing intention of taking a
sail on the river in one of the penny
steamboats they were to disembark at
Westminster Bridge in groups of three,
certainlv not more than five. Between
Embankment and Westminster Yard
there is subterraneous passage. Along
this they were to glide, making their
way by back entrances to the vaults
connected with Ventilating Department.
Here, iced-lemonade and cigarettes being
provided at expense of anonymous person
the PINK 'Us's spies brought him
certain news that the remittance bore the
Dover postmark—they were to remain
till, the signal given, they should rush
into the Central Lobby, dash past, the
paralysed Government Whip, snap a
division, and so put PIIINCE ARTHUR to
the trouble of saying again that he would
not resign merely because lie had been
beaten by an accident.
Such was the carefully elaborated
scheme of a debased Opposition. They
reckoned without the PINK 'UN. As the
BANUVRY CAKE admiringly observes,
"You have to get up very early in the
morning to catch that weasel asleep."
Having possessed himself of the
enemy's plans, familiar with their signs
and countersigns, he rapidly elaborated
a means of countervailing the plot. Not
only was a whip of alarming energy
privately despatched to Ministerialists
urging them to be in their places morn-
ing and evening, but able editors, roused
from their slumbers in the dead of the
night, were induced to print in their
largest type direful hints calculated to
cause to creep the flesh of the most
indifferent. Not for the first time might
the Capitol be saved by vocal alarm.
Climax reached in the PINK 'I.Vs
personal direct appeal to Secretary of
State for India. "I am sure," he wrote,
"that you and your friends in Surrey
will see that the sacrifice asked of
private Members must in fairness be
asked of Ministers. Perhaps this will
be appreciated more especially by those
constituents who have the honour to l>e
represented by a Cabinet Minister."
What could St. JOHN BRODRICK do in
response to appeal like this, at onw
dignified and blood-curdling? He did
the one, the right thing. He left the
Primrose Meeting to the counter-attrac-
tions of the dusky minstrels and the
merry-go-round, and rallied to his com-
rades and his country at Westminster.
A great occasion, a thrilling scene;
lacked only one element of success.
There was no surprise, no ambush. On
the contrary Ministerial majority ran up
to over a hundred. Idle to denv that

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 16, 1905,
Members who at considerable personal
inconvenience had responded to frenzied
call to battle looked askance at PINK
'UN. Mentally registered resolution not
to be taken in again. .
Business done. — Unemployed Bill
rushed through final stages, sent on w
waiting Lords. .
Thursday. — Mr. JAMEs Christopher
FLYNN gone back to County Cork a
chastened man. Has had little joy of
life in closing, Session. Made, several
speeches marked by undiminished fluency
and diminishing audience. For an Irish
Member CHRISTOPHER is, to tell the truth,
a dulldog. Endowed with national gift
of flow of words, but they lead nowhither
beyond the marsh of deadly common-
place.
Disappointed and depressed by lack
of appreciation, he, like his historic
countryman driving at slow pace an
outside car, “saved a trot for the
animal.” Glancing over Report of Irish
Agricultural Department on the Sea
and Inland Fisheries of Ireland, his
eagle eye discerned opportunity to make
the CHIEF SECRETARY squirm. He sat
down quickly and ań. a question
asking “whether the CHIEF SECRETARY's
attention has been called to the fact
that over two hundred pages of a Blue
Book are occupied with scientific inves-
tigations, diagrams and plates dealing
with marine fauna, with noctiluca
miliaris, muggiae atlantica, pleuro-
brachia pileus, echinodermata, and other
specimens of marine life interesting to
naturalists, and only two pages to the
questions of shoal fish and the present
destruction of immature mackerel on the
South Coast of Ireland.”
When he rose to put his question
from the printed list, ribald Members
called out, “Read | Read' ". Time was
when, it being the rule for Members to
recite questions addressed to Ministers,
JAMES CHRISTOPHER would have had to
syllable out noctiluca miliaris, muggiae
atlantica, and eke echinodermata.
Naturally he was not, at the invitation
of mischief-makers, inclined to give
away his advantage of leaving these
undesirable aliens in the silence of type.
WALTER LONG in his reply equally
cautious. At one moment the eagerly-
watching House observed his lips frame
something that looked like pleuro-
brachia pileus. Thought better (or
worse) of it; anyhow abandoned attempt;
contented himself with curtly pointing
out to FLYNN that there is a second
volume of the Report, in which shoal
fish are not neglected nor immature
mackerel overlooked.
Thus was a fresh injustice to Ireland
ignored by a reckless Minister.
Business done. — Appropriation Bill
passed.
Friday.—Parliament Prorogued.
THE UNDESTRABLE IDEAL.
(“‘Is the ideal car desirable?' is the rather
paradoxical question which Mr. FRED. T. JANE
answers in the negative in the course of an
article in the current Autocar.”—Westminster
Gazette.)
WHAT horseman loves the sober nag
That knows not how to play
In sportive mood the merry wag,
And while the tedious way?
Give him the cob with ear a-prick
And saucy unexpected trick,
With soul of flame and eye of fire—
This is PHEIDIPPIDEs’ desire.
So may my motor love to frisk
And gambol on its own;
There is but little sporting risk,
When all the odds are known.
I would not drive a car that did
Precisely as I chose to bid,
A motor that had never known
A will and temper of its own.
May mine, like frolic colts, delight
In unexpected swerves;
There's nothing like a sudden fright
To titillate the nerves.
And may it find a joyous thrill
In bolting down a breakneck hill,
Regardless of the puny brake,
And strewing chaos in its wake.
To skim at legal speed along
The uneventful way,
With nothing ever going wrong,
Is but the poorest play.
Give me the sportive motor which
Delights to take a casual ditch,
And does not fear to risk its fate
Over a sturdy five-barred gate.
May it demand incessant toil
And superhuman art,
And may the fiery petrol boil
Within its gallant heart.
May sparks and flashes fill the air
As hooting through the streets I tear,
Not knowing when 'twill all explode
And scatter me along the road.
PAROLANTI LA LINGWO.
A CONGRESS of Esperantists from Europe,
India, Canada, and New Zealand was
held at Boulogne last week. The official
language was Esperanto, and discussions,
concerts and theatrical performances are
being held therein. The full title of
the Congress was “Universala Kongreso

THE PLAINT OF THE BACHELOR
UNCLE. .
DURING the summer holidays,
Buoyed up with confidence pathetic,
I've tried to prove in various ways
That I am still not nnathletic.
Equipped with everything complete —
Bats, golf-dubs, racket, Beeston Hum-
ber —
I came to find myself effete,
To prove myself a mere back number.
I started in a village match,
As Captain of the house eleven,
By missing a most easy catch -
The batsmen then stayed in till seven.
I scored consistently—with "blobs ";
Nor was my reputation mended
When 1 went on to bowl --with lobs
My solitary over ended.
Discarding cricket as a game
In which I was no longer O.K.,
I sought to vindicate my fame
By showing off my skill in croquet.
Vain confidence! for here again
I met witli unretrieved disaster:
A stalwart nephew, rising ten.
Proved irresistibly my master.
My next essay was on the links,
Where, making certain of defeating
My school-girl niece, an agile minx,
I gave a third and got a beating.
I drove with all my heart and soul.
But none the less the little rascal
Was donny at the thirteenth hole,
And at the last I lost mv Haskell.
Tennis came next iipon the list,
And here it was the self-same story.
The bounding ball I either missed
Or sent it hurtling into glory.
1 never won a single set;
And when, by ill-success unsated,
I tried to jump the tennis net,
My cropper was unmitigated.
Next day, as everyone disclosed

THE GARDEN CURE.
[According to Amateur Gardening we have at hand a remedy for all
troubles, if we only knew it. All we have to do is to open our doors
and live in our gardens.]
0 sweet it is, when sorrow wrings the hair,
Musing to wander in my garden fair,
And gently sniff the balmy Brixton air.
I love the ivy green that clambers there,
The wayward bed of red masturtiums where
The anxious snail constructs his private lair.
Deftly disposed among the lines that bear
A motley wealth of new-mown underwear,
The passion flower unfolds her blossoms rare.
Some broken crockery, a casual pair
Of cast-off bootlets, a dismembered chair,
With other trifles that the neighbours spare -
And there's my rockery and rustic stair,
Where poppies bloom, and wallflowers debonair,
And amorous cats their tender vows declare.
Whom, brick in hand, at dead o' night to scare,
Doth ease the bosom of a load of care.
Lor! how the whistling soap-dish makes them swear!
Let others yield to Town's pretentious snare,
My rustic bliss they cannot hope to share,
Not though their homes abut on Belgrave Square!
ALGOL.
HOW TO KEEP COOL.
Practical Hints by a Family Physician.
FIRST, I would say, eat nothing at all. There is the whole
secret as far as diet is concerned. And, further, from the
mere º of view of economy this advice is worth its weight
in gold.
Secondly, never work between meals. This motto should
be written in letters of gold over the desk of the business
man, over the study table of the clergyman, and over the
model-dwelling of the working-man. The time between
meals should instead be given up to complete repose of body
and mind.
Thirdly, remove all furniture from your rooms at the first
approach of hot weather; take up the carpets and substitute
cool matting. The rooms should then be furnished with a
came lounge, a couple of deck chairs, a light table, and a
few cool-looking prints. No one would believe the difference
that this simple common-sense arrangement of our houses
would make. A few blocks of ice placed about in the rooms
and on the stairs, a few umbrageous cedars, with, say, a
fountain in the entrance hall, and you have an ideal summer
residence, whether in Bayswater or Balham.
Lastly, I would strongly recommend that the method of
thought-suggestion advocated by Christian science should be
employed.
or instance, should one find himself compelled by urgent
necessity to take a seat on an omnibus going along the
Strand in the hottest time of the day, he might employ some
such suggestions as the following:-
“I am perfectly cool and happy.”
“The Strand is the coolest place in London, shaded with
“A delightful breeze is blowing from the sea and from the
mountains of Kensington.”
“I love everybody and everybody loves me.”
If these hints are only faithfully followed by the reader,
then August in London should be for him a "...", of
unimagined beauty. M. D.

MR. LEwis BETTANY had a “happy thought” when he
conceived the plan of The Confessions of Lord Byron |

private opinions on men and matters culled from the new
and enlarged editions of his Letters and Journals. My
Baronite has on his bookshelf a portly volume, being
MooRE's Life of the Bard, in which most of the Letters are
given. It is one of the books he has for years meant to
read, but time and opportunity have not met. Here in
this handy volume is the cream of the correspondence,
skimmed by a skilful and appreciative hand. It presents
a portrait, done by himself for the Uffizi Gallery of Litera-
ture, of one of the strongest, most remarkable personalities
ever born into a world it occasionally shocked. -
Messrs. HopDER AND STOUGHTON are making a new departure
by the publication of a series of volumes enshrining the work
of some living artists. The first issue of In the Open Country
contains twenty studies and pictures of animals and birds by .
Miss Lucy KEMP-WELCH. Four plates are in colour, the
remaining being Rembrandt Photogravure. The work is
dedicated to Professor von HERKoMER, who, in an interesting
note, gives some personal particulars of his most ...;
pupil. The only other letterpress is a brief but admirable
appreciation of the artist's work contributed by Mr. STRANGE.
The studies are in Miss KEMP-WELCH's best style, and are
produced in a manner that suggests to my Baronite the
framing of them for adornment of the walls of a dainty room.
The Man º Won (HUTCHINSON) is a clever story, admir-
ably written, illuminated by clever character drawing, unflag-
ging in interest. Mrs. BAILLIE REYNOLDs has the gift, not
absolutely necessary it would seem to a novelist, of having a
story to tell. At every turn she has some little surprise for
the gratified reader. There is, perhaps, unconscious reminis-
cence of The Daughter of Heth in the landing of the high-
spirited, unconventional Melicent Lulwyche amid the uncom-
Fº conventional surroundings of her uncle's vicarage.
he contiguity supplies opportunity for contrast of which
Mrs. REYNOLDs takes full advantage. My Baronite finds the
Yankee scoundrel first met with in the Transvaal, afterwards
fortuitously turning up in England, a trifle melodramatic.
By contrast with finer workmanship elsewhere he is repulsive.
Doubtless that was the designed effect. Anyhow the blatant
murderous Amurrican does not spoil a rattling good novel.
The Opal Serpent (John LoNG) is as good a sensational
novel as Mr. FERGUs HUME has written for some time. Had
he only taken the trouble severely to repress his peculiar
sense of humour, or had he
but restrained it within certain
limits, the Baron could have
recommended The Opal Serpent
without reserve to all who revel
in tales of crime, of police puzzle-
ment, and of just retribution.
The accomplished and experi-
enced Skipper, who knows how &
to deal gently, but effectively,
with obtrusive low - comedy
characters, will steer clear of
these troublesome rocks, and will
be rewarded for his skill.

ORAL QUESTIONS AND WRITTEN ANSWERS.
m.
[To a Youth who asks the writer " How it feels to be so old ? "]
WHEN you, my boy, with ill-considered riot
Raided the sanctum where I wished to brood
Over my luncheon, and in perfect quiet
Assimilate my food—
When, breathing airs of most untimely revel,
Blent with ozone, the famous Norfolk brand,
You advocated "rounders" on the level
Of loose retarding sand—
I saw the scene: I saw, as in a vision,
Knowing my length of years and what I weighed,
I should infallibly provoke derision
From the Marine Parade.
Therefore I pleaded eld and eld's infirmities,
Urging that, if there ever comes a stage
When such pursuits have reached their natural term, it is
At forty odd (my age).
And lo! like EVE'S, when she secured the apple
Which opened out new worlds and wondrous strange,
Your intellect at first refused to grapple
With life's extended range.
The monstrous figures left you almost blinded,
Till Pity, which my parlous case begat,
Moved you to ask me if I greatly minded
Being as old as that.
I answered: "Age, my boy, is manhood's glory,
So it be sequent on a well-spent youth ;"
Whereat you smiled as one who hears a story
Palpably void of truth.
Yet you were wrong in thinking, gay young scoffer,
"The grapes are sour at which he grasps in vain ";
I would not be, not if I had the offer,
A bounding boy again.
The ardours incident to adolescence,
So like its favoured beverage, ginger-pop,
Where flatness follows close on effervescence,
I am content to drop.
Like SOLOMON, arrived at perfect sanity,
With no desire to make a noise or romp,
I take the line that vanity is vanity,
That pomp is merely pomp.
Not easily we come to these conclusions;
It costs us something—and we bear the trace—
To sacrifice a lot of dear illusions,
To yield, with smiling face,
Boyhood's instinctive claim to fair requital
For labour of the hand or heart or mind,
And learn that what we once considered vital
Is nothing of the kind.
Therefore, although my limbs are less elastic,
I 'd choose the balanced calm that Age enjoys,
Having survived the process, rudely plastic,
That makes for equipoise.
P.S.—I think it might perhaps be better
Not to acidulate your youthful cup,
And so, my boy, I will not send this letter,
But simply tear it up.

FOE THE BENEFIT OF CITY BUSINESS MEN.
THERE is a movement already started for representing to
the Stock Exchange Committee of Management that, in future,
Saturday throughout the year should be officially recognised
as a dies non, when no markets would be open, and no
business transacted.
For the benefit of everyone connected with the Stock
Exchange we beg to add some suggestions which, if adopted,
as they ought to be, by the Committee, will greatly relieve
all the over-worked brokers, jobbers, clerks, and, in fact,
everyone in any way officially, directly or indirectly, connected
with this great centre of the world's industry.
Let Saturday be always a holiday. It is so in Parlia-
ment, whose members are enabled to leave town on
Friday. To get away comfortably on Saturday is something,
but if Saturday is to be a genuine whole holiday, then it is
absolutely essential that the afternoon of Friday should be.
perfectly free. This plan in former times was of such
considerable obligation, that whenever a whole holiday, being
a Saint's day, was marked in the model public-school calendar
as a holiday, its "vigil" was invariably a half holiday.
Therefore it is hereby proposed that in every working week,
throughout the Stock Exchange year, Friday shall be a half
holiday and Saturday a whole one.
But how can Sunday be a perfect whole holiday if the Stock
Exchange holiday-enjoyer has to commence re-packing up on
Sunday afternoon, or on Sunday evening, in order to return
on Sunday night and represent the early bird, who is
down on the later-rising worm, on Monday morning, in
the City? No; Sunday must remain a jour de fete from
midnight to midnight. But is the tired broker to be
deprived of his well-earned rest? Perish the thought.
Therefore, as it is here proposed to give him half of
Friday for his preparation, so naturally, and logically, half
of Monday must be conceded to him for returning home,
refreshing himself, and preparing for work in the City
some time after midday. Rarely, however, is Monday a great
working day, and given an hour for luncheon there remain
only two clear hours till the closing time, which should
certainly be four o'clock.
Why, then, do any business on Monday? Why not begin
the real genuine hard-working Stock-Exchange week in the
City on Tuesday? Then there will be three and a-half days
left, quite enough, indeed, more than enough, for anyone to
turn the honest penny and realise thousands.
But indefatigable workers there are who may object to
the above method. For these we offer another suggestion,
premising that to work it out, practically and satisfactorily,
must occupy some time. It is this:—Move the entire Stock-
Exchange business down to the seaside from the first of May
to the end of September. Let the Committee find some place
by the sea. Commence with tents as offices. One large
tent, like that which serves the Messrs. SAKGER for a circus,
to serve as the Exchange itself. Which of all seaside places
shall be chosen? An overwhelming majority on the Com-
mittee must decide this difficult question.
En attendant, let the Committee purchase fields in various
places, north, south, east and west, communicating with one
another by telephone, telegraph, and private sky-signals;
or (and this, too, is another admirable suggestion) let the
Committee take an encampment, calling it Stockborough-on-
Sea, as a commencement, and begin work next year. The
interval between now and next April should be devoted
to the full consideration of all the details of this excellently
devised scheme.
Mem.—Theatrical and operatic companies would follow
this lead, as would restaurateurs, hairdressers, and all trades-
men and others interested in the health of the overworked
City business man.

evidence, and a few words about these
interesting but annoying little pests will
perhaps not come amiss.
It is not, we believe, generally known
that the eating apparatus of the fly is
really out of all proportion to the size of
its diminutive body. If a man's eating
apparatus were built upon the same pro-
portions as that of a fly, alterations and
additions on a large scale would have to
be carried out inorderto provide adequate
accommodation for his lips and teeth,
which under the new conditions would
present a frontage of
THREE FEET SIX INCHES.
Needless to say, this would look utterly
absurd.
Few people who are pestered with
flies seem to be aware of the fact
that the immediate neighbourhood of a
wasp's nest is an effectual guarantee that
no flies will materialise there, wasps
being their implacable enemies. Un-
fortunately, however, for us poor bipeds,
who are compelled to live in towns, it is
an exceedingly difficult matter to induce
the wasp to make its nest among us.
A fly has almost as many lives as a
cat. It is a difficult thing to drown one,
unless you have the time and patience to
hold its head under a
STRONG JET OF WATER
for a considerable time. You have pro-
bably often wondered how a fly can walk
on a ceiling upside down. Nature, fore-
seeing that our winged friend would
sooner or later make a hobby of walking
in this position, has thoughtfully pro-
vided him with suckers to enable him to
perform the feat. Capillary attraction,
or, if you like, animal magnetism, is
thus brought into play to counteract or
negative the force of gravity, thus pre-
venting the little animal from falling on
its back upon the floor, and perhaps
sustaining serious injuries.
Adhesive paper does not always catch
flies, and when it does the result cannot
be said to be pleasant to look upon. The
present writer has lately come across an
ingenious, and at the same time highly
DECORATIVE SCHEME
for getting rid of the surplus flies in
a house. The scheme is simplicity
itself. All that is required is a tube of
"Stickytine," a step-ladder, and a little
ingenuity. With the "Stickytine," trace
on the ceiling some conventional pattern,
—a five-pointed star, for instance, looks
well—and the flies will do the rest! The
result will surprise you, and you will
have all the pleasure of the artist in
watching your design growing before
your very eyes. Spiders may sometimes
be introduced into the design, to give a
touch of realism, and their use and
limitations will be found fully treated
in that useful little handbook, Spiders
as Decorative Adjuncts, by ASTON WEBB,
R.A., F.R.I.B.A., F.S.A.
Leading to several puffs.
BEFORE the French Fleet quitted our
shores Alderman J. H. CORKE (of Ports-
mouth) presented Admiral CAILLARD and
his officers with a thousand boxes of
cigarettes. The cigarettes were of course
cork-tipped ; so were the French Admiral
and officers.

SCENE—Inside the gardens of any West-
End Square. TIME—10 P.M.
He. Hullo, KITTEN! You here? How
rippin'!
She. TOM! What luck! I'm just
dyin' for someone to talk to. I 'm abso-
lutely alone. My people are all off to
Marienbad —Papa, Mamma, babies, nurses
and all, and only poor little me left alone
at 82.
He. Why on earth didn't you let me
know? I'd have come round like a shot.
She. Would you? Then why didn't
you when you knew I was there? You
only came once the whole season.
He. Oh, well, you know why that was.
She. I 'm sure I don't. Were you—er
—Jealous?
He. Jealous! Me jealous! Who of,
I'd like to know? When I'd only to
look at you
She. Isn't the moon too lovely for
words? D'you know, I think moon-
light suits you? You 're looking rather
nice to-night. Perhaps it's because I
haven't seen you for so long.
He. What rot! You are, if you like.
Your eyes are sparkling like—they
remind me of—of the Milky Way.
She. Thew7i<ToM?
He. The Milky Way.
She. Do they really? The Milky Way?
TOM, dear!
He. Yes, pet.
She. This is rather comfy, isn't it?
Are you happy, dear?
He. Darling!
She. Better than the silly season, isn't
it?
He. This is the silly season, silly.
She. Oh, you know what I mean.
Better than when town is full of silly
people. Except for one thing.
He. Oh, well, of course it is rather
rot. Flirtin' and eatin' and dnncin'
about all night. It's rather an empty
sort of life.
She. Empty! Oh, empty, yes. And
yet, TOM, do you know, sometimes I
He. Yes, darlin', what is it?
Slie. Oh, n-nothing. Perhaps I'll
tell you some day. Don't ask me now.
He. Course not, pet. What shall we
do? Like to walk round the gardens?
She. I 'd rather not, TOM, if you don't
mind. You 're so strong, but I—I 'm
rather tired. I'd rather stay here
quietly. Shall you mind?
He. Mind? Why, of course not. Here,
lean against me.
She. Ah!
He. That better?
She. Oh, TOM, it's heavenly. How
good you are to me! How I—what was
that?
He. That? Oh, nothing. What makes
you so nervous?
She. But it VMS something. There
it is again. Something moving in the
bushes.
He. My dear, it's only a sparrow.
She. A sparrow! Oh, TOM, d'you
think—no, never mind.
He. Look here, what is the matter
with you? I wish you wouldn't be so
jumpy. You spoil everything.
She. I, TOM?
He. Yes, you. Just when I want to be
confound it all, there you go again.
Do sit still. What does it matter if an
idiotic bird
She. You 're very un-unkind to me.
He. Well, if it comes to that
She. I thought you 1-loved me. But
you 're just as selfish as the rest.
He. Oh, bother.
She. That's right. Swear away.
Just like a man.
He. I didn't swear.
She. Oh!
He. I tell you I didn't. I didn't.
She. You did, you did, you did. . . .
Oh, TOM! TOM! Don't let's quarrel.
I 'm too weak. I—TOM, I 'm hungry.
He. Hungry? You!
She. I haven't had anything to eat
for three days.
He. You poor dear! Why didn't you
tell me?
She. I tried to, TOM, and then I—oh,
TOM.
He. What? When? Oh, when I
said about its being an empty life?
Was that it?
She. Oh, yes, TOM. And then I was
ashamed and couldn't go on. And
when you said my eyes were like the
M-m-milky Way
He. What a blind fool I am! The
Milky Way! The irony of it! You
poor darling! I 'd like to give your
people a bit of my mind, going off to
Hamburg, or wherever it was, and
leavin' you like that. What brutes they
are!
She. I suppose they didn't think, TOM.
He. Then they ought to think. What
else have they got to do?
She. They haven't time to think, TOM.
They are so busy getting cured of having
eaten too much.
He. I'd cure them. I'd eat them.
I'd—but what are you going to eat?
That's the question.
She. I don't want anything to eat now,
TOM. I 've got you.
He. Rubbish! You must have some-
thing better than that. Tell you what,
KITTEN, you come round to my flat.
There's only the old charwoman and the
stable-cat. She's not a bad old sort.
She '11 give you
She. The sparrow, TOM. There it is
again.
He. Of course. The very thing. You
wait here and I '11—bother! Here's a
beastly dog. We'd better separate.
You know my number in Jermyn Street?
Will you come on there? Don't be long'
KITTEN dear. I 'd like to kill the people
who left you behind. After all, though
we are cats Miaow!

area-railings.
JOHN BULL JUNIOR.
MY subject's a cheerful young party,
Whose age is approaching fifteen;
Whose appetite's thoroughly hearty,
Whose temper is bland and serene.
At pcistime he's highly proficient,
But inquiries abundantly prove
That he's terribly far from omniscient,
Except in one limited groove.
For instance, his industry's tireless
In getting his Wisden by rote;
But of Signer MABCONI (the wireless)
He takes the most negligent note.
That the primary use of the cable
Is cricket, he's free to maintain—
He associates cricket with ABEL,
And bats with the mention of CAIN.
He can't tell the whereabouts clearly
Of Constantinople or Prague,
But he '11 talk by the hour about BHEAKLEY,
He '11 tell you the birthplace of HUGH.
He cannot be sure if the Hooghly 's
A river, a town, or a hill;
But then upon BOSANQUET'S "googlies"
A volume he 'd easily fill.
He's weak on the Wars of the Roses,
But LILLEY he hugely admires.
If you cite Dr. JOHNSON, he dozes,
But JACKSON his ecstasy fires.
The Middlesex WELLS he thinks lots of,
But it isn't the prophet we know;
And the one famous ARNOLD he wots of
Is the eminent Worcestershire "pro."
He can't tell a brig from a schooner,
Or a cormorant from a curlew,
But he knows all the virtues of SPOONEII
(Who isn't the Warden of New).
When HIRST was laid up by a blister,
He nearly was ready to cry,
He knows next to nothing of LISTER,
He thinks very highly of FRY.
Why CHAMBERLAIN'S down on the
"dumper"
He knows not and cares not to learn,
But he knows the religion of TRUMPER,
The family tree of JACK HEARNE;
He ardently aims at achieving
A place in his County's eleven;
And he recently owned to believing
That there's to be cricket in Heaven.
For the moment this amiable stripling
In a (flanneled) Fool's Paradise dwells,
Unheeding the strictures of KIPLING,
Neglecting the warnings of WELLS.
If he ever emerges or duly
Developes, remains to be seen;
Meanwhile he exemplifies truly
Our Governing Class at fifteen.

[AUGUST 23, 1905.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE KAISER.
AIT, ye who are hot in the crush and cram
Of the holiday train or the seaside tram,
Don't think of the KAISER of proud Potsdam,
Or you'll never again be cooler.
To the'uttermost edge of its outside rim
The earth is full of the fame of him;
And the birds that fly and the fish that swim
All worship the German ruler.
To grasp the idea of a man like that,
A full blue-blooded aristocrat,
Who's got all knowledge as pat as pat,
Is not very easy, is it?
Such a terrible, toasting, talking man,
So busy with brand-new plot and plan,
So quick to be out of the frying-pan.
Whenever there's fire to visit.
Imagine his Schnurrbart tipped sky-high,
His medals and stars and his eagle eye,
And his mailed-fist finger in every pie,
And the things that he does for pleasure:
How he preached a sermon, and danced a dance,
And made the line of his troops advance,
And put a spoke in the wheel of France,
And all in a moment's leisure.
In the space of a curtailed winter's day
He painted a picture and wrote a play,
A national hymn and a roundelay,
Before he had to go bedward.
And then, to mitigate foreign hates,
He called up BULOW and fixed the dates
For passing his naval estimates,
With an eye on his Uncle EDWARD.
His uniforms make an immense total,
For he gets out of bed as a Field-Marshal
And dines as a British Admiral—
I don't know what he looks best as.
It takes him a minute—never more—
To muzzle a critical editor,
Or put him inside a prison door
On a charge of Icesa majestas.
Then, baring his arm, with a fearful twist
Of the hand that hangs from his iron wrist,
He screws the scruff of a Socialist
For letting his votes get larger.
He goes to roost as the clocks strike ten,
And at one A.M. he is out again
With a pretty surprise for the soldier men
Whom he leads on his chestnut charger.
Whenever there's anything, right or wrong,
In which there's a chance for going strong,
He goes and he does it all day long;
And he's never at ease a minute.
One day he is off to Morocco bound,
And next he sails through the stormy Sound—
In short if the lime-light's playing round
The Emperor WILLIAM 's in it.
I hoped he would tire in a year or so,
And go, as the Lotos-eaters go,
To a land where everything's soft and low,
And nobody wants to worry.
But the years roll on, and the KAISER too,
And there always seems to be something new
For the meddlesome hands of the man to do
In a fit of Imperial hurry.
STUDIES IN JOURNALISM.
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL.
(With acknowledgments to "Truth.")
I AM in possession of a number of facts reflecting very
liscreditably upon the management of the Bullseye fort at
ShoeburyviUe, where the militia artillery have been in
raining. The commissariat department was deplorably
nefficient, on more than one occasion potatoes being served
:o the men with their jackets on, so simple an act as paring
,hem seeming to be beyond the resources of the War Office.
There is an impression abroad that anything is good enough
'or a soldier, but so long as I can raise my voice this
poisonous doctrine shall make no headway. On another
occasion butter was allowed to stand in the sun until it
completely lost its flavour. A system which works out like
this in dealing with a small matter of routine, where months
are available for preparation, is not likely to tome out very
brilliantly under the strain of war.
During the illumination of the French fleet at Portsmouth
a number of Corporation servants viewed the sight from the
spire of the new Town Hall, while those of the public who
wished to share this advantageous position were rigorously
excluded. It would be interesting to know by whose autho-
rity these gentry annexed the premises in this way, for I
suppose they would have no right to do such a thing on their
own account. And even if anyone else gave them the right
it must have been by an error of judgment, for certainly this
seems an occasion when the public ought to be allowed the
use of a tower provided for their benefit.
Another case has come to my notice illustrating the modus
operandi of the Ducdame Hygienic Institute, which is, as my
readers know, the latest manifestation of the scoundrel
WUMP, whom I have been exposing for many years. In
December last a West Ham lion-tamer, deceived by the Insti-
tute's mendacious advertisement, entrusted WUMP with five
guineas of his hard-earned money, in return for which WUMP
undertook to supply him with a new flesh-and-blood arm in
place of the limb which one of his charges had recently
consumed. Needless to say no new arm has grown.
As WUMP is quoting opinions of the Press in favour of
his treatment, I think it desirable to publish these facts, as
giving the other side of the case, and to call attention again
to what has already been said in this paper with reference to
the "Institute." The law which allows this state of things,
while professing to regulate the practice of medicine, and to
limit it to persons possessing certain specific qualifications,
is in the highest degree unsatisfactory. If the medical pro-
fession does not think it necessary to get this abuse corrected
in its own interest, Parliament ought to deal with the matter
by a Royal Commission.
My Pillory is not very full this week, but one contrast is
better than nothing. It must not, however, be thought that
the Great Unpaid are growing any wiser. It simply means
that many of my newspaper-searchers are having their
holidays:

aliases, I have teen furnished with some interesting informa-
tion as to the ramifications of the notorious bloodsucking
firm of MAcBuLLS. This is, of course, a mere nom de guerre,
nobody of the name of MAOBULL being connected with the
business, which has always been run by members of the
Hebrew family of the IKEYS. Originally the firm, which had
its head-quarters at Cardiff and branch usury-shops in many
other towns, including London, was styled JOHN MAoBuLL AND
Co. Later on it was registered as a joint-stock company
with a directorate including ISAAC, JACOB, MOSES, SOLOMON,
and LAZARUS IKEY. I have given not a few instances of their
rapacity, and the operations of the firm came under the
notice of the Select Committee on Money-lending. It is much
to be regretted that the Money-lenders Act does not, as was
recommended by the Select Committee, compel all these
gentry to carry on business in their own rightful names,
which in many instances would act as a sufficient danger-
signal to would-be borrowers.
The vampire LEVY has just cropped up again at Birmingham
under the name of PATRICK ALEXANDER JONES. In his new
role he issues circulars to aeronauts offering to lend them
money on easy terms. Aeronauts, it seems, are often in
financial difficulties, and LEVY has had the wit to notice this,
and to profit accordingly. It is to be hoped that the attention
of the police will be drawn to the fact that he is not only
carrying on the business of a money-lender on unregistered
premises, but also tempting a very deserving class of man.

Customer. Have you any washing-books?
Assistant. No, Madam, but I have untearable ones in linen.
"The Ideas Exchange."
THE Minor Poet who, in our issue of August 9, wrote from
The Laurels, Upper Tooting, offering "original and highly
amusing gags for knockabout scene," and was willing to take
in exchange "the suitable conclusion of a rhymed couplet
beginning:
'Oh wan pale parent pendent o'er thy babe,'"
is greatly obliged to the gentleman who has sent him the
following line:
"Christen him ABRAHAM, or, briefly, ABE,"
and will forward the gags without delay.
"Seaside Boredom."
[The Daily Mail has been circularising the Town Councils of
various seaside resorts to find out if sufficient amusements for men
are provided.]
To judge by a notice on the slopes of Plymouth Hoe—
"Gentlemen are requested not to overlook the ladies' bathing-place "—
it is clear that the Town Council of Plymouth makes it its
business to organise adequate entertainment for its male
visitors.
THE tendency to waste time on refreshment intervals at
cricket matches seems to receive undue encouragement at the
Oval. On the occasion of a very important match, an
adjacent public-house recently advertised seats to view,
"situated midway between wickets. Luncheons, Teas, Wines,
Spirits and Cigars of the finest quality." This is putting a
great temptation in the way of our players, especially the
batsmen and the bowlers.

SCENE.—A row of balking machines on a
sandy beach, with No. 5 in the im-
mediate foreground. A harassed-
looking lady sits in a hammock chair
close by, knitting, with a bundle of
bathing impedimenta at her feet; a
second lady, also with bathing tilings
and a careicm-n face, is seated at a
short distance from the. first. They
are unacquainted, but exchange
sympathetic, glances.
First Lady (with a sad smile). How
trying this weary waiting is! It wastes
one's whole morning, does it not?
Second Isidy. Yes, indeed, it is quite
dreadful. I 'vc been waiting for nearly
an hour. They ought not to be allowed
to stop in so long!

a terrible time dressing -and with very
poor results, in my opinion.
Second Lady. I quite agree with you.
The women here are utterly lacking in
style and manner. Ah!

only just come in. [B. M. retires.
First Lady. What a falsehood !—but
they all say that. What makes this
waiting especially annoying tome is that
if I do not bathe a full hour before lunch
I am upset for the rest of the day.
Second Lady. Really? I can quite
sympathise with you. I have to live by
rule myself. My doctor has ordered
sea-bathing at 11.30 each morning,
almost, one might say, as a last resource.
My health is so precarious.

MR. PUNCH'S TRAVEL TALK.
(Someichat in the manner of "T. P.'s.")
PROVINCIAL. — London is well worth
visiting for its historical attractions.
You are right in thinking the Thames
Embankment and the Abbey free, but
at the latter pleasure resort the vergers
like their verging to be recognised.
There are several hotels. You make a
mistake in thinking that one has to book
seats in advance for Mr. PLOWDEN'S Court.
The seats are free. There is no early
door.
STUDEKT.—If, as you say, you know no
German except the phrase " Schleswig-
Holstein," it would be wiser, perhaps,
for you to stay at an English boarding-
house while you are in Dresden. There
are many to choose from, and you need
not meet any Germans at all, which will,
perhaps, make your three weeks' stay
the more pleasant, whatever it may do
for your study of the country.
A. B. C. asks if it is possible to enjoy
a good fortnight's holiday in Belgium
for five shillings a day all told. Cer-
tainly, if you live low enough, and do
not wish to be always travelling. Third
class to Ostend is not excessive, and in
August it is no hardship to sleep on the
beach. Winners in the Casino are often
very generous as they leave. Why
English people think it a reasonable
thing to spend less on a holiday abroad
than they would on ordinary living at
home is a question that I have not time
to consider. I merely encourage them
to do so. Next, please.
T. W.—There is no reason why you
and your wife should not travel in
Switzerland speaking no language but
your own. There are hundreds of
English tourists in Switzerland, the
greater majority of whom are probably
unacquainted with any other language.
If the waiters do not understand you,
try either dumb signs or Esperanto. It
is a good rule to shout if you are not
understood. Take a megaphone with
you for use at the smaller hotels.
BOY.—For a youth unused to London
life and not accustomed to catering for
himself, I think a boarding-house is
decidedly preferable to lodgings, especi-
ally if living alone. If you had a friend
to share the expenses of rooms with you
they would be cheaper. If he paid half
they would be cheaper by 50 per cent.
ELLEJT.—The question of tips is a
difficult one to decide, and the mag-
nitude of this theme is fully exposed in
an adjoining article. Everything de-
pends upon the length of your stay, the
amount of trouble given, the class of
hotel patronised, and the character of the
head waiter's eye. A rule that is greatly
followed is to give 10 per cent, on the
amount of the bill for a short stay, and
5 per cent, for a long one. For longer
still, 1 per cent, or nothing. You might
arrange to have your luggage sent on
and slip away quietly by the back door.
This is very usual amongst a large
class of people.
PATERFAMILIAS.-— Shepherd's Bush is
not usually considered a watering-place,
but the Tube would bring you to Hyde
Park very quickly (Lancaster Gate
station: fare twopence), and you would
then find the Serpentine, with boating
and bathing facilities. Mixed bathing
is not allowed, but after all the pleasure
of being in cold water with one's beloved
is not too obvious. For lodgings I
can (quite disinterestedly) recommend
Madame NESTLE at 42, Succi Road.
K. M.—No, there are no places in thelsle
of Wight that have not been discovered.
Nor are there any that are cheap. The
best route is by steamer from Ports-
mouth, Stokes Bay, or Southampton;
but there is no reason why you should
not swim and send your luggage by
carrier. I have not the championship
table beside me, so I cannot say what
the record is for swimming to Hyde,
but records are made to be cut, so why
not cut it? You would also save eight-
pence. I doubt if you can get lodgings
at Osborne, but Norris Castle is to let,
Mr. W. E. NORRIS having settled at
Torquay.
A. A.—For a novelist in search of
local colour I can cordially recommend
Norfolk. Harpooning bloaters on the
Broads may not have quite the excite-
ment of tarpon fishing, but it is excellent
sport. Camping-out is not allowed in
the park at Sandringham owing to the
presence of a herd of wild cattle, but I
believe there is nothing to prevent your
tethering a captive balloon to the spire
of Norwich Cathedral. I always thought
that a Norfolk biffin was a sort of bird,
but perhaps you are right.
HANDY ANDY.—You cannot bicycle all
the way to Jersey, nor are you likely to
be taken in as a paying-guest for less
than 3s. a day unless you are a vege-
tarian. It was VICTOB HUGO and not
Sir GILBERT PARKER who wrote The Toilers
of the Sea, but there is no danger of
octopuses now. VICTOR HUGO is dead.
No, it is not as a rule necessary to take
dress clothes (evening dress) if you stay
at a temperance hotel, but collars are
de rigueur at all meals.
Breakfaat-Table Problem.
"AFTER all, what is the object in swim-
ming across the Channel when it can be
done for a few shillings in a steamer?"
—Evening News.
Say what "it" is; and, if it means
swimming, then show the fallacy underly-
ing the original question, even if we
suppose the steamer to contain a swim-
ming-bath.
THE ECONOMICS OF TIPPING.
[This paper, apparently intended for the
Economic Science Section of the British Associa-
tion, now assembled in Cape Town, has by
some oversight found its way to Bouverie Street.]
THE molecule and the atom, it has been
eloquently shown by our learned and
distinguished President, are subject to
the laws of Evolution. He has pointed
out that if we trace the history of these
conceptions we find their stability gradu-
ally changing—rising to a maximum—
declining—falling to nothing—and then
revolution, followed by newly acquired
strength and permanence. So also, to
some extent, with the form of matter
known as the Tip, though it is at present,
according to all competent observers,
neither an atom nor a molecule. A
French statistician has calculated that
£20,000,000 a year is distributed in tips
in France,and that in Paris alone£12,000
changes hands in this way each day.
As the result of inquiries, we find that
the same state of things prevails in
England. Tipping, indeed, is upon the
upward grade in London and the Pro-
vinces alike. The Tip has now acquired
such formidable dimensions as to bring
about a vital change in the economic
conditions of the country.
Owing largely to the influx of Ameri-
can millionaires and sportsmen, it appears
that waiters, gamekeepers, and similar
recipients are paying very considerable
premiums in order to secure likely berths.
We have it on the best authority that
the newly-appointed Hall Porter of the
Hotel Roosevelt in the West End has
just obtained that incumbency by means
of a douceur of three thousand guineas
to the proprietors of the establishment,
and is congratulating himself on his
bargain. About a quarter of this sum
was the "key-money" due from the
Chief Chambermaid of the hotel on
succeeding to the emoluments of her
position. The comparatively trifling fee
of £2,500 was lately handed over as
"first fruits" to the Owners' Provident
Pension Fund by the fortunate nominee
to a Head Waitership at a leading
restaurant. Subordinate posts are pur-
chasable in like proportion. Needless
to say, no salaries are now paid to these
favoured officials. On the contrary, the
proprietors are agitating for an increased
percentage of the weekly proceeds of the
tip-harvest.
In the country, the cost of a Game-
keepership under a nobleman or Ameri-
can magnate runs into four figures for
entrance fee, with a varying annual
subscription payable by the keeper
according to the average takings of his
benefice. The landlord is thus enabled
to defray the heavy expenses of rearing
and preserving his pheasants. The rent
of a grouse moor or deer forest is

similarly met by a dividend from tho
gillies engaged.
The relations of employer and employe
are thus becoming inverted by the rising
of Tips to their maximum. The former
is now hired by the latter to assist him
in the process of earning a living. The
waiters are, in fact, the masters of the
situation, though, in justice be it said,
they are paying handsome wages to the
hotel • proprietors. Many restauraut-
keepers would be in the workhouse
were it not for the generous salaries
which they receive from their staff.
How long this state of things will
continue it is not so easy to determine.
There should bo a revolution on the
part of somebody—to carry out the
analogy of the atom—before stability is
reached. The maximum, however, will
not be arrived at until all the mono}7
of guests, visitors, etc., is transferred to
the pockets of the tip-takers. There
would then be a rapid decline in gratui-
ties, unless the quondam tippees gave
adequate powboires to their nominal em-
ployers, to be passed on to their former
customers by way of bonuses to reward
their return. The tipped ones woidd in
this way be tipping themselves, and
equilibrium would ensue. There is,
nevertheless, a great possibility that a
revolt against thei nflation of tips may
take place at an earlier stage, in which
case (to change the original metaphor)
the bubble will be pricked and people
will have to wait on themselves.
ZIG-ZAG.
THE EVERLASTING TEST.
TUB 'Suggestion that all Test Matches
should in future be extended to six days
is hardly likely to be adopted, owing to
the fact that it does not go far enough.
There should be no time limit whatever
in International matches. What side of
Test team players can do justice either
to their averages or their country if
forced by the exigencies of the present
ridicidous time limit to start their
innings after a long and arduous day
in the field? Twenty-four hours' com-
plete rest, accompanied by change of
air and scene, is absolutely essential to a
display of such transcendent importance.
In case, also, of the pilch wearing badly,
or a night's rain intervening, or a spell
of oppressively warm weather setting in,
a bracing trip to the sea-side should be
arranged for tho teams, the umpires and
Mr. CRAIG while the wicket is being
coaxed back to its normal condition.
It may bo urged, on the other hand,
that such patchwork play would tend to
lessen the spectator's interest in the
struggle, but, far from this being the
case, ad libitum Test cricket woidd confer
an inestimable boon on the English-
speaking world. There would be no
longer that feeling of desolation, that
desperate sensation of emptiness, so
prevalent among vicarious sportsmen
between the Test Matches, while specta-
tors of every class could watch the
match at its commencement or in a
few weeks' time with the comfortable
assurance that the same glorious game
woidd still be in progress.
From tho feminine point of view, at

any rate, the idea would be distinctly
popular, and the gate-money enormously
increased in consequence, for the simple
reason that, time being no object with
the players, lady enthusiasts would find
the lawn at tho disposal of their frocks
and sunshades not once, but many times
during the day, while, for instance,
Mr. ARMSTRONG was having a chat with
an overseas friend in tho Pavilion, or
Mr. FRY was waiting till he felt more in
a mood for his knock.
GOLDEN RULES FOR THE
NURSERY.
(Modelled on the regulation Nursery Card.)
DROWNING.—If the cliild show signs of
not wishing to leave its bath, you may
at once assume that it is drowned. Send
instantly for the doctor and both parents,
and do not relax your efforts for a
moment until they come.
Pull the child's nose violently and put
tepid bricks to its stomach and thighs,
armpits and soles of feet. Then cut off
all hair and rub its head with one part
lime-water and two parts treacle to
restore circidation. Lay the child on
the bed and leave it quite alone for half
an hour, or until the doctor comes.
CHOKING.—This complaint only occurs
during breakfast. Send for the doctor
at once, then put your whole hand as far
down the child's throat as possible, and
keep it there till the doctor comes.
NOSE BLEEDING.—Treatment the same
as drowning.
Sua<5TANCES IN THE EYE.—Take a well-
sharpened penknife and try to remove
the substance with it. If this fails, send
for a box of glycerine jujubes, and wait
till the doctor comes.
DITTO IN THE NOSE.—Anything in the
nose is perfectly harmless, and will be
much better left where it is.
SWALLOWING PINS, COINS, BUTTONS,
PAPER-KNIVES, ETC.—If anything of this
description stick in the throat of the
child, attach a long piece of string to a
crochet needle and let it drop as far as
possible down the throat, taking care
that the child bite the needle. Then
send for the doctor. Do not on any
account give the child an emetic.
WOUNDS.—Carefully wash the child
all over witli mustard and water to
remove all dirt. Then put it to bed
and keep it there for a few days, or
until the doctor comes.
BITES.—If the child cannot bite its
food properly, there is probably some-
thing wrong with the food, or with the
child's teeth. In either case send for
the doctor. Hold the cliild up by the
heels for twenty minutes. If at the end
of that time the teeth have not dropped
out lay the child on tho bed until the
doctor's arrival and do not attempt to
undress it, as probably there is some-
thing wrong with its food. On no ac-
count give it cod-liver oil.

JUST 1235 YEARS MORE!
WE hasten to reassure our male
readers as to the scare caused in the news-
papers last week by a statement made at
the Detroit Congress by Mr. W. L. BODINE,
Superintendent of Compulsory Educa-
tion in Chicago, to the effect that the
extinction of Man is imminent, owing to
the alarming increase of wage-earning
Woman. It is not really as bad as that.
A "Well-known Sociologist" has given
it as his opinion, in the Express of
August 18, that "the year 3140 will see
the final triumph of women, when there
will be 100 per cent, more women than
men living in Great Britain. Twelve
centuries later there will only be one
man to every three women." We beg
the Mere Man to breathe again, and to
take a careful note of these dates. The
first is exactly 1235 years ahead, and
we have therefore, no doubt, time to
make preparations accordingly. All
Redistribution Bills, for instance, which
concern the male voter and are now in
contemplation, should have a clause
inserted that they will become null and
void in 3140 A.D. It is to be sincerely
hoped that Mr. BAI.FOUR will bear this in
mind in framing his next attempt. Houses
may still be built on a 999 years' lease with
masculine "dens" and dressing-rooms,
but for further periods we should recom-
mend architects of club-houses and so
forth to exercise a wise restraint. All
Cricket tours and Test Matches booked
for the summer of 3141 should be
promptly cancelled, as there will not be
enough trousered individuals to provide
a "gate." A similar caution applies to
the latter half of the previous football
season. Husbands also have just twelve
hundred and thirty-five years more to act
as heads of the household, and do other
odd jobs with hammers, etc. After
then each will be only "half-a-man,"
and a new judgment of SOLOMON will be
required to adjust matters.
We merely drop these hints by way
of allaying any unnecessary fears during
the present holiday season. It is very im-
portant to be exact in the matter of dates
in arranging for these social cataclysms.
A Plurality Scandal.

Vicar of St. Thomas, Brightside, Shef-
field, has, we are informed, resigned his
benefice, and that («ic) his Grace the

surely to have known better.

Of what Philosophy would lay before via

He took no stock in Science: had you said,
"Teeth are a fraud, my neolithic brother,"
It might have struck his adamantine head
To answer, "You 're another!"

When they would cease from duty.

You 're going (very kindly) to deliver us
From dental agonies: the latest dodge
Is not to be carnivorous.

Their loss invigorates " (we quote your thesis)

It gets those lovely creases.
"And, when the far-away Utopia comes,
More even-minded, if in features odder,
Posterity shall sip through pointless gums
A vegetable fodder."
Delightful notion !—Life, immune from pains.
To serious thought and cereal food apprenticed.
But are they really such a boon, these brains?
Ought we to starve the dentist?
Are there no simpler changes we can make
Than thus to cast aside our cherished molars,
And build the massive brow too large to take
A standard size in bowlers?
Why not revert (and bid your scheme go hang!)
To types that read no news and rent no villa—
The irresponsible Orang Outang,
The fancy-free Gorilla?
Sweet to repose on eligible trees,
Saving our teeth for one eternal chatter
About the cerebrum, and by degrees
Eliminate the latter.
AN AFTERTHOUGHT.
ACCORDING to the Times report of the last scene of all,
"The Sailing of the French Fleet," that ended the eventful
week,. " the Flrequeen summed up the whole situation in the
one word 'Good-bye.'" Not staying to point out tliat "Good-
bye" is certainly not 'one word,' but four separate words
compressed into two hyphenically united, it is most unfortu-
nately noticeable that instead of "Good-bye" the Firequeen
ought to have signalled " Au Revoir," or, if we are deficient
in French signals, then, at least, could have been substituted
"To our next merry meeting." The idea of saying that "the
whole situation was summed up" in wishing our guests "Good-
bye"!! The truly hospitable host never utters the sad word
"Good-bye" without adding an affectionate " Hope you '11 come
and see us again soon," or something to that effect. "So
long" would have been genial and up-to-date. No doubt
the true sentiment will have been understood by our French
friends, who will think that "it might have been infinitely
better expressed."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MARSHALL P. WILDER is known in two hemispheres as one
of the best raconteurs of the day. Probably, following the
example of a fellow-labourer nearer Pall Mall, he has told his
stories so often that he is in dread of repeating himself in the
hearing of chance audiences. Pursuing the lead indicated,
be has accordingly published them in a volume to which he
gives the characteristic name The. Sunny Side of the Street.
My Baronite, looking through the pages, misses the irresistibly
merry face of the story-teller and the surprise of the abrupt
conclusion which left the listener wondering where the point
of the joke was. When it flashed upon him, as it never failed
to do, it was enjoyed the more for the hesitation. There is a
good deal of wisdom in MARSHALL'S wit. Ho has met most
notable people in New York and London, and chats delightfully
about them.
The latest work issued by the Walter Scott Publishing
Co., Ltd., in its useful and interesting series entitled The
Makers of British Art, edited by JAMES A. MAXSON, is
William Hogarth. It is described by its author, G. BALDWIN
BROWN, M.A., Professor of Fine Art in the University of
Edinburgh, as an attempt at "a fresh and independent treat-
ment of HOOARTH'S life and art," and, as such, it is likely to
achieve, mainly on account of Professor BROWN'S treatment of
what will always be one of the subjects most popular with
all interested in British Art, a greater success than any of
its predecessors, excepting, perhaps, Thomas Gainsborough,
R.A., by A. E. FLETCHER, and Sir Joshua Reynolds, P.R.A.,
by ELSA D'ESTERRE KEELING. So far as its modest limits
allow, the Professor, in this book, has succeeded in giving us
a delightful study of a plucky, sturdy, pugnacious, pig-
headed, typical "British" personality, that is, of WILLIAM
HOGARTH, who, as an artist, was possessed of rare genius,
unrivalled in his peculiar line, whose execution was unequal,
but whose ideas and expression of them were always origi-
nal. What he saw, he drew; and as the humour took him
so his eccentric fancy depicted whatever might be the subject
of the moment. He was a tragedian, and equally a broad,
yet subtle, comedian, who could be so successful in pure
burlesque, that his grotesque print "in the ridiculous
manner of REMBRANDT," as HOGABTH himself advertised it,
was one of his most popular performances, and commanded a
very extensive sale. How out of such small prices, as they
seem to us now-a-days, he contrived to amass a suffi-
cient, if not a considerable, fortune, is somewhat difficult
to understand. Surprised indeed must have been any one
familiar with his character, and personally acquainted
with this "little man" (taller than DAVID GARRICK, pro-
bably), to learn that, one fine morning, while yet scarcely
more than a student, or at all events only at the commence-
ment of his career, he had eloped with the handsome
daughter of Sir JAMES THORNIIH.L, Sergeant-Painter to the
King. The marriage was a most happy one; he was devoted to
his wife, and she to him. The Baron cannot help wondering
how Mrs. HOGARTH relished the pictorial progress, on canvas,
of some of the subjects in
which her husband revelled.
Fortunately he was a stern
moralist, and his manner of
teaching was to show vice its
own image "as large as life,"
as the showman says, "and
twice as natural." The plates
in this very interesting book,
given as typical specimens
of HOGARTH'S art, are well
selected, and have been re-
produced with admirable clear-
ness.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO BEHAVE AT BRIDGE.
IT is astonishing, at this time of day, how few people have
earned to conduct themselves with becoming decorum at a
Bridge-table: and we are greatly beholden to the Hon. R. C.
3-RO9VENOR for having kid down, in a recent issue of The
Westmingt-er Gazette, certain elementary rules of etiquette
which should govern the behaviour of Polite Society when
engaged in this popular and diverting pastime. Limits of
space, no doubt, precluded him from saying all that was in
lis heart; and it is here my object to attempt, with great
deference, to make good some of the gaps in his brochure.
And,first,I notice that his "few short precepts" are directed
to the guidanea of beginners of
Both Sexes.
Thus, at the very outset, he is anxious to disabuse his readers
of the idea that in Bridge there is one law for the woman and
another for the man. This is well, for there is a false im-
pression abroad, due to mistaken notions of chivalry, that the
male may claim a greater clemency from his female partner
than he would have a right to expect from one of his own
sex. Such a principle may serve for trivial sports like
lawn tennis or croquet: but where a game is played for
money it is by that fact lifted into an altogether nobler
region where the question of sex is, for the time being,
eliminated. For example, the plea of inability to pay a
Bridge debt through the absence of a pocket to hold money
is just as inadmissible for a man as for a woman.
Now, to quote from the Hon. R. C. GROSVE\OR, "let us sup-
pose the Bridge table to be formed, and the four players
Duly Seated."
The precision with which he limits the number of players
to 'four (fully justified, since a fifth player is likely to cause
confusion, and six or more at an ordinary table might entail
over-crowding) makes it the more surprising that he should
employ so vague a phrase as " duly seated." This asks too
much of the intelligence of the reader, and I venture to
supplement it. The seats, then (deck chairs and oriental
divans should be avoided), ought, if possible, to be all of the
same height, so that no one player has a better chance than
another of looking over his opponents' hands. Even so
there is the difficulty arising from lack of uniformity in the
length of people's torsos; and this can only be met by the
use of chairs capable of being adjusted in the music-stool
manner. In any case, no seat should be so high that its
occupant cannot reach down to pick up his tricks; nor so
low that he cannot see over the edge of the table.
Again, in the choice of seats one cannot ignore
The Question cf Mirrors.
If there happens to be a mirror situated immediately behinc
one^of the chairs in such a way that the reflection of th
occupant's cards can be readily observed by his partner
then the player who has the choice of seats should make a
point of permitting this one to be secured by his opponents
For, as the Hon. tt. C. GROSVEKOR very intelligently puts it
"the good-humoured people are those who give most pleasure
to others in playing the game, and probably thereby secure
conditions as favourable as possible to their own success.'
The application of this theory to the case of the mirror-seat i
less obscure than it appears. If the original leader wins
his game, he need say nothing; whereas, if he loses, he can
then, while preserving an air of utmost good humour, cal
attention to the irregular assistance which his opponents mus
have derived from the mirror, and decline to pay his losses.
To resume. "Let us suppose the four players dul;
seated—then arises," says the Hon. R. C. GROSVEKOR,"
point of etiquette relating to the deal which, in my experi
ence, is very frequently disregarded by beginners and some-
times even by those who ought to know better; the point i
liis, that the dealer has the right to shuffle the cards last
>efore dealing, and it is a breach of etiquette for anyone at
lie table" (spectators, it will be seen, are here ignored) "to
ake the dealer's pack of cards in hand and place them in
uch a position that the player at the dealer's right hand
Is Tempted to Cut them
and not infrequently does so) without giving the dealer a
hanceof shuffling." It would seem almost incredible that so
gross a breach of etiquette should be possible among players
if any breeding, yet we have the authority of the Hon. R. C.
JROSVEXOR that it frequently occurs. If so, it can only be ex-
_>lained by a crass ignorance, or wanton disregard, of the first
>rinciples which underlie the game. The founders of Bridge
went upon the assumption that every player
Naturally Wants to Cheat
f lie gets the chance: and many of their regulations were
constructed solely with the purpose of meeting this con-
ingency. Amongst the most vital of these rules is the one
which gives the dealer the right of shuffling the cards last,
so as to nullify any collusion on the part of his opponents.
Accordingly, for a player to put the cards in such a position
hat the dealer is tempted to neglect this precaution, is to
give him the chance of appearing to repose confidence in his
opponents' honesty, and is therefore an unpardonable breach
of propriety.
The deal being over (and the novice cannot be too urgently
reminded that the cards should be dealt from the top, not
'rom the middle or bottom, of the pack, and also in regular
rotation, so that each player receives an equal consignment)
we come to the question of declaring. On this point the
Hon. R. C. GROSVEXOR holds "That the dealer should allow a
•easonable time to elapse, in every instance, before deciding
whether he will make the declaration himself or leave the
lecision to his partner." This is a very sound suggestion,
and, if it were more frequently followed, we should hear less
of such cases as that of the dealer who, after a cursory
glance at the corners of his cards, instantly declares No
Trumps
On the Strength of Three Ace»,
which, on a closer inspection, prove to be fours; or, on the
other hand, of the dealer who considers his cards abstractedly
for 5£ minutes, and then asks who has dealt. But it is doubt-
ful if this counsel of perfection will ever be realised until
the authorities introduce a compulsory system of time-fuses.
We next come to the right method of declaring. Now
about this the Hon. R. C. GROSVEKOR—in my opinion very
•roperly, though his literary style might perhaps be bettered—
olds the view that "on making the declaration, whether by the
dealer or his partner, no word or other indication of any kind
should be allowed to escape from either of them giving any
hint as to the contents of their hands." But I would go
further and place similar restrictions on the dealer when
Passing the Declaration.
For, should he say aloud, as he leaves it to his partner,
"A couple more aces and I'd go No Trumps myself;" or,
"No, I never hare made an original declaration of Diamonds
with five to the Queen, and I won't now ;" or, "In case you
thought of dcckring Hearts, I have four pretty good ones;"
or (flinging his cards across to his partner), "Did you ever
see such a rotten Spade hand?"-—any one of these speeches—
and, still more, the action accompanying the last—would be
tantamount to an intimation, however closely veiled, of the
contents of his hand.
On a future occasion I may have more to say on the subject
of Bridge Behaviour; and in the meantime I shall watch,
carefully to see the effect on Society of the doctrines incul-
cated by the Hon. R. C. GROSVEXOR and with great humility
supplemented by myself. 0. S.

POLITICAL ECONOMY IN THE PARK.
SCENE—Near tlie Marble Arch. TIME—Sunday evening. By
tlie Kiosk the usual raucous Atheist is criticising the
Bible in tlie usual spout of cheap buffoonery. Next to
Jiim is a voluble Hungarian, advocating an optimistic view
of the -future state. A little -further on, an orthodox
circle are singing hymns with a tuneful but mildly pug-
nacious refrain. Somewhat apart from all these coteries
a small group has collected round a couple of disputants.
One is an intelligent artisan, with a keen sallow face and
brown eyes with a dull glitter in them; the other is a little old
gentleman of venerable appearance, whose soft black felt
hat, large clean white collars, and silvery hair and beard,
give him a semi-professional air. Between them stands a
mysterious-looking man with grizzled curls falling to his
shoulders, who observes themboth with close and impartial
attention, and seems to be reserving Ids final decision
until the argument is concluded.
Tlie Intelligent Artisan. My argument is that any monopoly
of money is against the interests of the community as a 'ole.
That's the point you 'ave to meet!
The Old Gentleman (after squeezing all his features together
in the effort to concentrate his thoughts). You assert the fact—
but, so far, you have not advanced any arguments which, in
my opinion, establish it.
The I. A. That's not my fault. If you 're too fogged to
see it I can't make you—now can I?
The 0. G. To begin with, I entirely deny that there is, or
can be, any such thing as a monopoly of money.
The I. A. Why, you know as well as what I do that a small
and privileged class—bankers, financiers, and such like—'ave
the sole right at present of issuing money.
The 0. G. I know nothing of the sort. What is to prevent
anyone here from starting a bank to-morrow—if he has the
uecoasary capital?
A Bystander (who has omitted to share for the last day or
lico). Just so! It's a free country, ain't it?
The I. A. When you use the term "necess'ry," you're
taggtn' tlie 'ole question. What / say is that Capital
oughtn't to be necess'ry at all. I claim that every man ought
to 'ave the right to issue notes on the security of the future
product of the labour of his 'ands.
The Unshaven B. You '11 excuse me. -but is not wealth pro-
duced by the labour of a man's head as well as his hands?
The I. A. No, no—that's whore you're wrong. Wealth
has never yet been perdooced by a man's 'ed— on'y by 'is
'ands, as I can prove to you in a moment. Let us put it, for
the sake of argyment, that the world's Capital amounts to one
'undred pounds, while its wealth is of exackly the same value.
Well, then, it follers that for hevery pound:

come to you presently. As for the 'undred pounds, I was
merely taking that figger as a basis. Make it a million, or a
billion pounds, for all I care—it don't affect my illustration!
Tlie 0. G. I object to your illustration on the ground that
it is an impossible one. The world's Capital never has been
and never will be exactly balanced by its wealth.
The I. A. All I 'm endeavouring—if you '11 allow me to 'ave
my say out—is to prove to our friend 'ere that Labour is not
dependent on Capital in any way whatsoever.
The Unshaven. But wouldn't you say that Labour depended
on Capital for employment?
The I. A. Certingly I should not. Their interests are;
diametric'ly opposed—as I '11 undertake to show in 'alf a'
minute.
The Unshaven. Well, but look here now. Suppose I have
a few hundred pounds, and invest it in building a house
over there. (Indicating Connaught Place?) Well,—
The. 0. 0. (with guarded approval). Yes, you 've hit on the |
right line there—you may be going to follow it up by the ]
proper argument, though I doubt it—but go on.
The Unshaven (encouraged). Am I not providing employ-
ment and wages for bricklayers, carpenters, and such like?
The I. A. (condescendingly). I '11 tell you what your mistake'
is. Wages aren't paid out of Capital at all. They 're paid j
entirely out of the producks of Labour. Similarly with interest.
What right, I arsk you, has Capital to be paid interest just
for laying idle?
The 0. 0. Since you seem to be attacking interest now, let
me put this case to you: I have a hundred pounds to spare,
and I buy fifty trucks or barrows at two pounds apiece, and
let them out at sixpence a day—that is, seven pounds ten a
week. Do you say I am doing wrong? [He beams with the
triumphant expression of a modern SOCRATES.]
The I. A. (after considering this problem). By no means—
unless, mind you, unless you are thereby creating a monopoly.
That's all I 'm arguing against. I contend that every man
has a free right to the use of land, air, and water, without
being interfered with by anybody whatsoever.
Tlie 0. G. Then my answer to that is that he has no such
rights, under present conditions.
The I. A. (seizing his advantage). "Under present condi-
tions!" There you are. Now you 've gone and given away
your 'ole case. I'm trying to get those conditions altered.
And, while on that point, I may mention that where CHAM-
BERLAIN makes his grand mistake, is that 'e
The 0. G. Before we go any further, are you for Free Trade
or Protection? . . . Very well then, so far, I 'm with you
[At this stage the mysterious man with the long curls, who
has been looking as if he might intervene vrith an
illuminating remark at any moment, suddenly loses all
interest in the discussion and glides quietly away;
there follows a lengthy argument as to what Mr. CHAM-
BERLAIN did or did not say on various occasions, and
how far his own words may be accepted as evidence of
his policy—after which tJie Old Gentleman resumes—
Well, I am old enough to remember the days long before

him). Then you done very well!
The I. A. (to the 0. G.) I want to 'ave it out with you about
the land. You 'aven't met me on that point yet.
The 0. G. I am far from saying that our Land Laws do
not need reform
The I. A. Reform? They want to be done away with
altogether! I 'd 'ave every man entitled to use the land
equally without being ordered off it by nobody.
Tlie 0. G. Equally—but that's tlie difficulty. Suppose 1
build two houses at a thousand pounds apiece
The V. A. (deeply impressed by such enterprise). That's a
tidy bit o' money, Guv'nor!
The 0. G. (ignoring him). And suppose I build one house
in the middle of Hackney Marshes
The I. A. You 'd 'ave to be a loonertic to do that! 'Oo 's
giving impossible illustrations now?
Tlie 0. G. I allowed you to finish your illustration—you 're
interrupting me in the middle of mine!
The V. A. (losing all faith in him as a practical man). And
right, too—torking sech rot as that!
The 0. G. (witheringly). When you have made yourself
acquainted with the A B C of the question you will have the
right to correct other people's arguments—but not till then.
(To the I. A.) And suppose I build the other house
The I. A. That's all very well — but we 're getting fur
away from our original point, which is 'ow wealth can be
circulated to the best advantage. And I end as I began by
asserting that no class ought to 'ave the exclusive monopoly
of money.
The 0. G. And I repeat that you have not yet shown me
that any such monopoly exists.
The I. A. If I 'ave not done so it's because you 'aven't a
mind that's capable of follering my arguments—and I can't
be expected to 'elp that. But if you'd read JOHN STCAHT
MILL'S Summary (which in my opinion is the best thing he
ever wrote), you'd see it laid down there that you cannot
increase the issue of money without instantly raising the
price of food.
The 0. G. I have read all JOHN STUART MILL'S works several
times over, but I do not recall any statement to that effect.
And if you were to talk for ever, you would never convince
777e that
The I. A. I dessay not. And I '11 tell you why. Because
you 'aven't studied the subject sufficiently to reason it out for
yourself. So, as I can't waste any more o' my time (he elboics
his way out of the circle), I '11 wish yer good-night.
The 0. G. I studied the subject and reasoned it out for

The I. A. (firing a Parthian shot before disappearing in the
crowd). Then all I can say to you is that it's a pity you didn't
reason it out right while you were about it!
The 0. G. (buttonholing the nearest Bystander). I can show
you the fallacy of my late opponent's so-called arguments by
a very simple illustration. I will assume that you are a

FOR HEROES AND LEANDERS.
THE NEW HOTEL FOB CHANNEL SWIMMERS.
SWIMMINO the Channel is about to be
put upon a sound and practical basis,
the experimental stage now being con-
sidered over. Plans for a large hotel
on the Dover shore, which is to be the
last word in sensational natation, have
just been passed by the Town Council;
while, as soon as the form and serious-
ness of the swimmers suggest that it
is necessary, a sister establishment will
be set up on the French coast. This
building will be of novel construction,
the intention being to erect it upon
wheels, so that it can quickly be moved
to whatever point the successful swimmer
(supposing one to emerge) seems to be ap-
proaching, and thusbe ready to supply him
with refreshment and lodging and those
requirements of civilisation which are now
expected by those who cleave the main in
the full glare, so to speak, of the public
eye. A competent staff of pushers will be
in attendance day and night to move the
hotel whenever and wherever needed.
To return to the Dover hotel, the
existence of which is not problematical
but certain, all Channel Swimmers having
been observed to start. A name has
not yet been chosen for it, the manage-
ment hesitating between "The Trudg-
eon," "The Swinburne Arms," and "The
Forlorn Hope." Beneath the building
will be a swimming-bath of considerable
size, in which practice can be taken
when the weather is too inclement out-
side, and in which the art of absorbing
food while swimming may be acquired.
This art is by no means easy, and, in-
deed, many swimmers attribute their
failure to reach Grisnez less to lacking
strength and endurance than to inability
to swallow beef-tea without at the same
time swallowing the Pas de Calais.
Swimmers can also experiment in this
bath with patent foods, and floating
writing-pads will be provided on which
they can record the results.
A propoa of advertisement, we are
reminded that an advertising agent of
American extraction will have a per-
manent office in the hotel, and will give
his whole time to the invention of new
and ingenious devices to bring and keep
the names of the champions before a
public for whom the month oE August
would be arid indeed were it not for
attempts upon the Channel. The rooms
for the swimmers and their suites will
be around the bath, and above these will
be a series of apartments for captains
of tugs and purveyors of meat essences.
The various German bands and gramo-
phone operators will be located in out-
houses, while at the top of the main
building will be a telegraph office, and
around it the rooms of the representa-
tives of the leading papers, the Press

"SO SOBBT I 'M LATE. I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TOO IJOIlED!"
"On NO, THANKS. I'VE BEEN NURSING THE CAT TILL YOU COULD OOME."
Association and the Central News.
There will also be sufficient accommoda-
tion for those persons who cannot swim,
but yet wish it to be understood that
they also have designs on the Channel.
Professors of every kind of stroke will
be in attendance night and day. The
HOI.BF.IX back stroke, which leaves the
face free to contemplate the sun in its
various eclipses and the pageant of the
starry heavens, will be imparted to all
who wish it; likewise the breast, stroke
of the indomitable and saucy BURGESS,
the elastic freedom of the fair and buoy ish
KELLERMAN, the loopish lupineness of
WOLFF, and the cat-like movements of Mr.
MEW. Nothing in short will be left
undone that can help to popularise this
new August and September pastime,
which bids fair to rival in. attraction
both Bridge and Jiu-jitsu.
When the hotel is ready it has been
decided to ask Mr. SWINBURNE for an
opening ode, which will probably bear
the title " The Channel's Cross-currents,"
and will be recited by the spirited bard
hand-in-hand with his life-long friend
and most masterly critic Mr. THEODORE
WATTS-DI;NTON, each declaiming alternate
lines. The effort, it is anticipated, will be
very novel and charming. At the comple-
tion ot the recitation the directors, all of
whom are old swimmers who have won
many a gallant contest with the tides in
Herne Bay, the Serpentine, Round Pond,
and other arenas of desperate natation,
will plunge simultaneously into the sea
from the Admiralty Pier and perform
startling evolutions. They will then
emerge, and after some brisk excoriation
from specially woven huckaback towels,
will entertain the gallant company to
lunch, a suitable grace being uttered by
Prebendary and Captain WEBB-PEPLOE.

NATURE STUDIES.
THE DANDIE DINMONT.
THE particular Dandie Dinmont who has conferred upon me
the privileges of possessing him and providing him with
food, bedding, brush and comb, and a garden for him to
delve in, is a year old. In appearance he is the most ridicu-
lous object that Nature ever invented in one of her freakish
moods. His wheel-base—if I may borrow a term from the
motorist—is the longest I have ever seen in proportion to his
height, which cannot, at a liberal estimate, exceed six inches
at the shoulder. There never has existed a dog who was at
the same time so long and (in another sense) so short. His
absurd front legs—if things so brief can indeed be called legs
—begin with a most prodigious sweeping curve, and then
terminate in two comic paws set at a sharp angle outwards.
The top of his head is as flat as the striking surface of THOR'S
hammer, and the ridge of his back goes in switch-back
gradients to join his long and impudently defiant tail.
About his hair, however, save where it bushes over his eyes,
there is no absurdity. It is of a light grey colour—he is a
"pepper "—and in part it has the fine texture of silk. His
eyes, too, are noble, for they are brown, a rich brown, and
they have in them unplumbed depths of faithfulness, pathos,
and alert intelligence. His fixed home is an open basket in
the day nursery, but more often than not, and especially on
muddy days, he condescends to curl himself up on the seats
of arm-chairs in the drawing-room or library.
It must not be supposed that this preposterous person has
any sense of his own absurdity. On the contrary he has a
most notable pomposity of demeanour, supposed, by his
detractors, to have been acquired from constant companion-
ship with a gigantic St. Bernard dog, whom he worships,
bullies, and leads into mischief. When he is trotting beside
Rollo he is obviously and serenely unconscious of any differ-
ence in their sizes, weights, and muscular powers. He has
the deportment and, for the matter of that, the courage of his
majestic tawny friend, and the fact that he is occasionally
trampled into flatness by a negligent paw never discomposes
him for long, and has not had the least effect upon his settled
convictions.
This morning the Dandie was digging in the garden, and
was pursuing the exercise with his customary and almost
inconceivable ardour. He does not care where he digs, for
many marks of his prowess are to be seen upon the tennis
lawn, and many others are to be found amongst the flower-
beds. On this occasion he had chosen some geraniums that
are planted against a wall of the house. His leglets were
making the earth fly with an incredible velocity. Deeper and
wider grew the hole; the sky was darkened with the earthy
and scarlet-petalled shower of his excavations. Smack! He
has been discovered and for the fiftieth time a whip has
descended on his back. A yelping, grey streak of lightning
has shot across the path, and in the space of a second he is
standing indignant on the lawn a hundred yards away.
At this moment of gloom he saw a sight which at once
revived his drooping spirits. A gardener was trundling a
heavy wheelbarrow along one of the walks. Now a gardener
is always an enemy, but when his hands are free he is a
dangerous enemy, for he can throw stones and use sticks,
and must, therefore, be avoided. But when a gardener is
trundling a wheelbarrow, all he can do is to kick rearwards
clumsily and without proper direction. Seeing his hereditary
foe thus handicapped the Dandie lost no time. In a flash he
had hurtled across the intervening grass and had flung him-
self, barking viciously, against the lower inches of the
gardener's corduroys. The eyes of his mistress being upon
him, the gardener attempted under these distressing circum-
stances to maintain an impassive horticultural dignity, and
ever, as he wheeled, the little dog sprang with short repeated
darts at the moving legs.
At last the Dandie desisted from this joyous sport—but
only to take up another equally delightful, and even less
dangerous. On the other side of the lawn a nurserymaid
was pushing a perambulator. By the dog-star, he seemed to
say, here is a second wheeling victim! In another moment,
still barking his battle-cry, he was amongst her skirts, and
in another the perambulator was deserted, the baby was
yelling with apprehension, and the nurserymaid, a shrieking
and distraught semblance of humanity, was making for a
bench in feverish and laughable zig-zags, while the bandy-
legged fiend was chasing her from stop to stop with a zest
proportioned to her ruin.
After this exploit he seemed to be sated with mere spiritual
amusements, for he retired by devious paths to the kitchen,
and became a meek and wheedling, not to say a cringing, little
dog. Having prevailed over the not inflexible temper of the
cook, he returned to the lawn bearing in his mouth a beef
bone as large as his own body. Over this he gnawed and
growled till it was time to bury it amongst the bushes and
repair to the nursery for dinner, with a tell-tale pyramidjjf
earth upon his nose.
THE GOLF HABIT.
BY AN INVOLUNTARY SLAVE.
EVEN as one that ventures, in his strength,
On some slow drug, and seems to take no ill,
But surely weakening finds himself at length
Thrall to a tabloid, bondsman to a pill,
So I, that sought a charm whereof men rave,
That did but nibble, as it were in jest,
Am grown a Public Scoffing and a slave,
Me wretched! to a practice I detest.
For me the nights go heavily. For me
Day brings the burn, the tussock, and the whin,
The foozled anguish of a Club-house tee
Crowded with sportsmen pawing to begin.
Through the long hours a weariful course I trace
With piteous "top " and agitating " pull,"
Or squander on th' illimitable space
Blows that would stun an ordinary bull.
The wild turfs leap to my impassioned scoops;
The thick clouds gather o'er the bunker's bed;
And the sliced ball precariously swoops
In imminent circles round a stranger's head.
Daylong and daylong, be it fine or damp,
Summer or winter, I may never flag;
If wet, I take a multi-coloured gamp;
I[ dry, the caddie has it in his bag.
So grinds the old wheel on. And every day
I loathe the stubborn traffic more and more;
Nightly I vow to give my clubs away,
Only to start next morning as before;
Only to find more painful and more slow
My devious passaging from tee to green
(A hole I did in ten a week ago
I missed this afternoon in seventeen);
Only to salve the pangs of my despair
With shattered shafts and stamping of the feet,
And bell my sorrows to the ambient air
In terms that border on the indiscreet. Dcu-DuM.

EXTRACTS FEOM THE DIARY OF
A STATESMAN.
"The Right Hon. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN left
on Saturday morning for the Continent. No
letters will be forwarded to him." — Daily
Telegraph, Aug. 21.]
Aug. 22.— No letters. What a relief
and what a contrast to my usual average
of 250 a day! Must devote my leisure
to extending my acquaintance with con-
temporary literature. Tried MAETER-
LINCK'S Treasure of the Humble this
morning, but found it rather visionary
and unpractical. In the afternoon read
part of Aglavaine and Selysette, but
thoiight it very aglavaining, I mean
aggravating. Must ask AVEBURY if
MAETERLINCK really does know anything
about bees, or only has one in his
bonnet.
Aug. 23.—No letters. It certainly does
simplify life a great deal, but one can't
help wishing to know what people are
doing. The foreign newspapers are all
very well, but they can't be always
trusted. For instance, I see it stated
that Lord RITCHIE, the celebrated British
statesman (! ! !), will probably re-enter
the Cabinet. That would indeed be the
last straw. Read BROWNING'S Lost Leader
after lunch. Strange that ARTHUR BAL-
FOITR has never written to congratulate
me on CURZON'S resignation. By Jove,
though, he's probably seen that notice
about my correspondence and acted
accordingly. After tea read some of
DICKENS'S Oliver Jjodge, I mean to say
Oliver Twist. That reminds me that
when I get back to Birmingham I must
really try to get OLIVER LODGE to write
or lecture on the transcendental side of
Tariff Reform. I believe it's the only
subject of importance he hasn't written
on since his appointment as Principal of
the Birmingham University.
Aug. 24.—No letters. Tried to read
some Tolstoi after breakfast, but gave it
up in disgust. My doctor recommends
me to try golf croquet, but I haven't
sunk so low as that yet. Wonder what
JESSE COLLINGS is doing with himself.
He doesn't shoot grouse, I know, but
CHAPLIN does, and HOWARD VINCENT has
gone off the rails over the Volunteer
Question. . . . Went to hear the band
play this afternoon. I know nothing
about music, and it doesn't affect me
much, but there's no doubt it does
influence some people amazingly. I
wonder if ELGAR, our new music pro-
fessor at Birmingham, could be induced
to compose a symphony or overture on
Imperial Preference? Must talk it over
with ARTHUR BALFOUR.
Aug. 25.—No letters. Really this is
, getting beyond a joke. This morning
I was reduced to playing golf croquet,
and can no longer say that I never take
any exercise or indulge in any pastime.

THE POINT OF VIEW.
Mr. Drivler. "On! WHAT A LOVELY AFTERNOON! LET TODB EYES REST WHERE THEY WILT..
MlBB ROSIE, AND THEY SEE NOTHING THAT IS NOT SXgVIStTELY BEAUTIFUL!"
Aug. 26.—A picture post-card, and
from JESSE CALLINGS! Dear old JESSE!
I almost shed tears when it was handed
me. Effect on my health and spirits
simply miraculous. Defying my doctor,
wrote long letters to ARTHCR BALFOUR,
HE WINS, CHARLES BOOTH, LEO MAXSE, Baron
SUYEMATSC, and MINTO. Listened to the
pianola without any irritation for half-
an-hour after lunch, and telegraphed to
the Times giving my address, and re-
moving embargo on correspondence.
More Commercial Candour.
"SEA-FISHING tackle sold here, fresh,
up-to-date. Certain to deceive the most
wary."
SWIMMING the Channel is not the only
ambition of our atliletes. A number of
golfing experts recently reached Dover
intent upon driving a ball from Shake-
speare's Cliff to the Calais shore. Messrs.
JESSOP and JOE DARLING are also in-
tending to try to slog there.

[" IT is an old nnd perhaps a trne legend that
in the days of TITUS the women of Venire
used to sit with their long tresses loose in the

chestnut tinge which is still distinguished
to-day as Venetian red. It is another old, and,
possibly, equally accurate tradition that Blue-
coat boys and butchers' assistants are exempt
from baldness, because they wear no covering
on their heads."—Daily Telegraph.]
THE Daily Telegraph's theory, as
expressed above, so attracted and in-
trigued Mr. Punch that he made some
inquiries among great or prominent
capillariahs to endeavour to obtain rati-
fication or denial as to the efficiency of
the sun's rays in promoting growth and a
golden tinge. We have the authority of
the gifted and retiring author of The
Prodigal Son (not Sun) at Drury Line,
who has put it on record that he attri-
butes the ruddy hue of his own wool (as
he humorously calls it) to a long sitting
without his hat on the summit of
Shakspeare's Cliff at Dover, where once
the natives "gathered samphire (dreadful
trade)." Before that time it was coal-
black.
Other letters on the subject have
reached us.
Mr. CLKMEST SHORTHAIR writes: "I
can neither support nor disprove the
Telegraph's theory. My own raven
tresses, so ample and so glossy, have
rarely been exposed to the rays of the
sun; but their luxuriousness none can
deny, despite my paradoxical cogno-
men."
Mr. GBOROE R. SIMS writes: "I am
constrained to believe that the action of
the sun has no connection whatever
with the growth of what might be called
human mustard and cress. My own
conviction is that that growth can be
promoted only by the assiduous applica-
tion of a patent preparation known
as—
[Oh no you don't.—ED.]
Mr. P. F. WARNER writes: "I wish I
could support the theory that the sun
is a safe cure for want of thatch, Vmt
unhappily I cannot. I have given it
every chance in the field this year, but
in vain. I am still as I was. Would
that I could be no-bald!"
It will be seen that the evidence that
we have been able to collect from three
of the most eminent men in their respec-
tive walks of life now living does not
very strongly endorse the fascinating con-
tention of our ingenious contemporary.
None the less, we are not disposed to
go back on Le Pere, Soleil yet. It is
manifest that the truth of the contention
can lie tested only by a deliberate period
of immunity from sunsliine on the part
of the hirsute and a similar period of
sunbaths on the part of the hairless. A
period of immunity will be offered by
to-day's eclipse, but the duration will be
probably too short for any marked de-
crease in hair to be noticed by the
astronomers who are implicated in that
celestial event, while the vahie of the
experiment would in any case be vitiated
by the circumstance that most of them
(not, of course, including Sir NORMAN
LOCKOHAIR) are more or less bald already.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE END OF A RECORD
MINISTRY.
(Being the intelligent anticipation of a leading
article from the Daily Telegraph, April '2,
1936.)
LAST night the House of Commons
witnessed the most dramatic, disastrous,
and epoch-making event that political
history has yet recorded. After an
utterly unparalleled career of nearly
forty years, a period rich in benefits for
so many important classes of the British
Nation, Mr. BALFOCR'S Ministry was
defeated yesterday evening, under cir-
cumstances which will bring nothing
but eternal shame and dishonour upon
an already discredited Opposition. For
some time it had been known that the
Liberal Party had
fixed upon the first
of April as the occa-
sion for a malevo-
lent attack upon the
Government; and
as, since Lord
ALBERT CECIL'S un-
fortunate defeat at
Kensington, Mr.
BALFOUR at full
strength could only
rely upon a majority
of one, a most urgent
whip had been de-
spatched through-
out the Unionist
Party, commanding
attendance at all
costs. Thanks to
the "Political Sub-
stitute Bill," wisely
passed through by
the Prime Minister
during the previous
session, those sup-
porters of the
the affectionate efforts of Lord ALGERNON
and Lord PERCY CECIL.
When Sir WINSTON CHURCHILL rose
amidst the applause of the Opposition,
the benches were crowded to their utmost
capacity. In the Peers' Gallery there
was also a notable attendance, including
the Marquis CARMELITE, Earl VINCE, Lord
HEWINS, and many other distinguished
members of the Upper Chamber. The
Opposition amendment had been worded
with an elaborate but obvious cunning,
which from its very nature was bound
to fail in its object of detaching the
necessary vote from the Conservative
Party;
"That in the opinion of this House the time
has now arrived when His Majesty's Govern-
ment should declare' their 'intentions with

"Mr. Balfour was aroused, and expressed a desire to end the debate."
Governmentwho were too aged and infirm
to take the journey to the House were able
to send down their valets with power of
attorney to vote for them. Since no fewer
than two hundred and one availed them-
selves of the privilege, it will be realised
what a stern, fighting spirit animated the
loyal and united party which has so faith-
fully supported its beloved leader for
nearly half a century. Despite the
hundred summers that have floated over
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S venerable head, tlie
veteran statesman had announced his
intention of replying in person to Sir
WINSTON CHURCHILL'S amendment; and
when the grand old warrior entered the
House, leaning upon the arms of Mr.
DAVID COLLINGS and Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBF.U-
LAIN, Jr., he was welcomed by a storm of
cheering that was only surpassed by
the terrific outburst that a few moments
later greeted the arrival of the Prime
Minister, who, gracefully reclining in a
deck chair, was carried to his seat by
regard to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S proposed altera-
tions in the Fiscal Policy of the country."
Speaking with much assumed warmth
and vehemence, the Leader of the Opposi-
tion at once plunged into an attack upon
the Ministry, which for personal rancour
and malicious virulence will remain, we
trust, for all time the classical and
unenviable example. He soon deserted
the subject of the amendment, and pro-
ceeded to range over the whole field of
Government policy. With concentrated
venom he referred to Mr. BALFOUR'S
masterly repeal of the S9ptennial Act
(1906) as "the most flagrant example
o[ political immorality that has
representatives of the Unionist members
by referring to their presence as "tlie
most deliberate and impertinent affront
that had ever been offered to a long-
suffering House." Then, returning to
the amendment, he demanded from Mr.
BALFOUR a plain answer as to whether he
was in favour of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S scheme
or not. At this point he paused dramati-
cally, and loud cries of "Answer" arose
from the benches behind him. When it
was discovered, however, that Mr.
BALFOUR was fast asleep, Sir WINSTON
resumed his attack, which henceforth
he directed towards Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
who, with an impassive smile of con-
tempt upon his face, was sitting exactly
opposite. Lashing himself into a fine
pretence of indignation, the Liberal
Leaderdeclaredthat
thirty-two years ago
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
had stated that the
immediate adoption
of his scheme was
absolutely essential
if the Empire were
to be saved; and
that since then,
despite every in-
ducement and op-
portunity being
offered to him by
the Liberal Party,
he had never had
the courage to bring
it before the House.
If Mr. BALFOUR
agreed with him,
which on seventy-
six distinct occa-
sions the Member
for West Birming-
ham had stated to
l>e the case, why had
the Government
stained
alluded
ever
He
to the Redistribution Bill of
the pages of history."
1914, which had brought the Govern-
ment majority from 7 up to 96, as "a
piece of shameless corruption, which in
any other department of life would have
obtained the punishment that it merited,"
and concluded by grossly insulting the
not adopted his ideas? If, on the other
hand, Mr. BALFOUR was opposed to him,
as Lord HUGH CECIL had passionately
affirmed no fewer than seventy-five times,
why did not the Prime Minister say so,
and end this intolerable atmosphere of
sham and shuffle? (Loud and prolonged
cheering.)
With the assistance of his grandson,
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was upon his feet
almost before Sir WINSTON had resumed
his place, which probably accounts for
the sustained nature of the applause.
In a few brief but eloquent words he
completely shattered the edifice of make-
believe which the Opposition Leader had
taken such pains to erect. Needless to
say, his logical, patriotic, and crushing
exposure of the Free Trade case was
received with
"The Leader
the wildest enthusiasm,
of the Opposition," lie
declared, "was one of those unfortunate
individuals who were the friends of every
country but their own." (Cheers.) "In

order to snatch a miserable party advan-
tage he did not hesitate to imperil the
future of his native land." {Cheers.)
"Hon. Members would do well to reniem-
lx>r that every vote given to the Liberals
was a vote sold to Germany." (Cheers
and protests.) "He believed that this
generation would hand down untarnished
the sceptre of empire which they had
received from their forefathers." (Loud
cheers.)
The debate was continued with great
enthusiasm by Members of both Parties.
On the Government side powerful
speeches were contributed by Lord HUGH
CECIL, Lord PEHCT CECIL, Lord ROBERT
CECIL, Lord ALGERNON CECIL, and Mr.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, Jr. At half-past
eleven Mr. BALFOUR was aroused, and
expressed his desire to end the debate.
When the applause that greeted his
decision had died away, the Prime
Minister began his speech with evident
traces of emotion. "It was not his
fault," he declared, "if nature had
denied to the Liberal Party sufficient
intelligence to understand the English
language. The question was so com-
plicated, and his attitude towards it so
simple, that it was impossible for him
to express it in any cruder language than
that of which he had already been guilty.
As for the gross and unjustifiable attack
upon his life-long friend the Member for
West Birmingham" (at this point he
turned to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN with tears
in his eyes), "well, all he could say was
that in his opinion the late Colonial
Secretary was the second greatest states-
man in English history. As for there
having been any discord between the
right hon. gentleman and himself"
here Mr. BALFOUR'S emotion became pain-
ful to witness. Two or three times he
tried to continue his speech, but the
effort was too great; and with a faint
exclamation that sounded like "liars,"
the Prime Minister sank back in his seat
unconscious. So overcome was Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN at this proof of affection,
that for the first and only time in his
life his feelings got the better of him,
and amid the wildest excitement in the
House he also fainted away in the arms
of Mr. DAVID COIXINGS.
Then occurred an incident almost
incredible in its lack of political decency.
A Member of the Opposition, whose
name we will not sully our page by
writing, rose to his feet, and moved
"that the amendment be now put."
Frantic but unavailing efforts were made
to revive the two distinguished invalids;
and when the division lists were read
for the amendment, the record Ministry
of history had been defeated by one vote.
It would be as impossible as it is
superfluous to enumerate the services
rendered to the country by the late
Government. We only offer our wannest
congratulations to the two incomparable
Ministers who are now released from the
thankless labours at which they have
toiled so long. In the words of the last
great English poet:
"Even the weariest river
Winds somewhere safe to sea ;"
and Mr. BALFOUR and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
have well earned the rest and honour
which they will enjoy, before sinking
into the boundless ocean of eternal fame.
A thousand memorable phrases leap in-
stinctively into our mind as applicable
to their unparalleled careers; but perhaps
from the garden of history we can cull
the flower that may most acceptably be
laid at their feet as a tribute of a nation's
gratitude; and, in view of the sublime
and pathetic manner in which the end of
the Ministry was brought about, inscribe
on their memorial in letters of gold and
granite that nothing in their political
life became them like the leaving of it.
A FOUR-BALL BREAK.
"CROQUET? With you? No. I'm
blowed if"
"Lady ANGELA wants to play, and of
course that means HARRY."
"Oh, well, if Lady ANGELA—all right.
I'll play with her. Make a better
game."
"No. I want her to play with HARRY."
"But I don't want"
"To play with me? You used to,
JACK, when—before"
"Before we were married? Yes, I
know, but that was —• oh, very well.
Have it your own way. Only don't ask
my advice and then not take it."
"As if I ever did! Very well, I
won't, if you '11 promise not to lose your
temper."
"Lose my temper! Really, you are
the most aggravating person I 've ever
come across. You know perfectly well
I never do. Not now."
"H'm. Well, no, you don't; not like
you used to. You don't throw your
mallet about and swear. But you
scowl and look sulky and say nothing,
and that's worse. And you 're always
thinking about your stupid old four-
ball game, and expecting me to—Here
they come. Shall we call? Heads!
Heads it is. Shall we begin, JACK?"
"Why, of course. It's the game."
"Oh, yes, I know you always say so.
I never can see it."
"But, my dear child, the whole object
of the game is to get the balls first, so if
you win the toss—however, let's have
it your way. Will you be red or
yellow?"
"Perhaps we'd better begin, if it's
the game. I '11 be blue. Or would you
rather go first?"
"Just as you like."
"Oh, very well, then. I'll be black.
No, blue. Only I won't play the four-
ball thingummy. It spoils the game.
I shall go through the second hoop."
"But it's sheer—oh, very well. Please
yourself."
"Well, what do you want me to do,
then?"
"Of course, what you ought to do is to
come off here, and then I'11 lay you a
rush. Still, if you don't like"
"Oh, well, here goes. Is that right?
They're sure to hit us. There, what
did I tell you? Much better have done
what I said."
"Not at all. It's no use to her. She
can't go to the second hoop, and she
can't stay near you. And if she'd
missed"
"Yes, but she didn't miss. No one
could at that distance. Now what are
you going to do?"
"Coming to you, of course."
"Oh, well, but you haven't hit me. I
knew you wouldn't."
"I didn't want to, my dear. Wasn't
the game to try to. Now, you see, you '11
be able to hit me, and then—confound!
He's hit her. What an infernal fluke!
Xow he'll come and separate us.
Dash the fellow! . . . I never saw such
luck. He ought to have been off the
ground then. Of course, now he '11 go
the whole way round."
"Exactly what I say. Your wretched
four-ball break. Don't you see what I
mean? I hate these long turns. They
simply ruin the game. It's all the fault
of people who will make games too
scientific. They 're all the same nowa-
days. Why can't you just play the
game as a game, like I do, and not—oh,
he 's missed!'
"Jove! Now you've got them. Abso-
lutely set."
"Well, now, what am I to do?"
"Well, I should hit yellow first, and
send him down to the middle, and then
get a rush on red to your hoop, and then
hit red again, and send him down past
yellow, and hit yellow, and come on to
me, and ,then—see? You'll get right
round."
"But why yellow? Red's much
nearer."
"About a foot. However—oh, well,
play your own game."
"I know I shall miss yellow. I always
know—there, I knew I shouldn't hit it.
I do wish you would let me play my
own game."
"But I did. I—oh, thank goodness.
They've missed. Now it's my turn. I
ought to get the whole way round now,
and then you '11 see there really is some-
thing in the four-ball break. If you '11
just watch now how the balls go. If I
can only bring off this rush. That's all
right. (Continues talking to himself.)
Rather a good shot that. Let's see now.

SAME HAT.
A HOLIDAY-TAKER'S PETITION.
SIR,—Your influence can be felt—why may I not say it
boldly?—everywhere. Am I stating the, as I believe, un-
doubted fact too broadly? I may be doing so: I think not.
How is it then, Sir, I ask with the greatest respect, that you
do not remind the Clerk of the Weather of his duties at
holiday seasons towards holiday-takers generally? Is it
possible that you, Sir, have given the Clerk unmistakable
hints, which, ignoring, he has, self-opinionatedly, gone off on
a barometrically opposite course?
I do not know if my case is on all fours with those of a
considerable majority, or whether their cases are at sixes and
sevens with my own. Here then, Sir, is my plain un-
varnished tale, which, for you, I will polish off at once.
I am devoted to the sea, and don't mind going as far as
three-aud-sixpence. Well, Sir, for a sum less than this, having
arrived at Ramsgate for a brief holiday, I was joyfully
anticipating several short, but eminently pleasurable, voyages
from this pier as far as Folkestone Harbour, calling on the
way at Deal and Dover, on board the Mijlcla or the Edward
William, the two
capital coasting
steamers which the
South Eastern Com-
pany (combined
with theL. C.&D.
Co.) sends here regu-
larly, as I am in-
formed, for a sum-
mer season. The
Mijleta starts at the
fairly reasonable
hour of 10.15, morn-
ing, reaches Folke-
stone at 1.0, and
leaves it at 3.15,
landing you (that is,
me, and other pas-
sengers) at Rams-
gate at 6.0 to a tick.
But what has oc-
curred this season?
On the only days
when I could'possibly be down here'for a holiday, some wind
from the west or south or north-west blew so violently that
the bright blue sky was kept perfectly clear from all clouds,
while the sun shone with intensely provoking brilliancy,
and Miss Myleta'« captain, wisely, as I must own, refused
to move the neat and tidy young lady out of the harbour.
Had he acted contrariwise he would not have had a single
passenger to accompany him, certainly not myself, though
I might have been with him in spirit, drinking his health
and song in a glass of water tempered with whisky, in such
just proportion as the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb.
Three times (in my room) was I prepared to start: three
times were the rough unruly elements against me: and it
was literally "no go." Up to town for work again: lovely
weather in London. Next day a friend writes to me from
Ramsgate, "Splendid time: Mylcta going strong."
Hoping against hope I made yet another effort. Down at
Ramsgate once again. Lovely day: sea woidd have been
like proverbial mill-pond but for gentle breeze. I see the
Myleta gaily manoeuvring from its berth to the pier, whither
I hurry. As I step on board I am hailed by breathless
messenger with telegram. It may be a message of something
tremendously to my advantage, and so I take it. Oh! If
I only hadn't seen it! If only it had been kept for me until
my return! But my presence appeared to be absolutely
essential that very afternoon in London. Could I tear myself

AWFULLY SIMPLE.
away from Miss Mi/lcta!! Ah! It was hard. But at the
call of duty—per sixpenny wire—I did it. Within half an
hour I was ready to catch the train, when suddenly another
telegram met me as I was leaving my door. It said, "Meeting
postponed, no necessity to come up." A big, big D! Its
force lessened by knowledge of the fact that at least my holi-
day was not curtailed. Small by degrees and beautifully, less
was just visible the Mylcta, nearing Deal pier. Inspiration!
Train to Deal: catch Edward William, Mi/leta's twin brother,
on his way to Ramsgate. First-rate idea. Sure to find a
train. Yes; one just going. Away to Deal! Arrived 12.25.
Ha! Just in time . . .' . to be too late! Edward "William
has been gone exactly five minutes. "You can see her," says
a gruff old sailor, as hard as Deal itself, pointing in the
direction of E. W.'x track.
Now, Sir, I do not impute any blame to you, or to the
Weather Clerk, as regards the telegram, but now that before
the end of August I am able to get a few days "off," and a
few hours on the Myleta, do be so obliging as to insist influen-
tially on the aforesaid Clerk of the Weather (if he is
something more than a mere clerk, that is, a managing
clerk) fixing up
several days of un-
stormy, un - rainy
weather, with which
to finish summer
and open the Third
Act of the year, that
of Autumn, in most
effective style.
As I write every-
thing promises well.
I am inclined to be
less hard on the
meteorological, or
illogical, authori-
ties. I hasten to
join, the Myleta at
the pier-head.
Yours, in high
hopes,
AN IRREGULAR
SlllI'LY AWFUL. ROVER.

P.S. — Three-quarters of an hour after the above was
finished I returned. Alas! Fate in the shape of a strong
sou'westerly wind off Dover (so came the message) was dead
against us, or rather, very much alive against us. The
captain of the gallant Myleta gave his orders from the
bridge, and the first mate, sadly returning whatever passage-
money had been paid, informed us, all and severally, in a

CORNISH fishermen, and Devonian too, have not been much
impressed by "L'Entente." French fishing-boats, in the most
genial spirit, probably only fishing for compliments, were
caught trespassing off the Devon and Cornwall coasts and
taken in tow by a gunboat to Plymouth, where it was antici-
pated the case woidd be heard in Court, and the caught
catchers would catch it. Vive L'Entente!

HOW TO GIVE A (BACK) GARDEN
PARTY.
THERE is a mistaken idea prevalent
among the chatelaines of our smaller
British homes that the joy of garden
party giving is denied them owing to
lack of space. As no garden can be too
large for a successful ai fresco reception,
it may be also conceded that no garden
can be too small for the;
same purpose, and as a
matter of fact, with a
little care and fore-
thought, the back-gar-
den party may be made
even more popular and
entertaining than the
fetes champetres which
grace the swelling parks
of our nobility.
THE GARDEN.
The garden, however,
should, if possible, be
not less than fifteen
yards by twelve, with a
gravel path round and
a grass plot in the mid-
dle, and the most modish
time to give the party is
late August or early Sep-
tember, immediately fol-;
lowing the rush of the
Southend and Margate
season, and while the
slackening business in'
office or retail establish-
ments gives opportunity
for the presence of the
sterner sex. If the
garden should be slight-
ly smaller than the pre-
scribed area the effect of
size may be greatly en-
hanced by a number of
light chairs and stools
dotted here and there.
The garden seat, which
should be retained for
the use of elderly ladies,
must be freshly painted
for the occasion, though
it is as well not to apply
the last coat later than
the evening before.
The garden roller, if placed on its
side in a shady corner and covered with
a dainty afternoon teacloth, will form
an excellent side-table for glasses and
siphons, but guests must be warned
against sitting on the handle while in
this position.
THE FOUNTAIN.
A graceful and effective little fountain
may be contrived by attaching the rose
of the water-can to the end of the garden
hose, which should be covered by green
baize before being laid across the ground
to the exact centre of the lawn, where
the end must be supported in an up-
right position by ten or a dozen burnt
bricks, the whole forming a charming
rockery or rustic grotto. Guests, how-
ever, must be earnestly requested to lift
their feet high when strolling up and
down the lawn, as a trip over the dis-
guised piping might shift the position
of the nozzle, and lead to disastrous
results.
Mid-Channel .VermaiV*. "OH!

two ounces of cloves, a small teaspoonful
of mace, and a bay leaf. Hock cup made
in this manner can be offered with im-
punity either to teetotalers or moderate
drinkers. The most substantial part of
the entertainment should consist of
savoury sandwiches and thumb-nail
French pastries. It is usual to appor-
tion tiro to each person, three being a
generous'allowance.
THE CAT SHOOT.
In addition to the
Green Hungarian
Gramophone in one
corner and the local
lady reciter in the
other, the Cat Shoot will
be found to be a popular
item among the more
adventurous spirits. Not
more than twelve air-
guns should be invited,
and the game may be
contrived out of card-
board realistically cut
and coloured by the
children a month before-
hand. These dummies,
placed in crouching
positions at intervals
along the back wall or
else a clothes-line, and
worked by a string run-
ning over pulleys with
the boot-boy to mani-
pulate it, should present
n very passable imitation
of the running deer at
Bisley. The garden
seat reserved for the
elderly ladies must be
placed out of range, to
ensure against any mis-
takes arising on the part
of the sportsmen. A
red flag attached to the
chimney will warn the
more intelligent among
the neighbours that
firing is in progress;
all others will gradually
become aware of the
fact from their own
sensations.
REFRESHMENTS.
Forming as they do one of the most
serious items from the visitors' point of
view, the refreshments must receive the
Eersonal attention of every young hostess.
:ed coffee and hock cup will be found
amply to satisfy the demands of the
thirsty. The former you may, with
advantage, make overnight—thus dis-
pensing with the ice; while an economi-
cal and satisfying hock cup should be
made as follows : two quarts of lemonade
(citric acid), one gill of methylated spirit,
A Slump in Teuton Fig.

ing the whole country. 'Open the frontier to

THE RIME OF THE MODERN MARINER.
"' SERVICE ' ?" said the sailor-man; "I have had iny share of it,
Seen it almost everywhere underneath the sun:
'Kept my health'? Well, moderate; thanks to taking care
of it;
More than that yon can't expect, knowing what I 've done.
"Sailormen who celebrate national amenities
Are compelled to undergo sore internal ills;
When we put to sea again afterwards- -ah, then it is
Half the crew are down below, clamouring for pills!
"I was through the Brest affair; young and full of merriment.
Symptoms of dyspepsia hardly made iis wince,
Nor did we anticipate the fruit of that experiment,
Fated to be gathered by the Navy ever since.
"Later on, the Government, proud of its sagacity,
Added to that enterprise others of the sort;
Paying no attention to the sailor-man's capacity,
Bade him overeat himself in every foreign port!
"' Scarcely active service,' eh? Well, reckon to a decimal
What per cent, of combatants met harm in any shape;
Pooh! Their chance of injury was quite infinitesimal;—
Nowadays not one in ten is able to escape.
"Sadly I recall the past; days that cannot be again,
Memories of mariners who followed duty's path,
Totally disabled, they will never put to sea again,
Now they seek the water but at Harrogate or Bath!
"Yes, a gallant calling is the modern sailor's; still it is
Exquisitely dangerous, though war itself may cease;
Honour those who suffer from digestive disabilities,
All incurred in furthering a universal peace!"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Stingaree, by E. W. HORSUXO (CHATTO AND W INDUS), is a
capital collection of stories, arranged on a cleverly devised,
dramatic plan, concerning an Australian bushranger worthy
to be the analogue of Sir WALTER SOOTT'S Locksley alias
Robin Hood, of HARRISON AINSWORTH'S chivalrous Dick Turpin,
or of Bui.WF.R-LnroN's romantic highwayman Paul Clifford.
There is about this Stingaree a dash and a freshness that are
certain to captivate the most jaded reader and likely to send
him, in imagination, galloping recklessly along as sworn
companion of the daring busliranger, determined to see him
through every and any melodramatic adventure, be the result
what it may. The mystery that envelopes the hero is pre-
served admirably. The characters are all dramatically
individualised; so are the horses. The scenes are word-
painted with a graphic fidelity that will charm even the
most persistent skipper, who, in this book will find himself
deprived of his usual exercise. Allow the Baron to direct
the attention of any reader who may lie pressed for time to
an incident in Slingaree's career entitled .1 Duel in the Desert.
Here honest sympathy will be entirely with the lawless
bushranger. But if one is thoroughly to enjoy the stories
they should be read in the connection arranged by their
author. For example the sentiment and the motive of action
in the last story of this volume, The Motli and the Star, can
only be duly appreciated by those whom the first tale,
abruptly finished, has impressed, and to this they will probably
return in order to complete their interest in the "tag" by re-
freshing reference to the opening. Stingaree can be specially
recommended to the traveller with a long journey before him.
The fastidious reader may object to the staring while ktters
at the side of the cover, but, the question of material binding
apart, the book is certainly bound to interest and amuse.
One of the late GUY BOOTHBV'S best books is his last,
entitled A Brigtiton Tragedy (F. V. WHITE & Co.). The first
part—it is divided into three parts—is located in Bogota^
where the attractive heroine is introduced to the reader as
"probably" the "loveliest girl in all Bogota, probably in the
Republic of Colombo," and the puzzlement commences as to
why the novel was entitled .4 Brighton Tragedy, when
apparently all the characters, excepting the English hero,
are Spanish-Americans. Eric Anstruther has nothing to
do with Brighton, no one at "Bogota" (which is not- the
Spanish for Bognor) has anything to do with the acknow-
ledged capital of Sussex seasides. But wait, and your
patience will be mysteriously and sensationally rewarded.
The first part of this novel, however, is picturesquely the
best. Here commences the action, drawn with the three
principal characters without whom no love story can possibly
be concocted, that is to say, the Loved One, the Lover, and the
Rival, the last-named being, in some rare instances, converted
from the error of his way and atoning for his previous
misdeeds by becoming the heroine's most humble servant to
command. It is not so here. The villain is, intentionally,
a villain of the very deepest dye, but the author of his being
has—but this is not the Baron's secret and he will not divulge
it. The scenic descriptions are artistically effective, nor will
anybody grudge the time spent on them, since they are
essential to the right understanding of llie design. To be
brought back, suddenly, from romantic Colombo to matter-
of-fact Brighton takes away the reader's breath; nor, indeed,
for some time, does the writer himself appear to have
recovered from the violent shock to his system. II: the
reader, deeply interested in the sensational course of
events, be a Dickensian student, it was injudicious of Oi:v
BOOTHBY to suggest to him the idea of a Miss PipcMn or a
Cornelia Blimber (both of Brighton schools) in the persons of
Miss Pinnifer and Miss Tibbits; and if the reader be not
Dickensian, then the sudden introduction of two low-comedy
characters into the serious business in hand may possibly
irritate and put him out of harmony with the otherwise well-
considered scheme. But again the Barpn begs him to have
patience. These two persons soon "cease their funning"
and drop into their proper places. Perhaps if, instead of
being called A Brighton Tragedy, the book had been entitled
From Bogotd to Brighton: a Tragedy, then the reader would
have been fairly dealt with. But when he is at Bogota he
doesn't want to leave it for Brighton, and, when he gets to
Brighton, he is most anxious to return to Bogota.
THK
BABON
The Mother-Light (HUTCHINSON) is a remarkable book. The
author—or my Baronite guesses the authoress — remains
anonymous. The scene is laid in the United States, where
such words as "labor" come from. The story- deals with
a carefully organised religious imposture, those who pull the
string claiming for the High Priestess the gift of healing the
sick, even of triumphing over death. From time to time the
Mother-Light shows herself to the believers assembled in
their thousands. Actually 93
in years, she is made up to pre-
serve the bloom and beauty of
youth. But death is not to be
defrauded, even by the Mother-
Light. He carries off the old hag,
whom the First Apostle secretly
buries in the dead of night, sub-
stituting for her a young and
beautiful girl, who successfully
carries on the imposture. The
developments of this strange
story are presented with force
and picturesqueness.

TWO-AND-TWO MAKE FOUR CASTS.
(H'iffc aektuncltdgnrnl* to the recent exploitx of
,Sr Gilbert'Parker, M.P., in Ihr field of
political ralicinationj
SIR NORMAN LOCKYER, interviewed on
his return from Palma, where lie hftd
been keeping the eclipse of the Sun
under the severest surveillance, pre-
dicted that no other total eclipse of the
Sun: would occur until 19l'7. In the
meantime, watchers of the skies might
occasionally be gladdened by the appa-
rition of meteors and oilier minor, but
not unpleasing, celestial phenomena.
It was a good thing not to have an
eclipse of the Sun tcx> often, as constant
repetition would be likely to depreciate
the value of such an event, and turn day
into night too frequently.
Mr. H. A. JOKES, interviewed on the
eve of his departure for America to
produce a new play, predicted that Sir
HENRY IHVINU would still be at the head
of the English stage next year, even
although he should retire from active
work. He freely admitted that better
plays had been written than were now
being produced, but a belter time was
coming. He thought it a very good
thing that the music halls had short
plays, as it took the mind for a few
minutes from the banalities of the comic
singer and fostered a love for the
theatre.
He anticipated that Mr. PINERO and
Mr. G. B. SIIAW would never write a
play together, but. he had every con-
fidenc'e in Mr. G. R. SIMS again finding
a collaborator.
Mr. C. K. SHORTER, interviewed on
the eve of his departure for Naishapur
in connexion with a special Omar Khay-
yam supplement of the Woorfbridge
Flageolet (with which is incorporated
the Sphere), predicted confidently that
the new novel Carniaila, by Mr. THEO.
WATTS-DUNTON, poet, critic and dedicatee,
would be reviewed in all the principal
papers. It was not, as some foolish
person had assumed from a hasty glance
at the title, anti-vegetarian in trend.
On the contrary Mr. WJOTB-DOHTOH was
a strong believer in a simple diet of
lentils and split pease at any price.
Rumours to the effect that GIPSY SMITH
was the heroof Carn'wla were unfounded,
but the bcx)k had a strong Romany
interest, and a special edition for caravan
consumption was in preparation.
Turning to other matters, the modern
CATO remarked that he anticipated »
great future for several authors, but
would prefer not to name them just yet.
There was no doubt that Mr. GEORGE
MEREDITH, O.M., would remain at the
head of the literary profession.

viewed on the eve of his departure with

Pacific, predicted that next season would
see some very interesting games. The
county championship, he said, would
probably be won by eilher Yorkshire or
Lancashire, Surrey or Sussex, Kent, or
Essex, or possibly by another team.
Sussex, he freely admitted, would be
stronger with Mr. C. B. FRY than with-
out him. He thought it a very good
thing that Mr. FRY should be beaten by
the bowling now and then, as it was not
in the interests of cricket that one man
should stay in for ever.
Mr. BRODRICK, who was intercepted
by an interviewer on his return to
Peper Harow after a Primrose
League meeting at Guildford, observed
that the role of prophet carried with
it serious responsibilities. But with-
out indiscretion he might, safely pre-
dict that Lord CI'RZON on his return
to England would not resume the Vice-
royalty of India as long as Lord MINTO
retained that important post. Mounting
a- three-legged stool, and assuming a
distinctly Delphic attitude, Mr. BROPRICK
then chanted the following oracle:--
If I stand for Guildford again and win,
The Liberal candidate won't get in;
If I stand again, and suffer defeat,
The Literal Party will win the seat.

THE PERSONAL NOTE.
[The 30th of August was rendered remarkable by the announcement,
in the morning japcrs, of the success of the Peace Conference and of
the ratification of the new treaty of alliance between England and
Japan; by a partial, and altogether invisible, eclipse of the sun;
and by a temperature worthy of the latter end of October.]
TO-DAY is wrought of right historic stuff.
The Heaven on high, the Earth that spins below it,
Teem with phenomena sublime enough
To be the making of a minor poet.
Never, I fancy, has the Mail divulged
News that could so electrify the nations;
Xever, in my belief, so largely bulged
With swelling pride of proved anticipations.
The Stm, eclipsed behind the usual cloud
(So faith must e'en dispense with sight, and chance it),
Further assumes a temporary shroud
Caused by the Moon's obtrusive bulk in transit.
Not so its counterfeit, the Rising Sun,
That uneclipsed incarnadines the banners
Of those who taught the world how wars are won,
And set the mode to-day in civil manners.
One hand the Victor stretches out to show
How to his pledged ally he grows more partial;
With one (politely waved) he lets the foe
Secure a first success--not strictly martial.
Magnanimous in council as in fight,
He renders half the spoil and all the ransom,
And, for a Pagan, struggling toward the light,
His conduct strikes me as extremely handsome.
Peace is accomplished !" TEDDY" (his the fame)
Feels in his breast a not unnatural joy stir;
And through the azure Bay which bears its name
A strange elation chokes the astonied Oyster.
You 'd think there could not breathe, in human form,
One creature so abominably selfish
Whose heart this hour is not at least as warm
As the interior of a torpid shell-fish;
Yet such am I. A chill invades my chest,
For, on this so-called summer day of August,
Rude Boreas, whistling through my airy vest,
Worries my vitals with his beastly raw gust.
Belfries may rock about with ringing bells,
And glad historians paint the peoples' annals
Purple, or pink; my fancy rather dwells
On the immediate use of ja'ger flannels.
Let others order olive-twigs to-day
To mark the close of yonder deadly duel;—
Give vie a pinewood log; give me, I say,
Something of service in the way of fuel!
With song and laughter let the City peal,
And bounding Bulls wear fillets on their forehead ;•-
I nm no friend of Russia, yet I feel
More like a Bear afflicted with a sore head.
Nay, gentle jobber, bid me not to sing;
I have no heart to be a gaudy hummer;

Mourning the premature demise of summer! 0. S.
A PROFESSIONAL MATINEE.
Tiff, troupe of mimes and singers that a certain eccentric
Prince always maintained at his Court was one morning
rehearsing on the lawn in front of the Palace. Near the
centre stood the prima donna, arrayed in the garb of old
Greece, and around her at a little distance circled the chorus,
picturesquely broken up into groups of charming figures.
The musicians had ranged themselves against the retaining
wall of the terrace above; upon the balustrade whereof, with
his legs dangling over the instruments of music, sat the Chief
of the Jesters, who in virtue of his office was not only a great
antiquarian and philosopher, but also the skilled director of
all state entertainments.
They had come to the crucial passage in the work before
them. Softer and slower grew the song of the prima donna,
and lower and lower she bent, until at length she sang upon
her knees; and finally, as the last sobs of the accompanying
violins died away, she fell prone upon the grass and buried
her face in a pair of extremely shapely arms. The chorus
gathered round, terror-stricken; there was silence for a few
bars, broken only by the Chief of the Jesters counting the
time. Then a timid note or two escaped from the flutes, like
the first twittering of birds at daybreak; presently the young
lady on the ground slowly recovered and began to rub her
eyes, and the stringed instruments meanwhile slipped
pleasantly into the prelude that was to lead up to the final
harmonious outburst. What it all meant is, fortunately, not
material to this present history.
The prima donna was coming round gracefully, and both
the eyes and the ears of the Chief of the Jesters were fully
occupied with his task of superintendence, when somebody
clapped him on the shoulder from behind so unexpectedly
that he let the prompt-book fall with a crash on the top of
the orchestra. The music came to a ragged finish. The
chorus, just starting their joyous finale, gradually —to use
their own figurative language—dried up; and the prima
donna, who had been acting very well, and knew it, rose
from the grass and petulantly dusted her purple chiton.
"You are all wasting your time, my friends," said the
Princ3; for it was he whose sudden appearance had thrown
everybody at sixes and sevens.
The Chief of the Jesters slewed his legs round, and
alighted on the terrace with such ceremony as he could
muster. Courtier as he was, he had difficulty in concealing
his annoyance.
"We are spending our time, as ever, iu your Highness's
service," he said gravely.
The Prince, who knew how to make allowance for the
touchiness of the artistic temperament, graciously ignored
the insinuation.
"I have come to the conclusion," he continued—and the
Prince's conclusions had the force of law in that country
as soon as he arrived at them—" I have come to the con-
clusion that art is a mistake. Nay, more, it is an imperti-
nence. As 1 walked abroad at dawn this morning, the
grand concert of Nature, at which I assisted in solitude,
touched me with emotions such as you are powerless to
inspire. By the side of her harmony I felt how contemptible
are your cunning patterns of sound, your studied poses,
your whole armoury of artifice. As artists, I have decided
to abolish you. You will come along with me, the whole
pack of you, and learn from Nature to despair."
There was nothing for it but to obey, at all events, the first
part of this command. The Prince led the way to a beautiful
dell, not half a mile off, known as the Valley by the Sea, which,
although within the Palace demesne, had been left wild, in
delightful contrast to the carefully tended gardens where the
rehearsal had taken place; and making the company sit down
on the slopes thereof, like an audience sitting round an

amphitheatre, he bade them attend to the grand concert of
Nature, which he assured them was still going on there.
"The lighting," added the Prince, condescending to a
technical expression, " is not 'so perfectly lovely now as when
I was here at daybreak; but you must imagine all that."
The Chief of the Jesters raised his eyebrows slightly and
coughed, but he said nothing.
The grand concert of Nature was soothing, and even
soporific. Each little wave of the summer ^sea, as it played
over the shingle on the beach below, sent up a sound like a
long-drawn sigh of infinite happiness; as an accompaniment
to this rhythmic lullaby there was the sustained, noon-tide
drone of multitudinous insects underneath the trees; and
many and various birds performed sweet but uncorrelated
fantasias amongst the branches.
"How long is this farce going on?" whispered the prima-
donna to the Chief of the Jesters, when they had been sitting
thus about the space of two hours.
"Your classification, my dear, of the different forms of
dramatic entertainment "began the philosopher, but the
lady pinched his arm so viciously that his sarcasm subsided
into a most unphilosophical exclamation.
"Mere impatience," he apologised to the Prince, who had
turned round angrily. "Nature develops her theme but
slowly j methinks."
"There will be a change of key about nightfall," said his
Highness.
The company looked at one another with blank faces, and
the prima donna, laying her head against the shoulder of
the Chief of the Jesters, shamelessly went to sleep.
But Nature herself, after all, came to their rescue. It grew
dark and still; her orchestra, as the Prince would have said,
was performing one of those piano passages that presage a
coming storm. And when the thunder-clouds burst and the
rain fell in torrents, though lie pretended to be enraptured
with the sound of both, the Prince could not but be moved to
pity by the frightened faces and the drenched draperies of the
chorus girls, and with a show of reluctance he gave the signal
to return to the Palace.
"A tine work," observed the Chief of the Jesters to the
Prince as they walked home, dripping, "but it wants a lot of
cutting. By the way, has it ever struck your Highness that
there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon?
I should have thought that the Moon might probably have
struck your Highness. I speak metaphorically, of course."

west, " I restore you your reflected glories."

THE PERILS OF THE ROAD.
(.4 Modern Story of Adventure.)
THE two motorists were men who had
travelled much, and in strange places.
They had the unassuming manners of
those who have encountered dangers in
many different forms. Yet SPARKER'S
hand shook on the steering wheel, and
GEARY'S usual quiet smile had deserted
his lips. Their nervousness will be
understood when it is mentioned that
they were crossing one of the loneliest
moors in Northumberland, a locality
where, as late as the twentieth century,
wolves roamed at large, and highway-
men robbed His Majesty's mail.
Nor can it be said that the car—a
new 12 h.p. Debacle —was acting up to
the reputation which the local agent had
given it. Down hill, indeed, it moved
splendidly, but the slightest ascent
semed at once to cool its enthusiasm
and to heat its engines. Just now it
was toiling painfully up a long hill, and
protesting uneasily against SPARKER'S
efforts "to make her," as he phrased it,
"take it on the second." "First," she
seemed to whirr in reply, "is good
enough for me."
Suddenly GEARY gripped his com-
rade's arm. "Hark, what was that?"
he said. "Listen, man, listen."
"I suppose it's something in the car,"
SPARKEH replied, wearily. "She's made
so many queer noises to-night that one
mor3 don't signify."
"It isn't t'.ie car this time," replied
the other.
The sound was repeated. It was a
s >und unmistakable to those who have
ever read books of adventure; it was
the long-drawn howl of a wolf.
Twelve horses would have been
spurred by terror to a quicker pace.
The twelve which the Debacle was
advertised to represent continued es-
asperatingly calm; the car only moaned
as SPARKER, for the fifth time, ground in
the second gear, and in a few yards she
showed every sign of stopping altogether.
The situation was a desperate one; the
crest of the hill, by an illusion common
under such circumstances, seemed to
recede further and further away. The
ho vlings grew nearer and nearer.
Presently it was possible to distinguish
through the darkness the grey gaunt
forms of the wolves. On they came,
with their noses to the ground, following,
witli what was evidently a pleasant
uncertainty, the novel scent of the petrol.
The lender of the pack, especially gaunt
and grey, cantered doggedly some few
yards ahead of the rest. His gleaming
fangs and protruded tongue could, as
is customary under such circumstances,
Ix? clearly seen.
"This is worse than any police trap,"
muttered GEARY, as he glanced behind.
"I wonder if they are merely taking our
number."
"I don't think they can say we are
exceeding the limit," was SPARKER'S
bitter reply.
A fortunate occurrence gave the
pursued a temporary advantage. Some
of the wolves, who could now sight
their quarry, were evidently a little
• surprised to discover the kind of vehicle
they were pursuing. It was not a sleigh,
or at least not a sleigh like any they had
ever seen. And at this juncture a series
of deafening explosions in the exhaust,
due probably to one of the cylinders
missing, added to their astonishment.
They seemed to suspect firearms, a very
i pardonable misconception on their part,
and the car gained at least twenty yards.
Then the wolves took up the trail again.
"Let's try the horn," suggested
SPARKER, who was full of resource, and
he blew some resonant blasts upon it.
"That ought to puzzle them."
This expedient had only a momentary
success. The wolves hesitated, and then
apparently assigned this new sound to
some animal \vho was drawing the car.
They followed with renewed ardour,
licking their lips greedily.
"What is generally done now," said
SPAJIKER, " is, if I remember right, to cut
adrift and sacrifice one of the horses."
"Then," said GEARY, "we must try
them with our spare outer cover. Luckily
it is only a re-vulcanised one."
He turned, and leaning over into the
tonnea.li, dragged out the huge india-
rubber tyre in question. Then standing
up, he flung it with a shout to the pack
of wolves. They struggled with snap-
pings and yelpings for 'this delicacy,
and in a few seconds it was completely
devoured. But the device had gained
time; and, more than that, it, had an un-
looked-for effect upon the wolves them-
selves. There were growls which sounded
like disappointment, while in the manner
of those who had enjoyed more than
their fair share of the repast some dis-
comfort might be detected, as well as a
distinct loss of enthusiasm. They seemed
to be holding an informal discussion
together, and the pursuit slackened.
"Is there anything else we can sacri-
fice?" asked SPARKER, as he coaxed the
reluctant Debacle up the hill.
"Only a Parsons chain," GEARY
answered gloomily, "and they are
scarcely likely to relish that. Still we
are very near the top, and that tyre
seems to have taken the edge off their
appetites."
It was as he said. The wolves, appa-
rently concluding that the article just
consumed might be taken as a sample
of the eatables which the enterprise had
to offer, had stopped altogether and
were now almost out of sight. Hope
rose in the hearts of the travellers, when
suddenly a new and scarcely less alarm-
ing development occurred. In the
middle of the road appeared, barring
their advance, a masked man who leaped
lightly from a three-speed bicycle.
"Gentlemen," he cried with a cour-
teous sweep of his hard black hat, "I
must ask you to stand and deliver."
At the same time he covered the travel-
lers with a revolver.
SPARKER was as usual equal to the
emergency. He pressed the footbrake.
and slowed the car down. "We are
unarmed," he replied quietly, "and can
make no resistance. If you go round
to the back of the car you will find a
| petrol tin full of gold in the tonnc.au.
Help yourself and don't mind us."
The highwayman, who seemed to be
of a somewhat confiding disposition,
uttered a brief expression of thanks for
the information, and passed in the. direc-
tion indicated. He could be heard
groping about busily at the back of the
car.
"There is no gold here," he cried at
length. "I trust you are not playing
me false, gentlemen." And he tapped
his weapon significantly.
GEARY was about to make some reply,
when SPARKER checked him with a
sudden thrust of the elbow. "What!
No gold there !" he said with an excellent
assumption of surprise. "Are you certain?
Then," and he sighed, " it is as I feared.
The tin has been bumped out by the
jolting of the car. We must certainly
turn back and look for it in the road.
I thought I heard something behind us,
didn't you, GEARY?"
"Indeed I did," GEARY corroborated
earnestly.
"Do you care to accompany us in our
search?" inquired SPARKER of the
brigand.
The man laughed cunningly. "I
will spare you any trouble in the matter,"
he said. "It shall lie with me to remedy
your carelessness. Now you shall give
me your word of honour as gentlemen,
to wait here, while I ride back along the
road. As soon as you hear me shout
you may continue your journey. Have
I your promise? I know that your
promise will be of more avail than any
threats."
SPARKER lighted a cigarette. "You
have our promise," he said as he blew
out the match. "As soon as we hear
you shout," he repeated with delibera-
tion.
The highwayman pedalled into the
darkness, whistling a popular tune,
while the motorists awaited the issue
with interest. In a few moments there
were sounds of frenzied firing, followed
by an unmistakable shout. As he
heard it SPARKER let in the clutch with a
deep sigh of relief. "Now we can be

"Tuck the rug round you, GEARY. She
seems to he pulling better."
As they dropped down the hill GEARY
meditated silently. "I'm afraid," he
said, " our friend will be a little dis-
appointed; though," he added more
cheerfully, "the wolves will be pleased."
"And anyhow," replied SPARKER, who
added the study of philosophy to his
other attainments, "the greatest happi-
ness of the greatest number is secured."

The competition for a prize of one

mirable results. The Examiners have
received at least forty-nine versions of
the highest quality, any one of which
might well have been awarded a prize. ,
The difficulty of deciding between these

NATURE STUDIES.
THE SWAN.
To be born a swan and to live on the Thames would appear
to be a consummation of all hopes and ambitions that a
vagrant piece of vital essence may be supposed to have
cherished in its pre-natal state. Is there any other being
that exemplifies to the same degree the perfection of graceful
beauty and the high-water mark of elegant sleekness and
indolent scorn? Who would not care to be admired for his
shape and respected for his air? There may be drawbacks.
I have dined with the Worshipful Company of Vintners—
may the Fates grant them a permanence of prosperity and a
constant succession of convivial feasts !—and I remember that
swan (or it may have been cygnet) formed an item in the
menu. From this I inferred that one of my Thames friends
had met with a violent death; but the incident is, I doubt
not, exceptional. I have also seen a swan on land, and I
own tluit his beauty suffered an earth-change greatly to his
disadvantage. He was an absurd and overweighted waddler
instead of a graceful glider, but it was stress of food in the
winter time that had driven him on to the lawn on which 1
saw him monstrously parading, and, on this plea, he may
be excused. As a rule, however, he is, as I have said,
beautiful; and he lives easily on the weeds that he finds for
himself in the river and on the bread and cake and biscuits
supplied to him by picnic parties or the juvenile families of
riparian proprietors.
The swan I know best is the jealous father and guardian
of a little fleet of five cygnets, whom, with their mother, he
convoys up and down one of the reaches of the Thames. A
little higher up the river there may be found another pair of
swans, whose family numbers only two, and between these
two families or fleets exists a state of hideous enmity which
not even President ROOSEVELT could avail to mitigate. When-
ever the two males set eyes on one another, even at a distance
of several hundred yards, the trouble incontinently begins.
Up go the wings of my swan like two battle standards, he
curves his neck into a Icxip, lays his fierce bill upon his
breast, and with furious strokes forces himself through the
agitated water. The enemy has gone through a similar
pantomime, and so they speed against one another. My
heart beats; all my being is in suspense for the crash of the
conflict. Yet (I confess it with regret) I have never seen
battle actually joined. When they arrive within striking;
distance each lays his head away from the other and directs
his course at a tangent that sets them apart. Then they i
wheel round and again and again repeat the futile demon- •.
stration, their wives meanwhile paddling about at a discreet
distance with their piteous and piping offspring. But woe
lietide the family that happens for a time to be without its
male protector! The foe seizes his opportunity. With
incredible speed and violence, appearing suddenly, as from a
trap-door in the Thames, he dashes in amongst the children
of his absent rival, plunges upon them, seizes them 1 y the
neck, and treads ^them deep under the water, whence they
emerge, bleating and terror-stricken, a long distance away.
There is, indeed, about swans an unappeasable fierceness
which is strange in a bird so graceful and so white. Every
morning my swan brings his wife and his dark-grty, fluffy
brood to the edge of my raft, and every day the children
give him tribute of bread. The little ones accept it with
meekness, the parents with hissing and hatred. No courtesies
can mollify them. They swallow the crumbs eagerly, but if
a chubby and incautious foot strays too near the edge of the
raft it is dabbed and bruised by a prompt stroke from the
bill of the passionate and greedy bird. Not even the vene-
rable age and complete deafness of the spaniel liave availed
to save him from attack. Only yesterday he was drinking
witli his head hung over the edge of the raft when he received
a rap that sent him flying in an astonished confusion to the
land. The.anger of the swan and the terror of the spaniel
made the most diverting contrast I have witnessed for many
a long day; and when the swan sailed off to rejoin his
family he had in his air an added scorn for all four-legged
creatures as well as for those who, owning two legs, possessed
no feathers and very short necks.
AN IDYLL OF THE CRICKET FIELD.
So all a summer's day the village green
Of Astolat-cum-Thurnaby was loud
With rainbow-blaze of blazers, and the cries
Of them that bowled the ball, and them that smote,
And them that chased it to the bounds of space,
Like errant knights that follow, follow the Gleam;
And swish of wielded willow winnowing air,
And thwack of leaping leather dealing doom,
And quick death-ruckle of the stricken stumps,
As Astolat and Cumnor, man by man,
Shin-guarded, rubber-knuckled, spikelet-shod,
Strode to the wicket, slogged, and, slogging, past.
And now, for now the languorous afternoon
Swooned in the arms of evening, and the sun
Sloped slowly home, the issue of the day
Hung in the balance and the balance swayed.
For EDWIN ALI.EN, coachman at the.HaU,
Who drove a pair of greys for General JONES,
But could not drive a cricket-ball for nuts,
The last man in (they wanted one to tie,
And two to win), he over-keen to win,
Had skied Sir LANCELOT of the Moated Grange,""
Swift-swiping as he caught him on the hop.
Then, for a voice shrilled "Yours" across theTield,
I, standing lost in dreams at cover-point—
For often would I lose myself in dreams,
A shadow in a world of shadows, fain
To gather wool upon the hills of sleep—
Dreams of fair women, fairer than the t'ay,'
Sweet ALICE of the Mill, SEMIIU.VIS,
And CLEOPATRA, and a baker's dozen
Of early loves, with downward-dropping eyes,
Who came into the garden after dark
What time the old grey owl said "Woo, to woo,"
And the horse-chestnut cleared his throat and sang
"0 Moon!"—but there I woke, and, waking, swept
The heavens above me with an eye as blue,
And marked, or thought 1 marked, perhaps I marked,
Or partly marked, the orbit of the sphere,
And gauged the angle of its incidence,
And waved wild hands, and opened wide my mouth,
And stood as one that supplicates the gods.
And, even as thus I stood, from crease to crease,
Fleet-footed as the dawn upon the hills,
Sprinting, the batsmen ran, and counted " One,"
Nor paused to count, since one and one make two.
But all the daisy-dappled sward was sown
With gnzers, for a thousand faces watched,
Eager, intent, two thousand eyes save one —
Two eyes a face, but one had lost an eye,
A grey-haired thrall who vended almond-rock
And gold-peeled sourness of the sunny South,
The battered ruin of a strenuous youth;
For once he gazed, and once too often gazed,
Orb upon orb, a penny for the peep,
Athwart a monstrous lens that magnified
The spots upon the sun, which none may see
Or, seeing, see but veiled; till Nature, wroth
To have her privy blemishes displayed
To gaping yokels at a country fair,

Shrieked, and saw red, and ramped; the high sun flamed
With sudden heat, and, arrowing through the tube
His gathered rays, cancelled a sense misused.
And that which sprang into the boundless blue
Turned again earthward, and, as when a hawk
Stoops, and the void is full of fear, so fear
And hope made silence, and the ball fell on.
And every breath was held in solemn pause,
And every heart stopped beating in suspense,
Nor pulsed the rhythmic pulse of human life,
The systole-diastole of Time and Fate,
Whereto the star-dust dances, and the worlds
Whirl; and the scorer's pencil hung in air.
Not so it hung, the ball, but fell and fell
And fell; I clutched and caught it—on my top.
As breaks the sudden ice-piled barrier-gate
When Spring unchains the Yukon, and the ice
Breaks with a roar, and leaps to meet the sea,
So brake the dam of execration, so
Leapt the loud laughter from a thousand throats;
And immemorial elms that fenced the field
Hung forth a rout of rooks, that, shrieking, fled
From nests that rocked and toppled at the cry
Of " Butterfingers" pealing to the stars.

SEASONABLE QUESTIONS.
IN case the supply of silly season posers is giving out, Mi:
Punch offers the following selection to enterprising editors:—
Are women sufficiently manly?
Ought mixed-dining to be allowed?
Do babies like walnuts?
Ought the Sea-Serpent to wear a sun-bonnet?
Are cricketers agnostics?
Ought engagements to be made public?
Are we growing stouter?
Do women appreciate kindness?
Should life be allowed?
Ought the sun to be eclipsed?
Is music musical?
IN the Isle of Man Daily Times of August 25, under
the heading "FIXTURES OF MANX EVENTS," appeared the
following announcement: — " August 30. Eclipse of the
Sun." It sounds rather like a local performance of one of
Mr. HAIJ. CAINE'S masterpieces.
FROM a Lakeside newspaper :—
". . . . the shores of the local lakes teem with the residences of
many of the principal peop'.e of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and though
the actual rateable value of the estates may not be startling, the gross
personality (wo) of the reoplc who live there would go a long way to
wijiing off the National Debt."

jiit-t, won a first prize in the local fur and
feather show. The bird was in good feather,
and bore its weight of vears well."- -Evening

TEACBEB9 were wont, until a recent date,
To bid their youthful charges emulate
The habits—if they really wished to
thrive—
Of the industrious workers of the hive, j A creature of less disputable views.
His voice—no matter what he feels or
does—
Is limited to one eternal buzz.
He can't eliminate his unemployed;
He takes to suicide when he 's annoyed;
His polity reveals one vital flaw —
He's governed by an anti-Salic law.
Hence, if the rising human generation
Must imitate the animal creation,
Let us at least for our ensample choose
('Twas Doctor WATTS, most people will
agree,
Who started out to boom the busy bee;
Lord AvF.nrRY cracked him up in recent
days,
And MAETKIILIXCK waxed lyric in his
praise.)
And yet the be?, to whom a copious crowd
Of sages have consistently kow-towed,
Though his good qualities can't be
denied,
Is not in ev'ry sphere the safest guide.
He in industrious, that we freely grant;
But if it comes to that, so is the ant,
The beaver, and that unobtrusive soul,
The real harbinger of tubes the mole.
His style of architecture freedom lacks;
He uses only one material—wax;
I, for my part, shall never cease to shove
The claims to admiration of the dove,
Who with a gentle and engaging mien
Combines an intellect alert and keen.
To prove his studious habits, only go
And view our great Museum portico:
Or, if you doubt his love of legal talk,
Just note how he infests the King's
Bench Walk.
The dove, moreover, in our hour of need
Will fetch and carry for us at a speed
Unchecked by constables, and passing far
The paltry limit of the motor-car.
The dove again, whether upon the wing
Or off it, never lias been known to sting.
His voice is soft, his habits are not
flighty,
Although he was beloved by APHRODITE.
The span of life in bees is very brief,
They quickly fall into the yellow leaf;
But doves, the Press assures me, can
contrive
To keep their beauty up to forty-five.
Living, they typify domestic bliss,
And afterwards excel the bee in this.
That when the hour has struck for them
to die
They make a highly palatable pie.
On
thev
all these grounds, and surely
are lots,
I can't endorse the eulogies of WATTS,
Or of Lord AVF.BURV, nor do I think
I am obliged to vote for MAETERLINCK.
Before the bee I gladly doff my cap;
He is a sober and hardworking chap;
But when it comes to friendship or to
love,
I plump emphatically for the dove.

Kyle* of Bute; B.Y.S. "Capercmbne?
Monday. - Steaming up the Kvles of
Bute CUM upon a wei.nl spectacle. Never
,1 fairer August day shone o'er laud and
sea. Light clouds floated lazily over
the hills on either side, momentarily
changing patches of brilliant green into
solemn shade. A sea-gull flew across,
its white wings glinting like a fleck of
snow against the shadowed hill; beyond
the heather, patches of purple; "the
blue sky over all like (iod's great pily."
Far ahead loomed what looked like a
spectral fleet. Battleships evidently. As
the ('npercaihic, undaunted, flew nearer,
caught sight, of the fighting tops, gun-
less, unmanned. Nearer still, and there
were the big guns frowning defiance.
But no sentry at his post, no blue-
jackets moving about, no epanletted
officers on the bridge. Six battleships
in all, anchored in line. Like "the
party in the parlour, all silent and all" Well, to put it literally, con-
demned.
Our Admiral, fellow-passenger on the
yacht, told us all alxmt it. He had per-
sonal acquaintance with most of these
grimly-grey ghosts of naval power.
They formed a squadron of that con-
siderable proportion of the British Fleet
which, their inefficiency being clear to
JACK FISHER'S piercing eye, were written
oil the Navy List by his relentless hand.
Two years ago, at furthest, they were in
commission, nominally a portion of the
Fleet that, according to PRINCE Aimint,
makes Cumbrae and the adjacent islands
of Great Britain and Ireland invulnera-
ble to invasion. To-day they lie in the
peaceful obscurity of a Scotch Loch.
"Their part in all the pomp that fills
The circuit of the summer hills
Is that their—"
work is done. As we slowly steam past,
the Admiral tells us their names and
something of their history. Here are the
Cdttingtcood and the Co/o««us, built in
1882; each of 10,000 tons; cost between
them something over a million sterling:
already out of date; going at the price
of scrap iron.
Here is the Dreadnought, an elder
sister, built in 1875. A year earlier
the Captain turned turtle at sea, carry-
ing her hapless crew to the depths
below. It was felt that something
supreme, decisive, must be done to re-
establish supremacy of British Navy.
Committee of experts appointed, under
presidency of Lord Di FTEHIN. Result
was the Dreadnought, 10,820 tonnage,
(i,.r>lX) hone-power, warranted to exceed
a speed of 13 knots. This grimy-looking
hulk, with its top-masts gone, its port-
holes toothless gums, is what is left of
the Dreadnought, just thirty years ago
pride of the ocean, bulwark of British
Astern of her is another battleship
whose name recalls a later tragedy in
navy annals. It is the Kan* Pareil,
first-class battleship, built in 1887 on
the very lines of the \'ictorid, which
only a few years ago sank with Admiral
TnvoN and nearly all his officers and
crew aboard.
Ahead the Iron Duke, with portholes
for 14 guns, has her story to tell. Built
in 1872 she, three years later, in the
friskiuess of youth, steering out of
Dublin Bay, ran into (lie Vangtitird and
successfully sank her. For full thirty
years the Vanguard has slept in the
silence of the Irish Channel. Here at
length her assailant and destroyer, in
the decrepitude of age, conies to final
anchorage in the Kyles of Bute.
By exception the Alexandra, needy
knife-grinder of the squadron, has no
story to tell—at least none of disaster to
herself or sisters. She was Admiral
HORNBY'S flag-ship in the Mediterranean
during the exciting time when DIZZY,
being Premier, pursued a spirited foreign
policy. It was about the time (.1877)
when the House of Commons was startled

by message reaching the Treasury Bench
that the Russians were at the gates of
Constantinople. It came from Sir HENRY
LAYARD, Ambassador at the Porte, and
before the agitated sitting closed was
proved to be baseless.
In pursuance of spirited foreign
policy the Alexandra was ordered to
pass through the Dardanelles. As she
was getting up steam for the expedition
a Turkish Pacha arrived with a protest.
By solemn treaty the Dardanelles were
closed against all but Turkish ships.
"You protest?" said the Admiral.
"Very sorry, but you see my orders are
to proceed to Constantinople. The only
way there is through the Dardanelles, so
I am going on."
But the Alexandra will go no more
a-sailing in the Dardanelles or elsewhere.
Here she lies at anchor, part of a funeral
procession of battleships temporarily
halted on the way to the scrap heap.

"... read in some old marvellous tale,
Some ieeend strange and vague,
That a midnight host of spectres pale

That was fancy. Here be facts not less

peacefully at anchor amid the quietness
and beauty of the Kyles of Bute.
A COMPLAINT OF KIND ENQUIRIES.
SUMMER is pretty near over,
Watering-places are thronged,
Trippers are living in clover,
1 alone feel myself wronged.
Painfully feel my position,
Daily and hourly beset,
Questioned with vain repetition,—
." Been for your holiday yet?"
Don't talk to me about trouble,
Luggage that wanders astray,
Rooms with their rents screwed to
double,
Children that cry all the day,
Skies everlastingly clouded,
Trains that eternally crawl,
Sea-fronts impossibly crowded—
I could put up with them all!
I could put up with the niggers,
I could put up -with, the noise,
Bathers, and paddlers, and diggers,
Donkeys and similar joys;
What do such little things matter?
Let me but get out of town,
Coming back several pounds fatter,
Burnt a mahogany-brown!
No, I am tied to the City,
Tied to my wearisome task.
Yet from the stores of your pity
One little favour I ask;
Meekly I make the suggestion:
When in the street we have met,
Don't ask the imbecile question,
"Been for your holiday yet?"

Pence." We are afraid that our corre-
spondent, for whose poetical idea we
have the greatest admiration, forgets
that the PRESIDENT wears pince-nez.
The Nome Yremija deplores the con-
clusion of peace "now that the Russian
army has become stronger than ever."
It is an undoubted fact that the Russian
army is always stronger in peace.
The KAISER is irrepressible. He has
now designed a set of altar ornaments
for the German Protestant Church in
London.- We trust that they will be in
better taste than his designs in Morocco.
The crowds who follow the KINO at
Marienbad whenever he goes for a stroll
continue to cause great inconvenience,
and a proposal has been made that these
admirers shall lie compelled, anyhow, to
walk in single file.
The directors of the Louvre are being
urged to get rid of the many spurious
works of art which have found their way
into the galleries. It is pointed out that
the clearance need not mean a financial
loss to the institution, as such objects
could easily be sold to wealthy Americans.
It now appears that the eclipse of the
sun last week was due to the appearance
of the Blue Moon at the Lyric, accom-
panied by a number of brilliant stars.
During the eclipse a number of the
natives of Sfax banged violently on
various utensils, and ultimately suc-
ceeded in scaring it away. By this
prompt action an end was put to what
was threatening to become a nuisance.
According to the Dot/// Telegraph, an
epidemicof baldness has evidently broken
out at Lowestoft. "Many ladies," says
our contemporary, "have adopted the
fashion of wearing lace scarves instead
of hats, but many more wear no head-
covering at all." The Simple Life again.
The Lansdowne Council School was
struck last week by a ball of fire, but
the Government intends to stick to the
Education Bill.
Objection has been taken by a Con-
servative agent against the votes of
passive resisters whose poor rates weie
paid "unknown to them," on the ground
that they .themselves paid no rates. This
will press hardly on such as paid their
own rates anonymously.
A remarkable instance of rejuvenation
is reported. Now that the statement of
JOHN VAUGHAN to the effect that he was a
bugler at the battle of Waterloo has been
proved to be a fabrication, the old gentle-
man has frankly acknowledged that he
will not be a centenarian any longer.
We quite agree with the Magistrates
who hold that there are too many assaults
on the police, but we must say that the
constables sometimes provoke such treat-
ment. Last week, for instance, it trans-
pired, in a charge brought against a man
for this offence, that he was privately
engaged in beating his wife when the
constable interfered.
Crowds watched KVBELIK take a bath
in the sea at Morecambe last week, hut
other foreign musicians deny that the
famous violinist is an innovator.
Truth is of the opinion that the dis-
favour into which sea-bathing has fallen
is due to the increased size of the feet of
what are known as "open-air girls."
We believe it is an indisputable fact that
when the members of a certain ladies'
hockey club recently went paddling at
a certain seaside resort an abnormally
high tide ensued.
A petition will shortly be presented to
the KI.VG for the founding of a Royal
Academy in South Africa. In one
respect, we believe, the proposed in-
stitution will be an improvement on
Burlington House, as it will admit black
and white men as members.
The Persian Government is negotiating
for the purchase of two gunboats, ostensi-
bly with the idea of putting a stop to the
operations of smugglers in the Persian
Gulf, but actually, it is thought, to be
in a position to snap its fingers at Russia.
Were it not that the following para-
graph appears in an American newspaper,
we should refuse to accept its accuracy.
"For the United Verde Copper Mine in
Arizona,"says the Chicago Record Herald,
"Senator WILLIAM CLARK, of Montana,
was recently offered £5,000,000 by an
English syndicate, but refused the offer,
as he said he did not know what to do
with the money."
Our English newspapers have no
monopoly of exquisite taste. A Spanish
journal has started a guessing competi-
tion among its readers as to the lady who
will lie chosen asa bride by King Aj.ro\so.
Mr. JOHN D. HAMI.YN has returned from
the forests of South-West Africa with a
number of wild animals. We were sorry
to see from a list that among them was a
tiger bittern. Not badly, we hope.

[SEPTEMBER 6, 1905.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FAIRY TALE.
THE pier is crowded. Overhead the
sun shines with that genial disregard of
Autumn that has made the fortunes of
so many Burnmouth landladies ; sea and
sky are alike of a pale luminous blue,
and to the south the Isle of Wight lies
like a faint cloud upon the horizon.
Because the place is famous as a health-
resort the crowd includes a sufficiency
of invalids in bath-chairs, and the gene-
ral tone of the assembly is such as to
suggest the cheerfulness of
persons who have enjoyed "a
somewhat better night." In
the centre an excellent band
is discoursing a programme
of very popular music; and
at the extreme end of the pier
an intermittent diver pursues
some mysterious avocation
below water. In short, the
scene presents what the Daily
Tel&jra/ili will next morning
describe as "an animated and
summer-like aspect."
She—the heroine of this
incident — is seated, when I
first become conscious of her
presence, upon one of the
benches that edge the pier;
her back to the sea. She is
aged perhaps eighteen sum-
mers, slightly pretty in a com-
mon-place fashion, with a
youthful an.rmic - looking
figure atrociously dressed, i
and a general appearance of
answering to the name of,
FLOSSIE. Closer, but fur-
tive, inspection explains her
as in all probability a lady-
clerk on a holiday enforced
by ill-health, and reveals the
fact that she is at present
entirely and happily absorbed
in a perusal of TJie Piebald
Fair;/ Book, a volume which
she lias selected from an un-
frequented shelf in the local
library. As having myself
enjoyed the delights of this
same book, "read to music,"
her choice seems to me to furnish an
interesting sidelight upon her person-
ality. I become vaguely curious.
"Now the Princess Myra" (as she
reads she follows the words just audibly
with her lips) "was so lovely that her
like was never before seen, and the
Princes of many lands sought her hand
in marriage." I catch a rapturous sigh.
"Going to be the sort of tale I love,
this is," she says, n neon scion sly speaking
half aloud. "Those must have been
the times to live!"
On a lower staging of the pier, where
is a perforated promenade for the use
of steamboat passep"-01-" '"""teur anglers
and the like, I now perceive a youth
standing whistling softly to himself.
He is about twenty years old, with an
expressionless face and pale eyes. He
wears a black short-tailed coat and
a motor-cap. His occupation might be
anything or nothing, and a friend who
is with him addresses him, not without
apparent justice, as ALBERT. He is staring
vacantly over the sea towards the distant
island, though it seems probable that
he does not notice it, as, from something
in the expression of his profile, I surmise

THE AMATEUR PUNTER.
BRINT. yorn WATERPROOFS.
that change of scene, unwonted leisure,
sunshine, and music are combining to
effect that process in the youth which
is known as "touching a chord."
Presently he speaks, partly to himself,
partly to his friend. "Not 'art a bad
mornin' this: not 'arf .... so sunny
and wide. Umph! Wonder what made
me think of that word .... and yet
it is somehow .... kind of iridc." He
resumes his whistling abstractedly.
Meanwhile, immediately above his
head, she is still reading. From my
position at the other corner of the same
seat, I continue to be able to follow
everv word. For some reason this
harmless eavesdropping proves more
entertaining than my own literature, a
superior and very hand-made collection
of poems, wherein so far I have not got
beyond the first, a lyric commencing :—
"Romance is fled, the world i.s drear,
We Inugh nt love, we face not fear."
Instead, I prefer to share the contents
of The Piebald Fairy Book. "So when
| the day came on which election should
! be made of the suitors, the Princess
clad herself in a gown of pure white all
embroidered with silver apples, and on
her head was a crown of gold,
wondrous rich, so that from
under it her hair fell round
about her even unto her feet."
Again the notto-wce comment
of the reader interrupts the
text, this time with perhaps
a shade of wistfulness. "My!
Fancy being got up like that!
Must ha' l(K)ked just lovely!"
Half unconsciously I see her
extend one arm along the
back of the seat and endeavour
to achieve as regal an effect
as circumstances permit.
Perhaps a little ashamed I
here endeavour to reconcen-
trate my attention upon the
poet, but it is no use. Pre-
sently I again find myself an
involuntary auditor of the
adventures of the Princess
Myra, who at this juncture
appears to have just "taken
the crown of gold from her
head and cast it into the
depths of the sea, saying,
'Whosoever shall recover me
my crown from the waves,
him only will I wed!''
"Well!" exclaims my com-
panion, as before, "she had
a nerve; no mistake!"—an
opinion in which I am in-
clined to concur.
As we reach this conclusion,
however, something happens.
With the same unconscious
dramatisation the girl is
illustrating the scene by a
slight flinging gesture of the
hand that rests upon the back of the
feat, when there is a glitter, a flop, and
the bangle on her wrist, a jewel of
native Earl's Court manufacture, has
slipped over her fingers into the water.
Glancing hastily over the. side to mark
its course, I observe the upturned
countenance of the youth named ALBERT,
close to whom the bangle fell. He is
not looking at me. His gaze has been
caught and held by that of the owner
of the trinket. For the space of ten
seconds they remained thus motionless,
while the vexed flush on the cheeks of
'the Damsel changes and deepens. Then
,with an effort she averts her head, and

the Youtli slowly
turns away. From
his expression I
should hazard a
guess that the chord
has been completed.
The Damsel takes
a deep breath.
"Well," she says,
this time fully aloud,
and to me, "that's
gone, I suppose. No
help for it!" She
again endeavours to
fix her attention upon
the book, her lips
moving as though in
a resolute effort
to overcome the
memory of those ten
seconds. "Then
Prince Florizel
pondered greatly
(I wonder if he
stared like him!)
and betook himself
to a certain Monster of the sea, very
fearful of approach, and besought the
Monster to restore to him the crown of
the Princess" (here I suspect her of
skipping half a page absently). "So he
brought the crown to the Princess."
The book is still open in her hands, but
her attention appears to wander. "Ex-
pect," I hear her murmur, "she was
jolly well pleased. Guess I 'd be pleased
enough if—but, we aren't in those days
now, worse luck! I sha'n't ever see him
again, most likely, and certainly not the
bracelet."
During jhese reflections I observe that
ALBERT, still appearing in a somewhat
dream-like condition and strangely un-
certain about the knees, has deserted his
companion and wandered as far as the
steps used by the intermittent diver,
just as the latter, looking, with his great
eyes and glistening armour, like some
monstrous creature of the deep, appears
above the surface and is hauled forth
by his assistants. At the sight an idea
seemed to strike the Youth. Out of the
corner of my eye I see him hesitate for
a moment; then, taking his courage in
both hands, and nerved, perhaps, by
a keen recollection of the Damsel, he
approaches.
"Oh," he begins, in a squeaky and
embarrassed voice, too high to be natural,
"a lady 'as just dropped 'er bracelet
overboard, and I was wonderin' if"
His voice sinks to a more confident key
and becomes inaudible; money is dis-
played; and eventually the Monster
re-descends; his assistants exchanging
signals of derision as they turn the
handles of the air-pump.

from feeling. The Damsel has allowed

her book to fall into her lap and is
gazing dreamily before her into vacancy.
Presently however she rouses herself to
a sense of duty; once again the adven-
tures of the Princess are resumed, though
with an obvious effort.
"So when the Princess saw Prince
Florizel approaching with the crown of
gold in liis hand, she rose up from her
ivory throne and cried with a loud voice
—Well, I am obliged to you! How
on earth did you ever get it?"
The change in her tone has made me
look up hastily. ALBERT is standing
before us, holding the lost bracelet. He
giggles in some confusion.

"Well," he says,
"'twasn't exactly on
earth ^at all, so ter
speak. Yer see I
thought "he fal-
ters, blushing. The
Damsel adroitly makes
room for him on the
seat between us.
"Shame to keep
you standing while
you tell me," she
observes graciously,
"if that gentleman
wouldn't mind
movin' up a bit?"
With native cour-
tesy I rise immedi-
ately and transfer
myself to the next
seat. I am afraid
afterwards that this
promptitude may
have betrayed the fact
that I was listening,
but as a matter of
fact neither of them takes .the smallest
notice of me. By the time that, I have
realised this, ALBERT has seated himself,
and, the music gliding suddenly into a
waltz refrain, the subtle effect of 3-4
time causes them to lower their voices
till only a confused murmur is audible.
When the band ceases they appear to be
on terms of intimacy.
"Yes," she says, "Jubilee Terrace,
No. 5. You can't mistake the house;
1 it's called Marina." Adding in an ex-
planatory tone, "Spelt with an A, you
i know; not the material!"
"Then," ALBERT'S voice responds, "if
jyer aunt wouldn't object, or you"
i They exchange glances. Clearly I must
I not observe any more. For the last
time 1 focus my attention determinedly
upon my book. The concluding verse of
the poem catches my eye; it is in much
the same strain as the rest—
"I/fe's wings ara furled; lifj's feot aro leal;
The last wild words of love an said,
And from a world nil cjld and deal
Romance is fled!"
At this point I close the volum; with
a bang. Next moment there is a second
gentle splash. The poems have followed
the bracelet; but I shall not trouble the
diver. ALBERT and the D.ims?! are walk-
ing up the pier side by side. It is time
for lunch.

There seems something rather grue-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
FASCINATINGLY horrible is the narrat ive of life on board a slaver
in a book entitled The Black liarque, written by T. JENKINS
HAINS (DEAN AND SON). Among the awfully repulsive
brutish characters crowded together on this vessel, and asso-
ciated with her owners' inhuman and illegal trade ashore,
there is but one man that seems to have retained any vestige
of the dignity of humanity and to lie above the level of the
least savage of the crew which, at its worst, is filthily devilish.
The Baron may be a trifle nice in his distinctions, but there
are some situations in this account of the malpractices on
board The (leiitle Hand that fairly made him squirm, shut
his eyes, and deliberate whether he should continue his peru-
sal. That he determined to finish the book is clear testimony
to the power of the author's descriptive art. There is only
one ray of pure light among all this reeking foulness and
densest darkness, illumined, as it is, from time to time, by-
lurid diabolical flashes of fire, and this is the presence of
Ifoge Allen, daughter of the trader, Yankee Dan; and though
we are encouraged to believe that salvation will come to
more than one of these unprincipled scoundrels through her
agency, yet this promise is never fulfilled, nor is the girl
allowed to be anything more than a mild relief to the
surrounding devilry and carnage. Except for this artistic
purpose the character of Rose. Allen is utterly thrown away,
and with her goes every chance of humanising romance.
It is unpleasant reading, for there is little else recorded
save slashing, swearing, quarrelling, biting and fighting.
Pandemonium afloat is this story of life on board a slave-
ship. Stirring, indeed, is the description of the pursu't of
two escaping sailors by trained blood-hounds. The fugi-
tives have their choice of plunging \n the sea and risk-
ing death by sharks, or of being pinned by blood-hounds
ashore and captured by those in command aboard the slave-
ship. This incident is powerfully absorbing, as is also the
weird description of the hurricane. But all these are but
strong " situations," and the reader goes on hoping to find
that by the writer's ingenuity he will come upon hero and
heroine, per rnnox rnxitx, per lot dixcrimina rernni, united at
last. But love is absent. The girl whom the Baron and
every reader in turn will have mistaken for the heroine,
released from her betrothal to a man she detested, turns to
the narrator, and, "her eyes flooding scorn and contempt,"—
the Baron thinks he understands what this is intended to
convey—cues, "You, a sailor, let him die, and ran to save
yourself?" "Only after he refused to go," answers the
narrator, excusing himself; "1 did all I could to persuade
him." She looked long and steadily at me. Then she
turned and went slowly below, and I saw her no more on
board." That is all. There ends whatever there was of
romantic love, or passion, in the narrative. We have been
interested in these horrors; and nothing conies of it all.
There should have been a second part.
Tlie Queen'* Man (CONSTAIH.K), by ELEANOR C. PIIIOE, is the
right Ixxjk for a rainy day. It purports, says my Nautical
Retainer, to be " A Romance of the Wars of the Roses," and
appears, appositely enough, just at the moment when the
conflict between Lancaster and York for the County Champion-
ship is still fresh in the public imagination. No previous
knowledge of history is required, though perhaps a little
subsequent reference to the chronicled facts might be useful
tiii-orrect the author's account of the fascinating qualities of
MARGARET of Anjou. All the right ingredients of romance
are here—a feudal castle, a dark weir below its walls, secret
passages and hanging arras, a Fellowship of Gentlemen
Brigands, a crypt beneath the old chapel, a donjon, flapping
banners, trusty servitors, sturdy English archers, a crafty
Italian, a wicked dowager with a dagger, and a young and
beauteous chateleinc with no fewer than four beaux to her
string. The style is neither bad nor disturbingly good; there
is no descriptive padding; no tedious delay over subtleties
of analysis: nothing, in fact, to
divert attention from a narn:-
tive replete with every form
of moving adventure. Finally,
all the awkward people are dis-
posed of at appropriate junc-
tures by different forms of death,
pleasantly varied; leaving just
the right ones that were wanted
for a happy finish. Captious,
indeed, would be the reader
who asks for a more engag-
ing romance than The Queens
Man. DE

A SECOND Eden, garden of delight,
Where jaded moilers seek a brief respite
From ledger, stool, and suit of rusty black,
The beetling boss, the intermittent sack;
Where prosperous cits that all the long week through
Have weighed out tea, sliced ham or brandished glue,
Reclining in sublime and portly ease
Admire the flowers and criticise the trees,
Or extricate with true paternal care

Its alien atmosphere of plant and palm,
The feathered choirs that chant their ceaseless song,
And most of all the varied human throng—
Solace a soul (financially oppressed)
And dower existence with a livelier zest.
Deep in the grove that crowns yon rising hill,
Young DAPHNIS (known familiarly as BILL)
Pours out the old, old tale of Love's sharp pain
In CHLOE'S shell-like ear, nor pours in vain;
While wrapped in spotless napery hard by
Their mutual lunch eludes the public eye.
Observe yon greybeard and his young girl wife,
She gazing with a listless eye on life,
He waxing eloquent about the blossom
Of some new Cattleya or Odontoglossum;
An ill-matched couple, passers-by declare,
Nor doubt some hidden tragedy is there,
Like that of Robin Gray's misplaced affection,
And poor young Jamie's fruitless resurrection.

Fancy she's merely bored—and he's her father.

How positively tight with wholesome food!
How calm he stands amid the raucous din
Of hungry wildfowl—Snakes! he 's tumbled in!

The human throng's kaleidoscopic tide
For him who loves, in some secluded nook,
To scan the page of Nature's picture book.

Bloom the exotic and the native herb;
Here sweet-voiced birds disport on easy wing,
And some that don't habitually sing;
Here smile from rockery and rustic dell
The simple home-made flowers we love so well,
Whose quaint old-fashioned names are by-words to
The Briton's tongue (I wish I knew a few !)
While yonder, warmed by artificial heat,
The tropics' gorgeous denizens compete,
The painted wantons of a passionate zone
(The simile is chaste, but not my own).

Of streets and offices and dust and smoke,
Who wots of toil's unedifying grind,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CORRECTIVE FOR THE GODS.
WHEN a lady's horse takes fright and drops his rider in a
ditch; and she is taken to a farm-house and finds a distin-
guished London doctor installed on the premises; and he
binds up her arm and mends her hal>it and they fall in mutual
love at sight; and she is a daughter of the Peerage and he the
son of the honest yeoman who tills the adjacent soil; and
they separate without discovering one another's identity;—
you have the ingredients of a very pleasant comedy-plot.
But he would indeed be an old fogey who should imagine
that at this time of day the difference in station between
these two would appreciably retard the course of true love.
Birth is so fast going out of fashion—as proved by other signs
than the Census—that my lord St. Olbyn would scarce escape
ridicule for not marching with the times, if on the mere dull
ground of obscure origin he should refuse his daughter's
hand to a fashionable doctor, drawing, no doubt, the most
enormous fees from smart society.
It was obligatory therefore that the authors of the new
Adelphi play, Dr. Wake's Patient, should devise some shock
to the congruities so gross as to revive the bogie of class
prejudice, if the happy ending was to be staved off to the
Fourth Act. This they achieve, but at the risk of reducing a
very charming comedy to the level of popular melodrama.
They manage it as follows. The Ixidi/ Gcrania, unable to
discover the name and address of the binder-up of wounds
(though she could easily have found it out by sending a
reply post-card to the farm-house) is daily losing flash,
together with all proper interest in evening parties. Accord-
ingly her father sends her to consult a fashionable doctor in
town, having first advised him by letter that he attributes his
daughter's loss of weight and spirits to the debilitating
effects of an obscure infatuation. The celebrated physician
is naturally no other than the hero of the farm-house. So
transparent is her delight at finding him that the play must
then and there have reached an untimely conclusion if he had
only prescribed the treatment thus obviously indicated. His
failure to do so can only be explained, like much else, by the
dramatic exigencies of the case. As it is, he contents himself
with recommending a change of air at Seton Barr, a little
seaside spot where he, has another patient to visit.
Here, then, there is a gathering of her clan; the doctor
joins them, and once more a premature end is in sight. But
at this juncture his father and mother intervene witli a wild
project for paying him a surprise visit. Lady Gerania's
mother, hearing through an industrious maid that Dr. Wake's
parents are expected by the hotel-manager, sends them an
invitation to dine with the family. They arrive by excursion
train, and walk up on a hot afternoon with their bundles,
whicli include' a bottle of elder-berry wine for their boy. And
here it should be explained that Dr. Wake has always obeyed
the fifth Commandment to such good purpose that he now
entertains no apprehension as to the part his parents are
likely to play at their hosts' table, piously contriving to forget
that the habit of dressing for dinner had never been regarded
as de rigueur in his home circle. When the rustic pair
reappear after a convenient stroll, dusty and "swattin"' (as
the farmer puts it), to find my lord and lady, cool and nicely
groomed, awaiting their guests, the situation has passed the
limits of laughable incongruity, and a cruel sense of embarrass-
ment, totally unshared by the good yeoman, unnerves the
petrified audience. As soon as the dreadful facts penetrate
the intelligence of nobility, the engagement, just ratified,
of its daughter to the son of such parents is at once, and
with frank brutality, repudiated. The indignation of the
staggered yeoman finds vent in a storm of platitudes worthy
of the best traditions of the old Adelphi. Had not he
and his father, and that father's father before him for
several hundred years (why not have stretched a point and
gone back to the Hereward Wakes of Ely ?) tilled the same
land? and was not one man as good as another, or even better?
Standing there in his permanent costume of breeches and
gaiters, a flush of honest pride mantling his tawny cheek, he
was a spectacle for gods and men; and a tempest of applause
swept through pit and gallery. Perorating on the significant
word "Home! Home !" he drew off his tearful spouse in that
direction, accompanied by their son, disillusioned and broken-
hearted.
Next day the faithful girl runs away after her lover, who,
however, witli his pronounced views on filial obligations,
naturally cannot countenance this deflection from the path of
duty. Parents are still parents, even in the most exalted
circles. Meanwhile his own father has had a night in which
to readjust his opinions on the equality of man, and repents
an exhibition which threatens permanently to blight his son's
prospects. On the arrival of the lady's father in hot pursuit
the good yeoman bravely owns his error; confesses to a
naughty and obstinate stomach; and admits the propriety of
an arrangement by which one star in the social firmament is
permitted to differ from another in point of precedence.
During this recantation the gods sit rebuked for their previous
applause of sentiments now withdrawn as erroneous.
Then follows a passage of real and, I think, very fresh
pathos. Rather than stand in the way of their son's happi-
ness the old couple will themselves renounce all claim to a
share in his life; and if Lord St. Olbyn will promise his
daughter to him in marriage, they on their part will under-
take, at whatever sacrifice, to go away and never see their son
again. Touched, as he well might be, by this offer of renun-
ciation, the Earl unconditionally surrenders his child to the
son of the noblest fellow he ever remembers to have met.
The Second Act, in Harley Street, was richest of all in the
diversions of pure comedy. It was an admirable idea that
Lord St. Olbyn should innocently send his daughter to her
vanished lover to be cured of a depression of which his
absence was the solitary cause. The situation which pre-
ceded their meeting offered opportunities, unusual in a con-
sulting-room, for a pretty play of Sophoclean irony; and
of these the authors made full use. This Act also intro-
duced to us Mr. GAYER MACKAY, one of the two clever authors
of the play, in the character of a man about town, with
shattered nerves and an irrepressible tendency to qualify all
his epithets with the word "ab-so-lide-ly "—a tag which was
quick to find favour. The part must have been written for
himself; certainly it could not have found a more attractive
and discreet interpreter.
As Lady Gerania, Miss LILIAN BRAITHWAITE had at List a
character in whicli she could do herself justice; and she was
simply adorable. It was an easy part to get through, but
difficult enough to play as she played it. Her sympathetic
charm of voice and manner, not only during the lighter scenes,
but where something more serious was demanded of her,
conquered and held all hearts. Mr. HALLARD, as Dr. Wake,
played with great keenness and buoyancy: but for a famous
physician with wide social experience, he was too jerky and
angular and restless. Mr. CHARLES ROCK displayed an
admirable vigour as the doctor's father. When evoking that
furore of applause by his denunciation of caste distinctions,
it must have been a grim satisfaction to him to know how
badly he was going to let the gods down in the next Act.
Miss ELSIE CHESTER gave a most finished study of the character
of the yeowoman, somewhat overshadowed by the masculine
dominance of her good man. Miss HILDA THORPE was very
happy in her portrayal of I^ady St. Olbyn's egoism and
inconsequence and delectable lack of all sense of proportion.
As the Bishop of Selby, Mr. ADAM ALEXAKDER was irresistible;
and in the small part of a gipsy-girl Miss IXA PELLY, making
her first appearance, played with spirit and intelligence, and
should be heard of again. 0. S.

CHARIVARIA.
GENERAL LINTEVITCH has been appointed
Viceroy of the Far East. He has
certainly earned a rest.
Much has been made of the generosity
of Japan in the matter of the Pence
terms, but surely a word is due to the
Russians also for their magnanimity. It
seems from a telegram sent by the Cz.\n
that the Russian Army was not only
prepared to ward off the enemy, but
also to inflict on them an important
defeat.
The SHAFT, it is said, had no idea that
the Russians had beaten the Japanese in
the War until he met the CZAR last week.
Possibly we are not out of the wood
yet, but, up to the date of going to press,
the Poet Laureate has not published any
verses on the subject of Peace in the Far
East. We have so often had occasion to
chide Mr. Ai STIN that we think it only
fair to mention this.
While it is a fact that a motor omnibus
last week damaged the pedestal of the
Cobden statue at Camden Town, it is
untrue that the driver has received a
letter of thanks from Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.
The ex-Colonial Minister conducts no
correspondence in his holidays.
On Friday week news reached us of
the official inauguration of Alberta,
Canada's new Province. On the follow-
ing Monday our daily paper contained nn
account of a collision between the Allmitu
and the Dominion. Abnit omen!
All who like to see old customs kept
up will be pleased to hear that two
Irish ferrymen sighted the sea-serpent
last week.
An employee of the Government money
factory at Washington has engraved
two full alphabets, a date, and a name
on the head of a tiny pin only sixty-five
thousandths of an inch in diameter. It
is not known why he did it.
The Virar of St. Mary's, Swansea, has
peremptorily ordered the removal of
telephone receivers (installed in the
church during his absence on a holiday)
bv which persons who were prevented
attending could hear the service, whether
they had hats on or not.
A Ryde gentleman has just left his
entire estate to his man-servant; and
yet people say that nobody is a hero to
his valet.
A dear old lady, having read that a

Lady (to lier Irarclling companion, who hag jiift had Inn finger-nail pinehed ba<fly\ "How

had brought homp six cases of beri-beri,
wrote to her fruiterers to try and get her
some, as she was tired of bananas.
It is rumoured that, as a result of the
following pretty lines which appeared in
a recent number of the Kxpress on the
subject of the Royal Exchange : —
". . . where the folk of the frescoes look out
with their wondering eyes
On the back of :in old-world beadle, who dozes,
and slumbers, and sighs,"
the beadle is to be dismissed.
The choice between marriage and gaol
was presented to a woman prisoner in a
Police Court last week, and she chose
marriage. How like a woman!
Publishers are sometimes unnecessarily
brutal. The other clay a humorous
writer received some advance copies of a
forthcoming work of his. On the parcel
was a label: —" Books with care. Keep
dry." _
A committee which has been sitting
on the subject of dre?s for our navy-men
has, according to the Express, proposed
the abolition of straw hats, loose tunics,
baggy trousers, white starched shirts, and
waistcoats. The human skin, however,
is to be retained.
We had often wondered what it was
that made employment with the National
Telephone Company so popular. We
know now. From a recent case it trans-
pires that every operator is entitled,
after two years' service, to a fortnight's
holiday.
Poor Russia! It has evidently been
resolved by the Fates that she shall
drink the cup of humiliation to the
dregs. HACKENROHMIDT has now been
defeated at the Bristol Empire.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NATURE STUDIES.
TIIE SEASIDE RETRIEVER.
THE dog whom I have recently been studying is a hand-
some black retriever who frequents for his own purposes a
stretch of sandy beach on the Norfolk coast. To particularise
nore closely would be unfair to the many hundreds of dogs
who are to be found similarly frequenting such other stretches
)f this coast as happen to be populated by juvenile visitors
luring the warmer months of the year. Indeed, every sea-
side resort has, I am sure, at least one dog exhibiting the
iquatic characteristics that mark the one whom for literary
convenience I will call mine.
When I say "my dog" I do not wish to convey any false
.mpressions of ownership. I have met this dog; he has on
more than one occasion shaken over me some of the sea
water with which he was then, as he always is, saturated;
le has barked round about me; has laid at my feet large
ind useless stones which he had rescued from the surf;
:ias, in order to rivet my attention and inveigle me into a
game, buried these stones elaborately in the sand, and lias j
ihen, with all the surprised eagerness of a discoverer, unburied
them again—all these things he has done repeatedly, but 1
am convinced he would energetically repudiate any inference
of possession or any suggestion of command which I might
endeavour to base on such exhibitions of energy. Indeed, I
liave never yet seen a seaside retriever who could lie said in
the proper sense of the term to be owned by a master or a
mistress, and my dog is no exception to the rule.
I do not know where my dog sleeps or how he gets his
food. Imagination permits me to believe that he takes his
rest upon the large buoy which bobs up and down about a
mile out, and that he has his meals brought to him now and
then by gulls. What I do know is that at ten o'clock of a
morning he is to be found on the beach busily engaged in
those industries which occupy his undivided attention during
the rest of the day. This morning, for instance, when I
arrived upon the scene of his activities, I found him joyously
enslaving a boy whom he had persuaded to throw stones
sometimes into the sea and sometimes along the shore. In
pursuit of these he plunged into the waves, swam round in
short circles, barking vigorously all the time, occasionally
dived, and then came to land again, always stoneless, but
never disheartened. Or again, if the stone happened to be
flung along the shore, he raced after it with incredible speed,
rolled over and over as he attained it, burrowed furiously
after it, and arrived back, clogged with sand, but triumphant.
It chanced that after some minutes of this sport the boy
was summoned by his parents, and left the beach for the
heights above. The dog looked after him wistfully, but,
finding there was no prospect of a renewal of that game, he
soon made up his mind. A short distance away he observed
a group consisting of three small girl children, two nurses
and a mother who, with her back propped against a heap of
sand, was dividing her mind between a novel and such
exhortations as the requirements of her family from time to
time demanded. My dog studied this innocent assortment of
females with great attention, and then proceeded with sublime
craft to mould them to his desires. To have rushed upon them
violently would have defeated his purpose, for he could have
hoped nothing from them after casting them into terror and
sprinkling them with sand and sea. He advanced slowly and
humbly, pausing every now and again to see if he was
observed. No notice having been taken of Lira, he at last
arrived at the edge of the circle of frocks and bare feet, and
t'lere sat down with a most deprecating expression on his
moist black face.
"Oh, isn't that a pretty dog!" said one of the nurses.
At this encouragement my friend seemed to emerge from
an'abyss of depression. He presented a paw to the apprecia-
tive nurse, and licked the plump hand of the smallest child.
Being still further encouraged and admired he now felt that
his moment had come. He retired a few feet, picked up a stone
in his mouth and laid it submissively down in the midst of
the group. "Throw it for him, Pou.v," said the deceived
mother to her eldest. "He wants to play with you."
Instantly the dog was on the run, rapturously barking,
and for the next half-hour he had no lack of willing victims,
all of whom in turn he succeeded in bowling over on the
sand. Finally he saw a larger party newly arrived, and with
a disgusting faithlessness removed himself at once to them.
Of such a nature are the proceedings of the seaside retriever.
He might have been employed in tracking the running part-
ridge or adding rabbits to a sportsman's bag. Instead
of these congenial feats a perversion of nature has imposed
upon him the research of stones and futile plunges into the
sea. It is probable that some such dog was the original
progenitor of the tribe of seals—whom, in truth, in his damp
state he much resembles. Once a seaside retriever always a
seaside retriever. There is no human power that could lure
my dog, at any rate, from the watery games on which he
spends his time and his strength.
PUBLIC SPIRIT.
THE offer of the altruistic Mexican to pay off the national
debt of Mexico has, we are glad to say, incited several of our
eminent men to impulses of equally Quixotic patriotism.
Offers, indeed, come in daily, and where more fittingly than
to Mr. Punch's letter-lx>x?
Mr. BRODRICK has risen to great heights. In these days of
selfish personal advancement, he says, a stand must be made
by some one in an exalted position, and that stand he, for one,
is prepared to make. Under no conditions, he informs us,
will he consent to be made Viceroy of India.
Mr. WILL CROOKS, M.P., the genial and Progressive Member
for Woolwich, has offered to cease from criticism of the
Government if an explicit understanding is given that no
Conservative will ever again quote Latin in the House.
Verb. sap. No answer lias yet been received.
Mr. HALL CAINE, the talented novelist, with a Daily Tele-
graphic circulation and a coiffure that is the envy of the
loveliest village of the plain, is as full as usual of bounding
benevolence. He will, he says, write no more novels and no
more plays, and will cease to be photographed and inter-
viewed, if, on his evacuation of office, Mr. BAI.FOUR will make
him a Peer. By way of services rendered, he points to his
illustrious career as a novelist, his busy, self-sacrificing life in
the House of Keys, and his duties as cicerone on the occasion
of His MAJESTY'S visit to the Isle of Man. Enough, enough,
all will cry.
Sir HENRY CAMPBEIJ.-BANNERMAN, fresh from his attendance
on Hi.s MAJESTY at Marienbad, has a different ideal of
patriotism. For him it is not renunciation, but the strenuous
life. If only he has the opportunity, he says, he will govern
this country as it has never been governed before, and spare
no effort or time in the task.
We have the best authority for stating that Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL, with a heroism that cannot be too highly appre-
ciated by his old colleagues, has resolutely declined to accept
the flattering offer of the Chiltern Hundreds. As he wittily
puts it, "In politics it is only centenarians who think about
Hundreds. I only think of ' scores.'"

in the New York Herald, to have said that the
theatrical producer must make money for every-
body but himself. The following verses are
entirely based upon this statement, and their
author lays no claim to privileged information.]
READER, pause and drop a tear
On this sympathetic page,
For the man who, year by year,
Works without a proper wage.
FK-IIM-N never makes a cent,
He has higher objects which
Show a soul of sentiment:
He makes other people rich.

With their splendid, shining hats,
His discoloured billycock.

Thousands over Peter Pan,
B-KK-E comes along and takes
All the lot—disgusting man!
While the fatted actors thrive
On their chicken and champagne,
FR-HM-N keeps himself alive
On a diet, good but plain.
While the avaricious "stars"
(Oh, the salaries they draw !)
Rush about in motor-cars,
FR-HM-N takes a 'bus—with KL-W.
Scenic artists have their price;
CMIKS-N will not make a wig
Gratis. FR-HM-N pays them twice
(FR-HM-N'S not a greedy pig).

Come in mercenary mobs.
All with eager, outstretched hands;

Landlords call on quarter-days.

All, and more than, he has got.

Can we let this martyr die

MORE ECLIPSE HUMOURS.
MR. PUNCH'S own representative at the
recent eclipse, having read Sir NORMAN
LOCKYER'S side-splitting article in the
Daily Mail on the humours of that
event, hastens to supplement it with a
record of his own.
As in the great astronomer's camp, so
(lie writes) in ours, laughter prevailed.
But we went farther in our sallies than
Sir NORMAN. To call the long telescope1
the Twopenny Tube was delicious, it is
true, but how about charging twopence
to look through it? That is what we
did. No dogs or heavy luggage allowed.
We also had a Long Tom, and when
time hung at all heavy on our hands (as
it will do, even during astronomical
picnics) did we not with the highest of
spirits affect to load and discharge it?
By Jingo, we did, until the very stars
could hear our shouts of laughter.
Talk about clowns and King's Jesters,
there is no such wag as your watcher of
the skies. And what did Sir NORMAN'S
party call their fillets when they came
smoking to the table? Did they call
them the Eclipse Steaks? No. We did.
And when the eclipse was in full
swing and the darkness came on, how
did Sir NORMAN and his jokers take it?
Did they say facetious things about
turning up the gas or switching on the
electric light? Did they ask where was
MOSES under similar conditions? We
did. I hate to think that any of these
chances were missed. Perhaps Sir
NORMAN will write another article for
the Mail, supplementing the drollery of
his first.

FROM HIGH ALTITUDES.
A SIMPLE SOlll'
That lives among the heather,
Where roll the mists for evermore,
What should it know of weather?
I met young PETER with his cow
Far from the haunts of men.
The early sun was on the knowe,
The mist was on the Ben.
"Good morning. What about," said I,
"The weather, PETER GRAY?"
And PETER straightway made reply,
"A wee thing saft the day."
Again. I met, when noon was high,
Young PETER with his cow.
The sun had vanished from the sky,
The rain was falling now.
"Good Any," said I. "The rain is sore
Upon the new-cut hay."
And PETER answered as before,
"A wee thing saft the day."
At eve descended sheets of rain
That hid the nearest knowe,
And on the road I met again
Young PETER with his cow.
Still through the mist I seemed to hear
The voice of PETER GRAY
Falling familiar on my ear—
"A wee thing saft the day."
At night a wilder deluge yet
Poured from the hill's black brow,
And in the flood again I met
Young PETER with his cow.
I pass, in sullen silence, by;
But ere I was away
I heard a voice—it said, "Ou ay,
A wee thing saft the day."
BY THE WATERS OF WINDER-
MERE.
EXTRACT FROM THE RECESS DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Ambleside, Monday.—Back to Winder-
mere after two years' absence. Aboard
the Anita, sloop-rigged racer of six tons
measurement, rushing down the Lake
with her starboard gunwale awash.
GEORGE at the helm; Pleasure at the
prow and far beyond it. A little late
in the season, but a squadron of yachts
still out, all sailed by their owners.
There was probably yachting on
Windennere in Norse times. Doubtless
ONUNDR and GUXNAR raced eacli other
from Lakehead to the Ferry, their clans-
men looking on. Certainly, as records
tell, there has been yachting ou the
Lake for more than a hundred years.
The Royal Windennere Yacht "Club
have in their house on the Lake, delight-
ful picture of a race at some undated
time. The costumes bewray the period
of GEORGE THE FOURTH. The ladies
watching the struggle from broad-
bottomed boats wear coal-scuttle bon-
nets and shoulder capes with broad
white collars. As for the gentlemen,
the sign and token of a good waterman
in that far-off day apparently was to wear
a top hat narrowing to the brim, and dis-
play a pair of braces crossing a coatless,
vestless back.
Those not privileged to see this quaint
picture in the Club-house will find a
perfect reproduction in the record of
the Club edited by Sir WILLIAM FORAVOOD,
illustrated by the Vice-Commodore ISAAC
STOREY, with "some account of Winder-
mere," charmingly written by Canon
RAWXSLEY, Vicar of Crosthwaite.
To the outsider Windennere is chiefly
associated with the name of WORDSWORTH
and his brother poets of the Lakes. But
there were other men of letters of whom
one thinks as the Anita cleaves the brown
waters with her gracefid prow. In the
days of Maya CHRISTOPHER NORTH lived,
nay reigned, here. Elleray still stands
at the lower end of the Lake.
Just eighty years ago there were great
doings on Windermere, under the direc-
tion of Lord High Admiral CHRISTOPHER.
A grand regatta was decreed in honour of
the poets. WALTER SCOTT was there, and
in a letter dated August 22, 1825, gives
an account of the proceedings. Among
other honoured guests were WORDSWORTH,
LOCKHART, and CANNING, then nearing his
end, already broken down in health, and,
as LOCKHART reports WORDSWORTH to have
genially remarked, "seeming to have no
mind at all."
CHRISTOPHER, not at the moment
"crusty" as TENNYSON found him, led the
procession of boats, with Mrs. WTILSON in
the seat of honour, crowned with a grand
turban and streamers. Fifty barges
followed, decorated with flags, "accom-
panied," as crabbed LOCKHART writes,
"by two execrable bands of music."
Gone is the leading barge now, sailed
on to cross the Styx, with CHRISTOPHER
NORTH'S grand figure in the stern, tiller
in hand; for fellow-passengers the worn-
out statesman whom GLADSTONE revered,
the biographer of WALTER SCOTT, and the
poet who did for the Lake Country what
the Wizard of the North did for Scotland.
Their fame is deathless as the hills that
looked down on the procession, and to-
day see the smart craft of the Royal Yacht
Club skimming across the Lake,
. . . trim skiffs unknown of yore
On winding lakes and rivers wide
That fear no spite of wind or tide.
But I was going to write about GEORGE,
captain and crew of the Anita. GEORGE
must wait till next week.

THE LADIES' COLUMN.
OfR first thought this month must be
the all-important one of cliapeaux. And,
by the way, I hear that the post-bag of a
certain Cornish Vicar has been crammed
lately with grateful letters from milliners,
who wish to endorse his remarks about
the shameful conduct of women who dare
to appear sans toque, sans chapeau in his
dear little church. There is also some
talk of a deputation of prominent artistes
attending the Church Congress to pre-
sent a resolution on the subject, and to
urge the Bishops to stand firm.
As little Madame JULIETTE said to me
the other day with tears in her eyes, "It
is not as eef chajieaux could not be
arranged for every face. If those ladies
who made the objection would but have
come to me, / would have found them
something to suit them. Me, I fail
never!'"
. And now for the autumn fashions.
After a careful inspection of all the
leading milliners' windows it is evident
that this autumn will find our dear little
songsters with us more than ever.
Feathers, wings, plumes- all are l)eing
used for the tasteful and beautiful crea-
tions witli which we women must cover
our heads. And this reminds me of a
beautiful thought that I saw sweetly
carried out—in a well-known artiste'*
window, not many yards from a certain
shop where they sell leather belts! The
window was full of hats trimmed with
birds' feathers and plumes. From all
lands the little dickies had flown to perch
on the crowns and brims—humming
birds, birds of paradise-—as 1 heard a
charming American girl saying, " I guees •
there '11 be a gocxl many birds in Paradise
this fall! "—and our own little feathered
friends from the woods and hedgerows
—all were there. But what brought
happy tears to my eyes was the placard
in front of the window. In one corner i
was the picture of a nest of young birds,
with the mother sitting on it, while
underneath was written, " Aids to church
worship." Could anything have been
sweeter and more appropriate? It was
just that little touch of thoughtfulness
and reverence that is so much needed in
this dear worldly London of ours, and as
I stood in front of that window I could
not help wishing that that dear man in
Cornwall could have been there beside me.
How it would have rejoiced his heart!
Then about dress.

will be glad to know that their nice
bright tartans will be much worn this
autumn. The effect will be exceedingly
martial and inspiriting. One well-known
tailor is making up the tartans in what
he calls " the Rnox Pattern," in allusion,
of course, to that disagreeable man's
phrase, "the regiment of women." I
near tliat "tartan parties" are being

Altogether, there is every prospect of
a busy, happy autumn.

A NEW GUIDE TO THE LAKES.
[Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN has been visiting Giun-
Ijerland and has recorde<l his opinion that:
"People need not go to Switzerland for more
beautiful scenery than this—there is nothing
like it."]
OF all the divers charms that dot
The pleasant face of rural Britain,
There lingers yet a beauty spot
Whose rare attractions are unwritten;
Accessible (by means of brakes
From Keswick) to the casual tourist,
Our recognition of the Lakes-
Till recently—has been tlie poorest.
It needs a modern poet's eye
To note their restfulness and greenery
That more than adequately vie
With all your Continental scenery.
How little on a theme like this
J^The language of the common herd's
worth!
SOUTHEY, e.g., appeared to miss
A lot of points, and so did WORDS-
WORTH.
True, they were Laureates: COLERIDGE too
(Although from want of inspiration
He never won like them and you
That priceless piece of vegetation)
Has left behind some scattered tips
Upon the country's scenic merit,
Yet never caught the note that grips
Imagination like a ferret.
What did they know of flowers and trees?
Their shallow songs are mere mono-
tony.
They hadn't spent a cultured ease
Ju writing versicles on botany.
Living, besides, so near the place,
How coxild they feel the tripper's duty
Of crying with enraptured face,
"Observe that mountain! What a
beauty!"
But you—who tramp in tourist's boots
(We like to fancy) up Helvellyn,
You can appraise the various routes,
And rub the local colour well in;
You see at once the classic side,
You know the Naiad like a daughter;
Where could we find a better guide
To Bassenthwaite and Derwentwater?
The psychologic fashion stales;
We need another Nature poet;
Write -we implore -till fancy fails,
And mere exhaustion makes you stow
it;
So shall it be your lot perhaps
To lead the steps of after ages,
Published in parts with coloured maps,
8vo, cloth, and gilt-edged pages.
EXTRACT from a gentleman's letter to
the " Western Morning Neirs " : —
"At about one o'clock, when the eclipse was
on the sun, I saw a most beautiful slur shining
very bright, just to the northward of the sun,
and I pointed it out to three ladies (who were
watching the eclipse in a bath of water) ....
Is this an unusual occurrence?"
We sincerely hope and believe that
it is.
A DIVERTING example of absent-minded-
ness occurred at an indoor concert the
other day. A loyal old gentleman who
had been dozing was suddenly awakened
by the strains of "God Sare the King."
He arose hurriedly, snatched off his wig,
and held it reverently in his hand until
the anthem was at an end.

"Conclusion of Peace?" Why, I quite
thought it had only just begun!
THE DUST-BIN ERA.
AMONGST other siiggestions made by
a writer in the Queen towards the
simplification of domestic help is a
hint that the disagreeable business of
"washing up" might be entirely obviated
by eating off "paper plates and dishes
which might be burnt after use." We
seem to see here the dawn of a new
epoch in which the house will be a mere
annex to the Dust-bin, and the Sink will
lapse into oblivion. "No cleaning" will
be the motto of the scullery-maid, and
there shall be no necessity to scrub the
steps every morning. We shall simply
tear off a leaf of prepared surface after
the manner of a blotting-pad, and apply
to the nearest stationer when the levels
of the threshold are getting low. In like
manner the yearly tenant will lay down
his fifty-two paper carpets one on top of
another when entering upon his lease,
and convey a stratum to the ash-heap
week by week. Laundresses, of course,
are doomed, the waste-paper basket,
when necessary, acting as their substi-
tute. We have already "no-hatters"
and "no-booters," and the principle will
be extended, and we shall probably hear
of "no-shirters" and "anti-collarites."
The handkerchief question can be solved
on the Chinese system. Where, how-
ever, a foolish prejudice retains these
various articles of costume, a bonfire
every Monday morning will soon dispose
of all the soiled imitation-linen. The
paper-draper is going to replace the
haberdasher and the modiste. Paper
boots have long been obtainable from
army contractors, so these can be bought
and used up by the gross, thereby doing
away with the distasteful task of black-
ing them day by day. Other portions
of dress, if worn, may be constructed of
brown paper, but much is to be said in
favour of a return to the fashions of our
early British ancestors. Darning and
sewing will be classed among the lost
arts, if indeed they are not so already.
At mealtime we foresee great changes.
In old-fashioned households, where
families still feed at home and do not
patronise the restaurant, we shall have
the service performed by dumb plate-
bins, alias receptacles into which each
dish can be thrown when done with.
Paper knives and forks, it may be
thought, present a difficulty, but, with
the Japanisation of the world, we shall
most probably learn to handle chopsticks.
Paper constitutions and paper Acts
of Parliament, and much else that
looks well on paper, we have been
familiar with for many years past, and
now we are promised the reality.
It will not matter if anything "conies
off in the 'and" of the few remaining
Phyllises of the future, as nothing will
be made to last.
When most things go, after twenty-
four hours' use, to the Dust-hole and the
Destructor, the problem of the Simple
Life for Housemaids will be solved.
The weary charwoman also, whose
epitaph records her satiety of washing
and scrubbing and sweeping, will
achieve her desire on earth and lie " go-
ing to do nothing for ever and ever."
SHOULD MILLERS WEAR WHITE
HATS?
DEAR SIR,—What on earth is Canon
SLIOER driving at? In my young days
a miller without a hat would have been
considered a positive impropriety. In
the case of the Miller's Daughter the
matter is even more serious, and I
regard some form of decent head-gear
as absolutely indispensable.
Yours faithfully,
VICAR OF BRAKSTOCK.

No-Hat League, and one who has never

form of frippery, I wish to record
emphatically my protest.

sand, seidlitz powder, dynamite and
other deleterious substances with ordi-
nary wheat-flour [This letter seems

DEAR SIR,—Only for photos.

GERTRUDE MILLAR.
DEAH SIR,—Why not?
JOE MILLER.
DEAR SIR,—I remember my grand-
mother saying that she recollected meet-
ing a friend of a certain very notable
miller of the tune, who pursued his
unselfish vocation in the vicinity of the
river Dee. She is not quite clear as to
his opinion upon this very interesting
topic, but believes him to have stated
more than once that he was entirely
indifferent to the opinions of the rest of
the world, and that (so far as he was
able to judge) they (the rest of the
world) reciprocated this sentiment to-
wards himself. Yours sincerely,
H. T. TOLLEMACHE ToLLKMACHE.
Other correspondents appear to have
confounded the main issue of the ques-
tion with more or less irrelevant topics,
such as Should Cats eat Bats? What
are the Wild Waves saying? and Are
Mushrooms poisonous? Their effusions
are therefore reluctantly withheld.

came down to us, the village
immediately went mad over
him, and LILLIAN simply threw
herself at his head. He all
but caught her. It was what
the Bparttman would call "a
sharp one-banded chance that
the reverend gentleman got
to, but could not hold."
The reverend gentleman's
name was HAYLING. He had
the ordinary sort of face, and
the only point about him that
I could see was that he
couldn't pronounce his "r's."
You would think that this
would rather do for a Vicar,
but the fellow had a positive
genius for getting hold of
words that hadn't got an "r"
in them. Of course he couldn't
help himself in the actual
service, but lie never once
said "my brethren" in his
sermons, which is pretty
casual in a Vicar who has got
his majority so early. And
out of church he would
often go through a whole
week without giving him-
self away. He was aw-
fully sensitive on the
subject.
Well, LILLIAN, as I say, made herself
silly about him; and I saw at once that
it would want all my skill and tact to
lure her away from the HAYLING'S net.
I used to spend days trying to have
him on about his "r's," but the brute
was extraordinarily cunning, especially
when LILLIAN was about. We talked
over the war a good deal, and of course
I thought I had him there. But no.
It was always " The People of the CZAR,"
or the "Slav," or—what are those things
you scratch?—oh yes, the "Tartar";
never once Russia or the Russians. Jolly
luckily for him LINIEVITCH was in com-
mand just then, but once, when I did

the secret about the dog; and of course
she knew about LILLIAN and me. We
were all in the garden, and suddenly
GRACE said:
"Oh, you Ve brought your dear little
dog, Mr. HAYLINC,. What is its name?"
The Vicar looked away.
"]\'afflcx," he said.
"Oli, what did you say?"
"Waffles." said HAYLINC,, angrily.
"DiCK, if you make such a noise with
your pipe I can't hear anything. I beg
your pardon, Mr. HAYLINC. V"
"Waffles," said the Vicar, looking
absolutely furious.
"Ah, yes," said GRACE, vaguely. And
we camped there for the night, so to
speak.
After tea the attack was
renewed. Raffles was being
taught by LILLIAN to beg, and
we were all sitting around and
watching.
"Oh, by the way, HAY-
LING," I siid, "HOLT 's got
two ripping little Irish ter-
riers he wants to get rid of.
I said I 'd take one, and re-
commended you for the other.

"I should be happy to do
Mr. HOLT a good turn," said
the Vicar, complacently.
"Right. I'll tell him.

There was a moment's
silence. Then the Vicar blew
his nose.
"HOLT is very keen that we
shouldn't change their names,
and as he's taught them no

It was a bit unlucky for

moment.

"And who is this famous—ah—

"I am afraid you don't read your Pall

"I have no time to waste on minor
fiction. HALL CAINE and Miss—that is,
the lady of Avon— have no charms for
me."
"RAFFLES was a thief," I said, " and so
is this Raffles. He '11 steal your slippers,

Three days later my sister-in-law and
I went over to LILLIAN'S. As we expected,
HAYLING was there. I had let GRACE into

very moment to stand on his

was, glanced angrily at the Vicar. I lit
a pipe very deliberately,
"By the way, HAYLING," I said, "you
won't mind, I'm sure, but as 1 was up
there I chose mine."
There was really a fine pause here,
just as I wanted. Then said HAYLING—
he simply couldn't help himself—
"Which—which one did you choose?"
I lit another match.
"Buffles," I Slid.
GRACE came in eagerly.
"Oh, then Mr. HAYLING'S is Ruffles!
What funny names he has for his dogs!
What do you call this? Something like
Apples or Raffles, didn't you say?"
Then Mr. HAYLING said something
that wasn't a bit like Apples — or
Raffles.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHANGE AND REST.
IF your holiday should take you to a continental land,
And you meet a figure strange and hollow-eyed,
With a guide-rope girt about him and a Murray in his hand,
Rushing frantically up a mountain side;
Oh! think not 'tis a madman who has broken loose again,
Or a felon, by police officials pressed,
It is merely dear old JoiDfsox, who, to soothe his weary brain,
Is seeking for a little change and rest.
He has only got a month, and there are scores of peaks to
climb,
So he cannot waste his days in sluggish ease;
He wants to visit Nuremberg and Munich in the time,
With a detour by the Spanish Pyrenees.
Then to Sheringham or Cromer he will swiftly wend his way,
Where, to give, he says, his appetite a zest,
He will bicycle and bathe, and play two rounds of golf a day—
His notion of a pleasant change and rest.
If, later on, it chance that down Throgmorton Street you pace,
And you meet a being hollow-cheeked and pale,
With nervous breakdown stamped on ev'ry feature of his face,
And knees that, in his going, droop and fail,
With garments hanging loosely on his worn and shrunken
frame,
That once was plump and scrupulously dressed,
You '11 recognise poor JOIDJSON. He will tell you, to his shame,
That he's better for his jolly change and rest.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Shakspeare's Christmas (SMITH, ELDER) is the title of half a
dozen stories "Q" collects and presents in a handy volume.
Presumably, as he places this particular story first and gives
its name to the book, he regards it as head, if not shoulders,
above its fellows. That is a point of preference on which my
Baronite does not agree with his gifted friend. He frankly
admits that he is not in a position to judge of the work as
a whole, since, to tell the truth, after honest endeavour
he was obliged to give up the attempt to read it through.
That fact has, however, its bearing on the case. For the rest,
the stories are delightful, far beyond the average of this most
difficult literary labour. They are full of character and action,
touched up here and there with flashes of humour. For the
most part "Q " goes back to historic epochs for his narrative
plot and characters, and has evidently spent loving endeavour
in acquiring local colour. The portrait of Cajitain Blitjh,
late of the Bounty, for example, is admirable. "The Rain of
Dollars," an episode in the retreat of Sir JOHN MOORE'S army
from Corunna, is a masterful piece of vivid writing, and so is
the story with the alluring title, "The Man Behind the
Curtain."
TJie Queer Quakeress of the North and the Sly Seductive
Southerner might comprehensively have been the title
of The Qufikeresn, by MAX ADELER (WAHD, LOCK & Co.).
The plot is well conceived, and, certainly, it is a power-
fully written novel. The story opens just before the com-
mencement of the fratricidal American Civil War, and is
carried through the earlier part of that deadly struggle
between North and South. This somewhat dangerous ground
is treated with artistic self-restraint, and we are spared the
horrors in which MAX ADELER, had he given way to Zola-
esque inspiration, might have plunged us. The interest
aroused at the very first in the principal characters is well
sustained up to the end. That to many English readers it
may recall the earlier part of the story of Steerforth, Little
Emily, and Ham is not improbable; but, unprincipled as was
David Copper field's hero, yet the gay young Southerner
Clayton, as a reprobate, can give Steerforth several points,
and win easily. To compare the well-instructed Quakeress
Abby with the uneducated Emily would be manifestly un-
fair, but though the former does not take the irreparable
step that ruined J'cijijotti/'s niece yet her will consents, and
there is little left of strict virtue in the beautiful Quakeress
who retains only the peculiar costume and language of
"The Friends." It is a clever and interesting portrait of a
self-deceiving girl, who is necessarily a deceiver of those
nearest and dearest to her. The character of the model
young Quaker George Fatherly is admirably depicted, as is
also that of the would-be seducer Clayton, physically brave,
morally contemptible. The other secondary personages are
all well drawn, and the comedy provided by the Ponder family,
though lacking in originality, is not obtrusive. Altogether
a book that the Baron has no hesitation in recommending.
Driven (FisHER UNWIX) is a story gleaned amid the simple
annals of the poor. It is set in the good old times of "the
hungry forties," when statesmen did not bandy phrases
about Retaliation, Colonial Preference, and the like. They
honestly spelt Protection with a big P, and openly enforced
it. Mistress MAnn.\iiET WATSON, without attempt at preaching
a moral, or effort at picturesque writing, tells, with pathos
the more powerful, how the agricultural labourer and his
family lived when corn was ten shillings a bushel, bacon
eighteenpence a pound, wages for the head of the family
nine shillings a week; the dulness of domestic life being
varied by sending to jail for a month a starving man who ate
a pennyworth of turnips pilfered from his master's field,
fourteen days being the penalty for stealing five eggs. In
such a state of things, crime in the way of poaching, burglary
or highway robbery was common, not infrequently ending in
the head of the family or other of its main supports being
sent " over seas " for seven or fourteen years. My Baronite
cannot recommend the book to any who when they take up
a novel delight to find themselves in the society of those who
siller hae and walk in silk attire. It is all very sad, but it is
very human, and, by chance or design, has its special lesson
for to-day.
Tlie Fate of Luke Ormerod (HuitST AXD BLACKETTX by RICHARD
DowLfNO, commences so well that even a partial failure on
the part of the author to keep up to his own standard is
exceptionally disappointing. The leading notion has suffi-
cient originality to be strongly attractive. "Blessed are they
who expect nothing," says that irreverent old rascal Major
Monsoon, "for verily they shall not be disappointed." Now,
the earlier part of this novel leads the reader to be on the
constant look-out for a mystery that shall puzzle the sharpest
plot-detector among the most experienced novel-readers.
A trifle more excogitation on the part of the author, another
wet towel round his throbbing
brain, just an extra day's
isolation, and we might have
had such a romance of real life
as would have created a pro-
found impression. Good as the
plot is, it might so easily have
been so much better. Yet can
the Baron conscientiously re-
commend it, and much woidd
he have liked to be able to add
that here, at last, was an Eng-
lishman who had outgaboriau'd

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LIST, YE LADIES.
[Prompted by the laudable desire to keep his
columns thoroughly up-to-date and at the same
time to promote national efficiency, Mr. Punch
has resolved, in deference to repeated requests,
to open a "Woman's Exchange Column"
in which the legitimate curiosity of his fair
readers will be fully and rationally gratified.
The subjoined specimen inquiries and replies
are accordingly submitted as a guide to intend-
ing correspondents.]
WHAT MANY GIRLS WANT TO KNOW.
"How can I break my engagement?"
asks a correspondent, pathetically.
"What is the best way to set about it?"
Possibly some cynics may snort at the
ingenuous candour of this question, but
when we reflect that after all two lives
may be wrecked by the perseverance in
a course rashly adopted in a moment of
expansion, compassion and not mockery
should be aroused.
We fear, however, that no infallible
remedy can be prescribed to solve this
problem. Circumstances alter cases,
and elopement can only be justified by
results, or perhaps we should say, if the
favoured swain is more eligible as well as
more muscular than his rival. A few
weeks earlier we should have been in-
clined to recommend swimming the
Channel as a convenient means of extrica-
tion, but it is not all skins that will
stand shark's oil supplemented by a
coat of resin.—" AUNT SARAH."
TO-DAY'S INQUIRIES.
1. How can I cure my parrot (aged
forty-five) of swearing?—VERONICA (Ash-
ford).
2. What is the best way to make a
Macedonia jelly?—Mrs. McTuRK (Bex-
hill-on-Sea).
3. How can I make a horse and
cabbage dumpling as in Germany ?-
Hrrro (Sadlers Wells).
4. What is the right way to extract
the greatest amount of nourishment from
a vegetable marrow-bone? — ANXIOUS
HAIGITE (Poplar).
5. The figs on iny tree never ripen.
Would it be safe to make them into a
fig pudding? My husband is a man of
violent temper.—ANGELA (Peckham Rye).
TO-DAY'S REPLIES.
Cure for iMrymjitis. —If anyone suffer-
ing from laryngitis, tonsilitis, or any
kindred complaints, will put a heaped-up
tablespoonful of red pepper into a half
tumblerful of methylated spirits, light
the liquid with a braided fusee and
gargle for a quarter of an hour, the
complaint will be completely and per-
manently cured. I can state positively
that whenever and wherever the above
remedy has been faithfully used, the
sufferer has never complained of any
recurrence of the symptoms, or indeed
raised any complaint at all.—(Miss)
WINNIE P. (Hanwell).

OMNE IGNOTUM PRO TERRIFICO.
1 WOT 'RE \\K TKB DO, BILL? IF IT wus ONLY A DORCI I 'n OIIAWNCE IT—BUT THEM THISOS!'
How to make, a Chocolate Mould sit
up.—If the mould is in a state of complete
collapse, and the weather very warm, of
course nothing can be done. But if it
is only limp an injection of isinglass
and shellac will work wonders. Failing
that, it is best to prop up the mould
with a small zareba of whalebone, which,
however, must not be included in the
portion served to each guest.—MAHIA
JOLY (Bangor).
AMBIGUOUS.—The visitors' book at a
seaside resort contains the following
entry:—"The Rev. returned and
was again made comfortable. The needs
of an entomologist are simple, if gener-
ally numerous, but the landlord was
indefatigable and successful in supply-
ing all wants."
A NEWSPAPER asks the question, "Are
yachtsmen rude?" We don't know, but
they are certainly often in Solent.

[SEPTEMBEB 20, 1905.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
THE SEAMY SIDE OF MOTLEY.
LADY, when we sat together,
And your flow of talk that turned
On the Peace, the Play, the Weather,
Left me frankly -unconcerned,
I could Ree how hard you labour'd
Till your brain was stiff and sore,
Never having yet been neighbour'd
By so dull a bore.
Later on, from information
Gathered elsewhere after lunch,
You had got at my vocation,
Learned that I belonged to Punch,
And in tones of milk and honey
You invited me to speak
On the art of being funny,
Funny once a week.
Madam, though your heart, I know,
meant
Well—in its peculiar way,
Yet I could not, at the moment,
Find a fitting word to say;
I could not for love or money
Own, aloud, the quite unique
Strain of trying to be funny,
Funny every week.
'Tis a task that haunts me waking,
Like a vampire on the chest,
Spoils my peace, prevents my taking
Joyance in another's jest;
Makes me move abroad distracted,
Trailing speculative feet;
Makes me wear at home a rack'd head
In a sodden sheet.
Women hint that I am blinded
To their chaste, but obvious, charms;
Sportsmen deem me absent-minded
When addressed to feats of arms;
If the sudden partridge rises
I but rend the ambient air;
And the rabbit's rude surprises
Take me unaware.
Life for me's no game of skittles
As at first you might opine;
I have lost my love of victuals
And a pretty taste in wine;
When at lunch your talk was wasted,
Did you notice what occurred,—
How I left the hock untasted,
How I passed the bird?
If my wits were vaguely wandering,
Here must lie my poor excuse,—
They were in the act of pondering
O'er a mot for public use;
Theme (a horrid one)— the slaughter
Where the wells of Baku boil;
Joke—the need of pouring water
On the troubled oil.
Madam, haply you may miss it;
Mots ere now have fallen flat;
I could make it more explicit,
But we '11 leave the thing at that:
Don't for my sake mar your beauty,
Tracking down the devious clue;
I have simply done the duty
I was bound to do.
Yet, if you would grant a favour,
In your orisons recall
One whose smile could scarce be graver
If his mouth were full of gall;
Let your lips (that shame the ruby)
Pray for mine all wan and bleak
With the strain of trying to be
Funny every week. 0. S.
MILITARY NOTES.
[The announcement that the latest style of
tunic adopted by the German Army is "cut
like a blouse" has, it is said, aroused great
interest at the War Office, and it is thought
probable in many quarters that, at no very
distant dote, we shall see the idea adopted and
very possibly developed in this country. If
such is the case, the military notes of the
future will, presumably, be couched in the
following strain :—]
NEVER has the Dress Reform Com-
mittee of the War Office given us more
striking proof of the excellence of its
taste than in the latest issue of the
Anny Fashions Intelligencer. Those
amazingly clever modistie experts,
Mesdames BLANCHE, ROSE and LILY, are
ever on the qui vlve for all that is new
and rltlc in the world of dress, and it is
mainly owing to their efforts that the
British Army can now boast that it is
the best dressed force in Europe. A
few words on the latest ideas that have j
emanated from those active brains will ]
probably not be unwelcome to our
j readers.
Especially fetching is the new mess
jacket of the Ninety-ninth Hussars.
Fashioned of a peculiarly effective cloud-
grey estrella, it is made to fit closely
at the waist, the coat being outlined
j daintily with deep orange velvet, which
also appears on the prettily puffed
sleeves. Over it the charmingly cut
double collar fastens with fichu effect,
crossing quite low down to show a
V-shaped vest of Valenciennes lace. A
swathed belt of taffetas is afterwards
hooked over the left side and forms the
finishing touch to what is really the
daintiest unifonn imaginable.
As is only natural, in the regiments
of the Line a rather quieter tone is to
prevail. The committee of experts,
however, have left no stone unturned to
make the imiforms as chic and attractive
as possible consistently with lowness of
price, and very well they have done
their work. We cannot but hold, for
example, that the Mudfordshires' new
bolero, with its blue velvet-faced collar,
strappings, and rows of little metal
buttons, is a miracle of cheapness at
69s. llrf. Extremely reasonable, too, at
48«. 3fd. is the Slopshires' latest tunic,
an exquisite creation in black chiffon,
accordion pleated and lined with glace
silk, a relief to the dead black being
afforded by motifs of jet.
Our American cousins have a taste
that is not to be despised in the matter
of fhansserie, and the committee have
done well to go to them for their designs
for this all-important department of
military clothing. IB not the new button
boot, with patent kid golosh, of most
attractive ligne? It has a well-cut heel,
specially worthy of praise in that it
maintains a graceful outline for the foot
without being in the least fatiguing on
the longest march, as a heel of narrower
proportions is apt to be. Especially to
be commended, too, are the latest evening
shoes, in glace kid with straps and
plain silver buckles. Worn with the
regulation openwork stockings they will
look unutterably modish.
Next week there is to be a really
enthralling display of the latest things
in military headgear at the house of
Messrs. CUTTER AND CAPP, the well-known
firm of military outfitters. The un-
popular service cap has now been re-
placed by a very fetching toque in
Parsifal blue or Duck's-egg green cloth,
with a chou of satin and a prettily
curved quill, just imported from la ville
lum'iere. Another captivating design is
a hat in brown glace ruched in squares,
each square being finished with a wee
velvet button. Raised on the head by
means of a bandeau of green velvet it
should prove a most practical and
becoming genre.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
MAJOR.—We think you are very sensi-
ble to make your new uniform at home;
it will certainly come far cheaper in the
end. We can supply you with a paper
pattern for 6s. Id., post free, stamps with
order. You need not fear any difficulty
with the kiltings. If, as you say, your
wife has a new machine it will turn them
out quite easily, or they will be made by
any one who does pinking, &c., for a few
pence.
BRIGADIER-GENERAL.—We quite under-
stand from what you tell us that the
Dahlias and new Titian reds in your full-
dress uniform do not go well with your
complexion. As you intend to be in
town for the next few days, we should
strongly advise you to try a course of
Mrs. BLENKINSOP'S complexion treatment,
which will effectively dissipate the rough-
ness you complain of. When you return
to camp, yoii should take with you her
special "Beauty Chest," containing a tin
of Ijly cream, powder, peach bloom, lip
salve, powder-puff, pencil, and a bottle
of sunburn lotion. The price is only
five guineas, and it is well worth the
moner.

MY COMEDY.
FAR from the loud and madding scene
Where trippers make high holiday,
0 Header, I have lately been
In silent travail of a Play;
A Comedy, which ought to run
For months— if I could get it done.
My plot is in the last, degree
Funny; the stage lias seldom heard
.Such wit, such brilliant repartee.
I 've done two Acts and half the
Third—
But, through a startling oversight,
1 cannot get the climax right.
You seo my leading lady, Z.,
Is wooed by X. (a knightly soul,
Whose qualities of heart and head
Acclaim him for a hero's role),
And Y. (a purely minor swain),
Who I proposed should love in vain.
Now, as at first the plot was hatched,
Z. would have sealed a lifelong bond
With X. (to whom I 'm much attached);
And Y. (of whom I wasn't fond)
Would, by his agonies, emit
Some homely pathos for the Pit.
But Y'., though otherwise designed,
Has, burgeoned slowly from the start
Into the noblest of his kind.
With qualities of head and heart
That give him quite an equal claim
With that of X. to win the game.
And thus the basis of my plot
Has at the climax fallen through : —
[ have tiro heroes now—there 's not
A pin to choose between the two —
And, «« my hero, one must, win
The hand of Z., my heroine.
But, which? Were X. to gain his poin,t,
The Public taste would never bear
His putting Y.'s nose out of joint,
Which plainly settles liix affair!
Nor can 1 let the lady go
To Y., for that would spoil the Show!
That does for Y. In point of fact
It also seems to do for Z.!
And as in my concluding Act
I cannot let her go unwed,
It does for me! Which simply means
That everything's in smithereens.
It seems an obvious resource
To introduce a second bride
(Z.'s peer, in all respects, of course),
And thus get all the three supplied.
Or, failing that, to choose one's man
And kill him, seems the only plan.
But Z. " there is none like her, none!"
Z. is the concentrated blend
Of all I 've ever loved, in one!
And though, no doubt, the sudden end
Of X. (or Y.) would solve the hitch,
Still there 's the old conundrum -
Which?
0 Reader, I would have you muse
On this obstructive point of mine,
And, if you find a likely ruse,
Don't hesitate to send a line!
This is a Play that ought to bring
In pounds—if I could end the thing. DuM-Di'M.

"THE PRODIGY SON."
"' WLat a game it is !' said the elder Mr. Wetter, with, a chuckle.
'A reg'lar prodigy son !' "—Ptckiciek, chap. xv.
A DKURY Lane drama is supposed to demand, as essential
to its success, crowd and show, both, of which, in this present
instance, seem to be brought in only by way of concession
to tradition, as they could be entirely dispensed with, without
injury to, nay, rather to the advantage of, Mr. HALL CAINE'S
play entitled The Prodigal Son. The title is incorrect, as,
evidently, it should have been A Prodigal Son. "The"
Prodigal Son, strictly speaking (which would not have much
effect on the author of this drama), is definitely scriptural.
This play has little to do with scripture, except in the last
Act, where the prayer, offending not a few, and the reading
of the Bible, should have been altogether omitted.
It is the story of two brothers, Magnus Stephensson (Mr.
FRANK COOPER), and Oscar Stephensson (Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER)
in love with the same girl, Thorn Neilsen (Miss LILY HALL
CAINE), Magnus, the elder of the pair, sacrificing himself for
the sake of Thora's happiness, and getting himself very gene-
rally disliked by his decidedly objectionable way of doing it.
Oscar, married to Thorn, falls in love with his wife's
wicked sister Helga (Miss NANCY PRICE), with whom, after
he has ruined his father, Stephen Magnusson (in which
character Mr. HENRY NEVILLE appears in full uniform as
Governor-General of Iceland), broken his mother Anna's (Miss
MARY RORKE) heart, and been the immediate cause of his
wife's death in her confinement, Oscar goes away for five
years. At the expiration of this period, we find Oscar and
Helga together in one of Tom Tiddler's grounds, i.e. Monte
Carlo, where, after a course of gambling and finally cheat-
ing, an awakened conscience causes its wobbling possessor,
Oscar, to break the chain that binds him to Hetya at once
and for ever. An immorally reasoning Mephistophelian
medical man, Doctor Olsen (Mr. LUIQI LABLAGHE), much inter-
ested in the prodigal, prescribes suicide for Oscar. But when
Oscar positively rejects this strong remedy, the Doctor,
inspired by a "happy thought," discharges the pistol, pockets
it, and calmly announces to the inquiring public that Oscar
has committed suicide. As such an event need not stop the
merriment of the evening the bal masque proceeds, while
Oscar—about whom as to " Where he goes Or how he fares
Nobody knows and Nobody cares,"—makes a moonlight
flitting.
Ten years elapse. Oscar, under the name of Christian
Christiansen, has not only become a world-famous poet, but
has also made a colossal fortune by his work! Here, indeed,
is The Prodigy Son! TJie Prodigal has become The Prodigy.
He returns home kden with money; nobody recognises him
as Oscar; and, to put it shortly, after making every one
happy, he is quitting his native land, when he is brought
back by his brother, is welcomed by his mother, embraced
by his daughter, who, not being the exceptionally wise child,
does not know her own father when she sees him, and at
the descent of the final curtain, it is to be inferred that
Oscar, surrounded by this family circle, lives happily ever
afterwards.
Now this is a drama without a sensation scene. What is
wanted in "sensation" is supplied by tableaux, and by music
in the orchestra furnished and conducted by Mr. J. M. GLOVER
with all his usual energetic sympathy. But "sensation"
is not missed when we have siich excellent acting as is
given us by Mr. FRANK COOPER impersonating the rough,
honest, kindly brother, who is the real hero of the piece; by
Miss MARY RORKE as the unobtrusive, affectionate mother;
and by Mr. HENRY NEVILLE as the expansive Governor-
General of Iceland, bearing himself as bravely as if he were
a warrior of fifty, and looking some ten years younger than
either of his sons.
Mrs. JOHN WOOD, a hostees in herself, supplies all the light
and low comedy there is in the piece. She is wonderful.
Risky sentences and words can be put into her mouth, and
can come out of it, not only with safety, but so uttered as to
compel the heartiest laughter and applause from a house
crowded in every part. In this piece we have an example of
a casus belli in an epigrammatic speech which from the lips
of any other living actress would have led to a row in the
house, perhaps even to an Old Drury riot. The part is com-
paratively small, but every line tells; they are the author's
best, and Mrs. WOOD gives them inimitably. But for her the
play would be sombre.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER plays the repellant part of Oscar,
and carries it through triumphantly. But does he think he is
so changed after fifteen years' absence that no one will know
him in the last Act? Why, his Oscar returns home rather
more like himself than ever! He is at once recognised by the
entire audience, while his mother and his brother have not
the slightest idea of his identity! The Returned Prodigal
ought to be absolutely unrecognisable.
The part of Helga falls to Miss NANCY PRICE, but it cannot
be reckoned among her successes. Miss LILY HALL CAINE is
effective, perhaps sufficiently so, as the gentle Tliora; but that
she should afterwards appear as Elin, Thora's daughter,
seems, as such an arrangement generally does, a dramatic
mistake. She does it prettily enough.
The scenery by Messrs. McCLEERY, EMDEN, and BRUCE SMITH,
is strikingly effective. The play lias made a hit, and Old
Drury is sure to be full up every night until the arrival of
King Pantomime. "He may call himself CAINE," says Mr.
ARTH-R C-LL-NS, " but as a dramatist he is 'able.'"
NATURE STUDIES.
HARPER'S MONTHLY MAGAZINE."
I HAVE come to the conclusion that no good reason exists
why such products of human nature and human activity as
are in their essence not merely alive but also susceptible of
change and development should not occasionally be included
in this series. The supply of animals faithfully studied and
intimately known to me, though it is not exhausted, is yet
strictly limited. I propose, therefore, to vary their descrip-
tion by that of an American periodical which has been for
many years the pleasant companion of my leisure.
I shall not investigate the question of this great magazine's
origin. It suffices for me that it exists and has achieved its
six hundred and sixty-fourth number. A division by twelve
in the approved method results by way of quotient in the
surprising knowledge that it is now in its fifty-sixth year.
If fifteen years was grande mortalis ceri sjxitium, what shall
be said of fifty-six?—especially when it is remembered that
these fifty-six cover the most stirring and fruitful period in
the history of the American Republic. Before ABRAHAM LIN-
COLN was heard of Harper's Monthly existed; it passed
through the great Secession struggle; witnessed the recon-
struction period; flourished under the Presidencies of GRANT,
and now lives vigorously in the mild and magnificent eye
(to say nothing of the pince-nez and the flashing teeth) of
THEODORE ROOSEVELT. It is a considerable record of mere
existence, a brilliant one when the distinguished merits that
have marked that existence are taken into account. Long
may it continue to instruct, to interest, and to amuse!
Let me, however, proceed to consider some of the elements
that go to the making up of my companion's character.
There is Mr. W. D. HOWELLS, novelist, essayist, man of the
world—nihil tetigit quod non ornavit. He was once—I think
my memory serves me right; I know I have been told that
the penalties its lapses entail do so —he was once the editor
of Harper's Monthly, and he still illuminates its columns. He
has been writing in it about London and England, writing

with a grace, a peculiar charm, a vivid-
ness and a lightness both of touch and
of fancy that would have conferred dis-
tinction upon the most brilliant magazine
that even the rapt imagination of one of
Harper's own poetesses could conceive
in a moment of supreme exaltation.
Besides, he is so reasonable and sane and
human; shakes you by the hand (I speak
in a literary sense) and links his arm in
yours just as if yon were the one friend
he had been looking for through the wide
world, and away you go with him on a
voyage of delightful discovery through
the murky streets of London or the hazy
landscape of rural England. There never
was so pleasant a guide or one who made
you see so clearly and feel so keenly all
the queer and fascinating beauties of our
great city and our mother land. Hats
off to Mr. W. D. HOWELLS!
I wonder if I am right in my convic-
tion, carefully acquired from a perusal
of Harper's pages, that all American
poetesses own the name of JOSEPHINE?
I cannot remember when the light of
this knowledge first burst upon me, but
now I hold it as an article of faith. It
is a pretty name, obviously an American
development of SAPPHO, and any poetess
might be proud to be called by it even
if American poetesses had not set the
fashion in Harper's Magazine. Disguise
in this matter is useless. It may happen
that now and then one of Harper'»
poetesses tries to pass herself off as
ETIIZL or LOUISE or even as MARY or
ALICE; but I know well enough that
this is mere paltering and play. In
sober earnest and in their poetical work-
shops they are all, without exception,
JOSEPHINES.
Nothing in all Harper s strikes the
heavy-minded Englishman with a greater
astonishment than the extraordinary
mass and variety of American women
who write stories. I take up my Harper
for September and I find stories by ABBEY
MF.GUIRE ROACH, ANNIE HAMILTON DONNEI.I,
OLIVIA HOWARD DUNBAB, MARY R. S.
ANDREWS, and MARY VAN VORST. From
this list it will be seen, by the way, that
if you happen to be a woman and want
to write stories for Harper s, the rule is—
Miss VAN VORST is not really an excep-
tion because the VAN ought to count—
that you must have at least three names.
Miss ANDREWS has four, but then she
doesn't print them all in full as the
trinominalones do. Another sound rule
is that your short story must have a
HENRY JAMES feeling about it. It must
read as if it was not absolutely complete
in itself, but had in reality been extracted
from a longer story, or even from a
novel. The reader is not told anything
about the characters; he is violently
flung at their heads, without the sem-
blance of an introduction, and is expected
to know all about them and to take the

deepest possible interest in their varia-
tions of feeling or caprice. It's a little
puzzling at first to come upon a story ('tis
an effort of fancy, not an actual quotation
from Harper's) that begins something
after the following fashion : — " Tuesday
morning found Sigsbee still wearily en-
gaged upon the old business. His look
travelled from the waste of chimneys on
which his window opened to a vagrant
curl trailing coquettishly down the
back of Helen's neck. He sighed
and pushed the papers from him."
Mechanically your hand turns the
leaves back so that you may discover
the origins of these people, but it's
quite useless. That is how the story
starts, and you must take it or leave it
at that.
A truce, however, to jesting. I know
I wish September would hurry along so
that I might get the six hundred and
sixty-fifth number of Harper « and seek
relaxation in its pages—and that is about
the best compliment I can pay my old
friend.

Some catholicity of taste,
For Music is to me a name
For anything that can be faced.
Like everybody else I know
I find it thrills me to the quick
To hear an oratorio
Or listen to a KUBF.LIK;

In that I am extremely fond
Of things that don't appeal to most.
I simply love a German band;
I cannot, think why people write
To curse the enterprising land
That sends these spirits of delight. [

That reach us through the party wall,
And really why my wife complains
I never can make out at all.
And yet, and yet, I must confess
My sympathy knows certain bounds;
My ears just now are in duress
To two quite independent sounds.
The time has deflected my song,
The clash has affected my nerves;
To start this new metre was wrong,
But the change in emergency serves.

have culminated in so splendid a success,"
should send him a picture post-card

President ROOSEVELT'S repeated exhorta-

epidemic of bigamy has broken out, and
it may become necessary for the PRESI-

The doctors and warders at Carmarthen
Prison have been much puzzled to decide
whether a German prisoner there, who
remains as motionless as a statue, is
shamming, or is the victim of a strange

neither. He is merely attempting to
cnrry out the instructions given to his
countrymen in the Baltic to be dignified
in the presence of Englishmen.

a foozle the hymn will be sung with
extraordinary vigour in order to drown

All the cats in the town of Frankfort,

I ROSE at dawn. The silent leas
Were dressed in dewy spangles,
A pleasant breeze bestirred the trees
(Important when one angles).
I waded out into the stream,
By yellow pool and torrent,
And falls that gleam like curdled cream
(Whose chill was most abhorrent).
Smiling to think (the crisis past)
Of sluggards on their pillows,
I raised my cast and cauglit it fast
Upon some hanging willows;
My buoyant hope some fathoms sank;
It was a bright beginning,
Yet up the bank through rushes dank
I bravely started shinning.
I freed the gut (the branches tied
Long arms around my shoulder),
Then stepping wide sat down and tried
Conclusions with a boulder.

They 'd slipped across some slimy moss,
Would not be so effusive.)

I mopped my streaming features;

Once more I cleared the creatures;

For hours the " finny nations"
Unheeding swam; they cared no whit—
For worthless imitations.
Then poising on some sharpish rocks,
And 'ware that winged legions
From shirt to socks devoured in flocks
My more unguarded regions,
I said, "You too might seek a meal;"
I did, and lo! the hand which
With sanguine zeal explored my creel
Came back without a sandwich.
What had I done to suffer so?
I rose and flogged the water;
The sun grew low; I would not go;
I felt the lust of slaughter:
Onward I splashed with sodden soles
And saturated uppers,
While startled voles resumed their holes,
And went without their suppers.
Then, as the sinking daylight sought
Its screen of mountain ridges,
And Evening brought, her mood of
thought
Accompanied by midges,
I rose at last a tardy trout,
(I never threw so neatly)
Two pounds no doubt—I grazed his snout
And missed the brute completely!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GEORGE AGAIN.
EXTRACT FROM THE RECESS DlARY OF ToBY, M.P.
Ambleside, Monday.—I made GEORGE'S
acquaintance when last at Windermere,
two years ago. Entry made at the time
in this Diary of his strange experiences
and his wise sayings; how out in stormy
seas by Morecambe Bay his sole com-
panion in the fishing lugger was washed
overboard; how sometime later GEORGE,
mastering his emotion at loss of a
cherished companion, characteristically
resumed business operations; how, haul-
ing up the net, he was cheered by its
unaccustomed weight; how his thoughts
turned sadly to his lost mate and his foun-
dered opportunity of sharing in the pro-
ceeds of the haul; how with herculean
effort he landed the net on the deck, and
behold! enmeshed in it was the lost
JIM, apparently, like DOUGLAS GORDON,
"drownded in the sea."
Always practical, GEORGE laid his prize
out on the deck and proceeded, in accord-
ance with familiar directions, to "bring
him round." So vigorously did he carry-
on the process, that the hapless JIM spent
the succeeding fortnight in hospital,
victim of a fractured rib. When GEORGE
undertakes to do a particular job he does
it thoroughly. But on reflection JIM
prefers being drowned.
A born seaman, with long lineage of
sailor forbears, GEORGE is never so happy
as when aboard his lugger under a stiff
breeze off Morecambe, or on the Anita
in the changing circumstance of Winder-
mere winds, which blow where they list
without notice of sudden, frequent,
change. Single-handed he controls the
buoyant boat, as a skilled rider sits and
guides a restive thoroughbred. GEORGE
admits that the master, as becomes the
Vice-Commodore of the Yachting Club,
can handle a boat in any weather. But
he laments a tendency on his part to
share his affection with the Phantom, a
commodious steam-launch, which upon
hospitable occasion has been known to
accommodate forty guests.
On Sunday mornings the Vice-Commo-
dore is accustomed to go about "making
a collection" in quite new fashion. It
is a far cry by road from Ambleside and
Lowood to Wray Church. As the crow
—or rather the seagull —flies across the
Lake it is, by steam-launch, a ten-minute
voyage. So the Vice-Commodore, always
intent on doing kind things, sets out
early on Sunday morning in the Phantom,
"collects " friends and neighbours wait-
ing at their various private landing-
places, and delivers them, carriage unpaid,
at the pier by Wray Castle.
That is very well in its way. Still
GEORGE is constrained to admit that he
"doesn't think much of them lanches.''
In idle moments he has estimated the
amount of coal the Phantom burns in a
day. It is really ruinous. Becomes
monstrous when contrasted with the
absolute freedom from analogous charges
enjoyed by the fleet-footed Anita. Then
there is steering the launch. GEORGE can
take the Anita up to any pierhead or any
boat or buoy afloat, almost without ne-
cessity of using the boat-hook. But there
are two to work in "them lanches "—
the blue-jacket at the tiller, the engineer
in charge of the engine. Just as the
tiller is touched with sure intent of
bringing the launch alongside, the
engine either forger ahead or gives a
stroke astern, and where are you?
GEORGE still leads a dual life, both
phases full of strenuous work sedulously
performed. When the yachting season
is over at Windermere he tacks back to
Morecambe Bay, ready to put out in all
kinds of weather, a-fishiug in his own
little lugger. If there were room for a
glimmer of conceit in this shrewd, simple
nature, it would betray itself in reference
to the fact that the seasons have r.o
influence upon his sartorial habits.
Summer and winter, in sunshine or
snow, he wears the same clothes—trousers
of rough pilot cloth and "a jarsey"
usually spelt jersey). In these, with con-
tented mind and healthy body, he fronts
any fortune the revolving seasons bring.
GEORGE more or less gratefully accepts
whatever gifts the sea may yield to his
net—including, as we have seen, an
occasional half-drowned mate. His
speciality is shrimps. He will take
prawns if they come. But, to be quite
frank, "give him srimps." With
characteristic loyalty he holds the opinion
that no shrimp caught in any sea can
compare with your real Morecambe Bay
native. That this is not, prejudice is
established by the fact that the brand
commands the market, bringing pennies
a quart above the price of meaner
brethren.
And here comes the rub. Germany
steps in and robs the Bay fishermen of
the fruits of their patrimony. Of course
Germans may not fish in Morecambe
Bay. But they have in or near their
own coasts a thing they, in their own
language, presumptuously call a shrimp.
This they pot and send over to England,
where it is feloniously labelled " More-
cambe Bay Shrimps," and by the unwary
is entertained as such.
The consequence is seen in reduction
of price of the real article. Time was,
and yet lingers in GEORGE'S glowing
memory, when a quart of vrai More-
cambe Bay shelled shrimps brought
half-a-crown. Now a pampered middle-
man proffers eighteenpence. You may
take it or leave it. Shrimps flourish
in the waters of Morecambe Bay; but
they are also "made in Germany."
Whether it be due to patriotic tenacity
in holding on to office displayed by Mr.
BALFOUR and his Ministerial colleagues,
or whether it be apprehension as to
what may follow upon the apparently
inevitable succession to office of C. 11.,
are matters GEORGE does not discuss.
The fact remains that the fishing business
is not what it used to be. He remem-
bers hearing his grandfather relate how
it was his custom of an afternoon to put
out a few miles to sea, casually spread
his net, and bring it up " full of herrin's."
Now there isn't a herring within hail of
Morecambe.
The profits of sail-making, adjunct to
the income of sturdy fisher-folk, have
also gruesomely fallen off. Moreover,
German competition affecting the sale of
shrimps adversely influences the business
of shelling undertaken by female mem-
bers of the family. This reflection brings
to GEORGE memories of his mother. He
speaks of her with the tenderest affec-
tion. But his port uplifts, his honest
eyes gleam with pride, when he recalls
how she could in an hour shell more
shrimps than any woman dwelling by
the Bay.
THE YOUNG IDEA.

AN advertisement recently put in the
Glasgow Herald asking for a Lid who
could write shorthand and manipulate
the typewriter, produced the following
reply :—" I notice your advertisement in

can I manipulate the typewriter, but
at the interview which I am sure you

paper to
submit its contents to the nation; though
we have been compelled, owing to the
broken and defaced character of the
tablet, to tell its story in our own words
rather than in a literal and unintelligible
translation of the actual narrative.
As far as we can make out, it was
called "The History of Our Own
Times," and -was published on the
instalment system. The author's name,
apparently written in French, is almost
obliterated, but seems to have been
something like "HE-OF-THE-RED-HILL,"
which is probably a nom de plume, and
merely intended to convey the fact that
FORGOTTEN HISTORY.
THE STORY OF HE-OF-THE-OPEN-MIXD.
"THE past," as Miss MARIE CORELLI
has so truthfully and epigrammatically
expressed it, "is past;" and we often
fail to realise how much we owe to our
forgotten ancestors. We are far too
ready to attribute to modern ingenuity
the invention of our more successful
modern institutions, many of which can
trace their origin right back to what
the Poet [Laureate has so magnificently
called "the dawn of History." Our
present system of government, for in-
stance, which is universally admitted
in England to be the best in
the world, is not by any
means the mushroom edifice,
founded on the Magna Charta,
that most people suppose it
to be. Recent discoveries in
the neighbourhood of Totten-
ham Court Road, where con-
siderable excavations have
lately been taking place, have
brought to light some inter-
esting antiquarian knowledge,
which lias shown us that the
Mritish Constitution is, com-
paratively speaking, in its
dotage.
The discoveries were made
in ii most romantic manner,
fully in keeping with the
sensational character of their
revelations, for about two
and a-half years several hun-
dred workmen had been use-
fully employed in tearing
up the roadway opposite
the Horseshoe Hotel. They
had already reached the
depth of some six feet, when
work was temporarily sus-
pended, owing to the fact
that they had apparently
struck a layer of exceedingly
hard soil, the removal of'
which would have entailed such tremen-' he was not far off being a "bright "un."

Voice from the MM. "Now THEX, TOD TOtxo COWARD, DON'T STAND
ABOUT ALL DAY. \VjIY DON'T YOU TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE DOO?"
dons exertion, that those in authority
scarcely felt justified in continuing the
work. By a fortunate inspiration, how-
ever, Mr. BRODRICK was consulted as to
the best means of removing the obstinate
impediment; and with a couple of
happily-worded telegrams he succeeded
in dislodging it. It proved to be a
large slab of exceedingly hard material,
probably brick or early English bread,
covered with strange hieroglyphics bear-
ing a remote resemblance to figures.
At first sight it was mistaken for some
form of old-fashioned bank pass-book;
but the antiquarian authorities at the
British Museum, to whom it was sub-
mitted, declared it to be nothing more
or less than an authentic history of the
British Constitution between the years
The narrative starts with a brief but
illuminating treatise upon the nature of
the British Constitution at that time;
showing that our present form of
government is practically the same as
that which flourished in Great Britain
over 20,000 years before the birth of
Mr. HALL C-AISE. In the poignant query
of that great author himself: "What is
time, when compared with eternity?"
The government of the country ap-
pears to have been carried on in two
House of Wrong - 'uns, however, was
thoroughly representative of the nation,
its members being returned by public
election every seven years. Each district
was supposed to select the most danger-
ous criminal in its area, and he was then
sentenced to seven years' hard labour in
the House of Wrong-'uns; at the end
of which period, if he was still alive, his
capacity for wrong-doing was practically
exhausted. The idea underlying this
scheme was extremely ingenious; for
law breaking, both active and passive,
was then the most popular sport in the
country, so it was obvious that if the
laws were bad, as they invariably were,
owing to the character of the legislators, the fact that they were invari-
ably broken kept the country in
a thoroughly satisfactory con-
dition.
Roughly speaking, the
modern idea of party govern-
ment was in force: that is to
say, the more numerous and
better armed party held control
of the public finances under the
leadership of the most powerful
member of the assembly, who
was known as the Prime Mon-
ster. The debates were pre-
sided over by an official called
The Squeaker, whose duties
consisted of calling " Time" be-
tween the different rounds. He
maintained his authority by the
possession of what was known
asthe casting vote—a largeand
carefully sharpened flint jave-
lin, which he cast with almost
unerring aim at anyone who
ventured to question his ruling.
From the rare occasions on
which he missed probably
arose the phrase "A near
squeak."
The Prime Monster, at the
period with which the tablet
deals, was a distinguished
statesman known as HE-OF-THE-
. His designation, however, in
follytricks, which was the name by which
Parliamentary affairs were generally
described, was the Right Horrible ARTFI i.
BAFFI.F.R, a complimentary title bestowed
on him as a tribute to his extraordinary
power of dodging the Squeaker's javelin
and evading the well-aimed weapons of
the Opposition. The latter were under
the control of HB-WBO-CASBIED-THX-FUO,
a distinguished orator who wielded
enormous power in the country owing to
his popularity with the Army, and bore
large caves, known respectively as " The I the honoured cognomen of Sir CANWELL-
SHAMAMAN. So he could too, upon occa-
sion, but not well enough to deceive the
Right Hor. ARTFUL BAFFLER. In fact, as
time went on, the Prime Monster became
so powerful that he even aroused the
jealousy of his own side, a large portion

of Frauds." The latter, as far as we
can make out, seems to have been a kind
of charitable institution for people who
would probably have starved to death if
compelled to work for their living. The

of whom rebelled against his authority
under the leadership of HE-OF-THE-GLASS-
EYE. The latter was an ambitious chief-
tain, who believed firmly in the motto,
"Nothing venture, nothing win"; so
the tactics which he and his friends
adopted to destroy the power of the
Prime Monster were popularly known as
the " Riskall Follycy." As far as we can
learn from the tablet, it consisted of a
determined attempt to keep out the
supply of immigrants, furs, and flint
instruments, which were being imported
from Germany by the Anglo-Saxons;
for, as HE-OF-THE-GLASS-EYE was never
tired of pointing out, that race were a
miserable set of foreigners who had no

A GREAT LITERARY MYSTERY.
SPECUI.ATION is still riotously rife in literary circles as to
the meaning of Carniola, the title chosen by Mr. WATTS-
DUNTON for his famous new forthcoming romance, and our
representative, on calling at the Authors' Club last Saturday,
found that the premises had been open night and day for
the last week to enable a debate on the subject to proceed
continuously.
Dr. ROBERTSON NICOLL, who was intercepted by our repre-
sentative just as he was starting to catch the Flying Scotch-
man, courteously granted a few words of illuminative
comment on the great question of the day. "Carniola,"
he said, "is not and has nothing to do with any form of
extract of meat. My theory is this I give it you for what
it is wortli that this word is an anagram for Craniola, i.e.
little craniums, and affords a clue to the contents, which
will, I believe, turn out to be a scathing satire on the
epidemic of swellod-hcad from which so many politicians,
publicists, and theologians are now suffering. The only
thing that causes me to waver in this interpretation is that
the fishermen of the east coast of Scotland measure
herrings by the 'crau,' from which it may be deduced
that the romance will have a decidedly briny flavour, and
that the scene will be laid at Aberdeen, Peterhead, Burghead,
or possibly Lossiemouth, where Mr. Asquint lias recently
been playing golf. 'lola,' 1 incline to think, will prove to
be the euphonious name of the heroine, a fisher lassie of
extraordinary fascinations and supra-Borrovian bonhomie."
Mr. HENRY NORMAN, M.P., who had driven up in his
motor-car from his constituency to join in the debate, had
not the slightest hesitation about the solution of this great
cosmic riddle. ''Dr. ROBERTSON Xiroix," he observed, "was
on the right scent when he said that the word was an
anagram, but he has rearranged the letters wrongly. Car-
niola — why it simply leaps to the eyes—is simply '-An oil
car!' The romance, I have not the slightest doubt, will
prove to be the most splendid apotheosis of the motoring
industry that has yet been perpetrated."
Mr. C. K. SHORTER, also adhering to the anagram theory,
expressed his belief that Carniola = Calinora, i.e., beautiful
XORA, and that the heroine would prove to be of Irish
extraction, "unless, indeed," added Mr. SHORTER, "we are
to rearrange the letters 'Lira cano,' 'i.e., '0 lyre, I sing,'
or possibly 'Cara Nilo,' which would of course suggest an
Egyptian atmosphere, with a background of pyramids,
donkey-boys and similar amenities."
Meantime we are assured that "Carniola" soap, an
exquisitely super-fatted variety of toilet detergent, and
calculated not to irritate even the most delicate and sensitive
skins, will shortly be put on the market in myriads of
fragrant tablets.
THERE were once two young fellows of Cambridge,
Who too freely indulged in that game, Bridge,
And lost all their cash;
But they made a good splash

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"MANY Englishmen have travelled in Holland, and have
set down the record of their experiences. But the country
has not been inspiring, and Dutch travels are poor reading."
Thus Mr. E. V. LUCAS in one of his thoughtful asides. A
Wanderer in Holland (METHUEN) has broken the record,
removed the reproach. My Baronite has not for a long time
read a*more delightful book. Many passages recall the style
of Mr. LUCAS'S revered master, CHARLES LAMB. To be precise
it is an amalgam of Elia and the modern special corre-
spondent in search 'of human character and local colour.
Accompanying the Wanderer by barge and train, the reader
insensibly acquires vivid impressions of oiir ancient enemy
the Dutch, and of the country ANDREW MARVELL savagely
desrrilied as
Holland tlial scarce deserves the lunue «[ land,
As but ih' offscouring of the British sand,
And so much earth as was contributed
By English pilots when they heaved the lead;
Or what by (wean's slow alluvion fell
Of shipwract cockle and the muscle shell.
Tlu>. picture galleries have special attraction for the Wanderer-
who not only discourses on their treasures but adds value
to his volume by reproducing by photogravure thirty-four
masterpieces. Having read all that has been written about
Holland, Mr. LUCAS boldly, with happy effect, annexes pas-
sages from MoTiJiY and others which cause to live again
historic episodes relating to the town in which he chances to
be sojourning. Holland is an ancient country, rich in historic
associations. The Wanderer has added to it a new charm.
In Alton of Somasco (,loHN Loxu) Mr. HAROJJ) BINDLOSS has
given us a striking romance. The protagonist is a fine
manly character, intrepid, straightforward, generous; of
rough material to bo softened by love, and to be planed
by civilised society. The perilous situations in which he,
with a few devoted friends, finds himself, are admirably
described. The gradual development of the best qualities
in the heroine, Alice Derinnham, a girl who in her first
phase is quite unworthy to be the wife of Alton of Somasro,
is cleverly worked out, although the result, is not convincing,
as the future of so radically selfish and essentially vain a
woman as is Alice, when she be-
comes the wife of this genuinely
honest man, is a problem which
only the author, in a continua-
tion of their story on their
return as landed proprietors
to England, might satisfac-
torily solve. There are faults in
style to which it is needless
to draw attention when recom-
mending, as the Baron heartily
does, this story as a power-
fully written and thoroughly
interesting romance.

MILLIONAIRES AT BAY.
[" Talking of his next book, Mr. HAIX CAISE, who sailed for America
on Saturday, said that, as on previous American trips he had made a
study of the life of the American millionaire and the problems which
bosKt him, it would in all probability deal with the great commercial
rulers of America."—Evening Standard.]
MR. YERKES, who was caught by our representative just
as he was on the point of descending into the Baker Street
and Waterloo Tube, said that he had decided, on hearing of
Mr. HALL CAINE'S plans, to remain in England until the
danger was past. If on the gifted Manxman's return any
assaults were made on him for fictional purposes, the million-
aire proposed to retire permanently into a C'AiNE-proof subter-
ranean cell which was being excavated for him at that
moment. He had always, he added, maintained that the joys
and privileges of the millionaire's life were greatly overrated,
but lie had never been believed. He should now expect to be
taken at his word.
Mr. J. D. ROCKEFELLER, who was interviewed in his new
grey wig, said that he doubted if Mr. HALL CUNT, would get
much change out of him. He had not spent a long and not
wholly unsuccessful life among oil and oilers for nothing.
Mr. PIERPOXT MORGAN declined to be interviewed; but his
chief office-boy, a gentleman of the highest position in New
York financial circles, and himself the owner of one of the
finest estates on the banks of the Hudson, pointed signifi-
cantly to the Cold Storage chamber where the less welcome of
Mr. MORGAN'S callers were kept waiting—sometimes for
several weeks. "I hope Mr. C.UNE lias brought his Iceland
sheepskin with him," he said. "He will want it."
Mr. W. W. ASTOU was also invisible, but the seneschal of
Hever Castle, acting as his representative, gave some inte-
resting information as to Mr. ASTOU'S feelings on the subject.
"Mr. HALL CAINE'S plan of campaign," quoth the seneschal,
a fine commanding figure of a man, sanguine and loose-
limbed, clad in a flame-hued tabard with a mangonel slung
across his strapping shoulders, "maketh it clear why my
master took up his abode in the old Motherland." Here
he drained a gigantic beer-horn and went on in a terrible
undertone, cracking his fingers and spluttering with
rage. "There be few oubliettes in America, when prying
varlets seek to worm themselves into the sacred privacy of a
noble's home. But at Hever, by Goles, there are fifty-three!"
And here he cut a gigantic caper, and, shouting "Loo, loo,
Vixen! Hue, hue, Brock! Hiiro, haro, Hall Caine!" and
other gross noises, withdrew to superintend the operations
of the 1,1*00 lackeys over whom he exercises plenary over-
lordship.
MOTOR NOTES OF THE FUTURE.
[" A young Swiss engineer is said to have succeeded in manufac-
turing a pair of stout boots, each of which is nothing more or less than
a miniature motor-car mounted on four wheels."—Krcning Standard.]
THE Motor-Boot, like the old-fashioned car which satisfied
our fathers, is gradually overcoming the absurd prejudices
with which it was first regarded. The opprobrious epithet
"Hoot-hog," which used to be hurled indiscriminately at all
Motorbootists, is now, we are glad to sec, very seldom heard.
People are at last awakening to the fact that the old unwieldy
c.ir with its complicated mechanism, its ungainly body, and
enormous wheels, must sooner or later disappear altogether
from our roads to make way for its successor. The Moboot,
as it is beginning to be called, has certainly come to stay.
The Eliminating Trials, we understand, will be held this
year in the Calf of Man. While the 'Pliit-cesi Panhard'
is undoubtedly the favourite at present, from what we have
seen of them, we are inclined to favour the 'Waukenphast-
Wolseley.'
The Andover magistrates are evidently determined to keep
up the evil reputation which their predecessors Avon among
the old-school of 'motorists' (how old-fashioned the term
sounds now !) Seventeen Mo-bootisU were mulcted yesterday
in sums amounting in the aggregate to £3f> 4x. C><1. for not
displaying their numbers in a prominent position.
We notice that the De Dion Bootong Co. is now introduc-
ing a novelty in the shape of elastic-sided "Mo-shoes" for
children. These tiny vehicles are in every respect equal in
quality and workmanship to their famous "Bootong Mo-
Boots," while the sparking-plug arrangement is admirably
adapted for those who will have to use it, being exceedingly
simple in its application. There is now no excuse for parents
to leave their children at home when going for short runs
into the country.
One effect of the unfortunate accident on the Ripley Road
(where a City gentleman skidded into and knocked over an
elderly lady), is a large increase in the number of police traps.
A Lancashire correspondent sends a timely warning alxjut
Bootle, where babies are being used by the constabulary as
bait for Mo-bootists.
MUSICAL COMEDY FOR VEGETARIANS.
[" M. ROSTAND, the author of (.'i/rano <1e Beryerac, announces a new
play for the winter in which all the characters are either to 1*> birds
or animals. M. CoQi'EUN is to lake the part of a bigdog."—The Taller.]
Mil. GEORGE EDWARDES, who is one of our most enterprising
Managers, intends, should it be required, to produce an
entirely new Musical Comedy during the winter season,
entitled The Wrench Jjca.no and the Spring Cabbage. All the
characters are to be named after the vegetable world, or
associated ideas.
There are to be two Acts. The first Scene is laid " three
feet under the earth," and we are told that Mr. EDMUND PAYNE
as Lug, a worm, has full scope for his wonderful powers. • The
Second Act, "The back garden of 4, Station Cottages, East
Margate," is to be perfectly beautiful. It is said that Mr.
GEORGE EDWAUDES has paid over £10,000 for this "set." We
are promised many surprises, and some very pretty numbers.
Miss GERTIE MILLAR as Birdie Qrounsel will sing a dainty
ditty called "The Canary is nipping me noir," which is sure
to be one of the songs of the season.
We are able to publish, for the first time, the probable

THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION IN SOUTH AFRICA.
[Speaking at Salisbury, Rhodesia, Professor Darwin told a story of a Johannesburg workman, who declined to pass an opinion upon the
merits of the British Association (which lie evidently took to be a Soccer Team), because, he said, he "had not yet seen them play." Wo
hear that the B. A., fired by this idea, got up a team and put in a little practice, but had to leave for home before a match could be arranged
against a local representative eleven.]
PAST AND PRESENT.
(To E. B. L.)
I WEXT last week to live again
My dim forgotten joy-days;
To find once more in Southwood Lane
The spirit of my boy-days.
I pierced the mists that roll between,
Shook off the years that load me,
And tried to fit the living scene
To what my memory showed me.
Far as my roving eye could reach
One villa flanked another.
Red-bricked, and each as like to each
As twin to twin-born brother.
With gates and doors and bells to ring,
And rooms for food or slumber,
They were alike in everything,
Except in name or number.
Upon my left I saw witli grief
The woods we used to play through;
The mighty trees so thick in leaf
They hardly let the day through.
Where once the undergrowth was dense.
And all was green disorder,
Each prim retreat now owned a fence.
And every path a border.
'Twas there we had a fight one day—
I know not why it started.
I know we hammered them, and they
Hit back, and then we parted.
Where WII.I.IK gained a battered face,
And I a blackened peeper,
Behold a neat and gravelled space,
Paraded by a keeper.
His staff, his coat of velveteen
Would much have changed our
greeting;
How mild and tistless would have been
That sanguinary meeting!
My brow had never been embossed,
Nor \V II.LIE'S nose been gory;
And all our schoolboy friends had lost
A most exciting story.
Close by the spot where we had bled
There rose a rustic chalet;
A scent of tea and buttered bread
Was wafted o'er the valley.
I know it would have wrung your heart,
You would have felt as I did,
To fee the place in every part
So resolutely tidied.
Well, well; I strolled along the road,
And scanned each undulation:
At every step some memory glowed
With foiuf anticipation.
And, as I dreamed and wandered on,
All modern sights had vanished;
The gaudy, whirring trains were gone,
And all the 'buses banished.
The villas were dissolved away;
The woods resumed their wildness;
On all the lonely landscape lay
Its ancient air of mildness.
And, oh, it made my soul rejoice,
And gave my dream consistence,
To think I heard our mother's voice
That called me in the distance.
A sudden shock unsealed my eyes—
My joy was evanescent—
For, lo, I stood by "Woodlands Rise"
And gazed on "Woodlands Crescent."
Clone was the magic of the spot
That drew my vagrant mind there;
The place itself I found, but not
The home 1 hoped to find there.
(lone, like a dome that melts in air
Before a genie's malice,
Like some thin bubble rainbow fair,
Was all our childhood's palace.
The shady lawns that felt our feet,
And heard our young carouses,
V\ ere turned into a dusty street
Between two tiers of houses.
The stables on the other side,
Whose guardians were our cronies,
Where light of heart we'd mount and
ride
Our friendly little ponies,
All, yielding to an equal rule.
By change were desecrated;
Six shops did business o'er the pool
Where erst we fished or skated.
This was no place for me; I burned
To leave it and be gone thence.
With moody brow my steps I turned,
And swiftly hurried on thence.
Yet, since I dreamed my dream that day,
Though cynic tongues may quiz it,
No power can take that joy away,
Or make me rue the visit. It. C. L.
AN account in the Gentlewoman of a
lieutenant's wedding at Didsbury con-
tains the passage—"Two submarines
brought up the rear of the bridal pro-
cession." This must be the most
thorough naval wedding on record.

[SEPTEMBER 27, 1905.
THE IMITABLE PERCY.
Hcing a humlile essay in tlic manner nf Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald's new "Life of Cliarla
Dickens."
Though SiiAKPi'EAKE, MII.TOS, JOHNSOS, SCOTT, j
none read,—
What matter? Boz says everything we need.
THE autobiographical character of the
works of the radiant and inimitable Boz
has never been properly appreciated.
Such was his Protean industry and
universality that he never invented any-
thing. Everything in his book liad
occurred in his own life. You remember,
for example, how Mr. PitJaciek lodges
int the'Goswell Road. Well, in one of
his long and piquant conversations with
me, of which however I forget so much,
I remember the veracious and companion-
able Boz remarking that he' himself
once thought of that' thoroughfare as a
good place, in which to live. Vo-b. .w/>.
Again, in Martin Chuzzlncit there is u
bird-fancier and barber named Sveedle-
pipe. I remember as if it 'were to-day
going into -the office of -All- the -Year
Bound, for which 1 wrote so many novels,
and finding the witty and delightful 15oz
fondling a pipe of Swedish manufacture
which had just been sent to him by
JESNY LIM>, the famous and engaging j
cantatrice. How reasonable to assume j
that therein lay the germ of the inunor- j
tal friend of young liailey! -I need not
multiply examples.
How well I recall that first red letter
gala night on which 1 was asked to meet
the ' amiable and ever-brilliant Boz!
Nothing is so firmly fixed in my memory
except the other occasions. On refer-
ring to my diary .1 find the entry, "At
last, at last, have I met the affectionate
and refreshing Boz. 1 have long been
the most valued contributor on his staff.
I have written novels for him with both
hands at once; * but never till to-day
have I seen him in what St. Paul calls
the flesh. How my heart beat, is beating
still." | My diary ends there, but I can
supply the rest from a vivid memory.
The amazing and bewildering Boz was
getting into a railway carriage at Belfast
and had thrown away his cigar at the
door".-, I rushed forward and picked it
up, and it is needless to say that ] have it
° One of these novels was christened by (he
ever-ready Bo/. Xercr Vortjotten, which i8, ]
consider, the finest title a book evei- had. It i
says so much.so emphatically. Hardli/-er?r\
Forgotten or Itcuifmbcreil A'oir nnd Then--hmv .
tamo these titles would be, aldiough, perhaps,
more accurate", for no one can continually keep
a thing in mind: there are moments when
eve.il I lose sight of the dazzling and electrical
Boz—compared with Never Forgotten. It is
still sold like hot cukes, and u prrfume has been
named after it.
f This is one of the curious paradoxical
phrases which even the best English writers
have to use now and then. But how absurd —
for if a heart is beati--' it be still?
still, set in a gold mount of my own
design, with a suitable inscription from
his own magic wand, i.e., pen. "Your
cigar end, Mr. DICKENS," 1 said. "You 're
welcome," said he. The ice was broken,
and I told him who I was. "Ah," he
said, in his rich burr, "one of my young
men. Come to Gadshill whenever you
can." It was the proudest moment of
my life. I can see him now as he stood
there, the most famous man in the world,
and shook hands with me, up and down.
Always showy, he was wearing clothes.
I recall distinctly my first visit to
Gadshill. There was a dinner party.
I went upstairs to dress and looked out
of the window as I buttoned my collar.
It was a snowy night, and I saw the
carriages coming to the house bringing
the guests. The quaint and hospitable
Boz's guests often drove to his house,
and invariably so on snowy nights. One
of these vehicles was the vicar's, Mr.
HIXULE'S. How'many novelists to-day,
in these degenerate times, entertain
vicars? But the humorous and tolerant
Boz had such" infinite variety. The
guests in their turn had their eyes
fixed on Bo/'s cheerful red curtains,
illuminated from within, and giving
promise of snug blazing fires and logs,
and maybe something to eat. For
Gadshill was none of your sham hospit-
able houses such as great authors now
dwell in. If you were aske'l to dinner
by the generous and tactful Boz you
were given some dinner.
Afterwards we had games. "Kiss in
the King," "Hunt the Slipper," and so
on. No one who was not there can
conceive of the motor force of the high-
spirited and divine Bo/ 011 such occasions,
lie was everywhere at once. Nowadays
there is not an author who will play
with or even notice his children or his
guests. But the superb and energetic
Boz was a man, not a mere writing
machine. How he threw himself into
the fun, how he joked and sang and
danced and mixed the punch! Great
nights, great nights! After the evening
was over we went to bed, for Gadshill
was an exceptional home.
To read the works of DICKENS with the
complete knowledge of his character and
habits that can come only from intimate
personal intercourse, which is my privi-
lege and, perhaps, mine alone, is to
convert one's life into a series of eye-
openers, so wonderful are the similarities
between the novels and our own times.
For not only did the inspired and
prophetic lk)Z draw exclusively from his
own experience, as I have shoirn, for the
incidents of his novels, but he was so
great and Titanic as to force Life to copy
him. Thus, how could there have been
at Woodbridge the inoperative unpro-
ductive author of my own name (but no
relation) had not Boz first invented
L'apti'ni Cnnlc? Again every day,
almost, the papers contain descriptions
of a fracas (as the Frencli say) with a
cabman, which could not be so had not
the creative and buoyant Boz shown the
way in the early chapters of the immortal
Pickwick.
I can see the gentle and convivial
Boz at this moment mixing a steaming
beverage. He was almost a wizard with
a ladle. I remember him making a
drink entirely from borage and water,
of which 1 partook very freely. Of the
night itself I remember nothing, nor
does my diary help me, but the next
morning I had a splitting headache.
How gay and raillery-full was the ever-
droll Boz as I sat at breakfast and ate
nothing !" What would you be like, my
boy," he said, "if there had been any-
thing stronger than borage in ft'!" I can
see him now, as he ate his own meal. The
brilliant and showy Boz used a knife
and fork and stirred his coffee with a
silver spoon. A delightful breakfast
; party it was! How many are gone
I now! I left early, and the ever-courteous
j and kindly Boz suspended his opera-
tions to accompany me to the door.
How condescending in one so great I
What literary man would do as much to-
day ?" Good bye! good live !" he cried.
I can hear him now, I can see him now.
as he stood there .framed in his piquant
porch. If he had lived until 1!)1:J he
would have been a hundred years old.
How nobly the gay and hilarious Box
used to come down sUiirs! I seem to
see him now descending in his own
inimitable fashion, with his hand on the
balustrade and putting one foot before
the other. O those nights at Gadshill!
There was a billiard table, and now and
then the resplendent and eccentric Buz
and I would play a game. 1 am FCC him
now as he chalked the cue as surely none
but he could, rubbing the chalk on the
little leather tip and then looking keenly
at the table with those wonderful eyes of
his seeing eyes to decide which ball
he would aim at. He was a fair player.
Gadshill was indeed a home. It is
now a shrine for English and American
pilgrims from all over the world. Never
shall I forget my first visit to the house,
with its rubicund exterior and piquant
cupola. It was midsummer, and the
ever-friendly and galvanic Boz insisted
on my seeing the chalet. "No shilly-
shallyingabout this," ] remember saying,
and the joke pleased him.- He repeated
it at dinner; not, as some literary men
would have done, as his own, but giving
me the cre'dit, such was his bountiful
and self-sacrificing nature.

LILLIAN.
IT.—HER DisciRAOErn. STRATAGEM.
EVERT year Miss MALLEY'S XI. plays
Mr. BOODLE'S XI. on the Bcx>dle Ashurst
ground. (" Miss MALLEY" is what Mr.
BOODLE and many other people call
LILLIAN.) Every year SOMERS and I help
LILLIAN choose her team. (SosiER-s is the
doctor's son, and howls long-hops with
his left hand. I am sorry for all these
brackets, hut. there are some tilings that
have to he explained, and I think SOMEKS'
howling is one.)
This year I he committee sat on LILLIAN'S
lawn, and said hard tilings about Mr.
litNI]ILK, and cricketers generally, and
Mr. BOODLE'S eleventh man in particular.
"It's BELLAMY of Somerset," I said.
"He made a century yesterday. Who
knows FliY?"
"Surely you do, BILL," said LILLIAN.
SO.MERS thought a moment.
"I know a sort of cousin of CHAMHKK-
LAIN'S," he said at last. He said it
very proudly, being rather keen on
cementing the Empire.
"Dear BILL, so have we often heard.
When I have an hour to spare we '11 talk
politics together. DICK, BILL'S hopeless.
Can't you help?"
"No."
"I wonder how Mr. BOODLK has the
cheek to get a first-class cricketer down.
He's no sportsman."
"BOODLE'S doing it very quietly. A
friend of his knows the BELLAMY man
and said he'd send him down. They'll
probably put him in the score bouk as
JONES."
LILLIAN sat thinking.
"Well, never mind that," said SOMEKS.
"What about our eleventh man?"
"Oh, didn't I tell you?" said LILLIAN,
suddenly. "I've got a man coming by
the ten train to-morrow. TOMMY's send-
ing him." TOMMY is generally spoken
of in the country as "LILLIAN'S brother."
I believe in town he has a proper pro-
fession of his own.
The ten train is the only decent train
from town. It gets into Ashurst Junc-
tion at 11.30, and from there you go by
a single line to Boodle Ashurst. That
is, of course, if you want to go to Boodle
Ashurst. For onr village the Junction
is the best station.
LILLIAN drove in next morning to meet,
as she said, TOMMY'S friend. She had
told her family that she didn't know him,
but could easily tell him by his cricket-
bag. Well, the ten train puffed in, and
out came a man witli his bag. He spoke
to the guard, and then walked along I lie
plat form to the local line. LILLIAN rushed
up breathless.
"Mr. BELLAMY?" she asked.
Mr. BELLAMY bowed.
"Come along," said LILLIAN, "I'm
going to drive yon out. It will be nicer
than a stuffy train."
Do you begin to realise the enormity
of LILLIAN'S conduct?
"It's so good of you to come and play
for us," said LILLIAN, taking the reins.
"Come up, Deny."
"Berry?" said Mr. BELLAMY.
"Yes, isn't he a clear?"
Mr. BELLAMY began to laugh.
"And that reminds me," said LILLIAN,
artfully; "we don't want the other side
to know we 've got such a splendid player
on our side. Would you mind of course
it's awful cheek our ask ing you playing
under some other name?"
"Certainly, if yon like."
"You may choose any name," said
LILLIAN, magnanimously.
"Well really—this isso sudden—
"There's a man in onr village called
OAKKCICKH, but I shouldn't have that."
"Well, what about DERRY, after your
pony?"
LILLIAN gave a sigh of relief.
"Thanks so much," she said. "And,
Mr. BELLAMY," she went on hurriedly, " it
would be rather awkward, wouldn't it,
if people called you DERRY on the field
and you didn't answer at once, so may
we all call you DERKY now, and 1 '11 intro-
duce you to father as DERRY, and then
you '11 get used to it?"
She stopped anxiously.
"What a joke!" said Mr. BKLI.AMY,
and began to laugh again.
"You dear!" cried LILLIAN. She
held out her hand. "How do you do,
Mr. DERRY?"
"How do you do, Miss BOODLE?"
LILLIAN pulled up the original Tlci-ri/
witli a jerk, and looked despairingly at
his namesake.
"BOODLE?"
"I understood my host's name was
BOODLE."
"Oh no, no. BOODLE 's the man we 're
playing against. You must have mud-
dled up the names somehow. Mine is
MAI.I.EY."
"Then how do you do, Miss MAI.I.EY?
and I hope we shall beat Mr. BOODLE."
"Oh, hooray," said LILLIAN to herself.
"I've done it, I've done it, and all on
my lonesome."
At lunch we were all introduced to
Mr. DERRY, and he seemed a pretty decent
chap. Afterwards we drove to the
ground, where we found Mr. BOODLE
looking as sick as if lie had just been
refused by LILLIAN. He tried to buck
up when he saw us, but it was a pretty
painful sight. It appeared that his
eleventh man had not turned up.
"That's BELLAMY," T whispered to
LILLIAN. "What luck!"
"I wonder why he hasn't come," said
LILLIAN innocently. "Perhaps he missed
his train."
They won the toss, but I am not
thinking of describing the game all over
again. I did one account for the Mid-
Kent Herald, and I recommend you to
go for that. You will notice the modesty
with which I treated my own brilliant
bowling, and the sympathetic reference
to a heady piece of work on SOMERS'
part which led to a fine catch on the
leg-boundary, this being his only wicket.
DEKIIY didn't bowl, he said, so we put
him at cover, where he was safe enough.
Altogether they took a hundred and ten,
which is not bad for the wicket. "After
lea Miss MALLEY'S XI. started upon their
arduous task, SOMEHS and It \VK.N opening
the innings —." all of which is pure
Kail Ilcmld. DEKIIY was given the
place of honour, No. ,°>.
Hut DEIIKY never balled; for how the
first pair defied the bowlers, and how
SOMERS hit while RAVEN blocked, and
how we won by ten wickets is it not
written in the Mid-Kml Herald afore-
said? (But in different language.
"SOMERS," I wrote," went for the gloves,
while HAVEN played for keeps.")
At dinner that night LILLIAN was
extremely pleased with herself, and of
course we thought it was because we
had won so easily. But when the
dessert came on she picked up her glass
and looked at DERHY and said, "1 beg to
propose Mr. BELLAMY'S health."
We all stared at her, and DERRY
looked rather an ass.
Then LILLIAN told us her sad, sad story.
Of course we all yelled, and drank the
BELLAMY'S health, and said he was a jolly
good fellow and all that, and we made
him give us a speech.
He got up slowly with a smile, and
said:
"Miss MAI.I.EY, Ladies and Gentlemen.
Many thanks. I think it was a splendid
joke, and it has had very happy results
for me. But I know a joke almost as
good. BELLAMY is playing for the M.C.C.
to-day, so he sent me to take his place.
We thought it would be rather fun to
pretend I was a county cricketer, as I
nearly always make nought."
He couldn't say any more, because we
were all howling with laughter at LILLIAN.
At last she gasped out:
"Then who are you?"
"My name," he said, "happens to l.e
DERRY."
LILLIAN screamed.
"And after twenty-five years I am
quite used to it," he smiled.
It was rather a score off LILLIAN, don't
vou think?

THE middle-aged woman for several
years past "(says the Daily Mail) has
been a genus, extinct, but there are now
indisputable signs of her re-appearance.
This is good news from a humanitarian
point of view, and relieves us of a
haunting fear that we should be reduced
to studying stuffed specimens of her in
the Natural History Museum. It seems,
however, to have been a near, thing, and
we can only marvel at the persistent
vitality of a species thus re-asserting
itself after annihilation.
If it is the mode in the near future to
be middle-aged, we shall doubtless wit-
ness a rivalry in the middle-aged sex as
to who shall be the moat middle-aged,
We shall thus have an extreme in the
middle, which is illogical and unthink-
able, but doubtless within the possi-
bilities of dressmakers and coiffeurs.
And, as a woman is as old as she looks,
we fear her looks will be but middling.
Still, better be tres mediocre in point of
age and appearance than be out of the
fashion.

CHILD POETRY.
[Tn view of the interest now being taken in
the alx>ve-mentioned phase of the poetic art, as
exemplified chiefly in the \\"uidiwr Magazine,
Mr. Punch has bsen studying the matter, and
has come to the conclusion that what is required
to make such poems comprehensible by the
average adult reader is a word or two of
explanation in the last verse. He therefore
offers the following as u model fur future wrilcis
of child-poetry. It will be been that the exam-
ple given preserves the general style, while at
the same time the last four lines explain tl.o
whole of the poem/i
T i i.i-:\v through Ooblin-gnrdwiH once.
And half was laud and half was sea.
I saw the Moon go spinning round.
As white as white could lie.
The windows writhed like liery snakes,
I saw a (.'oiuet flashing by.
And all the Stars went flaring up
Like rockets in the sky.
I saw the Road-hog's lantern flash,
1 heard his great big carriage roll,
And the Cellar-man kept pouring down
A ton of Kitchen Coal.
The Steeple quivered like a (lame.
It set a passing cloud alight,
And where it burned, the sparks flew out
As bright as bright as bright.
1 heard the Fairy Bell toll nine,
It tolled until it broke its tongue,
I heard the Anvil-man at work,—
His hammer rung and rung.
I heard the Goblin-train roar past,
The Guard called out. "Hullo! he's
down!"
And the Pavement-folk went waltzing by,
Each with a fiery crown.
I saw the Blue Man come along,
With a glowing lantern in his belt.
His feet, were hot, and where he walked
I saw the pavement melt.
He picked me up, and there I found
A fragment of banana-peel
Some boy had thrown upon the path,
Adhering to my heel.
AN AUTHORITY ON EDUCATION.
SPEAKING the other day Mr. LLOYD-
GEOROE is reported to have said: "They
did not want the educational standard
in Wales to be set by Lord LONDONDERRY,
who, with all the advantages that wealth
could confer, could not pass his Little
Go at Oxford." The instantaneous suc-
cess of this sneer will doubtless lead
Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE on to more ambitious
efforts, and we may hope to read the
following: -
"Speaking at Pwllheli the other day
Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE said: 'They did not
want the Army to be led by officers,
many of whom had never passed their
Smalls at Sandhurst.' (I^oud applause.)"
"Speaking at Festiniog the other day

Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE said: 'They, did not
want to be governed by a set of
politicians to whom a rocketing partridge

appealed so strongly that the Parliament
of the people had to cease its labours by
August the Twelfth at the latest.' (Loud
and continued sensation.)"
"Speaking at Llanfairfeehan the other
day Mr. LI/IYD-GEORGE said: 'They did
not want the House of Commons to be
led by a man who gave more time and
care to the choosing of a putter or a
stymie than lie did to the destinies of
a nation.' (Jireathlcsx xilcnce.)"
"Speaking at Maehynlleth the other
day Mr. LLOYD-GKOKGE said: 'They did

be controlled by gentlemen who mixed
freely in a Society where Bridge was
not only played for pound points, but

or not he would care to double the club

ACCORDING to the Yorkshire Dally
Observer the recent race for the Motor
Tourist Trophy in the Isle of Man was
marked by many accidents. Thus,
while Mr. HADLKY ran into a hedge,
Mr. DOWNIE (is there nothing in a

only continued the race "after con-
siderable delay."

A BLANK ON THE 'SCUTCHEON.
I WAS immensely proud of that bag.
It was not so much the old associations
that clung to it—though it awakened
memories of many a pleasant jaunt in a
peculiarly vivid way— as the distinction
it conferred on the person who travelled
with it. It had accumulated in the
course of years such a covering of labels,
indicative of what Mr. COOK calls first-
class travel, that to carry it was a pro-
clamation of cosmopolitanism, and merely
to look at it a liberal education. The
labels were of every shape and colour,
giving to the bag, quite apart from
their literary interest, a kaleidoscopic
aspect that at once arrested attention;
whilst the frequent partial superposition
of one legend upon another offered to an
separate itself far from me when travel-
ling in this country. The average rail-
way porter, armed with a paste-brush,
has but little sense of the romantic, and
would cheerfully obliterate the record of
a journey to Baghdad or Bokhara with
a Birmingham label, if in an unguarded
moment you told him you were going
to the latter place. Never shall I forget
the Vandal who, having robbed me of a
part of the reputation this very bag
gave me by pasting the words Little
Gaddesden over Oberammergau, actually
expected to be rewarded for the outrage.
It was only with the kindly help of
BELLA the housemaid, and some hot
water, that I succeeded, on my return
Ir.mi Hertfordshire, in wiping out much
(if this vulgarity.
That was the last occasion on which
the bag had been out with me. It had
for some weeks lain in the dark un-
fathomed cave known as the box-room,
but with the coming of August I began
to feel that it ought not much longer
to waste its sweetness and light in such
a situation. Fortune soon provided me
with another opportunity of being seen
about with it, and even of adding to its
adhesive attractions. My old friend
HARRIS, who comes of an ancient Highland
family, has people who reside in the
Island of Mull for at least a fortnight
every year. I wrote to him two or three
times, mentioning that I hardly knew
whither to carry my bag this autumn,
and after a considerable interval he
replied that as I was evidently fond of
fishing he supposed I might as well

it was just what I wanted. Tobemiory,
sufficiently remote, and associated roman-
tically with the Spanish Armada, was
really not unworthy to have its name
labelled upon the bag. Besides, there
were several charming Miss HARRISES.

COOKING A PARTRIDGE.
(Hi/ an Occasional Suburban Correspondent.)
Wiir.x HAIIHY came home from Ihe City last night I knew
from his fare that something had happened.
"Oh! what is it?" I said. "Is anybody dead?" And
of course my thoughts flew to poor Auntie.
"No," he replied, " but Dixox has had a brace of partridges
sent him, and lie's
given me half of it."
I breathed again.
"How sweet of him!"
I said; "when shall
we have it?"
"It's ready for
cooking now," said
HAKHY. "Couldn't we
liave it to-night?"
I thought for a
moment. "Ves," I
said. "Tlie liash will
keep; it's SARAH 's
night out, BO I '11 put
my apron on and cook
it at once."
It was a plump
young bird, and really
looked a picture when
I had placed it on the grid of the baking pan, nicely
floured, with a lump of dripping on the top of it. At that
moment the kitchen door opened, and HARDY came briskly
in, with five or six copies of the Daily .Mail in his hand.
"Let's see," he said, sitting down on a corner of the
table, "how are you going to cook it?"
"In the oven, darling," I replied, smiling.
"Yes," said HAJIKY, after a pause, "but you know, clear, it
oughtn't to be on a grid; and where's its little overcoat
of bacon?"
I may be unduly sensitive, but aspersions on my cooking
always upset me.
"It isn't going to have
one," I replied, forcing a
smile.
"Oh! and where's the
sausage?" said HARRY.
"There ought to be some
long sausages, you know."
"Why, darling," t said,
glancing at the morsel in the
baking tin, "you've mistaken
it for a turkey."
"Oh, no," said HAHRY, re-
senting my flippant tone, "I
know what I 'm talking about.
And there ought to be a carrot
cut in rounds, and white cab-
bage cut in quarters. The
Daily Mail says KO."
NONE BUT THE HRAYE DESERVE THE FARE.

This was a facer, and I
was nonplussed, as he de-
liberately opened the paper
at the column headed "How to C'ook a Partridge."
"Look here, HARRY," I said, sullenly, "you'd better let
me do it my own way."
"Then it will be dry," he said with conviction. I felt
my cheeks redden under the insult.
"Was it dry last time? " I said quietly.
"Dryish," he replied. "Look here, darling, yoxi're not
too old to learn, you know; let me read you one or two
extracts from the recipes of experienced cooks. 'It should
lie roasted with a little overcoat of bacon," 'cooked in layers
of pickled white cabbage, fried slialots, a little white wine
and enough water to cover it,' and you must be very careful
not to use the flambeau until it is sairjimiit. But just you
read them for yourself, and you '11 tee how it ought to be
done."
"I'll do it my own way," I said, choking back a sob, "or
not at all." Here HARRY lost his temper as usual.
"But it's so simple,"
he said, cuttingly;
"any idiot could do
it."'
"Then you can cook
it yourself," I replied,
as with trembling fin-
gers I iintied my
apron, "and eat it
yourself!"
"Right 0!" said
HARRY, with an un-
pleasant smile.
"And you 11 find

"and I haven't any

there are plenty of
pickled onions, and if I 'd known you were going to interfere
in the kitchen I 'd never have married you." With that I
left him, and hurrying i;p stairs Dung myself on the sofa
in a passion of tears.
llalf-au-hour later, in spite of my grief, I became conscious
of a nauseous odour rising from the kitchen, and, drying my
eyes, I leant over the banisters and sniffed it gratefully. 1
also heard muffled ejaculations in HARRY'S voice, and con-
cluded he was talking to the partridge. Presently there
came the smash of crockery and more conversation, and
then the back-kitchen door was violently opened, and HARRY,
— apparently, went through into
the garden. Next minute I
heard him coming up the
kitchen stairs, and I whisked
back into the room and was
deep in a book as he entered.
He was very pale.
"Where 's the partridge?"
1 said.
"In the dusthole," he re-
plied fiercely; and then for
the first time I saw his
hand was wrapped up in a
handkerchief.
"Oh, darling," I cried,
"what have you done?"
"1 caught hold of the oven
door," he said. "I forgot it
was hot."
He smiled wanly, and, as I
dressed his burns, I knew he
was mine once more; the
partridge no longer stood between us; we kissed again, with
tears, and had (lie hash after all.

THE DEAD AND THE QUICK;
Or, How lUe BooJts of lite Year are Written.
WHILE Mr. SAMUEL SMITH, "Vidi" of the Time*, and other
pessimistic observers are lamenting the decadence of national
iibre and the dry rot of London Society, our novelists, at least,
show no symptoms of slackness or decline. Thus, in a
publisher's announcement relating to "the novel of the year,"
we read how ''Mr. keeps the romance well to the fore,
although his characters play their parts in historical scenes
and amid personages who have made and unmade history.
To secure this effect has involved much careful study of
the period, and no small amount of travel over the ground.
Mr. - hun motored orcr many of the roads nlomj trliich
NAPOLEON roile «o xloicly ninety yearn riyo, but his chief con-
cern has not been to re-write history, but to show it to us
as it must have presented itsolf to those whose romance
came to them while they were in the train of NAPOLEON, the
most romantic figure of the last hundred years."
It is reassuring to learn that this noble example is not
likely to be thrown away. Thanks to the resources of
modern engineering Mr. SKTH Bi'i/;iN lias been able to pierce
the heart of the Alps in a sumptuously equipped train de
luxe many thousand feet below the exposed summits which
HANNIBAL, the hero of his new romance, laboriously scaled on
foot, splitting the most formidable obstacles by the lavish
expenditure of the best Tarragon vinegar. These advantages
will lend a peculiar vividness and vivacity to From Carthage
to Capua, the marvellous narrative in which, by a free but
wholly legitimate use of chronology, the role of heroine
is entrusted to DIIJO, and that of villain to the notorious
Carthaginian General.
In order to get a more detached view of the theatre of his
new novel, The Fall of Xerxes, than was possible to BYRON,
we learn that Mr. SILAS K. CROCKING proposes to employ a
swift turbine yacht, in which he will career from the Helles-
pont to Salamis in a hundredth part of the time occupied
by the Persian potentate. Again, thanks to the invaluable
enterprise of Dr. LUNN, Mr. CHOCKING will be able to eat a
quick lunch on the very spot where LEONIDAS and his 300
Spartans painfully partook of their last meal.
Headers who revel in wars and rumours of wars will be able
to sup full of those delightful horrors in A Noyal Flute Player,
the great novel which Mr. BERT MAXIMUM has written round
the crucial period of the reign of FREDERICK THE GREAT. Mr.
MAXIMUM, always a conscientious workman, has spared neither
time nor travel in mastering his subject, and, thanks to the
generosity of his publishers, Messrs. BOODLE AND Dinus, who
placed a magnificent 80 h.p. Mercedes at his disposal, he has
been able, in less than seven days, to cover all the ground
over which FREDERICK THE GREAT spent seven years laboriously

full of episodes that hold the reader at breathless attention.
He will think nothing could be finer than the account of the
saving of a child swept off the decks of a steamer in mid-
Atlantic, till he comes to the story of the shipwreck on the
English coast. This need not shrink from comparison with
DICKENS'S classic narrative of the wreck off Yarmouth to which
Peygottj/ went to the rescue of Steer forth. It may be added
that Miss Xorinan and Harold are the kind of woman and man
with whom THACKERAY occasionally made us acquainted.
Admirably written, vivid in narrative, rich in character, pure
in tone, absorbing in interest, The Man will be found well
worth knowing.
Sir GEORCJE TREVEI.YAN lias done the State fresh service by
revising and re-arranging his jens il'exfjrit of more than
forty years ago. The title selected, lulerhulex hi Verse awl
Prose (GEORGE BELL), is the only unsatisfactory thing about
the book. For the rest we have some of the brilliant things
tossed off with the energy and vivacity of the clever University
man who is just beginning to feel his feet in the larger world
outside the college quadrangle. The sparkling, tripping verse
looks alluring, easy to write. Disillusion would follow upon
attempt to supply a few supplementary stanzas. The prase
portion, including the vivid narrative of the Siege of Arrah,
a piece of literary work the uncle might have envied the nephew,
is chiefly selected from the " Letters of a Competition Wallah."
Our old favourite, " Ladies in Parliament" (not improved by
the new title bestowed upon it), reminds us that in those
happy days of youth, the ex-Chief Secretary of Ireland was a
constant contributor to the historic Old, pioneer of the
abundant Society papers of to-day. As far as my Baronite
knows, there are only two other survivors of the light-hearted
companionship—Lord GI.ENESK, then known as ALGERNON
BORTHWICK, and DRUM MONO WOLFF, to-day a grave and reverend
seigneur in whose spacious bosom are stored the secrets of
many Chancelleries. In " Horace at Athens," an extravaganza
in the classics written forty-four years ago, occurs the famous
passage:
C'an this be BALUCS, household word to all.
Whose earliest exploit was to build a wall?
Who, with a frankness that 1 'ni sure must charm ye,
Declared it was all over with the army.
Sir CiF.oitoE in the process of revision lias resisted the
temptation to bring the allusion up-to-date. It is obviously
easy, and striking as showing how history repeats itself:
C'an this be BOBBL:S, household word to all,
Whoso latest exploit gave the Boer a fall?
Who, with a frankness that should much alarm ye,
Declares it is all over with the army.
To do the undergraduate justice the faultiness of the last
rhyme is as exceptional as it is daring.
As Dogberry had his losses, so Mr. BRAM STOKER, reckoned
as a novelist, has had his successes. But his earlier works,
popular as they remain, do not approach the level of The Man
(HEINEMANN). My Baronite recognizes its place among the
best half-dozen novels of the year. It starts on a note of
originality rare in days when novels are turned out by the
hundred. The heroine, a beautiful, high-spirited girl, con-
ceives the idea that, woman being at least the equal of man,
there is no logical reason why he should have the monopoly
of selecting a partner for life. She accordingly proposes to
her childhood's friend, Leonard Evcrard, who, exercising the
equal right of man, declines the proffered hand. This is a
fantasy that woidd bore if carried too far. Mr. BHAM STOKER
skilfully uses it as the basis of his plot, and for the development
The Zoo: A Scamper (ALSTON
RIVERS) by WALTER EMANVEL,
with illustrations by JOHN HAS-
SALL, will be a source of infinite
delight to childhood and old
age, and all that lies between.
My Nautical Retainer finds that
the charming humour which Mr.
EMANUEL brought to those most
popxilar of animal studies, .4.
Dog Day, and The Snob, is here
renewed in all its freshness and
piquancy; while Mr. HASSAIL'S
pictures are astonishingly clever
and sympathetic.

MODES FOR MEN.
grateful acknowledgments to several
weekly journals.}
THE turning up of the cuffs of a frock-
coat in order to show the rich sleeve
lining will be quite the smart thing by
the time London is full again. Two
young men who strolled through the
Park last week exhibiting this new
fashion attracted marked attention. My
readers should take good note of the
change so as to allow proper length to
the sleeves when ordering the new frock-
coat, as very few tailors, so far, are aware
of this clever notion, which has been
devised as a pleasant change from the
turning up of the trousers. Headers
may be warned against the mistake of
having both trousers and sleeves turned
up simultaneously when walking. Such
a style is only correct for carriage wear.
The new colour for ties is a plain
canary (not shot) with a small pattern,
not exceeding the size of a florin, in a
shade to match the three-quarter hose,
which should be of champagne silk with
openwork on the heel and instep.
The new wing collar is coming in by
leaps and bounds, and I have ordered a
couple of gross to give it a trial. It is
surprisingly comfortable, and does much
to bring out the lines of a man's throat.
For those who wear long beards the
change to this collar is not, perhaps, of
much importance, but I may add that
long beards are not likely to be thought
smart this winter.
Now that the evenings are drawing in
and there is an occasional nip in the air,
most men are longing to 'know of a
serviceable under-vest. I have seen a very
excellent article in scalded cream flannel.
Chest protectors are never really fashion-
able, and I predict for this under-vest
a great success. If it is guaranteed
unshrinkable it will only occupy half
the space after washing, and will be
found to fit quite tightly everywhere,
yielding the grateful warmth so indis-
pensable in this treacherous climate.
The best type of overcoat for the
coming winter will be Roehampton in
shape, but with the new Australian
shoulder, and lined with velvet. There
will be four seams at the back and three
tails, while the pockets, which will have
neatly pleated flaps, will be at an angle
of thirty degrees. At the same time the
new pyjama overcoat should not be over-
looked. It is excellent for camping-out
in December, when the air is often more
chilly than in September.
Trousers will get wider as the winter
advances, and Melton cloths are likely to
be. a rage for these garments, so essential
to the appearance of the well-dressed
ma.n. An attempt to reintroduce front
pockets has been frustrated, but a happy
and rather neat compromise has been hit

upon in the shape of a pocket cut on the
cross. It should be noted, however, that
there must be no pocket on the left
side, the perfect balance of the figure
being maintained by wearing the hand-
kerchief in the left side of the opening
of the vest. The handkerchief up the
sleeve is now considered common, but it
I may be carried in the hand, a hand-bag
for the purpose being rather effeminate.
The cummerbund will not be worn
by really smart men this winter. Waist-
coats will button in front, and the
opening for the tie will be about one in
seven, a distinguished personage having
set his face against anything more
extreme in this detail. Colours have
not yet been settled, but I fancy that
vests of crushed salmon with checks of
some quiet scheme, such as Stewart clan
tartan, will be much affected.
Xow that so many men are out with
the guns the subject of dickies is especi-
ally appropriate. For walking up birds
they have become quite modish; but
'when the game is driven they are still
rather risque. Another article of sport-
; ing attire, the respirator, changes little
1 in cut as time goes on, and all the old
'favourite styles are as safe to-day as ever
they were. Button boots are very little
worn for shooting now, and for fasten-
ing the sportsman's foot-wear Honiton
laces are completely driving out the old
mohair and porpoise, the hides of which
animals may consequently be expected
to drop in price. Panama hats will be
incorrect for cover-shooting.
The new breakfast jacket has a storm
collar lined with bear. It is best with
two yokes and coffee-proof lapels. List-
slippers give it a very effective finish.

THE HORRORS OF PEACE.
[Being the bitter complaint of a Radical M.P., who finds himself greatly
inconvenienced by the new Anglo-Japanese Treaty, and deems it advisable
that his engagement to address his constituents should be postponed till
the effect of this Tory triumph has blown over.]
THIS is a very awkward thing for me.
This new Alliance in the name of Peace,
Sealed by Conservative diplomacy
Which guarantees to her a ten years' leass;
Others may count it as a common boon;
Myself, I call it most inopportune.
For, being full of excellent ozone,
I was to blow it off upon the stump,
Explaining how I never yet had known
A Government with so pronounced a slump ^
And now this feat of diplomatic art
Threatens to dislocate my apple-cart!
When, willy-nilly, all the World admits
That they have done a monstrous clever deal,
How can I well apply to Tory wits
The usual epithet of imbecile?
Or say, "What wonder if the Greater Powers
Mock at a maudlin Ministry like ours?"
How can I aptly urge that British arms,
Strong in their own unaided force and weight,
Are good enough to cope with all alarms
In or about our Empire's Eastern gate?
I that have never kept this truth concealed :—
We hare no Army fit to take the field!
How can I argue it is infra dig.
To own a weakness in the Lion's whelp,
To own that India finds her task too big
And needs to call KUROKI in to help?
I that have always very loudly said
That our prestige is practically dead!
How can I hint that by this fatal pact
We plunge a sword in Russia's riven hide?
When well I know that, once she grasps the fact
Of certain frontiers not to be defied,
She will console herself with these amends :—
"Since there's no use in fighting, let's be friends."
And, lastly, if I said that this combine,
Rankling in jealous bosoms, might embroil
Our cousinly entente across the Rhine,
I doubt if anybody's blood would boil;
I even apprehend that ribald folk
Might treat it as a pleasantry, or joke.
All which considered, I had best defer
The apostolic progress I had planned,
Till more congenial events occur
(Such as a mutiny upon the Rand)
To put the Tories' triumph out of mind.
And prove them, once again, obtuse and blind.

A REMINISCENCE.
WE had missed him again—a closer shave than ever. If
the lieutenant had put a few men to block the spruit, as
HARRY entreated, we should most certainly have bottled up
the slim DE WET. But that spruit behind the farm served
as his back door, and all we had for our trouble were six of
the raggedest warriors ever seen, and a score of played-out
screws. HARRY was our colonial scout and general godfather;
born at Heilbron, and knowing the country like the palm of
his hand. But what is that to coining out near the top of
,the list at Sandhurst?
So there we were, jogging back to Kroonstad throxigh the
bush, and full of swear-words as a Kaffir's dog is of in-
dustrious fleas.
Presently we passed a cleared patch of, perhaps, fifty acres.
Evidently some time had elapsed since it was cropped. "My
c'lonial oath !" remarked our Australian Briton, "if this yere
don't remind me of the Gawd-forsaken Murray scrub, an' no
mistake 'baout that. Was we in this burn-out, 'AiuiY?"
He pointed to some charred walls and a chimney, mute
and melancholy remnants of the original skillion and barn.
"Lor", old son," Harry answered, good-naturedly superior,
"that's DALY'S old place. The fire happened years ago.
Didn't none of you never 'ear tell of Bosthoon?"
We had not. So he told us how this same clearing had
been celebrated for its first-class mealies and an instance of
extraordinary equine acuteness. JIM DALY belonged to one
of the early circus shows coming to South Africa. He met
with an accident which lamed him and compelled him to
retire from the profession. He settled on this particular
clearing in company with a horse imported from Ireland, and
therefore christened Bosthoon. The animal was preternatu-
rally gifted and sagacious. Being a bachelor, DALY had no
woman near to make things lively, and time passed some-
what heavily on the lonely holding. Teaching his horse the
old tricks grew from a casual amusement into a serious habit
with DALY, who wonderingly noted tliat Bosthoon s imitative
faculties were seldom at fault.
By degrees lie trained the horse to lie on its back and keep
an empty kerosine tin dancing in the air with its feet.
Bosthoon, besides, soon became able to sit on a bench, smoke
a pipe, and drink tea out of a pannikin specially provided
with a big broad handle through which the horse could pass
a hoof. For want of better company, DALY used to spend
most of his evenings in Bosthoon's society. Sitting before
the shanty thus, DALY got to talking at Bosthoon, who, watch-
ing the movements of his master's lips, would attempt a
reply. The intelligent animal's inclination was diligently
cultivated, and presently DALY had the intense satisfaction of
hearing Bosthoon distinctly pronounce the words "Papa,"
"Mamma," "Tea," "More," in a rough, deep, loud voice.
Curiously enough the animal seemed incapable of whispering,
a drawback which made the safe exchange of confidences
impracticable.
Among other exercises, DALY taught Bosthoon to open the
front door every morning at five o'clock. He accustomed the
horse to march from the stable when an alarum, set always at
that hour, went off, lift one foot up to the old-fashioned latch,
and press against it until the door yielded. By degrees the
manoeuvre was performed so punctually that DALY found all
necessity for setting the alarum entirely obviated.
It occurred to DALY one night, after the usual practice
with the horse, that if Bosthoon could be taught to cry " Fire!"
should accident bring it, and give the alarm, the chance of
damage from the terrible element to his large, new, neatly
thatched barn would be greatly lessened. He endeavoured to
accomplish this by holding a shovelful of burning embers
under Bosthoon's muzzle, shouting "Fire!" meanwhile,
and inducing repetitions of the latch trick. After spending

an hour in the task, DALY t-Jidd not
obtain from the horse a single formulation
of the desired word, and, pitching the
embers carelessly away, went disap-
pointed to bed.
He could never tell whether that first
hoarse cry of " Fire !" rang through his
brain as an accompaniment of nightmare,
or after he had awakened. But it
seemed as if he was no Fooner comfort-
ably asleep again than "P'ire!" formed
the staple of another cry. Next came
the sound of the latch's opening, with
an additional yell of. "Fire!" DALY
recognised Botthoon'f voice, smiled to
think how the effectiveness of his train-
ing had thus been practically exemplified,
struck a light, found it barely past
midnight, anathematised the clever
animal, and dropped once more into
peaceful slumber.
Again that cry of "Fire!" and batter-
ing at the latch forced him awake. He
started up, annoyed at Bosthoon's con-
ceit. Presumption on a newly acquired
accomplishment formed just the one
tiling which in animals or men roused
DALY'S bitterest spirit of opposition. A
long bullock whip hung conveniently
near. Gripping this, JIM sallied iii his
night-shirt from the front door, firmly
intending to teach Bosthoon a lesson in
proper modesty. To his utter dismay
i he saw the barn in flames and nearly
burnt to the ground, while Bosthoon
capered madly about, bellowing " Fire!"
in tones calculated to bring an envious
blush on the bulb of a fog horn. Then
sparks rained on the tindery shingle roof
of the shanty, and soon nothing remained
of JIM'S possessions beyond the charred
walls and chimney, scanned by every
passing traveller ever afterwards.
It was clear that the live ashes so
lightly thrown away had worked the
entire mischief. It was, as well, none
the less clear that had Jnf given
BoKthooii\i warning the attention which
the intelligence of the noble animal
deserved, the disastrous fire might easily
have been put out.
Bosthooii did not long survive this
want of confidence t n the part of his
irastcr, dying peacefully at Ermelo,
unoking a long bweet briar to which he
was passionately attached. DALY went
fossicking on the Rand, struck heavy
gold, and later bought back the desolate
acres merely for the sake of their inex-
tinguishable associations.
HAKRY'S artless recital—here faithfully
summarised—was just ended when the

LILLIAN.
III.—A BIT OF ANCIENT HISTORY.
"I SUPPOSE you do really want to marry
LILLIAN?" said GRACE.
This was too much. I stood up and
became heavily sarcastic. SOMERS says
that sarcasm is had for me, and being a
doctor's son he should know. But there
are times when one must take one's life
in one's hands.
"Do the Liberals want a dissolution?"
I said, bitterly. "Oh no! Does the
Times want new subscribers? Does
M. WITTE want to be interviewed by Mr.
BLATHWAYT? Do the farmers want"
"Yes, yes. And how do people get
what they want? Bv sticking to it."

"What fly? Oh, I see. It's a joke.
Well now, do pull yourself together, and
I '11 help you however I
can."
And then GRACE
smiled very prettily to
herself, and blushed a
little, and I know she
was thinking of how
LILLIAN and I helped
her to marry ARTHUR.
Or the other way round.
ARTHUR is my elder
brother. We four were
staying at GRACE'S
father's place at the

is a very enthusiastic
golfer. He is too old to

He looked such a fool as he said it

"No, GRACE."

before. Here I 've been wasting my
time being pleasant to another man's
girl. All right, play with her. We
shall beat you badly."
"Oil, DICK, thanks awfully," lie said.
"But I don't know when you '11 get
your chance," I went on. "We can
never lie far away from each other on
links this size."
"Oh, I 've thought of that," he said
eagerly. "If you slice your ball at the
eighth tee it '11 be all right." And he
added most unnecessarily, "You gene-
rally do."

This might have gone on indefinitely,

out a little square for me some yards off,
and then as soon as my back was turned
she actually went and found the thing.
"Now let's see what I can do.
Where's my mashie?"
1 should have said a "spud" was
more the kind of thing she wanted, but
somehow she got the ball out, and about
five yards further on.
"Two. Now, DICK, one of your really
brilliant shots."
I took a mashie and looked round. I
saw GRACE swing her club, and the two
of them walk on a bit. I should have
to hold the fort a little longer. I hit as
hard as I could.
"Bother," I said, "it's

"DICK! You aren't

Well, that's a bit better.
Now do be careful."

the four of us used to play. LILLIAN was
much the better of the two girls, and
though I 'm not much good myself I am
a bit classier than ARTHUR. So, you see,
GRACE and I used to take on LILLIAN and
ARTHUR about three times a day.
In those days I hadn't yet got that
all-devouring passion for LILLIAN that
occupies my present waking moments.
In fact, I was rather leaving her for
ARTHUR, GRACE looking quite decent
when "driving." But on a never-to-be-
forgotten day ARTHUR came into the
smoking-room after lunch with a look
of grim determination on his face, and
LILLIAN'S clubs in his hands.
"DiCK," he said, with the air of a
conspirator, "I want to speak to you."
"Speak on," I said.

the direction of cover point, and dropped
in the long grass there.
"Good old DICK," said ARTHUR. "There
he goes again!" (And poets say there
is such a thing as gratitude !)
"Oh, DICK," said LILLIAN. "We shall
never get out of that."
"I bet ARTHUR'S is worse."
It was. Never in my life have I seen
a ball pulled so badly. It rose up against
the wind, and then fell plumb into a
patch of dandelions, marguerites, and
tilings—all as thick as could be. "I
say!" said GRACE, reproachfully.
LILLIAN and I marched to the right,
GRACE and ARTHUR to the left. Now
GRACE all through had been talking no
end, in a nervous sort of way, rfnd ARTHUR
had hardly said a word. So I guessed he
would want all the time he could get to
bring the thing off, and that GRACE would
do all she could to keep him away from
it. (I can't think why girls are like this.)
And I thought I might help him a bit.
ARTHUR is a nervous
sort of chap, and takes
some time to pull him-

SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF A
PET BOMBAY DUCK.
To the Editor of "Punch."
DEAR SIR,—Knowing your deep and
affectionate interest in the animal world,
I venture to send you the following
simple narrative. On Thursday morn-
ing last I read aloud to my family at
the breakfast table that extraordinarily
beautiful and poignantly pathetic letter
of Mr. HAROLD BF.OBIE on "The Death
of a Dog," from the, liaily Mail of the
previous day. My wife and children,
aged respectively 31), 7, 9, 14, 16, and
18, were deeply affected by the touch-
ing recital, and our parlour-maid, who
came in during its progress with a
further supply of bacon and eggs, was so
engrossed that she dropped the dish on
the floor, which had only been covered
with fresh linoleum last week. But the
member of our family circle who was most
affected by Mr. BEC.BIE'S noble prose was
our great pet Quambo, a beautiful little
semi-Bombay duck, endeared to us and
to a large circle of our friends by reason
of a remarkable joyousness and vivacity
of disposition, which coidd not fail to
inspire sympathy and create affection
even in those who never have and never
will set eyes on him.
But from the moment of my reading
that letter Quambo was a changed being.
His appetite dwindled, his plumage
wilted; he no longer joined in our part-
songs after dinner—in which his rich
and oily contralto was quite inimitable—
his joy left him, and lie crawled pain-
fully about the house and garden, with
arched back and drooping fins, gazing
up at us with a sublime piquancy in his
eyes which was enough to out-harold
HAROLD BERING himself. None of us
could stand it. The parlour-maid gave
warning, and to make matters worse a
robin "wept" all the time close to the
house. On Friday night we missed our
faithful little friend. Round and round
the garden and through the shrubberies,
with caudles, with rcetylene bicycle-
lamps, tiindstickors, braid ?d fusees,bulls-
eyes, fireflies, in short with every form
of illuminaut that science could supply
or fancy prompt, we hunted and we
holl< ae 1, calling him by all his endearing
aliases, promising liin every form of
entertainment, including Drake's Drum,
the HarmstcoriJit Encyclopedia, and
even half-an-hour's te.te-ct-tete with BAUT
KENNEDY. All in vain. And all the
while the robin "wept " roundly, and the
Cochins, moved by some strange Asiatic
affinity to their lost playmate, sobbed in
solemn unison.
Personally, 1 hud given up the chase
in stark despair and was making my
way home at 6 A.M. thoroughly worn out,
when a sudden inspiration seized me
and I turned back to the artesian well at
the corner of my Dutch garden. Truth,
says the proverb, lies at the bottom of
the well, and Quambo was the soul of
veracity. With the aid of willing hands
I was swiftly lowered down the abyss,
and there, sure enough, faintly quacking,
I discovered the beloved truant, with the
portions of a newspaper protruding from
his bill. We were swiftly hanled up to
the outer air, and further examination
revealed the unquestioned fact that our
devoted little friend had literally en-
deavoured to swallow the narrative which
I had read aloud at breakfast the previous
day, but failing in his heroic attempt
had descended the well to hide his
humiliation. Restoratives were applied
—amongst which Kiimmel was by far
the most effective and I am thankful
to say that at the moment of writing,
Quambo is in a fair way to convalescence.
Why he should have chosen this spot
I have already endeavoured tentatively
to explain. For as I review all the facts
of the case I cannot help thinking that
in thus stealing away from human
caresses, he sought to hide the pain of
his loss from those young lives so devoted
to his pleasure, driven by that mystic
sympathy with Truth which, when all is
said and done, is the guiding star of
feathered as well as featherless bipeds.

A CANINE WONDER.
DEAR PUNCH, - Mr. HAROLD BET.BIE'S soul-
stirring letter in the Daily Mail of
September 27 has roused my deepest
sympathy. It is some time since I
wrote of the weird insight into the soul
of things displayed by the spaniel Sniff,
who committed suicide on the general
lines of CATO UTICENSIS, but with the
assistance of poisoned meat. I have
now to record a worthy parallel in the
behaviour of my beloved mongrel, Tim.
1 Tim has been brought up hand and
glove with a Persian pussy of the most
refined instincts. Dearly did they love
j one another, till the feline mew was
hushed by the hand of death. We held
a solemn funeral, and Tim looked on.
He would willingly have been buried in
the same grave, but could do nothing,
absolutely nothing, to assist. Mark the
sequel. The next morning I saw the
I grief-stricken animal rehearsing every
detail of the ceremony. He carried a
big bone to represent his departed
friend, dug a grave with his forepaws,
and deposited his burden within it. So
distracted was he in his sorrow that,
when 1 sympathetically interfered, he
snapped at me! I need say no more,
but will add my signature of a few years
ago. A REAL ENTHUSIAST.
AMERICAN MODESTY.
["The Americans have the reputation of
being a boastful people, but the recorded facts
of history make exaggeration impossible." —
The Xeic York Army and .Van/ Journal]
I GUESS it used to rile me some
To hear you British say
We Yankees brag about our flag
Across in U. S. A.
But fiow I hear such charges come
With dignified sedateness;
My appetite they do not mar,
Nor even give my pride a jar,
Because I realise they are
The penalty of greatness.
We tell of some historic act —
James River or Bull Run -
And you suppose we draw long bows
About the deeds we 've done.
We simply can't! The very fact
Forbids exaggeration;
For any sane and truthful quill
Admits that ALEXANDER'S skill
Pales before ours at Bunker's Hill
When we became a nation.
You talk of MARLBOROUGH, you prate
Of CLIVE and RALEIGH too,
You boast of BLAKE and FRANCIS DRAKE,
You vaunt your Waterloo;
But you forget our greater great
Who fought in gallant manner—
The countless Colonels who have filled
Our annals—heroes who were killed,
Or, at the very lowest, drilled
Beneath the spangled banner.
The least event, the smallest deed
Recorded of our land,
Is big with fate, supremely great,
Superlatively grand.
Then when we use the word we need
Why brand us empty braggers?
If we describe our naval men
As staggering the world, can pen
Use any other language when,
In point of fact, it staggers?
Our cheeks would blush with shame
to use
Exaggeration's art;
If there 's a thing to which we cling
It is a modest heart.
But Truth must also have her dues,
And therefore it is clear to us,
If we have been designed by Fate
As preternaturally great,
Our bounden duty is to state
The facts as they appear to us.
Is nothing to remain sacred from the
curious eyes of municipal authorities?
"In Chicago," we learn from the Belfast
Evening Telegraph, "loaves of bread
[ must bear the weight and the name of
j the baker." We can understand their
wanting to know his name; but his
| weight! Surely this is an impertinence.

CHURCH AND STAGE.
[The recent participation of a Congregational
minister in n theatrical performance, with a view-
to making his religious services more widely
knonn, suggests the following possibility :]
No more extraordinary scene has pro-
bably ever been presented upon the stage
than that witnessed on Saturday night
at the Southsea Pantechnicon, when the
Bishop of PORTSMOUTH AXD WICIHT carried
out his project of appearing in a travesty
of Hamlet, Prince of llenmark, with a
view to commending the Decayed Curates
Fund to the audience. Opinions may
differ as to the methods of the Rt.
llev. Gentleman—indeed he candidly
admitted to an interviewer (hat they do
among his brethren of the Cloth—but no
one after being a spectator of the en-
thusiasm that greeted his appearance on
this novel occasion can question .the
popularity of the Prelate, or do otherwise
than admire him as an exponent of wide-
aproned philanthropy. A packed house
was laughing heartily at the clever
antics of the protagonist who had just
uttered the words "Angels and ministers
of grace defend us!" when a gaitered
figure sprang through a trap-dcor, grace-
fully leapt before the footlights, waved |
an episcopal crosier and, without further!
ceremony, i-aid :—
"This is the first time 1 have had ihe
pleasure of addressing ;i music-hall
audience, though I have assisted at!
numerous diocesan councils."
The incongruity of the situation was at
once apparent, and it became more striking
when his Lordship added, in a friendly,
colloquial way, "I think you know me,
but I really doubt my own identity to-
night." Hearty laughter and applause
greeted these words. The Bishop then
plunged into the Decayed Curates Fund.
Though he could hardly be called an
old stager, he knew a good deal about
what SHAKSPKARE, doubtless thinking of
his (the speaker's) diocese, had rightly
called "A see cf troubles." (AppUnue.)
He was there, to quote the immortal
Bard again, to " take up alms" on behalf
of decayed and indigent curates. He
had arranged for his hat to be sent
round, and (he only request he had to
make was that threepenny bits should
l:e regarded as "outside the radius," a
Hilly received with great cheering.
The Right Rev. Gentleman then moved
to the "wings ;" thunderous applause
accompanied his steps. Returning to
the front he made the following remarks:
"I have consulted a lexicon of slang,
and find that this ebullition of feeling
corresponds to what is there termed a
•call.' What shall I do?" "Sing'Good-
bye, Little Girls, Goodbye,'" burst
from scores of lips. The Bishop there-
upon without any form of accompaniment
broke forth into the well-known song,
the audience joining in the chorus. At
the conclusion he left the stage, and the
protagonist, again repeating "Angels and
ministers of grace defend us !" proceeded
with his piece of resistance.
In the interview referred to, his Lord-
ship justified his action by saying he
dared do all that might become a
Bit-hop: who dared do more was none.
Vicarious Religion.
ACCORDING to the Srolnman, the pro
spective Unionist candidate for Berwick
n aintaiued, before a meeting of electors,
that "the only way to deal with the
religious question was to allow each
denomination to provide religious teach-
ing in school hours for the parent* of
such children ay desired it."

AUTUMN THOUGHTS.
PACK up your traps, September; you 're moving very slow;
Ixx)k how the leaves arc falling; it's time for you to go.
The Ampelopnis blushes to see how long you stay,
You paltry half-and-half month, you ought to be away,
October's up and stirring; I hear him stepping on.
He won't delay his coining when once he knows you 're gone,
Put off your hesitation and swiftly disappear,
And let me feel the Autumn is actually here.
The leaves, I said, are falling; the mists rise chill and thin.
My rustic friends inform me the days are drawing in.
At six o'clock each evening, when tilings are getting dark,
It is their sacred custom to make the same remark.
The lord of light, Apollo, has ripened all our corn,
And, daily growing idler, postpones the hour of morn.
It does not reconcile me or mitigate my pain
To know our loss is only Antipodean gain.
And, oil, the leaves are falling—I 've said it twice before.
The wind hns started howling; the rain begins to pour.
And twice five hundred freshmen, all stuffed for their exam.,
Prepare to haste to Isis or hurry off to Cam.
Last year I saw some freshmen; 1 cannot bring my tongue
To say how green I thought them and how absurdly young,
How enviously I scanned them and wished that I might bj
Once more myself a freshman agape in Trinity.

MR. Puxni has endeavoured to oblige the lady who wrote
I the following letter to MIRANDA, "Hints" Editress, and in-
advertently addressed it to 10, Bouverie Street:—
| MY DEAR "HINTS" EDITRESS,—Though I don't know you
I of course—personally, I mean, but it is so clever of you to
answer all those letters every week: I remember Laxly
MURIEL, only yesterday but I must not waste your
valuable time. What I want to tell you is, I never can
remember people's addresses. I am afraid it is very silly of
me. I do hope you will be able to give me one of your
"hints"—if you are sure if. won't be bothering you awfully
much. Yours, with very many thanks, EXID.
[Here follo:rs tlic answer to the above J]
Extn.—Cut out with a pair of scissors (a pen-knife will
do) the addresses on the letters you wish to answer, and
paste neatly in an address book (quite inexpensive at any
reliable stationer's). Now pay attention carefully to this, or
you may go wrong. When wishing to address a letter t>
- the Marchioness of GliiMsnv, we will suppose—run your
thumb (or fore-linger) slowly down the steps of the alphabet,
so cleverly arranged at the right-hand side in all these little
books, until you reach the letter G (not M); retain the thumb
in position, deftly jerk back the preceding pages, when the
address you arc looking for will at onca be seen; unless
you have put the paste on the wrong side, in which, case
it will be found face downwards on the opposite page.
Copy this at once on the envelope, taking care not
to put the Marchioness of GRIMSBY'S address on the letter
intended for Miss ROBINSON, say, or what would of course
be still worse, vice versa. Not at all. I shall be pleased to
help you at any time.

In matters which concern the run

I seek the breakfast-room each t ay;
Therein with shame, but not surprise,
To let my wistful glances play
On long buff envelopes that wait
Supinely by my placid plate.
For oh! I feel that once again
1 've caused some worthy chief distress,
Wrung wantonly his heart with pain,
And filled his soul with bitterness,
By plying him with rhymes for which
The laws of space refuse a niche.
How it must hurt him to refuse
The faultless work which he receives,
When, being favoured by the Muse,
I forward the result in sheaves.
With what dim eyes and trembling lips
He gropes for those "rejection slips."
Instead of coin, sweet thanks I 'd earn
Let I my fountain pen run dry.
But there! new leaves are hard to turn,
And even having turned one I
Should have to check myself in time,
Lest I adorned it with a rhyme.
Perhaps, when life no longer frets,
Some Editor and I may go
Where, in a world without regrets,
Illimitable space we '11 know;
And where shall be my lord's delight
To sit accepting all I write.

TIIE fortunes of the members of our

affectionate interest by all loyal subjects,
and two successes announced last week
have caused genuine pleasure. H.U.1I.
the Prince of WALKS has obtained the
coveted position of Knight Grand Com-

and H.R.H. the Princess CHRISTIAN' 1ms

The CZAR has held a review of the

der II. and the cruisers
Pamyat Azarn and Admiral
Korniloff, which now form a
considerable proportion of his

vessels darted about here,

plucky attempt to make them-
selves look more.
We gather from the papers
c mcerned tl at the first Battle

After being blind for a considerable

enemies, however, refuse to
believe him.
We seem to le in for an
epidemic of mysterious dis-

porary, "has just disappeared

MR. E. V. LUCAS modestly claims for his Life of Charles Lamb
(METHUEX) that it is the first attempt made since TALFOURD'S
day to write the story of the brother and sister. He has done
much more. From a variety of sources he has gleaned
particulars that throw light on the home life and the
psrsonality of the singularly interesting literary brotherhood
in whose centre Ella shone with lambent light. There are
innumerable odd jottings, sometimes by their own hand,

truth, they are revealed as being, in the main, an impecunious,
dissatisfied, quarrelsome, drinking, self-drugging lot. The
most delightful is GEORGE DYER, an eccentric of whom,
though a voluminous writer, the world outside parochial
limits would, save for LAMB, never luive heard. To him he
was a perennial pleasure. It is probable he invented some
particulars, notably in his nar-
rative of DYER'S Sunday visit
to him at his cottage at Isling-
ton. "Upon taking leave,
instead of turning down the
right-hand path by which he
had entered, staff in hand and
at noonday, he deliberately
marched right forward into
the midst of the stream that
runs by us, and totally dis-
appeared." It is doubtless
true that, entertaining PROCTOR
at breakfast, DYER quite forgot
the tea. The omission being
pointed out, he set it right by
emptying a paper of ginger
into the teapot. Spending an
evening with LEIGH HUNT at
Hampstead Heath, he came
back a quarter of an hour after
leaving, the family meanwhile
having retired to their bed-
rooms. "What's the matter?"
asked HUNT. "I think, Sir," said DYER, in his simpering,
apologetic way, "I have left one of my shoes behind." He
had shuffled it off under the table, and did not observe his

My Nautical Retainer writes :—A
(METHUEN), by ANTHONY HOPE, is a
disturbing influence which may be exerted upon a variety of
typical existences by a personality that escapes classification.
Though Ora Pinsent breaks no hearts and ruins no lives, and
though in the end she makes a commonplace choice from
among her own kind, yet meantime, of all those with whom
she comes in close contact, she leaves no man or woman quite
as she found them. An irresponsible nature, altogether devoid
of moral balance, she is capable of anything, even of a
technical fidelity, sustained
through many years, to her
miserable first husband; and
also of a breach of faith, after
only a few months' absence,
with the only man who ever
really possessed her heart.
The excuse which she pleads—
namely, that he had know-
ledge of certain facts which
might have brought about her
freedom by divorce, but had
declined to use them—is of the
most inadequate, since she her-
self, when her need was sorest,
had never suggested, or even
seemed to entertain, the idea of
instituting investigations into
her husband's obscure career
with a view to this desirable
process. But to all such
charges of inconsistency Mr.
HOPE has the sufficient answer
that this is the very key-note
of her temperament as he defines it; she is a woman tantum
constans in levitate sua. That she re:nains adorable is a high
tribute to the author's art. But the epithet of " fearless," which
one critic applies to his study of this character, is scarcely jus-
tified. Mr. HOPE has deliberately foregone the courage of his
earlier cynicism. Something of sterner judgment has here
loss until he had gone a long way.

coskaded hat, oblivious to the mistake until someone

admirable a foil to this other heroine from the borderland of
La Bolieme.
Brilliant as a study of character, I find the book not less
remarkable for its perfection of technique. For a critic to
associate the author's methods with those of Mr. HEXEY JAMES
is to make a flourish of his own superficiality. Careful and
penetrative in his analysis, Mr. HOPE never fails to avoid the
meticulous obscurity of Mr. JAMES ; he is, indeed, lucid to the
verge of fastidiousness. And not only in isolated passages,
but in the linked sequence of his arguments, there is about
his style a fine flavour of Latinity. But the features proper
to analysis and narrative-the studied logic and the nicely-!
balanced rhythm—these are never allowed to impose them-
selves upon the dialogue; his conversations remain as ever a
model of spontaneity.
If the autumn season, which this book so notably inaugu-
rates, is to give us any other work that is likely to make a
s ronger appeal at once to the general reader and to the
liver of style, I shall be glad to hear of it.
The Dreamer, by LIT AS CLEEVK (Dinmr, Loxo & Co.). John
Page is the dreamer, a man gifted with talents which bring
him up to a certain point, within half a yard, apparently, of-
the ladder of fame. A fe\v more steps in the right direction
and he will be able to place his foot firmly on the first rung.
Steps, indeed, he does take, but either to right or left,
never absolutely straightforward. He is always "to be or
notto be;" he is "to be" something great in the future;
he is ''not to be" anything at all, save a failure. He never
11 arrives," because he is really never near "arriving."
Capable of being swayed by a grand passion, he is also
capable of considerable self-restraint. He is toujours a peu
pres. In Gray Moreton he meets a kindred spirit. She, too,
is a dreamer of dreams; she, too, is swayed by a grand
passion, and hers dominates his. Miss Moreton is the only
child and sole heiress of an ambitious millionaire; she is a
beautiful girl, of the sweetest possible disposition. She
loves John Parje as ardently as he loves her; sacrifices her
position and her brilliant future in order to become the
wife of the man she adores, the poet she worships, in whose
great future she fully believes. She joyfully anticipates the
time when her father shall forgive her elopement and offer a
welcome to her husband. After a while her mot her secretly visits
her; and her father, without word by letter or message, sends
her some money. The love of this unhappily happy pair suffers
no diminution. Children are born to them, but sweet Mrs. Page
cannot last out the struggle. Dying, a mere child-mother, she
fondly commits her children to her husband's care, and so,
loving and hopeful to the last, she dies. Then follows the sad
story of his decadence, painful to read, because described with
true artistic power. The drama is incomplete, as it is in two
Acts which represent the first two parts of his life; and the
deeply interested reader will be disappointed at discovering
that the Third Act, which should have told us of his final
failure, or of his first, and then of his ultimate success, is with-
held. "The new Jolin Page goes out with a quick step,
leaving his dreams behind him,
done with them for ever." Does
this same John Page turn over a
new leaf? Or is this but one
wakeful moment ere he relapses,
exclaiming "Let me dream
again?" Will "LUCAS CLKEVE"
make the curtain rise on the
Third Act? The Dreamer
Awakened? En attendant, the
Baron strongly recommends to
all who honour him with their
confidence "LUCAS CLEEVE'S"

But this new mania for horticulture

If walking in the garden at your side
I seek to put an end to my anxiety,
You note the roses, and pronounce with pride
The name of each remarkable variety,
Making my dearest wishes unfulfillable
With some brain-devastating polysyllable.
Or if I send to you a choice bouquet
That you may bear it at some social functic.n,
Each rarer bloom you promptly steal away
And press them in a book without compunction.
Think you my righteous anger will be pacified
To see the dashed things ticketed and classified?
Oh. find some other pastime, I implore,
E.g., your tenants' children in admonishing:
The little beasts, when lesson time was o'er,
\\ onkl vanish with a keenness quite astonishing
And such an occupation has the benison
Of the immortal ALFRED, late Lord TEKXYSON.
For though, no doubt, that which J call a rose
(It often proves to be a large carnation)
Would waft the same effluvium to the nose
If known by any other appellation,
It seems to lose its fragrance (if it's got any)
When viewed as raw material for botany.

JESOP ON TOUR.
THERE was once (or twice) a Drama which included amongst
its characters a Detective. Off the. stage, however, he was
only Mortal, and so on a clay he fell ill when the Company
was touring far away from the purlieus of Covent Garden,
and his Substitute only arrived just as the Curtain was
going up.
"Sorry we can't rehearse you, old chap," said the Stage-
Manager to the Newcomer, "but all you need do to-night is
to walk up to the Hero in the Ball-Room scene, arrest him in
the Name of the Law (or words to that effect), and drag him
off the stage in spite of his Determined Resistance. Here are
the Bracelets."
"RightO!" remarked the Newcomer, with true detective
laconicism, as he hurried away to dress, and affix his side-
whiskers. And being suddenly called for the Ball-Rcxtm
scene he made his entrance and forthwith laid hands upon
the Man whom lie deemed the most heroic in appearance.
"Ass !" hissed the Man, below his breath, '' it isn't Me!"
"Oh, I 've heard that before, my Man," said the New Detec-
tive at the top of his voice; and encouraged by the rapturous
applause of the Audience he adroitly slipped the Handcuffs
upon the Man's wrists. "Resistance is useless !" he shouted,
amid the Thunders of the Gallery, as he struggled across the
stage with his Prisoner—admiring all the time, with an
Artist's eye, the latter's remarkable simulation of embarrass-
ment, and proudly conscious that he himself was making a
great Hit withal.
But in truth the real Hero was quietly waiting to be hand-
cuffed in another part of the Stage.

AN INTERNATIONAL TWOSOME.
(From Our Special Correspondent.)
St. Bunker, N.B.
THE great International Golf Match
between Major FOOZLE of England and
Provost MAO'DUFF of Scotland commenced
here this morning. The players in
question represented the maximum
handicaps of their respective countries.
The weather was wet, and a large com-
pany assembled to witness the match.
At the first hole (385 yards) the Major
led off with a low, bumping shot to
within 350 yards of the pin. The Pro-
vost drove to the edge of the tee. Twenty
minutes afterwards the hole was halved
in fourteen.
The Provost took the lead at the third,
the Major having just missed a put of
an inch. At the next—the short hole—
the Major sliced his seventh into the
quarry, and, taking ten to get out, became
two down; his opponent having holed
out a rather lucky fifteen.
With his drive at the sixth, the Major
struck a spectator who had stupidly been
standing 'almost at right-angles to the
tee.
On the eighth green the Provost skied
his put, and lost the hole. A mechanical
eleven followed, and the Scotsman turned
one up.
At the tenth, playing a determined
game, the Major smashed his brassle.
At the eleventh, the Provost drove a
divot 150 yards.
Approaching from the edge of the
thirteenth green, the Scottish represen-
tative made the second longest shot of the
match. At the eleventh, the Major tee 'd
a dozen Haskells before clearing the
burn; the Provost, who went round by
the "brig," winning in nineteen.
The long hole was halved in a strenu-
ous twenty-five.
Late in the day, the Major drove into
the last bunker on the course, the
Provost following with the like. Here,
for the next half-hour, play was of an
even nature. Then the Major sent for
a new niblick.

After the landslip, the Umpire decided
to postpone the Match.
A G HUMAN Military Expert who
witnessed the recent British Army
Manoeuvres is said to have reported to
the KAISKK that, if the Germans landed

IN our adolescent time,
WILLIAM Two,
Twas from your erratic prime
That our taste for ribald rhyme
Took its cue;
Evory fresh Imperial caper,
Every change of martial kit,
Made us go and put on paper
What was meant for airy wit;
Till your foibles readied a stage,
WILLIAM Two,
Where we had to close the page,
Treating further badinage
As taboo;
For it seemed absurd and silly,
And it left- the public cold,
When we tried to paint the lily,
Or to gild the purest gold;
So we left your mailed fist,
WILLIAM Two,
To its only parodist,
Namely, you!
Now at last the lyre emerges
From the lumber where it lay;
But our lips are shaped to dirges,
And the tune will not be gay;
No, our bosoms melt with pity.

THE BOY.
THE Boy of whom I propose to speak is not---at least in so
far as I mean to deal with him—the ordinary boy, such as
you may find in most well, or ill, regulated families in this
liappy and populous island. He is to be found, no doubt, in
a great many households (mine amongst the number), but he
is not related by blood to their authorities. In his leisure
moments, that is to say in the privacy of his own domestic
circle, he is a boy like most others. During the performance
of his duties he is a beef-and-mutton-devouring, plate-break-
ing, mischievous animal, provided with a resonant guffaw, a
row of bright metal buttons traversing his chest perpen-
dicularly, and an infinite capacity, not for taking, but for
getting into, trouble. He is, in fact, that curious and
unaccountable variety of human nature which is set to clean
knives or boots inadequately, to stroll, rather than to run,
messages, to bear the blame falling justly to his fellow-
servants, and generally (except in regard to the last-named
detail) to make himself useless about the house. It is possible
> that he owns a Christian name by which the giggling lady
of his awkward affections will on some future day hail him
when he prepares, in bashfulness and gloom, to walk out
i with her; but it is certain that when he enters service he
becomes nameless, and is always spoken of as The Boy. No
power on earth can persuade me that he ever possessed a
j surname.
The particular specimen of the Boy tribe who has'honoured
my house by making it his place of meals and the scene of
; his»varied inactivities is a weedy, pale-faced person of fourteen
summers who has a fairly well-pronounced tendency to knock
, at the knees, and a flow of language (all ill-pronounced) which,
: though it streams strongly in the passages or the regions
adjoining the pantry, becomes suddenly frozen at its dreadful
source when one of his employers looms in sight. He can
sing too, and does. Every morning, as I sit in my sanctum,
I hear him declaring with a gusto as wonderful as his lack of ear
is complete that he proposes henceforth to be a bee and live
on honeysuckle. There is also a ditty which states very
broadly certain home truths as to the mother-in-law of one
BILL, and of this he is particularly fond.
The Boy is supposed by those who know nothing about
him to rise very early in the morning, and to begin bustling
cheerfully about his tasks. But here again his failure is
painful and extensive—at least if one may credit what the
butler says. Certain it is that the Boy has few, if any, friends.
, The butler, as I have hinted, pours scorn on his early rising; the
: footman, smarting under the conviction, impressed upon him by
his mistress, that he himself has neglected some duty, takes it
out of the boy in cuffs; and the cook, a pattern of benevolence,
openly denounces his uncontrollable, butcher's-bill-increasing
appetite. I cannot believe that an abhorrence so universal is
entirely undeserved. l*jt it is marvellous how in this atmos-
phere of enmity the Boy maintains his impudence, his
incapacity, and his gift of casual song, to say nothing of his
determination to fray the edges of his trousers, to lead a
soapless life, and to be deprived in some mysterious way of
the buttons that should adorn his jacket. He is, of course,
supported by a tonic sense of martyrdom, for he must realise
that, while he is debited and discredited with every faidt
committed in the household, his size and his lack of years
make it impossible for him to defend himself against the count-
less injustices that are perpetrated upon him. For instance,
this morning, when the mistress of the house asked the butler
in a tone of frost, " Who hasn't filled the library coal-scuttle?"
the butler, instead of answering, as truth permitted him,
"King EDWARD THE SEVENTH," or "Mr. ARTHUR BALFOPB," or
"Sir OLIVER LODGE," at once said "The Boy," and added,
under his breath, that he would dust the young rascal's

with zeal, for the butler, of whom 1 hope to say something on

addicted to the truth. I assume, however, that the Bay not
only survived but was not much hurt, for this afternoon I
saw him deviously making his way to the post-office, haying
under his cheek a bulge of apple, which did not prevent him
from exchanging a series of highly elaborated insults with the
Boy of a neighbouring establishment. His careless ferocity
turned swiftly to meekness when he perceived me; and the
other Boy, not being similarly restrained by the presence of
his master, got in a last and blood-curdling piece of abuse.
A VOYAGE TO THE VINES.
No. I.
GEORGE JOU.IBOIS, my excellent old friend, whom I have
neither seen nor heard from since we last parted in Paris
some years ago, took it into his hospitable head to invite
me to witness Les Vendanges (this is not the name of a French
play, but expresses the harvest time of the grapes) in the
Medoc country where he passes a considerable part of the year.
"It will give you," he wrote in excellent English, "two
days and a-half by sea from London to Bordeaux; and then
as long as you like chez moi; el apres you can return to
London via Southampton. Wire '\es,' and you will find
your berth secured oiler et retain: In three days' time from
now I will meet you a I'liotel Terminus, Bordeaux."
Did I hesitate? Not for the millionth part of a second.
".I/on c/jcc," I wired, at twopence halfpenny a word, "jy
suis." As my excellent host had said, so it was all done;
and more, as he at once telegraphed, "JUDKIN is coming; he
icill lie company for you." JUDKIN is an excellent chap;
capital companion,- at least I believe so. I take him on
trust. We arrange to meet on Saturday at the Thames
Navigation Wharf, and sail by La Hirondelte.
With only two bags, and necessary encumbrances of water-
proof, rug, and umbrella, I went, per Underground Railway,
to the far East of London. Here, difficulty to find four-
wheeler. At last, in vehicle of one (dilapidated) cab-
horse power, we pass the Tower: descending a slippery
stone-paved hill, we suddenly find ourselves in labyrinth of
warehouses fifteen floors high. The lane winds like the
Thames, and the stream of traffic would flow smoothly enough
but for its being temporarily choked at intervals by blocks,
sometimes perfect icebergs, of traffic. Occasionally these melt
away, and we pass along for some fifty yards or so. Another
block. Swung high up above our heads are two heavy bales,
various threatening crates of enormous capacity, and, further
on, when we can move, wre shall pass along, like a modern
DAMOCLES en rvyafje, with all sorts of dangers in a state of
suspense over our heads, that is, the cabman's (unprotected),
and mine (protected). There are heavy chests bound (in
iron) for Bordeaux, packing-cases packed, big barrels—in fact,
anything that, being portable by machinery, could be avail-
able for containing anything, however big or heavy, that
somebody might wish to send for a change to Bordeaux.
Packages mostly in the air at present, as if about to pay flying
visits. Some in waggons, some in the last (landing) stage

of transitional existence. It seems as if several giants, with
their families and households, bent on immediately going out
of town, had settled on taking sea trip, and were uow just in
the middle oE transporting their necessary baggage.
In face of these apparently impenetrable and certainly
insuperable obstacles, our gruff-and-grumble cabby becomes
the most obsequious of men. In a cajoling tone lie addresses
himself to the giants' carmen. "I say, old man," says he,
wagging liis head knowingly, "couldn't you just give us a
inch or two? We've to catch a boat at the wharf." "Back
a bit, Guv'nor," says the jovial-looking carman, roughly but
genially. Jl Guv'nor" obeys his order. Then a lane is some-
how opened out for us, kindly leaving quite a couple of inches
between the wheels of our cab and those of the carts. Along
this we crawl. There is no policeman visible anywhere. Con-
stables, if required, might spring out of some of the barrels,
na the forty thieves would have done had not their intention
been cleverly anticipated by Monjlana. There is no one to
regulate, or control, the congested traffic; it is evidently one
of those things that is all done by kindness. Irritate a
carman in this narrow lane down by the docks, and if he
chooses to stop the way you won't get to Bordeaux this week.
That's a certainty. The order of the day is, " Who would
catch a boat must keep his temper."
At last! Everybody comes to the boat that waits. "For
the Bordeaux boat?" asks a porter, who, in a grimy blouse,
suggests the idea of a stoker whose ablutions, just com-
menced, have been suddenly interrupted.
Yes. Let there be no mistake. The Hirondelle. "That's
'er, Sir." And while I am settling up with the cabman, the
active member of the Partially Washed, carrying my bags,
disappears among a lot of casks, barrels, rope ends, girders,
iron spanners, chains, horse-boxes, and odds and ends
of all sorts. There is a gangway from the wharf leading
on to the deck of La Hirondelle. After dodging several
mechanical effects and providentially escaping from under a
horse-box which is making an aerial ascent, the horse in it
looking out over the scene with an air of quiet, amusement,
I cross the gangway crouchingly and then stand erect, as did [
fl/r. Mientrber to face his fellow man, on board Li Hirondelle.'
I look about me. No one I know. Groups talking together.
JUDKIN, my intended companion, not visible. Suddenly I
remember my bags; and with them the porter. Gratuity be-;
stowed and porter withdraws. No JUDKIN. Perhaps not coming.
A sharp, dapper little man politely requests me to identify
myself. I do so, and he does the same service for himself on
my behalf, informing me that he is the agent of Mr. GEORGE
Joi.Linois, from MAISON JOLLIDOIS ET CIE., and has orders to see
that everything is all right for JUDKIN and self before we start.
Being practical, Mr. GRAY, the agent, summons the steward,
whom I at once recognise as having been of the greatest;
service to me years ago on some other ship. No time for remi-!
niscences. I ask him "Does he know JUDKIN?" He refers
to his list. Certainly, he recognises the name. "You mean,"
he asks, "Mr. J. H. JLIDKIN, your fellow-passenger?"
I do not like the sound of "fellow" passenger. "Here is |
your cabin," says WILLIAMS, the steward, opening a door at
the head of the stairs, right-hand corner, and showing a
cabin as neat as one could wish. Berth above and berth
below. Having my suspicions, 1 at once ask, "Have I got
it all to myself?" Steward is doubtful. Good heavens! j
Not all to myself!! Then, in spite of all JOLLIDOIS' kind,
promises, in spite of his tempting invitation, in spite of my
great personal regard for JUDKIN (who may be the best fellow
in the world), I would rather turn back at the last moment
than have another individual, no matter who he may be,
sharing my cabin.
Mr. GRAY is certain it can be arranged. Steward says it
depends on whether there may be a passenger short or not.
At this moment JUDKIN himself turns up from below. Our
greeting is not marked by the enthusiastic cordiality that
characterised our parting years ago.
JUDKIN is a difficulty. I take the bull—that is JUDKIN—
by the horns.
"I don't object to sleeping two in a cabin if you don't," he
says to me, accommodatingly.
"I do object," I retuni, emphatically.
He tries to make some stupid old joke on the word " berth."
If anything could have determined me on ridding myself of
JUDKIN as a stable companion, it is his having indulged in
this very stupid old joke. Fortunately at this instant up
comes the steward with Mr. GRAY. There are three per-
sons unavoidably detained ashore; they have sent telegrams.
A berth is entirely at JUDKIN'S disposal, where he can be all
alone, and can practise his own jokes to himself as much as
he likes, and die of laughing at them into the bargain, if he
chooses. JUDKIN is reinstated as my friend.
Bell sounds. Mr. GRAY departs, lion voyage I Crowd
melts and is carried away behind the ship, which apparently
doesn't move. The wharf, with tubs, casks, and odds and
ends still on it and Mr. GRAY waving his hand, swiftly floats
away, going astern, and in another few minutes it is forced
upon my powers of observation that we are proceeding at a
comparatively swift pace on our way towards the mouth of the
Thames, which is opening voraciously at the sound of "the
tocsin of the soul, the dinner-bell." It is 1.30 and we throng
into the dining saloon, where our stewards place us, as if for
some game, and in a general way direct our movements.
The river traffic occupies the Captain's attention; so at lunch
he is unable to preside.
Passengers, not in couples, are a bit shy of one another at
first. The places at our table opposite to JUDKIN and myself
are vacant. Both of us being anxious to watch the vessel's
progress down the river, we hurry over the mid-day meal
and return to the deck.
I am saluted by somebody giving me a hearty slap on
the back. I hate hearty slaps anywhere. I am about to
protest, when the slapper cornea in front of me, which lie
might just as easily have done at first, and, holding out the
offending right hand, in a Cranmery sort of fashion, he
exclaims:
"Well! by Jove! this is first rate!"
It is BILLY BICKF.RSTIFF; in full, Colonel WILLIAM BICKERSTIFF,
whose welcome I return with as much cordiality as can
possibly be expected to be shown by one man to another who
has just, to put it nautically, taken the wind out of his sails.
"Hallo! Colonel," I say, "this is a treat!"
"Going across to Bordeaux, eh?" asks the Colonel. His
observations and deductions are always so original.
JUDKIN, to whom I introduce the Colonel, remarks tliat his
guess as to our destination is a peculiarly sharp one, as this
boat is only bound for Bordeaux.
BILLY laughs. He enjoys a joke. "Good boat this,"
says he. Then, without pause, lie tells us its tonnage, carry-
ing power, what it takes and doesn't take, and how often he
has travelled by this or some other on the same line, until
JUDKIN and I settle down in our deck chairs.
"We shall meet again! Au revoir! " cries BILLY, cheerily,
turning to descend.
"So long!" says JUDKIN, sententiously.
A delightful evening on the river as the sun goes down.
We shall be very soon dropping the pilot and making
towards the French coast.
IN these days of seismic disturbances we are not surprised
to hear of entire towns being removed to another neighbour-
hood. This is what seems to have happened at Leamington
and Malvern, which figure in the Daily Telegraph under
the romantic heading, "By the Silver Sea."

THE "HOW TO" PAPERS.
No. I.—How TO TAKE A CAB.
CABS as we know them to-day may be
taken in at least two ways. The Right
Honourable CHARLES JAMES Fox, when
in the process of sowing his wild oats,
is said to have taken a cab whose driver
or "jarvey" was asleep inside, and
driven it to the City Temple, where he
left it. The famous principle of common
law, however, that
He who would steal a pin
Would steal some greater thing,
is now held to apply to cabs as well as
to bank-notes and postal-orders, and
anyone who would "take a cab" in the
sense of appropriating it to his own use
without paying for it would soon find
himself in trouble, and even liable to a
severe punishment.
No. When you announce your inten-
tion of "taking a cab" from one place
to another, what you actually mean is
that the cab is going to take you. It is
one of those little inversions of speech
common in our language about which
there is no difficulty, as they are uni-
versally understood.
Let us suppose that you wish to drive
from your house in Piccadilly to your
Club in the Strand. (You probably do
not live in Piccadilly, and there are no
Clubs in the Strand, hut the example
will suffice.) You go out into the street,
hold up your stick or umbrella and call
out "Hi!" By these means you are
understood to be hailing a cab, and two
or more hansoms will instantly dash
up to you from different directions, the
respective drivers of which will imme-
diately start abusing one another. Select
the one who comes off irorst in the
contest. He will be more easily disposed
of at the end of the journey.
When you have told the driver where
you wish him to go, climbed up into the
cab, and given a penny to the street loafer
who has picked up your hat (which has
been knocked off into the mud by the
reins), you will have nothing more to do
until you reach your journey's end,
except sit still and examine yourself in
the small pieces of look ing-glass supplied
for that purpose. In some of the best-
appointed hansoms you will find a box
of matches and the stump end of a cigar
in a little tray by your elbow. It is not
advisable to smoke the latter, but there
is no objection to your filling your own
matchbox from the stock provided. If
the horse falls down, sit where you
are until he gets up again, and leave
somebody else to take the seat of honour
on his head.
Arrived at your destination, get out
and pay the cabman a shilling. He will
hold it in his palm, regard it sceptically
and ask, " What's this?" His question
is in the nature of a rhetorical utterance,

TRIALS OF A
1*011113 I&dy (to Fiance, iclia lias nmUij promiKcd to teach her to shoot). "TELL ME, GEORGE,
WHEN VOL' WANT To TAKE Ol"T THE LITTLE RKD THIMfiS, YOU PULL THIS TIIIXU BELOW, DOH'T YOU?"
for he knows perfectly well what it is. You
will reply briefly, "It is your fare," and
turn away as if you wished to close the
incident. The cabman will then ask if
you call yourself a gentleman, and with-
out waiting for a reply will give you to
understand that in his opinion your con-
duct unfits you for the society of your
fellow creatures. By this time you will
have enticed him off his box into the
vestibule of your Club, where you can
deal with the situation unhampered by
a crowd of spectators.
You will now be in a position to play
your trump card. This will take the
form of an allusion to the subject of
horticulture. In some subtle way you
will imply that your adversary's real
calling is that of a gardener. You may
say, " You ought to be earthing up your
celery, not driving a cab;" or, "I
suppose there wasn't anything to do in
the garden when they sent you out."
This will drive him into a state of
apoplectic incoherency, and you must at
once follow up your advantage by de-
manding his number. Press this point
firmly. He will at first retort by asking
for your card, intimating his intention
of summoning you if it costs him a day's
work. Do not give him your card, but
ask him for his number again, and con-
tinue to ask for it until he goes away.
He will do so eventually, after a final
contemptuous reference to your appear-
ance, birth and behaviour, which you
will affect to receive with indifference.
It follows from the foregoing remarks
that a man with capabilities for repartee
will be in a better position to take a cab
than a fool. But those of the slowest
wits need not despair of being eventually
able to cope with the most abusive of
cabmen. Stick to the word "gardener"
and you will never suffer crushing
defeat.

THE CONFESSIONS OF A BAD
SHOT.
IN all other respects I have a tolerably
good opinion of myself. Also I am good
at games, as the saying is—cricket, foot-
ball (that was in my palmy days),
croquet, golf, and the rest of them. At
all of these I flatter myself that I am a
better performer than the average middle-
aged Briton. But when it comes to par-
tridges and pheasants, games in fact in
the singular number, which have—no,
has—to be shot at, I lose every atom of
self-confidence which I possess, and en-
dure a martyrdom of self-conscious agony.
I arrive—let me describe my sensations
for the benefit of my fellow-sufferers—
at the scene of my self-inflicted torture
by the train which lands me there in
time to dress for dinner. So far so good.
Previously, on the platform of the London
terminus, I have nervously scanned my
fellow travellers, and carefully avoided
getting into the same carriage with
anyone whose impedimenta included a
gun-case, so as not to prolong unneces-
sarily the agony which. I am about to
endure.
For that is the simple fact. It is almost
unmixed agony to me to join a shooting
party. And yet, as one finds a certain
painful pleasure in poking at an aching
tooth, I do it, very occasionally, because
—I suppose because I have to live up
to my birthright as an Englishman.
Every well-bred male Briton is popularly
expected to be a sportsman, just as he is
credited with the ability to ride, and a
complete knowledge of the points of a
horse. The horse I can manage, when I
am not on his back, and it is compara-
tively easy to refuse a mount. Also, by
a judicious avoidance of technical terms,
such as "pastern" and " hock," it is not
difficult, when you are doing the stables
after lunch on Sunday, to affect, to your
own satisfaction at all events, a tolerably
familiar acquaintance with the geography
of the noble animal. I can slap him on
the flank, or whatever the, correct term
is, and say " get over," with any man in
England. But shooting is different. I
cannot, except on rare occasions, suc-
ceed in hitting what I aim at with a
gun. Consequently I do not enjoy the
society or the conversation of those who
can.
Before the shoot begins, if I pretend
to any practical acquaintance witli the
sport. I am uneasily conscious that in a
few hours I shall be regarded as an
impostor. And yet, que fnire?
To feign ignorance is to be looked
upon as a dangerous shot, a mad dog to
be avoided at all hazards. Consequently
I (or perhaps I may say you, for I have a
suspicion that there are plenty of us)
talk in the evening as though I were a
normally good shot, well knowing that
in the morning I shall be revealed in
my true colours. And all through
dinner, and afterwards at Bridge (I
always play Bridge on these occasions,
though I've no memory for cards,
because, being a silent game, it makes
sporting conversation impossible) I suffer,
how I suffer, because I know what the
morrow will bring forth.
The morrow dawns, and I feel in my
bones, fron my first appearance at
breakfast, that the other men, and the
women too, have already seen through
my pinchbeck mask. Why on earth, I
ask myself, with dismal self-reproach,
was I such an idiot as to accept my
host's invitation? I might so easily
have said that I had another engage-
ment, or even that I could not shoot.
ARTHUR BALFOUR doesn't shoot, and he,
like me, is a male Briton. But then he is
Prime Minister. And a Prime Minister's
record is already so black that nothing,
not even the inability to shoot, can make
it worse. But still, I might have been
playing golf, or even sporting with
AMARYLLIS on the croquet-lawn. There
are numbers of Amaryllises here, but I
feel instinctively that they shun me with
one accord—because I cannot shoot.
If it were cricket, now, the most difficult
of all games, the case would be different.
The best cricketer in the world may miss
a catch or get out for nothing. And
even if you are a self-confessed or a
detected "rabbit," no one despises you
for it. But to miss one is anathema
maranatha.
The first drive begins. It is always a
drive nowadays, which makes matters
worse than they used to be. Over dogs
I do sometimes hit. Once I even got a
right and left. But at the end of a drive,
when an officious keeper conies up and
asks what birds I have got, attention
is drawn to my want of success in a way
from which there is no escape. When
the next drive is over he doesn't ask, he
merely looks, and after that he doesn't
even go through the formality of looking
for the birds which I ought to have
shot. If by some lucky chance I do
hold my gun straight, it makes no differ-
ence; the man next me, whom, privately,
I consider to be almost as bad a shot as
myself, always claims the birds which I
know I have killed, and I am far too
generous, or, to tell the truth, far too
certain that my protest will be unavail-
ing, to dispute the point. Before lunch
arrives (and, to add to my sufferings, the
ladies) I have become one of the least
self-respecting creatures on God's earth.
Wild ideas of sending myself an impera-
tive telegram next morning recalling me
to town, or of cutting my trigger-finger
with my razor, flit through my disordered
brain. But nothing comes of it. I stay-
on to the bitter end. For thereat of the
shoot I dree my weird, occasionally
knocking over a sluggish bird, always
when no one is looking. But nothing
can restore my self-respect until 1 have
left the house and all its Nimrods, male
and female, behind me. For the time
being I am become a criminal and an
outcast. And yet what is my crime? I
have tried to do the duty which England
expects of me. I have gone out after
breakfast and endeavoured to kill some-
thing, and my only reward is the scorn
of my fellow-creatures. Perhaps I even
cause them pain, and that hurts me.
Which proves that I am no true sports-
man. A true sportsman never feels
really bad about the pain he inflicts.
MUSICAL NOTES.
As erroneous reports of the name and
contents of RICHABD STRAUSS'S coming
symphony have been widely circulated in
the organs of the hardware industry, we
think it advisable to state the truth of
the matter once and for all. It is not true
that the title of the work is "Symphonia
Turbinia," or that it is dedicated to Mr.
CHARLES PARSONS, F.R.S. The sober
fact is that the new work will be entitled
"Systematica Discordia," and that its
aim is to translate into terms of music
some of the most striking features of
railway travelling.
The first Section will deal with goods
—in which especial prominence will
be given to a strepitous episode for
milk cans,—the relative merit of trucks
of the American and English patterns,
and cognate topics. Attention is especially
directed to an idyllic passage over which
is written in the full score "The Stoker's
Bath," where the turbid character of the
instrumentation is noticeable, while the
composer's preference for liquid fuel as
opposed to coal is delicately indicated in
the scale passages in the Coda. Sect. II.,
"Maestoso assai," is headed "Parlia-
mentary Trains," and is of a uniformly
tranquil character, punctuated here and
there with an impressive lunga pausa.
The principal subject is of a distinctly
South Eastern type, and in the working
out humorous employment is made of a
characteristic figure representing an Iris h
engine-driver stopping suddenly to re-
fresh himself at a wayside inn. Sec. III.,
"The Express," is cast in the form of
a rnoto pe7~petno or non-stop run, which
is maintained with unflagging energy,
passing without a brake into the superbly
sonorous Finale (Section IV.) headed
"Collision." Here RICHARD STRAUSS has
exerted all his powers, with a result that
can only be described as Pandemoniacal.
Indeed the President of the Amalgamated
Society of Boiler Makers, who has been
specially retained to assist in the re-
hearsals of the instruments of percussion,

is enthusiastic in his praise of the score,
and says, " In the whole of my life I have

The "Railway Symphony" will be
performed on April 1 at the Queen's
Hall, and Mr. ROBERT NEWMAN has
already made extensive preparations for
carrying out the intentions of the gifted
composer with a realism and complete-
ness unprecedented in the annals of
programme music. Thus, in the Col-
lision Section (I'regto fracassoso), the
orchestra will be reinforced by the
following extras: —
Twenty-four Chinese geese, to imitate
the escape of steam from the wrecked
engines.
Four Burmese gongs.
Two steam hammers.
Six pompoms.
One complete Javanese Gamelan.
Four cow-catchers.
Twenty surgeons.
Five anaesthetists.
Sixteen stretcher-bearers.
Ten naphtha flare-holders.
It may interest our readers to learn
that the Chinese geese, which have been
selected on account of their superior
sibilatory prowess and are now being
trained at Hissarlik, will be accommo-
dated in the organ loft, and will be
placed under the exclusive control of
Mr. OTHO TWIGG, who has long been a
corresponding member of the Ornitho-
logical Society. To lend further veri-
similitude to the performance Mr. NEWMAN
has thoughtfully arranged that the
leading officials of the Railway Depart-
ment of the Board of Trade (Colonel H.
A. YORKE, R.E. and ColonelP. G. VON
DONOP, R.E.), and the editors of Bradxliaw
and the A.B.C. Guide, shall be accommo-
dated with seats in the orchestra, while
tablets of corridor soap, Banbury cakes,
and luncheon baskets will be circulated
amongst the audience. The attendants
will be dressed as railway guards or
porters, but it is requested that no
gratuities will be given them.
Encouraged by the success which has
attended Snuuss's "Symphoiiia Domes-
ftcn," KUBELIK has composed a Nursery
Overture entitled "Gemini; or, A Day
in Hie ]A/e of my Ttrinit." A peculiar
feature of the score is that there are
two parts for every instrument in the
orchestra down to the triangle, and that
the use of triplets is rigorously eschewed.
The slow movement takes the form of a
duet for two muted double-bassinettes.
Professorj MELLIN HORI.ICK, the famous
Viennese infantologist, has written a
masterly analysis of the new work,
in which he declares that the florid
counterpoint in the whooping-cough
episode in the finale cannot be matched
in the whole range of BACH'S composi-
tions.

PERFECTING THE PARENT.
[""It is a great development of the times that
the ordinary child who IB past twenty is alto-
gether better educated, more experienced and
wiser than are his parents! It has occurred to
me to suggest that after the eldest child reaches
twenty the parents should, therefore, come
under the control of the children."—From a
letter to the "Graphic."]
PENDING the time when the above sug-
gestion shall be universally adopted, we
have pleasure in submitting one or two
hints as to the management of parents
which have been prepared for us by an
expert.
It is a great mistake to suppose that
any parent is amenable to reason, and it
is because many children forget
this point that so much friction
is caused in a number of fami-
lies. Fathers especially have a
most unfortunate idea that be-
cause they have lived in the
world some twenty or thirty
years longer than their chil-
dren, and have had more ex-
perience of men and things,
therefore they know better than
their offspring what course
should be pursued in any given
circumstance.
Firmness as a factor in the
successful rearing of parents
cannot be too strongly insisted
upon. The child that allows its
father or mother to get the
upper hand will inevitably
regret this foolish lenience. It
is not, moreover, a difficult
matter, a well-trained parent
being as docile as a lamb. Pre-
ferably this part of a parent's
up-bringing should be com-
menced while the child is still
an occupant of the cradle.
Should a mother attempt to
move away from the cot while
the babe is awake, screams, cries,
and, if necessary,
energy which is known as "going to
school." A child indulging his parents
in this little relaxation rarely regrets his
generosity. The parent, with that blind
faith in human nature which is his
most charming characteristic, may be-
lieve that "going to school" and "being
educated" are synonymous terms; but,
of course, the intelligent child knows
better. However, the sacrifice is so small
a one to make, and it is regarded by
parents with such evident delight, that
children who are earnestly endeavouring
to train their parents are all advised to
make it.
Of the two subdivisions into which
parents may be divided, the female

convulsions, • -
should be brought into play until the
errant woman returns. The habits of
obedience thus learnt will not be easily
forgotten.
During the first ten or fifteen years of
a child's life much may be done in the
way of training. For a child who has
the well-being of his parents at heart
there are many courses open which, if
used intelligently, will eventually cause
them to look with pride upon their
father and mother. Too much strictness
with a parent is to be deprecated. They
should be humoured in all sorts of ways,
provided always that the indulgence
craved will not act to their detriment.
There is, for example, a very harmless
little pleasure which may be accorded to
nearly all parents; a pleasure^which
never seems to fail to delight them. It is
produced by that sacrifice of time and
section (mothers) is by far the most
difficult to cope with. Many a mother
who originally had the germs of a well-
ordered obedience in her composition
has been utterly spoiled by a too lax
indulgence of her absurd whims. Who,
for instance, has not known the ridi-
culous disturbance created by a mother
on the first occasion on which a son does
not return home until after ten o'clock?
Some of them, indeed, have been dis-
covered weeping, having convinced them-
selves, on an entirely baselessground.that
something dreadful must have happened
to such son. This weakness, if mani-
fested in a mother, must be firmly and
immediately checked. She must clearly
be given to understand that you will
be seriously annoyed if the thing
occurs again, and at the same time she
intention to come home as and when you
please.
An ancient custom has decreed that
the male parent should be permitted to
control the finances of the family, and
that the child should be given only
a certain allowance upon which to
support himself. This ridiculous pre-
judice has often before now led to em-
barrassment, and it is full time that the
matter was given careful consideration
by the Children of the Empire. To
begin with, it is impossible for a parent
to know the many calls which are made
upon a child, and therefore the allowance
which is made to the latter is invariably
inadequate. There seems to be but one
solution possible. Until he has
reached the age of say twenty or
twenty-one, the child should,
perhaps, allow the parent to
retain his control over the
finances. At that age, after the
years of experience which he has
had, the parent should know
exactly what his own yearly
expenditure ought to bo, and he
should therefore be required to
hand over the whole of his
money to his child, who will
make an allowance of the sum
per annum which the parent
thinks necessary to support him,
always provided that the demand
is not exorbitant, and that the
finances of the child permit the
due and regular payment of the
amount.
Provided that obedience in
matters of principle is insisted
upon, parents may be .treated
with the utmost consideration
and kindness, and nothing but
good will come of it. Many a
child who to-day is most proud
of his parents has granted them
almost every facility for enjoy-
ing themselves, and not per-
mitted their duty as parents to
become a burden to them.
In conclusion: be firm but gentle.
Remember that many parents are not
half "bad sorts." If you would have
your parents a credit to you, spare no
effort that will lead to the desired effect.
Then, when in years to come you are
able to show them to your friends, you
can say, witli your hand on your heart,
that "they have all been trained by
kindness."

OPERATIC NOTES.
FIRST night of Winter Season, Thursday last, October 5.
A good opening for any gifted person with a career before
her, and when that gifted person is Madame MELUA, the part
her favourite one of All mi, the opera our (at one time) special
favourite Lti Jioltcme (as played at Covent CJarderi with
certain eminent persons whose names are not in the present
bill), it may be fairly expected that the winter season will be
highly successful, if all the operas promised are up to the
generally satisfactory level of to-night's La Bolieme,
For this premiere, our accepted Bohemian Girl, Madame
MELBA, was not at her very best; yet did she not play and
sing the part as only she can play and sing it? Has not
the representative of Rodolfo, Signer DE MAROIII, a beautiful
voice? Musetta, as represented by Signora TRENTIXI, is full
of "go " and melodiousness. The three Bohemians, Marcello,
Collinc, and Seliaunard, have not been seen to better advan-
tage than when represented by Signori SAM MARCO, LIDUB, and
NIOLA, while landlord lienoit and the elderly beau Aleindoro
were capitally impersonated by two artistic natures rolled
into one under the delightful Anglo-Italian designation of
Signor WIULEY.
The Conductor who led the band of orchestral brothers was
Signor HoOKDSB, an Anglo-slangily suggestive name for a
gentleman whose work compels him to keep his face (or "mug"
as it would have bean termed in the Aleindoro period) so
entirely away from the audience as to give those who would
speak of him behind his back considerable latitude. Royalty
was present, enjoying itself and storing up all the best tunes
for future delectation in India, liohfiitc is a great success,
not a little of which is due to Signor DE MARCUI. But just a
friendly word in the Syndicate's ear: don't overdo this opera,
stick to the programme, and let there be variety.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
ANYONE taking up Mr. PERCY FITZGERALD'S Life of Charles
Dickens (CHATTO AND WINDUS), expecting to find it a revision,
supplement, or extension of FOHSTER'S classic work, will be
disappointed. It does not add anything in the way of
biographical detail to information already possessed. It is,
in truth, in no sense a Life of DICKENS. Rather it is pleasant
chat round a selection of quotations from familiar works
by a man who knew and loved the great novelist It is none
the worse for that. The clippings, made'from many volumes
and brought together in one, cast new sidelights upon
DICKENS'S character, invariably with the effect of endearing
him more than ever to his disciples. We see him at work
and at play, at which latter occupation he was always ready
to lend a hand. His generous, bountiful nature shines
forth in many incidents, half forgotten as the years have
sped. Admitted to the inner circle of his intimacy, Mr.
FITZGERALD came in contact with most of his chums. One of
the best chapters in the book is the account of JOHN FORSTER,
whom my Baronite suspects Mr. FITZGERALD did not love in
the flesh, but to whose best points he manfully does justice.
A letter from DICKENS'S father, given in facsimile, dispels
doubt, if any existed, that he was the original of the immortal
Micawber. "Will you," he writes to Messrs. CHAPMAN, "do
me the favour to deduct the £4 I owe you from the enclosed bill
for £20, due April 7th, with 3s. id., the amount of interest,
and let me have the balance, fifteen guineas?" In the
recorded utterances of Mr. Micawber there is nothing more
delicious than this. With lofty air of conferring a favour
he proposes that his creditor shall pay himself four pounds
out of his own pocket, and, that indebtedness comfortably,
honourably wiped out, shall advance on the airy nothingness
of JOHN DICKENS'S security a further sum of fifteen guineas.
Mr. FITZGERALD, in an ingenious passage, traces DICKENS pcre
not less in Don-it than in Micatrber. He sees JOHN FORSTER
in Podanap, Mrs. MANNING (hung in a satin frock) in Hortense,
the French woman of Bleak House, but does not accept the
popular belief that CHARUSS DICKENS'S mother sat for the
sketch of Af?1*. Nickleby.
H. H. the Raja-i-Rajgan JAGATJIT SINGH of Kapurthala, to
give him his full title and postal address, has written a book.
My Baronite warns His Highness's enemies (if he has any)
that they will not find in it opportunity of clearing off old
scores. My Travels in China, Japan, and Java (HCTCHINSON)
is a brightly written record of travel by a shrewd observant
man. Of China and Java the RAJA has not much to say.
Japan had for him the fascination it wields over all
visitors. Arriving just before the outbreak of war, H. H.
had the opportunity not only of studying the people but of
making the personal acquaintance of the MIKADO and the
greater powers behind the throne. His MAJESTY appears to
be lacking in conversational facility. "He asked me," the
RAJA writes, " if I had enjoyed my visit to Japan; if I liked
the country and"—here was a flash of originality—"if I
had caught any duck at the duck-hunt a few days before."
When my replies were translated the EMPEROR gave vent to
a loud "Ha-Ha-Hum-Hum." A man of less courage than
the RAJA would have trembled at this signal. In accordance
with familiar tradition, the natural sequence of the line would
have been, "I smell the blood of a Kapurthala man." It
happily turned out that " the remark was merely indicative
of satisfaction or acquiescence in one's reply." A few
minutes later the MIKADO bowed out the RAJA. All was
well, and Peace reigns between Punjab and Japan. The
sprightly narrative is illustrated by many photogravures
which add to its value.
While reading 27/6 Hundred Days (CASSEii & Co., Ltd.) it
occurred to the Baron that on this occasion its clever author,
Mr. MAX PEMBERTON, must surely have been inspired by
a fairly clear reminiscence of one of CHARLES LEVEH'S best
works, entitled Tom Burke of Ours. The Baron may be
wrong, but he cannot help being struck by certain points of
resemblance in the two stories. In Tom Burke the hero,
an Irishman, an exile from his country, enters the service of
France under the Great NAPOLEON, whose officer he remains
up to the time of the EMPEROR'S farewell at Fontainebleau.
The romance of LEVER'S novel is intensified by the love
shown for the gallant young Englishman by Minelte the
Virandiere who is devoted to the EMPEROR, and by Tom's
tenderness for poor Minette. Tom did not behave well. Ill
TJte Hundred Days, which of course is after NAPOLEON'S return
from Elba and immediately before Waterloo, with which
decisive event the stirring story concludes, Mr. MAX PEMBER-
TON'S hero of romance is a young officer (with an Irish
servant) compelled to self-exile in France. Falling desper-
ately in love, he follows the fortunes of a capricious girl
who, though belonging to a Royalist family, is so mad a
worshipper of the EMPEROR that she serves him in attire
somewhat resembling that of a virandiere, as she would
sacrifice honour, religion, position, everything, in order to
throw herself into NAPOLEON'S arms. Yet she returns the
Englishman's love, as did Minette that of Tom Burke; and
in the end, when all obstacles have been removed, and when
the Battle of Waterloo has put le petit caporal out of existence
forever, sending him to St. Helena, then, as > BONAPARTE is
no longer to be had for the scheming, Mademoiselle Yvonne
de FeyrolIeK, "the child of adventure and intrigue, her
mission ended," clings to her English lover, Bernard St.
Armand, "as one who might save her from the debacle."
And so, knowing that the gates of her home are closed upon
her, never again to be re-opened; that all had been staked
and lost on a NAPOLEON (including her—ahem—male attire),
and that nothing was left to her out of this mad enterprise
except a brave man's love, she consents to become this
brave man's wife (brave indeed!) and returns with him
to England, where, being cleared of all charges against him,
he can dwell in peace, if only Yvonne his wife will let him.
Methinks, quoth the Baron, that our author has somewhat
hardly treated his hero. Better for him, that is if we are to
judge of the possibilities in the future of this adventuress
by what lias happened in her past, had his eccentric lady-
love, to whom female attire has been comparatively strange
and certainly unusual, met with the fate of LEVER'S broken-
hearted Minetle and expired on the battle-field, as she might
well have clone, had her author been so minded. It is less
a story than a well-arranged series of sensationally
romantic adventures, vividly pictured. NAPOLEON always is,
and ever will be, an intensely fascinating figure, and this,
the penultimate phase of his
career, has for all of us the
most profound and most pain-
ful interest. The romance is
called The Hundred Day*, and
we watch for the movements
of the EMPEROR, listen for
his words, and witli anxiety
await results in which his suc-
cess or failure may be involved,
rather than dwell upon the
stirring parts played by the
real heroine and hero of the
drama.

THE OLD SONGS.
A PARENTAL REBUKE.
[A contemporary has been publishing reminiscences of the comic songs
that used to delight an earlier generation, and has issued a warning to
our youth not to judge the taste of its parents too severely.]
AND so you find them somewhat thin.
The songs that made your sire to grin
When mid-Victorian modes were in?
You snort at that historic wit
Which ouee provoked in stall and pit
The frequent apoplectic fit?
The hoar and hallowed tag that got
Home on the intercostal spot
Now seems the most amazing rot?
Yet were it rash, my boy, for you
To entertain the impious view
(Held, as I hear, by one or two),
That, Humour having changed its style
From what inspired your parent's smile,
His taste was relatively vile.
'Tis true that Time has dulled the fame
(Almost, I fear, beyond reclaim)
Of " L'ltampagne Charlie is my name;"
'Tis tnie that rolling years obscure
The subtle charm, the fine allure
That underlay "TJie Perfect Cure."0
But, en revanche, the vogue of rhymes
Which you have heard a hundred times
Emitted by your favourite mimes—
The last comedian's lyric verse
On which you waste your nightly purse—
Affects me like a funeral hearse;
Or would, at least, affect me so
If 1 could be induced to go
To this depressing kind of Show.
Therefore, my son, if you are wise,
You will observe without surprise
The wayward shifts of Humour's guise;
Nor deem another's taste is cheap
If where you laugh he wants to weep,
Or giggles while,you go to sleep.
You, too, in turn, may have a son,
And marvel how he finds his fun
In wheezes where you notice none.
For here, on this terrestrial ball,
Nations and markets rise and fall,
But Humour wobbles most of all.
No man may say, with hand on breast,
Challenging Time to be its test,
"Lo! I have wrought a Cosmic Jest."
And he alone of other folk
Can still be stable as an oak,
Who never made, or saw, a joke.

NATURE STUDIES.
THE BUTI.ER.
IN sketching, as I did last week, the idiosyncrasies of the
Boy, I mentioned incidentally the Butler who sometimes
dusts his jacket. Let me now describe in such detail as the
importance of the subject demands the essentials of the
Butler's character.
I have lived under the temporary sway of many Butlers—
principally, be it noted, the Butlers of other people -and 1
have observed that no specimen can ever be classed in the
first rank unless he possesses to some extent that staid and
solid demeanour which seems to permeate the frivolous atmos-
phere of our daily life with an old-world dignity and a
convinced sense of personal worthiness. Yet it is not necessary
that a Butler should always be solemn and impressive.
Indeed, if he is, the effect on those to whom he ministers is
apt to be too ponderous for perfect happiness: he becomes a
creature too bright and good for human nature's daily food
and its service to those who sit at table.
It has been my good fortune, not once or twice in "my
rough island story, to visit the learned Lodges of those who
are heads of Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and my
judgment is that so far as mere weight of deportment and a
deep sobriety of conversation go, the Butler of a Master or
President is more highly fitted by nature and his acquired
training to regulate a College meeting or rusticate an under-
graduate than the learned gentleman whom (for his own
ends, no doubt) he serves. Never, while this machine is to
me, can I forget the chill that froze my heart and the leaden
weight that settled on my being when the Butler of the
Provost of St. Mary's received me into the panelled hall of the
Provost's Lodge. It was not merely that he was dressed in
black—other Butlers are like that—or that the curve of his
lower waistcoat was both semicircular and ample, or that he
moved noiselessly and spoke his few words in a low and
carefully articidating voice. All this I could have stood;
but there was about him a sense of mystery which daunted
my spirit as much as if he had been a haunted house. How
came it, I asked myself (after I had recovered from my terror,
Men entendu), that this man, whose only fit associates were
Chancellors or Prime Ministers or Ambassadors, should have
condescended to wait upon a mere mortal like the Provost,
and to take from me my coat and hat and deliver cutlets to
me at lunch? I have not yet found an answer to the
question.
The Butler whom I have in my mind is not quite so highly
exalted in the hierarchy of servitude as the Collegiate one of
whom I have spoken. Yet he, too, has his dignity and, so
far as the Boy is concerned, his dislikes. Far back from the
remote and misty days of childhood I can pick out the
memory of him, can hear him rated by voices that have long
since passed into silence for the faults that lie joyously
displays to this day, and see him moving across the domestic
scene with all the cheerful and kindly abandon that still
characterises him. A new generation, the third, is springing
up about his knees, and impeding him in the performance of
his duties, but he continues absolutely without change, the
same to-day as when I first set eyes on him a thousand years
ago. He was never—I quote the dictum of a fellow-servant,
a contemporary and a friend -one to mind the fires or to see
that the footman or the Boy minded them. He had from, the
earliest times a weakness for tripping over the somewhat
projecting back-legs of his master's chair; and this after-
noon he tripped over them with all his ancient agility and
recovered himself with the traditional remark (muttered as
though to himself) that he cannot make out how ever he came
to do it.
In ancient times it was his custom to forget an elaborately

detailed instruction, and lie still has rare intervals of brilliantly
accurate memory. In short, what lie was years and years ago
he still is and always will be,—a Butler with a share of
hitman frailty and more than his due share of those service-
able virtues that make of an old retainer an attached friend.
His master, whom he remembers in knickerbockers and
trundling a hoop, he treats with such indulgence as may be
bestowed on a child who will never grow up to manhood,
and who still shows those queer little freaks of temper which
it is the part of a good Butler to suffer cheerfully and to
forget readily. With his mistress, too, he exercises great for-
bearance, considering her to be a little chit something
younger and even more capricious than his master. The
children are all devoted to him. The friends of the house-
hold are his friends, and so closely does he identify himself
with his family that in their momentary absence he has been
known to invite a favoured visitor to stay to dinner. He has
just come across the lawn singing, and lias tripped over a
croquet hoop to the rapturous delight of the youngest of his
tormentors.
HOW TO BEAT THE NEW ZEALANDERS.
DEAR Sin,—All this hysterical outcry about new methods
and re-organisation of our llugby football teams is sheer
feeble-minded nonsense. Our players are good enough for
any country under the sun, New Zealand included. The
present trouble is merely caused by that immoral innovation
of the wing forward, who, being neither flesh, fowl, nor good
red herring, can only be stigmatised as a tweeny. The way
to meet the difficulty and stop the contagion from spreading
in our own country is to produce a referee who will systemati-
cally penalise the methods of this tricky gentleman until he
is forced to resume his proper place in the pack, being glad,
in fact, to hide his head anywhere. If heroic measures of
this sort are practised it will be unnecessary to adopt the
suggestion that New Zealand tries shall count two, and goala
three points. Yours faithfully, SPORTSMAN.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,- -Is our National Physique Deteriorating,
indeed! Not a bit of it! Look at Durham and the try we
scored. It may be said we were beaten, but when you take
into consideration the comparatively small number of points
scored against us I consider, and many Durham people agree
with me, that a moral victory was ours. Everybody knows
we started two men short, but it is not, I think, so well
known that HORSI.KY had left his football boots in the train.
Let them wait till HORSI.EY gets his boots on—that's all!
Yours truly, DURHAM LAD.
DEAR SIR,-—At a time like the present, when we are on the
brink of a tremendous cataclysm in the football world, surely
the petty considerations of tradition and convention must be
thrust aside. When drastic changes are made in the
modelling of our teams, when new styles and unexpected
formations are the vogue, when each man plays with the
strength of a SANDOW, the speed of a SiiRrnn, and the wisdom
of a DE WrrrE, then, and not till then, shall we top the score
of our Colonial Cousins. I have watched the games at
Torquay, Hedruth, Bristol and Stamford Bridge, and I am
convinced that to meet the New Zealanders on an equal
footing we must arrange our team as follows:—1 back,
5 three-quarter backs, 2 half backs, 2 five-eighths, and
8 forwards. Even thus we shall be two short of the number
of our opponents-that is to say, of their apparent number.
If this suggestion is adopted I venture to predict that, though
the Scotchmen are not to be awarded caps in the forthcoming
match, it will be necessary to present the New Zealanders
with fresh jerseys. Yours truly, FAIR PLAY.
MY DBMI Sin,—In consequence of the representations of a
great nephew, who was one of the players, I recently attended
a football match at Torquay, and was much shocked at the
conduct of our young Colonials. The barbarity of their
behaviour was ruthless in the extreme; in fact, each time my
dear nephew had the ball, one of the ungentlemanly fellows
knocked him down and snatched it away from him, and the
same thing occurred to his companions, all young men of
good position, not once but many times. Is it sport? Is it
iven seemly? It would not have been considered so in my
young day, or in the young day of my brothers and cousins,
who were all excellent cricketers, and it is to be hoped that
such an exhibition will never again be witnessed on an
English ground. Believe me to remain
Yours very truly, (Miss) MARTHA MYTTEKS.
THE GOLFER'S PROTEST.
["MAST worthy golfers, who do not know that they are speaking
insincerely, attribute, in conversation, the pleasure they feel in pur-
suing their game to the agreeable surroundings in which it is
pursued; l>ut my secret belief is that they pay more attention to the lie
of the little white ball, and the character of the bunkers, than to the
pageantry of sea and sky." — "From a College Windotr," in "Comliill."
A NAMELESS writer in the Cornhill thinks
Tluit modern golfers, when they 're on the links,
Are so besotted by the little ball
As to be deaf and blind to Nature's call.
This proposition, in my humble view,
Is utterly malicious and untrue,
As any honest reader will admit
If he will listen to ir.e for a bit.
Thus, never seems the skylark's note to me
So shrill as when 1 foozle off the tee;
Never the duckling tunes a livelier lay
Than when I throw an easy putt away.
Xor do the feathered tribe alone arouse
Emotion in the golfer; sometimes cows
Will stir him strangely, and a casual goat
-Has led to language that I dare not quote.
To heedless minds, as WORDSWORTH sang of yore,
A primrose is a primrose, nothing more.
To me a blade of grass, however small,
Becomes a portent if it touch my ball.
Non-golfing persons, when they see a sloe,
Or even several, do not care a blow.
I never see a sloe but I am thrilled
With, memories of the gin therefrom distilled.
I love the golden glory of the gorse —
When I am in the middle of the course,
And my opponent drives into the whins,
Loses his ball, and scarifies his shins.
Golf, too, has taught me clearly to disting-
uish heath (with bells) from heather, alias ling;
The latter, past all question, of the two
Needing more beef to whack the Haskell through.
Golf also teaches me to note the habits
Of various rodents, notably of rabbits,
WThose burrows oftentimes have I explored
Searching in vain for my Lost (rubber)-Cored.
Again, I take an interest deep and keen
In earthworms, when I 'in playing through the green;
Likewise the operations of the mole
Electrify at times my pensive soul.
Need more be said? The case is crystal clear;
The golfer's love of Nature i» sincere;
The eye that "from a college window" blinks
Has not the penetration of the lynx.

No. II.
On board the Ilirondelle. Between the Tower and Graveg-
e.nd.—I explain to JUDKIN, who does not seem to have taken
kindly to the acquaintance just sprung upon us, that the
Colonel is a man you won't often meet.
"Glad to hear it," says JUDKIN drily.
"Very amusing," I observe.
"Hope so," says JUDKIN.
"Full of information," I add.
"I have no wish to deprive him of any of it," returns JUDKIN.
"He'll want it more than I shall." Then presently he asks,
"What is he a Colonel in?"
Oddly enough, although I've known Colonel BILI.Y BIOKER-
STIFF all these years- off and on—yet it has never occurred
to me to ask in what, or of what, he is a Colonel. It is not
in my nature to play the private detective or insidious
inquisitor. If any friend of mine introduces any friend of his
as a " Colonel," I take the rank for granted, and from that
moment, to me, that friend of my friend, so introduced, is a
Colonel. A Colonel's a Colonel for a' that, an' a' that. The
man is what any man of respectability may be, but a
Colonel, whether he bear the guinea stamp of Guards, Line,
CavaJr/, Infantry, or Auxiliary Forces, is a Colonel for a' that.
Thus I am continuing to explain in detail when JUDKIN asks
brusquely, "Militia or Yeomanry?"
There is something in his tone that I don't care about.
"What does it matter?" I return, with an assumption of
careless indifference I am far from feeling. That a doubt
should be thrown by JUDKIN" on the genuineness of the pro-
fessional rank of any friend of mine seems to imply a stigma
on that friend as an impostor, and on myself as either
idiotically, or knowingly, encouraging an imposture.
"Hang it!" continues JUDKIN, with irritating pertinacity,
and after all it is really no business of his, "when a man
has a distinctive title indicating a certain rank, he must be
either a professional, or an amateur. A Colonel can't be in
the Navy, can he?"
"All right, old man," I say cajolingly. "What BII.LY
BICKERHTIFF'H rank in the regulars, militia or yeomanry may
be, is a matter of no importance to anyone, except himself."
"It's evidently a good deal to him," puts in JUDKIN.
For some minutes we stand side by side, silently watching
a mud barge. I never was so nearly quarrelling with a friend
—and at the beginning of a voyage too!
La Hirondellc is a mere infant ship, just out of its cradle,
built somewhat on the "P. & 0." model. It will not offer
many opportunities for getting away from anybody. If
two men who have quarrelled are walking the deck at the
same time (and it is ten to one they will be doing so) they

are bound to come face to face every other two minutes, and
if there's a "bit of a sea on," the meeting would be
peculiarly unpleasant.
"Interesting, isn't it?" observes Ooloned BILLY, coming up
to us as we, JUDKIN and self, in the temporarily assumed
character of two nautical pioneers, "stand for'ard " (as JUDKIN
expresses it), silently keeping a rather dull look-out.
"Very," says JUDKIN shortly.
'Most interesting," I return emphatically, echoing his own
word and throwing into the observation a slight but touching
dash of romantic tenderness. I feel that this is required—
by way of a little sweetening for the JunKiN-AND-BiLLY mixture.
"Let's see," continues the Colonel, looking round, "we've
passed Greenwich, the home of pensioners, and the ' Ship,' the
House for Parliamentary whitebait dinners in my time, eh?"
"Not now," says JUDKIN, unyielding.
"Then there 's Hampton Court," says the Colonel. "Capital
tap there—eh?—and tapestries too."
"My clear Sir," interrupts JUDKIN testily, "Hampton
Court is miles away—beyond Richmond."
"Of course it is," continues the Colonel, jovially. "Fact
is I was thinking rather of the dinners than the place."
"Ah !" grunts JUDKIN.
"Then there's Purfleet—good dinner at Purfleet," the
Colonel says; "that's the place where Queen ELIZABETH--
eh?"
"You 're thinking of Tilbury," grunts JUPKIK.
The Colonel laughs. "Of course," he says to JUDKIN;
"you're right." Then lie quotes, "'And in this fort of
Tilbury,'—eh ?—can't beat Shakupeare!"
"That's Sheridan," says JIDKIX, frowning.
The C'olonel seems to be quite astonished at his own
mistake.
"What could I have been thinking of?" lie exclaims.
"Why, Sheridan! Everyone knows that. Now if my wife
were here she 'd give you chapter and verse and every line
of the scene. Wonderful memory she has!"
"Wonderful indeed!" I echo.
"What an escape we 've had !" whispers JUDKIS to me, as
the Colonel walks to the side to examine a large building
through his glasses.
"That," he explains, on returning to us, " is the new Powder
Magazine office
''My dear Sir," interrupts JUDKIK, "it's a hotel. I've
stayed there."
"Couldn't have stayed there if it had been a Powder
Magazine, could you, eh?" asks the Colonel, laughing
jocosely. "You're right, I'm wrong; the Magazine is on
the other side of the river."
The undefeated Colonel points out to us Blackwall for
Southern!, Gravesend for Rosherville, Clacton-on-Sea he
muddles up with Benfleet, loses himself geographically in
the Isle of Dogs, and throws in a few other places of
interest, accompanying every mention of them with anec-
dotes of days long past, when Rosherville Gardens, which
he confuses with Vauxhall, the Surrey, and Cremorne,
were in their glory. He is perpetually placing the right
places on the wrong side or at the wrong end of the
river, from which position they are invariably, and with-
out any sort of ceremony, removed by JUDKIN, and restored
!>y him to their proper sites. Then, as La HirondeUe is
taking its farewell of the river, the Colonel is in the process
of shifting Erith round the corner into Essex, when JUDKIK,
the land-restorer, rushes to the rescue, and returns it safe to
the spot it has occupied with credit to its inhabitants for
many years.
"I was wrong." admits the undefeated Colonel, addressing
JUT-KIN. "Of course you're right. I was thinking of
Scarborough. Don't know what icade me think of Scar-
1 orough." Nor dots aimme else.

The GERMAN ESIPEROR has announced his intention of form-

The Isle of Man has entered into an agreement with the
Isle of Dogs. Mr. HALL CAISE is leaving shortly to arrange
the terms, and it is rumoured that he will be the first Head
of the Twin Kingdoms.
In view of the "splendid isolation" of the Republic of

clude an alliance with the Celestial Empire.
The Minister of Tierra del Fuego has frequently been seen
of late at the Bulgarian Foreign Office, and it i-s whispered
that the SULTAN is preparing for eventualities.
Great interest attaches to the recent launching of motor-
boats on tire Lake of Lucerne. A secret convention with
Italy is said to be the reason of this grave step.
The Queen of MADAGASCAR and the King of SAMOA have
lately interchanged numerous visits. Their object is reported
to be a coalition against France, Germany, and America.

"PUSSY."
EXTRACT FBOM THE RECEES DIARY OF TOLT, M.P.
London, Monday.—It is hard to believe that more than fifteen
years have sped since I last saw Earl GRANVJLLE standing at
Table in House of Lords purring into the ear of the MARKISS
pleasantly spoken things that left behind a bitter taste. Am
reminded of fact by appearance of EDMOXD FITZMAURICE'S Life
of his old chief, issued by LONGMAN in two fat volumes.
Entering Parliament in the year Queen VICTORIA came to the
throne, GHANVILI.E for irore than fifty years remained at work
r.ear the hub of the wheel of public affairs. To write the
memoirs of such a man is to annotate the history of a natior.
Lord EDMOND has accomplished a stupendous task with skill
and discretion. Effacing himself, he allows GRANVILLE to tell
his own story in letters, memoranda, and diaries, supple-
mented by the personal correspondence of his colleagues.
In the thousand pages I do not recall a single intrusion of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
the first person singular on the part of
the biographer. He does not even
mention, what should be recalled as
adding value to his work, that for three
years he was GRANVILLE'S colleague at
the Foreign Office.
Outsiders reading the biography will
have borne in upon them the conviction
that they habitually under-estimated its
subject. The pet name which, among
his wide circle of personal friends, clung
to GRANVILLE throughout his long career,
is indicative of the error. "PUSSY " sug-
gests a velvet-coated, soft-pawed, benevo-
lent-visaged personage la'/.ily blinking in
the sun. This particular " PUSSY " could,
upon occasion, scratch, as many contem-
poraries beside the MARKISS discovered.
A truer metaphor is supplied by the
familiar reference to the steel hand
beneath the velvet glove.
GRANVILLE was the sweetest-mannered
man that ever sat in a Cabinet. GLAD-
STONE happily described him as "one
holding a position of great impartiality
in regard to divergent opinions." He
was constitutionally prone to approach
a man or a turn of circumstance with
disposition to believe that he or it would
turn out all right. But the kindliness
of his heart was not permitted to paralyse
his unerring insight or dull the bright-
ness of his intellect. Courteous beyond
the manner of the average Englishman,
he could, when necessary, lisp a scathing
remark whose effect was the greater by
contrast with his accustomed suavity.
The curtain lifted from the door of
the Cabinet Council, we see GRANVILLE
in a light hitherto reserved for his
colleagues. Whenever dissension broke
forth—and it was equally rife in GLAD-
STONE'S iSecond and Third Administra-
tions—the disputants straightway sought
out GRANVILLE. Both (or all) believed
with equal confidence that if matters
could be put straight, he was the man
to smooth them out. The PRINCE CON-
SORT whilst he lived, Queen VICTORIA till
she died, were in constant private com-
munication with him on Cabinet affairs.
At one time the PRINCE COKSORT showed
a disposition to use GRANVILLE as a sort
of QUEEN'S man in the Cabinet, one who
would undertake to keep HER MAJESTY
privily informed of what passed in its
councils. Under date July 12, 1859,
the PRINCE CONSORT, pleading' "anxiety
of the QI;EEN about the deliberations
of the Cabinet," tried to pump GRAN-
VILLE. Here, among other examples,
was revealed the sterling character of
the man, sometimes obscured by the
laces and frills of the courtier. For
a still young man, the position
suggested, HER MAJESTY'S confidential
representative in the Cabinet, was
alluring. GRANVII.LE replied with dig-
nity and firmness. "Lord PALMERSTON
and Lord JOHN RUSSELL, "{.he*wrote, "arc-

'I'M TAKING MY DOT TO THE Z<K>."
'INDEED! I'M SENDINO MINE TO ETON."
the Ministers to whom it is natural the
QUKEV should look for information re-
specting discussions in the Cabinet on
Foreign Affairs. They would resent
such information being afforded through
any other channel. They would con-
sider it as a want of confidence on the
part of HER MAJESTY and an improper
interference on the part of a colleague."
This remarkable instance suggests that
Royalty, like commoner folk, did not
truly estimate the char.icter of " PUSSY."
As disclosing the secret history of
successive Liberal Governments Lord
EDMOND'S massive work supplements
MORLEY'S Life of Gladstone as a price-
less contribution to modern history.
Correspondence passing between occu-
pants of the Front Opposition Benches
in both Houses proves afresh how history
repeats itself. In 1879 the end of
DISRAELI'S Government was close at
hand. But the certainty of Liberal
triumph at the poll was marred by
personal diss?nsions among ex-Liberal
Ministers. "The varnish is off the
Government," GRANVILLE wrote. "But
the Opposition is not popular." Twenty-
six years later the apophthegm would
pointedly and accurately describe the
political situation.
For the Liberal Party sorrow conies
in with the reflection that the wise
counsel, the genial good-humour, the
shrewd judgment, the persuasive per-
sonality of the Peacemaker is no longer
at the service of his colleagues and his
Party.

already served its purpose. It may be that ere this criticism
appears the excision will have been made. But what a
cast! Mr. HENRY KEMBLE has only to appear as the Hon.
Mr. Justice Uidley to be received with shouts of laughter,
which are intensified as the difficulty in which he finds
himself is clearly placed before a sympathetic and highly
appreciative audience. Mr. KEMBLE is immense, and as his
brother, Kir Babinrjlon Mullcy, F.R.C.P., the eminent fashion-
able physician, Mr. CHARLES ALLAN is so artistically made up
a,s to bear towards him just that unemphasised facial
resemblance which is the very note of what is known as a
family likeness. Their high social position compels respect,
and they are both faced by the awful probability of a dreadful
expose. If the compromising revelation be made, if their
indiscreet love-letters come into open court, there is an end
to the career of the judge and of the eminent physician.
Both parts are excellently played.
Capital is the incisive sketch of character given by Mr.
CHARLES CRAWFORD as Viscount Poffley, the loose, careless
young cub who, when we last see him, lias engaged himself
to Pansy Bligh "of the halls." This fascinating adventuress
finds an apt representative in Miss ANNIK HUGHES. She is
sprightly, she is sweetly demure, playfully in earnest, and a
very tiger cat when thwarted. It is one of the best things clever
Miss ANNIE Hi.'fiiiEs has done. Pansy has troubled the life of
the Judge, of -the Doctor, and of Lord Percy Kilijoitr (neatly
rendered by Mr. ATHOL STEWART), whose intended marriage
to PhilUs Dagenham, prettily and vivaciously impersonated
by Miss DAISY ATHERTON, has been placed by the designing
music-hall artiste in considerable jeopardy. ThenPansty Hligh
has another victim in Horace Wibsey, the solicitor, in which
character Mr. GEORGE GIDDEJCS is immensely amusing. Mr.
FRED KERR, too, as tipencer Trowjhton, C.B., ex-British Consul
at Honduras, is at his very best; in fact this must be said of
them all, as from first to last the fun is never allowed to drop
for an instant.
Then the plot is so good, so simple, so easily followed;
for Miss COMPTON as Lady Diana Galderahaw carries it right
through from beginning to end. Quietly, unobtrusively,
making every line and every action tell, her character is a bit
of artistic workmanship, both for herself and for the author,
which may well be taken as a model. The serious interest
in the farce is with her, and the delighted audience closely
watch her every movement, and won't let a word escape them.
The small parts are all good. Neither Mr. HENRY STEPHEX-
SON as the Solicitor's head clerk, nor Mr. HOWARD STURGE as
Fincherp the junior clerk, could possibly be improved upon.
Miss ETHEL BURNAND, as Charlotte the music-hall artiste's
maid and "dresser," gives a sharply observant bit of low-type
character. Mr. DRVCE, as Towers the much-tried respectable
man-servant of the peppery ex-British Consul, is a perfect
little sketch, highly amusing, very natural, and not in the
least overdone. How good they all are, and what a laugh it
is from beginning to end! Congratulations to the FRANK
CURZON management, and to Mr. and Mrs. CARTON, who will
have "Public Opinion " in their favour for some lime to come.

MEN AND MOTTOES.
Mil. SoFTROE OUT HvSTISiG. FAMILY MoTTO—A~/i TIXERE.
MOEE ABOUT THE "PSYCHIC PARCEL POST."
AFTER the close of the recent Clmrcli Congress at Weymouth,
as a correspondent of the Dally Mall has informed its readers,
a "prohibited" lecture on Spiritualism was delivered by a
popular Archdeacon to a crowded audience, " which included
two Bisliops at least and fifteen clergymen." The lecturer, as an
illustration of Spiritualism, gave the following highly interest-
ing personal experience: On a particular Friday in June,
1876, he was, it seems, cycling from South sea to Chichester
with several yards of white muslin under his clothes next his
skin. Feeling, not unnaturally, "no little discomfort," he, on
arriving at Chichester, made " an unwrapped-up small bundle
of the attire," and, loosely pinning his card to it, with no
other address, made a surprise visit, accompanied by his
fiancee, to "a young lady medium of his own developing."
Close on midnight, "after supper, and two hours of music, he
placed the bundle on the little medium's lap and saw it fade
away and melt like vapour." He had willed it to go to
London, to a friend who did not live there, and whose address
he did not know. At Southsea next morning he had a,
telegram and letter from his friend to the effect that, having
been to the opera and missed his last train to his home out of
London, he liad gone to a hotel, where the bundle had "fallen j
upon his face just as he had gotten into bed." It was after-
wards found that the muslin "and card so insecurely pinned
to it" had done the seventy miles from Chichester in some-
thing under five minutes!
Mr. Punch frankly admits that, had this anecdote reached
him on the authority of any lesser ecclesiastical dignitary
than an Archdeacon, he might have regarded it with some
misgivings, at least until it was confirmed by documentary
or other evidence.
However, he has received so many communications on the
subject from writers whose good faith he has no reason to
distrust, that he is now convinced that such occurrences are
by no means so singular, or even unusual, as, in his ignorance
of psychic matters, he had previously imagined.
He regrets that he can only find space for a very few of the
letters with which he has been favoured:
No. I.
DKAR MB. PUNCH,—I observe that a well-known Archdeacon
has lately described, in the course of a lecture on Spiritualism,
how he once, in 1876, despatched a bundle of white muslin
from Chichester to London by Psychic Parcel Post. May I,
without egotism, relate a somewhat similar, though I venture
to think, even more remarkable experience of my own? On
Thursday last, the 12th of October, I had to go down to
Birmingham on business. On taking up my newspaper and
noticing the date, I suddenly remembered that it was the
wedding-day of two very dear and intimate friends, to whom
I had forgotten to send the customary offering.. After arriving
at Birmingham and having luncheon at a hotel there, I went
to the nearest silversmith's and selected a suitable gift in the
form of a copper stand with spirit lamps for keeping break-
fast dishes warm. To this I affixed my card with best wishes.
After wrapping it up in brown paper, the assistant asked me
to what address I wished it forwarded. I smiled "and told
the man that I had means of my own for ensuring its delivery.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
[ shall never forget his dismay when the parcel, which was
rather a bulky one, slowly shrivelled into nothing on the
jlass counter between us.
It was then (as far as I could judge) about two minutes to
three; I had willed the thing to my friends, and dismissed
the matter from my mind till the next morning, when on
ipening my paper, what should I see but the following,
which I will quote rerbatim:—
"SENSATIONAL OCCURHEXCK AT A SMART WEDDING.
"TITLED BKIDE AND BRIDEGROOM LAID LOW nv MYSTERIOUS MISSILE.
"The marriage of Lord ' ALOY ' COCKPHOTT with the Hon. COCA KXUTT,
;o witness which a large and aristocratic crowd had assembled in Saint
George's, Hajiover Square, yesterday afternoon, was interrupted in an
i noxpected and, at the time of our going to Press, entirely inexplicable
manner. Shortly before three o'clock, just as the happy pair were
about to exchange their vows, some heavy object, which is believed to
iave emanated from the free seats in the gallery below the organ-
loft, caught them both on the backs of their heads with so much force as
to proslrate them at the feet of the Bishop of Knooktopher (Ireland),
who was conducting the ceremony. After their injuries had been
attended to by a distinguished surgeon, who, by great good luck,
happened to be among the invited guests, the unfortunate couple were
removed to their respective residences, being too much upset to pro-
ceed any further with the service that day, though it is hoped they
may be sufficiently recovered to do so by this afternoon. We under-
stand that the missile, on being examined, was found to consist of
metal of some kind, but, beyond the fact that it is stamped with the
name of a Birmingham firm, there is no further clue to the author of
the outrage."
Thus, Sir, I realised that my little token had reached its
destination in excellent time, though evidently the card I
attached to it had, less fortunate than the Archdeacon's,
somehow failed to re-materialise during transit — which,
seeing that it was accomplished (so far as I can calculate) in
less than ninety seconds, and Birmingham being forty-three
miles further than Chichester from London, the increased
rate of speed will sufficiently account for. I need hardly say
that I wrote at once to let my friends know that I was the
person to whom they were indebted, but (and this is, to my
mind, the only really extraordinary circumstance in the case)
I have not hitherto had any letter of thanks, or even acknow-
ledgment! I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,
ALFRED DAVITT.
No. II.
Sin,—I feel it my bounden duty to testify that it is per-
fectly feasible to transmit any object by psychic current by a
simple effort of the will, as is proved by the following
instance: —
On a certain night last July, while walking home from an
evening party at North Kensington, I happened to pass a
street in which there was a house on fire, and stopped to
enjoy what was not only a grand, but a gratuitous, spectacle.
I was wearing a valuable gold repeater, engraved (inside the
case) with my name and address, and, observing that the
crowd in which I found myself was of a somewhat disorderly
character, I wished with all my will-power that I had not got
the watcli upon my person. A moment after, on feeling in my
pocket, I satisfied myself that the watch was no longer there.
I went home in the firm expectation of seeing it lying on my
dressing-table,but found that for some reason it had not arrived.
However, strange to say, the very next morning a person,
quite unknown to me previously, called with the intelligence
that my watch had been found inside the pocket of another
gentleman, also a complete stranger!
The latter's story—in which, let me say, I have implicit
credence—was that, on putting his hand in his pocket, he
had been astounded to discover my watch, which he was
actually on his way to restore to me when he was apprehended.
I am glad to say that my evidence prevented a miscarriage ol
justice, as the magistrate took the view that, seeing that I did
not press the charge, and had admitted that I might uncon-
sciously have myself placed the watch in the prisoner's pocket,
he was entitled to a discharge. Whether I failed to concen-
trate my will-power sufficiently to transport the watch at once
to the desired destination, or whether some irregularity in the
psychic current caused it to go astray, is not for me to decide.
But that it did turn up eventually will only surprise those
who are still ignorant of the great Force which, if we but
knew it, is at the service of all alike.
I remain, yours faithfully,
CYMON PUREFOY.
No. III.
HONOURED SIR,--As a high-class purveyor of meat and firm
believer in Spiritualism for many years, should be glad to
embrace this opp7 to inform you that what that Archdeacon
said at Weymouth touching the Phsycic Parcels Post
was nothing particulary out of the way. Sir, take my own case.
Genrally speaking, I have executed all orders by ordinary
trade vehicles, such as a cart and trycicle. Lately, however,
I have took into my employment a young person as book-
keeper who has turned out to be an advanced medium, which
has enabled me to supply customers direct with all but prime
joints per Physhic Parcels Post, and give satisfaction. I will
not say that the sistym is always reliable. There have been
complaints, as when two kidneys and a Ib. of beef suet
ordered by a most particlar customer by some regretable
oversight materalised inside of the grand pianno, not being
detected till days afterwards and occasioning some unplesant-
ness. Also it have been asserted that meat has been known
to lose weight during psichyc delivery, which (after all) is
only what you might expect under such cercumstanses.
Anyhow the plan works so well that I am already thinking
of disposing of my horse and cart, if not the trycicle. I
nclose price-list, and hoping for the esteemed favour of your
patronage, remain Yours respectfully,
ELIJAH WALKER.
Mr. Puncli feels that, in the face of such testimony, of
which the above is only a sample, the most hardened sceptic
must be reduced to a reverential silence. F. A.

[According to a contemporary, the mannish element is to ba intro-

A diamond heart, or a locket Of pearls?

For knick-knacks men love she's developed a passion
That almost amounts to a kind of disease.
Away then to Bond Street, for clear is my mission.
I 'll buy her a cane, or a glass for her eye,
Some links, of the kind that are known as "perdition,"
A hundred cigars, or a masculine tie.

But sometimes I wish, though I dare not complain,
That Fashion, most captious of tyrants, would let it

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, October 9.—A satisfactory operatic night. As an
habitue of Covent Garden during the regular opera season,
I confess to having been at first rather bothered by the novel
surroundings in the arrangements of the auditorium. When
the place is full, these novelties are decidedly advantageous.
What is called The Grand Circle is far preferable, both in
appearance and for convenience, to the sort of private pigeon-
holes into which, during the season par excellence, the reserved
dove-cots are divided. W'hether such a "redistribution of
seats" as is now observed at Covent Garden, with popularisa-
tion of prices, would be a lasting financial success is quite
another matter.
Manon Lescaut, Puccini's, not Massenet's Manon (which I
fancy would be found the more popular, as it certainly is
the more dramatically effective), was given to-night with
great success. Signora GIACIIETTI was charming as Manon,
and the part of her lover Des Gricux was admirably rendered
by Signer ZEXATELLO. Siguor SAMMAROO
was a perky representative of Lescaut.
The ill-treatment that Geronte, capitally
played by Signer WULMAXX, receives at
the hands of the vivacious cocotte, seemed
to have slightly affected some of the
naughty old gentleman's notes. The'
stage management in the First Act was,'
I regret to say, exceptionally ineffective ;'
and though it was better in the Second
Act the action was not by any means
clearly intelligible. Towards the close
of the Second Act the following stage
direction occurs in the book: "At
Lescaut'n exclamation tin indescribable
confusion tal;cs place." This was in a
most praiseworthy manner carried out
to the very letter.
There was a hearty recall for the
quartette, Signor ZENATELLO, Signora
GIACUETTI, Signor SAM.MARCO, and Signor
WULMAXN, followed by prodigious ap-!
plause for somebody who, at the first sum-[
mons, did not appear. It was whispered
that GIACOMO Pcccixi (born 1858) was in
the house, so all hands went for PUCCINI,
and on the curtains being drawn apart,
there we saw the quartette j ust mentioned

part of Floria Tosca yet she seemed compelled to use greater
force in production than ought to have been necessary. Her
acting rose to the height of her topmost notes; it was
admirable, and the song, "Vissi d'arte e d' amor," in the
Second Act, most feelingly rendered, created a deep impres-
sion. Signor DE MARCIII, as Mario Cararadossi, showed him-
self worthy, both vocally and histrionically, to bear a name so
operatically celebrated as MARIO.
For the'amusing part of 11 Sagrestano, no better operatic
comedian could be named than the artist with the distinctly
and pre-eminently Italian appellation of Signor WIGLEV, who
played and sang it to perfection.
It is impossible to forget Signor Scorn as the villain Scarpiu,
yet it will not be taken as detracting from the merit of
Signor SAU MARCO in the same character to say that "honours"
in this case might be considered as "easy" between the two.
The part is difficult from every point of view.
The enthusiasm at the descent of the curtain on Act II. was
immense, and then came modestly but gaily on the stage (Ym-
, ductor MUGXONE, and after him, to finish
i up fortissimo, appeared the real Simon
Pure, PUCCINI himself. GIAOOMO PUCCINI,
''born 1858," and thought much of since
1870, a star that ought to have been
visible to the naked eye on Monday last,
beams to-night. Better late than never!
Immense enthusiasm!

Signor ZENATELLO superb, both in acting
and singing. Signor THOS, as // He,
excellent. The applause was deservedly
unstinted. The scenery was, as it
always is for this opera at Covent Garden,
most effective, and the staging was more
than up to its usual high-water mark.
The entire performance must be recorded
as a distinct and decided success. And
this, so far, is true of the series.

evidently having exerted their power of
adding one to their number by dragging into the centre an

"That," said someone next to me in the stalls, with the air
of one who knows, "is PUCCINI!"
"Indeed!" cried a delighted visitor, his neighbour.
Down went glasses, up went hands, and voice, with "Bravo,
PUCCINI!"
Herr GAXZ stood at my elbow-. • Now what Hen- GAXZ
doesn't know about operatic people isn't worth remembering.
"GAXZ," I asked quickly, pointing towards the little black
figure on the stage, "is that PUCCINI?"
"No," answered Herr GAXZ immediately, "that's MUGXONE."
To my enthusiastic neighbours, both still shouting vivas
for PUCCINI, I bent down and said," That'» not PUCCIXI, that's
MUGXOXE." They stared at me blankly; the shock had been
too much for them. "MucxoxE, the conductor," I whispered
impressively, as I hastened away. The poor men had collapsed.
GANZ had gone.

ACCORDING to the Musical Times, Mr. WILHEI.M BACKHAUS'S
English Tour is to end somewhat noisily. "At its con-
clusion," we are told, "he mil be heard in Germany, Austria

To bring order out of chaos we beg to suggest to the Dublin
Corporation that, instead of abolishing the office of Lord
Mayor, as one member proposed, they should merely reduce
his rank to that of Knight Mayo:: thus allowing the official
title to indicate, by suggestion, the mutual relations of Head
and Corporation.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IF we are to take Nelson anil the Twentieth Century, by
ARNOLD WHITE and E. HALLAM MOORIKWSE (CASSELL), as a fail-
sample of the books for which the XEI^OX centenary year is
responsible, we may be thankful that we shall not live to
witness another crop in the year 2005. The book is a farrago,
and not well mixed at that. No doubt the chapters on
"Dockyards" and "Discipline" may be useful—though it is
certain that, if there is substantial truth in the allegations
contained in the latter chapter, a very searching inquiry
ought to be made into the condition and treatment of our
sailors ^but the rest is poor stuff, not calculated to do much
honour to the great shade of NEI.«ON. Was it, for instance,
necessary, or even proper, that in pleading for the erection
of statues to NELSON'S captains, the writers of this book
should speak in a tone of scarcely veiled contempt of NAPIEU,
HAVELOCK, and GORDON, three of the noblest and most chivalrous
names
heroes
GEORGE IV. and Sir CUAKLES NAPIER occupy places of honour.
A sum of £30,000 would cover the cost of erecting statues
to ten of our sea captains in Trafalgar Square, and of
transferring the effigies of the three major-generals and the
First Gentleman in Europe to fitter spots for the commemora-
tion of their valour and their virtue." I make the authors a
present of GEORGE IV.; but if they suppose that NELSON or

compelled to go? And so, when we meet with Mr. RIDER
HAGGARD'S Ayesha (WARD, LOCK & Co.), we are not at all asto-
nished, though indeed somewhat disappointed, to recognise
our old friend She (may we be pardoned for speaking of her

she was before, is simply "continued in our next."
Mr. HAGGARD has made a gallant attempt to revive the first
fresh enthusiasm with which She was originally received.
He has tried to exploit some new properties, to burnish
up the tinsel, and to intensify a flagging interest which it is
difficult to keep up to anything like the highest pitch of
excitement. Rare, very rare, are the instances of success
attending the revivification of a once favourite character.

Much as the Baron objects to illustrations to stories, yet he
has no hesitation in saying that not only are Mr. MAURICE
GREIFFENHAGEN'S excellent, but they are of the greatest assist-
ance as stepping-stones to the wean- narrative-tracker.
There is nothing new to be told in the life story of Sir
JOSHUA REYNOLDS. Few painters have been written about so
continuously and from so varied a range of approach as the
any other man can be shamed by association with the three P.R.A. of the mid-eighteenth century. BOSWELL began it.

with due restraint. It is a mere exercise in hysterics, having
the inaccuracy inseparable from hysterics. It was DANTON,
not NAPOLEON, who spoke of "L'audace" thrice over as the
"secret of victory;" and if a great French Admiral ever

than most French Admirals are.

If Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT has not made sympathetic study in

because, coming to him by nature (like reading and writing to

conveyance for the story. It should have been written in
French. Only once does the indestructible British style
obtrude itself. At the height of her career, unblushingly

of the claims of the JACK HORNER who could eat no fat.

DUCAL DEBUTANTES.
(With acknowledgments to the "Evening Standan
and St. James's Gazette " of the 19th inat.)
A GOODLY company of daughters and
granddaughters of Dukes are likely to
be among the debutantes of the winter.
Foremost amongst them is Ladv VINOLIA
BORVIL, third daughter of the Duke and
Duchess of OXFORD. Lady VINOLTA is a
tall, handsome, spacious girl, with terra-
cotta hair and a salmon-pink complexion,
and is an accomplished musician, playing
equally well on the gramophone, the
jamboon, and the kinkajou.
Lady BETSINDA BORAGE, youngest
daughter of the Duke and Duchess oi
MULL, is just sixteen, but will probably
spend the winter with her mother in
the Canary Islands. She is, for the
daughter of a Duke, a distinctly good-
looking girl, and, like many of her con-
temporaries, of a decidedly athletic turn,
being generally admitted to be the best
titled lady hockey player in the island
of Mull.
The Duchess of DOXNYBROOK'S three
daughters, Lady PEGGY, Lady OVOCA and
Lady BONANZA DARGI.E, are not triplets,
though their resemblance is so remark-
able that the Duke constantly mistakes
one for the other. Lady BONANZA'S birth-
day, curious to relate, is on February 14,
which interesting date she shares with
HARUY VARDON, Mr. ARNOLD WHITE, and
Admiral Tono. Lady BONANZA is a lovely
girl, tall and willowy in figure, with a
superb Wellington nose, dusky hair and
wonderful large eau-de-Nil eyes with
pale pink pupils. Her elder sister,
Lady OVOCA, has a rich contralto voice,
and sings in better tune than many
untitled amateurs, besides playing a
good game at "snooker" pool, and
weighing just on 11 stone.
Lady MARSALA DAVIOT, eldest daughter
of the Marquis and Marchioness of
CULLODEN, and granddaughter of the
Duke of LEITH, is sure to come out at
some of the country winter gaieties. She
is extremely winsome, with wonderful
gamboge hair, emerald eyes, and an
astounding complexion. Lady MARSALA,
who is a great favourite with the Duke,
has marked literary tastes, and makes
quite a handsome income by her con-
tributions to the Leith Pilot and the
Gentleman's Magazine. Her presenta-
tion was to have taken place last spring,
but was postponed on account of an epi-
demic of measles, from which, happily,
she has now completely recovered.
Another Duke's granddaughter whose
debut is imminent is Lady HESTER SALSIFY,
the eldest child of the Marquis and
Marchioness of SEASCALE. Lady HKSTER,
though a pronounced vegetarian, never
misses a meet of the Thirlmere Stag-
hounds, and has several silver-mounted
brushes as trophies of her equestrian

Small Boy (to R.A., Chevalier of the I^egion of Honour, etc., etc.). "Oil, FATHER, IF YOU

prowess. Lady HESTER is known to her
intimates by her charming second name
of VASELINA, derived from the fact that
one of her ancestors took service under
GUHTAVUS VASA. She is a bright, cheery
jirl, with ricli chestnut hair and a
3rilliant colouring, though she has re-
ceived the most careful home education.
"CAN any lady recommend a reliable
lat servant for a single lady?" This
seems to be the plane cook's chance.
THE BETTER PART.
(Concerning the Kimlerley-Sapiccll duel,
proposed and abandoned.)
"I 'LL shoot you dead!" cried TWEEDLE-
PEE,
"Let's catch the evening boat."
"No guns," said TWEEDLEDUM, "for me,"
And shed his little coat.
With rage their little hearts were hot,
Till peaceful FFOLKES cried " Don't!"
"Well, if you think we 'd better not,"
They both replied, "we won't."

ENGLAND EXPECTS«
(Tlioughls on the Nelson Centenary, October 21.)
IF earthward you could wing your flight
And look on London's central zone,
Seizing that eligible site
Where stands your counterfeit in stone,
I wonder, NELSON, if your eye
Would even form the faintest image
Of what emotions underlie
This tumult, this stupendous scrimmage.
Could you desert that heavenly place
Where sailors know their pilot-star
To view the many-peopled space
Named by the name of Trafalgar;—
Remembering how your signal ran,
That still remains a thing of beauty,
You might expect that every man
This day, as then, would do his duty.
Alas! we have no ships afloat
Upon the basins in the Square;
It is the landsman's lusty throat
That rends to-day a saltless air;
And, save from such as hold the main
To guard her pride among the nations,
England lias ceased to entertain
Much in the way of expectations.
0 yes! they '11 shout all right enough!
It costs them little; noise is cheap;
But have they hearts of quite the stuff
That made your loyal pulses leap?
They '11 roar you till their midriffs ache
Under the bunting's brave devices,
But wouldn't lift a hand to make
The least of all your sacrifices.
A wind of words—and nothing more1!
But if the test were sought in deeds,
If England asked the sons she bore
Each man to serve the Mother's needs ;—
If she "expected" such a debt
To stir the blood of those that owe it,
The sole response that she would get
Would be, "No thanks; not if we know it."
Just now they pipe a patriot tune;
Anon they '11 wonder why they spent
A precious football afternoon
Mafficking round a monument;
And myriads who go mad to-day—
Give them a week, they '11 go yet madder,
Watching the modern heroes' fray,
Where hirelings hoof a bounding bladder.
Much you would have to marvel at
Could you return this autumn-tide;
You 'd find the Fleet—thank God for that—
Staunch and alert as when you died;
But, elsewhere, few to play your part,
Ready at need and ripe for action;
The rest—in idle ease of heart
Smiling an unctuous satisfaction.
1 doubt if you could well endure
These new ideals (so changed we are)
Undreamed, HORATIO, in your
Philosophy of Trafalgar;
And, should you still "expect" to see
The standard reached which you erected,
Nothing just now would seem to be
So certain as the unexpected. 0. S.
SOMETHING WANTING.
The Perfect Lover strikes me as an imperfect play. It is
described by its author, Mr. ALFRED SCTRO, as "an original:
play," and no one, who has seen it, will care to deny either its i
title to originality, or the merit of its well-written dialogue.
It is acted for all it is worth, and its literary and dramatic
value is considerable. That Mr. SUTRO does not aim at
pointing a moral is evident. In the entire list of characters
there is none that doeth good, except the irresponsible young
daughter. The high-principled-man falls before a very slight
temptation; his ordinarily good wife has done so before him,
and to her he yields. Thus far they have the model of
ADAM and EVE. The criminal act of Joseph Tremblett (Mr.
LEWIS WALI.ER) aids, abets, and encourages the criminality of
Lord Cardew (Mr. FRANK MILLS), of Lilian Tremblett (Miss
EVELYN MILLARD), and of the Hon. Susan Lesson (Miss
HENRIETTA WATSON) ; the last of whom renounces her principles,
her preaching, and her practice, in order to give the sanction
of her respectability to the crime of her nephew and her god-
daughter. What becomes of this trio of criminals the author
does not tell us. With the fall of the curtain they have dis-
appeared, and then are heard of no more.
Too late the unfortunate Joseph Tremblett and his wife
Martha (touchingly impersonated by Miss EDVFH OLIVE) repent
of their digression from the path of virtue. William Tremblett,
the villainous brother, instigator of the deed which has
caused the crime,—a part strongly played by Mr. NORMAN
McKiNNEL,—indeed, had the play been called Tlie Perfect
Villain, the reason of the title would have been more evident,
— takes nothing by his motion, as Joseph, returning to the
path of virtue, destroys the deed which would have given
him twenty thousand pounds and would have made his
brother a millionaire.
So the wicked brother, who did love his wife, but didn't
show it, and whose wife didn't love him and did show it,
loses his chance of making a fortune, and loses his wife
into the bargain unless he chooses to follow her to Canada,
where, if the Hon. Susan Lesson shall have insisted on Lord
Cardew and Lilian being ever with her, always in her
presence, on absolutely platonic terms, he may find that
there is really no harm done, and tliat Lord Cardew and Mr*.
Tremblett, having become pretty considerably bored by being
fettered, watched, and preached at by Miss Susan (aunt and
godmother), will both be only too ready to part company, when
William Tremblett will return to England as a really devoted
husband with a vastly improved wife. This is how it ought
to end unless all principle be thrown to the winds, and
Lord Cardew, his aunt Susan, and (as she must be) his
mistress, Airs. Tremblett, become a trio of scamps.
What is it all? It maybe simply described as an incident
in the life of Joseph Tremblett, an incident which is fraught
with awful consequences to everyone except Joseph, who
momentarily renounced his principles and went au diable, but
returned safe and sound. Quite possible, but as a play most
unsatisfactory, suggesting the idea that the author had got
his characters into a hopeless mess, out of which he could
not rescue them without having to reconstruct the play
or to add an Act by way of epilogue. Who is The Perfect
Lover? Why the name? Does any one believe in the per-
fection of a love which induces a married woman to desert
her husband, and go off with her old lover, even though there
be a third person singular present to play propriety?
As I have said, all the parts are capitally played, nor must
the disreputable John Collis of Mr. ARTHUR LEWIS be omitted,
as it is one of the very best things in the piece. Miss EVELYN
MILLARD makes all that seems possible of a part that offers
few opportunities. Miss HENRIETTA WTATSON has a telling
character, and it loses nothing in her hands. Miss EVE
TITHERADGE is nice as May, the very youthful daughter, but

she has to invest with a natural air a creation that is neither
child nor woman. Miss TITHERADGF. does it well, perhaps she
may yet improve upon it; but if there be a really difficult
part in the piece to render naturally it is this.
As Lord Cardcw Mr. FRANK MILLS is excellent. That Lord
Cardcw (aged between twenty-three and thirty), being a steady,
sensible man, should be absolutely indifferent to making his
fortune by coal unexpectedly discovered on his estate, or that
he should not effect in some way a compromise between his
sentimentalism and his commercial instinct, is indeed most
difficult to admit as within the bounds of probability.
Incidentally in the Second Act, Miss HELEN FERRERS cleverly
renders an absurd vulgarian, Mrs. Morphitt, most acceptable
as some light relief to the serious interest of the play.
As to Mr. LEWIS WALLER, lie is impressively natural. His
long speeches are rattled off as outbursts of passion, which is
just what they are intended to be. There is no fault to be
found with his impersonation, except flashes of self-conscious-
ness when the personality of the actor dominates his assumption
of character. This never occurs in the earlier portions of the
play. But do not we all feel that Mr. WALLER is depriving
us of some rare impersonations by choosing plays in which
lie lias to appear in conventional modern dress? Cavalier,
Puritan, Monsieur Beaucaire, a Shakespearian character, or a
hero of romance—what you will in costume, with passion and
declamation, such are par excellence the parts for Mr. LEWIS
WALLER. But, excepiis excipiendis, modern up-to-date draw-
ing-room comedy let him regard with affectionate distrust.
At His Majesty's, Oliver Ticist is going strong. Mr. LYN
HARDING'S Bill Sikes is a performance no less striking than
Miss CONSTANCE COLLIER'S Nancy. Both these impersonations
will be ever memorable in the history of the stage, as will be
also the fine acting of Mr. TREE, whose Far/in, rendered with
hardened conscientiousness, is the most fiendish, ghoulish,
repulsively humorous villain, a perfect realization of all the
infernal, cowardly, murderously malign instincts with which
the lurid imagination of CIL\RLES DICKENS endowed this
repellent monstrosity in human form. It stands apart among
Mr. TREE'S many weird impersonations as a triumph of
histrionic genius. When ho first started in this career of
crime lie was a bit uncertain, but now he's as perfect a
devil as anyone could desire to see.
Well contrasted with this monntrumhorrendum is the Oliver
Twist of Miss NELLIE How MAX, just the very weak little
"mealy boy" of CHARLES DICKENS. Where all are so good
it is difficult to single out anyone for special praise, but
it woidd be impossible to pass over the Mr. Grimwig
of Mr. GEORGE SIIELTON, a difficult, eccentric, thoroughly
"Dickensy" part, in which with one touch of nature, when
he begs the "mealy-faced boy's" pardon, lie wins the hearty
and well-deserved applause of the audience. Mr. COSIYNS
CARR is once again to be congratulated on the success of his
remarkably clever adaptation.
IT is officially stated that the air on the Underground
Railway is becoming purer every day, but it would be
premature as yet to look for the establishment of a Garden

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
THE SPADE'S PROGRESS:
OH, HOME ADVICE TO LADY CLODHOPPEKS.
[" Spado parties represent one of the latest
outcomes of the mysterious delights of the
herbaceous border in 'week-end' country
homes, and they cost a hostess almost as much
careful consideration as the male head of the
family exercises when he makes his plans for a
battue. And the womau who is invited to
'bring her spade' feels not a little of that
sense of prowess implied which a man expe-
riences when reminded not to forget his gun."
—Lady's Pictorial.]
THE recent development of spade
husbandry in country - house society
renders it imperative to add a new
chapter or two to Mr. Punch's Book of
Etiquette. We have pleasure in appending
the groundwork or subsoil of the same.
In the first place, as smartness and
vulgarity are now practically synony-
mous, no lad}', whatever her looks,
banking account or antecedents, need be
ashamed to call a spade a spade. To
term the now fashionable plaything a
beche or a bequillc is going out of the
way to confirm the entente cordiale,
besides confusing the gardener, who has
already as much Latin as he can manage.
Young girls in their first season should
be chary of using dialect. It is at any
rate safer to make a little moue when
tossing off such phrases to an admirer as
"Fetch I the spud, matey," "Where's
the bloomin' shovel, Bill?" and the like.
Young married ladies who are sure of
their ground can of course be more racy
of the soil, as occasion demands. If their
vocabulary runs short, any enterprising
under-gardeuer will no doubt oblige with
a few private lessons.
The more considerate country hostesses
now engage "spade-caddies" for their
guests. These intelligent lads are of
service in carrying the garden imple-
ments from flower-bed to flower-bed,
and also—it is whispered—in keeping
an eye on amateur disarrangements of
the landscape. It is as well, therefore,
to take their advice as to the lie of the
various geranium or calceolaria plants
that you may propose to dig up, or when
badly bunkered, say, by a tree-root. As
the end of October approaches, there is
quite a furore for "pleasaunce-golf." j
The fun, it is almost needless to say, •
consists in uprooting a nine—or eighteen
—parterre course witli as few strokes of
;he spade as possible. It is best played j
n a foursome, as the Bogey score some-!
times runs into four figures. A practised i
golfer will of course avoid "topping"
and "slicing" her hostess's hardy j
innuals. The new lofting-spud will be
found invaluable for all doubtful strokes
•md approach shots. It will ensure the
'lying dead " of any lobelia or begonia
you may be called upon to tackle. The
'putting" into the flower-pot can then
easily be effected with a trowel.
Lady spade-wielders must be prepared
to encounter an occasional earthworm.
There is really no need for fear, as these
reptiles have never been known to bite.
With a little firmness and manipulation
the worm can usually be coaxed on to
your neighbour's patch, if you can
manage to distract her attention in the
meanwhile. It is waste of time trying
to discover which is the tail end in order
to put salt thereon. If the creature
appears recalcitrant and likely to cause
a scene, the true sportswoman will keep
her presence of mind, and retire slowly,
i and with dignity, behind the nearest
j bush. It is bad form to bandy words
or enter on a personal struggle with a
common or pleasure-garden worm.
All Indies who have any regard for
convenance should take care that the
baby-ribbons round the spade-handle
match their costume, and that ecru or
batiste fallings are continued down the
shank as far as the blade. The instru-
j ment should be carefully wiped and
scented with eau-de-cologne before being
put away in its case for the evening.
There it must be left in repose, as it is
quite unnecessary to hand your treasure
round the Bridge-table, or to exhibit it
ostentatiously, should the same happen
to be jewelled.
When digging, however dainty and
well-turned your ankles may be, do not
try to put both feet at once on the blade.
Very few ladies can successfully imitate
the spade-dance as seen in the music-
halls. Also, avoid splashing, as the
lady opposite, if you have a vis-a-vis,
may resent having a shower of mould in
her face. Practise at home until you
are proficient in the moves before dis-
playing your prowess as a clod-hopper
among the landed gentry or the horny-
handed nobility of the realm.

NOTABILIA FICTA;
Or, Wise Words of the Week.
A LESSON FROM OVER-SEAS.
THE success of the New Zealanders in
the football field is perhaps the greatest
evidence of the value of the Simple Life
that has been forthcoming in the last
decade. These stalwart Colonials, who
are always in the pink of condition,
though they wear black jerseys, have
never heard of Harris tweed or suffered
from over-pressure. Need I say more?
—Sir James Crichton-Brou-ne in "The
Daily Scare."
A LUMINOUS SUGGESTION.
The re-cementing of friendly relations
with Germany is at the present moment
by far the most important problem of
our foreign policy. As a simple but
impressive inauguration of the new era
I should suggest that the street connect-
ing St. James's and Regent Streets
should be re-spelt "German" Street.—
Lord Lonsdale in " The Spectator."
OUR FRUGAL ARISTOCRACY.
On Newmarket Heath Lord BOODLE
had only a single pink Malmaison in the
buttonhole of his exquisitely fitting pale
grey frock-coat.—" Algy" in "TJie Per-
fect Gentleman."
THE DANGFR OF "TIPPING."
Lidies do not realise how the system
of "tipping" destroys the whole spirit
and comfort of Club life. The servants
j themselves are degraded by this injudi-
: cious system. From "tipping" to "tip-
i pling" the transition only requires a
single liquid.—" Araminta" in "The
Woman Abroad."
A GREAT HISTORIAN'S JOKE.
The British cavalry, now that it is
possible to get into it without examina-
tion, may be fairly styled "Our Head-
less Horsemen."—Mr. Frederic Harrison
in " The Positivist Review."
HOME TRUTHS FROM TEDDY.
Non omnia possumus omnes. Golf is
a game for Prime Ministers, Grand Dukes,
plutocrats and professors. But a Presi-
dent might as soon do crewel work as
frequent the links. Bear-shooting, bare-
back riding,boxing—these are fitpastimes
for the leaders of men. But to waggle
a flimsy stick at a little ball and then
miss it is unworthy of the strenuous
youth of our great Commonwealth.—
President Roosevelt in "The Oi/ster Bay
Bulletin."

A VOYAGE TO THE VINES.

Aboard La Hirondelle, en route for Bordeaux, between
10 and 11 p.m.—With the exception of a group of three men
and two ladies, forming a whimpering, arguing, laughing,
earnestly chattering committee, poring over maps and pencils,
eager to hear casual witnesses and to take evidence with
advice, the majority of our fellow passengers have gradually
disappeared into their bunks. Perfectly ealm night. I
should like to read myself to sleep in my berth, but the
electric light has been so craftily arranged that I foresee the
trouble of having to get out of my berth to extinguish it.
To do this involves thorough awakening; and what is the
use of going back to your bunk when you are completely
wide-awake? I decide to renounce the luxury of reading
myself off to sleep in my bunk Will finish reading outskle:
then when sleepy will extinguish light, i.e. turn out and turn
in. This last-mentioned operation, which has to be at first
performed with the extreme caution of an amateur 'experi-
mentalist, may be ultimately achieved with consummate art.
Kneeling, bending, doubling myself up, or rather, halving
myself so that by stealthily laying myself out to advantage
on one side I may get the maximum of possible comfort with
the minimum of hopeless disarrangement of bedclothes.

on it. I close my eyes, feign perfect rest, until sleep comes
and catches me absolutely napping.

aboard fresh as larks ashore, that is, as fresh as uncommonly
well-fattened larks would be after such a breakfast. Gulls
and other sea-birds, having been out all night, look pale and
tired; they are sleeping lazily on the water, yet they keep
abreast of us.
Colonel and Mrs. Colonel are on deck.
Mrs. Colonel is in raptures about the gulls. "Beautiful!
Such poetry of motion!" she exclaims.
"Divers!" cries the Colonel. "There they go!"
There they have gone. All disappeared.
"That was a red-breasted Merganser, dear, wasn't it?"
asks the lady.
"No, dear, that was a Surf Scoter." Then, turning to
JUDKIN and myself, whose attention the Colonel evidently
wishes to attract, he says, "Curious thing, I remember off one
of the Indian Islands seeing what I thought was a Scotus, but
it turned out to be a Merganser, genus Mergus. I knew it
instantly by its bill."
"One recognises many queer birds in that w-ay," says
JUDKIN. I nod to him patronisingly, as forgiving him this
time, and the Colonel, quite oblivious of the pun, continues—
"Now a curious thing about these Merganners and the
Smew, too—by Jove, there goes a Smew!" and he points out
to us something flying away, but as it does not carry round
its neck a legible descriptive label from tlie Zoological
Gardens, we take the Colonel's word for it, and ask
inquiringly:
"What did you say the name of that bird is?"
"A Smew, Sir. Greenish patch in the eye, known in some
parts as 'loons,'—found 'em frequently in the Hebrides.
When cooked—excellent!" And the Colonel appeals to his
wife.
"Yes," answers the lady very quietly, "they are very
delicate. But, dear," she adds reproachfully, "not to be
compared with the dusty Greenshank and the Squacco
Heron!"
"True. My wife's right. The Squacco is first-rate. I'm
not sure," the Colonel says deliberately, looking round at his
audience as if to challenge an adverse opinion, "I'm not sure
that a Squacco, in autumn, isn't the best bird that flies."
His wife shakes her head at him reprovingly. "My dear
WILLIAM," she says reproachfully, "you forget the Epervier."
"Lightly done through, on toast, perfect!" cries the
Colonel. "I don't know how it escaped me. Yet it is a
curious thing," continues the Colonel, looking puzzled, and
addressing us as if for a consultation, "why the Whimbrel,
the Phalarope, the Knot, and the Dunlin, should all choose
this particular time of year to migrate, to travel across the sea,
to go to Africa, or America, or Southern Europe, so that not
one of the lot is to be found in the British Isles: not one,"
repeats the Colonel emphatically, with the air of a man
resenting a personal injury.
"Dear me! is this so?" we say, at least / do. And I
am inclined to blame Nature for not having consulted the
Colonel previous to making her final arrangements.
"It is so," asseverates the Colonel, and, warming to his
subject, he goes on putting to us questions as problems which
neither individually nor collectively are we able to solve.
"Where's your Little Grebe?" says the Colonel warmly.
"Where's your Sclavonian Grebe? Where's your Eider?
Where's your Pochard? and where—look where you will
in the north and see him every day up to now—where,"
finishes the Colonel, with an air of universal defiance,
"where is your Ferruginous Thick?" Quite a small crowd has
gathered about him and his wife, as the latter repeats sadly,
"Ah, where indeed!" At this point a perfect stranger, a
small man with a bristly beard like a convict, and a dull
grey flannel suit differentiated from a gaol costume by the
absence of the broad arrow, puts himself forward and asks in
a husky voice, " What is a Ferruginous Duck?"
But the inquirer does notj take nmch by his motion.
Everybody turns, looks at the cause of the interruption, and
laughs deprecatorily. The idea of anyone being ignorant
concerning a Ferruginous Duck! And if ignorant, why
expose ignorance by asking a question? This is conversation,
not a lecture class. So solvuntur tabula risu, and our party-
disperses itself.
"Bless you!" says the Colonel to his wife as they walk
away, "he knew what a Ferruginous Duck was well enough.
I was ready for him."
Captain TWINKLER looms gradually out of his deck cabin.
His jovial countenance lights up the deck as woidd a visit
from the rising sun. Our Captain is a man of few words,
and all to the point. Evidently he is much amused.
"Some people know a lot," says Captain TWINKLED, winking
knowingly to himself, JUDKIN, and one or two other messmates.
"I 'cl half a mind to ask our good friends if they 'd ever come
across a certain kind of old bird that ain't to be caught with
chaff!" Then he soars to regions up above, where he repre-
sents the cherub that keeps watch up aloft for the safety of
crew and passengers.
Later in the day, when we are in view of nothing except an
expanse of sea bare of any ships—and where they have all
got to is a marvel to me—coining on the Colonel when he is
"conning "—taking observations and making none, except to
himself—I ask him to tell me whereabouts we are.
"Well," he says, frowning a bit as though he might
possibly make a mistake by just the millionth part of a
logarithm as to precise latitude and longitude, "I make it
that we 're just off Cherbourg."
Our Captain happens to be passing, and to him I repeat my
inquiry, embodying the Colonel's information.
"Off Cherbourg!" repeats the jovial Captain, smiling;
"see that haze just lifting there?" I do, and as the Captain

THE COON AND THE TIGER.
A SMALL dark Coon was walking one day in the desert for
the sake of his appetite, when he ran full tilt into a large and

that he would require to exert all his wits to keep things
going on as satisfactorily as usual. And so he spoke tip in
a perfectly candid way.
j "Good morning," he said to the Tiger, who did not answer
but looked at him roguishly.
"The desert air is very fine this morning," continued the
I Coon, and the Tiger smiled in a humorous manner.
i "But I derive no benefit from this very fine air," pro-
ceeded the Coon, "for I am ill. Yes, I have taken poison!"
'he went on, with a feverish look in his deep browii eyes.
"Last night I ate a pailful of strong arsenic which I mistook
for whitewash. My physician tells me that I am so saturated
with poison that, if anything only just touches me, nothing
could postpone immediate death. If you, for instance,
touched me with your teeth only it would kill you instan-
taneously. Nothing could postpone death!"
; "Why wish to postpone death?" said the Tiger, cheerily.
i " I may tell you that I consider this meeting sheer good luck,
for I am tired of life, and came out to commit suicide ....
I Kindly stand still, so, while I spring. A little further to the

The descriptive phrase, "a lady with a leg," seems lacking in
the preciseness which makes for recognition; but the number
of ladies, with or without a leg, who on any given afternoon
would be likely to be "helped down a coalhole," must be
very small. So the good girl is likely to get her reward.
Unless—horrid thought—the leg belonged to Iwr, and she is
"wanted," in the more sinister sense, on a charge of having
used it to help the lady down the coalhole.
NATURE NOTE.—A reindeer was recently born in Edin-
burgh. The Daily Mirror believes it to be the first reindeer
ever born in the United Kingdom. What makes its position
still more exceptional is that (according to the same autho-

THE INTERVIEW THAT FAILED.
FOLLOWING the somewhat indistinct
directions of a small and impertinent
errand boy, we sought out the Great
Man's chambers, and knocked at the
Great Man's door. Receiving no answer
or assistance from within, we admitted
ourselves, and beheld the Great Man
seated at his desk, with his back
towards us. For a while we stood
unobserved, till at last, by coughing for
a third time with offensive noisiness, we
attracted his attention.
Without turning round, he addressed
us in the following gracious and out-
spoken manner . ..." I have paid my
Income-Tax, I cannot give you bread,
money or Hospital Tickets, nor do I
stand in need of anybody's Back-Ache
Pills. You need not, therefore, stay."
"Excuse us," we replied, "we are
neither tax-collectors, beggars nor touts."
"In any case," he said,'' you will find
the door behind you."
Encouraged by this genial welcome,
we proceeded to the object of our visit,
and arranging in our minds a series of
questions as to the Great Man's past,
present, and probable future, his own,
his wife's, his children's, and his ser-
vants' Domestic Pets, we opened with
the usual question:—"You are, we
believe, the renowned Mr. ETTSETERKR?"
"I am," he replied, "not."
Feeling that further interrogation was
as unnecessary as it would be impolite,
we wished our host a cordial "Good-
night," and, whistling merrily, took (nil-
leave.

We find this mem.: "Her pallid face,
Thanks to a rare mysterious smile,
Was rescued from the commonplace;"
And (being there when this occurs)
The hero, twine his heart in hers.

Observes a glory in her eyes

A grace attends her every act;
One notes when she begins to talk
The compromise of truth and tact;
While half her beauty seems to dwell
In what is termed a "subtle spell."
Till when at last the loyal swain
Has squared it with the archer-god,
And Love's true course runs smooth
again
After 300 pages odd,
When bells unite the lucky brace
And "Finis" stares us in the face—
Once more we mark the well-known tints
Connected with a peach's bloom,
The eyes that drop celestial hints,
The Peerless Type, in fact, on whom,
Lit by the sun's ingenuous glare,
There shines the usual golden hair.

MY TAILOR'S BILL.
'Tis ever thus. My noblest aberration
Results in wisdom—after the event;
I never yet conferred an obligation
Of which I didn't bitterly repent;
I never paidw* tailor's bill
(And after this I never will!)
But that I shivered for the precedent,
e o o o o
Brief was the scene, yet moving while it lasted.
At the first shock, when he beheld the Boon,
The noble fellow looked quite flabbergasted,
Turned a pale green, and seemed about to swoon;
While all his chorused tailorhood
Marvelled, and praised me where I stood
Balmily beaming, like the bland, grave, Moon.
Anon, with watery smile and due obeisance,
He bore the rare and curious receipt,
And gave me peace; and I, in full complaisance,
Patted him thrice; and moved upon my beat,
Exuding merit, till the mood
Waned, and I felt strange doubts obtrude,
If, in my action, I had been discreet.
True that to such impulsive generosity
Self-approbation lends a fleeting charm,
Yet, save we learn to curb impetuosity,
Our afterthoughts will fill us with alarm:
For pauper's dole and Tailor's cheque
Alike may bring a soul to wreck,
And Charity may do a power of harm.
Ay, many a vessel's lot has thus been blighted;
Men have been moral, even to excess;
When lo! a windfall came! They got excited;
Threw off their cloak of frugal stodginess,
Rose up, and did so carry on
That they, and all their dross, have gone
Down to Gehenna, leaving no address.
I trust that no such prodigal backsliding
May lure my gentle Tailor to his fall.
The loss of one so patient, so confiding,
Would do me injury beyond recall.
His homely faitli is much to me;
And, failing him, I fail to see
Whom I should honour,'how be clothed withal.
And what if in his breast the Dun should waken?
What if I have but edged his Vampire-tooth?
And he should be so grievously mistaken
As to seek blood—more blood; and. void of ruth,
With foul and ghoulish lust assail
His unsuspecting clientele?
The dear gods hold him! This from me, forsooth!
Myself, I fear him not. But much I tremble
Lest he should pass the news to other ears,
And round my gates a ravening horde assemble,
Sharp with the concentrated hopes of years,
Thinking (vain optimists!) to find
Their patron squeezably inclined,
Till I be wearied of their vile arrears.
It is such doubts as these that come in legions:
Such thoughts as these that pierce me to the core;
While deep, deep down in mine interior regions
I hear my muffled inward monitor
Mourning the loss of such a sum
To that financial vacuum
Which, as a child of Nature, I abhor! DuM-Duw.
OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday, October 14. — Rigdletto, that melodramatically
effective opera, to-night. Madame MELBA singing; but even
this, somehow or other, does not bring an overwhelming
crowd. Yet the prima donna is a favourite, the opera is
popular, the story well known, and Le Roi s amuse in French,
and The Fool's Revenge in English, have yet some hold
on the stage. Can it be that the public, regarding the
printed programme of the week's work, is suddenly struck
by the awful appearance of a black hand with index finger
sternly pointing to a notice stating that the Management
earnestly requests every one to remain until the end of
the last Act, or to turn themselves out, as neatly as possible,
"during the interval immediately preceding it?" Laudable
in intention, but absolutely impracticable. Who that cares
for music and money, will consent to-lose any part of what
he has purchased simply for the convenience of others who
certainly are utterly indifferent to what may become of Mm as
long as he doesn't bother them? Why not let the vendor at
the ticket office ask, "Can you remain till the end?" If
the reply be, "I and my party must leave just when two-
thirds of the last Act are over," then let seats be allocated
to them in such a part of the house as will not be disturbed
by their departure. The outside numbers of the Stalls, the
back row of the Grand Circle, and certain Balcony Stalls, will
meet these requirements. The occupants of Private Boxes
can come in and out as they like (quietly, of course) without
causing inconvenience to anyone. And remember, those who
I wish to support the Opera for the love of music are at liberty
j to take their seats, pay their money, and stay atcay altogether
1 should they consider that their leaving too early, or arriving
j too late, might possibly interfere with the enjoyment of
others. However, "that's as may be," and so back again to
i the Opera, though this notice must necessarily be somewhat
belated, as, if Itigoletto be given again, the cast already
announced will be somewhat different from the one now under
review.
As Gildn, MELBA at her very best. Yet the audience did
not respond. And this indeed is the summary of the even-
ing's entertainment. Signor GIORGINI, as our friend R Duca,
did not make his hit until the last scene with Maddalena
(Signora ARANDA, who has a fine contralto voice), when he
fully atoned for any previous deficiencies.
As Rigoletto, Signor STRACCIARI was passable; "compari-
sons are odorous." Signor DIDUR'S rendering of the music of
Xparafticile was excellent. Apparently Signorina CAPELU'S
view of the wicked old, or very middle-aged, Giovanna (do we
not remember Mile BAUERMEISTER'S sordid avarice in this
part?) is that she belongs to the soubrette order of light
comedy. Such a novelty in rendering this part seemed to
make Signorina CAPEI.LI somewhat nervous.
During the week the operas represented have been Trova-
tore, Manon Lescaut, Aida, La Tosca and Un Eallo in
Maschera, whose record will have been already found in
these "notes."
Inciting to Crime.
THE Daily News gives publicity to a letter "just received
from Johannesburg by a prominent British politician." The
writer, in language at once legal and colloquial, describes
himself as "an interested party re the treatment of Chinese,"
and goes on to say: "I would not be a bit surprised to see
them (the Chinese) rise some night and murder half the people
of the country, and as far as I am personally concerned, they
would be quite justified." What the writer has done to merit
such violent conduct does not transpire; but even so, one can-
not help feeling a strange admiration (faintly indicated by the
italics) for the gentleman's astonishing frankness.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LILLIAN.
IV.—A RIVAL IN THE FIELD,
IF ever I find the author of Jane
Hen-inrj, I shall probably treat him to
something in the half-Nelson line. At
present I am looking for him.
In Jane Hen-ing the hero starts on
page 253 pretending that he loves some-
body else—Margaret to wit. On page
289 the heroine is in his arms, full of
remorse, jealousy, love, hysterics and
other emotions. At page 299 I closed
the book and said to myself, "This is a
good thing. I will go and do likewise."
The difficulty in my case was to find
the Margaret. There was simply nobody
in the neighbourhood that
LILLIAN would be jealous of;
and, anyhow, all the single
ones were engaged about
three deep. Ours is rather the
county for that sort of thing.
After thinking it over, I
decided to pretend that there
was somebody in town who
loved me. I had, and indeed
still have, a very regular corre-
spondent in the West End,
who writes most charming
little notes. (The last one
said: "Referring to our re-
minder of last month, may we
ask what you propose to do
in the matter?" The obvious
answer was: "Let's go on as
we are.") As a reward for
Ids perseverance he should be
my Margaret.
For the next few days I
acted my part before LILLIAN,
and TKKE himself in a new
make-up wouldn't have done
it better. I used to take out
my letters and sigh, and read
them over and over, and then
sigh again—and I give you
my word that before the week
was over LILLLVN was caught. "Who
is she?" she asked suddenly, and I got
out the landing-net.
"Who is she, DICK?"
"Who's who?" I said, which, is
really a quotation.
"Is she dark or fair?"
"I don't know what you
said, pretending to lie
harassed.
"Dark, I expect."
"Then you 're wrong. She's got blue
eyes, and the loveliest golden hair."
"Beautiful figure and all that?"
"Divine," I sighed, with a far-away
look in my eyes.
"And I suppose she thinks games and
all that awfully wrong for women, and
walks about in a stately way—"
"She's most fearfully good at golf," I
put in.
"What's her handicap?"
"Scratch."
"Scratch?"
"Oh no, let's see, it's three, I think."
Three sounded so much more truthful
somehow. Any fool could think of
scratch.
"Very clever?"
"Not so very,"
I said carefully. I
wanted her to seem decently human.
"What do you mean by 'not BO
very'?"
I hadn't expected to be cross-examined
like this.
"Well, what do you mean by clever?"
I said, rather smartly, I think.
"Does she make her own things, and
so on?"

awfullv em-
yes.
That

"Oh,
them."
"Which?" said LILLIAN.
I looked sharply at her. "Really," I
began.
"Musical?"
The technicalities of music always do
for me.
"No," I said, emphatically. I thought
it safer.
"I suppose she can sing in tune?"
"I suppose so," I said crossly.
"Well, that's something."
There was silence for a little. I
didn't quite know what to do. I lit a
cigarette.
"What's her name?" said LILLIAN
suddenly.
"Name?" I repeated vaguely,
"Nomenclature," said LILLIAN.
"Er—ETHEL."
"ETHEL? I know one or two ETHELS.
I wonder"
"That is to say, I call her ETHEL," I
went on hurriedly. "Her real name is
HENRIETTA—HENRIETTA DAINTIIY."
"Which is why you call her ETHEL"?
"Well, I couldn't call her HENRIETTA,"
I said sharply.
"And when are you going to see her
again?"
I felt on safe ground again.
"Next Wednesday," I said. "I'm
just running up to town, and we shall
probably do a lunch and a matinee
together."
"Wednesday? Why, how splendid!
Father and I are going iip on Monday
for a week. We might all have tea
together."
"Well, ETHEL is not quite
certain yet whether it will
be this Wednesday or the one
after. She says here "—I took
a letter from my pocket —
"now where is it? Oh yes—
she asks, in fact, what I am
going to do about the matter."
"What matter?"
"Matinee was what I said.
I am reading her actual words.
'What do you propose to do
aboiit the matinee?''
"Well, what do you pro-
pose?"
"I think we shall get better

"Well, I suppose she'll write
and settle it definitely?"
"Oh yes," I said confidently.

up to town. My last words as
I saw her off were, "It will be

morning I got a telegram. I
opened it, and gasped. It ran:
"Please call for letter1 at
Post Office. Forgot your
address in the excitement of hearing
from you so soon.—HENRIETTA DAINTRY."
As soon as I had recovered I made for
the Post Office. I went in feeling—and,
I expect, looking—an absolute idiot.
The grocer's daughter, who manages the
P.O. side of the place, smiled all over as
she handed me a letter with "To be
called for " written on it. I took it away
into a quiet corner of the grounds, and
read the following:
"DEAR MR. DICK,—I may call you Mr.

day after all! I will meet you at Prince's,
and we will go to the Haymarket after
lunch. I shall be wearing my hair dark,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Discovery, which set forth in the summer of 1901 to probe
more deeply the mystery of the Antarctic region, triumphantly
accomplished her mission. Captain SOOTT and his dauntless
crew came nearer in touch with the South Pole than the foot-
steps of man had hitherto carried him. Through two perilous
winters, with the temperature so far helow zero that the
record seems fabulous, they made sledge excursions into the
unknown. They added a new territory to the British Empire,
naming it after King EDWARD, who, with the QUEEN, was
among the last to bid the explorers farewell when, from snug
anchorage at Cowes, they sallied forth. They solved the
mystery of the Great Ice Barrier that baffled Sir JAMES Ross.
They came upon a magnificent mountain region undreamt
of in man's geography. They enriched Science and Natural
History by many prizes taken with dredger and gun. Here be
great achievements. But my Baronite regards as their supremest
triumph the testimony, splendidly renewed, of the indomitable-
ness of the Britisher when he takes a tough job in hand.
In his record of The Voyage of the Discovery (Sunn, EIJ»:R)
Captain SCOTT, whilst simply narrating the daily doings of
himself and his companionship, makes light of danger and
discomfort. Only once does he comment unfavourably on
the situation. To do him justice, it was comparatively early
in the voyage, before he had become inured to his hourly
privations. As he was prospect ing for safe harbour through the
coming winter, a furious gale swept down. The ship was in
close contiguity to a dangerous ice-floe, above which towered
many bergs. So little control had they over the ship they
could not alter their course by tacking. The wind blew
with the force of ninety miles an hour. As evening fell
they were helplessly driven down on a line of pack among
sevei'al small bergs, raising in the driving gale clouds of
spray that froze as it covered the anxious crew. This is
pretty bad: so bad indeed that it leads Captain SOOTT to his
solitary protest appearing in a book of a thousand pages.
"Our situation was not pleasant," he writes. Pleasant is a
good word. After this it is comparatively naught to read of
the captain, caught in a blizzard, jotting down in liis diary
the remark, "I shall remember the condition of my trousers
for a long time, they might have been cut out of sheet-iron."
Or again, in other circumstance of temperature, "If one
exhales a deep breath one can actually hear one's breath
freezing a moment or two after it has left the mouth." The
South Pole is all very well in its way. But to stand about
en route in sheet-iron trousers listening to your breath freezing
is a stiff price to pay for nearer acquaintance. Captain SOOTT
set forth to beat the record on the southward track through
Antarctic wilds. Hungry, thirsty, frost-bitten, scurvy-smitten,
snow-blinded, he won his way. Not less plucky and uncom-
plaining were his officers and crew—a dauntless company
worthy of such leadership. Written in the simple literary
form in which brave men naturally narrate their doings, no
more glowing narrative of adventure is to be met with in the
English language. Its value is vastly augmented by nearly
300 photogravures and sketches, some in colours, taken on
the spot by Dr. WILSON and Chief-Engineer SKELTON.
When folks get to praising a writer called "HANDASYDE"
It shall certainly not be my function to stand aside.
"To praise him (or her) I am all the more willing
Since his volume (or hers) costs no more than a shilling.
It is just—so to speak—a collection of posies,
As fragrant as thyme, as attractive as roses;
And the angriest man will abandon his scowls
As he reads The Four Gardens (it's published by FOULIS).
Mr. ANDREW LANO has edited The Red Book of Romance
(LONGMANS), but he _ tells us that "the stories in this book
were done by Mrs. IANO out of the old romances." It is a
delightful book, full of gallant adventures, great excitements,
fights, magic, splendid knights and lovely maidens. Mr.
HENRY FORD has adorned it with beautiful pictures. Alto-
gether it is as good a six-shillingsworth as any one can want
to buy.
Most of us read Sir FRANK BURNAND'S Records and Remini-
scences (METHUEN) when, in 1904, they appeared in a
couple of volumes. Having in eighteen months run through
three editions, which shows the public knows a good thing
when it sees it, they are now being brought out in cheap
one-volume form. Those who read the story before will
like to renew the pleasure. For those who did not earlier
read, my Baronite advises them straightway to run and order
the book. Thus it will come to pass that, as of old times,
he who runs may read.
Rarely nowadays do we get anywhere within hail of
Christmas without being reminded of one of the most charm-
ing of all charming legends associated with the festive season
by having brought before us some new edition of WASHINGTON
IRVING'S immortal story, Rip Van Winkle. This present edition,
produced by Mr. HEINEMANN, is worthily got up, its first merit
being the finely-printed and thoroughly legible letter-press.
Mr. RACKHAMisin the main to be congratulated on the artistic
character of his distinctly original illustrations. Unqualified
praise the Baron can confer on all the drawings for their skill
and technique, but he feels that the artist has in several
instances failed to catcli and reproduce the overpowering awful-
ness of the author's weird idea. The very last effect that the
sight of these quaint grim-visaged old phantoms, solemnly
playing their thunderous game of bowls, had on Rip, was to
make him Laugh. He was overcome with fear. About his
gnome-like guide, for whom Rip carries the keg, there was
something "that inspired awe and checked familiarity." This
gnome, as represented by Mr. RAOKHAM, is an odd-looking
pantomimic mannikin, decidedly comic. When Rip finds him-
self among the queer goblinesque assemblage "his heart,
bounds within him and his knees smite together." Nothing
grotesquely ludicrous in this description; yet Mr. RACKIIAM'S
representation of it is more suggestive of a comic nightmare
than of any thing fearful. But apart from these dealings with
the supernatural—a very difficult matter—Mr. RACKHAM'S
illustrations are charming in design, tone, and colour.
Mrs. COULSON KERNAHAN has a delightful touch when deal-
ing with ordinary country life in Ireland, and it is just this
capability of hers that makes some chapters of A Village
Mystery (F. V. WHITE & Co.) pleasant reading. . Otherwise
the story is somewhat dull. "Missing caskets" are well-
worn conventional "properties" of melodramatic romance,
but the incidental sketches of genuine Irish character are the
story's apology.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, practised novel readers in want
of a relish, allow the Baron to recommend you The Vampire-
Nemesis, and other Weird Stories
of the China Coast, by DOIXY THE ^^^ , BARON
(author of Clrina Coasters),
which, contained in one small
pocket-volume of Arrowsmith's
British Library, will hold you
enthralled for just about an hour
before going to bed. That is the
time for reading Tlie Vampire
and Death Grips. To ladies,
perhaps, the place for settling
down to these weird stories is the
bed-room, before a good fire,
within easy distance of bed. DE' ^Sg^I^' B.-W.

INTELLIGENT ANTICIPATIONS.
[Adapted from Lard Rosebery's speech at Stourbridge.]
MY Liberal brethren, we are on the eve
Of such a boom in styles of long ago
As you might possibly not well believe,
Unless your old friend came and told you so:—
A boom that gratifies us all the more
After the weary slump that went before.
Ask not the warrior blinded with the fight,
Who scarce can gather how the day has gone;
But rather those that from a distant height
Enjoy the vantage of the looker-on;
Ask me., in fact, who have at leisure brooded
Over the dismal decade just concluded.
I say the Tory citadel is doomed
(I have observed the slain as thick as flies);
And from its ashes, when the place is fumed,
I look to see a peerless structure rise;
Even the phoenix, cited in the fable,
Will stand abashed before that Tower of Babel.
Already I remark that certain folk
Clamour for booty in the by-and-by,
Itching, like Homer (Little Jack) to poke
Their thumbs within the half-baked Liberal pie;
It does disgust me when I see a comrade
Showing such greed about a private plum-raid.
For who can gauge our strength when all is done?
Men cut their clothes according to their stuff,
And our desires may reasonably run
To trousers, yet the cloth be not enough;
And then our Party—so experience teaches—
Will have to be content with Irish breeches.
One awful heritage we have to face!
England has earned the enmity of some;
And we must therefore use, to meet the case, *
Infinite tact in perils bound to come
As the result—if I foresee the end—
Of making everybody else a friend.
Well, we must try and see the country through
This legacy of danger, nor decline
The claims of pledged affection, though 'tis true
Such things are not in our peculiar line.
Whose forte has ever been to keep the nation
Orbed in a sphere of dazzling isolation.
Further, the Government will have to cope
With the great mass's more immediate needs;
And here our various leaders rightly hope
To find a common ground in all our creeds;
It is their dream to have the country fed
Gratis on most enormous blocks of bread.
But, since the people's stomach ill would thrive
If on their nobler parts no care were spent,
We shall, for good example's sake, revive
The pristine dignity of Parliament,
And what of manners used to be the code
When last a Liberal Party set the mode.
Where is that ancient pattern stamped so clear
As in our leaders (few. I grant, but fit),--
REDMOND, the glass of fashion, yet austere?
LLOYD-GEORGE and WINSTON, types of courtly wit?
Where is the old-world grace more fine and rare
Than that of CAMPBELL-B., the debonair? 0. S?.
NATURE STUDIES.
THE JSVXSSSE DOR&B OF THE VILLAGE.
Lono GRANVILLE relates (the letter is printed in his Life)
that when JOHN BRIGHT dined at Osborne he amused Queen
VICTORIA by quoting to her his brother's remark:—Where,
considering what charming things children are, do all the
funny old men come from. For myself 1 have often wondered
how a village child, which is normally a pleasant, cheerful,
well-mannered little specimen of its tribe, can ever develop
into a thing so obtrusively disagreeable as the hobbledehoy
who haunts the village corners on Sunday afternoons and
evenings. How this same hobbledehoy ever becomes a steady
respectable member of the male community is a matter even
more surprising.
It is, as I say, on Sundays, that the members of our jeunessc
doree emerge into the light. It is possible that during the
working days of the week they are tradesmen's assistants or
industrious doers of such other jobs as the village affords;
but it is quite impossible to recognise any traces of a useful
and laborious life in the surly Adonises who, with shiny
faces, bright and meretricious ties, stiff and inconvenient
clothes, creaking boots, and slabs of hair ("quiff" is, I
j believe, the technical term) plastered down upon their fore-
I heads, infect the Sunday air with their coarse loud jests
and their studied air of uneasy defiance to all powers
human or divine. There is a butcher's lad with whom
I often exchange the salute of courtesy as he drives a high-
j paced pony along our roads. He smiles, we both smile,
i as the good-mornings pass between us. He is a courteous
| youth, and it is a pleasure to receive and acknowledge his
i greeting. Sometimes, when an unkind fate has forced me
i to pass a group of the Sunday gilded ones, I have vaguely
imagined that in one of the scowling faces I caught some dim
familiar marks reminding me of this not unamiable boy. If
it be indeed he, I know not why he puts off his courtesy with
his working clothes, and why he considers a garment of
defiance to be the only suitable wear for one who has
belaboured his hair with grease and stuck a straight-cut
cigarette between his lips.
The time spent by these young men at their corner is
almost inconceivably protracted. It cannot be that they
delight one another's thirsty souls with the sparkling waters
of intellectual conversation. Coming upon them unawares I
have occasionally overheard their remarks, and, if I may infer
the whole from the part, I judge that they mostly tell one
another that "ELF 'ad a proper ole beano last night;" or
• that " 'ERRY'S gal—'er with the nose—fetched 'im a cop o'
I the jaw;" or again that "I tole 'im I warn't goin' to 'ave
| none of 'is lip and when 'e giv me some of "is back-talk I
i jest called 'im a blanky mole-ketcher." With the inter-
i change of such light-hearted railleries the hours are sped
! upon their way; and, having seen them morosely eyeing the
'world and one another at 11.30 A.M., you will come upon
them in the same attitudes at 3.30 P.M., and again at 6 P.M.
It is just possible that they may have budged during the
intervals, but, for myself, I do not think they have. Some
unearthly messenger, I believe, deposits them there as a living
warning during the morning hours, and fetches them away
again after their duty is fulfilled and when the rest of the
village is wrapped in sleep.
I am told that the country and its villages are losing their
interest for the male portion of our youth, and that the towns
are overcrowded with those whom the rural parts need.
For the jeunesse doree of such villages as I know, nothing,
so far as I can judge, has ever had the least semblance of
interest (I speak only of Sundays, remember), and no human
force could uproot them from their stands at their favourite
Sabbath corners. Now and then a soldier or a sailor, a
native of our village, cornea to us on a visit, and it is not

OPERATIC NOTES.
Tucxduy.—Very fine night; as indeed it ought to be,
exceptionally fine, for the public appearance of a Butterfly in
(Went Garden. And let Signor PUCCINI,Messrs. KEXBLE and
FOIISYTH, and every one concerned, lie heartily congratulated
on the excellent performance of Madama Butterfly. Not for
one night only by any manner of means, as seats being in-
sufficient for the crowd on Tuesday, the Hiittrrjli/ had, willy-
nilly, to come out for another duller on Thursday last (also
is announced lor next Tlmr.sday's matinee), ami when or
where the Butterfly will ultimately settle is a matter lor the
syndicate, which may consider their "catch of the season"
to be this tine Japanese specimen. The house, crammed
and jammed, was enthusiastic. The presence of Her Majesty
the QUEEN added additional brilliancy to what was already
exceptionally brilliant. The staging of PUCCINI'S work was
admirable, and Conductor MUGNOXE has added another note
of honour to his operatic score.
As Cio-Cio-San, Signora GIACHETTI, singing and acting well-
nigh to perfection, may be described as rendering the little
heroine almost great. It cannot be forgotten that Madame
DESTIXX originally played and sang this part, her singing not
being quite on a par with her playing; and to have proved
herself a rival of so distinguished an artiste may indeed be
accounted as something for Signora GIACIIETTI to have achieved.
Madame GiuiiERT-LEJEL'NE's Suzuki is already well known
here; her impersonation had lost nothing of its intensity,
nor her voice of its charm. Siguor ZENATELLO was good as
Btttterfly't lover, Lieutenant Pmkerton, U.S.N., but he was
not a second CARUSO. The role of Mi: Sharpless, U.S. Consul
at Nagasaki, was perfectly rendered, both as to singing and
acting, by Signor SAM MARCO. Uncommonly fortunate were
the United States, at the period of this story, to have possessed
such a representative. After Act I. the Fall of the Curtain
was followed by a tremendous Rise in the enthusiasm. The
arl'txtes, every man and woman of them, were true to their
calling, and being summoned by the delighted audience at
least five times, responded as often and as quickly as if every
fresh .summons had been a legal one.
The parts of lesser importance- it would be incorrect to
describe them in an opera as "the minor parts"—were
played and sung excellently. Signorina MANAKINI was delight-
ful as Kate Pinkerton; Signor BADA very good as Goko, as also
was Signor NIOLA representing 11 Principe Yamadori, Butter-
fly's rejected lover. From first to last the entire perform-
ance of this opera must be recorded as a big success for all
concerned, and in our opinion a large share of such success
was due to the Cio-Cio-San of Signora GIACHETTI.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A VOYAGE TO THE VINES.
No. IV.
Aboard L'Hii-ondelle.—During the day the amusements on
board are much the same as on other vessels several times
larger. There are Quoits for those who affect that game of
skill, and Cricket with a stick and a very soft ball, played
in the space between the first and second-class divisions.
There are cards, a smoking-room, and a ladies' small saloon
with a piano in it. This instrument is apparently patronised
by two or three sets independently of one another. "Set A.,"
for example, has its singers, pianists, and audience all com-
plete. During this concert " Set A." has the saloon entirely to
itself, and enjoys its own performance. "Set A." having
retired, "Set B.," so to speak, "takes the flure," entirely to
its own satisfaction, with a totally different entertainment.
"Set A." has solo pieces, classical, an occasional solo song,
and a duet or two, Italian. "Set B." avoids the classical,
indulges in pianoforte duets, solos (English), trios, and
boating quartets. If " Set A." listens to "Set B." it must be
at a distance outside, as none of that party are in the saloon;
and precisely the same thing happens when the '' B." tap is
turned on.
The remainder of the passengers, sitting out on deck, keep
open ears and an entirely open mind.
"Well," says the Captain, smiling, to me on Monday, the
second morning of our voyage, "how did you like the Bay of
Biscay?"
"You don't mean——"
"Yes I do," returns the Captain. "We were in it yester-
day, and we're out of it now. Terrible place, eh?"
"If the Bay ever wants a good character," I say, heartily,
"let it come to me."
"Don't be in too great a hurry," says JUDKIN; "remember
you 've got to get- back again."
Better defer final opinion until I am safe at home again.
"Uncommonly pretty country on this side," I say, pointing
to the left bank as we enter the mouth of the river Gironde.
"Very," assents the Colonel, after an excellent breakfast.
"But not much t'other side. Prettier still farther up and
right away in the distance over there," he adds, directing
our attention to a blurred landscape hazily visible in the
distance.
"You 've been here before?" says JUDKIN inquiringly.
"Been here before !" echoes the Colonel, and then answers
his own echo with a most hearty "Rather!" bestowing upon
his audience, which gradually increases while he imparts us
his information, a knowing look as if he could tell them a
thing or two about this country if he liked.
"You know it then, I venture to guess?" says JUDKIN
suspiciously.
"Know it!" repeats the Colonel, in a lowered tone of
almost affectionate regard. "My dear Sir, I've been here—I
and my wife—have been here since—('the Conquest,' murmurs
JUDKIN)—well, we 've been here at different times ever since
I was a small boy."
"At school here?" asks JITDKINT, deferentially.
"No, Sir," answers the Colonel, raising his voice as he
quits sentiment and comes to mere statement of fact, "I was
at school in England—Rugby and so forth. My parents, who
were rather French than English, owned the greater part of
that land there," and lie scoops a large space out of distant
space. "Beautiful woods, capital shooting, and one or two
vineyards producing a grape called Monceil, which, if it could
be grown in any quantity, would give Lnfitte a second place."
"I never heard of it," I say, with an effort to recall some
items on the Club wine list.
The Colonel excuses me. "Very few hare heard of it
except the natives, or anyone who has travelled all over the
pluce as I have. Delightful recollections!"
"I suppose you haven't been back here for years?" asks a
casual listener.
"Not to reside," the Colonel explains, "but to stay here
for weeks, or months, every year. I may say of myself, as I
said of my parents, I am more French than a Frenchman."
"Vous en mez I'air, M. le Colonel," says JUDKIN.
"Quite so," returns the Colonel, glancing at my friend out
of the corner of his eye; "the air is perfect, most healthy."
JUDKIN coughs drily. "All I ask for is fishing, shooting,
boating. In fact, sport."
"What shooting did you get out there?" inquires a tall
burly man with little bright inquisitive eyes, turning his
gaze in the direction indicated by the Colonel.
"Oh," replies the Colonel, "pretty well all sorts."
"Wild fowl? "asks the big man, earnestly pursuing the
subject.
"No end," answers the Colonel, "and not infrequently
Dotterel, Snipe, and a lot of small birds, rather like Wagtails,
peculiar to this country, which I 've never seen anywhere else."
"Beaucoup de Maereune?" inquires JUDKIN.
"They may be so. I 'm not quite sure," answers the
Colonel guardedly. JUDKIN nudges my elbow to intimate
that his next question is only part of an artful scheme.
"And how about les Roiteletg and les Choucas?" JCDKIN
wants to know.
"Well, it is not a great place for them," the Colonel, on
reflection, must candidly admit.
"Point de Becasse?" asks JUDKIN.
"Aha!" says the Colonel knowingly, but I am inclined to
think that he adopts this mysterious manner because he has
failed to understand the question, and is rather shy of being
forced to request JUDKIN to repeat it.
"Any Woodcock?"asks the burly man, deferentially.
"Oh, as to Woodcock, now you're talking," replies the
Colonel as if the subject had now been mentioned for the first
time.
JUDKIN appears amused. So am I, on his subsequently
referring me, in strictest confidence, to a list of birds in an
old French-English conversation book.
Our Captain has descended the staircase from his observa-
tory and, unnoticed save by two or three of us, is leaning
against the capstan, occasionally passing his hand over his
lips, while his eyes, on catching those of JUDKIN and myself,
give an extra merry twinkle.
The Colonel, unaware of the Captain's proximity, has an
audience all eyes and ears. Outside this semi-circle is JUDKIX,
with the air of a cynical Mephistopheles awaiting an oppor-
tunity. Captain TWINKLER appears to be watching the
mano?uvres of some sea-fowl as illustrating, so he puts it
afterwards, various flights of fancy.
"You see," the Colonel is saying to his audience, pointing
to a bifurcation of the river, "the stream is divided at that
point."
"Where are we now?" asks an interested inquirer.
"Noic," returns the Colonel, addressing the casual inquirer
in an authoritative tone, "we are in the river Garonne, which
is split in two, as it were, by an island—capital shooting and
fishing there—where I used to spend my holidays when I
was a lad."
"What's the name of that island?" inquires a little
scrubby-bearded man, note-book in hand.
"Name?" repeats the Colonel; then, before any one can
utter a word, he says, with the air of a man putting a stop
to all debate, "its name is Massidan, and," he goes on
quickly, "it was near there, at a place called Brircn, that \vp
spent our honeymoon."
"No, not Brives, my dear WILLIAM," interrupts, hesi-
tatingly, a gentle voice. It is that of Mrs. Colonel BICKERSTIFF,
very much muffled up; both the voice and the lady.
"My dear!" protests the Colonel.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"Brives," continues his wife, very
gently, "is beyond Perigueux, a long
way."
The Colonel yields at discretion.
"Very likely, my dear," he says, in
an offhand manner; then he distracts
the attention of his audience from what
may prove rather dangerous ground by
peremptorily requesting them to notice
how the river, which leads to Bordeaux,
being divided by a peninsula, has an
entirely different name before it has done
with us. "There," says the Colonel,
indicating the stream just mentioned,
"is the Yon."
"Not the Yon, WILLIAM," pleads his
wife.
"Yes, yes," he returns testily, and is
alxmt to enlarge on the text, when
Captain TWINKLER, indicating the penin-
sula just mentioned, observes,
"Don't think you 've been ashore
there for some time, eh, Colonel?"
"Why?" asks the Colonel, turning
on him with some asperity.
"Well," answers the Captain, who has
unrolled a map, and with the assistance
of JUDKIN is keeping it open before him
on the capstan (or whatever it may be,
as I make no pretence towards special
nautical accuracy), "the river Yon is
a precious long way behind us, and
Brives is half again as far dliead of
us."
"Is that so?" asks the Colonel sus-
piciously.
"There's no contradicting the chart,"
returns the Captain, apologetically.
The Colonel admits the authority,
and having examined the map he hands
it back to Captain TWINKLER.
•'And where are we now?" sternly
puts in the big burly man, who a few
minutes ago had been subserviently
inquiring about Woodcock, with a look
towards the Colonel, and in a tone that
gives us all clearly to understand that
his confidence in the Colonel has been
rudely shaken.
"Well," says Captain TWINKLER de-
liberately, and giving the map as corro-
borative evidence, "we are now in the
river Gironde. We've passed Royan,
which serves as a sort of Brighton to
Bordeaux; that's where they get the
excellent little fish, Royans. At that
point," which he indicates witli his
finger, pointing it out in the distance,
"jutting out some way ahead of us, the
Gironde becomes the Garonne, on the
Bordeaux side, and the Dordogne on the
Boury side."
"lea, that's the division, of course,"
exclaims the Colonel emphatically, yield-
ing to the weight of evidence against
his previous assertions. Then, genially,
addressing the few left of the crowd who
but twenty minutes ago had been ready
to pin their faith on him, the Colonel
says, "Impossible not to get names and

Foreigner (icko has "pulled " badly, and hit his partner in a tender spot). "MlLLE 1'Aiiimv-,
MONSIEUR! MY CLOB—HE DECEIVED ME!"
places a bit mixed up when one is con-
stantly on the move."
But the confidence of even the most
stalwart has been hopelessly undermined,
and one by one they desert him and
walk towards the other end of the vessel.
JUDKIN and self remain. The Captain
addresses Mrs. Colonel and her husband.
"Nothing easier," says the Captain,
consolingly, "than to get names a bit
wrong now and then. Maybe Madame
and you, Sir, would like to refresh your
memory with the maps? We shall be
in before dinner time."
"At Bordeaux?" asks Madame.
"Yes, certainly," answers the Captain.
Whereupon with many expressions of
gratitude the Colonel declines, for the
present, to avail himself of the chance
of putting his geography in order before
landing, as he would rather bestow all
his care on his luggage, in case, as he
says, "our good friends should arrive
suddenly, when, by permission of the
Douane, we might be able to leave the
ship to-night." And as the unexpected
happens and the good friends arrive,
Col. BILLY and Mrs. BICKJERSTIFF are
enabled, by the kind offices of Captain
TWINKLER on their behalf with the
Douane, to take their departure within
an hour of their arrival at Bordeaux.
Subsequently everybody goes ashore
for the avowed purpose of stretching
their legs, returning between ten and
midnight, considerably fatigued by the
operation, but much delighted with the
brightness of the town, the Cafe's, the
Restaurants, and such amusements as a re
going on in Bordeaux.
Still more Commercial Candour.
A NORTHAMPTON tradesman gives pro-
minence to the following notice :—" No
person can be supplied with fireworks
under thirteen years of age."
After so fair a warning the purchaser
has only himself to blame if these
antiquities refuse to go off.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY OF A
LIVELY SCHOOLMASTER.
October 25.--Have just read WELLS'S
article in the Westminster Gazette. Yes,
there is no doubt about it, we are a
dull lot and largely responsible for the
stupidity and inefficiency of our pupils.
Still, it is never too late to mend; I am
only twenty-nine, and surely not too old
to cultivate the vivacity and indepen-
dence which are bound to react upon the
boys in my form. I have decided, there-
fore, to remodel my life, conduct, and
teaching on the general principles indi-
cated by WELLS, and henceforth it will
be my aim,
(1) To become an Authentic Man.
(2) To eschew the obvious and conven-
tional in dress.
(3) To proclaim my adhesion to So-
cialistic principles.
(4) To affront public opinion at least
once a week.
(5) To cultivate a vivid and "prehen-
sile" style.
(f>) To forswear fly-fishing and take
to flying-machines instead.
(7) To write a good and lurid novel.
October 2C>.—One must make a begin-
ning, and I made it today. Went into
early school in knickerbockers and a
frock-coat. Slight fmeute amongst the
form, which I soon quelled by handing
round a box of cigarettes, and observing
that, as Liry was a dull dog, I proposed
to devote the hour to reading extracts
from the Memoirs of Casanova. Com-
plete success of the experiment. Occupied
the last quarter of an hour in explaining
to the form the duties of the Authentic
Man, and the stimulating effect of a life
of crime. Hearing, however, at break-
fast in common room that the Headmaster
had got wind of what 1 had done,
resumed iny normal garb for 10 o'clock
school and exacted a pledge of secrecy
from the form. How contemptible are
these evasions! But one must go slow
at first. Nemo repente fuit Ivrpisslmus.
October 28.—This being a half-holiday
I went up to look on at a house-match
and created some excitement by booing
at intervals and crying out "Muddied
oafs!" Evidently, however, the boys
really approved of my criticisms, for I
distinctly heard one of them reply to
one of my sallies, "Good old Ruffles!"
Raffles, as I subsequently learned, is
a successful gentleman burglar in a
favourite work of fiction, so that the
compliment was obvious.
Took preparation in the evening and
caned a boy for addressing me. as "Sir,"
explaining that I preferred to be called
by my Christian name or, if they pre-
ferred it, Raffles.
October 29.—Sunday. Obtained leave
of absence and went up to town, where
I inarched in a Socialist procession,
lectured in Hyde Park, and dined at an
Anarchists' Club in Soho. Travelled
back first-class with a third-class ticket
as a protest against the cowardly con-
formity of a sophisticated civilisation.
On reaching my rooms, feeling that my
style was growing more prehensile, sat
down and began upon my novel. Before
going to bed, wrote an anonymous letter
to the Headmaster telling him that he
was a lifeless twaddler, whose grovelling
deference to decorum was as dangerous
as it was disgusting.
October 30.—Went into morning school
without a collar. Enlarged on the
moral of the phrase splendide mendax
which occurred in the HORACE lesson,
pointing out that while it was per-
missible to be strictly truthful in small
matters, lying, to be efficient, must be
on a large scale, and that in the noble
words of WELLS, in these days "an un-
blemished record was mere evidence of
the damning burial of a talent of life."
Read aloud to the form the opening
pages of my novel, In Quext of Crime,
in Avhich the hero commits bigamy while
still at a private school. My young
auditors were strangely silent, but
applauded the poem which the hero
recites on his eleventh birthday, ending:
"Down with the crumbling fabric of the ages,
Down with the Old Creed, and up with the
New."
October 31.—Pioneers must always be
martyrs. At second school to-day I found
a round robin on my desk signed by all
the form. It was short but very much
to the point. "Dear Raffles" it ran,
"we like your cigarettes and can put up
with your clothes, but if you are going
to give us any more of that rotten novel
we shall simply let the Head Beak know
all about your goings on. There are
occasions, as you have told us, on which
it is permissible to tell the truth." In-
formed the boys that I would let them
have my answer to-morrow. Wrote at
length to WEI.LS explaining the situation
and asking him for advice by wire.
Noi-ember 1.- No wire from WELLS.
Distributed copies of Tlie. Clarion and
Jimtiee in the quadrangle after tea.
Dined with the Headmaster. Took the
opportunity of asking his wife if she
had ever loved unwisely. She bridled
and said, "Really, Mr. JOPP, you do say
such extraordinary things !" but evaded
my question.
November 4.—Received letter from
WELLS—really most offensive. He says:
"I am afraid that little good can be
expected from your belated and isolated
experiment. Besides, your respectable
antecedents and unblemished record
render you quite unfitted to assume the
role of a liierophant of antinomianism.
Your style, again, is almost as non-prehen-
sile as that of Mr. GILKES of Dulwich, and,
in short, I cannot honestly encourage you
to head a rebellion against that dulness
in which you are obviously steeped to
the lips. Boys who are to be free,
masterly men, must hear free men talk
freely of religion.of philosophy, of conduct.
Yon are at best the semi-serf of a vicious
tradition, and had better either resign
the attempt or your mastership." Con-
found the fellow! If he was within
reach he 'd soon find that my style was
prehensile enough!
Xorember 5.--Announced to my form
abandonment of experiment. Burned
WELLS in effigy.
SOCIETY CHATTER.
(From thf "Side-Glancer"—tcith which ie
htrorporated "Back Starea.")
SOME HOUSE PARTIES.
THERE were a good many house parties
for Midchester Races. Unfortunately,
the particularly cheery one at Larkington
was by way of being marred by the bad
form of an outsider. He was only
invited for his Bridge-playing; but
outsiders are never safe. One evening,
when everyone was tired, too, with
playing catch in the passages, he began
to hold forth about the Empire and its
Defence, of all stodgy, middle-class
subjects! Lord LAKKINCTOM apologised
to his guests later, and it seems the
person left next day.
At Rippintowers very good fun was
enjoyed one evening, when everyone
put on pinafores and bowled hoops
up and clown the picture-gallery. Mr.
"Baby" St. AVBYN, whose colt " Rotter"
had won the Midchester Cup in the
afternoon, showed splendid form with
his hoop.
WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOIKQ.
There is no doubt Hoop-bowling has
caught on. Indeed, it, is by way of
becoming quite an obsession witli some
people. Many smart women are having
dresses built specially for it. The most
C/M'O is a sort of Bloomer dress, in fine
cloth or velvet; tall bronxe boots are
worn with it; and gauntlet gloves and
a baby-boy's hat complete a costume in
which a pretty woman, with nice feet
and ankles, looks really "devy."
Lady THISTLEDOWN is doing a long
rest-cure. Everyone sympathises so with
her over the regrettable conclusion of
TJnstledou-n v. Thistledown and Hmiinq-
ham. A good deal of indignation is felt
at the merciless cross-examination she
underwent at the hands of Mr. LASHER,
K.C., which is directly responsible for
the fainting fits she has suffered from
since. Lady THISTLEDOWN, who is one of
the prettiest and most popular women
in Society, will pay a round of visits
when her rest-cure is completed, and
will then go to Cairo for the season.

A ROMANTIC ENGAGEMENT.
Smart Whispers is quite wrong in
speaking of Captain "DOLLY" DE LACY
as the fiance of Lady "DICKIE" SANDYS,
Lord and Lady RAMSGATE'S pretty
daughter. It is to Lady "DICKIE'S"
grandmotlier, POPSY, Lady RAMSGATE,
that the popular young Guardsman is
engaged. The happy couple have been
overwhelmed with "Congrats." by their
hosts of friends. They were dining at
Fitz's the other night, POPSY, Lady RAMS-
GATE, looking radiant in a picture frock,
with some pretty bits of jewellery, and
her hair dressed in the new bebe style.
WHKUE PEOPLE AKE.
Though Society is scattered up and
down the land, there are quite a good
many people in town just now. The
Duke of DUNSTABLE was alighting from
a hansom at the entrance of the Senior
Fogeys' the other day, and paying the
cabman with half-a-crown, or a two-
shilling piece, I can't be sure which,
but I think the latter. TRIXIE, Lady
LARKINGTON, was whizzing along Picca-
dilly on her motor-cycle, with Captain
MA.SHEM in the trailer. (By the way, her
action for libel against The Planet for
mentioning her, in describing her grand-
son's coming-of-age festivities, as the
Dowager-Countess, will not come on, a
settlement having been effected.)
Mrs. "Croppy" VAVASSOE, in smartest
bkck with something pinky in her toque,
was shopping in Bond Street; and quite
a number of smart women were at ULQA
FITON'S, looking at some simple little day-
frocks she is showing at quite absurdly
low prices (from forty guineas upwards),
and at her novelties in cigarette-jackets,
chatting-coats, and other pretty-pretties.
DANCING PEOPLE.
Mrs. "Bosh"
impromptu dance
TKESYLLYAN'S little
in Hill Street the
other night was quite a cheery affair;
i indeed, she is making quite a little
reputation for these "spur -of -the -
moment" parties. Though the invita-
tions were only sent out the day before,
and simply consisted of postcards with
"Come and twirl" on them, everything
was quite beautifully done, the dancing-
rooms and supper-room being made
pretty with red and white "mums." It
was quite a "boy-and-girl" dance, no
one much over fifty being present.
The "Hopeless Sufferers" are to be
aided by a Fancy Head Dance next week,
which promises to be a very smart affair.
Several hostesses will give "Hopeless
Sufferers" dinners, and will take on
parties.
THE INDUSTRIOUS HEN.
["The Swiss village of Zofingen, in the
Canton of Aargau, was decorated with flags
yesterday in honour of a hen which had laid
its thousandth egg."—Daily Express.]
HER thousandth egg! To what a height
May perseverance mount!
Did she with this result in sight
Maintain a careful count?
Nay, rather let us think of her
As careless of applause,
And heedless of the civic stir
Her industry might cause.
Could any hen foresee the fame
A feat like this would bring?
I 'm confident no fowl could claim
To think of such a thing.
Like that of SCOTT'S Last Minstrel one
With truthfulness may say,
This surely must have been an "Un-
premeditated Lay!"

THE MACDUFFER GOES STALKING.-No. 4.
HOWEVER, FORTUNE AT LENGTH FAVOURS THE BRAVE, AND A LUCKY SHOT(!) BRINOS DOWN nis FIRST STAG.
AFTER THE LONG VACATION.
DULL earth, dull sky, a world forlorn
Of Nature's rich Autumnal hues;
No chant of birds at early morn,
No meadows bright with glistening
dews;
No lowing kine upon the lea,
Wherever that may be.
Vista of chimneys, rain-wet roofs,
Of slippery streets and swaying vans;
The hoot of horns, the clang of hoofs,
Rattle of chains and milkmen's cans;
The steady swish of wheel-flung slime
That hits you every time!
And this is London —this the spot
That, just a week ago, I swore
Outclassed with ease the fairest grot
That ever faced a classfc shore,
Whose air (T said) for giving tone
Surpassed the raw ozone.
Prreneste (better known as Deal)
And Tibur (sometimes called Herne
Bay)
I wearied of; I ceased to feel
The charm of three full meals a day;
Those early hours of healthful rest
Became a perfect pest.
Then I arose betimes to lave
My shining shoulders in the sea,
Or in a scarlet surcoat drave
The whistling cleek-head from the tee;
Or launched my bark upon the brine,
When it was nice and fine.
And when September drew to an end
And wood and coppice ruddier
gleamed,
I stayed in Berkshire with a friend;
(How long the Long Vacation seemed !)
And fished for percli and sometimes shot
A rabbit for the pot.
He and his wife both exercised
Arts that I scarcely could resist;
They gave a dance and organised
A concert, and Progressive whist;
But still a sense of vague unrest
Harried their homesick guest.
And when I said to them "Good-bye,
The 24th will soon be here;
The Courts will open then, and I
For business reasons must appear,"
They both expressed profound regret,
But didn't seem upset.
0 brief delight too swiftly sped,
0 disillusionment profound!
1 mark the leaden skies o'erhead,
1 note the dreariness around,
And lor! (methinks) I was a flat
To hurry back like that.
Yonder the "sunward sailing cranes"
In Aldwych Street swing far and near;
The latest Music Hall refrains
Are whistled rudely down my ear;
Competing cocoa shops exude
Odours of steamy food.
The motor-'bus goes tootling by,
The hoardings make a braver show;
All the old sights and sounds that I
Desired so much a week ago
Are calling me, and yet somehow
I don't enjoy them now.
I want the smell of fallen leaves,
The windy upland's wide expanse,
The robin perched upon the eaves,
The winter gnats that whirl and dance,
The high wind singing through the
trees,
And the ensuing sneeze.
0 Human Nature, dark, bizarre,
Still wanting what it hasn't got,
What discontented things we are,
When tliou dost call; but there, I 'm
not
Fit to philosophise: instead
1 think I '11 go to bed. ALGOL.

altogether long ago. But Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES, who recently
professed to be about to give up this sort of entertainment,
knows exactly how, where, and when to renew youth wherever
alterations and repairs may be required. The work is the
production of one PAUL RUBENS, in three parts; associated with
our sporting Colonel, NEWXHAM DAVIS, and the poetical PERCY
GREENBACK. PAVL RUBENS is not a writer of whom it can ever
be said that he does things by halves, yet in this instance he
lias done half "the book," half the lyrics, and all the music!
And though the name of RCHENS is indelibly associated with
the painter's art, yet here the brilliantly effective scenery is
the handiwork of the brilliantly effective Messrs. HAWKS
CRAVEN and J. HARKER.
G. P. HUNTLEY, as Oroya Broivn, is immense; GEORGE CARROLL
is capital as Corporal Ham; and the humorous singing of
MAURICE FABKOA lias lost none of its great popularity. Mr.
R. ST. GEORGE is very funny as the Old Family Butler. Miss
ZEVA DARE plays, sings and dances The Madcap to perfection;
"What woman dares, ZENA dare!" Susan is a (GABRIEJIE) RAY
of light comic opera; Miss KATHLEEN WARREN as Mrs. Layton,
the wife of the Colonel, is everything that a Colonel could
wish for; and there yet remains to be mentioned somebody

THE "HOW TO" PAPERS.
No. II.—How TO TRAVEL BY RAIL.
RAILWAY travelling is a diversion of
comparatively modern growth. In the
days of Queen ELIZABETH, for instance,
nobody thought of indulging in it, but
during the last century the taste for this
amusement assumed such alarming pro-
portions that the State had to step in
and insist upon a special Act of Parlia-
ment being passed before any single
new railway could be constructed. Tkis
law, however, does not apply to switch-
backs.
It is a well-known fact that when
once the first step has been taken
nothing can stop the passion for railway
travelling. Notwithstanding the large
yearly loss of life and limb contingent
on this recreation, almost every man,
woman and child in the United King-
dom or elsewhere habitually travels by
rail, and there is, therefore, no reason
why a short treatise on the subject of
how to travel properly should not be
penned, seeing that the public appetite
is now beyond control.
It is needless to say that a large and
popular literature has grown up around
such a popular form of amusement.
Excellent recreative reading is provided
by Kradshaw's Railway Guide, and the
novice should provide himself with a
copy of this entertaining work. In spite
of its light and airy style it is a masterly
treatise, and fresh editions are called for
and eagerly taken up once a month all
the year round. They are usually issued
in paper covers, but there is no reason
why one copy should not last a life-time
if re-bound and kept on a dust-proof
shelf. It might be as well, then, to
acquire one by purchase, and the price
charged is not excessive; but if the
incipient traveller is not an habitual
book buyer, he might order a copy to be
included in his next parcel from MUDIE'S.
Having acquired your Bradshaw and
read up the subject, let us suppose that
you wish to make a trial journey from
London to Southampton. A very good
train for the purpose starts from Waterloo
- -the station, not the battlefield of that
name—at ten minutes to five, and, after
a short stop at Winchester for afternoon
tea, arrives at Southampton at twenty
minutes to seven, or thereabouts. Y,ou
decide, then, to travel by this train, and
nothing is easier if you know how to set
about it.
First engage a cab to take you to the
station. This process has been fully
described in a former paper. When you
arrive at the station yard, a subordinate
official called a "porter," and attired
accordingly, will come forward to welcome
you on behalf of the railway company,
and will assist the cabman to lift your
luggage off the roof. He will say,
"Where for?" and you will reply with-
out hesitation, "Southampton," for his
enquiry will not be dictated by mere
curiosity, but will arise from a sincere
desire to assist you. You will now pay
your cabman and get as quickly as
possible out of earshot of his consequent
remarks.
Your next objective will be the ticket
office. This is a little hole in a wall, on
the further side of which a member of
the peerage, shielded from attack by a
barrier of wood and wire, is privileged
to charge a large price for a tiny slip of
cardboard which another official will
take from you at the end of your journey.
Say in an audible but not stentorian
voice, "Southampton, single," and, if he
is not engaged at the moment in con-
versation with a brother peer and is
satisfied with your appearance he will
name a sum of money which you must
be prepared to pay without demur, for it
is useless to try and bargain witli him.
There will be a shelf in front of you on
which to place your money, and on it
probably a small brass plate with an
inscription requesting you to examine
your change before leaving. You will
comply carefully with this request. The
people behind you who also wish to take
tickets will behave with wonderful
patience while you go thoroughly into
the matter.
Once seated in the comfortable little
room, a series of which composes the so-
called "train " in which you are to make
your journey, your duty will be to
make yourself agreeable to your fellow-
travellers. This may be done in several
ways. One of them is by affable con-
versation. If there should happen to be
an old gentleman seated opposite to you
who has supplied himself with a collec-
tion of evening papers in one of which
he has immersed himself, open the ball
with some remark bearing on the pre-
vailing climatic conditions, and do not
be deterred from pursuing the subject
by a grunt in lieu of an answer, or an
apparent disinclination on his part to
encourage you. Your reward will come
when he gathers up his belongings at
Winchester and beats a hasty retreat,
leaving his seat vacant for you to put
your feet upon for the remainder of the
journey. Take care, also, to be politely
firm with regard to sucli matters as
raising or lowering the window next to
you. The right attitude will assure your
having your way without recourse to
physical force, but it might be as well to
run your eye over the proportions of your
fellow-travellers before determining to
set your own inclinations against the
combined will of the rest of them.
A last word of warning is necessary
as to carriages labelled " Smoking." If
you are not a tobacco-smoker do not
select one of these. The railway com-
pany's favourite penalty of a sum not
exceeding forty shillings is not enacted
if you do not smoke in these carriages,
neither are you required to go back to
the place from which you started and
pay two counters into the pool. But
you will have no right to object to the
fumes of your neighbours, and this may
annoy you. A penalty is insisted on if
you allow a natural inclination to cut
the seats and cushions of the carriage
with a knife to get the mastery over you.
You will find a notice under the hat-rack
expressing in strong terms the company's
dislike of this practice. It is well to
take heed of this, for, the law being
what it is at present, you must be pre-
pared to put up with these petty restric-
tions, or you may find yourself in
trouble.

LILLIAN.
V.—THE INTRUSIONS OF HERBERT.
GRACE'S idea of "helping" me with
LILLIAN was to go up to town with ARTHUR
and stay there; leaving LILLIAN and me
alone in the country. (Except for LIL-
LIAN'S father, who is reading the Ency-
clopedia right through, and can hardly
be said to count.) Of course we did some
rather sporting things together, as I hope
to show you, but the immediate result
was the affair of the ducks; and as this
is a matter somewhat on my conscience,
I feel that it will be better to get it off
at once by full confession.
GRACE amuses herself in the country
by keeping ducks. In the
ordinary way I am not allowed
to do more than look at them.
It is a very arbitrary line that
she has taken up, and I sup-
pose it is because she once
found me feeding the goat out
of my pouch. Albert Edirard
was lapping up the mixture
like anything, but I think
GRACE'S indignation was un-
necessary; because, as I told
her, I couldn't possibly afford
to make it a regular occurrence
tobacco being the expensive
thing it is. However, GRACE
chose to take a lofty attitude
about it, and said that in
future I wasn't to touch any
of her animals.
But when she went up to
town for the winter, and left
me in possession, she came
down from the pedestal, and
asked me as a special favour
to take care of her ducks. I
Eromised to do my best, and
>r a time, with LILLIAN'S
help, gave the ducklings
quite a classy diet—things
that could never have occurred
to them when in the egg. ~
There was one little chap in particular,
Cecilia was liis name, that shaped
splendidly, and increased an inch round
the chest in three days. I give you my
word.
When there is a tragedy looming, 1
hat" the author who tries to break it
gently to his readers. Ho let me Shy at
once that LILLIAN had a dog called
lli'rbcrl (after an uncle), and Herbert in
the dead of Dlglltcaiue nnind to me, and
ate twelve ducklings, including Cefilla,
1 heard a row, and caught sight o[ tin;
brute making tracks.
Next morning when I found the
damage I wrote a very formal note to
LILLIAN, asking what she proposed to do
about it. She replied that she didn't
propose to do anything, but woidd I let
Herbert buy me twelve new ducklings?
I said, certainly, but they must really be
new ones, and not old ones dug up.
Well, we got twelve more, and I didn't
think GRACE would mind, because it hadn't
been she who had been so keen on
Cecilia. But the night after, Herbert
came round again and ate them, which
quite destroyed the effect of his little
present. I sent for LILLIAN at once.
"Now then," I said, "what are you
going to do? A week ago Herbert ate
twelve of my ducks."
"But he saved up his pocket-money,
and gave you twelve more," said LILLIAN.
"And then he ate those."
"Well, he paid for them."
"You can't have it both ways," I
began.

OVERHEARD IN THE PARK.
French Bulldoy. "PAKPOX, MONSIEUR, YOU HAVE ZE TIE n
OF Ylll'B NEl'K."
"It isn't as though they were really
your ducks," said LILLIAN.
"It isn't us though they were Her-
bert*" 1 said, "although he seems to
think so."
"Don't get cross."
I wasn't getting cross, but there, were
one or two things I wanted to say, and I
.said them. I pointed out that here was
my Hwter-in-luw trying to breed duck*
for prolil or show purposes; that during
her, I hoped only temporary, absence
from the country she had left me in a
position of great confidence and trust
with regard to them—a trust that,
through no fault of mine, she would feel
to have been misplaced. And I added
that there was such a thing as a dog
whip and a good strong chain.
LILLIAN said that here was a quiet
and well-behaved dog, called Hei-bert
after an uncle, taking health - giving
walks around the pleasant country-side,
and wherever the poor animal went
somebody kept putting coveys of ducks
in his way. And she added that there
was such a thing as indigestion.
I said that there seemed to be two
ways of regarding the situation.
LILLIAN said: "Bother the situation,
what shall we say to GRACE?"
"There's nothing for it but the
truth," I said.
"Is it as bad as that?" asked LIIXLVN.
"And we could have made up such a
fine story about their having tried to
swim the Channel, and the Kentish
mermaid's gallant effort—that's Cecilia,
you know—and"
At this exciting moment
the postman came.
"Now," I said, "here's a
letter from GRACE. Listen.
'Dear old DICK, I do hope
you and LILLIAN—' oh yes,
well, that's not very interest-
ing. We pass on to—yes,
here we are. 'P.S. —How are
the ducks?'"
I turned to LILLIAN.
"P.S.—How are"! the
ducks?" I said, sternly.
"We—we shall have to ask
Herbert, sha'n't we?" asked
LILLIAN, doubtfully.
"I shall reply, 'P.S., Herbert
has eaten ducks.'"
"She won't know who
Herbert is. I have only had
him a week."
"Why did you ever have
him ?" I said bitterly.
"I don't know. We aren't
a bit fond of each other. I
don't suit him somehow."
"You might punish him
by c.dling him Bert," I sug-
gested cruelly. I 've noticed
that there's only one adequate
- repartee to "BERT." And

I leave it to you,
that's'
painful.
"No. I shall gi
Liu.ux.
"Who to?"
"I don't know,
partner in crime."
Well, I thought of various people, and
finally suggested H.\YI.IX<;. H.VYUNQ is
our Vicar, and collects dogs. He can't
pronounce his " r's," and by some extra-
ordinary ill luck all his dogs have rolling
"r's" in their names. I thought he
would like a dog called Herbert for a
change. Also RULING once proposed
to LILLIAN. "Love me, love my dog,"
and so forth, you know.
"Mr. HAYLING?" said LILLIAN doubt-
fully. "I don't much care for him,
DICK. He isn't a very nice man."

"But Hei-bert isn't a very nice dog," I
reminded her.
"Oh, well."
That evening I wrote to GRACE:
"P.S. The dog Herbert has eaten vour
ducks."
The next evening—there was no
collusion, I swear it—LILLIAN wrote to
GRACE. I give an extract:
"Oh, by the way, Mr. HAYLING has
such a nasty, big, bad-tempered dog
called Herbert, that is getting itself
disliked. You know how fond of dogs
he is. I'm sure Herbert spends the
sermon in the vestry, he takes him
everywhere. Isn't Herbert a ridiculous
name for a dog? Do you
remember my uncle HERBERT?
You asked me what my new
dog was like. He's a dear
little fox-terrier. What shall
we call him? DICK thinks
Cecilia, but he's rather got
Cecilia on the brain just
now. I don't know who she
is . . ."
I went iip to town for one
night and saw GRACE. I
started about the ducks, and
she said, very indignantly,
"Never mention Mr. HAY-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
ONE.of iny retainers has been reading Dan Lena, by J.
HICKORY WOOD (METHUEN & Co.), and reports as follows: Even
those who only knew DAN LENO as he appeared on the stage
felt a peculiar affection for him and were impressed, con-
sciously or unconsciously, by something kindly and lovable
beneath that wildly or pathetically absurd personality. And
it is no small tribute both to author and subject of this
biography to say that no one can read it without feeling that
this impression was true; that DAN LENO was no less lovable
off the stage than on.it.
The hardships of his childhood and youth only gave him
a kindlier sympathy for children. Prosperity, when it came,
neither hardened his heart uor swelled his head.
A great part of the magnificent salary he received in his
later years he gave away in charity — not always wisely —
though, as Mr. WOOD relates, there were countless cases of real
distress which he relieved with a generosity that, had it
rested with him, would never have come to light.
Of his spontaneous and genuine humour, apart from his
stage work, Mr. . HICKORY WOOD gives abundant instances.
Most delightful of all is the description of DAN LEXO as Chair-
man at the Music-hall Benevolent Fund Dinner, with a tall
and lugubrious toast-master, whom he accused of "clowning
behind his back," and was perpetually turning round upon,
in the well-affected hope of catching him in the act. "' He 's
too quick fur me,' he explained with a sigh, after a prolonged
st.vutiny, which the other endured with unimpaired gravity."
The boo A is copiously illustrated by photographs, and those
r-presenting DAS' in the costumes he wore at C'oveut Garden
M.ills will c.)ine as a surprise even to those who remember his
extraordinary skill in "making-up."
It was astonishing enough to the audiences who saw him
as Mother Goose to find that he had suddenly transformed
that quaint visage, with its deeply-lined creases, its small
melancholy eyes lit by a gleam of goblin fun, and its extensive
mouth, into the face of a young and lovely girl.
But who, without the evidence of these photographs, would
have imagined that he could also disguise himself as a life-
like Indian squaw, a quite sufficiently Shakspearean Richard
the Third, or a really dignified and picturesque Nelson 9
In DAN LENO the stage lost a true artist and inimitable
humorist, whose premature death has left us all the poorer
in laughter. Only too often the fame of sucli a comedian
survives him merely as an oral tradition which is received
with incredulity by a rising generation that knew him not,
and declines to take him on hearsay. One is glad to think
that, this in not likely to be the case with DAN LENO. Mr.
HICKORY WOOD'S excellently written volume should keep DAN'S
memory green for all who had the good fortune to see him on
tlif boards, while to those who had not it will give some idea
of the joy they have missed.
Mr. STANLEY WEYMAN breaks new ground in his latest
novel, Starrecrow Farm (HUTCHINSON). He is equally success-
ful in finding it fruitful of incident and character. The
scfne is laid in the neighbourhood of Windermere, of which
there are many pleasant peeps. The period lies in the good
old times, illuminated by the muskets fired at Peterloo upon
a half-starved, altogether seditious mob. If my Baronite
were in a complaining mood, he might suggest that the
picture would have been more attractive were its sombre shade
relieved by occasional lighter episodes. But Mr. WEYMAN
set himself to tell a gruesome story, depicting the manners of
the time, and has triumphantly succeeded. With admirable
skill he throughout makes his heroine the pivot on which
the action of the story moves. One of the best characters in
the book is the red-waistcoated Bow Street runner, of whose
combined shrewdness and ignorance a picturesque study is
presented.
As readers of his masterpiece, Tatterley, know, Mr. TOM
GALLON is a great hand at weaving a plot round a dual entity.
In Meg the Lady (HUTCHINSON) it is two women whose personal
appearance suggests an ingenious plot carried through to its
happy end with unfailing energy and resource. That the
whole business is essentially improbable does not detract
from the interest of the story. As far as my Baronite is
acquainted with their habits, ladies of title do not leave a
comfortable home and go forth on an undesirable errand,
leading them into dire peril in a London slum, from
which they deliver themselves by slaying their assailant with
a crack on the head delivered with the assistance of a
fortuitously handy wine-bottle. In dedicating the book to
a nameless woman, Mr. TOM GALLON avers that in the main
details the story is true. That may be so. What is more to
the point is that it is interesting.
A Cumberland Vendetta (CONSTABLE), by JOHN Fox, Jr., is
without very much substance, but the story moves swiftly,
and there is colour in it. Its title may mislead the un-
suspicious Briton. It is not a tale of the'lakes and fells of
his own Cumberland, but is located on the high banks of a
river of that name in Kentucky, where the ashes of an old
family feud, revived by the war of Korth and South, and
still smouldering at its close, burst into final flame and so
die out. Novelists of the New World should never be hard
pressed for ambiguity in the choice of their titles. My
Nautical Retainer ventures to offer a few suggestions—the
geographical directions in parentheses not being designed
for publication. Thus: Called back to Home (Ga.); A Sage
of Athens (Ala.); The Ringing Plains of Wind;/ Troy (Pa.);
By the Waters of Syracuse (N.Y., junction of Erie' and
Oswego canals); On the Wires from Berlin (Wis.); The
Lif/lits of London (Ont). The principle might be extended
to include the proper names of celebrities :—The Truth about
Bacon (Va.); In the Dark Places of Brotcning (111.); A Study
of Reynolds (Mo.); The Expectations of Nelson (0.); Scots
u-ha hae for Bonnie Dundee (Mich.); The Purging of Pitt
(N.C.); The Last Phase of Xapoleon (Ark.).
The Cardinal Moth, by F. M. WHITE (WARD, LOOK & Co.).
The Baron, in giving a certain qualified recommendation to
this book, says, if those who love sensationalism at all hazards,
can go pluckily through the earlier part of this story, they
are pretty sure to find it to their liking, and will not blame
the bard for thus drawing their attention to it.
The Baron welcomes a brilliant-covered picture-book, from
Mr. Punch's Office; edited by 1C. V. LITAS, illustrated by
OLGA MORGAN, and entitled Mr. Punch's Children s Book. Now
who are "Mr. Punch's children?" Or, rather, who are not?
Such children don't exist. So let 'em all come. They will
find the writing of this book so bright that the black-
and-white cuts illustrating the first story by E. V. LrcAS arc
comparatively dull. The other illustrationsjarejdelightful,
as, for example, "More of u-hat ..
Amelia used to think," and
especially those to "Belinda's
Clock," which are full of
humour. But the literary
sparkler which, without a single
illustration, is a brilliancy all
to itself, is "The Tragedy of the
Candles." It is " a true story,"
and having just given you this
hint the Baron congratulates
those who shall become, by deed
of gift or purchase, lawful pos-
sessors of copies of Mr. Punch's

on the development of the young woman (from Qirton or elsewhere) in

WHEN the brave knight would risk his akin
For joy of her he loved the best,
It was his lady's use to pin
Her favour on hia helm, or chest;
And murmur " When the trumpets sound,

Ride forth, for my sweet sake, and pound
Your adversaries to a jelly!"

And if he weltered in his gore
She swooned away from sheer annoyance.
To-day the knighthood's mailed fiata
Grapple no more the lusty lance,
No more along the tourney's lists
The foaming steed delights to prance;
In padded ease we sit about,
Exertion being apt to bore us,
And send our women-agents out
To fight our mimic battles for us.
Not theirs the pluck of martial JOAN
Nor yet Penthesilea's thews,
Although their hose, in point of tone,

Armed only with a fountain-pen,
And fenced with whalebone-wrought cuirasses,
Yet have they arts, unknown to men,
That simply subjugate the masses.

At throat or waist, on aleeve or head—•
A primrose in the hair, a hat
Shaped like a quartern loaf of bread—

I see to what these motions tend;
I know the way that wedges work,

She will insist on Female Suffrage.

To stay her ardour; no, my fear is

NATURE STUDIES.
Mr DIARY.
I SUPPOSE that we have, nearly all of us, at one time or
another, kept a diary, and most of us, I am sure, have sooner
or later made the discovery that a diary, far from being a
mere assortment of paper meant to be scrawled upon, is in
reality a living and breathing creature, sometimes friendly,
more often hostile, but always inexorable whether in affection
or in enmity. It is, of course, no light tiling actually to
start a diary. Anybody can say to himself (or to his friends)
"I am going to begin keeping a diary." He can go on
saying it in the same airy manner for months and months
until those with whom he holds intercourse begin to believe
that he really sits down every evening and makes entries
about the events of the day :—" A very methodical business-
like chap is WILKINSON," one will say to another; "keeps a
diary and all that." "Fancy that!" says the other. "It
must be a great change for him. Regular harum-scarum
fellow he was too when I first remember him. But, of
course, he's getting on in life a bit now. S'pose he "11 be
marrying someone next—eh, what?"
That kind of thing is easy; but to keep the diary, to write
in it with pen and ink, to record events in it, to pour out
thoughts and feelings upon its innocent pages—hie labor,
hoc opus est, and yet, as I say, we nearly all of us do it with
a fairly light heart, and not one of us suspects until it is too
late that, instead of starting a diary, he is creating a tyrant
more oppressive even than the CZAR before he had listened to
M. WITTE and promised his infuriated subjects a constitution.
How well do I remember the evening when I first blew the
breath of life into the lungs of my own particular autocrat!
It was the first of January. All my necesaary work had
been done, all my letters had been written. Everybody else
had gone to bed, and the house was lapped in a winter silence.
A bright moon was making ahadows outside. I remember
pulling up the blind to observe it. As I rose from my arm-
chair with the purpose of going to bed myself, my eyes lit
upon a writing-book. Somebody (I have never discovered
who) had laid it on my writing-table. It lay open at its first
unsullied page, and the light from the lamp shone upon it
with a glitter that, now that I think of it, was weird and
almost unearthly. Without realising what I was doing I sat
down at the table, took a pen, and a few moments afterwards
these simple, but, in their consequences, fatal words stared
me in the face:—
"Monday, January I.—Not a bad day. After breakfast
went to skate. Fell down twice in doing threes. Mrs. BORRER
broke through and took a lot of pulling out. Late for lunch.
Mother rather sarcastic. A regular menagerie came to tea.
W. F. C. was there—pretty, and a very nice voice. Family
dinner. Began keeping diary."
Then I closed the book, placed it in a drawer, and in a few
minutes was sleeping calmly. From that moment I have been
a slave.
If there is one thing that is more certain to occur in a
diary than any other it is this :—You will keep it with perfect
regularity for, say, a week. Then for some unaccountable
reason, a caprice, a whim, an indigestion it may be (on the
part of the diary, I mean), it suddenly refuses to allow you to
write in it. There is no warning. You sit down to it, take
the book out of the drawer and then put it back again with-
out an additional word; or, in aggravated cases, you do not
even dare to remove it from its receptacle. You just sit in
an armchair, smoking some form of tobacco, think of the
diary for half a minute and then forget all about it. This
sort of thing may go on for a fortnight. In the interval you
may inherit a fortune, marry a wife, take a new house, or be
bitten by a dog, but it is quite certain that no entries will
be made in your diary until it has recovered from its ill-

By that time' you will have forgotten^ most of the events and
the order in which they happened, and you may be reduced
to some such miserable paltering entry as this:—"Nothing

manner really pays for its keep. I doubt if it does, but that
is the only way in which I at any rate can keep it.
On the other hand, when life flows with a calm and even
current, you will generally find Unit your diary has developed
a passionate eagerness to be taken out and written in at some
length. You may as well gratify it at once, for, even if you
go out to a dinner or a concert or a dance in order to
avoid it, you will have to humour it before you can lay your
head on the pillow. If you really want to get rid of it
altogether you might try writing sentiment or criticisms of
books in it for two or three days. At the same time you
must remember that such drastic measures are effectual only
with young diaries. A diary that has passed middle age is
impervious. It will accompany you and rule you for the rest
of your unhappy life.

A VOYAGE TO THE VINES.
No. V.
At Bordeaux.—Au revoir to the Hirondelle, by which I
hope to return. A dapper young manager (which sounds
somewhat like an adaptation of the inquiry in the old song as
to " hearing of a jolly young waterman ") presents himself, with
a card, as M. ALFRED VAUBERT, on behalf of M. JOLLIDOIS, and
is entirely at our disposition; he professes himself, with the
utmost heartiness, as ready to wait for us (" us" meaning
friend JUPKIN and self), to accommodate his time to ours, to
take us about—to be, in fact our guide, philosopher, and
friend, until fate do us part and he shall have deposited us
safely at the chateau to which we are invited. We are only
too pleased. There is no further trouble. Douaniers are civil,
porters are ready, coachman delighted (as he has had to wait,
and now has to drive us some distance), and so, with M.
ALFRED VAUBERT, we rattle along uphill through the streets of
Bordeaux until we arrive at the Gare St. Jean, which is about
as far as anybody can go in this direction. Here, always
guided by the alert M. VAUBEKT, we are introduced to the
officials in charge of the Hotel bureau, and to the telephone
(in a cupboard of the office, kept apart as if it were some rare
sort of jam), through which we receive, from a voice, an
invitation to breakfast with the owner of the voice, at the
Cafe de Bordeaux, at mid-day. We accept voice's invitation
with much pleasure, and request that we may be allowed the
gratification of knowing to whom the voice may happen to
belong. Otherwise it might be a case of Fox et prceterea
nil. However it isn't; voice replies, through telephone, "Je
suis Louis—I am Louis, Louis DUPONT—of DUPONT AND
COMPANY—You talk French ?—All right, then—dejeuner
midi, sharp, Cafe tie Bordeaux—all right—see you later—au
plaisir—au reroir." Cheery voice of M. Louis DUPONT has
melted away into air. M. ALFRED VAUBERT is still "at our
disposition" to show us all we two can see of Bordeaux
between now (nine) and then (twelve). Thanks, we are infinitely
obliged, but if he will excuse us (I am trusting that to be let
off chaperoning us about will be to him a welcome relief), we
two, my friend and I, will do our best with Bordeaux alone,
and will have the great pleasure of meeting him at the Caf£
at twelve. "As your Lordship pleases," is, in effect, our most
amiable M. VAUBERT'S reply. Then, before leaving, he adds,
"You will have the goodness to say where you will dine
to-night, and all will be commanded." We promise faithfully
that our choice shall be imparted to him at lunch. So he
departs, and we go in for what is termed on the entertainer's
stage "a quick change." Our rooms at the Hotel are excel-
lent, baths first-rate. Only one thing makes me shudder, and
that is the appearance of mosquito curtains all round the
magnificent four-poster. However, no mosquitos in daytime.
We do ourselves thoroughly, and as much as can be done
of Bordeaux up to twelve mid-day, when, having found the
Cafe de Bordeaux, which is in the centre of the town and in
full view of the enormous theatre (rather larger, judging
from the exterior, than His Majesty's, Haymarket), and
having also been claimed by M. ALFRED VAUBERT and intro-
duced to the heartiest of hosts, M. Louis DUPONT (whom I
now welcome quite as an old friend, his voice being so
familiar to me on the telephone), we are introduced by him
to (as I think) a partner of his in wine business (my idea is
that everybody in Bordeaux i» in wine business). Then, a
long table having been prepared, half within and half without
the Cafe, the entire party (eight or ten of us) sets to work
upon a first-rate lunch, accompanied by some exceptional
specimens of various wines of the country. It is a merry
party of two languages, mixed; delightful illustration of
the entente cordiale. Then we are on the move. A magni-
ficent motor-brougham awaits us. It belongs to M. Louis
DUPONT, who has undertaken to show us vineyards, old
chateaux, and everything worth seeing within a semicircle
of some sixty miles. We promise M. VADHEBT to be back by
seven and to dine with him at the Restaurant de Bayonne.
"Will he arrange?" "Enchanted. He will." Likewise
he will call for us at our hotel. My friend JCDKIN never
expected all this! He is charmed with everything and
everybody.
"Now then," cries our jovial host, M. Locis DUPONT, "in
you go! Montez!" and in another minute we have bade au
revoir to our co-lunchers, have seated ourselves in the motor
and are being taken along one of the mam thoroughfares out
of Bordeaux. The public tramcar lines do not come to an
end until we have got as far out into the country as may be,
say, Putney from London. There is much to be seen in
Bordeaux, and evidently we shall have little chance of seeing
any of it during this visit.
A great deal of the drive our friend gives us is through
open and rather pretty country; it is all interesting, but
tune and space fail me, and for a full description I must
await another opportunity. We return to Bordeaux by seven
o'clock, for dinner.
I must not however omit a fine old castle, formerly a
week-end residence of the Black Prince, in whose time, with
its moat, its grand steps, its terraces, its principal actors, its
supers, and picturesque costumes, it must have been a
delightful resort for a weary English warrior with just a
day or two off from slashing, banging and whacking.
Wonder my dear old friend Monsieur HARDELOT D'HARDELOT
didn't discover this Chateau du Prince Noir long ago. First-
rate central position; not perhaps within such easy distance
of London as is Le Touquet.
Excellent are the restaurants at Bordeaux where we lunched
and dined, and the cafes where we took our refreshments after-
wards. As a traveller to others passing through I may say,
dine or dejeuner a la fourchette either at the Chapon Fin,
or at the Restaurant de Bayonne. There are special dishes
and special fishes in Bordeaux; at either place take the
manager into your confidence before you order.
Next morning early—everything and everybody is early at
Bordeaux—M. VAUBERT is in attendance to summon us. There
are several motors at the door of the hotel. M. Louis DUPONT
is out to see us off, and here is the earliest bir.d and the
chirpiest of the lot, the founder of the feast, M. JACQUES
JOLLIBOIS himself, who has travelled forty miles to gather his
party together and take them all off with him back to the
Chateau.
This same drive of the above-mentioned forty miles back
just a nice little trip to give us a good appetite for breakfast.
Then we start.

"Vineyards, vineyards everywhere, and not a drop to
drink!" Miles and miles, flat land and hill land, mostly flat,
sometimes undulating just to save its reputation—scorching
sun—smoking-hot villages, blinds down everywhere, all the
villagers out vendanging, for Leg Vendanges have commenced
in many places, and this is what we are here to see,—wonder-
ful waggons, some of 'em bringing in loads of " empties," which
will soon be full—and notable above all are the carts drawn
by magnificent oxen yoked together, driven by fine, healthy,
swarthy, good-looking, good-humoured-faced men, with no
reins in their hands, only a long stick, with which, and
an occasional ejaculated admonition, they indicate to the
intelligent beasts the line of country, and the turnings, they
wish them to take. Then we witness over and over again
the outpouring of all the luscious riches of the grapes—we
taste—we try—we sniff—we feel more and more jovial every
minute. The Bacchic influence is getting into us "through
the pores." Then, when we have arrived at the Chdteau de

miles and miles of an apparently unending Vine Street, what

FOOTBALL OF THE FUTURE.
(Being an extract -from "The Sportsman"
in 1912.)
A VAST concourse of spectators as-
sembled on the Blackheath ground
yesterday afternoon to witness the final
match for the International Rugby Foot-,
ball Cup between Great Britain and
Russia. The excursions which have been
running from St. Petersburg, Paris,
Berlin, and most of the other important
European centres during the last week
have all been well patronised, and it is
estimated that fully a quarter of a
million people passed through the turn-
stiles between ten and two. The Rugby
Union, who had wisely applied for the
loan of two or three Metropolitan con-
stables, are to be congratulated upon the
admirable arrangements which they had
made for the convenience of the public.
Fully half the crowd were able to catch
an occasional glimpse of the game, while
the remainder could easily gather from
the shouts and excited gesticulations of
those in front which team was getting
the better of the day. The compulsory
acquirement of Esperanto, which has
lately been introduced into the Board
schools, proved exceedingly useful as a
means of communication amongst the
spectators: exclamations of "lift vi
shovas?" and shouts of "situ downski
in frontero!" being much in evidence
throughout the afternoon. Russia were
playing exactly the same side that
defeated Montenegro last week; while
Great Britain, with fourteen New Zea-
landers and one Welshman, had their
strongest possiblecombinationinthe field.
Mr. ROOSEVELT, of the United States, had
kindly consented to referee, while Count
WITTE and Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNER-
MAN discharged the important duties of
linesmen for their respective sides.
Although a good deal of feeling was
displayed in the course of the game,
we are glad to state that there was no
repetition of the distressing scenes that
characterised last year's final, when the
whole Japanese fifteen committed " hara-
kiri" on the ground, after losing the
match.
The visitors arrived on the scene at
2.30, but, owing to several unforeseen
difficulties, the kick-off was postponed
until a quarter to three. In the first
place it was found tliat all the boots
provided by the Russian Government
for the Muscovite fifteen had worn out
on the way up from the station, and
fully a quarter of an hour was wasted
in providing substitutes. Then, after
the two teams had actually lined up, a
further hindrance was caused by the
discovery that the Russians were playing
sixteenmen. TheBritishcaptain promptly
ipealed to the referee,and Mr. RIXW.VELT
ordered the extra player to leave the
field, the Russian skipper's expknation
that one of his men was lame and the
additional man was going to run for
him not being considered satisfactory.
The British team adopted the same
formation that was largely responsible
for their brilliant victory over China—
one full back, two seven-eighths, four
three-quarters, five halves, two five-six-
teenths and one " winger : " the Russians
sticking to the old-fashioned idea of still
having a forward. The superiority of
the British method was apparent directly
the game started, MACHONICHIE, the
"winger," picking up the ball five
times out of six before SHUVANTUSHKI,
his Russian opponent, realised that it
was in the scrum. There were a good
many vexatious delays, owing to SHUVAN-
rusHKi's lack of condition: the backs
frequently being compelled to wait until
he had sufficiently recovered his breath
to form a scrimmage.
At half-time the score was: Great
Britain 10 goals 6 tries, Russia nil—
the difference in points scarcely doing
justice to the superiority of the hoine
fifteen. Indeed, the Russian team would
probably have met with a far heavier
defeat, had it not been for the brilliant
display of their full back, NICKAMT
IFUCANSKI, the well-known Government
official, who collared everything he saw
with a skill and daring that evoked the
utmost enthusiasm from the cheaper
parts of the ring.
A slight unpleasantness at the close of
the game marred what was otherwise a
most successful match; the Russian
players absolutely refusing to stop when
Mr. ROOSEVELT blew the whistle for time.
Despite the fact that the score in Great
Britain's favour stood at 26 goals 10 tries
to nil, the Muscovite captain declined to
admit that his men had been defeated,
while Count WITTE actually went so far
as to propose that Great Britain should
give up the points which she had scored,
and let the game be declared a draw.
Mr. ROOSEVELT, however, firmly declined
to listen to any suggestions, and
announced that, if the ground was not
cleared in a quarter of an hour, he would
deliver an address on "the strenuous
life and the responsibilities of marriage."
This threat had the desired effect, for
ten minutes later the huge enclosure was
practically deserted. So terminated
another of those international contests
which have done so much to promote
good feeling and mutual understanding
between the different nations of the
world.
From the Novoe Vremyn, two days
later:—A despatch, received last night
from Captain STRINGEMOFF LIKANIVITCH,
records another glorious victory for
Russian prowess, accomplished this time
upon the fields of peace by our incom-
parable and beloved football team. After
a terrific struggle, lasting for an hour
and a half, in which our heroic fellow-
countrymen "goalkicked," "scrimmed,"
and "went the pace " with unfaltering
courage, the Englishmen were driven
from the field in utter confusion. After
a fierce fight the ball was captured by
the gallant Captain LIKANIVITOH himself,
and is being brought back to St. Peters-
burg to be presented to our Imperial
Master the CZAR.
SOLID APPRECIATION.

Mr. PI.UNKF.T GREENE, who has recently
been on tour with Madame ALBANI, has
been the recipient of a number of
gratifying tributes from his numerous
admirers. At Dundee, after singing
"Shepherd,see thy horse's flowing mane,"
he was presented with a small flock of
black-faced sheep, thoughtfully muzzled
by the donor to prevent their protesting
too vocally in the concert hall. At York
his presents included a leg of New
Zealand lamb, three sacks of potatoes,
nineteen Bath buns, and 12 Ibs. of
China tea. Even more flattering, how-
ever, was the tribute to his abilities at
Northampton, where a hundredweight
of blended butter, thirteen tins of mixed
biscuits, and a barrel of Irwell oysters
were handed to the smiling basso. A
touching episode occurred after Mr.
GREENE'S last song, when a poor hoy in
the gallery, overcome by his enthusiasm,
threw a packet of acid drops on to the
platform.
Mr. BisRi.rrz, the agent for IlAKVsrH
DABCIK, the famous Bohemian prodigy,
has addressed an eloquent appeal to all
the admirers of his client's genius not to
let (heir appreciation take the form of
brandy, caviare, or plovers' eggs. Little
DABCIK is only nine years old, and has an
extremely delicate digestion. He has,
however, no object ion to Turkish Delight,
marrons glaces, or muscatel grapes. Mr.
BERLITZ further makes the admirable
suggestion, that in place of the usual
method of testifying their approbation
audiences might occasionally present the
wonder-child with less perishable evi-
dences of their affection, such as velvet
coats, lace collars, silk stockings, silver
buckles, curling-tongs, and other indis-

THE YOUNG IDEA.
CONCEIVED on lines too rough to nurse
Bantlings of bright imagination,
Our glory once, we live to curse
The public school-boy's education!
Vide the Press. A flashy child
We fatten (sic) on mental fodder,
Leaving illiterate and wild
The dull—but really soulful—plodder.
By flowery ways he ought to win,
Plucking the blooms that shine the
fairest,
Instead of which we keep him in
To cram the uses of the aorist;
The soft Virgilian cadences,
The music (strongly - winged) of
HOMER—
These he should know, or Knowledge is,
They seem to think, a mere misnomer.
Yet hark, oh critic, back a spell;
Conceive yourself with kindly yearning
A master of the Lower Shell,
Setting ajar the doors of Learning;
Think how the disenchantment hurts
When (just as fervour thrills your
marrow)
There slowly steals from THOMPSON terts.
Athwart the room a paper arrow.
You pause,—and mark that BROWN, un-
moved
By visions of a mental rp<x}>fi,
Has surreptitiously improved
The shining hour with almond toffee;
While, just below you, BINKS appears
To wrestle with a secret dolour,
Due to the fact that JONES (who jeers)
Has rammed a pencil down his collar.

And turn with troubled mien to

Tlirough knowledge of the side that's

A LADY doctor, writing to The Daily
Chronicle on " Women Workers," makes
the following unanswerable statement:—
"If you come to estimate a day's work
—even in foot pounds —the woman who
cleans, bakes, washes, and takes to school
six children, carries water and tramps
upstairs and down for sixteen hours a
day, need not fear comparison as to
kinetic energy even with a miner work-
ing eight hours." True: but is all this
quite necessary? Could not her children
sometimes go to school unaccompanied
and unbaked? And why must she keep
on carrying tramps up and down stairs
all that tune? Is it even fair on these
poor unemployed?

SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.
FORTIFIED by the noble example of
Tlie Times and The Standard, a number
of our leading contemporaries have
resolved to enhance the inducements to
a yearly subscription by supplementary
advantages, varying according to the
character of the paper.
Tlie Spectator, being famous for its
tender solicitude towards the lesser
felidce, lias made arrangements for the
establishment of a special Cat Club for
the benefit of its clientele. A sumptuous
roof garden has been erected on the
premises in Wellington Street, where
subscribers will be entitled not only to
the privilege of visiting the quadrupeds
at all hours of the day, but of selecting
and taking home three cats a week.
Persian and Manx cats will also be
supplied at a slightly higher tariff. The
management of the Cat Club has been
entrusted to a relative of Admiral
MUOULIS, the hero of the Greek War of
Independence.
The Jirltish Medical Journal has
already resolved to put a large and
attractive premium on regular sub-
scription. The proprietors have ac-
cordingly inaugurated a Tabloid Club,
and will provide subscribers every week
with three phials, eaclicontaining fifty (50)
tabloids of every conceivable medicinal
quality, thus preparing the reader for
all emergencies.
The Editor of T. P.'s Weekly has made
arrangements with one of the largest
dairies in the metropolis to provide his
subscribers with three magnificent Pats
of Butter on the morning of publication.
The County Gentleman and Land and
Water, determined not to be left behind
in this contest of munificence, has decided
to supply each annual subscriber with
a portable three-roomed cottage with a
sliding corrugated iron roof.
Tlie Tailor and Cutter's offer is also
singularly attractive, subscribers being
presented every week with either a coat,
waistcoat, and trousers, or three pairs
of trousers, or three waistcoats, or a
coat and two waistcoats or, in certain
cases, three hats. In the event of sub-
scribers choosing the last attraction,
however, it is requested that the hats
should not be all worn together.

INDULGING IN PERSONALITIES.
IDLY I turned over the pages of The
Aldwych Magazine, and as I did so my
eye fell listlessly upon the heading, "A
Great Personality. X.Y.Z., the Distin-
guished Novelist. An Appreciation."
Why, I knew the poor creature quite
well, with his mild flabby face and his
weak little eyes. "His great personality,
his brilliant eye, his subtle, sonorous
voice, capable of moving to laughter or
tears,"—how had I missed remarking
these? To me he had ever seemed a
plaintive little figure, his voice a feeble,
piping treble. Amazed 1 read on and
learnt of his unostentatious generosity,—
to my knowledge he had once given
sixpence to a young man who saved
him from drowning—of his freakish
humour, — this man whose decorum
rivalled that of a Scots Elder—of his
biting sarcasms, his severity of judg-
ment,—this poor little creature whose
terror of a waiter was only less absurd
than the obsequious way in which he paid
a cabman's overcharges. Where was this
dazzling creature in whom the Aldwych
would have me believe?
Where?—Creeping in at the Club
door. With furtive glances to right
and left he drew near me.
"G-good afternoon," he began with
his usual formula. "The w-weather is
always changeable."
"So are other things," I observed.
"Characters, for instance."
He glanced at me timidly, and his eye
fell upon the Aldwych. He shivered.
"You've been reading that? I
s-suppose you 're a bit surprised?"
"Exactfy," I said. "You'll forgive
me, but this sketch isn't quite you.
How did you manage it?"
"Everyone could get done in the same
way if they wanted to," he piped
defiantly,—"if they went to the right
shop, that is."
"The right shop !" I echoed.
"P'raps I had better explain," he
said confidingly. "I'm what is called a
distinguished novelist, you know, and
so I had to have a personality to keep
my hold on my public. It's necessary,
you know, nowadays. But I never had
a personality, and so I could never
submit to an interview, till one morning
a prospectus arrived from the Personali-
ties Supply Company. They provide
personalities for authors who haven't
got any. You get the anecdotes to
match, too. Then when an interviewer
calls you just have to tell him to go
round to the Personality man for any
particulars about you he may require, in
the same way as you send him to your
photographer. You don't know what
a relief it is. I wrote off at once, and
in two days my Personality was ready,
and when the Aldwych man called upon
me I just sent him off to the shop, and—
well, you see the result. You really
ought to try the people. Wait a minute,
I 've got a prospectus on me now."
He handed it to me as he spoke, and
I read:
To AUTHORS.
Do you want a Personality? Do you
want, in fact, to be Someone? Do you
want men to remove their hats when
they see you, to print anecdotes about
you on the last page of The Westminster
Gazette? Do you want to appear in
every important volume of Recollections
to be published during the next hundred
years? Above all, do you want to be
mentioned without the prefix Mr.?
If so, We Are The People.
We fix you up a personality and keep
it pigeon-holed for immediate reference.
All you have to do is to send an inter-
viewer to us, and we place the details of
your personality in his hands.
We supply personalities to all classes
of the literary profession for cash or on
easy terms.
ANECDOTE DEPARTMENT.
Anecdotes can be written up and
handed to the interviewer, or authors
may have them to circulate privately
among journalistic friends. We append
a few specimens of our leading lines:—
Love of Pet Animals and Gift for
Repartee.—" X. has a pet wasp which
always makes its appearance at his
dining-table. Many stories are told of
X. and his pretty pet. One night,
B., the well-known publisher, was dining
with X., the wasp of course being
present. During the evening B. irri-
tated the insect, and was, in consequence,
severely stung. Springing to his feet,
he cried, 'If I get hold of that creature,
won't I deal faithfully with it!' 'My
dear B.,' exclaimed X., 'how can you
deal faithfully? Are you not a pub-
lisher?'
X.'s new novel is having a large sale,
and his publisher, who is of course not
the one just referred to, is about to
issue a third large impression.
No anecdotes are more effective than
those about absent-mindedness, and the
following, recently supplied to an emi-
nent philosophic writer, gave great
satisfaction:—
"The absent-mindedness of BLANK is
a source of great anxiety to his friends.
One morning recently, his wife, on
coming down to breakfast some moments
later than the well-known writer himself,
was startled by a strange spectacle. On
the chair usually occupied by her hus-
band lay a poached egg, and on the
table, on a piece of toast, pensively
gazing into space, sat the great philoso-
pher himself."
Please give us a call.
TO CHLOE.
(Who admits that she "cannot read poetry
for mtts.")
MILTON, unless your nature were forgiving
From consciousness of power,
I count it fortunate you are not living
At this prosaic hour.
LOVELACE, your fair Althea's eyes might
glisten
Without your prison wall,
But here is one who simply would not
listen
To you at all. *
Yet let me take your eloquent confession,
My Chloe, in good part,
Though it dismisses in one terse expres-
sion
The rhymer and his art;
Though at the thought my critic reason
totters,
Come, let us part as friends,
All poets, in your judgment, rank as
"rotters,"
And there it ends.
At least I see, if something crushed and
humbled,
What narrow risks I ran:
I might myself an hour ago have tumbled
Beneath your rigorous ban:
I might have launched some glowing
panegyric,
I might have tried to woo
The amorous Muse in some impassioned
lyric,
Addressed to you.
My memories of an earlier generation
Still paint in tender hues
Maidens with equal powers of fascination,
But widely different views;
Until comparison becomes alarming,
And, waking to your smiles,
I find in you a modern Circe, charming
With modern wiles.
You have your rod, your rifle, and your
driver,
Your motor caps and slang,
Your Bridge, at which you seem to
"drop a fiver"
Each night without a pang:
So, if your heart be with your treasures,
Why should I gibe and flout
Simply because your catalogue of
pleasures
Leaves poets out?
Indeed, the picturesqueness of your
phrases
Has made me scarcely sure
Whether I might not find my favourites'
praises
More painful to endure;
For some ecstatic jargon tripping
Out of your lively soul
Might have called BURNS and SHELLEY
"ripping,"
Or KEATS "top hole."

OPERATIC NOTES.
Tuesday.—Another siiccessful evening, but not to be
reckoned among the very, or the most, successful. There was
a full house to hear BOITO'S Mefistofele, which even when
given here in first-rate style never presented much attraction,
either musically or dramatically, to the Common or (Covent)
Garden opera-goer. • To-night the "Upper Suckles" were
noisy in their enthusiasm, and Conductor MDGNONE had to
put in several appearances before the curtain in response to
the loud calls. It seems a pity that some little licence is not
allowed to a conductor, who is in modern evening dress and
not got up in costume for any particular part, so that instead
of perpetually appearing and reappearing merely as himself,
which becomes a trifle monotonous for the audience and a bit
dull for the recipient of such honours, he might change a dark
wig for a light one, and vice versa, or might cover his flowing
locks with a scalp, or might come on representing, at different
times, different composers whose works he may have been con-
ducting. This is merely thrown out as a hint; probably as
a suggestion it will be thrown out again, or rather " chucked."
Once more unto the opera, dear friends! Those who
know GOUNOD'S Faust, and hear BOITO'S Mefistofele for the
first time, must feel a bit "confoozlum" by the prologue and
by such an arrangement of Acts and Scenes as offers only an
occasional glimpse of our old friend Faust rejuvenated, of
Margaret the flirty, of Martha the flighty, and of our popular
MephistopJieles, to whom this Mefislofele seems a sort of dis-
tant relation.
Signora GIACJIETTI, as Margherita and Elena, acted fairly
well and sang charmingly, though not up to herself in other
operas. Signora ZUCCARIA showed herself fairly capable as
Marta and Pantalis. Signor DIDUR, indifferently made up to
represent this undecided variety of a Musical Mefistc, sang
and acted well. Signor ZENATELLO rendered the music allotted
to Faust with great feeling, and Signor Zcccm must have
astonished himself when doubling the parts of Wagner and
Nereus. Pity a little special Wagnerian motive could not be
introduced into the accompaniments when Wagner comes on;
for BOITO is occasionally uncommonly Wagnerian.
Scenery and stage arrangements excellent. Great enthu-
siasm for Signor ZENATELLO and Signora GIACHETTI, as the
beautiful Helen (just from Paris), in the" Forma ideal puris-
sima," and "Ah! Amore misterio," in the Fourth Act, which
indeed went admirably throughout.

LILLIAN.
VI—A SLIGHT MISTAKE.
AT half-past-three LILLIAN whistled
for Cecilia, the new fox-terrier, and
walked over to see how I was getting
on. I am looking after my brother
ARTHUR'S house while he and GRACE are
in town, and the duties and responsibili-
ties are great. In the very first week
an epidemic carried off twenty-four
ducks, while a most valuable and highly-
prized plant drooped and declined on
the herbaceous border. This was out-
side the house. Inside there was a
drawing-room chair that broke its leg;
and the usual casualties were recorded
from the kitchen. I am troubled with
a rather mercenary brother and sister-
in-law; and it was much
more to them that a chair
had lost its castor than that
a near and dear relative had
severely barked his shin in
trying to jump over it.
Anyhow I decline all re-
sponsibility for the plant.
The life of our humble garden
relations is, alas! an uncer-
tain one. To-day they are,
and to-morrow somebody has
uprooted them, honestly think-
ing (whatever ARTHUR may
say about idiots) that they
were weeds.
I mention these things to
explain why, when LILLIAN
came round, I was in a
distant part of the grounds,
keeping an eye on the head-
gardener. LILLIAN, having
called all over the house for
me, was about to look oiitside,
when a book on the hall table
caught her eye. She picked it
over the pages of LILLIAN'S book. LILLIAN
looked up lazily, and then jumped to
her feet with a little "Oh!" Mrs.
MARGETTS pushed her way in.
"How do you do, Mrs. MEADOWES?" she
said. "May I come in?"
ARTHUR is Mr. MEADOWES, and so I
suppose am I. But LILLIAN is certainly
not Mrs. MEADOWES. I can imagine her
look of surprise, her frown as she thought
for a moment, and then the almost
inaudible and sudden gurgle of laughter
with which she accepted her new name.
"Oh, do come in," said LILLIAN. "I 'in
afraid you found me asleep, or very
nearly. I'm BO sorry to be in such a
state."
"When you called," said Mrs. MAK-
OETTS, "I was unfortunate enough to be

up casually, glanced at the end
and saw that they married all
right, glanced at the beginning and saw '"-out. It was the day of dear Lady

"One has to be," said LILLIAN.
This was the moment that I chose for
coming in. I had seen Cecilia, and
knew that LILLIAN was about.
"LILLIAN!" I shouted, as I came into
the hall. Then I saw Mrs. MAHGETTS,
her out. Now Mrs. MARGETTS was return-
ing the call, and GRACE was in town.
Some people have all the luck.
LILLIAN belongs to the. No Hat Brigade.
Mrs. MARGETTS saw her through the open

fairly natural conclusion.
The sun was behind Mrs. MARGETTS,
and her very substantial shadow was
It was only two yards to the bell, but
I did a lot of thinking in that time.
When I came back I said that I had
been helping the gardener plant gera-
niums all the afternoon, and that I
thought a wash—at the word "wash " I
made hurriedly for the door.
At the word "wash" LILLIAN looked
at her hands and said: "If you 're going
to the bathroom, ARTHUR, I left my rings
there. You might—
I stopped and looked at her.
"No, never mind," she added ; "you 'd
probably drop them somewhere." She
turned to Mrs. MAKGETTS. "He is so
clumsy," I heard her say.
That was a nice way to speak of a
husband! LILLIAN was evidently going
right through with her part. Women
seem to think that they can say anything
they like about their male relations.
And they always generalise so fearfully.
They don't say, "Owing to
the carelessness of JANE, the
parlour - maid, in leaving a
small carved stool in the
middle of the conservatory
floor, he accidentally tripped
and knocked over father's
bowl of goldfish yesterday,"
but "He is so clumsy!"
On my way to the wash, I
met a maid and told her to
put tea outside. I can depart
from the strict truth so much
more picturesquely in the
open air. Indoors I feel
cramped, and am no sort of
a conspirator. When I joined
them at tea I felt ready for
anything.
LILLIAN was in splendid form
and talked as if she had been
married to me for years. One
characteristic of hers is that
she never forestalls trouble. I
don't myself much, but I must
say that I was rather wondering
where this joke of hers would
lead us to. LILLIAN, though,
was quite childishly happy and peaceful;
and she stopped her conversation with
Mrs. MARGE™ now and then to say
''More tea, dear?" to me in the most
natural way.
Now Mrs. MARGETTS was short-sighted,
and she was the sort of person who is
too immensely interested in herself to
take much notice of anybody else. She
might easily meet ARTHUR some weeks
later, and never know that he was not
the man she had met before. We were
as like as most brothers. But LILLIAN
and GRACE were so very different—one
being dark and one fair. Besides, I
had called her LILLIAN several times.
The only way
"LILLIAN, dear," I said, "I think you
had better go in. It's getting damp,
and you know what the doctor said.
You were saying, Mrs. MARGETTS, that
you would like to see the stables?"
When LILLIAN had gone, I said:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN Old Oak Furniture (METHUEN) Mr. FREDERICK ROE has
found the subject of a fascinating work. We all vaguely like
old furniture, sometimes worshipping with equal satisfaction
faked-up specimens. Mr. ROE knows his old arm-chair
literally au fond, and writes aboiit it with contagious enthu-
siasm. Old oak furniture is a treasure-trove for novelists by
no means exhausted by the bard of The Old Oak Cheat known
to the Baron's (not DE BOOKWORM'S) retainers blithe and gay.
My Baronite notes a gruesome tragedy in connection with a
bedstead formerly housed at the " Blue Boar" Inn in Leicester.
In the time of good Queen BESS the inn was kept by one CLARK,
who suddenly assumed an appearance of affluence inadequately
accounted for by opportunities for using tankarda of short
measure. In time the secret was out. His wife ''going to
make a bed hastily and shaking the bedstead, a piece of
gold dropped out." On further examination it was discovered
that the bedstead in which, according to tradition, RICHARD
THE THIRD once slept, had a double bottom. The space
between was filled with gold coins. When CLARK died,
leaving his wealth to his widow, she, resigned unto the
heavenly will, kept on the "Blue Boar" still. The money
awakening the cupidity of a maidservant, she with intent to
obtain it did her mistress to death. The maid was duly
hanged all in a row with seven male accomplices. All in
the churchyard lie and none in Heaven. The attractiveness
of Old Oak Furniture naturally leads to desire on the part of
ingenious craftsmen to oblige with fresh specimens furtively
made on the premises. Mr. ROE points out how our own
Victoria and Albert Museum entertained unawares several
specimens of the craft. The book presents numerous repro-
ductions of charming pieces of old furniture.
A Woman of the World, by ELLA WHEELER WILCOX (CASSELL),
is made up of imaginary letters of advice to imaginary people
on the most intimate affairs of life. These letters must, so
this Assistant Reader thinks, have appeared previously in
some American journal devoted to the interests of the sex.
kSo great a mass of high-toned, but serenely platitudinous,
morality cannot have been written at one fell go by any
mortal. The correspondence is of that special sort in which
the person addressed is first put in possession of a great many
of those details of his own history with which he or she must
be perfectly familiar, and then the little sermon begins, now
arch and coy, now hortatory and almost (but not quite) angry.
List, oh list, to the advice bestowed on Edna Gordon during
her honeymoon :—" Do not expect a husband to be happy
and contented with a continuous diet of love and sentiment
and romance I have known an adoring young wife
to irritate Cupid so he went out and sat on the doorstep,
contemplating flight, by continual neglect of small duties. . .
. . The towel-rack was empty just when he (the husband)
wanted his bath, and his bedroom slippers were always
kitkcd so far under the bed" [this must have been temper]
"that he was obliged to crawl on all fours to reach them.
Then his loving spouse was sure to want to be 'cuddled'
when he was smoking his cigar and reading" [how did ELLA
know all this ?], "a triple occupation only possible to a human
freak with three arms, four eyes, and two mouths." Seven
years later, however, Mr. Charles Gordon, the husband of
Edna, gets his share. Edna is neglected and suffering.
"What Edna craves," writes Mrs. WILCOX to the neglecting
Cliarleii, "is your love, your attention, your sympathy, not the
service of paid domestics. She wants you to notice her fading
bloom, and to take her in your arms, and say, tenderly,
'Little girl, we must get those old roses back. And we must
go away for a new honeymoon, all alone, and forget every
care, even if we forget the babies for a few days.' .... I
remember at your own board you made me uncomfortable
talking about my complexion, which you chose to say Was
'remarkable for a woman of my age'. . . . and all the time
I saw the tears hidden back under the lids of Edna's tired

(much as I should like to)
he ever took Edna away for that new honeymoon. Ah, how
true it is that life is one long disappointment!" It is you,
Charles Gordon, who must cure your wife of nerves, hysteria,
and incipient jealousy, not I." There are many more such
gems in this " bland, passionate, and deeply religious" book
The Suwrd of Gideon (CASSELL) is the effective sounding,
but somewhat irrelevant, title given by JOHN BLOUNDELLE-
BURTON to his latest novel, which describes the adventures
of one Bevill Bracton, who, having transferred his rather
shaky allegiance from the Jacobite service to that of Queen
AKNE, is so struck by the miniature portrait of a pretty
English lady, a prisoner, as Lord PETERBOROUGH informs
him, in the hands of the French, that he at once offers to
bring her back to her son-owing friends and relatives, and
thus win for himself a commission from Queen ANNE and
the Duke of MARLBOROUGH. The gallant Baron attempted
to follow the dashing young adventurer, but found the way
wearisome. Some readers may, perhaps, be interested in the
quest of the heroine. The Baron contents himself with Mr.
W. H. MARGETSON'S clever and well-executed illustrations.
Messrs. TREHERNE issue what Mr. DOUGLAS SLADEX calls "A
Peace Edition" of his More Queer Tilings almut Japan. It
contains all the material given in the first edition, including
the rare illustrations reproduced from the works of Japanese
artists, supplemented by a precis of the terms of peace and
a skeleton history of the mighty conflict they terminated.
This adds permanent value to a work which my Baronite,
having visited the country, can testify gives a clear and
picturesque insight into life in Japan.
Nothing is better calculated to serve the cause of truth than
the enlightenment of partisan leaders by the labour of such
careful, painstaking, liberal-minded students of history as are
represented by Abbot GASQUET, D.D., author of Henry the Third
and the Church (GEORGE BELL & SONS). Recognising the
divine right of a supreme authority lawfully and properly
exercising its powers, Dr. GASQUET never shrinks from candidly
admitting and contemning its abuses, nor does he ever
attempt to justify what common sense must honestly denounce
as unjustifiable. This scholarly-written and well-considered
work shows, as clearly as possible, how the road, in England,
was prepared for the onward march of the Reformers by
those who, at the time, never for one moment foresaw what
was to be the ultimate result of
the work for which mundane
ambition, utter selfishness, and
unchristian scheming had sup-
plied the materials. In fields
where good men should have
reaped a bounteous harvest,
tares were sown, ill weeds grew
apace, and herbs of grace were
rare. "Meddle and muddle"
sums up the policy and action,
both Royal and Papal, at this
early period of our civil and
ecclesiastical history.

RICHARD ABOVE HIMSELF AGAIN.
[Mr. BirnARD SEDDON, Premier of New Zealand, has been making a
speech. The Times publishes a cable to the effect that "as regards
Japanese immigration Mr. SEDDON declared that Japanese would not be
allowed to come to New Zealand, and that the colony would refuse to
be dictated to in the matter."]
RICHARD! 'neatli whose awful thumb,
Like a god's that goes on wheels,
Britain's nether isles are dumb,
And adjacent Ocean reels ;—
We who catch at times a rumour
Touching things that you have said
Find our homely sense of humour
Hampered by a latent dread
Lest our RICHARD'S health should suffer from a swelling in
the head.
You have spoken: '' I am he
Who will give the alien pause;
None shall dare dictate to me
On our local yellow laws:
In a land that teems with gentle
Uncontaminated hearts,
Never shall the Oriental
Dump his diabolic arts,
Or pollute our pearly geysers or defile our meaty marts!"
But the peoples whom you brand
As a swarm of noxious flies—
Does your Highness xmderstand
They include our own allies?
Men whose valour, strength, and station
We will not just now review,
Save to vent the observation
(Which, in any case, is true):—
lliote whom we delight to honour should be good enough for
you!
Kindly note this useful fact:—
Friends of ours are friends of yours;
They implicitly contract
Not to raid your helpless shores;
Else the Japs, whom you of Zealand
Treat as something rather vile,
Might to-morrow lift their heel and
With a deferential smile
Flatten honourable SEDDON, if they thought it worth their while.
You have manners yet to learn
Such as Eastern nations teach;
You must make it your concern
To amend your style of speech.
Talk no more of our intrusion
In affairs beyond the seas,
You who nursed the fond illusion
That you had a right to sneeze
When the Rand that hired the heathen never asked you,
"May we, please?"
Can it be your head is turned
By your team of Rugby "Blacks "?
Has the glory they have earned
Set you trotting in their tracks?
Well, it's not mere weight and gristle;
You must also play the game,
Or the referee may whistle
And you '11 have yourself to blame
If you get a free-kick planted where you don't expect the same.
O. S.
ALL HANDS TO THE BOATS!
THE case of the L.C.C. Steamboat service appears to be
fairly desperate, at any rate in view of the approaching-
winter, and something must be speedily done to restore its
attractions for the mass of Londoners. We appeal to the
patriotic, sentimental, and sporting instincts of our various
readers on behalf of these pretty and useful playthings of
the bygone summer. Any one of the following suggestions
will, we are sure, prove efficacious. We therefore beg'to
recommend :—-
That the fifty-seven members of the County Council who
voted for the retention of the service (with their wives,
families, and relatives within the prohibited degrees) be
compelled to make at least two steamboat journeys a day, to
and from business, in all weathers.
That Mr. JOHN BURNS, L.C.C., be appointed Commodore,
and be further empowered to patrol the river armed to the
teeth, for twelve hours each day, and to deal with recalcitrant
ratepayers and editorial "ruffians" according to the laws of
war.
That the New Zealand football team be induced to patronise
the more seaworthy of the boats as often as possible in the
course of their frequent peregrinations, and thus—in the
intervals of distributing autographs and private information
as to their pet names—to rehearse their great forthcoming
act of sitting on the ruins of any bridge into which the vessels
may happen to bump.
That every passenger brave enough, in face of a mid-
Xovember fog or frost, to take a ticket from Hammersmith
to the Old Swan Pier, and sufficiently lucky to reach his
destination alive, be presented with the Imperial Service
Order, the F.O.S., or some similar decoration.
That the fleet be relabelled throughout with names of
more modern and recognisable heroes than such as Olaf,
Fitzalwyn, or Edmund Ironside (though this latter is perhaps
appropriate in collisions). "Gallaher," "Bernard Shaw,"
"Wallace" (the All Black, of course, not the "Wha Hae"
person), "C. B. Fry," "Little Tich," "Sandow," "Lipton,"
and many other up-to-date appellations would be much
more certain to draw.
That the road-laying authorities be encouraged to pursue
their present obstructive tactics and repave the principal
thoroughfares at their usual rate. This should tide the
steamboats over the winter.
That Missing Treasure should be largely advertised as
hidden in one or more of the vessels, not, of course, in the
funnels or engine-room.
That The Times and Standard Book Clubs take the matter
up and add the management of river trips (out of season) to
their varied activities. Once let their subscribers be con-
vinced that it is an inestimable privilege, and there will be
a five-weeks' waiting-list at each of the piers.
That daily bumping races be held between the various
steamboats over the course, eastward in the morning and
westward in the evening. This would greatly accelerate the
speed and promote the interest and excitement of a voyage.
The strict University rules need not be adhered to. Any
boat that made a bump would still go full-speed ahead and
try to "win her paddles" by a consecutive series of similar
achievements.
That, finally, ah" the inhabitants of London who object to
the alarming increase in the rates be persuaded to spend
their remaining cash on steamboat journeys, and thus-^-on
the principle of taking in each other's washing—relieve
their own indebtedness. ZiG-ZAQ.

NERVES IN NUBIA.
f" A party of Society ladies and gentlemen,
titled and otherwise, will leave London on
November 16, for a luxurious encampment
pitched in the African desert, in search of
health and the despatch of ennui."—Daily
Chronicle.]
WITH a copy of The Daily Chronicle
in my hand I hurried to the Club which
JOSEPHINE honours with her presence,
if not always with her subscriptions, in
the hope that she would be able to give
me fuller information about this year's
pilgrimage into the desert in search of
relief for Society's jaded nerves.
"Are you ?" I began, opening the
(Jhronide.
"Yes!" said JOSEPHINE, enthusias-
tically, " and isn't it a perfectly beautiful
idea?"
"But what made you all think of it?"
1 asked. "Was it'
"Yes!" said JOSEPHINE, "it was the
terrible need for. rest in this modem
whirlpool we call Society. Wherever
one looks one sees noble men and women
overworking themselves in all kinds of
ways, at the beck and call of dress-
makers and tailors, with weary piles of
the latest novels to read, skating lessons
at Prince's, new theatres to visit, new
plays to see—and then Bridge!"
Here her emotion overcame her, and
I had to wait a moment or two before I
could put my next question.
"Has a site been chosen for the en-
campment?" I then asked.
"Oh, yes," said JOSEPHINE, "a sweet
little spot on the borders of a palm-
shaded grove. And there we shall just
bask in the sun all day long, and forget
our chains! Each tent will be absolutely
perfect in every way, but at the same
time exquisitely simple — just a few
beautiful rugs, a little real Chippendale,
and a few choice engravings -electric
light, of course, to play Bridge by"
"Bridge!" I exclaimed.
"As a relaxation!" said JOSEPHINE,
hastily, "not as the weary business it is'
in tcwn."
"And will you receive letters while
you are in the desert?" was my next
query, "or will the Rest Cure exclude
the post?"
"A noted nerve specialist will accom-'
pany the party," answered JOSEPHINE,
consulting a pamphlet in her hand, "and -
he will open all letters and read aloud
to us the parts that will interest and;
amuse without exciting." i
"Not private letters?" I exclaimed,
aghast.
"Of course not!" said JOSEPHINE, im-
patiently. "How silly you are! But
don't interrupt. The same plan will be
followed with regard to newspapers.
Then we are thinking of publishing a
little paper of our own—the Nubian
News—nothing heavy, of course, just
Society news, desert gossip, clever say-
ings of members of the party, what we

are wearing, the winners at Bridge, and
interesting little things of that kind."
"And will you adopt the Eastern
dress?" I inquired, meditatively.
"With modifications," said JOSEPHINE.
"A staff of experienced Parisian artistes
will go out with us, who will adapt the
Eastern draperies to individual tastes.
Then there will be a beauty specialist
who will look after our complexions
after we have basked in the sun. There
must be no anxieties of any kind
allowed to intrude, you see, or the whole
idea will be spoilt."
"And how about Church Parade?" I
asked; "you will miss that, won't you?"
"Oh no," said JOSEPHINE. "A dear,
delightful marabout with the most per-
fect manners is to come and instruct us
in desert religions. After all, there is
so much real earnestness in Society, if
people would only believe it! Why,
ADELINE and MAUD wouldn't miss Church
Parade for any consideration whatever!"
"And how about the cost of it all?"
I asked.
"Oh, a mere nothing!" said JOSEPHINE,
airily. "Now don't be stupid, and want
to know exactly how much! And we
mean to come back in March as fit as
possible to take up our work again."
"And will any books of travel be
written?" I inquired.
"Well," said JOSEPHINE, doubtfully,
"we shall all keep diaries, of course—
'do remind me to get one at the Stores
to-morrow—and perhaps that dear clever
Mr. HICHENS—he did write The Garden
of Flames, didn't he?—will be so kind
as to just look through them for us
when we come back, and see that we
have spelt the names of the places
properly. But all this time you haven't
told me what you think of it?" she added
reproachfully, as I got up to go.

gratulated," said I, "on having, for this

MR.
BIGTREE BRAND'S
NEW PLAY.
INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR.
(With acknoidedgmcnts to the " Daily Netrs.")
CAUTIOUSLY entering the sanctum of
the illustrious poet-author on all fours
I glanced inquiringly at him as he sat
in his curule chair, elegantly gowned
in a flowing toga profusely embroidered
with laticlaves, ampulla?, and other
sesquipedal embroidery. My silent
query was promptly answered. "You
may stand," observed Mr. PHILIP STEPHENS
in a rich thorough - baas, and on my
complying with his courteous request he
at once launched out into a copious yet
precise commentary on his newly finished
drama.
"I have written my drama," said Mr.
STEPHENS, " in blank verse, as usual, with
plenty of Alexandrines, trochaic tetra-
meters and hecatompods, and have
divided it into a prologue, thirteen mono-
logues, four catalogues, and an apologue
or epilogue—I forget which. Nero is,
of course, the central figure, round which
gravitatesa host of impressive personages,
but without ever encroaching on Nero's
limelight.
"The action takes place partly at Rome
and partly at Baiae, the Brighton of
Imperial Rome, thus affording exceptional
scope for a magnificent stage pageant,
including the walk of the Roman
fceneratores, the performance of Ethio-
pian tibicines, mixta balnea, etc. The
mounting of the play, it is almost super-
fluous to mention, will be carried out by
Mr. BIGTREE BRAND with his well-known
care for sumptuous realism.
"The last scene, especially, will be of
dazzling, I had almost said scorching,
brilliance. It gives a vivid representa-
tion of the famous burning of Rome,
when the Imperial City was like a
gigantic furnace, for the feeding of which
Mr. BRAM and a corps of fifty Stokers
have been specially retained. Fire engines
specially constructed from designs taken
from Pompeian graffiti will be employed
to extinguish the conflagration. The
scenery employed will be entirely made
of asbestos."
"The subject, I take it, is treated
from a Pagan point of view?" I queried.
"Pagan, I regret to say," was the
answer, "though I admit that I was
sorely tempted to introduce the element
of Christian science into the plot."
"How does your story unfold itself
on the stage, then?"
"Well, as I have already observed,
there are thirteen monologues, for each
of which Nero dons a different wig.
Nero's pre-occupation with his chevelure
was his ruling passion. An accomplished
musician, he had the terrible misfortune
—like Mr. ROCKEFELLER, whose clear-cut
physiognomy is distinctly Neronian. in
its contour—to be bald. That was the
great tragedy of his life. Imagine M.
PADEREWSKI in a wig, or Dr. W. G. GRACE
in a false beard! As POPE sings:—
'Beauty draws us with a single hair.1
But to the bald this consolation is denied.
His mother Agrippina knew the secret
and he slew her. Poppcea found it out,
and paid for the knowledge with her life.
An allusion to his infirmity appeared in
the Acta Diurna or Daily Mail of Rome,
and the infuriated potentate retaliated
by burning down his own capital."
"Is there any historical foundation for
this explanation of Nero's excesses?" I
asked.
"None whatever," replied the poet-
author. "It is entirely original, it has
never been put forward before, and it
fully explains the otherwise inexplica-
ble. Mr. CLARKSON is convinced of its
accuracy. As he said to me only yester-
day, 'How lucky for you that Mr. G. R.
SIMS did not live nineteen hundred years
ago!'"
"Will much stress be laid on Nero's
skill as a musician?" I ventured to ask.
"Considerable," was the gracious
response. "Some of the monologues
; will be cantillated, while others will take
1 the form of regular solos to the accom-
I paniment of lutes, pipes and other
primitive instruments. Nero will also
, sing a duet with Agrippina and a trio
with Poppcea and Acte."
"My only regret," observed Mr.
STEPHENS in conclusion, "is that it is
impossible for Mrs. SIDDONS to take the
role of Agrippina. She was obviously
intended for the part, and it must be a
cause of disappointment to her manes
that she committed the error of being
born so long in advance of her true
environment." Assenting cordially to
this unimpeachable sentiment, I with-
drew backwards from the presence of the
famous poet-author-actor, who bids fair
to enhance still further the obligation
of the public by his latest effort (if I may
quote his own words) to appease "that
unconscious but essentially human feel-
ing—the dumb hunger for the beautiful."
"THE DIMES."
MESSRS. MUDIE'S NEW DAILY.
ARRANGEMENTS for the new twopenny-
halfpenny morning paper which MUDIE'S
Library is about to establish are said to
be proceeding apace. Already the title
has been decided upon—The Dimes—
while the staff is virtually complete.
The paper, we understand, is to be
edited by a gigantic Scotch gentleman,
appropriately named MUCKLE, who is not
likely to be taken in by any cleek.
Among his assistants will be Mr.
HATTER, Mr. ROOFER, Mr. COMFY LORD,
Mr. MAYLER-FOOTLAND, and several Fellows
of All Souls.
The business side of the paper will be
hi the capable hands of Mr. MOBEL (the
originator of the Mobel prize for distinc-
tion in commercial enterprise, which
hitherto has always fallen to himself),
and the stage will never be neglected
so long as Mr. TALKLEY has his head.
The Dimes will be an impartial paper,
always leaning to the Conservative side.
It will consist of many pages of good
clear print, studiously avoiding pictur-
esque verbosity on the one hand and
hustling impressionism on the other.
Among its other claims to distinction
will be its immunity from the pens of
Mr. CHESTERTON, Mr. BEGBIE, Mr. L. G.
CHIOZZA MONEY, Mr. BART KENNEDY, and
Mr. J. HOLT SoHOOLrNG.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A series of supplements is being
arranged for, dealing with various sub-
jects of interest to the public. Thus on
Monday a golfing supplement, entirely
written by the Editor, will be given away
with a pound of tee; on Wednesday
there will be an advertising supplement,
describing all the latest devices for
bringing one's pigs to market; and on
Friday a journalistic supplement will
appear which shall serve to book-readers
as a guide to the most interesting articles
in the daily and weekly press.
The Kmes will not be on sale in the
usual way at all. It is a paper strictly
for subscribers to MUDIE'S Library. No
others need apply. It has been started,
indeed, wholly with the purpose of sup-
plying novel-readers with a sufficiency
of waste-paper in which to wrap up
their read books, and, this being so, will
be printed on brown paper, with one
page quite blank, save for MUDIE'S
address in the middle of it, to serve as
outside wrapper. So little do the pro-
moters value the reading matter of the
paper itself that on many occasions, when
nothing much is occurring, or it is good
golfing weather, The Dimes may be
blank all through. Messrs. Muoip hold
that no English home is complete with-
out plenty of brown paper, and they
also believe that at this period in our
country's history, when the cry for effi-
ciency is so strident, every man who
reads a novel ought also to take in n
morning journal.
At an interview which our representa-
tive has recently enjoyed with Messrs.
MUDIE, he learned that no pains will be
spared to carry out this ideal. The
Dimes will be given free to all sub-
scribers to the Library, whether they
want it or not. Messrs. MUDIE are i
very firm about this. "A posse of
commissionaires," he said, "carefully
chosen from the ranks of the reser-
vists, and Mobelised by the manager,
will stand at the doors of the Library
and force copies of The Dimes on all
persons leaving the building. It will
not be a question of 'Please take one,'"
he added, significantly, "but 'You shall
have one.' A copy of The Dimes will go
with every volume. The legend, 'No
Dimes, no books,' will be displayed
prominently all over the Library. Thus,
a subscriber leaving with five volumes
under his arm will receive five copies of
Tlie Dimes; with fifteen, fifteen; and so
on. In this way we cannot escape circu-
lation. There our responsibility ends.
What becomes of the papers is no con-
cern of ours: all we do is to get it into
the English home. We are pledged to
that."
"But what," our representative ven-
tured to ask, "will you do in the case
of stubborn old-fashioned people who
absolutely refuse to accept a paper?"

BRIEF HISTORY OF A NEW HAT.
(A Story tritliout Words.)
Messrs. MUDIE smiled an inscrutable
smile.
"Ah," they rsaid, darkly, "we have
our plans. In such cases copies of The
Dimes will be left on the doorsteps,
whatever happens, by arrangement with
the milkman."
TO A FASHIONABLE BEAUTY.
ALL ladies at the last Newmarket Meeting
You easily outshone;
In popularity, that gift so fleeting,
You stood unmatched, alone.
They called you "pretty" every time
they named you—
Take care you don't get vain—
They called you " fast" as well, but no
one blamed you,
They only praised again.
The Press, which viewed the Quality
• parading,
Described your " winter coat,"
Twas "long " and "rough," no seams,
or pleats, or braiding,—•
All humbler dames, take note.
So young—so flattered—yet no tale of
folly
Against you can be told;
The World is at your feet,—though,
Pretty Potty,
You are but Four Years Old!

FREETARIFFTRADEREFORM.
A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT.
SCENE—A platform. Mr. JOSEPH, Cousin HUGH, Uncle HENRY
CHAPLIN, and others discovered fighting for the possession
of Little ARTHUR. At last they separate, and Little
ARTHUR speaks.
LITTLE ARTHUR (peevishly).
YE friends of my heart, let me beg you to cease;
'Give over your struggles, and leave me in peace.
You can see with one eye my absorption is great;
For I 'm up to my chin in the business of state.
If you ask me, ye strivers, to tell you my plan,
I refer to HAYASHI and murmur "Japan!"
If you press me, I add that it's awful for me
To imagine the State in the hands of C.-B.
You may say my opinions are shrouded in vapour;
But I wrote them out plain on a half-sheet of paper;
And I doubt if I "m up to the very hard training
That's required for the toil of explaining, explaining.
Do I love Mr. JOSEPH? I vow that I do;
With a fervour as great I adore Cousin HUGH.
HENRY CHAPLIN 's my own; but it's infamous, very,
To doubt that I dote on my dear LONDONDERRY:
Is it fair that an all-comprehending affection
Should meet with denial or doubt or rejection?
I perceive you agree that it's certainly not;
And as for myself I agree with the lot.
[Si/8 doini and assumes an air of philosophic abstraction.
MR. JOSEPH (delighted).
Just listen to that! I 've always said it;
So mine is the joy, and mine the credit!
Go fetch me a batch of my own reporters,
And let them wire to my League's headquarters
That the friend I love—which is ARTHUR B.—
Agrees (what else could he do ?) with ME.
COUSIN HUGH (overjoyed).
I knew it, I knew it: it's most absurd
To ask for a simpler, plainer word.
We 've won the fight and weathered the storm,
So fetch me a telegraphic form.
I shall wire to the Free Food League, "His sins
Have found out JOSEPH, and Free Trade wins!"
UNCLE HENRY CHAPLIN (ore rotunda).
I recognise, I admit, nay I even go so far as to dare,
Or, if I might be allowed to say so, to venture to declare
That of all the amazing, astounding and portentous efforts of
oratory
That I have ever heard with my auricular appendages or
even read of in story,
This last performance of our trusted, nay I might almost say,
our thoroughly trusted leader,
In thus stating himself in no ambiguous or even doubtful
terms to be anything rather than a free-feeder—
This performance, as I say (and I know he required great
courage to risk it),
Unquestionably takes, if I may so put it, the bun, or, in
other words, the biscuit.
By thus dissipating and scattering all doubt he has put to
flight the Free Trade vulture,
And struck a mighty blow for the good, the benefit and the
well-being of Agriculture.
CHORUS OF PLAIN MEN.
We are all of us groping in darkness with never a glimmer
of light,
Oh Zeus, put an end to our labours and lead us, oh lead us,
aright;
We have studied the speeches of ARTHUR; his half-sheet of
paper we 've seen,
And we haven't the ghost of a notion—have you ?—what the
dickens they mean.
For first he 's a Tariff-Reformer—at least he is strongly
imbued
With the virtues of Tariff-Reforming that doesn't conflict
with Free Food.
And next he 's a sturdy Free Trader—that is, he is ready to go
As far as his duty permits with the duties suggested by JOE.
In short, he is always declaring his views are as clear as a
bell:
I le objects to Free Trade and, heij-presto, objects to Protection
as well.
So for our part we fancy there's one thing as plain as the
nose on his face:
Little ARTHUR won't stick at a trifle in order to stick to his place.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Tuesday.—La Trainata, poor dear lady of less than doubt-
ful reputation, and, despite her fifty years, going strong, re-
appeared to-night. Madame MELHA, as \7ioletta, whose healthy
appearance would liave deceived any physician, sang better
than ever, receiving loud calls, and, after the First Act,
tumultuous applause. As long as there is an artiste capable
of sustaining Violetta's musical reputation, La Traviata will
not be willingly allowed to die. Her spoony young man
from the country, Alfredo, was admirably represented by
Signer DE MARCHI. For the heavy father, old Oeorgey Germont,
no one more capable in every way could have been selected
than Signor STRACCIARI.
It was quite a fireworky-rocket night for the curtain, which
went up at the hour of 8.30, went up again three times
to enthusiastic applause after the First and the Second Acts,
and twice after the Third Act. If the receipts are only
going up as briskly as did the curtain to-night, then will the
Managers and members of the syndicate be indeed satisfied.
Saturday.—New opera, Andrea Chenier, announced for to-
night, but it is outside our time-limit for the week. Also is
announced for November 19 an " Operatic Concert, organised
by Madame MELBA and the Artistes of the San Carlo Company
in aid of the families rendered destitute by the earthquakes
in Calabria." Music hath charms which may well be
employed for charitable purposes.
Post Obiter Dictum.

he thinks he's dead.
THE poster of an evening paper of the 10th inst. announced:

It was felt that this would make rather more copy than
the corresponding theme:—
What Russia thinks of Mr. STKAD.
DONS IN DIFFICULTIES.—At the end of last week the authorities
at Cambridge were said to be "much concerned how to cope
effectually with the situation" which some rowdy University
men had created on the "Town and Gown" night. The

their official brethren in difficulties at the Royal University
of Ireland.

UNWOMANLY MEN.
[Mr. BALFOCR'S assertion that he was fully
conscious of the suffering of the unemployed
has been vehemently impugned by a writer in
the Daily News of the 8th inst., who remarks:
"Mr. BALFOUR is a comfortably situated bachelor.
It is a fact which accounts for many things. I
doubt whether the PRIME MINISTER has ever in
his life sat through a single night soothing a
fretful child. Yet he has the audacity to say
he knows!"]
UNFORTUNATELY this is not the only
instance of unwomanly conduct on the
part of prominent politicians, careful
investigations having revealed several
other cases at least as unpardonable as
that of the PREMIER.
Thus it is extremely doubtful whether
Mr. CADBURY has ever wheeled an infant
for more than two hours in a perambu-
lator.
We have the best authority for stating
that at no period of his distinguished
career has Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE filled the
role of a tweeny-maid.
The reason for the small majority by
which Mr. HALDANE was elected Rector
of Edinburgh University is commonly
attributed in Radical circles not to his
strong Imperialistic tendencies, but to
the deplorable fact that, as he himself
frankly admitted, he has never worn
high-heeled shoes and was unable to
milk a cow.
A painful sensation was created at a
Liberal meeting recently held in Chelsea
when Mr. LEONARD COURTNEY, in reply
to persistent heckling, boldly declared
that in no circumstances whatever would
he consent to wear a fringe.
Great indignation has been excited in
Northampton by the behaviour of Mr.
LADOUCHERE. During a recent sojourn
in that town, while visiting the house of
one of his constituents, he was asked to
rock the cradle of the youngest member
of the family in order to enable the
mother to attend a football match. Mr.
LABOUCHERE declined on the ground that
he had never done such a thing before,
and might possibly upset the cradle.
This distressing avowal has, in the
opinion of the Secretary of the local
Conservative Association, rendered Mr.
LABOUCHERE'S retention of his seat highly
improbable.
On the other hand, Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL'S prospects in Manchester have
materially improved since he has taken
to skirt dancing and crewel work.

PLEASANT FOR GILES.
A/jag Nimrod. "MIND YOU TUCK YOUR HEAD IN, GILES, DIRECTLY THE BABBIT BOLTS!"
THE PUBLIC BUFFOON.
THE railway carriage had only one
other occupant, and as I took my seat I
was struck with his expression of sup-
pressed mirth. He appeared to be
enjoying some tremendous jest which
convulsed his whole frame and seemed
to be searching for the weak places in
his clothing in order to effect an exit.
Being of a sedate temperament, and,
though not unsociable, careful about
making chance acquaintances, I en-
deavoured, by burying myself, as they
say, in my newspaper, to show him that
I was ignorant of his presence. But he
disinterred me.
"May I lend you a gamp?" he asked.
"Thank you," I said, frigidly. "I
have my own gam—umbrella, and the
carriage is, I believe, watertight. In
any case, it is not raining." That, I
thought, woidd close the incident.
But no. With huge enjoyment, and
'an indescribable amount of chuckling,
he pointed to the door.
1 followed the direction of his finger,
and read, " Wait until the rain stops."
It should have been "train," but the
"t" was concealed by a piece of stamp-
paper.
"Pshaw !"wasmycomment. "Pshaw"
is a scathing word, the effect of which I
have always hoped to have an oppor-
tunity of testing. I hardly realised my
expectations. My companion burst into
unrestrained guffaws, and prodded me
with his thumb in the region of my
watch-pocket.
"It's a joke," he gurgled. "Don't
you see?"
"No," I said; "but I feel."
He rocked to and fro in an ecstasy of
mirth, slapping his knees, and rubbing
his liands together.
"I was speaking seriously," I said,_in
my iciest tone of voice.
"Yes, yes," he cried. "I know, I
know. That's where the joke comes
in." Here, once more, he drove the
point into my waistcoat with his thumb-
nail.
"I would rather the joke did not
come in there," said I, diverting his
attack with mv hand.
"Ha, ha, ha!" he bellowed. "You 're
a typical Englishman. You take your
jesting so seriously."
"Did you stick on that piece of
paper?" I demanded, indignantly.
"Of course I did. And look behind
you on the partition. 'Five cats.' Isn't
that splendid? It took me twenty
minutes to alter 'seats' into 'cats.'"
Dreading what I should see, I raised
my eyes above the cat inscription, and
saw another specimen of his handi-
work. "Tliis rack," I read, "is for
light articles only. It must—blur—be
used for heavy luggage." The blur was
a blue pencil-mark.
"That's mine, too," he screamed in a
voice choking with laughter.
"Tell me," I said, " do you do much
of this sort of thing?"
"All of it!" he exclaimed proudly.
"I turn 'Billposters' into 'Pillposters,'
'Notice' into 'No ice '—all that. One of
my best was in Surrey during an epidemic
of swine fever. I changed nearly all the
bills into ' Wine Ever.'"
"But why?" I asked. "Why do you
doit?"
"It's funny," he explained.
"But," I protested, "why be funny
on this stupendous scale? It's not—
well, it's not the thing; really it isn't.
And people don't appreciate it."
"Ah, but they do. Perhaps you won't
believe me, but—well, you know those
new electric trains they are running?"
"Yes," I said.
"Now, I dare say you've heard a lot
of complaints about them? People say
they 're draughty, that there's not
enough class distinction, and so on.
Well, the real objection is that they give
no scope for humour. You see, there
are always too many people about, to
say nothing of the conductor. You
can't get a car to yourself. Still, 1 'm
certain I should die of laughter if
only the Company would give me an
opportunity."
"I 'm sure I wish they would," said I,
fervently.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.

"AN IMPREGNABLE POSITION."
"Now THKN, Yl)C YOUNO VARMINT, COOM DOT o' THERE AFOBE I COTCHES 'OLU ON YEB!"
A RATHER REMARKABLE REGIMENT.
(Aa presented on the Stage of a "Fit-up" Theatre in the Provinces.)
HILLDON, the sleepy little town some forty miles from
London where I happen to be staying, does not possess a
regular theatre. But from some gorgeous red and yellow
posters on walls and in shop-windows I discovered that a
temporary wooden playhouse had established itself on the
Fair Field. Also that on a particular evening the "Splendid
Military Drama,' Death or Glory Boys,' " was to be presented.
There was a note stating that "Mr. BLAVK (the Manager) has
been to London aud bought some Lancers' uniforms, pur-
posely for this play, and, apart from that, it is one of the
most highly sensational Dramas ever placed upon any Eng-
lish stage." It was simply impossible to resist such induce-
ments as these.
The First Act had already begun when I entered the
shilling stalls, and there were no programmes, but I gathered
—from the dialogue, not from the scene itself, which, except
that it resembled nothing in existence, might have been
anywhere—that we were supposed to be outside a farmhouse
occupied by the Hero, Jack Hllldon (whose surname I fancy
was a delicate compliment to the audience) and his sister,
Edith. It soon appeared that Jack was secretly in love with
Nina, the daughter of Colonel Fortescue, of the "Deatli or
Glory Boys." In spite of the inferiority of his social position,
she might have returned his affection, but for the fact that
she was already engaged to the villain, Captain Ferrers.
Why she had done this, as she did not affect to regard him
with anything but instinctive loathing, she forgot to explain.
Presently, when the stage was clear, the villain came out
with his soldier-servant—a minion of the name of Came, to
whom he confided a little scheme for deceiving Jack's sister
Edith by a mock private marriage, which Came undertook
to arrange for him. Perhaps it was slightly rash of the
Captain to discuss the matter at the top of a naturally
powerful voice just outside Edith's window, and lie had reason
to regret this indiscretion later, when Edith denounced him
before the Colonel, Nina, and Jack, as the villain he undoubt-
edly was. For Jack immediately produced a revolver which,
as a fanner, he probably found useful for keeping down the
rabbits, and threatened to shoot Ferrers like a dog unless he
instantly agreed to right Edith by marriage. Ferrers did
not lose his presence of mind; he declared that Edith was
hysterical, and her story a lie, while he quietly handed Carne
his hunting-crop, and instructed him to knock Jack down
with it. Which Carne was just about to do—when Jacks
bailiff, Nat (the comic man) came in behind with a spade
and felled Carne. Whereupon Jack fired, and brought down
both villain and curtain.
In the next Act it was only to be expected that Jack and
Nat, believing themselves to be murderers, should evade
justice by enlisting as troopers in the regiment of Jack's
old friend, Colonel Fortescue. And they did so. And the
Colonel, a fine old soldier, in the simple uniform of a London
park-keeper, with grey hair which was, perhaps, j ust a trifle
long behind, was delighted to see Jack when he entered, in
an imperfectly buttoned tunic, with despatches, and shook
him warmly by the hand, as did his daughter and a young
subaltern of the name of Duff, with a good heart and an
eyeglass. As it turned out, Captain Ferrers and Carne had
not been killed, or even hurt, after all, and the Captain
declared, with transparent hypocrisy, that ho bore Jack no
malice and should have done the same in his place. He

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
also produced a letter (which the invaluable Carne has just
forged for him) purporting to come from Edith and retracting
all charges against his character as a soldier and gentleman.
But Jack was not to be mollified; he said he would serve
Ferrers in the same way again, if he got the chance.
The "Death or Glory Boys" seemed, on these boards at
all events, a cheery, easy-going regiment, with no pedantic
notions of distinction of ranks, or discipline, or nonsense of
that kind. Captain Ferrers and Lieutenant Duff were the
only officers besides the Colonel, and wore precisely the same
tunics as their men. Captain Ferrers had won a medal
somewhere, and sported it on all occasions, but nobody
appeared in spurs. Nat, the comic trooper, seldom indulged
the villain with a salute, and addressed him as " Old Bloke,"
which the villain, though he "girned," did not dare to resent
openly. And when Jack thrashed the Captain severely
with a stout stick, in Duff's presence, for some sneering
allusion to Miss Fortescue, and Ferrers called Duff to witness
that he had been assaulted by his inferior in rank, the good-
hearted young fellow merely replied, "Sorry, but I 'm
retained by the other side, dear old chappie!" (he always
addressed the villain in this manner, with the worst possible
effect on his temper). "I shall swear I saw nothing. And if
he hadn't thrashed you, I 'd have done it myself!" So Jack
got off that time. But the villain, as villains will, swore to
be even with him. He summoned the faithful Carne, and
together they concocted another diabolical scheme. Ferrers
would post Jack on sentry-go that night near his own
quarters by the shrubbery, and Carne was to swear that he
saw him leave his post, enter the Captain's room, and, after
coming out, throw away an empty bottle labelled "Poison,"
with which bottle, as a damning piece of circumstantial
evidence, the villain thoughtfully furnished his accomplice.
In the next scene we saw the hero on sentry-go in a field-
service cap and the imperfectly buttoned tunic, and armed
with a cane. The poor fellow was torn by a sense of
divided duty. He was on sentry-go at the very hour for which
he had an appointment with Miss Fortescue, who wished to
talk to him about Edith! Luckily, the devoted Nat found
a way out of this dilemma for him, by nobly undertaking to
do sentry-go in his stead.
Then Carne came on, reading a bundle of compromising
letters which his villainous master had given him to destroy,
and from.which he discovered that the Captain was the
hitherto unknown destroyer of his domestic bliss. But this
was merely introduced as an additional proof of Ferrers'
thoroughgoing scoundrelism—for, though it annoyed Carne
for the moment, it did not affect his fidelity to his master.
So, in the next scene, the unfortunate Jack was brought
before the Colonel and charged by Carne, not only with
entering Captain Ferrers' quarters and poisoning his drink-
ing-water, but also with deserting his post, and smoking and
drinking while on sentry-go. Jack indignantly denied
all but the third charge, and Not, who strolled in to the
Colonel's quarters opportunely, was easily able to show
that he was the person who after taking Jack's duty had
done the drinking and smoking. Still, as the Colonel very
shrewdly pointed out, if Jack hadn't been in Captain Ferrers'
quarters poisoning his drinking-water, where had he been?
Jack, like a true hero, declined to answer, when Miss
Fortescue entered, and explained everything. And Jack
would have been doubtless dismissed with a gentle reprimand
if only he hadn't rushed at Captain Ferrers and throttled
him within an inch of his life. Even the Colonel could not
overlook this. Consequently Jack was sent to the cells.
In the next Act Captain Ferrers was very busy. First
he bullied Edith into admitting that she wrote the forged
letter on the plea that, " bad as he was," he loved his military
career, and didn't want to have to send in his papers just when
the regiment was ordered to Zululand, and that, if she con-
sented, he would procure her brother's pardon. Then he
forced Nina to agree to marry him at once on condition that
he spared JacTc. Then he interviewed Jack in the cells,
showed him a letter which he produced from the lappel of
his tunic, and which he had written to the Colonel asking
for Jack's release, and offered to send it if Jack would start
that evening for America or Australia. Jack refused, and
soon afterwards escaped from prison with the utmost ease.
The next scene was the exterior of what was understood
to be a church. Ferrers and Nina were being married
within, and Duff and a trooper were on guard outside, with
strict orders from Ferret's to allow nobody to pass. But
Duff could not resist Jack's impassioned appeal to let him
in to forbid the banns. As Duff said, " Duty be hanged! He
was a Soldier—but he was a Man as well!" So he let Jack
through. Unfortunately it was just too late. At that precise
moment the villain came out in full uniform, medal and all,
with Nina in bridal array on his arm. Nina flew to Jack's
arms. Ferrers ordered him to be arrested. Jack reminded
him that he had promised to write a letter to the Colonel
asking for his pardon. Ferrers said he lied. Upon which
Duff, with an intuition which did him great credit, abstracted
that identical letter from Ferrers' tunic, and handed it to the
Colonel, who, after reading it, ordered Jack to be released,
and Ferrers arrested in his stead. Tableau and Curtain.
In the last Act two years were supposed to have elapsed.
A Military Garden-Party was in progress, as was evident
from the decanter of sherry and wine-glasses on a side-table.
The guests, for some reason, did not turn up.
We learnt that Jack had distinguished himself in the
Zulu War, having got his commission and a V.C. But he
was just the same unassuming hearty fellow, with his trooper's
tunic as imperfectly buttoned as ever. Then Ferrers turned up
unexpectedly, seedy and starving, and informed Lieutenant
Duff (who, by the way, was now engaged to Edith) that he
had come to enlist as a trooper in his old regiment. The good-
hearted young subaltern pointed out that, considering Ferrers
had been kicked out of it and was hated by every man there,
he would hardly be an ideal recruit. He suggested suicide as
Ferrers' only resource, and mentioned that he would find a
bottle of deadly poison in a medicine-chest on one of the
garden seats. I didn't gather why Duff had brought a
medicine-chest to a military garden party—but possibly he
knew the Colonel's sherry. Then, considerately remarking
that he should be back in a quarter of an hour, he left Ferrers
alone with the chest. The ex-Captain removed the poison-
bottle, and at that moment Nina came out, recognised her
husband, and fainted in his arms, as any heroine would in
such circumstances. He all but gave way to the temptation to
insert the poison between her parted lips—but, as he observed:
"Bad as he was, God help him, he couldn't do that I"
When he was alone again he resolved to toss up for life or
death, but, not possessing a halfpenny, tossed up with the
medal that still adorned his chest. It came down " Suicide."
But, suddenly recollecting that, if he died as a civilian, he
would not have a military funeral, on which he had apparently
set his heart, he rushed off the stage.
Shortly afterwards, just as the genial old Colonel was hand-
ing round glasses of sherry to Nina, Jack, and Duff, and
proposing a toast, the villain returned, seized a glass of sherry,
poured poison into it, and, with the announcement that he had
just become a trooper in his old regiment, drank to the " Death
or Glory Boys," and expired immediately, to the mild
surprise of the other characters—especially Duff, who pre-
served a discreet silence about the medicine-chest. With that
the play ended, leaving us to infer that Jack would before
long lead Mrs. Ferrers to the altar, though, rather to my
surprise, the audience, after being uproariously entertained
by the villain's dying agonies, received the final fall of the
curtain with absolute apathy. F. A.

THE PET-DOG'S MANUAL
OF ETIQUETTE FOR VISITORS.
THIS little work is primarily intended
for the use of visitors to country houses,
but hostesses will also do well to peruse
it, as it may give them useful hints as
to whom to invite to their house parties.
I will begin with
the Amval, which
is the easiest part
of the visit. The
visitor, as a rule,
arrives about tea-
time and has usu-
ally the sense to
say at once, "What
a darling dog!'
Then the hostess
brightens up and
says, "Isn't he?"
and gives one a
saucer of cream.
Here I would insert
a word of warliing
to ths visitor not
to expatiate ori the
accomplishments of
the Pet Dog that

believe that the
visitor would not
even smile if the
butler were to place
a potato on the top
of Tier head at din-
ner and then expect
her to toss it neatly
into her plate.
After tea the visi-
tor should go at
once to her room.
The Pet Dog natur-
ally expects to have
the hearth-rug to
himself between
toa and dinner, and
I have known a
dog disturbed for
the whole evening by a screen being
placed in front of the fire to keep a
visitor cool. Such thoughtlessness!
For dinner the visitor should wear a
white satin frock. It should have
rather a long train, so that the Pet Dog
may have plenty of room to lie on it
under the diiiing-table. Nothing makes
a better background for a bone than
smooth white satin. Every Pet Dog
knows how trying it is to eat a compli-
cated bone on a rough dark carpet, upon the visitor to make quite sure she has

at. for mentioning that his heroine I than her protests at the end of the visit
that she "is sorry

Breakfast again
is a miserable mo-
ment for the Pet
Dog. That, I ad-
mit, is greatly the
fault of the lady
of the house, but
as this Manual is
for visitors I will
merely point out
how the tactful
guest may lighten
the gloom. Of
course I am not

who breakfast on a

is extraordinary
how seldom the

often seen her pass
over an excellent

bones and take
something foolish

it is impossible to

Here I must cau-
tion her against that
deplorable habit of
visitors — designed
to curry favour with
the lady of the
house — of asking
whether she may
feed one. Nothing
is more underbred
than to make pry-
ing inquiries into

door, return to her seat, but it is hardly
worth •while taking up her pen, as he
will certainly want to be let out again in
a few seconds—not having had any
reason for coming in. After going in
and out about twenty times (he will find
towards the eighteenth time that the
visitor becomes hard-hearted and he will
have to whine piteously before she will
open the door), he may get bored with
this. The visitor need not try to amuse
him by talking to him. It may seem
harsh, but it is better to say at once
that a visitor's conversation can do
nothing but make one yawn.
There is a way in which the
visitor can really be of use,
and that is in throwing one's
ball. Yet how seldom do we
find that she is genuinely
anxious to repay one's hos-
pitality by the only means in
her power! It makes my
blood boil when a full-grown
woman says, after throwing
one's ball for only a quarter-
of-an-hour, that " she is tired."
If this be true, she should
never have accepted one's
mistress's invitation. Inva-
lids are quite out of place in
a country house, and the
visitor ought not to be there
at all, but in the consulting
room of a good London Phy-
sician, who could be depended
on to give her a suitable
tonic.
Later the lady of the house
will probably return and pro-
pose a walk. As she cannot
be expected to know the indi-
vidual tastes of each guest,
the visitor had better mention
casually that she is particularly
fond of rabbit-holes, or thatshe
would enjoy a nice little turn
round the dust-heap.
If it's Sunday, the hostess
is sure to ask whether she 'd
like to see the stables. I
advise the visitor to make a!
polite excuse for not going.
There is absolutely nothing to eat
there.
The home farm is well worth a visit.
There is a splendid rubbish-heap there,
and then there is the chicken-food to
eat. One is always called greedy for
taking that, and I don't know why, for
it isn't at all nice, only of course one
always likes to take it away from the
chickens.
When one gets home, it's lunch-time,
and here the visitor needn't bother, for,
naturally, the Dog's dinner is at this
meal carefully prepared from the nicest
bits by the lady of the house. So the
visitor can eat what she likes, as long as
she is quick about it, for sometimes the
Pet Dog has to wait till visitors have
been helped.
And now comes the moment when the
visitor fails moat lamentably in her
relations with the Pet Dog. I allude to
the afternoon drive. It will, perhaps,
hardly be believed that never—no, never
—have I seen the visitor take the small
third seat in the victoria. She must
realise that it is meant for her, because
it is only let
but as sure as
down when she is there,
there is a visitor it is I
who have to sit on that narrow slippery
seat, while she lolls in comfort in my

I think the only point left to mention
is the visitor's departure. Of course, it
is a joyful moment for the Pet Dog, and
I suppose that must be the reason why
the guest thinks that the remuneration
considered necessary for the rest of the
establishment can be omitted in his case.
Another reason I have seen gravely
stated is the difficulty of procuring a
suitable honorarium for the Pet Dog.
This is the most unworthy subterfuge.
I hear visitors speak as a matter of
course of having received a box of
peaches or a whole Jiaunch of venison,
and then they have the hypo-
crisy to pretend there would
; l)e a difficulty in having a
quarter of a found of liver
handed to their young friend.
And so the Pet Dog sees the
butler largely tipped while he
is passed over entirely, or,
whatJSs even worse, the visitor

place by her hostess's side. I have no
doubt that my mistress would willingly
exchange seats with me, but that would
be to point out too plainly the visitor's
failure in good manners, so the Pet Dog
has to suffer. This seems such an
ingrained fault in visitors that I cannot
hope to cure it, so I will merely suggest
that the visitor should at once begin to
talk "Chiffons" seriously, in order that
the Pet Dog may have plenty of time to
gnaw the buttons off the leather seat
unobserved.
He will be slapped afterwards, of
course, but the buttons will be safely off
by that time, and one's mistress's slaps
never hurt.

the question put by JAMES
McNsiLL WHISTLER to a fervent
admirer who had expressed
himself to the effect that for
him "there were only two

the gallery of Messrs. AGNEW,
in Old Bond Street, a splendid
specimen of VELASQUEZ with
a remarkable history. It ought
to be secured for the National
Gallery. Perhaps ere this
brief note appears the N. G.
may have already secured it.
Why allow VELASQUEZ to be
conveyed away to America?
Let us hope that this VELAS-
QUEZ has come to stay, and that
its future address may be

tees, National Gallery, Trafalgar Square,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. BIRRELL artfully opens his study of the life and works
of ANDREW MARVELL, a. late addition to the Macmillan series
of " English Men of Letters," by protesting that there is no
material at hand for describing the former. "A more
illusive, non-recorded character is hard to be found. We
know all about him, but very little of him." Story, God bless
you! Mr. BIRRELL has none to tell. Nevertheless, he proceeds
to construct an interesting volume of 232 pages. Many are
occupied by citation of passages from the poet, and are
certainly none the less attractive on that score. Others
reproduce the pith of letters written by MARVELL from West-
minster to his constituents at Hull. These, 350 in number,
present a unique record of Parliamentary doings during the
years he sat in the House. The manuscript is preserved in
the archives of Hull. MARVEI.L did not attempt the pictur-
esque description with which the public of to-day is familiar.
His Parliamentary summary was a business-like, unadorned
catalogue of work attempted or accomplished. CHARI.ES LAMB,
one of the earliest declared admirers of MILTON'S secretary,
would justly prefer his poetry to his prose. In the " Horatian
Ode," dedicated to CROMWELL, there are two stanzas in which
my Baronite discerns the prophetic soul of the poet. Address-
ing the PROTECTOR he sings:—
into the picture, renaming it Castlewood. As a matter of
fact, it was quite another character THACKERAY drew from
his much admired friend. He told BROOKFIELD that though
Amelia was not a copy of Mrs. BROOKFIELD he should not have
conceived the character if he had not known her. The
editors of the book, CHARLES and FRANCES BROOKFIELD, have
done well to give the title-role to the wife though Mr. BROOK-
FIELD figures largely in the story, especially in the matter of
letters, some of which—notably a series wherein he lectures his
fiancee on the iniquity, co-ordinate, of either writing too much,
involving him in postal charges for overweight, or writing
less quantity than the stamps used would have franked—
might with advantage have been omitted. The fearsomely
funny letters passing between him and his sometime pupil,
Lord LYTTELTON, might also have been left in the privacy of
the family archives. W. H. BROOKFIELD would have been all
right had he had the stage to himself. With his charming
wife unconsciously filling it, his somewhat obtrusive lustre is
dimmed. But it is ungracious to belittle any portion o£a work
which opens for us the inner doors of the circle of literary
giants whose works illumined the mid-nineteenth century.
Portraits given of some of them add to the interest and value
i of a couple of delightful volumes.
But them, the war's and fortune's
March iudefatigably on! [eon,
And for the last effect
Still keep the sword erect.
Besides the force it has to fright
The spirits of the shady night,
The same arts that did gain
A power, must it maintain.
If ANDREW MARVELL, peering through the mists of two
centuries and a half, did not in writing this dimly perceive
Mr. ARTHUR BALFOUR, " the (Khaki) war's son," inflamed by pure
patriotism, holding on to office for the "last effect" of the
Redistribution Bill, the coincidence is curious. Mr. BIRRELL'S
book takes, and will keep, a high place in the series. Which
is approbation indeed.
Trouble in the Balkans (HURST AND BLACKETT) is by J. L. C.
BOOTH, a clever artist and a light-handed writer, who
seems to have given himself a lot of trouble in the Balkans
and in Macedonia. The reader will soon become interested,
apart from all political questions, in the author's vivacious
narrative, and will derive both instruction and amusement
from his sketches, and from his more finished pictures,
"plain and coloured."
Sir ISAAC PITMAN'S firm, new, my Baronite fancies, to the
field of publishing, are fortunate in following up their start
with presenting the two handsome volumes which record the
gossip and the correspondence of Mrs. Brook field and lier
Circle. The BROOKFIELDS had the good fortune to live in the
Augustan epoch of the reign of Queen VICTORIA. Their circle
included TENNYSON, THACKERAY, the ASHBURTONS, EGBERT
BROWNING, CHARLES BULLER, CARLYLE, our DICKY DOYLE, ADELAIDE
PROCTOR, SAMUEL ROGERS, MACAULAY, Lord JOHN MANNERS,
MONCKTON MlLNES, GEORGE VENABLES, and HENRY HALLAM, Mrs.
BROOKFIELD'S uncle. She was a lady who, without premedi-
tated effort, made captive all men who came within the influence
of her presence. An engraving from a portrait painted by
RICHMOND when she was thirty years of age testifies to the
exceeding sweetness of her countenance. Her letters and
extracts from her diary preserve some memories of her intellec-
tual graces. THACKERAY was among her rnosttlevoted admirers.
There is a tradition that she unconsciously sat to him as a
model for one of his most beautiful characters—Lady Castle-
wood, whom Esmond loved. My Baronite does not know any
evidence for that suggestion beyond the fact that in 1848,
whilst he was writing Pendennis, THACKERAY visited with the
BROOKFIELDS her father's house, Clevedon Court. Planning
Esmond he,attracted by its mediaeval charms, dragged Clevedon
While the Baron was reading The Lake (HEINEMANN) the
probability occurred to him that its gifted author, Mr. GEORGE
MOORE, might have been influenced by some reminiscence of
TM Faute de I'Abbe Mor^eau. Himself an Irishman, with, it is
probable, exceptional advantages for knowing the ground
over which he was going to travel, he must have been aware
of the great danger and difficulty of the literary task towards
which he felt himself irresistibly attracted. He has given
us an analytical novel. There is, strictly speaking, no action.
The study is laboriously worked out. The greater part of
the novel consists of letters from Rose Leicester to Oliver
Gogarty, and his replies. She says, " Do you like my letters?
They don't bore you, do they? If I thought they did I
shouldn't write any more." Had the Baron got to answer
this question the novel would have been finished at this
point. Its cleverness is undeniable, so too, the Baron thinks,
is its tediousness.
The approach of Christmas time naturally recalls the
memory of KATE GREENAWAY. How delightfully quaint
were all her figures, how dainty in colouring, what humour
in expression, and, on occasion, how touchingly serious! It is
impossible, within the limits of a paragraph, for the Baron to
deal with such a subject, and therefore, having with the great-
est pleasure perused and examined the book by Messrs.
M. H. SPIELMANN and G. S. LAYARD, entitled Kate Greenaway
(A. & C. BLACK), he can only refer all his readers to the work
itself. They have a real treat before them, which they will
thoroughly enjoy.
Not so very long ago dissent as to the value of any proposed
venture used to be expressed in a cant phrase, "That won't

BORROWING.
Is IT PAST REMEDY?
discovery of reading, with which
the year 1905 will ever be associated,
and the synchronical conception of
libraries all over the country, may be
found not to be without drawbacks.
Already, indeed, we understand, the
fashion of having a volume in tl e
hand, whether or not it is being perused,
luis so taken possession of many persons
that forcible borrowing and even the
theft of works is becoming as prevalent
as an epidemic. Just as a few winters
ago everyone had to possess a ping-pong
racquet, now everyone who values his
birthright as an imitative animal must
be accompanied by literature.
The result is that since the more no-
torious circulating libraries are so full
that no more tickets can be issued for
some weeks, people are having to get
their books as they can, and a grave
situation has arisen among those who
love their shelves and loved them before
the present unhappy and feverishly
perusing year saw the light. As some
deterrent to crime, packets of book-
plates have been placed on the market,
to establish the identity of the rightful
owner of the volume the more securely;
but this is held to be but a feeble pro-
tection, and the opinions of expert book-
men have therefore been solicited on
the subject. We append a few replies:
Dr. GARNETT, late Chief Librarian of the
British Museum, writes: "What I know
of human nature, acquired during long
years of service in Bloomsbury, convinces
me that the mere affixing of a book-plate
to the inside cover of a volume will not
preserve that volume from the predatory
borrower. No matter how adhesive the
mucilage, there is a perfect solvent in
hot water."
Mr. J. HOLT SCHOOLING writes: "Sta-
tistics, which cannot lie, show that out
of every 100 persons who take an interest
in reading only three buy books, and
two of those try to get them second-hand.
The remainder are borrowers. Nothing
will alter these figures."
Mr. HARKY KEEPS writes: "My theory
has always been that a book belongs to
the reader who can best understand it,
or to whom its message is imparted with
least diminution of the author's purpose.
It is on this principle that my library
has been amassed, and it now numbers
many thousand volumes."
"Those who go a-lencling go a-sorrow-
ing" writes: "Nothing will deter the
professional book-borrower. I have
done everything in human power, but
to no purpose. I have chained every
volume to the wall—and he has filed
through the chain. I have passed a
strong electric current through every

have let loose a mastiff in the library—
and the mastiff alone has not been
abstracted in the night. Book-borrowers
are not to be overcome."
"One who knows " writes: "There is
one way, and one only, to stop people
from borrowing and keeping one's books.
Book-plates are useless. The only way
is to fill your shelves with books that
they do not want; the works, for exam-
ple, of and and .

most favourably received. The story is simple enough.
During the " Reign of Terror" Andrea Chenier gains the love
of Maddalena, who dies with him on the guillotine.
On this first occasion the orchestra was somewhat too loud
(that's one effect of nervousness), and the singers not quite
loud enough,—another effect of nerves. As Andrea Signer

received immense and thoroughly well-deserved applause in

—a little thing of his own—whereat the stage guests appeared
somewhat shocked, but the audience was delighted.
Signor SAMMAROO came out powerfully, histrionically and
vocally, as Gerard, wl o, a simple Jeames, footman in the
household of the Countess, becomes an ultra-republican, and
does his very best to get Andrea guillotined. Why? Because
Andrew, the unmerry but musical, has won the heart of
Maddalena, with whom Gerard-J'eamen, her democratic
domestic, is madly in lo\e.

Maddalena, who scorns the flunkey and succumbs to the
poet, was admirable in every way. Signora DE CISNEROS
doubled the parts of Bersi, a comparatively insignificant friend
of the heroine, and Madelon, an old lady who gives her
son to the Revolution, and in this latter scene her acting
was very fine. Signora DE CISNEROS made a great impression.
All the smaller parts were adequately tilled. • Signora
ZACCARIA made a pleasing personage of Countess Coigny, and
Signor THOS was good as Rancher, friend of the poet Chenier.
Signor WULMANN, not, perhaps, quite realising CARLYLE'S
description of the thorough-going republican revolutionist he
was impersonating, namely, Fouquier-Tinville, made the most
of the small part, and Signor WIOLEY was not a whit behind
him in his representation of his confrere Mathieu.
Scenery effective; revolutionary mob ditto. The four-Act
opera plays quickly, and would be over in a comparatively
short time but for the "waits" between the Acts. Added
'' waits " will made the lightest opera heavy. So far, this new
opera may be reckoned as an undoubted success. Conductor
MUGXOTCE, and all concerned in it, are to be congratulated.
Wednesday.—h'igoletto. ''In Italian" it is stated in the
programme. But when was it ever given in English (except
as The Fool's Revenge], or in French (except as a drama), or
in Dutch, or in any other language save Italian? However,
Italian it is. A somewhat sparse but very enthusiastic
audience to welcome the first-rate rendition of Rigoletto by
Signor BATTISTINI. "What shall he do who cometh after
the King?" Well, there has been more than one King of
Lyric Drama in this same part, and who comes after them must
follow, unless he takes a line of his own, which Signor BATTISTIM
certainly did, and achieved an undoubted success. After
the Third Act the reception of the duet was so overpowering
that, willy-nilly, Signora CLASENTI as Gilda (singing and
playing well, not great) and Signor BATTISTIXI were com-
pelled, at least they seemed to have agreed between them-
selves that they ue.re compelled, to give an encore of their
fine performance. Mistake this.
No great shakes in Dukes was the II Duca of Signor
GiORom; tuneful, nice, but a Duke without any dash.
Capital was Signor WULMANN as the melodramatic Sparafucile.
Signora ZACCARIA as Maddalena, pleasing; and Signor THOS
came out histrionically and musically strong as II Conte di
Monterone. Signor MUGNONE conducting himself and his
orchestra in fine style, and all's well with the world at
Covent Garden.
Another War Office Exposure.
"SHOCKED SPINSTER" calls our attention to a statement in
The Daily Mail, to the effect that, on the occasion of the
progress of the King of the HELLENES to the Guildhall, "the
soldiers, clad only in tJieir scarlet tunics, presented an un-
pleasant contrast with the warmly-clad members of the
police force." Italics by " Shocked Spinster " herself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
CAP'EN DREW DRAWS.
AT the New Theatre the four-Act play by Mr. H. H. DA VIES,
entitled Captain Drew on Leave, has achieved success mainly
through the admirable interpretation given it by Sir CHARLES
WYNDHAM'S well-chosen company. Commencing so quietly
as to almost threaten the spectator with progressive weari-
ness, the interest is gradually worked up to an undoubtedly
fine dramatic climax in the Third Act, perfectly rendered by
Miss MAEION TERRY as Mrs. Moxon, and Sir CHARLES WYNDHAM
as Captain Drew, K.N. Indeed tliroughout the play, with
the performance of Sir CHARLES appearing at first as the
gay, reckless Lothario, and at last as the conscience-struck
"convertite," no fault can possibly be found. The character
is represented to us, presumably, according to the author's
intention; ?a suffit. So too for Miss MARION TERRY'S Mrs.
Moxon; her charm of manner as pure wife and mother, her
innocence, her unaffected surprise at her own defection from
the straight and narrow road of virtue, and her revul-
sion of feeling against this new self which has suddenly
been called into being, all these phases of character are so
forcibly depicted by this clever actress as to win, for -the
erring wife, sympathy that should be due to the good, stolid,
devoted husband.
To satisfactorily represent such a character as the husband
Mr. Moxon, modelled, apparently, on that of John Mildmay
in Still Waters Run Deep, is an artistic task of no little
difficulty, for which it would be difficult to find an actor better
fitted than Mr. Louis CALVERT, who plays it impressively and
without the slightest exaggeration.
Mr. EILLE NORWOOD achieves a triumph of art in so repre-
senting the unprincipled scoundrel, Mr. Hassal, as to rescue
this very ordinary commonplace character from the grip of
thorough-going conventional melodrama. Everybody at all
conversant with the stage knows this villain. Why the author
should have added drunkenness to his other vices is not
quite clear.
That a naval officer, in the prime of life, as is Captain
Drew, should be a Don Juan, is of course not a very startling
assumption, but that he should act as a low cad, laying a
wager, with a somewhat foolish companion, that he will
successfully flirt (not to use a stronger and more appropriate
verb) with the wife of his friend's friend, to whose house he
has been brought as a guest, and that this bet should be made
in an ordinary manner, as if it were Captain Drew's usual
way of proceeding, is a violation of probability that makes
Captain Drew appear more immoral than the double-dyed
melodramatic villain already mentioned. He is far worse
than was the gay Captain Crosstree, R.N., when tipsily
bent on the seduction of Black-eyed Susan. That such
a man as this Captain Drew should be suddenly conscience-
struck by his own blackguardly conduct is well-nigh
miraculous; and that his intended victim, on his confessing
himself frankly to her, apparently, incapable of under-
standing how she has been made a fool of, should not
only immediately forgive the insult, but should also
proceed at once to own her passionate undying love for so
heartless a person, exceeds the ordinary bounds of proba-
bility. The exigencies of the stage, it will be said, demand
the immediateness and the spontaneity of the act. True; but
this is where the art of the dramatist comes in, and where,
in this case, it is wanting. It is the original sin of the
piece itself, which was evidently written for the sake of this
one great situation, arrive at it how we will, and get out of
it how we can.
As for the Fourth Act, the serious part of it is de trap:
husband, wife, and jilted Don Juan, all contemptible. It
only wanted the two boys, the Masters Moron, to be brought
home from school; they might have come in between father
and mother, and so have completed the absurdity. Mr.
, of the Crummies Company, would have done it.
However, the piece had to be finished somehow, and the
author has not chosen the best way.
So much for the serious interest of the piece culminating
in the Third Act; now how about the light comedy? It
is most amusing. Leaving out of the question Sir CHARLES
WYNDHAM'S occasional share in it, all will readily admit that
Miss MARY MOORE, as Miss Mills, gives sparkling life to
the play. She is fortunate in having Mr. A. VAXE-
TEMrEsr as the embodiment of her quiet, nervous, sensible,
and deeply devoted lover Mr. White. His is a very difficult
character to portray; it is important, it is essential; as
without him, with what " CHARLES his friend " could Captain
Drew make his bet? and to whom could Miss Mills say so
many of her good things, the "plums" that the author has
lavished on this part V Rarely, except in Mrs. Gorringe's
Necklace and in The Tyranny of Tears, has Miss MARY MOORE
had a role of which she has been able to make so much as
she does with this of Miss Mills. Her sense of humour,
legitimately developing the author's, comes in strong relief to
the serious interest of the piece, and serves, as such artistic
relief always should, to intensify what it relieves. Miss MARY
MOORE makes the part natural; it might so easily have become
exaggerated. She preserves le, juste milieu, and it is to '/ •.-••
Mills, as thus played, that the last Act owes its success.
Had we simply been informed by her that Captain Drew
had departed and that the Moxons had made it up, every-
body in front would have been quite satisfied to take her
word for it.
It is a pity that American engagements necessitate the
conclusion of the run of this piece before Christmas, as other-
wise, played as it is now, Captain Drew's "Leave" might
have been prolonged in London for many months.
NEW ZEALAND ZIGZAGS.
MR. PUNCH hears from his Own Special Sparrow—
1. That the only Clubs that would be absolutely certain to
vanquish the "Silverleaves" are those which are not going
to meet them.
2. That the Maorilanders consider the Scotch the most
lavishly generous race under the sun; and are under the
impression that " Take the lot, nevermind us," is the national
motto of the Across-Tweeders.
3. That when, before a recent match, the Captain of the
home team, to excuse the defeat which he foresaw to be
inevitable, decided to get his men laid out at intervals, there
was keen competition for the first turn.
4. That in consequence of fervent appeals to English
teams to play more with their heads, SCOULAR, the Cam-
bridge back, did splendid execution against the All Blacks
with his face.
MORE "ENTENTE CORDIALE."—In the prospectus of the new
"Villegiature Forestiere-Maritime Internationale," of which
the name is "Le Chateau d'Hardelot," with its extensive
grounds within easy reach of Boulogne-sur-mer, there occur
on the English Committee list two names that are guarantees
of ultimate success. One is Sir CHARLES WYXPHAM, and the
other "'TonY,' of Punch." That Mr. Pnncli should be thus
represented trausmarinely (TouY crosses in his own bark) is
good, but how gratifying from an entente-cordiale point of
view is the fact that one of the "Notaires" professionally
attachad to this Anglo-French Society should be "Maitre
MADELLE DE POXCHEVILLB." Only the name of some distin-
guished Irishman from Punchcstoim, Ireland, is required to
complete the Punch pre-eminence.

TO A FUR-LINED COAT.
COME from the coy retreat where Thou hast slumbered
In calm oblivion to the rounding Year;
Come, for the moments of his life are numbered,
0 grave and gracious, dignified (and dear);
The days draw close, the time of frost begins;
Come, I have need of Thee, sore need, my Coat of Skins.
How have I mourned the dawn of other winters!
(A chilly thing am I, and frail to boot);
The rude North knocked my cockles into splinters;
The sharp East swept my heart-strings like a bite:
How bilious was mine aspect in the glass!
How pink mine eyes, my nose how violet, alas!
And ever I grew hoarse, and ever more hoarse;
And 'Sternutation tore me with its throes;
Men leapt to hear me cough; the musing war-horse
Has cried Ha! Ha! when I have blown my nose;
And my teeth chattered, and my windy bones
Audibly rattled, like a cab on cobble-stones.
And ah, 'twas bitter, when " for all my feathers"
1 "was a-cold," at every turn to meet
Men robed in skins, supreme against all weathers,
Proud men, who walked as tho' they owned the street;
And ever to the gods I made my prayer,
"Oh, for a Coat of Skins !"—and much they seemed to care.
And then—ah then, me thinks not even Jove knows
Such joy as that which thrilled my shivering form
When, starting with a full purse and a mauve nose,
I made Thee mine, and came home broke, but warm.
(And how I paid, and what, a 'musquash' is,
I count as two of heaven's profoundest mysteries).
Thenceforward, let the winds be ne'er so numbing,
I cared not, finding Thee a sure defence.
Thou wert so soft, so warm, and so becoming,
I could not choose but do Thee reverence;
Nay, I grew conscious of a mellow spice
Of hauteur, which itself was cheap at any price.
For Thou, despite mine inches, didst invest me
With a new loftiness, of such brave sort,
That many an awe-struck cadger has addressed me
As " Colonel." Ha! So ample was my port
That there was one sought alms—I heard him cry,
"My lord!" "My lord !" he said; and mighty pleased was I.
A fat, full, time! Too soon the "blithe new-comer,"
That silly cuckoo, robbed Thee of Thy use.
Ah, Sweet, I could not stand Thee in the summer!
I wore Thee while I had the least excuse.
Think not, I laid Thes by of changing taste:
Twas that Thou wert so dear—too dear to be replaced.
Now may we meet afresh. This morn my lynx eye
Discerns a relish of the poignant North;
The passing nose looms redly. Come! MethinksJE
May, with a decent pretext, bear Thee forth!
Come, let us take the air for some few rods: —
Gods! Gods! He moults! He moults! He has a moth!
Gods! Gods! Duii-DuM.

[Vide recent letters in The Daily A/oii.]
None seem to know who's the party in possession,

UNHONOURED HEROES.
(Tire STORY OF AN INVASION THAT FAILED.)
I ADMIT at once that they were unspeakably insignificant,
these heroes of mine. I will not, say that the body politic for
whose protection they gave their lives so unselfishly was
unaware of their existence, but it certainly would not have
recognised one of them by sight.
There, or so at least it seems to me as I sit down now to
write of these things, lies the real pathos of the tale 1 have
to tell.
For the State persistently neglected its humble defenders,
in spite of all warnings. . Again and again had experts
declared that its safety depended on maintaining them in a
reasonable condition of efficiency but, wrapped in a fatuous
sense of security, it paid no heed to such admonitions.
It was taken for granted that an invasion was a contingency
so highly improbable as to be unworthy of serious considera-
tion. And so it happened that the one force which could be
relied upon to repel a hostile invasion was allowed—whether
deliberately or not— to fall below their normal strength, and
was denied the means of attaining that mobility that was so
essential should their services ever be put to the test.
This might have been of less consequence, had external
precautions been consistently adopted—but they were not,
And the inevitable result followed. The blow fell without the
slightest warning.
Speaking for myself, I shall never forget the incredulous
surprise and dismay I felt on hearing that the dreaded German
foe had succeeded in surprising an unprotected portion of my
beloved country, and in numbers that were hourly increasing
threatened to strike inward and attack the seat of govern-
ment itself!
Personally I was helpless. As a non-combatant, I could
only wait passively and hope against hope that this supreme
crisis would be muddled through in the customary manner.
But there were others, more active, wlio, undeterred by the
neglect and indifference which they had borne so long and so
uncomplainingly, came forward gallantly to the defence of
their native isle.
They were not much to look at; they were but ill-equipped
to encounter an enemy both vigorous and formidable; pallid
they were, one and all—but not with fear, and animated with
but one impulse—to fling themselves at the presumptuous
invader at the earliest possible moment, rid their land of his
presence, or perish in the attempt.
In some pathetically inarticulate fashion they felt, without
reasoning on the subject, that Duty demanded this sacrifice of
them—and nobly was their duty performed.
It is not for me, as a mere civilian, to give a detailed
account of the prolonged struggle that ensued. I was
present, it is true, from beginning to end of the campaign,
but I confess that I had but a vague and confused impression
of what actually occurred.
So I must content myself with stating that tho conflicts,
both in their fierceness and in the varying fortune of either
side, were nothing short of Homeric. Many a daring deed,
many an act of reckless courage must have distinguished
the heroic force which could make such a stubborn and
splendid defence, but of these I am unable to furnish
any particular instances—and there were no war-corre-
spondents there to immortalise them. My heroes fought and
perished obscure and unregarded, as they lived.
But after days and weeks of hard fighting, during which
more than once it seemed that further resistance was impossible,
the attack began to show signs of weakening. Then the heroic
defenders, outnumbered, shattered, and exhausted as they
were, rallied for a final effort. So irresistible was the elan
with which they advanced that the enemy first wavered, then
broke, and fled precipitately. The pursuit was one long

career of carnage, so complete and so merciless that not a
solitary invader remained to regret his rashness!
Thus was freedom restored to the land, from which all
traces of disturbance soon disappeared, and were you now
to go over the battlefield I question if you would find
a single spot on its smooth surface to indicate that it had ever
been the scene of so many desperate encounters.
And they who won this magnificent victory—what of
them? It. woidd be only natural to expect that those who
survived would be welcomed home in triumph to be feted,
laurelled, be-medalled, and pensioned by the State they had
served so well. And that those who fell would at least be
honoured by some worthy memorial.
With shame I confess—for I feel some personal responsi-
bility in this matter—that, so far, none of these gallant
victors has received the slightest recognition.
Still, it may not be too late, even yet, to repair this omission.
With all their shortcomings, my countrymen have never been
backward in appreciating and rewarding the brave, however
humble, and I cannot believe that they will make an excep-
tion in this case, if only it is adequately placed before them,
as I have endeavoured to do in this appeal.
I venture to make the following suggestion: That a public
monument be erected by national subscription—I do not say
in the Abbey or St. Paul's, which would, perhaps, be going
rather too far—but in some conspicuous position in the
Metropolis—say Aldwych.
It might bear some such inscription as the following,
which, however, is merely a rough draft, and could be altered
or amended if necessary :—

ADDING INSULT TO INJURY.
Wretched Boy. "'ERE! AIN'T YOU DOT A HOOP OF YOOE OWN TO PLAY WITH?'
THE QUEEN'S GIFT.
(A Voice from Poplar.)
GOD bless HER MAJESTY'S heart, say I: she's done it proper
and fine,
I know she '11 pardon the words I use, for scholarship's not
my line;
But I can't keep still since I read the news, and here's what
I 've got to say:—
God bless HER MAJESTY'S woman's heart for what she has done
to-day.
It isn't a couple of thousand pounds that helps you to
kingdom come,
Though I know a couple of thousand pounds is a nice little
tidy sum;
But it isn't the gold that unbolts the bars or throws the
gates apart,
It's giving the gold, as the QUEEN she's done, with a merciful
tender heart.
For where she sits on her golden throne a-wearing her golden
crown
She has heard the voice of the weary folk, the folk that are
always down;
The far-off sorrowful voice of men, the pitiful voice of wives,
And the dreadful silence of children, too, those poor little
wasted lives.
She has heard it all, and her heart was torn; but what was
a QUEEN to do?
There 's danger in this, so the wise ones say; there 's risk in
the other too,
For if there is one thing plain, they say, as plain as the
sound of thunder,
It's this, that the folks who can't stay top must all in the
end go under.
But the QUEEN she doesn't pay heed to that, she thinks for a
little while,
And then she ups and she calls an Earl, and her face
breaks out in a smile:
And she tells him to count two thoiisand pounds, and she
says to the Earl, says she,
"There's folks that are dying for want of food, and that's
what's the matter with me."
And she wants her people to help, she says; it isn't so hard
a trick
To give when a QUEEN has showed you how, and do it as
quick as quick;
To give for the poor who have tried and failed, though they
never were ones to shirk;
To find them the work that '11 find them food and the food
that '11 help them work.
So here's to the QUEEN again, I say, the QUEEN with her lovely
face;
The QUEEN with her heart on fire for us, who stepped from
her lofty place,
And came and spoke to us straight and true in words we
could understand,
And gave us the best a QUEEN could give, a pitying woman's
hand.

WAS MR. GLADSTONE A
VOCALIST?
[This interesting question is exdting so much
attention tliat we nre glud to be able to print
some valuable letters on the subject.]
SIR,—Mr. GLAIKTONE was not a singer
in the way that the lute Signor TAMAGNO
might be called one, or even CARUSO;
but he certainly had the power of emitting
sounds from his larynx which more or
less approximated to musical notes, and
in so far as he could do this the title of
singer must not, I think, be denied to
him. Many of us cannot do even that.
My late revered chief invariably sang in
his bath. (Well for MARAT had he done
the same, for he might then have
frightened CHARI/JITE CORDAY from her
fell purpose !) But the public occasions
on which he burst into vocal exuberance
are few. I find that at a Harvest Home
at Hawarden in 1867, he gave as a solo,
''John Barleycorn," with almost too
much success, for the company had to
be got away in wheel-barrows; while as
late as 1884 his rendering of "Che
Faro" from GLUCK'H Orfeo, at a village
concert in the same place, was the event
of the evening, and is still remembered
with tears. These are the only instances
which a hurried glance through the
GLADSTONE papers has revealed.
I am, etc., JOHN MORLEY.
SIR,- I cannot say anything as to Mr.
GLADSTONE'S gifts as a singer, but I know
| that he once whistled, and whistled very
well. He had been for a walk in the
park at Hawarden with his Pomeranian
dog Petz, and the little fellow, as is the
manner of his kind, wandered off and
for a few minutes was lost to sight. Mr.
GLADSTONE, on noticing this, stood still
, and whistled, in long, clear, bell-like
notes, until Petz reappeared. I was
making a water-colour sketch at the
time, behind a tree, and was an unseer.
observer of this interesting passage hi
the life of a great man. It seemed to
me so touching to think of the mighty
statesman whistling for his little four-
footed dumb friend. I am, yours, etc.,
LYDIA BURBLE.
SIR,--I remember once when Mr.
GLADSTONE and I were walking in the
Alps in the early sixties we came to a
little roadside inn for lunch, the pro-
vision of which was exceedingly meagre.
It struck us that, at any rate, we should
be able to get some honey with which to
eke it out, but the waiter, a foolish moon-
faced fellow, persistently failed to under-
stand my word for that commodity which
we pronounced at him. Having tried
all languages, living and dead, Mr.
GLADSTONE imitated the buzzing of a
bee, and I remember how struck I was
by the accuracy of the mimicry and its
resonant tone. Even this failed to

awaken the dolt's dormant perception
until the great statesman added to his
buzzing a sharp jab with a fork in the
fleshier portion of the man's leg, which
so realistically brought to his mind the
idea of a sting that he hastened to
inform us that there was no honey in the
house. Beyond this instance I can say
nothing definite as to Mr. GLADSTONE'S
vocal powers. I am, &c.,
AVEBURY.
SIR,—That Mr. GLADSTONE occasionally
sang is beyond doubt, but as to the
quality of his singing—that is another
story. I find in my diary the following
entry under February 29, 1881:—
"The Breakfast Club met at HART-
DYKE'S. Eight present, including
GLADSTONE. The conversation turned
early upon old London cries, and
GLADSTONE imitated the St. James's milk-
maid's call,' Milk 0 !' with much humour
and rraisemblance, so much so that
HART-DYKE'S cat was heard miaowing at
the door immediately after. POLLOCK
said something about Orpheus attracting
the beasts with his melody, which started
GLADSTONE upon an excursion into Greek
myth, which did not stop till it was
time for lunch."
Trusting this little reminiscence may
be useful to you, I am, &c.,
M. E. GRANT-DUFF.
SIR,—In the intervals of amassing a
modest competence I have always found
music my chief solace and recreation,
and pride myself on the possession of a
remarkably correct ear. On the occasion
of the opening of a free library at Bootle
by Mr. GLADSTONE, the proceedings opened
with a performance of "God Save the
Queen." Though a staunch Republican
I was so carried away by the fervour with
which Mr. GLADSTONE led the National
Anthem that I joined in unconsciously,
but at the close found that I was exactly
a minor third above the great Liberal
Statesman. But whether he descended
or I ascended from the true pitch is a
point with which at this interval of time
I cannot charge my memory.
I am, etc.,
AKDREW CARNEGIE.
SIR,—In my frequent conversations
with Mr. GLADSTONE the talk, curiously
enough, never fell on music, but I may,
perhaps, be allowed to supplement this
omission with an anecdote of a cousin of
mine, LANCELOT WILBKAHAM, a favourite
pupil of JOWETT'S in the sixties.
WILBRAHAM, who was a man of blameless
character, and the only member of the
Bullingdon Club who ever gained the
Hall and Houghton Septuagint Prize,
was deeply addicted to music and quite
a remarkable performer on the concertina.
Hence JOWETT'S sweeping dictum, "All
musicians are immoral except WILBRA-
"" It is only fair to add that JOWETT
knew little or nothing of music, anc
when once reference was made to
WAGNER'S Flying Dutchman naively
observed, "I thought WAGNER was a
musician, not an owner of racehorses."
I am, &c.,
LIONEL TOII.EMACHE.
DOMESTIC LIFE.
"DOMESTIC life," the croaker thinks,
And shakes a pessimistic head,
"Domestic life with all its links
Of love and tenderness is dead."
Ah, could you spend a Sunday, Sir,
Wheeling my twin perambulator,
You possibly might wish it were,
0 acli temporis laudator.
My brothers, fetterless and free,
Fly off on pleasure only bent;
Some golf beside the "Silver Sea,"
Some motor through the Weald of Kent,
Whilst I—I know no Sunday lark
But trundling forth my son and
daughter
1 To feed the ducks in Regent's Park,
And sail toy boats upon the water.
I craved love once—but when a chap
Is nightly roused from pleasing dreams
To sterilise ALPHONSO'S pap
Or soothe CECILIA'S frenzied screams;
When he is harnessed like a colt
To cradle or to baby carriage,
What wonder should his soul revolt
From these enthralling bonds of mar-
riage?
What wonder, as he puffs the clay
Of poverty beneath the stars,
If he regret the halcyon day
Of one-and-sixpenny cigars?
What wonder that he looks behind
To hours when careless youth went
on so
And loved a bottle—not the kind
Affected by the brat ALPHONSO.
What wonder lie should sometimes sigh
For nights that all too swiftly flew,
When throats were wet and humour dry
Amid the mad Bohemian crew;
When song dispelled the doleful dumps,
When wits were wide awake as weasels,
When he had never heard of mumps
And did not know the name of measles.
NEW LIGHTS ON HELLAS.
[In view of the great and natural interest
excited by the visit of the King of the HELLENES
to our shores, the following remarkable article,
supplementary to one which recently appeared
in TheErening Standard and St. Jamex'n Gazette,
written by a distinguished Soho publicist, and
secured at enormous cost for exclusive issue in
his columns by Mr. Punch, will doubtless be
perused with breathless interest.]
THE day of the modern Athenians
begins at an early hour in the morning,
though not at the same time as in London,
owing to difference in the latitude and
longitude, to say nothing of the meridian.
Still, many persons are out of bed by
eight o'clock and hurry off, after a light
repast of coffee and rolls, to their various
vocations. Coffee was unknown in the
time of PERICLES and SOCRATES—who, as
is well known, drank hemlock—and was
not introduced until a comparatively
recent date. After this meal the women
of the household fill up the rest of the
forenoon with needlework and other
occupations, such as lialma, podokeien,
diseon, akonta, and palen, the Greek
counterpart of jiujitsu. The Greeks, it
may be added, are intensely musical, and
Athens is one of the few places where

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
In the hot weather very few people
are seen out of doors between twelve
and four o'clock, and the habit of the
siesta is well-nigh universal. Any time
after four o'clock, afternoon tea is the
beverage, being served hot in cups, with
or without sugar, according to the taste
of the individual. Even in the colder
months, the usual dinner-hour is a
trifle late according to English ideas,
and in the. dog-days the hour grows
later until it extends to half-past nine
or ten o'clock. Indeed cases are on
record of frugal families in times of
distress dining on the following day
for several days in succession. -
Some Athenians when the weather is
hot take their meals in the open air,
either on a terrace, or in a verandah, or
at a restaurant. The meat most gene-
rally consumed is either lamb or goat,
for owing to the rocky character of the
country, prime beef is difficult to pro-
cure, except in the district of Oxyrrhyn-
clius, where the papyrus affords splendid
pasturage.
Greek women are as a rule good lin-
guists, for, unlike the practice in our
girls' schools, Greek is compulsory,
with the result that when Greek meets
Greek there is never any difficulty about
their understanding each other. The
beauty of the Athens women is prover-
bial, as readers of BYRON'S famous lyric
Zoetrope, sas agapo will remember, but
the absence of Roman noses is remark-
able, though on reflection it.will be
admitted that this could not very well
be otherwise.
CHARIVARIA.
A REMARKABLE phenomenon is reported
from Christchurch, New Zealand. The
localmutton, for some unknown reason,has
been giving forth a phosphorescent glow,
and, according to one account, it is no
uncommon sight to see economical house-
holders reading by the light of their meat.
Tlie Dally Mail is publishing a series
of carefully compiled estimates of the
results of the coming General Election,
and it is thought that Sir HENRYCAMPBELL-
BANNERMAN and Mr. BALFOUR may come
to an arrangement by which their
respective parties should be bound by
The Daily Mail's results. When one
considers the enormous trouble and
expense that would thereby be saved we
cannot but applaud this sensible scheme.
Now that it has been proved that
GEORGE THE FOURTH and Mrs. FITZHERBERT
were legally married, America, with
characteristic enterprise, is producing a
number of grandchildren, and it is not
impossible that the interesting couple
may be proved to have had upwards of
one hundred little ones.
When our cruiser squadron visited
New York, the people went to such
lengths to obtain souvenirs of Prince
Louis OF BATTENBERG that, according to
our information, the PRINCE was obliged
to attach several labels to his uniform
bearing the words, "Not to be taken."
It is rumoured, by the way, that we
shall shortly hear that a fair American
curio-hunter has secured a British Duke.
The municipality of Frankfort-on-
the-Main has opened a refuge for the
accommodation of widowers with chil-
dren. A correspondent writes to com-
plain that nothing is being done for
husbands whose wives are still alive.

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.
Mr. Bird. " I was with them when they started
the Society for the Protection of Wild Birds,
but now they 're forming one for the protection
of wild worms—it's a bit too sympathetic."
So many accidents have occurred
lately through the ignition of petrol
that a wealthy motorist, we hear, is
making arrangements for his car to be
followed, wherever it may go, by a
fully-equipped fire-engine, and, if this
example be followed widely, our roads
will become more interesting than ever.
The Mayor of HUDPERSFIELD is loyally
carrying out his promise to present
twenty shillings to the parent of every
child (in the Longwood District) that
readies the age of one year. Meanwhile
we hear that last week a local infant,
in revenge for an undeserved spanking,
threw its parents into a state of panic
when it had attained 11 months and 29
days, by obstinately holding its breath
for upwards of ten minutes.
The Winter Club at Olympia, to en-
able all kinds of sports to be carried on
under cover, strikes us as a distinctly
happy idea. At the same time the scope
of the scheme has been exaggerated.
For instance, it is not, we are told, a fact
that a portion of the ground, three acres
in extent, has been set aside for marbles.
It is now stated that the manuscript
of the Venerable BEDE'S Super (Jaitfica
Canticonim, which has been returned,
was merely borrowed by some burglars
to read, and, if this be true, we have
here a happy sign of the influence of
Tlic Times Book Club on the culture
of the masses.
The recent New York elections prove
our American cousins to be far more
advanced than ourselves. "One man
two votes" seems to be the rule rather
than the exception.
The deatli is announced of the richest
cat-fish in the world. It was caught off
Spalato, and its personal property in-
cluded a chain-purse filled with silver
and nickel coin to the value of £3, and
£7 in bank-notes.

burg as a pleasure resort is not what

FROM AN EDITOR'S POST-BAG.
DF.AR MR. PUNCH,—It is my misfortune
to edit a monthly Magazine. There are
people, I find, who imagine the post to
be a pleasant one. Here are a few
extracts from my letters this morning,
which may help to undeceive them :—
"DEAR MR. EDITOR,—You won't mind
my addressing you in this familiar way
I am sure because although I don't
think we have ever met and often as I
find one does not meet at least
only very exceptionally the
people who are really most
likely to be close friends if
only there was an opportunity
of comparing notes and so
becoming intimate but I feel
drawn towards you since I
know that once you stayed in
the hotel at Shingleford where

Aunt ELIZA was taken sud-
denly ill through a chill—as I
said and shall say though the
doctor seemed very puzzled
about it .... (Three closcly-
imtten pages omitted) ....

a cheque will give me great
pleasure."
"Sm,—Have you ever read
the first verse of the first
chapter of Genesis? And if
so, how do you justify your
recent article on bi-metallism?
Sporadic entospores in a semi-
evolutionary environment en-
tirely atrophy all negligible
statistics. I have developed
this idea in a paper of 8,645
words, sent to-day."
"DEAR SIR,—On a former
occasion, when rejecting an
article of mine, you told me
to study the character of the
Magazine, in order to see what
subjects were likely to prove
acceptable. This I have done.
In your July number I find a
paper on 'Some Churches in
Florence.' Knowing,therefore,
that this is what you like, I
enclose a paper on 'Some
Florentine Churches.'"

it is much too technical for your pages.

for its publication elsewhere. At the
same time, if you could publish it, all
the proceeds would be devoted to the
purpose of installing a new heating-
apparatus in our schools, where one is
greatly needed. Possibly this may in-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAKI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Sydney Escott, the heroine in Miss EDITH FOWLER'S last
novel. For Richer, for Poorer (HURST AND BLACKETT), is a
provoking young person. It was with unlelt premonition
of the appropriate that, being a girl, her parents gave her
a boy's name. Throughout her life she, like the Mary Mary
of an old song, is "quite contrary." My Baronite confesses
he was a little alarmed for the success of the story when he
readied the chapter where Sydney, accompanied by her
derelict mother in search of seaside lodgings, stormed the
Vicarage and insisted upon being taken in, since there were
no other apartments vacant. The Vicar, apparently the lust
Inan in the world to submit to such intrusion, weakly yields.
The mother is installed in the sick room, and tiy/liicy domi-
nates the premises. When we know her better, as of course
Miss FOWLER did from the first, we admit the possibility.
Sydney is as wild and wholesome as the sea she greatly loves,
pure and sweet as the flowers with which she decks herself.
It requires a skilled hand to manage so skittish a character
through 300 pages. Miss FOWLER succeeds, marking in her
List work a distinct advance on earlier efforts that found
wide acceptance by novel-readers.
Messrs. W. AND R. CHAMBERS, those indefatigable and
experienced caterers to the literary appetites of the young,
are providing a more than usually sumptuous Christmas
feast, or rather a choice of feasts, for their clients. For girls
there are six books, with any one of which a frill-wearer may
consider herself lucky. Mrs. L. T. MEADE lias written three:
Wilful Cousin Kate, Dumps, and A Bevy of Girls. How she
can manage to do it and to keep so high a level passes the
Assistant Reader'scomprehension. Miss MAY BALDWIN, with two
books, The Girls of St. Gabriel's and Tliat Little Limb, runs
a good second to Mrs. MEADE in the amount of her output.
In merit these sisters of the pen are not to be divided. A
mere male, RAYMOND JACBERNS, shows up with one volume,
Crab Cottage, a good one.
As to boys, they can take their pick of The Boys of Bad-
minster, by ANDREW HOME; Shoulder Arms, by G. MANVILLE
FENN; and Chums in the Far West, by EVERETT McNEiL. I
have sampled them and can recommend them.
For imps of mischief there are two new Buster Browns
and one new Foxy Grandpa. It is evident that the grand-
sons of Foxy are quite unable to cope with him. Might I
suggest that they should allow Buster to try his hand at
this irreclaimable old gentleman? It would be a good
match- even though it does seem that Buster s journey to
Europe, as described in one of the new books, has a little
dashed his spirits.
I have left to the last a most delightful book, in order
that I might give it a special word of praise. It is A Book
of Baby Birds, verses by B. PARKER, illustrated by N. PARKER.
The pictures are perfectly charming, and the verses are, in
their way, as good. Grace, dexterity, neatness and point
are the chief characteristics of both.
Presumably on a well-known principle, Mr. W. W. JACOBS
calls his latest book Captains All (HooDKR AND STOUOHTON),
because no captain figures prominently in the stories. Far
beyond his custom, Mr. JACOBS quits the sea, finding his
characters ashore. This is an advantage, since it makes the
reader acquainted with Bob Pretty, a gentleman who, to the
avocation of poacher, adds the art of the diplomatist and the
guile of the Heathen Chinee. How Bob bets his cronies at
the "Cauliflower" public-house that, following on the chance
shooting of a beater by a party from the Hall intent on
pheasants, there will be fresh disasters of the same kind, and
how he wins his bet, is a tale of adventure told with that
grim, self-restrained humour of which Mr. JACOBS is master.
Another irresistibly funny story is The Temptation of Samuel
Surge, now played on the stage of a London theatre. My
Baronite advises the possessor of the book to resist the
temptation to read it all through at a sitting. Better take a
tale a day.
Except for revealing to us the Fitzherbert papers, which
are now among the private archives of Windsor Castle, and
for certain ducal and other letters, here first published
by His present MAJESTY'S gracious permission, the two
entertaining volumes entitled Mrs. Fitzherbert and George 1\'.,
by W. H. WILKIN-S, M.A., F.S.A. (LONGMANS & Co.), do not
add much to the English public's general knowledge of the
really commonplace story of " The First Gentleman in Europe"
and his illegal, but canonical, wife, MARIA FITZHELUIERT, origi-
nally Miss SMYTHE, who at twenty-five years of age found her-
self a widow, for the second time, with a couple of thousand
a year. She became a society beauty and captured the too
susceptible GEORGE, Prince of WALES, by whom she was in
turn taken prisoner and secured in the bonds of matrimony
on certain terms to which, of course, she should never have
consented. Beyond all possibility of doubt she was married
to the Prince of WALES, and it was only to conciliate his
father GEORGE THE THIRD, in order to get his debts paid, that
"The First Gentleman in Europe" lied like a trooper to Mr.
Fox, and Mr. Fox to the House of Commons, in absolutely
denying the fact of the marriage. Mr. WII.KIXS tries to
palliate the conduct of Florizel, and he is most sympathetic
towards Perdita. But, surely, it must seem to the majority
that in not listening to the voice of her own conscience, and
to the remonstrance of her correct (but afterwards weakly
compliant) uncle, Mrs. FITZHERBERT brought upon herself all her
subsequent troubles, and, in plain language, simply deserved
what she got. The illustrations from photographs arc gcxxl,
and the history of the period, although diffuse, is interesting.
For some time there have appeared weekly in The West-
minuter Gazette what purport to be the remarks of The
Office Boy on current political events, illustrated by pen-and-
ink sketches of the style familiar on school slates. The
authorship is now admitted by Mr. FRANCIS BROWN, who
reprints his contributions under the title The. Doimjs of
Arthur (METHUEN). The incongruity of the literary style of The
Office Boy and the high politics he discusses is amusing, and
is greatly helped by the burlesque type of drawings supplied.
In this last respect my Baronite observes that Mr. BROWN is
obviously a student of F. C. G.'s more elaborate political
squibs.
"First come, first served," says the Baron, opening the door
to Father TUCK, who comes with a Christmas waggon full of
cartes, and presenting an evergreen Annual for all genuine
child-like children who have not yet been crowded out of exist-
ence by little swollen-headed, spectacled men and women of
about five or six years of age. So Father TUCK'S Toy Books,
his Annual, his Louis WAIN'S
Cats, and his pretty series of
picture postcards by HELEN
JACKSON, the Baron singles out
for special approval. Then fol-
lows a delightful DENDY SADLER
series of " Old English Toasts,"
and " On the Links Calendar"
for Golfers. From his postcards
the Baron selects the "Glisten-
ing Dew Series" and "The
Pyramids of Egypt." May this
brief notice create an appetising
taste of the TUCK stores!

YERKES'S JERKERS.
[American humour is enjoying a much-needed revival through the
medium of Mr. YEUKES, U.S.A. The foreign-built electric cars which
he has placed on the District Raihray (not to l>e confused with the
workmanlike cars of the Metropolitan, English-built and under English
control) are making laughk-r for all Londoners who can appreciate a
practical joke made at their own expense. Still, as Mr. YF.RKES has
other schemes in han 1 for the development of the Metropolis, it would
be as well if the projected Traffic Hoard were to see that he does not
carry his pleasantries too far.]
I STOOD at Putney on the platform's marge,
A first-class ticket in my hand,
And from my lips protruded, mild but large,
A fabric of the Fatherland;
And I was bound
For Charing Cross upon the District Underground.
A crash like skittle-balls on sheeted lead !—
I scanned the labels one by one;
"Where is the First-class smoking-car?" I said,
And the Guard answered, "There is none!"
And I was vexed,
And let the train proceed and waited for the next.
Contemporaneous with my fourth cigar
It came—0 long desired in vain !—
And in the midst a First-class smoking-car
(So it alleged upon the pane);
And entering there
I sat on straw as sits an ox within his lair.
To left, a balmy fishwife, bosomed deep,
Palpably overlapped my space;
To right, my flank was elbowed by a sweep
That masked in soot his natural face;
And I inferred
That they had pardonably deemed the class was Third.
And when the wobbling waggons pulled up short
(YERKES° his jerkers, alien build !),
My dexter neighbour, lurching hard a-port,
Over my spotless cuff was spiHed,
While I was thrust
Sinisterwise athwart the lady's ample bust.
Rising at Walham (I could bear no more)
I underwent an instant jerk
And fell, and rose, and faced the sliding door,
And waited for the tiling to work;
But lie, the Guard,
Was occupied in sending signals to his pard.
So on to Brompton bumpily we bore,
Where I forestalled the instant jerk,
And clutched a strap, and smote upon the door,
And waited for the thing to work;
But in his groove
The patent apparatus stuck and would not move.
So on to Earl's Court. Here, against the laws,
Forth by an ingress-gate I went,
And in my passion, which allowed no pause,
Debouched upon, and nearly sent
Out of his mind,
A Bishop who would enter. He was left behind.
I fled. I had a whirling in my brains
Like to a landsman off the seas;
I asked a porter—" Have you any trains
Of the old pattern, not like these?"
And he replied,
"All but the Willesden lot are now electrified."
0 Two syllables. Should not be rhymed with PEEKS.
"How long before a Willesden comes this way?"
"In twenty minutes' time," said he.
I said, "I thank you. Though I had to stay
Two solid hours or even three,
T. 'd wait for that;"
And proffered sixpence, which he took and touched his hat.

THE "SUDS" TRIPOS.
A LAUNDRY business has recently been started by three or
four Varsity men on refined and apparently educational lines,
and on November ii-nd the promoters gave their Inaugural
Washing Tea and Exhibition of Lingerie at the Grafton
Galleries. A new career is thus opened up for younger sons.
The authorities at Cambridge, anxious, as ever, to keep
abreast of popular demands, have accordingly taken steps to
institute Proceedings in Mangling and Laundry-work, similar
to the existing Mechanical Science Tripos.
The examination will be almost entirely practical, and
will involve little or no paper and celluloid work. The names
of successful candidates for Honours will appear in the
Washing List at the end of the May Term each year, arranged
as usual in three classes, to be known respectively as Man-
glers, Senior Props, and Junior Props, the Wooden Spoon
being replaced by a Clothes Peg. Women students, of course,
will be admitted to the examination. The degree of L.L.M.
shall be held to signify Licensed Laundry Man, or Maid, as
the case may be.
The subjects of examination will embrace : —
"Rags," and how to deal with them. •
The Strength of Materials, including Tearing and Breaking
Strains.
The Theory of Structures, with the Differentiation of
Pants and Pyjamas.
Character-reading from Ink-stains and Darns.
Friction as applied to the Frayed Shirt-front and Cuff.
Torsion of Collars and Chemisettes, with Wringing Out
in general.
Hydraulics: "Running through Water," "Putting to
Soak," and " Damping Down."
The Common Iron, Box-iron and Smoothing-iron, used (i.)as
Beetle-crushing Implement, (ii.) for the production of Creases
and "Crow's feet," (iii.) as Missile.
Gauffering and Frills: to suit the requirements of (a)
Countesses, (b) Debutantes, (c) Gaiety Actresses.
Starch in all its aspects—Academic, Puritanical and
Aristocratic.
Blue: the Light, the Dark, the Running, and the Aquatic
varieties.
The Dynamics of Pegs, Lines, and Props in connection
with the Back-garden.
Soap, visible and invisible.
The Art and Practice of Marking, Unmarking, Mislaying
and Substitution.
Clients, Management of; also Pressure, by the County Court
Pnx'ess.
1 .lectures will be given by the Lowndrian Professor of
Balneology on the above subjects at the Trinity Fountain,
and by the Chinese Demonstrator on the Backs, where also
the Examination will be held. Students are recommended
to make occasional use of the K. P. and St. Andrew's Street
Canals, but not to wash too much of their dirty linen in
public, as on the occasion of the recent riots. They should
also "get up" waistcoats, washing-ties, and other contro-
versial items in private. Text-books on the subjects will be
issued, duly glazed and calendered, from the Pitt Press.
Further particulars regarding the forthcoming Tripos may
be obtained from the University Wash-houses Syndicate.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LIGHTS OF SPENCER PRIMMETT'S EYES.
SPENCER PRTMMETT was a most worthy and estimable young
man. He had a good position for his years in one of the
Government Departments, as well as a comfortable private
income, and his chief ambition was to avoid any conduct
which might render him conspicuous. In this object lie liad
so far succeeded admirably. There was nothing whatever
remarkable about his countenance, which was mild and rather
round, or his demeanour, which was quite unassuming, or his
opinions, which were those of all well-regulated persons.
So that mothers and chaperons generally regarded him with
favour as a highly eligible parti—a fact of which lie was
complacently aware. He had, indeed, but one defect, and
that of so gradual a growth that it was some time before lie
perceived it himself—he was extremely near-sighted. It
struck him more and more forcibly that the English climate
was growing mistier, and he was surprised that none of his
friends was observant enough to notice so obvious an atmos-
pherical change.
But there came an afternoon when, in paying a call on the
BELLINGHAMS in Cornwall Gardens, he discovered with some
confusion that he had been vainly trying to induce a footstool
to sit up and beg for a biscuit—which convinced him that his
eyesight must be slightly impaired, and that he must really
protect himself from making any further mistakes by getting
an eyeglass.
He had another and a stronger motive for doing so. HILDA
and RHODA BELLINOIUM were both extremely attractive girls,
and lie had lately begun to conceive it possible that he might
fall in love with one of them. But which '?—he could not be
sure that he had ever seen either at all distinctly. It seemed
advisable to make himself better acquainted with the actual
features of each before committing himself to any definite
advances to either. It would be a pity to find out when it
was too late that he had chosen tbe plainer of the two.
He tried several opticians, but none of them had an eyeglass
or even a pince-nez that suited -his sight. Then he did what
he ought to have done before—he consulted a leading oculist.
After a prolonged examination the oculist informed him that
he was "abnormally astigmatic," which seems a harsh thing
to say about any man.
However, he wrote him out a prescription for a pair of
glasses of differing powers, which SPENCER took to the firm to
whom he was recommended. And a few days afterwards, on
returning from Whitehall to his rooms one afternoon, he
found a neat little parcel awaiting him, containing a pair of
spectacles and the account, which came to more than he had
expected. He put them on and inspected himself, not without
anxiety, in a hand-glass. It was a great relief to him to find
that they were by no means unbecoming. His eyes looked
larger and more brilliant now they were framed and glazed;
the glasses gave him an air of higher intelligence, deeper
thoughtfulness, than he had previously discerned in his
expression.
Still, it was not vanity, but an overpowering impatience to
see what the Miss BELLINGHAMS were really like, that made
him call a hansom and drive at once to Cornwall Gardens.
As he fared westward, facing the sunset sky, he was delight-
fully conscious of his improved powers of vision; he could
now see the most distant objects, defined with a sharpness
that was a positive revelation to him. He remarked things
that would previously have escaped him—for instance, the
incompetency of London cabmen—for the drivers of quite a
number of hansoms he met seemed to have the greatest
difficulty in controlling their horses. Fortunately his own
cabman was an exception to the general rule, and brought
him to Cornwall Gardens without mishap.
SPENCER found that both Mrs. BELLINGHAM and her daughters
were at home, and he entered the drawing-room with
suppressed excitement—he was about to know now whether
it was Hiu)A or RHODA who was to prove his real enchantress.
They welcomed him cordially enough, and he took a seat near
the fire, while he gazed with an intentness he hoped was not
too apparent at the two graceful girls who sat opposite him in
the lamplight. He could see their features perfectly at last,
and was delighted to find that they surpassed all his previous
conceptions. Even then he found it as difficult as ever to
decide which was the more irresistibly engaging, they were
both so adorably pretty in their different styles—but at least
he saw now that there was a difference. So he sat there
talking—rather pleasantly, he thought.^to all three ladies,
and feeling that he was making a very favourable impression.
Presently, indeed, he began to fear that he was inspiring a
deeper sentiment in both the Miss BEUJNGHAMS than he had
any right or intention to do at that stage. Without being
unduly conceited, he could not but observe that as often as
he turned to address HILDA, she regarded him with a kind of
spell-bound attention resembling fascination, whereas RHODA,
on the other hand, seemed powerless to meet his eyes at all.
These were trifles—but significant. He was beginning to
think he had better go, when the dog, which had previously
been snoring soundly in its basket, created a diversion by
coining out.
SPENCER made no mistake this time; he knew it was not a
footstool, or even a doormat, so he beamed on it with amiable
recognition, and called it by name. It gave a short howl, and
fled into the back drawing-room with every sign of abject
terror. SPENCER said he could not understand it, as he
generally got on so well with dogs. The BELLINGHAMS agreed
that it was most unaccountable—but somehow the incident
caused a certain constraint. HILDA and RHODA talked on
fluently enough, but rather at random, and their mother
showed a nervous restlessness which was unusual in one who
was so essentially a woman of the world. So he cut short his
visit, after only staying an hour, wishing heartily that the
dog had not chosen to make such a fool of itself just when
things were going so well, and wondering whether the
BELLINGHAM family was not inclined to be slightly hysterical.
SPENCER had to dine out that evening. It was at a house
in Lancaster Gate, and he arrived quite a quarter of an hour
after everybody else, so that he could hardly expect anything
but a cold reception—which he certainly got.
He was consoled, however, by the discovery that the BEL-
LINGHAMS were among the party, and that he was to have the
privilege of taking in Miss HILDA. He would have been
equally pleased had it been her sister—for they were both
looking more bewitching than ever in that brilliantly lighted
room. But something—he knew not what—had come be-
tween him and HILDA—he distinctly noticed her flinch as he
offered his arm. And at table it was only by an obvious
effort that she looked at him in speaking, and then she
promptly turned away her head with what, unless his fancy
deceived him, was almost a shudder. At the first opportunity
she entered into animated conversation with her right-hand
neighbour—after which he saw nothing of her but a left
shoulder till dessert.
He would have talked to the lady on his left—but she was
entirely engrossed by her allotted partner. So, in his isolation,
SPENCER was reduced to casting glances of pathetic appeal to
RHODA, who sat opposite. He succeeded in catching her eye,
because he saw her start and bite her lip as if to control her
feelings, but she avoided any answering sign of sympathy or
encouragement. What on earth was the matter with them?
Could they really attach any importance to the fact that their
little beast of a terrier had shown an unreasonable antipathy
to him?
He did not seem popular with anybody there, for, as his
eyes wandered idly round the table, it seemed to him that every
face' on which his gaze lighted immediately froze, as though

petrified. He had arrived rather late, it was true; but, hang
it all! he could not have spoilt their dinner so much as all
that!
It was horrible to sit there feeling like an apologetic
skeleton! After the ladies had left, Mr. BEU.I\GHAM, as his
habit was, began to monopolise the conversation, fie was a
bit of a bore, but nevertheless SPENCER, in his anxiety to j
propitiate at least one member of the family, leant forward
and listened with deferential interest. But he did not pro-
pitiate the old gentleman—he merely put him out. Mr.
BEi.LiN'ftiiAM became more and more discomposed under'
SPENOEK'S abeorljed attention, till at length his monologue
came to a lame and abrupt conclusion.
Gallantly PRIM MI:IT attempted to relieve the awkward
silence that followed by throwing out an intelligent remark
on some topic of the day. He said nothing, he was certain,
that was not perfectly safe in any company but his platitudes
burst like bombshells on his hearers; everyone appeared to
dread being drawn into conversation with him. He saw
those lie addressed blink nervously as they returned some
monosyllabic reply, while others evaded his advances by
looking in any other direction but his. He affected the nerves
of the very servants, for, as he turned towards a footman
who was offering him coffee, the man dropped the tray
with a crash. He had never felt so little at home at any
dinner-party in his whole life. When he went upstairs he
was unable to obtain an explanation with either HILDA or
RHODA before they left, which they did early. He left himself
shortly afterwards, and it struck him that his hostess was
glad 1o get rid of him.
He was conscious that he had shed a kind of blight on
her party— how or why he was at a loss to imagine. Was
some abominable rumour being circulated affecting his
character? But no, that was impossible, his conscience
assured him that he could have given no occasion for any
sort of scandal. Then why —M'/iy did the BELLTNO.HAMS and
everybody else shrink from him as if lie were some accursed
thing? Would no one ever look him in the face with frank
friendliness again? (llooinily he asked himself these ques-
tions as he stood on his hearthrug before the fire, and then
suddenly, on looking \ip, lie beheld his own reflection in the
mirror above the mantelpiece, and recoiled in positive terror.
For his eyes were no human eyes—they were two glowing
caverns flickering with lurid flames, as though his brain
were being slowly consumed! The effect was simply appal-
ling. He saw now that no man with eyes like those could
hope to inspire the object of his affections with any senti-
ment but instinctive horror! And yet how could he have
suffered this transformation into a fiend of peculiarly
repulsive aspect without being even aware of the process?
Then all at once he remembered his spectacles; they fitted
him so well that almost from the first he had forgotten
their very existence. However, he found he was still wear-
ing them. Perhaps, if he took them off—he removed them,
and on approaching the mirror closely, discovered with
inexpressible relief that the baleful glare had vanished from
his eyes. He put them on once more, and placing himself
behind a lamp at some distance from the mirror, observed
the result. One oval, bsing slightly concave, threw rays as
blinding as those of a searchlight; the other lens, which ,
was convex, blazed like one of the illuminated globes in a |
chemist's window! To himself this disquieting phenomenon
was apparent only when a strong artificial light struck his
spectacles at particular angles of refraction from the mirror—
which accounted for his failure to notice it by daylight, or
even while dressing for dinner. But it made him understand
now why the cabhorses had shied that afternoon; why the
BELLINGIIAMS' dog had fled; why, in short, all through that
fearful evening he had been unconsciously producing the effect
of a human basilisk or a Medusa head. He would do so no
more—it made him too remarkable. So in another instant
these costly glasses were lying ground to splinters under
SPENCER'S heel. . . .
Since that day he has worn no others, and is rewarded
for his sacrifice by the knowledge that he can allow his eyes
to rest now on both the Miss BELLIXGHAMS without the
slightest apprehension of reducing them to a cataleptic
condition. The only drawback is that, he is as unable as
ever to distinguish one from the other. Which is possibly
the reason why there has been no announcement, as yet, of
his engagement to either. F. A.

Of some angelic phantom of delight,
So slender, so tender inviting one to kiss,
To thrill one and fill one

Maryliertia admirable. No use mentioning details, everybody
knows them. Only they do not know—at least the majority
do not—how powerful her notes are until they have heard
her in a fog. Very badly drained site must have been the
house where Marglierita resided. Perhaps the garden which
we all know so well looked on the river. However, be that
as it may, on Tuesday the fog predominated, and Faust must
either have found Marglierita by accident, or have lost her
altogether, as the audience was certainly fogged by the
atmosphere.
And "the voices" (which simple description reminds us of
JOAN OF ARC) were eminently satisfactory. Experienced
habitues, knowing the "stage business," could listen with
pleasure and with closed eyes. Signer DIDUR as Mefisto,
some years younger than former Mefistos, in consequence of
the absence of the little billy-goat imperial on the chin hitherto
associated with this character, was excellent as well drama-
tically as musically. With Signer ZENATELLO'S Faust little
fault could be found, and the same may be said of Signor
BATTISTINI'S Valentino. Signora TRENTINI was a charming
Siebel—si belle I—and Signora ZACCAKIA was a Maria to Mcfinto,
and seemed young enough to have deceived even Mejisto's
superior officer. Signor MUGNONE and orchestra in first-rate
order. Applause immense, and, despite fog, five calls after
"the garden party." Nothing could be more polite; garden
party first, calls afterwards. Faust is announced for repeti-
tion before this brief notice appears.
Thursday, Nov. 23.—No fog!! Atmosphere clear: House
full. Late arrival this season of Don Giovanni, ably repre-
sented by Signor BATTISTIM. Signora STRAKOSCH as Donna
Anna seemed rather frightened, that is, at least, judging by
her persistent tremolo. This view of Donna Anna's character
we venture to consider incorrect. Donna Elvira was fairly
well represented, vocally, by Mme. GH.TBERT-LEJEUNE; Signorina
CLASENTI'H Zerlina will probably improve on repetition. No
doubt, after a rehearsal or two, competently directed, the
clever Signora will "reform it altogether."
A jovial party is the Don Giovanni of Signor BATTISTINI,
and on the whole, musically and dramatically, a happy imper-
sonation. Both Signor B. and Signorina C. rise to heights
never contemplated by MOZART. But even MOZART was not up
to everything. Signor DIDUR was good in the farcical nonsense
of Leporello, as was Signor WIGLEY as the idiotic Mazetto.
Where is the brilliant stage-manager who will do something
for the stupid old "business" which, has been allowed to
become traditional in these two low-comedy parts?
Signor GIORGINI as Don Ottaoio made the most of his one
great chance, "II mio tesoro," but contrary to precedent
Zerlina and Mazetto, evidently expecting a real musical treat,
remained on the stage to listen to Don Ottavio's rendering of
tliis chef ifceuvre. Both of them were evidently immensely
pleased, though perhaps for professional reasons they did
not insist upon an encore, reserving their hearty congra-
tulations until they should meet Don Ottaoio " off " at " the
wings." Three orchestras, including the Ball-room scene, all
under the baton of Maestro MUGNONE, most effective, and,
taken as a whole, the Don achieved success.
With the last night of November comes the close of the
Autumnal Opera Season. We trust it lias been sufficiently
successful (from the interior of cash-box point of view) to
warrant an encore next year. "Prosit!"

LILLIAN.
VII.—THE GREAT SERVANT QUESTION.
ONE of the maids (ELLEN, the pretty
one) had been walking out for some
weeks with McGREGOR, who is the right-
hand man of the butcher. They had
kept company in Scotland somewhere;
and when ELLEN was ordered south
McGREGOR threw up what I take to have
been a lucrative job as a, blacksmith,
practised anatomy and things for a
month on his father's flock, and came
down to us as a butcher's assistant.
Which shows the power of love and the
adaptability of the Briton that has
made our Empire what it is. (Lo«rf
cheers.)
When there's an ELLEN in the case, it is
an advantage of the butcher's profession
that you must come up to the house?
at least once a day. But HcGiiF.r.oii
yearned for other meetings. At the
bottom of our kitchen garden is a brick
wall—high on the road side and fairly-
low on ours. Every night ELLEN stood
here and leant over, Juliet-way, while
down in the dust on the other side was
Romeo McGREGOR. I suppose they liked
the romance of it, there being really
nothing to stop ELLEN from going out at
the gate.
Now, personally, I was rather keen on
the ELLEN-McGREGOR comedy. I think
McGREGOR one of the most sporting self-
made butchers I have ever known. In
any case I should have made no objec-
tions, because I think the other sort of
person has as much right to his feelings
as we have, and I know that if I was
going to meet LILLIAN somewhere I should
be extremely annoyed to find that the
coachman made a fuss about it. But, at
the same time, there was GRACE to
consider. GRACE was all against that
sort of thing, and it was GRACE'S house.
And, you know, I had a lot of leeway to
make up with GRACE. I thought that if
I took up a strong line here she would
come to love and then to lean upon her
brother-in-law.
So one day, quite as a coincidence, I
ordered a gardener to tar the top of the
kitchen-garden wall. He seemed to
want to know the idea, so I said that it
would keep the slugs from climbing over
(slugs not being able to bear the smell of
tar), and that, anyhow, he didn't seem to
me to be doing much. I think he must
have caught on, because he grinned like
anything, and made a first-rate job of it.
Well, the walkers-out went through
the Balcony Scene again that night, and
I wondered what they would make of my
little hint. I shall never know definitely
what McGREGOR said; but next morning
an indignant ELLEN flounced into the
breakfast-room, and said that she wished
to give me notice. She seemed to have
taken it quite in the wrong spirit.

Schoolmaster. "Coup, TO MY BOOM AKTER SCHOOL, AKD I'LL GIVE YOU TUB SOUNDEST
THRASHING YOD EVER HAD!"
Boy (who nuffers from a ireak memory}. "YES, SIR. I 'LI. TIE A KNOT IN MY HANDKERCHIEF!"
No one has ever wished to give me
notice before. At the same time I had
gathered that it was rather a serious
thing to happen in a house. But I wasn't
going to be disturbed about it. I got
her assurance that threats, prayers, and
entreaties were alike useless; and then
I asked her what she was going to do.
It seemed onby kind to take an intelligent
interest in her future.
She replied rather darkly that those
who lived the longest would see the most,
though I doubt it myself. Also that she
wanted to go at once. So I gave her a
sovereign and said I hoped she and
Mr. McGREGOR would be very happy, and
would often think of me. Then I wrote
to GRACE that ELLEN was leaving at once
to get married.
GRACE'S first letter I pass over. I don't
see how I am in any way responsible for
the affections of a butcher who was once
a blacksmith. A week later she wrote
that no one in London knew anything
about servants; but that there was an
Ashurst girl who seemed fairly suitable.
"I have asked her to go over on Wednes-
day," she wrote, " and I know it's useless
for you to interview her, so I am getting
LILLIAN to see to it for me. Now don't
interfere, there's a good boy. LILLIAN
knows just what I want."
LILLIAN was staying with some friends
of hers called WILLEY—not that the
WII.LEY part is very important. How-
ever, she was due back on Tuesday night;
and, if GRACE had arranged it so, would
no doubt come over on the Wednesday
morning to interview the new maid. I
woidd certainly not interfere.
I was enjoying a peaceful pipe on the
fatal morning, when a maid came in
and announced that a young person
wished to see me.
"What sort of a young person?" I
asked.
"I think she's come about a situation,
Sir."
"Oh, help. LILLIAN—Miss MALLEY—•
was going to see about that. I wonder
why she isn't here."
"The young woman says she hasn't

much time, as she has to catch a train
back."
"Look here, send GEORGE or somebody
round to Miss MALLEY—quick. I sup-
pose I'd better talk to her a bit till
Miss MALLEY comes. I say, MARY, what
sort of questions ?Oh, never
mind."
I went into ARTHUR'S study where
she was. It was too awful being left
like this. I didn't know a bit what
one ought to ask her.
The first thing I noticed was that
she was jolly pretty, and looked very
smart, though of course quiet. As far
as I was concerned she might consider
herself engaged. But there were certain
formalities, I imagined.
"How do you do?" I began; "you 've
come about ELLEN'S place? Do sit down.
There'll be a lady here presently, but
there are just one or two things I want
to ask you."
"Thank you, Sir."
I looked about for a pen.
"Jolly day, isn't it? " I said.
"Yes, Sir?'
I got a pen and gnawed the end of it.
Then I sat down at the table, took a
sheet of paper, and looked first at it
and then at her.
"Was there anything else you wanted
to ask me, Sir?"'
I sat up with a start.
"Name," I said, sternly.
"JANE SMITH."
"JANE?"
"Surra. S-M-I-T-H."
"Yes, yes," I said. "That—er—that
seems all right. Age?"
"Twenty — twenty — twenty-three,"
she said, and giggled in a most absurd
way.
"I don't know why I asked you. I
don't suppose it matters much. Now
what else is there? Oh yes, are you
fond of work?"
"I try to do my duty, Sir."
"Yes, of course, of course. I felt sure
you did. Now what about followers?"
"Followers?"
"Yes. I know I ought to ask you
about that."
JANE SMITH drew herself up to her full
height, which wasn't so very much.
"Having none, partner?" I said. "I
mean—
"I don't think I understand."
"All right, all right. We '11 leave the
great follower question undecided. Have
you got your testimonials with you?"
I thought it was rather clever of me to
remember that.
"Oh," she said. "I haven't got any."
"Haven't got any? Now, what is the
good of coming here without your
testimonials? I suppose you haven't
even got a reference from a beneficed
clergyman of the Church of England?"
"N-no,Sir."
"You seem to me to have been very
badly brought up," I said sternly.
"What have you got? You must have
something."
"I 've a character from my last place."
"Hang it, that's what I meant. What
does it say?"
"Clean, sober"
"Sober is rather a point," I admitted.
"Steady, willing, hard-working, care-
ful-
"Stop," I said. "This is a quotation.
Yes, it is. I know the chapter quite
well. It's in one of the Epistles."
"Willing-
"You said willing. I don't believe it
comes twice in the original. Whv
should it?"
"Honest—
"I say, I 'm thinking we 're rather
lucky to get you."
"Hard-working, clean"
"That will do! You 're engaged."
"Steady, sober"
"Stop!" I heard a step in the hall.
"Hooray! There 's LILLIAN." I rushed
out, and caught hold of her. "Quick!
The new maid 's in there. She's telling
me her character. _ It's too awfully
good. Something will happen to her.
Do stop her."
I pushed her in, and went outside to
finish my pipe on the lawn.
After about ten minutes LILLIAN joined
me.
"Well," I said," did you engage her?"
"Yes, rather."
"Has she gone?"
"Yes, ETHEL 's just gone."
"ETHEL? She told me her name was
JANE SMITH."
"No. ETHEL JONES."
"I thought so. People aren't called
JANE SMITH."
"No, of course not."
"Why did she say JANE SMITH? She
must have had a false character. I'm
afraid she's taken you in, LILLIAN."
"No, I don't think so. And, DICK,
you 're to come to dinner to-night. And
look nice."
In the Malley drawing-room the first
person I saw was JANE SMITH, or ETHEL
JONES.
"Look here," I said indignantly, " I
engaged you. What are you doing
here?"
"Hallo, DICK," said LILLIAN, coming
up.
"I say, LILLIAN, this is cool. You 've
bagged our mnid. I distinctly engaged
JANE SMITH this morning myself, and
then you nip in"
"Mr. MEADOWES, Miss WILLEY," said
LILLIAN. "Look at the maid's nice new
evening dress, DICKIE."
"Lord !" I said.
"Sober is rather a point," said Miss
WILLET.
"I 'm thinking we 're rather lucky to
get you," said LILLIAN.
"Twenty — twenty — twenty-three,"
said Miss WILLEY, coyly.
"I try to do my duty, Sir," said
LILLIAN.
"It's a very old joke," I said to
LILLIAN, as I took her in. "You '11 find
the poor thing in She Stoops to Conquer."
"Oh, DICKIE, is that the way it's going
tobe?"
"Don't be absurd. Is she going to
stay long?"
"Some weeks."
"Good," I said.
MR. PUNCH'S "FIRST TREAT-
MENT" SERIES.
[An evening paper has just published an
article on the pressing subject " How to Deal
with a Dog Fish."]
I.—A POUR BEAR AT THE STORES.
THE principal point is locality; one's
plan of action depending very largely
upon the part of the building in which
the beast is encountered. For example,
if the polar bear should come upon you
in the Millinery Department the wisest
course would perhaps be at once to
seize the most expensive hat and show
him the price. During his fainting fit
you could climb out of the window or
up the chimney, or even find the door.
This plan might not, however, be infalli-
ble, for mppose the polar bear could not,
read? In the event of its failure you
would naturally make a break for the
next room, which might possibly be the
Fish Department.
Here nature would assist you, for you
would of course placate the foe with
mackerel and herrings, which you could
throw to him one by one (as at the
Hippodrome), walking backwards as
you did so, and eventually reaching the
door and safety. But Fate is seldom
so kind as that, and it is far more
likely that the entertainment-loving
gods would arrange it that your first
meeting with the bear was round a
corner, suddenly, in the Tobacco or
Drapery Department. Polar bears do
not smoke, and are not, we believe, sus-
ceptible to the charms of the leaf, so
you would need all your wits. The
thing to do would be swiftly to fill and
light several pipes at once, and smoke
them so furiously that you created an
impenetrable cloud, under cover of
which you could escape into a depart-
ment offering a better choice of weapons.
An umbrella, or even an en-iout-cas,
opened and shut, would probably perplex
and baffle the bear until help arrived.
In the Motor Department you would
hurriedly don an attire similar to that of
the enemy, and meet him thus on level

ground as a friend. He might even
take you for a wealthy beiress and fall
in love with you, and you could easily
make his passion his fall (as in the
case of SAMSON and MARK ANTONY) by
luring him to the doors of the lift,
leaping out just as it was descending
and then stopping it mid-way between
two floors, like MAHOMET'S coffin.
Supposing, however, that the Motor
Department contained no costume likely
to lead to the illusion named, you would
have to continue your sprint to, say, the
Wine and Spirits or Confectionery De-
partments. Probably ten-pound boxes
of caramels, or half a dozen bottles of
assorted liqueurs would be equally
effectual in detaining the adversary until
Scotland Yard could be communicated
with.
n.—A TIGER ON THE LINKS.
Instances of the escape of the larger
carnivores from travelling menageries
have been so frequent of late that it is
highly desirable to be prepared for such
an emergency as this. Tigers which
have been kept in captivity for any
length of time generally become foot-
sore, and on regaining their liberty
almost invariably leave the hard road for
grass-lands. Thus the well-kept turf of
a good golf-course proves irresistibly
attractive to an emancipated tiger, and
devotees of the Royal and Ancient game
will do well to lay their plans in advance
lest they should suddenly encounter one
of the monarchs of the jungle. It is ob-
vious that the danger can be considerably
minimised by the employment of a plump
fore-caddie, and on some links where
water-hazards abound can be success-
fully avoided by plunging into the burn
or pond. The greatest risk, however, is
run when the animal is lying in a sand
bunker where its colour harmonises most
deceptively with that of the surroundings.
To guard against this danger it is not a
bad plan to employ sand of a reddish
tint, but if this precaiition has not been
taken,'three courses are open to the player.
He may either drop suddenly on all
fours, a device which has sometimes been
known to put bulls to flight, or if he
happens to have any sandwiches in his
pocket he may offer them to the tiger, or,
as a last resource, he may use his niblick.
Whether the Fairlie or the ordinary
pattern is the better is difficult to say
off-hand, but at least it may be asserted
that in no circumstances should a wooden
club be used. In conclusion it may bo
noted that, whatever may be said as to
the advisability of saying Bo ! to a goose,
it is futile to cry Fore! to a tiger.
m.—A WHALE IN THE ROUND POND.
As is well known, showers of fishes
occasionally take place in abnormal
meteorological conditions, and if, as Sir
NORMAN LOCKYER and other experts
believe, there is good reason, to expect a
cycle of wet years of altogether excep-
tional humidity, the size of these fishes
will undoubtedly advance in geometrical,
if not in harmonic progression. The
appearance therefore of a whale in the
Round Fond can no longer be looked
upon as a remote contingency, and in
such cases to be forewarned is to be
forearmed. Panic is to be strongly
discouraged, for if it be true that it is
no good crying over spilt milk it is even
truer that it is no use to blubber over a
dropped whale.
Much, of course, will depend upon the
size of the whale, but assuming that he

(or she) is a full-blown sperm cachalob
the safest course is at once to telegraph
for Mr. FRANK BULI.EN, the great cetacean
specialist, and pending his arrival to
serenade the whale with a fidl band, con-
ducted by Mr. HEKRY BIRD, the organist
of the adjoining church of St. Mary
Abbot's. Whales, like seals, are noto-
riously susceptible to music, and will
remain perfectly quiescent when under
its spell. Mr. BITJ.LEN and his corps of
skilled harpooners may be trusted to do
the rest, and the oil can be drained off
into the Tube or the Underground,
where its lubricating qualities cannot
fail to promote the smoothness of the
traffic.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
DR. ALFRED WALLACE started what happily proved an
exceptionally long and supremely useful life under the
shadow of a cloud. "Our family had but few relations," he
mournfully mentions in the opening sentence of My Life
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), "and I myself never saw a grandfather
or a grandmother, nor a true uncle, and but one aunt.
Worse still, my father was practically an only son." A quaint
way of putting it, explained by the fact that an elder brother
died when three months old. Theae accumulated family
misfortunes would have broken the spirit of some men.
ALFRED RUSSELL WALLACE, endowed with a serene nature,
impregnable patience, irresistible energy and an insatiable
appetite for beetles, soared above his circumstances. He
was cheered on one occasion when, homeward-bound, he
anchored at Malta on account of the state of health of two
birds of paradise captured in the Malay Peninsula, and dis-
covered close by his hotel a baker's shop, where was avail-
able an unlimited supply of cockroaches. These the birds
of paradise ate, renewing their life like the eagle, and getting
safely to the Zoological Gardens in London. Starting
in life as a land surveyor, Dr. WALLACE'S instinct irresistibly
led him far afield in search of strange beetles, rarce oven,
quaint beasts, and unknown fish. In turn he visited the
Amazon, the Malay Archipelago, and Australasia, adding
rare specimens of natural objects to an unparalleled collection.
The book would have been better if it had been confined to
one volume instead of being stuffed by extraneous matter to
the size of two portly ones. But, as far back as the days of
HOMER, when seniors gather at the Scsean Gate they are apt
to grow garrulous. My Baronite finds temporary indulgence
in the octogenarian naturalist's garrulity delightful. Methu-
selah, conscious of exceptional advantages, was the man
to enjoy every line of these 900 pages of closely printed
type. Modern man, who hath but a short time to live, must
needs discriminate.
Messrs. METHTEN it Co. must not be considered amenable
to the charge of "belittling SHAKBPEAHE" in consequence of
their having reproduced all his works,-clearly printed, in
forty very small volumes under the style and title of Tlie
Little. Quarto Shakspeare. Each little book is perfectly
adapted to any pocket (with a shilling in it) not exceeding
three inches and a quarter wide, and four inches in depth.
Even with the instructive scholarly introductions and foot-
notes by W. J. (Jiuio, there is nothing whatever heavy about
them. The Baron advises the exhausted wayfarer, thirsting
for a draught from the Shakspearian spring, to drop into
any publisher's), accosting the attendant with, "What ho,
there! bring me a small quart o' ShakspeajW, neat." And
they are decidedly neat.
My Baronite suspects that Mrs. KATE DOUGLAS WIGC.IN'S
favourite amongst the characters in her new story, Hose o' the
River (CONSTABLE), is the one who fills the title role. Rose
Wiley is, in truth, sufficiently attractive to justify her pet
name, Briar Rose. By comparison with her lover, Stephen
Waterman, she is shallow, unsteadfast, distinctly selfish.
Stephen is what they call on the banks of the Saco River a
driver,*Anglld:, a man who directs the drifts of fallen forest
logs down the river to the lumber station. His vocation
gives KATE DOUGLAS an opening for a stirring description of
the picturesque scene when tlio logs get jammed and the
country-side turns out to free them. Reading the animated
page one feels the breath of the mountain air on his cheeks
anil hears the glad rush of the emancipated river. A
delightful character is Rose's grandfather, Mr. Wiley, with
his reminiscences of "old Kennebec" River and his out-
spoken contempt for the unimportance of the Saco, by whose
banks fortune and an impregnable dislike for hard work have
brought him. As usual, KATE DOUGLAS does not spoil good
work by attenuation. Rose o' the River is a dainty little volume,
charmingly illustrated by Mr. GEORGE WRIGHT, and calculated
to carry the reader through a couple of pleasant hours.
On Picturesque Yorkshire (VALENTINE AND SONS) Mr.
WILLIAM ANDREWS and his editor, A. II. MILLAR, F.S.A. Scot.,
are to be congratulated. Walter-Seotians, remembering
Isaac of York, will sincerely hope that he was not. among
the five hundred Jews who, at the accession of RICHARD THE
FIRST, suffered at the hands of these Yorkers. The illustra-
tions, reproduced photographs, are excellent.
In writing The Difficult \\'aij (SMITH, EI.IIER), MABKL DEAUMEII
sets herself a difficult task. It is to trace out the process by
which a woman, absolutely regardless of self, its weakness
and its passions, reaches the perfectness of a happy life by
giving herself up to working out the physical and spiritual
good of others. The theme is familiar enough. The merit
lies in so handling it that it shall avoid the commonplace.
This triumph has been achieved. There are some not alto-
gether satisfactory characters in the play. But the principal
part, assumed by Nan Pilgrim, is finely conceived and admi-
rably worked out. After a fashion not unknown to women
who write and to some men, MABEL DEAUMER has used up
scraps of home-made poetry, and, a propos dc ho'les, scatters
them over her pages. There is one on page 154, a gem of
eleven lines, in which my Baronite recognises true poetry.
Ten Years of Tory (loremment (Liberal Publication De-
partment) is perhaps a little monotonous in its tone. Pro-
fessedly a handbook for the use of Liberals, it abundantly
provides powder and shot for the forthcoming election
campaign. Omitting the Fiscal Question, a merciful con-
cession, it covers the record of Tory dealing with domestic
questions from 1895 to the end of last session. As Mr.
BIKRELL, who contributes what is sometimes called a Foreword,
admits, the book is compiled from a Liberal point of view.
But, as he justly adds, "chapter and verse is given for
every statement printed." Whilst Liberal candidates will
find it exceedingly meaty in the way of sustaining their
cause, my Baronite recommends it to gentlemen on the other
side as usefully indicating in advance what they have to
answer, and, if possible, to refute.
The Spider's Eye, by WILLIAM LE QUEUX (CASSELL & Co.).
Not a bad title; but is a spider's "wision limited" to one
optic? Let not any skipper imagine that a mere cursory
reading will enable him to pass an examination as to
intricacies of plot. Here, is a poser, put by one of the
characters to another—"But were you aware of irho the
man was who was discovered dead in your room?" No
wonder the reply is "No; not in the least." Those who
remember Dora may think they are about to detect a criminal
by " a faint odour of some sweet perfume, the same odour that
permeated the drawer in which
the handkerchiefs were kept"—
but not a bit of it. This is only
the trail of the red herring. The
literary sensational sportsman
who rides in Mr. LE QUEUX'S
country has his work cut out
for him, but he will go right
through from cover to cover,
and will congratulate himself
on a good run, even if it be
not quite up to the best of what
this Master has previously pro-
vided for him.

THE LIBERAL SPLIT.

Miranda ........ Almost any Unionist, disguised as a
Primrose Dame, in an Empire gown.
SCENE—Cornwall. Rocky coast.
WHEN Duke Antonio's ship in SHAKSPEARE'S play
Was by the Tempest's violence abused,
There followed, so the stage directions say,
"A noise within," deplorably "confused,"
And, much concerned at losing wife and kit,
The crew remarked, "We split, we split, we split!"
'Twas then Miranda, from her rocky cell
Observing what was going on at sea,
Said she would thank her sire to go and quell
The blizzard raised by his own devilry;
And, pleading softly like a plaintive dove,
Threw off the passage which appears above.
An Allegory. Lo! the Liberal craft—
Lately through halcyon seas we saw her plough;
Tried Admirals controlled her fore and aft,
Six at the helm and seven at the prow,
When suddenly, at Prosperosebery's word,
Out of the calm a hurricane occurred.
Banished to solitude beside the wave
(Land's End, or else the Lizard) he had donned
Magician's robes, and from his seaward cave,
For so the fancy took him, fetched his wand
And called the whirlwinds out, and cried "What ho!
Send me yon Liberal lugger down below!"
There was aboard her, when the good ship brake,
A brother who had occupied his shoes;
The hermit may have wished for old time's sake
To show that he could shock him, should he choose;
That is, no doubt, C.-B. Antonio's view,
Explaining why the thing was split in two.
And sad Miranda—who assumes her role?
It couldn't be Tlie Westminster Gazette,
For though that organ, like an injured soul,
Regards the split with infinite regret,
Still, for a daughter pleading with Papa,
Its tone is much too much de haut en bas.
I would, myself, engage to speak the part,
In Empire costume, as a Primrose dame:—
"Sire, you have given our nerves a horrid start;
You mustn't, please, repeat that jumpy game;
Spare the poor crew whom we would gladly see
Snug in the haven where they want to be.
"0 by the name of PKIMROSE, which we share
(And we have tastes in common, more than one),
Do not, ah do not, damage past repair
Our prospect of a little quiet fun;
Bring them to land, and speed with timely aid
Our hopes of Opposition long delayed!" 0. S.
WE are glad to learn from The Times that a Pan-Polish
Committee has been formed at Warsaw. This should brighten
things up a little.
THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION.
[Shotting hole aucce»8fully Mr. Audit as "A'icfr Bottom" maJtes an
Asehe of himself at the Adelphi.]
MR. OTIIO STUART has done a wise thing in anticipating
Christmas entertainments by a revival of SHAKSPEARE'S exquisite
fairy comedy, A Midsummer Night's Dream, which, it is sale
to predict, will find favour with all playgoers. It will come
"as a boon and a blessing" to the pu/zled parents and
guardians who, during the holidays, are so anxious to give
the young folks from school not only a real treat for their
present delectation but one which, when they arrive at bein^
laudatores temporis acti, will be to them ever memorable
among their recollections of the stage.
Messrs. HICKS and HARKER, the scenic artists, have done
excellent work for this production, Carpenter Quince's home
nt Athens being a cleverly contrived interior, and the
Wood Scene as effective a " set" as lias ever been placed on
any stage. When one remembers the woodland pictures at
other theatres that within the last few years have been
recognised as gems of scene-painting, to place this one among
them is to bestow upon it praise of a distinctly high character.
As the scenery in itself is an attraction contributing its
share towards the achievement of general success, so too is
the music under the direction of Mr. CHRISTOPHER WILSOX,
ably seconded by his assistant Mr. FERRARI. MENDELSSOHN'S
overture begins at eight punctually, and everyone, delighting
in this charming expression of the composer's fancy, should
manage to be quietly seated a few minutes before that hour,
in order to enjoy the delicious music that has now become
part and parcel of The Dream. The orchestra is just a trifle
too loud, but with this slight exception, a fault which it is pro-
bable ere now has been remedied, the instrumental music is
admirably rendered throughout, as are the songs and choruses.
As the first "Singing Fairy" (Oberon and Titania apparently
keep only three principal choristers, whose names do not
appear in the Fairy Court Circular, where only their special
qualifications as "first, second, and third, singing fairy"
are recorded) Miss ELIZABETH PARKINA sang the familiar
"Over Hill, over Dale" with great charm; and the ever
popular duet, "I know a bank," was so well rendered by
Miss PARKINA and the "Second" Fairy, Miss ETHEL JAMES, as
to be enthusiastically redemanded.
A little later Fairy PARKINA joined with a spritely friend of
hers, namely Miss PATTIE HORNSBY, the Third Fairy, in the
well-known duet " You Spotted Snakes." Subsequently did
this industrious and indefatigable vocalist, the Fairi/PARKiNA,
sing the solo and lead the chorus in'' On the Ground" written by
Master CHRISTOPHER WII.SON (the Musical Director who is " keep-
ing up the CHRISTOPHER"), finishing with the Mendelssohnian
"Tlirough the House" which, with its chorus, gives so telling
a termination to the dramatic Fairy Tale. So Miss PARKINA,
tout-a-fait La Fee, having plenty to do and plenty to get, in
the way of applause, does her spiriting well and gracefully.
And now for the "Immortals," "Mortals," and lastly "The
Clowns," who are mentioned as some creation entirely apart.
Fairies first. Let us agree that the ordinary fairies
should be as small as possible. They ought to be so tiny
that the fur of mice would provide them with winter-coats,
and that for any one of them an acorn-shell would be an
ample hiding place. Granted. Well, such as these, any Act
of Parliament or of the L. C. C. "all to the contrary notwith-
standing," it is impossible to obtain. So we are treated to
the smallest size procurable, and merry little elves they are,
perfectly trained, thoroughly intelligent, and working with
a will. The mortal Indian boy, the cause of the domestic
squabble 'twixt Oberon and Titania, is a chubby little trot,
rather smaller than the least of the fairies, who wins the
hearts and "hands" of all beholders.

by qiiite a couple of feet, but Low otherwise could it have
been, seeing that his jealous Queen Titanla (sweetly repre-
sented, with delicate sense of humour, by Miss ROXY BARTON)
reminds him of his amours with Phillida, and straitly accuses
him of conducting himself in a rather unfairylike manner
towards " the bouncing Amazon" Hippolyta (amply represented
by Miss CONSTANCE ROBERTSON), now about to become the bride
of Tfieseus, who finds a stolidly dignified impersonator in Mr.
ALFRED BRYDONE. And no pigmy fairy could Tilania have been,
seeing that Oberon plainly accuses her of being a Fairy "with
a past" in respect to this same redoubtable TJieseus. So, as
to size, we may consider the cast of the fairies so far satis-
factory. Miss BEATRICE FERRAR is bright and lively as Puck,
a character of which it is well-nigh impossible for anyone to
give more than a fairly satisfactory impersonation.
As Lysander and Demetrius^ Mr. H. R. HIGNETT and Mr.
IAN PENNY are respectively deserving of much praise. Miss
FRANCES DILLON is a comparatively quiet Herinia until aroused,
when a tiger cat is not in it with her. This situation, the
quarrel, a regular low vulgar slum-alley row between two
young ladies, is one of the most telling in the piece. I do not
ever remember having seen its force so strongly brought out
as it is by Miss DILI/IN as Hermia and Miss LILY BRAYTON
as Helena. Miss BRAYTON, looking so pretty and speaking so
distinctly, does all that possibly am be done with the part.
Mr. CALEB PORTER bears himself well, not a very heavy
burden, as Old Egeus, father of Hermia, who, it seems, held
some official position at the rather meagrely attended court
of Theseus, Duke of Athens.
And the mention of the court brings me in due course
to " The Clowns." Mr. LYALL SWETE, to whom the character
of Peter Quince is no novelty, resumed his old part to the
evident satisfaction of the audience. Messrs. CHARLES ROCK,
KAY SOUPER, and H. Krrrs, individualised Snug, Flute, and
Snout with considerable humour. Why Starveling, Mr. HERBERT
GRIMWOOD, should be represented as stone-deaf, puzzles me.
Is it an old stage tradition? If so it is a stupid one, and
when overdone, as it is here, the business becomes tedious.
Where is the authority for it in the original text?
As for the Nick Bottom of Mr. OSCAR ASCHE it is most artistic.
His thorough enjoyment of his own importance, his assumption
of superiority, his airs of condescension, his overweening
conceit, as a theatrical amateur, evidenced in his thrusting
himself forward to show his companions how every part ought
to be played, are all phases of character perfectly true to nature,
and not in the least overcharged in representation. Then his
nervousness before the ducal audience, and, on its gradually
wearing itself out, his vulgar familiarity with Duke TJieseus
and Duchess Hippolyta, are admirable. His utter absence of
luimour and his evident air of crediting himself with being an
exceptionally entertaining personage, are finely brought out by
Mr. OSCAR ASCHE. In that most difficult scene where lie has to
wear the pantomimic head of a donkey he is excellent,
and to his signal success Miss BARTON'S Titania, so madly in
love with this utter ass, artistically contributes.
The management may be heartily congratulated on the
production, and Mr. OSCAR ASCHE ought to have no reason for
regretting it as an Oscar rash venture.

NATURE STUDIES.
THE LODGING-HOUSE "GENERAL."
I MADE her acquaintance in lodgings at Brighton, where
she did all that was to be done in the house. She was very
hard-working, and had, so far as I could judge, no repose,
either in the limited sense of manner or in the general sense
of taking rest. The staircase, the rooms and the passages
resounded with her labour. If you can imagine a substantially
embodied hurricane clattering up-stairs with a breakfast-tray
in its hands, bursting with violence through a door, exclaim-
ing "I done it quick that time," and then panting itself out
as it arranged cups and dishes and the rest on the table, you
will have some faint idea of the methods practised by this
indomitable girl. Nothing ever pierced through the armour
of her good nature. Once when, having all but reached the
landing with her tray, she made a false step and rolled, like
the shameless stone of Sisyphus, to the bottom, she rose from
the welter of tea, and buttered toast and poached eggs with
a pleasant smile, remarked that she 'd been bumped a lot
worse than that many a time afore, and immediately began
her cheerful preparations for restoring the feast. I cannot
say that her immunity from hurt much surprised me, for
her figure was one that nature seemed by way of precau-
tion to have encased in oak and triple brass, over which
her print dress fitted with a wonderful rigidity. Her slippers
were down at heel, and the noise they made as she hurled
herself across a room reminded her, she often said, of scaring
rooks with a clapper—for she had originally come from a
farm, and still had in her bearing something of the amiable
ungainliness of the cows with whom her early days had
been passed.
To my mother, who was with me on this visit, she took a
great fancy. She would burst in upon her at odd times
(always with a tray), and relate to her in a hoarse whisper
many stirring incidents of her family history. One of these
conversations I overheard: "I wonder," began CONSTANCE, for
that was her name, "I wonder 'ow long I shall stay 'ere.
There 's only me, yer see—nobody to talk to—lor', it is dull
—yer see there's nobody to call young in this 'ouse—my! it
is quiet. There was three where I was afore, and we was

'card o' my brother GEORGE, I s'pose? Ah, 'e was a good un;
'e 'd got a look o' your son, but bigger in the moustache and
bolder lookin', and my brother was clever; 'e could write
potry, 'e could, but 'e's dead now. I Ve brought 'is likeness
to show you—that's 'is young lydy beside 'im—and 'ere's the
bit 'o potry 'e wrote when my brother JACK died; they 're
beautiful, the verses are. Mother 'ad "em printed orf.'and
I '11 give you the copy 'cos you 're kind." These were the
verses, in which I keep the punctuation of the original:—
In memory of my brother dear,
These few lines I hare composed:
He is not dead in our memory here,
Althongh this life is closed.
It was on board a barquentine,
Ann Humphreys was her name,
JOHN HABRISON sailed from Limerick,
His living for to gain.
It was on the nineteenth day of March,
They encountered a stimsh breeze;
He got wet through, then caught a cold,
Which never did him leave.
It was on the nineteenth day of April,
He came home too ill tp wqrk;
He came home to a mother's care,
Where he could breath his native air.
It was on the nineteenth day of August,
Just five months from the start,
Our dear lad died a happy death,
Although 'twas sad for us to part.
Dear friends, this seems a singular thing,
Each day of these months should be nineteen;
But wait, there's one more for this page,
For he was nineteen years of age.
Friends? why yes, I should think he had,
For he found them on every hand;
They did their best for this poor lad,
Before he left his native land.
But still we know that he is better off,
Although a vacant place at home
Can ne'er be filled upon this earth,
For God has called him for his own.
"Ah," continued the girl, when my mother had finished
reading these lines, "I can see you like 'em. We all think 'em
beautiful. I went to the cemetery last Sunday with some
flowers for 'is grave."
"Where is he buried?" asked my mother.
"What, GEORGE? Why atop o' JACK," and with that she
hurtled out of the room.
BE IN TIME.
(Some Seasonable Warnings.)
THE Postmaster-General issued last week his usual despair-
ing instructions to the public to post early for Christmas, to
tie up parcels securely, to make sure postage is fully pre-
paid, to address letters clearly, to obtain ample supplies of
stamps, to see that envelopes fit the stamps, and so on.
There is nothing like being in good time, and Christmas
gets earlier every year. The present-giving, card-despatching
and holiday season now begins at the end of November, and
we shall soon have it in mid-autumn. Mr. Punch, therefore,
implores his readers to start at once out of town so as to
avoid the rush three weeks later, to take care to buy their
tickets and see that their luggage is correctly labelled, to
provide themselves with sufficient money for a prolonged
stay in the country or at Monte Carlo (say), and not to come
back till the coast is clear.
All Christinas annuals should long before now be back
numbers and relegated to the nursery or foreign parts, with
the exception, of course, of a certain indispensable Illustrated
Almanack which will retain its freshness till its successor
arrives, and after.
"He gives twice who gives early" should be the motto
for purchasers of presents. Select and distribute, therefore,
your etrennes without further delay, and there will then be
ample time for their pleased recipients to pass them on three
or four times over before Dec. 25th. Those who wait till
the last moment and buy late will also, in accordance with
the proverb, pay twice as much for being in a hurry.
Get your Christmas and New Year's Greetings over and
done with as early as possible this week. This will show
that you are alive to the situation and know how to avoid
banalities on the dates in question.
If you are the Waits, amateur or professional, stop doing
it At Once, and give up the practice altogether.
If you expect Christmas boxes of any kind, be sure to ask
for them Now. This is a trying experience for all parties,
and should not be allowed, through undue delay, to mar the
season's festivities.
The observance of these simple precautions will enable
the public to spend a quiet and unjostled holiday, and to
attend to the turkey, the plum pudding and the pantomime
in a proper frame of mind.

I.—Norway AND “THE TIMEs.”
A NorwegiaN ship-owning firm is so
enchanted by the tone of The Times
articles on the formation of the new
kingdom of Norway that it has asked
permission to name one of its new
vessels The Times, to which the powers
of Printing House Square have graciously
consented, on condition that the ship is
never allowed to approach nearer than
ten knots to the Mael-strom.
That, however, is not all. The
Encyclopædia Britannica is to be the
sole ballast employed; all the officers
and crew are to subscribe to The Times
library; and as a compliment to The
Times staff various important parts of
the vessel are to be named after the
principal writers on the paper. The
following is a list of some of the new
names that have been decided upon :-
The Compass {i, to *}The Buckle.

II.-NewfoundLAND AND “The DAILY
MAIL.”
In connexion with recent political
events which have led to the internal
development of this interesting island,
the Editor of The DailyMail has received
a signal compliment conveyed in the
following letter from the Governor of
Newfoundland:—
“During the negotiations which pre-
ceded the conclusion of the Anglo-
French agreement, it has been a great
comfort and satisfaction to us all to note
the appreciation, sympathy, and support
with which our case has been met in the
columns of your highly esteemed and
altogether coruscating journal. As the
result of an unanimous plebiscite of the
entire population, I am empowered to
inform you that it is the intention of the
Colony to rename all the principal towns,
capes, &c., in your honour. The details
are not all decided, but I may men-
tion that it is practically settled to
rename St. John's St. Alfred's, while
Capes Bauld, Ray, and Race, will hence-
forth be known as Capes Harold, Hilde-
brand, and Cecil. The Annieopsquotch

Mountains, hitherto sadly handicapped
by their cacophonous title, will, it is con-
fidently believed, take a new and more
commanding position under the im-
pressive cognomen of the Carmelite
Rockies, and the Blowmedown Mountains
have been felicitously rechristened
Begbie's Beacons. A slight contretemps
has arisen owing to the fact that seven-
teen different towns have all clamoured
for the honour of being renamed Answers-
ville, but it is hoped that this difficulty
may be arranged by the process of
drawing lots amongst the eighty-three
newspapers conducted under your
management. But before going any
further, we make free to ask your kind
sanction to use the name of your revered
family to replace that by which the island
is at present known. 'Harmsworthland,'
in the opinion of every thinking man, is
at once a more concise, heroic and tasty
appellation than that under which we
now labour; and we foresee a time
when no newspaper office in Great
Britain will be complete without a
Harmsworthland dog."
In reply the Editor of The Daily Mail
has assured the Governor that lie was
honoured by the proposal, and gladly
accorded whatever sanction might be in
his power.
III.—QUEENSLAND AXD "THE SPECTATOR."
Great exultation prevails at No. 1,
Wellington Street, Strand, in conse-
quence of the extremely gratifying
cablegram recently received by the
Editor from the Premier of Queensland.
The message was as follows :—" Nothing
has given greater comfort during pro-
longed drought than your matchless
animal stories. Leading local million-
aire offers to endow Professorship of
Supernatural History at Never Never
University, on condition it is allied The
Spectator Professorship, and that the
holder shall be (1) an efficient member
of rifle club, (2) Free trader. Shall be
glad to hear whether you approve pro-
posal." The Editor, we learn, has des-
patched a reply in the following terms:
—" Delighted by generous and tactful
compliment. By this simultaneous in-
sistence on the paramount importance
of free trade, the rifle, and the long-bow,
another nail has been driven into the
coffin of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S sinister pro-
posals."

Upon the stretch of turf between
The distant bunker and the green;
The coy approach which deftly hops
Into the atmosphere and stops ^

That consummates a perfect three—
Such things are good enough for me.
Give me a foe whose constant aim
Throughout the round is much the same
Aa mine—to win a sporting game;
Yet let him be, upon the whole,
A mild, unadjectival soul,
A monument of self control.
Give me a caddie disinclined
To fall unduly far behind
And sport with others of his kind.
Then, if the morning chance to wear
A countenance serene and fair,
With just a sparkle in the air,
I crave of Fate no more; for when
She smiles upon me thus, why, then
I am at peace with gods and men.

[In an interview in La Liberte M. GEORGES OHNET complains that
conditions have not changed in favour of the novelist since he began his

TIME was when rny works were awaited
With eager expectant delight;
'Twos woman's whole duty to rave of the beauty
Of all that I happened to write.
They read me with ardour unbated,
Old frurnps and delectable girls,
The middle-class maiden, the dowager laden
With adipose tissue and pearls.
The publishers' they swarmed,
They filled each thronging room;
In bookshops, too, one found a crew
Of ladies who fought all they knew;
The libraries they stormed,
Regardless of their doom,
By hook or crook to get my book- -
In short, it was a boom.
But, ladies, I 've passed out of fashion
With dodos and Latin and Greek;
Your reading consists of short snippets and lists of
The notable books of the week;
Rough games are your dominant passion,
And every sweet hour when you 're free
From the Club or the City or Suffrage Committee
Is given to sport—not to me.
Across the links yon stride
In rugged Harris tweed,
You swim, you float, you yacht and boat,
You love to mote in great fur coat,
A/azeppa-like you ride
To hounds at break-neck speed;
There's one thing you refuse to do—>
You never, never read.
Nay, that's not the worst of the story;
Not only on publishers' shelves
Am I left forsaken, but, ladies, you've taken
To writing your fiction yourselves.
Each JAKE has a perfect jurore
For scribbling long reams of MS.,
And I don't know a FANNY, a KATE, or an ANNIE
Who isn't just going to press.
But all your toil is vain,
And voe will soon begin,
Your meal will fly, your cruse be dry,
When none come nigh your wares to buy;
Soon each must needs obtain
Her neighbour's book to win
Her daily steak, like those who take
Each other's washing in.
IF we may believe The Daily Mail's headlines,—
"C.-B/' SPEAKS,

How seldom our statesmen lay their entire innermost
thoughts before us in this frank and oiitspoken manner!

THE "HOW TO" PAPERS.
No. III.—How TO FURNISH A BEDROOM.
LET us suppose that your room is
constructed with four walls, one floor, one
ceiling, one door, one window, and one
fireplace. A word about each of these.
Walls.—It is customary to have pieces
of paper stuck on to the walls of a room.
This is done by means of a substance
called paste. You first buy enough
paper for the purpose and then call in a
tradesman known as a paper-hanger and
say to him, "Hang this paper." You
need only say it once, unless you decide
to stick the paper on yourself, in which
case you will say it more frequently.
Floor.—This is the part of the room
you will walk on. In order to save wear
of the wood of which it is made, you
must cover it with a carpet. Carpets
may be bought either at Wilton (near
Salisbury), in Turkey, in Brussels, or in
Pile. Pile is not shown on the maps.
Ceiling.- -It is not necessary to carpet
the ceiling. The flies prefer it white-
washed.
Door.—A structure of wood made to
open either outwards or inwards. Make
up your mind whether you wish to enter
your room or to leave it more frequently,
and have the door hung accordingly.
Window. —A more inconvenient means
of entrance or egress than the last, but
preferred by burglars. "Window," like
"orange," has no known rhyme in the
English language, but there the resem-
blance ceases.
Fireplace.—This, as its name implies,
is the place for a fire, but it may also be
used as a fernery.
The most expensive article of furniture
in a properly equipped bedroom is the
bed, because it lias to be made every day.
It is usually made of wood or iron and,
where thorough efficiency is required, it
might be as well to keep a carpenter or
a blacksmith on the premises to attend
to the matter. The spread of technical
education, however, lias made it possible
sometimes to find a housemaid who knows
how to make a bed. A bed is intended
to sleep in, and is generally considered
the most suitable article manufactured
for that purpose, although a well-
cushioned pew is held by some to be an
efficient substitute. It is not recom-
mended, however, that a bedroom should
be furnished with a pew. Where
economy is a desideratum a water 'bed
(not to be confounded with the bed of
the ocean) might perhaps serve the
purpose. These are recommended by
the faculty, and are used by invalids.
Where the water-rate is low this idea is
worth consideration. Some doctors also
recommend hop pillows. This recom-
mendation is apt to be misunderstood
and consequently resented.
Clothes are usually kept in a bedroom,
and it would be obviously inconvenient
to have them in a heap upon the floor,
which is intended for other purposes.
Nor is the ceiling available, for reasons
connected with the law of gravity dis-
covered by Sir ISAAC NEWTOK. The
ingenuity of ages has therefore brought
to perfection various receptacles, of
which the best known are the wardrobe
and the chest of drawers. It would be
an impertinence to describe either of
these pieces of furniture, and impertin-
ence is no part of the design of these
papers.
We now turn to the washstand. To
obviate the necessity of performing the
customary matutinal ablutions Tinder a
tap in the kitchen or the stable-yard,
it occurred to some ingenious inventor
in bygone years to provide a basin and
ewer in the sleeping-chamber itself.
The ewer is filled with water at stated
intervals, and from it the basin can be
charged with a supply sufficient for all
practical purposes. The corollary idea
of elevating both basin and ewer to a
convenient height soon brought about
the discovery of the washstand as we
know it to-day, the whole process being
a remarkable instance of the evolution
of ideas. It does not seem to be neces-
sary to say anything more about the
washstand.
The question of the dressing-table is
a more complicated one, but it is useless
to try and burke it. Hairpins, we sup-
pose, must be kept somewhere, and the
same may be said of silver-topped scent
bottles. Then why not on a dressing-
table? The problem, if problem there
be, thus simply stated, solves itself.
Upon the dressing-table, sometimes a
component part of it, stands a looking-
glass for the purpose of reflecting the
form and features of him or her who
uses it. A lady's dressing-table is
usually provided with two small drawers,
in one of which she may keep her
watch and her fringe-nets and in the
other her purse. When pockets again
come into fashion the second drawer
will become less necessary.
Every bedroom should contain a chair
or two. It is well to be provided against
all contingencies, and it may very well
happen that the occupier of the bedroom
at some time or another may wish to sit
down. He or she would then be in a
very awkward predicament if these useful
articles of furniture had been left out of
account when the room was being
furnished.
We have said nothing about the
decoration of the bedroom, and intend to
say nothing. This may be left entirely
to the preference of the occupier. If
your tastes run in the direction of plush
brackets and peacocks' feathers, by all
means have them. If not, leave them
out of your scheme of decoration. It is
your room, and nobody eke has the
slightest right to criticise. We speak
strongly on this subject because we feel
strongly. More harm is done by ill-
considered advice than is generally
supposed. We, for our part, know where
to stop, and we stop here.
THE DARING DAMSEL.
[" Young ladies are the only people nowadays
who have the courage of their opinions, and all
the daring books are written by feminine pens."
—Lady Violet Grevitte.]
NOWADAYS, where can you find
Men who dare to speak their mind?
Only ladies who are young
Have a quick, courageous tongue.
Who, amongst the modern men,
Wields a ready, fearless pen?
Only maids of seventeen
Dare to scribble what they mean.
Literary maidens write
Daringly, with all their might,
And, presumably, intend
That our hair shall stand on end.
I have often thought of them,
Sitting down at nine A.M.,
And endeavouring to shock
Somebody, till one o'clock.
I can almost hear them laugh,
As they pen a paragraph
Full of wicked little bits
Guaranteed to give us fits.
Maidens, I believe you make
An excusable mistake.
You are very young and so
Cannot be supposed to know.
But the things that seem to you
Daring are not very new,
For the newest, I believe,
Is about as old as EVE.
If you ever make our eyes
Bulge a little with surprise,
It is when you illustrate
Maiden English up-to-date.
You unquestionably can
Startle the grammarian
In a way that puts to shame
Any man that I could name.
You accept no aged rules
From academies and schools.
Fearlessly you stand alone,
With a grammar of your own.
THERE was a young lady of Condover
Whose husband had ceased to be fond
of her:
He couldn't forget
That he 'd loved a brunette:—
And peroxide had since made a blonde
of her.

WE are in a position to state definitely
the truth about Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-
BANNERMAN and Home Rule. It is un-
fair to vSir HENRY to assert that he is an
out-and-out Home Ruler. The matter
depends entirely upon the size of his
majority at the General Election. It is
quite possible that this majority may
be large enough to enable him to scout
the idea. Sir HENRY hopes that the last
may now be heard of a discussion which
was not of his own choosing, and is
distasteful to him.
The CZAR, it is stated, in view of the
general situation, has decided
to cancel all State ceremonies

demonstration on the anniver-
sary of his accession.

with this formality is, we believe, an
American one. We say this without
any wish to detract from the Mayor
of ISLINGTON'S pluck.
The Mayor of ISLIXOTON has also pro-
posed that the various Borough Councils
shall have a central intelligence exchange.
The difficulty here would be that some
of the Borough Councils might have
nothing to offer.
Lord STANLEY has now stated that post-
men are not blood-suckers, and has thus

tage in the discussion which ensues

buted to their good teeth and

their not being monarchs of a
neighbouring State.

Owing to the comparative failure of
the sardine fisheries, thousands of sprats
are being pressed into the service of
foreign sardine merchants, but, if we
are to believe a story which reaches us,

tin last week, he found, on the top of
a number of sprats, a family of six
sardines, huddled together for social
warmth.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE appearance of the Memoirs of Sir Wemyss Reid (CASSELL)
was looked forward to, in political circles, with exceptional
interest. For a quarter of a century he had established
personal relations with public men that gave him insight to
the working of the machinery of politics. In succession he
enjoyed the confidence of Mr. W. E. FORSTER, Mr. GLADSTONE,
and Lord ROSEBERY. Beyond these he knew all who were worth
knowing among lesser stars of the political firmament. A keen
observer, a trained writer, it was reasonable to suppose that
his memoirs, written and prepared for publication before his
death, would be a valuable contribution to the history of our
own time. The anticipation will doubtless be realised when
the publication is completed. In the volume just issued the
narrative does not extend beyond the year 1885, compre-
hending a comparatively humdrum epoch. It was in the
following year that Mr. GLARSTONE, nailing the Home Rule
flag to the Liberal ship, completed its hopeless wreckage.
"For political reasons" the editor, Mr. STUART REID, brother
of the memoirist, defers publication of what was written after
that date. This has something of the effect of making a sort of
one-horse shay of the book. Yet, regarded solely on its merits,
the instalment is interesting and excellent. The struggling
journalist slowly making his way in an honourable career will
find much encouragement. REID began without the aid of
adventitious circumstances. By sheer capacity, indomitable
energy, tireless industry, he won his way to the front rank.
As he tells of his own life, its early difficulties, its latest
successes, he introduces many piquant portraits of public
men met by the way. Amongst other things the memoirs bring
into powerful light the immense strides the provincial Press
has taken during the last thirty years, bringing some on a level
of equality with their metropolitan contemporaries. To this
end, REID, during his editorship of The Leeds Mercury, appre-
ciably contributed. His familiar friends, among whom my
Baronite is proud to have counted himself, will agree with
Lord ROSEBERY in recognising in him "the high example of
a brave and unselfish life."
The Baron's heart mightily rejoiceth at the reappearance
of good old Gammer Grethel, with all her familiar fairy tales.
Would that the reproductions of the illustrations were
more satisfactory, for are not the pictures GEORGE CRUICK-
SHANX'S? Assuredly so. CRUICKSHANK was never, aa an
artist, "a lady's man" (note his failure with Rosebud and
The Goose Girl), nor ever the best kind of Fairies' man,
being, in this line of business, but a poor second to
DICKY DOYLE, while as to humorous and grotesque drawings
he was nowhere near Sir JOHN TENNIEL, the inimitable
creator of Alice-in-Wonderland's queer people; yet for
genuine drollery there have been few who could give us
siich a laugh as CRUICKSHANK does with, for example, his
illustration to the story of The Jew in the Bush. Could the
idea of swift travelling be more clearly expressed than it is
by CRUICKSUANK in his picture of the Prince seated on the
brush of the running fox? His"Pe-wit" and his "Heads
Off" are simply delicious. The Baron is aware that there
are two ways of spelling this artist's name, but prefers the
above, for which there is excellent authority. The full title of the
book is Gammer GretJteVs Fairy Tales (THE DE LA MORE PRESS).
For some years Dr. ROBERTSON NICOI.L has delighted the readers
of a widely circulated weekly paper with a lay sermon. The
subjects have ranged from eels to CHARIX>TTE BRONTE, from
spectacles to Dr. GEORGE MACDONALD, from potatoes and
cabbage to GEOROE ELIOT and JANE AUSTEN. In the interim
divers topics suggested by recent reading or the events of the
day are dealt with in chatty, withal cultured fashion that
instructs while it charms. Dr. NICOLL has made a selection
of his essays, which HODDER AND STOUCHTON publish under the
title The Day Book of Claudius Clear. My Baronite assures
those, who have not come across the papers in the weekly
aforesaid that the pages of Tlie Day Book are well worth
turning over.
A pretty little portable Pocket Diary for 1906 (EYRE AND
SPOTTISWOODE) can be recommended by the Baron as practically
useful, and for its quotations interesting. Get some of these
by heart and you will never be at a loss when asked to write
a few lines in an album.
Two volumes of A History of Our Ou~n Times (CHATTO AND
WINDUS) complete Mr. JUSTIN MCCARTHY'S magnum opus.
They cover the period between the Diamond Jubilee of
Queen VICTORIA in 1897 and the accession of King EDWARD VII.
Whilst presenting a comprehensive narrative of events closely
concerning the British Empire during those dates, the
volumes include a review of changes through which public
life, Literature, Art, and Science, passed during the long
reign of Queen VICTORIA. My Baronite notes a marked
difference of style in these supplementary volumes com-
pared with those that went before. They are much quieter
in tone and colour, thereby even exceeding the quality of
impartiality which marked the earlier instalments. In in-
creasing measure Mr. MCCARTHY discloses his conviction that
it is the historian's business to narrate, not to argue. The
result is the presentation of a dispassionate survey of public
events happening through a critical epoch in the history
of the Empire and the world. The narrative, thus concluded
up to recent date, will be a prized acquisition to the library
not only of those who study history but of those who make it.
Mr. HALDANE MACFALL'S Sir Henry Irriiig (T. N. FOL'LIS) is
to a certain extent valuable as a contribution to our informa-
tion concerning the life of the great actor whose loss we all
deplore. As a' frontispiece there is a satisfactory reproduc-
tion of an impressive photographic portrait of Sir HENRY,
but the queer caricatures of him by Mr. GORDON CRAIG seem
to be somewhat out of place.
A book entitled Tlie Recollections of an Eton Colleger
(SPOTTISWOODE & Co.) by C. H. M. (" M. or N. as the case niay
be"), though utterly lacking in humour and making no
pretension to literary merit, is calculated to interest Etonians
generally, but particularly the majority of them, who, having
been "Oppidans," i.e. residing in tutorial houses and not
in College, know very little, as a rule, of the routine of life
within the College wallp. Strictly speaking, only the Collegers,
or "Tugs," are genuine Etonians, as the Pious and Royal
Founder contemplated simply a Monastic College under the
rule of-"Learned Benedictines," and the idea of "Tutors"
and "Dames," with their profitable houses and pupils, never
occurred to him. The "Tug" life is in this book minutely
described by one who was "in it" from 1898 to 1902.
"Oppidan" existence is men-
tioned incidentally. The text
of the Eton Boating Song, which
has obtained popularity, but was
certainly unknown in the days
of Dr. KEATE, Dr. HAWTRY, Dr.
GOODFORD, and probably under
Dr. HORNBY, is given in full.
This book is worth adding to
any Etonian collection that al-
ready includes Recollections of
Eton (1870), About Some Fel-
lows, and Memories of Eton and
Etonians in Hie Forties.

IN their forecasts as to who would
fill the various offices under the new
Government, all the papers—and especi-
ally the Liberal ones, as an Irishman
points out—made one curious omission.
We refer to the Premier of Ireland (and
adjacent islands)—Mr. W. REDMOND.
We think that, when there was a
question of a change of Government,
Lord ROSEBERY was
quite right to keep
himself before the
public, but it is
questionable
whether he need
have adopted such
a drastic measure as
being thrown out
of a phaeton. He
might have hurt
himself.

"His Majesty's

we fancy, be averse

the treatment they
generally received
afloat was that of
Snubmarines.
Apparently regattas in Australia are
as dangerous as football matches in
America. TJie Melbourne Herald, a copy
of which has just reached us, informs
us that at the Henley-on-Yarra regatta
"the river was thickly covered with
pleasure boats, human hands, oil, steam
and electricity being the motive power
employed to drive the craft."

could be supplied
with a penny book
of arithmetical ta-
bles subject to the

tised, has, we hear, received no reply.
By-the-by, it is alleged that there is
an American millionaire behind The
Times. If this be true, it is a position
in which an American very seldom finds
himself.

Owing to the practice of throwing
stones at motor-cars, which has become
very common in Berlin, many cars are
now fitted with thin wire-netting to
protect the windows, and there is a
renewed outcry against those who inter-
fere with the simple pleasures of the
poor.
Snake-skin clothes are mentioned as a
novelty by a contemporary. As a matter
of fact they have been worn by snakes
for years.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS
[DECEMBER 5.]
Two spectacles to-day invite compare,
And each superb in its peculiar line:
One is at Smithfield, one in Belgrave Square,
At No. 29:
Here, the great C.-B., prime among his peers,
Is busy probing warriors for the battle;
And there, the connoisseurs of sheep and steers
Are progging fatted cattle.
May not a faint similitude be traced
In these two shows that fill the London stage?
Both exhibitions equally are graced
By Royal Patronage;
Each cast's a bit above its normal size—
Here swelling chests, and there a paunch distended,—
And some have got a first or second prize,
And'some are just "commended."
For me, I own I draw a larger mirth
From where the new-made Order ousts the old;
Oxen and swine may strain their tripled girth,
Yet leave my marrow cold;
But, where the all-green Home Ride banner waves,
And ROSEBERY'S Leaguers stand and blink thereunder,
I have to let off steam in joyous staves,
Or simply burst asunder.
Not for a decade have I felt so fat
With human joy; indeed there seems to be,
Judging by jocund brows, this side and that,
A general jubilee;
For these have pouched the booty, long their dream;
And those, that craved the sweets of Opposition,
May cross their legs and watch the other team
Work out its own perdition.
Give me, for two brief years—I ask no more—
Beneath the new regime to live and laugh,
And then, ere yet the thing becomes a bore,
To tag its epitaph;—
And I '11 not do as some ungenerous foes
That stamp to-day upon the dead or stone 'em,
But sing their virtues, letting silence close
On all that isn't bonum. 0. S.

NATURE STUDIES.
DECEMBER FAIRIES.
THE other day, being in search of a lost and long-forgotten
document, I came by chance upon a large and evidently an
ancient box, which appeared, from the dust that lay upon it,
to have passed many undisturbed years in the situation in
which I found it. It was not locked, and I opened it. I need
not make a list of all the frayed and musty and discoloured
objects, fragments of things that had had their use and given
pleasure long ago, which I discovered in it. But at last
there appeared a certain something which, as it were with a
shock and rattle, drew back the curtains of an old mystery
and brought up a memory in a flash of light. What the
Something was I shall say later. The memory I shall now
relate: —
It was evening, about six o'clock, I fancy,—at any rate it
was a good bit before bed-time, which in those remote days
was fixed at seven. We were on the ground floor in the
drawing-room, ROSAMOND, I and the baby. We were there
because in a few minutes we were going to look out of the
window and see fairies. We knew they were coming, because
Papa had had a letter to that effect, and had read it out
to us. Baby must have been two years old or a little more.
She was bobbing about amongst the chairs and tables and us
like a cork on the surface of the sea, never still for a moment.
She simply wouldn't be left behind when there was any
excitement —just insisted on going with us, and we had to
take her whether we liked it or not. Mamma came in and
said, "They '11 be here soon. When you hear a bell ring
you '11 know they 've come." Papa wasn't there; he never
was when the fairies were expected. He said they were very
shy and didn't like people who wore trousers. I thought
this was very hard on him, and had told him I was sorry
for him, but he said he must try to bear it. At any rate, he
wasn't there.
Suddenly the light went out in the drawing-room, and
ROSAMOND (whose age, I suppose, was four to my own five
and a half) began to whimper. She never at any time really
cried right out, but she stood still with her shoulders high
up, and twisted her hands together and untwisted them, and
her face seemed to crumple up into the queerest shape, and
in a moment she had a bucketful of water in each eye. This
was her way of crying. She was crying now, not because
she was afraid of fairies, but because she was convinced that
whenever it was dark in the drawing-room three ferocious
bears began to live in it. Somebody (it may have been I—
I suppose it must have been, because it certainly wasn't the
baby, who paid no attention to ROSAMOND, and it wasn't
Mamma, I 'm sure) somebody told her not to be silly—and
at that moment there was heard outside the tinkling sound of
a bell, and baby fell down over a footstool with a loud bang
and began to yell. She was picked up and soothed, and all
this time the bell tinkled away like mad, as if it was very
impatient. I can hear it still in my mind's ear: it sounded
rather like the silver bell Mamma used to ring in the dining-
room when she wanted JAMES to take our plates away. Any-
how, it was tinkling and tinkling, and at last Mamma drew
up a blind and we made a rush for the window. Baby fell
down again, but somebody picked her up and she got there
first, making an awful chatter.
When we looked out through the window on to the lawn
we saw— at least I saw, for ROSAMOND was still under the
influence of imaginary bears—a wonderful sight. Three
perfectly beautiful little fairies with lovely shining wings were
dancing upand down and round and round, and curtseying and
bobbing and flitting, and glancing and pirouetting as if they
wanted us to admire their skill and beauty. I wished to call
LIZZIE'S attention to them—LIZZIE was our nurse and didn't
really believe in fairies—but she wasn't there. Mamma said

she was upstairs, andjbaby fell down again. By the time we
hud picked her up the fairies had vanished—all except one,
who lay huddled on the ground. Somebody said, "Poor
thing, she's broken her wing," and somebody else said, " But
the fairy-doctor will mend it," and then the blind was drawn
down, and when we peeped through the chink a moment
afterwards the poor broken-winged fairy had vanished too.
ROSAMOND said, "I don't want them to come back," and baby
fell over the Dandie Dinmont dog, who yelped. At this
moment Papa came rushing in (the lights had been turned
up) and asked if he was too late, and I told him of course he
was. He seemed to be very greatly disappointed, and said
he never had any luck with fairies. There the memory
ended
Now what 1 had found in the old box was nothing very
rich or rare. It was this: on a layer of tattered nursery
books lay three little dolls dressed in linen and muslin that had
once been white. They were tied to a long piece of string,
and there was a knot where the string had been broken
between the first and second doll. 1 saw it all. Out of
sight of the darkened window Papa had held one end of the
string while LIZZIE held the other, and thus the fairies were:
made to bob and dance. Papa must have pulled too hard
and broken the string, so that two fairies disappeared, while
one fell down and remained lying. I wish I hadn't found
the dolls. I preferred the fairies, if only because ROSAMOND
lias always maintained that she never saw any. But
she caii't go on maintaining that in face of the dolls.

THE MEN THAT FOUGHT WITH DIZZY.
An echo of Mr. Kipling's "Men that foufjht at Minden."
THE men that fought with DIZZY, in the grand old Tory times,
And them that fought with SALISBURY yesterday,—
They didn't shirk the fight, for they held together tight,
And they learnt to play the game and to obey.
The men that fought with DIZZY, they were smartly disciplined,
And they had to lump the tilings they didn't like;
But they didn't effervesce in the columns of the Press,
And they didn't let the Party go on strike.
The men that fought with DIZZY, they were fanciful, maybe,
And some of them had funny little fads;
Rut they closed their ranks and cheered when the enemy
appeared,
And they left the petty squabbling to the Rads.
The men that fought with DIZ/Y, they had quarrels now and then,
But the\T dropped 'em when (hey heard the bugle blow;
And it wasn't then they sparred, for they hit uncommon hard
When they got to striking distance of the foe.
The men that fought with DIZZY, they were swift to realise
That a disunited force is always beat;
And that's the reason why, now Election times are nigh,
You must pet the good old Party on her feet.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW PROFESSION.
THE question of "What to do with
our sons" is one of those ever presen
conundrums, which can only be solvec
by time or Tlie Daily Telegraph. Doubt
less in the near future, the proprietors
oi that Journal will turn their attention
to this most pressing of problems; bu
until that fortunate hour arrives, parents
and guardians will still be faced with
the difficulty of providing suitable
careers for those committed to their
charge. Under these circumstances we
feel that it would not be out of place to
draw attention to the great advantages
attached to the vocation of a Champion
Wrestler. For an ambitious young man
of gentle birth, good appearance, anc
sound health, it would be difficult to fine
a more agreeable profession. The de-
mand for champion wrestlers is greatly
in excess of the supply; and the work
itself is healthy, honourable, and lucra-
tive. The most conclusive evidence can
be brought in support of these state-
ments.
To start with, there are more than
3,000 places of variety entertainment in
the United Kingdom, for each of which
the presence of an "Undefeated Cham-
pion of the World" is an absolute
necessity. It is roughly calculated that,
at the present time, there are not more
than fifty-six wrestlers who can lay claim
to the above distinction. That the work
is healthy is incontestibly proved by the
fact that scarcely one of these fifty-six
wrestlers has ever refused a challenge or
been defeated by an opponent, -which
speaks for the remarkable state of
physical perfection in which they must
invariably find themselves. A glance at
the police records for the last five years
will show that the honour of the pro-
fession is practically unstained; while a
salary of £300 a week is the usual
remuneration for a music-hall engage-
ment. To anyone doubting this last
assertion, we are willing to forward, free
of charge, a copy of Footlight Washes,
containing an interview with "a well-
known music-hall comedian." The above
statement was made by him to a repre-
sentative of that journal.
Under the supervision of Mr. ISAAC
ISAACSTEIS, " The Horrible Hebrew," late
Champion of the World, an Academy of
Wrestling Las recently been opened in
South Kensington, where, for the modest
outlay of a guinea a week, a young man
may be trained in every branch of the
profession. Two years' tuition is all that
is necessary for the creation of a fully
qualified champion of the world; and
an engagement is guaranteed to each
pupil who successfully survives that
period. The permanent staff of in-
structors includes tb e well-known ANTOXIO
CHUCKEMOFF, "The Awful Armenian,"
sixteen-stone champion of the world, and
his famous nephew, CONSTAOTINE CIIUCK-
EMOFF, "The Monstrous Macedonian,"
2 cwt. champion of the world. Novices
are under the special care of M. HESRI
BOULEVEJISEH, "The Frightful French-
man."
Special attention should be drawn to
the Literary Department, presided over
by Mr. CZECBORY PESTHELENSKI, "The
Brilliant Bohemian," who has been
engaged to give instructions in the diffi-
cult art of writing challenges, one of
the most important and onerous duties
in a professional wrestler's career. The
capacity to make a tasteful and dignified
speech at the successful conclusion of a
match being also more or less of a
necessity, permission has been secured
for all pupils to have free access to
the Strangers' Gallery whenever Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL is addressing the
House.
There is an excellent hospital and a
charming little graveyard in connection
with the Academy; all funerals being
carried out with luxury and elegance at
the expense of the management.

I HAVE my lady's head in wax,
A thing it is of wondrous glory,
No single point of her it lacks
Of all the thrilling inventory.
The full round cheeks of her are there,
The dimples in them slyly hinted,
Her high, smooth forehead, and her hair—
All modelled and superbly tinted.
[ have, of course, her photo, too,
But that is now unheeded lying—•
A photo gives but just one view,
And one view's scarcely satisfying.

The profile soothes my irritation.
The profile bores me? I recall
The living head's divine completeness,
\nd turn the face against the wall
To revel in the coiffure's neatness.
Then, if my passion should expire,
A photo has no use without it;
can but put it in the fire,
And when it's burnt forget about it.

And dabbed on deftly with a duster,
tVill give my meerschaum's golden brown
A wholly novel lease of lustre.

(By tlie author of " The Straphanger.")

I slide open six doors: two doors to
give entrance, two doors to give exit,
two doors to prevent a corridor-car being
a corridor-car.
I elide open six doors, I say, but if I
can possibly forget one or two, I do. I
believe in the Simple Life.
I do not doubt that I am overburdened
with sliding doors, nor that the cars
are overcrowded; in vain I try to think
how overcrowded.
I do not doubt that people will go
out by the entrance doors and come in
by the exit doors, nor that the strap-
hangers will oscillate.
I tell the people with first-class tickets
they may ride in a first-class car.
I tell the people with third-class
tickets they may not. They do, but I
tell them they may not.
I say to them, "First-class only in this
car," and they enter and sit down.
I do not doubt that one day they will
make a mistake and get into a third-
class car.
I am the door-slider.
I ring a bell, slide the doors and call
out the name of the next station as a
signal for the train to start. (The train
remains motionless.)
I fall over when the train does start,
the train that is so abrupt, so impulsive,
so sudden in its motions.
I do not tell by the stations when the
train will stop, for we frequently stop
in the tunnels. Often, I think, we are
not sure of the way, we hesitate so.
I tell when we shall stop by the
angle to which the passengers are
brought.
I do not doubt that when the passen-
gers are slewed violently forward the
train is beginning to stop.
I do not doubt tliat when the passen-
gers are slewed violently backward the
train has stopped stopping.
I do not doubt that a few will be
jerked off their feet. (The strapless
ones, I mean.)
I am tha door-slider, the bell-
ringer, the station-teller, the passenger-
packer.
(Mine is one car hi a million and a

I see the crowded, the crushed, the
jerked, the shamefully-mauled.
I see their measureless shame and
humiliation, their indignation and funic-
emitted anger.
I do not doubt that this sort of thing
cannot last, that a better system will be
organised, that somehow I shall obtain
more hands or fewer doors, the cars more
seats and fewer straps, the system more
honour and no less profit.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOME ACTING AND MUCH TALKING.
SUCH play-goers as may be interested in the artistic
progress of Mr. HCNTLET WRIGHT should take care to be at
the Comedy Theatre by 8.30 sharp in order to see an effective
and interesting "costume" piece, in one Act, by Messrs.
OsnouRKE and STRONG, entitled The Little Father of the
Wilderness. In this, as Pere Marlotte, a missionary, Mr.
HUNTI.EY WRIGHT shows himself a genuinely dramatic artist.
He plays without the slightest exaggeration, with a remark-
able absence of self-consciousness, and the naive simplicity
with which he invests the character, commands our tenderest
sympathy, and gives real dignity to the person of the humble
priest. It is a fine performance, but in it, and in the piece
itself, there is a glaring error which the authors should
never have perpetrated, and which it is marvellous that
so experienced a stage manager as Mr. DION BOUCICAULT
should ever for one minute have permitted. It is this. Here
are two poor simple, religious clerics, a missionary and a
Franciscan friar, summoned to Court; and in an ante-chamber
of the Palace at Versailles, these two, actually trembling at the
mere idea of their being about to be received in audience by
King Louis THE FIFTEENTH, suddenly, when alone, play at
pretending to be the King and Pere Marlotte, and rehearse
the scene twice over as they think it will be in reality! Both
in turn occupy the King's chair; both in turn enact the part of
his Majesty; the friar at one time representing Pere Marlotte.
This extravagant situation would be fatal to the serious
character of the piece, were it not that we hasten to forget
it on the arrival of the Court, and are assisted in doing so \
by the thoroughly good acting of Mr. GRAHAM BROWNE as the |
King, by Miss ADA WERSTER as Henriette, by the soldier-like j
bearing of Mr. CHARLES BRYANT as the Chevalier de Frontenae, <
and by the telling effect of the ensemble, admirably arranged
by stage-manager BOUCICAULT, that brings down the curtain i
to the heartiest applause. Certainly this is a piece to see,'
and it may be hoped that Mr. HDNTLEY WRIGHT will, at some I
future time, show us what he can do in comedy-dramas
of the kind that offered opportunities for the development!
of "Little ROBSON'S" eccentric genius. At all events, let j
him eschew such utterly nonsensical business as he gives us'
in The Mountain Climber, a three-Act farce that would not j
go for much were it not for the delightful humour of Miss
LOTTIE VENNE as the hero's wife, Mrs. Montague Sibsey.
Now fora matinee at The Court, where Mr. BERNARD SHAW'S
case comes on at 2.30 P.M. He describes it as " A Discussion."
As such we will take it. It is illustrated by living figures,
occasionally changing their attitudes, forming tableaux,
and listening with the greatest attention to whatever
harangue may be in progress, delivered by the principal
character, or occasionally joining in and taking part in
the conversational "discussion." Play it is not, nor was
it by Mr. SHAW ever intended to be, although he divides it
into "Acts and scenes." This would seem inconsistent, were
it not that such division'is equally applicable to a Session of
Parliament, accountable for its " acts," and memorable for such
"scenes" as may have taken place within the precincts of
the House.
Well, Major Barbara,—such is the title of the " discussion"
(which is "much ado about nothing,"—only not SHAXSPEAHE'B)
—consists of dialogue, without action, beginning brilliantly,
descending melodramatically, and finishing, not dully—it is
never that,—but fatiguingly; so that only a few, of those who
were evidently among Mr. SHAW'S most enthusiastic sup-
porters in that crowded audience, had sufficient energy left in
them to applaud at the fall of the curtain.
Mr. BERNARD SHAW, if he may be judged by this "dis-
cussion," is our English IBSEN, or more correctly, perhaps,
IBSEN Junior.
At this "IBSEN Junior" matinee, the female element in th
audience preponderated over the inferior sex by something
like twelve to one, but of course such an excess might be
expected during the business hours of the day " when men
must work "'and women may go to the play. But this audience
had not a theatre-going, but rather a lecture-going, sermon
loving appearance. It was difficult to tire them out, hu
they did become wearied: they forgave the extra half-hour
of weariness in the last scene of all, for the sake of the
inspiriting and sometimes even enlivening (for there is ultra
farce and burlesque too in this "discussion") episodes in
the preceding Acts.
Welcome indeed was the "comic relief" so cleverly given
by Mr. GRANVILLE BARKER as Adolphus Cusins, Greek Pro-
fessor and Fellow of some university, throughout the
I " discussion," and most gratefully was received his burlesque
performance on the Salvation Army's drum; while for his
energetic waving of the drumsticks everyone was distinctly
thankful. He contributed largely in successfully "curtain-
ing" the Second Act, and he lightened up the First Act
much as the old humbug Aminadab Sleek used to enliven
the seance in the First Act of TJie Serious Family, which
situation, by the way, Mr. SHAW'S "Discussive" Act I. will
forcibly recall to some experienced playgoers; while Miss
ROSINA FILIPPI'S clever representation of Larfi/ Britomart
Undershaft may remind them of the severe female head of
the family in the same piece. Then again, the entrance of
Andrew Undershaft, a character strongly contrasted with
everyone else of the dramatis persona, in its way resembles
the unexpected arrival of Captain Maguire, who contrives to
disarrange "The Serious Family " and finally sets everything
to rights.
Mr. Louis CALVERT as Andrew Undershaft deserves the
highest praise. As an actor he must have had to go to any
"lengths" in studying this prodigious part. When in MS.,
or in type, it must have inconveniently bulged out his
pocket, and how he got it all into his head is a marvel which
has probably surprised the actor himself. His performance is
artistically perfect. He has nothing to do, but a lot to say;
indeed, it may be doubted whether Puff, in the original version
of TJie Critic, has so much, and Hamlet himself cannot have
more. He talks when the "discussion" is practically over;
and actors and actresses have to remain, mumchance, on the
stage for about half an hour after all then- work is done, simply
(very simply) to listen to the pointless preaching of Andrew
Undershaft; and during his tedious discourse (or sermon)
they are allowed to throw in an occasional remark, which
just serves, as does a match to an expiring coal fire, to set
the preacher going again. Oh that this ability should lie
wasted on such interminability! Oh that this too, too solid
talk would melt, thaw, and dissolve itself in five minutes,
instead of weighing upon even the most Ibsenitish-Shawish
audience for an extra half-hour.
Miss ANNIE RUSSELL as Barbara, the protagonist, is simply
perfection. Mr. OSWALD YORKE gives us a life-like rendering
of Bill Walker, the low, bullying blackguard; and Snobby
Price, the sneaking hypocrite who gammons the Salvation
officers, is strikingly impersonated by Mr. ARTHUR LACEBY. Mr.
DAWSON MILWARD makes a most amusing character of Charles
Lomax, and this is "where the laugh comes in." In fact, all
who get the slightest chance do their very best to give this
"discussion" the semblance of a real play, and the VEDHEOTJE-
BARKER management is to be honestly congratulated on its
choice of accomplished actors, and on its possession of a stage-
manager, Mr. WILFRID FRANKS, who triumphs over the great
difficulty of keeping principals on the stage doing absolutely
nothing at all, veritably the "unemployed," merely "feed-
ing" the monologist so that he may start afresh, and go on
until even the author himself has got tired of him. N.B.—•
The " discussion" is now being given at the evening show.

JEAN AND JINE.
EI.IZA JIKE of Stepney, E.,
Taught in a school of the L.C.C.,
And in the self-same school as she
Was JEAN McCoRQuADALE from Dundee.
JEAN and JINE soon came to be
Friends and capital company.
Their cultured tastes were as like, you see,
As a couple of plums from the same plum tree.
They asked each other in to tea,
They worked together at rule of three,
They analysed Hamlet's speech "To be,"
And parsed each word of GRAY'S Elegy.
They nature-studied the household flea,
The French French bean and the sweet sweet pea,
And it goes without saying they held the key
Of ancient and modern philosophy,
For JINE said, "PLITO 's the man for me,"
But JEAN said, "HEGCEL maun bear the gree."
In short, it was clear that Stepney, E.,
Was hand in glove with fair Dundee.
Alas, that our joys should begin to flee
As the sum of our knowledge increases and we
With clearer vision begin to see!
It suddenly dawned on JINE that she,
Who spoke the purest of Stepney, E.,
Was catching the accent of vile Dundee:
While JEAN was alarmed, as she well might be,
Lest the beautiful flow of her pure Dundee
Should be fouled by the mixture of Stepney, E.
In a very short time, by Fate's decree,
Their love grew as cold as the Polar Sea.
Wken JEAN was invited by JIKE to tea
She much regretted she was not free,
As she had to analyse Annabel I*ee.
And when J INE was asked to a similar spree
She concocted an equally flimsy plea.
And now these two, though their tastes agree,
When they meet in the street or a B.T.T.,
Just stare at each other stonily:
And JEAN wishes JINE in the Zuyder Xeo,
And JINE that JEAN were in—well, Fiji;
For JINE is scared at the thought that she
Should catch the accent of vile Dundee,
While JEAN is alarmed, as she well may be,
At the prospect of talking like Stepney, E.

CHRISTMAS POSTAL GUIDE.
CHRISTMAS Day, as in last year, falls on
the 2f>th of the month, but letters and
parrels which are intended for delivery
in foreign countries or the colonies on
Christmas morning, should be posted
before that date.
Stamps for foreign countries are issued
at all Post Offices, and are very similar
to tlioFe used for Inland postage. They
arc now being supplied in perforated
sheets, and the prices will be found to
suit all purses, varying, of course,
according to the special design and
colouring desired.
Parcels and letter packets for abroad
should, if possible, be legibly addressed
on the oufsilc. This method, it has
been found, greatly reduces the labour
of the officials, and goes a long way
towards securing ultimate delivery.
Plum - puddings concealed in half-
penny newspapers cannot be accepted
for transmission at newspaper rates.
They may, however, be packed flat, and
sent by book post, if left open at each
end, or in an envelope which can be
easily opened for examination without
breaking the seal.
Turkeys must on no account be
dropped into the pillar-boxes. They
should be handed over the counter to an
agent of the Post Office, together with a
certificate of death, and they must con-
tain no printed or typewritten matter.
The following articles cannot in any
circumstances be accepted for trans-
mission by Parcels Post,—viz. Bombs,
Live Kails, Boa Constrictors, Naked
Lights, or Plays by Mr. G. BERNARD SHAW.
Parcels addressed" P. 0. till

within thirty-six days, will be sold to
defray expenses.

that he will not seek re-election.
It is rumoured that a Liberal M.P.

TO A DISUSED GROWLER.
[" A hundred years have now elapsed since the first public convey-
ance commenced to ply for hire in the streets of London."]
WHAT do you here, old friend,
Prone on the scrap-heap's comprehensive limbo,
With ribs all ghastly bare, and spokes akimbo?
Is this a fitting end
For you whose charms have held our hearts in thrall
Since 1805—one hundred years in all?
Oh, in those days of old,
With what a pomp and circumstance you joggled
Down Begent Street, and how the people boggled
At your incongruous mould:
Voicing an admiration past all bounds
With cries of "La now!" or (more tersely) "Zounds!"
And oh! with what a zest
The local youth essayed the pungent quip,
And when required to stow their blistering lip
Simply pursued the jest.
How blithe you bounded down the public way
With ne'er a constable to say you nay!
How well I seem to see
Some festive party pent in your inside!
The stout mamma, inflate with anxious pride,
Dressed to the nines—and he,
The prosperous cit, his whiskers all awry,
Quizzing the vulgar throng with nonchalant eye.
And sandwiched in between,
The buxom KATE, the stately JANE, and may be
Their aunt JEMIMA, and of course the baby,
And TOMMY, brushed and clean.
I might enlarge upon the theme, but I "ve
Mislaid the "atmosphere" of 1805.
Alas! for you are gone,
Capacious growler, and the panting steed,
Fleet in his prime, but slightly run to seed,
That drew you gently on,
Has passed to where the Brunswicker decoys
All flesh into his toothsome saveloys.
He was a gentle nag;
His master loved him though he called him names,
The children loved him too and called him JAMES.
He was besides a wag,
Spurning with ribald tail and well-bred grin
The strictures of the explosive fare within.
And what of that old bird,
Whose ill-kempt lid and pessimistic air
Concealed a thirst for twice his proper fare,
Whose virile utterance stirred
Qualms in the breasts of matron and of maid
Should he (with matchless eloquence) upbraid.
Say, is he still alive,
Who lately drove thee, and is he the same
Methuselah of whom the youths made game,
Early in 1805?
Had he, as local humorists maintain,
Observed a dozen decades wax and wane?
Alas! he's dead as you.
Yet 'twas not age cut short his fair young life,
But competition's all-pervading strife,
From which his soul withdrew.
"Dog's nose" and disappointment laid him low
At the ripe age of six score years or so.
The engines of offence
That roar and rumble down the busy street,
Noisy and odorous but passing fleet,
Hurt his artistic sense.
And so he left us, but his memory dear
Wrings from moist eyes the sympathetic tear.
Quaint vehicle, good bye.
You have no part in such a feverish age:
Time in the book of Progress turns a page,
And you are history!
New monsters petrol-driven roar and rave
A thunderous dirge above your restless grave.
GIFTS AND GIVERS.
(With acknowledgments to "Tlie Daily Express.")
THEitfTare signs on all hands that this Christmas, in the
matter of presents, will be remarkable chiefly for the intro-
duction of the '' personal note." Silver hot-water bottles with
jewelled screw-tops are warm favourites with smart women,
as gifts for their men friends. A few daring girls, it is said,
are even working spun-silk "Slumber Slippers" with dainty
clocks appliqued in ormolu.
Motor accessories make exceedingly useful presents, and
there is a great demand for artistic novelties in sparking-
plugs, differential casings, gear-boxes, radiators, ignition-
levers, &c. It is just as well, however, to find out if the
intended recipient is the possessor of a car before sending
any of the above, as if not they merely become "Accessories
before the fact."
For those who prefer their gifts to take the form of books,
there are this year ample opportunities. Everyone can be his
own CARNEGIE for a trifling sum. All you have to do is to
pay the preliminary half-crown, and a complete library of
sixteen handsome volumes—not to mention the inevitable
fumed-oak bookcase—will be delivered carriage paid to any
address. Your friend would be a churlish fellow indeed if
he resented having to pay the remaining monthly instalments
—but that is his affair!
Of course a certain amount of tact and discretion is
required in the selection of gifts.
For instance, to send your aged uncle (from whom you
have, perhaps, expectations) a copy of The Gollypug of What,
or Our Moo Cow Book, would savour almost of disrespect,
and again you would certainly get yourself disliked if you
presented your little four-year-old niece with MAHAFFY'S Pro-
gress of Hellenism in Alexander's Empire "—however taste-
fully bound. Remember also that Brazil is well supplied
with nuts (that being, in fact, the country whence they
come), and that ordinary coal is not now looked upon as a
novelty in Newcastle.
Do they do him P
(Extract from " Vanity Fair's " Navy Notes, December 7, 1905.)
"THE fact is that since the introduction of nucleus crews,
the three Lieutenants, the Marine Officer, and the Commander
lie in port with nothing to do in the afternoon, except the
Officer of the Day."
More Commercial Candour.
(From the Circular of a Leicester chocolate maker.)
"WE guarantee all our Chocolates freshly made and direct
from our factory. We solicit a trial and have no fear of
giving satisfaction."
No ALTERATION.—Up to last Friday it was expected, in
Holborn, that "Gray's Inn " would have to be changed to
"GREY 's Out."

MY DEAR ARTHUR,—I have just read
B. of B.'s speech at Glasgow, and hasten
to associate myself with its sentiments.
What he says about your penetrating
loyalty strikes me as peculiarly happy,
and I cordially agree witb him when he
says that you are the only possible
leader of the Conservative Party. I
cannot give a better proof of the genuine-
ness of these sentiments than by inform-
ing you that it is my intention at an
early date to appear on tbe same plat-
form with Hron CECIL and RITCHIK.
HITTIIIE, I admit, is rather hard to swal-
low, but at this Christmas season it is
! only right that one should practise a
! thorough-going altruism,
Ever cordially yours,
JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.

DEAR SIR HENRY,—You will, I am

thoughts the Nationalist Party have de-
cided to withdraw from the attitude
outlined at the Convention of the United
Irisb League. On further consideration
we have unanimously decided that it
would be most unfair to expect a Liberal
Administration, returned with a Free
Trade mandate, to bring in any sort of
Home Ride Bill. In evidence of my
friendly feelings I am venturing to send
you a Christmas present of a barrel of
Guinness's Stout and an Irish grammar.
Yours most sincerely,
JOHN REDMOND.

(From Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
to Mr. Winston Churchill.)
DEAR MR. CHURCHILL,- -I trust you will
see your way to join my Administration
as Secretary of State for War. It is
imperatively necessary that we should
keep a tight baud on KITCHENER, and
you are the only man to do it. Other-
wise I should have preferred to offer you
the Chancellorship of the Exchequer or
the Foreign Office. Perhaps, however,
you could manage to take all three?
Obediently yours,
HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN.

DEAR MR. COLERIDGE,—Peceavi! My
letter to the Neue Freie Presse was a
grand mistake; even worse was my
attempt to palliate my initial error by
throwing tbe blame on the German
translator. After all, we are both sound
on the question of vivisection, so I trust
you will let bygones be bygones, and
accept the enclosed order for a box at
the Court Theatre.

UN-COMMON-LAW PROCEDURE.
[" His HONOUR'S TEST.—The question whether
it was possible for a man to pick up his hat
without bending his knees arose in the Notting-
ham County Court. To test the matter the
judge made an experiment and was successful
in picking up his handkerchief from the floor
without bonding his knees. On a lawyer
suggesting that his Honour had not kept his
knees rigid the judge performed the feat again."
—Evening Standard.]
Before Mr. Justice DARINQ.
Mr. Skill, K.C. (an amateur acrobat
and counsel for plaintiff). This is an
action for personal injuries caused by
the plaintiff falling over a bucket on
defendant's staircase. It is agreed that
the only questions to be decided, are:
first, was the plaintiff guilty of
contributory negligence in
descending, three steps at a
time; secondly, is his present
inability to turn a back-somer-
sault evidence of his spine
having been injured as \ve
allege? The test in both ques-
tions is the ease with which
these feats can be performed
by a person in ordinary con-
dition.
The Judge. Was not the
first question settled in the
negative by my Brother Bi'CK-
JUMPER in Tripp v. Stumble?
(To the Usher) Get me Cliitty
on Frauds and Tricks.
Mr. Skill. Yes, in'lud, but in
deciding that case his lordship
broke his leg, and I do not
rely upon it.
The Judge. But was it not
followed in Croppers case?
Mr. Skill. No, m'lud; all
that that case decided was that
a person with his heels to a
wall is estopped from picking
up a coin from the ground.
The judge also demonstrated,
as a diclum, that, a person
whose left heel and cheek abut
upon a wall has no power to raise his
right leg. The cases, m'lud, are col-
lected on page 30 of Farwell on Powers.
Now, m'lud, here is a full-size model of
the staircase, and, as your ludship will
observe (mounting the stairs and jumping
doicn three steps at a time), nothing—
'Muld—be—simpl-—(slips and descends
to bottom with a run)— er—er—r— r-r-r-r!
Mr. Wily, K.C. (for defendant). I ask
your lordship to take a note of that.
Mr. Skill (rising and examining stairs).
Also, m'lud, of the fact that the twelfth
step has been greased.
The Judge. I will. Now for your
second point.
Mr. Skill. May it please your ludship.
(Stands on desk and executes a back-
somersault.') That is my case, m'lud.
(Loud and continued cheering.) I must
ask you to excuse me, Ladies and Gentle-
men, as I have a turn to do in the Appeal
Court in two minutes.
The Judge. Now, Mr. WILY.
Mr. Wily. M'lud, as to the first point
I simply rely on my friend's own demon-
stration. As to the second, I submit that
not one man in a thousand can turn a
somersault, and it was decided in Oeer-
anorer's case that a person's inability to
do so was not evidence of any physical
defect.
The Judge. I fancy that the judge in
Overanovers case only demonstrated that
point by way of an encore, which I am
not bound to follow, especially after Mr.
SKIIX'S express feat to the contrary.
However (rising and disroltitig) we '11 see.
which have emanated from the lips of
prominent public men in this country.
Perhaps the most impressive of all
these weighty observations was that
which Mr. BALFOUR is asserted to have
let fall last Saturday morning at the
close of a long conversation with his
Private Secretary. "If I am not mis-
taken," said the
"to-morrow will
outgoing Premier,
be Sunday." Mr.
SANDARS, a man of great perspicacity, is
understood to have signified his accept-
ance and endorsement of this momentous
proposition.
Hardly less striking in its grasp of
the essential facts of the situation is the
remark which is credibly attributed to
Mr.

SIMPLE SAYINGS FOR THE SILLY.
BAD AS IT IS TO BE FAWNED UPON, IT IS BETTER THAN TO BE BITTEN
CHAMBERLAIN on learning of Mr.
r BALFOUR'S resignation. With
an inimitable gesture the ex-
Colonial Secretary—so we are
assured by an informant whose
cousin married the niece of
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S coachman
-turned to his son and said,
"Well, well. We shall see
what we shall see."
Mr. HENRY CHAPLIN, as is
well known, has a great repu-
tation for concise and epigram-
matic comment. But he has
seldom equalled and never
surpassed the felicitous phrase
in which he summed up the
true inwardness of the present
crisis. "If only, as I have
every reason to hope and
believe, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN ulti-
mately succeeds in convincing
the entire electorate of the
necessity of his policy, the
success of Tariff Reform will
be virtually assured."
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, who
inherits the gift of trenchant
speech from his father, Lord
RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, is alleged
to have created a profound
impression at a recent meeting
Manchester by observing,
(To the Usher) Hold my wig a moment. I in tones charged with emotional inten-
\Essays a back-somersault and
carried out of court insensible.
(Twenty minu'es later.)
The Associate (speaking with much
emotion). His lordship's last words were,
"Judgment for the defendant, with costs
on the higher scale."
ILLUSTRIOUS INANITIES.
[" The Emperor of RUSSIA is reported to have
said to Count WITTE: 'We are living in stirring
times.' "—" Daily News," December 7.]
THE utterance of soul-shaking verities
is not the monopoly of Continental
potentates. By means of inquiries con-
ducted in a variety of quarters, Mr. Punch
has been enabled to glean a goodly crop
of wise, pregnant, and caustic sayings
eity, "We are on the eve, I may
say we are on the brink, of a General
Election."
Lord CURZON, whose speedy return to
the arena of active politics is confidently
expected by his numerous readers, sig-
nalised his arrival in England by an
observation teeming with transcendent
significance. A few days after reach-
ing London he was walking down Pall
Mall when he chanced to meet an old
acquaintance. We have itonthe authority
of the crossing-sweeper in Waterloo
Place, who witnessed the rencontre,
that Lord CURZON
hesitation greeted
without a moment's
his friend with the
poignant cri de-coeur, " Well, I suppose
there's no place like home, as the
saying is."

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
WHERE did Mr. WELLS acquire the intimate acquaintance
with life behind the counter in a draper's shop graphically
portrayed in Kipps (MACMILLAN)? There is something about
it recalling the intensity of CHARLES DICKENS'S narrative of
boyhood's days in the blacking factory that suggests it is
autobiographical. The story of Kipps's schooldays ia also
so vivid that my Baronite is constrained to the belief that
Cavendish Academy, its principal, and the young gentlemen
educated by him, in some modified form actually existed.
It is not alone in respect of suspicion of incorporating auto-
biography with fiction that the author of Kipps makes one
think of the author of David Copperfield. DICKENS has found
innumerable imitators, successful chiefly in producing echoes
of his more boisterous manner. Whilst free from imitative
effort, Mr. WEIXS has much of that humour, high spirits and
daring fancy that, exercised by the Great Master, still delight
mankind. Kipps himself, an illiterate youth, to whom there
unexpectedly comes a legacy of "twelve fousand pounds,"
is a character so skilfully drawn through varying circum-
stances that he is never inconsistent with his introduction as
"a simple soul." Mr. Chester Cooie is excellent, and so, in quite
another way, is (Jhitterl&w the dramatist, who at length turns up
trumps and makes lavish return to Kipps for a loan bestowed
in darker days. The story rattles along with unfailing vigour,
taking unexpected turns that maintain interest to the last.
Maitland Major and Minor (HEINEMAXN), by CHARLES TURLEY.
Boys, if you wish to let your fathers know
The path in which a parent ought to go;
Parents, if you would give your growing boys
Something to crown all other Christmas joys;
Masters, if you would learn unwritten rules
Touching the etiquette of private schools;
And, General Public, would you ease your brain
And for one careless day be young again ;—
To each and all of you I say, "Go early
And buy the latest tome by Mr. TURLEY."
This is no amateur: there's not a doubt
He knows his tricky subject inside out;
Here is no maudlin tale (it's much too big)
Of virtue championed by the hero-prig;
The boy who tells it, on his proper hook,
Talks like a boy and never like a book;
Nor lets his humour range one little bit
Beyond the natural bounds of boyish wit;
1 've seldom sampled better -stun1 or saner,
So says the Baron's Nautical Retainer.
In The Art of Portrait Painting (CASSELL) the Hon. JOHN
COLLIER has made one of those incursions into the sister-
kingdom of literature so dear to the heart of an artist. He
justifies a rather ambitious title by including a learned,
brightly-written, and discriminating survey of the work of
the great portrait-painters written some years ago. Some of
his opinions make one lift one's eyebrows, as for instance
where he ascribes the fading of a Leonardo da Vinci portrait
to "his pernicious habit of glazing thinly over a preparation
in monochrome." The illustrations are in most cases well-
chosen and well-printed. Some of those printed in colour,
notably the MILLAIS portrait of "Miss Tennant" and ORCHARD-
SON'S " Viscount Peel," are as near perfection as possible. Each
of them is well worth the price of the whole volume, and the
"Lord Peel" should be possessed by every Parliamentarian.
The book contains most valuable hints for the art student.
There are two delightful little kittens on the first page of
Pussy's Mixture (E. NISTER); but the very best illustration
of all, and we haven't seen one with more real go in it for some
time, is on the tide page at the very commencement of the book.
Don't miss it. It's " The Cat and the Fiddle." The Postcard
Book from same firm is a novel idea. Dainty are Pansies for
Thoughts and Forget-me-nots for Remembrance.
In a handy volume Mr. SEYMODR LLOYD writes about
Elections, and How to Fight Them (VACHER). The book comes
out opportunely when the country is on the eve of what
promises to be a historic struggle at the poll. In chatty
manner, lucid phrase, Mr. LLOYD gives practical hints relating
to the preliminaries of the struggle. Almost everything a
candidate should know with respect to the business in which
he is embarked, is here set forth. The Appendix contains a
summary of the sections hidden away in the Corrupt Practices
Acts relating to the conduct and management of elections.
Having learned all this handy book tells him, the honest
candidate can go ahead, none daring to make him afraid.
Since Alice wandered through Wonderland no such pretty
fairy tale has been written as Lady RIDLEY presents in the
Sparroio irith the White Feather (SMITH, ELDER). The sparrow,
grateful for kindness received in early youth, conducts little
Jean to Fairyland, leaving her at the entrance to the glow-
worm-lit tunnel that leads to the demesne, for it appears nor
sparrows nor other birds are permitted to enter. What Jean
sees and hears is narrated in fashion of fascinating simplicity.
The book, which is illustrated by Mrs. ADRIAN HOPE, is
primarily designed for children. My Baronite testifies it
may be read with delight by grown-ups.
Virtue is its own reward. This one work, The Art Journal
for 1905, is VIRTUE (& Co.)'s own reward for the continued
success of the series founded in 1839. It is a handsome
volume, and some handsome people in it too, commencing
with a delightful portrait of "MARY" (evidently the MARY of
"MARY MARY, Quite Contrairy," which will strike you at once,
as would she, if when she were alive you examined her face
too closely) sent by Mr. JOHN LA VERY to the Autumn Salon
in Paris. Then look at JOHN TAYLOR'S portrait of Joan
Nixon, very witchlike, book in hand, and peaked hat on
head. No relation presumably to the "Red-faced Nixon"
mentioned by Sam Welter. The picture is delightful. In
the literary accompaniment to this volume there are most
interesting articles, long and short, by SIDNEY COLVIN, CLAUDE
PHILLIPS, A. G. WEBSTER, PAUL WATERHOUSE, and others.
Brief as this notice must necessarily be, neither the
delicate reproduction of THEODORE ROUSSEAU'S Foret de
Fontainebleau, nor the delightful "Gossips" of SYLVIUS D.
PAOLETTI, must be omitted from our general laudation.
The Face of Juliet, by L. T. MEADE (JOHN LONG). Would
not the impressionable Romeo have been bothered entirelv
had Juliet possessed a twin sister! He would have sung, con
amore, "How happy could I be with either, Were t'other
dear charmer away!' The reader of this novel will appre-
ciate the applicability of this familiar quotation. But further
than this the Baron, who knows
the secret, may not go. He
strongly advises his friends and
followers to look into The Face
of Juliet, and to hold it before
their eyes until they shall have
learnt what Juliet's mother has
to impart. The story is well
and clearly told, the scenes
are dramatic, the descriptions
graphic, and there is not a
page that would warrant call-
ing in the aid of a professional
skipper.

LEST YOU REMEMBER.
[To be sung in recitative by Tory vxilts outside the banqueting-hall
of tlie New Ministry.]
Now sit ye close about the festal board,
And of the turkey's stuffing take your share;
Let every face with absolute accord
Glow in the spicy pudding's brandied flare,
And each his hand apply
And seize a plum and say, "How good a boy am I!"
Now, while your jesters fling their final sneer
At captive warriors and a broken cause,
And scarce acknowledge, save with burning ear,
The gallant foeman's chivalrous applause—
Upstand on all your legs
And drain a Liberal bumper, drain it to the dregs!
Drink to the hour that is, and shout Waes hael!
And let no man' too curiously forecast
The doubtful vista hid behind the veil,
Nor draw its safety-curtain from the past,
Lest haply he should jog
Thoughts that are best left lying like a dormant dog.
Lest you remember how your victory came,
How battlements that long defied your wit
Fell not by patient siege, or sword and flame,
But owing to a sad internal split;
So were the gates flung wide,
And you were asked if you would kindly step inside.
Lest you remember certain awkward facts
Let drop in many a too-expansive speech,—
Jmmutable committals, solemn pacts,
Private and contradictory each to each;
And how on every pledge
This clique or that will ultimately have to hedge.
Here's one that's sworn to run at REDMOND'S heel,
And there another, bound by equal oaths
To have no hand in any Home Rule deal,
Or wink at what his loyal nature loathes;
Surely between these two
I may detect a slight divergency of view?
Here's one again that marks with angered eyes
"Our Chinese brothers " wearing "slavery's brand,"
Or takes an all-black attitude and cries
"Whip me yon yellow devils off the Rand!"
While others disagree,
Saying, "They 're neither slaves nor devils; let 'em be!"
This type's a King's man; that's a frank pro-Boer;
And some are Liberals born, and others made
Such by desertion. • Here's a Scot's claymore
Tlmt has lit'.lrencliment chiselled on the blade,
While BURNS (of England) gloats
Over the damnable expense of paddle-boats.
Therefore, lest you remember facts like these,
Feast while you may, and take a cheerful tone;
Soon you will sit not quite so much at ease,
Eating your winged words, each man his own,—
Tough fowls that you have loosed,
Which have a horrid knack of coming home to roost.

THE SORROWS OF GENIUS.
BY A-DR-W C-RN-G-E.
[Dedicated to Miss MARIE CORCI.LI, author of an article on "The
Sorrows of a Millionaire," in The Daily Mail.]
THERE are some people in this world who actually envy
men, and even women of literary genius. I wonder why?
How can anyone possessed of a modest competence, with a
seat in a Free Library, and entertaining sound democratic
sentiments, envy the merely "talented " man, or woman?
To me the genius, especially the romantic genius, is an
object of sincere compassion. His popularity is a perpetual
incentive to pot-boiling. He is the slave of fashion. He is
at the mercy of unscrupulous critics, reviewers, and ink-
slingers, of vulgar lion- and lioness-hunters, photographic
friends, interviewers and paragraph-mongers. He (or she)
cannot rely upon friendship, for he (or she) always suspects
friends of ulterior designs—generally matrimonial. Indeed
I know of one extraordinarily gifted authoress who receives
on an average 500 offers of marriage in the week, and is
still unmarried from the litter impossibility of choosing out
of this bewildering ertibarras de richeszcs.
Again, the literary celebrity, pursued by the unrelenting
purveyors of personal details, cannot escape the devastating
penalties of success. Isolation, privacy, and repose are
impossible. She (if he be a she) is forced by the obligations
of greatness to live in the limelight of publicity, to enter the
controversial lists at the shortest notice, and fight to the
death with rival authors; to champion the fame of the
mighty authors of the past against the insidious attacks of
acid pedants and pedagogues, unprincipled town councillors
and greedy jerry-builders. Then there is the ceaseless strain
of bearing aloft the banner of the Simple Life against the
combined forces of Mammon and Gastronomy—against the
delirious devotees of the gold craze and the porcine worship-
pers of appetite. It is a terrible responsibility, and there is
no respite or relief in the struggle. Genius is ever the
victim of jealousy, misrepresentation, and spite, ever bound
to be on guard against the onslaughts of brutal and in-
sufferable millionaires.
Again, the rewards of genius, though appreciably larger
than in previous epochs, are still pitifully insignificant along-
side of the accumulations of the magnates of the mercantile
world. I am afraid that MILTON, if he were to revisit the
world, would be quite unable to dine night after night at the
Carlton, and that SUAKSPEAHE, if he were now residing at
Stratford-on-Avon, would not find himself in a position to
keep a reliable motor-car or to entertain Mr. SIDNEY LEE and
Miss CORELLI in a manner worthy of his guests. Of course
there are exceptions, and Greeba easily outshines Skibo.
But the rule remains—the lot of genius is hard and toilsome.
To quote from a personal experience, I once went to a
musical reception at the house of a certain latterday Mrs. Leo
Hunter. The greatest living woman of letters had entered
just before me, and was met on the stairs by a lady inter-
viewer, who greeted her with a suave yet sinister grin. "So
glad to meet you here!" she said. "Mrs. Z gives most
delightful parties! And she has so much influence,—ahe
will speak of your books to BO many people." That was
quite enough for the affronted genius. Promptly realising
the view taken of what she had thought to be merely a
courteous response to a friendly invitation, she quickly
slipped away from the festive scene, and never darkened the
doors of that "influential" house again with her dainty,
ethereal shadow. Too proud, you will say? Oh, no! But
proud enough to hold the profession of literature as too
high for the "patronage" of any lesser power than the
universal Public. '''

PUNCH, OB THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
THE FINAL STAVE OF "A CHRISTMAS CAROL."
(With profound apologies to the Genius of Charles Dickens.)
STAVE FIVE.
SCROOGE was certainly under the impression, on going to
bed after returning from that wonderful Christmas party at
his nephew's, that he would not be required to have any
further intercourse with Spirits, and would live henceforth
on the Total Abstinence Principle.
But in this he was mistaken. There was no doubt about
that. For barely, or so it seemed to him, had he laid his
head on his pillow, when the curtains of his bed were once
more drawn aside by a spectral hand.
However, on this occasion, he felt no solemn dread. Not
a bit of it! On the contrary, he skipped out of bed as lively
as a sandboy—or rather several
dozen sandboys, every one of
them endowed with preter-
natural agility.
"I know what you 're here
for," he chuckled. "Come to
take me out to some more,
Christmas Parties, eh? All
right, I 'm ready for you. I
feel equal to facing any num-
ber of them now!"
"I am the Ghost of Christ-
mas more than sixty years to
come," announced the Spirit
in sepulchral tones.
"My dear Sir," said SCROOGE
heartily, " delighted to see you
—de-lighted! Thank'ee. Let
us be off at once. Do we go
out of the window, or through
the wall, this time? Which-
ever it is, Spirit, lead on,
and I shall be most happy
to follow you anywhere you
like!"
fr " Touch my robe!"
SCROOGE did as he was told,
and held it fast. The city
had entirely vanished; they
stood upon an open country
road, before some tall wrought-
iron gates, flanked by pillars,
upon which a pair of heraldic
griffins ramped—but amiably,
as if even their stone hearts were softened somewhat by the
influence of the Season. Through these gates they passed,
and up a stately avenue to the portico of a noble mansion.
"One of the country seats of Lord BREDANBOURNE," the
Ghost explained.
"But why bring me to such a place, Spirit?" asked
SCROOGE, feeling slightly puzzled. "For really I can't recollect
ever to have heard of his lordship."
"Have you so soon forgotten your fellow 'prentice, DICK
WILKINS?" inquired the Spirit. "He married, as you are
doubtless aware, the eldest Miss FEZZIWIG, and died Sir
RICHARD WILKINS, having been knighted during his Lord
Mayoralty by His Gracious Majesty, King WILLIAM THE
FOURTH."
"So he was," cried SCROOGE. "Bless his heart! So he
was! Dear, dear! And yet, even now, I don't quite"
"His son, GABRIEL," pursued the Phantom (who, by the
way, was less reserved than any of its forerunners) " developed
the warehousing connection of the firm of FEZZIWIG & WILKINS
to such a prodigious extent that Lhe eventually became a

Baronet. The second Baronet, Sir PEVERIL, in return for
important services rendered to his party, was raised to the
Peerage under the title of Baron BKEDAOTOURNE."
"Bless my soul!" exclaimed SCROOGE, rather impressed,
"what services, Spirit?"
But the Phantom answered not. It is very possible that it
did not know.
"The Lord BREDANBOURNE of the period we are now in," it
continued, "does nothing whatever but enjoy himself. He is
at this particular moment entertaining a houseful of the
smartest people in London for Christmas week."
"Is he, though?" cried SCROOGE, rubbing his hands with
the delight of a boy. "What a feast he must be giving them,
eh, Spirit? What a capital Turkey! What a wonderful
Pudding! What bowls of seething Bishop! What pyramids
of oranges and piles of chestnuts! Do let us go inside and
look on, Spirit! Just for an
hour or so!"
"I fancy they will have
finished feasting by this time,"
said the Spirit. "We shall
probably find them all in the
Long Drawing - room, play-
ing—
"'Forfeits, I'11 be bound!"
said SCROOGE, eagerly. "Oh,
I must go in, and see the fun!
Make haste, Spirit, make
haste! Hallo here! Whoop!"
Unseen by any there, they
entered that lofty and splendid
room—but scarce had they
done so, ere SCROOGE'S heart
grow strangely chill within
him.
The walls were decked with
Christmas here and there, but
yet resounded to no echoing
ring of joyous Christmas
laughter. SCROOGE noted next
that all these guests who sat,
in groups of four, at little
tables were so deep engrossed
in studying the cards that fell
—in such a solemn silence,
too !—that they were blind
and deaf to aught besides,
unheeding holly — aye, and
mistletoe! From time to
time a hollow voice would
cry, "I leave it!" Or one would quit his seat and wander
around, like some uneasy soul that finds no rest, and then
return, as powerless to resist the spell for long! Young
girls there were, who, risking stakes that they could ill
afford, doubled "No trumps," and paled as Dummy's hand,
displayed, revealed the guarded King that doomed them to
inevitable disaster!
"I suppose, Spirit," said SCROOGE, "they'll have in the
fiddles and begin to en joy themselves presently, eh? They
can't keep up this sort of thing much longer! can they?"
"They are enjoying themselves," replied the Phantom.
"And they will keep it up till one or two in the morning, at
least."
"Then I don't wish to see any more," said SCROOGE.
"Remove me, Spirit. Let me see my dear nephew's
descendants keeping up this Festival in the time-honoured
fashion with 'How, when, and where," and "Blind-man's
buff."
Back to the town the Spirit led him next, and to a fine
house in a terrace hard by the spot where Tyburn Tree once

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
bore its ghastly fruit. There might have been a dozen people,
old and young, in the solidly furnished drawing-room
SCROOGE and the Spirit visited next—but not one among them
all was engaged in blind-man's buff! He saw the same small
tables, with similar unsmiling parties of four seated at each—
the very silence might have been the same! In one group
SCROOGE particularly noticed a grim hatchet-faced elderly
gentleman who somehow rather reminded him of his former
self. "Your great - nephew, Mr. Justice MEHRYWE,\THER,"
explained the Phantom; "he is more learned, though perhaps
slightly less genial, than his Early-Victorian father. That pallid
young gentleman whose play he is just criticising with such
refreshing candour is his great-nephew by marriage, young
TOPPER, who has lately been called to the Bar, and has a case
—his first brief—coming on in his relative's court early next
Hilary term. He has just remembered that circumstance."
"Spirit, show me no more!" entreated SCROOGE, "I cannot
bear it. In mercy's name take me from this hideous travesty
of Christmas cheer to some humbler home, where all the dear
old customs are not quite forgot! Let
us drop in upon the descendants of
my worthy clerk, Bon CRATCIIIT! For
I tell you plainly, unless I smell
roast goose and hot punch, and hear
a toast proposed, if not a song, within
the next few minutes, I have a feeling
that I might relapse into the man
that I was wont to be!"
The Phantom inclined its head
. . . . Their way led them past a
row of spacious shops, above which
SCROOGE could read, in bold and glit-
tering letters, the words, "Cratchit's
Cash Stores, Limited."
"Yes," remarked the Spirit airily,
"the CRATCIIITS have got on, too. The
business is vastly improved since old
PETER CRATCHIT first founded it in
the early sixties. . . . No, the present
people don't live over the shop; they
occupy a villa residence called ' Chats-
worth,' in a new but highly select
suburb, where they are known as the
'DE CRESPIGNY-CRATCHITS.'"
To this suburb they repaired.
But, as SCROOGE passed through the
stained-glass portal, his nostrils were
not greeted by the savour for which he hungered, Mrs.
DE CRESPIGNY-CRATCHIT being much too refined a woman to
allow a roast goose to appear at her table, whether with or
without such ungenteel appurtenances as sage and onions.
The party he found in the "Art" Drawing-room to the
right of the hall were all in the most correct evening costume,
and far too fashionable to be festive. They passed no punch
around, proposed no toasts, nor sang a single song. On the
contrary, they were engaged in precisely the same occupation
as were the two parties at which SCROOGE had previously
assisted.
"Spirit, I can't stand it!" cried SCROOGE. "In Heaven's
name, what is this fell pursuit that, in the space of sixty-odd
short years, will banish harmless mirth and jollity from every
hearth alike?" "They will call it' Bridge,' " the Spirit
answered.
"Ghost of the Future," cried SCROOGE, quite agonised, "I
fear you more than any Spectre I have seen! You seem to
delight to torture me! If there is any respectable home in
the town on which this fearful blight has not yet fallen, show
that home to me, Spirit, I beseech you!"
"I cannot do so," was the Phantom's sorrowful reply, "for
I know pf none!"

"Then, for the love of Pity," SCROOGE implored it, " conduct
me back to bed—and let me wake, to feel all this is but a
dreadful dream!"
This time his prayer was granted. . . . He positively frisked
out of bed next morning. "Why, bless me, it's Boxing Day!"
he shouted. "What ridiculous nonsense I 've been dreaming!
Christmas blighted, indeed! And by a thing called 'Bridge,'
too! Pooh!! Stuff!!! That punch at my nephew's last
night must have been stronger than I fancied!" F. A.
SCENT PER SCENT.
A TERRIBLE danger threatens the noble and national sport
of Fox-hunting; a danger hitherto unseen, or perhaps we
should say unsmelt. And yet how heedlessly we have
ridden in its very midst, reeking—we mean recking—nought
of the potent evil lurking among us. Then, suddenly, forth
bursts the warning in the daily Press. Hark to the prophet
of 27(e Daily Teletjraph. In solemn type that cannot lie he
tells of "the mischief caused—parti-
cularly ichen a cast is being made
doim-wind of the field—by an atmos-
phere laden with the scent of countless
fragrant cigars, and with the varied
pungent perfumes emanating (delicate
word) from many feminine handker-
chiefs." Here, then, is the deadly
secret.
Masters, who mop your puzzled
brows when the keenest nose in the
kennel scours the plain in vain —
huntsmen, whose commentaries, not
loud but deep, have blanched the
cheeks of youthful second whips,
when your most cunning casts went
unrewarded—know, suffering souls,
that all the mischief lies in baccy
and bouquet.
What can be done? The strongest
varmint fox is whifHess among such
redolent rivals. Even the good red
herring, the prey of the furious fish-
dogs, must pale his ineffectual fumes
before these powers of stamped box
and stoppered bottle; he is not worth
a red scent.
Alas! what disaster do we see be-
fore us! Each hound, in time, will run a particular label,
and refuse all imitations. By natural selection the lady
hounds will speak to the dainty perfumes of the mouchoircttes,
whilst the sterner sex will give tongue to the rank and vile of
the cigar brigade. Then, as the peculiar pendiant of each of
the pack becomes known to their keen-nosed huntsman, every
hound, to save confusion, will of course be named after his or
her favourite smoke or smell.
Mournful, indeed, to those who have loved the accustomed
sounds of the chase (especially if non-smokers) will be the day
when our woodlands echo to the cry of " Tally-ho, Bock!" or
"Have-a-care, Borneodoro!" A crack of the whip and a
"Gently, Jockey-Club," to some eager queen of the kennel will
at first fall strangely on the ear, whilst a cheery " Hark to Eau-
de-Cologne "answers a: well-known note in the whins, proclaim-
ing that the unerring nose has winded its own triple-extract.
And when, at some future revelry by night, the sounds of
music rend the odorous air, shall we recognise an old, old
tune through these balmy words?
"Yes, I ken Henry Clay, and Auld Reekie too,
Ranker, ' Rose Royule,' and Smellinan BO true;
From tie fag to the case, from the case to the 'phew!'
From the 'phew!' to the ash in the morning."

NATURE STUDIES.
CHRISTMAS BIRDS.
THERE is a great gathering of birds every morning now in
the bare trees and bushes close to the house, for they know
that as soon as breakfast is over some one will step out either
from the front door or from one of the French windows on
the other side of the house and scatter crumbs for them.
The uncertainty as to the spot •at which the ceremony wil]
take place keeps them in a fine flutter. I can imagine the
sparrows (who, if all accounts may be trusted, have all the
vices of men with some particular feathered wickednesses in
addition) laying the odds to the solemn rooks or the fancy-
waistcoated thrushes with a shrill "Six to four the front-
drive!" or "Two to one the back-lawn," and being occa-
sionally taken, let us say, in bread-crumbs or fragments of
toast, while the robins, those dainty bird-aristocrats, hop
about in disdainful aloofness from the busy throng of little
chatterers. At last, however, when the suspense is becoming
almost too great for chirps, the door (or, it may be, the
window) opens, and out steps the little fair-haired distributer
of largess. Then what a fluster there is to be in good time.
The air is alive with excited wings, and all the twigs of
vantage become thick with birds. They are, however, too
cautious to descend to the ground until the scattering is
finished and the human being removes herself within the house.
In London streets, where the traffic is frequent and the
pedestrians innumerable, you will see the sparrows, grown
contemptuous with a long familiarity, hardly deign to hop
aside when a horse or a man comes upon them; but here in
the country their native wildncss still maintains itself, and it
is difficult to coax them to leave their brandies until you have
withdrawn yourself from their gaze. But when once that is
done they waste no time. Down come the sparrows in their
swarms, impudent companies of sturdy little fighters, each
one intent both on filling his own gullet and preventing his
companion from getting his or her fair share. There is no
nonsense of gallantry about a sparrow. If he sees a tiny hen
of his breed struggling with a crust of bread as large as her
body he is down upon her in a moment, thrusts her furiously
aside, lifts the crust in his beak, rises with it (an incredible
feat) in the air, and abandons his prey only when three other
sparrow-raiders pounce upon him and dispossess him.
In the meantime there lias come an incursion of starlings.
They arrive with an extraordinary bustle and quickness,
determined not to be too late for the feast, and at once begin
waddling swiftly to the best bits, their funny bob-tailed
bodies simply quivering with excitement. They make no bones
at all about shouldering the sparrows aside, and the quarrel-
some little fellows seem to respect their size and their gluttony,
though I doubt not they make many a sarcastic remark about
their awkward gait, so different from the sparrow's graceful
rhythmical hop. Two or three blackbirds, gaudy with their
yellow bills, and a few thrushes add themselves to the
meeting, and here and there a stray robin pecks with dignity
on the outskirts. A gentler looking, softer bird than the
robin does not fly, but you should see the little beggar when
a sparrow really gets in his way. With a rush as swift as
the flight of an arrow he scatters the enemy and secures what
he wants. If I were a sparrow I should certainly keep my
distance from a robin, and guard myself against being betrayed
by his blushing breast and his liquid eye into any false
notions about his fighting quality.
During all this time three gigantic rooks—gigantic, that is
to say, by comparison with the industrious swarm of little
birds below—have been perched in observation on the tops of
some young poplars. You would think that a bird so black
and so portentously beaked could not help being brave, but
he certainly is not. On the contrary he is as timid as a fawn,
and it is a ludicrous sight to watch him trying to make up
his mind for a swoop on a tempting crust, half letting go of
his perch, then convulsively clutching and flapping himself
back again into security, looking nervously to right and left,
and then at last deciding on the dreadful venture and
launching himself downward. He too is a waddler, more
ungainly than the starling, since there ia more of him to
waddle, and he has an absurd false air of dignity and daunt-
lessness as he stalks at his selected crust, seizes it, and makes
off with it to his tree. None of the little birds pays the least
attention to him. He is a wasteful mischievous bird, but I
can't help pitying him, for his looks belie him so largely, and
he is obviously so greatly terrified of men.
The gardener shakes his head over the daily bird-feast, and
prophesies that we shall have no fruit next year if the thieves
are thus encouraged; but he prophesied the same gloomy
things last year and many years before, and in spite of his
warnings we have not done so badly. At any rate I cannot
find it in my heart to refuse my surplus crumbs to these
merry, comfortable little folk. A garden without birds would
be sadder than a garden without fruit—but on this point I
cannot hope that the gardener will agree with me.

My DEAR CURZON,—I am extremely sorry that I was una-
voidably prevented from going to Charing Cross to welcome
you on your return to London, though I need hardly add
that I was better employed elsewhere. But it has always
been a rule with me never to allow personal predilections to
interfere with the discharge of public duty, and I had a
long-standing engagement to open a Primrose League Bazaar
on the same day. The news of the collapse of the station
roof next day gave me quite a shock. Just think what it
would have meant for the Empire if it had happened twenty-
four hours earlier and I had been thore! However, all's

DEAR SIR,—It is at once my privilege and duty to inform
you that it is the intention of the KING to confer upon you
the honour of a dukedom in recognition of the services which,
you have rendered the country in connection with dietetic
reform amongst the governing classes. Malnutrition is at
the root of the physical deterioration of the nation, but none
of those who frequent the splendid establishments of which
you are the presiding genius has ever complained of being
inadequately nourished. You will, I trust, allow me to con-
gratulate you on your well-deserved honour, and to felicitate
the House of Lords on a recruit whose aim has always been
to reconcile parties on the common platform of gastronomy.

His progress with a cart;

Manage the thing in a bolder style—
Move in a motor-car.
Then, chauffeur, go, and to and fro
Your frequent course begin;
You need not wait for straw and crate
To pack my'chattels in.

Shove them in anyhow!

If peelers take your name,
It sliall be mine to pay the fine,
And bear the public shame.
Things at the bottom no doubt may
break;
Those at the top may fall;
Never you mind—but for dear life's sake,
Put on the pace— that's all!
For now at last my toils are past,
Now have I won release,
And with resigned and equal mind
Possess my soul in peace.
Now there are others to work the wheel,
Ready to take their turn,
Let me get out of it—let me feel
Clear of the whole concern.
Then, chauffeur, fly, your courses ply
With all the speed you may,
And get my chattels out of that
Before the close of day.
Tell me as soon as the job 'a complete—
I shall feel easy then;
I shall forget about Downing Street—

It has been calculated that, during
the recent spell of foggy weather in
London, 57,615 drivers of vehicles asked
a like number of other persons similarly
employed where they were coming to, and
that only in a very small percentage of
cases did the answers give satisfaction.
At Billingsgate the fog was so dense
that a drunken man lurched into a coffee-
tavern.
And, in the neighbourhood of Worm-
wood Scrubbs, a respectable citizen
liailed a passing omnibus, which stopped
for him,and it was only when a door closed

vulgarly called a Black Maria. Efforts
to obtain his release are now on foot.

The announcement that a miniature

Golders Hill is supposed to be respon-

that the County Hall was to be erected

but it is none the less regrettable.
A motor-omnibus caught fire in St.

ACTING on the suggestion made by Sir
ALFRED HARMSWORTU in The Dally Mail
that motor-owners who are being asked
by Parliamentary candidates for the loan
of their cars during tlio forthcoming
Election should guarantee to take joint
action to alter the unfair legislation that
now controls the liberty of automobiles
and thus put the industry in England
on the same footing as that in France,
a gentleman has sent to a "political
friend" the following letter, which he
hopes may be useful in promoting further
"joint action."
DEAR SIR,—In reply to your request
I regret to say that, although fully
recognising that at least 25 motor-cars
are essential to the success of any
electoral contest, I cannot lend you even
that small number without requiring
you to give me an undertaking to sup-
port certain reasonable measures of
which I happen to have a rough draft
in my pocket.
I-was formerly in the habit of lending
automobiles to every man who said he
waa " blue," without exacting any pledge
as to how he would vote if elected,
although in some cases, especially in
Ireland, there was considerable risk of
the varnish on a new car getting
scratched; but would you believe what
liappened? An M.P., who was simply
motored into his seat by one of my cars,
afterwards had the audacity—not to
mention bad taste—actually to say in
the House that he approved of some
limit being placed on the speed of
motors when driven on public roads! I
was iii the Speaker's Gallery at the time
and simply stood aghast. Did this
gentleman stop to consider, before using
such rash and intemperate language,
the effect it might have on the business
of undertakers?—a grand industry in
France, but already languishing here
through our short-sighted policy. <l
Now, Sir, I am not going to be duped
in this sort of way any more, BO unless
you are prepared to give me the above-
mentioned pledge (of which I will for-
ward you a form on receipt of 6<i. in
stamps), I must reluctantly leave you
to flounder outside Westminster Palace
without attempting your motor-curricular
rescue. Yours affectionately,
MERCEDES.

"C.-B.," PREMIER.
EXTRACT FROM THE RECESS DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
PLEASANT to note cordial reception with
which C.-B. is greeted on accession to
office. Political friends and foes applaud
his Cabinet-making. All he does is
well done. Happy send-off for a new
Premier.
'Twas not always thus. Those who
have dwelt in House of Commons these
last six years have pained memories of
quite other things. When at Reform
Club meeting at opening of Session of
1899 C.-B. had the leadership pressed
upon him by belated Liberal Party, it
was a proof not only of high esteem of
business capacity, but of exceptional
personal popularity. Those who knew
him in private life justly regarded him
as an ideal Leader of the Party in the
circumstances of the hour. Courteous
yet canny, long schooled in politics
and Parliament, suffused with mellow
humour and the gift of expressing it in
happy plirase, he seemed the very man
for the place.
He gave early testimony of insight
when, acknowledging the unanimity
that marked his election and the en-
thusiasm attendant on his acceptance of
the thankless office, he insisted, as an
essential condition of success in the
arrangement, that the Leader of the
Party really must be allowed to show
the way. Enthusiastic Liberals cheered
this novel sentiment. Before the Session
had closed, C.-B. on at least one memor-
able occasion found his authority openly
flouted. The Party divided in the face
of the common enemy, marching in
sections into opposite lobbies.
Beyond ever-seething revolt in his
own Party C.-B. has, through his term
of Leadership, been hampered by quite
unusual hostility displayed towards him
by Right Hon. Gentlemen on the Front
Bench opposite. PRINCE ARTHUR in par-
ticular gleefully seized opportunity of
belittling the authority of the Leader of
the Opposition. The cue was promptly
taken by Ministerialists on back benches
and below the Gangway. The manner
was adopted by Ministerial organs in the
London Press.
C.-B. faced the conspiracy with a
quiet dignity and -unruffled patience that
would have disarmed more generous
assailants. He winced once last Session
when, on his misreading with comic effect
a word of his written speech, the Right
Hon. Gentlemen seated opposite broke
forth in boisterous laughter. For the
most part he passed unnoticed the jeer-
ing references—PRINCE ARTHUR here again
frequently striking the note—levelled at
his habit of carefully preparing in MS.
his more important speeches.
Whilst these things happened in the
House of Commons, in Printing House
Square, in Fleet Street and its precincts,
C.-B. was conscious of being buttressed
by support of Liberals throughout the
country. Having the advantage of per-
spective, they formed a juster view of
his actual proportions. He is Premier
by choice rather of the sturdy Pro-
vinces than of the fickle Metropolis.
Now that he has come into his own,
both applaud success achieved by ster-
ling capacity, unfaltering courage, un-
flinching political honesty.
In the first Session of a new Parlia-
ment we shall find C.-B. blooming amid

THE TRIUMPH OF C.-B.
circumstances wholly different from those
patiently endured during six years of
probation. Having uncomplainingly,
doggedly, made his way through the
bleak winter of Opposition, his constitu-
tionally genial nature will expand in the
sunshine of prosperity that awaits his
return to the familiar scene at West-
minster.
Kay it be Averted!
IN The Daily Mail of December 11
there was a paragraph to the effect that
a possibility existed of Mr. BEEIIDOHM
TREE with his entire company visiting
Germany next April. It was not stated
that the performances would commence
on the first of that month. But is it nut
the best policy for England that all
Englishmen should refrain from acting
in any manner that might admit of a
wrongful interpretation? Why do any-
thing iu any way to irritate the Ger-
mans? Let Mr. TREE, our ever-green
Christmas Tree, reconsider the matter,
and promote brotherly feeling between
the two nationalities by remaining, and
giving us the pleasure of his company,
at H.M.'s Theatre, Haymarket.
CHRISTMAS CRACKERS AND CARDS,
WHERE THOMAS — beg pardon, we
should say TOM—comes out extra well
this year with his Crackers for Christ-
mas is with his Table Decorations. Of
course anything Japanese must be very
popular just now, and however business-
like TOM SMITH'S designs may be for
drawing on purchasers' purses his Jap
designs are most fancifully original.
"Bridge" too is archly presented, while
the Calendar Crackers combine utility
with ornament, and the Quick Change
specimens are fascinatingly attractive!
TOM'S Christmas stockings are enor-
mous! They are meant for the very
biggest calves; or, each one of them
might be used as offering retirement to
some hundreds of Midsummer Nights'
fairies after a Christmas Night's festivity.
McCAW, STEVENSON AND ORR apparently
take the place of MARCUS WARD, and
keep the old reputation up to its high
standard with a Poetical Calendar
charmingly designed, and full of poetical
reminders, very interesting. Quite a
short cut to the poets. ERNEST NISTER
is, to this present Xmas Xaminer, a new
name. Congratulations to him on his
most artistic calendars.
The man in the street, L'Homme a In
rue (shall we say rightly or wrongly ?)
will find the De la Rue pocket-books
of all sorts and sizes as serviceable as
ever. By the way L'Homme a la rue

regard them with appreciation through
the shop window, but the public will
step in. And of all [the other pocket-
books, whose shall we indicate as appear-
ing, at least to us, as most serviceable?

HAPPENING to be looking over Sir
GEORGE OTTO TREVELYAN'S Interludes

was struck by the following lines, so
appropriate to this season when panto-
mime is upon us:
Like the clown
Who lies with fiendish craft athwart the floor,
Then knocks at some innocuous tradesman's
door.
Now, marvellously acrobatic as the most
modern clowns may be, the Baron
ventures to defy anyone of them while
"lying athwart the floor" to knock at a
door,— that is, in the ordinary accepta-
tion of "knocking at a door," even with
his heels. It recalls that famous impos-
sibility of a sentinel "lying prone " and
keeping his eyes fixed on the stars.

VIH.—THE CHIROPODIST.
"TnE Great Annual Rummage Sale
and Bazaar," said LILLIAN, "will be held
in the Schools on Thursday evening,
under the distinguished patronage of
the Vicar, Miss MALLEY, Mrs. JOHN MAR-
GETTS (who won't be there, luckily),
Mrs. ARTHUR MEADOWES, Miss oh, I
forget the rest."
"Do you really come second on the
list, or is it just side?" I asked.
"Alas, it's alphabetical. As a dis-
tinguished patron, DICK, I feel bound to
ask you what you propose to do to help
us on this auspicious occasion."
"I hadn't really proposed anything."
"Well, hurry up and begin."
"What does one do at a Bazaar? You
can't sing very well"
"You don't sing very well,"
corrected LII.LIAN.
"My voice may be un-
trained," I said, " but it has
power, not to say volume. I
can give you some old clothes
of ARTHUR'S."
"Do, and anything of your
own you can spare. And try
and think of some other way
of making money. It's for
cassocks."
"Cassocks?"
"Or is it hassocks? I really
forget. Anyhow they want a
lot."
That evening I went over
ARTHUR'S summer wardrobe,
and found quite a lot of old
things that he couldn't really
have been keen on—except for
the associations, and there
must have been lots of those.
I made a heap of them without any
remorse, feeling sure of his approval
as soon as he heard of the noble object
in view—cassocks, or hassocks. I mean
one must sacrifice for the cause of
charity. I confess that I did hesitate
for a time at a flannel suit (grey with a
light blue stripe); but I had certainly
never seen him wear it since his marriage,
and ante-nuptial garments are unlucky
or something, aren't they? Anyhow, I
got him on the list.
Of course I gave some of my own
things too. In particular I remember a
pair of evening socks, very fine, with
open work down the front. (I may say
here that the bidding was very brisk
for these, Join? CLAYTON securing them
eventually for threepence.) Also I
thought of an idea.
"It's just this," I said to LILLIAN.
"I 'm going to tell fortunes. Observe
Professor FOBTUNO, the Famous Chirolo-
gist. Seances, 3</. Ordinary aunts, 2d.
Children Half Price."
"I say, that's rather a thought."
"I shall disguise myself in a long
beard, and you can erect me a little tent
in a corner of the room."
"Right you are. I'll tell Conn."
Conn is not only a churchwarden, but
also a handy man with the adze, being
by birth a carpenter.
"Yes, do. By the way," I added,
"did you ever see ARTIIUU in a flannel
suit—grey with a light blue stripe?"
"Grey with a — — Isn't that the new
one he was so proud of?"
"Oh, is it?"
"I think so. He bought it at the
very end of the season for that garden
party, and only wore it once. Yes, of
course. Why?"
"I knew I hadn't seen him in it
often," I murmured.
"Grey, I think, suits ARTHUR, don't
vou?""

Mr. Turkey-flabbier. "TON MY WORD! THESE FEATHERLESS [PICTURES
ABE POSITIVELY INDELICATE! I SHALL CERTAINLY FORBID HY CHILDREN
TO COME HOUND HERE!"
"What does the Vicar do with all the
clothes?" I asked anxiously.
"They put the best up for auction,
and the others have a fixed price," ex-
plained LILLIAN.
Mr. Conn is a worthy man and a good
carpenter; but he was a fool to label my
tent as " Professor FOHTUNO, the Famous
Chiropodist," though it does show the
spread of education. However, the mis-
take was soon remedied, and I did much
good work for the cause. Personally
I must have made several hassocks
myself.
Of course I hoped that LILLIAN would
come in to have her fortune told, and I
meant to give her a good one, too.
However, it never came off properly.
She dashed in suddenly with, "Oh,
DICK, what do you think?"
I seized her hand.
"You will marry a young and hand-
some man of the name of RICHARD," I
began, quickly. "You will have"
"Oh, I didn't come for that. What
do you think has happened?"
"I'm telling you what will happen.
You will marry—oh, I said that. I see
land, pasture land, in your palm. You
are not a farmer yourself. Then per-
haps you know somebody of the name
of MEADOWES?"
"DICK, stop it. GRACE and . ARTHUR
are here. And I saw ARTHUR'S flannel
suit on the auction stall."
"Oh lord!" I said. I got up and
sat down again. "Of course you told
ARTHUR that I 'd gone up to town for the
day? H'sh, look out." I took her liand
again. "An aunt," I said loudly, "who
will die in an Eastern country." And
ARTHUR entered.
"Is that yours, LILLIAN? I didn't
know you had an aunt. Who is the
Professor?"
"Are you going to be told? How
splendid! The left hand's
best."
I took ARTHUR'S hand. The
future was easy to read. "I
see trouble before you. Dis-
appointment and wrath are
written. Great vexation will
be yours shortly. There will
be an estrangement between
you and a dear friend. A
friend? No no- it is surely
a relation."
LILLIAN laughed suddenly.
"Poor old ARTHUR!"
"You are gifted with a
charitable nature," I went on.
"Quite lately you have made
great sacrifices in the cause of
charity. As yet you do not
realise how great."
I peered into his liand
again.
"I can see no more," I said.
"Except that there is this trouble before
you. The rest is—blank."
My next visitor was ETHEL WILLEY,
and then I had a brilliant idea.
"It is decreed," I said, taking her
hand, "that you will do a work of great
kindness in the immediate future."
"But I wanted the past," she said.
"The past is past," I said, impatiently.
"Let us leave it there. Now do attend
carefully to the prophet." Whereupon
I gave her most careful instructions.
"Do be a dear and do it for me," I
implored. "There's the auction bell.
Run."
I had told ARTHUR that there was
trouble ahead, and the rest was blank;
but when he caught sight of his best
suit on the auction stall he started
straight off with the blank part. He
stood there beginning all sorts of in-
articulate protests, until the bidding
reached ten shillings, and then GRACE
drew his attention to the practical, if
expensive, way.

ALL ABOUT THE NEW CABINET.
(Reprinted from " In the Know.")
AT this moment, when it is impossible
to l)e told too much about the members
of the new Cabinet, the following par-
ticulars concerning some of them cannot
fail to be interesting.
SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN
is scrupulously careful in his attire. It
was noticed when he called on the KING
last week that he had not forgotten his
coat or omitted to lace his boots. He
has never been known to walk down Pall
Mall wearing only one spat, however
strong the temptation may have been.
He uses a tortoiseshell comb, and prefers
BEETHOVEN to WAGNER. In matters of
gastronomy he has his own opinion, but
the statement that he eats a Haggis every
Saturday night is unfounded. Before
he took the name of BANNERMAN he was
never known as C.-B.; although now
even the policemen on duty in the House
call him nothing else. The nickname
originated with one of our wittiest M.P.'s.
MR. JOHN MORLEY
is generally considered to be the most
intellectual member of the new Cabinet,
although there is a difference of opinion
as to the precise meaning of the word.
He is one of the few members who are
not Scotch, and his features are easily
distinguishable from those of both Sir
HENRY

TIME—Chrietmaa Day.
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN and Mr.
JOHN BURNS. Mr. MORLEY rarely
plays golf when in Opposition;
it remains to be seen what he
will do in Office. He knows
India like a book, but was
quite ready to be the Chan-
cellor of Exchequer if neces-
sary. Mr. MORLEY may be seen
riding in the Park every
morning on a short cobby-
built nag named Pongo. He
uses a J pen and Indian ink.
MR. JOHN BURNS
is the first Labour Member to
enter the Cabinet. Few of
his fellow Ministers are better
known, and none hit harder
in the nets in Battersea Park.
Mr. BURNS dresses in blue
serge and a grey beard. At
the time of his summons to
the PREMIER'S house he was
at work on a scheme to
convert the L.C.C. steamers
into motor omnibuses. This
must now stand over for the
present. Mr. BURNS strikes
a heavy blow, and rarely gets
his umbrella stolen. His
favourite flower is the little fra-
gile wood-anemone, the wind-
flower of the poets. He eats
heartily. Mr. BURNS is think-
ing of giving up Bridge now
Benevolent, but somewhat deaf old Gent. "HA, THERE oo THE DEAR
OLD CHURCH BELLS, RINGING OUT THEIR MESSAGE OF CHARITY AND GOOD-
WILL TO ALL MANKIND!"
SIR EDWARD GREY
is not really grey, except in name.
He
is still a young man, although older
than Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL. His title
came not from journalistic enterprise or
the promotion of music-hall companies,
but was inherited; in other words, he
is a baronet, thus giving the lie to the
old adage, "All cats are grey at Knight."
Sir EDWARD is fond of fishing, and has
now and then caught something. He
breakfasts usually at nine, but on
occasion, when, for example, he has to
catch a train, can be earlier. Being a
Director of a great Railway Company he
is rarely asked for his ticket. His
favourite colour is blue, and he always
says that pure Latakia is too strong for
steady smoking. In all other respects
he is a model English gentleman.
that he has so many new duties,
but so much pressure is being
brought to bear upon him that
he may change his mind.
MR. JAMES BRYCE,
who is perhaps the ablest Irish Secretary
since Mr. GERAI.D BALFOUR, has been
long before the public as a climber and
publicist, but this is his first serious
attempt to rule the country which gave
him his admirable brogue. A man of
medium height, he has read much.
His interest in life is wide and vivid,
and pickled walnuts, he has been often
heard by eavesdroppers to declare, have
more fitness with cold mutton than cold
pheasant. Mr. BRYCE dresses simply in

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"BRAYVO, THACK, my boy!" quoth the merry ANDREW
ARCEDECKNE, addressing WILLIAM MAKEPEACE after the great
novelist's first lecture on the Four Georges. "Brayvo, THACK,
my boy! First-rate! Why don't you follow 'em up with the
Two CHARLIES, the Eight 'ENRIES, and the Sixteen GEEGORIES?"
And to Mr. JOHN IX>NG, who has just published among Tlic
Carlton Classics a clearly printed, quite pocketable, and
therefore companionable, edition of THACKERAY'S Four Georges,
the Baron makes a suggestion similar to ANDREW ARCEDECKNE'S.
Give us many standard works in this handy and inexpensive
form.
Mr. HERBERT PAUL devotes a considerable portion of his
Life of Froude (PITMAN) to the scarifying of FREEMAN, who
pursued with bitter acrimony the successive literary efforts of
his brother historian. Whenever FROUDE added a chapter to
his History, or contributed an article to a periodical, be sure
FREEMAN was down upon him with pen dipped in gall. He
was largely responsible for establishing the charge of
inaccuracy which still attaches to FROUDE'S work. "I do not
suppose." he wrote in one of a long series of assaults in the
congenial columns of The Saturday Review, " that Mr. FROUDE
wilfully misrepresents anything. The fault seems to be
inherent and incurable. He does not know what historical
truth is, or how a man should set about looking for it ....
His book is not written with that regard for truth with
which a book ought to be written." That is plain speech,
perilously approaching libel. My Baroniteonly half wonders
what would liave happened to FREEMAN had he been brought
into court before Mr. Justice DARLING and a special jury
approaching the average of intelligence. Having effectively
disposed of FREEMAN, Mr. PAUL himself takes FROUDE in hand,
and in language, less coarse, not therefore less effective,
sides with the assailant. "FROUDE," he writes, "was an
advocate rather than a Judge. He held so strongly the
correctness of his own views and the importance of having a
right judgment in all things, that he sometimes gave undue
prominence to the facts which supported his theory." When
FROUDE, having completed his History of England, turns his
gaze across the Channel, his biographer's flail falls with in-
creasing severity. Mr. PAUL writes: "The book is really an
Orange Manifesto. Such works have their purposcand FROUDE'S
is an unusually eloquent specimen of its class. But they are
not history." Thus was FREEMAN justified of his criticism.
Had he had the opportunity of tasting both doses FROUDE
would probably have preferred the Saturday Reviewer to
his biographer. It is to Mr. PAUL'S credit that he is not
influenced in passing judgment upon the subject of his
biography by the parental fondness of the biographer. This
stern quality increases the value of the study, and adds
piquancy to a valuable addition to the personal history of
literature.
It was a great pleasure to read, and it is as great a pleasure
to recommend to everyone, an historical romance so simply
told and so thoroughly interesting as The Idol of Ike King,
by Captain CURTIES (HuTCHiNSON & Co.). The King is
GEORGE THE THIRD, who, when Prince of WALES, loved HANNAH
LIGHTFOOT the Quakeress, "to whom" (the Baron is quoting
THACKERAY) "they say he was actually married (though I
don't know who has ever seen the register)." For HANNAH
our author, who "wishes it to be distinctly understood that
he does not vouch for the historical accuracy of all he here
describes," substitutes a perfectly charming heroine, Miss
Olivia Everett, of Old Walaingham Grange, a true gentle-
woman of ancient lineage, staunch to the old faith at a time
when to profess and practise it was to incur the greatest
possible risks. With her the PRINCE fell in love at first sight,
as did she with him. Their marriage was indeed a veritable
love-match. On this basis of probability our author, following
the example of Sir WALTER SCOTT in his historical novels,
builds up a touching romance. Probably the old Norfolk
family, of which Captain CURTIES is a member, has in its
possession a store of most interesting documents that may
serve him for another novel as interesting as this.
Interludes, "being three essays and some verses by HORACE
SMITH" (MACMILLAN & Co.). The Baron reading these three
chattily-written essays has come across several good old
stories, but he gives the palm to such new ones as are of
the worthy magistrate's own personal experience.
Some time ago there was published, in bulky volumes
necessitated by the long record, the autobiography of Sir
HENRY KEPPEL, Admiral of the Fleet. Sir AI.GERNON WKST,
brother-in-law of the old sailor lately paid off, has supple-
mented the statelier frigate by something in the shape of a
brisk and handy cutter. Harry Kc/rpel (SMITH, F.LDER) is a
memoir including the later years of the typical British sailor
of whom Her Majesty Queen VICTORIA spoke as "my beloved
little Admiral, best and bravest of men." Born when GEORGE
THE THIRD was King, and having held commission on the active
list of the Navy under four Sovereigns, KEPPEL lived to see
his affectionate friend EDWARD THE SEVENTH crowned in West-
minster Abbey. With light touch Sir ALGERNON WEST brings
the personality of a simple-hearted yet capable man home to
the reader who knew him only by name. He shrinks from
attempt to define "that nameless magic, that infection of
geniality" which made HARRY KEPPEL equally attractive to
his Sovereign and his midshipmen. Happily lie makes it
clear enough in the pages of his book. The earlier history
recording KEPPEL'S gun-room clays vividly recalls the experi-
ence and adventure of Midshipman Kasy and Perciral Keene.
Thirty-three years ago, when he was in command at Plymouth,
Lord CHARLES BERESFORD was his Flag Lieutenant. My
Baronite notes many points of resemblance between the young
'un and the old 'un. Beyond the Flag Lieutenant, now Vice-
Admiral, the type is almost extinct.
THE
BABON
Kitty and the Viscount, by MULVY OUSELEY (GAY AND BIRD),
is a novel that the Baron may (under reservation) recommend
as a fairly interesting story that might have been really good,
had the construction of the plot been reconsidered, and the style
of writing very carefully edited. To believe that a stranger,
introduced by the secretary of a West-End swell-mobsmen's
Club to its members, should, at his very first visit, be taken
aside by one of the biggest criminals present and be fully
confided in, is so improbable as at once to upset the
entire scheme. The introduction of the man who ought to
have been Kitty's husband
is awkwardly managed. Yet
has the Baron a good word
for the equivocal Kitty and her
Varying Viscount.
The Baron DE BOOK-WORMS
begs to announce that during
this Christmas season he is
giving his Baronite, his Re-
tainers generally, and himself,
an entire holiday. On the re-
opening of the office, after the
holidays, in the second week
of the New Year, " Business will

NATURE STUDIES.
MIDDLE AGE.
I HAVE heard many men talk very seriously about middle
age, but it was generally the middle age of other people, not
their own. In referring to their own years they usually
spoke with an air of jocoseness which did not well conceal
their anxiety to be reassured. What, as a matter of fact, they
wished the friend whom they addressed to say was something
of this kind :—" Middle-aged, my dear chap! You! Why,
you 're younger than you ever were in your life. It '11 be
time enough to talk about middle age in another ten years."
And the friend,if he
had a grain of tact,
would certainly
come up to the
scratch gallantly
with some genial
remark of the sort.
If such things hap-
pen to be said to you.
don't you find your-
self afterwards
walking with a
springier step, as if
you were prepared
to ruffle it with the
best of them in any
of the bold and
dashing adventures
specially suited to
youth? Honestly
it's not a bit of use.
Look at that grey-
haired old servant
pottering about the
Club library. You
can remember him
when his hair was
black and glossy,
when his waist was
slim in the Club
livery, and when he
bustled as if nothing
could tire him.
How long ago was
that? And how old
were you at that
time? It is a shock
to observe these
living and palpably
aging reminders of
one's own vanished
or lecturers or even the inexorable years themselves. Yes, it
was a delightful time, and its memory cannot fade, but to
come upon it like this is a little disconcerting.
I met, not long ago—it was a distinguished, a never-to-be-
forgotten honour—an undergraduate, a great athlete and, I
must add, a thoroughly pleasant companion. What, however,
•pleased me chiefly about him was, not the list of his triumphs,
but the extraordinary vivacity of his youth, both as to bodily
enterprise and as to animal spirits. He could turn the most
beautiful somersaults on a lawn or on the floor of a room; he
could throw cart-wheels; he could walk on his hands for
fifty yards and then, with a swift convulsion of his being,
could erect himself
suddenly on his
feet; and he held
and expressed the
opinion that at the
age of twenty-eight
it was still, perhaps,
possible for a man
to be fairly active.
Beyond this he
would not go. He
bore his part with
animation amongst
his elders, though
lie was often heard
to say that politics
were in his judg-
ment a dull and
confusing pursuit,
and that literature
was even worse as
a subject for con-
versation. He was
happiest when he
was playing with
the small children
of the house, and I
never knew his
spirits and his gay
self - confidence to
be depressed except
upon the rare occa-
sions when he was
forced to a desk in
order to write a
letter, a pursuit
which he frankly
abhorred. "I say,
old chap," I have
heard him call out
on such an occa-
elasticity, but the shock is probably good for you. 'sion, "do you spell 'bicycle' with an i or a y?" When

together. What would you take to do it now? And JACK? Last
week the newspapers announced his elevation to a bishopric
and gave him high praise for his learning, his piety and his
doctrinal orthodoxy. Who else kept in the Court? EDWARD
was one, and now he is a headmaster; and TOM was another,
and you are godfather to his boy, who rowed last summer in
his College Eight. There are ghosts in the Court, too, ghosts
in flannels and football boots, or in the easy suits of dittoes
that the young affected many years ago, and they are shouting
and laughing and trolling songs, and altogether behaving as
if nothing in the wide world mattered—not Deans or tutors
For myself, I could wish to lose a certain amount of my
poor ability in spelling if I could lose with it some of my
encumbering years and be a barbarian once more. But I
am under no illusions, for it was but a short time ago that
an amiable young man—a German he was, but not other-
wise hostile—rose as I approached, and offered me his chair.
On my protesting that I couldn't think of taking it, he
smiled a very pleasant smile and said, with polite insistence:
"Pray sit down. For me it does not matter; I have young
legs and can stand, but it would not be right that you should
remain standing." I thanked him, and took the chair.

WHY WALES WON.
DRUIDICAL AND BARDTC INFLUENCES.
MR. LLOYD-GEORGE AND WELSH RABBIT.
ARE THE NEW ZEALANDERS A DEGENERATE
RACE?
EFFECT OF GEYSERS AND FEMALE SUFFRAGE.
MR. SEDDON* AS A PHYSICAL IDEAL.
[NOTE.—Mr. Punch cannot necessarily guarantee the statements or
endorse the conclusions which appear in this article. But he is confident
that the general sense of it is as sound as that of other articles, published
elsewhere, in which the previous successes of the representatives of
New Zealand have been explained on the ground ot that country's superi-
ority, physical, social, and moral, over the degenerate Motherland.]
WHILE the echoes of the Welsh triumph are still ringing
through the mountain fastnesses of the Principality, the
student of aetiology will not be content to dismiss this remark-
able occurrence as a mere detached incident in the everyday
world of sport. He will look deeper; he will investigate
causes, primary, secondary, and immediate. He will say:
Here is the spectacle of a country of the most exiguous area
inflicting a crushing defeat (by however small a margin) upon
another country almost
TWENTY TIMES ITS SIZE.
Here is the spectacle of a practically untried combination
overcoming one that for the last two months or more has
been steadily perfecting itself in competition with teams of
every variety, including scratch fifteens representing Scot-
land, Ireland, and the amateur section of England. It is
impossible to explain this overwhelming superiority without
scientific reference to racial characteristics, the influences of
tradition, physical environment, and so forth.
And, in the first place, we must remember that the Cymry
have always enjoyed a certain sense of confidence born ol
the success of their defensive tactics against the Saxons, who
constantly failed to defeat them on the home ground. Then,
again, football was the
NATIONAL GAME OF THE DRUIDS.
The influence of hierarchies on the sports of a people can
never be overestimated. The popularity of Ju-jitsu is directly
traceable to the ancient Shinto cult; the Olympic Games
were under the habitual patronage of the priesthoods of
Zeus and Hera; and it is from the ritual of Odin that the
Scandinavians derive their passion for Ski-ing.
Secondly, the influence of the Bards cannot be ignored.
Ear-witnesses ot the impromptu Eisteddfod which was so
remarkable a feature of the Cardiff match, after enjoying
the privilege of comparing the Maori war-song with the
national hymn of Wales, as
POURED FORTH FROM 50,000 PATRIOTIC THROATS,
assert that so paralysing was the domination of the latter
that victory was already won before the leather was so much
as set in motion.
Thirdly, there is the question of language. It has been
well said that a man who can conquer the difficulty of the
Welsh tongue can conquer anything. Further, its effect
upon the
DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAXILLARY ORGANS
has no parallel in history. And it must not be forgotten
how big a part is played by the jaw-bone both as a propelling
force in the scrimmage, and as an instrument for use in
collocution with the referee.
Among immemorial traditions conducive to patriotic fervour
in the football field may be mentioned the Welsh Rabbit,
symbol of fleetness; and the tale of Taffy, Welshman and
Thief, an obvious gloss upon that national reputation for
sleight-of-hand which has fallen to the heritage of the present
three-quarter line.
Passing from prehistoric origins to the lower middle ages
we have
OWEN GLEXDOWER TRADING THE WELSH SCRUM
to victory in a long series of international games, and to the
end undefeated by the combination which overthrew the
famous Hotspur team (at that time playing under the Rugby
code) in the match at Hateley Field by Shrewsbury.
In more recent times Mr. Li/ncn-GEORGE (a local hero) has
taken Cabinet rank; and the Ixird Mayor of CARDIFF (a still
'more local worthy) has made himself conspicuous in other
ways.
The pride of memories such as these, both old and new.
must have acted as a powerful stimulant to the nerves, and
added something to that virility which one invariably asso-
ciates with an atmosphere of anthracite coal-dust.
Turning to the New Zealanders, we have to ask ourselves
whether the quality of degeneracy (a term usually employed
in explanation of British defeats) can fairly be predicated of
so young a race. I am rather inclined to attribute their
debacle to
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.
But it is not to their history and traditions (stili in the
elementary stagas of construction) that we must look for the
causes of this arrest, but rather to natural environment and
social and political institutions. Under the first head I have
only time to mention the Geysers, or boiling springs, which
are a feature of those unfortunate islands. I know of
NOTHING MORE ENERVATING THAN A GEYSER.
Xo country that produces them has ever become a First-Class
Power without a desperate struggle.
Iceland has Geysers, and that is where the Prodigal Son
came from. Further, in New Zealand, as in Iceland, you
have those extremes of heat and cold which are so injurious
to the system: Geysers at one end of the thermometer and
Frozen Lamb at the other.
Then there is the institution of Female Suffrage. Where
the women of a nation become men, its men are apt to become
women. No less a person than XERXES is my authority for
this generalization, based on a remark let fall by him, from a
safe distance, at the battle of Salamis.
Finally, in the person of the Right Hon. RICHARD SEDDOS,
Xew Zealand's ideal figure, we have a standard of physical
culture which
MAKES FOR NATIONAL OBESITY.
His bodily dimensions (quite apart from his tendency to
mental tumidity) cannot but have exerted a baleful influence
upon his loyal subjects, discouraging that abstinence and
self-restraint which are essential to a perfect training,
and more than counter-balancing the admirable example
offered by the svelte and almost ascetic figure of the Hon.
\V. P. REF.VES, High Commissioner for the Colony.
These drawbacks notwithstanding—and, after all, though
the football-players of New Zealand may have had a hand in
the establishment of Female Suffrage, Frozen Lamb, and Mr.
SEDDON, yet they cannot be held
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PREMIER'S PROPORTIONS,
nor for the Geysers—I must believe that this promising
young country, by strict attention to its physique, will eventu-
ally distinguish itself and send out a combination worthy to
cross shins with the all-conquering Cymry. 0. S.

But, on the morning of his regal pride,
With disconcerting suddenness, she died!

THE SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE.
EXTRACT FEOM THE RECESS DIABT OF TOBT, M.P.

A CHERISHED MEMORY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
"Labby " speaking from the corner seat below the Gangway.
Monday.—Another figure vanishing
from a corner seat below the Gangway.
Ghosts haunt it. In succession men as
diverse as DILWYN and GRANDOLPH sat
there. The last to go (from the opposite
side) was JEMMY LOWTHER. Now the
SAGE OF QUEEN'S ANNE'S GATE withdraws,
happily no further off than Florence,
but still too distant to be in time for
prayers at Westminster and so secure
his coign of vantage.
Mr. GEDGE carried into his retirement
pained conviction that the SAGE'S tenure
of the place was not founded on con-
stitutional usage. According to un-
written law of Parliament, private
Members secure for current sitting
a particular place by attendance at
time of prayer. Then and then only
are cards procurable, which, stuck in
the back of the seat with the Member's
name writ upon them, mark it for his
own. Mr. GEDGE, who miased no gather-
ing where "Amen!" might be loudly
said, was constant in attendance at
prayers. In course of time he was struck
by recurrence of strange thing. He
never observed the Member for North-
ampton among his fellow devotees. Yet
of Northampton. A strange alliance,
the grim cobblers and the cynical man
of the world. But it was firmly welded
?.nd, come what might, in whatsoever
low-water the Liberal Party might
droop, LABBY was Member for Northamp-
ton. Of late years he has not been muck
to the fore, but to the end he remained
a Parliamentary institution. Between
1886 and 1892 he was in his prime,
and did much to contribute to the down-
fall of the SALISBURY Government which
befel in the latter year. It was naturally
expected that he would gain the custo-
mary reward by the proffer of office in
the new Ministry he had helped to create.
But something happened. He was left
out, and in spite of cynical indifference
to place and rank he was never the
same man in the House of Commons.
At his best he delighted a staled assem-
bly with the freshness of his views, the
piquancy of his criticism. He cherished
a generous forbearance for sheer incom-
petence. That no man so doomed could
help. But for pretence or fraud, hypo-
crisy or self-seeking, he had a keen eye,
swooping down upon the sinner with a
sweet smile, a soft voice that made more
effective the ruthlessness of attack.
The House could better have spared
a duller man. The MEMBER FOR SARK
goes about with saddened mien, murmur-
ing his "Lament for LABBY ":
But now they are moaning on ilka green loan-
ing,
The Flower of Northampton is a' wede away.
'at question time there he was, in the
corner seat mocking at Ministers.
Mr. GEDGE smelt a rat. Nay, he saw
it moving in the air. Resolved to catch
it. One day at prayer time he, with
innocent air of casualty, moved from his
accustomed seat to one below the Gang-
way in full view of LABBY'S seat in which,
at that moment, DILKE chanced to be.
(When he came to think of it, DILKE
always was there at prayer time.) Cover-
ing his face with his hands in devotional
attitude, Mr. GEDGE strategically opened
his fingers so that he might see what
passed. What he beheld was DILKE
furtively sticking a card at the back of
the corner seat and another for himself
in the seat adjoining!
When at question time the SAGE
entered and took the corner seat, Mr.
GEDGE peached. The House laughed,
the SPEAKER solemnly shook his head, and
characterised the procedure as out of
order. All the same, the SAGE kept the
corner seat, rising thence on the eve
of Prorogation last August to deplore
afresh the conduct of the Government.
Through six Parliaments he has
been triumphantly returned by the men
HONOURED IN THE BRIDGE AND
ITS OBSERVANCE.
MR. RAVEN-HILL exhibits his Bridge
Problems (LAURENCE AND JELLJCOE) in four
tableaux which have already appeared in
these pages. For this show he has touched
'em up with a paint-brush. They are
very effective, and having already secured
popularity in black-and-white attire
they will be especially well received, at
this season of the year, as excellent
specimens of rouge, noir, et couleur. At
a moderate price they will be dear, in
another sense, to Bridge players, just as
are JOHN LEECH'S inimitable hunting
scenes to all sportsmen, ancient and
modern.
Each picture tells its own story, though
some of them may cause discussion
among Bridge-players as to the artist's
intention; but there willbenodifferenceof
opinion as to the meaning of "Why did
he declare hearts?" which situation
speaks for itself, as evidently the male
partner intends to speak for himself
when the play is over, and the words
have to be spoken in earnest. Anyone
who wants to have "a real good set"
in his house at Christmas time could not
do better than offer the hospitality of his
walls to these Bridgers.

[DECEMBER 27, 1905.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IS THE DISCOMPOSING BOOK.
THE Russian paper the Eazavet has
ceased for the time being to appear,
because, says a special correspondent in
St. Petersburg, "the printers refuse to
work unless their own comments are
inserted in the political articles." The
simplest causes, it will be seen, may
paralyse the Press. Why so reasonable
a request should be refused we fail to see.
Our attitude is shared by the Editor
of The Daily Chronicle, who tried the
experiment of allowing the compositors
who set up the article on Mr. JOHN
BURNS in the issue of December 18 to
interpolate whatever criticisms they
wished. The article, as a matter of
fact, got into the paper in its original
form, but at one time it ran like this,
i.e., the comments of the printing staff
being here given in italics for the sake
of clarity:—
Critics of Mr. (P) Burns.
Some of the Socialist newspapers
are girding angrily at the President
of the Local Government Board.
"Quite riglit, too." "Who says so?
If it's Jim Black that said that, let
him come outside." Mr. JOHN BDRNS
has not been in office a week, but
already he is described as "a traitor,"
an "apostate," and a "backslider."
"So he is, the blighter." "No, he's
not, he's a true patriot if there ever
was one." "How about that £2,000
salary? Calls himself a Socialist,
does he?" These abusive—" They 're
not abusive, they 're just. Abusive
yourself "—epithets are not likely to
disturb the equanimity of a man
who is only anxious to serve hia
fellows—"Oh,ishe?" "Yesheis"—
and who has not renounced any of his
democratic ideals. "What about that
£2000, I keep asking?" "Well,
you wouldn't have the man iwrk
for nothing, would you?" When
will these acidulated critics under-
stand that if there is anything in
Socialism it must consist of construc-
tive action, organisation, and adminis-
tration? "Who'sacidulated? Think
we 're drops, I suppose." "I tell you
I know John Burns through and
through, and he 's all right. He 's a
good man." "Honest John." Mr.
BURNS has never departed from the
ideals of social well-being which he
held when he began his public career.
While his detractors have been talking
and talking he has been working.
"Talking, indeed! Haven't we been
working too? I know jolly well 1
have!" He can look back upon
eighteen years' arduous toil on the
London County Council for the bene-
fit of the whole community, and
particularly of labour, while his
services in the House of Commons
have been of incalculable value to
the working classes. "Have they?
I'd like to know how." "Well, so
you shall: Johnnie Burns has . . . ."
"Time, Gentlemen, please. You
can't hold the pen all night, Mr. Clever,
Eu know. 1 want my turn too."
! now occupies a position where hia
practical knowledge of local govern-
ment and his administrative ability
will have free play. "Yes, at £2,000
a year. What I want to know is,
what price £2,000 a year for a
Socialist?" "Go and boil your head."
His detractors might at any rate wait
until Mr. BURNS has had his oppor-

Dick and Harry (who have lost themselves).
"PLEASE, MR. POLICEMAN, COULD YOU TELL us
THE WAY TO THE THEAYTRE?"
Policeman (in surprise). "THEAYTRE!"
Dick. "Yus. WE'RE THE TWO Hmps OF
MEBBIHEXT AT THE PANTERMIME."
tunity before launching their arrows
against him. The accession to Cabinet
office of a champion of Labour and a
constant friend of the poor like JOHN
BURNS ought to rejoice the heart of the
Social Democrat and the Independent
Labour man. "Why? That isn't
what we sent Burns to Parliament for.
We sent him there to be a working man
like us, not a blooming toff." "You
silly ass, haw can he do you so much
good as a private member as in the
Cabinet?" Instead of thankfulness
we find bitterness; instead of grati-
tude, reproaches. To win the confi-
dence of English Socialists you must
talk and theorise. To attempt action
is an unpardonable sin. "Well, well.
Next article, please." "Down with
John Burns!' "Three cheers for
John Burnt!" "Good old Burns!"
The experience of the Editor of The
Daily Telegraph was much the same,
the article on Mr. BALFOUR'S speech at
Leeds having been originally set up
in the following form:—
It has been the affected habit of
members of the present Ministerial
party and of their faithful shadows
in the Press to pretend that they did
not understand the attitude which
Mr. BALFOUR has assumed with regard
to the Fiscal problems which Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN, with characteristic vigour
and ability, has brought once more
within the range of practical politics.
"Faithful shadow yourself!" "What
price the Duke, and George Hamilton,
and Balfour of Burleigh and Arthur
Elliot?" "No blooming side about
any of them." "Who 's he getting at,,
then?" "Joe's the man for me!"
There is enough intelligence at the
command of the Radicals—there is
not a plethora—to compel our belief
that this failure to understand is as
much a pose as that of a well-known
sporting Judge, who asked counsel
"What is a bookmaker?" "Look
here, I 'm not going to stand being
called a plethora!" "Why can't he
say 'Awkms and have done with it?"
"He's got hold of the wrong end of
the stick. It was 'Who is Connie
Gilclirist?'" Affectation carried to
extremes becomes stupidity, and if,
after last night's speech, the Radicals
still plead inability to comprehend,
there will be nothing left for us to do
but apply to them the epithet bestowed
by VOLTAIRE on the second author who
compared his mistress's lips to a rose-
bud. "Roundabout, longwinded talk
when carried to extremes becomes bun-
kum." "// you want to call a man
an ass, why not say so' instead of
dragging in Voltaire?"
The talented Editor of the Outlook
published in his issue of the 16th inst.
an article headed "Fair Play and No
Quarter," the first proof of which read
as follows:—
"Although the duty of the new
Opposition is to oppose with at least as
much energy, vigilance, and resource
as the Ministerialists have employed
against them, there are some things
in which Unionists will set a better
example than they have been shown.
They will not forget the public interest;
and they will not dip their weapons
in that venom of personal rancour
with which Mr. BALFOUK, Mr. CHAM-
BERLAIN, and Lord MILNER have been
assailed. "Oh, won't they! Just you
wait a bit until you've got into your
stride." "Well, anyhow the Tories
didn't forget the 'public' interest."
.... Mr. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL, always
a vastly over-rated critic, has been in
the last few vears an exceptionally

industrious and offensive partisan; we
can only regret that the Radical party's
universal provider of ordinary platform
fustian should be made Minister of
Education. "That's more like fair
play, ain't it?" "What, 's the matter
with the Universal Provider? Be's
all right!"
The troubles of Tsardom formed the
theme of a recent article in The Spectator,
which, when first set up, presented the
following appearance:—
THE STATE OF RUSSIA.
A far-away memory comes to us of
an eminent explorer's description of
the doubts which for some time he
entertained as to whether, a body of
water that he was following was a
tributary of a great lake which lie
had lately left, or an outlet from that
inland sea towards a distant ocean.
"A trifle foggy that for the opening
par." "What has Stanley in Central
Africa not to do with the state of
Russia?" "0 never mind, he'll get
there in another stick or two." At
one spot the current, such as it was,
seemed lakeward; not very far away
it was plainly flowing in the opposite
direction; while between those points
there was a dense growth of reed and
cane which made any certain observa-
tion practically impossible. "Rather
like one of Mr. Dalfour's fiscal
speeches." "Cheer up, matey3, we
sliatt get to Russia in time." Some-
what similarly, those who now watch
the Russian situation—so distant and
obscure, though the telegraph, when
working, gives it a delusive appear-
ance of nearness—are unable to form
any clear conclusion as to the direction
in which events will ultimately be
determined. "TJien why did you sit
down to write an article on ' The State
of Russia'?" In a few months' time,
it may be, there will be no doubt as
to the future set of the current of
Russian national life—" Yes, that's
quite on the cards,"—but at the present
moment it is impossible to say with
any confidence whether it is heading
backwards towards the sands of re-
action, or moving forward to become
a fertilising river of liberty, or gather-
ing force for the rush of a wild torrent
of destruction. "Heading backwards—
sounds like a football match." "Oh,Lor!
there '« another column yet to come!"
"Chinese labour 's nothing to this."
"As a matter of fact, electricity is
absolutely the only safe means of elec-
trically lighting a railway train."—The
Electrical Review.

of technical knowledge on this point,

ment is correct.

FAILURE.
Now the Old Year in senile weakness lies,
Fast drawing to his close;
And in my bosom bitter thoughts arise,
That make me dash the tear-drops from
my eyes,
And fiercely blow my nose.
It is not that in this sad hour I weep
For each forgotten vow;
'Tis not remorse that will not let me sleep
For broken promises I swore to keep;
I 'm used to that by now.
It is not that I mourn for chances tossed
Without a thought aside,
For Fortune's proffered gifts supinely
lost;
I very much prefer to blow the cost,
And let such matters slide.
But this regret within my bosom gnaws,
That, though I've made prodig-
-ious efforts to assimilate its laws,
With patience worthy of a better cause,
I have not learned to Bridge!

AN EXACT SCIENCE.
[Miss EMILT HOLT has written a book entitled "The Secret of Popu-
larity," in which the road to social success is described as "An Exact
Science." Some of its more valuable rules are here reproduced.]
WOULD you, 0 my Sister, have thewomenhand-in-glove with you,
All the men in love with you,
Thinking you divine;
People thronging round your door in infinite variety,
Seeking your society,
Begging you to dine?
Then come—nay, do not turn from me—I'll teach you charm
and tact:
As you will shortly learn from me, the Science is exact.
Practise with a looking-glass the graceful art of meeting friends,
Fancy you are greeting friends,
Aim at glad surprise;
Cultivate a happy smile, catch your breath, look rapturous—
That's the way to capture us—
Welcome with your eyes,
And learn to gush "How siceet, my dear, to see you up in
town!
It's really quite a treat, my dear! And how is Mr. BROWN?"
Ply with utmost diligence the subtle art of listening;
Sit with eyes a-glistening,
Lips the least apart.
Never mind however much your visitor is boring you;
Know he is adoring you
And grateful in his heart.
Be sure that he will gad about and sing aloud your praise,
Till all the world is mad about your sympathetic ways.
When you meet a friend at tea who's been to Rome or Hanover,
Call that bashful man over,
Draw your frills aside.
Bid him share your sofa with a little gesture prettily,
Ask about dear Italy;
"Was it azure-skied?"
"Was Jupiter so Pluvius?" and punctuate his prose
Account of Mount Vesuvius with little "Aha"' and " Ohs."
Laugh, too, when he tells you tales of continental travelling.
Never take to cavilling,
However old the brand.
i When he takes his leave of you, at once assume an attitude
Of deferential gratitude,
And warmly press his hand.
This way lies popularity. Of course, there's none who thinks
You savour of vulgarity, and are, in short, a minx.

"Your Imperial thinkers, your Im-
perial drinkers, your landlords, your
Randlords, your philosophic doubters,
your Imperial shouters, your shufflers,
and your scufflers—there they lie in one
mingled mass of misery." The fore-
foing is an extract from a speech by
ir WILFRID LAWSON, and one can well
understand that anyone who sets him-
self the task of delivering such elaborate
jeux d'esprlt after dinner does well to
be a teetotaler.
"A Mother of Three" writes to pro-
test against the proposed change in our
sailors' costumes, as she considers due
notice has not been given. She has
just had her little boys (whose long
curls are always so much admired) rigged
out as able-bodied seamen, and it will
be a cruel hardship if they are now to
become " back numbers."
At many British military messes, we
hear, officers are fined by their comrades
if they appear in a " made-up " dress-tie.
We believe there is no similar regulation
in the Japanese Army, and, if this be true,
the successes of our allies in the recent
war become all the more remarkable.
Upon being served with some stale
fish in a restaurant in Paris, a Mexican
threw the dish at the waiter, the water-
bottle at a gentleman who interfered,
and afterwards fired his revolver at the
proprietor. It is supposed that the
Mexican must have lost his temper.
The coolness of our firemen has often
been admired. At a recent conflagration
some of them were observed to be actually
playing on the flames.
With reference to the police constable
who was seen running in a West-End
street last week, a satisfactory explana-
tion is now given. The officer was going
off duty.
Some excitement, we hear, was caused
at a Charity Bazaar, last week, by the
appearance of an old gentleman, of weak
intellect, in bathing costume. He ex-
plained that he had come for the six-
penny dip.
A pretty novelty has just been placed

at Bangkok for stealing clothes by means
of a fishing-rod. The custom of catch-
ing fur-coats in a butterfly-net has long
been demode in the best circles.
We hear that a new monthly to be
devoted to the interests of violinists is
in contemplation. Suggested title, The
Strad Magazine.
At last, we hear, a satisfactory title
has been found for a play to succeed
worthily "The Worst Woman in Lon-
don." It is so simple that one wonders
that it should not have occurred to
anyone before. It is to be "The Worst
Woman in England," and the new play
is to be followed successively by "The

In reply to "Anxious Enquirer," we
think that no present is appreciated by
a smart young man quite so much as
a worked smoking-cap. In fact, the
majority of our bachelor friends have

"Ah! There 's another year nearly done. I feel that I have very little to complain of. Take it all round,

happily, for we have a new Cabinet, we are teaching our policemen Jujitsu, we have beaten the New Zealanders at last,
and there is no influenza epidemic apparent.
"No," continued the Sage, " I think I have very little to grumble at, and I hope I am not singular in that belief."
It was at this point that MR. PUNCH was made aware of the proximity of a stranger, apparently in the depths of
perplexity, who approached him with extreme difficulty, owing to the burden of literature under which he staggered.
'' Help! help !" cried the stranger. "Help! help!"
"My dear Sir," said MB. PUNCH, " is there anything I can do for you? You seem to be burdened by books!"
"Indeed, I am," the stranger replied. "That is my complaint. I am burdened by books. I cannot get into my
house for books. I cannot move about it for books, and I cannot leave it for books."
"How is that?" asked MR. PUNCH. "Are you so inveterate a collector?"
"A collector? No, Sir. A collector is a happy man compared with me. A collector owns his books and can sell
These are library books."
"But why do you have them?" the Sage inquired.
"Why, Sir? Because I cannot help it, Sir. Unlike Mr. BALFOUU, I am a reader of the newspapers, and every
newspaper now forces library books on its patrons. I take in six daily papers; I therefore belong to six libraries. My wife
and family take in eight weekly papers; they therefore belong to eight libraries. That, I think, makes fourteen libraries
altogether, unless so much literature has ruined my arithmetic. Each of these libraries insists upon our having three books
a day — forty-two in all."
"But you could discontinue your subscription," Mr. PUNCH gently suggested.
"No, Sir; impossible. This is an age of perusal. Burdensome as these books may be, I feel that it is my duty
as an Englishman to try and master them. 1 feel that I ought to keep abreast of the intellectual life of the time. I
ought to know what people are thinking. Even to expect to understand the differences between Protection and Retaliation
is, I know, too much; but I think I ought to know the difference between conscription and universal military sen-ice.

I ought to know how to keep a motor-car? on an income of £800 a year. I want to belong to my age and choose a new
religion. I want a new diet. I want to become a millionaire. And to do this I must read first the papers, and
secondarily the books. I understand that one is not properly civilised unless one belongs to several libraries."
"Do you read old books as well as the new ?" asked MR. PUNCH.
"Oh no!" replied the heavily-burdened stranger. "The old books are no good; I am told by the assistants
at the libraries that every writer who is dead or over forty is a back number — only the books which have been issued
in the last two publishing seasons are of any use, have any real snap. Mental pabulum must be fresh if it is to
nourish the brain and promote efficiency, or, I should rather say, effectiveness, for efficiency as a cry is more than nine
months old. But even so it is hard to keep pace with all the new books. For instance, before I go to bed to-night
I must finish a now treatise on Christian Science as applied to Voice Production, a new monograph on Manchuria, and
a new novel called The Sands of Bliss."
"It serins to me," said MR. PUNCH, musingly, "that, much as the excesses of the past are abused, and rightly
too, I would almost rather be a three-bottle man than a three-book man."
"And that is not the worst," continued the stranger. "I can manage to get an idea of what the books mean;
but there is Mr. SHAW as well. Nowadays, all persons with any claim to culture must keep abreast of Mr. SHAW, for
uoes he not reign at the Court? Can you tell me what he is driving at?"
MR. PUNCH having tactfully parried the question, his interlocutor proceeded:
"My wife goes to Mr. SHAW'S plays, and is delighted when a character on the stage describes her and her fellow-
women as harpies, or as miccubi; but it does not amuse me. It enrages me. What am I to do? Is it I who am
wrong, or Mr. Saw? I don't know where I am, Sir. I don't know where I am. What we want is someone to point
the way; to provide us with a straightforward road; to make most of all this literature unnecessary."
"Well," said MR. PUNCH, straightening himself, "you need not go so very far to find that guide, philosopher and
friend. You want cheery, salutary, and genial satire ; you want the best reading in small space; you want the cream of the
journalistic record of the day; you want a healthy yet pungent criticism of life; you want wit without offence and humour
without ambiguity? Very well, Sir. One man one vote may be a good cry in Politics, but one man one book is a
better in Literature, when it is the right book. Allow me, therefore, ---- " and with a gracious gesture he handed to the
stranger his

Punch's Almanack for 1905.

IT was suggested by one of the scien-
tific iconoclasts at the last meeting of
the British Association that the Zodiac
was played out. Mr. Punch, however,
as usual knows otherwise. To that
profound Sage it is given to see farther
than any through a brick wall, and he
has discovered that, so far from Aries,
Taurus, Aquarius & Co. having ceased
to affect their children, it is impossible
to escape their dominion, as the fol-
lowing notes on the months only too

abundantly prove. A baby coming into
this world in January, under Aquarius,
cannot escape aquatic influence in one
form or another; to be born in March,
under Aries, the Ram, is to be aggressive;
to be born in July, under Leo the Lion,
is to be leonine; and so forth. The
Zodiac still rules, and Mr. Punch has
brought together instances both from
ancient and modern history to prove the
truth of the assertion.
J ANU ARY-AQ U ARIUS.
Though water is placed last of the four
elements, January has its revenge by
leading in the year. This is only as it
should be, for British greatness is built
on its control of the water. The English-
man begins his day with a cold water
tub, he tempers the rigours of the night
with a hot-water bottle, and he consoli-
dated his Empire by winning the battle
of Waterloo. The United Kingdom is
surrounded by water. What would Scot-
land do without its Burns, or England
without its Becks? Aquarius fittingly
dominates the first of the months.
No one born in January can avoid
watery influences—either he will make
a voyage, or abstain from one; get water
on the brain or his feet wet; pay the
water rate or go to prison; mix too
much whisky with his water, or too
little with his whisky. And it is in this
month that water-pipes usually burst.
England has many notable Januarians,
as they might be called. Dearest to the
heart of Aquarius is Sir Wilfrid Lawson,
who is pledged to the service of water
pure and simple. The world's record
for abstinence is, however, held by the
Ancient Mariner, of whom it is recorded,
"Water, water everywhere, and not a
drop to drink." In spite of Sir Wilfrid's
creed it has been proved by Thames
trippers to be as easy to be drunk on
water as on laud. In this month also
were born Mr. Water Long and Lord
Tankerville, Baron Schweppe, Mr.
Anthony Waterer, Mr. H. G. Wells, author
of The Liquid of the Gods, and Principal
Rainy, each of whom in his own way is
helping to build up the Empire.

MEMORABILIA OF THE MONTH.
Hercules encountered the first Hydro.
Jan. B.C. 2501.
Mixed bathing permitted in the Round
Pond. Jan. 1905.
Kingsley's Water Babies, published
1863.
Umbrellas first called gamps. Jan.
1844.
PROVERBS OF THE MONTH.
An Englishman's aquascutum is his
castle.
When an acorn sprouts on a mountain ash,
Then prepare for splash, splash, splash;
But if a walnut buds on the oak,
Then prepare for soak, soak, soak.
HINTS TO SMOKERS.
Distrust cigarettes which are sold at
more than ten a penny.
Irish cheroots can be negotiated only
by persons of an iron constitution.
Before lighting a cigar, always hold it
to your ear. If you hear a roaring like
that emitted by a sea shell, it is safer to
ask for a milder brand.
FEBRUARY—PISCES.
To be born under Pisces is a sure
augury of success as a swimmer. Hardly
anyone so favoured can* fail every
11 -


Bummer to swim to France-- that test of
the higher natation. Greasley was born
in February, and so was Haggerty.
Leander and Byron were both February
babies, and it is the only mouth in which
Holbein and Mr. Swinburne feel really
well.
The influence of Pisces is powerful
also iri stimulating thirst, and many of
our greatest drinkers have confessed to
February as their natal month. Porson,
for example, so notoriously drank like a
fish that the French coined from his

Such is the power of Pisces that most
of the Finns are born in February, and
they invariably choose that month in
which to perform any important action,
such as taking a new house, buying a
dog, &c., &c.
Coldness of blood is not unavoidable
by February children, but a certain
frigidity is often noticeable. Mr. Gill,
K.C., was born in February, and so

were Mr. Richard Whiteing, Sir Rennell
Rodd, and St. Polycarp. Perhaps
England's greatest February son is the

THE ETIQUETTE OF VISITING.
On entering the room a caller advances
I towards the lady of the house before
addressing anyone else, and shakes
hands. If your hostess has only one
arm, be sure to offer the hand corre-
sponding to the one she still possesses.
When a visitor rises to take leave, his
hostess rings the bell so that the servant
may be ready to open the hall door. If
the bell is out of order, the guest, on
descending to the hall, should hum or
sing gently to attract attention. Should
that fail, he must call down the kitchen
stairs, unless the kitchen is at the top of
the 1 louse.
MARCH—ARIES.
March, the month of bluster and
aggressiveness, owes its character to the
influence of Aries, whose power is such
that under it the most timid of creatures,
the hare, develops an extravagance of
behaviour which has become a by-word.
Schemes of aggression almost invariably
have their origin in March. It was in
March that Mr. Andrew Carnegie began
to endow Free Libraries ; spring-cleaning
commences on the 21st; and demands
for rent disturb the equanimity of the
householder in the last week of the
month. To the domination of Aries we
must attribute all these phenomena.
To be born under Aries is inevitably
to be energetic and assertive. Mr. Win-
ston Churchill was born in March, and
so was Mr. Lloyd George. Mr. C. Arthur
Pearson first saw the light of this planet
in a windy day of the vernal equinox.
Mr. Chamberlain planned his tariff
reform in March, and in March Admiral
Togo rammed the first Russian cruiser.
Our old friend Mrs. Ram was a March
child, and Rameses the Second, and
greatest, was crowned in this month.
MEMORABILIA OF THE MONTH.
Cardinal Rampolla first saw Madame
Clara Butt. March,' 1899.
Shakspeare murdered by a desperate
band of noted amateurs. March, 1904.
Ramadan introduced into Ixmdon by
the Omar Khayyam Club. Members go
on Shorter rations. March, 1905.
The Poet Laureate, Mr. Alfred Austin,
received his first butt. Lady Day, 1895.
PROVERBS OF THE MONTH.
Butt me no butts.
You can't make an ivory ruler out of
a rani's horn.
COSTUMES FOR WINDY WEATHER.
To obviate the painfully bouffanle
effect caused by rude Boreas and his
attendant brethren, fragile and airy
fabrics must now be carefully avoided.
For esplanade wrear, tailor-made gowns
should be heavily shotted, while an inner
lining of ferro-concrete will be found to
give the desired stability to a fur-trimmed
cloth redingote. Now, however, that
open-air exercise in all weathers has

become so fashionable, no one should
venture out in a tornado without a
parachute. Embroidered and jewelled
parachutes of lace and bebe, ribbon marie
up over a detachable silk lining, of which
it is advisable, in the interests of variety,
to include several in one's wardrobe, are
now much in vogue.

TOBY, M.P.
A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY THE MEMBER FOR SARK.

As in the case of another personage
well'[known in literature, Toby's birth
"is wropt in myst'ry." There are
authorities who claim that he descended
in a June thunderstorm from the Dog
star. That, however, need not be taken
Siriusly. In brief, it is a myth. Toby
was never nearer the Canis major than
was Homer, whose birthplace is equally
a subject of controversy.
Whilst dismissing legendary lore it
is safe to say that Toby was born of
poor but honest parents. He lacked
the advantages of education at a public
school, and took a degree neither at
Cambridge nor Oxford. But, as John
Bright used to say, and was able to
personally testify to the truth of the
allegation, 'Varsity training is not abso-
lutely essential to achievement of high
position in public life.
The fact is, reading and writing came
to Toby by nature. Thus endowed he
was able to pursue his studies at the
fountain head. His mother, to whom,
like most great men, he owed much,
was removed (by water) early from this
sphere. His father, Tobias by name,
was the companion of a wooden-legged
watchman who lived in the vicinity of
the Isle of Dogs. Bereft of his mother
the young pup clung more closely to
his remaining parent. Also on one

occasion he clung a little viciously to
his father's employer. If it had been
the wooden leg in which he inserted
his teeth the incident might have been
overlooked. Toby selected the other
one.
On the face of it it was a trifling
circumstance. It had momentous effect.
The irate watchman misunderstanding
his motive, which was simply to investi-
gate the reasons why one leg should
be more bulky than the other, kicked
him off. His father fearing to be de-
prived of his living disowned him, and
Toby was cast out upon a cold world.
Retiring to the Isle of Dogs his capa-
city and personal predominance quickly
asserted themselves. Though still young
in years he drew around him a retinue
of dog--. Some acquired the habit,
fastened upon them by rude boys, of
app< aring at Court with sections of a
tin can attached to their tails. This
indignity, the handiwork of idle boys,
gave birth to deep resentment in the
generous breast of the Captain. He
resolved to form a Republic in the
island. As a preliminary he established
six Army Corps with remounts and all
modern appliances. In due time he
would lead his army against the tyrants
of his race, make prisoners of them, and
send them to work in the gold mines
under native gangers.
All went well for some weeks. At
the approach of the dog days sedition
was fomented within the camp. The
Commander-in-Chief—he had now as-
sumed that rank with extra rations—
was accused of ratting. Summoned to
appear before the Council of Ten he
indignantly denied the charge. As he
proceeded with his oration the ears and
tails of his accusers drooped. The Ten
in Council barked approvingly, honour-
able acquittance was certain, when, as
William Black used to say in his novels,
"Lo, a strange tiling happened." Some
commotion was heard at the back of
the Court. A cry was raised "A Rat!
a Rat!" Instantly all the dogs, led
by the Council of Ten, bolted, leaving
Toby a free, but lonely dog.
Sickened of statecraft Toby, still in
his teens, though wiser than many
hoary bulldogs, shook the mud of the
Isle of Dogs from off his paws and
turned his face towards the setting sun.
"The star of Empire," he said, " rises
in the West."
One morning, taking a walk clown
Fleet Street, whom should he meet but
Sir. Punch. The keen eye of the Sage
piercing the shaggy eyebrows trustfully
turned upwards on him beheld the
light of honesty and genius that shone
beneath them. His friendly whistle
was fearlessly obeyed. Trotting briskly
at the heels of his new master Toby
found himself in an office. He was
promptly arrayed in a white starched
ruffle, and "accommodated with a seat,"
as they say in the police courts, on a
number of volumes set upon the table

where sat the Master Spirit of the age,
pen in hand, contemplating an im-
promptu.
That was sixty-three years ago. Dicky
Doyle happened to look in, drew master
and dog as they snt in close companion-
ship, a picture of world-wide renown
that exists to this day. Forty years
later the electorate of Barks, looking
round for a representative worthy of
the historic county, sent Toby to Parlia-
ment.
But that is another story. Are not
the doings and sayings of Toby, M.P.

of The Kennel, Barks, written in suc-
cessive volumes of I'uneJi whose appear-
ance has gladdened the world during
the last quarter of a century?

Punch's Almanack for 1905.
THE MODERN JOHN GILPIN.
JOHN GILPIN was an Alderman
Of credit and renown:
1 lis family was staying at
A distant country-town.
Now Gilpin bought a motor-car.
And the first time 'twas tried-
Arranged to fetch his family,
And take them for a ride.

The morning came, the chauffeur drove
The car up to the doors:
A 16-horse-power, Clincher-tyred
Mercedes-Napier-Mors.
And, when it stopped, men sauntered up,
And little boys as well;
And some remarked the wheels went
round,
And some observed the smell;
And everyone cheered loudly when
A start was made at last—
To see that drays and brewers' vans
Were easily oiit-classed.
Now all went very well at first,
But twenty miles from town
Something began to squeak. At once
The chauffeur got him down.
Alas! while he was underneath
To find out what was wrong,
Gilpin was left alone (which, points
The moral of my song).
Now Gilpin (though a pleasant wit
Who loved a timely joke)
Scarce knew the difference between
Misfiring and a spoke.

So, having nothing else to do,
At length must needs forsake
His role of looker-on, to put
The clutch in by mistake!
"So, fair and softly !" John, he cried,
But John he cried in vain;
The car began to move as though
'Twould never stop again.
And fast and faster grew the pace:
For, reckless in his fright,
He oped the throttle with his foot,
And eke with all his might!
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,
Away went mask and hat;
At sixty miles an hour or more
He dashed along the flat.
And when the rumour spread around—
"The Gordon-Bennett Race!"
There scarcely was a person there
But backed him for a place.
While men who in the morning laid
Seven to one on Edge,
Looked anxiously at Gilpin's back
And tried their best to hedge.
The dogs did bark, the children screamed,
And chickens strewed the road;
And some cried out "Police, police!"
And some, "Police be blowed!"

Then Sergeant Jarrett paced a mile,
And waited watch in hand:
But, eke to hide his fell intent,
Covered his boots with sand . . .
But Gilpin vanished in a cloud,
And very soon he neared
His family, who wondered much
To see how well he steered.
They cried, "John Gilpin! Here we are!
Stop, stop, for Heaven's sake!"
Said John, with head between his knees,
"Can't someone find the brake?"
So like a bullet swift he flew—
Shot from a marksman's gun—
Far past his family—for why?
It was a Non-stop Run!
Away went Gilpin, far away,
And sore against his will;
Till somewhere short of John o' Groats
His car at last stood still.
But while he wondered what to do,
His carelessness (alack!)
Once more was his undoing, for
The car began to back!
Slowly at first, but faster soon
It gathered pace amain,
And all the way it came before
It hurtled back again.
And as before the people cried,
"The Gordon-Bennett Race!
This is the second round. How well
Gilpin maintains the pace!"

So backward ever Gilpin dashed,
Until some miles from town
He met a circus in the road ....
And then at last got down!
But, undesignedly no doubt,
Got down upon his head—
Some yards away; and people thought
"Alas! he must be dead."
Not he! By landing on "The Man
With India-rubber Skin"
He saved his own! (all but a slight
Contusion to the shin).
[The car was not so fortunate -
And ah1 to pieces went:
They found a wheel in Dorsetshire,
A sparking-plug in Kent.]
That night (returning home by train)
O'er coffee and cigars,
Surrounded by his family,
He cursed all motor-cars!
He cursed the Lanchester with strength,
The Darracq without pause;
But most of all he cursed aloud
Mercedes-Napier-Mors;

And promised there and then to buy
A carriage and a pair,
And when his wife goes forth to shop
May I be near to stare.
So let us sing, "Long live the King!
And Gilpin long live he!"
(And Gilpin's wife, who daily drives
Down Regent Street at three.)

MR. PUNCH'S ZODIACAL ZIG-ZAGS.
APRIL-TAURUS.
In this moiitli was John Bull horn—
oil the first, according to some foreign
publicists, but not so according to
Cocker. The old gentleman, in spite
of a few little troubles in some of his
limbs a twinge or two of South African
days before the day of England's patron
saint. Taurus not only provides the
roast beef of old England, but he typifies
her natural solidity of character. In
various liquid forms, again, he ministers
to one's internal needs, and (by adver-
tisement) to the illumination of our
streets.


•TAURUS
gout, a suspicion of Russian influenza,
the possibility of German measles, a
slight attack of Lhassatude—is still
hale and untouched at heart. There
are some who say that he takes too
much exercise at games—a view in
which Mr. Puncli is inclined to agree—
and is too little disposed to consider
serious measures to compete with his
more enterprising Brother Jonathan;
but doubtless energy in this direction
will conie in time. He remains at any
rate the finest Bull on earth.
It is with no ordinary appropriateness
that the sun enters Taurus only a few
To be bom in April is to be infallibly
associated in some way or other with
Taurus. Bisley prize winners are born
in this month, and so was Mr. Jesse
Collings. • It was in April that the
first Cowes regatta was held, and in
tliat month also Mr. Croker, the Tain-
many Bos, left Oxon.
MEMORABILIA OF THE MONTH.
St. Patrick introduced bulls into
Ireland to take the place of snakes.
April, 400.
Sir Boyle Roche born. April 1, 1743.
Sir Loin knighted. April, 1196.
Baron Liebig first read Elegant
Extracts. April, 1845.
Bull-baiting suppressed at Worcester
by Bishop Gore. April, 1903.
PROVERBS OF THE MONTH.
Where there 's a Bull there's a Bear.
(Afghan Proverb.)
Never hit a gift bull in the eye.
COMMON SUPERSTITIONS.
To find a mouse in your teacup means
good luck.
If a tintack or a drawing-pin is seen
on the bathroom floor and not picked
up, misfortune will dog your steps.
It is unlucky to give red pepper to a
mad bull.
Walking into a coal-shoot right foot
foremost brings luck.
MAY—GEMINI.
The Heavenly Twins, Castor and
Pollux, affect in various ways the destiny
of those born in May. Castor is the
patron of horsemanship and driving,
Pollux of boxing and wrestling. To be
born in May is therefore, in addition to
the chances of being a twin, a sure sign
that one will be influenced positively or
negatively by horses or bruisers.
The advantages of being a twin are
obvious only when it enables the one
who has done wrong to be mistaken for
the one who has done right. On the
other hand, it does not entitle you to the
Royal Bounty. No really very great
persons have ever been twins, with the
exception of Czesar and Pompey, Beau-
mont and Fletcher, and the two Lees,
Sidney and Nancy.
It is impossible for a May baby to go
through life without either witnessing a
wrestling competition or refraining from
doing so—such is the power of Pollux.
Hackenschinidt was a May baby, and so
were the Terrible Turk and the Atrocious
Bulgarian. All May children are born
with clenched fists. All May children
also are in danger of becoming horsey,
whether they take to motor-cars or not.
Lord Brarnpton was a May baby. Mr.
Rider Haggard, Miss Cobbe, Canon
Morniugtou and Marechal Ney were all
born in May.
MEMORABILIA.
Castor oil first administered to the
little Pollocks. May, 1881.
Scotland Yard first discovered that
Adolf Beck was not John Smith. May,
1903.
John Chilcote, M.P., appointed ambas-
sador to Siam.
Madame Sarah Grand and Mr. W.
Baddeley win the mixed doubles.
PROVERBS OF THE MONTH.
Two of a face seldom agree.
It is better to have German measles
than Siamese twins.

POLICEMAN X. CAK'T TELL T'OTIIEB FROU WHICH.
CRICKET FORECASTS FOR 1905.
The cricket season proper may be said
to open with May. About this time the
daily papers will begin to print cricket
articles. In the Chronicle Mr. Jephson
will welcome the return of King Willow
to power and wish him the allegiance of
Old Sol and as little as possible of the
company of Jupiter Plu.
On the fields all over the country
wickets will fall, and not a few legs will
find their way before them. About the
13th a great batsman will disappoint
his admirers. On July 1 Surrey will
appoint a new captain.
JUNE—THE CRAB.
That we cannot always be moving
forward but must occasionally reculer
pour mieux sauter, is beautifully indicated
by the entrance of the Sun on the sign
of the Crab. For, as the American poet
sings:
Three things there are in the world which when
they seem coining are going.
When they seem going they come—diploma-
tists, women, and crabs.
While a somewhat similar thought has
occurred to our own Poet Laureate:
Rash man toils forward, ev'n in four-wheeled
cabs,
Yet surely something may be said for crabs.
Not merely something but much may
be said for the wayward crustacean, who
deeply influences all who see the light
under his ruddy sign. To be born in
June is to be reactionary, an apostle of
retrogression, a laudator temporis ac.li,
and so strong is the spell of their natal
sign on oarsmen who celebrate their
birthday in this month that they can
never be depended on in an emergency.
M. Pobedonosteff, the Procurator of
the Holy Synod, was born in June; so
was Mr. Heury Chaplin. In this month
also the days grow to their longest, like
a crab's claw in process of deliberate
extension, and begin to shorten again,
like the same claw withdrawn.
MEMORABILIA,
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt opened Arabian
Aquarium at Crabbet Park. June, 1901.
Great Clans and Little Glaus, written
by Hans Andersen. June, 1846.
The Great American Impresarios,
Messrs. Klaw and Erlanger, projected
their dramatisation of Crabbe's Borough

Lord Hosebery crabbed the Anglo-
French Agreement. June, 1904.
PROVERBS OF THE MONTH.
Even a crab-apple can have the pip.
It is better to catch a Tartar than a
Crab.- Togo's Table Talk.
MOKE GARDENING NOTES.
Tennis lawns should be well swept
and mown, the courts marked out at
least once a week, and lost balls care-
fully looked for in the herbaceous
borders. Withered flowers should be
removed, dried and pressed, and if
snow falls it should be at once removed.
Watering is necessary in dry weather,
but in the event of a heavy rainfall the
amount can be substantially reduced.
Cover fruit trees with green bai/.e, and
pot newspaper cuttings.

A MEMORY OF MAY.
[Messieurs the reading public are invited to note that many of the statements contained in the following epic are merely legendary.]
I OFTEN wish that I could part
The hanging folds of drifted haze
Which so divide me, head and heart,
Prom what I was in early days:
I wish that I could take a course
Of Someone's Stimulating lotions
And so revive the vanished force
Of first emotions.

Not in the elemental stage
Of marbles, butterscotch and Henty,
But at the still more guileless age—
Nineteen to twenty.
Once more I flash a garish vest,
A tie of flame, a flawless cuff;
Once more my lip (how well caressed !)
Evolves a kind of downy fluff;
Almost the memory makes me swoon
And ere I know it I am playing.
"0 that (I like the poignant tune)
We two were Maying!"
i
Not that we scoured the nutty grove
Or tramped across the "sheep-trimmed
down,"
Not that I ever really wove
About her crest a floral crown;
But May has somehow always struck
The chord of that third term at college,
When she and I essayed to pluck
The Tree of Knowledge
"Mentally reconstruct the thrill of vernal
passion."
I would (in thought) renew delight
Of every season's sporting cult:—
The cursive hoop, the hovering kite,
The pebble-loaded catapult;
I 'd give a lot to taste again
The joy of going into breeches,
Or even bear (in mind) the pain
Of caudal switches.
I simply cannot! When I 've seen
The young about me skip and play
I 've felt I never could have been
So young, so immaturely gay;
And though they kindly veil their scorn
When I elude their hurly-burly,
I know they think that I was born
Obese and surly.
Yet, when upon the evening breeze
The sighs of lovers haunt my ear,
When swallows swoop from over seas,
When Spring (to cut it short) is here;
I too, who once at Nature's will
Followed apace the season's fashion,
Mentally reconstruct the thrill
Of vernal passion.
0 magic sights and scents of May!
Back flow the ebbing sands of Time;
The mists are rent that round me cling,
And I retrieve my boyhood's prime!

Her name I will not noise in print;
To her address I drop no clue,
Nor yet betray by half a hint
What was the local shade of blue";
Discretion seals my inouth, and if
i give (below) her social status
'Twos thence I drew the primal whiff
Of love's afflatus.
She sold tobacco. Often I,
Leaning across the sundering bar,
From sheer virility would buy
A needlessly robust cigar;
She lit the match (ah! little spark
That sets ablaze the leagues of hea-
ther),
And always made some fresh remark
Upon the weather.
We seldom trenched on higher themes;
Soft nothings whiled the hour away,
And just as in a world of dreams,
Went by that truant term of May;
I My habits underwent a change;
My bowling lost its easy action;
i Even to Dons she proved a strange
Counter-attraction!
[
I gave her, day by day, a rose,
Warm from my chest, but] still de-
ferred
(From modesty, I must suppose)
To breathe aloud the crucial word;
And while my doubting lips refrained
To ask her if she cared to rough it,
Quite suddenly my hopes sustained
A knock-out buffet!
| The facts were these. From my exam
I issued last of all my year,
'Which caused my captious Head to dam
What would have been a fine career;
; I guessed the shock might well explode
; That heart (I could not now annex it)
To whose seductive snares I owed
This shameful exit!
i She bore the news with perfect tact!
I even wondered if she had,
| Unknown to me, a nuptial pact
With some more oofy undergrad.
Base doubt! She merely meant to hide
The truth that she was broken-hearted;
And so, with many a sob inside,
We kissed and parted!
Two decades fled before I faced
Those scenes again: the shop was
there;
But 0, her name was now erased,
And she had gone I know not wjiere;

C?e>
V
"My captious Head."
Yet if her heart (like mine) is true,
I still can picture her as saying
From time to time, " 0 that we two
Once more were Maying!'

MR. PUNCH'S ZODIACAL ZIG-ZAGS.

JULY—LEO.
With Ihe entry of the Sun 011 Leo, a
multitude of national attributes are
revealed in those born under this tawny
sign. The children of Leo are invari-
ably strong and ferocious, but of a
magnanimous disposition and a noble
and benevolent appearance. They wear
their hair long, even in the dog days,
they like to get the lion's share of all
good things, and, if musical, on very
slight provocation will rend the welkin
with their roar. If addicted to literature
they are prone to the composition of
leonine verses, and attracted by the
legends of Lyonnesse. If musical, they
incline to the cult of the lion comique.
If engaged in the brewing trade they
exhibit a marked preference for the Red
Lion over all other signs. If their bent
be financial they generally adopt a
ramping attitude.
The choice of the lion as typical
of Britain, in spite of the fact that
lions were never indigenous in these
islands, has long been the subject of
heated controversy, but now, according
to the Poet Laureate, it probably arose
from a confusion on the part of King
Alfred when, after creating a fleet, he
was saluted by his grateful subjects as
Lord of the Main. Anyhow, July is the
month in which lionising reaches its
grand climacteric.
MEMORABILIA OF THE MONTH.
Wholesale exodus of young lions from
Peterborough Court to Carmelite Street.
July, 1880.

A DAINTY RATIONAL PUNTING COSTUME.
. The high temperature prevailing in
the dog days renders the choice of a

AUGUST—VIRGO.
Virgo being the Lady Paramount of
August, amazonian influences are rife
throughout the mouth. All the most
eminent exponents of emancipated
womanhood, Semiramis, Queen Eliza-
beth, George Sand, George Egerton,
Mrs. Carrie Nation and Madame Sarah
Grand, were born in August. It was
in August that Mrs. Eddji invented
Christian Science and Mrs. Bloomer
the bifurcated skirt. In fact, whenever
woman lias shown herself in the van, it
has been under the sign of Virgo.
Girton and Newnham Colleges were
founded in August; it was in August
that lady cyclists in rational costume
stormed the Hautboy Inn, that Madame
Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet, that
Lucas Malet decided to amputate tiir
Ricliard Culmady, and that Mrs. Gallup

the song of the ladybird is at its best,
and Virginia creeper most luxuriant.
On the other hand it was also in August
tli.it the most remarkable tributes to the
King Weibliclie were paid by the inferior
half of creation. Thus it was under the
sign of Virgo that Catherine wheels were
first manufactured, that Verdi composed
La donna c mobile, that Ixsndon Brighton
and South Coast "A" shares were first
called Berthas, that Mr. Birrell took the
name of Augustine, and that Mr. Rider

SEASIDE FORECAST FOR 1905.
This will be a serious month for the
English coast. Fortifications will be
erected all along the sands, only to be
destroyed by an incursion of the tide.
In many places the tide will rise above
the children's ankles. Many trains will
be late, and at Brighton nigger minstrels
will be constantly seen on the sea front.
SEPTEMBER—LIBRA.
The influence of Libra on the human
race has been extensive and benignant.
When the Sun enters tilts sign a general
atmosphere of equanimity is diffused
which renders controversy almost impos-
sible. Libra being the symbol of j ustice,
the Law Courts are closed, and litigation
is reduced to a minimum.
Under the sign of the Balance all
experts in the art of equilibrium have
been born or performed their greatest
feats. It was in September that Blondin
crossed Niagara and Mr. Balfour recon-
ciled his policy with that of Mr. Cham-
berlain. It was in September of 1904
that Justice was supplied with new
scales by Mr. George R. Sims, and the
Special Beck Commission was appointed.
On certain ill-regulated natures,
however, the influence of Libra is
distinctly the opposite. Instead of
maintaining, they lose their balance.
Hence the silly season correspondence.
Under such headings as "Should girls
grow into women?" "The Bible—is it
Biblical?" "Should reading be taught
in schools?" " Is it Christian to breathe?"
this section of the community exercise
their foolish pens. It is also Libra who
drags aunt ally into the arena the sea-
serpent and his scales.
There is a better chance of a child
born in September becoming a man of
weight than one born in any other
month. Mr. Daniel Lambert and Mr.
Henry Chaplin first saw the light in
September.
Signor Cinquevalli received a wound
in his juggular vein. September, 1893.
Balance sheets superseded by wet
blankets among Globe Syndicate share-
holders. September, 1902.
PROVERBS OF THE MONTH.
If you have a beam in your eye, kick

An ounce of fiction is worthji pound
of fact. (Publisher's maxim.) t

The Balance of Power is more than
usually stable in September. The
Kaiser then abstains from public utter-
ances, the Editor of the Spectator takes
his holiday, and all the intelligence of
the War Office is concentrated on
the devising of a new cap for our
gunless army.

GOLF NOTES.
For lady golfers the best dress is
undoubtedly a Taylor-made costume
trimmed with White Braid.
Tom Morris, on being recently asked
whether he was any relation to Sir
Lewis Morris, replied, "No, but I could
write a fair epic of Hades if I tried."
The works of Fra Lippo Lippi are
to be sedulously avoided by those who
wish to improve their putting.
Previous to match play a diet of
shrimps is to be avoided, as in sym-
pathetic natures it is apt to put the

NOVEMBER—SAGITTARIUS.
Dandies are born in November, for

OCTOBER—SCORPIO.
There are no scorpions in England
since the publication of God's Good Man.
But though the scorpion is no longer
indigenous in the British Isles persons
born under that sign generally manifest
some of the traits of that spirited reptile.
October, in short, is the month of
reprisals, and all those born in that
month, are retaliators. It is then that
the most caustic things are said, the
most pointed paragraphs written. It
was in October that Mr. (ribson Bowles
called Mr. Balfour's Cabinet the Hotel
Cecil, and that Mr. Winston Churchill
described Sir H. H. Haworth as a
mammoth Mandarin. Scorpions are still
imported from the tropics every October
to stimulate the jaded appetites of the
plutocrats of Park Lane. Persons suffer-
ing from chronic lethargy cannot do
better than try a brace swallowed whole
with a pinch of cayenne pepper. Curried
scorpion is much in vogue at the Oriental
Club, and scorpions on toast have com-
pletely ousted angels on horseback at the
ordination lunches at Lambeth Palace.
MEMOKAHILIA.
Handel composed the famous March
in Scorpio. October, 1748.

Beaux? In November the infant George
Alexander was first put into trousers, and
Mr. Bobby Spencer first donned a high
collar. Mr. George Wyndham's mous-
tache dates from a November not too
long ago, and it was in November that
Mr. Max Beerbohm first bought a three-
fold mirror and, like Cortes upon a peak
in Darien, knew the joy of gazing upon
the back of his distinguished head. It
was also in November a few years ago
that Mr. Tree appeared as the beau of
Ulysses.
It is a curious fact that more persons
are born within sound of Bow Bells
in November than in any other month.
They have generally a tendency to be
bow-legged, their favourite reading is
the Quiver, varied by Beaumont and
Fletcher, and they cannot say Bo! to a
goose. All this is due to the malign
influence of Sagittarius, who, as every-
body knows, is the patron saint of 'Arrow
School.
It may be asked by earnest meteorolo-
gists, Why should the month controlled
by Sagittarius be so confoundedly foggy?
The answer leaps to the pen. "A. was
an Archer and shot out a fog," which,
as Professor Kuno Meyer, in his famous
monograph on cunoform inscriptions
has conclusively established, is the true
reading of the old line. When frog crept
into the text we can only conjecture,
probably with the advent of William the
Conqueror.
The greatest of all the Archers, not
even excepting the Worldly William, is
Cupid. Hence the amatory history of
the month. It was in November that
Henry the Eighth tottered for the sixth
time to the altar. It was in November
that Sir Francis Jeune and Brigham
Young were born.

THE ETIQUETTE OF MOURNIXG.
A widower should not wear mourning
on the occasion of his re-marriage unless
he espouses his deceased wife's sister.
DECEMBER— CAPRICORNUS.
It is due to the fact that the year
closes beneath the influence of Capri-
cornus that all classes become skittish at
Christmas. Many responsible public
men date their first deviations from
decorum to the perturbing influence of
Christmas capers. It was in the fourth
week of December some sixty years ago
that Dr. Clifford ate his first mince pie.
At the same season Mr. Frederic Harrison
determined some day to become a
novelist, and to plunge into the verti-
seen on Christmas Eve on the summit of
Cleopatra's Needle. Under the inebri-
ating influence of Yule Tide, Mr. Hall
Caine on December 25, 1888, sent Miss
Corelli the present of a Manx kitten,
with the inscription on the label, "From
her first Reader."

ginous revels of the Byzantine smart set.
December was also too much for the
ordinarily cool head of the Leader of the
Opposition. In a moment of expansion
he added the suffix Baimermau to his
name, and has never been the same man
since. It is only in December that
Mr. Alfred Austin ever indulges in two
helpings of turkey, and it was in that
month in 1904 that Mr. Stead visited
his first circus.
In fact the history of December is the
history of desipieiice. Mr. Watts-Dunton,
for the rest of the year a prisoner at his
desk, visits the Wandsworth Swimming
Bath every Boxing-Day. Mr. James

3. Arrived Paris; also, I regret to say, eggs. -
Calm of stay disturbed by early advent of post-
man. Must sign for letter myself. Excellent,
but at times embarrassing, regulation.

4. Dreading further dis-
turlance dress hurriedly,
when another knock at door

my "little breakfast," also
the yarcun. 5. Leave Paris by imgon-l'it for Hyeres. Dorothea as courier not perfect yet,
hence muddle alxiut berths, and are separated. Rest and quiet en route, doubtful;
but lots of cheerful society and change. Can't have everything, and safe from raw
eggs. So " turn in."
6. Wretched night. Ar-
rived Avignon 6.30 A.M. Still
fearful of egg,—so order
Dorothea's coffee, and have
mine on platform.

7. Arrive Hyeres. Eest and quiet at last, but judging" by
n«-d-ri8 at table d'liote, cheerful society not^ arrived—or
gone on.

8. Hotel clientele know all about me iu few hours. I
receive much gratuitous advice. Evidently no difficulty in
getting well—only difficulty to select cure.

PROPOSED GRAND INDIAN CHRISTMAS
PANTOMIME.
BY H. B. JABBEBJEE, ESQ., B.A., &c., &c.
N my former ca-
pacity of British
Resident in Me-
tropolitan areas
I of course fre-
quently attended
various London
Pantomime - per-
formances. And
to myself it was a
wonderment that
all such enter-
tainments should repeat ad nauseam a
lew obsolete nursery fictions that must
surely be stale as the hills to every
cultivated English Playgoer! "Why,"
1 could not help ejaculating, "do
London Managers persevere in Sisyphean
struggles to wring fresh changes out of
such trite and effete legends as Whitting-
ton and his Booted Puss, Jack the Bean-
Stalker, Goody Glass-shoes and the Beast
icilli the Blue Beard, et hoc genus omne9"
Are they then ignorant that
there are innumerable stories
infinitely fresher and more iLj
suitable for Pautomimical pur-
poses in certain notorious
Indian literary Jwrs cFceu/eree?
Why not dig for such pearls
in the inexhaustible mines of
our Mahd Bhdrata, Bliogapra-
bandha, or even our Ganamc-
fjuja Pdgansdcali?
On this I suddenly recol-
lected a very fine saga which,
when that I was a tiny little
boy, was frequently recited
to me by some aunt or other,
and which might be plotted
out into a rather splendid
Pantomime. Being aware of
the proclivities of British Public for
thoroughly up-to-date treatment, I took
the precaution to ascertain from England
the titles &c. of the latest popular songs,
in order to incorporate same in my text.
I have now the honour to submit the
result, which I shall entitle :—
SHANG-GASBA;
OK, THE LUCKY HEKO WHO BECAME KINO'S
SON-IN-LAW.
The opening, "A Scenery in Celestial
Regions" (tltis, if at all liberally tin-
selled, will have the truly imposing
effect). Some ballet-dancings by a bevy
of Apsarasas (or Heavenly Nymphs).
While they pirouette and hover on aerial
wires, they are to melodiously chant,
"All the little ducks go quack-quack-
quack! And all their little wings go
flap-flap-flap!" &c.
To be followed by a lengthy argument
between a Deva (or Sky-Deity) and a
L'dkschasa (or evil daemon) as to whether
Kliang-gasba is to experience best of luck
or the peck of troubles. This is to
cause audience to split their sides with
uncontrollable cachinnations!
Next comes the Scenery of "An Open
Space in a Grove of Gambu-Trees."
The Hero, Shang-gasba, comes in and
has a fine soliloquy. He says his name
signifies "Renowned Possessor of Trea-
sure"—instead of which he is as impe-
cunious as a churched mouse! His
deceased Father had promised him that,
if he should only inter his bones in this
spot (formerly the site of Rich Ancestor's
family residence), he will infallibly
become mighty as a King's Son. Bones
have been cemetered as per instructions
—but unfortunate Son is still tormented
by the Pinch of Poverty. He longs for
death, and sings, "Give me a ticket to
Heaven, For that's where Dad's gone,
they say!"
Impromptu there enters a Magnificent
Procession of Elephants, Camels, &c.
(these can either be genuine or Imitation
articles), conducting Princess OirikA,
the beauteous and only brat of Vasu,
the King of MagadJm, home from [a
journey in a gorgeously-gilded palan-

"Yer 'at don't fit yer very well.
And yer trousers, ain't they baggy!"
quin. Sliang, bo-peeping from behind
a gambu-trunk, instantly falls a victim
to tender passion. Procession goes out:
Shamj resolves that, though he is such
a poor beggar, he will go to King and
request hand of Princess. Song, "Slie
is my only girl, my only girl!"
Change of Sceneries to "A Hill 011
which is the huge effigy of a Gamda
Bird." It is bedecked with costly silks
and stuffs in honour of Princess. Here,
perhaps, might be a Cake-walking Com-
petition by some Dakinis (or ghoulish
females). Then joyful populaces enter,
dancing and cockahooping for joy at
Princess's return. When they depart,
Shang enters. He is so esurient that
he devours greedily the " baling-cakes"
offered to said Garuda Bird, from
which he pulls off the silks, &c., and
conceals same in interior recesses .of his
ragged trouserings.—Next is "A Garish
Apartment in King Vasu's Palace, in
City of Yidanarajanapura."
King Vasu and his better half Queen
Gandltn (capital parts for Hon'ble*
Henry Randle and Danvers) are dis-
cussing Marriage of Princess. They
sing a comical duet, "Three are jolly
fine company1." and perform some
rather drollis'h antics. Then the Great
Princely Trumpet is heard blowing out-
side! "This must be some Princely
Suitor! Show him in, and send for
Princess!" This is done. Shang appears,
arrayed in shockingly seedy garbages.
Trio by King, Queen, and Princess,
"Yer 'at don't fit yer very well, And
yer trousers, ain't they baggy!"
Shang demands hand of Princess, who
exhibits superciliousness at his cheek.
Song by Shang, "What is the use of
loving a girl, if the girl iixm't love you?"
Queen Gandha pleads that lie may be
decapitated for such presumption. King
replies, "Pooh! he is merely a Beggar."
Then Princess Girikd says she is only
to wed a Prince so rich that he can
afford priceless underclothing. At this
Sliang sings, "Well, what's the, what'«
the, what'« the, what's the, what's the
matter with ME?" and pulls out of his
'baggy trousers all the stuffs
lie has stolen from Garuda
Bird. King is about to relent
— -but Queen (who is inimical
to Sliang) says, " Not so. First
he is to achieve some mighty
deed or other!" iS'., although
constitutionally by no means
a valorous, consents to per-
form any moderate heroism.
It appears a Prince of Unbe-
lievers is making war on King.
Sliang is to have an Army, a
fine warhorse, and bow and
arrows. If lie drives off Un-
believers, he is to be treated
as one of the Royal Family.
So dhang-gaeba, in severe
state of funkiness, gets up on
top of horse, and rides off with Army,
to fight Unbelievers.
Song by Queen Gandha, after his
departure, "They 'II soon make an angel
of him THERE !" and dance. . . .

This is only the beginning—and there
are much finer episodes to follow !—but,
it seems, I am not to be conceded anymore
space, though perhaps I may be permitted
to conclude my Pantomime in a subse-
quent issue. Should Hon'ble Sir Harry
Irving, or Beerbhoom Tree decide, from
above sample, to produce such a first-class
novelty, I may come over from Calcutta
(or mther Korea!) to impersonate the
character of Sliang-gasba in proprid per-
sona. What offers, Misters? H. B. J.
