RELAGE
It
is now six years and a half ago since Punch gave unexpected audience to a Wood Nymph of very genteel exterior. Punch
was then a way-farer in highways, and alleys, and bye-courts; and, caring not to enter upon the distracting duties of house-
keeping, he accommodated the
greatness that, by the way, he even then had strange, mysterious inkling of, to one small clean
garret; white-washed with a fine regard for the picturesque. Perhaps, like Ariel, when crammed into the pine, Punch was
compelled by Circumstance—the blue-eyed hag"—to limit himself to so small an abiding-place. We say, perhaps ; leaving
the doubt to be enlarged upon by the gossips Envy and Detraction.
A July sun beamed through the diamond casement, lighting up the whitewash with the splendours of the dawn—an
intermixture of the glories of crimson and golden yellow. Punch was in bed, with his eye upon a favourite patch in his many-
pattern quilt ; a patch that reminded him of a gown filled with many sweet associations—Punch was in bed, now with his

heart upon the patch, and now disturbed by the thoughts of a bad sixpence that had been accidentally flung to him from a
first-floor in Cavendish Square, only yesterday—when his attic door flew open with a musical twang, as from St. CECILIA's
broken harp-string.
Punch-ever alive to music-jumped upright in his bed ; and lo, at his right hand stood a Wood Nymph. And the
garret was suddenly filled with forest odours ; with the breath of violets, and a country green.” And the Wood Nymph began
to speak ; talking low and soft, like a winding forest stream.
All that the Nymph said to Punch—it is not for him, with his now proverbial character for all the courtesies and delicacy
of the natural gentleman—to utter to listening millions. It may—nay, it must—be sufficient for him to narrate that the Nymph
foretold to Punch that he was about to leave streets and lanes and bye-ways, and to undergo a new birth. “ You will go into
paper long-clothes, dear Punch," said the Nymph, "and be baptized with printer's ink.”
(Punch's dog, Tobr—lying outside on the mat—here uttered a prolonged howl ; but whether the dog hearing such
prophecy, intended to rejoice or mourn in such utterance, Punch cannot even now—after six years, six months' pondering-
satisfactorily declare.)
"Take this, Punch, and on the night of the day whereon you first appear in inky suit, sow the seed ; and then with
hopeful heart await the end.”
As the Nymph uttered these words, she took from her balmy bosom a fir cone, laying it in the hand of Punch.
"You have gone about the working-day world long enough. You have fulfilled the first part of your destiny," said the
Nymph with a sunny smile, and silver voice. You have learned wisdom in the street-give it paper pinions; to this end, that
they shall
like mercy's wings,
Bear round about the earth the fame of kings.'
“In the mean time sow the seed, and water the growth of the tree with the very best and purest, and most enduring ink."
And saying this, the Wood Nympli tripped from the bed-side of Punch, and as she retired there was a sound as of boughs
stirred by the summer wind waving farewell ; and, until this day, the lower stair-carpeting, (Punch's then landlady, a descendant
of Mrs. Quickly, to whom, it appears after all, Falstaff-much pressed for money-was privately married, is still prepared to
prove the fact), the lower carpeting still bears perennial forest-flowers, sown by the footsteps of the departing Dryad :
“Men may find the spring by following her."
Punch still held the fir-cone ceremoniously, timidly, in his hand-even as our gentle little QUEEN held the ball in her
coronation hour—and knew not what to make of it. However, the Wood Nymph's prophecy becoming a verity, Punch, on the
night of the 12th of July 1841, with many serious, significant rites, set the fragrant cone—for balsamic sweets oozed from
its hundred opening lips-in most fertile, most sustaining, most congenial earth.
And the cone-seed struck immediately; and it grew, and grew, and is now Punch's New Year's Fir-Tree-a most
faithful picture of which, in very little, flourishes, beholder, on the over page.
And the Tree being six years and a half old, Punch has received most authentic intelligence that the Wood Nymph was

Domestic Economy.
Young ladies who are fond
of practising domestic economy
upon a very small allowance,
cannot do so more rigidly than
by answering the advertise-
ments in which ladies' maids, in
want of good situations, offer
to attend and dress a lady's
head “upon trial.” By having
a fresh servant for
every
fresh
invitation, a young lady may
be able to have her beautiful
hair dressed in the very first
style of fashion all through the
season, without paying a single
sixpence for it. We doubt if
this economical plan will suc-
ceed, for more than one season;
but for its perfect success it
must be understood, that the
young lady is always to be
highly displeased
with the style
of coiffure which the poor maid
has exhibited as a proof of her
skill, and to be sure to say
peevishly, she has made her "a
perfect fright.”. This com-
plaint naturally dispenses with
the necessity of any apology for
not engaging her, or for any
other explanation on that head.

REFORM YOUR LAWYERS' BILLS.
A CURIOUS TASTE.
PRINCE WALDEMAR of Prussia has arrived in England. This noble
Prince is an amateur in the gentlemanly amusement of war. He
went in full dress to a battle-field, just as a person goes to the Opera,
for the sake of a little excitement. He attended the principal engage-
ments in India, in the handsomest manner, free of expense, and merely
because he had a taste that way. That which was death to others
was only_sport to him. We are afraid he will be disappointed in his
visit to England.
We have no battles to amuse him with: not even a public meeting
dispersed by the police, or a little Revolution, à la Française or
l'Espagnole, to distract him for half-an-hour. There is only the Siege of
Gibraltar at the Surrey Zoological Gardens, and that will be tame work
for him; as, at the very best, the list of the killed and wounded never
exceeds that of one of the nervous ducks on the lake, when the thread
of its existence is prematurely cut in two, during the fireworks, by a
Roman candle. A grand Review, too, however expensive, would be
unsatisfactory to a Prince who had revelled in real fighting; and
ASTLEY's, even supposing it were
to revive its memorable Campaign of
Scinde, would fail to please one who must be somewhat blasé in the
most finished scenes of war. We advise PRINCE WALDEMAR to pay a
visit to Algeria ; possibly the French may entertain him on that popular
'Théâtre de la guerre" with a few of those startling effects which have
made that department exclusively their own, and which, we are positive,
with an amateur of the Prince's critical refinement, only require to be
seen to be properly appreciated!”. Who knows but that PELISSIER
might get up another blaze of triumph,” expressly in honour of his
visit?

Che Laureate's Installation Ode,
AS (IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN) ORIGINALLY WRITTEN.
But she was a mere English lady; it is only kings and queens that our
courtiers of painters condescend to feel for.
Their slavishness is quite sick-

first Prince of Wales,' (my subject,
again); there is the 'White Ship
going down with King Henry's son
aboard;' there is King Henry
being informed of the death of his
son, by a little boy ;' 'King Charles
(that odious profligate) up in the
oak;' (again my subject). Some-
body will be painting Queen Boadi-
cea next, and saying I did not
invent that.

'Twas once the purpose of my song to preach
The deep religion of the solemn woods;
The lessons that abide in flowers to teach,
Of murmuring breezes to translate the speech,
The voices of the mountains and the floods.
Then I descended, Nature still in mind,
For contemplative verse a theme to find
In PETER BELL and BETTY Foy,
And in the lowest of our kind,
Even in an Idiot Boy.
Now deeper shall my strain be sunk
By way of a poetic prank,
Taking the smallest subject in,
Just as an Elephant with mighty Trunk
Picks up a little Pin.
From humblest Nature down I go
To something yet more low,
To glorify mere artificial Rank.

Hail! consort of our Gracious QUEEN,
ALBERT, Coburg's ornament !
Granta, with a pure intent,
Elects thee to her Chancellor's station;
Musing, with a joy serene,
Whilst she views thine exaltation-
Hymn we thine inauguration.
It were a commendation weak
To say in Latin thou wert skill'd,
In Hebrew, or in Greek,
Or with the lore of mathematics fill'd,
E'en were such praise thy due-
That is, if it were true:
But thou art better qualified
Than by pedantic learning, for the place
Thou art ordain'd to grace.
Yes; be it GRANTA's pride,
Not to accord to men of letters
The honour due unto their betters.
More highly did she look in choosing thee,
One who, if not a King,
He can be quite declared to be,
Is the next thing.
And though thou wearest not a crown,
(To Majesty alone belongeth that),
Thou own'st à coronet of high renown,
Thy memorable Hat.

THE “NO HOUSE” LAST WEEK.
"The attraction of the House of Commons fell to such a deplorable
ebb on Tuesday, the 29th of June, that there was a miserable show of
fourteen-enabling each side to sing "We are Seven,”-on the day, we
have mentioned. The usher felt poignantly the desertion of the legisla-
tive scene, and went about exclaiming, in a pun on a par with his depres-
sion of spirit, that "there is no getting no house nohows."
In order to prevent the inconvenience arising from the absence of
Members towards the close of the session, we recommend the engage-
ment of a band, or a popular vocalist, or a tumbler ; or if Sir ROBERT
PEEL would only condescend to go through some his extraordinary
evolutions on the political corde volante, or IL DIAVOLO DISRAELI would
take one of his audacious flights, there might always be a sufficient
audience to get through the business of the session, which is merely
formal at the close, and only wants the attendance of a certain number
of Members.
We merely throw out the above hint for the consideration of LORD
JOHN RUSSELL, to enable him to wind up the various matters that still
remain unfinished.
What in the Senate though thou hast no seat,
And canst not champion GRANTA's cause
And rights, against encroaching laws ?
Her sons, in choosing one so near the throne
For Chancellor, will find their own.
Thy voice, PRINCE ALBERT, is a voice of power,
And upon royal heads of houses, I
Already, in imagination, spy
Mitres descending in a shower.
Field-Marshal of the virgin blade,
(Though powder thou hast smelt at a Review,)
Should any one, as some men do,
From loyalty so widely swerve,
As to demand what thou hast done
Thine elevation to deserve.
Let not thy bosom be dismay'd,
Pursue the quiet course thou hast begun;
From day to day, to drive and dine,
The tranquil life be thine:
Still, with thy gun, throngh Windsor's woodlands roam,
Duly to lunch returning home.
With ample dignity adorn thy state,
Without exertion great;
And let thine eminence evince,
What mighty merit 'tis to be
One of the Royal Family ;-
A harmless, inoffensive Prince.

Parliamentary Life Insurance.
The utmost limit of parliamentary longevity is seven years. Various
casualties, however, may abridge the span of senatorial existence long
before the natural period of dissolution. Many gentlemen are now on
the eve of investing thousands in the acquisition (not to say purchase)
of seats in Parliament. We propose, therefore, that there should be
established a Parliamentary Life Insurance Office, to guarantee honour-
able members some return for their capital, should their representative
career, owing to the mutability of political affairs, be prematurely closed
by the Royal prerogative.

Princes, as they are born with silver spoons in their mouths, are
LOVE born also with scholarship in their heads. It was, therefore, very
right in the Cambridge authorities to make the HEREDITARY DUKE
OF SAXE WEIMAR, M. VAN DE WEYER, PRINCE WALDEMAR OF
PRUSSIA, His SERENE HIGHNESS PRINCE LOWENSTEIN, and His
DITTO PRINCE PETER OF OLDENBURG, Doctors of Civil Law, their
proficiency in that science
being indubitable.
To be sure, to make a Duke a Doctor is a sort of gilding refined
gold-a species of painting the lily-a kind of adding fresh perfume
to the violet. Still it is, on the part of a University like Cambridge,
a compliment to the illustrious personage. It is giving him all she
can, no more, though poor-very poor-the offering be. It is deli-
cately telling him, with a mathematical beauty quite Cantabrigian,
that the greater includes the less-the Duke the
Doctor. Compli-
ments, however, should be returned. There should be a reciprocity
between dons and dignitaries. “Caw me, caw thee,” should be a
maxim even in universities on this side of the Tweed. If fellows and
heads of houses create Princes honorary Doctors, Princes, on the
other hand, should make them honorary Officers. When the learned
gentlemen go to Court they should be appointed Brevet-Colonels.
Let there be a mutuality in dubbing. DR. WHEWELL has been
mainly instrumental in rendering PRINCE ALBERT a Chancellor.
PRINCE ALBERT, in recompense, should get Dr. WHEWELL con-
stituted, --not a Bishop, but-a Field-Marshal. This hint, we trust,
will be attended to in the proper quarter; and we shall expect to

“THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL."
This Comedy is certainly in fashion. It is not only being acted at
the Haymarket, to crowded houses, but is drawing immense audiences
at the Chamber of Peers, besides filling the entire town of Madrid,
which can talk of nothing else. We must say, however, that MONSIEUR
GIRARDIN, though he acts with a certain boldness, which makes parti-
cular points tell, does not get on very well, and that the QUEEN
ISABELLA is very far behind Mrs. NISBETT in the amount of applause
which she gains for supporting her arduous character. The supernu-
meraries, MESSRS. TESTE, CUBIÈRES, and other players of small parts,
though they took tremendously with the French at first, only offend the
taste of the public, now that their tricks in going in for strong effects
are found out; and we have no doubt that as soon as they have had a
fair trial, they will be dismissed from their engagements. The decora-
tions were very expensively got up at Paris; one of them did not cost
less than 80,000 francs; but they “hang." dreadfully, and are so very
dirty, that the public loudly condemn them.

DOMESTIC BLISS,
THE WATERMEN'S DINNER.
THOSE gallant fellows who risk the perils of
the deep, and the still greater perils of the shallow
-we mean the Watermen-dined together a few
days ago, when the LORD MAYOR presided as
Chairman. A true nautical spirit prevailed, and
CAPTAIN Tunks, of the Adelphi Squadron, pro-
posed the health of the “Thames and its Tribu-
taries;” which was acknowledged by a Commis-
sioner of Sewers, as the representative of the
Tributaries alluded to. A fine old nautical feeling
was shown in all the speeches, and an influential
mate, who has been half his days in the Daisy,
was heard to declare, “That, come what may,
there is room to make another Trafalgar at Green-
wich; and that, in case of an invasion, there would
be a Nelson on board every coal-barge, prepared
to light the fire of independence, from the mouth
of the Isle of Dogs to the extremest end of the
Eel Pies.” This sentiment was loudly cheered
by all present; and, the party having drunk “The
Thames," with the utmost enthusiam, retired.

We are told by the papers, that the corn crops

this golden promise, which at present is only

The herald of his triumph-drawing nigh,
Half-whispered in John's ear, “I promise thee
“Three per Cents above par, and prosperous trade.”
He spoke, and laughed; I shut my eyes for
fear,
But when I look'd, John BULL had raised his arms,
And I beheld grim BENTINCK’s angry eyes,
And RUSSELL’s puzzled stare, as they withdrew,
Gloomily, each under his special cloud-
And I was left alone within the bower.
The Judgment of John Bull.
(AFTER TENNYSON.)
Then to the bower they came,
Where sat the Shepherd, glorious in his boots-
A stalwart piece of man; and in his hand
The ministerial apple, golden, glowed.
Then first was heard the voice of him, to whom,
Cantering o'er Epsom Downs, the very Legs
Rise up in reverence. He unto JOHN BULL
Proffered Protection, ample gifts, all round;
To farmers high-priced corn, to labourers
Enormous wages, wherewithal to buy
The high-priced corn; to merchants heavy freights;
To everybody everything; and all
Was proved by figures, crammed with time and toil.
Still he spake on, still of Protection spake,
So glib, that JOHN BULL held the costly fruit
Out at arm's-length, so much the Stable Mind
Flattered his ear; when RUSSELL, where he stood,
Somewhat apart-defiance in his eye,
But in his mien a wavering, as of one
Who takes the run to leap, but leapeth not,
With cold and formal utterance made reply :-
Whig Ministers, Whig measures, Whig control,
These three alone lead on to perfect bliss;
And this I promise thee, if mine the fruit,
Unintermittent blessing
of Whig rule,
And all that follows it-But where the need
Of words ? Thou knowest, from experience sweet,
Already what I am, and mine."
He ceased,
And JOHN BULL pondered, and I cried “Oh, JOHN,
Give it not to the Whigs !” He winked,
and cried,
Don't they wish they may get it !” and therewith
My mind was eased – I knew him up to snuff.
But Peel, the third, of stately embonpoint,
And with a subtle smile in his mild eyes,
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
TAE COMMON SERJEANT, alias The CENTRAL COURT SLASHER, can
be backed at any odds, and to any amount, to perform the following
judicial feat:-
He will run through ten cases, bully five counsel, jump over a dozen
legal difficulties of any size, blindfold; puzzle three juries, and pick up
ten observations from the sitting alderman, within the four hours.
The SLASHER is open to make a match at verdicts, or judicial knock-
'em-downs, against all the Bench-magistrates in game-preserving
counties to give him the odds.
The SLASHER has heard a good deal of chaff about ALDERSON, the
EXCHEQUER PET, alias The BOUNCING BARON. If the BARON means
business, the SLASHER can be backed to talk unseasonable nonsense,
and crack jokes out of place, against the Pet or any thing in West-
minster Hall
, for any amount the BARON's friends like to name.
The SLASHER's money is always ready at the Old Bailey, where
judicial customers, who want to make "slanging matches, can at all
times be accommodated.
SOMETHING FOR THE NEXT CAMBRIDGE EXAMINATION PAPER.
“What is a Don ?” asked a little child, who had heard the word
mentioned several times in an account of the Installation. “Why, my
dear,” answered the puzzled father, “I don't know, but from this
account of what they did at Cambridge, I should say that a Don is
half a Donkey."

PUNCH'S
OWN
PICTURE.

T8
I wish I had had time to finish it; England will never know what
High Art really is till it has seen Punch's
own historical picture, thirty
five feet by ten, painted by the aid of a ladder.
Punch's subject is Gascoigne committing Prince Henry for gross con-
tempt of Court. The work unites all styles and schools. It is as full of
action as ARMITAGE, as full of costume as CORBOULD, as full of
MICHAEL ANGELO-drawing as Watts. This is the true principle of
regeneration for modern Art. How can a picture fail to be good when
it is made up of scraps from everything that is best ? If the whole is
equal to its parts, a number of good parts must make a good whole.
My Chief Justice is a great deal larger than life, taking the pro-
portions of the rest. This is to give him dignity. My Prince, you
see, is squaring, in a sort of half-sportive, half-sporting defiance of
the Court and his officers. He has just administered his “
one,
two," to the Chief Justice, and is thrown back on his guard. BENJAMIN
CAUNT, Esq., stood for the figure. The costume, I flatter myself,
is correct. The dress was furnished by Titchborne-Street NATHAN,
and cost £50! My Ushers I have painted naked, and very muscular.
This is necessary to the ideal treatment, and redeems the literalness
of the costume of my principal figure. ETTY has gone on the same
principle in his Joan of Arc, where we have soldiers of the fifteenth
century dressed like savages of the South Seas, in waistcloths, et
præterea nihil. I flatter myself there are few finer backs than that
of my head Usher. You will see something like it in the Cartoon of
PISA. We don't grow such backs now-a-days.
Altogether, let the young artist study this picture. It is my artistic
theory exhibited in practice. PRINCE ALBERT can hardly be persuaded
to quit my atélier. MR. ROGERS disputes with Toby the honour of
cleaning my palette and preparing my colours. The Commissioners
of the Fine Arts are buzzing round me and bidding against each
other as I write this description. But they shan't have it. It shall be
presented to the Nation, when the new National Gallery is built. My
pen and pallette, in a gold framework, shall be copied below the
picture. Punch is not ungrateful.
IN
THE ST. STEPHEN'S BILLS OF MORTALITY.
WE regret to state that the week's returns exhibit an awful mortality
among the infant Bills. An increase in the number of these deaths is
always to be expected about this time, but this year the advance in the
rate of premature dissolutions is appalling. Much of this is to be attri-
buted to the extreme carelessness of parents, as well as to the consti-
tutional weakness of the Bills themselves, and the overcrowding to
which they are exposed. There is, in fact, no part of Westminster which
stands so much in need of stringent sanatory regulations as St. Stephen's.
The system of its legislative offspring will never be healthy until both
Houses are thoroughly drained of the noxious stuff that is allowed to
accumulate there during the session, nor, indeed, until they have under-
gone general purification and enlightenment. The state of the Com-
mittee Rooms is especially disgraceful to those to whom the comfort of
the working classes” is intrusted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
a New Arcadia.
Among the splendid projects of the present highly projective age, is
a concern to be called Arcadia. The first means by which it is hoped
Arcadia may be realised will be the Arcadian simplicity of the public,
who are required to put down at once five pounds, before they can be
eligible to this land of enchantment. Arcadia will be under the direction
of a committee of shepherds, who are to get subscribers by hook and
by crook. There are to be pleasant rides and drives, with a circular
course for equestrians," so that Astley's and Fairy Land may be com-
bined in the same establishment. “Rural amusements” are also to be
available to the subscribers, who will have the privilege of running in
sacks, or hopping the twig, whichever may be most convenient. The
grounds will comprise a Lake, made of real water, with real fish; and a
mattress is already laid down to form a real oyster-bed. A profusion of
mussels, cockles, periwinkles, and other shell-fish will be provided for
those addicted to piscatory pursuits; and the public will only be ex-
pected to shell out in return for the valuable privilege.
The following is, however, the richest sentence in the whole pro-
spectus, which is now before us :-
“The advantages of THE ARCADIA in a political point of view will be considerable, as
the property of the society will give to every member the right of voting for the county."
It would, we think, be a pity to destroy the harmony that ought to
prevail in Arcadia by the introduction of the elements of political
discord. We can fancy the suburban Elysium placarded with demands
for Free Trade, or with posting bills announcing COCHRANE and PAYNE,
under the soubriquet of arcades ambo, as candidates worthy the support
of Arcadia. We do not see the necessity of another Arcadia for

THE STATUE
AGAIN.
GOVERNMENT will not suffer
the Monster Statue to be re-
moved "on public grounds."
We suggest, therefore, that it
be put up to auction amongst
the Duke's admirers, and
knocked down to whomsoever
bids highest. It might then be
erected on private grounds-per-
haps in some nobleman's park or
garden, or corn-field, or orchard,
and so be hidden from public
view. By the bye, the objection
strikes us as being very ground-
less, considering the Statue is up
in the air, and not on any ground
at all, unless the few flower-pots
belonging to the gatekeeper of

A SINGLE gentleman assures us, that out of
500 answers he received to an advertisement

500 concluded with the assurance that “A. B.
would meet with the comforts of a home.”
The latter assurance, he says, was carried out
rather too strictly in many instances; for in
174 houses he was refused “the use of a

And confidence I be,

That you 'll re-member me.
I cannot ask for your support,

in London, and who will consider the experience and practice of such as equivalent to
a salary. An apprentice who has served the greater part of his time will be suitable.
Apply to A. B., Gracechurch-street, City.
To be an assistant to a practitioner amongst the solvent classes, it is
considered necessary to know a great deal of medicine and midwifery.
The assistant of the medical officer of a union, it seems, need only know
"something” of those sciences. For the former vocation, a gentleman
who has passed the “Hall and College” is required; for the latter, an
apprentice is esteemed suitable. Of course, therefore, the practice of
medicine among the poor is quite a different matter from what it is
among the rich. It must be so, if an apprentice will do for paupers-
as there is every reason to believe he will. He will thus carry out the
great object of the Poor Law, the cure of pauperism itself. He will do
much, at any rate, for the relief of that malady, by striking at the root
of it-over-population.

THE MISHAPS OF MINISTERS;
A SONG FOR THE PREMIER.
AIR“ The College Hornpipe.”
At the opening of the Session I declared, with frank confession,
My dismay and consternation at the work I had to do;
But I hardly apprehended, that when Parliament was ended,
I should find so very little I had managed to get through.
There's my scheme of Education, to the welfare of the nation
The only measure I have carried likely to conduce;
And that is not extensive, I am sadly apprehensive,
Enough to prove of any mighty benefit or use.
My accounts when I examine, I perceive on Irish famine
I have spent about a dozen million sterling pounds or so;
For the whole of which outgoing—an amount that we are owing-
'Twill be next to nothing, I'm afraid, that we shall have to show.
And this outlay is suggestive of taxation in perspective,
Of a vista upon which JOHN BULL must shudder but to look ;
How to answer him quite puzzled, I shall feel completely muzzled,
When brought before that much enduring gentleman to book.
And my Prisons Bill thus founder'd, whilst I blunder'd and I flounder'd,
And my Railway Regulation Bill ne'er lived to be a law.
And, by MORPETH vainlycherish'd,
thus my Health of Towns Bill perish’d,
Through BENJAMIN DISRAELI's, and Joe HUME's, and BENTINCK’s jaw.
Last of all, with empty fiat-floored in everything I try at !-
I declared the DUKE OF WELLINGTON's huge statue should come down;
There, again, my words I've eaten, and been regularly beaten,
Just as though it were the sum of my miscarriages to crown:
So that, having failed in all things, both in great as well as small things,
I begin almost to fancy I'm mistaken in my line;
And my place and situation, as the pilot of the nation,
I'm really more than half inclined to think I must resign.
THE BONDHOLDERS' STRIKE.
The Spanish Bondholders wish England to go to war to recover
their debts. We certainly think the S. B.'s should be paid, and paid in
full, but then we do not see why we should fight their battles. We
can only remind them of a celebrated line, which doubtless they have
heard before, which commences by asking " Hereditary Bondsmen” if
they would be free ;-and concludes by telling them, if that is their
desire, that "they themselves must strike the blow”-only probably
the Hereditary Bondsmen of Spain would get more if they were to
strike a docket.
All the Bills of my proposing, their career untimely closing,
Poor unhappy little infants ! have been smother'd in their birth.
Of my Irish Lands Encumber'd Bill, the minutes thus were number'd,
My Electors Bill thus prematurely turn’d, alas ! to earth.

NOVEL AMUSEMENT.
SOME questions having been asked in the House of Commons as to
the alleged practice of branding deserters, we are happy to find, from
MR. Fox MAULE, that the operation is rather an amusement than a
punishment. The honourable gentleman explained that it is nothing
more than pricking in marks upon the flesh with the point of a needle
which he seems to regard in the light of an agreeable excitement to
which sailors very frequently addict themselves. We know that there
are odd tastes in the world, and that some people go so far as to throw
themselves under the wheels of the car of Juggernaut, as well as in-
dulge in other mad freaks, involving more or less personal inconvenience;
but whether the submission to this sort of thing is voluntary or invo-
luntary, makes exactly all the difference. If this branding, or, as MR.
Fox MAULE calls it, tattooing, is really the luxury he describes it to
be, he can have no objection to undergo the operation, and thus afford
a convincing proof of his sincerity in describing it as no punishment.
It is not quite
so bad, perhaps, as flogging; for the drummers who ad-
minister the stripes may be said indeed to "beat the tattoo” in the
style of castigation they are called upon to inflict; but let MR. Fox
MAULE call it by what name he may, this branding is a stain upon

Navy, in more senses than one, and Punch demands its abandonment.

THE MINISTERIAL WHITEBAIT DINNER.
HERE has not appeared a full report of the Ministerial Whitebait Dinner,
nor can we so far violate the sanctity of hospitality, or stain the damask
table-cloth of social intercourse, as to reveal all we saw and heard at the
banquet to which we had the compliment paid us of being invited. LORD
JOHN RUSSELL was absent, having, as he said, experienced baiting enough
from his late constituents; and LORD PALMERSTON had a pretty kettle of
fish to attend to at the Foreign Office. The toasts were rather select than
numerous; but the memory of all the late lamented Bills was drunk in solemn
silence. When the Health of Towns Bill was given from the chair, LORD
MORPETH, as chief mourner, pronounced a funeral oration, the rest of the
Ministers looking on as mutes; while the song, "I have a silent sorrow
here," was given by the vocalists. The party was exceedingly lugubrious;
for nearly every Member present had lost some dear departed Bill, on which
he had set his heart and hopes at the commencement of the session. The
members of the Cabinet who were present were all dressed in the deepest
black, and some very stirring remarks were made upon the unfeeling conduct
of LORD BROUGHAM, in having routed many of the unfortunates out of their
resting-places, with the merciless alacrity of a resurrectionist. The fate of
the Health of Towns Bill, so young, so strong, and so promising, appeared
to excite the deep commiseration of all present.
A New Discovery.
A WEALTHY dairyman has left London for Dover, with the full determina-
tion to purchase, if he can, every bit of SHAKSPEARE's Cliff
. He is positive
that it is the very kind of chalk that is wanted for making the “milk of
human kindness”--the only milk our dairyman, during a life of many trials
and mixtures, has not succeeded in making. If he does succeed, his “ new
milk” will come in most kindly for the rejected candidates; for chalk is
considered the very best cure for heartburn.

SINCE the stir that has been made on the

its price will be enhanced to such a degree, that
the praiseworthy object of preserving it from the

There are already six parties in the field, deter-
mined to buy SHAKSPEARE's house at anycost,
and rescue it from the coarse clutch of competi-

anxiety they evince to procure the house, the
more likely they are to run it up, and render it

FORTUNE.
SCENE-Richmond Park.
A LITTLE GENTLEMAN, with an election riband in his button-hole, and triumph in his countenance, is approaching the Lodge. He is met by a pretty
woman in Gipsy attire, though not with Bohemian complexion and features.
Gipsy. Shall I tell you your fortune, my little gentleman ?
(The LITTLE GENTLEMAN, with a jaunty air snaps his fingers, as though he knew his fortune, and was very well satisfied with it.)
Gipsy. Cross my hand with a five-shilling piece-for I can't take anything under the crown from you-and I'll tell you your fortune.
A five-shilling piece, my, good iittle gentleman.
(As if for the joke of the thing, the LITTLE GENTLEMAN crosses the Gipsy's palm with a dollar, and then spreads his hand.)

so,
Gipsy. Well, sir, I can see at once, that you've often played at cards ; and though you've often held a good many trumps in your hand,
yet you've as often been beat, by not knowing how to lead 'em! Is it not little gentleman ?-
You've had a good deal of trouble of late; and all about aprons. They've led many a noble gentleman to ruin; and I can tell you,
sir-if
you will keep a playing with aprons-specially silk ’uns—and lawn sleeves, you ’re a lost little gentleman.-
In a few months you 'll go to a certain house, where you 'll find a good many friends, and a good many enemies. You've just lost three or
four very dear friends. There's a friend lost in Edinburgh ; and there's another gone in Surrey; and another and another beside, as sure as
them 's church rooks over our heads, a flying to Lambeth.
I can see that when you get into good company–which isn't always-you are very loth to leave it. You sits up very late, little gentleman;
and sometimes listens to a good deal of bad language; which you don't care for–because why ?-you've heard so much of it. -
There's a dark man, with curly hair, and a narrow-rimmed hat, from Buckinghamshire, as means you no good. He'll be sticking his words
into you-as if you was no more than a bran pincushion-but there's a good deal in truth when you can come at it, which isn't often, and
isn't seldom, as the stars may be.-
You must be aware of another man from Lynn. He doesn't bear you no good mind, neither. He wishes above all things to get your place,
little gentleman; but them as lives will see more than them that's called away; and it isn't everybody that's called to kiss the QUEEN's hand is
a SOLOMON, as happened to SHEBA, as--in course as a Christian and a friend to the 'stablished Church, little gentleman, you knows.-
You ’ve a sweet tooth in your head, little gentleman, that you have-and there's a line in your hand that tells me you'll have a good
deal of trouble about sugar. But there's nothing so sweet as a good conscience, which is worth more than ninepence a pound, hard or soft ;
and you may go to sleep upon that, little gentleman, without a nightcap to cover you.-.
I hope, little gentleman, you'll not be by any means angered at what I'm a going to say--but there's lines in your hand that tells me
you 're very fond of putting it in other people's pockets. 'You'll be trying this on again I'm
afeard you will —when I wouldn't give a brass

your sitivation. There's one bit of luck, however, to folks of your sort-you ’re never hanged for it.-
There's a good deal of trouble in store for
you about brooms, and soap-and-water, and clean linen, and towels, and basins, and so forth.
But what's a dirty face to a clean repitation? What is man but dirt ? And puff up soap and water as you will, what is it but a bubble ?-
You 'll have a good many people, little gentleman, coming about you a begging and a praying and a threatening you to take the money off
their windows. And perhaps you will, and perhaps you won't: but whatever money you take off people's windows, you'll more than put upon
people's spectacles.-
As I said, where you're a going you'll meet with a good many enemies; but yon 'll also meet with one good friend; and a good friend is
richer than goold, brighter than di'monds, and sweeter than honey. He's a friend, little gentleman, you may always trust. A fair man;

excitement at the scene; and, stepping in with a whoop and a hurroo, he began to
dance with such a rapidity as made all present stare.
As the couple were footing it, the noise might be as of a rapid cavalcade traversing
the Place Vendôme, and stopping at the Marquis's door. A crowd appeared to
mount the stair; the great doors of the reception-room_were flung open, and two
pages announced their Majesties the Emperor and the Empress. So engaged were

approach.

Marquis’s windows lighted up, proposed to the Empress to drop in on the party. He

Ether and Humming Bees.
THE Globe states that “some successful
experiments have been recently made in
France on the etherization of bees, so as
to be able to take their honey whilst they are
in a state of inaction, without the necessity
of destroying their lives.” It is much to
be wished that some process could be in-
vented for the etherization of the British
Bee, which, in a state of industry, feels the
subtraction of its honey, most acutely.
Would that a species of etherization could
be devised which would render JOHN BULL

They have discovered, it appears, at the

others statistical articles, filled with heaps of is of , and the most
vulgar fractions; whilst one genius submitted to us the first part of a
new tale (the scene was laid at the North Pole), to be completed in

well worth our while. Correspondents must send us their cheque-books,

GEOLOGY IN THE STRAND.
The state of the Strand is becoming so alarming through the fre-
quency of eruptions, that we have serious thoughts of sending for a
geologist to ascertain the cause. We begin to fancy_that there must be
an exhausted volcano on the west side of Temple Bar, for we cannot
believe that the continual outbreaks of flame and water can be the result

There was a shriek of terror from the whole of the French army, and I should PUNCH'S REPORT ON THE DECORATIONS OF THE
NEW HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.
OUR opinion upon the recommendations of the Commissioners,
as contained in their seventh Report, is so very unsatisfactory,
that we beg to furnish a few suggestions of our own. As we find
that the subjects are not necessarily limited by the restrictions
of historical accuracy, we beg to propose, as a grand series of
tableaux, the magnificent incidents in the domestic life of
anonymous royalty described by the nursery poet.
The King counting his money in the counting-house would
furnish an opportunity for the introduction of the coins of the
period, with a degree of finish and elaboration which would
blend roundness of outline with minuteness of detail. The
Queen in the parlour, eating bread and honey, would give scope
for the talents of TURNER, whose dabs of honey on bread
would form fit companions for the lobster salads in which he
will go down to posterity: The Maid in the garden, hanging
out the clothes, might be taken advantage of to perpetuate the
memory of some of the costumes of our ancestors; including
the famous surcoat, pierrepoint, and gauntlets, of which

think at least forty thousand guns were levelled at me in an instant. But as the
muskets were not loaded, and the cannon had only wadding in them, these facts,
I presume, saved the life of PHIL. FOGARTY from this discharge.
Knowing my horse, I put him at the EMPEROR's head, and Bugaboo went at
it like a shot. He was riding his famous white Arab, and turned quite pale
as I came up, and went over the horse and the EMPEROR, scarcely brushing
the cockade which he wore.
“Bravo!” said MURAT, bursting into enthusiasm at the leap.
“Cut him down !” said Sieyès, once an Abbé, but now a gigantic Cuirassier;
and he made a pass at me with his sword. But he little knew an Irishman on
an Irish horse. Bugaboo cleared SIEYÈs, and fetched the monster a slap with
his near hind hoof which sent him reeling from his saddle,-and away I went,
with an army of a hundred-and-seventy-three thousand eight hundred men at
my heels.
CRACKED VOICES.
A LIVELY REGATTA.
THE “stable mind” which presides over the Parliamentary representation
of King's Lynn, has shown itself in a placard which“Our Own Correspondent”
has sent up to us. The document is apropos of a Regatta, which promises to be
a most lugubriously lively affair, for the Mayor “desires to express a hope that
the shops in the town will be closed.” His Worship wishes, in fact, the place
to assume the aspect of a funeral, by way of promoting the gaiety of the scene. “Oh! WoT A SHAME! THEY'VE BEEN AND SPIKED ALL THE POSTES."
The Committee go beyond even the Mayor in absurdity, for they "request that
all Boats may remain stationary during the Race.”!!! What an exciting
affair a Regatta consisting of a race by stationary boats must prove! We pre-
sume the contest will be left to the decision of the tide and wind, for the boats
cannot be utterly stationary, notwithstanding the request of the Committee for
“promoting the Regatta," that the craft should be as motionless as our friend THERE have been “Voices from the Crowd,” and “Voices

THE joyous celebration of the birth-days of the juvenile

residence will exhibit an uninterrupted succession of merri-

will render it at last one unbroken round of gaiety, and the

sun, in its capacity of servant of all-
work, began to clear away, and the fog
was bundled out of sight in less than
half-an-hour. The squadron baving got
as far as Dartmouth, darted unexpectedly
into the mouth of the bay, where MR. J. B. SMITH, an old inhabitant
--the oldest, no doubt-happened to be at his dessert, and, snatching
off the table a plate of mulberries, ran alongside the royal yacht with
his luscious burden.
There was something so novel in the congratulations of a town like
Dartmouth being presented in a plate of mulberries, that the compli-
ment was graciously received, and the mulberries went down much
better than the dry addresses which are usually forthcoming on these
occasions. The old inhabitant, who had brought such an odd emblem
of a nation's love, was asked up on to the quarter-deck, and each member
of the Royal Family, pressing simultaneously a mulberry to the lip,
acknowledged the refreshing proofs of the gracious satisfaction derived
from such a singŅlar sign of affectionate loyalty. When the Mayor
and Corporation heard of the incident, they came running to the side
of the yacht, with more mulberries, in the hope of being honoured by
an equally gracious reception; but the QUEEN, good - humouredly,
remarked that the children had had quite as many mulberries as would
do them good, and, thanking the Mayor and Corporation all the same,
declined
seeing them.
Poor EARL GREY, who, from the first of the voyage, has looked very
blue, being anything but a nautical character, in spite of six lessons
from T. P. COOKE before starting, took the opportunity of running on
shore, and walked about the town all day, rather than remain on
board longer than was absolutely required.

“whether the people were all Scilly people who lived there?”

DOMESTIC BLISS.
A WIND-FALL FOR THE PENNY-A-LINERS.
The public has recently been amused and flabbergasted
by an account of a tremendous fall of Lady-birds at Mar-
gate, where the little animals were said to have lain an inch
thick on the Pier. Though we attribute the alleged density
to the penny-a-liners, who will go through thick and thin
for the sake of a paragraph, we may, however, congratulate
the craft on an accession of new materials, for the Lady-
birds certainly present a wind-fall that will make an agree-
able change from the showers of Frogs, early Gooseberries,
and monster Cabbages, that the genius of the penny-a-
liner has hitherto been obliged exclusively to cultivate.
The Lady-birds will, of course, go the round of the public
prints, two or three times a year, and the paragraphist,
will henceforth be enabled to get an occasional crust from
the crustaceous little creatures who have lately landed at
the Piers of Margate and Ramsgate.

A Literary Hash.
One of our contemporaries, in a musical criticism full of
the rhapsodies so common in these days, speaks of the
gentle languor of “ Poggi Amor.” Of course, any amor that
happens to be poggi mụst be in a somewhat languid state,
for briskness and pogginess are quite incompatible. This
comes of the dreadful hodge-podge that the musical critics
have lately been making of it.
A GOOD SUGGESTION.
It has been urged, in defence of our public monuments,
that, bad as they are, they will eventually pave the way to
something better. For our own parts, we should be very
glad to see them paving the way to anything, for at present
the stone of which they are constructed is completely

PARLIAMENTARY FAGS.
Krivhtes of vo Shyra
A
URING the last week or two a schoolmaster has been advocating the
blessings of fagging in public schools. It makes the child, he says, a
good and kind-hearted man. What is good for the child, therefore,
must be good for the Member of Parliament. We think some of the
old Members might take some of the young ones as their fags. They
might keep their
seats for them when they wanted to run to BELLAMY'S
for a chop, and hunt up cases, and invent figures, and prepare occasion-
ally an effective little speech for them upon the relative consumption of
kitchen pokers and sherry-cobblers in Kamschatka, whenever that
subject comes before the House, which it is sure to do some day. They
would instruct them, also, to cheer very loudly when they addressed the
House, and how to laugh in the proper places. They would give them
lessons as to the most parliamentary way of receiving a deputation, and
how to crow 'and bark, and sneeze and cough, and bray at the right
moment. The fags, in fact, would relieve the old Members of the most
arduous part of their duties, and the Members, in return, would do their
utmost to teach them all the arts of legislature, so that in time they
might become good and useful Members of Parliament. We think the
fag system would answer much better in St. Stephen's than at Win-
chester; though this belief, we are aware, lays us open to a long letter
from the Head Master of that establishment, in which he will endeavour
to prove, of course, that boys are naturally fond of bullying, and that
tyranny is the very best school for youthful morals.
COBDEN and MORPETH might send round circulars to the juvenileM.P.'s,
that they have a vacancy for a good active young fag, but that, con-
sidering the opportunities of distinguishing himself, a small premium
would be required. There is a N.B., however, which they had better
be rather particular about. We mean the time-honoured exception,
“No Irishman need apply;" for a fag like MR. SMITH O'BRIEN would
be rather an awkward customer to deal with. SPOONER, HUME, and
NEWDEGATE might take articled fags for nothing, and be glad to get
them.

of his arguments in defence of fagging is thus stated :-
with the Company, on payment of an increased rate, two troubadours,
or double service, may be laid on during the height of the season.
"Where a large number of boys, from 10 to 18 years old, are assembled together, there
is, independently of all institutions, a great danger that strength will often overrule and
tyrannise over weakness."
The wrong, then, according to DR. MOBERLY, that cannot be pre-
vented, should be legalised. Let us give his argument a corollary :-
“Where a large number of people, from years of discretion upwards, coexist, there is,
independently of all institutions, great danger that ruffianism and dishonesty will com-
mit outrages and crimes."
Murder and theft are inevitable; therefore allow assault, battery,
and swindling. “What can't be cured," says the proverb,"must be
endured." DR. MOBERLY goes beyond the adage; his maxim is, that
what can't be checked should, to a certain extent, be encouraged.
With these remarks we dismiss, for the present, the subject of
fagging ; a practice of which, we hope, we have arrived at the fag-end

MARGATE AND ITS TELESCOPES.
TAKING advantage of the rapidity of steam communication, which
enables one to go to Margate and back on the same day, and, landing on
the end of the jetty, walk to the top and return in time for the starting
of the steamer on its voyage home, we threw our sandwich-box-our
only luggage-into the hold, and were soon steaming it in the Red
Rover, CAPTAIN LARGE-Larger than ever, by the bye-past the Bay of
old Herne, till we arrived at Margate.
The landlords' party must be regarded as being in the ascendant
throughout Margate, and nearly every one is interested as a landlord,
either in four stories or two, which are divided into separate
holdings, for terms varying from a week, or even a day, to a month
The relations between a landlord and his tenantry are
thus by no means permanent. The whole place may, in fact, be said
to derive its entire population from a system of temporary emigration,
which lasts during a short portion of the year, and at its conclusion
the landlords are left to their own resources, which are limited in
the extreme. Many of the landlord party prefer wintering in a large
building, called the Union, and leave their own domains perfectly
uninhabited until the return of their tenantry is expected.
To tempt
this class, a few beds are cultivated, but beyond this the native
industry of the Margatonians does not extend. These beds are the
chief sources from which the landlords raise their means of support.
The anxiety to draw attention to these beds is so excessive, that their

approves. We must not, however, blame the Margate landlords, who
rush naturally enough to the most gigantic telescopes, or to anything
else, indeed, that may improve their somewhat wretched look-out. It
is understood that they use the wrong end of the telescope to look at
pieces of butter,
remains of cold meat, and other articles belonging to
their tenants, which articles are of course reduced to mere mouthfuls,
too insignificant to be accounted for, by the peculiar manner in which
they are viewed. Thus the telescope serves a double purpose in the hand
of the ingenious native of Margate.

existence is notified at every turn to the stranger; and even the buoys
in the sea are adorned with announcements of "Beds, Beds,
"Beds.". This practice is by no means so ridiculous as it may at first
appear, for the buoys are most appropriately used to call attention to
those beds which enable the inhabitants to keep themselves above
water. A couple of beds form, in fact, a sort of life-buoy for the
summer season, preventing the unhappy native from being completely
swamped.
From the aspect of Margate in the height of the season it might be
imagined that an invasion was expected, and that the inhabitants were
prepared for the reception of some foreign enemy, by making a port-
hole of every window, and defending it with a huge gun. The different
directions in which these massive machines appear to be aiming would
seem to indicate that Margate was determined to be prepared for
X
invasion at all points. It is only on a very close inspection that the
truth can be ascertained, that these extraordinary engines, with which
Margate seems to bristle in the summer or autumn sun, are not cannons
at all, but telescopes, through which the inhabitants are keeping a
constant look-out, to count the passengers on the steam-boats, and

Tooke to write another History of Prices, for the fluctuations

seize their numerous varieties. The greatest and most sudden
changes exist at the present moment in omnibus fares, which
alter at the discretion of the cad; and though you may see a
quotation of twopence when you enter a bus, it is ten to one
that you will find yourself done at sixpence when you are
descending from the vehicle.
An omnibus with a twopenny quotation at the beginning
of your journey, increases its rate - not in speed, but in
charge-as you proceed; and the shorter the distance, the
more you have to pay for it. The beautiful system of jugglery
pursued in reference to the geographical position of Charing
Cross, renders it a convenient land-mark for warranting a
double charge; so that whether the bus is entered at the
Bank or Hyde Park Corner, there is always an excuse, by
murmuring out something about Charing Cross, for making
a demand of sixpence. In these hard times of competition,
when omnibuses are cutting each other's throats, and split-

VESUVIUS IN THE STRAND.
THERE is something in the Strand, between St. Clement's
Church and Temple Bar, which reminds us strongly of Italy
and Vesuvius. In the street, there is always an eruption of the
pavement, while the smoking cauldron of the gasman gives a
continual representation of an ever-burning crater. To add
to the illusion, the workmen-if we may be allowed the term,
in reference to those who do scarcely any work—are under the
influence of a dolce far niente which is truly Neapolitan in its
aspect. They sit for hours, lounging at the side of the eruption,
like the very laziest of lazzaroni, or playing those Ethiopian
airs on the bones and slates, which remind one forcibly of the
accompanied Tarantella of sunny Napoli. Vedi the Strand e
poi mori, may soon become a proverb; for really, to see the
indolence of the St. Clement's gas or water-pipe repairers is
enough to be the death of us. Such complete otium sine dig.
—for they seldom put a spade or pickaxe into the ground for
days after the first eruption—is, we are sure, unparalleled
everywhere. The earth is allowed to break up, and then to
have a holiday for
an indefinite period. We are sure that the
chasms of Fleet Street, the Strand, and other places, will
never be permanently filled up, until some citizen has tumbled
into them. Would that SIR PETER LAURIE would make him-
self a CURTIUS, and jump into the midst of it; which, as some
ill-natured people say-we, of course, being excused' from all
suspicion, -would be too much of a good thing, for it would
be getting rid at once of two nuisances.

GEORGE CRUIKSHANK'S “BOTTLE."
PROTECTIONIST ESSEX CALVES.
THE Times lately reported a grand Protectionist Demonstration which
took place at Colchester, and which was highly calculated to astonish
the Colchester natives. This grand turn-out was intended to celebrate
a turn-out of another description—that of the opponents of SIR JOHN
TYRRELL and MAJOR BERESFORD at the late election. The tom-foolery
commenced by Sir JOHN and the MAJOR making a triumphal entry into
the town. Our contemporary relates that
“A large cortège was formed at Lexden, a mile hence on the London road, consisting
of several hundred horsemen wearing blue favours, many carriages, and a variety of
other vehicles."
These other vehicles, we are informed, were donkey-carts, drawn,
with a proper self-appreciation, by their respective proprietors. To
these vehicles was added
"An allegorical device, which attracted considerable attention, from its quaint and
espressive character. It consisted of a waggon, painted and adorned with the party-
colour.”
Most appropriately. Party-colour, or motley, could have been the
only wear of the procession; and it was fit that their waggon should
be painted to match. In the party-coloured waggon
"Were several select specimens of farm servants of both sexes, sheaves of wheat, oats,
and barley, a churn, sacks of grain, &c. Immense large loaves of wheaten bread, a pon-
derous cheese, farm-yard poultry (in cases), were placed in juxtaposition with diminutive
loaves of black rye-bread, a basket of water-cresses, and a cabbage; the former being
described as the food of the peasantry of Old England, whilst the latter was stated to be
the aliment of foreigners.”
We think we see the peasantry of Old England eating farm-yard
poultry. But we don't think we see the peasantry of modern England
doing any such thing; because poultry, generally, are four-and-sixpence
the couple, whilst labourers do not, usually, get more than nine shillings
a week. Moreover, the place of large loaves of wheaten bread should
have been occupied by small basins of “skilly.” The waggon had sadly
deviated from the road of truth. The farm servants who rode in it must
have been very select. That class of persons being mostly in a state of
famine, it must have been difficult to find any who were not likely

RE
PLEASING INCIDENT.
EALLY in these days of omnibus cheapness, when the amount of civility
from the cads and drivers is diminished in proportion to the reduction of
fares, it is delightful to be enabled to record a little circumstance that
occurred in one of the twopenny busses from Hungerford to Paddington.
The passengers, who had experienced a most delightful journey, and
were all in the highest possible spirits, agreed to the following testi-
monial to the conductor and driver; which was proposed by the oldest
inhabitant,” who had got in at Hungerford Market, and did not quit
the vehicle until it reached the end of its journey :-
DEAR SIRS, -Some of the passengers, being about to quit the two-
penny bus under your able guidance and conductorship, seize this
opportunity of expressing their most sincere thanks for the kind and
considerate manner in which you have met all their wishes. Your
promptitude in “ holding hard" under the most trying circumstances,
and even upon wood pavement, where there has been nothing to hold
by, will long be remembered by all of us; and your able pilotage through
a passage of peculiar difficulty, where the tide of population runs par-
ticularly strong, has made an indelible impression on every one of our
four-and-twenty (thirteen inside and eleven out) memories. Your self-
possession at the Oxford Street estuary, where a confluence of several
thoroughfares causes the most overwhelming difficulty to an irritable or
unpractised conductor, is one of those events that sink deeply into the
mind; and we can assure you, dear Sirs, that when a collision took place,
through the temerity of the Atlas crew, we were not unmoved witnesses
of the stirring incident. Wishing you health and happiness in the pur-
suit of your cheap but honourable career, and hoping you may experience
every success through life, as well as through Regent Street, Oxford
Street, and the Edgware Road—We are, dear Sirs,
“Yours, most faithfully,

talkative, and another reserved; if one has a good deal to say for itself,
and the other nothing at all; if both are determined to have the last

compass, we are quite unable to solve. We think, however, we can
venture to say, that in a conversation between two ships the spokesmen
are, or ought to be, the men at the wheel.

cheap omnibusses, every kind of old vehicle that ran upon
four wheels, has been dragged out of its hiding-place and put
behind a pair of horse to drive the new Company off the
road. But the difficulty was to get them all of the same colour.
There was no time to paint them; and colours do not dry
particularly well when they are running from morning to
night. The difficulty at last was surmounted, by pasting over
the sides, immense large sheets of paper of the same colour
as the new omnibusses. These last are called the “Buffs,"
and the coloured paper ones, "The Opposition Buffers."
This little expedient will explain the odd appearance on
certain omnibusses, of two or three gold, or green, or blue
letters, appearing by themselves on the dreary length of a
gamboge panel. We noticed for three days the awful appari-
tion of a gigantic PADD! on one, where the sheet of paper
had curled up, and unmasked the base hypocrisy of a Pad-
dington omnibus, which was trading in those roads under
false colours.
Another was galloping about with a big painted LĄS on one
side, and an enormous AT on the other, which plainly told us
that it had been called Atlas, at a time when it was not
ashamed of having a perfect name. Sometimes you will observe
a large SEA over the hind wheel, whilst the next omnibus
will carry WATER, perhaps, near the driver's seat. They

ters of the cheap fares, who were the first to drop Paddington

PROFANE SWEARING.
EVERYBODY knows the nature of an oath.” Indeed it is amazing
how this part of education is attended to when all the rest of the field
lies fallow. We have brought the oath to everybody's door. Every office
is ushered in by swearing. Oxford undergraduates and Cambridge
bachelors, obese aldermen and wasp-waisted ensigns, attorneys as they
chip the cockatrice egg, and barristers when they have eaten their last
dinner, all start with a most ponderous and tremendous batch of oaths,
which are bowled out by the dispensers and bolted by the patients,
like MORISON'S pills, in handfuls.
Punch was presiding the other day, in his capacity of honorary
Bencher, at an Inn of Court not a hundred miles from Temple Bar,
when some thirty ingenuous youths were passed from the twilight of
studentship to the utter darkness of barristerhood.
There was a big burly sort of serving-man, who served out the oath
in small portions, with a ridiculous and irreverent voice. The little
bits of the oath were then bolted by the young men with the most
waggish relish, thus :-

IMPROVED STATUARY.
An artistical cry of “ Improve your statuary" has recently been
raised. It is all very well to say “Improve your statuary,” but people
ask, very naturally, how is it to be done ? For most of our metropolitan
statues there is only one mode of improvement, namely, to break them
up, and make new and better ones in their stead. A somewhat feasible
suggestion has, however, been lately made, that the adoption of the
“costume of the period” would be some improvement to our statues;
and it certainly would help to make them like something we have seen
in our lives before. Now, in all our experience--and we have had a
good deal-we never saw a gentleman standing with a sheet or table-

appears in his statue at Palace Yard.
We never remember observing an elderly person seated in an invalid
chair, on the top of a pedestal, like our friend Fox at the top of
Bedford Place; nor can we call to mind, even at ASTLEY's, an indi-
vidual in one of TRUEFITT's or MACALPINE's wigs, sitting on horseback
in a public thoroughfare, with a rolling-pin in his hand, and a jack-
towel round his neck, liké GEORGE THE FOURTH at Charing Cross.
Anything is better than these atrocious incongruities; and we are
consequently disposed to fall into the proposition that statues of HER
MAJESTY and PRINCE ALBERT should be prepared, showing them in
their habits as they live, and thus we shall have a perpetuation of their
appearance, as faithful and about as graceful as the Duke
at Hyde
Park Corner. The designs which adorn this article will afford some
idea of what may be the effect of the adoption of the style of statuary
which we recommend.

MARRIAGE FESTIVITIES.
A GENTLEMAN of the name of MORRIS having been recently married,
his nuptials have furnished materials for an interesting column in the
Morning Herald. We find that the rejoicing was so intense, that a bell
rang all day long, and, by way of keeping up the joviality till the very
last, a gun was let off late in the evening. The intermediate hilarity
was perfectly tremendous ; for the peasantry contended for a live pig,
offered as a prize for any one who could first succeed in climbing up a
greasy pole; but as no one succeeded in doing this, the pig was happily
spared to enjoy the general gladness. In the evening, some of his
tradesmen contributed to the day's happiness by letting off, at their
own expense, a few fire-works. Altogether, the gala must have been

And out and spake all Jewry in one,
“We may not prosper thus;
I wot, we spoil'd the Egyptians,
But true THOMAS he spoileth us.”
They have ta'en the capias, strong and stout;
They have ta’en the fierce fi.fa.,
And to true Thomas they have gone,
At the dining-time of day.
Oh, a cool, cool man was true THOMAS,
A drinking the Claret fine;
And it's what would ye have, my creditors,
That ye kick up such a shine ?”
He bath drawn a circle himself about
With letters quaint to sight,
And M. P., for 'Member of Parliament,”
Were the letters he did write.
“Now, do your worst, my creditors,
Ye are spirits fell, I trow;
But within my circle of privilege
Ye have no power to go.'
And aye they growled, and aye they howled,
And aye their hair they tore;
But ever the more they ramped and raged,
True THOMAS he laughed the more.
And still in his ring of privilege,
True Thomas he walks this day;
And aye the creditors rage at him,
But no hand on him may lay.
Oh, a proud, proud land is England,
And proud, proud are her sons,
That like true THOMAS of Scalesburie,
May take sights at their duns.

stand upon.
A Delectable Ballad of True Thomas of Scalesbury;
And how he moved in a Magic Circle, wherein Duns might not come.
OH, an eldritch lord is true THOMAS,
Though he hath nor scrip nor store ;
But where each lord hath a pound to spend,
True THOMAS he aye spends four.
Now where gat you your gold, true THOMAS,
And where gat you your fee?
I trow it was not from leaf on land,
Nor from ship on the salt, salt sea.
There's many a knight hath land in fee,
And corn where corn is dear;
But there's none sees so brave as true THOMAS,
That hath just nothing a year!
There's many a brave and bonny steed,
That canters in Rotten Row;
But of all the brave steeds and bonny,
True THOMAS the best can show!
There 's many a cab in St. James's,
And tiger jimp and small;
But of cabs and tigers true THOMAS
He turneth out best of all!
Oh, the Cowes water is fair to sight,
And fair the yachts they sail;
But to all the yachts in Cowes water,
True Thomas his yacht shows tail.
Oh, grim, grim looked the Cordwainer,
And dark was the Tailzeour's eye,
As they turned the ledger from side to side,
And true Thomas his name did spy.
“ Now foul thee fall, true THOMAS,
A sore name is thy name to me;
Where I've one debt of another man's,
Of thine I have well three."
And the Jews they howled, and the Jews they scowled,
Upon true THOMAS still,
For he loved to spoil the Heathenrie
With drawing of his bill.
Till up and spake a Vintner stout,
“I trow this may not last :
I have served true Thomas with ale and wine
These twenty summers past.
“And 'tis all for talk of his winsome tongue,
And love of his fair bodie;
For what is the colour of his coin,
Is a mystery to me."
Then up and spake a Coach-maker,
And grimly were his looks :
“There's nought on wheels runs so fast and far
As true THOMAS runs in my books."
MIND YOUR LETTERS, JOSEPH ADY!
AMONGST the collection of the QUEEN's letters which have been re-
cently opened, we should like very much to know if there was found one
written by JOSEPH ADY. Not that we should wonder at any impudence
from such a wholesale dealer in the commodity, but we think it is not
improbable that JOSEPH might have written to HER MAJESTY as the
only person in the
United Kingdom who has not yet received one of his
begging letters. The QUEEN might have sent the sovereign, in the
same way that the Merry Monarch went about knighting waiters and
boots—" just for the fun of the thing." By the bye, it is curious that
JOSEPH ADY should always estimate his " valuable information” at the
same price. He should have more regard for the circumstances of
some of his correspondents, to whom a sovereign is a consideration too
large to give, and ought to regulate his charges accordingly: a charwoman
should not pay as much as a duchess. We think if he were to reduce his
price to a shilling, which, considering the scarcity in the City, is at pre-
sent a very large sum of money, he would have a much greater number
of customers. He might even come as low as sixpence, or a fourpenny
but we must request he will not try the experiment first upon us, for
we tell him, that, like many newspapers who have a Hansom for an
express and a ticket-porter for a WAGHORN, we make on the premises

THE MOUNTCASHEL SPONGE.
AMERICA, if she is not always just, is sometimes generous. All
thanks to her for the charity which she has bestowed on Ireland. But
Ireland, unfortunately, with American provisions, has received American
principles. Repudiation
has come over with bags of corn and maize,
as scorpions are imported in casks of sugar. America has very honour-
ably sympathised with Ireland. Ireland, if she would take LORD
MOUNTCASHEL's advice, would sympathise very dishonourably with
America. The hereditary bondsmen would throw off their bonds, after
the fashion of the bondholders of Pennsylvania. A demand has been
made by this country for the repayment of a moiety of certain millions
advanced for the relief of Irish Famine. His Lordship, says the Times,
at a meeting of the Fermoy Guardians, proposed a string of resolutions,
to the effect that Ireland would rather be excused from paying it. We
do not happen to know the colour of LORD MOUNTCASHEL's livery; but
unless, by a happy coincidence, it happens to be drab, we should recom-
mend him to change it for that celebrated tint. The Repeal cry is
dying away in Ireland; but if the Irish, in addition to being troublesome
customers, will also be dishonest debtors, we expect that it will very
soon be revived in England. In that case, we suggest that one of the
first Acts of the Parliament on College Green, should be one for
turning the Boyne into the Mississippi, and the Shannon into the Ohio.

the Nassau balloon is secured as one of the “ thousand and one”
attractions at Cremorne.
The Duke himself has been over here no doubt to arrange with the
managers of these establishments for the use of his balloon and his
band. This seems to be a most disreputable mode of existence for a
sovereign duke; but when we look into the financial statistics of
Nassau, the thing is accounted for. The revenue of the dukedom is
less than two millions of florins, but the debt is twelve millions, and at
the present rate of money, we dare say Nassau has to pay the whole of
its revenue for interest and other accommodations in order to quiet its
creditors. Thus, the Nassau balloon and the Nassau brass band have
become the only perquisites, as it were, which the Grand Duke has to
depend upon.
We recommend, by all means, a pension or some other provision by
which an end may be put to this beggarly state of things. We shall
be having the Grand Duke advertised as a Master of the Ceremonies
at Vauxhall next, or selling German titles at so much a dozen in the
Lowther Arcade. Can any of our readers imagine QUEEN VICTORIA's
private band wandering about at Continental watering-places in seedy
regimentals, to get engagements at public gardens, or send round hats
in open promenades? Of course every well regulated British bosom,
with the safety-valve of loyalty in proper order, will revolt against the
very idea. For the sake, then, of ducal dignity, let the sovereign of
Nassau find some other means of replenishing his treasury than letting
out his balloon for the season, or his band for the day, week, month, or
year.

retail trade. The coal-merchant, ROBINSON, who sells coals by the
ton, is a "retail” tatterdemalion; the coal-merchant, LONDONDERRY,
who vends his carbon at the pit's mouth, is a wholesale goodness! It
is the smallness of the dealing that makes the villany. !
“It is to the immaculate 'retail trade,' and to nothing else, we contend, that we
must ascribe the enormous patriotism and magnanimity which are about to purify legis-
lation, and to elevate the character of the country. What a discovery is here! What a
heavy blow and great discouragement to the so-called liberal professions. Send a son to
Oxford ? Nonsense. Send him to Oxford Street. Let him state his terms across the
counter, and not keep them at his college.”
There is here a contest of wit and argument-a felicity of italics, too,
that rejoices the spirit.
“People may never have suspected the fact; but it is not to be doubted that all the
moral, political, and social goodness in the kingdom is hidden behind shawls and staring
tickets. Is not MR. WILLIAMS written "M. P.” in MR. DODD's book? Is he not a retail
tradesman ?"
The aqua-fortis of this satire would burn a hole in the skin of a hip-
popotamus! We inquire, with some misgiving,-does a "retail trades-
man” live after it ?
“The history of the last fifty years, in England, has been one restless and unflinching
attempt on the part of democracy to sap the institutions of the country, on the one
hand, and a patient, lofty, indifferent contemplation of the work, on the part of the aris-
tocracy, on the other."
The picture is affecting — beautiful. We see the sapper-the "retail
dealer"-destroying the institutions of the country, and the DUKE OF
NEWCASTLE, and such Dukes, sitting, with their coronets on their
heads, intelligent and undisturbed as peers in a tapestry.
But scorn-a proud scorn-has done it all :-
“The men who—we say it without hesitation and fear-rather take away from than
add to the dignity of the new Parliament, would never have been thrust into that assem-
bly to clog useful legislation and to propagate their revolutionary doctrines, had their
first movements been met with vigour, and not tolerated with proud scorn."
And these men are, for the most part, “retail traders." They live in
shops, and deal in all sorts of commodities. Painful, indeed, must it

"What! savages and all, MARIE ?” exclaimed Louis, laughing, and
chucking the lovely Queen playfully under the Royal chin. But here
comes Doctor FRANKLIN, and your friend the Cacique, with him." In
fact, as the monarch spoke, the Minister of the United States made his
appearance, followed by a gigantic warrior in the garb of his native
woods.
Knowing his place as Minister of a sovereign State (yielding even
then in dignity to none, as it surpasses all now in dignity, in valour,
in honesty, in strength, and civilisation), the Doctor nodded to the
QUEEN OF FRANCE, but kept his hat on as he faced the French monarch,
and did not cease whittling the cane he carried in his hand.
"I was waiting for you, Sir,” the king said peevishly, in spite of the
alarmed pressure which the Queen gave his royal arm.
“ The business of the Republic, Sire, must take precedence even of
your Majesty's wishes,” replied DR. FRANKLIN.
“ When I was a poor
printer's boy, and ran errands, no lad could be more punctual than poor
BEN FRANKLIN ; but all other things must yield to the service of the
United States of North America. I have done. What would yon,
Sire?" and the intrepid Republican eyed the monarch with a serene and
easy dignity which made the descendant of St. Louis feel ill at ease.
I wished to-to say farewell to Tatua before his departure,” said
Louis XVI., looking rather awkward. ' Approach, Tatua.” And the
gigantic Indian strode up, and stood undaunted before the first ma-
gistrate of the French nation: again the feeble monarch quailed before
the terrible simplicity of the glance of the denizen of the primæval
forests.
The redoubted Chief of the Nose-ring Indians was decorated in his
war-paint, and in his top-knot was a peacock's feather, which had been
given him out of the head-dress of the beautiful PRINCESS OF LAM-
BALLE. His nose, from which hung the ornament from which his
ferocious tribe took its designation, was painted a light-blue, a circle of
green and orange was drawn round each eye, while serpentine stripes
of black, white, and vermilion alternately were smeared on his forehead,
and descended over his cheek bones to his chin. His manly chest was
similarly tattooed and painted, and round his brawny neck and arms
hung innumerable bracelets and necklaces of human teeth, extracted (one
only from each skull) from the jaws of those who had fallen by the
terrible tomahawk at his girdle. His mocassins, and his blanket, which
was draped on his arm, and fell in picturesque folds to his feet, were
fringed with tufts of hair,the black, the grey, the auburn, the golden

pounds per annum-a sum fully equal, in the mind of the Prime
Minister, to the merits of our first dramatist; for, of course, to teach
the writing of the name Victoria, is a much nobler development of
mind than to write the play Virginius. Be this as it may, the House of
SHAKSPEARE being placed at the disposal of the Government, will the

who have shed their best ink in the service of their country and
humanity at large, may be provided for at the rate of £200 per annum
each. This will cost the country £2400 a year. But this is not the
only expense. This we state plainly, as we wish to deal fairly with all

An English journalist, it is true, has one great chance. He writes
for a number of years; he influences public opinion; he exposes
swindles; analyses the most plausible schemes; gives warning of a
panic, or restores confidence when most needed; and his great chance
is, if he has extraordinary talent, perseverance, and industry-to re-
main unknown! We ask you, reader, if you happen to know the
name of a single journalist in England ? We only know one, and
that is LORD PALMERSTON, who had the reputation, in the French
papers, at one time, of writing every article that appeared in every
English paper against France. The collection, by the bye, of "PALMER-
Ston's Leaders under Five-and-twenty Administrations,” would not make
a bad series. It would not only prove his Lordship's immense versa-
tility of talent, but would also establish the new fact, that “a man who
has written for the papers" is not necessarily considered unworthy to be
employed by the British Government. The precedent will not be a
bad one, providing it is not accompanied by the French extreme. We
should have no particular desire to be introduced to Downing Street, if
we had to walk through Bridewell first.

WHAT THE ARABS NEVER DID DO.
THE STATE OF THE TEMPLE.
NOTHING can exceed the awful state of confusion into which the
Temple has lately been thrown, by the invasion of a rude horde of
whitewashers and bricklayers. Not a staircase can now be scaled
without scaling a ladder on the landing, and it is impossible to get into
the hall of the legal precincts without tumbling over a pail of whitening.
The long vacation, which causes the vacating of the chambers to a
considerable extent, has been selected as the time for the knights of
the hod to make themselves masters of the staircases. To those living
in town, the constant stepping into vast heaps of mortar is exceedingly
mortar-fying.
The scene in Paper Buildings, at the end of King's Bench Walk, is
truly alarming, for the houses are being pulled literally about the ears
of the wretched clerks of the Outlawry Writ and Rule Office. The
suitor going into the last-named for a rule, will probably get a six-foot
rule in his eye; and the client contemplating outlawry, gets suddenly
detained within the office by a ne exeat, in the shape of a pile of bricks
or a scaffold. Every now and then, the tumbling in of a lot of lathe and
plaster, on the desks and the heads of the clerks, will remind all present,
that in matters of law, coming down with the dust is imperative. The
respected Treasurer is the only person who finds any difficulty under
this head, for he finds it much easier to collect himself than to collect

THE linendrapers, it seems, are at
sixes and sevens, or, to speak more cor-

“The question," says the Morning Chro-
nicle, first arose from a desire of a few
of the retail dealers to obtain from the
wholesale houses thirty-seven inches to
the yard, without, however, intending to
allow the public more than the regular
thirty-six inches. In the course of this
dispute certain extensive frauds have
been detected.” It turns out that reels

RAILWAY
SIGNALS.


Much has been said and written
on the necessity for Railway Sig-
nals ; but to prevent all Signals
from being signal failures, care
should be taken to render them
appropriate. A whistle of itself is
well enough, but, having only one
sound, it cannot express half-a-
dozen different things; and when it
wants to say
or “Stop,”
it has only one method of conveying
both these very opposite directions.
We think it would be advisable to
substitute musical instruments for
the common whistles, and appropri-
ate tunes could then be played, in
order to meet the various emergen.
cies of railway travelling. A signal
for starting should be conveyed
through a trombone, of great power,
on which the popular air of " Off,
Off, and Away,” might be played ;
or the drum and rattle might be so
placed in juxta-position on the en-
gines belonging to trains going dif-

'Twas but late that with a Minister o'er London town I flew,
And now, mine ancient gentleman, I have a flight for you.
Art thou looking for the wedded wife where wedded wife should lie,
In the bosom of her husband ? 'Twas the wont in days gone by!
I showed him the work of centuries, I'll show thee the work of years; Not there—not there. Trace yonder stair, to a chamber far apart,

I bared for him the hut, for thee I'll open palace gates;
Oh, work well done! Prize bravely won! And where's the fool to rue it?
The fester probed in streets for him, I'll probe for thee in states.
Thou hast gained MONTPENSIER a dower, and broke two hearts to do it.

fully selected staff of Professoresses, after this fashion.
Class of Cheerfulness.
PROFESSORESS LADY KNAGGs, a person of singularly aggravating
disposition, who will daily use every means of trying the temper of the
young persons, until their spirits are thoroughly broken, and subject
them to every variety of petty annoyances. The least appearance of
depression to be punished by low diet and extra ill-temper from a sub-
tutoress, chosen from the most cantankerous old maids that may be
known to the College authorities. The young persons, while in this
class, should have each of them half-a-dozen very boisterous children to
take charge of for eight hours every day.
Class of Self-respect.
In this class the discipline of the Humility Class may be carried farther.
Instead of the servants, a staff of fashionable young men should be
employed to make dishonourable proposals, and offer insulting attentions
to the young persons, who will thus be practised in the art of respecting
themselves under difficulties, which they will often have to put in
practice in their situations.
By pursuing a course of training similar to that sketched above, we
may hope to satisfy employers, while we remove the many querulous
representations now made of the hardships of Governesses, by supplying
a corps of young persons thoroughly broken in to the worst they can
possibly expect to encounter in after-life.
Class of Humility.
PROFESSORESS THE Hon. MRS. HARDLINES, a lady of sixteen quarter-
proposed, which one of our artists has humbly attempted to com-

who would not hesitate to make the world a party to their “coolness,
and their “reconciliation,” would not be particular about letting the
passengers round them participate in the joy of their re-union.
COLLEGE FOR GOVERNESSES.
It is proposed, as we learn from the newspapers, to found an establish-
ment of this kind, in connection with the Governesses' Benevolent
Institution. We have, however, seen no prospectus of the course of
instruction to be followed, the examinations to be undergone, or the
degrees to be conferred. Any school for the Education of Governesses
ought to have a special regard to the duties this class of females has
to discharge, and the discipline of mind required by their position.
Keeping this in view, we beg to furnish the following hints to the
founders of this useful place of instruction:-
In the first place, the pupils admitted must be ladies, both in habits,
appearance, manners, and, if possible, birth. This is indispensable.
Those who are to have the training of young ladies must belong to the
order themselves. They must be sweet-tempered. This is necessary,
as their dispositions are likely to have a good deal of souring; and we
all know the sweetest wine makes the best vinegar. Their constitu-
tions ought to be strong. It is probable they will lead a close and
sedentary life, and the wear and tear of the school-room is no joke. alluding to any accident of humble birth or reduced fortunes that can

MR. SERJEANT ADAMS has his eccentricities, particularly when he has
got a lot of little criminals before him, and exclaims—“Gentlemen of the
Jury! what am I to do with this batch of boys ?”. but he is not obliged to
submit to the ill-bred insolence to which he is continually subjected.
It is true enough that Jack will bore a lot of grand jurymen to death
with an harangue of half-an-hour on their antiquity, and that he will keep
those jurymen who are not wanted, merely to hear his speech; but these
foibles are not to expose him to the ill-disguised contempt of a portion
of the Bar, practising or plying for practice at the sessions.
We have seen and heard amusing instances of MR. SERJEANT ADAMS's
mode of dispensing justice; and the celebrated “Boy and Pudding
Case” is fresh in our recollection, when he summed up by observing to
the jury—“Now, gentlemen, you have the boy and the pudding both
before you, so consider your verdict." But if the learned judge prefers
this concise plan of adjusting the facts, there is no reason why he should
endure a course of systematic insult. There can be no doubt that he means well always, and does well nearly always, though an occasional
mistake is a thing to which we are all liable. If the Bar would mind their own business, and leave “JACK ADAMS” as they call him, to
attend to his own, the ghost of Hicks would not have to blush for the scenes by which his Hall is being made notorious.

The Vampyre.
(NO SUPERSTITION.)
The bloodshot moon glares on the close-crowded graves,
Through the foul mist that over the sepulchres waves,
On the tombs where the City, with people o'erspread,
In the midst of the living hath buried its dead.
A glimmering vapour creeps over the ground,
You may see whence it issues-yon newly-raised mound;
Mark what spectre ascends in that horrible light-
Lo, the Vampyre Infection is rising to-night!
The Vampyre! The Vampyre! Avoid him! His breath
Is the reek of the charnel, the poison of death:
He has broken his prison of pestilent clay,
And the grave yields him up, on the living to prey.
The Vampyre! The Vampyre! Behold where he flies
To the couch where his wife, in her widowhood, lies :
Of her lost one—her husband-she dreams in her rest,
Whilst the Vampyre is fixing his fangs in her breast.
The Vampyre! The Vampyre! His infant child sleeps ;
To its innocent cradle he stealthily creeps,
And his bite its pure cheek with a plague-spot distains,
And corrupts his own blood in his little one's veins.
The Vampyre! The Vampyre! Nor mercy, nor ruth,
Saves his kindred and friends from his venomous tooth:
He is bound to a task which he cannot evade;
He is sent by a mandate which must be obeyed.
The Vampyre! The Vampyre! Beneath a stern doom,
On his terrible errand he breaks from the tomb;
To work vengeance
and woe is his mission of dread,
Upon those ʼmid the living who bury their dead.

melodrama, full of regular home-spun domestic distress, and downright,
ordinary police-report murders and suicides, with comic incident-

MORE STOPPAGES.
We have to announce another stoppage in the Strand, not a hundred
yards from Temple Bar. It has excited no surprise that this concern
should suspend its thoroughfare, for, notwithstanding the excellent
opening it bas bad, there has frequently been an obstacle which has
proved for the time insurmountable. The business of the Strand has of
course been frequently forced to find its way into other channels, and
though the stoppage is only partial on the present occasion, it is incon-
venient in the highest degree. The omnibus speculators, directly they
perceive a rise in paving-stones, know what to expect; and it is only
when they hear the welcome news, "Down again!" that they restore
their confidence to the thoroughfare. Everything then goes on smoothly
enough for a time; but when the deposits on the
pavements begin again,
and granite reaches an alarming height, another stoppage must of course
occur.

THE GREAT ECLIPSE.
CONSIDERABLE excitement was occasioned last week by the announce-
ment, that on Saturday there would be an eclipse of the sun in London,
and people came flocking from the suburbs at an early hour, determined
to be in time. Some little difficulty was experienced in ascertaining
where the exhibition would commence, and much discussion ensued as
to whether the eclipse would take its course up Holborn, or pass down
the Ștrand. The police were ordered to be in readiness to keep the
people back; and old bits of green glass bottles, to see the sun during
its invisibility, were much in request throughout the day. On the
whole the eclipse was successful, and it may be pronounced what the

“ MONEY NEVER WAS SO SCARCE.”
We cannot help thinking that several persons have availed them-
selves of the scarcity, of money as a welcome pretext for sending in
their bills, and asking for “something on account.” Christmas has
this year been anticipated two full months. October, which used gene-
rally to be a quiet month, has been disturbed by all the dunning
characteristics of January, and the excuse of every one who has
invaded our “rest” with an application "for a trifle," has uniformly
been that "
money never was so scarce.”
Bills, which used rarely, to present themselves before New Year's
Day, come every hour rushing in upon us, and they are all backed with
the same apology, “Money never was so scarce."

THE OLD FLINT.
THE NAPOLEON of Peace is selling off his old muskets. Switzerland
has had cart-loads of them, and the Pope has had a small lot of
12,000 offered to him, but has declined them with his very best com-
pliments. They are the old muskets with the flint locks, which
every one snaps his fingers at, and will not go off at any price. It seems
a great joke, the NAPOLEON of Peace selling instruments of war. He had
better open an old rag and iron shop, with the inscription over the door:
"Louis-PHILIPPE VEND DE VIEUX Fusils,” and an intimation on the
windows, “ La Paix à tout Prix." We think we could furnish him with
a very pretty little design for a black doll. An Ethiopian ROBERT
MACAIRE, done in plaster of Paris, would attract all the war-making
kings of Europe as purchasers. Perhaps, however, we are blaming the
'Sweeper of the Pyrenees” rather unjustly. He sells the muskets
merely to turn "a honest penny,” for he knows well enough that in their
old and worthless state a child might handle them with the greatest
safety. Thus, he puts money into his pocket, and promotes the peace
of Europe at the same time, for, naturally, if the guns will not fire, there
can be very little bloodshed. The muskets may manquer leur coup"

CIVIC REWARDS.
We have not a word to say against SIR PETER LAURIE's
enthusiastic speech in honour of Mr. BROOKE, nor the hearti-
ness with which the Common Council received his motion to
present that gentleman with the City freedom in the established
gold box.
MR. BROOKE is an apostle of peace and civilisation, and it is
not often that SIR PETER's enthusiasm takes so rational a direc-
tion. Only we would suggest to the civic assemblage, that the
apostleship of civilisation and benevolence has had as devoted
members within the sound of Bow-bells as in the forests of
Borneo ;—that if Sarawak has had its hero, Farringdon has
furnished its martyr; that if MR. BROOKE succeeded in his
attempt to suppress Malay Piracy, DR. LYNCH perished in
his struggle with London fever ; that “to protect the op-
pressed, emancipate the slave, and civilise the savage" is no
nobler work than to succour the sick, toil for the suffering,
and enlighten the ignorant;—that the humanity which pene-
trates the jungle is twin brother to that which walks the
hospital. "No selfish motive impelled", DR. LYNCH any more
than MR. BROOKE; no avarice disgraced the conquests of the
one over filth and fever, any more than those of the other over
bloodshed and barbarity. The one triumphed, the other died in
the struggle. The Common Council is justly eager to reward
the victor; why should it hang back from honouring the martyr ?
By all means let it present MR. BROOKE with his gold box; but
why should it not, at the same time, present the widow and
orphans of DR. LYNCH with the gold in another form ?

“NONE BUT THE BRAVE DESERVE THE FAIR !"
This delightful, this heroic sentiment, complimentary alike

Attorney- and Solicitor-Generals. These awful law authorities
have just decided "that soldiers upon whom orders of affili-

FLIGHTS OF ASTRONOMERS.
It is really beginning to be very desirable that some check
should be kept on the alleged discoveries of the amateur
astronomers, some of whom send a new star, or a new comet,
nearly every day, to one of the daily newspapers. It is very easy
to drop a comet into an Editor's box; but, unless there is some
one to answer for the reality of the “round unvarnished tail"
we are not justified in accepting, as a fact, the alleged dis-
covery. Newspaper managers have not time to look after
these things, and if they get a communication from a respect-
able party, saying "I beg to inclose you a new star, which I
discovered last night in rambling through the Milky Way,"
the Editor is bound to accept the statement as true, for he has
no opportunities of testing bis correspondent's veracity.
We used to look upon the Clerk of the Weather as a fabulous
officer; but we are sure that some functionary of the sort,
commissioned to keep the stars posted up in a ledger, and the
skies credited with any new acquisition, would be found very
conducive to the real interests of science. Every twinkler
should be faithfully registered; and if there should be an
eclipse, or anything else out against him, a note should be made
of the fact, and the record should be open to the public on
payment of a small fee for searching.
This would be much better than the loose system of keep-
ing. our astronomical accounts which is now in force, and
which seems to depend on amateur star-gazers, who send gra-
tuitously the result of their observations to the newspapers.
We are not surprised that the comets and stars spoken of by
these gentlemen are never to be found when looked for. Our
starry registration system might contain an index that should
be easy of reference, and by turning at once to the page it could
be ascertained whether the star was in its proper place, or
whether its existence was not a mere optical illusion of the
alleged discoverer.

Nature discharge that duty for which it seems most unfitted. He
insisted on soft, white, fluffy, innocent cotton doing the work of gritty,
black, explosive, and murderous gunpowder. And now he announces
a discovery which gives papier-maché all the transparency of glass.
A great many wiseacres last year declared that gun-cotton would end
in smoke, and the same class of sages now declare they can see through
the papier-maché glass. This, however, instead of a disparagement, is
really a proof that it possesses one quality, at least, which the Professor
claims for it.
The invention comes opportunely, when our common ale and wine-
bottles are sinking so fast, under that mysterious internal disorder which
wastes the Quarts of the present day into a size little exceeding that of
the Pints of last century. Unluckily, the papier-maché glass, if it will
not break, will bend. Its toughness may make it economical, but will
injure the symmetry of articles manufached from it. We shall see our
very prime old Port appearing on the table in bottles labouring under
all varieties of paralysis, crick in the neck, ricketts, and crooked spine.
THE APPEAL OF THE ARCH.
Last night—twas striking twelve-I walked before
The new front they are adding to the Palace,
After the mild design of MR. BLORE ;-
Which, after all, proves that we're not quite callous
To the discomforts of the Royal Family,
AUGUSTA, MARY, ALBERT, ALFRED, ALICE-
And as I slowly passed the Arch of marble,
Thinking of Blenheim, Waterloo, and Ramillies,
Sudden I heard a strange, sepulchral warble,
Like to the slow-drawn, subterraneous note
With which huge MEMNON, Egypt's sands among,
May be supposed to clear his stony throat,
Ere he salutes the sunrise with a song;
And following this prelude, sad and slow
A voice sighed, “Where on earth am I to go ?”
I started—'twas no sentry on his march-
I stared—'twas no policeman on his round-
I felt 'twas from the bowels of the Arch
That came the dreary and despairing sound.
“Right," quoth the Arch, divining my amaze;
“'Tis I, set here by the late GEORGE THE FOURTH,
Turned out, unpitied, in these changeful days,
To seek a settlement, east, west, south, north.
Ugly I may be—'tis no fault of mine;
Expensive, sure, I was-not mine the blame;
Alas! I did not make my own design-
Felt I was in the way, when first I came.
Excuse me, friend, while my farewell I take
OF WILKINS’ pile, which I have known so long."
And the poor Arch sobbed as its stones would break,
As sadly towards St. James's stole its song.
“Pity the sorrows of a poor old Arch,
Which to no place has ever served for door
Which from the Palace front is forced to march,
Tho' quite as useful as it was before.
“To make me serviceable find a plan;
I'll carry anything upon my top,
Tho''twere another DUKE, if come there can
Another such, from even Wyatt's shop.
“Oh, if the principle of statu quo
Secured great WELLINGTON where now he sits,
Why should not my poor stones, I'd like to know,
Remain, tho' 'twere as butts for weekly wits ?
“Think how an Arch must feel (which, tho' it may
Be out of place, is still a work of Art),
Compelled to seek employ in some low way-?
At Railway Station, p'rhaps, or Moses Mart.?
"In vain imploring a poor plot of ground,
Along the Strand I soon perhaps may go;
While heartless loungers crack their jokes around,
Taking the sight, which none, alas ! bestow.
"But if at last I find no work to do,
And heartless mockery reject my claims,
I'll seek the kindred Bridge of Waterloo,
And plunging, wash my woes out in the Thames !”

There would be something uncomfortable in getting elevated out of
glasses so disgracefully “screwed” or “slued," as the accompanying
specimens.
We see considerable inconvenience to be apprehended from the use
of the papier-maché glass for mirrors. It will, of course, warp, and the
shaver will run the risk of seeing, in some cases, his face even longer

THE ROYAL DRUMMER.
FRANCISCO D'Assis is very fond, according to the Observateur
Français, of beating the big drum. We must say that this was the
last organ in the world likely to promote harmony in a royal house-
hold-almost as bad as QUEEN CHRISTINA. Considering the noise
there has lately been in the quarrelsome palace, we should imagine
that this drum must be the far-famed Tartar drum.
No wonder the King and QUEEN OF Spain had separate establish-
ments! A big drum would put out the best concerted duo. Why,
it has nearly disturbed the concert of European powers! The Big
Drum of Spain, and the Serpent of France, would not be tolerated any-
where, excepting at a promenade concert. Why doesn't JULLIEN

PUNCH'S VISION AT STRATFORD-ON-AVON.
THE NIGHT OF THE SIXTEENTH OF SEPTEMBER,

WEARY I was of Cockney stares,
And cut-and-dry emotions,
And the enthusiastic airs
Of those who'd sailed o'er oceans,
They said, to Stratford town to pay their fares
And their devotions.
“In this room," quoth they," he was born ;
Wrote his plays at that table."
They looked, talked, went; while I, outworn
With all that brainless Babel,
Sat, from that chamber, faded and forlorn,
To stir unable,
And slept. My fancy, restless elf,
Bat-like, meanwhile, went soaring;
Hooking on every ledge and shelf,
From roof to crazy flooring,
Till, of a sudden, I awaked myself
With my own snoring.
'Twas night; but light was in the room,
Though the grate showed no ember;
And voices—whose unearthly boom
Thrilled me in every member-
Were sounding all about me, through the gloom
Of still September.
And, peeping out from filmy wings,
Sweet moonlit faces cluster
Round a pale queen of the green rings.
And still a marvellous muster
Of life went on-joys, griefs, tears, gambollings,
Tenderness, bluster.
Jealousy, with black lips, was there;
And in a fair girl's glances
Madness looked sweet, but tore its hair,
And fell on sudden trances,
In an old king, left by his daughters bare
To the world's chances.
One wrung her hands-walking, all wan,
In nightrail-stern of feature;
One curiously a skull did scan,
And found therein a teacher ;
And one in man's attire, but not a man-
A gentle creature-
Beside a maid paced soft and slow,
In delicate discretion,
With voice most musically low-
While a right jovial session
Of boon ghosts set the pottle-pots aflow,
Their wits to freshen.
But through the maddest of their mirth,
A solemn diapason
Of wisdom gave each word a worth,
That served to blazon
To my dull sense whence was those beings' birth
That I did gaze on.
To their great master's home, with glee,

TAX-GATHERER OF THE PERIOD.
AN OFFICIAL OWL IN AN IVY-BUSH.
ONE of our daily contemporaries, who, in contradistinction from what
he is continually calling the “unfledged writers,” wishes no doubt to be
considered the “very old bird,” has, in a piece of delicious fine writing
---so fine, indeed, that nothing lives 'twixt it and nonsense”-
announced the discovery of a regular official owl in a regular official ivy-
bush. The rara avis has turned up, according to our ancient contem-
porary, in the form of MR. JAMES STEPHEN, who has recently retired
from the Colonial Office, and who is thus described by our friend the
"very old bird.”
“For thirty years or upwards, this sedate, sanctimonious, and most
subtle of men, (mark the alliteration), without noise or display, by the
mere exercise of unbounded craft, huge dissembling, a large stock of
Italian diplomacy, the profoundest reserve, silence, solemnity, acuteness,
and intellectual power, contrived to govern a greater number of human
beings, and of more diversified races, either than the Czar of Russia
or the Emperor of Austria.”
Was there ever such an owl in such an ivy-bush as we find here
described? We have italicised some of the words in this description,
that have struck us as the most absurd, and the most evidently inserted
because they are words, but for no other reason that we can perceive.
All this fine writing about the resignation of a subordinate office
evinces a flightiness on the part of the " very old bird,” suggestive of
the necessity for clipping his wings. MR. STEPHENS' alleged "Stock
of Italian diplomacy,” furnished no doubt from some fashionable
Italian warehouse, is a new article of which we have not previously
heard. This "silence and solemnity” are owlish and ivy-bushish in
the extreme. After going carefully through Guy's Geography, and
transcribing all the hard names of the most outlandish places, the very
old bird exclaims, with more enthusiasm than grammar—"Thus east,
west, north, south, was his name, and his influence too often disas-
trously felt." We recommend, as a general rule, for the future
guidance of the “very old bird,” to think of LINDLEY MURRAY in the
first instance as an absolute necessity, and reserve fine writing as a
luxury to be indulged in when this necessary is attained.
“OH, JUST TELL YOUR MASTER I HAVE MADE ANOTHER CALL ABOUT THAT
LITTLE MATTER.”

A TRIBUTE TO THE BATH BRICK.
MR. ROEBUCK, having been swamped in the troubled waters of the
Bath election, has been honoured by a tribute from his supporters. It
is emblematic of the gentleman it is presented to, being an oak cabinet,
very much carved-expressive at once of hardness and ruggedness;
with five hundred guineas inside of it-expressive of MR. ROEBUCK'S
sterling qualities and true mettle.
We have often used our báton on MR. ROEBUCK, provoked thereto
by the liberal style in which he laid his tongue upon others; but if MR.
ROEBUCK has the sting of the bee, he has also its virtues of industry
and usefulness. He generally buzzed about corruption, rather like a
bluebottle than a wasp, and chose out the softest and most showy fruit
of St. Stephen's to prick,
He has, it is true, had the art of making Truth eminently disagreeable.
He has occasionally paraded the goddess, like the Lady GODIVA, in a state
of nudity, which shocked the decorous House of Commons. The water
from the well in which that Lady resides is, unfortunately, bitter; and
MR. ROEBUCK had the mania of insisting on everybody's drinking it,
without the usual emollient additions of Milk of Human Kindness and
Sugar of Courtesy.
Still, Mr. ROEBUCK's seat in St. Stephen's is empty; and the
“stricken deer who has left the herd,” though apt to butt, was a Hart
Royal, and deserved a better fate than to be pulled down by the Bath
chaps. We are glad they have shown some sense of his merits, even
after the testimonial fashion.

I staggered before the vastness of that prospect. Not naturally a
modest man, yet I asked myself mentally, how am I to grapple with a
subject so tremendous ? Every man and woman I met was invested with
an awful character, and to be examined as a riddle to be read henceforth.
The street-sweeper at the crossing gave me a leer and a wink and a
patronising request for a little trifle, which made me turn away from
him and push rapidly forward. “How do I now, my boy," thought
I, inwardly but that in the course of my travels I may be called

from his eyes, and making believe to read without glasses. Other

He knew the joke, which had formerly belonged to himself. He could point to the very page
in the catalogue of his collection, where the exact description of the joke would be found.

it so frequently, that he did not intend to trouble himself about it any further. It must now
take its course. He would almost be ashamed to own it himself, after the uses it had been
put to, and the company in which it had been found.
The magistrate mildly remonstrated with MR. JOSEPH MILLER on the unbecoming tone
of his remarks upon his own offspring; but the old man declared that he and the joke had
been parted for years, that the joke had always been a bad joke, and never did him any
credit at all.
The next witness was the policeman, who had taken the utterer of the joke into custody.
He had several more of the same sort about him at the time, but he swallowed a great many
on the spot, for it is a common trick of these smashers to do so when they cannot get rid of
their illicit stock by cramming any of it down other people's throats.
The prisoner, on being asked what answer he had to offer to the charge, pleaded extreme
destitution, and the utmost distress of mind. He knew he had uttered a counterfeit joke,
but he had nothing else to depend upon. Previous to the magistrate's decision, a gentleman
who attended from the Punch mint was requested to examine it. He looked at it very
carefully, and recognised it as one of a batch of base imitations, some of which are dealt in so
audaciously that the “smashers" have the impudence to offer them even at the Punch mint,
where they are always refused as a matter of course.
The worthy magistrate said, that in pity to the prisoner's destitute condition, a lenient
sentence should on this occasion be passed. The judgment was, imprisonment for one week,
with hard labour, the hard labour consisting of an attempt to make a good joke, which he
knew was the severest work in which the prisoner at the bar could be employed.

CIVIC STATISTICS.
An ingenious contemporary has furnished some
curious data relative to the number of dishes
cooked, and the persons employed in cooking
and serving them up at the LORD MAYOR'S
Dinner. It appears that 8000 plates were in
requisition; and supposing each plate to have
had the usual complement of knives and forks,
there must have been 40,000 silver prongs,
taking 5 prongs to eachfork, put into re-
quisition, as well as 8000 sharp blades, and
-exclusive of the guests themselves—not less
than 16,000 spoons. Presuming each plate to
contain twenty mouthfuls, we get the alarm-
ing aggregate of 160,000 mouthfuls at the dinner
of the LORD MAYOR ; and supposing each
mouthful to require the application of the dental
powers three times, we obtain the truly terrific
result of nearly half-a-million movements of the
jaws. This calculation, however, leaves alto-
gether out of the question the vast amount of
maxillary motion required for the speech-making,
conversation, and hip, hip, hurra-ing of the
festive night. An arithmetician has been en-

THE LOVES OF THE NEW POLICE.
* Move on!” my lips would gently say,
To Harmony's itinerant child;
But downwards would my glances play,
Upon the spot where she had smil'd.
Thus time rollid on! at last I learn'd
My love was by that maid return'd.
'Twas not an ordinary flame,
Like human passion poor and brief;
'Twas lasting, and its produce came
To me in shape of bread and beef.
Well I remember at her side,
The joint when cold I would divide:
When turning to the door she said,
“Thank goodness, Missus is a-bed!
“Oh! that it were my fate to look
For ever on those manly features;
Or only turn away to cook
Chops for the noblest, best of creatures !”
That very night my love had grown
By that on which it had been feeding;
But while I lingered, time had flown:
And of my duty all unheeding,
I twice had heard them cry—“Police !
And twice the sound appeared to cease.
Twice I had left my seat, to go-
And what the row was straight discover ;
But passion murmured boldly, "No!
Sink the policeman in the lover."
Thus for an hour at least I stayed,
Beside that captivating maid.
Twice I had nearly said “Good Night;"
The very word was all but spoken;
Twice I had taken up my light,
Put on my cape, resolv'd on flight-
She smil'd; and my resolve was broken.
Between the door and me she stood,
A pint pot dangled on her fingers;
Resist such witchery who could ?
Though lost, quite lost, is he who lingers.
Thus, having once confessed her power,
Whene'er I was on duty sent,
Always at the accustomed hour,
To where she lived my steps I bent.
Until at last, one fatal night,
We thought that everything was right,
All had been quiet over head,
We deem'd the household snug in bed.
Sitting, as we supposed, alone,
By love possessed, devoid of fear,
I dallied with the devilled bone,
While she with egg had flipped the beer.
I was about to quench my thirst,
But-sad and horrible disaster!-
A cupboard door wide open burst;
Good gracious,” she exclaimed, “my master!”
That moment I blew out the light,
Drew down my hat across my brow,
And fled-but since that fatal night
Became--the thing you see me now.
I was reported, and of course-
(Though they retained me in the force) -
They placed me on a distant beat,
In some far off sequester'd street,
Where daily I am growing old,
And looking back on former joys;
With feelings crush'd, but not yet cold,
I vent my passion on the boys.
Here the policeman bent his head,
In shame that of itself would tell
How bright the prospects lying dead,
How grand the height from which he fell.
Then, with a hurricane of sighs,
The tear-drops in a torrent rise.
His two companions, prompt and kind,
Tender the strength-sustaining draught,
But peace returns not to his mind
Until its whole contents are quaff'd.

'Twas when the summer noonday's heat
Had given way to evening's cool,
That three policemen, off their beat,
Sat playing pleasantly the fool.
'Twas at the Station's open door,
When each, his gallantry to prove,
Consented to run briefly o'er
The story of his early love.
The first who spoke was one with look
The least important of the three,
Whose oilskin cape had lost its hook,
And hung around him seedily;
His bull's-eye had a broken glass,
There seemed no gaiety for him;
His hat was crushed, as if, alas !
The cup of grief ran o'er the brim.
His fingers through his bair he ran,
Cleared his parch'd throat, and thus began :-
FIRST POLICEMAN'S STORY.
'Twas in a square that far away,
Northward of Burton Crescent, lies,
Where the dull beadle spends the day
In thrashing boys and killing flies.
One morn, upon the beat despatched,
For want of something else to do
Mine eye a kitchen window watched,
When a fair maiden met my view.
Her hands were in a wooden bowl,
A vegetable-dish she washed,
And from her upturned eye the soul
Of melancholy beauty flashed.
At length, as from the area's height,
I threw her down a playful wink,
The gesture seemed to strike a light-
A spark fresh caught from Cupid's link.
Never shall I forget her look,
With face upturn'd she still remained;
In admiration of that cook,
I to the area rails was chained.
In pity to the wondering maid,
Without her name or wages learning,
My progress I no more delayed,
But vanished down the nearest turning.
Lexicons cannot tell the power
Passion held o'er me from that hour.
When on or off my daily duty,
In winter's cold or summer's heat,
My heart around that home of beauty
Remained for ever on the beat.
No more my bull's-eye gaily shone;
My very staff of life was gone.
You may suppose it was not long
Ere I revisited the spot;
A ballad-singer's mournful song,
Would call me thither like a shot.

THE CITY TURNPIKE-MAN.
It is an observation no less beautiful than true, and as philanthropic
as it is remarkable, that if it is worth while to keep a horse, it is worth
while to feed and take care of him. We wish the City authorities would
feel this with regard to their turnpike-man who is consigned to the un-
stable accommodation of a high stool immediately under the Chancery
Lane lamp-post. Surely, if he is worth planting at all as a picquet or

that must (or may) "for ever hide bim.” The populace, looking upon the
City toll-man as the last remnant of feudalism, show no sympathy with
him when he falls among a hostile band of carters or waggoners, who
are endeavouring to evade the toll; and the Institution-represented by
a tumble-down stool-is evidently no longer respected. We call upon
the City authorities either to abolish or protect their toll collector; but
to set him up as a mere nine-pin, at the corner of Fleet Street-an un-
protected skittle to be bowled down half-a-dozen times a day by the
rude hand of ruffianism, for the idle pastime of the people—is a piece of
cruelty that the humanity of the nineteenth century utterly revolts
against.

Mr. Dunup's Failure.
The winding-up of this little affair is not going on very
satisfactorily. It was hoped that several of the liabilities
would have run off, but MR. DUNUP himself has since
run off, and has thus considerably shortened the operation
of settlement. Several of his creditors have met, and his
laundress, who is the chief sufferer, has been appointed

fight amounts to a civil death, by which several young

all things, well it may be-proverbial. A young gentleman

BOOTS AND BRIEFS.
MR. BOUNCE the barrister, a month or two ago, paid-
beforehand, remember-JOHN SPRAGGS, his bootmaker, 20s. for
a pair of Wellingtons, to be delivered on Tuesday. When the
day arrived, Mr. B. called to know why the boots were not sent
home. SPRAGGS answered, that he had forgotten the matter;
but his memory being thus refreshed, he remembered that he
must have for the boots 58. more. Strange to say, MR. BOUNCE
paid the money. Still the boots were not sent home. MR.
BOUNCE again called on SPRAGGS, when the fellow said he had
too much time to look to all his business, and, in a word, he
would not send home the boots at all. You'll return the
money,” said BOUNCE. “Certainly not,” said SPRAGGs. Where-
upon the barrister summoned the bootmaker, who was com-
pelled to refund the cash, the judge at the County Court calling
him a shuffling, dishonest fellow.
A few days ago, SPRAGGS fell into trouble, and was called to
the bar at the Middlesex Sessions. He had retained MR.
BOUNCE to defend him, had moreover given him "a refresher;
but Mr. Bounce had other business—did not defend SPRAGGS;
and SPRAGGS was found “guilty.” BOUNCE refused to refund
a single sixpence.
SPRAGGS served his time upon the mill, and left the House
of Correction; not, however, before he had chalked the follow-
ing reflection upon its walls. “It is better to deal in briefs
than in boots; because, when you once get the money, there's
no law to make you send home the goods."

A REPORT appeared in a weekly paper that the DUKE OF
WELLINGTON had sent a subscription of £5 to the Fund for
the purchase of SHAKSPEARE's House. This statement went
the whole round of the Press as a piece of great news. The
Duke, however, with his characteristic love of truth (and
writing letters), has sent the following letter :-
“F.M. the DUKE OF WELLINGTON presents his compliments to the Editor of
the Penny Whistle, and begs to state most emphatically that he never recollects
having sent £5 to the subscription for the purchase of SHAKSPEARE's House,

THE LAMENT OF. ERIN.

ALAS! for the mournful eclipse of my glory,
The loss of the name that I formerly bore,
For which I was famous in song
and in story:
Her ancient renown is poor Erin's no more!
The land of the gallant, warm-hearted, and grateful,
I once was esteem'd by the nations to be;
Malignant, unthankful, cold blooded, and hateful,
Were words never breathed with the mention of me.
And whence hath my light thus disastrously faded !
To whom must I say that I'owe my disgrace?
Not Saxon invaders have Erin degraded ;
Her shame hath been wrought by her own native race.
My children, by graceless declaimers imbruted,
And madden'd, have learned to do evil for good;
The mouths of my sons are with slander polluted,
With slander cast back in requital for food.
My fields are ensanguined with slaughter unsparing;
By murder the noble and bountiful die,
The crime unredeem'd e'en by ruffianly daring-
Deliberate, dastardly, sneaking, and sly.
With sorrow and shame I behold, broken-hearted,
My once verdant shamrock now redden'd with gore;
My fair fame is tarnish’d, my glory departed:
Oh! call me, my children, Mavourneen no more!

A PARDON-FOR NOTHING.
In October last a young woman, named Mary Ann TURFORD, was
tried in the Central Criminal Court for stealing a watch. She was
found guilty, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment at Brixton.
The theft, it appears, was committed by another person. One JAMES
WILLIAM WARD has been convicted of the same offence; of which,
moreover, he has confessed himself the perpetrator. The innocence
of the girl thus having been clearly established, a representation of her
case was made by Mr. Norton to the Under-Secretary. SIR DENIS
LE MARCHANT, we are told, writes back, and says that SIR GEORGE
GREY, taking into consideration the facts as set forth in MR. NORTON'S
communication, has recommended HER MAJESTY's free pardon in the
case of MARY ANN TURFORD.
Now, as a pardon means the forgiveness of an offender, and MARY
ANN TURFORD committed no offence, the propriety of the term, as
applied to the remission of her sentence, may be questioned. But this
is a shallow cavil
. A philosopher has said, that men have the greatest
difficulty in forgiving those whom they have injured. It is with the
law as with mankind in general ; the law, therefore, has stretched a
point in having forgiven MARY ANN TURFORD. To consider that the
order for her liberation should have been accompanied by any expression
of regret-not to say by any compensation for her month's false im-
prisonment–is to be extremely ignorant of human nature-at least of
Home-Office humanity. Of course, MARY ANN TURFORD may think
herself very well off. She has received a pardon—for nothing.

Spurs in fits and starts along,
By COBDEN gravely guiding
His war-horse stern and strong;
And bent on bearding all the world,
Majestic Muntz doth pass,
On his hobby breed of Brummagem,
By Paper out of Brass.
Ha! clash and flash (whizz, fizz, and hizz !

So quick they pass, King HUDSON
And many a Prince of Rails !

And scarce their way they win
Thro' navvies shorn of wages,
And subscribers short of tin.
Quick ! stand aside—for bold they ride,
These gallants, four abreast-
Fierce FEArgus upon “Five points"
Displays his Chartist crest;
With debonnair Sır DUNCOMBE,
And Fox the fluent, nigh,
And the THOMPSON of Tower Hamlets,
With speech all cut and dry !
Now vail your hats, brave riders,
Lout down to saddle-bow;
The Ministers, the Ministers,
Russell, PALMERSTON, AND Co.!
Their hobbies sorely weighted,
Yet sorry hacks, I trow;
Some lent to ride, some borrowed,
Some picked up-luck knows how,
Amongst them gracious MORPETH,
Like to Ducrow the Bold,
On hobbies three, his balance,
Right shakily doth hold;
On“ Schools” and “Health of Towns Bill,"
And a half-bred Free Trade colt:
Fair fall his pluck, and grant him luck,
Come stumble, shy, or bolt.
An ugly road, my masters,
With ditches deep and wide;
Behoves strong hands and skilful,
Upon the way ye ride.
Behoves your hearts ye harden,
And home the rowels ram,
As at yawners and at raspers
Your cocktail nags ye cram.
Hark! hounding on your rearmost-
'Tis the wild Irish cry!
YOUNG IRELAND and OLD IRELAND,
At buffets as they fly;
Each on his hobby bearing
His pack of Saxon wrong,
With plenteous lack of reason,
And plenteous wealth of tongue.
Now, vizor down, and lance in rest,
My LORD OF PALMERSTONE !
The ANSTEY is upon you,
His trumpet he hath blown!
He couches his impeachment,
Sheath'd cap-à-piè in brass,
While URQUHART fiercely watcheth
To give the coup-de-gráce.
Why pause upon the soldiers,
Now that the chiefs are told !
Goodspeed to all, this Session,
Recruits or veterans old.
May Whigs, for once, be strong of heart,
The Speaker strong of lungs;
May the thinkers speak their thoughts out,
And the talkers hold their tongues !

We wonder how many nights the Currency debate will occupy, and
how many of those nights will be taken up by MR. MUNTZ?
We wonder if the Income Tax will be modified, or enlarged, or dimi-
nished, or repealed this Parliament? But now it is time to leave off
wondering, for what greater wonder can there be than the Income
Tax ? Besides, where is the use arguing about a thing that, after all,
comes to no end?

The Monster Motion.
MR. CHISHOLM ANSTEY has made the nearest approach to the
discovery of perpetual motion that has ever yet been arrived at. It
occupies four pages of the Votes of the House of Commons; extends
through the whole History of England; conprises the whole of the
known, and three parts of the unknown world; and refers to every
communication, either "secret or ostensible," that has ever passed
between any persons upon any subject whatever. To comply with this
motion, we should require another RALEIGH; to write another History
of the World; another COCKER, to invent another system of arithmetic
capable of making the calculations and returns that MR. CHISHOLM
ANSTEY demands; and it would be necessary to examine all the chiefs
of all the tribes with which this country has ever communicated, by

John. I can't say as how it was, Sir.
Punch. LORD LANSDOW.NE, to be sure, touched upon Irish
crime. Did he assign this, in particular, as the reason of the
extraordinary step which the Sovereign has felt it necessary to
take?
John. I can't say as he did, Sir.
Punch. But I know he did not, Sir. He mentioned the civil
war in Switzerland. Was that it?
John. No, Sir ; no-that's a mere trifle—that is.
Punch. Was it HER MAJESTY's confidence of the mainte-
nance of the peace of Europe ?
John. I should say not, Sir, in course.
Punch. Well, then; was it her having concluded a treaty for
the suppression of the slave trade? or has the Legislature
been assembled in the middle of November to discuss the
Navigation Laws, or the Sanitary Question ? Were these
matters of such pressing importance ?
John. Not particular, Sir, I 'll allow.
Punch. Lastly, LORD LANSDOWNE expresses HER MAJESTY'S
hope that the business of the nation will soon resume its
wonted activity. Have the Lords and Commons met to receive
that piece of information ?
John. I should think not, Sir.
Punch. Then for what reasons on earth, Sir, let me ask
you, has Parliament been summoned ? Had the commercial
distress, and the state of Ireland, anything to do with them?
John. Certainly, Sir. They were the main points, as I
understood.
Punch. Then why didn't you explain yourself? What you
meant to say, I suppose, was, that though our monetary diffi-
culties had somewhat abated, they were yet so urgent as to
call for immediate relief; and that, albeit the condition of Ire-
land was slightly improved, it was still so bad as to demand
instant attention.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE IRISH TAX-GATHERER.
“Sir,
HEROISM OF AN IRISH LANDLORD.
PUNCH'S DAYS IN THE FACTORIES.
Being desirous of making ourselves acquainted with the practical
progress of British Industry, we have determined on paying personal
visits to some of the factories of our native land.. Our purpose is to
confine ourselves chiefly to those branches of manufacture with which
the public may be considered most familiar ; for it is a pleasing remark
of Pliny-who, it will be remembered, ended in smoke by tumbling
into Mount Vesuvius—that "we like what we know, even when we
don't exactly know what we like.” We accordingly resolved that our
first day among the factories should be passed in a place whose pro-
ducts we know that we like, and we at once bent our way to the
SWEET-STUFF SHOP.
On entering the door we were received by the proprietor, who escorted
us round the counter, and called our attention to the saccharine stores,
which lay about in luxurious richness. He had a bit of pleasant gossip
about every sweetmeat we passed, and an anecdote hung round every
glass repository he dipped into. The origin of the ALBERT Rock
formed the subject of an interesting legend; but as the story was told
us in confidence, we feel that the ALBERT is a rock we are not at
liberty to split upon.
We were next taken over the BONAPARTE's Ribs department, and
received the instructive information, that this sweetmeat dates as far
back as the divorce of the Emperor from JOSEPHINE and his marriage
with MARIE-LOUISE, which suggested the idea of BONAPARTE's Ribs;
and as the repudiation of his first partner was generally regarded as
the commencement of his downfall, this popular lollipop was struck in
commemoration of an event that promised so much for English interests.
BONAPARTE himself being in everybody's mouth at that time, it was very
naturally supposed that his ribs might get into the same position, and thus
a large sale would be ensured for the new sweetmeat. Theoriginal inventor
was not mistaken, for he retired on the ribs in less than three years
from the time of their being first manufactured. We were next led by
the proprietor into the Toffey room, where two real natives of Everton
were busily occupied in producing the delicious succulent for which
their birth-place is illustrious. They seemed very intelligent, and

Punch's Cure for the Influenza,
We have given a great deal of attention to
the subject of a cure for the Influenza, from
which even the writers and artists of Punch have
not been entirely free, and the affair had there-
fore taken somewhat the aspect of a national
calamity. Upon turning the subject deliber-
ately over in our minds with the pitchfork of
perseverance, and examining all the symptoms
of the disease, of which sneezing is the chief,
we have come to the resolution that the best

THE LORDS OUT OF WORK.
As usual at the commencement of a Session, the Lords are
slack of work, for the Commons are too fond of talking to get
any business sufficiently advanced to be sent to the Upper
House for completion. The Peers, who are after all not half
so garrulous and long-winded as the Commons, cannot fill up
their time in mere talk, and are actually starving for want of
employment. Those still able-bodied and active-minded legis-
lative labourers, Brougham and WELLINGTON, are especially
desirous for some employment; and BROUGHAM, who is con-
stitutionally incapable of idleness, may shortly be expected to
importune LORD JOHN RUSSELL for a job of some kind, just
to keep his hand in.
It is certainly very hard that a number of excellent Par-
liamentary workmen should be unemployed all tbe early part of
the Session, merely because the Comnions will not get their
own work forward, and furnish the Peers with something to be
going on with at all events. Idleness is the parent of mischief,

There was a gentleman near us-a very lean old Bellows-Mender, indeed, who
had three platefuls. His old hands trembled, and his plate quivered with
excitement, as he asked again and again. That old man is not destined to eat
much more of the green fat of this life. As he took it, he shook all over like
the jelly in the dish opposite to him. He gasped out a quick laugh once or
twice to his neighbour, when his two or three old tusks showed, still standing up
in thosa jaws which had swallowed such a deal of callipash. He winked at the
waiters, knowing them from former banquets.
This banquet, which I am describing at Christmas, took place at the end of
May. At that time the vegetables called peas were exceedingly scarce, and cost
six-and-twenty shillings a quart.
“There are two hundred quarts of peas,” said the old fellow, winking with
blood-shot eyes, and a laugh that was perfectly frightful. They were consumed
with the fragrant ducks, by those who were inclined; or with the VENISON, which
now came in.
That was a great sight. On a centre table in the hall, on which already stood
a cold Baron of Beef-a grotesque piece of meat-a dish as big as a dish in a
pantomime, with a little Standard of England stuck into the top of it, as if it
was round this we were to rally—on this centre table, six men placed as many
huge dishes under cover; and at a given signal the master cook and five
assistants in white caps and jackets marched rapidly up to the dish covers, which
being withdrawn, discovered to our sight six haunches, on which the six carvers,
taking out six sharp knives from their girdles, began operating.
It was, I sav, like something out of a Gothic romance, or a grotesque fairy
pantomime. Feudal barons must have dined so five hundred years ago. One
of those knives may have been the identical blade which WALWORTH plunged in
Jack Cade's ribs, and which was afterwards caught up into the City Arms,
where it blazes. (Not that any man can seriously believe that Jack CADE vas

CHRISTMAS BILLS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“There is a mock albata plate sort of benevolence-which
philanthropists are only too glad to put off instead of their real silver-
called feeling for the lower orders. This feeling, sir, has very properly
been branded by men who have something like a stake in the country,
as an attempt to set the poor against the rich,' an attempt that, if I
had my will, I would punish with hanging, without even the benefit of
any sort of clergy.
"Well, sir, I have always considered the Times as an advocate of
order, obedience to the laws, respect for superiors, and all that.
Nevertheless, sir, on the 22nd of December last, I saw in that journal
a letter from 'A Commercial Traveller,' from which I take the follow-
ing revolutionary paragraph :-
It is generally the custom for the nobility and gentry to have their bills sent
in at Christmas with punctuality, but not to make their payments equally so; and
I believe I may say with truth that bills to the amount of thousands of pounds are

be urgent, the probability is he loses his customer.
“Isn't this a pretty character to give to the English Aristocracy? They,
as a body, shirk paying their bills! Their hearts are not at home to
the knocks of their creditors. They, moreover, ruin' a man who
dares to be urgent,'
"Now, sir, what is this letter--at this eventful time of the year, too-
but an insidious attempt to unhinge the best society? Can there, I ask,
be a more lively, and
withal a more disgusting illustration of the mock
philanthropy I have noticed above, than by taking the part of trades-
men against their noble customers ?! When, sir, you advise-for it is so
