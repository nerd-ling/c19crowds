Her eyes are decidedly greenish,

Her skirts are a foot from the ground.
Her hobbies are all of the newest,
You cannot keep pace with her fads;
Last session of Tories the bluest,
To-day she's the reddest of Rads.

Few moderns immunity gain,
In matters of diet decrying
For she scoffs at the tale of adventure,
Routine as the direst of plagues,
And sneers at the Servants'-Hall
One day on the butcher relying,
Caine.
The next she's a pupil of Haig's.
One week she's teetotalling gaily; Her rôle is to shine and be witty,

A dictum we still may endorse.
But this freak of the feminine gender,
Though apt our annoyance to move,
Is mostly a youthful offender,
And seldom too old to improve.
When she's schooled by adversity's
training,
And grows less ungentle in mind,
There's a hope of her possibly gaining
Some hold on the hearts of her kind.

MR. PUNCH, Sir, — Will you, who have ever been the

Thousands of blameless matrons, innocent maidens, and
spinsters of maturer years are being deceived by the treachery
and falsehood of the fashion artists, who deliberately invest
their models with attractions to which a respectable English- highly capable maid who has been with us for some years,
woman cannot hope to attain. What is the result ? Useless and is a most superior and honest person in whom I have

DAWN.
The shadows and the shrouding gloom have ceased;
A golden sea of glory floods the East,
With bars of crimson lined;
Now Day has ris'n triumphant over Night;
I know it is so by the streak of light
Which filters thro' my blind.
Sunrise ! and men's sad hearts grow glad and gay
To greet the golden promise of the day
And all the good to be ;
Yet, I confess, this much-belauded dawn
(Excuse me, while I just suppress a yawn)
Hardly appeals to me.
I do not rush to greet the thing with zest,
While Hope insurgent agitates my breast;
I could not if I tried ;

Education, republished from “ The Westminster Gazette."]
A HARMLESS if not necessary pedagogue,
I am, in self-defence let this be said, agog
To learn how I my post may best adorn;
But having read the things that men like“ KAPPA" write
I feel I can no longer hope to map aright
My course. Why was I born ?
That I have had but little cause to chirp o' late
At what my pass-book shows.)
Well, to resume (confound these trisyllabic rhymes),
I could not think of any very shabby crimes
That rendered me unfit to teach our youth ;
In fact I was a mass of self-complacency.
Now to my mentors I must make obeisance, I
Have learnt at last the truth.
A whitewashed tomb (such is the charge I see composed),
Full of dead BOHNs and other matter decomposed,
I set to work to stunt the growing mind.
As for the usher's interests and views, he has 'em
Only for show, he knows no real enthusiasm,
And there is worse behind :
In matters such as science and astronomy,
In letters and political economy,
My ignorance is crass, Sir, simply crass !
A thin veneer of smug respectability
Fails to conceal my inward imbecility,
In short I am an ass.
Ah well, it may be we are all past praying for,
But in this world one gets what one is paying for
(That seems a fairly obvious remark);
And I for one, although exposed so crushingly,
Still mean to draw my salary unblushingly, -
That of a third-rate clerk.
For I am one, of such there is no sparsity,
Who did not do so badly at the Varsity,
And on the whole I get on well with boys.
Moreover, just to touch on matters physical,
I'm not a dipsomaniac or phthisical,
And life has had its joys.
In short, I always thought until quite recently
That I was really doing very decently
Except so far as filthy lucre goes.

However, I pacified him.

Extract from Letter :-"THAT LITTLE MR. SMITH MUST BE VERY STRONG. HE WOULD NOT LET GO, AND HUNG ON MOST HEROICALLY,
WHILE I RAN FOR MY LIFE WITH FIDO!”
I told him that I had but thought
Of something funny. It was nought.
I said, “Confound you, can't a fellow laugh ?”
He scorched me with a fiery eye;
And said that I could sob, or sigh,
Such was the common lot ;
But that the noise of one that laughed
Outraged the canons of his craft;
And, as he grimly urged, “I'd better not."
PARTURIUNT DENTES ....
PRONE in the dentist's torture-chair,
With drumming fists, erectile hair,
And tapping of the boots,
I lay, and watched the long hours go,
While nerve on nerve our Common Foe
Grappled, and wrenched, all quivering, from its roots.
I was not merry. Postured thus,
One rarely feels hilarious ;
And, as that icy screw
Plied its dread office, I confess
I wept; and in my bitterness
I cursed my day. And cursed the dentist too.
When lo! as oft, when skies are gray,
The sparkling Regent of the Day
Leaps from behind a cloud,
So on my tortured being broke
The sudden rapture of a joke,
So rich, so radiant, that I laughed aloud !
My jaws were gagged. My mouth was full
(Ah me!) of rolls of cotton-wool.
The sound, I must admit,
Had less of laughter than the note
Known as a rattle in the throat.
The operator nearly had a fit.
Pale to the lips with sudden dread,
He loosed the gag, and raised my head,
And gave me drink to quaff.
Thinking a dentist, when annoyed,
Is quite a person to avoid,
I left him with a sneer,
To cast abroad my jeu d'esprit,
With view to pay the ruffian's fee,
And stimulate a doting Public's cheer.
O Readers, when I wandered thence,
My heart was fat with confidence;
I knew that all was well ;
Yet am I now, if truth be told,
E'en as that pessimist of old,
Who said he never nursed a young gazelle.
For “oh, the heavy change !” (It shows
That after all one never knows.)
I would have bet my money
That humour in a dentist's chair
Ought to be humour anywhere
And, now I'm out of it, it isn't funny. Dum Dum.

MORLEY's favourite Indian attendant.
Whether Mr. MORLEY wakes immediately
when the first notes are sounded, or
is gradually roused from slumber, his
proverbial honesty prevents him from
stating with absolute confidence. When
living at his keep at Montrose, Mr.
MORLEY, a firm believer in local colour,
exchanges oriental instruments of per-
cussion for the plaintive pipes of the
North, and is awakened by three stal-
wart Highlanders who stand outside
his windows, and blow the wild strains
which render sleóp impossible except in
patients suffering from chronic coma.
At first they stood only ten paces from
his window, but as Mr. MORLEY is a dead
shot with a shooting boot, or a lump of
coal, they move ten paces further off
every morning until they can only be
reached by a rook rifle.
We may note in conclusion that Miss
MARIE CORELLI has been so fascinated by
the possibilities underlying this method
that she intends to make it the motive
of her next romance, with the stimu-
lating title of “The Awakening of
ANDREW CARNEGIE.”
Implacable as ever, the gifted satirist
expresses her intention in the following
lines after Mr. KIPLING :

(By a Liberal M.P.)
"Can there not be found men and women
possessing the requisito gifts who will gladly
devote to the promotion of ethical clothing
something of the time, the energy, and the
thoughtful deliberation so freely lavished upon
other national objects?”—Lady Portsmouth in
“The Tribune," Jan. 27.]
When in my salad days I ran
To pay a visit to my tailor,
I thought no more of Ethics than
The bosun of a North Sea whaler.
By birth and breeding disinclined
To emulate the ways of slatterns,
I used my taste but not my mind
In choosing fashionable patterns.
Unto the ordeal of the tape
I unconcernedly submitted,
Content if my corporeal shape
Alone was adequately fitted.
I took, of course, "some interest
In colours, textures, and in tissues,
But never in my folly guessed
That dress was fraught with nobler
issues. :
But now I see that, on the whole,
The path of life becomes less festive,
I tune my clothing to my soul,
And make my very spats suggestive.
Thus, when I don my Harris tweeds
It is because my heart is softer
And metaphorically bleeds
With fellow feeling for the crofter.
Or if I muse on Ireland's wrongs
And on the feuds that have convulsed
her,
My grief is not expressed in songs,
But in my heaviest frieze Ulster.

Nell. “SUPPOSING, UNCLE SEPTIMUS, THAT YOU KNEW TWO NICE YOUNG MEN. ONE HAS LOVELY CURLY HAIR AND A STRAIGHT NOSE, AND
THE OTHER LOOKS SIMPLY ADORABLE IN HIS UNIFORM. SUPPOSING THAT THEY BOTH WANTED TO MARRY YOU, WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE ?"
For this you marched and with your soldiers fell;
And he who rashly lured you to your grief
Has now your sword, and means to use it well;
Lo, the survivors hail him as their chief,
And all their song is of heroic JOE,
Who fought, while ARTHUR feared to face the foe.
You shall return, but, ah, how changed will be
The scene where once you gloried and were great!
Behold upon the SPEAKER's right you'll see
C.-B. and those who did not fear their fate;
And on the left J. C., once hight JACK CADE,
Undaunted by the ruin he has made.
THE LEADER.
OA, flouted by The Standard and The Post,
And half rejected by the raging Globe,
Leader, lay down your ancient pride and boast,
Lay all your chaplets down, and in your robe
Veil, meekly veil, your once renowned face,
And sink for ever from your pride of place!
What boots it to have led and to desire
To lead your dwindling armies to the fray ?
How shall it profit you to set on fire
The twice-polled City and to win the day,
If in the House you droop, unwept, unsung,
Before the clamour of a brazen tongue ?
They will not own you—this is all their cry-
Lead, if you will, but them you may not lead,
Who scorn the hand that ruled them, and defy
Their shattered darling in his utmost need.
E'en the suave grace that once was their delight
Is mocked by those who have survived the fight.
And yet you did your best : you did not say
That white was white, or black was truly black;
Your eagle eye discerned them both as grey,
And grey you proved them with your wonted knack,
Still waving, 'mid the turmoil's dust and vapour,
Your scorned half-sheet of unconvincing paper.
The following advertisement, placed in The Bazaar under
the deceptive heading of “Pigeon Loft," seems to point to a
bad case of simony:
“Nuns.--Two fine healthy pairs of black nuns. Exchange one really
good pair of bronze archangels, or sell 108. the lot.”
“What we want in Parliament is men who will look after
the welfare of their country, and not men who, when July
comes round, go off shooting the partridge and the deer.”

I returned at head of poll.)

LADIES AT WORK.
ONLY a mangled report of the recent
conference on Domestic Training for
Perfect Ladies has reached the press,
but fortunately we happen to be able to
supplement it.
Among the unreported speakers was
one who quite early in the proceedings
congratulated the promoters on the good
sense and tact which led them to substi- |
tute the words “Perfect Ladies" for
“Women.” The word “woman," she
held, should not be used at all. “To be
called a woman,” she said, “is to be
insulted. We are not women, we are
ladies.”
An elderly matron rising to oppose
this view and to express her satisfaction
with the word “woman,” was shouted
down. “We are all women whatever
happens, through no efforts of our own,"
she was heard to say ; “but it is our
own affair whether we are ladies or not.”
(Cries of “Traitor!” and uproar).
The friends of the “Kid-gloved
Guild of Household Dames” explained
how it was that so odd a title had been
chosen. “The word 'servant' is also
objected to,” she said; "and it must
be abandoned.” No lady could soil
her reputation by seeking for work at
a Registry Office for servants. New
registry offices for household dames
were therefore being opened, with a door-
keeper whose business it was to refuse
admission to ordinary servants or women,
and forcibly throw them out if they
were at all obstinate. “ Service" also
was to be a forbidden word.
Asked if it was intended to substitute
“ damevice," the speaker sat down in a

Miss BELLA PATEMAN, as the acidulated, narrow-minded,
and mundanely pious person Lady Ridgeley, and Miss BERYL
FABER as the strait-laced "prunes and prisms” spinster
Geraldine, are both admirable. Herein is just a reminiscence,
to the experienced, of The Serious Family.
Mr. C. M. LOWNE has never had such an opportunity afforded
him as this of Pryce Ridgeley, the typical good young man of
the upper bourgeois class, self-sufficient, insufferable. He is
excellent.
In the very difficult part of Major Maurewarde Mr. Dawson
MILWARD wins our reluctant sympathy by his tenderness for
the child who is nominally the son of the man whom he has
so cruelly wronged. It is, in its line, a very fine part.
Mr. NIGEL PLAYFAIR, assuming an air of familiarity proper
to the popular dignitary of a small town, whose heart is
in the right place, and whose manners are tempered by his
social position as a general medical practitioner, gives a
telling sketch of character.
Mr. ROBERT Horton is Harding, the Member of Parliament's
confidential secretary, and renders his part with praiseworthy
tact, as also does Mr. VIVIAN REYNOLDS as Forshaw, the repre-
sentative of a provincial newspaper, who, as an ordinary type
of “interviewer,”': might have so easily been made ridiculous.
The scenery, by Mr. JOSEPH HARKER, from designs by Mr.
PERCY MACQUOID, R.I., forms an artistic setting to the picture.
From first to last Mr. PINERO must unstintedly be con-
gratulated on the play, and Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER on its
production with such a company, whose performance is so
exceptionally good; and especially that of Miss IRENE VANBRUGH
as the heroine, that it can be seen many times, and always
with increasing pleasure. It is in for a long run.
LADY, A SHEEP-DOG.
LADY, since first we met the years have sped
In three full cycles o'er your good grey head.
Your age I know not, yet my trembling tongue
Owns, though I love you, that you are not young.
Still, though 'twere flattery to call you slim,
Your heart beats high, your vision is not dim.
The far-flung ball that 's swiftly lost to view
Still with unerring speed you can pursue,
Patient to find and always sure to bring
The trophy back and beg another fling.
Your fathers drove their flocks, but you abide
In proud submission by your master's side.
You grant, what love and death alone control,
To him the untutored worship of your soul,
Glad to obey, nor ever seek to prove,
The word that checks, the wish that makes you move.
Oft has he seen you, as, with head laid low
Between your paws, you watched him come and go;
Waiting his pleasure and intent you lay
While the slow minutes dragged their length away,
Till at the last, your inmost being stirred,
You sprang to life obedient to his word.
And he has known you urge on his repose
The moist intrusion of a nudging nose,
Or, bolder still, to seek his knee and press
With pleading paw to win a slight caress.
Nature, who made you rough and grey and meek,
Reft you of dogdom's silent power to speak;
Cut off your tribal customary flag,
And left you nothing you could wave or wag.
Yet, still unfair herself, she made you fair,
A bob-tailed beauty in a mat of hair,
With two brown eyes, on which her mind she spent
To make them tender, wise and eloquent.
In part repentant, but in part unkind,
With shaggy tufts she failed to make you blind,
And left, while taking of your tail her toll,
These curtained outlets for your anxious soul.
Winter, dear Lady, when the world is chill
With rain and mud, becomes you very ill.
Roused from your slumbers at the early dawn
For ten wild minutes on the swampy lawn,
Clean--for no dog is better groomed than you-
You issue forth and hunt the garden through ;
Shake off the night, and wantonly employ
In zealous rollings your arrears of joy.
Blameless in heart, but draggled, you return
And roam the rooms, in swift disgrace to learn
How mud and moisture all your virtues clog,
And men prefer their carpets to their dog.
Yet, though your coat be muddy, I confess,
Dear tail-less one, I cannot love you less.
Here in my den the fire burns bright and high :
Lie you before it, Lady, and get dry.
Here shall no housemaid with an angry face
Rate you for dirt and bid you from the place;
No careful mistress with imperious call
Send you to exile in a straw-laid stall.
Lady, take courage, for behind my door
Peace shall be yours and leisure to restore
Your tangled toilet, till with mind serene
I pass your coat as moderately clean.
R. C. L.
HORTICULTURE UP TO DATE.
STIMULATED by the recent achievements of a horticulturist,
who is about to place on the market the “pomato," a blend
of the apple and tomato, and the "plumcot," a mixture of
plum and apricot, Mr. Punch hopes soon to be able to
announce the successful rearing of the following novelties :-
The Cumberry. This may be regarded either as a very
long gooseberry or a very short cucumber, according to fancy.
When fully ripe the skin is thin and the contents pulpy.
Unripe it is like a cobble, and may be used as such. Mr.
Punch is disposed to think that the over-ripe cumberry will
be very popular at Elections, especially when eggs are scarce.
The hairy variety looks like a fat caterpillar, and makes very
good grub.
The Mistletato; a happy combination of the romantic and
the domestic. This fruit, which has a very piquant flavour,
has been grown in a small patch of soil, concealed, like King
CHARLES, among the branches of an oak. Hence it is not
surprising that the Mistletato should combine the nourishing
qualities of the homely tuber with the sentimental associa-
tions of that plant which was revered by our Druid ancestors
and is beloved by modern maidens. It should be a popular
dish at wedding breakfasts.,
The Pumpkonion promises well and seems likely to com-
bine the amplitude of the pumpkin with the pungency of
the onion. Mr. Punch is of opinion that a machine will have
to be invented for dealing with this vegetable, as to handle
it would be too severe a tax upon the cook's lachrymal
glands.
The Turniparrot and the Parsni paragus are not yet suf-
ciently developed to be described with any confidence. Many!

ARITHMETIC PRIZES.
The daily papers have been informing
us that the postman at Wembley, who
recently retired after 40 years' service,
in which he had walked no fewer than
280,000 miles, has been presented by
his colleagues with an arm-chair. It is
pleasant to know, on the authority of
exclusive information communicated to
Mr. Punch, that this is no isolated case
of grateful recognition, but that it can
be paralleled by the action taken or
about to be taken in half-a-dozen other
callings.
Thus Sir HENRY HOWORTH, whose 500th
column-and-a-half letter in small print
recently appeared in the pages of The
Times, has been presented by some
admirers in the Carlton Club with a
sumptuously upholstered Mongolian
divan lavishly equipped with bop pillows.
On the total number of his definite
statements on the subject of Free Trade
and Protection being brought up to the
figure 1 by his letter to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
on February 14, Mr. BALFOUR was pre-
sented by the Birmingham Chamber of
Commerce with a new silver-plated golf
caddie.
Mr. ALFRED Austin, whose aggregate
linear output has now reached the
su perb total of 1,234,659, has just
been made the recipient of a most
gratifying testimonial from the Helicon
Club of Rome. It takes the form of a
memorial in the Latin language which
culminates in the memorable words
Quocunque modo, Laureatus Britannicus
su ffiaminandus est.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN having just brought
into active service his 1800th eyeglass,
a deputation of Midland opticians will
wait upon him in the principal glass-
house at Eyebury next Sunday to present
him with a beautifully bound copy of

THE ETON SLOUCH.
[The following letters dealing with this
momentous topic have failed to reach the Head
Master of Eton, for whom they were evidently
intended, and are published herewith.]
MY DEAR CANON LYTTELTON,–I cannot
help thinking that your boys walk too
much. It is a most injurious habit.
Make them cover the distances between
class-rooms, up and down town, to and
from games, and so forth, at a brisk,
regular trot, and the growing canker
will soon be nipped in the bud. Then
there is the question of food. Boys are
over-fed. Without being a faddist, I
should like to recommend the following
dietary, as being not only sufficient but
salubrious for a normal growing lad:
Breakfast:- A plateful of porridge
(hot oat or cold plum) and one cup of
luke-warm Vigoro.
Dinner :-A few Brazil nuts (only the
kernels should be consumed) and half a
push-ball.
Tea :-One bean (biled).
Supper may be omitted.
I am, Yours faithfully,
EUSTACE Milo.

as an error or an incongruity :-“In an

for a round is a shilling, would you

Mr. ARCHER, in his notice of the
Waldorf revival of She Stoops to Conquer,
which is now transformed by modern
methods into a really amusing play,
protests against Tony Lumpkin's gags
in his scenes with his mother. For
instance, when she says, “I that have

THE EXHUMORISTS.
THE “Smart Set” (says a contem-
porary) has got hold of another neat
expression. “You must pull your socks
up” is the latest form of saying “Never
mind,” or “Pull yourself together."
The other day at a Bridge dinner, it
was amusing (to our contemporary) and
a sign of the times to hear a certain
youthful eldest son recommend a Dow-
ager Countess of seventy to “pull her
socks up.”

inquired, “Who's your hatter?” The

Set way of hinting derision of the hat.
The Colonel, when he had thoroughly

highly diverted.
A certain Indian Judge was shivering

acquaintance crossed over from the other

aside by means of his buttonhole, in-

The Judge replied that he found it much

NATURE STUDIES.
THE ELECTRIC Light METER,
THERE is nothing that so much brings home to a man the
responsibilities involved in the tenancy of a flat as the
possession of an Electric Light Meter and the necessity for
"reading" it every now and then. In the happy country
district in which it is my privilege to spend a part of my time
we proceed on an amiable system of mutual confidence. The
producer of the light supplies me with all that I may require at
a fixed sum for the year. He trusts me not to waste it in
merely ostentatious illumination, and I return the compliment
by hoping (often against hope) that his light will be adequate
for all my nocturnal purposes. In London, however, so
business-like are our methods and so rigid is our suspicion
of one another, that we require a check, and thus it has come
about that a meter has been fixed to the wall of the entrance
passage which, in our domestic language, is somewhat boast-
fully described as the Hall.
Now to me, who know nothing about the internal economy
of electric light, this meter is an object of mystery and terror.
It is constructed mainly, I think, of metal, and possesses dials
decorated with figures and made practical by hands. When
I look at it my mind brings up by an irresistible association
of ideas a man whose hands are black with oil, who wears a
blue linen jacket, and whose conversation is of a highly
technical quality to which my limitless ignorance yields an
undeviating assent. I should no more dream of disputing the
accuracy of his electric statements than I should question the
judgment of Professor OLIVER Lodge if he told me that my
kitchen was a hotbed of psychic manifestations, or should
impugn the veracity of Mr. GEORGE BERNARD Shaw if he
informed me that his own continued existence afforded the
best and, in fact, the only proof of the argument from design.
It seems, however, that my Electric Company-I use the
pronoun not so much to imply that I possess the Company,
as to show that the Company owns and exercises a right to
demand my occasional cheques - it seems, I say, that my
Company is inspired by fairness, and that its dealings with
me are to be based on the strictest rectitude. It has recently
furnished me with a card of printed instructions entitled
“How to Read the Meter," and for some time past I have
been laboriously occupied in endeavouring to master this
new knowledge. “The Meter,” I am told, “is read in the
same way as a gas meter, the right-hand dial showing units,
the second tens, the third hundreds, and so on.” This
statement is, no doubt, clear and illuminating (as all Electric
Light statements ought to be), and I am quite prepared to
admit that the language is plain almost to baldness. For me,
however, it is useless, for I suffer from an incurable preliminary
defect: I do not know how to read a Gas Meter.
| Then follows a phrase which in its intensity is dramatic:
“The figure to be taken is the one that the hand has last
passed which will be the lowest numerically of those it is
between.” I merely pause here to suggest that “lower "
would be more correct grammatically, and then I dash on
breathlessly to learn that “there is no difficulty about this
when the hand is clearly between two figures, but when it is
over or nearly over a figure it is sometimes doubtful whether
the figure has been passed or not.” How true that is! Life
is like that, and death, and all the other things that happen

At some £300 a year
Drawn from a grateful country's revenue ?

Needs must he do who means to make
Six of the best in weekly wages !

Its private self to public payment ?
Eventually hopes to meet,
By saving money on the Fleet,

Embrace me, boy! I felt afraid
That you would never find your mission;
You knew no sort of craft or trade,
But here's your métier ready-made !

Were ashes ; now to flame you fan 'em ;
No need to toil or spin or chauff
When you can comfortably loaf,
And touch £300 per annum.

THE KAISER has recently been at work
on a canvas symbolic of the idea of a
Happy Marriage. The moral of the
picture is, we understand, that Marriage
is not so bad as it is painted.
By-the-by, with reference to the state-
ment that the KAISER was kept weather-
bound for an entire day at Wilhelms-
haven by a gale, we are requested to
state that His Majesty was in mufti at
the time.
A great and much-needed access to
the ranks of American comic writers is
announced. A number of Transatlantic
littérateurs have agreed, at the instance
of Mr. CARNEGIE, to publish books the
contents of which shall be spelt phoneti-

Honours come thick and fast to Mr.
SARGENT. The other day he was invited
to contribute his portrait to the Uffizi
Gallery. Now a writer in The London
Magazine declares that SARGENT would
seem to be the painter to whom the
portrait work of Mr. Hal Hurst is most
closely allied.
First it was the Tariff Reformers, and
now it is Lord MILNER; and the rumour

A SONG OF MARCH.
O EARLY March was early May.
Soft was the air and bland;
The sun diffused a constant ray,
And everything combined to say
That Spring was close at band.
Nature forsook her winter sleep;
And through the rustling wood
The little birds began to cheep;
And oh, to see the lambkins leap
Did one a power of good.
The early flower came bravely out;
In buds of tenderest green
The cryptogam did newly sprout;
The orchard blossom looked about
The best I've ever seen.
So all the land put off the sere,
And filled the day with song:
“The air is warm, the skies are clear,
Now welcome life, and love, and cheer,

scorer, as he is just now training largely

VERY OPEN LETTERS.
A NEW method of advertising books
by an open letter from the publisher
to the author giving him information
as to the progress of sales, &c., has
already been essayed in a tentative and
colourless fashion. It is to be hoped, in
the interests alike of authors and readers,
that this plan will be shortly developed
on the bolder and more characteristic
lines sketched in the following specimen
letters :---
DEAR BROTHER, --It is with a deep
sense of gratitude and thankfulness for
all mercies that we sit down to inform
you that your beautiful story Is Father

references and the noble advertisement
it has received from the Episcopal Bench.

DEAR MR. HACK,—We cannot refrain
from putting pen to paper to inform you
of the glad and unexpected tidings that
another copy of your admirable book of
essays has been sold. This makes the
fifth in six months- a result for mutual /
congratulations.
We are, dear Mr. Hack,
Yours courteously,

DEAR MR. LEE Boo, I am directed to
inform you in an open letter that the
success of your prophetic military
romance is terrific. As you may have
noticed, we are printing an instalment

pessima, and Mr. JAMES is a living
example of the truth of this luminous
dictum. In his long, inglorious, though
highly lucrative career, he has written
more tedious, more insipid, more pre-
tentious plays than The Hallucinations
of Hetty, but he has never 'ruined along
the illimitable inane' with greater
velocity than in this sickening pseudo-
comedy.
“The effrontery which he las dis-
played in ransacking the dustbins of his
effete imagination for the delectation of
a depraved democracy is only one more
example of the courage of ignorance-
which, as ARISTOTLE tells us, is one of
the lowest and most perverted forms of
that virtue. Mr. JAMES is like the
BOURBONS and the Duke of DEVONSHIRE.
He has learnt nothing and he has forgotten
nothing. But he is so far inferior to
them that he knew absolutely nothing
to start with. That notorious Blenheim
pup, Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL-an even
more poisonous politician than Mr. BIRRELL
or Mr. ByLes—could hardly in his most
insensate moments have perpetrated such
clotted nonsense as this atrocious play.
We will not abuse the patience of our
readers by attempting to sketch the
plot. We should only besmirch our-
selves and them in the process. It is
enough to say that it is as mad as the
Blue Water mania of the distorted doc-
trinaires who run the Committee of
National Defence. As for the acting, it
was if possible worse than the play.
Sir ALFRED KIMBALL, the most ghastly
histrionic mandarin who ever disgraced
the calling of GARRICK, blundered through
such of his lines as he contrived to
remember. Mr. Philip SAMPSON wore
three pairs of well-cut trousers in the
rôle of the hero, and Miss VINOLIA
BAMBOROUGH gave a realistic imitation of
St. Vitus's dance in that of Hetty, a
female bounder of the most deadly type.

The hour draws nigh. The moments fly amain.
Rabble and guest attend the flowery shrine;
The Cake is ready.--also the champagne

Then, Sister, ere the last sad moment goes,
Listen, while from a brother's faltering lips
Drop, like essential attar of the rose,
Two useful tips.
If you would prosper in that married state
Which many, I believe, have called sublime,
Be very careful not to irritate
At breakfast time.
Man is not lively at that solemn feast;
And John, whom you esteem a thing apart,
(So strange is Love) is little more than triste,
Or less than tart.
Spare him your daily correspondents' views ;
Nor, from a paper you alone have read,
Think to refresh him with th' appalling news
That someone's dead.
As for those details of a household type
That seem indigenous to married men,
Wait till he's half way through his morning pipe :
Tackle him then.
But, oh my sister, lay no wifely snares;
Think not to press him for a boon; and don't,
Don't dream of getting at him unawares :
Because you won't.
That we will come to now. And, I should say,
I do so with a certain lingering doubt;
Though, truly, if I give your John away,
It's his look out.
If, then, you would beguile th' unwary lad
To his undoing, first arrange to dine
On his most toothsome cheer (and, shall I add,
Some light, dry wine).
And if, soon afterwards, you gently spring,
Your purpose on him, 'twere an easy task
To lure him on to any blessed thing
You choose to ask.
Now must we go. The steeds are at the door.
Those be my precepts, Sister. Act thereon,
And you 'll be happy. But alas, for poor,
Poor, wretched, JOHN! Dun-Dum.

QUESTIONS OF THE HOUR.
To assist those of his readers who are
anxious to follow intelligently the pro-
gress of the Education Bill, Mr. Punch
has put together a short examination
paper. No student, he ventures to think,
who arrives at satisfactory answers to
his questions, should fail to appreciate
an allusion, nor will the most divergent
and conflicting views have power to
surprise him.
1. Where did Mr. BIRRELL, construct
the speech with which he introduced
his measure? Mention any picturesque
incident by which his attention was
diverted during the process.
2. Prove that the Bill (a) “is a moder-
ate and unsectarian measure,” (1) “is an
outrage on Churchmen," (c) “is a wise
compromise,” (d) “is a tyrannical abuse
of power,” (e) “preserves the Christian
morals of the nation,”and (f) “violates the
first principles of Christianity.” Recon-
cile these views, and say in cach case
by whom precisely they are held.
3. Justify and confute the expressions
“strangling Christianity" and "endow-
ing Dissent” as applied to the Bill.
4. Translate “simple Bible teaching"
and “undenominational religion ” into
Anglican terms; and give the Noncon-
formist equivalents for “confiscation,”
“Church public spirit," and "a tyran-
nical court."
. 5. Enumerate the different varieties of
the Nonconformist conscience. Justify
as many of these as you can.
6. “Dear Mr. BAINES :”Who is this
personage, and what historical part has
he played in the controversy ?
7. Annotate: “Column B.,” “Dear

DEAR SIR,- Life in the country has its
drawbacks as well as its advantages.
For example, in this part of Humpshire

seven miles of my house, and play on
the 9-hole course close by is restricted

DEAR Sır, — Why should motorists
alone be obliged to give warning of their
approach at cross roads and corners ?
The only efficient way to minimise
collisions is to insist that all who use
the roads should make their advent
audible. Horsemen should have a bell
or horn affixed to the pummel of their
saddles, while pedestrians should have
a similar means of signalling attached to
the handles of their sticks and umbrellas.

BALLOONING FOR BEGINNERS.
[Week-end balloon parties, according to The
Car, are the latest form of country-house
attraction.)
BALLOONING is evidently “in the air”
just now, and since, as far as we know,
there is not at present any manual of
etiquette on the subject, we hasten to
fill the gap with the following rules
which the tyro would do well to commit
to memory :--
Never leave the car while in motion -
especially when at a considerable altitude.

It hurts.
Do not stick pins into the envelope,
even if the balloon is a stationary one.
Should your grappling-iron“ grapple"
a harmless old gentleman and lift him
off his feet, do not be too angry with
him; let him down gently.
Take no notice of the rude gibes of
passing pedestrians. You can in your
position afford to look down on such
mere earth-worms.
Keep well on the off side when turn-
ing a sharp corner, and always pass
other balloons (which are travelling in
the same direction) on the left.
Do not throw out empty bottles when
passing over densely-populated urban
rural districts; they will only get broken.
Should you feel an escape of gas, do
not try to locate it with a lighted candle.
Turn the gas off at the main.

AN ODE.
Now in good south I know that Spring is here !
The gay, the jocund Spring
(Ring-ting-a-ling)! .
For see, on every hand
The signs, the signs and portents re-appear,
And all is brave, and bountiful, and bland.
Now the commodious mansions of the Great
Disdain anew their wintry grime,
And in no time
The wanton one, the plumber,
Prepares them 'gainst the summer
In dress of glassy white;
Cool, doubtless, and remarkably ornate,
Though trying to the sight.
(Saving for those that wear no vernal dress,
For whom no paint was newly wet,
Who, darkly looming in the vivid row,
Hang out pathetic signals of distress -
To wit-" To Let !
So are the chairs !
Here would we sit, and, for a fleeting span,
Let the soft breezes fan
Our brows, and breathe the Babylonian airs :--
Save for yon minion, ever crying “Pence"-
Cursed be he, I say! ('ome, let us hence.
Some round of wool, and seeming-fat,
Black as your hat,
Contented of regard, or half asleep :-
And others, shorn to half their former size,
Come forth, all coyly skinned,
To the untempered wind
In outraged nakedness, with downcast eyes.
Last of the vernal signs :
Lapped in the fretted umbrage of the trees,
Calmly oblivious of the city's hum,
See where reclines
Th’ unwashen wastrel in his verminous case !
For Spring, indeed, has come! Dum-Dum.
See now where at the meeting of the ways
Conflicting traffics press from every side

First Lord of the Treasury is too high.
Many men in Bungay are found to fill
public offices without reward, and it is
held that the Prime Minister should do
so too.
An enthusiastic meeting was held at
the Parish Room, Peperharow, on Wed-

gathering was fulfilled by a resolution
relegating the present measure to limbo.

“Zulu” for the Baker Street and Waterloo

that this humorous piece of nomenclature
is London's new catch-phrase, and can
be heard in every bus, tram, or steamer.
It is also going the round of the provin-
cial Clubs. The idea arose as follows:
The Zoo, or Zoological Gardens, is in
close proximity to Regent's Park Station
on the above line. Loo is the tail-end
of Waterloo. Zoo-loo, without change
of sound, may be facetiously written as
“Zulu,” which is the name of a tribe
now in revolt in South Africa. The title

THE SONGFISH.
OH! have you heard the Songfish
In mellow, moonlit hours ?
He's really quite the wrong fish
To chaff about his pow'rs.
He calls the moon “ Astarte,”
And begs to intimate
That she's the only party
He doesn't scorn and hate.
And thus laments the Songfish,
Rocked in a sapphire sea :
“Would I were such a long fish
That I might reach to thee,
With music for our mansion
In a world of rhythmic time,
The waves in perfect scansion,
The ripples all in rhyme.”
Oh! have you seen the Songfish
In iridescent state ?
In scent and hue a strong fish
He pleases not the great.
Ile shocks the Peer and Bishop,
But, gaily, in the slums
His patrons as they dish-up,
Exclaim, “O how he hums!”
Oh! would you catch the Songfish,
Deep artifice employ ;
Never without a gong fish,
It acts as a decoy.
Down where the dogwatch dangles
Your beating will be heard,
As through those dusky tangles
He warbles like a bird.
Oh! reverence the Songfish,
Consult his lightest whim,
From Harrow to Hong-Kong fish
For nothing else but him.
And if, through moral blindness,
He use an evil word,
(He'll well repay the kindness)
Pretend you have not heard.

So lavish a selection of potential little brides,
Both dark and fair, and plump and spare,
Of broad or narrow views,
Retiring, bold, or young or old-
Still fail to fire the least desire
The others leave me cold.
The only girls who draw me have drawn other people too,
And being safely wedded they are bound to be taboo ;
A thousand eyes watch every prize
As soon as she comes out;
The old and plain alone remain,
And these I'll do without.
Ah, happy, happy bachelor! for whom kind Fate provides
So lavish a selection of potential little brides ;
And happier still, while maidens thrill
And wait my beck and call,
That I may wink and gloat to think
I needn't beck at all!
ELIZA JANE is willing ; so, I'm told, is MARY ANN,
And MILLICEN'T would jump at any eligible man;
EILEEN and Sue, and Kitty too,
And Trixy, MADGE, MARIE,
With Nell and Poll and Nance and MOLL
Are waiting all for me.
But I am not attracted by the good ELIZA JANE ;
Her soul may be perfection, but her face is very plain.

Though 'mid immortals numbered,

In deep oblivion slumbered.

While purporting to make him plain
Obscured his real teaching.

When Mayfair, blocked with carriages,

That Spanislı dancing is inspired ;
That temperance is narrow;
That no improvements are required
At Eton or at Harrow;
That Emma, not Trafalgar, made
The name of Nelson glorious;
That bus-conducting is a trade
Exalting though laborious;
That Germany is overfed ;
That care besets the wealthy ;
That as a rule we stay in bed
Far longer than is healthy ;
That heroes in their early days
Have need of endless kisses;
That Bach, though meriting high praise,
MASCAGNI's fervour misses ;
That Dr. En Reich foretold
The coming of MARCONI ;
That Littré, overworked and old,
Grew very thin and bony;
That RAPHAEL'S Platonic bent
Is mirrored in his pictures ;
That some Americans resent

BEAU MONT was agreeable. The part-

some years. They couldn't bear to be
separated. They lived in the same
house, wore the same clothes (not of

the same plate.

their unanimity was marvellous. FLETCHER
was the better of the two at spelling,
although neither of them was much at
it, and he did most of the actual writing.
BEAU MONT would dictate, and FLETCHER
would take it down. This suited them
both.

THE PAUPER'S PARADISE.
[“ Recent revelations point to Poplar as the pauper's paradise.”—
Daily Paper.]
I USED to be haunted : a phantom of dread
Would hover o' nights round my terrified bed-
The phantom of Age with a banking account
That had dwindled away to a minus amount.
Then bitter would rise the regrets in my heart
That I'd ever been lured by the sirens of Art
To dally with letters and fool away time
In the idle pursuit of the frivolous rhyme.
Why, why had my footsteps been suffered to stray
From the land of red tape and of regular pay,
With annual increments, pensions that flow
To elderly parties of sixty or so ?
But glorious news has been brought to my ear-
Away with you, sorrow! avaunt, craven fear!
The phantom that filled me of old with affright
Has now been transformed into one of delight.
I hear there's a haven of plenty at hand,
Where the pauper may feast on the fat of the land,
And whoso would enter its generous gates
Has nothing to do but to go on the rates.
No hectoring Bumbles are there to confound
The pauper-it's rather the other way round;
For there he is king, and he's able to boo
The master, the cook, and the guardians too.
Is he ragged? They hasten to bring him new suits
And soft undergarments and beautiful boots.
Is he hungry? They give him the best of good cheer-
Beef- not from Chicago-and barrels of beer.
As for work, he is only expected to take
A turn now and then, just for exercise' sake;
Or, should he be fond of the fashions, a chap
May drive round the park in a smart little trap.
Then, Penury, welcome! Old Age, speed me fast
To the pleasantest place where one's lines can be cast;
And help me, dame Fortune, to struggle to port
By hook or by Crooks to this Poplar resort.

cheapness is one of the great charms of
the al-fresco couch ; but it is advisable
to remove the stove every morning, and,
of course, to replace it at night, a job
requiring not more than two able-bodied
porters, unless of course some suitable
hiding-place or cache can be devised in
the face of the cliff. The operation of
letting down a heavy stove over the edge
is rather dangerous, and on one occasion,
when sleeping out at the cliffs of Moher

(2) If you sleep on a bed like this,
with your head exposed, it is as well
to wear some kind of a silk or a talc
helmet, or hatlet, that will come down
well over the back of the neck and keep
away the draughts and other insects.
This has also the additional and æsthetic
advantage of causing the sleeper-out to
bear a partial resemblance to Mr. HOLBEIN

(3) All people are not able to sleep out-
of-doors in the strong light of the early
morning. There are some to whom dark-
ness is an essential condition of sound
slumber. For them something a little
more elaborate, but still wonderfully sim-
ple, can easily and cheaply be arranged.
Personally I recommend a canopy of
black waterproofed silk or aquascu-
taneous satin, stretched on a framework
of aluminium, supported by four Venetian
masts. This will keep off rain and dew,
and provide you with the necessary de-
gree of darkness.
(4) On sultry nights it is dangerous to
dispense with a punkah. This may be
worked either by a punkah-wallah im-

engine driven by your gas stove.

I sympathised, but had the grace to
confess I also had been guilty.
“You don't look as if you would do
it again,” she answered-rather cruelly,
I thought.
"But it's not 'dove' and 'glove'
and 'above,'" she continued, “that I
dislike most. It's the others.”
“ The others ?"
“Yes; those, although boring, are all
right; tiring, perhaps, but well bred,
perfectly bred. It's the impostors I
can't stand, the parvenus: 'move' and
'grove' and 'prove. I have to take
their arms quite as often as the others,
and it hurts me horribly.”
"Poor thing!" I murmured.
“Not only on week-days,” she went
on, “but on Sundays too. I hardly
ever go to church without ‘move' or
prove' to make me uncomfortable."
I sympathised with more confidence,
for I have never written a hymn.
“But I must not be too hopeless," she
continued, “ for it's better than it used to
be. Would you believe it, in the sixties
and seventies I was often made to join
bands with such outsiders as 'of' and
'whereof!' But that's gone out now.”
“Still, after so much experience, aren't
you growing liardened ?” I asked --

“I ought to be, I suppose," she said,
"but it's not easy. I still dread the
Spring, and I never hear a man groan
but I shudder. 'Ilere's another poet,'
I say to myself: 'now for it.'”
I secretly hoped I had not groaned.
“Yet it's no gcod minding or worry-
ing,” she continued. “For there's no
way out of it. Except one,” she added.
“And that is ? " I asked.
“Only if someone would invent a few
new rhymes. Couldn't that be done?

M R. PUNCH stopped suddenly. Then he drew out a handkerchief and wiped his brow, his hand trembling with
M excitement the while. The chance for which he had waited so long was come.
Before him stood a high and sinister building, which at first sight appeared to be deserted. But the keen eye of
MR. Punch had detected a figure at the top window, and the romantic mind of MR. PUNCH had jumped to the only
conclusion --Andromeda waiting for her Perseus ! A twentieth-century maiden wanting the help of a man's
right arm!
He motioned to Toby to stay where he was, advanced cautiously to the foot of the building, and gave a low whistle.
“Stop!” cried the lady suddenly. “Who are you?”
“Fair and beauteous maiden,” whispered the gallant Mr. PUNCH, “I am come to save thee. Fear not."
“Go away!” she cried. “You are the bailiff. I shall never surrender. Nothing but force will compel me-and
you wouldn't use force on a woman!”
“There is some mistake,” said the Sage in his natural voice. “You seemed to be in need of assistance, and --_”.
"You have come for the taxes,” broke in the lady. “ Very well. I refuse to pay them. Now then !”
“Madam,” said Mr. PUNCH, a trifle exasperated by all this, “I have not even come for the washing." .
“I beg your pardon. Of course I recognise you now. You are on our side."
Mr. Punch bowed. “If I only knew,” he began.
“What!” said the lady in amazement, “ you haven't heard of us? Wait, then, and I will show you.” She took a
flag from her side, and held it out of the window. “There !” she said proudly.
Mr. Punch looked carefully. There were some letters on the flag, and they seemed to him to be Russian characters.
“My influence with the CZAR,” he said, “such as it is
The lady blushed. “I'm sorry,” she explained. “I see I was holding it upside down again. Somehow we
generally do. Now then, look !”
Mr. Punch looked, and read :
"So I do,” he cried enthusiastically. “I votes for 'em always.
• () woman! lovely woman! Nature made thee
There's in you all that we believe of Heaven,
To temper man; we had been brutes without you;
Amazing brightness, purity, and truth,
Angels are painted fair to look like you :

“Then you agree,” said the lady, “that we ought to have the franchise ?”
“O-ho!” said MR. PUNCH,“ that is a very different thing."
“But I pay taxes, and taxation without representation is tyranny.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
At this, Toby, who pays a tax-a slight tax of seven-and-sixpence per annum-stood up and wagged his tail.
“My dog, at any rate, agrees with you,” said MR. PUNCH.
“And you do too?" she asked. “You think we should be allowed to vote at elections ?”
“Yes," replied MR. PUNCH, “I do. You and your sisters have at last convinced me.”
“Hooray!” cried the lady triumphantly, and she waved her flag. “I knew if we held out long enough we should
convince somebody. Now tell me, what was it particularly that showed you our cause was right? Was it the way we
attacked ASQUITH-was it our display in the House of Commons-was it — ” “Yes,” said Mr. Punch, “it was all that.”
“There! Why, if it hadn't been for us no one would ever have heard of Woman's Suffrage.”
“No,” said MR. PUNCH; "and if it had not been for you I should never have believed in it. Until you began your
- your demonstrations I was opposed to it. Logically, I adınit, it seemed all right. So far as intellect went you were
superior to many of us. Yet, somehow, politics and women-I did not like to consider them together. An election is an
unpleasant business, a rowdy business; and I do not care to see women in a rough-and-tumble. A woman,” continued
the romantic Mr. Punch, "should never be in a hurry, should never be in a ridiculous situation, should never have to raise
her voice. A woman should always be cool and composed. Politics is neither a cooling nor a composing game.
“ Then, again, I have noticed that the electors of one side find it necessary to break up the meetings of the other
side. At times it is their duty to call one of the speakers a liar. The elector must celebrate his victory by stoning the
defeated. To be, in fact, the Complete Elector one has to forget a good many things. An election,” concluded the SAGE,
“ brings out the very worst of a man; and it is inexcusable for a woman ever to be at anything but her best.”
“But,” said the lady, “I thought you were with us?”
“Those,” said Mr. PUNCH,“ were my views until a short time ago. Now I see differently. I remember an exhibition
in the Ladies' Gallery. I have heard of a woman and a dog-whip at a meeting of Mr. Asquith's. I cannot forget-I do not
think anyone will ever forget-an insult that one of your sisters paid Sir EDWARD GREY. And, as I think on these things,
I realise suddenly what it all means. It means that you have at last descended to our level; that you have put off your
dignity and your womanliness, and are become indeed the Complete Elector. So, Madam, when you get the franchise,
as you will eventually, I shall say to myself —-_” MR. PUNCH hesitated. “Yes?” said she. “Go on.”
“With apologies, Madam-Serve 'em right.”
There was silence for a little. Then, "You don't understand,” said the lady. “I am the mother of a family.
Anyhow," she added, “I shall stay here until we get the franchise.”
“The flag is upside down again," said Mr. PUNCH. The lady hastily put it right.
“And now," said the Sage, “I have something I should like to leave with you. You have a long and lonely vigil
before you, and it would be pleasant to me to think that I was doing something to solace it. Light though it is,” he
added, “I could not throw it up to you.”
“Wait a moment,” said the lady. She went into the room, and returned with a basket tied to a rope.
“The provision-basket,” she said, and let it down gently. MR. PUNCH stood on tip-toe, and placed in it his
