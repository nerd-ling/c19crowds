ENCORE LE Monde ou L'ON SAFFICHE.
[“Mrs. — is giving a little dinner for the Countess of ——'s dance."]
SCANNING the paper with my morning coffee –
Such mental food as “Bargains at the Sales,”
“BIRRELL's Dilemma,” “Eagle Choked by Toffee,”
“The Quake of Earth in Gallant Little Wales,”
“The Wrongs of Suffragettes, and How to Right 'em,”
“Tragedy on a Cliff-the Fatal Shove,”
I came upon the really poignant item
Recorded just above.
Madam, I had not guessed your social station,
Nor even learned your name before to-day ;
The loss was mine; I suffered that privation
With simple fortitude as brave men may ;
Until your paragraph, perused this morning,
Lit up the nescient gloom in which I sat,
I had received no hint, no sort of warning,
That you would dine like that.
'Tis not the vulgar cost of wine and victual
That makes, of such a meal, a world-event;
The dinner, modestly described as “little,”
Would not demand this bold advertisement ;
It is the sequent ball that craves recital,
The noble house to which your guests will go–
That is the salient matter, that the vital
Thing for us all to know.
And now we know it; and to this instruction,
For which a grateful public thanks you much,
Each of us adds the obvious deduction
That it has cost you, say, a guinea touch.
The earthquake, and the eagle (rapta fatis)
Whose toffee-surfeit everyone deplores,
Get their advertisement for nothing (gratis);
You had to pay for yours! O. S.
NATURE STUDIES.
THE AMERICAN MoTHER.
At this season London and the other European capitals
teem with the American Mother. Far away, in New York,
in Boston, in Chicago, in Philadelphia, in Pittsburg, in
Cincinnati or in Milwaukee, the American Father toils at
his accustomed industry. Not for him are the joys of
the impassioned chase from city to city and from country
to country. His duty is to stay at home with the Irish hired
girl and the cook and the little dog; to make money and to
remit it in plenty, while his wife, that gallant and indomi-
table woman, speeds over leagues and leagues of sea and
land in the company of her sister, of four young children
and of a sort of nurse; and dragging with her, wherever
she goes, an Ossa-Pelion of gigantic trunks and boxes.
Nothing terrifies the American Mother. She faces with
an equal heart the luxurious discomforts of an Atlantic
steamer and the dietary dangers of a British hotel. No
foreign language appals her. She may be heard denouncing
in her native American the iniquitous charges of a Parisian
cocher or appreciating the mild courtesies of a Prussian
railway guard. She is at home in cathedrals and in palaces,
and is as little abashed by the splendours of courts as she
is daunted by the difficulties of the most complicated journey.
Whatever may be her goal she always contrives to get there,
sometimes battered with travel and worn out by the care of
her belongings, but always with the triumphant air of a
conqueror. Hear her, as I have heard her, in the office of
Messrs. Cook:-
“Now see here, I want to do everything that everybody
else has done. Don't you smile, young man, but just listen
to me. I want to do the round trip to Windsor Castle and
Stratford-on-Avon'' (both the syllables of Avon are largely and
deliberately pronounced), “and Birmingham, and Canterbury,
and York and the Land's End. I don't care how you fix it
so's you fix it for me to see everything that's to be seen.
There's six of us — no, seven-Land sakes, I forgot my sister
AMELIA—seven of us. There's myself - that 's one—and the
four children, ULYsses (we named him for General GRANT) and
TheoLoRE (he 's for the PRESIDENT) and JosephixE VAssAR and
little AGNES MARTHA. That's five. Then there's AMELIA and
Miss DRESSER, and that makes seven ; and we want the best
rates you can give, for we’re going to do a mighty big business
with your firm, young man, and if you treat us fair I'm
bound to take tickets here for Paris, Berlin, and Vienna.
You'd better start making up that list so 's I can have it
when I get back from this trip. And, sce here, just you fix
the hotels for us and have your agents on hand at the
stations, and tell me if there's any ice-cream soda to be had
in Stratford-on-Avon. ULYSSEs can't get along without ice-
cream soda, and if there's a candy-store anywhere JOSEPHINE’s
bound to find it. And, see here——” so the stream runs on,
and in the end the American Mother gets everything she
wants, and travels victoriously through England on a round
trip never before devised.
With such women, and there are many of them, America
ought to be able to accomplish anything. Yet it must be
observed that, though they are as rocks of granite in the
presence of hotel-managers, cab-drivers, and all kinds of
officials, they are mere wax in the hands of their stern and
determined children. Whatever ULYSSEs asks for he always
gets, and THEODORE is equally fortunate in the fulfilment of
his desires. JosephixE WASSAR is never seen without a large
box of chocolates, and AGNES MARTHA (aged 3) constantly
soothes her infant troubles with handfuls of mixed sweets.
They all take lunch, and not infrequently dinner, with their
parent, and it is pleasant to see them tucking away roast
chicken or cutlets at an hour when their tiny English cousins
are safely in the land of Nod. They rule the American
Mother with a rod of iron, and she submits to them with a
meek resignation which might well serve as a pattern to
English mothers. At last, after much travel and innumerable
digestive feats, they return home and resume there those
habits of despotism to which their European experiences have
accustomed them. And it is quite certain that in the whole
round of her travels, though distracted by her children and
assailed by all the difficulties of effete European civilisations
and unwonted languages, the American Mother will have
held her own in face of the world, and will not have lost so
much as a piece of muslin out of her pile of luggage. Here's
wishing her the same strength to her elbow. More she
couldn't have.
To F. C. G. on his Knighthood.
A LIBERAL bumper to “The Only Asset !”
And Mr. Punch, with glass aloft, cries “Placet !”
The Cork Constitution quotes Father BERNARD WAtoll AN as
follows:– “Women, whose dainty feet were set upon a rung
high up the social ladder, were easily condoned those sins
for which their sisters lower down would be severely con-
demned and tatooed.” We hope this will catch Mr. Swift
MACNEILL's eye.
The Daily Mirror, in describing the hunt for two lunatics
near Bexley, says: “The escaped lunatics had shown their
cunning by throwing away their red ties, which are known
in the district as the lunatic badges.” Mr. KEIR HARDIE,
however, never thought much of Bexley.

SIBYLLA BRITANNICA.
(From her Town House near Whitehall.)
SIR,--I am ordered to advert
To your complaint about a shirt
And trousers which were torn last May,
I note, in Hammersmith Broadway,
While you, intent O.H.M.S.,
Driving a Parcel Post Express,
Did not perceive a rusty nail
Protruding from the Royal Mail,
Which, penetrating to the seat
Of all the trouble—I repeat,
You did not at the time perceive
What should have made you promptly
leave
Your place, at risk of starting late,
And fill up Form 298
Provided for a case like this,
Which no employé ought to miss
Who understands official matters,
And so your clothes were torn to tatters!
The Board exceedingly regret
The circumstance, but cannot let
Your ignorance of “comme il faut,”
Or what Officials ought to know,
Provide you at the Nation's cost
With what you never need have lost.
A minute has been duly made,
And will officially be laid
Before the Board; a time and place
Arranged for you to state your case.
I do not think you could do better
Than wait on them and read this letter.
And-though the phrase seem somewhat
fervent—
I am, Sir, Your obedient servant.
LITERARY GOSSIP.
It is reported that Mr. GEORGE MooRE
is so much incensed by correspondents
who confuse him with his namesake,
the namby-pamby Irish melodist, that
he is thinking seriously of changing his
name to BENVENUTO CASANOVA. We under-
stand that his new romance, entitled
My Shambles, is being extensively stocked
by the booksellers of the Chicago packing
houses.
The Dowager Duchess of PANGBoURNE,
who has recently joined the hatless
brigade, will shortly publish a collection
of golfing stories, entitled Wigs on the
Green. Professor SIMs WooDHEAD will
contribute a short introduction, and
there will be a number of instantaneous
photographs of the Grand Duke Michael,
the Duke of DEvoNshire, Lord HALSBURY,
and other famous golfers, illustrating
the correct and incorrect attitude for
different strokes.
A new weekly illustrated journal will
shortly appear under the pleasing title
of The Blue Blood Book. A number of
gifted and highly - placed personages
have joined the editorial staff, including
Mrs. LoNgworth, the KAISER, Lady
WARWICK (who will edit the Socialist
page with Mr. Will. Thorn E, M.P.), the
Duke of FIFE, who will write on Weird
Wind Instruments of the Western
Hebrides; and Mr. ALGERNoN ASHTON,
who will discourse on Aristocratic
Tombstones.
Mr. Coulson KERNAHAN's new novel
The Dumpling, the opening scene of
which is laid in an opium den, has
happily inaugurated a reaction against
the morbidly introspective nomenclature
so prevalent in contemporary fiction.
Amongst forthcoming novels on the list
of Messrs. TROTTER AND STOUT we notice
Sausages and Mashed, by Sir ALBERT
PoRKER, and Cow's Heel Romances, by
IAN McCRoCKETT.

CHARIVARIA.
The removal of the War Office De-
partment from Pall Mall to Whitehall
will begin shortly. The suggestion
that the authorities should sell the fur-
niture in use at the old building and
repurchase it at an enhanced price for
the new one has been declined.
We hear that a novelty shortly to be
introduced at one of our Music Halls
will be a man who will eat a quantity of
American tinned meat in full view of
the audience. He will call himself “The
Human Ostrich II.”
It is rumoured that Mr. FREDERIC
CowPN, by way of appreciation of his
success at the Crystal Palace, will shortly
have a Handel to his name.
Nowadays, we suppose, we all suffer
from swollen heads. Anyhow, three
specimens of the Microcephalous or
Small-head type, now on exhibition at
a London Music Hall, are described as
belonging to “a strange, unfamiliar,
people.” --
The Lancet draws attention to the
case of a man of pronounced Saxon
colour and build who is gradually ac-
quiring all the physical features of an
Oriental. ('uriously enough only the
other day the reverse process took place
at one of our popular seaside resorts.
It was an Ethiopian minstrel who was
caught in the rain without an umbrella.
With reference to the impending
legislation in regard to the control of
news in war-time, the Government, it is
stated, has given an assurance that the
proposed regulations shall not be applic-
able in the case of a small war. If we
remember rightly, the Boer War was
regarded as a small-sized one at first.
When passing near “The Cat and
Fiddle,” Buxton, a motor-car shot across
the road into a limestone wall, went
through the wall, and rolled over and
over down the hill-side until it was
brought up by another wall 210 feet
below. None of the three passengers
was much injured, but The 1)angerous
Performances Act will be useful if it
discourages such foolhardy feats.
By-the-by, we understand that even if
the Dangerous Performances Bill be
passed, the Government will persist in
its attempt to force the Education Bill
on the country.
The fact that proceedings have been
taken against a native of Westmeath for
living under the same roof with his
calves has caused a certain amount of
consolatory satisfaction to persons with
wooden legs. -
The recent Funeral Freak Dinner,
though a pretty fancy, was scarcely the
novelty which the promoter imagined it
to be. We have more than once been
present at a Dinner Party the chief
feature of which has been the decorous
solemnity which one usually associates
with obsequies.
Although part of the proposal was
that a portion of the proceeds should
go in diminution of the rates, an offer
to transfer the entire Poplar Inquiry
to the stage of a well-known house of
light entertainment has been rejected
petulantly by all concerned.
The Basford (Notts) Board of Guar-
dians has decided to keep fowls in
preference to pigs. We fancy that a
similar change will have to be made at
Poplar.
In America the resentment caused by
Mr. WINTER, the English tailor, being
commissioned to advise as to American
Army uniforms has died out, owing to a
more interesting scandal having arisen.
WINTER, in fact, has been forgotten
owing to the THAws.
The Home Office has ordered Colonial
tinned meat to be used in future in our
convict establishments. A number of
prisoners had threatened to leave unless
the change were made.
What are described as “Corridor
Milk Trains" are to be run on the
London and North Western Railway.
The prospect of additional comfort has,
we understand, given the liveliest satis-
faction to the milk microbes, many of
which foolish creatures are already pic-
turing themselves, in their heated ima-
ginations, as moving freely up and down
the train on their way to town.
Inciting to Crime.
“THE lad was described as lazy; and
when his mother asked him to go to
work he threatened to smash her brains
out. The case was adjourned for three
weeks in order to give the lad another
chance.”
A REMARKABLE CoincideNCE.-" For the
second time this year Lancashire were de-
feated yesterday.”

“Vicarage to let. One servant kept; 800 ft.
above sea; pretty.”—Standard.
“TALL and good-looking” is the more
usual formula for parlour-maids.
PERILS OF THE PURSE.
[As recorded in “Septic Hints" (last issue of
Punch) attention has been drawn to the risk of
infection involved in the handling of money.]
I would not lose, I dare not win
So cards I used to revel in
(Poker, or Bridge, or Euchre)
Must be taboo, for I of late
Rightly begin to estimate
The filthiness of lucre.
Oh avarice' whose eager tooth
Of old was keen to fix frail youth,
And potent to encliant age,
Now science sets your victims free,
Since all your baits appear to be
But coins of disadvantage.
Yet, kindly Editor, I pray
Grudge not my verse its wonted pay;
Though B. M. J. or Lancet
Asserts the power of gold to kill,
Yet do not spare me, Sir, I will
Heroically chance it.
* COLFERS AS I 'AWE KNOWN.”
(By a Caddie.)
II.
THERE's some as takes their golf too
seerius fer their strength, like that pore
old Mister GIGGINGTON, of 'oom I've told
yer, and there's some as don't take it
seerius enuff. Under this 'eading I
places Mister 'ERMINIUs BRELLETT. 'E's
what they call a litterry cove in privit
life, and, wifout wishing to be undoolly
'arsh, I must say as I beleeves it of 'im.
Strike me pink, if I didn't know as 'e
was litterry, I should go away some-
times after 'earing 'im talk, and swear
a hinfermashun of loomacy agin 'im
But CHAWLEY MARTIN, one of our caddies,
'oo once spoke quite hintermate and
friendly like wif a reporter feller, in con-
mecshun wif a biking accerdent caused
by CHAwl.EY's unforchernate pashun fer
trick riding, ses as 'ow all these pore
riters is alike. So you and me should
only pitty them. As fer 'is golf, ex-
sentrick ain't the word fer it. 'E stands
wif both 'is feet quite klose together,
springs 'igh into the air wif a tremenjus
swing, and strikes the ball afore 'e comes
to earth agin. The erstonishing thing
is that 'e does strike it albart once in
three, and when 'e does it goes like old
Gewillikins. It just shows as there
ain't no rules abart some peeple's golf.
But the sad part is as 'e's quite proud
of 'is stile, insted of laberring to kerrect
it under my tewishun.
“I’m a mishonnery, a pyoneer of
golf, "ENERY,” 'e ses to me quite recent.
“'Ow I plays it to-day, the rest of the
silly 'ide-bound creetures will play it
to-morrow,” 'e ses.

respeckfull and reely meaning the words;
fer, if yer think of it, a course full of
Mister 'ERMINIUs BRELLETTS would be
an 'iddeous sight. 'E glared at me fer
a moment quite dangerous, and then 'e
began to larf. What wif is livver, at
which 'e's allus cussing, and is kurious
'arf - irriterble, 'arf-manniackal temper,
I can tell yer 'e takes some andling.
But 'ENERY WILRs knows 'is 'ERMINIus
BRELLETT by this time.
“Your one chawnce of ſime, you
retched child,” 'e ses, and I found is
stile of speaking jest a little gorling,
“will rest on the fact that you karried
the clubs of ERMINIUs BRELLETT, pyoneer
of golf and unerpreshiated riter of him-
mortal books,” 'e ses. Well, yer can't
argue wif a man like that. Yer can
only yumour 'im by respeckful silence,
and be reddy all the time to dodge if
'is manyer turns 'ommersidal all of a
sudden.
'E took on Mister WASHER the other
day, a member oom both 'e and I 'ave
little liking fer. At least, I can armser
fer meself. Fer 'e's one of your pom-
pus, strutting sort of fellers, 'oo thinks
'e's good at golf, but ain't. I'eard 'im
chalenge Mister BRELLETT to play a rarnd
fer 'arf-a-crown, and a less skilful
stoodent of yuman nachure than "ENERY
WILRs could 'ave told as they didn't
love each other. I 'ad a privit tuppence
on the match meself, wif old WASHER's
caddy, although not very opeful. Ow-
ever, when "ENERY WILRs' money is
down, as the sying is, 'e's 'ard to beat.
But things went badly wif us from
the start. I could see as 'ow Mister
BRELLETT was wurried abart somethink,
and in addition to that 'e was acktaly
trying to play a keerful, sientifick gime.
Oh, lumme, it was orful, I can tell yer'
We was skarcely touching a ball, and
old WASIIER, as pleesed as a turkey-kock
but far less hornimental, was playing
right above 'isself. Fer a man like
meself, oo'd staked above is means, it
was 'art-breaking. We lost five 'oles
bang orf, and then Mister BRELLETT spoke
'arf to me and 'arf to 'isself as we walked
to the sixth tee.
“It's all that cussed nime !” 'e ses.
“If I could only think of that, I'd be
orlright. A female nime fer a kerrecter
in my new book. "ENERy, what's the
nime of your yung woman 2" 'e ses,
joking like. Well, love ain't much in
my line, me ambishuns not letting me
amper meself wif wimmen, but still a
feller as to keep is and in. I won't
say as I 'aven't been more run after
than most, but someow that ain't one
of my temptashuns. Owever, more to
pleese 'er than meself, I lets one of them,
jest a school kiddy, walk out wif me at
times. She means well, I do believe,
but I've allus reckoned as 'ow 'er nime's

“But she can't 'elp it,” I ses.
“By Jewpiter!” 'e owls. “HERVANGE-

'e ses.
“You’ll win it orlright, Sir,” I ses,
ernest like. “But, for 'evin's sake, stop
playing sientifick! Play the old gime

“I beleeve as 'ow you're right,
"ENERY,” 'e ses, thoughtful like; and
then we come to the tee and watched
old WASHER drive is yusual straight,
shortish ball. Then Mister BRELLETT
grips is club, takes 'is yusual wicked,
himmoril stance, springs 'igh into the
air wif an 'arf-styſled yell, and, by Gewil-
likins, drives sich a ball as the pro.
'isselſ might 'ave been proud on ' It

'e's a man as only plays is best

a marsty lead, but we stuck to 'em
like wax, 'itting a turrifick ball once
out of three, or even oftener, and we
won at last quite landsomely by three
and two.
I remember as I bought bull's-eyes
fer HERVANGELINE wif that 'ere tuppence,
becos in a meshure, as you may say,
she'd 'ad an and in the winning of it.
'Owever, wif a jenerosity unyusual in

LINES ON TOMKINS’ AVERAGE.
OF ToMKINs as a natural cricketer
It frequently has been remarked—that IF
He'd had more opportunities of bowling,
And rather more encouragement in batting:
And IF his averages, so disclosed,
Batting and bowling, had been interchanged :
And IF the field as usually set
Contained some post (at the pavilion end)
Whose presence rather than a pair of hands
Was called for ; then, before the season finished,
ToMKINs would certainly have played for Kent.
All this, however, is beside the mark.
Just now I wish to hymn the glorious day
(Ignored by those who write the almanacs,
Unnoticed by the calendar compiler),
That Wednesday afternoon twelve months ago
When ToMKINS raised his average to 2.
Thanks to an interval of accidents
(As “ToxikiNs did not bat”- and “not out 0,”
But this more rarely) Tom KINs' average
Had long remained at 1:3.
(Though Tom KINs, sacrificing truth to pride,
Or both to euphony, left out the dot---
Left out the little dot upon the three,
Only employing it to justify
A second 3 to follow on the first.
Thus, if a stranger asked his average,
Toy KINs would answer lº –
Nor lay the stress unduly on the “one " . . .).
A curious thing is Custom' There are men—
PLU M WARNER is, of course, a case in point—
Who cannot bat unless they go in first.
Others, as HAYES and DENTON, have their place
First wicket down ; while Number Six or so
Is suited best to JEssop. As for To MKINs,
His place was always one above the Byes,
And three allove the Wides. So Custom willed.
Upon this famous Wednesday afternoon
Wickets had fallen fast before the onslaught
Of one who had, as EUCLID might have put it,
No length, or break, but only pace. And pace
Had been too much for nine of them already.
Then entered To M KINs the invincible,
Took guard as usual, “just outside the leg,”
Looked round the field, and mentally decided
To die--or raise his average to two.
Whereon, for now the bowler was approaching,
He struck a scientific attitude,
Advanced the left leg firmly down the pitch,
And swung his bat along the line A. B.
(See RANJITSINIIII's famous book of cricket).
And when the bat and leg were both at B.
(Having arrived there more or less together)
Then Tow KINs, with his usual self-effacement,
Modestly closed his eyes, and left the rest
To Providence and RAN.jY and the bowler
(Forming a quorum); two at least of whom
Resolved that he should neatly glide the ball
Somewhere between the first and second slips.
So Toy KINs did compile a chanceless two.
Once more the bowler rushed upon the crease,
While To MKINs made a hasty calculation
(Necessitating use of decimals)
And found his average was 1:5.
So lustily he smote, and drove the ball
Loftily over long stop's head for one ;
Which brought the decimal to 75,
And ToMKINS, puffing, to the other end.
Where, feeling that the time for risks was come,
He played back to a yorker, and was bowled.
Every position has its special charm.
You go in first, and find as a reward
The wicket at its best; you go in later
And find the fielders slack, the bowling loose.
ToMKINs, who went in just above the Byes,
Found one of them had slipped into his score.
'Tis wise to take the good the gods provide you—
And Toy KINS has an average of 2.
THE COMPLETE (PROCLAMATION) LETTER-WRITER.
[It is reported that the words “Tremble and Obey” are to be deleted
from the Government Proclamations in the Chinese compounds.]
WE understand that the Cabinet has been sitting daily in
order to compile an official Complete Letter-Writer for the
use of his Majesty's Government on future occasions. By
the kindness of the PRIME MINISTER we are enabled to give
one or two specimens of the new method.
1. All future proclamations intended for posting in the
Chinese compounds to end,
“With much love,
Yours very affectionately.”
2. Police regulations for traffic on the occasions of Royal
processions, Lord Mayor's Shows, &c., to begin :
“Will the public be so very good as to take notice that
the following streets will be closed to traffic, &c.," and to end,
“With kindest regards from the Force.” -
3. In the public parks such notices as “Keep Oſ The
Grass,” “No Dogs Allowed,” &c., to run :
“The Commissioner of Woods presents his compliments to
the public and earnestly hopes, &c., &c."
4. Tax and Rate papers to begin :
“DEAR SIR, OR MADAM,
It is once more my duty to send in my little account,” and
to end,
“Hoping this will not inconvenience you. Believe me,
Your affectionate old friend.”
Receipts to be signed,
“Yours lovingly and gratefully.”
It is hoped that the example of the Government may
spread to other public bodies, so that we may see such
notices as “Persons are requested not to walk about the
Abbey during the time of service” rendered more pleasing
by some such pendant as,
“With kindest regards, in which the Chapter joins,
13elieve me, Ever affectionately yours,
J. ARM ITAGE-l'obi NSON,
(Your Dean).

Walking in Battersea Park this morning, |
came across ST. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL. Like
Bottom, though in quite another way, he
was transformed. Had with remarkable
success got himself up as Hamlet, to ||
evident discomfiture of children, who
wanted to ask him what time it was.
Seeing him frown and strut and gather
closer round him his inky cloak, good
mother, they ran off to get information
from other passers-by.
As I walked behind him I heard him

“What is the matter?” I asked,
touching him on the shoulder.
“Murder's the matter,” he answered,
turning on me a glance which but for
the beneficent influence of the spectacles
might have been frenzied.
(Never saw Hamlet in spectacles before.
Rather effective. Forbes Robertson should
try them on.)
“Here am I,” continued St. AugustiNE,
“giving the best days of my comparative
youth to carry a Bill that shall solve

“I notice that he (Dr. Clifford) appears
to speak of me generally by my Christian
name; he said they all knew what “Joey'

Pretty incident varied acrid course of
debate. Since House got into Commit-
tee on Bill C-B. has been in rare attend-
ance. House sympathetically cognisant
of the reason. It knows that to the
burden of Empire the PRIME MINISTER
has added domestic anxieties that cause
him to keep long vigil in a sick room.
This afternoon, in voice threatening to
break down with emotion, he half apolo-
gised for his abstention from Parlia-
mentary duties, tenderly touching on
the cause. Murmur of sympathy rose to
prolonged enthusiastic cheer, joined in
by all sections of Party. Presently
PRINCE ARTHUR made opportunity of
expressing on behalf of himself and his
friends the kindly feeling that animated
them towards a political adversary with
whom they were at the moment in
deadly grip.
This is one of the things the House
always does well. The outburst was
unpremeditated, spontaneous, hearty.
It was more than a token of sym-
pathy in circumstances whose touch
of nature makes the whole world kin.
It was testimony to appreciation of
personal qualities that, mellowing in the
sunlight of prosperity, promise to make

Exultation on Opposition Benches
tumultuous. Not exactly turning out
the Ministry, you know, or even likely
to compel them to drop the Bill. But
100 is only a third of a majority of 300.
Which nobody can deny.
Friday night.--To old Members –
alack' there are not many left of the
period-–CoRBETT's motion for enquiry
into Conventual Institutions recalls two
familiar figures long vanished from the
scene. One was NEwoºg ATE, the other
Major O'GoRMAN. Thirty years ago
NEwdEGATE annually brought in a similar
resolution. It was regularly snuffed out
by big majorities ; incidentally it
brought the MAJOR to the front.
On a June night, in the session of 1874,
NEwoºd ATE having made his motion, there
rose from the Irish Benches a figure of
Falstaffian proportions. This was the
MAJOR, then unknown to fame. Mopping his
forehead, he announced himself “utterly
opposed altogether” to the appointment of
these Royal Commissions. And why?
“I’ll tell you why,” the MAJOR thun-
dered.
He proceeded in dramatic manner to
imagine “one of these Royal Commis-
sioners” going to a convent and de-
manding admission. The door opens.
A nun appears; the Commissioner asks
her what are her station and quality.
“My sire, Sir,” she answered, “was
a king. My mother was the daughter
of the Sixth JAMEs of Scotland and the
First JAMEs of England. His mother,
Sir, was Queen legent of Scotland.”
The House listened in breathless atten-
tion as the burrly MAJOR further climbed
the genealogical tree. With theatrical
instinct he, speaking for this still
anonymous nun, attempted to attune his
voice to the mincing manner of woman.
“Sir, I had a brother,” he continued.
The brother having, like the nun's
ather or mother—it was not clear which
— been mysteriously disposed of, the
MAJoR, taking a fresh breath, proceeded :
“Sir, I had a sister.”
The gallant Member stood silently
impassive whilst the House roared with
'aughter. When it partially subsided,
'le added, “Her name was SoPhi A.”
There was end of opportunity and
the allegory. After gazing for some
moments on the tumultuous scene the
MAJOR sat down, his story, like that of
CAMBUSCAN bold, left half told.
Nothing of this rich humour glinted on
debate on Comb|TT's motion. The pass-
ing of a glass of stout to him midway
in his speech was a poor Jest compared
with Major O'Gorm AN's mellifluous un-
conscious humour.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OCHONE .
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - As a loyal and
patriotic Hibernian I wish to protest in
the strongest terms against the atrocious
and unchivalrous conduct of a section
of the Dublin Corporation. From a
report of the proceedings of that body
in The Irish Times I gather that the
widow MALONE, who for many years had
done the carting of the Corporation, was
deprived of that privilege last January
by the order of the Paving Committee.
Worse still, the High Sheriff, Mr.
MADDEN, on being recently called upon
for an explanation, stated that from the
information he had received Mrs. MALONE
did not exist / So far from her being
a poor widow, “she was a married
woman named CoNNoLLY, having a horse
and cart, which was not her property
at all, but the property of her mother,
Mrs. CoRoom.AN, who lived in Newmarket.”
Just think what these odious insinua-
tions amounted to ' If the widow MALONE
was in reality Mrs. CoNNoLLY, one of the
finest Irish lyrics would be found to rest
on an unsound metrical basis. CoNNOLLY
won't rhyme to “Ochone !” No wonder
then that the action of the High Sheriff
led to the issue of a circular which
wound up with the following compre-
hensive denunciation of Mrs. MALONE's
traducers:–
“May the grass wither from their
feet, may the woods deny them shelter,
earth a grave, and heaven a home !”
It is, therefore, with profound satis-
faction that I note that, by the unanimous
vote of the Committee of the whole
House, the widow MALONE was re-
stored to her post of carter to the Cor-
poration, and that her identity" was
conclusively established on the evidence
of that true patriot, Mr. Alderman KELLY.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,
LUCIUs O'BRIEN (of Clare).
BUSINESS COMBINED WITH PLEASURE,
WHEN leisure irked, I once began
Collecting stamps to fill the void :
A hobby seemed the wisest plan,
As I was rich and unemployed.
My philatelic craze was strong,
But did not satisfy me long.
Accordingly, to have a change,
Old books and prints in turn I bought;
But these required too wide a range
Of knowledge—I was often “caught.”
When expert critics scorned my stuff,
I thought the game not good enough.
I find it, now, quite easy, though,
To make the test that fear enjoins,
For all my fortune’s “lost,” and so
I'm hard at work collecting coins.
No dark suspicion clouds my mind:
They are the useful, modern kind

AFTER HAVING BEEN SET For AN

UN DOUBTEDLY is.
The new Yellow River Bridge which,

scribed in these pages as the most
wonderful engineering feat in the world.

that on the Canadian Pacific Railway

OMNIBUS INTERLUDES.
III.-FANCY WoRK.
HE occupied the hindmost seat on the
off-side, and announced his presence by
prodding my shoulder five or six times
in rapid succession. I turned round
hastily, and beheld a grimy little man
with a grizzly beard, a short and very
foul clay pipe in his mouth, and a general
air of shabby unwholesomeness about
his person.
“You’ll 'scuse me,” he began, with
an apologetic smile.
“Not if you do that again,” I inter-
rupted savagely. “What do you want?”
“You’ll 'scuse me,” he repeated,
“but I seem ter fairly
sez ter myself, ‘’E's a gent, and I lay 'e

bein’so,' I sez, ‘'e can feel fer them as
'as left their terbacker at 'ome.’ A thing
like that might 'appen to anybody. It
might be you as left yer terbacker at
'ome, and 'ad ter borrow orf o' me.”
I admitted that such a contingency
was possible, if not probable.
“So give an' take, is what I always
sez,” continued he, “’Elp a lame dorg
over a stile, an' you'll never be sorry
fer it. All good pals pull together.
You unnerstan’ me?”
I was able to assure the grimy man
that I understood the general drift of
his conversation, and by way of proof
have been a question or a statement of
fact, I replied with a non-committal
grunt.
“Whassay?” queried the grimy man.
“What did you say?” I asked curtly.
“I said, “Whassay?’” responded my
neighbour.
“Yes, I know; but what did you say
before that ?”
My neighbour groped silently in the
thickening haze of his ideas.
“I said, ‘Bizness gerrin' berrer,'” he
replied at length.
“So I believe,” I said, but without
the assurance of absolute faith.
| “My trade mushabout samesbefore,”
volunteered my persecutor. “Speshul
smoke matches, some-
'ow. Yes,” continued
the grimy man, “there
ain't a single light
left in this 'ere box.
An' it was full this
mornin’. Rum, ain't
it?”
“Gin, Ishould have
thought,” I mur-
mured absently.
“'Ow much 2'' he
asked, taking the pipe
from his mouth.
“I beg your par-
don; I was thinking
aloud,” I explained.
“You want a light,
I suppose?”
“If you wouldn't
mind obligin’,” re-
plied the grimy man.
He took my prof-
fered box, and applied
a light to the charred
remains of a pipeful
of tobacco. Then,
puffing vigorously, he
made as if to return
my matches, but sud-
denly paused and ex-
amined the dead
ash in his pipe.
“It don't seem ter'. -
dror right, does it?” he complained,
looking dubiously at the almost empty
bowl.
There was another pause.
“Aren't you rather a long time
coming to the point?” I suggested
mildly.
The grimy man eyed me uneasily for
a moment, and then winked with an
elaborate show of friendliness.
“You’re a gent- one of the right sort,”
he observed ; “I could see that direckly
I set eyes on yer.”
As a tribute to the expressiveness of
my shoulders the statement was not a
little remarkable, and I murmured my
acknowledgments.
“Yes,” pursued the grimy man—“I

handed him my open tobacco-pouch
without further comment. He took a
liberal palmful from it, cleaned and
filled his pipe, carefully deposited the
surplus tobacco, together with half-a-
dozen matches, in his empty match-box,
and returned my property with thanks
that were almost Oriental in their
effusiveness.
By this time --we were about half-
way down the Fulham Road – my
neighbour had begun to show signs of
increasing embarrassment in his speech.
To my discomfiture, he now left his
place and seated himself beside me.
“Bizness gerrin' a bit berrer,” he
observed.
To this remark, which might equally
trade; always fluck-
flushuatin', though.
Sutthink crool!”
I murmured my
sympathies.
“Pr'aps you dunno
what my trade is ?”
he queried.
I could have made
a shrewd guess, but
preferred to plead
ignorance on the
subject.
“My line's fency
work,” he replied.
“Something to do
with palings?” I
hazarded.
“No, fency work,”
he insisted. “You
know what fency
work is, doncher ?”
A light dawned on
me. “Oh, fancy work.
Well, I can quite
believe it,” I said.
“Thassit ; fency
work – that's my
line,” he replied
thickly.
“And how long
have you been doing
. . . er, fancy work?”
I asked, preparing
to descend.
He was fast sinking into torpor.
“Since I was lil boy,” he mur-
mured.
“I can quite believe it,” I repeated,
with growing assurance.
The bus had now drawn up at South
Kensington Station.
“Good night,” I added, as I brushed
past him.
“Gooni,”
111all.
I looked up at him from the pave-
ment. He had already fallen into a
stolid slumber—had, in fact, passed out
of the realm of fancy or imagination (in
which his life's work apparently lay)
into that of dreams. The transition
responded the grimy
must always have been an easy one.

THE BEST ACTORS SERIES.
MR. ALEXANDER Swaii.ER.
(With apologies to a Contemporary.)
By a clemency and condescension too
kind to overestimate, one of our staff
has been privileged to enjoy an inter-
view with Mr. ALEXANDER Swallºr, the
great romantic actor, concerning whose
habits and dramatic methods the pathetic
British public never seems to tire.
Mr. Swalleſt is the soul of consci-
entiousness. Having decided on his
next play, he proceeds in due time to
learn his part.
ing it over and committing it to memory.
Having learned it, he begins to consider
This he does by read-graph-hunter than Mr. Swaliºn.
motoring and golf Swaller is addicted
to golf and motoring. In golf he drives
himself, but in motoring he has a
chauffeur.
Mr. Swaller has a capital library,
chiefly of sixpenny novels, in which he
is ever seeking for good dramatic motives.
He also reads DUMAs for the same pur-
pose. Always witty, one of his best
known mots is the profound truth,
“Every man has known one dramatic
moment; but how few can write a play!”
Of all London's actors it is doubtful
if anyone is more plagued by the auto-
ºvery
day he receives a number of photographs
and picture postcards to sign, confession
how he will act it: what gestures he albums from admirers who wish him
will employ, what facial expressions, and
so forth.
mind Swallºn hit upon the novel plan
of rehearsing them before a glass; for
his watchword is Innovation. When an
expression does not satisfy him, he tries
another. The next thing is the cos-
tume, and here Mr. Swallºn has recourse
to his costumier and his wig-maker.
The part is then ready, and I need
hardly say is a success.
In private life Mr. Swali.R.R is the soul
of cordiality, and it goes without saying
that there is no more popular figure on
the stage or off it. All men have
hobbies, and Swall.ER is no exception;
but here again he shows his forceful
originality, for where other men go in for
to write a few words therein and post
In order to get these to his them back to the owners, never thinking
of the trouble it gives. Mr. Swallen's
postage bill is said to mount up to many
shillings a week. Iłut this is one of
the penalties of popularity, and in com-
plying with so many requests Mr. Swall.ER
shows that he has the trait of good nature
very strongly developed. Not satisfied
with this, some even beard him in his
home. Then there is the amateur
playwriter to deal with ; and it may be
said that Mr. Swaller receives over
twenty plays a week to read. “If only
people would think before they begin
to write plays, how much easier it would
be for the actor-manager," he once said.
Some of those who have written plays
come to his house or the theatre, and
insist on reading their effusions to him.
As regards intrusions of this nature,
however, the high-water mark was
reached a short time ago when, on
arriving home from the theatre, after a
matinée, Mr. Swallºn found his drawing-
room full of ladies whom he had never
seen in his life before. “We admire
you so much,” they exclaimed when he
entered, “that we thought we must
come and have a chat with you.” Many
besides Mr. Asquith would have taken
umbrage thereat, but it is said that
Mr. Swallºr provided them with tea,
and did his best to entertain them. One
has to be a great romantic actor or hairy
musician to get this kind of homage.
It never happened to a stockbroker or
an editor.
In short, we have in Mr. ALEXANDER
Swaller the preur chevalier of the time,
or, at any rate, of the order, for we are
proposing to describe Mr. LEwis GEORGE
in our next number, and we shall want
to dip once again in the superlatives
reservoir then, and again the week after.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. Hanoid BINDLoss' latest hookſpublished by F. W. WHITE)
is called Beneath Her Station, but fºcainot think why. The
heroine, Millicent, is a “companion,” and she marries Derrick
Weland, who is a gin-trader in West Africa. Derrick, how-
ever, was a very fine fellow, and the owner of a wonderful
Ju-ju (Ju-ju is not the same as Ju-jitsu, though almost as
useful). He led the British troops against the rebellious
Kwaka, defeating him with heavy slaughter, nor ever a
question asked in the House of Commons. When you have
read the book you will refuse to admit that it was Millicent
who married beneath her station. Perhaps it was Addy.
Addy became the wife of Konnoto, who was a native king,
and probably a 'Varsity man. Addy's previous station had
been that of a milliner's assistant; and though of course it is
a beautiful calling, and though Society is Rotten, still Kommoto
was hardly beneath that station, though possibly beneath her
notice. However, we may let the thing pass, and proceed to
my second objection; which is that Mr. BINDLoss refers
frequently to a horrible West African insect, which burrows
into the sole of your foot, and stays there. It is called the
jigger—and I don't wonder. The point is that I don't go to
West Africa so long as the jigger is there, Empire or no
Empire; Mr. BINDLoss has spoilt the place for me. He has,
however, (otherwise) written a fascinating book about an
(otherwise) fascinating country.
The object of The Making of an Orator (METHUEN), as
described by its author, is to indicate in popular language
a course of practice in oratory based on his personal obser-
vation and experience in the House of Commons, at the Bar
and on the platform. Mr. O'CoNNoR Power treats his subject
with the authority of an expert. It is many years since he
quitted the Parliamentary scene. But there still linger at
Westminster recollections of his eloquent, picturesque,
occasionally almost turbulent speech. He has made profound
study of the masters of the art, and, writing nearly as well
as he speaks, presents a valuable treatise, illuminated
with examples of gems of oratory cut and polished, from the
times of CICERo and DEMOSTHENEs down to BURRE, CoBDEN,
BRIGHT, DISRAEL and GLADSTONE. One does not need intent
or ambition to practise the art of oratory in order to enjoy
this book.
In The Sin of George Warremer MARIE v.AN Vorst
Describes a few years in the life -
Of a man who, once patient and plodding, is force
To put on the pace by his wife.
She is beautiful, heartless, self-centred, and worse,
And, with never a touch of remorse,
She plays ducks and drakes with his honour and purse,
And there's more than a hint of divorce.
Catastrophe follows, disgrace in its train,
Then calm unexpected, but still
So achieved that the author convinces your brain
With her deſt psychological skill.
The book comes from HEINEMANN's house; it is bound
To be read (though its binding is blue);
The price is six shillings, and, take it all round,
It's a very good money's worth, too.
A Fair Insurgent (WARD, Lock) is a story of the Cretan
troubles of 1897, and I fancy that when Mr. GEORGE Horſox
set about writing it he made up his mind to produce a very
brilliant work indeed. I can picture him taking out the
note-book which accompanied him on his travels, and ticking
off phrases with a pencil. The result is that, in the early
pages, metaphors and similes come tumbling like rocket-
stars, and we get such sentences as this: “The waters of
the bay, that lay like a rolling plain of green meadow grass
and blood-red anemones in the dying sun, were shredded
into lily-white foam by the ship's iron ploughshare, and
hurled carelessly into the broad road that streamed out
behind.” Later on the air clears a little, and there is a
somewhat incoherent tale of adventure, with a good deal of
excellent local colour, a good deal of padding, some modern
Greek (translated in brackets), and a plentiful sprinkling of
atrocities, horrors, and love. In the end the other fellow
marries her, and one is rather glad to get the thing settled.
TRANSFORMATIONs.
[“Beautiful bright auburn transformation, cost £12; sell $2 (good
condition), or exchange farm produce.”–Adrt. in Ladies' Paper.]
I well remember how there dawned a day
When, with a candour that was simply horrid,
I, gazing in my mirror, heard it say
The locks were growing scanter on my forehead ;
I was, in short, appalled
To realise that I was growing bald.
Then, when my soul lay sick with sudden dread
And all my life was plunged in desolation,
When youth and beauty, hope itself had fled,
Thou didst appear, sweet auburn transformation,
And lo! my bosom warmed
And, like my face, my spirit was transformed.
Lightly upon my too Shakspearean brow
1 placed thee; lightly thou didst rest upon it,
And now I scanned my mirror closely, now
Withdrawn a little, artist-like to con it.
A dream I seemed to see,
And oh! I thought, the difference to me!
A radiance was about me. I had found
A trap to catch the sunbeams, and they danced there
So irresistibly that they were bound
(I felt) to ravish any one that glanced there.
Copper and gold and red
Flamed in a burnished halo round my head.
Then on my march of triumph forth I set,
And soon it came to pass, as I expected,
That, wander where my footsteps would, I met
A crowd of eligibles - all rejected -
Who heaved pathetic sighs
And gazed at thee with dumb, appealing eyes.
At first I revelled in my new-found strength,
And over broken hearts elate I strutted ;
But even broken hearts may pall at length.
I wearied of this homage. I was glutted
With conquest, and began
To loathe the vision of proposing man.
And now it bores me when I hear him rave
Of thy bright charms and suicidal bullets;
I sigh for something sensible; I crave
The simple life-peas, cauliflowers, and pullets;
My sated spirit begs
No longer hearts, but butter, cheese, and eggs.
Thus, O my transformation, we must part,
And thou shalt deck some PHYLLIDA or CHLOE,
And 'mid the hayfields ply thy deadly art
On youthful STREPHONs, for thou still art showy,
And, thanks to all my care,
Scarcely the very least the worse for wear.

“GOLFER8 A8 I 'AWE KNOWN.”
(By a Caddie.)
III.
TAKING it all in all, 'ENERY WILRs as
very little use fer wimmen. Excep, of
course, as playthings and rellaxashuns
after toil. As sich I regards HERVANGER-
LINE, of 'oom I've told yer. That is,
when 'er mood is dosile. At sich times,
when she is not trying to be yumourous
or utherwise acting the goat, the child
can listen, wif doo respekt, whilst 'im
she loves so well unbends 'isself. It is
'er privviledge, alone of all yuman
beings, to see 'ENERY WILKs remove is
stern cold marsk. Yuss, I tollerates
HERVANGERLINE, but I 'ave little use fer
uther wimmen.
Speaking quite frenkly, I can find
little to kommend in the hexeckertive of
these 'ere links, but there is one of their
resent hinnervashuns in pertickler that
fills me wif cold rage. This is the rule
permitting lidy members to play on the
course, excep' on Satterday and Sunday.
Lord knows as 'ow the men is bad
enuff to deal wif. 'Eadstrong, vain,
irriterble and pig-leaded they mostly is,
but oh! strike me pink and purple, if
they ain't fair angels, wings and all,
kompared to those dredfull, onreasoning-
able wimmen! Onreasoningable is the
one word as I can use to deskribe them.
And that don't do 'em justise.
Wif a man, to some eggstent, you do
know where you are. You do know
from eggsperiense 'ow fur you may go
wif 'im, before 'e katches you a clump
on the side of the 'ead. But wif
wimmen no eggsperiense will 'elp yer.
Becos there ain't no rules abart them.
Lord knows as 'ow I started out wif
the idear of pleesing 'em. I ses to
HERVANGERLINE, the evening I'eard abart
it, “We’re going to 'ave lidies on the
course, kid,” I ses. “Your 'ENERY will
'ave to smarten 'isself up a bit fer their
dear sakes,” I ses. Womanlike she
begun to snif.
“You take care, "ENERY WILKs,” she
ses worningly. “You take care of them
desining 'ussies. There's many of 'em
as will be after you, I knows it well.
Fer some wimmen,” she ses, sort of
sarkastic, “ some wimmen will go after
anythink in trarsers,” she ses. Well,
I wears nickers meself as a general rule,
but I knowed what she meant. And,
though of course I 'id it from her, per-
tending to be kontemptewous, I found
'er words quite pleesing. I thort to
meself, komplasent like, as 'ow some
of these lidy members might show a
preferrence fer that one of our caddies as
is pollished and korteous and older than
'is years. But, apparriently, both I and
HERVANGELINE was rong—iddeously rong.
Fer it's no good konseeling from
meself, at any rate, as 'ow I 'aven't been
a komplete success so fur wif our lidy
members. Why sich should be the case
I cannot tell, but there it is. There's
a preggerdise agin me as is kep' alive
by the ontining, revengfull tungs of
Miss TRIGSIE KoRNISH and Missis JossE-
PHUs 'AsKINs. And this is 'ow that
preggerdise begun.
They come along one morning and
say as 'ow they're going to play a rarnd,
and they'll share a caddy beween them.
And to my ondying greef they picked
on "ENERY WILKs. Not as there was
anythink surprising in their doing that.
In their place I'd 'ave picked on 'im
meself. And I’m bound in justise to
say as there was nothing in their ap-
peerance to set me agin them. Missis
"As KINS is very yung and plessant-
looking, although she is married, and
Miss KoRNISH is darkish and carries 'er-
self wif a sort of swing. No, their looks
was rite enuff; it was only their dredfull
'abit of cheating as made the trubble.
They started as frendly as love-birds,
but by the second 'ole the fur was be-
ginning to stand up stiff upon their
backs. It was their orful onguvernabul
keenness as did it. On the third green
Missis 'AsKINs asks Miss KoRNISH 'ow
many she's played, and she tells 'er,
nine, quite brisk like. Now both Missis
'AsKINs and meself knew quite well as
'ow Miss KoRNISH 'ad played ten; in-
deed, I could see as 'ow Missis 'AsKINS
thort it were eleven. They rangles a
bit abart it, growing gradewally more
'eated, and then Missis 'AsKINs erpeals
to me, and I gives it in 'er favour, trying
very 'ard to rap it up plessant like.
Miss KoRNISH glares at me like a cat
'oom you've mannidged to 'it wif a
brick whilst it's taking a stroll quite
inercent and leshurely; but she doesn't
say much and we goes on.
Two 'oles later it all 'appens agin,
only this time it's Missis 'Ask INs 'oo 'as
kondescended to redooce 'er score. They
rages rarnd upon the green, and then
Miss KoRNISH erpeals to me, and truth
kompels me to erward the 'ole to 'er.
This time it's Missis 'AsKINs 'oo glarnces
at me as though she'd like to cut orf my
yung life. But 'ENERY WILRs can stand
a lot of that. -
So we goes on agin, wif the air grow-
ing leavier like, and three 'oles later they
both erpeals to me, fer both is cheating.
It was an 'ard posishun fer a yung feller
as is only wishfull to pleese. 'Owever,
I desided to give pore old Truth another
chawnce ; although misdoubtfull. So I
ses to them quite respeckfull like, as 'ow
both their scores is inakkerite and should
I keep them both in fuchure? -
Oh Lumme, I'd like to forgit what
'appened then All in a moment those
two yung wimmen grew frendly agin to
each other and konsentrited all their
rage and spite on "ENERY WILKs. They
fell upon me wif their tungs, and I felt
as though I was being 'it wif barbed
wire and nettels. They called me
“impudent little boy,” me the chosin
'ero of the yunger caddies, and I could
only garsp and trimble. Their crewel
thretts brought tears even to my proud
eyes, and I almost beleeve as 'ow I
grovvelled before them. It 'urts me to
remember it.
When at last they 'ad tired themselves
out, they finished their rarnd as though
they 'ad never 'ad an unkind thort
towards each other, and I slunk belind
them, dased and silent, like a puppy 'oos
been kicked. -
And that's—that's what comes of
edmitting wimmen to a golf corse!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LECTURES ON CHILD TRAINING.
(Reported by Helen and Cecil.)
I.
MoTHER had a man two afternoons last
week to tell the mothers of all the kids
round how to train us.
Dad used his strongest word (the one
he gave me half-a-crown to promise
never to say) when he heard about it,
and he told Mother that the rod at home
and the cane at school had done all the
training he had ever wanted.
But Mother said she felt that she
would be neglecting her duty to the
whole of the rising generation in the
country if she drew her hand back from
the plough.
When Dad asked her what she meant
by the plough, Mother said she did not
of course mean a real plough, but only
that she had told Lady Montfort that
she thought the idea of the lectures was
charming, and that she would open her
drawing-room with pleasure. “Lady
MoNTFoRT says he is quite a Dear Man,
and that we shall all be sure to like
him,” Mother said.
So the Dear Man came and so did
heaps and heaps of ladies, and they ate
piles of afternoon tea. CECIL said that
was to show sympathy with childhood,
and to come down to the child's level.
He said that after we had heard the
lectures.
The worst of CECIL is that he is fright-
fully honourable. It is awful trying to
prove to him that the things we both
want to do are all right. And of course
we wanted to hear what the Dear Man
had to say, especially as he isn't a bit
rotten, and has the biggest nose and
the twinkliest eyes; besides, we heard
Mother telling Dad that the kectures
were entirely unsuited for children.
That was what made us think of the
conservatory, and the place behind the
fernery, where there used to be a foun-
tain, but the tap has gone wrong.
If you crouch down, the palms hide
you, and you can hear anyone talking
in the drawing-room.
CECIL argued for an hour about it,
but I never give in, and at last I thought
of telling him that Dad often said that
two were better than one, and that if
we knew how we were to be trained, we
could bend ourselves and help Mother
so much better. In our house Mother
does the training, and Dad makes
remarks.
Then I enticed CECIL by telling him
to take his note-book, and that Mother
would be delighted afterwards to find
that he had written it down, for she
had only been groaning just before
about how she forgot every lecture she
ever Went to.
So we went, and it was all rather
startling. I am going to underline
what CECIL put down. He writes rather
large, so he missed heaps, and I had to
listen to the in-between bits.
“Sit at the feet of the child. Place
the child in the midst " ''
Fancy, and they wouldn't even have
us in the room | I nudged CECIL and
was just going to say something when
he licked his pencil and told me not to
interrupt him.
“Curiosity—a precious giftſ Do not
smother it. Do not let it worry you.
The child is reaching out to know. The
child cannot help itself.”
There, again, of course we were right
to listen. CECIL looked up at me with
joy in his big eyes, and knew at last
that I was really right.
“There are two kinds of children—
Motors and Sensors. Motor children are
those who act first and think afterwards,
and Sensors are those who think first
and act afterwards—sometimes.”
We thought that was rather clever
of him. He had got CECIL and me as
good as a snapshot.
I adore playing motor-cars bouncing
down the rock path, but CECIL doesn't.
He says a real motor would never go
that way to the pond, but round by the
drive.
“The Motor child is covered with cuts
and lumps and bruises. The Sensor
child seldom falls.”
That was as right as CECIL's sums

me this morning in the bath — one a
lovely green and purple mark as big
as a pincushion. (CECIL says that's
no comparison, because a pincushion
might be any size—of course I meant
the one in my room.)
Certainly CECIL never gets a scratch.
Dad says CECIL will be a judge, and
that I shall be a circus girl.
“It is upon the Motor child that the
everlasting ‘Don’t falls.”
“CECIL,” I said, “ that man must be

boots.
“Do not crush the Motor child by
‘don'ting' him. The world is full of
don'ters'—that is what is the matter with
it. Rather feel that in your Motor child
you have a mighty force.”
I told this afterwards to Nurse while
she was doing my hair—of course with-
out telling her what had put the idea
into my head—and all she said was :
“Don’t twist about so, Miss HELEN ' "
Then I told GUEST, the gardener, and
he said, “Well, Miss, so long as you

“That precious gift, the imagination'

beautiful world of their own Do not
seek to drag them downwards to our poor
adult level !”
We wondered what an adult level
was. CECIL thought it might be the level
crossing down below the park that we
were not to be dragged down to-as if
we weren't always dying to run across
the line.
Then we heard Mother's voice.
“But suppose you had a boy and
girl who lived in such a ‘beautiful
world' of their own that they employed
themselves one early morning in digging
up earthworks on the lawn and insisting,
against all argument, that the Boers
were in the park, and that they were
defending the house ?”
CECIL and me looked at each other.
They had put us to bed at five
that day, and took away our pocket-
money for a fortnight to pay for the
gardener's time for putting the earth-
works back.
“Surely the precious gift of imagina-
tion which your children possess, Mrs.
Listen, is worth your beautiful lawn
ten times orer / And consider the eri-
dence of loyalty to yourselves, the instinct
of home defence—”
Wasn't he a Dear Man 2 I would like
to have rushed to kiss him.
“But one can't have one's lawns
digged up,” went on Mother, in a
mournful little voice she has sometimes.
“We should lose the gardener in a
week.”
“Perhaps it might have been better to
enter into the spirit of the occasion, and
tell them that you had authentic word
during the night that the Boers would
approach by the back of the house.”
“Then they would have digged up
the vegetable garden,” Mother said,
“and the under-gardeners would have
left in a body.”
We did not hear the end of that,
because the door opened and we knew
that the tea was coming, and Mother
had particularly mentioned that as] it
was holiday time we were to come in
and make ourselves useful.
So we scrambled up, and round by
the side door, and so properly into the
drawing-room.
The minute we appeared they all
stopped talking, and we knew why.
“Please don't mind us,” said CECIL,
very politely.
“My dear boy, where have you been 2''
laughed Mother.
And when we looked down, CECIL's
knees and my skirts were awful, with
crouching in the fernery.

CECIL, in his slow, clear voice. “HELEN

PUNCH, OR THE
MORE HARD CASES.
(With apologies to “Vanity Fair.”)
THE Duchess of K. is very fond of
practical horticulture. Mr. C., who is
near-sighted, meets her on the drive in
her gardening attire with a large basket
under one arm, and mistakes her for a
pot-hawker. He further gets the im-
pression that she is grieving over a curt
dismissal from the front-door, for the
Duchess, having got a piece of real
estate in her eye, is, unwisely enough,
applying friction. She contrives, how-
ever, to lunge out a greeting hand, into
which Mr. C., still ridden by his idea,
slips a consolatory penny, and passes
on. The Duke and his emotional bull-
terrier are watching from the terrace,
the attitude of each indicating strained
interest; and Mr. C., who has already
shaken hands with an under-gardener
in mistake for the son of the house, now
realising his second error, takes the
opportunity to perspire at every pore.
The Duke's epigrammatic daughter,
her satirical fiancé, and a week-end
party of friends, are seen approaching
from the tennis-court. What should
Mr. C. do?
Answers adjudged correct.
TACTICIAN : —Mr. C. must pass the
whole thing off as a joke. He must
wink at the Duke, and, when he gets
sufficiently near, dig him in the ribs.
Later he can say to the Duchess: “I
knew, of course, that it must be you;
a pedlar would have gone to the back.”
RESOURCE:--Mr. C. must feign a sun-
stroke, or give the idea that he is under
alcoholic influence. To heighten this
impression, he might career over the
Duchess's favourite flower-bed, follow-
ing immediately with an erratic charge
for the main exit. Should the dog be set
on, or take action on its own initiative,
Mr. C., while travelling, must decide
between the gate and the wall.
DiscRETION:-Mr. C. must pretend to
have lost something, and, looking
narrowly at the ground, retrace his steps
to the gate. Safely there, he can slip
away before an explanation is demanded.
Answers adjudged incorrect.
MoTHERLY :-He must keep out of a
draught. Anyone perspiring soon takes
cold, and, even with a strong constitu-
tion, it is madness to risk getting a chill.
CALEDONIAN:—Mr. C. has clearly given
the penny in a mistake, and, if he ex-
plains, ought to get it back without
recourse to litigation.
CHICANE –X. must politely draw his
partner's attention to the error, and, if
the trick is lost, get even with him after
the game. (CHICANE is replying to an
old problem; the last one contained no
allusion to golf whatever.—“Hard Case”

LITTLE BIOGRAPHIES;
Or, Who was Who?
IV.--John LoudoN McADAM. 1756–1836.
John LoudoN McADAM, the inventor
of macadamised roads, was born at Ayr
on September 21, 1756. A little book
was published a few years ago, entitled
The Open Road, which gives a pathetic
account of his early years. It tells how
he walked four miles to school every
day, and four miles back, with bare
feet, along a loose flinty road ; of the
pain this caused him, and of how, even
as a child, he vowed himself to the
great task of remaking all the roads,
not only of Scotland but of the whole
. United Kingdom.

in view, and how they bore fruit in after
years.
Having thus trained himself as far as
possible for the work which lay before
him, the young MCADAM judged it time
to set about getting some money. So

about stones and what could be done
with them from his early experiences.
He had thrown them at birds, he had
chipped and cut them in the mason's
yard, he had lived in glass houses.
And, as assistant to the dentist, he had
learnt the average capacity of the
human mouth. This last experience
bore directly on his great discovery.
McADAM had found out that if you broke
up the granite of which a road was to
be made into stones not larger than
would go conveniently into a man's mouth
they would bind together of them-
selves. It was a discovery that was
destined to revolutionise the road-making
of the world. He would have made
millions out of it if he had not also at
this time invented the phrase “arteries
of communication.”. It was thought
that a man who could talk in that way
would be too proud to accept money
for his services, and everything he did
now was done at his own expense.
He started in a small way on his own
estate. He brought several loads of
granite and broke it up with a hammer,
testing the size of each stone by putting
it into his mouth and taking it out
again. It was dry work, and it was
entirely owing to John LoudoN McADAM's
strength of mind that he did not at
this stage acquire the drink-habit. It
took him a year to make a piece of road
ten feet long, but he was proud of it
when it was finished, for he had tested
every stone of which it was composed,
and he now knew from practical experi-
ence exactly how a road ought to be
made. But he saw quite plainly, such
was his perspicacity of intellect, that if
he was to make headway in reconstruct-
ing the roads of Great Britain and
Ireland his present rate of progress was
too slow. So, after a month's holiday,
which he spent in a dentist's chair in
Glasgow, he set to work to gather
round him a body of roadmakers.
He chose men with strong arms and
average-sized mouths, and told them
exactly what he wanted done. They
were not to swallow the stones—that
must be clearly understood. And, if
any of them got a stone into his mouth
that would not come out again until
his teeth had been extracted, he was on
no account to put that stone on to the
road until it had been broken smaller.
Infraction of this rule would be punished
by instant dismissal. He trained these
men with the utmost care, and then
they made a road. It was a triumph.
People would come for miles to walk
on it and laugh at the roadmakers.
They said they had seldom seen working
men look so silly. It was the talk of
the country, and MCADAM's fame was
placed once for all on a sure basis.
He now began to be sought for all

A Puzzle for Patriots: How it comes that certain emotional Members of the British Parliament should be able, with apparent
equanimity, to overlook attacks on British subjects, and yet be wrought up to a passionate frenzy of indignation when the poor dear foreign
perpetrators (as above portrayed) are brought to book for their misdeeds.
House of Commons, Monday, July 2.
–Another dreary day in Committee on
Education Bill varied by final flare up
in Division Lobby. Government in a
tight place. Division of opinion on
Sixth Clause not only manifest in rank
and file of Party; is developed in
Cabinet. When Division took place
HENRY Fowler and BRYCE went into
Opposition Lobby, their votes annulling
those of PREMIER and MINISTER OF EDUCA-
TION.
In such critical circumstances, the
question at issue not being vital to Bill,
safe thing to do is to tell your men they
may vote as they please.
“A pretty disclosure of ordinary
course of business,” murmurs the

Parliament a body of free and inde-

question that presents itself an im-

LEADER OF THE OPPosition. Each has
Whips who, when Division is signalled,
stand at the gates of the Temple and
point towards the Lobby, into which
their men file like dumb driven cattle.
It is this state of things that makes
BANBURY so restive. Proffered a seat for
the City, he long hesitated to submit his
proud spirit to the familiar yoke. To-
night, Ministers themselves being at
sixes and sevens with respect to Clause 6,
we are graciously permitted to vote in
accordance with our convictions and the
dictates of conscience.”
Through the long afternoon the flow
of talk lapped sleepily against the walls
of the half-empty House. What was
the use of talking? Every man had
made up his mind which way he would
vote. Had Division taken place when
WALTERs sat down, having moved his
amendment, result would have been
precisely the same. But in the Com-
mons we do everything (or almost
everything) decently and in order.
Period of debate limited to half-past ten
o'clock, Punctually at that moment,
whosoever might chance to be on his
legs, whatsoever had been said or left
unsaid, Chairman would rise with cry
of “Order Order ' " forthwith put the
Question, and call a Division. So, whilst
Members who had prepared speeches
insisted on delivering them, the rest went
off to the sunlit terrace.
“Now do I realise the feelings of -

down in the Chair and repressing a
yawn.

obedience to long instinct, humbly follow
them into the Division Lobby ? On
ordinary occasions, Members, having
taken part in the final Division of a
sitting, hurry off to catch a cab, con-
tentedly waiting for the morning papers
to learn the exact figures. To-night
they trooped back in battalions, once
more filling the Chamber with bustling
| babbling crowd. As it grew it became
obvious that the Division had been a
close thing. On other nights the few
Opposition sheep are early penned,
whilst the Ministerialists continue to
pour a constant stream from the Divi-
sion Lobby. To-night the contending
hosts came in neck-and-neck, stepping
together like a pair of well-matched
carriage horses.
Up to the very last difficult to say
which Lobby was first cleared. When
the figures were reported to Clerk at
Table and WALTERs was observed to
place himself on the left of the line of
Tellers, it was known the amendment
was defeated. By how many ?
“Ayes to the right, 267,” cried the
Teller; “Noes to the left, 283.”
A great shout went up from the
Opposition. True, it was not even a moral
defeat of the Government. After care-
fully considering their hand Mr. BIRRELL
had been put up to say, “I leave it to
you, partner.” The Ministerial Whips
had taken no part in the Division. But
an important clause in the principal
Government measure submitted to un-
fettered judgment of House of 550
Members had been saved by a narrow
majority of 16. - -

ago he walked up to the Table to take
the oath on being returned Member for
Carlisle. He was here on Thursday.
On Sunday morning he died, and to-
morrow will be laid to rest in Cumber-

was opportunely fading.
OSBORNE never recovered from an acci-
dental, undesigned shot fired at him by
a long-suffering Member opposite. Had
intended to allude to his tormentor as
SouTH-EAST LANCAshire.
(Mr. Th-d-re T-yl-r)
“the chartered libertine of debate.”
By happy confusion of speech he called
him “the shattered libertine of debate.”
The House recognised the ruthless
accuracy of the description. BERNAL
Osborne, after long reign, fell into obscu-
rity, and WILFRID LAwsoN took his cap
and bells.
In congenial company LAWSON was even
better off the Parliamentary stage than
on it. In one case he flashed forth his
happy sayings. In the other he care-
fully fashioned them in his study,
brought them down written out in manu-
script, and without attempt to disguise
read them to an audience whose enjoy-
ment was, by rare exception, not marred
by the mechanical process.
I recall two instances that illustrate
his manner in varied circumstance.
ToM Collins, one of a Parliamentary
type long extinct, was as thrifty as he
was wealthy. Returned for Knares-
borough after long absence, he delayed
putting in an appearance at Westminster.
“Odd, isn't it,” someone said to Sir
WILFRID, “that ToM CoLLINs doesn't turn
Ul 2 x -
“Not at all, not at all,” was the swift
reply. “He is waiting for an excursion
train.”
The other flash of humour illuminated
the House. It was provoked in connection
with an old Member who, oddly enough
for those who sat with him in the Radical
camp thirty years ago, will presently
reappear on the Parliamentary scene
in the robes of a Peer. Mr. CourTNEY,
then Member for Liskeard, distinguished
himself by his opposition to the Trans-
vaal War that ended on Majuba Hill.
He was warmly backed by WILFRID
LAwson in his bitter attacks on GLAD-
ston E!'s Government. In its second year
he accepted office as Under Secretary for
the Home Department.
This was a great blow to LAwson's
faith in his fellow-man. He waited his
opportunity and scored, the point not
the less hurtful since it was that of the
rapier. Mr. GLADSTONE declining an
invitation to make a statement of the
views of the Government in respect to
the Transvaal, WILFRiD LAWSON inter-
posed with the suave remark–
“Perhaps the UNDER-SECRETARY of
STATE FOR THE Home DEPARTMENT will
undertake the duty.”

After breakfast went out shopping.
Great difficulty in finding chewing gum.

dress the exact copy of that worn by
Princess ENA at her recent marriage.
At 11.30 left our cards at Bucking-

then motored down to Henley, dropping
Miss SUTTON, who was looking more
radiant than ever, at Wimbledon. Just
in time for two heats of the Grand

Changed en route in the tonneau into
mediaeval costume. I went as Queen

and was therefore given this honour.
NICHOLAS acquitted himself in the cake-
walk with his customary dignity and

[July 11, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TIT-FOR-TATIANA.
I GATHER, from the highest third-hand
information, that the late Poushkin's
novel in verse, Eugène Oméghin, is a
work of psychologic subtlety. I am glad
to know this, as I should never have
guessed it from seeing Tch Aikowsky's
operatic version, than which I can
imagine nothing more naive. It goes
something like this:
Olga (Madame KIRKBY LUNN) and
Tatiana (Mlle. DESTINN) are sisters, who
sing duets. Olga, the elder, is very
dark and sufficiently mature to be
engaged to a certain Lensky (M.
ALTCHEVSKY). Tatiana, on the other
hand, has her golden hair still hanging
down her back. But if she is not engaged
to be married it is no fault of hers;
for not only does the synopsis admit that
she is “sentimental,” but we also see
her taking her earliest chance, and
falling in love at sight with Lensky's
friend, Oméghin, described as “a dis-
appointed man of the world.” (The part
of this well-preserved beau was played
with an admirable sense of deportment
and great lusciousness of voice by Signor
BATTISTINI, who, though he wore a
moustache, recalled by his debonair
appearance the prime of Mr. HENRY
Chaplin.) As Omégh in fails to make any
advances at their first meeting, Tatiana,
recognising with true operatic instinct
that time presses, resolves to accelerate
matters by declaring her passion in a
letter and appointing a rendezvous.
One can imagine the maiden hesitancy
which any nice-minded girl would bring
to the execution of so delicate a task;
and, indeed, it takes her the whole night
to compose the letter. Meanwhile the
orchestra plays the most fascinating
accompaniment to her moving pen.
(Thanks to the practice she has had in
Madama Butterfly, these all-night sit-
tings are becoming quite a habit with
Mlle. DESTINN.) Naturally Tatiana is
looking a bit below herself next day,
and, although she remains in excellent
voice, Oméghin, who keeps the appoint-
ment, tells her with appalling candour
that he does not share her infatuation.
A birthday dance is now given by
her Mamma (for after all a chorus
must be kept employed, and its pre-
vious appearance as Russian peasantry
had been far from picturesque), and
Omégh in avenges himself on his friend
Lensky for the boredom of the enter-
tainment (there I was with him) by
pursuing the engaged Olga with per-
sistent attentions. A duel is easily
arranged, a most delightful snow-scene
being selected for the terrain; and it was
soon clear that Lensky would be the
victim. For in the first place he was the
innocent man, and secondly he was kept
waiting an unconscionable time in the
cold without an overcoat. At last Oméghin
arrived, very comfortably and warmly
clad, and then I thought there must be
a misprint and that they were there to
fight a duet and not a duel at all. But
the song was soon over, and they took
up their positions with their backs to
one another, and the signal was given.
Neither of them moved. Indeed, I
cannot remember having ever assisted
at a duel in which the parties were so
long in getting off the mark. Finally
Oméghin woke up and shot his man
“A DisappointEd MAN of The World.”
Sig. Battistini . . . Eugène Oméghin.
dead. That was the end of Lensky;
and, except that he at once rose and
bowed to the audience, he took no
further part in the melodrama.
Years elapse and Tatiana marries a
Prince, and they give a ball in St.
Petersburg (for after all the chorus
must be kept employed, and a ball in
town is really quite a fresh idea after a
ball in a country house). Oméghin
does not recognise his hostess, for
Tatiana has grown a big girl by this,
and has her hair up.
It is now his turn to fall in love at
sight, and I am told that the original
novel is peculiarly subtle at this juncture.
In that case I cannot think that the
opera does it justice. If the change in |
Oméghin's attitude had been due to the
discovery that the lady was now married,
this might have raised a pretty but
rather familiar point in psychologics.
But he is at first ignorant of the fact
that she is married; so that his changed
appreciation of her must be due to the
improvement in her physical or social
attractions—neither of them a very subtle
reason. However, the reason doesn't
matter much, as it is now the gentleman's
turn to be rebuffed. But Tatiana has not
forgotten her first assignation, nor the
pains it cost her to compose it; and she
still has a soft place in her heart for the
object of that unfortunate tryst. Accord-
ingly she allows him to argue his case
at some length in her boudoir, even
joining him in a very eloquent duet.
Then she says “No” and goes right out
of the room before she can change her
mind. -
The synopsis says that Oneghin shoots
himself in despair. This is not true.
His brains were still intact when the
curtain fell, and I think that he got over ||
it all in rather less than a fortnight.
The opera, admirably performed,
abounds in delicious melody; but as a
play it is poor stuff. The novel of
motive is not readily adapted to the
ordinary stage, still less to the operatic.
For here, owing to the claims of music,
always leisurely in expressing itself, there
is even smaller scope for the revelation
of causes that lead to action; which
must without such revelation appear
crude and arbitrary.
And in any case Opera is perhaps a
sufficiently hybrid art without the further
introduction of a psychologic strain.
=
COVER-POINTS,
CRICKET is still the national game, in
spite of the efforts of the Americans to
supersede it. But “Wibbley-Wob”
has never really conquered the affections
of the British public. This is attri-
butable, I think, to the lack of a proper
“Wibbley-Wob” costume. Everybody
recognises that the magnetism of the
M.C.C. as a cricket club is almost
entirely due to the privilege its members
enjoy of wearing a chili and mustard
blazer with cap en suite. With an
equally tasty colour-scheme, I feel con-
fident that “King Wibbley-Wob” would
now rule supreme.
The great objection to cricket is, of
course, that it is such an unsportsman-
like game. For example, I once fielded
for many, many hours in a marrow-
warping sun, and was rewarded with
an innings of three balls only. The
first two were wides.

The umpiring of cricket, too, is
notoriously indifferent. A friend of
mine was caught, last week, on the
second bounce in the deep field and was
given “out " by the umpire, who
afterwards explained that he was
slightly deaf and under the impression
that the appeal was for “leg-before.”
Now this kind of thing should not be
allowed to occur, I think, and in point
of fact I remember a somewhat similar
incident on the ground of the Solomon
Islands C.C. being summarily dealt with.
The umpire was a missionary. Was.
propos, a brightening up of county
cricket also is sadly needed. Many
excellent proposals have been made in
the papers lately with this end in view,
and the best of them, to my mind, is
the abolition of the professional. But
the scheme hardly seems to go far
enough. Why not the amateur as well?
I assume, of course, that there are still
some amateur players in county cricket.
My own performance in that class of
match is limited to the game last year
between Quackmannanshire and the
touring Uganda team, where my scoring
at a critical time won the match for the
Scotch county. With only half-an-hour
left for play we were one-hundred-and-
thirty runs behind, and yet we won.
Truly the pen is mightier than the bat!
Apart from that occasion, I have not
been asked to participate in first-class
cricket, although I have some acquaint-
ance with the sporting editor of The
Daily Mail; but as a boy I once captained
a team of first-class ladies on board a
“P. and O.” liner. This match had a
tragic termination, as the young lady I
placed at cover-point-five yards away
from the wicket—did not pay sufficient
attention to the game. She was to have
been married immediately on arrival at
Adelaide the next day, but had to take
to novel-writing instead.
This mention of Australia recalls to
me an interesting match I witnessed in
the March of '04 at Gluepots (Gipps-
land) between the “Geelong Googlems”
|and the “Gluepots Blueguns.” The
|Gluepots ground is well known to be
somewhat muddy, especially after heavy
rains. There had been a few showers
before I arrived, and the pitch was a
little “tacky,” so that most of the men
were fielding in the deep, but the
bowler's head and arms were well above
the mud. This was because he was
standing on the umpire's shoulders.
The “G.G.'s" won, after an exciting
finish, by three lost balls, ninety-six to
seventy-eight, mainly owing to the superb
bowling of a promising young colt, who
managed to find a hard spot at the
pavilion end of the wicket.

I MAY as well say at once that, in reviewing, Mr. QUILLER

of Dr. CLIFFORD and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN) to speak of the author
as “Q.”—and this though I do not know him personally.
Very well then.
exhibits all sorts of odd things, some of them new, some
second-hand; but all worthy of consideration. There is an
absurd idea abroad that an author may not hold an opinion
on any subjects save literature.
that somebody had an adventurous
nose there was an outcry at his intru-
sion into politics. This attitude is
hard to understand. We know Mr.
MEREDITH and “Q.” to be clever,
thoughtful men, who write what they
have to write deliberately. We have
only The Daily Blank's word for it that
their anonymous leader-writers are
clever and thoughtful; and they cer-
tainly write in a hurry. Something of
this sort says “Q.” himself; and cer-
tainly what he has to say on politics
is worth listening to. On some other
occasions his window becomes too much
the pulpit or the master's desk; nor
does one ever feel sure that one sees the
real “Q.” He looks out from behind a
curtain, which is not playing fair. Mr.
E. F. BENSON's Book of Months remains
the ideal book of this class. From a
Cornish Window is published by ARRow-
sMITH, and in any case should be read
by all “book-lovers.”
MR. STORER CLoustoN is his own most
dangerous enemy. Some years ago he
wrote The Lunatic at Large. Now when
he produces Count Bunker (BLACKwood)
folk feebly say it isn't so good as his
first essay. Probably not. But it's
good enough to read and laugh over
every page. Like his magnum opus, the
story is based upon a series of elabo-
rately contrived misunderstandings. A
German attaché at the Court of St.
James, weary of conventionality, places
himself in the hands of that audacious
conspirator, Count Bunker. Under his
direction he goes to Scotland, assuming
the personality of a nobleman for pe-
Q.'s window, like the village shop window,
When Mr. MEREDITH said best to assist by publishing the book.

So with a view to keeping fresh the recollection of his achieve-
ment he has brought together into a book, under the title
Truth, Wit and Wisdom, his letters to the newspapers.
There are five hundred and twenty-five of them, and the
majority deal with monumental masonry. The result is, in
the author's modest words, “a mine of information,” and in
it there is one nugget at least which the reader cannot fail to
excavate. At the foot of every single one of the five hundred
and twenty-five epistles the writer's name and address appear
in full. He has, in fact, erected a monument more brazen
than brass, and if that doesn't keep his memory green
nothing will. Messrs. CHAPMAN AND HALL have done their
In The Balkan Trail (SMITH, ELDER)
Mr. FREDERICK MooRE modestly presents
himself without personal introduction.
The reader speedily learns that his
journey to the Balkans was undertaken
on the commission of a New York news-
paper. Its fruits are found in the record
of many incidents of Turkish rule inevi-
tably leading to chronic revolt. But Mr.
MooRE is not chiefly concerned with
politics. The American newspaper corre-
spondent is in marked degree the
sapeur of journalism. To him nothing is
sacred. Leaving high politics in the
main to look after themselves, he goes
among the people taking hasty snapshots
of their appearance and their character.
The book is more of the nature of the
libretto of a Comic Opera than a serious
contribution to political or geographical
knowledge. Many will be inclined to
regard this rather as a recommendation
than a detraction. To the brightly-
drawn word pictures that follow in rapid
succession Mr. MooRE adds some three-
score illustrations of street scenes taken
by the camera. These are most inte-
resting. --
Mr. GEORGE R. SIMs, however much
he may be occupied with the night side
of London and the revival of melodrama,
has not forgotten his youth; and there
are plenty of youthful high spirits in the
kind of little fable which he puts forth

impossible, but not therefore the less joyous.
Mr. ALGERNoN ASHTON, the well-known man of letters, has
done a great deal for the glory of departed great men by

and Mr. Punch, for one, assures him with all sincerity that

Or pluck delight from Southend shrimps and tea,
Flaunting beneath a so-called Panama
Beside the so-called sea.
There you will blow the expense and softly lie
In some hotel abutting on the brine,
And have your food (en pension) served you by

That you can buy the necessary slaves–
Tommies that undertake to man the coast,
And Tars to walk the waves.
Besides, the leisure hours in which you slack
Are owed to Sport— the Briton's primal law;
You have to watch a game of ball, or back
A horse you never saw.
Splendid, mon brare' you have a sporting nerve
Unknown to these dull churls of Teuton breed ;

His Fatherland at need.

Wants watching with a rifle, he'll be there;

You think you've done your share.
They've taught him how to march in fighting kit
And drill a likely hole in human butts;
You have no discipline and couldn't hit
A haystack, not for nuts.

To his protection when the bullets skirl, .
While your “fionsy”—well, I really feel
Quite sorry for the girl.

Though he may miss your British freedom's scope,
Yet knows the use of arms, where you would find
Your legs your only hope. -

And pray that, when his prentice task is done,
If you should cross him on a raiding beat,

“Within fourteen miles of a railway station - that superb

in sporting circles. 1,962 moths were secured in a single
carpet beat last season. The kitchen garden affords admir-
able facilities for the sport of slug-shooting. It was in the
grounds of this estate that Captain Longbowe (of the Royal
Marines) had his famous conflict with a ferocious slug, which
he detected in the act of carrying away the garden roller.
The fortunate renter of this estate will be able to reduce his
chemist's bill considerably, as leeches of the finest sucking

“Bluebag Hall–in the immediate vicinity of the pleasant

attractions to the spirited sportsman. The stock of midges
and gnats is absolutely unlimited, and the pleasant recreation
of mosquito netting may be enjoyed at any hour of the day
or night during the season. In addition there are on the
estate several hundred wasps' nests. The Bluebag wasps
provide the fastest runs across country of any wasps in the
United Kingdom. This is the only estate in England on
which the sport of hornet-hunting in chain armour can be
thoroughly enjoyed. The chain armour, diving dresses, and
other sporting costumes will be placed at the disposal of a
thoroughly reliable tenant.

THE ORDEAL OF CHOICE.
(A Golfing Soliloquy by a Junior Partner.)
Round comes July, and with it comes the need,
Ordained by custom, of my annual flitting-
My senior partner having so decreed–
But, e'er I start, it first of all is fitting
To settle whither I intend to speed;
And I have no compunction in admitting
That, each successive year, the task of choosing
Becomes more difficult and more confusing.
Golf summons me afield; yet who am I
To weigh the claims of Gullane v. Tantallon 2
To judge between Deal, Littlestone and Rye’
Portmarnock, Rosapenna and Port Salon 2
Fain would I see Strathpeffer ere I die,
And quaff its healing waters by the gallon;
Or view the lambent lights of the aurora
Amid the bunkers and the bents of Brora.
Some pens wax lyrical on Westward Ho!
Spite of its rushes loudly execrated.
St. Andrews is supreme; yet some I know
Pronounce it overrun and overrated.
Sandwich is sleepless in the dogstar's glow,
And by stockbrokers somewhat devastated.
Lahinch allures, albeit somewhat windy;
And there are varying views about Kilspindie.
Nor are my hours of slumber docked at night
By musing merely on the choice of scene.
The choice of ball, its “carry” and its flight,
Its subsequent behaviour on the green,
Claim anxious thought. Last week it was the “Kite ; ”
But now comes HoRACE–HUTCHINSON, I mean—-
And fills me, in the Friday W. G.,
With hopes of HASKELLs costing one-and-three!
Again, shall I adopt the discs of SCAIFE
Or stud my solid soles with nails of metal?
Alas! here too the cracks no clue vouchsafe
But differ each from each, like pot and kettle,
While I, in search of guidance, fret and chaſe
Beneath a load of problems none can settle.
I cannot even find which rule is CockFR's-
To golf in trousers or in knickerbockers!
When the acknowledged experts disagree–
TAYLOR with BRAID, and SANDY HERD with WARBON--
The indecision that bewilders me,
A foozling layman, surely merits pardon.
Were it not safer then to shun the sea
And drive a captive ball in my back garden,
Arranging with my housekeeper to say
To callers that I’ve gone to -Cruden Bay?
Stay, what is that I hear, what ancient lilt?
“The Campbells,” so the organ grinds, “are coming.”
Shall I then in these sultry chambers wilt
With Scotia's spell in all my pulses drumming?
I hail the omen. JENKINs, pack my kiltſ
Farewell to Fashion's thraldom soul-hemumbing!
The die is cast: my doubts instanter vanish;
I'm off to Campbeltown and Machrihanish.

CHARIVARIA.
AFTER all, the KAISER's grandson is to
be christened WILHELM, and not Edward.
The KAISER will stick at nothing to
gain the friendship of the United States.
He has now come to the rescue of the
Beef Trust. He has bought a steam-
yacht from Mr. ARMOUR for £15,000.
The Constitution of the Transvaal
will, it is said, comprise an Upper and
a Lower House: and it is stated that,
when the Government abolishes our
House of Lords, a scheme of State-aided
Emigration for its members will be
found to be ready.
To the great annoyance of our Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL, the American Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL is about to embark
upon a political career. Our Mr. WINSTON
CIICRChili, would like it to be known
that he is the original Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL, and that all others are cheap,
if not tinned, imitations.
Those who had been prophesying the
present Government's speedy death are
looking rather foolish to-day. Mr. T.
GIBSON Bowl.ES has announced his inten-
tion in future to support Sir HENRY
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN and the Liberal
party. The news has fallen like a bolt
from a pop-gun in the Conservative
camp.
The repatriation placards having
failed to arrest the attention of the South
African coolies, the Government are, we
hear, about to try the effect of more
attractive posters by Mr. John HAss ALL,
Mr. DUDLEY HARDy, and Mr. ToM BROWNE.
We hear that Mr. BYLEs is about to
ask that a day may be set apart for the
House of Commons to discuss the con-
duct of Sir Edw ARD GREY, who has been
showing marked pro-British tendencies.
We fear that the official history of the
struggle in South Africa contains a
record not only of the mistakes of that
contest, but also those of our next war.
Several members of the House of
Commons rifle team practised shooting
at Staines last week, but none of them
hit it. ---
The Admiralty has directed that
American tinned meat shall no longer
be a compulsory ration in the British
Navy. An appeal has now been received
from Chicago that the products in
question shall be retained as a punish-
ment in view of the impending abolition
of flogging.
We are not so sure that the
Colonel who objected to some volun-
teers wearing curls acted wisely. It is
just conceivable that it might put the
enemy off.
Mr. JABEz Wolff'E has beaten Captain
WEBB's record for the swim from Dover
to Ramsgate, doing it not only in a
shorter time but also to the accompani-
ment of bagpipes.
The announcement that one of our
leading railway companies is about to
make experiments in audible signalling
has caused grave discontent among
several persons who, in order to escape
from the noise of a motor-bus route,
have taken houses backing on a railway
line in the hope of enjoying comparative
quiet.
We understand that Miss Coſtelli's
new book to be published at the end
of this month, will bear on its cover the
following modest inscription :-
THE TREASURE OF HEAVEN.
MARIE ComELLI.
The suggestion has been made that
we should have a reserve of judges.
That is undoubtedly just what some of
our judges lack.
Great Britain, France, and Italy having
concluded an Abyssinian Agreement
inimical to the interests of Germany,
Italy has courteously laid a copy of the
Agreement upon the table of the German
Foreign Office.
Our plucky little allies are about to
start motor-omnibus services at Osaka
and Kobe. -
The Alpine Clubs of Italy and Switzer-
land propose to agitate for legislation
rendering it compulsory for those who
make difficult ascents to employ pro-
ſessional guides. The severest penalties
are to be imposed on those who lose
their lives owing to a neglect of this
precaution.
Both political parties in Kansas have
been asked to incorporate in their plat-
forms a plank demanding that shirts
shall be made an inch longer in order
to use up the surplus cotton crop, and it
is rumoured that those interested in the
cloth trade are about to demand that
trousers shall in future button round
the neck.

LECTURES ON CHILD TRAINING.
(Reported by Helen and Cecil.)
II.
WELL, we hid in the fernery, like we
did on Tuesday, to hear the second
lecture by Lady MonTFORT's Dear Man
on Child Training. CECIL to write the
bits down, and me to remember what
he missed. -
There were more ladies than ever, and
they buzzed and chattered louder and
louder, till there was suddenly a sort
of a swish—as if somebody out of The
Strand Magazine had jumped in amongst
them and shouted, “Hands up !”
(That is what CECII, whispered. I
shouldn't have thought of it myself.)
And then Dear Man began.
“Children hare their just rights –
rights, remember 1" -
“ Hullo ' " I murmured.
“Shut up !” said CECII, scribbling
and moving his lips in and out, as he
always does when he is keen.
“Firstly: The child has a right to
punishment—to learn that Acts bring
Consequences.”
Really, CECIL and me didn't think
much of that part of the lecture; but
CECIL thought he had better go on
reporting, so that we might explain to
Mother afterwards how silly it was.
Dear Man gassed a lot about how if
we over-eat we got pains, and if we sat
up late we were unbearable next day,
and if we didn't learn our lessons we
didn't know them, and if we climbed
trees we spoiled our clothes, and how
they must be sure that the punishment
was the natural consequence of the crime
committed. That last wasn't so bad,
for punishments are awfully monotonous
--CECIL and me had often thought how
much jollier it would be if they could
invent fresh ones. But all the same
CECIL wanted to run right in amongst
them and ask whether all of them stopped
doing things because they knew what
would happen.
Dad knows as well as well that eating
pork makes him unfit, but he will go
on because he likes the crackling. And
Mother—she knows that if she wears
openwork stockings the midges simply
torment her insteps. But she goes on
buying them and groaning.
“Nerer punish them when you are
angry.”
That, of course, was nonsense.
Why, Mother could hardly bring her-
self to punish us at all unless she were
vexed or “tried,” as she calls it. And
Dad — if he didn't punish that very
minute, he would laugh. I)ad gets
vexed as quick as boiling milk, and
down again the moment he is off the fire.
Fancyletting them keep back their punish-
ments like lemonade with the corks out!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Anyway, I generally get naughty in
a hurry, and it is much jollier to have
a good fizzy punishment in a hurry and
be done with it, so that you can get time
for something else.
Like when I cut off my curls and
threw them into the fire. Dad was
furious, quite as bad as when our new
groom let down the yellow mare--and
he was across the nursery in two strides.
He glared at me, and I glared at him.
“What did make you do it?” he
asked.
And I said: “I expect it was Satan–
or else—to hear them fizzle.”
And Dad shot down in the rocking-
chair, and creaked and creaked, looking
at me till I ran and hugged him.
“Never forget to punish them when
they hare broken a ...]."
That was, of course, another silly thing.
Why, that would take all the sport out of
life. It is just the off-chance that they
will forget to punish that makes doing
things so jolly!
“Don’t try to break a child's will. It
is his most precious possession.”
Dear Man was getting more sensible
again. They are trying to break REGGIE
McDoxALD's will next door. They keep
him in bed to do it. CECIL and me went
through the plum wall yesterday—that's
the quickest way to the Hall—and we
halloo'd at his window, and he got up
and danced to us in his pyjamas. It
was just before lunch. They were
trying to get him to put a book back on
the shelf.
“Don’t worry if your child says “I
won't' mour and then. He is only testing
his own personality. He will want it
all when he is grown up.”
We don't know Wit he meant by
that. But when CECIL and me say “I
won't " we are generally testing Dad
and Mother. We watch their eyes to
know how long it is safe to do it.
“But don't you believe in implicit
obedience of the child 2 ” That was
poor old REGGIE's mother who asked
that, and we listened to our very teeth.
“Not invariably ' " said Dear Man.
“You may infinitely handicap your
child in the Race of Life by demanding
it unreasonably!”
Was; t t he sweet?
“Betrare how you punish the Sensor
Child. You may, while trying to break
his will, break his heart. Rough punish-
ment does not hurt the Motor Child so
much. He fusses and yells and forgets.
The Sensor Child is silent and thinks.”
Perhaps they will start whipping me
now, as I am the Motor Child, and start
setting CECIL on a chair.
Dear Man does jolly well know the
difference between Motor-Me and Sensor-
CECIL.
They gave us dry bread for breakfast
only last week for messing before break-

fast and coming in late. We had only
been out with Bedlam —he's a lovely
dog we bought off a tramp for fivepence
—trying to find him a rat.
I was so mad I wouldn't eat a bite.
But CECIL just munched away and said,
“I prefer dry bread.”
He was jolly all the morning, but I
was fearfully hungry, and had to make
up with radishes. I washed them at
the rain-water butt.
“Children hare just Rights of Posses-
sion.”
This was awfully interesting. He
explained how they grumbled when we
didn't respect their rights and spoiled
their things; when all the time they
never thought of respecting ours. They
took away our broken toys, and told us
how we were to spend our very own
money, and altered our gardens, and
even sold our ponies or sent away our
dogs without so much as a “By your
leave '''
And then he finished up with a lot
about what he called Adultism. He
said that all the while he had been
talking he could see in the eyes of his
audience that they were consumed with
Adultism. We hadn't a notion what
he was driving at, till he came back to
what he had started with on the Tues-
day—“The Child in the Midst.”
He said they ruined everything, right
down to the very children's parties, in
which, instead of all the grown-up
people trying to become children for a
few hours, they tried to turn all the
genuine children into “horrible little
adults.” He said he was thankful that
there were still a few genuine children
left who would rather have a jolly good
game than grand frocks, and who liked
grown-up people who could “make
believe" better than those who stuck to
grim fact. Oh-and he said that even
the very Bible was ruined to the children
by Adultism. CECIL and me did want
to know what that word meant.

it, for we adore her Bible people. We
act them on Sunday afternoons when
everyone is asleep, and if only the
sermons were like Mother's stories we
shouldn't need to count all the wriggles
in the lead-work of our stained window
instead of listening.
“Let the stories in the Bible become
part of the children's cery being.”
So he said. But when that does
happen, the grown-ups don't understand.
Why, only the other afternoon on the
sand-hills, when the wind was blowing
tiresomely hard, CECIL cried out dis-
gustedly—
“I wish ABRAHAM's seed wouldn't
prick my legs so, and get into my hair!”
And there wasn't one of them that
understood what he meant except me.
THE BEACH DOG.
I MET him on the evening after my
arrival at Pebblehampton-on-Sea as
went down the steps to the beach. The
crowd of smart summer people on the
esplanade depressed me, for I had come
down by boat, and a sharp attack of sun-
burn on the nose made me temporarily
eager to avoid my kind. Therefore it
was with a thrill of gratitude that I met
his cordial and uncritical eye, and from
the rapid oscillation of his stumpy tail it
was obvious the pleasure was mutual.
He was a dog of curious breeding, a
cross between a Manchester terrier and
a collie; his teeth were noticeably blunt,
and the white hair on his chest and
flanks was stained a pale pink from
constant excavations in the sand. He
whimpered with ecstasy when I stooped
and patted his head, and when I threw
away the fag-end of my cigarette he
uttered a short sharp bark and plunged
after it into the waves. That bark was
the first of a long succession * which still
haunts my dreams, though I have shaken
the sand of Pebblehampton from my
feet for ever. A moment later I picked
up a piece of driftwood and threw it out
for him into the sea, little knowing that
by that innocent action I was to bring a
permanent blight upon my future. But
I anticipate.
For |. an hour he danced along
backwards before me, barking vocifer-
ously, with his eye on mine, and retriev-
ing sticks and stones from the waves
with rapturous energy. It was evident
that even then he had formed an undying
resolution never to leave me, for when,
tiring of the game and jarred by his
incessant bark, I flung a stone at his
head in a fit of petulant anger, he merely
* This would have been impossible at the
present day if the scene had been Hunstanton

conform to this rule.
caught it in his jaws with wonderful
precision and laid it tenderly at my feet.
Finally I left the beach and started a
tramp across country, and was soon
engrossed in a pleasant reverie. The
subject of my thoughts was a young
lady named LUCY, who had taken com-
plete possession of my heart since last
winter. I had followed her to Pebble-
hampton with a view to bringing matters
to a climax- the only drawbacks to the
situation being my nose and the expected
arrival of CHARLIE CHATTERIs, who was
also coming down to press his suit.
So engrossed was I in considering my
chances that the setting sun found me
some miles from home, and I was obliged
to train back from a wayside station in

of celebrated pill). “H1, 'ENRy, wouldN'T YER

order not to miss my table d'hôte. On
the platform I was recalled to earth by
a request on the part of the station-
master that I should take a dog ticket.
Following his glance I became aware of
the beach dog crouching at my feet,
panting with his hurried walk, but still
watching my every movement with an
alert eye. I have since thought that
the incredulity shown by the official
on my remarking that the dog was none
of mine was perhaps excusable, but
during the altercation that followed (he
also being a hasty man) I lost control
of my temper, particularly at the point
when, with a significant glance at my nose,
he alluded to the local lock-up as being
designed for the restraint of disorderly
persons. The crowd which gathered
round sided with the station-master,
and all agreed that I was a poor cur to
disown so evidently faithful a servant;
-
- -
but it was not until I noticed the
approach of a figure in pale blue closely
resembling LUCY that I hurriedly took a
dog ticket and dived into a smoking
compartment, rather than face the
critical glance of my lady. The brute
lay at my feet and took my vicious kicks
with such humble gratitude that I
ceased to take pleasure in them, even
when I discovered that the lady was not
LUCY, but a plainish person with a nose
as red as my own. However, I gave my
attendant the slip in the side streets of
Pebblehampton, and so entered my hotel
by the back door in a great hurry, much
to the surprise and suspicion of the
proprietress. -
Next morning I was overjoyed to find
my complexion had recovered its normal
hue, save for the addition of a becoming
tan—in fact, I may say the rosy tint had
transferred itself from my nose to my
prospects, and, light of heart, I set out
for a dip to brace myself to meet my fate
before the morning was out. As I ran
down the steps to the beach the sound
of a strangled bark let loose a flood of
memories, and there was the beach dog
at my side, a large stone wedged between
his sandy jaws, and the same look of
unswerving devotion in his loving eyes.
Throwing the stone to some distance, I
slipped into a machine and closed both
doors, and when I emerged into the
water I had the satisfaction of seeing
him ensconced, stone and all, on a clean
white shirt in the next machine, clearly
under the impression he was guarding
my belongings. It gave me even greater
satisfaction to see LUCY on the beach in
a charming frock, with a pleasant smile
on her pretty face, and when she waved
to me with her dainty walking-stick I
felt success was assured. Although
unable to swim in any depth of water, I
managed to give a fine exhibition of the
trudgeon stroke with one foot on the
bottom.
“Oh how beautifully you swim' "
said Lucy, when half-an-hour later Isank
down by her side.
“Oh, yes—I can swim a bit,” I replied
carelessly.
“But you seem so fearless,” she said,
on a note of admiration.
“Oh, well,” I said modestly, “of
course one gets accustomed to things.”
“I’m sure I never should,” she replied
with a shiver; “still I should despise a
man who couldn't swim—it's such a
brave and manly exercise.”
“Well,” I said, “I trust you’ll never
despise me for anything because you
know, dear----- Confound it!”
I broke off, half blinded by a shower
of sand flung into my face by the paws
of the beach dog in his endeavours
to unearth a stone for my immediate use.
With a muttered imprecation I sprang
to my feet and hurled my stick far out

to sea, determined to rid myself of his
pestilent attentions for a few necessary
moments. But no sooner had it left my
hand than I discovered it was Lucy's
walking-stick, a present she set great
store by, that I had flung into the waves
instead of my own. Lucy made the
discovery simultaneously, and turned to
me with a little cry of anguish.
“He'll bring it back!” I cried,
rushing to the brink; but in spite of
the fact that over-night he had retrieved
unerringly every odd stick I had thrown
for him, now he absolutely refused to go
further than the breaking waves.
“He’ll never get it!” cried Lucy,
with puckering chin; “it’s going further
away every minute. You go and get it
for me-do please-I can't lose it.”
I turned white to the lips, and mur-
mured, I know not what, about cramp
and a twisted shoulder. She turned
away in open contempt.
“Lucy,” I cried, “don’t be angry.
Let's go and buy another stick now.
I'll do anything else for you in the
world.”
“Oh, go away, you horrid little
brute!” ejaculated Lucy, as at that
moment, with one shake of his shaggy
coat, the beach dog saturated Lucy and
ruined her frock and my prospects.
I remembered to have smiled over an
identical ambiguity in the legend of a
picture in the current number of Punch,
but I did not smile now.
An hour later I was driving to the
station in a cab with my bag by my side.
The beach dog was before me in the
booking-office, but I was past caring,
and he lost me in the crowd as I went
across to the up-platform. A train from
town had just disgorged its passengers,
and as I glanced at them from the win-
dow of my carriage I saw a sight that com-
pensated for many things. Faultlessly
dressed in a neat travelling suit, stood
CHARLE CHATTERIs against his load of
luggage. The beach dog had taken up
his stand beside him, and was lifting his
appealing eyes to CHARLIE's face. My
train began to move away, but before
the intercepting arch blocked my view
I saw Charlie Chatteris stoop down and
| pat him affectionately, and I sank back
on the cushions with a sigh of bitter
satisfaction. -
He, too, would soon be a blighted man'

Thus I eked a bare survival

And observed the gates of Orcus
In the guise of kidney-beans.

To the microbe's last retreat,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from The DARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 9.-
Came upon SAMUEL Roberts just now in
remote corridor. Took no note as SARK
and I passed. Walked as a man in a
dream; glassy eyes fixed on nothing;
a strange pallor sicklied o'er his counten-
ance; lips moved as if he were rehears-
ing incantation.
One of our new Members, he had up
to to-day his fame to make. A Sheffield
blade, he has Howard VINCENT among
his colleagues. Whenever question is
raised of the relative strength of the
British Army and the safety of these
Islands from hoof of the invader, S. R.
instinctively turns to allow his eyes to
rest on the martial figure in laager behind
the Front Opposition Bench. Another
distinction is that he is the successor of
ASHMEAD BARTLETT in the affections of the
Eccleshall Division. Personally a man
of note in city and shire. Has been
Lord Mayor of one; is Deputy-Lieutenant
of the other.
This afternoon posed St. AugustiNE
with question on Education Bill. Had
given up days and nights to its composi-
tion. For a saint, BIRRELL displays a
certain mundane agility in evading
awkward questions. Now he had to
deal with a man from Sheffield. What
S. R. wanted to know was whether, on a
vacancy occurring in a teaching staff,
the Local Education Authority would be
permitted to ascertain that the candidate
engaged is able or willing to give the
“WALKED As A MAN IN A DREAM.”
“His lips moved as if he were rehearsing
incantation . . . Whether, that, ascertain, that,
affirmative, negative. Whereby, why not?... '"

“That'll fetch him,” SAMUEL smiled
to himself, resuming his seat after firing
off his shot.
“If,” St. AUGUSTINE replied, “the
word “whether’ be substituted for ‘that '
in the question, after the word ‘ascer-
tain,' the answer is in the affirmative.
If the word ‘that’ be retained, the
answer is in the negative.”
The House tittered. SAMUEL gasped.
As soon as Questions were over he
went forth to retired quarter where we
found him thinking the matter out. As
we passed he was heard to murmur,
“Whether, that, ascertain, that, affirma-
tive, negative. Whereby, why not? If
so, what odds? Can any man say other-
wise 2 No. A wast then '''
“Poor chap !” said the MEMBER For
SARK, “he's muddling up B1RRELL with
Bumsby. By the way I never saw it
noticed that DoN José in his famous
declaration, ‘What I have said, I have
said,' plagiarised from one of the cryptic
utterances of the Captain of the Cautious
Clara. Overhaul the wollum, and you'll
find it in the chapter describing the
visit to Bumsby of Sol Gills, Florence
Dombey, and Captain ('uttle. They were
greeted by the oracular remark, “My
name's Bunsby, and what I says I stands
to.”
Business done.--Clause 8 added to
Education Bill.
Thursday night.-Pretty to see what
wonders position on Treasury Bench
works for some newcomers. Time was
when HALDANE's uprising from middle
of second Bench behind ex-Ministers
was signal for general impulse to stroll
forth and see how the weather was
keeping up. Some men wake to find
themselves famous after speech delivered
over-night. Some steadily but slowly
work themselves into confidence and
esteem of House. Alas for those who
never do either but die with all their
music in them.
HALLANE belongs to second class.
Those who enjoy the privilege of per-
sonal acquaintance recognised from the
first his supreme capacity, were con-
vinced that his slow pace would over-
take and pass many nimbler runners
on the track. His shrewd knowledge,
clear insight, and judicial mind were a

potent influence in the inner counsels of
the Liberal Party long before they were
recognised in his ordered speeches.
That was due to style and manner.
He was so quiet and unemotional, so
level in his utterance, that casual hearers
were not sufficiently attracted to follow
him with the closeness necessary to
discover his real place as a debater.
The secret was out in the earliest
weeks of his sojourn at the War Office.
It required both courage and common
-sense for a Minister freshly come into
command in Pall Mall openly to declare
that he did not propose to direct fresh
departure until he had made himself
thoroughly acquainted with work of his
department and the condition of the
Army. Of course in an ordinary busi-
ness establishment there would be
nothing new in that. It would be
regarded as an ordinary commonplace
conclusion. But we manage things
differently in Pall Mall. Before they
had learnt their way about the tortuous
passages of the office, HALDANE's imme-
diate predecessors had each elaborated
a thorough reorganisation of the British
Army.
This afternoon, after six months' close

study and profound thought, the SECRE-
TARY of STATE FOR WAR discloses his
first move on the inevitable pathway of
reform. The difference between his
personal position and that occupied by
him up to the last day of the Balfourian
Parliament is strongly marked. Then
the half-empty benches, the withdrawal
of the searcher after amusement and
excitement, the remnant of an audience
fit though few, business men who
recognised one who knew what he was
talking about. To-day he rises to con-
front an audience crowded on every
bench. Two-score peers have managed
to squeeze into the double row of seats
assigned to them in the gallery over the
clock. Strangers of lower estate have
waited in long line, hoping to find a
place. A throng of Members stand
patient at the Bar. Others line the
side galleries. The Ladies' Gallery is
crammed. Its fair occupants have but
the remotest idea of what the speech
imports or whither it leads. But Mr.
HALDANE has become a Parliamentary
Institution. Like tea on the Terrace, he
is the fashion. So here, in anticipation
of his speech, is the House crowded,
throbbing with excitement, whilst he
modestly recognises the fact that he is
the same man whose voice, raised from
the opposite benches, was through many
years as that of one crying in the
wilderness.
Business done.-Mr. HALDANE makes
ºnt statement on War Office
1cy.
Friday night.--In one sole respect the
Chairman of the Kitchen Committee
resembles the burglar. His lot is not
a happy one. Only the other day he
had to face and explain the mystery of
the apparition from the House of Com-
mons larder of a tin bearing the trade-
mark of a famous Chicago meat-packing
firm, purporting to contain compressed
chicken. Enquiry resulted in complete
exoneration. It was made clear that the
can was not the rose, though it had
lived near it. The original contents
were long ago devoured by an anonymous
gourmet. A luxurious workman, anxious
to associate his humble midday fare with
the departed delicacy, brought his dinner
down in the can. JAMES ALFRED JAcoby
left the court without a stain on his
character.
A further question, relating to a per-
manent arrangement, is fraught with
more difficulty. Discovery has been
made, in the published reports of the
enquiry into the system of domestic
economy under the rule of the Poplar
Guardians, that the inmates of the work-
house have their five-o'clock tea made
from a herb whose quality is marked
by the fact that, bought wholesale, it
works out at 2s. 4d. a pound. Now it is
no secret that the Kitchen Committee do
not spend more than 1s. 6d. a pound on
tea supplied to noble lords, hon. and

right hon, gentlemen composing the
House of Commons.
Though absolutely unjust, it is not
altogether unnatural that the incident
has created a coolness between the House
and the esteemed Chairman of the Kitchen
Committee. It is obviously a matter of
fancy and prejudice. Before the Poplar
secret leaked out hon, members used to
smack their lips over their afternoon
tea, dispensing it with pardonable pride
to ladies visiting the Terrace. It was
no uncommon thing for the head of a
household, gathering his mate and her
brood round a table on the Terrace, to
regard her countenance as she poured
out the tea with mute but intelligible
enquiry, “Why don't you give us some-
thing like this at home?” Now the
bloom is brushed off the flower, the
scent has, so to speak, deserted the
Pekoe. Even SARK, whom everyone would
suppose to have a soul above these
matters, has had his mind embittered.
“When,” he said, “I read the daily
report of evidence given before the
Inspector of the Local Government
Board, I recall that extracted by the
Royal Commission investigating trans-
actions in Military Stores at the Cape.
I recognise the truth of that fine line
of the poet's, 'Poplar hath her victories
no less renowned than War.’”
Business done.-Eleven o'clock rule

MY TEAM.
I.-THE Choosing of The DAY.
I was a fool ever to have promised
to take an eleven down to Chartleigh ,
doubly a fool to have dragged HENRY
BARTON into it. HENRY is a first-class
cricketer, and it was my idea that he
should do all the batting for us, and
such of the bowling as the laws allowed.
I had also another idea, and this I
explained to HENRY.
“As you are aware,” I said, “the
ideal side contains five good bats, four
good bowlers, a wicket keeper, and HENRY
BARTON.”
“Quite so,” agreed HENRY.
“That is the principle on which one
selects an eleven. Now, I intend to
strike out a line of my own. My team
shall consist of three authors or jour-
nalists, two solicitors, four barristers, a
couple from the Stock Exchange, some
civil servants and an artist or two. How
many is that?”
“Nineteen.”
“Well, that's the idea, anyhow.”
“It's a rotten idea.”
“No, it's a splendid idea. I wonder
nobody has thought of it before. I send
a solicitor and a journalist in first. The
journalist uses the long handle, while
the solicitor plays for keeps.”

“The artist comes in last, and plays

HENRY, the man of leisure, thought a
moment.
“Yes, that's all very well for you
working men,” he said at last, “but
what do I go as ? Or am I one of the
barristers?”

The method of choosing my team
being settled, the next thing was the
day. “Any day in the first week in
July,” the Chartleigh captain had said.
Now at first sight there appear to be
seven days in the week, but it is not
really so. For instance, Saturday. Now
there's a good day ! What could one
object to in a Saturday ?
But do you imagine HENRY BARTON
would let it pass?

Saturday.”

“But I mean they'll have arranged to

else they'll be going away for week-

“One can spend a very pretty week-

“H'm, let me think. Any day in the
week, isn't it?”
“Except, apparently, Saturday,” I
said huſfily.
“Let's see, now, what days are
there 2''
I mentioned two or three of the better-
known ones.
“Yes. Of course, some of those are
impossible, though. We'd better go
through the week and see which is best.”
I don't know who BARTON is that he
should take it upon himself to make
invidious distinctions between the days
of the week.

That seemed to settle Sunday, so we
passed on to Monday.
“You won't get your stockbroker on

Gentleman on Stump. “You Totch ME, You BRUTE, AND I 'll kiLL You !”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF any one familiar with the personnel of English politics
looks to ('asar's Wife (METHUEN) for portraits or caricatures
of any of its leaders, he (or she) will be disappointed. I
never heard of Mr. MELTON's name in Parliamentary circles,
but he has evidently enjoyed opportunity of closely studying
them. His little touches of description of the House of
Commons in debate are admirably done. But he discreetly
refrains from temptation to use its prominent Members as lay
figures. Starting with the ambitious intent of writing
a political novel, he finds himself irresistibly led into the
commoner pathways of domestic tragedy. The Leader of the
Opposition, baffled in the political arena by the restless
independence of a nominal follower, makes discovery that
the rebel is in love with his wife, and she with him. The
story of their infatuation is boldly told. Evolved in several
dramatic scenes, it reaches its climax in a stroke of tragedy
that conveniently removes the husband and leaves the lovers
free. Apparently a first effort Caesar's Wife is a clever
performance, full of rich promise.
Latter-Day Sweethearts (UNWIN) gives
- Delirious Milº. how the Beau Monde lives—
A subject of which Mrs. BURTON HARRISON
Seems to have knowledge beyond comparison,
She catches you up, ...; lifts you clean
From all that is vulgar and cheap and mean,
To a glorious, opulent, glowing land
Where everything's gilt-edged, rich, and grand ;
Hardly a man you encounter there
Who isn't a peer or a millionaire,
And the circumambient atmosphere 's
Suited to millionaires and peers.
They always engage, these tip-top swells,
Palatial suites in crack hotels,
And travel in trains de lure, and trot
Round the seas in a sumptuous yacht,
Till those who aren't as rich as the Cz AR
Get happily wedded to those who are.
In fact, in this wonderful work we see
The Upper Ten as they ought to be;
And aspiring folk would do well to try
To model the scheme of their lives thereby.
There's a plot, of course, to support the bliss,
Which, put succinctly, amounts to this —
Heroine A rejects young B,
Who is promptly accepted by Heroine C,
Who loves Lord D, who, strange to say,
Is suspected of aiming at Heroine A,
Who loves young B all the time---- But there,
What matters the plot? It can't compare
In worth with the one main point, and that's
The mixture of peers and plutocrats.

well, too, mingling history and topography and local tradi.'
tions and personal impressions into an agreeable pot-pourri.
The only fault I have to find with the book is that it is too
heavy. It weighs a pound and a half. But it is a pound
and a half of the best Dorset, anyway.
The Butterflies of the British Isles, by Rich \RD South,
F.E.S. (WARNE & Co.), is advertised to go in the pocket.
The trouble, however, with the collector is that he has
already so many things which have to go in the pocket:
killing bottle, cork-lined collecting box, various parts of his
self-folding collapsible net, and so on. Of course it is possible
to do without some of these weapons. The butterfly, when
caught, may be pinched gently under the thorax, and put
inside the hat. Only somehow this doesn't seem to be
playing the game. Still, if there is a spare pocket, this book
should certainly go into it. It contains coloured plates of
every species front view, back view, and profile--all just
as good as they can be. I happened to turn to the Clouded
Yellow, and read : “If a female is captured in August it
would be a good plan to try to induce her to lay some eggs.”
I have often caught Female Clouded Yellows in August, but
whenever a question of eggs arose I found threats, prayers
and entreaties alike useless. Mr. SouTH, however, is as
helpful here as in all other difficulties. Every boy should
insist on having his book ; which (let me tell the parent in
confidence) costs only six shillings.
IN the old days a hero was a man, and a heroine a woman,
and that was the end of it. But we know better now, and
find heroes and heroines elsewhere, on four legs as well as
two. Mr. Thompson SETON, who is Naturalist to the Govern-
ment of Manitoba, as well as a lecturer and author, has written a
book about several of his acquaintances, called Animal Heroes
(CONSTABLE), wherein you may read of the great merits of a
certain slum cat, and a certain bull-terrier, and a pigeon,
and a lynx, and a reindeer, and two wolves, all of whom
touched nobility. The result is a book that no child should
be without. I give it as my opinion that as a writer about
animals

What yarns wherewith the papers, nothing loth,
13id the incredulous reader stand agape
At what thou art, and all that bad men can *
A sausage should be meat, but I have heard
That thou art meeter for the cemetery;
That in thy fashioning some things occurred
Whereof a résumé would leave thee very
Unappetising. What if it be so?
Age cannot alter thee, nor scandal stale
The public nose's well-accustomed sense,
Nor aught diminish the delightful tale
Of blended flavours which thine eaters know,
()r take from thine amazing succulence
Why range the spheres of speculative thought
To rehabilitate in halting rhyme
Aught of the cosmic processes that wrought
A resurrection instant and sublime”
Terchance thou wast a little curly dog
Ere thou becam'st a sausage; or a pair
Of mislaid leggings; or potato peels.
Perchance some citizen whose teeth, or hair,
Happened quite inadvertently to clog
The whirring sequence of relentless wheels.
Perhaps thou lately wast a foaming steed,
A blithe four-wheeler harnessed to thy flanks,
Whose toil-worn carcass, toughest of its breed,
The dogs'-meat-vendor had declined with thanks
Perhaps a Persian cat, for ever lost
Within some ham-and-beef shop's dark recess,
Thou from a chat became chare uterie.
But there —what skills it ruthlessly to guess,
lºbullient sausage, who or what thou wast:
Thou art my lunch, and that's enough for me !
Saucisse, polony, schnitzel, saveloy,
The hungry generations gulped thee down,
Nor cared what arts thy makers might employ
So thou wert plump and savoury and brown.
Pensive we thrust the fork into thy ribs,
And spread the mustard with artistic touch,
Then paused awhile, and walked serenely in.
And “Oh,” we cried, “sweet comforter of such
As suffer from a paucity of dibs,
Thou art ambrosia, all except the skin' "
A fig for these sensational reports,
Designed to lead thy worshippers away !
And yet—perhaps I’m feeling out of sorts,
But I've no appetite for thee to-day.
'Tis but the mind's impressionable eye,
The mental palate only that now fail
To judge thy proper qualities aright;
Respectfully I seize thee by the tail,
And, moving to the casement thoughtfully,
Give thee to blank oblivion and the night!
ALGOL.
WE frequently hear of a hungry man “walking into a
meal” (see above), but a writer in The C. T. C. Gazette has
hit upon a more picturesque way of putting it. “Between
Serravalle and Pistoja,” he says, “we halted beside a stream
and made tea, and rode into the latter at sunset.”
The word “Suffragettes” has met with a good deal of
criticism. Why not call them Insuffrabelles?
“A CHILD IN THESE MATTERS.”
MR. PUNCH confesses to have always had a soft place in his
heart for the children (being practically himself “a child in
these matters”) and he ventures to make an appeal to the
many among his readers who share this foible. It is on
behalf of a Fund which sends the children of the slums
into the green fields to have their little lungs filled with
Fresh Air. The modest sum of nine pence furnishes a day's
happiness (and many more days of happy anticipation and
memory) for one child ; and last year 180,000 were made
glad by country sights and sounds and scents. This year it
is hoped that the number will reach 200,000. Perhaps
Mr. Punch's readers will at least make up the difference. All
contributions should be sent (and they send twice who send
quickly, before the summer goes) to the Secretary of the
Fresh Air Fund, 17, Henrietta Street, W.C.

_PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
- -
THE LIGHTNING GUIDE TO LONDON;
OR, The Stranger's WADE MECUM.
TRIPs to Lovely London are now being
organised all over the U.S.A. Many
persons fail to extract the bes' of this
sojourn here through insufficient or
erroneous information being supplied to
them. Mr. Punch proposes to alter all
that by the following terse but illumina-
tive hints.
The ToweR.
Of old the quickest way to the Tower
was to offend HENRY the EIGHTH ; but
the Underground is now recommended.
In crossing Tower Hill be careful not to
lose your head. The principal attractions
of the Tower are the Crown Jewels,
which may or may not be paste, and the
Beef-eaters, who are fed on prime cuts
at ten, twelve, two and four every day.
THE MINT.
From the Tower it is an easy walk to
the Mint, which has been placed close
by in the interests of the Beef-eaters,
whose efforts constantly bring on an
indigestion that only crème de menthe
can mitigate.
The BANK of ExcLAND.
Few places of resort would better
repay the acquisitive tourist than this,
but visitors are not encouraged, and the
rules as to keeping off the grass are very
stringent.
ST. PAUL’s.
No visit to London is complete unless
one has conſided a secret to the Whisper-
ing Gallery of St. Paul's. To return to
Wisconsin without such an achievement
to boast of is to court disaster as a
European traveller. St. Paul's is Lon-
don's largest temple and the biggest
Wren's nest ever built. The Christian
law is upheld in the nave, but the
inside of the dome is strictly Mosaic.
The TUBEs.
A modest twopence entitles one to the
freedom of these curious subterraneous
passages—the Catacombs of London.
One must be very careful how one
walks, as electric trains run almost
continuously, and the space between the
train and the wall is inconsiderable.
Only very diligent search will yield the
skeletons and desiccated bodies of monks
which no doubt are stored here.
The GRIFFIN.
This noble if obsolete fowl, who is
actually a dragon and not a griffin at all,
marks the site of Temple Bar, a famous
drinking salcon for barristers which was
removed some twenty years ago after a
wave of teetotalism passing over the legal
profession rendered it useless.
CHARING Cross STATION.
One of the finest of the S. E. & C. R.
London termini. On this platform the
ends of the earth are said to meet,
and a number of trains start from it
every day and are never heard of again.
Weary of waiting for the arrival of one
of the faster expresses, the roof lately
fell down ; but it is now being repaired.
TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
Trafalgar Square is free on Mondays,
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays,
Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. On
other days there is a small clarge. The
air here is very good. The lions are fed
once a day on railway refreshment buns
made of the same material. There is no
law against visitors climbing the Nelson
Column, but it is not usually done.
The NATIONAL GALLERY.
This is London's finest collection of
Old Masters. The peculiarity of the
Exhibition is that every picture was
painted by hand, and none is for sale.
Officers are stationed at the gates
especially to prevent visitors from carry-
ing away the pictures – even the little
ones. The most valuable of the recent
acquisitions is the famous undraped
Suffragette, known as “Venus and
Cupid,” by VELAsqtiſh.
NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB.
No one should miss this Club, and it
is quite unnecessary to be a member.
You go right in, shouting “C.-B. for
ever !” and the marble halls are your
own. So many National Liberals were
never before gathered together as in this
palace of political righteousness. It will
be useless to try to take away the nail
scissors, as they are chained to the wall.
NEw Scoti \ND YARD.
It is well ever to keep as far from this
building as possible; unless by chance
one is a murderer, in which case one
could not do better than take lodgings
next door or even join the Force.
The THAMEs. -
London is situated on this river, but
one may easily not notice the circum-
stance. The Thames is celebrated also
for its extraordinary number of empty
passenger steamcrs which ply for hire
all day long, and, although large bonuses
are offered, have never yet induced a
passenger to board them. There is no
charge for looking at the river or cross-
ing it on a bridge.
Houses oF PARLIAMENT.
The home of the English WINSTON
CHURCHILL, who shares this noble build-
ing with Mr. BYLEs. A handsome,
rambling residence, much used to
advertise whisky.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY.
Great men lie here also--but in
another way. Visitors desirous to see
this historic pile (as it has been tersely
called) should make haste, for the vibra-
tion caused by motor buses is said to be
hastening its end. -
MADAME TUss AUD's. *
London's principal gallery of wax-
works, or the Modellers' Who's Who.
Our only man of eminence never yet
reproduced in wax is Mr. Lot Is WAIN–
for obvious reasons. Many murders are
committed solely from a desire: to be
added to the Marylebone load Vallalla;
while men have become Cabinet Ministers
on no other grounds.
Having given a liberal five minutes to
each of the places named and described
above, the traveller from Higgsville, Pa.,
or Syracuse, Wis., can return by the next
boat, fully satisfied with his knowledge
of London.
THE END OF THE SEASON.
DEAREST DAPHNE,- Everyone says the
Season has been “dull" and a “failure,”
yet everyone professes to have had
individually “a ripping time,”- so it
must lave been the others who were
stupid. A good many hostestes, who
think they have made their mark, will
find that the impartial eye of history
judges otherwise. NonTY and I are
quite agreed that the only hostess in
London this summer who has offered
us anything of a novelty las been Lady
CLARGEs with her Jiu-Jitsu balloon
parties.
Myself, I nearly had my Season
spoiled by Aunt GoLDINGHAM coming
out of her retirement and quartering
herself on us while she looked for a
town-house. She did her level to make
herself a first-class nuisance; but as
she's a widow without encumbrance
and simply rolling, of course we have to
be civil to her. NonTY and BABs have
been very good in taking her off our
hands a bit. At first she was inclined
to be boresome and preachy, but, after
making her own observations on some
choice specimens of our juvenile-antiques
she took on a sort of ponderous skittish-
ness, and was duly grateful to me
(showing it in a very decent way, I own)
for helping her to put back the clock
by taking her to the right placcs for
her frocks and togues and (tell it not in
Gath, my dear!) her transformations.
She now wishes to be styled “GEORGIE,
Lady Gol LINGHAM,” and doesn't remem-
ber anything more than fifteen years
ago. When she first came to us she
had a memory as long as a court-train,
and remembered things way back in
the seventies. Curious effect of London
air, isn't it 2 No wonder Londoners
are so given to losing their memories
altogether, and themselves too!
One of the brightest spots in the
Season has been having Norty for a pal.

\UNC\,
OR THE LONDON
Boy (reassuringly). “It's All Right, Miss.
I'M ONLY Looking Fon
F- \eºve taſ,
OUR CRICKET-BALL | "
-
We have met constantly, and have had not to say suburban, as to fall in love,
simply splendid talks about “Men and
Things,” as he puts it, though I own I
don't think it's a particularly nice way
of referring to us. He is by way of
being quite a philosopher, you know,
and his philosophy is that “Life is a
rotten business, and nothing matters
much.” Together we have looked at
the people who form our world by
“dry-light” (that's another of his clever
phrases) and have sized them up with
all their littlenesses and absurdities.
I don't mean that we think we're better
than they are, but, well, you see, we're
philosophers, and look at things accord-
ingly. I lent Norty my notes on the
PLATo lectures last spring, and we
thoroughly discussed the Platonic philo-
sophy. He says my views have plenty
of insight, but that, like all women's
views, they lack grasp. I don't mind
about that. I would never wish to be
thought grasping.
Norty is a dear boy, and, though it
was quite understood between us from
the first that we could neither of us
afford to be romantic and, of course,
we would not do anything so provincial,
yet I do hope he won't be miserable
when he hears something. For, DAPHNE,
I have said “Yes.” Now, my dear, please
don't prepare to kiss me and cry over
me and be Early Victorian. It's not that
sort of “Yes,” but a prudent, common-
sense one. He proposed the other night
at one of Mrs. Ji MMY SHARPE's “spur-of-
the-moment” parties (she sends out the
invitations, post-cards, with “Come and
have some fun" on them, the same day).
“The Powers that be " would never
have forgiven me, nor would I ever have
forgiven myself, had I refused Josi Ah
MritiMILL, for he is rich “beyond the
dreams,” and might have had any girl
for the asking (the Duchess of DUNSTABLE
made a dead set at him for WINNIE or
Crckoo). Then you know, dearest, I
must think of my family. My fourth
season is just over, JoAN has been out
more than a year, and Hill'EGARDE is
clamouring to leave the schoolroom and
let loose her attractions on Society, and,
in short, London expects every girl to
do her duty, just as England expects
every man to do his.
I believe I said some horrid things
about Josi AH Mt Iti Mii I, in one of my
letters. You can forget those now, my
dear, if you like, or, if you don't like,
you needn't, it's all one to your BLANCHE.
I own I'm a bit worried about Norty.
Will he be bitter and angry 2 I wonder.
Being philosophers, we have quite settled
such matters together in theory, but,
when it comes to practice, men are not
quite so sensible or consistent as we are.
Jusqu'à tantôt, m'amie,
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
P.S.–I needn't have worried about
how Norty would take the news of my
engagement. It seems he has been en
gaged a week to Aunt Goldingham ' ' |
won't say I'm surprised. After four
Seasons, to be surprised is a Lost Art.
But one can still be deeply disgusted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BY-LAWS FOR BALLOONISTS.
IN view of the fact that air-travel is
becoming increasingly popular and
that ballooning “week-ends” and the
aeronautic rest-cure are now in favour,
it is imperative that speedy measures
should be taken to reinforce the powers
of the police and safeguard that portion
of the public who are henceforth to be
known as literally the “lower classes.”
The following regulations are therefore
under consideration :-
1. The term “airship " shall include
every balloon, aerostat, aeroplane, kite,
parachute, projectile, gas-bag. spring-
heel boots, or any other device what-
soever at any stage disconnected with
terra firma, whereby one or more
human beings may be transported,
propelled or dropped from point to
point through the atmosphere. The
ordinary steam round-about, the Maxim
Flying-machine at Earl's Court, diving-
boards, boat-swings, lifts, elevators and
gallows of all kinds shall not therefore
come under the designation “airship.”
2. Persons shall be considered as
“aeronauts" who, whether tired of life,
anxious of being ranked among the
“Upper Ten" and entered in BURRE's
Balloonage, nervous of motor-buses, fond
of tete-à-têtes with variety actresses, or
from any other motive, shall, intention-
ally or unintentionally, travel by an
airship.
3. In order that the immemorial
rights of property may be respected, it
shall be deemed a trespass for any
aeronaut to sail within a perpendicular
mile of any inclosure, unless by per-
mission of the owner of the territorial
surface. Any such proprietor wishing
to reserve the entire usufruct of the air-
block above his land to a height not
exceeding five miles, must exhibit as a
notice the words “Ancient Lights” in
horizontal lettering, legible at that
distance without the aid of a telescope.
4. Ordinary aeronauts shall confine
themselves to the volumes of atmosphere
vertically above the recognised land-
thoroughfares, and shall take short cuts
at their peril.
5. Airships going down wind shall
give way to those beating up, and if
there be not room to pass on the level,
shall sail either above or below the latter
vessels. When the wind is abeam, the
usual nautical rule of the road is to be
observed.
6. It shall be accounted a misdemean-
our to drop hand-bills, waste paper, soiled
linen, bottles, ballast, or any articles
whatever on to private property from
airships passing overhead. All such
refuse must be collected by the local
dust-balloons.
7. “Week-end " parties, beam feasters,
cheap-trippers, and other aeronauts who
may be guilty of reckless steering,
furious driving, or generally riotous
behaviour in aerial transit shall have
their licences endorsed.
8. It shall be forbidden to take snap-
shots or other photographic bird's-eye
views of back-gardens and private
premises, to trail ropes indiscriminately
over house-tops, to collide against factory
chimneys, to come to anchor except in
duly authorised trees, or to take other
liberties with terrestrial objects.
9. Every aeronaut transgressing the
above regulations shall come to ground
after being challenged by a police-boat.
If the offender refuse to take notice of
such challenge, a shot shall be first fired
across his bows, and, failing surrender,
his vessel shall then be punctured.
10. The existing number of coroners
shall be increased by one for each
parish. Zig-ZAG.
CHARIVARIA.
THE annual manoeuvres in actual war
conditions have recently been taking
place in Central America.
It would seem to be impossible to
please everybody. Das Deutsche Volks-
blatt, the organ of the Vienna Christian
Socialist Clerical Anti-Semites, is annoyed
that DREYFUs should have been acquitted.
Meanwhile General MERCIER, whose
virulent attacks on us during the Boer
War will be remembered, has given
further proof of the genuineness of his
opinions of our country. Realising the
requirements of poetic justice he has
banished himself to what he considers
a Devil's Isle.
An ingenious attempt has been made
to foster anti-Semitism in South Africa.
A contemporary declares that it will be
found that any barbarities which have
taken place in Natal are the work of
Native Levis. -
Those who love picturesque old cus-
toms were delighted at the recent revival
in the French Chamber of Deputies of
Nose-pulling and Face-slapping, practices
which had shown signs of falling into
desuetude.
A speaker at a meeting of a Peace
Association implored mothers not to give
their children tin soldiers or air-guns.
To take the place of these toys the
Society of the Friends of the Enemies
of Great Britain is, we hear, preparing
to place on the market at a popular
price a large consignment of little
banners, no longer saleable abroad,
bearing the inscription A bas les
Anglais !
In spite of statements to the contrary,
we understand that Mr. ASQUITH is by
no means in favour of the reduction of
the Army proposed by Mr. HALDANE.
Mr. Asquith thinks that the growing
power of the Suffragettes has been lost
sight of. --
It is rumoured that the London
County Council intends, as soon as it has
control of the London Volunteers under
Mr. HALDANE's scheme, to convert their
steam-boats into ironclads.
“Our object,” said Mr. HALDANE, “has
been to produce a force which could
contract or expand according to policy.”
Our South African army, it will be re-
membered, failed badly in contracting.
“Mr. LE GALLIENNE, I am informed,”
says Mr. SHORTER in The Sphere, “ has
become naturalised as an American
citizen, a thing that is very rarely done
by either Englishmen in America or
by Americans in England.” This
statement confirms the rumour that
Mr. SHORTER has Irish relations by
marriage. ---
More sensational Cricket ! Our ex-
tract is from The Liverpool Echo :–
“ Runs were coming briskly at first
consequent on GRAHAM driving MAY
finely for a couple and getting him to
leg for 30.” This is leg-pulling with a
vengeance. -- - -
The cow which swallowed a cricket
ball at King's Sutton has died—after
cautioning her companions against the
dangers of eating tinned apples.
busily engaged in collecting coppers,
but it is prophesied that very soon the
coppers will be busily engaged in col-
lecting the Plaistow land-grabbers.
The Army Council directs the atten-
tion of responsible officers to the practice,
frequent among soldiers, of wearing caps
of obsolete patterns when walking out.
The men should take a lesson from the
members of the other sex, who invariably
wear the latest fashion no matter how
ugly it may be.
The Poplar rate-payers, it has been
announced, must pay for the cost of the
Poplar inquiry. The L.C.C., it will be
remembered, also expend large sums in
providing amusement for the people.
An immense impetus has been given
to the teaching of singing in the United
States by a report that a lady who was
knocked down by a lion in the Rocky
Mountains rendered the beast helpless
by singing to him.

MY TEAM.
II.--THE SELECTION CoMMITTEE.
THE Committee consisted of HENRY
and myself. Originally it was myself
alone, but as soon as I had selected
HENRY I proceeded to co-opt him, reserv-
ing to myself, however, the right of a
casting vote in case of any difference of
opinion. One arose, almost immediately,
over HiggiNs. HENRY said :
(a) That HIGGINs had once made 97.
(b) That he had been asked to play
for his county.
(c) That he was an artist, and we
had arranged to have an artist in the
team.
In reply I pointed out:
(a) That 97 was an extremely un-
likely number for anyone to have made.
(b) That if he had been asked he
evidently hadn't accepted, which showed
the sort of man he was ; besides which,
what was his county 2
(c) That, assuming for the moment he
had made 97, was it likely he would
consent to go in last and play for a draw,
which was why we wanted the artist 2
And that, anyhow, he was a jolly bad
artist.
(d) That hadn't we better put it to
the vote?
This was accordingly done, and an
exciting division ended in a tie.
Those in favour of HiggiNs ... I
Those against HIGGINs ......... l
The Speaker gave his casting vote
against HiggiNS.
Prior to this, however, I had laid before
the House the letter of invitation. It
was as follows (and, I flatter myself,
combined tact with a certain dignity):--
“DEAR ––, I am taking a team into
the country to play against the village
eleven. The ground and the lunch are
good. Do you think you could manage
to come down 2 I know you are very
busy just now with
Contangers,
Briefs,
Clients,
Your Christmas number,
etc., etc.,
but a day in the country would do you
good. I hear from JACK (or from all
siles') that you are in great form this
season. I will give you all particulars
about trains later on. Good-bye. Re-
member me to --—. How is – ?
“Ever yours.
“P.S.--Old HENRY is playing for us.
IIc lias strained himself a little and
Irobably won't bowl much, so I expect

keen on meeting you. Apparently he

“P.P.S.—We might manage to have
some Bridge in the train.”
“That,” I said to HENRY, “is what I
call a clever letter.”
“What makes you think that?”
“It is all clever,” I said modestly ;
“but the cleverest part is a sentence at
the end. ‘I will give you all particulars
about trains later on.' You see I have
been looking them up, and we leave
Victoria at 7.30 A.M. and get back to
London Bridge at 11.45 P.M.”
The answers began to come in the
next day. One of the first was from
Boltox, the solicitor, and it upset us
altogether. For, after accepting the
invitation, he went on : “I am afraid I
don't play Bridge. As you may re-
member, I used to play chess at
Cambridge, and I still keep it up.”
“Chess,” said HENRY. “That's where
White plays and mates in two moves.
And there's a Black too. He does some-
thing.”
“We shall have to get a Black. This
is awful.” -
“Couldn't Bolton do problems by
himself all the time?”
“That would be rather bad luck on
him. No, look here. Here's CAREY.
Glad to come, but doesn't Bridge. He 's

Accordingly we wired to CAREY: “Do

answered, “No. Why?”
“CAREY will have to play that game

“Be brief,” he said, “I’m frightfully

“There you are. And I'll do any-

I went back to HENRY, and told him
the good news.
“I wonder if he'll mind being Black,”
said HENRY. “That's the chap that
always gets mated so quickly.”
“I expect they'll arrange it among
themselves. Anyhow, we've done our
best for them.”
“It's an awful business getting up a
team,” said HENRY thoughtfully. “Well,
we shall have two decent sets of Bridge,
anyway. But you ought to have arranged
for twelve aside, and then we needn't
have had any of this Chess bother.”
“It's all the fault of the rules. Some
day somebody will realise that four
doesn't go into eleven, and then we shall
have a new rule.”
“No, I don't think so,” said HENRY.
“I don't fancy Major TREvoſt would
allow it.”
LITTLE BIOGRAPH. E.S.
Or, Who was Who?
IM MANUEL KANT (1724–1804).
It would be difficult to overestimate
the achievements of IM MANUEL KANT in
that realm of light literature of which
the Germans are such admirable ex-
ponents. His father was a strap-maker
in Königsberg, and thus possessed un-
exampled facilities for bringing up his
son in the way he should go. But we
must not waste time over anecdotes of
the little IM MANUEL's boyhood ; we must
pass on to a consideration of his place
in literature.
In upholding KANT's claims to be con-
sidered the pioneer of the New Humour
I we must not overlook the labours of
I)Avid Hu ME in the same field. It was
in a witty controversy with HUME that
KANT first made his mark. It is true
that he had already published his Dis-
sertatio de Mundi Sensibilis atque In-
telligibilis Forma ct Principiis; but this
delightful little volume, which has
since become so popular and is said to
be one of the favourite bedside books
of Dr. W. G. GRACE, acquired no more
than a local reputation at the time of
its issue. What really put KANT on his
mettle and led to the production of his
best work was a statement of HUME's
that apodeictic necessity could not be
discovered in casuality. KANT said he
should have thought HUME knew better
than to talk like that. Why, of course
it could. And he proved it in a work
brimming over ºil. fun. “ Could we
not add,” he asked, in the course of it,
“ from the intellect an inferential a
priori form, which, in combination with
the a priori perceptive form, might give

birth to an a priori schema supplying
necessity to casuality ?” HUME, tackled
in this pungent and searching manner,
could not deny it. He said, “Well, if you
put it in that way, perhaps we could.”
Of course every schoolboy can see the
point now, but KANT saw it first, and
if he had not exercised his whimsicality
on it we should not yet know exactly
where we stood with the a priori schema.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing to
be noticed about the career of IM MANUEL
KANT is that he was nearly sixty before
he met Hu ME in his own field and van-
quished him. No other known humourist
has had such a late (levelopment. Mr.

in his cradle ; Mr. BARRY I'vix and M.
MAETERLINCK secured an early hearing

PLAY GOLF 7
(Extract from a Golfer's Diary.)
July 21.-Played Robinsox, who would
never win a match if it wasn't for his
wife. Think that I shall start a links
for bachelors only. (Mem.–Suggest to
the committee that no married man is
allowed to play golf in the mornings
or afternoons.)
Hole I, I played perfectly, holing beau-
tiful long putt. Robinson hopeless.
One up.
Hole II. R. bunkered. Entirely his own
fault. Two up.
Hole III. Holed my approach, allowing
for both wind and slope of green ;
really a grand shot. Caught sight
of Mrs. R. as I walked to the next
tee. Three up.
Hole IV. Thought that I might have to
speak to Mrs. R. at any minute.
Missed my drive in consequence.
Disgusting ! Two up.
Hole V. R. seemed to be looking for his
wife instead of attending to what
I was saying. My drive lay on a
buttercup, and who the deuce can
be expected to play off buttercups?
One up.
Hole VI. Stymied R. Quite perfectly.
He pretended to think that we were
not playing stymies. We were. Two
up.
Hole VII. Saw Mrs. R. looking aimlessly
out to sea. These loafing ladies are
enough to put any man off his game.
Why can't they do something? One
up.
Hole VIII. R. may say what he likes,
but he waved to his wife. I was also
annoyed by his stockings, which I
should think Mrs. It. knitted. The
sort of useless thing she would do.
All square.
Hole IX. Got well away from Mrs. It.,
and though my caddie coughed as I
was approaching I laid my ball dead.
Beautiful shot. One up at the turn.
Hole X. Had the hole in my pocket when
R. laid his approach dead. Ridiculous
luck. All square.
Hole XI. Just as I was driving I saw
Mrs. R. still looking at the sea. I
complained, but R. took no rotice.
At any rate she cost me the hole.
One down.
Hole XII. VARION couldn't have played
better than I did, and even R. had to
say, “Good shot!” twice. All square.
Hole XIII. As I was putting I had a
feeling in my back that Mrs. R. had
arrived at last. Missed my putt and
only halved the hole.
Hole XIV. Couldn't see Mrs. R. any-
where. Wonderel where on earth
she had got to, or whether she was
drowned. Of course I lost the hole.
One down.
Hole XV. A little dispute, as R. claimed
that his ball – which was under a
wheelbarrow - was on ground under
repair. Absolutely foolish, and I told
him so. All square.
Hole XVI. Made a perfect drive, approach
and putt. Looked everywhere for
Mrs. R. and couldn't see her. One up.
Hole XVII. Completely put off by won-
dering when I should see Mrs. R.
Most unfair. Told my caddie I should
report him to the committee. All
square.
Hole XVIII. Saw Mrs. R. on a hill half
a mile away. Got on my nerves. R.
said, “Halloa, there's my wife! I
thought she wasn't coming out this
morning.” Lost the hole and the
match, and told the secretary that
R.'s handicap ought to be reduced.
THE unkindest thing that has yet been
said about Father BERNARD V AUGHAN
appeared in The Tablet last week; which
stated that his sermons on The Sins of
Society “were manifestly intended for
the benefit of those who were not all
thero.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the DiAny of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 16.-
Delightful time in Lords to-night.
Circumstances as indicated on Orders
of Day not promising. -
Business under discussion, London
County Council (General Powers) Bill.
Always pretty to watch noble Lords
dealing, however remotely, with London
County Council. Whilst the MARKiss
was still with us it was worth an hour's
patient sufferance of dreary procedure to
hear him casually allude to the House
of Commons. The scorn, the contempt,
the pained reluctance were charming.
Noble Lords especially of ancient Vic-
torian lineage hold and display same
feeling towards the L.C.C. SARK, who
has travelled in the East, tells me atti-
tude of majority of Lords towards this
latest development of autocratic power
created by popular vote always reminds
him of the camel when, taking its walks
abroad, it meets a tame elephant. It
throws back its head, curls lip and
nostril, and, till the elephant is out of
sight, assumes a severely “Don’t-know-
yah " '' expression.
To-night obliged for full hour to dis-
cuss L.C.C. and its works. Had decided
to negative clause in Bill authorising
Council to establish service of street
ambulances in London, when YouNG
WEMYss came to the front, claymore in
hand, proposing to lop off at a stroke
Clauses 27, 28, and 29. These author-
ised Council to supply electric ſittings
for the electric light they already have
power to purvey. Topic rather sordid ;
An ILLUMINANT of Extra RDINARY STA ING
Power.

A “Hypocritic AL WHITE.”
Mr. K-r H-rd-c. “Look here, young Sir, I engaged this machine for myself and my friend
here !”
Mr. F. E. Sm-th. “That's all right, old man, only I took it !!”
(Mr. K-r H-rd-e, who had announced his intention of moving the adjournment on the Natal
“Atrocities,” was forestalled by Mr. F. E. Sin-th.)
just sort of thing pettifogging County
Council would potter about. The states-
manlike glance of YoUNG WEMYss going
straight to heart of matter discovered
fresh attempt to extend principle of
municipal trading hateful to lofty minds.
With consummate art he at outset
introduced autobiographical touch that
straightway lifted the theme above the
level of Cheapside ; commanded atten-
tion of noble Lords who thought they had
been sufficiently bored. Lightly turn-
ing back the leaves of memory, he re-
called a November night in the reign
of Queen ANNE when he left the House,
strolling homewards in company with
HENRY ST. John, perhaps better known
in history as Lord BolixGBROKE. As they
carefully picked their way along the
oil-lamp-lit narrow streets that then
converged on the Palace of Westminster,
St. John, in high spirits at having got
through the Army Estimates at a single
s’tting, commented on the sufficient
brilliancy of the illumination.
“You couldn't imagine anything better
than this, Elcho, could you?” the War
Minister asked (Lord Elcho at that date
had not succeeded to the peerage).
YoUNG WEMYss modestly told the
listening Lords how in reply he had
confidently predicted discovery of an
illuminating element that would sup-
plant oil lamps in the street, wax candles
on the tables of the rich, farthing lights
in the dwellings of the poor. Confessed
he did not then precisely know the new-
comer would be gas. But gas it was,
and to gas had succeeded the electric
light.
Was that the fulfilment of develop-
ment, the last word of science 2 As
confidently as he had controverted St.
John's optimistic view about the per-
manency of oil as an illuminant, YouNG
WEMYss, standing to-night by way of
change at the corner of the Front Bench
below that on which Lord LANsdowne,
Lord AshbourNE and other ex-Ministers
sat entranced, declared that the electric
light was but a fleeting expedient. He
could not tell their Lordships what would
be the next article; but it would come.
This the picturesque prelude to an
argument calculated to shrivel up the
County Council, electric fittings and
all. Stubbornly, stupidly, confident that
oil lamps had come to stay, the prede-
cessors of the L.C.C. in Queen ANNE's
time formed a water park for the pre-
servation of their own whales, built
what Lord HAIsbuſy would call “a sort
of ” fleet of penny packet boats fitted up
with oil cisterns, and so prepared to
supply the lights o' London with sperm
oil for all time. This, of course, done at

-
expense of the ratepayers. When gas
dowsed the light of oil lamps, the capital
invested in water park and whales was
lost. The fleet of packet boats was dis-
patched by the JAck FishFR of the day
to the scrap heap, and grievous perma-
nent addition was made to the burden
of the rates. -
“My Lords,” said You Ng WEMyss, beat-
ing the palm of his left hand with a
rolled copy of the Orders of the Day,
“history will repeat itself. To-day gas
as a street illuminant has been super-
seded by electric light. The electric
light will go in its turn. I do not say
when or how. But go it will, and then
where will be your London County
Council with their barns full of electric-
light fittings 2"
Seemed as if nothing could withstand
this. Somehow or other when amend-
ment was submitted it was negatived,
and the obnoxious clauses remained
portions of a Bill read a third time
without division.
Business done.- Commons still croon-
ing over Education Bill in Committee.
House of Commons, Tuesday night-
“The House of Commons likes a Leader
who will show it sport.”
Thus PAM, discoursing midway in the
last century.
This afternoon PRINCE ARTHUR be-
thought himself of the axiom, and to
pleased surprise of House adopted it.
In Committee on Education Bill. Accus-
tomed to condition of inertia. Hot July
afternoon. Terrace crowded ; benches
nearly empty. Reached Part IV., which
provides a central Educatiºn Autho-
rity for Wales. An old familiar story;
was part of Bill as introduced, printed
and circulated. Apathy on the subject
indicated by empty benches. SMITH
of Liverpool, jealous for Parliamen-
tary control, rose from behind Front
Opposition Bench and moved amend-
ment substituting for the Authority
proposed by Bill the words “Con-
sultative Education Committee under
the IRoard of Education to be called the
Welsh Central Committee.”
Lloyd - GForge, protesting that the
Welsh Members were not afraid of
Parliamentary control, practically ac-
cepted the amendment. Added that
in order to carry out the designed pur-
pose it would be necessary to appoint a
Minister with a seat in the House
responsible for everything done by the
Welsh Council.
In certain moods PRINCE ARTHUR might
have seized the opportunity to compli-
ment his young friend the Member for
Liverpool on his success in imposing a
crucial amendment on an all-powerful
Government. Through his agency the
Opposition as a whole had scored heavily,
demonstrating the wholesome fact that
the battle is not always to the strong.
That would have been commonplace;
PRINCE ARTHUR is a genius.
He began quietly enough. Probably
when he started he had not fore-
seen whither he was going. As he
proceeded light dawned on him. He
followed it eagerly, passionately. Brush-
ing aside the familiar original clause
proposing a separate Education Autho-
rity for Wales, ignoring his able young
friend blushing with pleasure at accept-
ance of an important amendment, he
seized on the proposal that the Welsh
PRINCE ARTHUR IN TRAgic MELonn AMA.

lithe figure vibrant with horror at a

daring to touch with unhallowed hand
the Ark of the liberties and privileges
of the House of Commons. -
“An artificially engendered passion,”
Asquith bluntly called it. Actually it
was splendid, reviving regret frequently
felt during the last Parliament that
fortune had not led PRINCE ARTHUR's
steps in the direction of the stage door.
When, in his turn master of legions, he
was accustomed night after night to gag
a helpless minority, beaming on their
contortions a smile that made them
almost think they liked the discipline,
he charmingly filled the part of light
comedy. To-day he rose almost to the
height of tragedy.

The experiment of letting loose a con-

by epicures and others. We have, how-
ever, small sympathy with “Returned

complaining of the loss of a valuable
suit-case and a second cousin, owing to
an encounter with one of the new im-
portations in the passenger lift. Every
innovation must be attended by some
such trifling mishaps, and we trust that

70 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 25, 1906.
THE HEIGHT OF THE CATERPILLAR SE
THE INVINCIBLE ARMIDA.
It seems that when the people of
Damascus were at war it was the
custom to rely upon their Princess
Armida to crumple up the enemy by the
sheer force of her beauty. This enabled
the War Office to develop that military
economy which is so dear to the heart
of Mr. HALDANE. As one of her Maids
of Honour forcibly put it:
Ah! quel bonheur' Nos désirs sont comblés,
Sans nous coſter ni de sang ni de larmes.
It must therefore have been pecu-
liarly galling to the lady (who on her
own showing had captured a thousand
hearts without once losing her own) to
find, in the person of the redoutable
Renaud, a General Officer who remained
impervious to her fascination; enjoying,
in his own words, “une heureuse indif-
férence.” That was why she found it
necessary to supplement her physical
charms by those of certain “Spirits”
whom she was in the habit of summon-
ing from the vasty Inferno to obey her
magic art.
Following her directions—
(Démons affreux, cachez-vous
Sous une agréable image) -
they disguise themselves as Naiad or
Nymph; and, finding Renaud engaged in
a siesta on the usual open-air stage-sofa
by the banks of a thoroughly nice river,
they enchant him and dress him up in
rose-garlands; and with such good effect
that Armida, coming upon him with the
dagger of vengeance in her hand. is over-
come by his attractions; and remarks'
that
Il semble étre fait poºr l'Amour.
Many of us thought that he looked
rather ridiculous under his paper roses,
but Armida had a perfect right to her
own opinion.

Renaud, having discarded his armour,
together with all interest in military
glory, has settled himself down to a
good long spell of dalliance. He has
become habituated to wearing a wreath
of roses round his neck and under
one arm, like the strap of a field-
glass. Armida, on the other hand, is
restive. Hers is a more complex nature,
which suffers from presentiments; and
nothing will content her until she has
gone and consulted the powers of hell
as to the -best plan of detaining him
from the stern path of duty. She goes,
leaving him under the charge of “the

And very agreeable is their play, which
includes a Gavotte, a Minuet, and a
Sicilian Dance, all accompanied by lovely
gestures and delightful airs, that still
leave the hero cold and distrait in the
absence of the prima donna. Politely
requested to desist, the ballet leaves him
alone, and he is at once discovered by
his brother officers – an embarrassing
situation of which lie is acutely con-
scious.

The sentiment does him credit. It is
what you would expect from an officer
and a gentleman, guilty of desertion,
and found in an obscure retreat with a
flower garden round his neck.
He is easily induced to rejoin the
fighting-line; and though Armida, re-
turning in the nick of time, says “Ciel !”
and asks him, “ Must you go? Can't
you stay?" he is adamant, and leaves
her in a dead faint with the rather chilly
solace of this comment:

Having come to, she cries “Oil suis-je ?”
and orders her demons to set fire to the

I am informed that QUIN \t LT's libretto
had been already used some ninety years
before GLºck handled it. And, for all
its unconscious humour, I can under-
stand the fascination it had for com-
posers with a penchant for dance-music.
One is apt to weary of the incidental
ballet-“ dance of Russian peasants”
and so forth–that has no sort of relation
to the issues of a play. But here,
among these “Pleasures,” and Nymphs,
and Shepherdesses of the Spirit-world,
the ballet is of the very essence of the
drama. Each of its movements has a
meaning, and indeed the main design
seems constructed largely with the idea
of affording the ballet a sphere of influ-
ence. Of this the leading dancers
showed a sensitive appreciation, but I
am not sure that the rank and file of the
corps de ballet were fully conscious of the
importance of their mission and the signi-
ficance of gestures which had not always
been even learnt by heart. But the
orchestra, under M. MEssageR, showed a
very perfect sympathy with the exquisite
Sweetness of the music.

invention in her gestures, which were
too much confined within the limits of

SEVEILHAC, as Hidraot of Damascus,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Times History of the War (SAMPSON Low, MARSTON &
Co.) still has Mr. AMERY for its commander-in-chief, but the
G. O. C. Fourth Division (or volume) is Mr. BASIL WILLIAMs.
This volume dells with the operations conducted under the
chief command of Lord Roberts from his entry into Bloem-
fontein onwards; but there are supplementary chapters on
Kimberley and Mafeking, and it is to these that, as a non-
expert, I turn with most interest. (In the days of the war
I was as competent as another to talk of “turning move-
ments” and “advances in échelon,” but one must go with
The Times, and I have forsaken these for “rights of entry"
and Cowper-TEMPLE.) Mr. WiLLIAMs' story of Mafeking is
a distinguished piece of work, and the writer, very properly,
does not consider it beneath his dignity as an historian to
notice the lighter side of the siege. It was becoming the
fashion with some to belittle BADEN-Powell's resistance, but
Mr. WILLIAMs is not one of those.
In the earlier part of the book there is an exciting chapter
on “The First De Wet Hunt.” “Then began a wild night-
mare of pursuit. The British columns, now hot on the trail,
now missing it . . . kept stolidly trudging along with now
and then a brief interval, not so much for repose as to take
their bearings . . . until at last the men began to feel that life
was one stupid, almost ceaseless march.” Change “columns."
into “editors,” and “march '' into “pun,” and we have an
exact account of what was happening in Fngland at the same
time. That was not the least tragedy of the war.
The Ha'penny Millionaire (METHUEN), by GEORGE SUNDURY.
Is one of the most originally conceived pieces of farcical
writing I've read for ages.
I enjoyed reading it, and I'm sorry I can't, now it's done, bury
All my objectiºns and fault findings, and recommond every-
body, without prejudice, to peruse its pages.
But unfortunately, when a humorous writer makes jokes and
then works upon 'em, he
Is always apt to grow tedious, and Mr. SUNBI Ry certainly
has a tendency to use material which ought to go only
a little way, and makes it (like these lines) go rather a
long way,
Which may be an excellent method when dealing with matters
of economy,
Put if you mean to write a funny book it's most assuredly
the wrong way.
Sill, he undoubtedly has a nimble inmagination, and I'm not
at all sure that he couldn't do something tolerably
near perfection,
Iſ he were not so ready to run his jokes to death ;
And as this metre, if you can call it metre, scens rather
inclined to follow in very much the same direction,
Let's stop and take breath. l
It is no discre lit to Mrs. 13 Ali.I.E INEYNor is that Thºlas a
(Hitchix ox) recalls memories of Jane Eyre. The coincidences
are doubtless accidental, but they are marked. There is the
same strong man with wilful ways and a past; the same
attractive, homeless girl straying into his life, shrinking at
first from his grufiness, finally conquered by his passionate
love. Oddly enough the principal scenes are in both dramas
laid in a northern moorland country. Comparison with
('h AR101 it. BRONTE's masterpiece is daugerous. Mrs. REYNoll's
comes triumphantly out of the ordeal. The Master of Lock-
thwayte Mills is in his varying moods of morose ill-nature
and humble love an interesting study. Aldyth is a charming
girl, sunny as the Italy whence slie comes. . A cleverly con-
structed plot with succession of unexpected turns sustains
interest to the end, where the Master of the mill and Aldyth,
after hard climbing of the stony hill, reach the top, and, as with
the Greeks of old, there flashes on their sight the answer to
their prayers–Thalassa /
C1 DER.
IN praise of Beer long since a Cambridge bard
Adduced some arguments by no means shallow,
Which to refute would seem a task too hard
For one whose Muse is all untried and callow.
Against undue presumption I would guard,
Yet fain would follow longo interrallo,
And to his verses humbly add this rider
That there is something to be said for Cider.
The beverage that Calverley has sung
Was malt and hops, a sound and honest liquor,
That woke the living lyre and loosed the tongue
Of peer or peasant, parson or hop-picker–
A heaven-sent boon that made the heart feel young,
Though possibly it made the brain no quicker.
The modern stuff turned out from a laboratory
Could surely never have inspired such oratory.
True there are hardy souls among us still,
Convinced adherents of the foaming beaker,
Like that M.P. who mightly takes his fill,
Two pints of bitter, as he told the SPEAKER.
If he persists, I greatly fear he will
Become a Tory as his brain grows weaker.
Myself would rather drink the worst hotel hock
Than emulate the feat of Mr. BELLOC.
The thought has often struck me, when I've read
About the luxuries of other ag, s,
That epicures of old, when all is said,
Only attained quite elementary stages
In that great art of life, the being fed
And watered duly. Turning history's pages,
I'm not impressed by Sybaris or Crotona,
Since they knew not the worship of Pomona.
(To LEMPRii RE I am, I may confess,
Indebted for that piece of erudition.)
Pomona still shall all my heart possess,
Her cult shall be my self-appointed mission.
The more I hear of other drinks, the less
Am I disposed to alter my position,
Which is that cider is the only beverage
For those who live in this tºo sharp and clever age.
The man who has to use his wits can not,
And never could, sustain himself on whisky,
Whether produced from patent still or pot;
And other drinks are similarly risky.
The Cider drinker, though, can stand a lot
Without becoming dangerously frisky :
Ilis is a genial outlook, full of charity,
That still retains a perfect mental clarity.
Yet many a noble edifice of song
Has in the last lecn reared to glorify
This drink or that. They were nºt wholly wrong,
Those architects of Bacchic praise, and I,
Conscious my inspiration is less strong,
Am not concerned their merits to deny, -
Content to consecrate this small side Nº.
To Cider, wholesome produce of the Apple. X.Y.X.

Now let the weary House, its labour done,
Disport awhile in suits of airy flannel,
And swallow lotus, sitting in the sun,
Or climb an Alp or two, or swim the Channel,
Or read the nobler bards,
Being disbanded-like the 3rd Scots Guards.
Others have fairly earned the Blessed Isles,
They have deserved their fill of Ocean's breezes
Who bore the interrogatory BYLEs,
Who suffered HARDIE's whims, and LUPTON's wheezes;
But you, at yonder Bar,

I have not followed all your words —not all;
Friendship forewent that right and clung to rumour,
Which told me how the saintly gibes of PAUL
Yielded the crown to your more carnal humour;
Or how, with scorn like BURRE's,
You froze the unction oozing out of PERKs.
But there are limits; mortal man is frail;
Exhausted Nature needs a new afflatus;
And, as (to change my element) the whale
Replenishes his spouting apparatus,
You from the mighty sea
Might well repair the fount of repartee.
Not that as yet your stream of mirth is stayed ;
But you have been of late a little harried
By stuffy bores, at 90 in the shade,
Who left the atmosphere extremely arid ;
So, ere your wit’s at fault,
Let Norfolk's brine renew your Attic salt.
There the sea-wind shall loose your tangled hair,
And on your brow erase the wrinkly furrows,
And you shall lure the lobster from his lair
And chase the timorous coney to his burrows;
Thus having lightly romped, you
Will soon be feeling fresher, more impromptu.
Go, then, to Sheringham, my BiRRELL, go,
And with your children pluck a playful leisure;
And, if at times your vacant thoughts should flow
To what you call your “Education " measure,
- Thank Heaven, with solemn pauses,
No child of yours can come within its clauses.

ILLEGAL BALLOONING.
GEORGE BERNARD SHAw, the well-known aeronaut, who de-
scribed himself as “a dramatist,” was brought up last
Tuesday at the South Western police court on a charge of
trespassing in a balloon upon the property of various resi-
dents of Balham and Tooting. Parachute Detective ETHER
deposed that at about 7.30 P.M. on that day he was patrolling
his beat in one of the airships of the Atmospheric Police, in
that portion of the air immediately above the Balham Road,
when he saw accused's balloon at a height of between three
and four thousand feet above the back garden of a resident
of Balham. (Witness produced his stop-watch in proof of
his statement.) He drove his airship upwards, and warned
accused that he was trespassing, and instructed him to keep
to the atmosphere above the public roadway. Accused
replied that he (Witness) was a Philistine.
His Worship: What is a Philistine?
Witness: Cannot say, your Worship, but I'm a York-
shireman.
Witness, proceeding, said that accused was in evening
dress, and in other ways showed a peculiar demeanour. He
moved away when warned, but continued to trespass in the
air belonging to the property of some of the best people in
Balham and Tooting, and aggravated his offence by dropping
unfriendi, epigrams on the residents over whom he passed.
His Worship (to accused). What is your opinion of the
expression “You never can be SHAw?”
Accused. The remark cannot truthfully be addressed to
me, for that is my chief accomplishment. It could be said,
however, to any other person in this world.
His Worship. We cannot have the time of the Court
wasted by the facetiae of occupants of the dock. There is
hardly time for my own. Have you anything further (not of
a humorous nature) to say for yourself?
Accused was understood to reply that he had the greatest
respect for the Court, seeing that nowadays it was his
principal source of income.
At this point a clamour was heard in the corridor out-
side. On inquiring of the usher as to the meaning of the
noise his Worship was informed that several actor-managers
of the Victorian period were outside, anxious to give evidence
against the accused. Their spokesman, being admitted, in-
formed the magistrate that, while those for whom he appeared
were not sure of the charge brought against SHAw, they were
quite certain that he was guilty and deserved all he would get.
Accused was eventually bound over to come up when
called for.
His Worship. Considering the nature of the charge, I
ought perhaps to say “ come down" when called for. (Great
laughter.)
THE BREAKFAST SCORING BOARD.
Of all the many devices for extending the influence of
cricket, or at least of adapting cricket methods to home life
and thus fostering the natural love of the game, none strikes
us as so happy or ingenious as the Breakfast Scoring Board,
a simple enough piece of mechanism which, properly worked,
is calculated to keep the table merry, to remind it of the
tented field and incidentally to check gluttony. All that is
required is one of these boards, which may be obtained all
ready for use for three guineas carriage paid, and someone
to work it - the governess, say, who may have breakfasted
earlier or whose breakfast can easily be postponed until the
others have finished. The principle is precisely that of the
scoring boards in use at the chief cricket grounds, with
certain modifications. The actual score which we append
will give a better idea of the value and utility of this toy
than any words can : —

A MODERN MARTYR.
A PENSIVE body, middle-aged,
So mild, so uniformly placid,
That she could never be enraged
By what would make a saint grow
acid –
Some five-and-twenty years ago,
Urged by a dire infatuation,
She linked her lot, for weal or woe,
To Jones, who had no occupation.
Their only son is launched in life,
A settler on the river Murray,
Their only daughter is a wife
Who has a charming house in Surrey.
But Mrs. Jones, denied a home,
A martyr quite as great as Fox's,
Is doomed unceasingly to roam
And live for ever in her boxes.
Of perfect stamina possessed,
From centenarians descended,
Joxes spends his lifetime in the quest
Of health—although his health is
splendid.
Last year he throve upon a fare
Which now he views with utter loath-
1ng,
And monthly he elects to wear
New hygienic underclothing.
His doctors order exercise,
Fresh air and healthy recreation ;
And JoWEs assiduously tries
To combat physical stagnation.
Llandrindod welcomes him to-day,
To-morrow Droitwich lures him brine-
wards;
Next week 'tis Bath, or Alum Bay,
Or Bournemouth, and he hurries pine-
wards.
At scholarship inclined to scoff,
Yet fond of neither dogs nor horses,
Upon his diet and his golf
JoNES concentrates his mental forces;
Unmoved by mountain peaks sublime,
Or mid the most enchanting greenery,
Because he's thinking all the time
Of his inside, and not the scenery."
To travel with this fearsome freak,
This valetudinarian loafer,
I should decline, though for one week
He gave me all the gold of Ophir.
Yet his inestimable spouse,
All normal interests resigning,
Beneath her lifelong burden bows
Without the semblance of repining.
With him she trots from links to links,
Wearing a smile of saintly meekness;
With him the tea of China drinks
Though Indian is her special weakness.
Nor is she ever even found
Lacking in sympathy at dinner,
When JoxES reconstitutes each round,
And turns the tables on the winner.
Fine weather keeps him out of doors,
But when it rains or even drizzles—
The slightest moisture he abliors—
Her fate is worse than patient
GRIZEL's.
For JoxES exacts attentive heed
To his malingering recital,
And poses as an invalid
When Mrs. JoxEs deserves the title.
No chance of respite or reward
To her the future seems to offer,
Unless some random rubber-cored
Despatches this dyspeptic golfer.
Already shrunken to a shred
By her devotion self-denying,
She perseveres, and when she's dead
He'll blame her selfishness in dying.
Divines are wont to disagree
Acutely in regard to Heaven,
Some doctors holding it to be
A single sphere, and others seven ;
But JoxEs's consort entertains
No doubt about one crucial question;
There will, upon the heav'nly plains,
Be neither golf nor indigestion,

in time. It is therefore specially adapted
for busy men.
People who don't like music
will find the invention a great boon, as
they will be able to get it all orer at once.
A Child can start it,
BUT NOTHING WILL STOP IT
Till it has run down.
A pint of petrol will keep it
going all night.
The Pianolyzer can be made
to go THREE weeks without stop-
ping by a patent device which
will be appreciated by persons
about to go to the seaside. It
will keep burglars out while the
family is away from home, and
will also give the owners the
pleasant assurance that they will
not be forgotten by their neigh-
bours during their absence.
The Pianolyzer can be fitted
with double-barrelled gramo-
phone, so as to sing a large
number of vocal duets, as well as
solos, to its own accompaniment.
Will also give recitations and
make political speeches, &c. Never till
now has it been possible to possess a
machine that will play, sing, talk and
recite without stopping, and without the
necessity of any attention being paid
to it.
The Pianolyzer may be obtained fitted
with patent ALARTM ATTACHMENT, so as
to start at any desired hour in the morn-
ing. It will effectually wake the house-
hold, and render it impossible for them
to go to sleep again.
The Pianolyzer may be put to no end
of different uses, as the following testi-
monials will show.
PAPEREwski writes: GENTLEMEN, --
The Pianolyzer made my hair stand on
end
Bl's Ni writes:-. . . . An astonishing
invention. It actually played through
the whole of BEEThovº N’s “Eroica ’’
symphony in seven and a half minutes;
and though I put the brake on hard it
was impossible to check its speed. It
has certainly established a record that
will take a lot of beating.
The following letters speak for them-
selves: —
71, Armony Avenue, N.
GENTLEMEN, The Pianolyzer you sup-
plied has given me great enjoyment.
I bought it as a present for a friend of
mine at No. 75, and had it connected
with my house by a concealed wire, so
that I could start it whenever I wished.
It works admirably
75, Armony Arenue, N.
Please send man at once to rectify
Pianolyzer. The last three nights it
has started of its own accord at half-
past one and played for two hours in
spite of all my efforts to stop it. Last
evening before going to bed I moved
it away from the piano, but at 1.30 it
walked across the room to the keyboard
and started off as before. Cannot stand
it any longer.

A FARMER writes: – Being short-
handed during the hay-harvest, I had
your 3 horse-power Pianolyzer brought
into the field and set to work. It acted
splendidly and made hay of everything.
PATERFAMILLAs writes:–I cannot find
words to express my gratitude to you
for your admirable invention. Having
four boys home for the holidays, and
being at my wits' end to know what
to do with them, I hit on the idea of
buying two of your Pianolyzers. These
were taken into the harness-room, and,
as I quite expected, the boys set the two
machines to fight each other. I have
now no difficulty in finding suitable
amusement for them on wet afternoons.
N.B.-Every Pianolyzer is fitted with
three-speed gear, powerful Bowden

THE ‘‘CHILDREN'S PAGE.”
Hints to Editors. By Helen and Cecil.
How it started was that I said to CECII.
that Children's Pages were all rot; and
CECIL said they were not all rot, and
that he wished I wouldn't spoil the little
commonsense I had by making such
sweeping assertions.
And then, of course, we had to argue
it out, and while we were getting hotter
and hotter Dad came along and listened.
“Evidently, CECIL, you are bound for
the Bench ' " he said ; “and as
for you, HELEN, you are going
to turn out the ordinary incon-
sistent woman But so far as I
can gather from this painful
argument you both mean about
the same thing. You like the
solids in the Children's Page,
but object to the atmosphere !”
We really hadn't a notion
what he meant, but anyhow we
thought we would write to the
separate editors, but that was
such an awful fag that CECIL
said :
“If we write to Mr. Punch
he'll tell all the editors at one
go ' "
So we started the letter about
six times, but kept spoiling such lots of
paper that we agreed that we would
each write our own bits and sign them.
I let CECIL begin, because he 's the
politest, and we want to try not to hurt
their feelings.
“If you are an editor, would you
mind being an editor, and not an Aunty,
or an Uncle, or an Old Chum, or a Big
Sister, or anything like that?–CECIL.”
“Yes, and please don't call us Chick-
ies, or Dickies, or Lambies, or Starbeams,
or Sweet Violets. We hate to think
that you are like the ladies at the
garden parties who ask us how old we
are, and tell us how we are growing.
Like one said to me only yesterday:
‘I wonder, my ducky, whether your
little leggy-peggies would mind running
across the lawn and bringing me that
wee chairy-wairy !’ And you mustn't
think us horrid little beasts, but we
don't much care about having your
love and kisses every week. They are
rather boring, and fill up the page, and
it is not as if they came to anything.

[AUGUST 1, 1906.
OUT OF TOWN
The Children's Country Holiday Fund, which last year sent 38,500
children into the country for at least a fortnight, is appealing for
subscriptions. The address of the Fund is 18, Buckingham Street,
Strand, W.C., and the Hon. Treasurer is the Earl of ARRAN.
If you were a piper gay and bold,
Like the fellow who tuned his pipe of old
In wonderful Hamelin city;
And if from alley and court and street
There sounded a patter of little feet
Whenever you blew your ditty;
And if, as you still kept blowing free,
There came a murmur of childish glee
That swelled into shouts and laughter;
And so with a rush the children came
And danced about you and called your name,
And told you they'd follow after -
A swarm of thousands of London girls
With their dolls and toys and their hair in curls,
And everyone nicely dressed too,
And a noisier mob of boys mixed in
With the mob of girls in a joyful dim,
And all in their Sunday best too;
And if they cried, “We are tired of town |
Oh, piper, couldn't you set us down
In a place where there's grass to roll in,
With shady banks where the girls could sit
And tidy their dolls or sew or knit,
And fields for the boys to bowl in 2
“Where there isn't a bobby to stop your play,
But you're taking the air the whole long day,
And the milk's as fresh as the air is ;
And sometimes – teacher has told us this --
When the nights are still you can get a kiss
From the lovely Queen of the Fairies.
“Oh, piper, let us be up and gone!
We'll follow you quick if you'll pipe us on,
For all of us want to go there.
So fill up your pipe and blow for joy
As hard as you can, and girl and boy
Will step to the tune you blow there.”
If this were the cry of the swarming crowd,
Oh, wouldn't you pipe it sweet and loud,
With your collar for comfort undone;
And wouldn't you trudge it free and gay
Until you had drawn them miles away
From the smother and smoke of London 2
13ut you haven't a pipe, and if you had
Your blowing would only make people sad
If anyone chanced to hear it;
\nd the children, you think, must stop and ſale
In the hot dark city that man has made,
Though God's own country is near it.
But hark' there's a voice from the noisy Strand,
\nd it says, “If you want to lend a hand,
| m looking for hands to horrow.
Pax up, pay down, and I'll pipe like mad,
And the crowd shall follow me glad as glad
To day, or at most to-morrow!
... I'll take them and keep them and tend them there
Where the trees are green and there's air to spare,
And never a field is barren.
So send your money and call the tune
And order the piper to play it soon

MY TEAM.
III.--IN THE TRAIN.
If there is one thing I cannot stand it is ingratitude.
Take the case of CAREY. CAREY, you may remember, pro-
fessed himself unable to play either Bridge or Chess; and
as we had a three-hour journey before us it did not look as
though he were going to have much of a time. However,
HENRY and I, thinking entirely of CAREY's personal comfort,
went to the trouble of buying him a Solitaire board, with
glass balls complete. The balls were all in different
colours.
I laid this before CAREY as soon as we settled in the train.
“Whatever's that ?” he asked.
“The new game,” I said. “It’s all the rage now, the
man tells me. The Smart Set play it every Sunday. Young
girls are inveigled into lonely country houses and robbed
of incredible sums.”
CAREY laughed scornfully.
“So it is alleged,” I added. “The inventor claims for
it that in some respects it has advantages which even
cricket cannot claim. As for instance, it can be played in
any weather; nay, even upon the sick bed.”
“And how exactly is it played 2"
“Thus. You take one away and all the rest jump over
each other. At each jump you remove the jumpee, and the
object is to clear the board. Hence the name –Solitaire.”.
“I see. It seems a pretty rotten game.”
That made me angry.
“All right. Then don't play. Have a game of marbles
on the rack instead.”
Meanwhile HENRY was introducing Bolton and the Editor
to each other.
“Two such famous people,” he began.
“Everyone,” said BoltoN with a bow, “knows the Editor
of ----.”
“Oh, yes, there's that. But I meant two such famous
Chess players. Boltox,” he explained to the Editor, “was
twelfth man against Oxford some years ago. Something
went wrong with his heart or he'd have got in. On his day,
and if the board was at all sticky, he used to turn a good
deal from Q B 4.”
“Do you really play ?" asked Boltox eagerly.
board here.” -
“Does he play ! Do you mean to say you have never heard
of the Trocadero Defence 2''
“The Sicilian Defence –--"
“The Trocadero Defence. It's where you palm the other
man's Queen when he's not looking. Most effective opening.”
. They both seemed keen on beginning, so HENRY got out
the cards for the rest of us.
I drew the Younger Journalist, against IIENRY and the
Senior Stockbroker. Out of compliment to the journalist we
arranged to play half a crown a hundred, that being about
the price they pºy him. I dealt, and a Problem arose imme-
diately. Here it is.
“A. deals and leaves it to his partner B., who goes No
Trumps. Y. leads a small heart. B.'s hand consists of king
and three small diamonds, king and one other heart, king
and three small clubs, and three small spades. A. plays the

to do.
Later on when I was Dummy I strolled over to the Chess
players,

“What's the ground like 2 " said the Editor, as he finessed
a knight.
“Sporting. Distinctly sporting.”
“Long grass all round, I suppose ?”
“Oh, lord, no. The cows eat up all that.” .
“Do you mean to say the cows are allowed on the pitch 2"
“Well, they don't put it that way quite. The pitch is
allowed on the cows' pasture land.”
“I suppose if we make a hundred we shall do well ?”
asked somebody.
“If we make fifty we shall declare,” I said.
BoLTON, that 's a pretty smart move.”
I may not know all the technical terms, but I do under-
stand the spirit of Chess. The Editor was a pawn up and
three to play, and had just advanced his queen against
BoLION's king, putting on a lot of check side, as it seemed
to me. Of course I expected Boltox would have to retire
his king; but not he He laid a stymie with his bishop,
and it was the Editor's queen that had to withdraw.
BoLION was only spare man at Cambridge'
“I am not at all sure,” I said, “that Chess is not a finer
game even than Solitaire.”
“It's a finer game than cricket,” said. BoltoN, putting
his bishop back in the slips again.
“No,” said the Editor. “Cricket is the finest game in
the world. For why? I will tell you.”
“Thanks to the glorious uncertainty of our national Pas-
time,” began the Journalist, from his next Monday's article——
“No. Thanks to the fact that it is a game in which one
can produce the maximum of effect with the minimum of
skill. Take my own case. I am not a batsman, I shall
never make ten runs in an innings, yet how few people
“By Jove,
Yet
realise that! I go in first wicket i down, wearing my
M.C.C. cap. Having taken guard with the help of 'a bail,
I adopt PALAIRET's stance at the wicket. Then the bowler
delivers: either to the off, to leg, or straight. If it is to
the off, I shoulder my bat and sneer at it. If it is to leg,
I swing at it. I have a beautiful swing which is alone
worth the money. Probably I miss, but the bowler fully
understands that it is because I have not yet got the pace
of the wicket. Sooner or later he sends down a straight
one, whereupon I proceed to glide it to leg. You will see
the stroke in 13ELDAM's book. Of course I miss the ball, and
am given out l.b.w. Then the look of astonishment that
passes over my face, the bewildered inquiry of the wicket-
keeper, and finally the shrug of good-humoured resignation
as I walk from the crease! Nine times out of ten square-
leg asks the umpire what county I play for. That is cricket.”
“Quite so,” I said, when he had finished. “There's only
one flaw in it. That is that quite possibly you may have to
go in last to-day. You'll have to think of some other plan.
Also on this wicket the ball always goes well over your head.
You couldn't be l.b.w.. if you tried.”
“Oh, but I do try.”
“Yes. Well, you'll find it difficult.”
The Editor sighed.
“Then I shall have to retire hurt,” he said.
BoLTON chuckled to himself.
“One never retires hurt at Chess,” he said, as he huffed
the Editor's king. “Though once,” he added proudly, “I
sprained my hand, and had to make all my moves with the
left one. Check.”
The Editor yawned, and looked out of the window.
“Are we nearly there?” he asked.

WHY THE BOOK is WRITTEN.
I AM getting an old dog now, and
infirm, and, before my powers fail
me, I wish to set down all I remember
of the Captain, that the World may see
what it lost in him.
Never was there such a dog as the
Captain, and never again shall we see
the like of him. Had he not been cut
off in the prime of his life, he might have
risen to any position. What an intellect

My EARLY LIFE.
Myself, I come of a very old Norfolk
family, but one which has never been
notable for brains, however much it may
have distinguished itself in the world of
sport. Of me they could not even make
a sportsman. They tried to train me to
fetch game, but failed to teach me.
My brief life in the country was very
unhappy, and the wonder is that I did
not have all the spirit beaten out of me,
for the gamekeepers were as cruel as
they were ignorant. Fortunately they
gave me up as a bad job before it was
too late, and I was sent to Town.
Tow.N.
To one who has lived in the quiet
country, Town at first is overwhelming.
My new master and mistress seemed
inclined to be kind to me, but, after the
treatment to which I had been accus-
tomed, it was long before I could get
over my mistrust of humans of any sort.
And the first time they took me out for
a walk in the crowded streets, I wished
myself dead. To me it was merely a
new form of torture. The traffic |
Never had I seen anything so prodigious
and so dangerous. It amuses me, with
my present hearty contempt of it all, to
think that I should ever have been so
simple. For quite a week my brain
reeled whenever I was in the streets,
and I was as one in a dream, and, if my
mistress had not kept a close eye on me,
Heaven knows what would have become
of me! I dreaded going out, and I had
to be dragged the first part of the
journey. The motor-cars and the horses
filled me with terror. All, for me, had
but one object, and that was to run over

me. I saw myself being used as a foot-
ball by the horses, while they kicked
me from one to the other with horrible
grating laughs. No dog could survive
for long, I felt sure, and in my ignorance
I thought that the butchers' shops and
the fur stores explained what became of
us after death, and the sight of them
turned me cold. Once, when a fire-
engine tore past me, I frankly fainted.
A mere look from another dog would
throw me into a palsy. And then there
were the tradesmen's boys, who, seeing
that I was nervous, would shout at me,
at which I would run off at full speed
with my tail between my legs, and
baskets and things would be thrown
after me.
As I said, although these terrors were
very vivid at the time, it now fills me
with amusement to recall them.
I MEET THE CAPTAIN.
It was the Captain who cured me of
my traffic-funk.
I remember well my first meeting
I was not so sure about the stranger.
My master then left us, and I trembled
slightly.
I recollect, also, that my first impres-
sion of the Captain was that he was an
ugly dog. I cannot understand how I
came to be so mistaken, and I have often
reproached myself for it. But even at
that time, I remember, I was not so
stupid as not to be struck by a certain
air of distinction about him which I had
noticed in no other dog.
As a matter of fact he was a dog who,
though of small stature, would attract
attention in any assemblage.
His face was the face of a setter, with
something of the added dignity of a
blood-hound, and all the intelligence of
a St. Bernard. His body was a fox-
terrier's, and his tail, like his brain, his
OWI).
Further, he was the only illustrated
dog I have ever met. On his coat was
a most clever design, in black, of a
pigeon kissing a puppy, and he would
have been remarkable for this, if for
nothing else.
I should also mention his beautiful
ultramarine eyes, which played havoc
with the fair sex.
His sunny smile I shall not attempt
to describe.
In two minutes we were friends, in
five I was his slave.
THE CAPTAIN's PARENTs.
Subsequently I learnt that the Cap-
tain's father was an all-sorts dog, of a
They tried to train me to fetch
with him. He belonged to some rela-
tives of my master who lived in the
neighbourhood. One day my master
took me to see these relatives. On
entering the house I was terrified to
find another dog there, for at that time
I had a wholesome dread of all town
dogs, and I even tried to run away.
However, my master held me, and called
the strange dog, and patted both of our
heads, and said, “Now, you two, you're
going to be friends. You won't hurt
one another, I know.” I recollect
thinking that the latter part of the
statement might be true about me, but
game, but failed to teach me.
lively though irresponsible nature. His
mother—and I think that this, perhaps,
is what unconsciously drew us to one
another—was a field-spaniel, like myself.
Curiously enough, there was not in the
Captain one single feature of either
parent. But this was only characteristic
of the Captain's originality. His mother,
I hear--and I can well believe it—was a
very sweet creature, and she died be-
loved and respected by all who knew
her, both dogs and humans. Her end
is said to have been caused by the fact
that, because she was considered to have
married beneath her, she was brutally

cut by her own relations. Being of an
exceptionally affectionate disposition, she
pined away. The Captain was the
child of their old age; and I believe it
not infrequently happens that such
offspring are preternaturally sharp. As
a pup he was known as “The little
Nipper,” and he was independent of his
mother in an exceptionally short time.
When a mere stripling, great things
were prophesied for him. He was, all
recognised, a dog with a future.
THE CAPTAIN gives ME so ME ADVICE.
As I have said, almost from the first
moment of our meeting the Captain and
I were friends; and in a very few
minutes I found myself making a con-
fidant of him. We were, we discovered,
both orphans, and I think that was a
bond between us. I told him all about
my unhappiness, and my wretched
nervousness, and, instead of claſſing
me, as some fellows would have done,
he gave me good advice. He told me
that I was neurotic (which frightened
me), and advised me to eat as much
meat as possible (which pleased me).
He pointed out how foolish and dangerous
it was for me to be panic-stricken in
the streets, and that I must learn to
keep a cool head. And he took some
pains to show me how unnecessary it
was to be afraid of horses. “Long
noses,” he called them, contemptuously.
“Why, the poor devils cannot call
their souls their own ' " he said. “Note
how they are forced to keep to the road-
way, and note how they submit to it
without a murmur. See, again, in what
a servile manner they will stop when
a policeman merely holds his hand up.
Frequently I come on a whole row of
them drawn up like this; and what do
I do? I stroll across the road in front
of them with what swagger I am capable
of, chaffing them as I go ; and all that
the silly cattle do to show their irritation
is to move their ears about in a stupid

car than a horse, any day ! Horses work
the hair off their backs, and scarcely
ever seem to think of protesting. Last
year, ninety-two policemen were bitten
by dogs, but only six by horses. In
his world, if you want freedom, you
must fight for it.”
How eloquent, and how true ! And
he told me how to deal with the trades-
men's boys. “Sniff and snarl at their
ankles as though you dined off trades-
men's boy every day. It'll be they who
will run then.”
And he gave me many other useful
hints. For instance, I told him of the
difficulty I experienced in running down-
stairs with humans --how I always got
in their way, or they in mine. He
showed me a capital method of avoiding
this.
“Treat the treads of the stairs next

“Nonsense !” said the Captain. “A
young fellow of your age—over two, I
should say?”
“Fact,” said I.
“Well, don't you put up with it,” he
said. “No wonder you suffer from
nerves.”
“But how am I to stop it?” I asked.
“Easy enough,” answered the Cap-
tain ; “refuse to eat the P.B.'s.”
“But then I shall starve,” I said.

When the time came for my master
to leave, he actually had to drag me
away from the Captain, so disinclined

friend, and I remember my master was
greatly amused at this. -
“Well, good-bye, oll fellow " (how
the “old fellow "pleased me!), said the
Captain, and he made arrangements to
take me out one day. “Meanwhile,
buck up,” were his parting words.

me feel a different dog, and on my way
home I barked at a town cat-and I still
remember her look of amused surprise.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN respect of bulk ('oniston (MACMILLAN) is built on the
scale of the United States. Our little island is scarcely
big enough wherein to sit down and read its 543 pages
of, for a novel, exceptionally small type. Its ideal form
of publication would have been in a weekly or monthly
magazine, where, after due interval, the pleased reader would
regularly have come upon his accustomed whack. There is
no reason why the supply should have been stopped as long
as the magazine survived. The long prelude to the story is
episodical. Each chapter is a sketch of public or social life in
New England, with peeps at Washington and New York.
If here and there up to page 372 a chapter were left out, it
wouldn't make any odds. Accept the circumstantial account
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL (no connection with the Colonial
Office) gives of public life in his country as only partially
true, Congress and the Senate want clearing out as thoroughly
as do the canning establishments of Chicago, whose dire
secrets have of late been told by another American novelist.
They are pictured as hopelessly corrupt, their members
purchasable by the highest bidder. Nor is the White House
apparently as pure as it is painted. The epoch dealt with is
the Presidency of General GRANT. A great deal has happened
since then, including Mr. TheoDORE ROOSEVELT. No doubt
they manage things better now. It was pretty bad in the
time of Jethro Bass, whom Mr. CHURCHILL admits to be drawn
from a living model “typical of his era.” Jethro’s simple
process was to lend money to needy neighbours, obtain a
mortgage on their belongings, and then use them as agents
in establishing personal supremacy in his native State.
Incidentally we have many sketches of quaint New England
characters. When through these extraneous mazes Mr.
CHURCHILL at long length reaches his story, it is so finely
conceived, so admirably told, that the conscientious reader
realises the added pleasure of knowing that virtue is some-
times rewarded. If only he had yielded to the temptation
that beset him through nearly two-thirds of the book to
“take it as read,” he would have missed a rare treat. But
why should a fine racer be thus handicapped 2
If those who liked EY RE HUSSEY's book,

To read just such another one,
Or better, in the last he 's done,

Disappoint them not a little.
A Girl, he calls it, of Resource,
And so she is ; but though, of course,
In fiction girls may rightly shine
As something extra superfine,
This girl beats all - she's part demureness,
I'lus a dozen parts cocksureness.
The worst of these last is, perhaps,
The way she quotes from poet chaps;
To such a length her excerpts go
That Messrs. L. Nº M \Ns, GREEN & Co.
Might almost, and without apology,
Have called the novel an Anthology.
('omparisons are odious, no doubt, but when Circumstance
projects two books into one's hands at the same time, and
one is called Wilhelmina in London (John LoNG) and the
other l'elicity in France (HEINEMANN) it is clear that one must
disregard proverbial philosophy. Of the twain, Wilhelmina
in London, by BARRY PAIN, is the less important: a series of
cynical stories of the attempts of a friendless girl to make a
living in this city by fair means and questionable. Like so
much of Mr. PAIN's work the book begins well and tails off,
and it certainly carries no conviction with it. The other
book is a tenderer and truer thing. Felicity has quick eyes
and much spirit and taste, and her mélange of the humours
of travel, descriptions of scenery, i. wayside gossip,
aperçu and the kindly comments of Aunt Anne is exceedingly
palatable. For Felicity in France, when it gets into Tauch nits,
one may safely predict much popularity, to say nothing of
its present form.
The author is CoNSTANCE Elizabeth MAUD,
A perfect companion for travel abroad.
The second paragraph of Around the Camp Fire (HARRAP).
by C. G. D. Roberts, begins thus:–“ It was towards Lake
Temiscouata and the wilds of the Squatooks that we set our
eager faces. In shirt sleeves and moccasins we went.” That
is the way a book ought to start. You know at once that
the question whether MARY marries the curate won't arise,
and that instead the business will be with bears and panthers
and such. Unfortunately all the bears are second-hand, for
the book is made up entirely of stories that the moccasined
Squatookers tell each other of an evening. It becomes awk-
ward in one case where the author gets himself three-deep
in inverted commas. (“‘“What is it?” said I, under my
breath.) I give the palm to “An Adventure with a Bull
Moose.” Proxime accessit –“ Peril among the Pearls.” But
there are also stories of alligators, tigers, dog-fish, caribou,
and more bears and more panthers. It is a capital book, and
one that makes the Londoner more discontented than ever
with London. Indeed all my pride is gone from me, for I
see now that my “Adventure with a Woolly Bear in Hyde
Park” of last Tuesday must remain for ever unwritten.
Mr. Punch is confident that Mr. ALGERNoN ASHTON would
not have broken his habitual silence except under a sense of
injustice, and he has sincere pleasure in apologising very
heartily for the grave (if he may so say) injury which he has
done to Mr. AshtoN in the matter that forms the subject of
the following note:
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-In your delightful notice of my book,
Truth, Wit, and Wisdom, there is a slight inaccuracy which
I trust you will kindly permit me to put right. You state
that the “majority" of my 525 letters of which the volume
consists “deal with monumental masonry.” After carefully
examining each letter, I find that out of the 525 only 202
deal with monumental masonry, so that, instead of these
letters being in the majority, you will perceive that the exact
opposite is the case.
Sincerely thanking you for your many kindnesses to me,
which you may be sure I duly appreciate.
I am, dear Mr. Punch,
Your faithful admirer,

THE DETACHMENT OF PRENDERBY.
W.
“You naturally ask me,” said I-and the statement was
rhetorical, for PRENDERBY had not touched upon the topic –
“you naturally ask me how it is that I have absented me
awhile from the felicity of communion with you? To tell
truth, this BIRRELL Session has somewhat bored me, and I
assumed that you shared my apathy.”
“You were justified in that conjecture,” replied PRENDERby.
“The more I hear of Nonconformist arguments, the stouter
becomes my loyalty to the Church; and the more I read of
Church views, the deeper grow my suspicions that the
Nonconformists are really in the right. If either side had
had the courage to be silent, it might have enjoyed the benefit
of my support. As it is, I sympathise greatly with the
attitude of Sir CARNE RASCH, who seems to have made it a
principle to vote against every Education Bill that he comes
across. Like Ogniben in A Soul's Tragedy, he has known
(and disapproved of) ‘four-and-twenty leaders of revolt.'
Indeed I should be inconsolable but for my faith in the
Child's intuitive indifference to what is regarded by each new
authority as best for his immortal soul—an intuition amount-
ing almost to an intellectual gift.”
“This indifference of the Child,” I said, with my usual tact
in arranging conversational transitions for PRENDERBY, “no
doubt extends to the proposed reduction in the Navy. But
do you imagine the adult public is equally unconcerned about
this momentous feat of economy?”
“I cannot say,” replied PRENDERby. “You might suppose
that a people of which the vast mass, as we are told, declines
to lift a finger in defence of its country, would be prepared
to pay a reasonable sum for professional protection. And yet
I understand that the reduction of the Services was one of
some five or six dozen mandates which it conferred upon
the present Government. If the Government honestly believe
this and if they are further convinced that no greater
intelligence is demanded of them, as the nation's trustees,
than is demanded of the irresponsible elector, then I cannot
blame them. . And only see how cleverly they have managed
their retrenchment. They reduce the Army on the ground
that England's only defence is in her Navy, and then they
reduce the Navy on the ground that, having reduced one
Service, they must, to be consistent, reduce the other.
“That, of course, is not the reason they give. They prefer
to contend that a nation, when it is represented in a padded
pew at a Peace Conference, looks a bit less of a hypocrite if
it is only armed to the teeth, and not to the back teeth; and so
it comes to this—that instead of going to the Haguites and
saying: ‘Look here, our Navy is so powerful unat, as far as
we are concerned, you might as well shut up "our dockyards
at once,' they prefer to say: 'Please note that we are now
arranging a reduction in our Navy; so that, if two or three
of you others only go on building ships for all you're worth,
you may presently, between you, make a very pretty match
of it with ours.’”
“I doubt,” said I, “whether the Hague has very much to
do with the reduction. The Government are probably econo-
mising, for their own ends, on the strength of the friendly
relationships established (by their predecessors) with other
leading naval Powers.”
“I should greatly like to hear what our allies of the Far
East think about that,” said PRENDERby ; “for, when they
don't talk, they have the parrot's habit of thinking the more.
“But really the Government's best argument (though not
put forward as such) lies in their New Transvaal Constitution.
If we are going to reduce our Imperial responsibilities—if,
for instance, we are going to hand back South Africa to the
Boers--we can no doubt afford to make a proportionate
reduction in the Navy.”
“You have been reading KIPLING's latest poem,” I hazarded.
“And what if I have 2" asked PRENDERBY.
“Didn't you find it rather strident?” I asked.
“Strident?” said he, “of course it was strident. How
else do you suppose he could hope to get a hearing 2 Every
idea has to be exaggerated, underlined, rubbed in, if you
want to penetrate this pachyderm of a public. KIPLING was
talking at the top of his voice because he saw that we were
sleepy and had forgotten things.” -
... “But did you notice how The Westminster Gazette rebuked
him 2''
“If,” said PRENDERby very gravely, “you refer to a West-
minster Cartoon, in which KIPLING was represented waving a
Union Jack while John BULL looked on and said: ‘Well, I
suppose KIPLING can't help it, but I thought that sort of thing
had been forgotten '--I did notice it. And it struck me as
being about the soundest smack (dealt of course uninten-
tionally) that the Government have yet received from their
own side. Never was a truer word said, in jest or earnest.
They have ‘forgotten that sort of thing.' One would suppose
that the war with the Boers had never been fought; that we
had been members of the same family for a brace or two of
generations. Yes, they have learned nothing and they have
forgotten' everything.”
+ + + + +
It was at this point that I felt I had to go away. I can
stand a good deal from a man like PRENDERBY, who prides
himself on his freedom from prejudice and takes advantage
of his detachment to throw off these dreadful home truths.
But if he was going to try and shake my faith in my

“I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER—”
WE have received the following circular, which explains itself.
THE RECOLLECTIONS STOREs, LTD.
DEAR SIR, OR MADAM, -It is a duty laid upon every person
nowadays, who has frequented good society, to issue towards
the latter end of his life a Volu ME of RECOLLECTIONs of eminent
personages whom he has met, and of interesting events of
which he was a witness.
But the marshalling of recollections involves serious brain
fag, while in many cases one's opportunities of meeting per-
sons of distinction have been limited. We have accordingly
made arrangements by which WE UNDERTAKE TO PROVIDE, FoR
ANY PERSON PAYING our SMALL FEE, A Volt ME of REM.INISCENCEs,
which, from our wide experience and the numerous sources
of information at our disposal, we are able to guarantee as
likely to pass through a number of editions and to have all
its best stories republished by T. P.'s Weekly.
Do not be deterred from writing to us merely because you
are of no importance in the social or intellectual scale.
By our methods ANY Person can publish his recollections.
ANY REASONABLE SERIEs of EvKNTs may be selected by
clients as being within their experience.
Also clients may select any distinguished personage for
recollection purposes—providing that the personage, if not
now alive, has been alive during some period of client's life.
OUR PRICES ARE REGULATED BY THE DEGREE OF INTIMACY which
you wish to have represented as existing between yourself
and the personage, and by the standing of such personage.
Thus you may be shown as having been on nodding terms
with CARLYLE for one guinea per recollection; you may have
dined with him, together with necessary table-talk, for from
two guineas to fifty shillings, while for a five-pound note you
may have been in the habit of dropping in informally of an
evening. On the other hand, you may have been the life-
long friend of MARTIN TUPPER for one and ninepence, while
only eleven-pence halfpenny would be charged for a calling
acquaintance.

OUR “SPECIAL.” Volume of RECoLLECTIONs a class of goods
particularly recommended- is divided into THREE SECTIONs.
Section I.-Childhood.
This period can be made particularly interesting, as a client
may claim to have known many personages who would be dead
by the time he had grown to manhood. Moreover client's
early life, obscured as it is likely to be by the mists of time,
cannot easily be quoted as being inconsistent with the details
mentioned in the recollections. Clients born five or more
years before 1850 may meet WoRDsworth near Grasmere for
twenty-five and six, and for an additional half-sovereign he
may spend an hour in their company “listening to their boyish
prattle” or “their childish confidences"—as clients prefer.
For thirty-one and sixpence clients may recollect being
taken by their father to see a stern and lonely old man in a
high rambling house, and being told that the old man was
J. M. W. TuRNER ; while for two guineas a recollection may be
included of receiving an Eccles cake from MATTHEW ARNOLD.

SECTION II.-YoUNG MANHOOD.
In this section clients are “influenced by Political Move-
ments,” and “come under the sway of Magnetic Individuali-
ties.” Preference for any particular individuality should be
stated.
SPECIAL OFFER.
For a small extra charge we provide clients not only with a
recollection of DickFNs, but with a proof that they are actually
the original of any favourite character in the novelist's works.
SECTION III.-MIDDLE AGE AND AFTER.
This section is of somewhat different character from the
others. The serious difficulty has to be encountered, that if
recollections are written concerning living personages these
may take occasion to deny acquaintance with our clients.
Recollections in Section III. therefore avoid the mention of
names for “reasons that will be obvious" or “in the
interests of diplomacy—” as clients may elect.
Clients in this section may dine with “a Cabinet Minister
whose recent utterances have commanded wide attention,”
1|or motºr with “an ex-Irish Viceroy who was very communi-
cative,” etc., etc.
Finally we have to state that, though the above is our i
standard pattern volume of recollections, we are prepared to
supply a volume on any lines according to clients' require-
ments. We are, dear Sir or Madam,

MY TEAM.
IV.-IN THE FIELD.
It is, I consider, the duty of a captain
to consult the wishes of his team now
and then, particularly when he is in
command of such a heterogeneous col-
lection of the professions as I was. I
was watching a match at the Oval the
other day, and at the end of an over
LEES went up to DALMENY and had a few
words with him. Probably, I thought,
he is telling him a good story that he
heard at lunch ; or, may be, he is asking
for the latest gossip from the Lobby.
My neighbour, however, held other
views.
“There,” he said, “there's ole WALTER
LEEs asking to be took off.”
“Surely not,” I answered. “DALMENY
had a telegram just now, and LEEs is
asking if it's the 3.30 winner.”
LEES then began to bowl again.
“There you are,” I said triumphantly;
but my neighbour wouldn't hear of it.
“Old LEEs asked to be took off, and
ole DALMENY " (I forget how he pro-
nounced it, but I know it was one of the
wrong ways) “ole DALMENY told him
he'd i. to stick on a bit.”
Now that made a great impression on
me, and I agreed with my friend that
DALMENY was in the wrong.
“When I am captaining a team,” I
said, “and one of the bowlers wants to
come off, I am always ready to meet him
half-way, more than half-way. Better
than that, if I have resolved upon any
course of action, I always let my team
know beforehand; and I listen to their
objections in a fair-minded spirit.”
It was in accordance with this rule of
mine that I said casually, as we were
changing, “If we win the toss I shall
put them in.”
There was a chorus of protest.
“That's right, go it,” I said. “HENRY
objects because, as a first-class cricketer,
he is afraid of what The Daily Chronicle
will say if we lose. The Editor naturally
objects—it ruins his chance of being
mistaken for a county player if he has to
field first. Bolton objects because heavy
exercise on a hot day spoils his lunch.
Thompson objects because that's the way
he earns his living at the Bar. His
objection is merely technical, and is
reserved as a point of law for the Court
of Crown Cases Reserved. MARKHAM is
a Socialist, and objects to Authority.
Also he knows he's got to field long-leg
both ends. GERALD--”
“But why?” said HENRY.
“Because I want you all to see the
wicket first. Then you can't say you
weren't warned.” Whereupon I went
out and lost the toss.
As we walked into the field the Editor
told me a very funny story. I cannot
repeat it here for various reasons. First,
it has nothing to do with cricket; and
secondly, it is, I understand, coming out
in his next number, and I should pro-
bably get into trouble. Also it is highly
technical, and depends largely for its
success upon adequate facial expression.
But it amused me a good deal. Just as
he got to the exciting part, THOMPSON
came up. -
“Do you mind if I go cover ?” he
asked.
“Do,” I said abstractedly. “And
“Well, you
what did the Vicar say?”
The Editor chuckled.

that—”
“Cover, I suppose,” said GERALD, as
he caught us up.
“What? Oh yes, please.
did know, did he?”
“Oh, the Vicar knew. That's really
the whole point.”
I shouted with laughter.
“Good, isn't it?” said the Editor.
“Well, then—”
“Have you got a cover?” came
MARKHAM's voice from behind us.
I turned round.
“Oh, MARKHAM,” I said, “I shali
want you cover, if you don't mind.
Sorry—I must tell these men where
to go–well, then, you were saying—”
The Editor continued the story. We
were interrupted once or twice, but he
finished it just as their first two men
came out. I particularly liked that bit
about the -
“Jove,” I said suddenly, “we haven't
got a wicket-keeper. That's always
the way. Can you keep ’’’ I asked the
Editor.
“Isn't there anyone else?”
“I'm afraid they're all fielding cover,”
I said, remembering suddenly. “But,
look here, it's the chance of a lifetime
for you. You can tell 'em all that—”
But he was trotting off to the pavilion.
“Can anybody lend me some gloves?”
he asked. “They want me to keep
wicket. Thing I've never done in my
life. Of course I always field cover in
the ordinary way. Thanks awfully.
Sure you don't mind 2 Don't suppose I
shall stop a ball though.”
“HENRY,” I called, “you're starting
that end. Arrange the field, will you?
I'll go cover. You're sure to want
one.”
Their first batsman was an old
weather-beaten villager called GEORGE.
We knew his name was GEORGE, because
the second ball struck him in the
stomach, and his partner said, “Stay
there, GEORGE,” which seemed to be
GEORGE's idea too. We learnt at lunch
that once (in the eighties or so) he had
gone in first with Lord HAWKE (which
put him on a level with that player), and
that he had taken first ball (which put
him just above the Yorkshireman).
The Vicar
There the story ended, so far as GEORGE
was concerned ; and, indeed, it was
enough. Why seek to inquire if GEORGE
took any other balls besides the first?
In our match, however, he took the
second in the place that I mentioned,
the third on the back of the neck, the
fourth on the elbow, and the fifth in
the original place; while the sixth,
being off the wicket, was left there.
Nearly every batsman has some pet
stroke, and we soon saw that GEORGE's
stroke was the leg-bye. His bat was
the second line of defence, and was kept
well in the block. If the ball escaped
the earthwork in front, there was always
a chance that it would be brought up
by the bat. Once, indeed, a splendid
ball of HENRY's, which came with his
arm and missed GEORGE's legs, snicked
the bat, and went straight into the
wicket-keeper's hands. The Editor,
however, presented his compliments, and
regretted that he was unable to accept
the enclosed, which he accordingly re-
turned with many thanks. -
There was an unwritten law that
GEORGE could not be l.b.w. I cannot
say how it arose – possibly from a natural
coyness on GEORGE's part at the exact
significance of the “l.” HENRY, after
appealing for the best part of three
overs, gave it up, and bowled what he
called “googlies” at him. This looked
more hopeful, because a googly seems
to be in no way restricted as to the
number of its bounces, and at each
bounce it had a chance of doing some-
thing. Unfortunately it never did
GEORGE. Lunch came and the score
was 37 – GEORGE having compiled in
two hours a masterly 19; 18 off the
person, but none the less directly due
to him.
“We must think of a plan of campaign
at lunch,” said HENRY. “It's hopeless
to go on like this.”
“Does GEORGE drink 2 ” I asked
anxiously. It seemed the only chance.
But GEORGE didn't. And the score
was 37 for five which is a good score
for the wicket.
A RIVERSIDE REGRET.

With tiny hands in dainty style,
Inconsequently chatting while
We slowly move towards our goal.
When PHYLLIS punts, I long to lie
And idly watch her laughing face,
For seldom does such lissom grace
As hers delight a lover's eye.
But what with thrusting skiffs aside,
Entreating pardons by the score,
And pushing off from either shore—
I'm far too fully occupied

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GARDEN PARTY AMUSEMENTS.
(A little in the helpful Carmelite manner)
“It is one thing,” said, the other day,
a well-known hostess, famous for her
witty mots, “to get your guests to a
garden party, but to keep them glad
they came is quite another pair of
shoes.” And how true this is, many
another and less gifted hostess can tell,
whose unhappy lot it has been to see
her friends disappear after merely
shaking her hand and eating the straw-
berries. “I don't believe,” said one of
these ladies whose observation was not
less keen than that of her sister enter-
tainers, but who lacked her gift of
epigram, “I don't believe they (her
guests) care about me at all: all they
want is to be fed and amused.” It
therefore behoves hostesses who would
be popular to multiply diversions as
much as possible, and we are happy to
be able to offer some useful suggestions.
Our first rule would be: Forget that
it is a garden party at all. Think of it
as an ordinary party in your drawing-
room and behave accordingly. That is
to say, have the same games that you
would have there. If you would have
“Hunt the Slipper” indoors, have it out
too. Put Bridge tables under the trees.
Have the Billiard table carried out to the
rosery. Let there be Draughts by the
cedar and Chess in the arbour. Give
up the summer-houses to Backgammon.
Spread the illustrated papers about the
pergola. Hang engravings on the rose
bushes. Let there be pianos under the
deodar.
Above all be sure to have plenty of
paper and pencils, for writing games
are invaluable at garden parties, and
let the prizes be valuable. You cannot
spend too much money on prizes. Here
is a typical garden-party game:-Bags
of different scents are strung upon a
rope at a little distance apart and hoisted
between two posts. The bags should
be filled with perfumes, herbs, and con-
diments of various kinds, such as violet
powder, rose, cloves, musk, ginger,
pepper, camphor, naphthaline, and
odours more difficult to recognise, such
as oranges and lemons, nutmeg, &c.
Great care must be taken not to use
flowers or anything that really has to
do with a garden; your guests would
not like this. They want exotic artificial
scents. Each little bag is numbered,
and pieces of paper and pencils are dealt
out to the competitors, who, after smell-
ing at the respective bags, write down
the names of the scents opposite the
numbers shown on the bags. Though
many enter this contest with a very light
heart certain of a prize, it is amazing
how few are able to fill in the list
correctly. Still, for fear of unpopularity,
Nurse (to fond mother of celebrated musical prodigy). “PLEASE, MUM, is MASTER WILLY To
'Ave 'Is MoRNING sleep, or go on wiv 'Is SixTEENTh SympherNY 2’’
prizes being not of the best kind but
still valuable—not diamonds perhaps,
but at least pearls.
For the few persons who dislike
indoor games, even indoors, and loathe
them in the open air, there are plenty of
things to do, provided the hostess is
willing (as of course she should be) to
sacrifice everything to her guests' amuse-
ments. Pergola chopping, for example.
This is a splendid game. All that is
wanted is a number of axes—as many as
there are posts in the pergola. These
are distributed among the guests, and at
a given signal they begin to chop. A
prize—a diamond tiara or gold cigar-case
—should be awarded to the chopper who
cuts through quickest. Of course the
pergola will be ruined and probably the
roses on it too; but what of that? The
it is well to have prizes for all, the booby
country-side has to be pleased at any price.
“Tarquin" is not a bad game. Each
guest is provided with a military cane
and told to run down the beds, swishing
at the heads of the flowers on his way.
The fallen heads are then counted, and
the pearl necklace or silver tantalus
goes to the greatest of the decapitators.
Another excellent pastime is catching
the gold fish, and another throwing
tennis balls at the conservatory—each
guest being given six balls and told
to break if possible six separate panes
with them. Few games are entered
into with more spirit by the young.
The only drawback to these games is
the subsequent interview with the
gardener; but if you have a motor-
car and a London house this can be
avoided, while a mere ordinary headache
will postpone it with certainty for a
SeaSOIl.

CHARIVARIA.
HERR BALLIN, the managing director
of the Hamburg-American Line, is men-
tioned as the possible successor of
Prince Bülow as ‘Imperial Chancellor.
Our C.-B. on the other hand has not
even had any experience with the L.C.C.
StealmerS.
It is rumoured that after the Vacation
a much needed legal reform will be
inaugurated. The Courts are to sit half-
an-hour earlier to enable the judges to
crack jokes and to reply to adverse
criticisms without trenching on the time
which belongs to the Public.
With reference to the proposed aboli-
tion of the office of public executioner in
France, it is denied that, if the Senate
sanctions the proposal, M. DEiBLER in-
tends to continue to carry on the business
privately.
In the mixed swimming race down
the Seine the Englishman JARwis was
an easy winner. His victory, we hear,
was to some extent due to the fact that
with true British stolidity, he refused
to flirt during the race.
Our policemen are such an excep-
tionally handsome body of men that it
is only right that they should be pro-
tected from a form of annoyance to
which they are peculiarly liable. We
were therefore pleased to see that at
the Tower Bridge Police Court a fine of
2s. 6d. was imposed on somebody for
kissing a constable during the recent
dry and hot weather.
“If you are a commercial traveller or
a salesman,” writes Mr. PETER KEARY in
Pearson's Weekly, “it is a good thing
not only to cultivate a cheerful spirit,
but to be a good and ready story-teller.”
Hard things have been said about
commercial morality before this, but we
have never yet heard the thing put
quite so bluntly.
A proposal to introduce ozone, electri-
cally produced, into the sewers with a
view to purifying the atmosphere, is
being considered by the Greenwich
Borough Council. If the experiment be
successful, it is possible that the City
and South London Tube may adopt the
idea. - -
Undertaking to live for twenty-one
days on tinned meat, a man residing at
Harrow has offered himself to Messrs.
ARMotºr for exhibition in London. The
sting is in the shortness of the period.
A Swedish scientist has succeeded
in producing a soluble dry milk. If
sufficient water be added to the powder
it is impossible to distinguish the result
from the ordinary London variety.
We had hoped that pin-curls for men
were doomed, but we read that the silk
hat for the autumn will have a brim
with a fair, although not excessive,
amount of curl. --
The mention of fashions reminds us
that some new fancy ducks are now to
be seen at the Zoo.
Our Dumb Friends' League, we hear,
has more ladies than men among its
supporters. This is not remarkable.
The terrible affliction of dumbness is,
of course, one especially calculated to
appeal to feminine sympathy.
The hundredth performance of The
Girl Behind the Counter was received
with cheers. Curiously enough there
were no counter cheers.
The advent of a gearless motor-
omnibus is announced. But what is
needed, we fancy, is a jeerless one.
“‘Union Jack,' are yer?” growled a
cabby the other day as one of a well-
known brand passed him, “Yer smells
more like a Onion Jack' "
It is rumoured that Professor RAY
LANKESTER will shortly be retired from his
position at the Natural History Museum
on the score of age. This is absurd,
seeing that the Diplodocus is allowed to
remain on in the same building.
A pupil of Oundle School has climbed
to the top of the local church spire, and
tied his handkerchief to the weather
vane. It is astonishing the aversion
some boys have to handkerchiefs.
The caterpillar nuisance is spreading.
According to The Erpress a boa-con-

into a compartment of a Great Western
corridor express last week. .
The Boers have won the South African
war after all. The concluding volume
of the Official History can row appear.
Miss MARIE CORELL has written to the

over one of England's fairest counties,
but does not specify which county.

OMNIBUS INTERLUDES.
IV.-The MESSENGER Boy.
FROM my seat I have an excellent view
of him.
He is a cherubic little person; one of
the type that might have sat to a latter-
day PRAXITELEs for a new statue of Eros.
As a matter of fact, he is in the service
of the District Messenger Company;
and notwithstanding his fourteen years
an the rakish angle at which his
“ pork-pie” cap is set, a look of innocent
blitheness dwells in his eyes.
It is accordingly with a mild shock of
disillusionment that I watch him pro-
duce from the inner regions of his tunic
a much-folded brochure entitled – if I
discern aright – Dare-Decil Dick, or,
The Bandits of the Bone-Strewn Cañon.
He has become absorbed in this romance
when, shortly after leaving Chancery
Lane, the conductor comes to collect new
fares. The conductor's manner suggests
Weltschmerz; his conversation inclines
to the vitriolic; and when he fixes the
messenger boy with a sombre glare, I
thrill with a sense of impending conflict.
“’Ere, he remarks, “you oughter
'ave got orf at Chancery Lane !”
“No fear,” protests the cherub; “I
took a ticket to Charing Cross.”
The conductor gives a withering
glance, and reviews their transaction
with a kind of weary succinctness.
“You gave me a penny fare,” he retorts,
“and a penny fare from Liverpool Street
takes yer to Chancery Lane. You know
that well enough, so come orf of it.”
“But I took a tuppenny ticket,”
rejoins the cherub.
“Let's see it, then " '' exclaims the
conductor, with an incredulity which he
makes no attempt to conceal.
“You can't 'ave it: it's no good
now,” replies the cherub, flushing with
embarrassment.
“Lost it, of course?”
“No, I ain't' " replies the cherub.
“Well, let's see it, I tell yer; an' not
so much lip about it!”
Reluctantly the cherub withdraws from
his mouth a pellet of pulp, which he
exhibits on his finger. The conductor
eyes it with grim contempt. At this
juncture, my neighbour—a ponderous
man in charge of a motor-tyre-leans
forward and touches the conductor's arm.
“The boy's or right, guv'nor,” he
generously explains: “tell yer why.
Them tuppenny tickets is blue, ain't
they 2"
“An' what if they are 2" demands the
conductor.
“An' the pennyuns is white?”
“Well, what of it?”
“Well,” concludes my neighbour,
“allowin' that some o' the colour's come
out in the wash, that bit o' stuff's blue.

WEIRD COINCIDENCES AND UNIQUITIES.
(With acknowledgments to the London Letterwrriter of the “Westminster.”)
The Marquess of BROADSTAIRs is reported to be slowly
recovering from the effects of his motor accident. Barely five
hundred yards from the precise spot at which the car
capsized stood in all probability—such is the irony of fate 1–
the residence of his maternal grandfather, once an unsuc-
cessful suitor for the hand of ſº BLENKINsop, née ALICE
BRitchin, daughter of Sir Robert BRITCHIN, coachbuilder to the
fourth GEORGE.
The newly-appointed Bishop of DUNSTABLE, whose weakness
for cockatoos is well known, succeeds, oddly enough, a prelate
who had a similar penchant for Japanese rats.
Truth is stranger than fiction. Mr. HUMMUNHAR, who
succeeds Mr. Plodd at the South Central Police Court, was
educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton; his predecessor was
for many years a struggling solicitor at Ilfracombe, in the
same county. But the cream of the jest is to come. Mr.
HUMMUNHAR is an old Peterhouse man. From Peterhouse no
great strength would be required to lodge a biscuit within
the walls of Pembroke. Will it be believed that the outgoing
magistrate was once a Pembroke don 2
The regrettable absence of Canon X. from the meeting held
two days since by the S.P.C.Z. was due, we are credibly
informed, to his missing the 2.15 from Clapham to Victoria.
We scarcely hope to gain credence when we state that this
identical train was successfully caught by another Church
dignitary of almost equal eminence.
The election of Dr. HASLUck to the Mastership of Boniface
has its whimsical side. Not only is he the youngest head of
a college, with but two exceptions, but the name of one of his
rivals in this respect begins, like that of Dr. HASLUCK, with
the letter H : while there are at Boniface no fewer than two
other dons whose names commence with the same initial'
Mr. LoNGough, the famous cricketer, had yesterday the
unique experience of lunching with an ex-Secretary of State
whose niece lately became the wife of an ex-champion of golf,
while the lady herself (if report lies not) has frequently taken

How many rising authors can boast, with Mr. KITTs, the
happiness of leading to the altar, just seven years and thirteen
days after the publication of her former husband's post-
humous poems, the relict (herself no contemptible littératrice,
and second cousin to perhaps the ablest controversial
theologian of the past century) of one of the few modern poets
to whom we are able to accord this title without the prefix
“minor?” Perhaps not one.
THE DEVOUT LOVER.
(After Mr. Walter H. Pollock.)
It is not mine to sing with stately grace

Not mine with rippling harmonies to win
Her favour when she plays the violin;

I turn the pages
I turn the pages, trembling lest I'm wrong.
I cannot play, nor strum out tum-ti-tum
On the banjo, or the harmonium;
But when her mother
But when her mother helps her through her song,
I turn the pages
I turn the pages, trembling lest I’m wrong.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from The DiARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 30.
—As REDMond aimé said just now, prefa-
tory to making a long speech on third
reading of Education Bill, the debate
was a waste of time, akin to beating
the air. Whatever had to be said had been
reiterated through long dreary nights
since the Bill came in with other flowers
of the spring. WALTER LONG, put up to
move rejection of measure at this final
stage, gallantly did his best. Next to
him lounged PRINCE ARTHUR, grown grey
in the fight. Sisyphus of the Opposi-
tion, he has nightly been engaged in Ready
assisting to roll up amendments to top nunciation of ap-

Irish Nationalists joining full muster
of their forces with Unionists, the third
reading of the Bill was carried by a
majority of 192. That is in excess of
the state of things established at General
Election, when majority of Liberal and
Labour Members over Unionists and
Nationalists worked out at 190.
Though WALTER Long's fervid speech
did not affect Division List it had per-
sonal effect in another quarter which
testifies to its power. When he rose, a
burly figure sat in corner of back bench

and countenance of the Unknown over

(Mr. B-rr-ll has a final brilliant fling on the Third Reading.)
his emotion, yearning for silent com-
munion with himself, the visitor rose
to leave. To his right was the crowd
filling the specially reserved section of
the Gallery; to his left the Peers'
benches occupied by a solitary Baron ;
between him and it stood a wooden
partition some four feet high. Striding
across this the burly Commoner entered
the sacred pen of the Peers, making
for the door at the other end.
For a moment the messenger on
guard was paralysed. CROMwFLL enter-
ing the House with his men-at-arms
was in the matter of sacrilege nothing
to this. Happily recovering from his
fright the messenger was able to rise
to his feet, and with both arms out-
stretched barred the way. The stranger
showed disposition to argue the matter.
Reinforcements coming up he turned
and sauntered back again. Cocking
his leg over the barrier he re-entered
common ground and disappeared by
the Strangers' exit, leaving behind him
no name and a mystery.
Business done.- Education Bill read
a third time by 369 votes against 177.
Tuesday.-Interesting to note how,
occasionally, the great families that are
good enough to govern us are divided
on critical issues of state policy. The
unity that should have made the strength
of the Hotel Cecil was fractured by di-
versity of opinion between PRINCE ARTHUR
and Cousin Hugh on the Tariff question.
Now Blenheim is riven to the roof by
dissension between the head of the House
and its most brilliant scion in matter of
Transvaal Constitution. In the Com-
mons WINSTON, by masterly speech, de-
scribed and recommended the new
scheme. In the Lords Malbrook s'en va
t’en guerre, the object of attack being
the masterpiece of statecraft of which
his cherished cousin is the Ministerial
advocate.
On the whole, regarded from literary
standpoint as a bit of effective debating,
the cadet exceeded in merit the head of
the House. The DUKE takes himself far
too seriously. Addresses High Court of
Parliament as if he were standing to be
photographed with Blenheim in the
background. The Lords are less suscep-
tible than the Commons to adventitious
advantage inherited by birth. Still,
even the lowliest Baron amongst them
isn't overawed by a Duke. MALBRook, a
boy of parts, will get over that in time.
He might forth with dispense with
habit, marked to-night by ludicrous
iteration, of bringing his open hand
down on blue book with resounding
bang. It happened to come just where
he thought he was making a point,
and as the noise of the collision drowned
his voice at the critical moment there
was no variety in a generally pointless
harangue.
Business done. —New Transvaal Con-
stitution simultaneously introduced to
Lords and Commons.
Thursday.-In Smoke Room and else-
where Members reading with keen in-
terest White Paper circulated to-day
purporting to be “Report by High Com-
missioner of South Africa on his visit
to Basutoland and the Bechuanaland
Protectorate.” There is, truly, a brief
introductory note by Lord SELBORNE.
Chief contents of Paper are copies of
addresses from native tribes to the
High Commissioner, supplemented by
picturesque description of his journey-
ing culled from local journals.
Here is a snapshot taken at the Great
Bamangwato Gathering in KHAMA's
country.
“Lord SELBORNE, who wore a flannel
suit, a soft shirt, and a Panama hat, had
KHAMA on his left hand, the chief being
attired in correct European costume and
carrying a beautifully carved ivory stick.”
What is even more interesting is an
incident arising out of Lord SELBORNE's
visit to Basutoland. As a newspaper
extract quoted in the White Paper
records: “The High Commissioner was
received by LETSIE, the paramount chief,
wearing a grey suit, double collar, black
tie, and Panama hat . . . In the course
of the speechmaking LETsIE observed
he felt frightened to take up the blanket
of his father. He did not know how he
would carry it, for he was a child and
a stripling.”
According to SARK this chance remark
caused a flood of emotion to overpower
Lord SELDoRNE, to the marked surprise
of chiefs and natives. In a far-off land,
exiled from his country, brilliantly serving
its interests, there flashed upon him a
familiar scene in the House of Commons
with his old friend and chief, still Premier,
addressing a thronged assembly.
“I am a child in these matters,” said
PRINCE ARTHUR on historical occasion,
throwing out slim hands with depreca-
tory movement.
“I am a child and a stripling,” said
the Paramount Chief of Basutoland,
conscious of the fetching attraction of
a grey suit, double collar and black tie.
The incident shows how small the
world is, and how one touch of nature
makes great chiefs kin.
Business done. — Appropriation Bill
read a second time.
Saturday.-Parliament adjourned for
autumn holiday. Meet again October
23, when business of Education Bill will
actually begin.

According to The Daily Telegraph
Mr. PERKs, M.P. has said that “the
Channel Tunnel was not so much a
thing in the air as it was a few years
ago.” Mr. PERRs does not seem to
distinguish clearly between a tunnel
and a bird.

MR. PUNCH'S CURIO COLUMN.
[Free advice through this column will be
given to all connoisseurs. It is particularly
requested that collectors sending furniture,
grandfathers' clocks, and mummies for expert
examination should not omit to prepay the
carriage.]
Puzzled (BALHAM).-I should scarcely
recommend you to purchase the violin
which the dealer describes to you as a
genuine piece of old Chippendale. Per-
haps “Chippendale" was a slip of the
tongue for “Stradivarius.” If so my
advice is unaltered.
ANxious (BIRMINGHAM). It is difficult
to place a value on collections of political
speeches. The only way is to submit
them to the ordeal of the auction-room.
Roughly speaking, I should iudge your
collection of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's speeches
on Old Age Pensions to be worth about 2d.
Skii LY (WhitechAPEL). — From your
crude sketch and description I should
esteem the diamond tiara to be worth
about £15,000. I should certainly re-
fuse the dealer's offer of 3s. 6d. and a
pair of boots unless you are quite sure
that otherwise he will carry out his
threat of informing the police.
PROFEssoR (DURHAM).--The copper coin
you submit was not, as you imagine,
struck in the reign of CALIGULA. After
investigation with a strong magnifying
glass it appears to be a late Victorian
penny-date 1887 or 1889, though there
is a doubt about the last figure. Its
approximate value is about one twelfth
of a shilling. I cannot say whether the
British Museum possesses an example.
CoNFIDENT (SHEPHERD's Bush).-If, as
you say, you possess an early copy of
The Daily Mail which contains an
apology for a misstatement in a previous
issue, you have undoubtedly a curio of
immense value. But I am inclined to
think that you have been hoaxed by
some audacious forger.
CURIOUS (SHEFFIELD). You are cer-
tainly to be congratulated on your col-
lection. If your elastic side-boot, the
traditional property of King HENRY THE
EIGHTH, and your portrait of Dr. Jo HNSON
with WANDYKE's signature were put up
for sale at CHRISTIE's they might fetch
from 9d. to £40. Much depends on
the state of wear of the elastic side-boot,
and the condition of the picture's frame.
Personally I incline towards the first-
mentioned figure.
ACCORDING to The Scotsman, Sir HENRY
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN “has a special pet
of his own in a parrot which he bought
when a young bird in the streets of
London shortly after he entered Parlia-
ment.” “A young bird” is surely
rather a familiar way of referring to the
PREMIER.
Later on The Scotsman says: “She
talks a little, but Sir HENRY has a great
opinion of her discretion.” We hope it
is reciprocated.

THE DOGS OF WAR.
(By the Author of “A Dog Day.")
II.
THE CAPTAIN MAKES A Dog of ME.
THE seeds were now sown of a friend-
ship which was only ended by the
grave. My meeting with the Captain
was the beginning of a new era in my
life – or rather, I should say, the begin-
ning of my life. Almost from the first,
when I was in the Captain's company,
the streets ceased to have any terrors
for me, and the day came ultimately
when not only did I not fear any man,
dog, or thing in the world, but when
most men and all dogs and things
feared me. Of course this came gradu-
ally. At first, not even cats ran away
from me. Then, to my delight —which
seems childish to me now-one windy
day a number of leaves in the road
took to flight when they saw me. Then
birds, then cats. And at length -a dog'
I have even barked defiantly at a
whole troop of mounted soldiery, any
one of whom could have run me through
or shot me, had he possessed the
necessary pluck.
I was now constantly in the Captain's
company, and, when I think of it, how
good and noble of him it was for a dog
in his position to consort with one who,
after all, at that time was a mere ignorant
yokel—a bumpkin' Never, I realised,
could I repay what I owed him, though I
should try to do so by a life-long devotion.
He put me on my legs. He showed me
about town. But for him, I, a simple
countryman, would have been victimised
one hundred times, for the Cockneys
are a sharp race.
When I thanked him, he merely said,
“I have taken a fancy to you, Ears ”-
for that was the nickname he gave me.
I soon discovered that the Captain
was a dog of immense influence, and
the effect of his friendship was instanta-
neous. When I first came to town,
the natives cold-shouldered me. As
soon as it was noticed how much I was
with the Captain, a marked change took
place. Innumerable little dogs now
paid me court-kow-towed to me—as
being a favourite of the Captain. It
was all most pleasant.
Every morning before breakfast I
would run round to the Captain's, and
have a romp with him in the big garden
at the back of his house, where dogs
were forbidden. And nearly every day,
in addition to this, we would go for a
long walk together, for the Captain
impressed on me the importance of
taking plenty of exercise to keep oneself
in condition. Sometimes I would call
for him, and sometimes he for me. It
was characteristic of the Captain that,
although I lived in a smaller house than
he, he was superior to all silly social
restrictions—so different from a con-
ceited beast of a greyhound whom, in
my early days, I once invited to call, and
who answered, “Thanks, old fellow, but
I do not slum.”
I shall never forget how excited I was
:
-
5 -
“Thanks, old fellow, but I do not slum."
the first time the Captain came to my
place and ate some of my biscuits. I
think that if my people had tried to turn
him out I would have strewn the house
with their corpses.
Some days, when it was raining, my
people would keep me in, and then I
would sit looking out of the window,
and as likely as not the Captain would
trot down for me, and them, on catching
sight of him, I would set up such a
barking and a frisking that for the sake
of peace thank Heaven, my master used
to suffer from neuralgia' -I would soon
be let out. And frequently at night-
time the Captain and I would go cat-
scaring together. -
The Captain was the most entertaining
of companions, for he was so wonderfully
well informed. He knew all about every-
thing. His astonishing accumulation of
knowledge was mainly due, he told me,
to a habit his mistress had of reading
out the most interesting items from the
newspaper at breakfast to the rest of the
family. The Captain would always
listen attentively—in which respect, by
the way, he was more polite than the
others. Thus it came about that there
was nothing you could ask the Captain
which he could not answer. He knew
all the big words, and I still remember
my delight when he told me I was a
“Quadruped,” for I had had no idea
that I was anything so important. Half-
an-hour's conversation with the Captain
was a liberal education in itself, and
whatever I have of polish and choice of
diction, I owe to the Captain.
The effect on me was most remarkable.
In a very short time you would not
have recognised in me the timid creature
of yesterday. Once my master dared to
raise his hand against the Captain
because he scratched the front-door–
rightly enough, by-the-by, as the servant
had kept him waiting for upwards of
five minutes. When I saw my master
catch hold of the Captain, at first I could
hardly believe my eyes. To say the
least, it was a disgraceful breach of
hospitality. Then my anger knew no
bounds, and I growled furiously; and it
was only a restraining look from the
Captain which prevented me biting my
master all over. To the Captain's
generous views as regards humans I
shall refer later. After this incident the
Captain, who was always dignified, kept
away from the house for a month ; and
serve my master jolly well right!
THE CAPTAIN CONFERs on ME A CoveTED
DISTINCTION.
The Captain was not slow to mark
the change in me, and, eight weeks
after my first meeting him, he made
me a member of his Club.
THE Dogs of WAR.
This was the greatest distinction that
He found him so big that he decided that the insult was not intentional.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
could be conferred upon a dog. My
gratitude knew no bounds; but all that
the Captain said in reply to my pro-
testations was, “I like you, Ears.”
It was the most famous Dogs' Club in
the world. I need scarcely say that I
refer to “The Dogs of War”—known to
our rivals as “The Mongrelians,” “The
Hooligans,” “The Gargoyles,” and other
sobriquets as insulting as they are
stupid. This Club, as is well known, was
founded by the Captain as a monument
to his mother. The Captain's mother,
it will be remembered, made a love-
match. She was considered, however,
to have married out of the pale, was
cut by all thorough-breeds, and fretted
herself to death.
To avenge this heartless piece of
snobbery, The Dogs of War was formed.
Its motto was “ fº not Defence,”
and all thorough-breeds giving them-
selves airs were to be attacked on sight.
The rules and regulations of the Club
were many, and I do not propose to set
them out at length. In all of them the
master-mind of the Captain was apparent.
Females and children were ineligible
for membership. A proposal to form a
junior branch was rightly rejected by
the Captain. As he pointed out, the
youngsters, with their constant infantile
ailments, would be more bother than
they were worth. And, unless a special
dispensation—the word is the Captain's
- were obtained, the members must
remain bachelors. And no black dogs
were admitted; the line was drawn at
coloured gentlemen.
The Captain alone chose the members.
If a likely young fellow applied to him,
or were introduced by a member, the
Captain would place the candidate on
probation for a month. During those
four weeks the Captain would receive
reports on its habits and customs, and
would personally test it in many ways.
For instance, he would meet one of the
little novices out with its mistress. The
Captain would beckon to it. The novice
would advance towards the Captain.
The mistress would call it back. The
Captain would beckon again. The novice
would once more run to the Captain.
The Captain would detain it for five
minutes, and say, “Now you may go
back.” It would get a beating from its
mistress. The Captain would meet the
same dog in similar circumstances the
next day, and, if then it did not come
at the first summons, the Captain would
let it know he had no use for it.
Nor did we have the rule of “Once a
member, always a member.” The Cap-
tain reserved to himself the right of
expulsion. It was the only way, he
explained, to keep us up to the mark.
9ne member was expelled, soon after I

of the Captain, but the Captain felt
he must make an example of him. He
was a small dog, known as “The Barrel”
from his shape. One day a Newfound-
lander, who came up suddenly behind
him, cried out, “Hello, here's one of
the dirty Mongrelians.” The Barrel
turned round and looked at the New-
foundlander, and found him so big
that he decided that the insult was not
intentional. The incident, however, was
reported, and The Barrel had to leave.
The Captain took an especially serious
view of the matter, as the insult was to the
Club and not to the member personally.
I used to see the outcast occasionally
afterwards, but, if he caught sight of one
of us, he would always slink away; and I
used to pity him, he looked so miserable.
Expulsion, too, used to take place
occasionally for slackness and dis-
obedience. Without obedience, the
Captain held, nothing was possible.
We were never to question his com-
mands. He was a stern disciplinarian,
and the message “The Captain wants
to speak to you " has made many a dog
tremble in his day. And with it all
the Captain was scrupulously just ; and
this, I think, was appreciated by the
members, and was perhaps the secret of
his marvellous influence over us. We
have seen how he would not spare even
his personal friend. His impartiality
was wonderful. I have even known

I Do not stretch probabilities too far when I suggest that
Mr. GEORGE MooRE, who has lately published Memoirs of My
Dead Life (HEINEMANN), became during that dead life familiar
with the memoirs of a certain notorious Venetian adventurer.
When this distinguished ornament of the eighteenth century
To make sure, you should keep the machinery oiled

In the Shadow (HEINEMANN) was evidently prepared for
the American market, where presumably its first appear-
ance was made. It is chiefly a study of the negro character,
its possibilities and limitations. Mr. Rowl AND selects as his type
the Haytian negro, perhaps the most favourably circumstanced
of the race. Dessalines, son of a wealthy father, was educated
at Oxford, where, in spite of his colour, he made many friends,
a circumstance incomprehensible to the Americans who figure
in the story. He conceived the idea of making himself
Emperor of his native island. Descending upon Hayti with
had passed the age of three
score years and ten, he sat
down to relieve his mind and
mitigate the wretchedness of
his condition by committing
to paper the adventures, the
intrigues, the scandals, the
successes and the failures of
which his life had been full.
Old and decrepit, he dwelt
with a peculiar gusto on
those scenes of his variegated
existence in which women had
played a part, and did not
hesitate for his own satisfac-
tion to embroider and enlarge
infamous adventures that fate
had thrown in his way. So
Mr. MooRE, when he recalls
his life, does not fail to show
how gallant and determined
and unconquerable he was
whenever a petticoat crossed
his path. No doubt the recol-
lections gave Mr. MooRE plea-
sure, but it is doubtful whe-
ther anyone else will care
much for them. There is plenty of pretty writing in the
book; there is a fine mixed haze of artistic sensibility and
semi-decadent enthusiasm for incidents and persons not in
themselves specially admirable. Mr. MooRE wishes us
to realise that he is an Irishman with a French soul and
a knack for aesthetic jargon. We have managed to realise
this, but we cannot say that the effort has given us any
particular satisfaction.

developed the latent imper-
ſections of the negro, “a
creature of impulse, shuttle-
cock of his emotions, lazy,
improvident, lacking in imagi-
nation, irrepressible, incom-
plete.” There is brisk move-
ment in the story. But I
fancy it will be found more
interesting on the other side
of the Atlantic, where, as Mr.
Rowl,AND grimly observes, “the
negro has a vote.” Which
seems very inconsiderate on
his part.
It is probable that if IBSEN
had not written plays The Bar
Sinister (BLAckwood) would
never have come before the
British public. Mr. MoRGAN-
DE-GROOT has much of the
Master's simplicity of style,
his occasional triviality of
comment and illustration.
Nor does he shrink from
what, in less decorous language than the original Dutch,
might be described as coarseness of situation. This is illus-
trated in the wooing on the river, where the wicked brother
Rudolf insists upon the betrothed of the good brother Paul
marrying him. The story is specially interesting as admitting
the foreigner to the intimacy of fresh sidelights on Flemish
interiors.
Mr. HoRACE G. HUTCHINSON is as pleasant a writer as one
can wish to meet. He can make even the dry bones of
golf live, and can chat delightfully about fishing, shooting,
and the cie en plein air. His Amelia and the Doctor (SMITH,
ELDER) is a most agreeable story, excellently well conceived
and capitally constructed. But Mr. HUTChiNSON ought not
even in an off moment to palter with grammar. When he
says “neither of these two . . . . were the kind of men whom
you could press with questions” he defies LINDLEY MURRAY
and must take the consequences.
The Field, in a report of a recent county match, says: “At
96 HUBBLE brought the 100 on the board.” No wonder the
public is said to be losing its passion for county cricket if the
umpires allow this sort of thing to go on.

SILLY SEASONINGS.
[The usual correspondence relating to the
holidays is now due in the daily papers. The
following may be expected :]

SIR,-Now that the holiday-season is
in full swing, may I most solemnly warn
against sea-bathing all those of your
readers who are spending their vacation
on the coast” It has at last been dis-
covered that the enormous mortality
which annually occurs amongst those
recently returned from a holiday by the
sea is due to the fact that, while bathing,
minute particles of salt enter the pores
of these unfortunate persons, causing
clogging of the functions of the skin and
subsequent death. It is calculated that
at every immersion four ounces of solid
rock-salt are absorbed by the epidermis.

the hope that you, Sir, will raise your

touch of bitter irony, I may term the
common objects of the seashore? I
refer, Sir, to the young women (ladies
they cannot be) who at all hours of the
morning may be seen romping in the
surf, clad in bathing-dresses which are
in the highest degree indelicate and
offensive. These garments are gaudy
in colour, thin in texture, quite un-
necessary frills adorn their terminations
at the arms and lower extremities, and,
when wet, they cling to the form in a
manner eminently abhorrent. Last sum-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHO KILLED THE SACRED GAT 7
THE creators of Amasis have flown very
bravely in the face of convention. For,
firstly, there are only two of them instead
of the usual half dozen, with their “addi-
tional lyrics,” superfluous numbers, &c.
Secondly, the word “girl” does not
appear in the title, nor has the alterna-
tive of a Japanese setting been adopted.
Thirdly—a very daring innovation—
their comic opera contains something
distinctly resembling a plot, with a
fairly logical sequence of ideas. All
this may explain why their work appears
at a theatre not usually associated with
comic opera, and at the very nadir of
the dull season. However, the counter
attraction of Cowes did not seem to affect
its success, and the Country Cousin, on
whose “vile body” the experiment was
made, applauded rapturously all that
she could understand.
Mr. FREDERICK FENN, the librettist, has
gone to Ancient Egypt for his novelty.
Prince Anhotep was about to marry
Amasis, daughter of the Pharaoh of the
day; but on the very eve of the wedding,
just as he was composing a sonnet to
his lady, the music of one of the Sacred
Cats had disturbed his train of thought,
and in a moment of rash anger he had
dropped a brick upon the beast and
killed it. The penalty for this offence
— immediate death, with or without
torture, according to the executioner's
taste—threatened to dislocate the wed-
ding arrangements; when forth from his
machine steps a god in the person of one
Cheiro—not a palmist, but a poor scribe
who spends his spare time chipping
hieroglyphs out of a canvas obelisk.
In his modest and unassertive way he
harbours a secret passion for the Prin-
cess, and is prepared to assume re-
sponsibility for the assassination of the
Sacred Cat, and die with lovely perjury
on his lips and the joy of sacrifice in
his heart.
Who killed the Cat?
“I,” said the Scribe,
“It was my little gibe;
I killed the Cat.”
The law, not being fastidious about
executing the actual criminal, so long
as somebody is put to death, gives Cheiro
the benefit of the doubt and condemns
him to die.
But Amhotep and Amasis are too well-
bred to take advantage of his gallantry,
and the lady in the nick of time recalls
an ancient local tradition by which a
criminal is reprieved if on his way to
execution he meets a pure and kindly
girl. She (Amasis) will undertake to
be that girl. The curious thing is that
this happy thought never occurred to
her at the time when the Prince's life
was at stake. However, it is just as
otherwise the last half of the play would
have been rendered nugatory.
I have pleasure in adding that the
law about somebody having to die when
Pharaoh . . . . Mr. Rutland Barrington.
a Sacred Cat is killed was duly honoured
by the death of the offensive Ptolemy,
who inadvertently perished by his own
chemical processes while in the act of
embalming the defunct Pussy.
There are merry moments in the play,
but I think that full advantage has not
been taken of the chances of harmless
profanity offered by the animal worship
of Ancient Egypt. I cannot help feel-
ing that a human Crocodile or a human
Cat might well have been introduced
on the stage. As it was, the only two
actors who got the full fun out of words
or by-play were Mr. LAURI DE FRECE (in
the manner of Mr. EDMUND PAYNE) and
Mr. RUTLAND BARRINGTON (in the manner
of Mr. RUTLAND BARRINGTON). The latter,
who did not make his appearance as
Pharaoh till well on in the second half,
was a most delectable object in his

flaming corkscrew curls. He sang and
chatted very pleasantly and naturally,
showing no sort of pedantry in his treat-
ment of the text, of which a copy was
kindly presented to me, with other first-
nighters, by the author.
Mr. Rol.AND CUNNINGHAM as Amhotep
contributed a fine virile figure—and
little else; and Mr. Nory AN SALMoND,
who was as tall as ever, seems to have
let his singing voice grow thinner.
Certainly he spoke much more sonorously
than he sang.
The vocal triumphs of the evening
fell to charming Miss RUTH VINCENT in
the title rôle, and Mr. Whitworth MrTTox
as Cheiro. Miss VINCENT's technique
was very far above the average of comic
opera; and Mr. MITToN has a voice made
for tender sentiment. Each of them
should be heard some day in more
ambitious work.
Mr. FARADAY's music served its modest
purpose admirably in the interpretation
of Mr. FENN's lyrics. These were not up to
the standard of Mr. GILBERT or Mr. ADRIAN
Ross, but they were better than panto-
mime doggrel. Like all but the very best
of his kind Mr. FENN is a chartered licen-
tiate in rhymes, but I cannot just now
recall a worse conjunction than his
“cruelly” rhymed with “demurely."
Samples of the ordinary cockney rhyme-
“Duma,” “humour”—occur, of course,
on almost every page. Why these things
should be tolerated in an opera libretto I
cannot say. The eye, it is true, is not
offended (unless you happen to be follow-
ing in the book), but the ear suffers an
enhanced torture from the singer's rolling
of his r's. However, a comic opera
audience has a toughish tympanum;
and I saw nobody wince.
Altogether, I think the author and
composer have given us an entertain-
ment that should last well over the
provincial season and possibly survive
the return of Society and the Higher
Criticism. . S.

THE LAW'S DELAYS.
[Mr. Justice GRANTHAM's recent series of
unparalleled adventures on his way to the
Leeds Law Courts seems to have set a fashion
in judicial excuses, if we may take the evidence
of the following reports.]
MR. JUSTICE LITTLEHAM, who did not
appear until two hours after he should
have done, and was then unrecognisable
in bandages, said he was sorry to be
late. If he might employ a venerable
cliché he would say it was through no
fault of his own, but a series of mis-
adventures on the way thither. Entering
a four-wheeler at his hotel, he had almost
immediately been run into by the leading
elephant of a passing circus procession,
both cab and beast sustaining severe
damage. His Lordship, unhurt, had
extricated himself from the débris and
borrowed a bicycle in the KING's name,
but chancing almost at once to run over a
hedgehog he incurred so many punctures
that further progress was impossible.
In default of other artificial means of
locomotion, in which, it is true, he was
beginning to lose faith, he walked, and
would have been only an hour or so late
had it not been for a bad banana-fall
that necessitated a visit to a surgeon.
(Applause in Court.)
Mr. Justice DALLY MORE, who did not
reach the courts until three days had
elapsed from the proper time of open-
ing, explained his absence by saying
that he had been spending the week-
end at Cowes, and on Monday morning
stepped, as he thought, on board the
steamer for Southampton. As it hap- |
pened, however, it was a gun-boat bound
for the Mediterranean, a mistake which
he did not discover until they were off
Grisnez. Immediately the commanding
officer was made aware of the error he
transferred his Lordship to a passing
homeward-bound vessel; and here he
was, &c., prepared to do his duty without
fear or favour ! (Sensation.)
Mr. Justice HEAVILIDs, who kept his
court waiting for more than five hours
last Wednesday, said that no doubt he
should have been there in time had he
not overslept himself. But he had
dreamed so vividly about an imaginary
murder case that the united efforts of
his valet, the butler, two footmen and
a chauffeur had failed to wake him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MARINE MARVELS.
THANKS to the courtesy of the pro-
prietors of our valued contemporary
The Dictator, we are enabled to print in
advance a selection from the letters which
will appear in next Saturday's issue on
the subject of the Strange Sea Monster
recently observed by Dr. A. J. BUTLER.
SIR,--Dr. BUTLER's strange experience
reminds me forcibly of an incident of
my salad days, unless indeed I should
call them “sallet days” in deference to
the orthography of The Times. It was
when I was still an undergraduate at
Balliol, and the incident occurred on
one of the rare occasions on which I
induced the late Master to take part in
a game of water-polo—then recently
introduced by my cousin Lord ALTRIN-
CHAM–om Port Meadow. The Master,
who rode a highly-trained Mexican
porpoise, had just executed a masterly
wing shot when a large freshwater cray-
fish, leaping out of the water, swooped
down on the eminent Grecian and
stung him severely in the triceps. We
were all paralysed by the sight, all
except my dear friend and kinsman
ALARIC TIMPERLEY-endeared to many
generations of Harrovians by the grace
of his manners and his finely chiselled
profile-who rushed to the rescue and
beat off the infuriated crustacean with his
Schenectady putter. The Master, as I
have recorded in my volume Jaws with
Geniuses, showed great presence of mind,
his only remark being, “I have always
disliked crayfish, and now I know the
reason.” ALARICTIMPERLEY, who received
the Royal Humane Society's medal for
his gallant rescue, subsequently married
my stepmother's niece, and while moun-
taineering in the Lebanon was kidnapped
by Druses and immured in a Mingrelian
phalamstery. He was, as Mr. GLADSTONE
once remarked to me, too rare a soul for
the mundane cockpit. Curiously enough
Mr. GLAISTONE never saw a game of
water-polo, though he was much inter-
ested in the Basque game of pelota on
the occasion of his visit to Biarritz.
I am, Sir, &c.,
LEMUEL LONG MIRE.
[We are delighted to print Mr. LONG-
MIRE's apt and interesting reminiscence.
Water-polo, especially in this weather, is
a splendid and refreshing exercise, and
we sincerely hope that Mr. HALDANE will
see his way to include it in the physical
curriculum of the Auxiliary Forces.—ED.
Dictator.]
SIR, -Dr. BUTLER's experience, though
remarkable, is not unparalleled. When
walking the other day on the Goodwin
Sands I saw a cormorant dart down and
remain glued to the spot. On coming
up to the bird I found that it had been
attracted by an open oyster, which had
closed with such rapidity and force
upon its beak that the bird was unable
to fly away. I took them both home
with me, and their skeletons now repose
in my private museum. I may add that
I have heard of a similar incident in
which a curlew was captured by a
cockle. I am, Sir, &c.,
LYULPH PhiBBs.
[We are delighted to print the im-
pressive narrative of so veracious a
correspondent as Mr. PhIBBs, whose
name is a sufficient guarantee for the
truth of his story. Personally we have
always had the greatest respect for the
“native worth " of oysters, and believe
that if they were included in the diet of
the Militia, they would be able to
go anywhere and do anything.—ED.
Dictator.]
SIR,--I am encouraged by the example
of Dr. A. J. BUTLER to forward you a
brief account of a strange animal friend-
ship that has come within my personal
knowledge. My eldest son recently
brought back from Eton a tortoise which
he had swapped for a camera. On the
day after his arrival he missed his pet,
and on instituting a search discovered
it in the pinetum in company with a
fine Bombay Duck which lives in a
neighbouring pond. Since then the
strangely assorted pair have been quite
inseparable. They go out for long
walks together, and more than once the
duck has taken the tortoise on its back
for a swim in the pond. I enclose a
coloured photograph of the pair, a copy
of which I have forwarded to Professor
RAY LANKESTER, and remain,
Yours faithfully, A. LEGGE PULLAR.
[It is a sincere pleasure to us to pub-
lish Mr. PULLAR's intensely interesting
and convincing story. We hope that
all Volunteers will profit by its lesson
and learn not merely to swim, but to
swim carrying something or somebody
on their backs. As we have always
insisted, the value of Auxiliary Forces is
doubled if and when they are amphibi-
ous.-E.D. Dictator.]
SIR,- Could not the strange sea
monster seen by Dr. A. J. BUTLER have
been a dwarf kraken, or possibly an
undersized clumbungus?
Yours faithfully, ANXIOUS INQUIRER.
[We are only too pleased to give all
publicity to our correspondent's in-
genious and plausible conjecture. Per-
sonally we have never seen a kraken,
but, if we mistake not, Mr. FRANK T.
BULLEN has actually witnessed a kraken
jamboree. Be that as it may, it is clear
that the possibilities of invasion and
therefore the value of our Home Defence
Army are greatly enhanced by the
apparition of these sea-raiders. It would,
we think, be most interesting to test
the nerve of our Volunteers by suddenly
confronting them, during manoeuvres,
with some unfamiliar and appalling mon-
ster—such as the okapi or diplodocus.
Surely Mr. HALDANE could induce the
Treasury to provide funds for such an
experiment.—ED. Dictator.]

sketching will be allowed next term in the
Divorce Court.]
OH, Mr. Justice GoRELL BARNES,

Unless the law-reporter yarns,
We think you're very mean.
We take a painful interest
In all Divorce Court doings,
It gives suburban life a zest

But if the artist draws no more,
How can we test its fitness?
It yields an all-absorbing joy
To scan the picture-page
That shows the features sweetly coy
Of ladies on the stage;
We must inspect the lineaments
Of heroine and houri–
And now a cruel judge prevents
Our acting as the jury ! .

Thank you for the likeness, which is
very good. Yours lovingly,
MAY TRUEMAN.
P.S.—You made my governess rather
old and scraggy. She is really young
and pretty, and such a dear.
SiR,-I have just seen your number
of the 18th ult., in which appears a
drawing of two girls engaged upon
their lessons, with their governess.
One of the girls (ETHEL) is made to say
“I count on my toes—then she (the
governess) can't see me doing it.”
The features depicted of the speaker
are clearly those of my daughter, and
I am sorry to say that the article is
untrue in three particulars—(1) My
daughter's name is MAY, not ETHEL;
(2) My daughter does not count on her
toes, but—being a slender girl—she
counts on her ribs; and (3) Her gover-
ness can see her doing this, and does
not object.
I regret that Punch should stoop to
insert so libellous a statement concern-
ing a young lady unable to defend
herself, and I must ask you to insert
this communication on her behalf.
Yours, &c. Adolphus TRUEMAN.
“THE BANANA FALL.”
(1 note on Pavement Etiquette.)
WHEN, after a short but rapid journey
along the pavement executed by the aid
of a banana skin, you obey the im-
mutable law of gravity and come to a
sudden sitstill by the kerb, you must
restrain, at no matter what sacrifice, any
desire which you may feel to smile
blandly back upon the crowd, whether
it is a sympathetic crowd or not.
The correct attitude is as follows:
Having ascertained that the full extent
of your injuries is no more than will
occasion some slight discomfort when
cycling, &c., draw up one knee into a
graceful and unconstrained position,
flick the dust carelessly from your elbow,
and remark casually to any intelligent
bystander that you do not think the
Education Bill has the ghost of a chance.
Do not appear in the least self-con-
scious, but on the other hand neither
must you scowl, unless (in exceptional
cases) very slightly, or mutter discon-
tentedly to yourself. The most suitable
expression to wear is one of quiet, good-
natured boredom, but if anybody
addresses a question to you answer him
politely and kindly, as you would a
pretty girl who asked you the way to
Oxford Street.
Do not aim a kick—which is sure to
miss—at the dog which appears in order
to sniff you critically all over, but be
careful to treat him as though you were
passionately fond of animals; pull his
ears gently, and pat him caressingly on
the head. This will lead all new arrivals
Belle of Balham (to Professor, who has just played Chopin's Funeral March). “Tº Ar’s
Awfully Jolly!
Now PLAY ONE of Loheng Rin's Things!
to suppose that you are sitting on the
ground solely in order to fondle him,
and always creates a good impression.
Office boys in particular will admire this
trait in your character.
You have now remained seated on the
ground long enough to be able to rise
without appearing in any way flurried
or nervous. The best way of rising is
to crook one leg until the foot is well
underneath, so that you may straighten
out to a standing posture with a single
elegant and easy motion.
Do this.
If the youth who now steps forward
and presents you with your hat is of a
sweet and tractable disposition, he will
indicate the fact by gently touching his
forehead, and a copper or two is well
bestowed. If, however, he approaches
with a grin on his face, and loudly
assures you that the damage to the hat
is slight, you may be sure that he will
regard such an offering as tribute rather
than a present therefore seize him by
the collar, and accuse him, quietly but
firmly, of attempting to steal the hat,
and of having caused the damage to it
himself. In extreme cases he may also
be accused of having dropped the banana
skin. Having regained your property,
dismiss him with a slight cuff on the
ear. As the sight of a fellow creature
in pain is always agreeable, this is sure
to put the crowd in a good humour.
Now dust your hat and replace it on
your head, and walk off nonchalantly,
having first picked up your stick and
anything else you may have dropped,
except your cigar. Leave this as largesse
for the crowd to wrangle over.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MY TEAM.
V.-AT THE WICKETs.
At lunch I said: “I have just had
a wire from the Derbyshire Committee
to say that I may put myself on to
bowl.”
“That is good hearing,” said HENRY.
“Did they hear?” asked GERALD
anxiously, looking over at the Chartleigh
team.
“You may think you're very funny,
but I'll bet you a-a- anything you like
that I get GEORGE out.”
“All right,” said GERALD. “I’ll play
you for second wicket down, the loser to
go in last.”
“Done,” I said ; “and what about
passing the salad now 7"
After lunch the Editor took me on one
side and said, “I don't like it. I don't
like it at all.”
“Then why did you have so much 2"
I asked.
“I mean the wicket. It's dangerous.
I am not thinking of myself so much, as
of---.”
“As of the reading public?”
“Quite so.”
“You think you – you would be missed
in Fleet Street—just at first 2"
“You are not putting the facts too
strongly. I was about to suggest that
I should be a ‘did not bat.’”
“Oh I see. Perhaps I ought to tell
you that I was talking just now to the
sister of their captain.”
The Editor looked interested.
“About the pen of the gardener?”
he said. -
“About you. She said–-I give you
her own words - ‘Who is the tall hand-
some man keeping wicket in an M.C.C.
cap º' So I said you were a well-known
county player, as she would see when
you went in to bat.”
The Editor shook my hand impres-
sively.
“Thank you very much,” he said.
“I shall not fail her. What county
did you say?”
“Part of Flint. You know the
little bit that's got into the wrong
county by mistake º That part. She
had never heard of it; but I assured
her it had a little bit of yellow all to
itself on the map. Have you a pretty
good eleven 2''
The Editor swore twice—once for me
and once for Flint. Then we went
out into the field.
My first ball did for GEORGE. I
followed the tactics of WILLIAM THE FIRST
at the Battle of Hastings, 1066. You
remember how he ordered his archers
to shoot into the air, and how one arrow
fell and pierced the eye of HAROLD,
whereupon confusion and disaster arose.
So with GEORGE: I hurled one perpen-
dicularly into the sky, and it dropped
(after a long time) straight upon the
batsman. GEORGE followed it with a
slightly contemptuous eye . . . all the
way.
All the way. Of course I was sorry.
We were all much distressed. They
told us afterwards he had never been
hit in the eye before . . . one gets new
experiences.
GEORGE retired hurt.
hurt as piqued, I fancy. He told the
umpire it wasn't bowling. Possibly.
Neither was it batting. It was just
superior tactics.
The innings soon closed, and we had
61 to win, and, what seemed more likely,
59 and various other numbers to lose.
Sixty-one is a very unlucky number
with me—oddly enough I have never
yet made 61; like W. G. GRACE, who
has never made 93. My average this
season is 5, which is a respectable
number. As Bolton pointed out – if
we each got 5 to-day, and there were 6
extras, we should win. I suppose if one
plays chess a good deal one thinks of
these things.
HAROLD, I mean GEORGE, refused to
field, so I nobly put myself in last and
substituted for him. This was owing to
an argument as to the exact wording of
my bet with GERALD.
“You said you'd get him out,” said
GER ALD.
“I meant ‘out of the way,’ ‘out of
the field,’ ‘cut of ----' "
“I meant out' according to the Laws
of Cricket. There are nine ways. Which
was yours, I should like to know?”
“Obstructing the ball.”
“There you are.”
I shifted my ground.
“I didn't say I'd get him out,” I ex-
plained. “I said I'd get him. Those
were my very words. “I will get GEORGE.’
Can you deny that I got him '''
“Even if you said that, which you
didn't, the common construction that
one puts upon the phrase is -–"
“If you are going to use long words
like that,” I said, “I must refer you to
my solicitor BoITON.”
Whereupon Bolton took counsel's
opinion, and reported that he could not
advise me to proceed with the matter.
So GERALD took second wicket, and I
fielded.
However, one advantage of fielding
was that I saw the Editor's innings from
start to finish at the closest quarters. He
came in at the end of the first over, and
took guard for “left hand round the
wicket.”
“Would you give it me?” he said to
BoLTON. “ These country umpires . . .
Thanks. And what's that over the
wicket 2 Thanks.”
He marked two places with the bail.
“How about having it from here?” I
Not so much
| the last moment I drove it hard past the
suggested at mid-on. “It’s quite a
good place, and we're in a straight line
with the church.”
The Editor returned the bail, and held
up his bat again.
- “That ‘two leg' all right? Thanks.”
He was proceeding to look round the
field when a gentle voice from behind
him said: “If you wouldn't mind
moving a bit, Sir, I could bowl.”
“Oh, is it over ?” said the Editor
airily, to hide his confusion. “I beg
your pardon, I beg your pardon.”
Still he had certainly impressed the
sister of their captain, and it was
dreadful to think of the disillusion-
ment that might follow at any mo–
ment. However, as it happened, he
had still another trick up his sleeve.
BoltoN hit a ball to cover, and the
Editor, in the words of the local
paper, “most sportingly sacrificed his
wicket when he saw that his partner
lºad not time to get back. It was a
question, however, whether there was
ever a run possible.”
Which shows that the reporter did
not know of the existence of their cap-
tain's sister.
When I came in the score was 51 for
nine, and HENRY was still in. I had
only one ball to play, so I feel that I
should describe it in full. I have four
good scoring strokes–the cut, the drive,
the hook, and the glance. As the
bowler ran up to the crease I decided
to cut the ball to the ropes. Directly,
however, it left his hand I saw that it
was a ball to hook, and accordingly I
changed my attitude to the one usually
adopted for that stroke. But the ball
came up further than I expected, so at
bowler. That at least was the idea.
Actually it turned out to be a beautiful
glance shot to the leg boundary. Seldom,
if ever, has BELIAM had such an oppor-
tunity for four action photographs on
one plate.
HENRY took a sixer next ball, and so
we won, And the rest of the story of
my team is it not written in the journals
of The Sportsman and The Chartleigh
Watchman, and in the hearts of all who
were privileged to compose it? But
how the Editor took two jokes I told him
in the train, and put them in his paper
(as his own), and how CAREY challenged
the engine-driver to an 18-hole solitaire
match, and how those things
indeed shall never be divulged.

A THREE-FIGURE DIET.
[“Mr. Joseph Zeitlin, of Brooklyn, New York, who has just celebrated
his 101st birthday, advises all who wish to become centenarians to
drink plenty of good wine, beer and whisky, to eat what they like,
and smoke all they want to.”—Daily Frpress.]
For many and many a year have I tied myself
Down to a diet supremely severe ;
Anything nice have I always denied myself,
Though my soul hankered for Sybarite cheer.
Thoughts of a ruined digestion affrighted me;
Visions of premature funerals blighted me,
So that I shrank from whatever delighted me,
Natural longing o'ermastered by fear.
Through all the four seasons I studied prodigiously
Chemical values of all kinds of fare;
I fed by a formula, followed religiously,
Weighing each dram with a scrupulous care.
Though appetite tortured me, little I heeded it,
Eating when Science declared that I needed it,
Just the right quantity—never exceeded it—
When had Hygeia a pupil so rare 2
But somehow it happened, the more and more rigorous
Grew my adhesion to health-giving laws,
I found I was steadily growing less vigorous,
Daily grew nearer, I thought, to Death's jaws.
Gone was my youth with its pristine agility,
Nerves were a bundle of irritability,
Driving me fast into sheer imbecility,
Fingers and toes were as skinny as claws.
But hark to the voice of the hale centenarian
Preaching a gospel of sugar and spice
No longer I'll linger, a pale vegetarian,
Over milk puddings of sago and rice.
In future I'll dare to detest what's detestable
Eating voraciously any comestible,
Never enquiring if it is digestible-
Only considering whether it's nice.
Salmon—I used to suppose it would poison me—
Luscious young lobster, just fresh from the sea,
And mayonnaise, shedding its creamiest joys on me,
Sources of infinite pleasure shall be.
Bacchus and baccy—no more I'll beware of them;
Careless and happy I'll worship the pair of them.
Once they have taught me to take proper care of them,
Life will be merry and long too for me.

'Arriet (to her prostrate caralier). “Don’t You Touch 'IM, 'ARRY.

MR. PUNCH To THE HARVARD CREw.
GENTLEMEN, - It was a great and joyous thought that
inspired you' to provoke our Cambridge men to a contest of
eight-oared ships and flashing oar-blades on Father Thames's
historic flood. You are confided to our loyalty and friend-
ship, and, having greeted you as brothers in sport and
generous emulation, we shall make it our pride to cherish
and guard you until you iterate the mighty surface of the
Atlantic and fare away on your homeward course to the
banks of the River Charles.
For more years than Mr. Punch cares to number has he
seen the dark blue flag of Oxford flying in rivalry to
Cambridge's light blue at Putney at a season when the wind
bites shrewdly and it is very cold. Now, when the sun is
hot and the breezes blow mildly, we are to behold the
crimson flag of Harvard waving its gallant challenge to the
men of the Cam, and on that broad tide which has suffered
for so many years the strokes of our native oarsmen we
shall behold you feathering and swinging and smiting the
beginning. . . . . - -
Mr. Punch is the friend of all manly and modest youngsters,
and the encourager of their generous exercises in vigour'an
skill. Permit him then to greet you with hand and heart and
to assure you of his respect and admiration. You have
|travelled far to match yourselves against the sons of your
Mother-University. They too are a sturdy and an active
band, worthy foemen, we may believe, for your young giants.
For you as for them victory in the race will mean much, but the
contest with its chivalry and its effort and its endurance, with its
frank and open intercourse and the friendships it must en-
gender will mean much more. It is in this spirit that Mr.
Punch, speaking on behalf of his countrymen, bids you welcome
to our shores, to our river and to our hearts. If you should win
he will be among the first to give you a cheer; should you lose
he will cheer you no less loudly, for he knows that you willin
any case have striven honourably and with undaunted courage;
And when the turmoil has ceased and the shouting has died
down and we all resume the normal tenor of our lives, may it
be yours to feel that your visit to the old country has been in fact
as pleasant as every Englishman wishes to make it.
Gentlemen, here's your very good health !
(Signed) panº,
Putting it Kindly.

A NEW ANTHOLOGY.
(Extract from Preface.)
I FELT that nature had intended me
for an anthologist; but alas! it seemed
that I had been born too late; all the
anthologies were already made; I could
only repeat the design of another. "
Dark is the night that knows nor moon nor star:
Darker the breast abandoned to despair.
Then a sudden ray of inspiration
illumined my mournful mind. The
“hundred best” examples of everything
had been offered to the public times
innumerable; but what of the hundred
worst 2 Ah! I lived again : I would
straightway gather together the Hundred
Worst Poems in the English language.
I threw myself into my task with an
ardour capable of overcoming the most
obstinate difficulties; and indeed diffi-|M
culties were not wanting: had it been
the million worst poems I designed to
bring together, I would have done it
easily; but the selection of so small a
number as a hundred is a matter requir-
ing much and delicate discrimination.
Conscious as I am of the shortcomings
of my work, it yet affords me no little
satisfaction to reflect that in this wide
field I have drawn the first furrow ;
that whatever changes may come I must
as ascertained and liguidated damages.
still be regarded as one of the world's
pioneers; for though many have tried
to compose the hundred worst poems
none before myself has ever thought of
selecting them from the great storehouse
of English Poetry and binding them
into a single garland.
“THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR– "
(From our half-orer-seas correspondent.)
5 A.M.–The Channel close in shore is
at present dotted with masks and faces,
and at least forty per cent. of the
swimmers are confident of reaching the
French coast. MEW has got a fine
swinging tide under him and is purring
with pleasure. The weather conditions
are, as usual at the start, practically
perfect, but at the same time there is no
use blinking the fact that the sca is
very wet.
7.45 A.M.–What looked at one time
like being a nasty accident was only
narrowly averted ; a turbine steamer,
carrying some of those old fogies who
either cannot or will not swim, collided
with one of the lesser-known aspirants
for the Blue Riband of the Surf. Luckily
he happened to be a particularly hard-
headed Scotsman, who, explaining that
he was in low water, agreed to take £5
8.25 A.M.–The number of swimmers
has now increased to such an alarming
extent, and the displacement of water is
so great that the French coast is slowly

THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF CADDIES.
To judge from a report in a recent issue
of The Manchester Courier the ignorance
of the Southport caddies is seriously exer-
cising the attention of the local educa-
tion authorities. Mrs. Foard, one of the
members of the Birkdale Area Education
Committee, stated that as the result of
“some little amateur examinations she
had conducted on the golf links” she
wondered how the caddies succeeded in
maintaining their position in the higher
standards. “Some of them could not
tell the capital of England,” while others
seemed to have no idea that it was
necessary to get out of England by
water in order to go on the Continent.
Mr. CocksHott, the Chairman, suggested
that, if the golf club committee conducted
an examination and only admitted those
boys who passed it, it would be a very
great help.
We all know that, generally speaking,
Lancashire leads the way in progress,
but there are exceptions to prove the
rule, and in the education of caddies
there can be no doubt that they manage
things better in Scotland.
| Thus it may not be generally known
that the system of University Extension
adopted at the University of St. Andrews
embraces a Caddie Department, pre-
sided over by Professor THOMAS MoRRis.
Thanks to the courtesy of the Principal
of St. Andrews we are enabled to re-
print the General Paper set at the last
terminal examination of his class by
Professor ANDREw Kirk ALDY, Litt. D.,
who occupies the chair of Belles Lettres
in this department with the utmost
urbanity:-
1. What are the capitals of Manchuria,
Bessarabia, the Balearic Isles 2 Who
are the amateur champions of Seistan,
Podolia, Nova Zembla, Pitcairn Island
and Bolivia 2
2. What Greek philosopher was re-
sponsible for the dictum that “the half
is greater than the hole” 2 Reconcile
the apparent antinomy of this paradox.
3. Who is the only leading profes-
sional golfer who habitually plays in
knickerbockers ?
4. Write brief biographies of Dolly
WARDON, Miss MAY HEZLET, the Earl of
ARLINGTON, and FUSELI.
5. According to some histories John
BALL was a priest who took part in the
rebellion of WAT TYLER. Examine the
evidences for this view and state how
many strokes BEN SAYERS would give
the Benicia Boy if the latter were still
alive.
6. Mr. HoRACE HUTChiNSON recom-
mends champagne before match play.
State Sir Victor HoRSLEY's view on the
subject and discuss the relative merits
of Talisker, phenacetin, and lemon
squash as a corrective to slicing.
7. On what occasion did a famous
professional golfer describe his partner
(a distinguished minister of the Free
Church) as “a sanctified eediot?” Did
the provocation justify such intem-
perate language?
8. State the best routes to Le Touquet,
La Boulie, and Biarritz, and give your
candid opinion as to the bearing of the
employment of girl caddies on the
Woman Suffrage Question.
9. Give the context of the following
Shakspearean quotations. (1) “I know
a Hawk from a Haskell.” (2) “This
apish and unmannerly approach.”
10. What odds could Lord DUDLEY

WE numbered, on the average, forty

in which our leader was held that
there was no nickname for him. He was

Berlin-Wool Shop, The International
Fur Stores, The Map, The Torpedo, The
Mummer (an interesting fellow, this:
he was on the stage for many years, and
had performed at all the principal
hippodromes in Europe), The Dook (who
claimed to be the second cousin of a
pedigree dog, and was the only one of
us who was careful of his toilet; it was
even rumoured that he used coat-gloss),
The Dyspeptic (who was absurdly
touchy), King Leer (who was always
ogling the women), Nobody's Darling,
Bulgy, The Man-Hater, The Looney, The
Braggart (he boasted,among other things,
that he was the Derby Dog in 1901),
The Cat, The Spotted Dog, The Ghost,
The Parricide (he slew his father in a
fight), and Adam (who refused to wear
even a collar, and was frequently taken
up by the police for being insufficiently
clothed). Of some of these I propose to
speak at greater length later on. We
were not, perhaps, a pretty lot to look
at, but we were businesslike and always
ready for action. We would not shun
a fight for fear that our hair might get
disarranged. By-the-by, I should
mention that it was at one time pro-
posed by The Hippopotamus that the
members, instead of having sobriquets,
which were apt to cause unnecessary
pain," should be called that species of
dog which they most resembled. The
Captain, however, declared that he would
| never have sufficient time at his disposal
to decide such knotty questions as would
then arise.
Poor old Hippo'
The MAP.
But The Hippopotamus was by no
means our most unfortunate-looking
member. The Map was this. I challenge
any other club to produce a member
like The Map. We were proud of The
Map.
He was a dog who was divided up
all over by means of black lines—he
was completely criss-crossed in this way
—and on each piece of territory so
marked off there was writing; and it
was all done in the most untidy manner.
You never saw such a sight as The Map
—he was the laughing-stock of the
neighbourhood-–and, had I been he, I
should only have walked abroad at night.
His tale was a sad one. The Map had
suffered much.
He started life, he told me one day,
as a smooth-coated all-white —like The
Ghost. His youth was not unhappy.
Then, one day, he was presented to a
family of six children, and his martyr-
dom began.
It would have been all right if he had
been given to one of them, but he was
given to all of them, and they were
exceptionally quarrelsome children. On
the very day of his arrival there was a
big row, because the eldest boy claimed
him by right of primogeniture. This
privilege of the first-born, it seems, had
never been disputed till then. It ex-
tended to all things, including the right
of being served first at meals, so that
the next eldest longed for the heir's
death, for he did not relish the idea of
having to wait till, perhaps, he was
seventy before he was entitled to the
first slice of pudding. But as regards
their new present the younger sons
would have none of this, and there was
bloodshed threatened, until the Nurse
said angrily, “It’s all of your dogs, of
course, and, what's more, if you don't
stop quarrelling, it shan’t be any of
your dogs!” This threat sobered the
children a bit, but by the end of the
day the poor Map was tired to death,
for they all tried to stroke him at the
same time, and there was not room on
him for this, and he was pushed and
buffeted until he felt inclined to drop.
As time went on things did not improve,
and there was not a day on which The
Map was not the cause of some dispute
--to his great inconvenience. Some-
times, as a punishment to the children,
he would be locked in a dark cellar for
the entire day, so that none of them
could have him.
Then one afternoon the outrage took
place.
The idea was that of a school-friend
who had come to tea, and who had been
reading about the partition of Africa.
This young savage noticed what a
source of contention The Map was,
especially when he asked to whom the
dog belonged and received the answers,
§§§ “Me " ' " “Me ' " “Me " ' ' ' "
“Why don't you partition him 2"
asked the guest. At this The Map, who
thought he was actually to be cut up,
made for the door; but it was shut
before he could escape.
“How 2" asked the children.
The savage then explained. They
were to decide on a scheme of allotment,
and then with a paint brush and some
marking ink he would stake the dog
out. The proposal was received with
acclamation, and, after a great deal of
squabbling, it was decided that the
eldest boy should have the head (with
the sole right to feed—a nice thing for
The Map, who had hitherto received
food from all of them), the others were
each to have a stretch of the body, while
the tail—which for some reason or other
was much coveted – was divided into
six. The Map, all trembling, was then
seized, and the suggested demarcations
were made in indelible ink, and the
children's names written on the appro-
priate parts. At the last moment the
school-friend said he thought he ought
to have a piece as originator of the idea,
and this was agreed to. This necessi-
tated some of the lines being deleted, and
The Map suffered agonies under an abor-
tive attempt to alter him with ink-eraser.
Finally the lines which were to be shifted
had to be scratched out in ink, and
when this was done, and, in the excite-
ment, several blots made on the poor
beast, one may imagine how he looked.
You never saw such a mess!
And even this vile plan did not mean
The Map.
The demarcations were made in indelible ink.
peace for my unfortunate friend. There
was soon trouble about his tail. The
owner of one section commanded him
to wag it, and the owner of another
section forbade him to wag his part.
And before the party broke up one boy
had swopped a piece of his territory,
halfway down the back, for a collection
of postage stamps, and further altera-
tions were made.
No wonder some dogs get soured
That night The Map ran away. He

did not stop running until the next
morning. Then the Captain met him,
and The Map became one of our most
valued members. For he was now an
Enemy of Society, and therefore a good
fighter, and the Captain liked to sur-
round himself with such.
The Map, I should mention, was
always most sensitive about his appear-
ance, and it was a bold dog who dared
to joke about it in his presence.

DR. CLIFFoRD has begged to differ

desired. --
The Gaekwar of BARODA has said he
does not think much of the complexion

It is reported that Mr. BALFour and

a settlement of the unfortunate differ-

The Daily Chronicle published, the
other day, a portrait of Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL over the title, “The Hope of

hope. Mr. CHURCHILL can hardly be
expected to put on any more side.
The heat during the Townshend

unbearable, but we were none the less
surprised to read the following statement
in a usually reliable contemporary:
“Mr. SUTHERST tendered himself as the

A serious decline in the popularity of

The suggestion made by the Com-

their length of experience in years is,
we should have thought, somewhat
superfluous. In the case of four-wheelers,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A Motor Car Dirorce (Duckworth), by Louise CLosseſ:
HALE, will disappoint many who may be attracted by the
promise of its title. There is plenty of motor-car in it, but
nothing resembling a divorce. Never have the Apennines
or the Alps been moted over by a couple so virtuous, so
devoted to one another, so congenial in temperament. But
it was necessary that some sort of piquancy should be
instilled into the diary of a tour along the fairly familiar
roads between Naples and Paris. So the author repre-
sents herself as a member of an Advanced Women's Club in
New York, where they approve the Meredithian scheme of
marriage-contracts terminable every ten years, a scheme
of which she undertakes to be the first active apostle. She
will emancipate herself from her husband on the ground of
incompatibility of temper. Like a good fellow he enters
heartily into this proposition, only stipulating that it shall
not be carried through on vulgar lines, that would bring
their happy home into contempt through servants' evidence.
Accordingly they arrange a motor-car tour as likely to
furnish occasion for bickerings of which she can take full
notes in a diary to be used in Court against him. But in
the event we are told that no entry, except of the cost of
gasoline, ever gets into the diary, which makes it difficult
to understand how the book ever came to be written, unless
the fleshy tablets of the lady's mind were unusually retentive
of impressions. Her narrative, written in American, and with
scarce a pretence to literary style, is delightfully fresh and
fluent. It avoids tedious descriptions, and often hits off the
characteristics of a scene in a single sentence quotable under
the pleasant fluffy little sketches (by WALTER HALE) that
permit one to realise the text. The plot of the small comedy
in which the Other Woman figures as a cause of groundless
jealousy is rather thin and artificial, but the motor-car itself is
a very convincing object, and grows quite human as one gets to
understand its idiosyncrasies. The book abounds in the live-
liest humour, some of it a little forced, much of it merely Ameri-
can, but with a charming residue that has the right quality.
I must suppose that the author really saw most of the things
that she describes, however faulty her spelling of foreign
names (Tedesci for Tedeschi, bersilieri for bersaglieri) may
be ; yet one becomes suspicious when she talks of the
“Potits Chevaux'' at Aix as an “affair” in which “a
ball bobs round.” Might not Messrs. Duckworth & Co.,
with their superior knowledge, have put her right on this
point? Then there is a picture of an English Peer which
scarcely corresponds to anything outside the traditions of
ignorance. But these defects are of small consequence; and
many worse faults might easily be forgiven to a writer that
has so gay a humour, so buoyant a charm.
The Ring of Day is framed to melt
The hearts of pathriot sons of Erin,
Who dream of Ireland for the Celt,
Unlarassed by the realm that we're in—
A land with tyrants overthrown
(As sung of old by minstrel rhymers),
That has a language all its own,
And speaks it (with the help of primers).
The heroine, whose life-long work
Is aiming at this consummation,
Is “bored and boring Beatrice Burke "—
I quote her own apt appellation.
Hutchissox is the publisher,
And MARY BUILEIt author of it,
And I expect, for him and her
(And Erin), mighty little profit.

The Mystery of Magdalen (John LONG) is murder, a cir-
cumstance whose gruesomeness is lightened to the sensitive
mind by the alliterative charm of the title. Mrs. Covisox
KERNAHAN lays on her colour thick and slab. Villains,
chiefly Russian, come and go red-handed. Magdalen herself
cherishes filial resolve to slay the largest of them, one Rach-
manenhoff, who had betrayed her father to the servant of
the CzAR. To that end she deliberately marries a good-
looking reputedly rich Englishman. Why without that
preliminary she could not have shot at sight the villain
whom, in view of limited space, it is convenient to refer to
as R., is one of the minor mysteries of the drama. At one
point Mrs. KERNAHAN brings on the scene a veiled woman, for
whom Magdalen's fiancé provides meat and lodging. There's
nothing in the incident. She is merely his twin sister, tem-
rily parted from her husband. But what with her veil,
her baby and her twin's secretiveness the experienced reader
suspects mischief. It all comes right in the end. But before
reaching it one rushes breathless through a series of blood-
curdling scenes.
HOLIDAY WIGNETTES.
Not to those sands whose adolescent diggers
Foster a lively trade in Chelsea buns;
Whose airs are balmy with the noise of niggers,
Where lounge the flower of Neptune's fishy sons;
Not to some haunt go I whose gilded palaces
Cater with bands and oyster bars for him
; Whose purse is light; where pleasure's ready chalice is
i Filled for a modest shilling to the brim.
Not to hotels where jaded table-d'hôters'
Are gorged with dubious and dyspeptic fare,
Where rich men flaunt their millions and their motors,
And rich men's wives the newest shades of hair;
Not to some spa where invalids are carried off
Daily to bathe in evil-smelling ooze, -
Where coy young things of thirty-five get married off
To nervous widowers that daren't refuse.
Mine be to bask in some secluded village,
Some murmurous haunt of not too hungry flies,
Far from the shamelessly persistent pillage
Of fashionable caravanserais;
Some moorland homestead girt with purple distances,
Or Kentish farm deep bowered in orchard rows;
Some fishing town the means of whose subsistence is
Plain, but not too apparent, to the nose.
There let me live a life of peace and quiet,
Screened from the turmoil that my spirit loathes,
Taking a large but inexpensive diet,
And wearing out my oldest set of clothes;
There let me gaze enraptured on the scenery,
Breathe the fine air and sniff the loud ozone,
Or roam through lanes high walled with tender greenery,
Soaked in divine contentment to the bone.
Fresh air, fresh scenes, fresh solitude to banish
Black cares that irk the town-distracted soul;
With warbling birds, and timid beasts that vanish,
Long ere you see them, down a neighbouring hole.
These would I seek. But man's a poor dull camel, he
Still bears a load he cannot put away,
And so I've got to take my wife and family
To spend a pleasant fortnight at Herne Bay. ALGOL.

GOLF A LA RUSSE.
THE first Russian golf club was opened
on August 15, the links being situated
on the Kolomyagi race - course about
three miles north of St. Petersburg. We
understand that natural and political
exigencies have necessitated a slight
revision of the rules of the Royal and
Ancient game, as embodied in the
following addenda:
1. Membership shall be confined to
the Order of St. Andrew the First-called,
who is by Imperial ukase appointed
Patron of the Club.
2. The Constitutional Democratic
Party (alias the “ K.D.'s"), headed by
Professor MILIt koff, being now relieved
of their labours in the Duma, shall serve
as “caddies.” Their IRussian nickname
approximates almost exactly to the
Scottish term, and was bestowed upon
them in anticipation of their sole useful
function in the future.]
3. “Colonel Bogie,” on the score of
being a Terrorist, shall be debarred
from all play on the links, and, if dis-
covered, shall be given his passports
and deported back to England by the
club Ispravnik.
4. Should a grand-ducal match be in
progress, a state of “extraordinary pro-
tection ” of the course shall be declared,
every bunker being personally searched
for myeblagonadyozhniye (or politically
untrustworthy) persons by General
TREPOFF and M. STOLYPIN.
5. Every hole shall be guarded by a
Cossack, and a sotnia held in readiness
at Pargalovo, three versts away, in case
of a pogrom among the players or K.D.'s.
6. A bomb between a ball and the
hole shall count as a stimie, and, if at
the bottom of the hole, shall entail the
loss of the same to the player whose ball
first comes in contact with it.
7. Not more than three players with
their K.D.'s shall assemble at any one
hole, “foursomes" being prohibited.
The course shall be covered on the étape
system, by signal from the Cossack at
the next hole in front.
8. K.D.'s shall not presume to give
advice to the players, thus overstepping
the limits of the Imperial Manifesto of
October, 1905.
9. If, during the winter season, a
K.D. be lost in the snow, another may
be taken up by the scruff of the neck
and dropped behind the player's back,
life being cheap in Russia.
10. A list of expletives shall be autho-
rised and issued by the Censor. Any
infringement by a player other than an
Actual Privy Councillor or M. Pobie-
DONostsFFF (late Procurator of the Holy
Synod) shall be punished by administra-
tive exile to Siberia.
11. For the word “Fore!” shall
be substituted the Russian term
“Seitchas " " (directly ) meaning that
in an hour or so, according to the
national connotation, a ball will be
coming along.
12. Any disputes between the players
shall be referred to the Hague Confer-
ence, in order that the latter body may
justify its existence. Zig-ZAG.

THE READING OF THE POEM.
(From the Peas pugal, Papers.)
I AM not likely soon to forget that night. -
The room was one of the most charming in England,
looking out on the geranium beds with their borders of
blue lobelias and bright and vivid calceolarias; at the
beautiful rustic seats and the closely-shaven lawn, and the
white croquet hoops and gaily-coloured posts which testified
to our host's occasional descents from the realms of poesy in
which he normally dwelt to such mundane trivialities as
games of ball.
The room within was in perfect keeping with this garden
paradise. It was long and large, with wide mallogany seats
in the four deep windows, ancient mahogany chairs and
great bookcases filled with the best books; dark pier tables,
a centre table and a mirror over the ample fireplace all of
good English make and solidity. There were geraniums in
the window boxes, other and choicer books on the table :
while an air of quiet refinement and the very essence of
cultured homeness, if I may coin a word, pervaded all. This
is the meagre outline of a room which, having once sat
within, you would wish never to see changed, in which
many pure and noble men and women have loved to commune
with high thoughts.
I have not said where it was ; but it was in the retired
London suburb of Anerley that ERAs Mts Boyſ: had chºsen
to dwell, rejecting with that wise deliberateness that was
always one of his characteristics more fashionable or secluded
spots. His house was in the Fairnead Road, No. 8, but
like all houses in those parts it had its own name as well
as number, and was known as Farringford, out of honour to
the great poet of “In Memoriam,” which my friend could
never mention without tears.
The night to which I refer was many years ago, and I
had been asked to make one of a privileged little group of
B ME's friends who were to listen to the poet's reading of
his new work just completed in MS. “The World at once
so Great and Small,” as he had called it, in the rotund way
which was characteristic of him. I will not name all who
were there, but among them was one whose youthful fame
and genius were the pride of all - HARRIET PICK \RD (now
Mrs. CANDY), the author of numberless stories for the young,
and also Dr. CRIMLEIGH, the historian of Surbiton, whose
work is considered by good judges to be an unsurpassed
contribution to topography. I can see him now with his
mild old face and gold spectacles as he checked off the
rhymes with his liſted forefinger. Pretty 13ELLA BLENCHEs,
afterwards a pupil of Madame SCHUMANN, was there too, and
I remember how beautifully she rendered a morecau now
and then during the evening. She is now Mrs. Lippi:TTER,
and is still charming.
I wish I could remember exactly what was said by that
critical circle; for there were some quick and brilliant minds
and some pungent powers of appreciation there. The
Younger ones, many of them young ladies of Anerley, had
all felt the moulding force of some very original and potential
educators; and all had read not only LONGFELI w but
EMERSON and Rºskix. Of living teachers, probably no one,
after the poet himself, had come more intimately and effectu-
ally into formative relations with them than Dr. Wilsox
('AMPIELL, the great antagonist of Hºxley.
I wish I could remember what they said: but all that has
passed away; . I think somebody objected to the length of
the title, which the poet admitted to be a fault, but said
something of wishing to get the idea of the unity of the
world into it as the main idea of the work. I only recall
the enthusiastic delight with which canto after canto was
received, and BoME's raising himself to his full height at
the conclusion and standing over us, as it were, with his
---- - - T-
hand slipped into his coat, a characteristic attitude, and with
a commanding toss of his head as he said, with a break in
his voice, “Well, friends all, it can't be so good as you say.
There must be some faults in it.” But we assured him
again that there were none. I have seen something of
human pomp and happiness (as any man must who has been

13ear grisly evidence of civil war,
And fratricidal beak.
You do but mock us in the dish : -
Even the heartiest gorge must needs recoil
At fibres redolent of brine and oil :
Resides, you smell of fish.

And passing dear the long, uxorious wail
In woodlands of the mellow nightingale;

In its equipment of the perfect quill
For cleaning out one's pipe.

[“Two German professors have solved the
mystery of how to live on nothing a year.
They are at present leading an exceedingly
simple existence in Kabakon, a small island in
the South Seas, where their food consists only
of cocoanuts, their clothes of loin cloths of
cocoa-nut fibre, and their amusement of sitting
in the sea reading.”—Daily Express.]
I HATED the strenuous town,
I shied at the sight of blue forms,
I longed to escape
From the land of red tape
And a chief who is given to storms;
I wished to grow ruddy and brown,
I sighed to become picturesque;
I'd visions in plenty
Of sweet far miente,
Far, far from the tyrannous desk.
Yet visions like these were in vain :
Dame Fortune proved ever severe,
And she bade me quill-drive
From eleven to five
For a pitiful pittance a year.
It seemed to me painfully plain
That Poverty made it my fate
To sit like the Peri,
Heart-broken and weary,
Outside the delectable gate.
For Dives alone (fancied I)
Could afford–lucky beggar!—to slack,
And list to the breeze
Sighing soft through the trees
As he lay at full length on his back.
For Dives alone was the sky
Mirrored blue in the blue summer sea—
Alas! the rare pleasure
Of infinite leisure
Could never be tasted by me.
But when the dark cloud of despair
On a sudden came news
That disposed of my blues,
I heard of a spot passing fair
Where nature wears ever a smile,
Where palms wave above you,
And money-Lord love you !
There's none in this Fortunate Isle.
Till you're hot you may lie i' the sun,
And you promptly forget
That you ever have met
Such a thing as a desk or a stool.
Official reports there are none;
Dull minutes no longer exist
To worry and bore you,
In which you may do as you list.
The prospect of hunger or thirst
Need never occasion a qualm:
Are you anxious to feed,
r You will find all you need
In a neighbouring cocoa-nut palm.
Had plunged all my soul in black night,
As the sun puts the darkness to flight.

Though years stretch before you

CHARIVARIA.
WE have not had long to wait for an
object lesson showing the danger of
Parliamentary recesses. Scarcely had
the House risen when an Ethiopian was
sent to prison at Durban merely for
preaching sedition. Mr. ByLEs, M.P.,
Wººl have had something to say about
that.
We are in a position to deny the
silly rumour that Mr. HALDANE, if he
attends the German manoeuvres, will
wear the coquettish uniform of a Lancer.
The War Stores Report is still being
discussed, and the War Office is blamed
for not having made preparations for
the “winding up " of the War. To
this the War Office retorts by asking how
was it to know that the War would ever
be ended. - - - - -
According to Reuter, one of the SUL-
TAN's palace doctors, who has relieved
HIS MAJESTY of much pain, has been
promoted to the rank of General by the
grateful monarch, and now there is
scarce a dentist in Constantinople who
does not hope one day to be an Admiral.
A letter, which bore the vague inscrip-
tion : “Corner house--two stone dogs
in front-Clacton,” has been delivered
by the postal authorities at a house with
two stone dogs in front at Clacton.
Talk about Sherlock Holmes /
So many people are of the opinion
that solicitors are grasping that we think
it unfortunate that Sir GEORGE LEwis, in
reply to a query from The Daily Mail on
the subject of sleep, should have said
that he thought eight hours sufficient,
but that he took nine.
Commercial morality does not seem to
improve. What are we to think of a
firm which is boldly advertising “Boned”
chicken for sale 2
Apparently The Jungle is not to be
the only novel on the subject of the
Potted Meat Scandals. We notice that
a firm of publishers have just brought
out a book entitled The Poison of
Tongues. --- - - -
Tenby has decided to look after its
bathers. “The Town Council,” we read,
“ has agreed that in future all male
bathers shall be attired in a University
costume.” Anything, we suppose, is
better than dulness, and the spectacle
of bathers in cap and gown should
certainly prove an additional attraction.
We would draw the attention of those
persons who hold that otter-hunting is
not cruel to the fact that last week an
M.O.H. received a nasty bite from one
of these beasts.
The Dogs' Home at Battersea is to be
enlarged. When rebuilt it will be able
to house dachshunds of any reasonable
length. -- - -
Meanwhile we have nothing in Lon-
don to rival the magnificent Curhaus
which is a feature of so many conti-
mental towns.
“There is no doubt,” says The Indus-
trial Motor Heriew, “that there is a large
field open in Persia for motor vehicles.”
The idea is an admirable one, and it
seems strange that in England we should
hitherto have confined motor vehicles to
the roads (and ditches) when there must
be quite a number of “large fields"
available.
A gentleman writes to a contemporary
to complain of the harsh treatment
meted out to “luggage in advance” by
the average porter. It is only fair to
one firm of carriers to state that it puts
the public on its guard. The poster
issued by them as an advertisement of
the new system depicts a devil carrying
a portmanteau. -
Mr. HALL ('AINE, we hear, has been
greatly interested in the discussion which
has been raging in the columns of The
Express: “Are we becoming less
religious 2 " Mr. CAINE’s experience is
that we are. He fancies he does not meet
with the same amount of reverence that
used to be shown him.
We try to believe everything we
read in the newspapers, but sometimes
we find it difficult. For instance The
Cardiff Ereming Erpress, in describing
a policeman's encounter with a prisoner
the other day, said, “His trousers gave
way, and after struggling half-an-hour
they became exhausted.”
THE PARTING GUEST.
How to speed the parting guest is,
and has long been, one of the most
puzzling problems to those who live in
the country; and it recurs in its acutest
form every Monday morning. The
genius who would hit on the perfect
way, ensuring a rapid and successful
departure without any loss of affection
for the host and hostess, or even sus-
picion that they were interested in this
acceleration or had any wish in the
world but that the guest should stay on
for ever— that genius would deserve a
monument of gold. In default, however,
of the ideal solution, certain suggestions
have from time to time been made, some
crude enough may be, but all well-
intended; as, for example, that on the
Sunday night the bedroom should be filled
with Bradshaws, one even being slipped
negligently into the bed itself; or that
on saying good-night the visitor should
be reminded that he would be called
early to make sure of his train. These
are good ways, but an even better is
the Railway Hint Card, invented by
Messrs. DE SPATCH, the stationers, copies
of which have been sent to us, and one
of which we reproduce :

These cards, if plentifully hung about the
house on Sundays, or placed in the visi-
tors' plates and on their looking-glasses
and so forth, are guaranteed tactfully
and quietly to have the desired effect.
A CONVERSATIONAL QUESTION
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--Knowing that you
are always ready to help those in trouble
I am venturing to write for your advice
in a matter of some importance to my-
self. The facts briefly are these.
About a year ago I had dinner at my
Club with a man whom I will call SM IIII.
In the smoking-room afterwards SMITH
introduced me to a friend of his, and
we all had a few words together. I
shall speak of the friend as JoxEs, but
I would have you know, Mr. Punch,
that this name conceals the identity of
a man of some eminence, and a man old
enough to be -at any rate my uncle.
Indeed I gather from Who's Who that
with ordinary luck he might well have
been my father.
After the introduction SMITH went
back to the country, and, but for an
occasional visit to town, there he re-
mains. JoxEs and I, however, are stuck
in London-fellow-members of a Club
which we use daily. I need hardly say
that at least once a day we come across
each other. It is because of this, Mr.
Punch, that I am writing to you.
JoNES, as I have said, is a man of
years, position and dignity; I am young,
and unknown to anybody save the third
waiter on the left as you go into the
dining-room. JoSEs’ particular subject
is SCHOPENHAUER ; mine is Cricket (and
in passing, I may say that it is a cer-
tainty for Kent).
Politeness demands that we should

say something when we meet, and of
course I am quite ready to suit my
conversation to his. If he really wants
to talk about Schopf NHAUER, I am will-
ing; but somehow I feel that the in-
quiry, “How's Schop” coming from
a man so much younger than himself,
would not be altogether satisfactory.
My own subject, County Cricket, would
be of little interest to him ; so that there
remains only the weather and
'es, Mr. Punch, you have guessed it.
Our mutual friend SMITH.
Reasoning, doubtless, on different lines
we have arrived at the same conclusion.
Let me give you what used to be our
daily dialogue.
SCENE–Amy of the Club rooms.
†f }(meeting suddenly). Hallo!
A pause, while we think hard of what
to say mert. Then

Another long pause. Then
Jones (on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays). Well, I must be getting on.
(On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Satur-
days the remark is mine.)
Scene closes.
Now that, Mr. Punch, is what has been
going on for weeks, and I ask you, is it
worthy of either of us? Personally, I am
sick of it, and about a month ago I deter-
mined to try something else. Accordingly,
after the preliminary “Hallos,” I said:
Myself. How lucky! I particularly
wanted to see you.
He (striking an altitude of resigned
attention). Yes?
Myself. Yes. I wanted to ask you-
now, let's see, what was it?
He (confound him '). Anything about
SMITH 2
Myself (weakly giving in). Er-yes.
Er—how is he ”
He. I haven't seen him lately.
Myself. Oh, thanks. Good bye.
Since then I have tried to avoid him,
and he, I am sure, has tried to avoid me.
But it is all useless. Every day the
same thing happens. Now, dear Mr.
Punch, can you help me? I don't think
I am naturally a fool. I can talk to men
of my own age, and to children, and to
ladies (if they are nice to me) with more
or less success; but in the presence of
JoxEs, who is old enough to be my uncle,
and who knows SchopºxhAUER intimately,
I am tongue-tied.
Good-bye. Kent is absolutely — oh,
but I told you that before.
Ever, Mr. Punch, your devoted friend,
IRICHARD.
P.S.--Of course, next time, I might
pretend to be dumb, and tap my
mouth significantly; only he would
probably turn out to know the deaf-and-
dumb language quite well. Still it
would be a change.

[AUGUST 22, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OPERATIC PROJECTS.
No more striking evidence of the
advance of musical culture in our midst
is to be found than in the prodigious
activity now observed in operatic circles.
Formerly, opera was an appanage of the
aristocracy. It is already within the
reach of the middle classes, and bids
fair ere long to become the special
pastime of the million. To descend,
however, from generalities to the test of
the concrete instance, we may note, first
of all, the remarkable scheme in
connection with which Commodore
GILLowson, the famous impresario, is
now on a visit to London. Commodore
GILLowsox, as we need hardly remind
our readers, is the son of the equally
famous impresario, Admiral GILLowson,
who, beginning as a humble performer
on the tromba marina in the orchestra
at Covent Garden, achieved a celebrity
which gained for him the rank of
Honorary Admiral in the Chilian Navy.
::: *:: ::: s:
Commodore Gillowsox, with whom
we recently had the pleasure of an
interview on board his turbine yacht
Desdemona, at present anchored off
Gravesend, informs us that, backed by
a Chilian Syndicate, he has come over
for the express purpose of acquiring
the Stolliseum, Olympia, the Hippo-
drome and the Crystal Palace, with a
view of converting them into grand
national opera houses, to be open night
and day all the year round. Should
his offer, which is on the most liberal
scale, be accepted, it is his intention to
run opera on lines of unexampled and
sultanic splendour, and to present, in
addition to the standard works, several
new lyric masterpieces never yet per-
formed in London. Thus at the Stolli-
seum, which has a revolving stage, he
proposes to lead off with a new Chilian
revolutionary opera in which quick-
firing guns, howitzers, bombs, and other
specimens of modern ordnance will be
freely employed. It is part of Commo-
dore GILLOWSON's scheme to convert the
roof of the Stolliseum into an open-air
amphitheatre where the audience could
repair between the acts and witness
games of football, lacrosse, baseball,
pelota, and (in the winter) water polo.
::: + + *
The Hippodrome, according to the
scheme, would be devoted chiefly to
equestrian and aquatic opera, the re-
pertory including such pieces as the
Postillon de Longjumeau, the ('heral de
Bronze, the Flying Dutchman, l'heingold,
&c. M \RCELINE, we are glad to hear,
has provisionally undertaken to play
the rôle of his namesake in BEEIHovºx's
Fidelio, and Mr. OTHo Twigg will, of
course, conduct the performances of the
Ring. Realism being the essence of
Commodore GIIIowson's system, he
guarantees that every Rhine daughter
shall be a first-rate dira, and that every
tenor must at least have held a com-
mission in the Caralleria Rusticama or
yeomanry. It is also his intention to
convert the roof of the Hippodrome into
a kitchen garden, where the audience
would be able to repair between the acts,
and vegetarian suppers would be served
after the opera.
+ + + +
The contemplated performances at the
Crystal Palace will be on a scale com-
mensurate with the magnitude of that
imposing edifice, while at the same time
they will be adapted to the aesthetic equip-
ment of a suburban audience. In fair
weather they will be given out of doors,
and as the artists will all be furnished
with megaphones it is expected that
audiences of from 20,000 to 50,000 will be
able to enjoy the representations. Com-
missions have already been given to
several eminent composers to write operas
in which there will be special oppor-
tunities for those pyrotechnic displays
for which the Sydenham glass-house
has always been famous. Thus Signor
LEoNCAVALIO is hard at work on a monu-
mental trilogy entitled “The Eruption
of Vesuvius,” for which the libretto has
been supplied by Sir Nory:AN LockYER,
with lyrics by Mr. ADRIAN Ross. Another
work which arouses the liveliest expecta-
tion is “ The Light of Other Days,”
words and music by KENSAL VERDI, a
transparent pseudonym which veils with-
out concealing the engaging personality
of Mr. ALGERNoN AshroN. We may add
that it is part of Commodore GILLowson's
scheme to lend a rotary motion to both
the North and the South Towers by
turbine engines in order to promote the
comfort of spectators, and to associate
Mr. W. G. GRACE with Madame WAGNER
in the training of the principal singers.
+ ::: + +
Finally there remains Olympia. Here
Commodore GILIowson hopes, by securing
the services of General ShoolBREDsoN and
Colonel WARINGSON as joint and alternate
conductors, to achieve results in the way
of operatic realism which will, in his
picturesque phrase, “electrify Addison
Road and petrify West Kensington.”
The Commodore has recently been
elected President of the Patagonian Phil-
harmonic Society, and in that capacity is
enabled to secure an unlimited supply of
indentured Patagonian vocalists. The
Patagonians are notorious for the extra-
ordinary strength and beauty of their
voices as well as their prodigious stature
and luxuriant chevelure. They sing
only in their native tongue, which greatly
adds to the attractiveness of their
performance. The orchestra will be
composed exclusively of Russians, with
the exception of Lord Dys ART, who
will occasionally assist on the pianola.
It is part of Commodore Gillowson's
scheme to convert the roof of Olympia
into an artificial lake (by draining the
Round Pond and pumping the water
obtained therefrom through celluloid
pipettes), where the audience could
repair in summer between the Acts and
disport themselves in University bathing
costume to the accompaniment of
Ocarinas, mangostines, and mirlitons.
- + * + + +
This colossal enterprise, into which
the Commodore has thrown himself with
hereditary and volcanic energy, has
naturally aroused great excitement in
musical circles. Mr. CHARLES MANNERs,
who has been interviewed on the subject,
sums up the situation in a few pithy
and luminous sentences. “If,” he
remarks, “Commodore GILIowsox's syn-
dicate is really in earnest about buying
Olympia, the Crystal Palace, the Hippo-
drome, the Stolliseum, and the Round
Pond, it seems to me that precautionary
measures should be taken to ascertain
what public support would be likely to
be forthcoming. At any rate I should
advise the utmost caution before em-
barking upon a project which, as expe-
rience has shown, is dreadfully dangerous
in England. If it is hard to secure
patronage for opera in the vernacular,
à fortiori will it be an arduous task to
inculcate a taste for Patagonian in the
cultured purlieus of Addison Road. Be
that as it may be, I wish the syndicate
every success, only adding the needful
warning–Look out for squalls ' "
HINTS TO BATHERS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - Now that the
bathing season is at its height, perhaps
a few practical hints will not be unwel-
come to your readers.
Never bathe between meals. Never
take fright when seized with cramp.
Keep perfectly calm and leave the water
without delay. Never, when actually
drowning, decline the assistance of a
boatman on account of his extortionate
charges. No doubt he places an undue
value on your life, but it is well to sink
one's diffidence in the matter and accept
his estimate, especially as the subject
is open to further discussion on shore.
Unnecessary loss of life, however, is
small compared with the daily sacrifice
of self-respect on the part of grave and
substantial persons whose deportment
in their land clothes is beyond reproach.
To such I would say in all earnestness
– Don't bob about in the water, alter-
nately sitting down on small waves and
dabbing the top of the head.
Refrain also from repulsive distortion
of the features after unexpected immer-
sion by a passing wave. Rise from the
shingle with dignity and cultivate a

calm sweet smile which will retain its
position in salt water.
Finally, I would warn bathers against
the fatal mistake of making acquaint-
ances in the water, for there is no better
concealment of caste than a bathing
costume. What is there, for example,
to show that the weird object on whom
you heap contumely, because in blindly
diving through a wave you brought
your head up sharp against his em-
bonpoint, is the possessor of a stately
title; or, on the other hand, that the
graceful young Adonis whom you com-
pliment for gallantly swimming after
your daughter's water-wings is an assis-
tant at a Bayswater hosier's 2
Yours very truly,
ForewARNED.
THE MAN IN THE STREET.
A NUMBER of streets in Birkenhead
have been named after prominent con-
temporary politicians. The idea is a
good one, and might well be introduced
into London. There would be no need
to change the names of existing streets
or neighbourhoods, however, as these
could with little effort be adapted. Nor
need the idea be confined to political
names—golfers, motorists, cricketers,
artists and even journalists might easily
be included. Thus:–
Marble Archie Maclaren.
Ray Lankester Gate.
Harold Coxspur Street.
Moberley Belgrave Square.
S. F. Edgeware Road.
Knoxford Circus.

Leicester Harmsworth Square.

THE DISTRICT RAILwAY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I see by the Chairman's statement that
the District Railway Company are about to raise their fares.
And not a moment too soon. I have often thought their
first-class rates—a paltry 10, to 2d. per mile—to be absurdly
reasonable. Take, for instance, the 10d. trip from Putney to
the Temple. Why, the mere transit is alone worth the money,
without the liberal perquisites which are thrown in. Thus,
while other railways take you straight ahead in as direct a line
as they can (with the beggarly idea of economising their
motive power) the District Railway not only curls about like a
sea serpent, but swings you from side to side with so reckless
a generosity that you cover about 50 per cent. more ground
than was in the bond.
Then, again, there are its hygienic virtues, regarded as a
body-shaker. No liver can get in at Putney and remain
sluggish beyond Walham Green. Or have you nerves that
need gentle excitation ? Then you may save the expense of
one of those D.V. Vibrators and be jostled till you quiver
like a jelly without paying the smallest supplément.
Have you a taste for luxury of posture? Here you may
learn the asceticism of Assisi : grinding your ribs against the
knife-like edge of a window ledge; jerked this way and that
over the low hip-racks on the side seats; bashing in your
hat-brim against a bare wooden wall if for a moment you
deflect backwards from the perpendicular. And all gratis.
No extra fees in this seminary for fakirs.
Are you purse-proud and exclusive” Here you will learn
that all men of whatever class are equal in the sight of
the conductor. As Pilga would say, en passant, “There is
no first nor third.” You will habituate yourself to the
discipline of rubbing elbows, or even noses, with the
proletariat in the long intervals when the rare inspector-
that new and brilliant innovation—is elsewhere engaged.
The moral gain is inestimable. There is no charge for it.
I cannot say how glad I was to read the Chairman's state-
ment that “They were now practically at the end of their
arduous task, and were looking forward to entering at an
early date on the fruits and rewards of the great efforts they
had made.” I had so feared that, after getting the trains to
run at all, and having developed the “hypaethral” type
of railway station by the removal of a few glass roofs,
they might still have entertained a divine discontent, a
passionate desire to go on to further achievement—to
convert, for instance, their present rattling-stock into vehicles
approximately fitting the lines on which they are expected
to run ; to provide a modicum of human comfort for the
passenger; to confine their first-class compartments to those
who have paid for the right to use them. I rejoice to think
that they propose to do no such thing; that the moral and
physical advantages which I have above enumerated are still
to be the possession of the travelling public.
If only Sir GEORGE GIBB had had a free hand from the first,
things might have been otherwise; but he has arrived too
late to do more than mitigate our glorious privileges.
Yes, Sir, I am glad to know that the Company “are now
practically at the end of their arduous task,” and that all
immediate increase of fares is to be the coping-stone of their toil.
Yours enthusiastically, A PUTNEY TEMPLAR.

THE CURING OF SOCIETY.
Irgendeinbad, August.
DEARESTDAPHNE, - Behold your BLANCHE
living the simple life, while the Powers
that be are doing a cure, though it
seems to me that they only “change the
place and keep the pain,” as Dr. JoHNSON
said–or was it KEATs 2 I always mix
up those two writers, owing, I suppose,
to their both being medical men. This
place, like every other Kurort, would
be immensely improved by the removal
of all the invalids, especially those who
are here for “errors of diet.” (Harley
Street, you know, for over-eating), with
their early hours and general aggravation.
We who are not doing any sort of
cure get through the days with the
help of the Lustgarten, the Spaziergang,
the Casino, and motor-trips into the
country round. FRITZ HUMMEL, the
waltz-man, who is here conducting his
famous band, and is distinctly inclined
to be a darling, helps us to kill time by
beating it vigorously twice a day in the
Lustgarten.
Josi Ah MULTIMILL actually wanted to
join us here, if you ever heard of such
a thing. The idea " No, indeed . This
child's going to have her freedom at
least till she's married, and then she's
going to have it too. I've a perfectly
lovely way of managing him—and, mind
you, my dear, it wants some doing, for
I find he has a will of his own and keeps
a temper seven feet high. Whenever
he wants to do anything that it doesn't
suit me he should do, I simply say
calmly, “It isn't done.”
The Boshi TRESYI LYANs are here, but
are almost useless for social purposes.
WEE-WEE is suffering from cigarette-
heart and motor-face, and is having the
Spoofheim treatment. She sits in a little
cell and is played upon with white and
green rays, and she has to keep silent
for hours, and mustn't be contradicted.
Bosh has nervous indy and golf-ankle,
and is taking volcanic mud-baths.
Among the latestarrivals is the Duchess
of CLACK MANNAN. The dear thing has
been overdoing it simply fearfully for
months with her miracle-play, her roman-
&-clef, her charity-organisings in London,
and her erhaustice articles on Tatting
in The Coronet. (Did you see them 2
They were illustrated by big photo-
gravure-plates, “Tatting by the Duch-
esses; ” and I've heard that the Duchess
of DUNSTABLE sent in such a disgraceful
specimen-bit that they couldn't reproduce
it.) STELLA CLACK MANNAN's cure is quite
an arduous one. As well as having
high-frequency electric brain-baths to
curb her imagination, she has to lie
rigid for hours in a bright violet light,
and she must never think of anything
that isn't violet. She has been followed
here by that ricky Bullyon-Boundermere
woman, who has confided to me that she
is feeling “completely run down" (the
woman's in rude health, but thinks that
bad form), and is doing “exactly the
same cure as the dear Duchess.”
FLUFFY MAINWARING has not gone
yachting to Norway with her husband,
after all. She is here, having the Bosch.
heim treatment for bridge-brow. GILD).
St. ADRIAN (who says he has polo-knee
and has come for the Schierkidding
treatment) is about with her as con-
stantly as he used to be in London.
Meeting them both at the Casino last
night, I said, “Why, FLUFFY, I thought
it was part of your cure to go to bye-bye
with the birds? What price your
bridge-brow, my dear?” “Oh, rats!"
said FLUFFY. “Quite a different set of
facial muscles are used at baccarat'."
I beg to inform you that Prince
GAIOSHKIN is charmant, comme il y en
a peu. We were introduced at Ascot
last year, but I've never met him since
till now. He occupies an entire wing
of the Schloss-Gasthof, and has quite a
fleet of motor-cars with him. He says
he is wandering about “till the troubles
in his unhappy country shall be sup-
pressed.” He talks quite beautifully of
what he would do to stamp out discon-
tent, and “put the lower classes in their
proper place, once for all.” Oh, it does
seem a shame that such a man as Priſce
GALOShKIN should be kept away from
his castles and estates by the rotten coll-
duct of peasants and students and
mujiks, with their risings and Dumas
and things!
His English is excellent, not exactly
broken, only a bit chipped, and, as I
told him yesterday, he is almost as well
versed in the literature of my country
as I am myself. He was so pleased.
He is quite a philosopher, though not of
the same kind as I used to think Nolios
WAVAssoR ;-Norty's views of life are
much more mellow-I don't say they're
quite so piquant.
Fit FFY was saying to-day that the

the time approaches for their rery simple
and rather scanty meals, they are post-

temporary ownership of the Club Bone.
This was a bone supposed to be of great
age which was discovered in a garden
by the Captain, and it was the ambition
of every member to eat it, but, being of
exceptional toughness, it resisted every
attempt. However, when one had
nothing else to do, it was the correct
thing to try to negotiate the Club Bone.
One day, by-the-way, the Club Bone
was missing – it was shortly before the
Captain's death—and, when The Brag-

Two days afterwards it was found hidden

IV.
INTERNAL DISPUTEs.
SoME dogs eat, and drink, and sleep,
and that is all they do. That is not
Life. We dogs of the Club did not sit
all day waiting for something to turn
ll D.
We had Club runs every Monday and
Friday, wet or fine. On Tuesday and
Thursday evenings we hunted the lowly
Cat; we had Sports (such as Head-in-
Lion's-Mouth, Touch-last, French-and-
German, &c., in which the Captain
always excelled) on Wednesdays, and
Conversaziones on Sundays, while Satur-
days were usually devoted to the settling
of our internal disputes.
For we had such disputes, and the
Captain did not altogether discourage
them, for he held that anything was
better than slackness, and therefore did
not prohibit little private scraps. The
only condition he made was that anything
of that sort should take place on a piece
of waste ground at the back of his house.
The Captain would not allow us to fight
among ourselves in the public streets,
as he held that that would lower the
prestige (the word is his) of the Club.
Our principal quarrels concerned the
->
up, Freak Face''' “Who spoke to you,
Bandy Legs?” If the Captain were
present, he would tell us we were behav-
ing like a litter of puppies, and command
us to shut up. Not infrequently a
scuffle between ourselves would have the
pleasant development of a combined
attack on a common enemy who had
stood by jeering.
And sometimes there would be bad
blood between rough-coated and short-
haired members. Especially in the hot
weather. We rough-coated dogs would
become very touchy then, and if, when
we were perspiring profusely and
scarcely able to drag ourselves along, a
little short-haired dog were to trot past
us as cool as a lump of ice and in the
pink of condition, there would be trouble
were he to dare to pity us.
I should mention, before I leave the
subject of internal disputes, that the
most frequent fights were between two
brothers named Robert and James
Brown. They would scarcely ever meet
without falling out. We called them
“The Inseparables,” because, when they
fought, it was impossible to part them.
PERSONAL MATTERs.
Still, as a rule, we got on fairly well
together, and reserved our fighting
energy for our natural enemies, the
Thorough-breeds.
Now and then we would have what
the Captain would call, in his impressive
way, a “Levee en masse”—for he knew
even German, did the Captain but this
would only happen when the honour of
the Club, as a Club, had been assailed.
As regards insults by outsiders to indi-
vidual members of the Club, at first
these had been treated as Club affairs
with the exception of personal remarks
concerning The Map or The International
Fur Stores—but ultimately the Captain
found it necessary to extend the excep-
tion to all of us. So each had to fight
his own fight.
After The Map and The International
Fur Stores, I was kept the most busy.
I was the only thorough-bred member
of the Club, and as such was a special
object of hatred to the enemies of the
Club. I was the recipient each day of
an astonishing number of insults. I
could scarcely move a step from my
house without being called “Blackleg!".
“Traitor'', “Judas!”, and the rest of
the poll-parrot terms. Possibly there
was something in the charge, but I
never stopped to think then. I was the
Captain's man.
It had the effect, anyhow, of my soon
becoming an expert fighter, and, if there
was a desperate errand, the Captain
would usually send me on it. “You
are always as keen as mustard, Ears,"
he has said to me more than once.
Our orders were not to kill, but only to
alter the personal appearance of such
thoroughbreeds as invited our attention.
Killing, the Captain said, was liable to
have unpleasant consequences for our
masters as to whom the Captain, if I
may say it without appearing disrespect-
ful to his memory, was always absurdly

considerate. However, the poor ºld
Hippo was supposed to be a murderer.
One morning, in rounding a corner, he
accidentally collided with a little York-
shire terrier. “Where are you coming
to, you great lout 2" snarled the York-
shire terrier. Now The Hippo was
always short-tempered. Anyhow, the
little Yorkshire terrier was never seen
again, and it was currently believed that
the greater contained the less. When
The Hippo was twitted about it, all he
would say was that till that date he had
never suffered from indigestion.
Coxcºitwix; Toys.
We had special instructions from the
Captain as to our treatment of animals
known as Toy Dogs though why they
are called Dogs I never could under-
stand. At first I used to excite myself
very much when this riff-raff gave them-
selves airs, and would sometimes answer
them back, and more than once proposed
that we should wipe out the entire
brood. But the Captain issued an order
that we were to ignore them. It was,
of course, the best plan. As a rule the
self-important little trollops would
become a picture of impotent rage
under this treatment. The Captain had
just as great contempt for these insects
as I had. “Hundreds and thousands,”
he called them, after the sweets of that
name; and once he said quite truly that
it might be possible to make one decent
dog out of fifty of them. The Captain
liked a dog to be a dog, and not a kid
glove, or a bit of fluff. What drew him
to me originally, he told me, was my
rugged appearance, and he saw at once
that I could be licked into shape. These
so-called Toy Dogs are a disgrace to
their fur, and only bring the rest of us
into disrepute. They are a painful
sight under any circumstances, but, if
you want to see a second-hand remnant,
look at one of them after he has been
out in the rain. Yet they are over-
weeningly conceited, and at times I have
found it difficult to obey the Captain's
instructions. Once, actually, a weedy
youth named Carlo told me that the
reason why I ignored him was that I
dared not touch him. At that I could
not help it, it was a distinct challenge –
I took Master Carlo in my mouth, and
shook him like a rat until he holloaed
for mercy. I could never make up my
mind whether Carlo was more like a
mosquito or a penwiper. He was known,
I believe, as a Butterfly Dog. The
Butterflies are welcome to such as he,
with his petulant little falsetto voice.
We were, as I have said, to ignore
the Toy Dogs. But there was one
exception. We were to strip them of
any finery they might be wearing. The
Captain was a martinet in all matters
of dress. He would tolerate nothing
Seedy Sam (threateningly). “No, MUM, I AN'T h \p A BITE Foº Tinze days, AN' I won't

but a collar—and that must be a plain
one. The Toy Dogs would frequently
wear bows, and were supposed to be
responsible for that absurd expression,
which riles us so much, “bow-wows.”
So the Captain made a rule that, when-
ever we met a dog wearing a bow, we
were to remove it—which was easily
done by tugging at one end of the
ribbon—and bring it to the Club.
Birthday or no birthday, it had to come
off. When a member had fifty bows to
his credit, he was absolved from this duty,
which was considered a somewhat menial
one ; he became a veteran, for whom
sterner tasks were reserved. Now and
then we would secure a collar, and a
Collar Day was always a great event,
with us. By-the-by, we were puzzled
to know what to do with the accumula-
tion of ribbons until The Hog joined us.
He kept on eating them till he died of
appendicitis.

of a fine story. Mr. MAxwell, writes well; he can hold the
interest of his readers, and he has a strong gift for dramatic
episode. This is the story of Mr. Burgoyne, the last survivor
of the great band of Victorian men of science, of his young
wife Sybil, who served him and guarded the flame of his life,
and of her guilty love for her husband's secretary, Stone, and
the tragedy that comes of it. Here are all the elements of
drama. Yet must I put in a careat. Though there is drama
there is also-I wish I could find another word-mawkishness.
Mawkishness is in the relations between Mr. Burgoyne and his
wife; Stone, the faithless secretary, is a mass of mawkishness;
and after the storm and stress of the tragedy the happy
peaceful ending of the story comes with a suggestion of the
same quality. I incline to think that waywardness and
guilty love are best treated in the manner of FLAUBERT. I am
loth, however, to end with fault-finding. I realize gratefully
that Mr. MAxwell has given us a fine piece of work, and I
look forward with high anticipation to his next book.
A Sorereign Remedy (HEINEMANN) is original in its con-
struction, strong in its characterisation, admirably written.
It might be described as a powerful novel but for a not
immaterial defect. It recalls the image whose body was
fashioned of brass, its feet being clay. The defect pre-
sents itself in the main episode of the story, where Aura
rejects the proffered love of Lord Blackborough and accepts
the hand of Ted ('ruttenden. It is nothing that one is a peer
of boundless wealth, the other one of his clerks. Love laughs
at contrasts of that kind. Where the vital difference comes
in is that the peer is a chivalrous gentleman, the clerk a
thorough cad, and not quite honest at that. Aura, a girl of
fine instinct, superlative purity of mind and body, recognises
the difference; she admittedly loves Lord Blackborough-and
marries Ted ('ruttenden. Novel readers must not be too
exigeant in the matter of probability. When they take up
the latest thing in story writing they are charmed to find
romance. But this is really too much, and is not made more
satisfactory by Mrs. STEEL's somewhat vague explanation of
from Gwalia's cloud-topped mountains roll down tumultuous
Streams.
Mr. Hugh CLIFFORD has written other books—memorable
books they are too--but if he had written nothing but
Heroes of Erile (SMITH, ELDER) he would still have deserved
the gratitude of the reading public in ample measure. He
tells
Of old unhappy far-off things,
And battles long ago,
stories of hardly-recorded heroisms and toils and almost
forgotten sufferings and obscure achievements; and the
style in which he tells these stories has a gallant brisk
adventurous movement splendidly fitted to the substance
with which it deals. Mr. CLIFFord has seen the haunts and
cities of many men, and his experience in all his lands of
travel has not blunted the fine edge of his sympathy or
robbed him of insight into thought and emotion. The book
is a liberal education in feeling and a corrective to the
pessimism that speaks of romance as a thing of the past.
There are men at this moment, unknown poor men, some-
where in the world, who are hewing out their blocks of
unregarded fame. The world may pass them by, but if by
some fortunate chance Mr. CLIFFord should become their
historian they will not have lived and suffered in vain.
Such at any rate is the feeling of one reader as he reluctantly
lays down Heroes of Erile.
In a day of shilling shockers and halfpenny newspapers
it is pleasing to learn that The World's Classics (Oxford
University Press) have found a million and a half purchasers.
The library, complete within itself, includes such varied
gems as LAMB's Essays, Pope's Odyssey, Borrow's Bible in
Spain, Hol.MEs's Autocrat, Pendemnis, BURRE's Works, and
GEORGE HERBERT's Poems. Encouraged by this success, Mr.

THE WEARING OF THE WHISKER.
(A bare-faced retort.)
[Our contemporary, The Lady, has been informed, to her great regret,
that “woman's admiration for the man with the clean-shaven face is
waning, and that a revival of the detestable moustache is imminent.”
“If it is really true,” says The Lady, “I hope it will not stop at the
moustache. Whiskers have not been worn for thirty years, and they
could be made quite dandified and D'Orsayish if reintroduced."]
Not for myself the horror when I hear
Of this insensate freak of mobile Fashion ;
I have been shaved, clean-shaved, this many a year,
And still propose to cut the frequent gash on
My patient face, nor grow
Side-trimmings or a rude moustachio.
Woman (whose tastes I never had the tongue
Rightly to chant, nor yet the wit to follow)
May choose to let her fingers sport among
The facial growths of some unshorn Apollo,
Trained like the ampelopsis,
That happy haunt of woolly bears and wopses:
Woman, I say, her Paradise may seek
On downy lips; she may elect to risk her
Complexion up against a hairy cheek,
Wiping its bloom away with tufts of whisker;
And, should she so incline,
Then that is her affair and none of mine.
My trouble is that men whom I admire,
Whose open countenances, clean as whistles,
Suggest the late Sir Josht A's angel choir,
May join the mode and take to rearing bristles,
And thus could never be
The same, ah! never more the same, to me!
If ASQUITH, say, were snared in Fashion's net,
And (coarsely speaking) chucked the legal type up,
And, to appease the ardent suffragette,
Assumed the shaggy semblance of a Skye-pup,
I could not well be mute,
And lightly bear to see him so hirsute.
I think the spectacle would drive me mad
Should WINSTON's cherub cheeks be flanked with
-- weepers,”
Or BIRRELL to his mutton cutlets add
A supplemental pair of pendent creepers,
The kind that might recall
Wistaria hanging from a cottage wall.
Or what if MoRLEY fledged his lips with fluff,
To captivate some Oriental peril
Or Edward GREY, exchanging smooth for rough,
Developed droopers like my Lord Dundreary,
And in the dui)ious dark
Confused himself with Whiskerandos CLARKE!
But worst, if HALDANE (hairless heretofore),

And keen to compliment that Lord of War
By imitation, most sincere of flatteries,
Should wear, for England's sake,

NATURE STUDIES.
The DEPARTURE OF THE NURSERY.
The departure has been fixed for the 10 A.M. train, and
the eventual destination is a village on the Suffolk coast.
For a full week the nursery has been in a condition of
feverish but suppressed excitement. Bathing suits and
shoes, wooden spades, gaudy and battered tin pails, the
mementoes of former visits, have been painfully rummaged
out of their hiding places. The talk has been of shells and
waves and emeralds, not the emeralds of Bond Street, but
the roughened and rounded fragments of ancient bottles
which are to be found on nearly all self-respecting beaches.
The Dandie Dinmont has had a little suit of “waders ”
manufactured for him. He had them tried on, a mournful
ceremony to which he submitted with a bad grace, and for
which he took compensation by retiring to a remote bush
and tearing his suit to rags. Special dolls have been selected
to accompany the trip. The white bear, a magnificently-
jointed animal, provided internally with a most unursine
squeak, has been definitely informed that he is to be left
behind, and has been bundled away into a cupboard lest his
feelings should be lacerated by the preparations for a flitting
in which he is not to bear a part. Surreptitious packing has
been proceeding for some days, for it is a nursery axiom that
if you are going away for a fortnight you spread your pack-
ing over about a week so that nothing may be forgotten– a
plan that invariably results in the omission of many indis-
pensable articles. Yesterday, however, the packing was duly
completed, and in order that no time might be wasted an
ancient retainer was despatched to London with the luggage
of the whole family in order that he might be ready with it
at Liverpool Street on the following morning. This having
been done, the nursery retired to bed early in order that it
might have strength for the troubles of the morrow.
You would have thought that under these circumstances
there would have been no particular necessity for an early
rising. The nursery, however, would have felt itself dis-
graced if it had remained a-bed up to the usual hour. At
6 A.M., therefore, the whole department of three children and
two nurses was awake and shouting. At 6.30 it was fully
dressed, and the youngest, aged three, skirmished along the
passage to the bedroom of her parents, and dispelled their
sleep with many irrelevant and disconnected statements
delivered at the top of her voice. She was immediately
followed by her sisters, aged six and four-and-a-half, who,
observing that their father and mother were still in bed,
burst into tears, and declared that they could not possibly
catch the train. All three then retired under protest and
breakfasted in a hurry at 7 A.M.
After this followed the most solemn rite of the whole
ceremony of departure. The three children were vigorously
taken in hand and arrayed for the journey. Their hats were
put on, their hands were encased in gloves, each was pro-
vided with a small basket tightly packed with mysteries, and
they were then set down in three chairs in a row against the
wall of the day nursery and were forbidden to move, while
their nurses busied themselves about those aimless nothings
which make nursery life immediately before a journey so
full of incident and variety. It was now 8.15 A.M. The
train was to start, as I have said, at 10. The station was
close at hand; the tickets had been taken; a compartment
had been reserved. For one hour and a half the three sat
portentously in their chairs, a lesson in discipline and the
suppression of the emotions. At 9.45 the assemblage rose
as one girl on a signal from the nurse, and immediately
afterwards a dejected procession of seven moved towards the
station. As the train steamed out the chief nurse flushed a
deep red, thus signifying that she had forgotten the soda-
water bottle filled with milk.

THE NEW PAUPERS.
The Times having rashly committed
itself to the statement that “the neces-
saries of life can be bought for £2,000
a year,” and The Mail having contrari-
wise affirmed on the authority of a
doctor that a Londoner with that income
is usually one of the poorest and most
miserable men in the city, it has occurred
to Mr. Punch to ascertain the opinions
of a number of representative men with
a view to clearing up the question.
Mr. John Bºxs, M.P., kindly replied
to our query in the following terms:
“No man, as a great writer once stated,
is worth more than £500 a year. There-
fore if a man has £2000 a year he ought
to do the work of four men. This,
however, is directly contrary to the
fundamental principles of Trade Union-
ism, and therefore absurd. But it can
be done all the same.”
Mr. Rock EFELLER writes: “I can quite
believe that a man may be miserable on
£2000 a year if he is troubled by an
uneasy conscience. On the other hand
a mens conscia recti will ensure perfect
happiness to the multimillionaire.”
Mr. HALL CAINE writes: “It all depends
how the money is made. An inherited
income, though of modest dimensions,
is often an incentive to indolence and
indirectly promotes misery. Work is
the salt of life, and the lot of a man who
earns even £1500 a year by writing pure
and noble novels is infinitely more
enviable than that of the plutocrat who
battens on the forced labour of under-
paid employees.”
Mr. T. P. O'CoxNor writes: “History,
trumpet-tongued, proclaims the eternal
truth that happiness is independent of
wealth. ("ATO of Utica, the Man of Ross,
Mii.TON, JoAN of ARC, MARTIN LUTHER,
have all contributed to my columns, yet
none of them had £2000 a year, and who
shall venture to say that they were either
poor or unhappy Ž I have myself known
many brave men and beautiful women,
but I can unhesitatingly assert that the
bravest and most beautiful were those
who lived the simplest and most frugal
lives. I know two Bishops who have never
dined at the Carlton, and only last week
I met a peer—whose pedigree goes back
to CEDR1c --on the top of a motor-bus.”
Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN has expressed his
sentiments in the following limpid quota-
tion:
“Whether we live in a gold-reef city
Or merely exist in a lowly cot,
Life is one long melodious ditty
If we are content with what we've got.”

LEwis MoRRIs contributes this priceless

Two thousan pounds a year should be con-
sidered poverty.”

Mr. CHARLES MANNERs, the famous
impresario and basso, expresses himself ||
with his usual pithy brevity:
“Let us clear our minds of cant, for ||
in a problem of such complexity clear
and honest thinking is an indispensable
precautionary preliminary. Is national
opera in the vernacular a necessity or a
luxury 2 If, as all patriotic Englishmen
are agreed, it is to be relegated to the
former category, then the question
assumes the simple form, Can a man
afford to support national opera on
£2,000 a year?' To any individual of
lucid brain and normal powers of
ratiocination the answer must be as plain
as a pitchfork, and I will not insult the
intelligence of your gentle readers by
gratuitously propounding a self-evident
proposition.”
Dr. CLIFFORD writes: “The question
of the minimum income largely depends
on the attitude of its possessor towards
the Bill of 1902. Passive resistance,
where magistrates decline to enforce an
order, certainly makes for economy.
Personally I am inclined to believe that
a passive resister, if he is a vegetarian
and teetotaller and dispenses with a
motor-car, may rub along upon even
less than £2,000 a year.”

PUTTING THE QUESTION.
A Romance of Two Hearts.
SHE was beautiful; I think she was
the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.
No description of mine could convey to
you any idea of her charm, her fresh-
ness, her completeness.
Her dress—well, there, perhaps, mere
words might help. Not words of mine,
though ; for to me it only mattered that
she looked charming, and as she ought
to look. (And—yes, I fancy the colour
of it was white. White, with—or stay ;
was it not black 2 But, there, it was
not of her dress that I was thinking".
I had a question to put to her. You
will guess what it was ; the old, old
question that is asked (somewhere in
the world) every hour of the day--n: y,
almost every minute. I think she knew
that I was about to ask her that question.
With her woman's intuition she seen.ed
to read into my soul; and, as she raised
her eyes to mine and then dropped them
again hurriedly, I felt that she was say-
ing to herself: “Will it be now 2 Yes,
surely it will be now !”
Even as she knew the question that
was in my mind, so did I know what
her answer would be; indeed I seemed
already to hear the whispered “Yes.”
A man gets to know these things, though
it were hard to explain how. I knew
it would be “Yes,” yet I hesitated ; per-
haps just because the answer was so
certain. Was I justified in asking
her? -
The advice is often given: “In affairs
of the heart, be guided by the heart";
but in this case it was (alas!) as much
an affair of the purse. To put it brutally
-—could I afford not to ask her that
question ? If I did not ask her, dare I
risk the alternative? For I was in debt
as it was. I owed money . . .
She was waiting for me. I could sce
that the silence distressed her. She
raised her lovely eyes to mine again,
and there was a beseeching look in
them. “Speak, speak,” they seemed to
say. “Anything but this.”
“In affairs of the heart, be guided by
the heart.” I remembered those words.
Yes, that should be my motto. I took
a deep breath, looked her straight in
the eyes, and said :
“May I play to hearts, partner?”
“Oh yes, please,” she said. “I thought
you had gone to sleep.”
“Lucky I didn't double,” I thought,

THE CHAUFFEUR AS CRIMINAL.
(How to detect him.)
A correspondext writes: – Doubtless
the interest of your readers has been
awakened by the recent case of the
stolen motor car, and many, in view of
the substantial rewards offered, would
willingly act as amateur motor-detectives
but for their ignorance of the technique
of the machinery. Such knowledge,
however, I hold to be unnecessary if the
conduct and appearance of chauffeurs be
closely and intelligently studied, and
the following hints may be of service to
holiday makers who at present cannot
recognise a criminal chauffeur when
they see him.
Suspect all chauffeurs with clean nails
and a hunted expression.
Suspect the chauffeur who deliberately
runs his car into a ditch and makes off
across country.
Suspect the chauffeur who offers to
sell you his car for fifteen shillings and
the price of a drink.
Suspect the chauffeur who when
pulled up in a country lane and asked
for his licence explains the lack of it by
saying “he is merely minding the car for
an unknown gentleman.”
Suspect the chauffeur who sheds tool
box, lamps and cushions along the road
to lighten the car and increase the pace.
Suspect the chauffeur who throws his
foot-pump at your head when you
courteously inform him that his number
is obliterated by dust.
Suspect the chauffeur who, when you
invite his confidence as to his ultimate
destination, cannot look you fairly in the
goggle.
Finally, suspect the chauffeur whose
suit, when his motor-coat flies open,
reveals a pattern of broad arrows.

ONOMATOP(EI.A.
A cFRTAIN Socialist, being pursued by
a band of infuriated Cossacks, fled to
the shop of a friend that was a Glass
Merchant. “Hide me,” he said to him,
"for if my pursuers take me they will
surely kill me.”
Now that Glass Merchant was a man
of a certain shrewdness and a very
º mind. He took the Socialist to
is store-room where were six sacks.
Five of these sacks were full of broken
glass, but in the sixth (which was empty)
he bade the Socialist lie hid. “Your
pursuers,” he said, “will look into the
first and the second sack, may look into
the third and fourth, but will not by
any chance look into the fifth and sixth.”
In the sixth sack, therefore, the Socialist
hid himself.
After a short while the pursuers
rushed into the shop crying, “Where is
that Socialist 2 ''
“There is no Socialist here,” answered
the Glass Merchant; “but search the
house if you will.”
They searched accordingly, and their
suspicion first alighted upon the six
sacks. Many looked into the first two,
some into the first three, and one into
the first four, but none looked into them
all. However, one of the soldiers being
used to ruses in general, and having
read books in his youth, plunged his
sword into the first sack, and into the
second, and into the third, and into the
fourth, and into the fifth sack, which
were (as has been said) full of broken
glass. Then he plunged his sword into
the sixth sack.
And the Socialist within said: “Tinkle,
tinkle.”
SOCIETY STATISTICS.
The “dernier chic" in the Continental
papers is to give the exact horse-power
of the autos belonging to the motorists
of Society who are travelling from place
to place. But why limit these enthral-
ling statistics to motor-cars? Why not
report, for instance, that—

bound Saratoga trunks and her 14-stone

or that—
Mr. BELSHAzzAR Joxes, when last seen
on Margate Pier, was carrying a 20-mile
telescope, with his 10-drink thirst
practically unimpaired.
A CAUSE CELEBRE.
THERE resided at the Palace of a certain
Prince an officer known as the Chief
Scribe, whose duty it was to keep a daily
record of what went on there. No one
ever read his records, because everybody
about the Court was as fully aware of
the facts as he was ; and he was accus-
tomed to declare that he wrote for
posterity - a mere piece of grandilo-
quence, since he could profit nothing
by its verdict, nor had he any certain
hope that posterity would read him at
all. The hypocrisy of the creature pre- |
sently appeared in that he began to add
to the bare register sundry glosses of
his own, of such a character as he deemed
likely to compel the attention of his
contemporaries. And thereupon he
quickly grew in importance, especially
amongst the sensitive artist-folk with
whom the Palace was always crowded,
from the Chief of the Jesters himself
down to the youngest dancing-girl; so
that before long, if anyone perchance
discovered the prima donna in tears, he
at once procured a copy of the Gazette
to look there for the cause of them. But
when one day it was written therein of
the fairest damsel in the chorus that
the name of artist was too high a title
to be fitly bestowed upon her, there
was a great uproar; and the full strength
of that galaxy of prettiness, considering
themselves all equally affronted, waited
upon the Chief of the Jesters and would
in no wise let him rest until he had
promised to complaim to the Prince on
their behalf. For the Prince was not
only the sole fountain of Justice in that
country, but eminently qualified by his
taste and erudition to decide that very
question.
The Chief of the Jesters found the
Prince in his library, searching, as his
wont was, for new ideas to be imposed
as legislation upon a contented people.
On the approach of his Minister, how-
ever, he pushed away the folio over
which he |. been poring, and listened
attentively.
“And I suggest,” said the Chief of
the Jesters, in conclusion, “that the
Chief Scribe should be cited to appear
before your Highness to answer this.”
“What does the knave say for him-
self?” asked the Prince, amused.
“He calls it fair comment upon a
matter of public interest, or some such
catch-phrase,” replied the other.
“It's a long time since we had any-
thing to try—except a poacher or two,”
said the Prince. “I think it would be
interesting.”
“Then your Highness will appoint a
day to hear the cause 2"
“One moment,” said the Prince,
tapping the volume he had just put
down. “In this book there is an
account of the judiciary of a people who
hold their tribunals to be far superior to
those of all their neighbours; and I find
that, with them, suits involving the con-
sideration of the fine arts are decided by
twelve honest gentlemen of the shop-
keeping class, with minds quite unbiassed
by any previous knowledge whatever of
such matters. The idea seems to me to
have much to recommend it, and I really
haven't altered the constitution of this
realm for nearly two days.”
“As your Highness pleases,” said the
Chief of the Jesters, with a sigh.
The Prince did not sit very often in
the seat of justice, since he embodied in
his own person exclusive legislative as
well as judicial functions, and constantly
found it simpler to repeal a statute than
to interpret it; but there was, neverthe-
less, in the Palace a large basilica which
was set apart for the hearing of petitions.
And here on a certain day he took his
place in the centre of the apse, to preside
over the trial; having first been at
much pains thoroughly to inform himself
of the kind of judicial deportment mºst
in vogue with the nation of which he
had spoken. Below the dais, in the
order of their degree, were grouped the
nobles and officials of the Household;
and the body of the hall was filled with
the professional comrades of the plain-
tiff, and with the jeunesse dorée, who
were her sworn adherents. And not
far from the Prince's chair sat the

Princess, who deemed that in cases of
this kind her watchful presence tended
to keep the pure stream of justice from
being pent up within the lock-gates of
gallantry. She had forgotten, however,
that under the new order of things
which the Prince had dug out of his
library the decision as to the beautiful
girl's plaint rested no longer with his
susceptible Highness, but with the twelve
shopkeepers from the nearest town, who
had been conveyed (after a stout resis-
tance) to the Palace, and were now
seated at the Prince's right hand, not
displeased, after all, to find themselves
in so conspicuous a situation and
amongst so brilliant a company.
“Yes,” said the Prince (though nobody
had spoken), “go on, please.” -
The Chief of the Jesters, as the next
friend of the plaintiff (CLYTIE was the
minx's name), thereupon rose and ad-
dressed himself to the task of instructing
the twelve shopkeepers wherein pre-
cisely consisted her claim to be called
an artist. And to this end, having
finished at length with ARIsroTLE, he
passed on to read copious extracts from
the excellent treatise of LuciaN on the
Art of Dancing; and when he had laid
under contribution all the Ancients who
by any ingenuity could be made to
throw any light upon the matter he
adroitly alluded to many respectable
personages who had practised the art
of pantomime, not forgetting, of course,
the great Empress Theodor A, nor the
inventor of the ballet, Master BALTASAR
DE BEAUJoyEUx, who was chief musician
to the Queen of FRANCE. From this he
went on to describe the divers kinds of
dances, antique as well as modern ;
beginning with the corybantic measures
of Cybele, and ending with the courante
aforetime performed at the court of the
Grand Monarch, Louis THE FourTEENTH.
Their several intricacies and difficulties
of accomplishment he duly insisted
upon ; and passing thence to eulogise
the professional achievement of Clytie
herself he concluded an eloquent perora-
tion by asking the bewildered twelve
whether it might not truly be avouched
of her (in the words of CAssiodorus) that
she had “manus loquacissimae, linguosi
digiti.”
“Who is CLYTIE 2" said the PRINCE at
this point, just as if he had not seen
ler name upon the satin playbills of the
Palace a score of times.
It was now the turn of the Chief
Scribe to justify that which he had
Written of the plaintiff; and though it
is impossible to set down here a tithe of
what he said it can readily be under-
stood that he was not to be outdone
either in length or in learning. It will
suffice to say that he had no difficulty in
throwing scorn upon all stage-dancers

history to witness that the entertain-
ments in which such dreadful people
took part had ever been obstacles to the
progress of serious Art. Nor must it be
imagined that the Prince was silent
during all the hours that the speeches
lasted ; he had learned what belonged
to a bench, and sparkled at frequent
intervals with many a learned quip.
Only the twelve shopkeepers never
uttered a single word all day, partly,
indeed, because there were not a great
many that they had understood.
“Consider your verdict, Gentlemen,”
said the Prince.
The poor shopkeepers put their aching
heads together. More hours went by,
and when daylight failed they were still
mumbling amongst themselves.
Prince was about to give them in custody
of the Palace Guard, when a strange
thing happened. CLYTIE herself, leaning
whatever, however illustrious; calling
on the arm of a young gallant of noble
The
lineage, came into the hall, and summon-
ing a blush announced to the Prince
that she was about to be married
immediately.
“That's nothing to do with the case,”
said the Prince.
“Oh yes, your Highness!” smiled the
girl, “I don't care now the least little
bit what that grumpy old Chief Scribe
said about me as an artist.”
The other members of the chorus, all
equally affronted, and not about to be
married immediately, groaned in unison.
The Prince, though a little disappointed
at the discontinuance of the suit aſter
his elaborate preparations, could uot
forbear a smile.
“I think perhaps she is right,” he
said, thoughtfully; “after all, art, except
in some of its phases, is only a means to
an end; and, once the end is achieved,
the means may be regarded as no longer
worth considering.”

A CISTERCIAN ABBEY.
Extract from the Trarel Diary of Toby, M.P.
By Beaulieu River. — There is a cer-
tain analogy between Beaulieu River
and the hunted hare. In both cases
a preliminary to full enjoyment is that
you “catch it.” To the inexperienced
eye there is no point at which one can say
the Solent ends and the river begins.
You steam or sail awhile, and lo! there
are banks on either side, and your
barque is on the Beaulieu River. A
beautiful stream it is at full tide, wind-
ing with generous bends through im-
memorial woods, with here and there
a cosy house nestling in umbrageous
depths. On the way we pass Buckler's
Hard, a century ago one of the principal
building yards of the Royal Navy. To-
day it is forsaken, cherishing amongst its
memories the building and launching
ºf NFLsox's Victory, now a sheer hulk
in Portsmouth Harbour.
Beaulieu Abbey stands at the head
ºf the navigable stretch of the river.
The monks of old had a keen eye for
desirable building sites. Never were
they happier in choice than in fixing
on the strip of the New Forest on which
this Cistercian homestead was built.
According to a learned authority, Mon-
asticon Anglicanum, King John was the
founder of the Abbey, an event brought
about under picturesque circumstances.
Disliking and distrusting the growing
power of the Cistercian monks, he, in
the year 1204, genially bade the Abbots
take counsel with him at Lincoln. When
they were all counted in, he gave his
bodyguard orders to cut up the lot. The
pious soldiers forebore. The Abbots
fled, and the King had a very bad night.
| He dreamed he was summoned before
a judge who condemned him to be
scourged by the Abbots. They per-
formed the duty with such energy that
when his Majesty woke in the morning
he sorely smarted from the blows. Taking
the hint, fearing even worse things in
a future state, he made his peace by
undertaking to build an abbey at Beau-
lieu and endow the holy Order therewith.
For more than 600 years the hospi-
tality of Beaulieu has been sought by and
graciously extended to Royalty. The
latest visitors of this class were the
young King and Queen of SPAIN, who
found an opportunity among the gaieties
of Cowes Week to spend a day under
the roof of the latest Lay-Abbot. HENRY
The Third was frequently here. Edward
The FIRST took so many meals in the
refectory that, feeling uneasy at the
expense his reception entailed on the
monks, he took a step which brings
into bold relief the consideration and
generosity of Kings. He issued an edict
granting immunity to the Abbey of
Beaulieu from the necessity of entertain-
ing any other wayfarers. As in those
good old days abbeys and monasteries
were bound to give free food and lodging
to passing man and beast, this gracious
thoughtfulness on the part of His Majesty
handsomely balanced the account.
On July 4, 1789, there came to Beau-
lieu quite another royal cortèſe, record
of which is preserved to this day in
the family archives. Palace House, the
stately residence adjoining the ruined
Abbey, a portion of it part of the ancient-
structure, was then the seat of the Duke
of MoSTAGU, ancestor of the present Lay-
Abbot, who so small the world is in
addition to his ancient episcopal dignity
and responsibilities is one of the highest
living authorities on the modern science
of motoring. The Duke's guests were
His Majesty King GEORGE THE THIRD,

the PRINCESS Roy AL, the Princesses
Eliz ABETH, AUGUSTA, and SoPhi A. Rex,
in kingly way, rode on horseback,
escorted by the Duke's tenants bearing
eolours and white wands. The Prin-
cesses drove in coaches accompanied by
six running footmen in scarlet livery.
As the guests entered the hospitable
doors the royal standard was run up,
hailed by a salute of 21 guns fired
from His Majesty's 74-gun battleship
Illustrious ready for launching at
Buckler's Hard. “Their Majesties par-
took of a handsome cold collection,” so
the chronicler hath it. Two hours they
stayed, and were conducted on their
homeward way with the feudal state
that greeted their arrival.
Another leaf from this yellow-tintel,
quaintly-written page of history tells
how, on July 5, 1833, “their royal high-
nesses the Duchess of KENT and the
Princess VICTORIA honoured Beaulieu
with a visit.” Little did l3eaulieu think
at the time of all that awaited this little
lady, just in her teens, or dreamt of
the mightv changes she would live to
see worked in the Empire she was, four
years later, called upon to rule.
Not much is left standing of King
John's penitential offering, the glorious
structure his successor HENRY Till. Thiºn
completed. What remains of the cloisters
testifies to its singular beauty. Years
ago the Abbey became the appanage of
a scion of the Mox TAGU family, who
devoted years of a long peaceful life to
the preservation and restoration of the
ruined walls. OL") MoRTALITY did not
carry out his work with gentler, more
discriminating touch than he. Less than
a year ago the task was ended. To-day
the Labourer rests in the silence and
seclusion of the roofless chapter house,
in the companionship of nameless Abbots
who lived and ruled at Beaulieu before
HENRY THE EIGHTH made short work of
monks and monasteries. Of their story
nothing remains told on the weather-
beaten stones that cover their graves.
A TIMELY REMINDER.
DEAR, do you ever think of me,
And of our last brief interview

But after half-past two 2
“Sweet, do you love me?” soft and low
I whispered and was promptly met
By an uncompromising “No ' " -

Time in his course has healed the blow.
There have been others since; and yet
Il feel, at times, a passing glow
()f not unmixed regret.
And oft, when it is not quite three,
But nearer that than half-past two,
I wonder, “1)ocs she think of me?”

THE NEWSMAKER.
I Fot ND him at work in his study, the
sole furniture of which was a table, a
chair, an ink-pot and a gazetteer.
“All I need,” he remarked pleasantly,
“added to my own creativeness; ” and
he tapped his forehead sagely. “Here
is a little thing of mine, for example, in
this morning's paper,” and he drew my
attention to the following paragraph :--
MYSTERIOUS I)is APPEARANCE.
Another curio's disappearance is reported
from Bristol, where a young woman, the
daughter of respectable parents, and herself
bearing the best of characters, has suddenly
been lost sight of. She left her home on
Monday afternoon to buy a new blouse and
has never been heard of since. Her height is
five feet seven ; she has auburn hair, and was
wearing a blue linen dress and clothes marked
E.T.
“I invented that,” he said. “It is
not true; but why should it be 2 It is
readable and reasonable, and what more
can you ask of a newspaper ? Even if
the Editors knew it was untrue they
would not complain. They know that
these are the things that circulation is
built on. ‘Take care of the suicides and
the minor phenomena of life,' is our
motto, theirs and mine, and the news
from St. Petersburg will take care of
itself.’ So they go on paying me. For
every reader who wants to know how
the SULTAN is, there are a thousand who
are interested in a mad dog at Hexham
or a mysterious occurrence at Wend-
over.”
“How do you settle on the places?”
I asked.
“With the gazetteer,” he replied.
“It is very simple. I just choose the
non-committal towns. Small towns and
villages I am careful about, and I rarely
give a name to the victims. Curiously
enough there are some towns where
nothing interesting or romantic or tragic
can ever happen. Weybridge is one,
Chislehurst is another; whereas there
are others just made for mystery.
“When I am in a very daring mood
I keep to London or the Colonies. For
instance, I have recently composed this:
*
ForTu NE's FAvot RITE.
News comes from New South Wales of a
lucky windfall. A cooper recently bought at
an auction sale a grandfather's clock for ſour-
teen shillings. When he came to repair it he
decided that the weights were too heavy, and
therefore prised them open to reduce their
contents, which he assumed to be, as is usual,
shot. Judge of his surprise to find that each
weight was filled with sovereigns. The old
woman whose property the clock had been
having left no relations, the treasure trove
belongs to the cooper. The incident should
give furniture dealing an impetus it sadly
needs.
“Here is a paragraph that I had just
finished composing when you came in :
REMARKABLE ACCiDENT.
A labouring man near Wolverhampton has
just sustained a serious injury in a very curious
manner. As he was returning from work last
evening a swallow flew into his face, completely
destroying the sight of his left eye with the
force of its beak.
“Now that will be copied into most
of the papers, and some of them will
have little notes on the subject. The
Lanect will say something about the
danger of walking about where birds
are in the habit of flying. Gradually
it will get round the world. Then it
will re-enter upon its career, and by-
and-by will get into books of natural
history. No very determined attempt
will be made to deny it, Wolverhampton
being a large place and it not being
worth anyone's while to follow the
matter up.
“Here's another, which is all ready
to begin its rounds:--
A MoDERN HighwAY MAN.
As a farmer in Co. Wexford was driving to
market last Wednesday, he was overtaken by
a cyclist who, seizing the horse's head, pulled
out a revolver and demanded a sovereign.
The farmer, deeming discretion the better part
of valour, gave it to him, mentally deciding to
put the police on his track as soon as he could;
but though a vigoroº's search has been prose-
cuted no arrest has yet been made.
“That, I think, bears the impress of
truth on every line; but it is all inven-
tion. And why not? Again I say, what
does it matter what you read about total
strangers so long as it is interesting
and sounds reasonable 2 I would under-
take single-handed to fill any paper
with good serviceable and credible but
wholly untrue news every morning and
not be found out.
“It was I, by the way, who invented
the earthquake shocks in Wilts the
other day. Of course there were none;
but there might have been. Mine is
what I call the loophole school of
journalism. There is always a chance
that it is true, and no one being directly
assailed in pocket there is no serious
contradiction.”
“And how does it pay you?” I asked.
“I am paid ordinary exchange rates,"
he said. “Moreover, I have the enter-
tainment too. It is not only my business
but my hobby. Some men keep yachts,
some endow reading-rooms, some collect
postage-stamps. My hobby is to invent
news and get it accepted as fact. The
papers are full of my work every morning.
and I take a pleasure in reading it which
that of no author of books can surpass."
The Manchester Erening News reports
that “brilliant silk neckties have come
to the front again.” This should put
a stop to the fashion, so popular with
old gentlemen, of wearing them under
the left ear.

Few, I expect, have any idea of the
number of Dogs' Clubs there are in
existence. All big towns are honey-
combed with them.
We were specially down on foreigners,
and as a rule there would be short
shrift for Schipperkes, melancholy
Danes, Chows, Dachshunds, Poodles,
Pekinese Spaniels, Maltese Terriers,
Russian Boar-hounds, Spitz dogs, and
the rest of the undesirable aliens. I
recollect well my scrap with Liane de
Pougy. She was a poodle. All poodles
are either fops or clowns. Liane was
a ſop, and a saucy one at that. She
had long ropes of hair reaching to the
ground. One day, by way of retort to
my quite harmless remark, “Get your
hair cut !” she had the cheek to reply
in broken English, “Go 'ome an' wash
you ze dirty face ' " That got my blood
up, and with the words, “Your face is
as dirty as mine, you filthy brunette, if
we could only see it !” I rushed at Liame
and did some amateur hair-cutting my-
self, entirely removing some of the ropes
and shortening others, even though her
owner jabbed at me all the time with
her parasol. You never saw such a
piece of shabby finery as was Liame
when I had done with her; and it was
not the slightest good her reminding me
stance, I remember we were having
sports, and a dachshund named Hans
Blumberg crawled up and stood watch-
ing us longingly, and finally had the
cool audacity to ask if he might join in.
“No,” said the Captain, sharply. “We
don't play with centipedes, specially
German ones,” and then we all barked
at him in concert, and he ran away
terrified, to complain to his Kaiser.

snout to the tail I am bored.
And I found King Charles Spaniels
especially hard to tolerate. These mi-
crobes actually had the impertinence to
pretend that they were “correct” and
that I was wrong. It is, of course, per-
that they are cheap editions of me---
Before I have carried my eye from the
fectly obvious to any impartial person -
are usually very affectionate dogs, with
field spaniels stunted in their youth by
frequent doses of gin. A more pre-
tentious crew I have never seen. One
morning, when I was out with the Cap-
tain, I met one of them whom his owner
was leading by a leash. “Self-satisfied
little muff " " I hissed as I passed. “If
I could only get at you,” he had the
cheek to retort, “I'd make mince-meat
of both of you !” and he pretended to
tug at his leash. Thereupon the Captain
turned back and cleverly bit through
the leash – and you never saw anyone
skurry so quickly in the wrong direction
as Master Charlie. So much for King's
blood |
Sometimes, if we felt frolicsome, we
would not wait for trouble to come to
us, but we would even make it. This
we managed by means of the Club Bone.
We would leave the Club Bone in the
road as a decoy. Then we would hide
round the corner, and as soon as a
thorough-bred began to tackle the
bone, we would all rush out and angrily
accuse him of trying to rob the poor.
WAR.
The “Grandes battues,” when the Do
of War put forth their whole strength,
took place comparatively rarely—not
more often, on the average, than once in
two months –for the Captain would not
have us waste our corporate strength on
what he considered unworthy objects.
It is astonishing, when I come to
think of the number of engagements in
which I have taken part, how seldom I
came to any harm. “Fortune favours
the brave,” was the flattering explana-
tion given by the Captain, who had an
apt quotation for everything. In a way,
of course, I was armour-clad. I refer
to my rough hair. We rough-coated

The Captain, too, was wonderfully
immune from damage. Yet, perhaps,
in his case this was not remarkable, for,
like all good officers, he, more often
than not, directed operations from a

was an astonishing difference between
us. The Captain was always as cool as

MASCOT MAGIC. ,
MAscots appear to be a good
deal in evidence, or rather, up
various sleeves, this season.
We learn, for instance, that a
Black Cat contributed in that
capacity very effectively to the
recent victory of Sir MAURICE
FitzGER ALD's Satanita at
Cowes; also that Master WRAY,
the little son of the Harvard
crew's trainer, is expected to
do great things as a three-
year-old magician at Putney
on September 8, being respon-
sible, of course, for the safe
negotiation of the American
triumph.
These matters, we consider,
should be speedily placed on
a sounder and more sports-
manlike footing. If mascots
are going to revolutionise the
world of athletics in this way,
it would be as well to know
where we are. How can we
be sure - to take a recent case
... that Surrey's collapse at
Sheffield was not due to some
lamentable misbehaviour on
the part of Lord DALMENY's
or Hayward's private totem 2

cervical vertebrae with an axe.
º thus impaired the
creature's powers of locomo-
tion, you can take it out at
leisure and bury it in the
garden. This method is re-
commended in all cases where
a manservant is kept.
Miss BEATON (one of “The
Four Maries”), in her excellent
book Little Jobs about the
House, gives the following
recipe: “Having first caught
your flea, imprison it care-
fully in the centre of a ball of
dough which should contain
at least one part of chlorate
of lime and three parts of
petroleum. Bake the whole
for one hour, and transfer to
pigsty.” It may be pointed
out, however, that, while this
method is obviously better
than some occasionally re-
sorted to, such as giving your
flea to the dog to roll on, or
putting down poisoned meat,
it is a risky one to resort to
except in the case of very
immature specimens. Many
other methods both of catch-
ing and killing these ob-
noxious creatures are known.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
If you are sitting in your lonely room on a beautiful
August day, thinking of a Devon sea or a Kent orchard, and
a kncck comes at the door, the chances are nineteen to one
that it is merely the landlady--to ask whether you will have
lunch “in” this morning please. But in romances it is
always your cousin Marjorie who bursts in upon you—
Marjorie, who played games with you ten years ago—whom
you do not recognize now with her hair up ; and she is your
second cousin lots removed, because, though legally you may
marry your first cousin, still it isn't much done. Marjorie's
first thought is “How improved he is ' " and yours “Thank
Heaven I shaved this morning.” And by and by you go out
and have some lunch. It is a wonderful world where these
things happen, so I am more grateful than I can say to
E. NESBIT and T. Fisheſt UNWIN for this delightful book, Man
and Maid. There are thirteen stories in it, but nearly always
a Marjorie, that is to say an adventure. But for her, one

I have a sort of bone to pick with Mr. Willi AM DE MoRGAN.
His book, Joseph Vance (HEINEMANN), is quite the best novel
I have read for a very long time, and yet he describes it as
“An Ill-Written Autobiography.” It seems absurd for me
to say (respectfully), “No, sir; you are wrong. It is not ill-
written ; it is very well written indeed ; it is full of a tender
playful detachment from, and at the same time sympathy
with, its subject; full of that restraint of power which gives
one a feeling of strength through the sheer delicacy of its
concealment. It is full, moreover, of an exquisite human
sense of character, in proof whereof I could cite one of the
least of its people –Porky, who, on being challenged in
respect of his knowledge of triangles equilateral and equian-
gular, with great presence of mind denied the existence of
both, because they would be oneven all over exceptin' they
were drored square.’” It seems, I repeat, absurd for me to
say all this, for there is the author's own verdict stamped
indelibly on the cover. So I won't say it. But it's true all
the same.

the rising hope of a political party, but a sodden drunkard.
Engage him to the prim maiden. Bring affairs up to the
very hour of the clang of the wedding bell, then flash on the
bride-expectant the discovery that he is even worse than she
thought him. The wedding is broken off. He mysteriously
disappears; returns, after an interval of two years, disguised
in sobriety and a fez; makes love again to his old flame;
reconquers her affection and, when she thinks she is, after all,
about to marry a fez, discloses his identity. That is the story
in brief. Iłut there is no flesh and blood engaged in working
it out.

they have ceased to race at Aix, and that an indiarubber

“DOES WOMAN HELP 2"
SIR. In answer to this silly season conundrum which is
agitating the readers of one of your contemporaries I reply:
certainly she does. Take my own case. For years I had
secretly loved the girl to whom I am now happily engaged.
I am naturally nervous, and for a long time had not the
courage to propose. At length one day I found myself alone
with ETHEL in her mother's drawing-room. In the course of
conversation she remarked that she was feeling rather lonely,
as her mother was out calling, and would not return for at
least an hour. My fears on this point being thus removed, I
resolved to risk my fortune.
The difficulty was how to begin. ETHEL was arranging
some flowers, and, by way of commencement, I said something
about “Those white hands of yours.” She merely remarked,
“Why not say ‘Yours, FRED 2" and the thing was done.
Since then I have often felt deeply grateful for this timely
help, without which I might easily have occupied the full
hour's time with no better result. Yours, &c.,
FREDERICK Tortoise.

By a stroke of the pen, President

Mr. HALDANE is being hailed at Berlin

will not find it necessary to give further
proofs of his friendship. Our Army has

The experiment is certainly worth trying.
Wives won't obey when they promise

Mr. J. O'GDEN ARMoUR has written a
book entitled The Packers and the People

THE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP OF 1920.
(With acknowledgments to the #d. Press.)
May 1, 1920.--The cricket season opens to-day, and the
supporters of Anglesea are confident of retaining the Cham-
pionship. But it must be borne in mind that the five other
counties engaged to-day, Kent, Surrey, Essex, Yorkshire and
Notts, have not yet suffered a reverse.
May 4.—Anglesea have retained their percentage of 100,
and if they do not drop any more points they should be
well in the running for the Championship. Curiously enough,
Kent and Yorkshire have also 100%.
June 1.-A month has elapsed and we are only that much
nearer the result of the Championship.
June 29.-Yorkshire have now 77.77%. If they beat
Surrey, and Surrey beat Hants, Gloucestershire will still
have a percentage of 25.
July 4.—What a pity HAYWARD, the Grand Old Man of
Cricket, dropped that catch at 3 P.M. on June 12' Surrey
might now have been 66.66%. On the other hand they
might not.
July 20. The contest is now one of Bat v. Ball.
Aug. 3.-If Anglesea are beaten to-day, Surrey hope to be
Champions. They have hoped so ever since May.
Aug. 17.-It is still a contest of Bat v. Ball.
Sept. 2.-Anglesea and Yorkshire each have a percentage
of 71-9. If Anglesea beats Yorkshire it will have a percen-
tage of 732. Conversely Yorkshire will have this percentage
if Anglesea loses.
If the match is drawn, they will be equal.

“THE DREAM AND THE BUSINESS.”
To the memory of Pearl Mary-Teresa Craigie.
If anything was needed to bring home the cruel hurt
that the world of letters has had to bear in the loss of Mrs.
CRAGE, there is this last book of hers, The Dream and the
Business, whose appearance follows with so pathetic a
nearness upon her death. The tireless courage and activity
of mind which at last wore out the frail body show here no
signs of surrender; only they have taken on a new tenderness
of sentiment that grew with the growing years; a gentler
humanity, a more poignant sense of the pitifulness of things
in a world where the business of life is so often divorced
from its dreams.
The book reminds one most of the manner of The School for
Saints and Robert Orange, while avoiding their aloofness from
common experience; yet it is representative of all that was
best in all her work—its clear-eyed breadth of vision, its
reasoned serenity, its earnestness tempered with gaiety, its
cynicism corrected by an understanding heart. It is largely
a contrast, worked out with high impartiality, between the
Nonconformist and the Roman Catholic attitudes of mind.
Whether it is due to a more comprehensible quality in their
creed or to the effect of Mrs. CRAIGIE's own early training,
still vital with the unsuspected force of first impressions
despite the later influence of an adopted faith, it seems that
she has better succeeded in realising for us the characters of
the Nonconformist Firmaldens than those of the Catholic
Marlesfords, except in the strange afterthought by which she
permits Sophy Firmalden to go over to the Roman Church.
Perhaps the chief interest of the book as a study in the
interrelations of character will be found in the clash of a
pagan intellect and passion (Lessard's, the child of nature)
with these two antithetical types of Christian. But of all
the many contrasted figures with which the book abounds,
Tessa Marlesford (“the artist without an art”) remains
the most fascinating by the elusive childlikeness of her
temperament, her ideals too vague for attainment or even
definition, her appealing helplessness in the hands of circum-
Stance.
Yet, for some, the most enduring attraction of the book
will lie in its lucid ease and purity of style; for others, in its
wealth of swift unerring criticisms of creed and custom,
– epigrams easily detachable from their context, but
neº, always appropriate to the lips that utter them ; as
when Lady Marlesford, speaking of the caste to which she
belongs, says, “My aunt believes she is upper-class. The
very belief is second-rate ' " But at times Mrs. CRAIGIE
foregoes the dramatic method and gives expression to her
own philosophy of life. This may seem a flaw in the book's
perfection to those who require all art to be objective. Yet
it has the virtue, for those who never knew her, that by this
self-revelation they are admitted to a certain intimacy with
the author's heart.
For those who knew her well it is harder than ever, with
this book before them, in which the unforgettable charm of
her personality is so brightly reflected, to realise that the
hand which wrote it is still in death; that for her “the
business” of life is over, and “the dream ” at length comes
true. O. S.

SPELLING REFORM.
GREAT MEETING AT SREEDO CASI.
(LATE SREEB). CASTLE.)
A GREAT meeting to discuss the new
scheme of spelling reform promulgated
by President Roosevelt was held on
Saturday last at Skeebo Castle, the
picturesque Highland seat of Mr. ANDREW
CARNEGIE. There was a large attend-
ance, including the Duke and Duchess
of SUTHERLAND, Professor CHURTON Collins,
the Poet Laureate, Mr. ALGERNoN Ashfox,
Mr. H. G. WELLs, Lord Avebt Ry, Dr.
Dougi. As HYDE, Miss PANKhURST, Mr.
HENRY JAMEs, Mr. W. LE QUEUx, &c.
Mr. ANDREW CARNEGIE, who took the
Chair; opened the proceedings with
music, tastefully performing a selection
from WAGNER on his new electric orkes-
trogramofon. He then welcomed the
distinguished company in a graceful
speech. As for the scheme which they
were met together to discuss he could
not claim (he said) to be its originator.
Ch.AUCER had forestalled him, and SHAK-
SPEARE, by the pathetic futility of his
efforts to spell his own name twice run-
ning in the same way, was unconsciously
the most powerful advocate of simplified
spelling. He called upon Professor
SKEAT to address the meeting.
Professor SKEAT, after a brief survey
of the history of spelling reform, said
that the time had come for them to
break loose from the thraldom of BUTTER
and MAvon. Modern spelling, he con-
tinued, was neither one thing nor the
other. Let all words be spelt with
elaborate disregard for pronunciation—
e.g., if phthisical was right and fitting,
then bicycle should be spelt phbisical-
or let them all conform to the rules laid
down by President Roosevelt. As an
instance of the confusion to which the
existing method gave rise he mentioned
the curious case of Lord TENNYSON, who
was called AI.U.M, after Alum Bay, near
Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight, where
his father, the late Laureate, lived. Most
people, however, owing to the prevalence
of Cockney habits, misspelt the name
HALLAM, and as such it appeared even
in books of reference.
Lord Avent RY (who was greeted with
cries of “Spell it with a B, my lord ' ''),
said that some of the happiest hours of
his life had been spent in observing the
habits of spelling bees. For the rest
he held that the pleasures of life would
be greatly enhanced by the removal of
any annbiguity between “ant ’’ and
“aunt.” Phonetic spelling would in-
evitably discourage an identical pro-
nunciation of these two words. As it
was he found that remarks made by
him on the nature of the aphides were
frequently taken by his listeners to refer
to certain of his female relatives. (Buzzes
of sympathy, in which his lordship
joined with a prolonged hum).
The Chairman of the Society of De-
scriptive Reporters, whose name we did
not catch, but rather think it was
CHOLMONDELEY, said that he voiced the
unanimous sentiment of the journalistic
profession in denouncing the proposed
reform as a mean and cheese-paring
device. He had calculated that it
would mean saving four lines in every
hundred, which he would remind the
meeting represented two glasses of
beer, or for those of different persua-
sions a plate of jugged cabbage at
the Eustace Miles Restaurant. He com-
mended this aspect of the question to
the Trade Unions of Great Britain and
America.
Mr. ALGERNoN AshTON, whose head
was tastefully decorated with sable
plumes and who was received with
mute respect, said that he had recently
paid a visit to America for no other
purpose than to satisfy himself that the
grave of Josh BILLINGs was what it
should be. He mentioned this because
Josh was really the father of the present
&meute in orthographical circles.
Miss PANKhURST wished to know
whether Mr. Asquith supported spelling
reform or not. Her attitude towards
the movement would be entirely deter-
mined by his —in the contrary direction.
(Cheers.)
Mr. HENRY JAMEs said that simplicity
was the bane of literature. If they
wanted a practical proof of his assertion
he would ask them to note the demoral-
ising effect of the new method on his
own style. Mr. HENRY JAMEs then
proceeded to write on the blackboard
the following passage from The Golden
Bowl :—
“MAGGY had suffishuntly intimated
to the Prinse, ten minits be!, that she
needed no shoing as to hwat thare frend
woodnt consent to be taken 4; but the
diſfikulty now indeed was to chuse, for
explisit tribute of admirashun, between
the varietiz of her nobler aspekts. She
karrid it off, to put the matter korsly,
with a tast and diskreshm that held our
yung wooman's attenshun for the furst
kwarter of an our, to the vurry point of
diverting it from the attitood of her
overshadod, her almost superseeded,
kompanyon.”
| Panic and crics for stretchers.
Mr. LE QUEUx, speaking in the pic-
turesque patois of San Marino, pointed
out the peculiar cruelty of a system
which, if applied to surnames, would
confound his identity with (l) a subur-
ban botanical garden, (2) another novelist,
(3) the crowd outside a theatre door.
Dr. Dougi. As HYDE, in an impassioned
speech, hailed the scheme as one likely
to accelerate the de-Anglicisation of
Ireland. It was the glory of Erse that
it contained more superfluous letters
than any other tongue. (Mr. ALGERN's
Ashton : " May I ask did the learned
gentleman say ' Hearse' : " . Dr. HYDE
*No, Erse.” Mr. Ashfox : “I’m sorry."
English owed its partial toleration to a
feeble imitation of this practice, but iſ
forced on an unwilling people in a
phonetic form would provoke an irre-
sistible boycott. The day they tampered
with the spelling of Youghal and Drog-
heda the doom of England's tyranny
was sealed.
Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN pronounced him-
self an unhesitating supporter of the old
régime. By it bards were allowed the
privilege of employing eye rhymes,
which would be impossible under the
CARNEGIE-Roos Evelt tyranny. The
labours of a laureate, severe enough
already, would be enhanced to an un-
endurable extent if this relaxation were
denied thcm.
Professor CHURTON Collins also dis-
sented strongly from the views expressed
by the Chairman. He declared that a
man who mutilated his mother-tongue
should be indicted for matricide. The
craze for phonetic spelling was a dis-
tinct sign of a criminal disposition, and
if officially recognised would lead to
pogroms in every village in the United
Kingdom.
At this stage of the proceedings con-
siderable consternation was excited by
the appearance of a strange figure in
rusty black with an unkempt wig in
the gallery. “Sir,” exclaimed the figure,
“I little thought that the English
language, which I laboured so assidu-
ously to preserve, was destined to be
mangled and mutilated by a Scottish
plutocrat and a Dutch-American. The
Serbonian bog of mythology is nothing
compared to the Skibonian slough of
ignorance.” With these words , the
speaker hurled a large volume (which
subsequently turned out to be John-
son's Dictionary) at the Chairman
and disappeared in a cloud of poly-
syllables.
The proceedings shortly afterwards
terminated with a vote of thanks to the
Chairman, proposed by one of the leading
citizens of Dornoch, who humorously
expressed the hope that in future they
would not be confused with door-
knockers.
“Motor Body.”
“One man can change from a Tonneau to a
Laudaulette, Shooting Brake, or Racing Car in
two minutes, and, when fixed, cannot be told
from ANY fixed body.”—Adrt in “The Autocar."
The disguise would certainly deceive
one's nearest relations, but as likely as
not one's dog would come up and give
the whole show away by licking the
sparking plug.

HENRY'S IDEA.
I. -
OF THE SILLY SEASON.
If there's one man I hate, said HENRY,
it is the cynic. You know MASTERs 2
Well, he's just been here, and I've been
trying to talk to him about the Sea-
serpent. Personally I believe in the
Sea-serpent. I mean there are some
pretty odd animals around already,
aren't there 2 . . . Well, yes, MAstERs,
for instance . . .
It beats me why people should be so
ready to sneer at men who write to the
papers about things—really important
things like Sea-serpents and Dreams
and “Do Women Help.” I saw one
letter on women helping signed
“Mother of Thirteen,” which seemed
a pretty useful argument, and MASTERs
said it was probably written by a
man in the office. Well, of course
it may have been ; but it's much
pleasanter to think of this fine woman
working like mad to clothe and feed
thirteen children, and even then getting
time to sit down and write to the papers
all about it.
Then there was a letter on Dreams by
F. R. G. S. Well, I know his name may
have been F. R. G. Smith, but I think
it's much nicer to believe that he really
is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical
Society—got in on a by-election, per-
haps. . . .
People are much too smart for me
nowadays. MASTERs found me looking
at The Sportsman the other morning.
I was reading out a team to him, and
We came to “A. BowlFR.” MASTERS
spent about half an hour wondering
whether that stood for any well-known
man. Why not ARTHUR BowlFR 2 I
mean there's “Jack Straw's Castle”
. . . and so on... Then there was a man
in this team called BRIERLY. “Wonder
if he's any relation to the Lancashire
man,” said MASTERs. “Oh, but he can't
be," he added; “it 's spelt differently.”
Well, why shouldn't they have been
cousins 2
I was sorry there were no letters this
year on what we should do if we had a
million pounds left us. That's the sort
of topic that appeals to everybody.
Personally I should buy a pen-knife
first, because I've just lost mine: and
then that would spoil the whole thing,
ecause I should only have some
ridiculous sum, all in nines, left, and
ºne simply couldn't do anything with it.
Still, I should have the knife, anyhow.
No, the best question-on now is the
ºconomy of Marriage one. A dear man
from somewhere down the line says he
has saved £50 a year by marrying.
I think it's splendid of him, and he is so
He. “So That's The You Ng Thing old Slocum 's MARRIED !
She. “YEs--or The Frºst of APRii, AND The Fifth of November ' "
MAY AND DECEMBER—whAT!"
rotten remark MASTERS would make). . .
Of course you do save a lot in some
ways. I know a man who has his hair
trimmed every day, because you never
know when you may meet your future
wife, and the great thing is a good
impression at the start. If he only had
it done once a month, as likely as not
he'd been introduced to her on the 31st,
and that might put her off for good.
Of course he'll save all that if he ever
gets married.
Then there's the Cry of the Middle
Classes. That doesn't interest me much,
because I don't believe there are any
middle classes. I've talked to lots of
men and women about it, and somehow
it's always been “They do this,” and
“They do that"; never “We.” I think
I should define the Middle Class as
the “class below the person you are
awfully happy about it ... (She hadn't
any money of her own. That's the sort of
talking to,” just as a Bounder is the
man who does the things you don't do.
There can be no Absolute Bounder, and
I'm beginning to think no Middle Class.

“As a matter of fact the big provincial

This makes The Times observation
on the poverty of £2,000 a year seem
almost a platitude.

MOONSHINE.
(By an Elderly Misogynist.)
EveNING has spread her grey-toned wings in flight;
The skies are clear; and, like a great balloon,
Charming the young hours of the amorous night,
Looms the romantic Moon.
How full She looks' With what complacent pride
She weaves Her spells! “In such a night,” methinks,
“Did young Lorenzo" dally with his bride,
Jessica (little minx ().
“In such a night,” by yon same Orb inspired,
Juliet engaged the love-lorn youth below
In pleasing talk, and gloomily enquired
Why he was Romeo.
“In such a night”—but why prolong the theme?
Thou placid Regent of the starry host,
A night like this would freshen Love's young dream
E’en in a very ghost.
O Thou that artfully didst lure abroad
The vague Endymion, Thou that didst attend
The vigils of the gentleman in Maud
- Up to the bitter end ;
Pagans of old raised temples to Thy Name,
And did due homage to Thy perfect Round ;
Their rites, no doubt, were wrong, but all the same
The main idea was sound.
For 0 DIANA, great indeed art Thou!
O Goddess, as it was in early days,
The old, old game is going on E'en now,
Wherever fall Thy rays,
The lover, buoyed upon their silvery flood,
Dashes off reams of vivid epithet,
Which, if he thinks them over in cold blood,
He ll probably regret.
Now, too, the army of our moonstruck bards
With brilliant freshness beg “yon argent Moon'
To bear some lyric love their kind regards,
Hoping to see her soon ;
y
And, round me here, in garden and in glade,
Highest alike with lowest, lord and lout,
The daughter of the manor, and the maid
Who has her evening out,
All, all—or all, at any rate, who can–
Bask in Thy beams, and air their moony wiles;
And I must be about the one wise man
In half-a-dozen miles.
Sail on, Old Moon! In all Thine orby prime,
Sail on They little think, who dally thus,
1ſow brief a step it is from the sublime
To the ridiculous.
Me, I embrace my quiet as a boon,
As these must do before they're middle-aged –
So wise am I'—and yet—oh, Moon, Moon, Moon'
I wish I was engaged
DUM-DUM.
THE Cork Constitution says that “the extraordinary rush
of traffic this year makes it impossible to iodooioo tae

whether this is the Irish language or the new spelling, but

THE LITTLE HORSES.
(From the Peasqueak Papers.)
THAT there are not only great evils but also great fascina-
tions in gambling I know only too well from personal experi-
ence. Not that I have gambled myself; I never did so. I
promised my grandfather I would never touch a card, and I
have kept my word—a card, that is, of this nature; but I have
often played “Snap" with my brother's children, and I re-
member once joining in a mad and merry game of “Old
Maid' at Dr. ForſtESTER’s at Bristol, after we returned, in a
somewhat skittish mood, from a lecture on the excavations in
Pompeii by a learned man whose name for the moment I
forget. The most interesting game of cards, however, which
I recollect was a prolonged duel at “Patience" on a snowy
night in 1888 with the widow of GEORGE LAMPETER the astrono-
mer, a shrewd and kindly old lady, whose father was one of
the pioneers of the oil-cake industry. Cards, however, in the
ordinary acceptance of the term, I have never touched, and
Bridge is a sealed book to me.
But of gambling I know something, having been to Dieppe
one summer several years ago, and stood for a while watching
the players at the petits chevaux tables so called from the
little toy horses which revolve in the centre and determine the
losses and gains of those that are speculating. I learned
something that day of this fierce passion of gambling, not
only as it grips and controls our mercurial neighbours, but
our countrymen also – for among the eager crowd that
thronged the room were not a few faces which I perceived
to be English by certain characteristics that could not escape
any one at all skilled in physiognomy, and among them one
familiar to me, for it was that of my old municipal associate,
B–. He had left our borough some years before and
migrated, it was understood, to London, where I had heard
of him now and then as doing fairly well at the Bar. It was
a surprise to me to find him here, in this company, and more
than a surprise – a source of regret —to see the easy way, as
to the manner born, if one could be born to such sophistica-
tion, in which he tossed his money on the green board a
franc here, a two-franc piece there, and sometimes even a five-
franc piece, for there was heavy gambling on this occasion.
It was very interesting to watch the different types of
gamblers—those who bore their losses and their gains with
composure; those who trembled beneath their winnings, and
those again in whose pockets I seemed to see the fatal re-
volver or poisoned phial. An electric excitement seemed to
be in the air. I saw one Frenchwoman, apparently of gentle
birth, win at one coup, as it is called, as much as fourteen
francs by putting a two-franc piece on the seven. I saw
another but more reckless gambler, also a woman, lose eight
francs one after the other, and then get up and walk des:
perately away—no doubt to throw herself into the sea. I
should, I know, have gone out after her, but my wife might
have misunderstood my motives; and my interest in the
play, I must admit, also deterred me.
How long I was standing there I cannot say, while money
changed hands with incredible celerity, but suddenly I was
aware that B –– was speaking to me. He was asking me
to lend him a louis, having lost all his ready money, some
thirty-five francs, at the game. After some deliberation as
to whether or not I ought to do so, I took the coin from my
purse and handed it to him. He asked me to assist him to
a number on which to place it, and after considerable hesita-
tion and not a little urging on his part I advised 2, which
had, I noticed, turned up already more often than any other
number. He placed the louis on it, and breathlessly we
watched the little horses run. Judge of my excitement
when the second horse won by half a neck, and my frien
was the recipient not only of the louis he had put on, but of
seven others.

PRATTLE OF MY DEAD PAST.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. George Moore.)
I.
This evening as I sat at my window
in the Temple and watched the twilight
creeping along the Embankment, like a
pickpocket, or a girl who has forgotten
the address of her lover, I became con-
scious that a definite resolution was
forming itself within me. It came
slowly, as twilight comes, or the Celtic
revival, or a literary style. And the
resolution was that I would write a
CLARICE had tresses of a richer, more
metallic gold than any woman I ever
saw, except one. And how adorably chic
she seemed to me in her Sunday best,
worn as only a Frenchwoman can wear
it. The skirt, I remember, rather full
at the waist and gathered round the
ankles into-

I wonder if there is anything in the
world more finely spring-like than the

green, green and tremulous like a bashful

great sky, studded all over with those
little white clouds that always remind me

LUCETTE! To this day the fragrance of
printer's ink will bring her image clearly
to my memory. We used to call her
“The Dove,” a fact which inspired
VERLAINE to one of his most character-
istic poems:-
“Le front du pigeon est austère,
Mais helas! pour sa vie!
Vraiment je ne sais pas, ma chère,
Tout ce qu'il fait chez lui !”
I recollect one delightful fête which it
was my good fortune to spend in her

VI.
WAR (continued).
ONE of our most notable achievements
was the entire subjugation of “The
Club at a certain fashionable Square on
a certain day. Shortly before this we
had been called poltroons by one of
their number. The Captain now saw a
chance of a coup. On the day in ques-
tion we mustered every man we could
place in the field, and met at a secret
rendezvous.
The Captain then gave us
*
This was the sign of surrender.
Upper Ten,” whose overbearing de-
meanour had become intolerable to us.
They were all big fellows, and it was
an uphill struggle. It lasted two days.
The first day we reduced them to “The
Upper Eight,” The Map disabling one
and I another. The next morning The
Hippopotamus put a third out of action,
and Ilamed their leader. In the after-
noon this leader limped up to the
Captain, turned over on his back, and
flung up his legs. This was the sign
of surrender. The Captain led him
aside and terms were discussed. As
finally agreed, they were generous-
far too generous, in my opinion. The
Upper Ten were to cease from insulting
us either in speech or by gesture, they
were always to address us as “Sir”
when they spoke to us, and to stand
aside as we passed. That was the end
of The Upper Ten.
The Blue Bloods, however, were our
chief enemies. They were a powerful
organisation, and it was only due to the
superior generalship of the Captain that
we were ultimately able to inflict a blow
on them from which they never really
recovered. The Captain on this occasion
showed superb strategy. By-the-by, I
do not think I have mentioned yet that
the Captain's people called him “Nap,”
which is short for Napoleon, who was a
great General something like the Cap-
tain. Curiously enough, I have been
told, he too was of small stature.
Information had reached us that the
Blue Bloods were to hold a business
meeting to discuss the affairs of their
our directions. We were split up into
three parties, and each of such parties,
at a given signal, was to rush into the
Square by a different road, and surprise
and overcome the enemy.
The plan was completely successful.
It was a glorious fight, lasting , two
hours. A number of tradesmen's boys
kept the ring, pailfuls of blue blood
ran, ladies fainted and shrieked, but,
I flew at the black beast's throat.
though outnumbered, we won ultimately,
and the police did not appear upon the
scene until the Blue Bloods were in full
retreat. It was on this occasion that I
saved the Captain's life. A great black
beast like an undertaker had downed
the little fellow. With the words, “You
lily-livered hound !” I flew at the black
beast's throat, and half throttled him.
I got bitten in the leg; but what cared
I? The Captain escaped, and I had
saved his life.
ſes, we were nearly always successful,
though our enemies often circulated lying
reports to the contrary. In fact, I can
only remember one genuine defeat. That
was the Barking fiasco. We felt one
day that we would like to take on an easy
job for a change. Someone suggested,
“Why not make a raid on Barking?
Barking dogs don't bite, you know.”
It seemed to us a good idea, and we set
out. It was a long way off, and we were
tired when we arrived there. Suddenly,
while we were looking round, we were
ourselves attacked by as ugly a swarm
of dogs, as you ever saw. Amusingly,
they called us “toffs.” We were com-
pletely taken by surprise, and not one
of us escaped without injury. Even
the Captain suffered a slight contusion,
though I looked after him as well as I
could. I myself had one of my ears
split. You never saw such a tatter-
demalion crew as we were after the fight.
On the Captain's instructions, each of
us returned home by a different route, as
it would have been bad for the prestige
of the Club for us to be seen in a body
in that condition. So much fur was lost
that day that several members caught

carried off the Pipe-Cleaner were then

with ignominy a short time before for
telling falsehoods. I met this dog on

The DANGER of WoRDS WITH Two

That Barking affair showed the danger
of ambiguous words. A very dear friend
of mine met with his death from the
same cause. He was told of a clever
dog who, upon receiving a copper from
his master, would run with it to a
neighbouring baker's and obtain in ex-
change quite a quantity of biscuits. My
friend upon hearing this thought he
would do likewise. So he went out and
fastened his teeth into the first police-
man he met, and tried to drag him into
a confectioner's. The copper, however,
resisted strenuously, and in the scuffle
that ensued my poor friend received a
blow on the head which proved fatal.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Confessions of a Princess (John LoNG) is one of those
diaries—a hallowed device—which profess to be intended for
no other eye than the author's. Who, in this case, is the
owner of the eye we are not to know, but I assume that she
is without honour in her own country, for the book purports
to be from the German ; and I cannot at the moment think
of any German-speaking neighbourhood in which it would
not be suppressed on the ground of Majestätsbeleidigung.
The author prattles along with a pleasant garrulity, and
her work has a certain craisemblance derived either from
personal intimacy with German Courts or from general
gossip. A recent scandal at the Saxon Court seems to be
indicated as the origin of what is most objectionable in the
book. The Princess's amours—of which only the first
presents any attractions—become nauseating by
repetition, and
In The Eglamore Portraits (METHUEN) MARY E. MANN tells
of the trials of a newly-married couple—Clarence and Juliet.
A woman's man is never quite the real thing, and in any
case a man called Clarence is bound to be suspected ; yet
Mrs. MANN's hero is, with it all, a good fellow, whom one
would hail gladly at any time. He had, however, a habit of
“setting his under teeth below his upper, and projecting
his lower lip" when angry. I found myself doing this all
through the book with Clarence-I suppose one gets into it
at last. Clarence had a lot of practice, because he was always
quarrelling with Juliet. She is delightfully drawn; the
most life-like heroine I have ever met. There are other
characters in the book, some pleasant, some unpleasant, but
all realistic. Mrs. MANN has a nice, quiet, humorous way
with her, and she has written a very charming story. Only
she should not have let the mother-in-law die; one has no time
to get into the mood for it, hateful though that person was.
“Yet something flashed before him then, swift illuminating

This is a quotation from
the last chapter of The
Bar (METHUEN). If the
reader cannot makehead
or tail of it, he has the
sincere sympathy of
what a contributor to
one of the morning
papers persistently al-
ludes to as “the present
writer.” Never in a
pretty long and varied
experience did the latter
come upon such a tangle
of a narrative. Many
characters come and go.
Nearly every one has his
or her secret, darkly
hinted at in unfinished
sentences; revealed
never . The only
comprehensible thing in
subject is a “delicate”
one —I take to be a woman. When one has admitted that
the main theme has been handled with a tolerable avoidance
of grossness, one has said all that is to be said in the book's
favour. It is trivial in detail, and the edification it offers
is of the thinnest. -

The Royal Irish Constabulary.
WE beg to call the attention of the Royal Humane Society
to these two extracts from the Down Spectator:-
“A cycle accident happened at the foot of Main Street yesterday,
when a young lady j to avert running over a child that got into her
way. Constable M’CANN ably picked the child up before any injury
worth mentioning was done.”
“The prompt action of Constable Stevenson, of the Donaghadee R.J.",
averted what would undoubtedly have proved a nasty and serio's
accident on Friday last. When rounding a sharp corner a young laº
cyclist came in contact with the curb, which threw her violently towar"
the wall, when Constable STEvenson, who fortunately happened to be "
the vicinity, with great presence of mind rushed forward and caug
her just in time to avert the young lady from coming in contact wº
the wall of a building at the scene of the accident. No damſ;"
resulted to the machine, and the young lady, after thanking the constaº
mounted her bicycle and proceeded on her journey. This is not the
first occasion on which Constable STEvºsson has displayed his presen”
of mind and prompt action in time of danger.”

MARK's TwaiN.
(Tristram and Iseult.)
I AM not sure that the makers of old
Breton legends, when they invented a
second Iseult—her of the white hands—
to be the wife of Tristram, were not
justified of this daringly prosaic anti-
climax. Certainly, Mr. CoMYNs CARR
failed to convince me that he had im-
proved on the old tale when he turned
this lady into a kind of abstraction, a
ghostly double of her namesake. He
represents her as superior to the “fair”
Iseult by the fact that there is no wound
she cannot cure, whereas the fair Iseult
can only cure all wounds but one. If I
follow the author, this extra wound is the
wound of Love, and her medicine for
it (not so very original, one would say)
is Death. Yet I could not see that
she had any hand—white or other—in
Tristram's perishing, which seemed to
me the direct result of somebody else's
villainous sword-thrust in the small of
his back. But things were rather con-
fusing at this point, and Tristram's
statement that Death and Life and Love
were really identical did not greatly
help matters; nor was the riddle solved
by reference to the text, where the dis-
tinction made between ordinary type
and capital initials only served to darken
COunsel :-
“For death and life are one !
1 *
Love'
Still, the play is really very free of
obscurities, though I couldn't quite
understand the working of Iseult's
shadow in the last Act. It seemed to
move independently of her; even givin
her a hint as to her next move, or ºff
gather from her words:--
“And when I see
That shadowy Iseult uplift her face
Then I'll lift mine.”
Complaint has been made that the
sombreness of the play was untempered
by comic relief. Yet surely this element
was sufficiently provided i. Tristram's
most unusual sword. In dealing Moraunt
his death-wound he had knocked a huge
chip out of the blade (could it have been
made in Germany ?) and left it imbedded
in the body of his victim. Here it was
found by Moraunt's mother, who treasured
the relic next her chest, with the idea of
wreaking vengeance as soon as she found
the owner of the rest of the sword.
This sanguine hope is realised, and
she is enabled to fit the fragment into
its place in a “recognition-scene "almost
Orestean in its futility. Mr. CARR will
cite the authority of legend for this
episode; but would he not have done
more wisely to choose the variant by
which Tristram is discovered through
And Life and
wearing the captured sword of his dead
enemy? I cannot think, by the way,
why Moraunt's people always speak of
Tristram as “caitiff’’ or “coward.” He
at least hit his man with a clean weapon,
not poisoned like Moraunt's. If hard
things have to be said, I should say that
of the two it was rather Moraunt who was
no gentleman. However, de mortuis, &c.
In comparing his scheme with WAG-
NER's, one observes the economy of
time affected by Mr. CARR in the matter
of Tristram's dying. The best part of
an hour is saved over this painful
business; and the time so gained is well
spent over the most satisfactory novelty
in the play, namely the Second Act,
crowded with dramatic incident, in
which we are shown the events that take
place at the court of the Irish King.

A Nice Large Mark.
(Mr. Oscar Asche.)
These events, so necessary to an under-
standing of the subsequent relations
between Tristram and Iseult, are only
perfunctorily sketched by WAGNER in
the tedious form of narrative. There
is a further advantage in the character
of King Mark, here shown as traitor
to his kinsman, an attitude which,
if it does not excuse Tristram's own
treachery, yet colours it with a kind of
poetic justice. The thought is finely
expressed in those lines—none better in
all the play—where Tristram, learnin
that the man whom he has ...i
was himself a traitor at heart, feels no
shame in challenging him to fight:-
“But now this last account betwixt us twain
Sets my sword free. For wrong here answers
wrong,
And death shall claim us both.”
It seems that the critics have not felt
themselves able to crown Mr. CARR's
blank verse with their approbation, yet I
dare hazard the conjecture that he knows
more than most of them on this subject.
And it is a merit with him that he never
forgot, as some of his critics have
forgotten, that he was writing a play for
the stage and not for the study. Inci-
dentally the text has been published (by
Messrs. DUckworth), but the task he set
himself was to write verse that should
be heard rather than read. It surely
requires little intelligence to understand
the point of this distinction.
The play abounds in poetic feeling, but
in the matter of poetic expression he has
declined to over-embroider his theme, to
write for the writing's sake; and has
made it his first aim to be lucid and
logical. Even so his verse maintains a
very fair level of excellence. It has, of
course, its defects. There is too much
of the terminal “Aye, so he did ' " or
“Aye, so he shall !” There is too much
insistence on the leit-motif of Iseult's
healing powers. Here and there he
shows signs of the influence of SHAK-
SPEARE; and in the line
“Umbar that golden prison men call day,”
one traces an echo of BrowNING's
Pompilia –
“So let him wait God's instant men call years.”
If Mr. CARR's style has a somewhat nega-
tive individuality it is at least to his credit
that he has been careful to avoid the
manner of TENNYSON and the other poets
who have treated this same theme.
Miss Lily BRAYTON was a graceful
lseult, but she seemed over-burdened
with the need of being strenuous. She
understands the right delivery of blank
verse, but dwelt toolingeringly over some
of her words. Miss WYNNE-MATTHISON's
artistic intelligence was wasted over the
subordinate part of Brangwaine. As
Tristram, Mr. MATHEsox LANG was rather
disappointing. He seemed to lack virility
both in speech and bearing. Mr. ASCHE
made a very large Mark on the stage:
but he was generally somewhere else.
The scenery was admirable and so were
the women's dresses: but I thought very
little of the gentlemen. King Arthur,
no doubt, had got hold of the pick of
Britain's knighthood for his Round
Table team.

It was a happy forethought on the
part of the management of His Majesty's
Theatre to have a Winter's Tale
ready for the Heat Wave. Not only
was the title a refreshment; but the
play itself, produced under conditions
where enthusiasm would have been
very heating, was pleasurably frigid.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GEORGE BRADSHAW.
(Somewhat in the manner of Mr. G. K.
Chesterton’s “Charles Dickens.”)
INTRODUCTORY.
ALL criticism tends too much to be-
come criticism of criticism; and the
reason is glitteringly evident. It is that
criticism of creation is so very staggering
a thing. It is the same with BRADSHAw.
A man who would cut but a poor figure
in making a third-class railway carriage
may be the first hand in the world at
compiling a time-table; while a man
whose efforts at the compilation of a
time-table are of the rudest might be
the leading mechanic in Swindon.
To blame BRADSHAw for what he could
not do is as illogical as to praise him
for what he could ; or, in other words, to
praise him for what he could do is as
illogical as to blame him for what he
could not. It is therefore that we shall
consider BRADSHAw in the present volume
not as a musician or as a father, not as
a tea-dealer or as a believer in Christian
Science, but as a maker of time-tables
and a servant of the State.
No two things are more different than
an elephant and an arm-chair, and yet
both are quadrupeds. Probably no idea
ever had so general an acceptance as
that Queen ANNE is dead, and yet the
statement cannot be too much repeated
and emphasised. It is the privilege
of the critic to say everything twice.
Repetition is the definition of criticism.
Only those who care for the enuncia-
tion of such principles as these should
attempt the following pages.
BRADSHAw had a more gigantic energy
than the energy of the intense artist—
the energy which is prepared to write
something. He had the energy which
is prepared to write anything. With
all the dazzling universe before him to
select from, he chose to write about
railways. He had the one power in
literature which literally cannot be imi-
tated, the primary inexhaustible will
power, the enormous determination of
genius. Nothing could prevent him
writing about trains. Had he been cast
on a desert isle he would have instantly
invented a complete service of trains
touching at every creek and palm-tree,
with the times accurately given, although
not guaranteed. For with all his abandon,
all his fury of industry, BRADSHAw was
not incautious. No great man ever lacks
caution. If there is one error more
laring or persistent than another
(which I doubt), it is that carelessness
and greatness are allied.
Probably there is no book in the
world so free from extraneous matter as
Bradshaw. No author so consistently
refuses to leave the rails. Whatever
desire the youthful BRADSHAw may have
had to be a poet or imaginative writer,
it was lived down by BRADSHAw the man.
I have searched his pages in vain for
any characters of flesh and blood; I
have read not only the lines, but between
the lines, and have met with no better
fortune. In a peculiar way Bradshaw
is a work of prose. Of many writers
it may be said that they are valuable
only as they are fanciful, but of BRAD-
SHAw we may say that his worth is his
adherence to fact.
Nothing is so irrefragably and funda-
mentally certain as that an expository
critic never keeps to the point so mate-
rially as when he seems to have
abandoned it. But with BRADSHAw the
converse is the case. If he relaxes so
little as to commit the smallest error we
are lost. If there is one truth greater
and more luminous than another (which
I doubt), it is that the compiler of a
railway time-table must not write 3
when he means 2. GEORGE BRADSHAw
knew this. Two and two may make four,
but the 2.2 will certainly be missed by
anyone arriving at 3.3. It is, of course,
doubtful if one can be said, strictly
speaking, ever to be late for anything,
since the man who arrives, for example,
at Euston on Monday five minutes after
the Scotch express has left, is as a
matter of fact in a position of phe-
nomenal earliness for the same train on
the next day. Ordinary arithmetic shows
us that he has as much as twenty-three
hours fifty-five minutes in hand. In
other words, the later we are the earlier
we are. He alone is early who is late.
Yet, if we are to look for lessons, here
at least is the last and deepest lesson of
BRADSHAw. It is that we must be in
time. No man can miss a train and
miss a train only. He misses more than
that. A man who misses a train misses
an opportunity. It is probably the
reason of the terrific worldly success of
CESAR and CHARLEMAGNE that neither of
them ever missed a train.
But BRADSHAw has done for the world
more than this. He has contributed to
its street literature one of its best jokes.
There are popular phrases so picturesque
that even when they are intentionally
funny they are unintentionally poetical.
I remember, to take one instance out
of many, hearing a heated Secularist in
Hyde Park apply to some parson or
other the exquisite expression, “a sky-
pilot.” Subsequent inquiry has taught
me that the term is intended to be comic
and even contemptuous; but in that
first freshness of it I went home repeat-
ing it to myself like a new poem. Few
of the pious legends have conceived so
strange and yet celestial a picture as
this of the pilot in the sky, leaning on
his helm above the empty heavens, and
carrying his cargo of souls higher than
the loveliest cloud. The phrase is like
a lyric of SHELLEY. But my raptures on
this occasion were as nothing compared
with those which I experienced on first
noticing the exquisite jest, “Wait till
the rain stops,” in a railway carriage.
The audacity of it and the wisdom of it
are alike overwhelming. The colossal
truth of the statement that it is wise to
tarry until the shower has ceased is only
to be matched by the effrontery with
which a sixpenny penknife can turn a
train, an artificial product of man, into
rain, the sweetest gift of nature. This
transcendental joke we owe to GEORGE
BRADSHAw, for had it not been for him
it is probable that the original humourist
who hit upon it would not have caught
his train.
The literature of the world contains
no book the merit of which is so equally
distributed as this masterly work of
BRADSHAw's. With most books it is
possible to point to one chapter that is
better than another, or one that is worse.
Some books have their best wine at the
beginning; some their best at the close.
Others again have it in the middle.
But BRADSHAw is above fluctuation. He
rides high, like the stars. To the Great
Western trains he brings no more
thought and no less than to the Bess-
brook and Newry electric cars; he is as
exact and methodical about the Listowel
and Ballybunion service as that of the
London and North-Western. If we find
one section more fascinating than another
the reason is in ourselves. It is because
our home is there, or our love. BRADSHAw
is equal. If there is one thing in the
world more amazing than another (which
I doubt), it is this equality of BRADSHAw's
genius.

HENRY'S IDEA.
II.
OF AN “EMERGENCY.”
I have been reading a little book called
What to do in 101 Emergencies, said
HENRY, and really it's a most compre-
hensive work. I don't know how the
Editor can think of all the things.
Take the 95th emergency: “To ex-
terminate -—s, &c., from furniture "—
which begins: “Take of corrosive sub-
limate, 2 drachms.” Now of course
that's a jolly thing to know, but I can't
imagine anybody waking up in the
middle of the night and shrieking for
help because he heard an earwig climb-
ing up the oak dresser. I mean it isn't
exactly an emergency—though no doubt
a very regrettable business. Still, being
launched on the subject of insects, one
would expect the Editor to follow up
the trail for a bit. But 96 is “To make
a freezing mixture without ice,” 97 “To
render shooting-boots waterproof,” and
98 “In case of the hair falling off.”
The presence of mind required to make
a freezing mixture without ice must be
enorinous.
I should like to see this man setting
a “Hard Case” for Vanity Fair. “A.
and B. are seated together in the Club
smoking-room, when A. suddenly notices
a centipede on the mantelpiece. He
remarks to B., who has on a pair of
shooting-boots which have not as yet
been rendered waterproof, ‘Now if only
we had a freezing mixture!’ ‘What?'
replies B., without any ice 2' A.'s
hair then falls off. What should B. do?”
Now that sort of question really would
brings out a man's tact.
Number 53 interested me a good deal.
It's called “In case of slipping down a
declivity or hill,” and the advice is,
“In case of slipping down a smooth
declivity or hill-side and being unable
to stop, try and turn on the side or
stomach, and there will be a chance of
grasping some projection or shrub.”
Now I took a nasty banana-fall on
Notting Hill yesterday, but without a
moment's hesitation turned . . . as re-
quested . . . . Probably it saved my life.
I'm not altogether sure that the man
chosen the best emergencies. I
mean Number 75, “To prevent fly in
turnips,” isn't nearly so far-reaching as,
say, “To prevent wasps in marmalade”
would be. Personally I should be in-
clined to encourage fly in turnips.
It's a pleasant book, but I shouldn't
trust it in the hands of a careless person.
You see, he might mix the treatments.
Number 81 is “To arouse persons from
the stupor of drunkenness,” and the
treatment is to “Procure a large jug of
Water and pour it on to the head of the
person intoxicated from a fair height,

If the first application is not successful

should like to do that. But suppose
by mistake you gave your man the
treatment “for exterminating cock-
roaches” (59). Or suppose “when the
gas goes out” (50) you mistakenly
endeavour “to remove a glass stopper
that has become fast” (79). Or that
when happily engaged in “blistering a
horse” (88) you found suddenly that
you'd really only been “removing grease
stains” (65) all the time. It would be
so jolly awkward . . . .

LEAVES FROM THE DIARY OF A WAR
MINISTER.
Berlin, August 31.-Breakfasted with
General voN DER GoLTZ, to meet Generals
BRAUNEBERG, VON INGELHEIM and Professor
BERNKASTELER. Discussed the applica-
tion of the Categorical Imperative to
words of command, on which BRAUNE-
BERG holds rather heretical views. Found
some difficulty in explaining to my host
the exact meaning of the term “spatch-
cock,” but on comparing notes dis-
covered that it corresponds to a frisch
geschlachteter und zubereiteter Hahn.
After breakfast went to the tailor's to
have my new German frock-coat–rather
short in the skirts and with a high
waist—tried on. Walked for an hour
in the Thiergarten with Baron JosTY
discussing the indebtedness of S. T.
CoLERIDGE to SPINozA. Lunched with
the Bülows to meet Frau KNUPFER-EGLI,
Count EGGEBRECHT, General KRANZLER,
and HUMPERDINCK the composer. Dis-
cussed SCHLEIERMACHER with Prince Bülow,
who contended that altruistic Quietism
was the only rational basis of a worka-
day philosophy. Explained to Frau
KNUPFER-EGLI the true inwardness of
the rāvra jet of HERACLITUS. After lunch
went with HUMPERDINCK to the Philhar-
monic to hear STRAUss's new Symphonic
Poem Wanamakeriana. Was introduced
to Dr. Muck, EUGEN DALBERT and Count
KEMPINs KI.
Dined with the K. After dinner
discussed President Roosevelt's new
spelling scheme and its probable effect
on the British Army. The K. was
anxious to know whether it would apply
to place-names, and suggested that the
spelling of Jermyn Street cried out for
emendation. Suggested that it might
simplify international relations if Herr
voN TSCHIRSCHRY were to get rid of a
few superfluous letters from his name.
Discussed FICHTE with General voN
EINEM, who avowed himself a follower
of SCHELLING. On returning to my
hotel completed a paper comparing the
three STRAUSSEs – the Tübingen icono-
clast, the Walzerkönig, and the sympho-
nist—which I promised to send to Prin-
cess Bülow, who was one of Liszt's 143
favourite pupils.
Sept. 1.- Breakfasted with St DERMANN
to meet Dr. HANs l{ICHTER, Fräulein
FRITzi SchEFF, and Herr RAIMUND Vox
zu R Milii.EN. We talked of the Byzantin-
ism of modern art. Tried to extract
a clear opinion from RICHTER as to the
originality of the K. as a composer, but
without success. Found to my surprise
that Fräulein FRITZ SCHEFF was an
esoteric Buddhist. After breakfast
walked in the Thiergarten with St DERMANN
and went on to the Zoological Gardens.
Pointed out to SUDERMANN that the
chest-swelling drill was clearly bor-
rowed from the Penguin. Lunched
with Count KEMPINSKI to meet BERNHARD
PschoRR, the famous vegetarian drama-
tist, Generals TöPFER, BAUER and Baron
Josty. Explained the Scottish Church
Dispute to Baron JosTY, who expressed
a strong desire to become a “Wee Free.”
After lunch went with BERNHARD PSCHORR
to inspect the Kunstgewerbe Museum.
Took tea with the Bülows and went in
the evening to inspect CASTAN's Panop-
tikum with General BRAUNEBERG and
Professor BERNKASTELER. Home late.
Sept. 2.-Realised this morning that I
have been neglecting the real objects of
my visit. Resolved to devote the re-
mainder of my time to serious business.
Professor HARNACK came to breakfast
and remained till noon, discussing the
credentials of Dr. EMIL REICH as a critic
of the Higher Criticism. Lunched at
PscIIORR's, and went thoroughly into the
question of the feasibility of compelling
regular troops to become vegetarians.
PsCHORR, I am glad to say, is no uncom-
promising fanatic. He would allow
ToMMY ATKINs an egg for breakfast, and
once a week a dish of Gänsebraten mit
Leberwurst or Kalbsmierenbraten. Went
in the afternoon to Charlottenburg, the
birthplace of Charlotte Prusse; thence to
the Beuth-Schinkel Museum, and exam-
ined mediaeval jewellery with Dr. THEODOR
BARTH and HARNACK. Dined quietly
with the K., and gave him a full account
of the origin, decline and fall of the
“Souls.” Discussed the relative im-
portance in the evolution of strategy of
HANNIBAL, ALEXANDER THE GREAT, JULIUS
CESAR and NAPOLEON. Discussed the
novels of PAUL HEYSE, the plºilosophy of
NIETZSCHE, the development of the steam
turbine, the poems of RoNSARD, VILION,
and ALFRED AUSTIN, and the flute sonatas
of FREDERICK THE GREAT.
Sept. 3.-In the morning inspected a
new patent sentry-box, invented by the K.
Lunched with HARNAck and HUMPERDINCK,
and discussed the possibilities of con-
structing the libretto of an oratorio out
of the code of HAMMURABI. In the after-
noon called on Tschiftsch KY at the Wil-
helmstrasse to discuss the psycho-phy-
siological basis of BüRGER's Lemore.
General voN EINEM, who happened to
look in, had never heard of Scott's version,
which I recited to his great satisfaction.
Dined with PSCHORR at the Kaiserkeller
off lentil soup, articlokes and botanic
beer. Supped with the K. and discussed
the apolaustic Hedonism of HARRY LAUDER
as illustrated in his lyrics, which he
had never heard of ! Well, mon omnia
possumus orn nes.
Sept. 4.— Paid farewell visits and left
Berlin. Pschofit, who came to see me
off, said that the Press were beginning
to think that I had seen too much of the
brain of the German army. Humorous
chaps, these German journalists. Read
BRODRICK's article in the Nineteenth
Century in the train. Slept well on the
journey, and arrived safe at Flushing
without any sign of a Red Eagle.

Like Stoics they stifled their heart-ache,
And bowed to the astral command
Did any irascible star take
Offence at a marriage they planned;
Ah! lover, who longed for her answer,
Oh! maiden, who yearned for his love,
How sorely you suffered from Cancer
Refusing assent from abovel
Ah! why is that science forgotten ?
In vain do I pucker my brow,
And think why it is we don't cotton
To signs of the zodiac now ;
Though still they have messages for us,
Our sceptics maintain-they are sham;
They don't care a toss about Taurus,
They don't care a rap for the Ram!
Why, why did those seers of the past err,
And keep all their secrets intact?
For now I am minus a master,
Nor know in the least how to act;
If only the stars in their courses
Could telephone to me, I feel
That I could be “boss” of the Bourses,
And hold ev'ry trump in each “deal."
Then, since it is true that the scattered
Star-gazers are under a cloud,
One prophet, at least, should feel flattered
To note his success with the crowd;
For, though his perfervid narration
Is weak and his prophecy poor,
Each year we are told that the nation
(Like Oliver) clamours for Moore

ALL our bicycles are fitted with the
Little Handle-Bar Spring, which, when
pressed, causes the machine to fall into
114 pieces.
Anyone can press the spring, but it
takes an expert three months to rebuild
it, thus trebling the life of a bicycle.
We are offering this marvellous in-
vention at the absurd price of
50 guineas cash down,
or 98 weekly instalments of 1 guinea.
[Special reductions to company pro-
moters and men with large families.]
We can't afford to do it for less, be-
cause when once you have bought one
you will never want another.
ADVICE TO PURCHASERs.
Don't lose your head when the
machine runs away with you down-hill;
simply press the spring.
Don't wait for your rich uncle to die;
just send him one of our cycles.
Don't lock your cycle up at night;
merely press the spring.
Don't be misled by other firms who
say that their machines will also fall to
pieces; they are only trying to sell their
cycles; we want to sell You.
NoTE.—We can also fit this marvellous
Little Spring to Perambulators, Bath-

DEAR SIRs, I bought one of your

GENTLEMEN, -Last month I started to
ride to Barnet on one of your cycles.
When ascending Muswell Hill, I lost
control of the machine, but I simply
pressed the spring, and now I feel that
I cannot say enough about your bike.
I shall never ride any other again.

PAid FOR The TiiiNG8
THE TEA-BASKET.
WHEN the sympathetic porter asked
me if I would like a tea-basket I quickly
assented, thinking in my innocence
that its presence on the carriage seat
would brighten the gloom of my return
Journey to London after the holidays.
"And let me have some raspberry jam,”
I called to him out of the window, for
I was alone in the compartment. But
at that moment my attention was at-
tracted to a train steaming up to an
Adjoining platform and disgorging a
load of hot, flurried people. Before I
realised the full significance of the in-
cident some thirty-five people, with
animals, vegetables and babies, precipi-
tated themselves into the seclusion of
my compartment.
When I recovered my breath and
looked round, I saw that my first
estimate was a little exaggerated,
and that as a matter of fact only the
legal number filled the carriage. Öppo.
site to me sat a severe-looking lady in
rusty black, nursing a toy Pomeranian
of the same colour; next to her came
* anxious young mother with a damp
shining face, in a soiled white silk blouse
With elbow sleeves. She was accompanied
by a healthy-looking boy about two
years old, also much travel-stained, who
was eating a banana, or part of it, and
plastering his face and hair with the
rest. Further on sat a strenuous-looking
man about fifty years of age, a Free
Church Minister from his appearance,
who, after depositing his soft black hat
on the rack, immediately lost touch with
his surroundings behind the pages of
The British Weekly.
My view of the occupants of my own
seat was entirely blocked by the ample
proportions of the portly gentleman who
had deposited himself at my side, or
rather on my side, and whose left arm
and shoulder had the upper berth of
my right. He was wearing a summer
suit of black-and-white check, and seemed
to be suffering from some lung trouble.
I was just trying to wriggle myself into
a more comfortable position when the
sympathetic porter looked in and
plumped the tea-basket on my knee. I
had forgotten it; and really it seemed
the last straw, though in point of fact
it was only the first. There was no
time to demur, so I hastily found my
skirt pocket and paid for the wretched
thing, and next moment we had started,
and the porter was complacently pocket-
ing a tip which, in consequence of my
agitation, consisted of half-a-crown and
a penny. Presently, when the express
had settled down into her stride and
my companions had done glaring at me
and my unfortunate burden, I lifted the
lid with my only available hand and
looked inside.
Oh, what an orgie I might have
had under favourable conditions ---
dainty brown teapot, steaming at
the spout, bread-and-butter, raspberry
jam, and most tempting cake simply
studded with currants! I could not
resist the sight; and it is only due to
my fellow-passengers to record that, as
soon as I set about the business of eating
and drinking, they all looked the other
way in order to save me from embarrass-
ment. All, that is, but the dog and the
baby, and these took a passionate and
unconcealed interest in my proceedings;
the child being specially fascinated by
my attempts to get the tea out of the
cup into my mouth while travelling at
sixty miles an hour, and the dog eying
the cake with such pitiful entreaty that
I felt impelled to present it with a
chunk, which it snapped in and bolted
in one movement.
“Oh ” exclaimed the severe lady,
who had been studying the landscape,
“what was that? You didn't give him
any cake 2"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[SEPTEMBER 12, 1906.
I flinched before her and admitted
the fact.
“Not currant 2" she gasped. “Then
you've killed him " I had just taken
him away for a change, and his diet is
a matter of life or death. I have already
paid the veterinary surgeon £2 18s. 6 l.
Heaven knows what the next bill will
be ' " It was at this juncture that the
baby made a sudden dash at the basket,
and took a handful of jam, which it
spread lavishly on my neighbour's light
check trousers on its way lack to its
mother's knee.
Luckily he was asleep, and the cries
of the child under chastisement did
not rouse him ; and I believe he would
have remained in that enviable condition
for the rest of the journey but for the
appearance of an importunate wasp,
also after the jam, and the subsequent
behaviour of the Free Church Minister.
Evidently regarding himself as a cham-
pion wasp-killer, he emerged from his
seclusion and went round the carriage
flapping wildly with his folded British
Weekly. The wasp escaped every
time. Finding that the only restful
place in the vicinity was the bald head
of my sleeping neighbour, it settled there
for a moment to review the situation. It
was a fatal step. Down came the British
Weekly, this time unerringly ; the
dead wasp tumbled into my teacup,
while, with the trumpet of a wounded
elephant, the portly gentleman went
straight for the throat of the Free Church
Minister. It was only his collar that
saved him; his collar, and a natural gift
of eloquence by which he succeeded in
convincing his victim that it is better
to wake with a start than to die of
blood-poisoning. -
Meanwhile there was still good tea in
the pot, although the wasp had spoilt
what was in my cup, and determining
to get something for my money (I had
just discovered the loss of the half-
crown) I threw the half-cup out of the
window as we sped along, and proceeded
to help myself to more. We were slow-
ing up, and I found drinking less pre-
carious and almost enjoyable, when
unusual sounds from the corridor at the
other side of the carriage caught my
ear—sounds of a man's voice raised in
righteous indignation and a child crying
lustily. Immediately afterwards a burly
man of the artizan class passed down
the corridor, leading a weeping child
whose face and print blous? were stream-
ing with a brownish liquid, while the
body of a dead wasp dangled in its front
curls. My blood froze. I looked hastily
at my companions, who were all engrossed
in personal matters. The Minister had
once more retired behind his British
Weekly, the rusty lady was massaging
her dog's digestive organs, and the young
mother was furtively watching my
neighbour, who was gazing in a dazed
apoplectic manner at the smear of jam
on his trousers. It had only that
moment caught his eye.
“Look 'ere, guv'nor,” I heard the
man in the corridor shouting to some
unseen official—“I want the law on
somebody. This nipper of mine was
leanin' out o' winder—when all of a
Innonnent * *
I waited to hear no more. Extricating
myself with a quick sinuous movement
from my spreading neighbour, I rose
resolutely, placed the tea-basket on my
seat, and left the carriage as the train
drew up at a busy junction; nor did I
emerge from the concealment of the
crowded waiting-room until it was once
more on its way to London.
An hour later I caught a slow up-
train, and the kindly guard who sug-
gested a tea-basket seemed quite dis-
concerted at the bitterness of my refusal.
“HAVE WE LIVED BEFORE 2 ”
I Got up and dusted my knees. I
wasn't angry; pained rather.
“I don't think you quite realise what
it is you're missing,” I said.
“What I've missed,” said KATE deci-
sively.
“To you,” I went on, “I seem just
an ordinary person; but four thousand
years ago, let me tell you, I was a man
of some importance. Do you realise
that you are talking to-that, in fact,
you have just refused—one who four
thousand years ago was the King of
BABYLON's favourite General ”
“Fancy!” said KATE.
“Yes. I don't want to boast, but
that's what I was. I often have visions
of those days, and I seem to see myself
marching at the head * *
“Fancy you're being the Generall."
said KATE. “Why I remember him so
well. A funny little man with bow
legs—” -
“You remember?”
“Yes. Why, I was the
favourite daughter.”
This was a little too much.
“The King had no daughter,” I said
coldly. “I distinctly remember him
telling me. It worried him a good
deal. There was an adopted daughter
with red hair—you don't mean her,
surely 2”
KATE nodded.
“But it wasn't really red, you know,”
she pleaded. “Sort of chestnut. And
in those days you used to say you liked
chestnut—you know you did.”
I waved my hand airily.
“After all,” I said, “one never thought
much of those Babylon days. Now, the
King's
Crusades. Now those were times.”

“Oh-I don't know. Just looking
round.”
“Yes? Well, I was fighting. You
may scorn me now, but let me tell you I
was very popular with the ladies in those
days. I used to wear—ahem – their
gages in my—er—helm. As many as
three at once sometimes. You've never
seen me in a helm, have you? No-well
then don't talk.”
KATE was silent for a little, while I
wondered how much more of the family
history I should tell her. There had
been an unpleasant episode about the
sixth century (never spoken of in the
home circle) when I had so far forgotten
myself as to be a hippopotamus in East
Africa; really the only time we went
into trade, as it were. It would be folly
to drag that up now.
“Were you in Rome about 550 A.D.’”
asked KATE suddenly.
“Er—oh, no. Not Rome.”
“Where were you?”
“Travelling abroad a good deal. East
Africa, and so on.”
“I didn't know Africa had been dis-
covered then 2''
“Oh, yes. I knew all about it.
Funny thing,” I added, “but I was a
vegetarian in those days. It was all the
rage with our set.”
“Oh I thought perhaps you'd have
been in Rome, fighting. There was
someone there rather like you.”
“Tall ? Handsome 2 Clever?”
“Oh, very. He knew Latin, and so
on. But quite silly otherwise. Why
I just happened to say ‘No’ to him
once—more from habit than anything—
and he never asked me again. So of
course I had to ask him. You say you
were in Africa at the time 2 ”
“I'm afraid so.” (I should like to
have seen it through. But being stuck
in East Africa—)
“What did you say to him?” I asked.
“Oh-‘Please will you marry me, Sir,"
—or something like that.”
“Only in Latin 2"
“In Latin, of course. And he said
‘Thank you,' or “Yes”—I forget which.”
“They had a very clumsy way of
saying ‘Yes’ in Latin,” I said. “I
think the scene would have gone much
better in English.”
“I understand,” said KATE with a
smile, “that an English version is in
the press. . . . Oh, were you ever an
owl or a bat or anything like that?”

THE DOGS OF WAR.
(By the Author of “A Dog Day.")
VII.
OUR SUNDAY CONVERSAzioMEs.
LET us turn now from scenes of strife
to the more pleasing picture of our
Sunday conversaziones. At these social
reunions there was scarcely a subject
The Looney.
that was not discussed, and when the
Captain, with his wonderful culture, was
present, no topic came up which was not
illumined by his trite and shrewd
remarks, so that I reckon it one of the
greatest privileges of my life to have been
present on such occasions.
THE PRETTY WIT of THE CAPTAIN.
What made the Captain's conversation
especially charming was the fact that he
was possessed of a pretty wit. He would
say things which would even make a
cat laugh. He was, indeed, first in peace
and first in war. He has been called,
with justice, one of the wittiest dogs of
the century. Many of his sayings I have
treasured up.
He was asked one day what he
thought of the one-meal-a-day diet for
dogs which was being advocated by the
digestion reformers. He replied that he
had no objection to it so long as the
meal lasted all day.
A poodle was bragging of his pedigree.
“My ancestors came over with the
CoNQUEROR,” he said. “Oh,” said the
Captain, with his inimitable drawl,
“from your appearance I should have
thought it was *. CUR DE LION.”
To another conceited hound he once
said, “Call yourself a stud dog ' You
look more like the missing link.”
The Captain was not above a pun, if
he thought it a good one—which, of
course, it always was.
One night I returned very late from
cat-scaring. The house had been locked
up, and my master had to come down in
his dressing-gown to let me in, and he
made a fuss about it.
“What excuse did you offer?” asked
the Captain.
“Couldn't think of any,” I said.
The Captain's eyes twinkled. “You
silly old Ears,” he said, “why didn't
you say you couldn't tell the time, as
you didn't meet a watch-dog?”
Upon another occasion he recom-
mended me to call a wire-haired terrier
and send a telegram to say that I should
be late for dinner. He made me roar
sometimes with his remarks. And it
was all done so easily, with no apparent
effort. A member of the Club received a
legacy under the will of his mistress.
“I suppose you'll put the money in the
Dogger Bank,” remarked the Captain.
Again, talking of toy dogs, he re-
marked, “Sometimes I feel inclined to
buy a pennyworth of weed-killer and
dispose of the lot of them.” And I have
heard him frighten one of these almost
out of his skin by saying, “Do you
know, Sir, that my men eat two or three
of you for breakfast every morning 2"
He always put things wonderfully
well. One of our members was guilty
of some little peccadillo–I forget now
what it was and the Captain decided
to give him one more chance. “You
say,” said the Captain,” “you are the
son of a retriever. Very well. Go now
and retrieve your character.”
Once he gave us a lecture on the
subject of falsehoods. “Let sleeping
dogs lie,” he wound up ; “you always
speak the truth.”
I could indeed fill a volume with
the Captain's dry remarks. And if he
could crush with a cutting word he
could also comfort by a bright idea.
For instance, when my ear was split in
two and I was suffering great pain, I
remember how he bucked me up with
the words, “Never mind, old fellow, it
has increased your value. You are by
way of being a curio now. You are
probably the only dog in the world with
three ears.” I smiled through my tears.
THE DOG-Show TALE.
And the Captain was an admirable
raconteur. No one could spin a yarn
so well as he. His best tale, I think,
was the one he told to demonstrate the
value of Dog-Show honours. The Cap-
tain declared it to be true, and we were
never tired of hearing it.
There was a gentleman, said the Cap-
tain, living in Ireland who owned an
Irish terrier named Kathleen. One day
Kathleen presented her master with two
of the queerest-looking pups that ever
saw daylight. Their sire, it was said,
was a French poodle, and one could
well believe that this was at least the
truth. You never saw such freaks.
About a year after their birth their
master heard that a Dog Show was to
be held in a village where he happened
to be staying at the time. Being of a
sportive disposition, he decided that, for
the fun of the thing, he would enter his
marvellous mongrels in the “Any Other
Variety” class under the name of “Bur-
mese Setters.” To his intense surprise
and amusement, they were promptly
awarded first and second prize.
The man's appetite was now whetted,
and when, some six months later, the
announcement of a really important
Dog Show, which was to be held in a
neighbouring town, was brought to his
notice, he resolved to let the twins try
their luck once more. This time he
decided that they should be “Thibetan
Eel Dogs.” Shortly after he had de-
º them at the Show a note reached
im from the Secretary stating that the
committee were greatly interested in his
exhibit, but unfortunately none of them
was acquainted with the points of Thi-
betan Eel Dogs, and the Committee
would be obliged if the exhibitor would
kindly let them have a few lines about
them. The exhibitor saw no reason why
he should not oblige the Committee.
So after dinner he wrote to say that a
Thibetan Eel Dog was the means by
which the Thibetan highlander secured
his dinner. The dog waded into the
shallow upland streams and knelt down.
The eels then became entangled in the
dog's long and shaggy coat, and when
sufficient eels had been trapped the
Thibetan whistled his dog out of the
water and dined. -

full in the official catalogue; the dogs

and carried off a second and third prize.
But they caused trouble.
Among the visitors to the Town Show
was an individual who had been also
to the Village Show. He wrote a most

ThE LOONEY AND THE

Although the Captain
was easily the most .#
liant talker amongst us,
he was by no means the
only one whose conversa-
tion was worth listening
to.
There was, for in-
stance, The Looney.
The Looney was quite
one of our most interest-
ing members. This
crack-brained fellow un-
doubtedly had a spark
of genius in his com-
position. It was a pity
that he was always so
absurdly unpractical.
He was essentially a
dreamer, and not a dog
of action. He was
always thinking out
wonderful schemes,
which came to nothing.

It seems that The Socialist had been
adopted by a wealthy maiden lady, and
had openly renounced his former views
on the subject of the redistribution of
roperty. Upon the death of the old
ady The Socialist inherited a large share
of her property and became one of the
honorary dogs, and so
increase our numbers.
He asked—and in this
instance I consider there
Was perhaps something
in his suggestion—why,
if King Charles Spaniels
and St. Bernards are
bºth called dogs, the
idea should not be cº
tied a step further?
But the Captain said it would be lower-
Ing Ourselves, and that settled it of
COUrse.
. One hot day The Looney lost such
ºutlereason as he had and was shot, after
* Illel custom of the Humans.
The chosen companion of The Looney
Was The Man-Hater. He too was a
fluent talker, and had ability of a sort,
* might have shone in an assemblage
where the Captain with his giant in-
ºllect was not present. Indeed, after
wealthiest dogs in the country, and the
last we heard of him was that he had
been elected Vice-President of the Gentle-
men's Club. May he die of fatty de-
generation of the heart |
The Man - Hater was made of most
curious material. It was not fur at all,
but a kind of mixture of cotton and silk,
He told us he was very valuable, and we
; never disillusionised
him. It was wonderful
how The Man-Hater fan-
cied himself. The Cap-
tain said it proved that
there was a Providence.
The Man-Hater had
no master. He lived by
his wits, and was a good
one for rats. Originally
he had belonged to a
faddist, who held that
dogs ought to have no-
thing but plain whole-
Some food, and that only
once a day, and not too
much then. Chafing
under this inhumane
treatment, The Man-
Hater went off one day
for a week's tour in the
company of some dog
friends with a view to
bringing his master to
his senses. On the third
day his master came to
the conclusion that his
dog was lost, and judge
of the pained surprise of
The Man-Hater (who had
always had a high
opinion of himself) when,
on his way home, he saw
in a shop - window a
notice headed, “Half-a-
crown Reward,” and con-
taining a most insulting
description of himself,
which wound up with
the words, “Of no value
to anyone eaccept owner.”
The Man-Hater turned
back with an an
growl and decided that
his master might keep
his half-crown. Since
then, as I have said, The
Man-Hater has lived by
his wits, and, like not a
few of us, has known what it is to walk
about with an empty pouch.
Adversity has soured The Man-Hater.

THE “SILLY”. SEASON.
TheRE is a Season, by the Press termed “Silly,”
When heated Justice doffs the wig and gown,
When Parliament is “up" (and Piccadilly)
And a great wave of dulness floods the town ;
A time when all the springs of news run down,
And London's papers, curious to say,
Become more interesting every day.
At such a time, in punctual iteration,
With a vivacity undimmed by age,
Sea-serpents of the largest circulation
Drag their slow lengths across the middle page;
And, where the Commons furiously did rage,
“Our readers” are politely drawn to share
The annual coursing of an autumn “hare.”
'Tis then that we regale the mind o' mornings
On strange, new foods wherewith our organ teens;
Mixed bathing, motorists, and ghostly warnings,
Alcohol, hats, banana-skins, and dreams;
Nor do we lack for those obscurer themes:
Are Husbands Selfish, Women worth their Keep,
And can one risk a Marriage on the Cheap *

The married man uplifts his tale of woe;
The hapless married woman puts in her say,
And tells one much that it's as well to know;
All are invited; each may have a go;
While many a lone soul sees his “borrowed name"
In print, and blushes not to find it fame.
These are the themes, not fleeting but perennial,
Which in the Silly Season we peruse,
Grudging no price--assured that every penny'll
Return us something to enlarge our views,
Something of interest, something to amuse.
Pity that, when they give such noble sport,
The boom in hares should be so very short.
For all too soon, the portent of the Session
Drives out the foaming orator on stump;
Bronzed editors return, and start afresh on
Some novel aspect of the Parish Pump;
The last hare dies; the boom becomes a slump;
And the Sea-serpent slumbers, roll on roll
Coiled in an editorial pigeon-hole. DU M-DUM.

Or, The Renewal of Youth.
“OPEN her out !” my host had said ;
And on the instant word
The mobile monster flew ahead
Like a prodigious bird.
Her thirsty throttle, gaping free,
Drank up the way like wine;
I almost felt that I must be
Upon the Chatham line.
From time to time she touched the earth
And pulverised its crust,
And I remarked, with impious mirth:
“We too shall soon be dust!”
Far off the cyclist heard our hoot,
And fell into the ditch;
We scattered man and fowl and brute,
Scarce seeing which was which.
Their curses followed, choked with grit,
While I, who paid no heed,
Composed a humorous song (or fytte)
Largely in praise of Speed.

A sudden whistle rent the air!
Instinctively she stopped,
For at the signal from his lair
A stealthy peeler popped.
As one whose joy comes doubly sweet
From triumph's long delay,
Slowly and trailing tedious feet
He moved upon his prey.
There sat we waiting, trapped and dumb,
And eyed that awful X
Like rabbits when the snarers come
To wring their little necks.
Two more arrived; their clothes were plain ;
One from his hedge-row bower
Had timed us going like a train
At fifty miles an hour.
I looked the liar in the face.
Fearless of fine or quad,
“I should myself have put the pace,
Said I, “at eighty odd ' "
And then as in a general hush
They took the chauffeur's name,
Over my cheeks there stole the blush
Of pleasurable shame.
I saw my truant childhood's years
In memory's vision rise,
And lo! the happy happy tears
Coursed from my goggled eyes.
IIow long it seemed since I was whacked
For trespass! ah, how long
Since I was taken in the act
Of doing something wrong !
Copper, my thanks!
Once more those fearful joys
Which the Olympian gods bestow
On lawless little boys!
Through you I know
NATURE STUDIES.
THE DRAGON.
I HAVE never seen this Dragon, although he lives on a hill
in my immediate neighbourhood, but I know him to be a very
fierce fellow of the true old Dragon breed. There may be
modern Dragons of a more refined and civilised type, but
these are not of the kind that any properly constituted child
would care to meet. Civilisation is all very well, but it doesn't
suit the nursery. The nursery, as I know it, is a primitive
institution and it revels in all the relics of barbarism. Its
porridge, its bread and butter, its dolls' houses, its hours, its
shoes and its socks are to all outward seeming the same as
when I first remember them in another nursery more than a
full generation ago. Its inmates display no greater tender.
ness of feeling towards one another than we used to, and
they howl with all the old freedom and sustained power when
they are thwarted or spanked. It is natural, therefore, that
the pet Dragon should be of the same unredeemed ferocity
and wickedness as the one who first terrified me. Probably
he is the same Dragon, but, as I say, I have never seen him
and cannot be sure. -
This Dragon has a length of about eighty feet; he has
green scales impervious to everything except an old cavalry
sword, which, however, remains suspended from a hook on
the wall and is never available for a death-thrust when the
Dragon is bearded on the top of his hill or when his muffled
roars are heard in the wood which forms his last retreat. I
ought to add that he can be killed by a skilfully directed
stone, if the stone manages to hit him in the centre of his
right eyeball; but in this case he is only dead for the day,
and infallibly revives in the middle of the night, unless it
happens to be a wet night. On wet nights he prefers to
remain dead. He has a forked tail, also green, and a barled
tongue, which is a very much prolonged and highly deadly
weapon. He has been known to sting a boy in the protruding
portion of his back round two corners at forty yards.
The boy himself has often told me the dreadful story. The
Dragon's eyes are red and he always breathes out fire.
The girl who related this fact to me thought that fire might
be comfortable on winter nights. In the summer, she
said, he ought to breathe something colder. Ice might do.
she supposed, if it wasn't so heavy, but then he was a very
powerful Dragon and might be able to manage it. His wings
are constructed.of burnished steel painted yellow and pink
and can carry him to immense heights, but he doesn't often
fly for fear the local policeman (whose name is STURBs and
whose cheeks are red and plump) should shoot him. SIt BBS
is believed in the nursery to be a pattern of heroism and of
all the sword-slicing and rifle-shooting virtues.
There is, I understand, a romance about this Dragon.
He had devoured twenty-five selected Princesses and was
about to devour the twenty-sixth when he was suddenly
struck by her extreme beauty and the sweetness of her
manners. He fell in love with her and proposed to marry
her and abandon his wicked courses. The lady, however,
could not accept him, for she was already engaged to be
married to a Prince who wore a white feather in a red velvet
cap and was always mounted on a chestnut horse. The
Dragon, with a courtesy that never forsook him in his lighter
moments, at once recognised the validity of the objection and
the insuperable nature of the obstacle. He caused a golden
cage to be built, and in this he confined the Princess, whom
he feeds four times a day on cream, honey, strawberry Jult
and sponge cake. In spite of this generous diet she longs
for her liberty, and some day the Prince will arrive, and, after
defeating and definitely slaying the Dragon, will release her
and marry her.

[SEPTEMBER 19, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO BRIGHTEN BRIGHTON.
THE article on “Brighton's Needs”
in The Tribune has naturally caused a
great sensation. As our esteemed con-
temporary tactfully puts it, there is no
suspicion of disloyalty to the “Queen
of the South" in the cry for reform.
In spite of everything, “Brighton still
remains queen, and the complaints now
voiced are only put in concrete form in
order that she may retain that title un-
dimmed.” Anxious to associate himself
with solaudable an endeavour, Mr. Punch
has sounded a number of representative
men, and is now in a position to present
to his readers some of the most luminous
and nutritive suggestions which have
reached him.
A leading architect writes as follows:–
“What Brighton needs is some sub-
stantial addition to her architectural
features. Happily an opportunity pre-
sents itself of which the Brighton Council,
if they are well advised, will not hesitate
to avail themselves without delay. It
is stated that the stump of the Wembley
Tower is about to be removed. I would
earnestly impress upon the City Fathers
of Brighton the advisability of purchasing
this splendid torso, re-erecting it on the
sea-front and completing its superstruc-
ture according to the original design.
I would further suggest that from one
of its upper platforms there might be
an aerial railway to the Dyke.”
An eminent novelist writes: —
“Brighton, in my opinion, has fallen
into a groove of placid and undis-
tinguished prosperity, from which she
can only be extricated by the importa-
tion or unsolicited arrival of some com-
manding and stimulating personage.
In the early decades of the last century
she owed her popularity to the Prince
and the Regency bucks. At the close
of the same century another Prince did
much to revive her faded glories. Now,
however, that Prince RANJITsINHJi has
become an Oriental Potentate, it is essen-
tial that a successor should be found
without delay. The splendid examples
of Stratford-on-Avon and the Isle of
Man point clearly to the choice of some
popular novelist. He (or she) should be
given free quarters in the Pavilion with
a suitable staff of liveried servants, state
motor-cars, trumpeters, &c., and a salary
of not less than £10,000 a year. The
appointment should be for five years
and carry with it the prefix of Beau or
Belle, e.g., Beau CAINE or Belle MARIE.”
A leading engineer writes:– “The
congestion of traffic on the front being
admittedly the worst of Brighton's evils,
I would suggest as an obvious remedy
the construction of a tube which would
relieve the pressure and enable visitors
to avoid the glare of the sun during the
dog days.”
A leading archdeacon writes:–
“Brighton has its Roedean and Has-
socks. But its clerical equipment is
clearly incomplete without a Bishop.
This long-felt want should be made
good without delay.”
“WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH A
BACK-YARD.”

article in The Daily Mail, I have decided
to convert my back-yard into a country-
house pleasaunce or demesne, and would

or two little things to each other, and
she was distinctly inclined to be catty.
It's all blown over now, however. I can
afford to forgive her and to be mag-
nanimous, for our shooting-skirts have
made it obvious to all and sundry that
her feet are quite a size larger than
mine.
And here's a scrap of philosophy
from your BLANCIE en passant. I hear
that some poky people are disquieting
themselves over the question – Ought
women to go out with the guns 2 Such
drivel, you know ! As if it was a
question of anything in the world but
feet and ankles.
When you hear a woman say, “Oh,
the men don't want us with them when
they're shooting,”—or, “Oh, the dear,
pretty birds, I'd be sorry to kill any of
them 1 "-observe that woman closely,
and you'll find Nature has been having
a little joke with her about ankles, and
that as to feet she can't be comfortable
in anything smaller than fives.
-This place is so altered since I stayed
here two years ago, before the BELFONTs
sold it, that I should hardly know it.

The old Belfont Ghost, no doubt, has
quitted in disgust. It was a cavalier,
with lace collar and love-lock complete,
and used to appear in the picture gallery
on a certain night in the year when
someone was killed or something, ages
ago. Norty says that if the BULLYON-
BouxDERMERE people hear any whispers
of a ghost being wanted, they'll have
an electric one installed straight, and
when you want it to “walk” you'll
only have to press a button marked
“Ghost.”
My dear, it's the funniest thing !
You must know, our so-called host and
hostess have engaged the great PIERRE,
who was chef at the Magnificent—and
we're all obsessed with the notion every
night that we're dining at the Mag. or
some other big restaurant. The other

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CHRONICLES OF THE CHESTNUT CLUB.
OLD MASTERs' NIGHT.
(With thanks to “The Strand Magazine.”)
LIKE other and, it may be said, less humorous institutions,
the Chestnut Club held its grand guest-night last month, and,
to quote the elegant Latinism of Mr. Mo. JILLER, who was in
the chair, instead of relying upon its own store of muces
facetae, the President called upon their distinguished pre-
decessors to furnish what they considered to be their funniest
stories. The result was, as usual, inexpressibly facetious,
and everyone seemed pleased.
Among the literary guests were BICKENS and MACKERAY
(these being not their real names, but their real names with
a slight disguise, after our usual habit), Dr. Bohnson, OLD-
syſITH, Jibbon, Cobb Accio, BABELAIs, HILTON, ERVANTES and
CHARLEs RAMB; while the artists (whose names we always
give as they are, artists being more sensitive than authors)
included LEONARDO DA VINCI, BottiCELLI, FRA ANGELICO, P. P.
RUBENs, VELASquEz, Hog ARTH, REYNoLDs, WATTEAU, MICHAEL
ANGELo, REMBRANDT, J. W. M. TURNER, and PAUL Potter.
P. P. RUBENs's ILLUSTRATION TO ARchbishop MAUD's story of The
cu RATE's Egg.
The first to be called upon for a side-splitter was Arch-
bishop MAUD, who told an irresistible anecdote of one of his
curates.
It seemed that this young man, who was of a shy and
retiring disposition, unwilling to give either pain or trouble,
was breakfasting with the narrator, and in the course of the
meal was helped either by Mrs. MAUD or someone else,
perhaps the Primate's private secretary – the point is
immaterial—to an egg.
On his opening the egg, which he did with some diffidence,
the surrounding guests were aware of what might be called
a new presence in the room -unseen, but not otherwise coy.
“I am afraid,” gasped the Archbishop, “that your egg is
not a good one.”
“Oh, yes,” said the curate, hastily consuming a mouth-
ful; “I assure you it is excellent—in parts.”
The company having returned to some kind of conscious-
mess after their paroxysms of mirth, the Chairman called on
P. P. RUBENs to illustrate this capital story, which he did
instantly, the rapidity of his strokes being equalled only by
the blackness of the board. The result was by general
consent one of the finest things ever produced in the
Chestnut Club.
To the general satisfaction of the company, Jibbon was
then called upon to tell, if possible, a story from his own
experience. This he did with his customary lightness.
He was, he said, once travelling in the Midland counties in
a stage-coach, when he and his fellow-passengers were a
good deal troubled by a man in one of the corner seats, who
might possibly have been a commercial traveller of some

kind, or possibly had retired from business and was en-
deavouring to obtain audience beyond his due by masquerad-
ing as a gentleman, and thus taking advantage of the
sycophantism of the lower orders. No matter what his
calling or profession, or even trade, this person was very
offensive by his browbeating manner and his continual
supply of highly seasoned expletives and lurid adjectives,
with which he garnished remarks that lacked alike the
interest of fact or the allurement of fancy.
At length, turning to JIBBON, he remarked with an air of
finality, in the genuineness of which no one, however, could
believe, “Sir, I am a plain man. I like to call a spade a
spade.”
PAUL Potter's ILLUSTRATION To bickFNs's story of THE CLERK who
CAME LATE.
“Indeed,” said JIBBON, “I am surprised. I should have
thought you would have called it a sanguinary shovel.”
Uproarious as had been the merriment on the conclusion
of the previous story, it was nothing compared with that

which now shook the room from floor to ceiling. The
appearance of J. W. M. TURNER, chalk in hand, only served
to intensify it, and he made his amusing drawing amid a
very tornado of laughter.
Everyone having pronounced the picture a miracle of skill
in the customary manner, the Chairman called on BICKENS to
supply, if he could, a better and more hilarious conte than
either of his predecessors.
ºrs at once responded with the story of the witty
clerk.
“At a certain Government office,” he said, “there was once
a clerk who, instead of coming at 10, when the others did,
rarely reached his desk till 12.
“One day the head of the department stopped him as he
made his tardy entry, remarking, ‘Really, Mr. —, you
come very late.’
“‘Yes,' replied the waggish fellow, with a quick presence
of mind. “But see how early I go.’”
Almost before the story was concluded PAUL Potter was on
his feet illustrating it for all he was worth, his effort being
received with the thunders of applause that it certainly
merits, for never was a more brilliant thing done, even for
this club of masterpieces. -
The meeting soon after broke up, the members all going
home in each other's cabs, wondering how they could possibly
exist until the next happy might came round.
LANDLADIES’ “CONTROL.”
[This year the occupier franchise turns upon the amount of control
ºfby the landlord on the latch-key tenant.] -
ATWestminster Registration Court, PERCY CRINGER, bachelor,
33, claiming a vote as occupier of two furnished apartments
in St. James's, stated his landlady had no control over him
beyond reading his letters and using his wine for medicinal
purposes. She never answered the bell, or admitted his friends
unless so disposed. He believed she bad legal powers to
clean the windows and the staircase, but did not as a matter
of fact exercise her rights in either case.
Cross-examined by the Conservative agent.—Her intrusion
into his apartments when he entertained his friends was
entirely ultra vires and unconstitutional. It was untrue to
say he was in bodily fear of his landlady. He had reason
to believe she held skeleton keys of the cupboards.
By the Liberal agent.—He was free to sneeze at any time
he liked, and had taken a firm line on the matter of corkage.
He was a passive resister in domestic politics and in favour
of protection, his landlady being a free-fooder. Her “control."
lay entirely in the power of the human eye. He could ask
anyone to his apartments he chose –he did not say they could
get in. -
Claim disallowed by the Revising Barrister, who stated that
such a person was not fit to have a vote of any kind.

T0 MARGERY-FROM HER UNCLE.
MY DEAR MARGERY, When I heard that
you really had arrived, I got out the
broken tea-cup, filled it at the bath, and
drank “To my niece” with the greatest
enthusiasm possible. Had I been on
the stage I should then have hurled the
cup over my shoulder; and later on the
scene-shifter would have come and col-
lected the bits. As it was, I left that
part out; and you will forgive me, will
you not, dear Baby, when you hear that
it was your uncle's last cup, and he in a
bad way financially. . .
Personally I was all for coming to see
you at once. But you wrote that you
would prefer me to postpone my visit
for a week; at the end of which time
you would have settled down, and I
should be more in a position to do you
justice—the critic, rather than the mere
reporter. I don't know if those were
quite your words, but that at any rate
was the idea. So, Baby, here I am--a
week later, and just returned from seeing
you. What, you wish to know, were
my impressions 2
It is like your cool way, asking me
what I think of you. It was I who
came down to interview you. You were
a stranger, one short week on our
shores; and I wanted to ask you what
you thought of the English Ladies, what
were your views on Latch-key Voting,
and (above all) what was your opinion
of the English Press. My editor had
heard of your landing, and those were the
things he wished to know. Well–I
shall say that your views were undecided.
Two kicks, a cry, and something very
like a sneeze-you haven't quite got the
hang of our language yet.
You know, MARGERY, there was at one
time some talk of your being a boy;
and, in that case, your father and I had
decided that you were to play for Kent.
I was to have bowled to you every even-
ing, and he would have stood by and
said, “You should have come out to
that one, Sir.” At the public schools
they call this “coaching.” However,
that dream is over now, and the most
we can hope for is that you should
marry some one in the eleven. Your
father and I were discussing it last night
(in front of you –oh, what would Father
WAUGH AN say ?), and we had almost fixed
on Woolley ; but your mother objected,
because he was a professional. A trivial
reason, dear MARGERY, but you know
what women are. You gave a little cry
just at that moment, and I know you
meant, “Well, why not Mr. HUTCHINGs,
then 2" Well, we had thought of him,
only your mother says he will be too old.
I do hope, Baby, that when you grow up
you will be guided by what your heart
says, and not by what your mother
says . .
Your mother—I think you must be
careful in your dealings with that
woman. Above all, do not let her
prejudice you against your uncle. At
one time yesterday we were discussing
your personal features. “Her mother's
mouth,” said somebody; “her father's
nose,” volunteered another. “Look at
the darling's eyes, just like her loving
mummy's,” was that shameless person's
own contribution. Then I, in haste,
“But, I say, what about her uncle 2"
• MARGERY, your mother looked at you
thoughtfully. She looked at you every
way. And then, suddenly, in triumph,
she cried : “Why, nurse ! Of course!
Her uncle's hair l’’ -
They tell me, MARGERY, that as a
matter of fact your name is MARJoRIE:
and they say that the other reminds
them too much of margarine. That
just shows how ignorant they are. I
looked up “margarine” in the dictionary,
and it is called so because of its “pearly
lustre.” If that isn't good enough for
them, they must be a very proud couple.
Anyhow you are MARGERY to me: I hope
I have a mind above your commonplace
MARJoRIES.
There are many things that I have to
say to you, but I feel quite sure that
your mother reads your letters; so
perhaps I had better wait till I can see
you alone. I want you to insist on
always wearing shoes, as a little girl,
and not those ghastly thirty-nine-button
boots; also on not going to a boarding-
school. And I want—but I must talk to
your father about it. I like to think he
is still my ally. Time was when he
too knew all about the bringing up of
children, and though he has handicapped
himself by marrying, yet now and then,
when we are alone together, he is almost
sensible on the subject.
Good-bye. Give my love to your
mother. Perhaps we can trust her more
than we thought, after all.
Ever your loving UNCLE.
THE TYPEWRITER AGENT.
OUR hero was a Tinker. Tinkers,
reader, are as good as other men and
better than most. What, to take a
What? . . . . Well then, does it not seem
absurd that you should blame our hero
for being a Tinker, when you yourself
are a-but no, we will not tell the others.
Our hero was a Tinker, for after all
he is our hero and not yours. Tell us a
reason why he should not be a Tinker.
We are a nation of shopkeepers. A
Tinker is not a shopkeeper. Our hero
is therefore to be congratulated and
respected for his originality in striking
out a new line for himself. However,
if you really object on private grounds
to his being a Tinker, he becomes—such
-- , - a - - --- - a- --
is our courtesy—from this moment a
Tailor. -
Our hero was a Tailor. (Yes, yes,
yes.—We are quite aware that no man
is a hero to his valet. But, granting for
a moment that Tailors have valets, what
has that to do with the point 2 Is not
your interference somewhat unreason-
able? First you insist on our hero being
a Tailor and then you object to our
Tailor being a hero! Perhaps, if you
would allow us to tell the tale in our own
way and not interrupt, we should get on
better. Read it first, Sir, and argue
about it afterwards, if argue you must.)
Our hero was oh, but why keep up
this farce? Why not admit at once, and
have done with it, that we are our own
hero? We are neither Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Sailor, Richman, Poorman,
Beggarman, nor Thief. We are merely
an Occasional Contributor.
Some six months ago we mentioned to
a man in the train—it was one of those
unaccountable moments when one loses
control of one's tongue—that we had
noticed an advertisement for a new type-
writer called “The Whew ' " and added
that we should advise anyone to have a
look at this machine before buying any
other.
Never talk to a stranger, least of all to
a man in the train, about typewriters.
If you value your domestic or official
privacy you will avoid the topic altogether.
Murmur the word “typewriter,” and the
agents for the makers will give you
little peace till you have bought a
machine. - When you have bought one
they will give you less peace till you
have bought another. Then, when
buying typewriters has become a habit
with you, they will give you no peace
at all. .” - -
As we mentioned the word “type-
writer” we realised our mistake and
made every effort to recover ourselves.
“We never write,” we said with breath-
less rapidity, “indeed, we cannot write.
We have nothing to write, and could
not spell it if we had. Even supposing
that we had something to write and
that we could spell it, we should never
think of typewriting it. We have con-
scientious scruples against typewriters.
But even supposing that we should
permit ourselves to use a typewriter we
have already one of our own, two in
fact, and both in excellent working
order. Finally, supposing that these
two should get out of order, we have a
large number of relatives who possess
three typewriters apiece, and who are
only too glad to get somebody to use
them. So you will see”— and this, of
course, was what we were driving at .
“There is not the remotest possibility of
our ever wanting to buy this or any other
typewriter.”

off here, but we knew too much about
the business to take any risks. 'We
knew what these men are who want to
sell typewriters, so we pursued the sub-
ject. “Supposing,” we added after some
considerable tautology — “supposing,”
we added with a smile that might mean
anything—“supposing” (we really only
said it once), “supposing that you were
a traveller for typewriters—do not inter-
rupt, it is only an assumption for the
sake of argument—and supposing that
you were to call upon us with a view to
business, your action would be nothing
less than suicidal. In the first place
we dislike callers of any kind ; in the
second place the staircase which leads
to our office is very, precipitous; and in
the third place when we are in a ten per

The stranger assured us with some
show of heat that he travelled for
nothing but his own pleasure; had
never met, seen or heard of a typewriter
tout (his own word); would put himself
to the greatest amount of trouble in
order to avoid seeing our face again;
and was, he was thankful to say, leav-
ing England within twelve hours.
The stranger seemed to mean what
he was saying, but still we felt that we
were not out of the wood. We set a
private detective to watch him from
the time he left us till the moment his
boat sailed. The stranger complained,
he complained bitterly, he more than
complained, but we had him watched
all the same. We know that he com-
municated with no living being in this
country. He made but one attempt,
and that was to address a respectable
old gentleman who was possibly a
relative or a long lost friend. But our
private detective was a thorough sort
of person; if he did a thing he liked
to do it properly. He stepped between
them, took the old gentleman apart,
and kept him apart till the boat had
sailed out of hearing distance. He
then obtained from the shipping office
a written statement, accompanied by
numerous unwritten and unwritable
statements, to the effect that there was no

examining “The Whew 1" typewriter,

the machine, by an ingenious contrivance

was more of an advantage than a disad-

THE DOGS OF WAR.
(By the Author of “A Dog Day.”)
VIII.
MoRE ABOUT THE MAN-HATER.
MANY of us were vegetarians, but The
Man-Hater would not hesitate to bite a
man if he thought it necessary. I have
met him more than once with a sample
The Captain merely smiled.
of trousering in his mouth. His hatred
of humans amounted almost to a mania,
and the Captain frequently declared
him to be no more same than The Looney.
Myself, I must confess, I was very often
much impressed by what The Man-Hater
said. At times he would quite unsettle
me.
The Man-Hater was never tired of
dilating on the injustices which we dogs
suffered at the hands of humans. He
would refer to the insulting notices,
“No dogs admitted,” which one meets
with everywhere. He had even seen one,
he said, at a post-office--the very place
where the taxes which are so unjustly
imposed on us are paid. He was furious
about this, and wanted to form at once
a “Society for Biting Postmen.” And
you cannot take up a dog paper—all
edited, to our shame, by humans –
without finding its pages sullied by vile
advertisements of disinfectants. In the
largest city in the world there is only one
periodical, The Spectator, which is run
with the object of showing how clever
dogs are. Then again he would draw
our attention to expressions which
humans frequently used in addressing
one another, such as “You dirty dog!”
“You hound !” “It’s a night on which
I wouldn't even send a dog out” (even '),
“Leading a dog's life,” and so on. In
using phrases such as these, humans, he
declared, let the cat out of the bag, and
showed what they really thought of us,
for all their hypocritical pretence of
liking us.
And The Man-Hater made a good
point when he said that the fact that
humans tried to make us believe
that they liked us proved how they
secretly feared us. He was constantly
urging us dogs to assert ourselves more
than we did. Humans were only kept
in power by our stupidity. If we liked to
combine, he said, and sink our own little
differences, we could carry all before us.
He asked the Captain one day how
many dogs there were in London. The
Captain, whose encyclopaedic knowledge
was never appealed to in vain, answered,
“About 100,000.”
“Very well,” said The Man-Hater,
“there are 100,000 of us. Just imagine
what we could do if the whole 100,000
formed a solid phalanx, and marched
through the West End, biting all whom
we met ! Who could stand against us?”
I must admit that the picture appealed
to me—but then I was always easily
carried away by enthusiasm. The
Captain merely smiled and said, “Well,
bring me your 100,000 dogs, and then
I'll consider the idea.”
The only occasion by -the-by, on
which I felt the slightest irritation
against the Captain was when he threw
cold water on some grand scheme like
this. The Man-Hater, however, stuck to
his guns, and said he was convinced
that, if we only showed a bold front,
the whole human dynasty would crum-
ble to pieces. All that held it together
at present was our own mis-judgment of
our powers. We under-rated ourselves,
while humans over-rated themselves.
Human conceit, indeed, seemed to know
no limits. At times it was actually
amusing. He had seen, for instance,
the other day, in a bookshop window,
a volume entitled All About Dogs. Self-
satisfaction such as that really made one
smile. As though any man knew all
about dogs' They knew, of course,
just so much as we let them know.
Humans never seemed to guess, The
Man-Hater would continue, how un-
favourably they compared with dogs.
Why, they could not even do such a
simple thing as to follow you when you
went out for a walk. He remembered
that when he had a master and was
running on ahead he would have to
look round every other minute to see
whether the fellow was following or not.
Humans think they are intelligent, but
they are really the crassest fools on the
face of the earth. “Take, for instance,
the question of food,” said The Man-
Hater; “they have as much to eat as
they like. Yet – I have frequently
watched them at meals—they will often
leave something on the table. Show
me the dog who would do that l”
Then note how much more quickly
we mature than humans. Compare
one of us when a year old with that
squealing helpless mass of pulp known
as a baby.
And so he would go on. There was,
of course, a great deal in what he said.
There is a large amount of make-believe
about humans. Humans think they are
very impressive and all that, but I
happen to have seen them at their
amusements. Once, for example, I
peeped in at a “Dance.” There they
were turning each other round and
round for hours together, with stupid
expressions on their faces. And I have
seen my master in pyjamas. Believe
me, humans are not very fine fellows
then.
And The Man-Hater would, with a view
to weaning us from our respect for
humans, impress on us our great value.
Dogs, he declared, were frequently sold
for as much as £100, and he would
call upon us to show him the man who
would fetch that price. He had even
heard of the enormous sum of £800
being given for a dog, and by a charac-
teristic piece of sharp practice the dog
himself was never allowed to touch the
money he had earned. The injustice
of this he brought home to us by point-
ing out that £800 carefully invested
would bring in £32 a year. “Think
of the bones one could buy with that!"
he cried excitedly. Statements of this
sort would be received by the majority
of us with loud yapping. Value, The
Man-Hater held, should carry with it
corresponding rights. At a moderate

me, humans are not very fine fellows then.
estimate he calculated that the 100,000
dogs in London were worth £70,000,000.
This figure he arrived at from the fact
that he had seen it stated that a recent
exhibition of 3,500 of the most worth-
less sort of dogs, namely show dogs.

had represented a value of £250,000.
So much for their capital value. The
earning capacity of dogs, too, was im-
mense. At the Jubilee Show of the
Kennel Club they had made £6900 in
prizes—and it was significant that, when
dogs did care to compete at dog shows,
they invariably carried all before them.
“If only we dogs had a little better ||
idea of our-value, and showed a united
front, we could get rid of all our dis-
abilities,” he declared again and again.

noxious statute was withdrawn. More-
over I would remind such of you as
champion humans that, whenever there
has been any anti-dog legislation, it -
has always emanated from humans.
How long are you meekly going to put
up with this? At present, we dogs-
or some of us—protect our so-called
masters. If you liked to put forth your
power, all this might be altered, and
the more pleasant picture might be seen
of humans lying outside dog-kennels at
night guarding their far more valuable
occupants. Drive home your power,
dogs. The humans already acknowledge
it to a certain extent. Take, for exam-
ple, the, notice ‘Care canem, which
the Captain will tell you is foreign for
“Beware of the Dog." These mere
words, with no dog behind them, are
sufficient to inspire terror in the hearts
of humans. There is a tribute to you!
Consider what it means. Wake up,
dogdom '''. And I would growl, but
the Captain would merely smile and
shake his head.

A DANIEL come to Judgment In Charles Dickens
(METHUEN) Mr. CHESTERTON frankly states his views on the
man and the novelist. It seems a little late to deal with the
topic. But Mr. CHESTERTON is young, and what was said
before his time doesn't matter. He certainly has something
new to say. As with FoRSTER, the first gleaner in this field, there
is a good deal of himself mixed up with study of his subject.
He is persistently irrelevant, fearlessly egotistical; but it is
all excellent writing. His admiration for the author is un-
bounded, and never before was DICKENs so truculently treated,
a paradox quite in keeping with Mr. CHESTERTON's cultured
manner. He takes the novelist in his arms, and dandles
him after the manner of an impartial nurse. Tossing him
up he calls attention to his hopeless defects, and when he
thinks his audience

Old Curiosity Shop was in course of periodical publication some
readers implored DICKENs not to kill Little Nell at the end of
the story, he adds, “Some regret that he did not kill her at the
beginning "--a wicked suggestion with which I may whisper
sympathy. Another shrewd observation :-" The Marchioness
is much more of all that Little Nell was meant to be, much
more really devoted, pathetic and brave.” That remark would
have shocked DICKENs, who, in common with parents, had

counted Alfred among her “worries” if she had been thrown
into his society. He is actively annoying, while she is the
victim of people and circumstance. Her lot is cast among a

of peculiarly soft ones. My sympathies are with the lady;
and I hope it is some consolation to her to know that her
woes are enshrined in much the better book of the two.

[SEPTEMBER 26, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HIS EXIGENCY, SIR PETER.
For the central motive of Peter's
Mother, Mrs. DE LA PASTURE has left the
dull turnpike of convention, and taken
us down a pleasant little by-path of her
own. The wonder is that nobody thought
of taking us that way before. For
Peter is a sufficiently common type. He
is the sweet child whom “we all
smile on for his pleasant want of the
whole world to break up, or suck in his
mouth, seeing no other good in it.” He
is the preposterous boy-egoist, who
regards his mother (a pretty widow still
on the right side of forty) as an antique,
with nothing left in life to live for
except his better comfort and conveni-
ence. Still he is, somehow, rather
lovable; and now that he has had a few
home-truths from the girl he wants to
marry, and a fairly straight lecture from
his guardian who talked to him like the
stepfather he was about to become, I
expect Peter will turn out a quite decent
fellow.
I confess to being disappointed that a
play so short as this, and with so excel-
lent a motive, should have needed any
superfluity to eke it out. There was
too much tea-table tattle, and I could
easily have done with less of the catty
old aunts. I could even have dispensed
with the whole of the First Act, and let
Peter's mother start fair as an eligible
widow. I suppose this Act was meant
to serve a purpose by showing us from
how noxious a husband the lady was
about to be delivered before her capacity
for joy had been permanently blighted.
But a man may be very offensive (and the
Timothy Crewys, Bart., of Mr. McKINNEL
was surely every bit as offensive as the
author's fancy had painted him) and
yet seem something of a hero when we
find him bravely facing the prospect of
a fatal operation. At least he wins our
sympathy, even as the anguish of the
brutal Mihrab Shah moved Ferishtah
to pity: —
“Tax me my bread and salt twice over, claim
Laila, my daughter, for thy sport, -go on!
Slay my son's self, maintain thy poetry
Beats mine—thou meritest a dozen deaths!
But—ulcer in the stomach—ah, poor soul;
Try a fig-plaster: may it ease thy pangs!”
And certainly—whether it was the
author's bad judgment or a false note in
Miss MARION TERRY's otherwise charming
performance—the odium seemed to be
shifted from husband to wife when we
saw her receive the announcement of
his impending ordeal with unnecessary
callousness. Anyhow it is a grim way
of introducing a comedy to invite you to
watch a man all through the First Act
bracing himself to meet the surgeon's
knife; and then, after the flavour of your
entr'acte cigarette has been spoilt by the
thought of the surgical horrors going on

was not enough to go round. I think
perhaps that, as a playwright, Mrs. DE
LA PASTURE has not yet quite found
herself.
If she failed here to do a perfect justice
to her uncommon gifts, it was not for

lack of talent in the interpretation. In
the part of Peter's mother, Miss MARION
TERRY, as ever, was delightful. Of course
they had to choose a charming person-
ality for such a part. Any mother of
any Peter, on or off the stage, is always
a charming personality. Very natural
and spontaneous was the way in which
she betrayed the division in her dear
heart between sacrificial devotion to the
exigent Peter and her own claim to a
--~~---
share in the romance of womanhood.
Mr. FRED KERR, as the boy's guardian,
had nothing like the opportunity that
his workmanlike methods deserved.
What a chance for a brilliant dialogue
(the irony all on one side) was missed in
the scene where he instructs his incredu-
lous ward in the strange truth that the
world was not solely designed for his
(Peter's) delight. Instead, he had to
throw off one of those protracted homilies
which had come to be regarded as the
prerogative of Sir CHARLEs WYNDHAM.
Indeed, there was a WYNDHAM air about
the house. The theatre was his, to begin
with ; there was the voice of Mr. Buck-
LAw as the Doctor; and there was this
moral lecture by Mr. KERR.
Mr. A. E. MATTHEws was Peter. No one
else of course can play this kind of part
so well; but he talks far better than he
listens. It would be a graceless thing,
however, to cavil, even ever so slightly,
at the performance of an actor who has
sacrificed so much in the cause of art.
Others, ere now, have laid a love-lock,
a moustache, a whisker on the altar of
Thalia or Melpomene; Mr. MATTHEws
had his right arm amputated.
One critic, I believe, was impatient of
allusions to the Boer War, which he
regarded as vieux jeu, and could not
quite remember whether it occurred
before or after the Flood. I am not in
sympathy with him, though I know that
many things of very vital import have
happened since then. HAyward's record,
for instance.
Miss Hilda TREVELY AN, in an incon-
gruous red wig, represented Sarah, the
girl whom Peter loved next best to him-
self. To be frank – but not unkind,
for who could be unkind to the adorable
Wendy?–Miss TREVELYAN was not built
for the part of a smart society girl.
Next time I see her I hope she will have
her own hair hanging down her back
and be making love to that other Peter
whose surname is Pan. . S.
A Record Gate.

COELUM ET ANIMUM.
At home, ere I sailed o'er the billowy brine,
A large and a liberal outlook was mine,
The faults of the Briton
Appeared to be written
In letters remarkably fine.
The virtues of all other nations I sang
And glib from my tongue-tip their qualities rang.
It pleased me to praise the more civilised ways
Of Russia, Japan, Honolulu,
And to write myself down, while I lingered in town,
Pro-German, pro-Boer, or pro-Zulu.
But now 'twixt my far-away country and me
Lie leagues upon leagues of the stormy North Sea,
And the further I travel
The less do I cavil
At England, the home of the free.
In matters of food, I observe with concern,
Norwegians have much—very much—still to learn ;
And when, after nights on the pine-scented heights,
My appetite's rampant and skittish,
I'm startled to find that my once open mind
Is growing aggressively British.
Iwake feeling starved, and they try to cajole
My ravenous maw with an underdone roll,
Which, greedily swallowed,
Is instantly followed
By tortures that harrow my soul.
And when that is finished they ask me to cope
With mysost—a mixture of Cheddar and soap.
Then I think with a groan of the breakfasts I've known ;
My scorn of old England is shaken,
And I know I would give half the years I've to live
For that food of the gods—eggs and bacon.
At evening when, weary with travel, I feel
That dinner's the one thing that's earnest and real,
Norwegians waylay me,
Attempting to slay me
With aftems—detestable meal!
Crab pie and sardines and a sausage appear,
With a pot of pale tea and a bottle of beer.
Then I long with a sigh for the Carlton and Cri.,
Or wouldn't old JIMMY's be jolly!
And I cease to run down the luxurious town,
As I used, in my radical folly.
Then what though the fragrance of Eden be rolled
Down the fjord from its girdle of pine-trees untold 2
What though through the shimmer
Of evening there glimmer
Some myriad islets of gold 2
No trifles like these can afford me relief.
One thought and one only possesses me--beef '
No longer I'll praise the rude, barbarous ways
Of nations that curdle my marrow;
Henceforward my oat shall resound with a note
That's rampageously British and narrow.

CHARIVARIA.
The International Peace Conference at
Milan passed off without serious dis-
turbance.
The Hamburg-American Steamship
Company, it is announced, has abandoned
speed competitions, thereby following
the example of the S. E. & C. R.
Scotland Yard has drawn up some
admirable regulations for motor omni-
buses. The only one to which serious
objection can be taken is to the effect
that all vehiclés must be fitted with two
independent brakes. Brakes of this
sort are sometimes so independent that
they refuse to act.
We have lately read of a mechanically
propelled vehicle which consumes its
own smoke and is fitted with silent
machinery. This sounds like a descrip-
tion of the Ideal Politician.
Although women have not yet got the
franchise, they are, according to The
1)aily News, making advances. In its
account of a case in the Courts, our
contemporary says, “The accused had
been anxious to marry the prosecutrix,
but she was courting someone else.”
It was characteristic of the late
General TREPOFF's alleged contempt for
popular aspirations that he should have
died a natural death.
The latest autobiographical item from
the pen of Miss MARIE CoRELLI is the
following statement in the Rapid Re-
rieur: “The great are invariably
maligned.”
* There is no doubt that Mrs. LoNo-
worrii has now obtained a permanent
place in the affections of the American
nation. The other day she was mobbed
by thousands of her fellow-country-
women, who rent her clothes in their
enthusiasm. -
There is an old legend of an American
prisoner who, upon being asked “Guilty,
or Not guilty?” replied, “I guess that's
for you to find out.” A second chapter
was added to this legend the other day
at the Old Bailey by a thief who made
an eloquent speech in his own defence,
and then, when the jury found him
guilty, admitted, with a smile, that they
had got the answer right at the first
guess.

T0 HER UNGLE-FROM MARGERY.
MY DEAR UNCLE,--Thank you for your
letter. I was just as glad when they
told me about you ! And I said to my-
self, “I must be very nice to him, be-
cause mother and I have been here for
years and years simply, and he's quite
new.” And it's unkind of you to say
I kicked, I was only stretching, and one
must stretch or one will never grow. I
heard nurse tell mother that, and you
know you'd like to have a tall niece. .
I think I shall like you, if you're sure
you won't mind my being only a girl.
I don't think father minds, although he
looks very sad about something every
now and then. He came back late
from the office the other day, and mother
told me he'd done an awful lot of work,
and was so tired, and I cried all night
about it, I was so sorry for him.
Mother is a funny person. This
morning I did my trick of opening one
eye and keeping the other shut, and
she got fearfully excited, and called out
“Nurse, nurse, what's the matter with
Baby, she can't open one of her eyes' "
And then I simply had to open it, so
as I could wink at nurse to show her
what a silly mother we had. But I have
given up my other joke—of pretending
to be dead. I used to do it every night,
and she would creep out of bed, and
come and listen at my cradle, and . . . .
Well, I'm only a girl, and I shall never
go to a public school, but still I know
when a joke ceases to be a joke and
becomes bad form. So I have given
it up.
Oh, talking of bad form, some chemists
who had read about me in the papers
sent me a sample of tooth powder. In
rather bad taste, I thought . . .
I want you to come and see me have
my bath. Mother asks all her friends,
so why shouldn't I ask mine 2 Of
course I would rather keep it private,
but if mother is going to make a show
of it we may as well have the right
people there. Do you know, uncle, they
actually do it in a basin, although
there's a proper bath just next door!
I know I’m small, but is it quite fair
always to be harping on the fact?
(Twice a day, if you will believe me.)
Of course mother and nurse are only
women, and they wouldn't understand
this. But I am sure you, uncle, would
be more careful of people's feelings.
I am very sorry, dear, but I don't
think I shall be able to marry either
Mr. HUTChiNGs or Woolley; you see they
are rather old for me, aren't they?
Mother told me yesterday that there is a
dear little boy of four or five playing
about somewhere, who will come for me
one day and take me right away from
her and father. Fancy! What fun!
About my name. Well, I'm afraid it
will have to be MARJoRIE after all. Of
course I should prefer it to be MARGERY,
but mother assures me that the owner
of the name is never consulted, so I
can't say anything. But I will always
be MARGERY to you, and we won't say
anything more about it to the others.
Do you see, dear?
And now I must say good-bye, as
mother says I want to go to sleep.
She is writing this for me, and some of
the things she didn't want to say at all,
but I threatened her with my joke, and
then she did. But we both send our
love. Your affectionate niece,
MARGERY.
P.S.1—I shouldn't be a bit surprised
if mother didn't alter the signature to
“MARJoRIE’ when I'm asleep. If she
does you'll understand.
P.S.–I was weighed yesterday. I
weigh quite a lot of pounds.
P.S.s-Come to-morrow at four and I
will show you my toes.

SEPTEMBER MUSINGS.
(From “The Peasqueak Papers.”)
Howinteresting London is I cannot
tear myself from it. Day after day
brings invitations to this country-house
and that; but even in August and
September I find myself reluctant to
leave. Had I, for instance, accepted an
invitation to Surbiton for this week-
end, as I must confess I was tempted
to, for there was talk of a great romancist
being in the neighbourhood—no less
than one of The Daily Mail's feuille-
tonists in fact—within call, I should
have missed a most interesting remcontre
in the park on Sunday with Mr. Col-
Grove, the tragedian, whom I had once
or twice met before, but never to such
advantage.
Finding ourselves on adjoining chairs
we began to talk—or rather he talked
and I listened, unwilling to interrupt
such a flow of shrewd commentary on
men and things. I could not very well
take notes at the time, but as soon after
as might be I set down the substance
of his remarks. Referring to trouserings
for men, he said that the back buckle
has gone right out. In his experience
the turn up of the legs was a mistake,
its tendency being to impair the fluidity
of the line. On my venturing to ask
if he preferred cigarettes to a pipe he
said he preferred a pipe, and was much
interested when I told him that Sir
ARTHUR ConAN Doyle had once said the
same in an interview in Great Thoughts.
I asked him what part he was thinking
of appearing in next, and he said he was
undecided between Hamlet and Macbeth.
At the moment he has no theatre, his
plans for taking one of the large West
End houses having broken down. His
return to the stage will, I am sure, be
a red-letter event, for he has not been
seen on the London boards for fifteen
years.
To say that there is no one in town
in these months is ridiculous; for only
yesterday I met one of the latest addi-
tions to the Knightage in the grill-room of
a famous restaurant. Hereditary honours
are no doubt very interesting, but to
force one's way into Debrett by sheer
capacity for soap-boiling is to my mind
a finer thing. That is the difference
between the Baronet and the Knight.
The Baronet may of course have been
created, but in many cases he is merely
the son of his father; whereas a Knight
must have exceptional qualities or he
would not be a Knight at all.
It was my privilege not only to meet
this eminent man, but to meet him in a
curious and unforgettable way. As a
matter of fact I had my toe trodden on
by him, and was handsomely apologised
to. That nothing happens by accident

capable of understanding and appre-

could not see, in spite of his countless

[SEPTEMBER 26, 1906.
THE POWER OF SOUND.
To the interesting collection of anec-
dotes recently published in illustration
of the magical power exerted by certain
singers and players over their audience,
Mr. Punch is happy to add the following
supplementary budget.
Chirowix or PAGANINI ?
An extraordinarily moving incident is
narrated by Mr. ChirgwiN in connection
with a visit which he paid to a well-
known lunatic asylum. “I was asked
by a titled friend one day—in brief, by
the Duke of PLUMSTEAD"—so he relates,
“to accompany him to a home for
non-compots in which he, as a member
of the hereditary noblesse oblige, was
deeply interested. I may say at once
that I was very deeply touched, not to
say titivated, by the evident patience
and forbearance from complaint of the
inmates on my arrival, and I readily
consented, at the Duke's request, to do
my best to furnish them with a little
temporary pleasure by extemporising to
them on my one-string jamboon, which
as you know is a sort of violoncello
played with the feet and having a trum-
pet attached to the hurricane bridge.
“I accordingly sat down on my instru-
ment and played several little recherché
tit-bits from my classical répertoire
which I thought most likely to please
my audience, but after about forty-five
minutes my own thoughts became so
melancholy at thinking of the tragic
infirmities of my listeners that I uncon-
sciously began to play music which
reflected my own highly strung mental
condition. When I finished, and as I
sat still for a moment, myself deeply
affected by the emotions which had
found expression in my nimble and, so
to speak, lilywhite tootsicums, a member
of the audience, with the tears coursing
down his cheeks, rushed up, and flinging
his arms round my neck thanked me
most effusively and said he was certain
I could only be the great PAGANINI, of
whom he had heard so often in his
childhood. I should add in conclusion
that none of the inmates of the institu-
tion had been told of my identity.”
How A GREAT B \sso TURNED THE MILK
Sot R.
Signor ENRICO 130MBINANTE, the re-
doubtable Italian basso, kindly sends us
the following illuminative anecdote :--
“I had a most extraordinary and thrill-
ing experience a few years ago while
touring in Tierra del Fuego. During a
recital at one of the chief towns in
that picturesque region I was singing
MoZART's Qui silegno, an aria which, as
you are doubtless aware, gives a bass
singer exceptional opportunities for
wallowing in the abysmal profundities
of his lowest register. The climate—
possibly also the stimulating effect of the
knowledge that most of my audience
were cannibals—spurred me to unusual
efforts, and I was agreeably conscious
of having never before emitted tones of
such thunderous sonority. You will
imagine my satisfaction when I learnt
subsequently that all the milk in the
town had gone sour during the perform-
ance, and that I am still remembered
by the grateful Fuegians as ‘Pong-
chamburrawurra,’ or ‘the man thunder-
storm.’”
Polkovitch AND THE DYING ALDERNEY.
BRONISLAw Polkovitch, the illustrious
child violinist, who has not yet com-
pleted his fifth year, kindly furnishes
the following charming narrative:-
“Not very long ago an old Hungarian
lady of high rank who had been to
many of my recitals and frequently
expressed enthusiasm for my perform-
ances, sent me an urgent prepaid
telegram begging me to come at once
to her country seat. She explained
that she had a priceless Alderney cow
which was suffering from meningitis,
and knowing my love of animals ex-
pressed the hope that I would come
forthwith to soothe the suffering quad-
ruped with the magic strains of my
violin. The request was one which I
found it impossible to refuse, and I at
once repaired to her residence by special
train. I found that the cow was indeed
in a precarious condition, but she was
still conscious, and by eloquent panto-
mime made it clear that she wished me
to play her favourite piece. My sur-
roundings — the cow was propped up
with pillows on a four-poster—and the
solemn nature of my errand fired me to
unparalleled efforts, and I played as I
never played before. I am glad to have
done this, since my listener passed
quietly away before the last bars were
reached, and I rejoice to think that I
was able to give her pleasure and secure
her a tranquil euthanasia.”
MR. BEN Wyvis AND THE MAN IN THE
MoTOR-BUs.
“Some ten years ago,” relates Mr.
BEN Wyvis, the famous Scottish baritone,
“when I took the part of Bill Buttercup
in the comic opera of The Midshipmite,
I had abundant opportunities for ob-
serving the influence of melody over
mind. For over 4,000 nights did I
appear in the part named, and I soon
began to recognise familiar faces in the
audience. One old gentleman, with a
red wig and Piccadilly weepers, came
regularly once a week, always occupying
the same seat, until I came to look upon
him as an old friend; and one night, in
the ballad which I used to interpolate
in the Third Act, I inadvertently altered
the last words to ‘Down among the
dead-heads let me lie.' After I had
been performing in The Midshipmite
for about five years, I happened to
return home one night in a motor-bus,
when an elderly gentleman who was
sitting beside me said suddenly, ‘Mr.
Wyvis, you owe me an apology,' and
he went on to explain that he had been
so greatly fascinated by my singing
that he had been to see The Midshipmite
ninety times, until the night when my
unfortunate mistake had so wounded
his feelings that he resolved never to
go again. “I am not a dead-head,' he
exclaimed in a voice that rang through
the bus. “I have kept the counterfoils
of the tickets, and I paid every time.'
I had some little difficulty in convincing
him that I never intended to apply
the phrase to him, but in the end we
parted good friends. I never saw him
again, and I have no idea who he was
or where he came from, but it is evident
that he was one of those over whom
music had cast her magic spell.”

AN ANNUS MIRABILIS.
It has been a record year for misuse
of the word “record.” We cannot open
a newspaper (says The Liverpool Post)
without learning that something is a
“record.” Matters, in fact, have come
to such a pass that a new wing of the
Record Office in Fleet Street is about to
be opened for the purpose of enshrining
full particulars of recent achievements
and statistical discoveries. So many
superlative results have been lately
brought to light that there is a record
difficulty in making a selection. Among
them we may note that:-
The date of the present year (1906) is
the highest as yet recorded by the
Calendar before the initials A.D.
“Volume CXXXI.” never appeared on
the current issue of Punch before the
beginning of last July. This record,
we believe, still holds the field.
There has been a record number of
failures to swim the Channel this season.
A record swarm of jelly-fish was
encountered by BURGESs in his last
attempt.
Cambridge hold the record (viz. 1) for
victories in Cambridge-Harvard Boat-
races on the Thames in September this
year.
There is a record Liberal majority in
Parliament, and
Some people think they are making a re-
cord mess of Imperial and Colonial affairs.
The record in “pro”-ness, out “pro”-
ing the defenders of the Zulus, was
reached by the honourable member who
stood up in the House of Commons on
behalf of ruthlessly slaughtered (man-
eating) tigers.

We aimed at speech like MARTHA's, and missed it one and all.
And now you're on the sea, dear, while I am on the land;
I cannot see your glances, I cannot grasp your hand,
And, oh, the waves that toss you they cannot injure me,
Since I am on the land, dear, and you are on the sea.
You crossed the great Atlantic to view the Harvard boys;
With pretty rah-rah-rahings you swelled the Putney noise;
And if your cheeks flushed crimson when Harvard missed
the prize,
The heavenly blue of Cambridge was shining in your eyes.
Next week you'll land in Boston; the gilded Statehouse dome
Must robe itself in sunshine to bid you welcome home,
And Beacon Street and Boylston must sing for joy once more
When calm and undefeated our MARTHA steps ashore.
But now old Neptune sways you. You do not like him much :
He adds to lack of humour too boisterous a touch.
You cannot wheedle him, dear, as once you wheedled me,
Who linger here lamenting while you are on the sea.
SPRINGBOK SUITINGS.
WITH regard to the widely published descriptions of the
motley football kit displayed by the South African team in
their first practice at Richmond we are in a position to state
that although two of the players (see The Sportsman)
appeared in grey flannel trousers, not one turned out in
pyjamas; that CAROLIN's stockings were not scarlet but
a shade between crushed strawberry and flamingo; and
also-we have the exclusive rights of this information-
the collar of the official jersey is to be 2004 inches deep.
ACCORDING to Dr. CHARLEs FERNET, in The Leicester P.
|Mercury, moderate tea-drinkers are liable to excitement an
insomnia, “while a stronger dose rarely fails to produce
acute ‘theism.’” Upon enquiry of a well-known Harley
Street specialist Mr. Punch learnt that the practice of coffee.
drinking created a tendency to Pan-Islamism, while cocoa, in
an undiluted form, encourages a Confucian habit of thought.

LOVE IN A CAIR.
[“I have personal knowledge of marriages resulting from motor-car
courtships."—The Hon. C. S. Rolls. –1)aily Erpress.]
WHEN REGINALD asked me to drive in his car
I knew what it meant for us both,
For peril to love-making offers no bar,
But fosters the plighting of troth.
To the tender occasion I hastened to rise,
So bought a new frock on the strength of it,
Some china-blue chiffon – to go with my eyes –-
And wrapped up my head with a length of it.
*
“Get in,” said my lover, “as quick as you can
He wore a black smear on his face,
And held out the hand of a rough artisan
To pilot me into my place.
Like the engine, my frock somehow seemed to miss-fire,
For IREGINALI's manner was querulous,
But after some fuss with the near hind-wheel tyre
We were off at a pace that was perilous.
“There's BROWN just behind, on his second-hand brute,
He thinks it can move, silly ass!”
Said REGGIE with venom, “Ha! Ha! let him hoot,
I'll give him some trouble to pass.”
My service thenceforth was by REGGIE confined
(He showed small compunction in suing it)
To turning to see how far BRowN was behind,
But not to let BROWN see me doing it.
BROWN passed us. We dined off his dust for a league –
It really was very poor fun—
Till, our car showing symptoms of heat and fatigue,
REGGIE had to admit he was done.
To my soft consolation scant heed did he pay,
But with taps was continually juggling,
And his words, “Will you keep your dress further away?”
Put a stop to incipient snuggling.
“He’d never have passed me alone,” REGGIE sighed,
“The car's extra heavy with you.”
“Why ask me to come?” I remarked. He replied,
“I thought she 'd go better with two.”
When I touched other topics, forbearingly meek,
From his goggles the lightnings came scattering,
“What chance do you give me of placing this squeak,”
He hissed, “when you keep up that chattering 2"
At that, I insisted on being set down
And returning to London by train,
And I vowed fifty times on my way back to town
That I never would see him again.
Next week he appeared and implored me to wed,
With a fondly adoring humility.
“The car stands between us,” I rigidly said.
“I've sold it!” he cried with agility.
His temples were sunken, enfeebled his frame,
There was white in the curls on his crest;
When he spoke of our ride in a whisper of shane
I flew to my home on his breast.
By running sedately I'm certain that Love
To such passion would never have carried us,
Which settles the truth of the legend above —
It was really the motor-car married us.
WE are sorry to see that The Toronto Mail and Empire gives
an account of the Grasmere Sports under the heading “Wrest-
ling in Scotland.” We shall be told next that Woºdsworth
habitually wore a kilt.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FORM “C 2.”
FROM the moment that he heard the
bell ring he expected trouble. It may
have been instinct, or it may have been
that he always expected trouble when he
heard the bell ring. However that may
be, from the very first he expected
trouble.
He was an Articled Clerk. An Articled
Clerk is a creature that grows in a
solicitor's office, wears a blue suit, and
bears a close resemblance to the Office
Boy. Unlike the latter, he has no pay
and no responsibility; unlike the latter,
he cannot be promiscuously cursed. He
has less commonsense, and certainly less
knowledge of the law (and the profits)
than the Office Boy. He is also less
useful than the Office Boy, for he is an
amateur and the Office Boy is a profes-
sional; he is a nuisance, and the Office
Boy is an indispensable. He is in every
respect except dress the inferior of the
Office Boy. To have compared him to
the Office Boy in the first place was a
mistake.
Facing him there is an electric bell.
Beneath the bell there is an indicator.
When the bell rings and the indicator
points to No. 4, he goes to see what the
Senior Partner wants. He comes out of
the Senior Partner's room, repeats to a
clerk all that the Senior Partner has said
to him, and gets the clerk to tell him
what the Senior Partner really does want.
Then he goes and gets (or does) exactly
what the Senior Partner does not want.
When an Articled Clerk is not writing
letters to his friends on official notepaper
he is reading the daily papers. When
he is not reading the daily papers he is
playing with the typewriter. When he
is not playing with the typewriter he is
working. When he is not working he
is learning shorthand. Our Articled
Clerk was learning shorthand and had
just impressed upon his mind that “x”
was short for “.”, when the bell rang.
He welcomed the interruption. Why
did he welcome the interruption ? Study
a shorthand manual for five consecutive
minutes and you will not ask foolish
questions.
The bell rang and the indicator
pointed to No. 4. The Articled Clerk
was glad. But he was not glad for long,
for an unaccountable fear took hold of
him. Something told him that there
was trouble ahead, and whatever that
something was it did not tell him wrong.
The Senior Partner wanted an “Inland
Revenue Form for the Assessment of
Estate Duty.” That was in itself bad
enough. Inland Revenue forms are like
submarines, for they are numbered
“A 1,” “A 2,” “B 1,” “B 2.” and
so on. (They are nothing like sub-
marines to look at ; indeed, the critics
may suggest that the comparison is a
weak one. I am not, I admit, proud of
it, but at any rate it is better than the
comparison between Articled Clerks and
Office Boys. Why I ever said that an
Articled Clerk was like an Office Boy, I
cannot think. Butlet it pass.)
The assessment form with the long
name that the Senior Partner wanted
was numbered “C 2.” It is useless to
try to explain to you what these forms
mean. After six months in the office
the Articled Clerk knew what they looked
like, but had no idea what they were.
After thirty years in the office the Senior
Partner knew what they were, but had
no idea what they meant. The Articled
Clerk once went so far as to say that
even the Inland Revenue people them-
selves did not quite understand them;
but an Articled Clerk with no responsi-
bility will say anything!
He approached a clerk and said to
him, “The Senior Partner wants an
Inland Revenue Form No. C 2.” This
clerk, who had met other Articled Clerks
and knew the species, told him with
the utmost deference that he “would
find one in the cupboard.” The other
clerks, on being approached, answered
in much the same manner, except, per-
haps, the Confidential Clerk, who con-
sidered that his twenty years' connection
with the firm entitled him to say exactly
what he thought. Nothing was left for
the Articled Clerk but to get the form
for himself.
Possibly in the distant past these
forms might have been kept in some
sort of order, but that can never be
known for certain now. At the time of
this narrative they lay in a heterogeneous
and chaotic pile about five hundred deep.
It has never been definitely stated how
many sorts of Inland Revenue forms
exist, but the Articled Clerk thinks that
he met upwards of fifty and not less
than five of each sort before he lost his
temper. He started favourably with the
“A's,” and after some loose play among
the “K's,” he was soon back with the
“B's.” Then there followed a long and
irritating series of all the letters on the
other side of “D.” The climax was
reached when he suddenly came upon
four “C 1’s” in a row which promised
much but led to nothing . . . .
No one could pretend that five hundred
forms looked pretty strewn on the floor.
No one could suppose that there was
any pleasure to be got from picking
them up again. Furthermore, anyone
with any experience of assessment forms
knows that that violent sort of treatment
only amuses them and merely serves to
increase their obstinacy. And yet the
Articled Clerk has often told me that
the momentary feeling of personal
triumph (purchased at however great a
cost) alone saved him from permanent
insanity.
At any rate at this point the Confiden-
tial Clerk, in whose room all this was
taking place and who had work to do.
intervened. “A muttered oath now
and then I do not mind,” he said, “but
this is positively deafening.” He then
led the Articled Clerk aside and ex-
plained to him in a hurried whisper
the one and only way to get the form
he wanted. The Articled Clerk listened
attentively, and as he listened a smile
of devilish cunning spread over his
face. “What?” he whispered back.
The Confidential Clerk, who was a
tolerant person, re-whispered his advice,
and the Articled Clerk proceeded to
act upon it.
He replaced all the forms, shut the
cupboard, and then in low and distinct
tones soliloquised thus:– “I have
changed my mind. I think, nay, I am
sure that I do not want Form C 2
after all. I will devise a form for my-
self. I have nothing to do, and this
will afford me pleasure and instruction.
Besides, the form that I shall devise
may be better than Form C 2, and it
certainly cannot be worse. I never did
think much of these assessment forms.
No, I would not take Form C 2 now if
I were paid for it!” . . . . Then he
re-opened the cupboard quickly and
took the first form that came to hand.
Of course—What a fool he had been
Why ever did he not think of this
before?—of course it was Form C 2.
+ + + *:
This, you must admit, is an edifying
story with an instructive moral. You
say, “It is not true.” That may be, for
I have only the Articled Clerk's word
for it, and Articled Clerks are (as I have
admitted) an unpaid and therefore an
irresponsible class. After all, what
does it matter whether it is true or not?
You say that “it is impossible."
There you show your supreme ignorance
of the nature of Inland Revenue assess-
ment forms. Obviously, you have
never met an assessment form in your
life. To be perfectly candid with you,
I am afraid that you do not even know
what the Inland Revenue is.

THE CAPTAIN's ATTITUDE To HUMANs.
Unlike the rest of us, the Captain
The Man-Hater slumk off.
And not only do we starve in the
midst of plenty, but the price we have
to pay for such crumbs as we get is loss
of self-respect.
Even the Captain sat on the floor
during meal-time waiting servilely for
scraps from the rich man's table. It
would irritate me, so the effect on one
of the Captain's dignity may easily be
imagined. It was an insult to his
position.
And then the uncertainty of the thing.
We never know how much we are going
to get. When they give us something
from the table, they never say whether
more is coming. Consequently, we bolt
what is thrown us, so as not to keep
them waiting if they should want to
give us a second bit. But in ninety-
nine cases out of a hundred that second
bit never comes. All you have in its
place is heart-racking remorse at the
thought that you might have lingered
longer over the first bit.
And at times insult is added to injury.
Constantly my master, on offering me
something from the hoarded store on his
plate, has said, “Now, don't snatch!"

himself had snatched a hasty meal during
the day.
And some people seem to think,
amusingly, that empty praise can take
the place of food. They will admire

fact that I am straining every muscle of

Humans starve you, and then, if,
maddened by the pangs of hunger, you
become a thief, you never hear the end
of it. The wonder is that so few dogs
join the criminal classes. I only stole
once. It was game. Some dogs like
biscuits, others bones. I would sell my
soul for game. There was wild duck for
dinner, and none was given me. So I
helped myself afterwards to its entire
carcase. I was whipped for it. But it
was worth the whipping. I got the
best of the bargain.
The Captain held that, to obtain food,
almost anything short of murder was
justifiable. He even went through the
performance known as “begging" for
it—though I fancy this was never known
to the other members of the Club. The
scandal that one in his position should
be forced to such humiliating means of
earning his bread must be patent to all.
As for myself, I was often reduced to
eating flies. They make unsatisfactory
food, but they are better than nothing.
They say that fly-eating makes you thin
—but don't you believe it; that idea
was cleverly set on foot by the flies
themselves. I became in course of
time something of an expert at catching
them. I would lie down by the fire
and sham dead. The unsuspecting flies
would then think themselves safe and
try all sorts of dare-devil tricks with me
—and pretty fools they would look when
I suddenly ate them'
Talking of flies reminds me of a
whimsical idea of the Captain's. He
was asked one day, when a youngster,
what he would like to be if he were
not a dog. He answered promptly, “A
fly.” Pressed for his reason, he stated,
“Because it is so jolly to be able to
get a ride on horse-back whenever you
want to.”
CHURCHYARD SHOOTS.
(To the Editor of “Punch.”)
SIR,-Having read with interest of the
gallant stand made by the Vicar of
Gorleston in defence of church and
plate, we beg the hospitality of your
columns to announce that for the con-
venience of the hundreds of sporting
parsons who are certain to desire to
follow his noble example we have pre-
pared a complete outfit, at a reasonable
price, which shall ensure the maximum
of comfort with the minimum of risk.
Devotees of the new churchyard sport
would do well to write for our illustrated
catalogue (post free); but with your
permission we will mention briefly a few
of our specialities, without which no
church-burglar hunt can nowadays be
regarded as complete.
Qur leading line is our Family Vault
ing Horse, Armour-plated, bullet-
Proof, and yet easily portable, this con-

Evening, AND HE 'd G.Rown A Ridiculous MoUsTACHE.
Rs

trivance is certain to be extremely
popular. The Stalking-Horse is hollow,
and has the outward shape of a Family
Vault; it is fitted with straps and peep-
holes, and for a small extra charge can
have a heating apparatus attached, for
winter use. It is safe, it is warm, it is
dry. With our Family Vault Stalking
Horse strapped to his back, the clergy-
man has only to crawl about on his
hands and knees, his eyes at the peep-
holes, until he discovers the most advan-
tageous position from which to fire.
Should he, by any misfortune, be com-
pelled to retreat, he can do so in perfect
safety with this excellent cover at his
back.
To the hardened clergyman of mature
age, accustomed to canons and other
heavy artillery, we recommend our Fox
Terrier Teaser Pistol-dainty and deadly.
For inexperienced curates, we suggest
our Noiseless Airgun, with which we
supply a written guarantee that it will
not bang when fired. -
We supply also a fully-equipped
ambulance shed, at a very moderate
figure, which can be connected by tele-
phone with the Stalking Horse. This
should prove useful in the deplorable
event of retaliation on the part of the
burglar.
For parishes in which the church-
wardens and sidesmen are not in sym-
pathy with the clergy, and are therefore
not prepared to join in the sport, we can
supply our own specially trained beaters,
who are experts in bringing the quarry
within range, by low whistles and other
devices. These men are also skilful
grave-diggers. The unwisdom of allow-
ing the victims to dig their own graves
is apparent, as they are liable to dig
where they fall, and not always in the
most convenient places. The beaters
also act as retrievers; they pursue the
partially disabled burglar, and bring him
back, so that the sporting parson may
know for certain the result of his fire.
In cases where the sportsman is not of
a literary turn of mind, we can supply
graphic accounts of the hunt, for commu-
nication to the Press. Our Illustrated
Personal Narratives are particularly suit-
able for parish magazines.
We have only to add that one Sunday's
special collections would place within
reach of the poorest clergyman a more or
less complete equipment for the comfort-
able pursuit of the new and fascinating
pastime of burglar-hunting.
We are, Your obedient servants,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM deep in the debt of Mr. HICHENs for his new novel
The Call of the Blood (METHUEN). I love at times to wallow
in pages and pages of description of nice easy scenes which
I know, such as the neighbourhood of Etna. It is true that
Mr. HICHENs gives me no credit either for a knowledge of
Sicily, or for the meanest gift of imagination, or even (and
here he seems to depreciate his own power of producing an
impression) for being able to realise a picture till he has
done me a dozen-replicas of it. But then how few authors
give the reader credit for anything except an extreme patience.
However, apart from this habit of indefinitely multiplying
the right word or phrase (for Mr. HICHENs employs no other
kind) there is hardly a fault to be found in his book. It is
really a great, even a noble, achievement. He has chosen a
theme—the effect on character of a strain of exotic blood–
which is perhaps not too novel; and the main issue, frankly
exposed at the very outset, is simple to the verge of obvious-
ness. But to the working out of his scheme he brings so
delicate a taste, so careful an observation of types, so fine a
feeling for form and colour, and a technique so easy and
accomplished that he holds us always bound by the spell of
his artistry. He has succeeded in avoiding melodrama where
the descent that way appeared most facile; and by the gradual
and leisurely development of his processes he gives to each
situation an air of naturalness and inevitability. Perhaps
there is one exception: Maurice's childish desire to be present
at the Fair of San Felice seems to furnish a rather inade-
uate motive for that act of discourtesy to his wife on which
|. tragedy is made to turn. For, after all, he is supposed
to be a gentleman; and when a gentleman, educated at Eton
and Oxford, wants to pursue an intrigue during his honey-
moon he is always careful not to select a moment when his
wife is expecting him to meet her at the station.
The book is less a study of character than of heredity
and environment. Yet in the loyal Gaspare the author has
created a type whose reality is as unquestionable as its charm.
Between the two men, Artois and Maurice, the one born to
analyse life, the other to take and enjoy it, he has drawn an
admirable contrast. Hermione is an exquisite character.
Akin to her husband by a nature made for happiness, she is
yet more closely akin to Artois by her intellectual giſts; and
in her relations with these two men we remark once more
the arbitrary methods of sex in the matter of selection—how
º a value it sometimes attaches to affinities of mind and
soul.
Under any conditions, and in whatever form it came, one
feels that Hermione's marriage with Maurice must have had
a tragic end. She only hastens it by drawing his heart to
Sicily whose blood was in his veins; Sicily, with its heritage
of Greece, where Fate, as the Greeks knew it, had a way of
moving very surely to its goal.
From Libau to Tsushima (John MURRAY) is the diary of
an engineer constructor who accompanied the Russian fleet
which, on August 30, 1904, left Kronstadt bound for the
relief of Port Arthur. It takes the form of letters to his
wife, written of course without expectation of their extend-
ing beyond the family circle. That adds considerably to
their value. When the fleet had been out some months
M. Politovsky writes: “If you could but imagine what is
going on, if it were possible for me to tell you exactly all
about it, you would be amazed. Should I live, I will tell
you afterwards. No, there is no use our fighting. Things
have come to such a pass that I can only wring my hands
and feel assured that no one can escape his fate.” The
hapless Russian did not live to tell all. Wh. he has written
suffices. Among terrible stories of the sea this is unique.
In sentences whose graphic power DEFoE did not exceed,
he jots down from day to day what he sees and suffers. This
mighty fleet, equipped at boundless cost, moved slowly to
its doom, officers and men in a blue funk. From Kronstadt
to the North China sea, night and day they trembled with
apprehension that the Japanese were upon them. Some of
the crew, in the madness of terror, jumped into the sea and
so got inevitable death over. The officers drank heavily and
played cards recklessly. By day they saw Japanese cruisers
in every cloud. By night they traced a suspicious light on
the horizon and found it was a star.
The story of the sinking of the British fishing boats in the
North Sea is told with superb simplicity. At 10 P.M., on
October 8, “the Kamchatka reports she is attacked on all
sides by eight torpedo boats.” Three hours later, the hapless
fisher-folk being now within, close range, the frenzied fleet
opened fire upon them. “All the ships of our division were
ablaze; the noise of the firing was incessant; the search-
lights were turned on. I was on the after-bridge and was
positively blinded and deafened by the firing.” No fishing
fleet could stand that. We know what happened, and also
know how, after tremulously feeling its way across the seas,
the fleet came in touch with the Japanese and was itself
destroyed. Politovsky, hard at work in the hold of his
battleship, went down with it.
Miss MARJORIE BowFN is just seventeen
(So I 1ead), yet so brainy and gifty,
And, judged by her book (ALSTON Rivers), so kccn
She might be a widow of fifty.
With colours that suit an ambitious design
She paints, in The Viper of Milan,
A certain Visconti, the last of his line,
And a regular out-and-out villain.
On exquisite homicides, artfully planned,
His pleasure in life is dependent,
Until he is finally scotched at the hand
Of his meek confidential attendant.
The story's well-balanced ; the stuff of its scenes
Is neither too lavish nor thrifty,
And that's why I said that this maid in her 'teens
Might well be a widow of fifty.
Mr. BERNARD CAPEs must be tired of hearing that his style
is stilted, that he over-elaborates, that the way of his novels
is beset with awkward mannerisms, and the thousand and
one other things that reviewers tell him. I suspect that, if
his next book were no more difficult than “The cat is on the
mat. Where is hat, () rat?” he would still be told that “the
plot of this story is obscured by unnecessary verbiage." As
I read A Roque's Tragedy (his latest novel, that METHUEN has
just published) I found, to my surprised delight (or my
delighted surprise—the two emotions came together) not only
that I understood all the long words, but that I was in the
middle of a real romance, full of loves and hates and fights
and deaths, and that (if I may say so) one had no difficulty
in being in at the deaths. In other words, I found that
Mr. CAPEs could tell a story as straightforwardly as anybody;
He has, of course, a style and a manner-let us be thankful
that he has. But, to judge from this book, he is certainly
not over-weighted with his style. He carries it off easily.

As Official Report, just issued, states
that the Irish and other Celtic races are
more liable to lunacy than other peoples.
Mr. John REDMoND, however, is of the

country complete Home Rule.
“A Clergyman in Armour” was the
sensational headline which caught our

A contemporary, in its report of Mr.

figure should have been 13 inches. We
thought at the time that the journal in
question was pulling our legs.
The real meaning of Mr. HALDANE's
reduction of our army is now becoming
apparent. He has realised the import-

fewer the troops the easier they are to
push about. ----
A correspondent writes, suggesting
that the franchise shall be granted to all
women who declare their ages to be over
thirty. Such a measure, he says, could
do no harm, as it would be found that
only a handful of women would have
the necessary qualification.
Miss EDNA MAY has severed her con-

that lady's name appeared in larger type

the injustice have been rectified by a
reduction of Miss MAY's salary?

[OCTOBER 3, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GILT-EDGED BONDMAN.
I HAVE always been convinced that
Mr. CAINE is on the side of the angels,
but I believe he would be still more
useful to them if he spread his unction
with a smaller trowel and painted virtues
less appallingly heroic. The effect of his
method is to repel one from the path of
sacrifice. Clear in the limelight I see
the immensely better course, and approve
it; and then in sheer discouragement
I go out and pursue the much, much
WOrse.
If Mr. CAINE would only make as
simple demands of my soul as he makes
he was clearly, in intention, the robber
himself. Jason subsequently performs
many heroic acts of reparation, including
the saving of Michael's life in various
tight corners; but after this prepost-
erous argument one was tempted to
regard his actions, noble and base alike,
as those of an irresponsible innbecile.
This view was encouraged by a burst
of maniacal laughter to which he gave
vent on being arrested as a spy. I
could find no rational ground for this
bitter hilarity. He had been intro-
duced by a spy into the service of the
President, and their common object was
that gentleman's murder. Yet on being
of my intelligence' Intellectually I have
no difficulty in following him :
I experience no strain of the
mental organs; his character-
isation is never too subtle for
me, never too analytic. Mr.
CANE's target is the broad
bosom of the average British
god ; and every time he hits
it plumb. Yet, for all the
transparency of its purpose,
his new play contains several
obscurities, and one state-
ment so unreasonable that the
mind revolted against it and
all its issue. Michael, the
Manxman, betrothed to Greebut
(not of Greeba Castle), sails to
Sicily to repair the wrong done
by his late father to a Sicilian
woman and the son she bore
him. In Michael's absence
that son (Jason) arrives at the
Isle of Man on a counter-mis-
sion of revenge, is kindly
entreated, and remains for "Nº 4 => W to watch her face and hands

sends a note to Greeba inviting her to
come out and be married to him. This
letter reaches her at the moment when,
in pardonable doubt of Michael's fidelity,
she has yielded to Jason's importunity
and consented to marry him instead.
She now, very properly, cancels this
second engagement in favour of the
original. Jason resents this, and at
once resumes his discarded scheme of
revenge, saying in a clear and bell-like
voice, and with a large oath, “First he
robbed me of my birthright and now he
robs me of my wife' "
Now I do not blame him for being
chagrined, but I do protest against the
unreasonableness of this second state-
arrested as a spy he laughed ironically,
\ſ
Alſº
- -
º
saying, “A spy Ha! Ha! A Spy!
HA' | HA!!” As if it made all that
difference whether you wanted to murder
a man for political or for private reasons.
No : it was the laugh of a madman.
As for other difficulties, I never could
quite understand why nobody took the
trouble to impress on me till quite the
end that the Governor (as distinguished
from the President) of Sicily was the
illegitimate grandfather of Jason. I
should like to have had this interesting
relationship in my mind all through
the last Act but one. And again, P.
never gathered why the two Manx belles
in the Second Act were described in the
programme as “1st ('allow Girl,” and
ment; for, if a robbery had been done,
* 2nd ('allow Girl.” They were not at
all callow really; they seemed to know
quite as much as most fully-fledged
chickens.
As long as the scene was laid in Mona
things were fairly realisable as belong-
ing to a human order of things; but
when Jason went argonauting off to
Sicily it was no longer the Isle of Man,
but the Isle of Devil and Saint, with
scarcely anything in between. Jason,
possibly feeling “ the call of the blood,”
was first one and then the other. As
my neighbour put it, he was like a
Stilton cheese, growing better and better
with keeping. The sulphur mine, which
was his Purgatorio, was not near so
terrible as I had been given to hope.
It was open to the sky, like
the charming quarries at Syra-
cuse ; and the fumes, which
the audience was invited to
share, just as when Mr. PINERO
“brought the scent of the
hay across the footlights,” were
far less offensive than what
you breathe on a pleasure
excursion to the crater of
Vesuvius.
Mr. FRANK Cooper, an actor
after- Mr. ('AINE’s own heart,
was superbly in his element as
Jason. The same cannot be
said of Mr. AINLEY in the rather
anaemic part of Michael; but
this only makes his per-
formance the more creditable.
Mr. MELFORD was all that a
drunken priest should be, and
he was as good as ever even
after his regeneration. As for
Mrs. PATRICK CAMPBELL, simply
rudely healthy dairymaid
milking a live cow in the middle of the
road 2 with these uproarious harvest-
homers ? with these farmer-children,
almost insufferably gay, who bounded
about the place intoxicated with their
own innocence, or prattled comic prayers
at her knee 2 One felt how much she
would have given for just one glimpse
of Pelléas, one touch of Ibsenian finess",
one symbol out of SUDERMANN.
With regard to her gowns, in the early
scenes they gave a note of Parisian
urbanity to her bovine surroundings.
Later, she had no difficulty in assuming,
at a moment's notice, a more elaborate
confection, proper to the wife of a high
Sicilian official. As a marine deserter Mr.
Cooper was picturesquely dressed; but,

[Recent pedagogic literature and science
appear to suggest that the child is not the
simple and innocent creature that it was once
supposed to be.]
DAME SCIENCE happened to cast her eye
On a little child as it toddled by.
“Aha!” cried she, “I’d like to see
What this may be made of. It's new
to me.
My sister, SENTIMENT, loves to cling
To sugary fantasies, poor fond thing!
She never fails to tell me tales
Of the clouds of glory the infant trails,
And the wonderful whiteness which you
find
In the spotless snow of the baby mind.
But I have my doubts of the brat at
least
I'd like to study the little beast,
And to analyse those clouds of glory –
No doubt they are merely some old
wife's story.”
She caught up the bantling and called a
cab,
And drove it away to her up-to-date lab.
She tested its strength in health and
sickness,
She measured its length and breadth
and thickness,
Its eyes, its nose,
Its fingers and toes,
Its thoughts and passions, its joys and
WOes ;
She reckoned its tears in decilitres,
And the length of its smiles in milli-
metres ;
She calculated in parts of a gramme
The extra strain
On each vein
Of the brain
When the youngster formed the concept
jam :
And when she had thoroughly mastered
the brat
With a formula pat
For this and that,
When she'd studied each bit from sole
to Crown
Both right side up and upside down,
And outside in and inside out,
And through and through and round
about ;
And when she had measured precisely
what
The babe could do and the babe could
not,
Its powers of attention,
Invention,
Perpension,
And anything else you might happen to
mention,
She wrote a long and a learned tract,
“The Child as a Scientific Fact.”
“The child,” she said, “henceforth must
rank
With protoplasm. Its mind is blank.
It cannot concatenate chains of thought
Or ratiocinate as it ought.
Nor is its non-intellectuality
Made up for by anything like morality.
It loves excess in its food and drink,
And its ‘little white soul' - as we used
to think – -
As a matter of fact is black as ink.

sport,
Pugnacious, given to lies—in short,
An amalgam of envy and hatred and

AEQUAM MEMENTO.
Follow ING upon the escape of a pet
bear in the neighbourhood of King's
Cross Station, and the ineffective attempts
of the panic-stricken populace to re-
capture it, a well-known naturalist has
published some advice both as to how
wild beasts should be packed for transit
and also as to the quiet manner which
it is well to assume upon unexpectedly
meeting a wild beast. For one or two
situations, which seem to us to be treated
with scarcely sufficient detail, the fol-
lowing additional hints will be found
useful:—
ON MEETING A RHINOCEROS WALKING IN
PALL MALL.
If the animal should be approaching
along the pavement, you should begin
by crossing, though without any undue
confusion, to the other side of the
street. When there, try to look as
if nothing unusual had occurred, or
'ather, though this is a little more
difficult, to look as if nothing unusual
were likely to occur. Stare, with an
assumption of interest, at the Crimean
monument or examine a shop-window.
Twirl your umbrella carelessly, at the
same time studiously avoiding any
suggestion of menace. It is unnecessary
to salute the rhinoceros by taking off
your hat to it as it passes, if it does pass.
Once out of earshot you may direct the
attention of the nearest policeman to the
occurrence, and leave him to deal with
it.
ON ENGot NTERING AN ALLIGATOR IN THE
CLUB SMOKING-R00M.
This is a position requiring more
delicate handling, especially if, as may
happen, the alligator is sitting upon
the evening paper which you wish to
read. However, do your best, and let
your manner be as natural as possible.
It will be useless to observe that you
thought there was a rule about strangers
waiting in the hall, or to remark
pointedly that the club was far more
select when you joined it. Sarcasm of
this kind will be quite wasted. The
best thing to do is merely to light a
cigarette and ring for a lemon-squash.
After a decent interval it will be possible
for you, without wounding the alliga-
tor's feelings, to retire to the card-room.
A complaint might at some later period
be inserted in the book kept for that
purpose.
ON FINDING A BENG AL TIGER IN THE
STAlI.S OF A THEATRE.
Your conduct must depend to some
extent on whether you are alone or
accompanied by a party of ladies.
In either case an unruffled courtesy will
probably be your safest course. Some
humorous observation, to the effect, for
instance, that you did not know you had
come to the Hippodrome, might be
attempted, but you should be guided in
this by the mood in which the tiger
appears to be. If the play is a dull one
and the tiger shows signs of being bored,
seize a chance of slipping out between
the acts. We think you would be
justified after the performance in pre-
ferring a charge of carelessness against
the management.
ON BEING shut UP IN A First-CLASS
COMPARTMENT WITH A BoA-CONSTRICTOR.
Make some polite enquiry as to whether
the boa-constrictor would prefer to travel
with its back to the engine, or would
like the windows half up. Offer it a
newspaper, The Spectator for choice,
and conceal your surprise if it swallows
it. These civilities completed, we think
you should in fairness to the railway
company furtively summon the ticket-
examiner. If the boa-constrictor has
only got a third-class ticket and refuses
to pay excess, you should as a matter of
principle insist upon its removal to
another compartment.
ON DETECTING A PUMA UNDER YoUR CHAIR
AT A POPULAR RESTAURANT.
Here again we think some remonſ
strance with the waiter would be justi-
fied by circumstances, and could hardly
offend the puma. Explain that you
wish to deposit your hat, under the
chair. Point out that, with evening
shoes and socks on, it is impossible to do
yourself justice as a conversationalist
while the puma remains under the chair.
The least that the waiter can do is tº
give your party another table. Avoid.
of course, any disturbance, but quietly
insist upon so reasonable a request being
conceded.
NoTE. –In sending a Leopard as a
present to your aunt, it is absurd to put
it in a bandbox on the top of a hansºm
'ab, and instruct the butler to drive
down to Blackheath with it, though this
is better, perhaps, than going yourself.

My ºwn GRAcie, - Your Aunt Sophir.
and I have been thinking so much of
late about your brave resolve to earn a
little money for yourself and be inde-
pendent of your dear father, who has
burdens enough on his purse, Heaven
knows! We have not heard what you
have decided to do, but have grave
doubts as to the lasting lucrativeness
of poker work, unless done on a very
large scale. And book-binding, we
understand, needs a long and rather
expensive apprenticeship. Sweet - pea
growing, I read somewhere recently, can
be profitable, but that needs not only
knowledge but land, and I doubt if
your father could spare you that; and
I believe all the glebe is let. Poor man,
he will soon need all the rent the glebe
brings in if these terrible Radicals have
their own way much longer, with their
dreadful views about the Church. But
what I wanted to tell you was that your
aunt, when at a garden party at the
Hall yesterday, met a very attractive
girl who had already received three
guineas in prizes from The Westminster
Gazette, and is quite confident of making
much more. I doubt if you ever see the
Westminster Gazette, which is certainly
not your dear father's colour at all, but
it is in other ways quite a nice paper,
and really tries to be fair, I think, even
if it fails. We see it whenever your
uncle comes here, as he always brings
it with him. It seems that every Satur-
day there is a prize competition, with
quite good prizes, for literary people,
and you were always so clever with your
pen. Your aunt says that the one for
next week is quite easy-to write a poem
of four lines, the first two lines of which
end with the words “editor" and
“coastguard.” The prize is a guinea.
Surely you could do that. I will write
for a Westminster Gazette and send it
to you as soon as it comes, with all the
particulars. With love.
I am your affectionate AUNT META.

MY DEAR NIECE, - I fear you have
applied to the wrong source, nor even
if I had any of the mastery of bouts
rimés with which you are kind enough
to credit me should I care to waste any
time on such frivolity just now, when
all my strength is needed for the com-
pletion of the tenth volume of my com-
mentary, and even this letter to you is
making sad inroads on the day's routine.
I gather from your hurried note that
you are competing for some newspaper
prize. If you must do such things I
wish you would make an effort to win
one of The Westminster's guerdons
offered for skill in transliterating from
the English into Greek. That would be
worth doing ; but possibly you, with
your unfortunate addiction to manly
pursuits, are of a different opinion. I
wish you would try to be more like your
aunt FRIDEswipe, who had written an
essay on the Chanson de Roland before
she was your age and still knows nothing
of golf. If ever I can help you in a
more serious and worthy difficulty I
shall be glad to make the time; but
before you propound your queries I
hope you will be quite sure in your
mind that it is I, and I only, that can
answer them.
Your affectionate uncle,
13 Asif, HERIOT.

DEAR AUNT META, - I am not having
such an easy time as you expected, and
I am beginning to believe in the saying
that nothing good is ever done except
by hard work. JACK could not get a
rhyming dictionary second-hand, and it
seemed absurd to spend much on a new
one, and the stupid boy hadn't the
sense just to turn to those two words
in the shop. Uncle BASIL, too, was not
very helpful. He seems to think that
light poetry is hardly worth writing in
English at all. As for poor Mr. RAINEY-
SPONG, I happened to mention to father
that we were composing a poem in
collaboration, and he was furious, and
said he did not pay curates for that,
and made him visit all kinds of old
frumps as a punishment. But I think
it will be all right.
Your loving GRACIE.

MY VERY DEAR GRACIE, I have such
sad news for you. The Westminster
Gazette, which was delayed in the post,
has only just come, and I find, to my
great disappointment, that there were
certain very restricting and, I think, very
unfair conditions to that competition.
The rules say that neither “creditor" nor
“post-card ” may be used ; and this,
fear, disqualifies your really very excel-
lent poem, which therefore I return. I
am so very sorry to have raised your
hopes so groundlessly.

induce the people to take back the dear

[It is understood that, two or three months

To that miracle of joy

In the Press that you intended
Waking London up, I said,

In a burst of exultation
To inform you that you might
Count on my co-operation.
Eagerly, with mind inflamed
By your overtures, I reckoned
We would soon excel the famed
Giddiness of CHARLES THE SECONI”.
I could close my eyes and see,
In a glad, prophetic vision,
Dull respectability
Hailed with popular derision.
But as yet no pagan larks
Have been vigorously started
In the County Council parks,
And I feel a bit down-hearted.
So permit me to remind
You again that I am waiting
For the INowoly Life, and find
Hope deferred exasperating.
Therefore, if you mean to go
In for ostentatious sinning,
Will you kindly let me know
When you contemplate beginning.

Much sympathy will be felt for Mr.

very painful eulogy. In the correspond.

the subject of The Most Popular Novel,
appears this damning appreciation: -
“At school the most popular bººk
among we boys (sic) was Stally & Co.

Never perhaps have the merits of this
work been acclaimed with a more appal-
ling candour.

AND would YOU MIND
THE ELF-KING'S HUNTING.
Oh, the Elf-King went a-hunting (and I was there to see):
He rode a chestnut hunter and he sat him fair and free.
His cap was ruby satin ; his coat was green and gold;
And his breeches they were red brocade, a wonder to behold ;
And his merry eyes were gleaming, ever gleaming as he rode ;
And he glittered and he glanced,
As he caracolled and pranced,
With a word of careless kindness to the hunter he bestrode.
And his grooms came prancing after, and I saw the huntsman
pass
Very cheerfully and briskly as he rode across the grass.
They were all as neat and tidy and as speckless as a pin,
And the hounds came trotting gaily with the whips to whip
them in.
Then they paused before the laurel-hedge; the huntsman
laid them on,
All the merry little pack,
While the whips were going crack
Round the laggards as they lingered, till the lot of them were
gone.
So they feathered through the laurels, but they drew the
laurels blank;
And they cantered round the cabbage-patch and straggled
up the bank;
And the King he called the huntsman, and he said, “We'll
try the roots :
*-
It's not for drawing blank all night that I've put on my
boots.
We must find a mouse in no time, or you'll answer with your
head.”
And the huntsman said, “Ay, ay,
We must try, Sir, we must try;
But you'll be no better off, Sir, for a quarry when I'm dead.”
Then they took a strip of beetroot, and I saw them flash away,
All the rout of little riders, but I thought it best to stay.
And the horn was sounding fainter as it tooted here and there,
And I trembled for the huntsman, though he spoke the King
so fair.
But there came a sudden yelping all the beetroot leaves among,
And I heard a tally-ho,
And the music seemed to grow,
And I knew that they had found there, for the pack were
giving tongue.
Then they had it through the garden, through the Lovers'
Walk and all,
Through the orchard to the tool-shed, where the Elf-King had
a fall.
But he didn't mind a bit, not he ; he stumbled to his feet—
With his satin cap all battered in he didn't look so neat—
And they caught the royal chestnut, and they tightened up
his girth,
And the King said, “Try again ' "
But the huntsman : “It's in vain
While your Majesty's been falling every mouse has gone
to earth.” R. C. L.

OUR STRENUOUS AUTHOIRS.
(With acknowledgments to rarious trriters of
“literary pars.")
As the result of a non-stop run from
Cape Chelyuskin to Monte Carlo, Mr.
FERDINAND FUNNIKIN has just completed
a short story of about 2,000 words. It
will appear simultaneously in New York,
London, Hammerfest, Yokohama, and
Bournemouth.
Mr. PERCY Pott-Boii.EAU, who makes a
point of travelling 50,000 miles every
year, is at present on the top of
Popocatapetl, correcting the proofs of
his new short story for The Monthly
Paralyser.
It is statel on good authority that
one of our younger novelists, who has
in his time played the rôles of chimney-
sweep, pirate, cinematograph-operator,
bull-puncher, and steward of an L.C.C.
steamboat, is about to visit Patagonia,
Dawson City, and Peckham Rye, in order
to obtain material for his autumn volume
of 1907.
By a ludicrous printer's error we were
made to do unintentional injustice to
the literary gifts of the great romantic-
realist, Mr. MAKYAR SITTUP, in our last
issue. It was stated that he had travelled
1,600 miles in his motor-car, and had
interviewed 217 provincial rate-collectors,
before writing the first chapter of The
Ratepayers' Iºebellion of 1911. The
figures should have been : 16,000 miles,
2,117 rate-collectors.
Mrs. BANDURY CRossE, who is suffering
from nervous prostration in consequence
of seeing her forthcoming volume of
poems Harmonies of Rest– through
the Press, will go five times round the
world before essaying a new lyric.
There is an interesting paper in the
current monthly issue of The Three-
Weekly Review, entitled “Was LAMB
Really Great?” The writer points out,
with some cogency we think, that it is
rather an ungracious task to attempt any
estimate of the work of an author who
was never a deck hand, never owned a
motor-car, and whose travels seldom took
him further afield than Hertfordshire or
Hampshire. Had he lived in this age of
cheap travel he might have acquired a
prose style of real merit. In the same
paper the well-known deficiencies of
Addison's style are attributed to the fact
that he never visited Peru or the Tibetan
highlands.
The lady attendant on the Cornish
Riviera Express has been confiding to a
Westminster Gazette representative her
methods of dealing with train-sickness.
Besides physical remedies, such as
smelling-salts and soda-water, she has
medicine for the mind. “Often,” she
says, “a reference to the beautiful scenery
has the desired effect; the mind just has
to be switched off the subject and kep
diverted, especially through the tunnels.
We have particular pleasure in recom-
mending this idea of scenic distrac:
tion to travellers on the Tube or the
Metropolitan.

THE HOLIDAY KIDS.
(Invited by Helen and Cecil.)
I
DAD brought back the most ripping
sketches from North Wales, for the
bazaar.
But CECIL says it's jolly hard luck for
Dad to have to pay for his paints,
brushes, boards, and the hotel bill, and
then have to give all his work to be
bought in by Mother at ransom prices
on the first day.
But Mother gets so frightfully keen
on any bazaar that Lady MoxTFoRT
worries her into. She always wants to
break the record at her stall.
“It's so specially mean of you to
grudge them for the Children's Holiday
Fund, after you've had such a delightful
time yourself!” Mother said to Dad.
* Besides, it isn't as if I did not pay for
them out of my own money !”
Then Dad laughed, and asked Mother
if she knew what her overdraft at the
bank was, and when she would like him
to fill up her account.
“HAL, dear,” she said, “I do wish I
could induce you to talk more wisely
before the children.”
But it was while we were waiting at
Chester that we saw two kids on a seat,
with labels round their necks and bundles
on their knees.
Mother made a rush, and nearly
embraced them. Then she made Dad
whip out his sketch-book, because she
thought they would make such a delicious
design for the front of the bazaar
programme.
CECIL gave them the rest of the butter-
scotch packet. I'd eaten my share.
But afterwards, when Mother was
gloating over Dad's sketch with Lady
MostFort, CECIL said in his slow way:
“Why can't we have two live kids to
our place at once, and give them a jolly
time 2''
"Oh, my dear boy ' " said Mother.
“It's all very well,” he went on
severely, “to mess round with bazaars.
We would prefer the real kids them-
selves! We could lend them to you for
the bazaar—one shilling entrance to see
them alive and jolly! Do, Mummy!”
When CECIL calls Mother “Mummy,”
and stretches his eyelids wide off his
eyes, and twists his fingers about, Dad
says she is always at his feet like a shot
grouse.
But Lady MonTFoRT nearly sickened
me and CECIL when she cried out :
º Oh, Mrs. ListER, what sweet precious
thildren you do possess! How dear of
him to think of such an idea! And you
now it would be charming to have
amongst us the real thing, as dear CECIL
says. And who knows but what we
might cut at the roots of some incipient
Socialists!”
“It's ALL RIGHT, SIR.

Loft’ BLESS YE, SIR, I THINK
“What is an “incipient Socialist'?”
asked CECIL.
“Oh, my dear child, how can I
explain * A quite terrible being. Ask
your father.” -
Well, anyhow, they sent for the kids.
We insisted on having boys, and the
Tweenie Groom took us to the station to
meet them. They were awfully clean,
and had their labels all right, but they
seemed small somehow.
We watched them have their tea at the
coachman's, and it was awfully hard to
think of things to say at first. But CECIL
knows about Manchester, and heasked the
one with the broken nose and the stick-
ing-out teeth whether he had ever been
on a tram. He just winked, and said:
“When the blooming conductor's on
top, you bet!”
Then we couldn't think of another
thing to say.
It was better out-of-doors, and we
found that the one with the broken nose
was called CLINKER (he got his nose in
a fair up-and-down fight, he told us).
The other was called BRAssy. He has
such a weird face-like a sick monkey.
We thought he must have the hunip
about something.
As we dashed across the lawn towards the
park, they both looked round like eagles.
“Lost something 2" asked CECIL,
politely.
“Park keeper on the snooze, ell ?”
asked CLINKER.
“Oh, we go where we like ' " I said,
gasping.
Then CLINKER winked such a smart
little wink at BRAssy, and said:

ſide correspondence on “The Oldest Room
in the World" in The Daily Mail.
SIR,--Some time ago I was staying in
a friend's house, the major portion of
which was built by King Alfred the
Great. In my bedroom the Venerable
Bede conducted his orisons, and it was
in the same apartment- measuring only
12 ft. by 8 ft. that King Canute was
prostrated by the first epidemic of in-
fluenza that ever decimated these
islands. The buttery hatch was erected
by Ethelred the Unready ; the beautiful
rococo dado in the drawing-room was
put up by Anselm; while in the splendid
study, with its massive pre-Mycenaean
mullions, some of the most impressive
symposia in the annals of England have
been held ; and when the moonbeams
stretch themselves athwart the ancient
staircases and corridors there can be
seen flitting restlessly to and fro–I
myself interviewed her the other night
—the winsome wraith of sweet Anne
Boleyn who, with bluff King Hal, spent
the early days of her lume de miel beneath
this storied roof.
But there are, I fancy, rooms in Eng-
land more ancient than these romantic
apartments in the massive castle of
W--, wherein for more than 800 years
the household fires have been daily lit,
and wherein to this day men live and
pray and ply the busy quill.
Faithfully yours,
Roi.AND BLATHERSKITE.
SIR, Some time ago I was staying in
a titled friend's house where I had the
privilege of drinking some port which
was taken from the hold of one of the
great galleons of the Spanish Armada. It
was almost colourless, except for an un-
usually large quantity of beeswing, and
the taste was most peculiar, but as the
butler assured me afterwards that it was
only brought out on special occasions and
for exceptionally favoured guests I fully
appreciated the delicate compliment
involved.
But there must be, I fancy, port in
England even of a more remote antiquity
than that stored in the sumptuous
cellars of the Duke of R–, under
whose hospitable roof for more than 800
years the élite of rank, fashion and in-
tellect have been entertained by a con-
tinuous succession of high-souled as well
as princely hosts.
Yours faithfully,
T. Hu NTER-TUFTE.
DEAR SIR,-Can some of your readers
tell me which is the oldest fowl in the
world 2
I am prompted to put this query by
recent experience while lunching at the
house of a friend, when the menu

“Lord KitchENER is revising the present Army Veterinary System, one result of which has
been that veterinary doctors, whose experience has been limited to horses, have frequently been

included some curried chicken of such
extraordinary closeness of grain that my
hostess, though endowed with a splendid
suite of teeth, was obliged to abandon her
heroic efforts to finish her helping. Her
eldest son, a bright young Oxford under-
graduate, humorously suggested that the
chicken must have been hatched in the
hammer painted yellow like a bird’”
On pondering the matter over, it occurred
to me that here in form, if not in the
exact words, one had a perfect example
of the primitive palaeontological conun-
drum- the Urráthsel, as the Germans
would doubtless call it.
But there may be, I readily admit,
Ark. This, of course, was an exaggera-riddles even more antique than this
tion; but the fowl, to judge by the which convulsed an unusually represen-
stringiness of its fibres, must certainly
have attained to a good old age.
But there are, I fancy, hens in England
even more ancient than those which
disport themselves in the splendidly
equipped poultry-yard of the episcopal
palace of D–, wherein for more than
800 years simple laymen like myself have
been entertained by the great princes of
the Church.
I am, Sir, yours obediently,
PAUL PRIOR.
SIR,-Can any of your myriad sub-
scribers tell me which is the oldest
riddle in the world 2
While I was recently staying with a
friend who is the owner of one of the
stateliest homes in England, a fellow-
guest, who had not previously taken
much part in the conversation, suddenly
availed himself of a pause in the con-
versation at dinner to ask, “Why is a
tative house-party in the banqueting
|hall of a baronial mansion, standing in
a ring-fence of 2000 acres in the garden
of England, whose owner's rent-roll
runs into six figures, and who numbers
amongst his intimates the highest in the
hierarchy of intellect as well as in the
inner circles of Mayfair.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,
R. D'Oyly BATHER.
A correspondent points out that the
author of an article recently appearing

when he said that he could find no flashes
of wit in the work of Bradshaw. What

MY PEOPLE.
I, No less than the Captain, had
to perform parlour tricks for my food.
It was hard on a warrior to be forced
thus to bemean himself; still, as the
I curel her of her love for the trick.
Captain said, this is a world of com-
promise. My mistress even made me
salute, with an absurd three-cornered
paper cap on my head. The only re-
deeming feature of this tomfoolery was
the slight military touch about it. She
tried, too, to make me “shake hands”
whenever I entered the room in the
morning. I did this at first when it
meant a lump of sugar, but when she

her of her love for the trick. It was
one of the Captain's smart ideas. I
would go out into the road before my
mistress came down to breakfast, get
my feet thoroughly dirty, and, when
she said “Shake,” she would find a
damp, muddy paw in her hand. Another
of her tricks was to plant a biscuit on
my nose, and refuse to let me eat it
until she gave me permission. Some-
times she would keep me like this for
several minutes; and I often wondered
what would become of my prestige if a
member of the Club were suddenly to
come in. Sometimes, for a lark, my
mistress would press her fingers on my
nose for a second, and make me believe
a biscuit was there, and at the words,
“Now you may have it !” I would throw
up my nose; but of course nothing
would come off. The first time my
mistress did this, I remember, I growled
at her when I discovered the deception.
I also remember that the next moment
I was so ashamed of myself that I went
under the table of my own accord.
After that I always humoured her, and
made her think that I believed that
there really was a biscuit there, even Torpedo had almost done for her, my

My master, for all I know, may have

THE SECRET OF SANITY.
[Lord Rosebery attributes the growth of insanity to the restlessness
of modern life, and advocates as a remedy the cultivation of home and
the domestic joys. In the following verses he is supposed to be
addressed by one of his peers—a millionaire.]
My Lord, you lately let us know
That British wits are on the wane,
Hinting at reasons why we grow
Each decade more and more insane;
And I have thought you might
Be glad to know that you have got the answer right,
Not Drink alone has wrought this ill,
Or why should Mr. Asquith mope
Over the nation's liquor-bill,
And nurse inside the secret hope
That such as you and I
May, ere the 5th of April, be induced to die?
Rather the cause is vague unrest,
The constant itch for change of air,
The pitifully feverish quest
Of things that are not here, but there,
The quaint, the quite absurd
Passion, on everybody's part, to be a bird.
And you, my Lord, have rightly shown
(Speaking, as usual, like a book)
How, if we never quit our own
Peculiar hearth or ingle-nook,
This habit does a lot
Towards minimising any risk of mental rot.
That is your rule, and that is mine;
We both have learned the simple life;
On principle we both decline
The noisy stir of modern strife;
No man could point to us
As tearing round upon a motor-bike or -bus !
Prizes to which those others press
Whose ruder minds prefer to mix
In roaring commerce or the stress
Of vulgar party politics–
We two can well afford
To be content without them, can we not, my Lord 2
The gifts bestowed by Fortune's hand,
Such as they are, for us suffice;
We do not course by sea and land
Nosing each new exotic spice;
We do not need to roam ;
We merely move about from home to happy home.
A modest house in Grosvenor Place,
A park, a moor, a hunting-box,
Some decent villas, just a brace,
By Monte's blue, on Capri's rocks—
With these for homely haunts,
I, like yourself, revolt from jumpy outside jaunts.
Yes, you and I, my Lord, have found
The golden key to perfect calm,
And, while the Race gets over-wound
For want of this domestic balm,
Our nerves are never racked ;
We still contrive to keep our temperate brains intact.
The Faking of Antiquities.
“Six years ago,” says The Northern Scot, “there was erected
in Rothes a fine commodious church.” Since then, “the
congregation have been endeavouring to wipe off the date.”
THE MILAN EXHIBITION.
It is principally of railways and means of communication.
But search will be made in vain for the Pavilion of Truth
(Padiglione della Verità), with special exhibits of the Italian
State Railways. There are miles of locomotives and carriages
from various countries, but this modest, almost shamefaced,
little collection is not with them. Yet it should be some-
where, for it contains, among others, the following paintings,
diagrams, models and photographs :-
Model.-Interior of a first-class compartment, to seat eight,
containing one thin, small Eccellenza (travelling with a
Senator's free pass and entitled by the regolamenti to a
reserved compartment) and one thin, small umbrella.
Model. Interior of a second-class compartment, to seat
ten, containing four thickly-clothed passengers of the third-
class, eight stout ones of the second, and eleven, carrying
coats, cloaks and mantles, of the first; three dogs, a parrot,
two babies, twenty-three umbrellas, seven boxes, thirteen
bags and forty-one smaller packages.
Photograph.--Two locomotives, apparently a second-hand
purchase from the Republic of San Domingo, for the expresses
between Milan and Rome.
Photograph. A train of seventeen coal-trucks lost some-
where between Domodossola and Reggio di Calabria. The
Department of Railways will give a handsome reward for
the discovery of this train.
Model.- A solid trunk to be sent off by s-train.
Model.-The same trunk, eight months later, on arrival at
destination twenty-three miles away, completely smashed and
half empty.
Painting.—Five hundred German tourists waiting at
Taormina station, an edifice constructed many years ago to
suit the original local requirements of about three passengers
daily. Clouds of dust, in which the Germans have driven
down the long, shadeless road. Supply of beer in the
refreshment shed, four small bottles.
Painting. —Seventy American tourists, pale and fatigued
in appearance, trying to sit on the two benches on the
platform at Florence, while waiting for the direttissimo,
nineteen hours late.
Photograph.-A foreign tourist, when the train has started,
counting the number of leaden lire given him with his
change.
Photograph.-The floors of an Italian railway station being
washed owing to an accident, for which no one can be
blamed, caused by a sudden flood.
Painting.—An English tourist, with his family, registering
his luggage, secured by the official lead seals of the Govern-
ment, at a railway station. The Englishman is pointing out
to his family the advantages of this system over the English
haphazard methods, especially as the receipt given him
makes the Italian Government itself responsible.
Model.-Interior of the luggage-van. The Englishman's
º is lying about, every box and bag having been
opened with skeleton keys. The thieves are selecting what
they fancy. Fresh official lead seals are ready to be put on
afterwards.
Painting. The Englishman and his family opening their
luggage at the hotel.
Photograph.-The Englishman, on arrival at the British
Consulate.
Painting.—The Englishman, receiving eighteen months
later a refusal of redress from the Department of Railways,
and putting the case in the hands of an avvocato.
Painting.-Seventeen years later. The commencement of
the Englishman's lawsuit.
Painting.—Thirty-two years later. The conclusion of
the law-suit. Verdict for the State Railways, with costs
against the executors of the Englishman's grandson.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[October 10, 1906.
HOW TO SELECT A HUSBAND.
FIRST AID To THE PERPLExED.
UNTIL we had read the current number
of The Young Woman, with Professor
JAMES WEBB's luminous notes on phreno-
logy for marriageable maids, we had not
considered the subject seriously; but so
much impressed were we by that article
that we called in the assistance of Pro-
fessor WALTER CRANIUM to do an equal
service to readers of Punch.
Heads, says the Professor very sagely,
are of different sizes. This is a point
which cannot be too strenu-
ously insisted on. Some are
abnormally large, either by
nature, like Mr. GLADSTONE's,
or owing to artificial aggran-
disement. Mr. Bourchler's,
for example, is said to be
immense. Others are merely
big or middle-sized. Others,
again, are quite small, even
to freakishness, as recent
visitors to the Hippodrome
know. Bishops have large
heads. Hence their hats are
seldom taken by mistake by
lay members of the club which
they chiefly frequent. As an
extra precaution, however,
they adopt hats of a peculiar
shape. Lay members of that
institution, on the other hand,
protest that this shows a want
of confidence on the part of
the episcopacy, and threaten
to retaliate by adopting in
self-defence a non-clerical form
of umbrella.
Large heads make the best
husbands. Had I daughters
of my own I should say to
them, Marry large heads.
The sizes of men's hats are 6;
and 63 generally. “Sevens”
hats are common in Aberdeen,
and the professors of our
colleges generally wear 7+
to 8 sizes. Heads wearing
hats of the sizes 6; and smaller, or
being less than 21 inches in circum-
ference, can never be powerful. Be-
tween 19 and 20 inches in circum-
ference heads are invariably very weak,
and no lady should think of marrying a
man with a head less than 20 inches in
circumference. Had I daughters of
my own I should marry them to
Aberdonians. The first question that
the parent of a young woman should
put to the suitor for her hand is not
“Where did you get that hat?” but
“What is the size of your hat?” Much
is said about heart in love-affairs; the
hat is more important. Show me a big
hat and I will show you a serviceable
enough heart.
So much for the line of least resist-
ance in choosing a husband. That all
large-headed men are safe may be taken
as roughly true. Now for warnings.
Young ladies should look twice before
marrying, nay thrice, at heads culminat-
ing in a Gothic arch (see fig. 8). They
will thus escape the risk of an early and
possibly painful death. Archness is an
attractive quality in women, but the
Gothic variety in men is fraught with
sinister possibilitics. There are of course
exceptions, such as Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER,
who is above suspicion.
The pyramid-shaped head (fig. 3)

should also be regarded narrowly, as
indicating a three-cornered and tyranni-
cal disposition. No self-respecting suf-
fragette would ever care to link her lot
with a Rameses or a Cheops. To marry
such a person would be to attempt to
make a bosom friend of an unscrupu-
lous satrap. A pointed head has, how-
ever, its uses, especially at IRugby foot-
ball, where a forward thus endowed
may easily penetrate through the pack
towards the enemy's goal by sheer force
of using the thin end of the wedge. Still,
an enterprising Rugby forward does not
necessarily make the perfect husband.
Spinsters with heads six inches wide
should marry husbands with meeker dis-
positions, with heads less than six inches

wide. The wider head will provide
energy, aggressiveness and perseverance;
the narrower head unselfishness and
forgiveness.
While a head with a noble dome-
shaped crown inspires confidence, the
Norman arch (fig. 4) is not always con-
ducive to a happy ménage, betraying a
deficient sense of justice and an oppres-
sive self-esteem in its possessor. It
is by no idle chance that “Norman"
rhymes to “Mormon.” As the poet sings:
Small heads are worse with coronets
And Norman skulls have Mormon blood–
surely a terrible indictment of the
House of Lords!
As a suitor the square-
headed man (fig. 1) is best
kept at arm's-length. Al-
though his powerful Osseous
physique indicates health and
longevity, evidences of geni-
ality, fondness for animals and
the capacity to amass a hand-
some income are lamentably
lacking. It is impossible, for
instance, to think of Mr. HALL
CAINE with a quadrangular
head, admirable though he
may be both as man and dra-
matist in all other directions.
The teaching of history,
again, renders it impossible
for the aspirant of matri-
monial honours to take a
roseate view of the pear-
shaped head (fig. 7). As Mr.
John MoRLEY has remarked in
one of those rare flashes of
facetiousness which enliven
his otherwise neutral-tinted
prose, the woman who marries
a man with a pear-shaped
head is sure to be unapplely
mated.
Louis Philippe, it may be
remembered, was the most
perfect specimen of the hu-
manized pear, and he was
pushed from his throne.
DUMAs père rarely paid his
bills.
By a natural transition we are led to
consider the claims of the circular head
(fig. 2). Negatively, the absence of all
angles and irregularities ensures immu-
nity from all eccentricity and vice. But
this blamelessness can be purchased only
at a loss of all individuality. None but a
young lady with a double dose of origin-
ality can afford to contract a matrimonial
alliance with a man with a head like a
billiard ball. It was the untempered
virtue of the Roundheads (who were
also square-toes) that led to the extrava-
gances and excesses of the Restoration.
There are occasions of course when even
a square head can go round, but we are
not referring to those.
There remain two further sharply.

contrasted types of cranial development.
In the first a complete absence of chin
is coupled with an adventurous nose
and a receding forehead (fig. 6). In the
second a bulbous and overhanging brow
is balanced by a protruding lower lip and
chin (fig. 5). Well-educated, modest and
sensitive young ladies are equally to be
warned against each of these types. The
former is incapable of wearing a tall
hat at a dignified angle unless provided
with a Chirgwin attachment for tilting
it forward; the latter is obviously un-
suitable for home life. Better even than

And comes again the quicker.

And thinks about the Lobby.

THE HOLIDAY KIDS.
(Invited by Helen and Cecil.)
II.
[CEcil says we ought to put a thing on the
top of this chapter like Nurse has on the top
of her Boudoir Story. It comes every Saturday,
and she keeps it under the stockings, in the
mending basket. We call it that, because
when Cecil and me fished it out one day we
counted Boudoir nineteen times in one chapter.
CEcil read one right through, and he says that
everything happens either in a Boudoir or
under Ancestral Trees.
Anyhow last week our chapter was about
this. Lady Montfort had got Mother to get
up a Bazaar for the Children's Country Holiday
Fund, and CEcil, and me persuaded her to let us
have two boy-kids of our own to go on with, and
one of them (BRAssy) was mad because we hadn't
asked his Polly as well, so of course we had to
dash off to Mother to explain. This is in case
you didn't remember.]
“MUST you come in, children?” asked
Mother, as we all plunged in upon her.
“We must, mother ' " I said. “It's
about Polly. BRAssy wants her so
awfully.”
Then it was that Lady MoxTFoRT
sprang out from behind a mountain of
bazaar things. She's a scenty person,
and very pincushiony. I die to prod
her with pins when she hugs me.
CECIL wants to dust her.
“Oh, you dears!” she cried. “So
you have brought in the beautiful raw
material.” -
“I beg your pardon, Lady Montfort,”
said CECIL; “we just wanted mother.”
But she only swung across the room,
pushed CECIL and me out of the way,
and grabbed at CLINKER and BRAssy.
“Boys do let me hear from your own
lips your true impressions of this de-
lightful holiday ! Is this the very first
time you have been out of Manchester?”
CECIL and me were terrified when we
saw BRAssy's eyes sparkling.
“Yes, lady, and you bet it will be the
last !” he said.
“Oh no, you poor modest child ! Of
course you will come another year!
See- this room is full of lovely things
made by kind gentlemen and ladies to
get money for you and your little
friends !”
Then she turned to Mother, and said:
“If one could only read the thrilling
experiences which lie buried in their
eyes!” But we all heard, and CECIL
writhed. -
Mother was just coming to the rescue,
when BRAssy burst out :
“When folk has bought all this lot,
what good will it do them ’’’
“What does that matter to us so long
as we get the money?” said Lady
MoxTFoRT.
“Then why can't they pass forward
the brass straight off, without having to
cart this lot home with them 2"
CECIL and me inwardly chortled. Poor
Dad had been saying for weeks to
Mother:
“Blank cheques are what you want
out of these people, KATHERINE, with free
leave for us to keep our own hearthstone
to ourselves.”
But Lady MoxTFORT was delighted.
“Oh, dear Mrs. LISTER." They are the
real thing! How clever of the little
fellow to say that | Such wisdom from
a Manchester slum. Perhaps they are
Socialists in embryo. I have so yearned
to see a real one. Of course one has
seen the Countess of * >
“This ain't nothing to do with Polly!”
said BRAssy, sullenly. “And who are
you staring at 2 I ain't a blooming
monkey on a pianna orgin ' "
“Isn't he quaint ' " said Lady MoWT-
Fort. But CECIL suddenly backed us all
out, and we made a dash for Dad, who,
we knew, was splashing about in the
barn at some bazaar scenery.
“Look here,” panted BRAssy, “I ain't
going to see no more ladies at no price'
My constitution won't stand it! Me and
CLINKER 'll be getting softening of the
brain, and we can't afford the luxury !”
“You should see the ladies as we
know !” said CLINKER. “They'd give
yours points, and talk 'em down easy!”
But we were at the barn, and there
was Dad in his shirt-sleeves, with a
great whitewash brush in his hand, and
pails of his colour washes about. He
was slap-dashing at a fearful rate-–blue
sky-clouds—a tower---trees.
“He does it while you wait, he does' "
said CLINKER. We could see they were
tremendously impressed.
Then Dad turned, stepped back, and
laughed.
“Hullo ' The Goths and Vandals
honour me! Admire my scene for the
Sleeping Beauty 2"
“Oh,” cried BRAssy, “Polly can act
that l”
“Why, who's Polly 2” Dad stopped
to light his pipe.
“That's why we've come!” I cried.
“BRASSY wants Polly. She's his best
friend, and she's a girl, and poorly,
and--"
“She's not too poorly to do the Sleep-
ing Beauty for you, sir! My-ain't
she got eyes, when she opens them at
the Prince' And when her hair's fresh
washed, it's as gold as gas! And she's
got white shoes and stockings of her
own, and she'd do it for you for
nothing !”
“He’s quite sick for her, you know,
Dad,” said CECIL.
“And she'd sing, if you want, sir–
for nothing. She's worth a shilling a
song any night. And if you've a job
about the place, sir, I'd as soon do it
as loaf around ; and here's the five
shillings for her fare ' "
BRASSY stuck his prize-money right into
Dad's hand, and Dad just shook it about
in his palm as if it burnt him.
“Been to Mother, children?” he asked
CECIL and me.
CECIL went close up, and whispered:
“No good. Lady MonTFoRD, you know.”
And Dad nodded.
“Stick to your money, my boy!” he
said presently. “Perhaps we can induce
the railway company to bring your best
friend without that.”
“She'd have danced too, sir, if she'd
not had bad luck.”
“Polly is evidently a capable young
person,” said Dad, and pulled down
another great sheet.
“Sir,” said CLINKER (he had grown
frightfully respectful), “could you do a
public-house 2"
Dad looked at him a minute, and then
said: “Right you are ' "
And while we watched he did a
street, and the loveliest public-house-
all glaring, and a real cab.
“Don’t it look homeish!” said CLINKER.
“He does it better nor the best pave-
ment artist I've ever clapped eyes on '"
said BRASSY.
And then Dad explained that this
was to be a street scene at the bazaar.
“With Polly fetching beer!” said
BRAssy. “And me and CLINKER could do
you a fight, Sir-real sporting, if you'd
like it !”
“But we must do something,” I said.
“It's not fair.”
“Oh, you could be the toffs walking
by,” said CLINKER, “and saying, "'Ow
hawful ' ' '
+ + + + +
Dad and Mother were angels, and
Polly came, and CECIL and me watched
the kids meet.
“Well, old gal, and how 's Man-
chester?” said CLINKER.
“Hook on sharp ' " said BRASSY.
“Our carriage is waiting outside."
*:: *:: *:: *:: *::
We got heaps of money at the Bazaar,
and Mother ran neck and neck with
Lady MoWTFoRT for the record. But she
won at the very last minute by selling
the original of the bazaar programme to
herself for a guinea.
We think the kids enjoyed the holiday,
but when we wanted them to stop on
BRAssy said he would like to have obliged,
but he couldn't afford to get behind the
times; and CLINKER said to CECIL:
“My respectful thanks to all concerned,
but dead off the country as soon as my
summer outing is over. I don't want to
turn into no Sleeping Beauty. I ain't
got the complexion nor the nose for it;
and besides, what would Manchester do?
So long, youngster, and good luck!"
But Mother won't let Polly go yet, sº
Dad has drawn a picture of her and
given it to BRAssy. HELEN.

I THINK I heard The wild GEESE
CRANKFORD.
The inhabitants of Crankford are as a
rule retired and leisurely people. Indeed,
a large amount of spare time is necessary
in this village, as each member of the
community takes a very active interest
in his fellows, and spends hours daily
in endeavouring to make them share the
benefits of his own special system. For
the distinguishing feature of Crankford
is that everybody has a system of some
kind to which he devotes the energy of
his life, and that is what makes the
whole village so industrious and so
cheerful.
Upon my first entrance into Crankford
my attention was attracted by enormous
placards posted at frequent intervals
upon the walls. These were invariably
of two kinds—one printed in large blue
letters, the other in red. The blue
sheets read as follows:–
Join the Society for the Total Abolition
of Nourishment in Any Form What-
800 ver”.
Rely for Sustenance upon Pure Air alone,
and thus demonstrate your Distance
from the Brute.
The message of the red sheets was
equally insistent:-
Join the League of the Continuous Re-
builders of the Human Frame, and
thus keep yourself in Stable Equi-
librium.
From these placards I gathered my
first information of the two rival societies
at Crankford, but I was soon to know
more. For I had not been long in the
village before the President of the first
Society, a little grey-eyed lady, emaciated
but enthusiastic, waited upon me full
of eloquent wisdom. She showed me
clearly how Man in his slow climb from
the Brute is gradually losing the cha-
racteristic mark of the Beast—the desire
to eat. Already he has ceased to eat his
fellows, soon he will lose the wish to eat at
all. “Soon,” she emphasised, for even
here progress must be slow, and members
of the Society are recommended to
accustom themselves gradually to the
treatment. Accordingly, as the Society is
still in its infancy, no member has as yet
reached the final stage. The increasing
prevalence of indigestion among human
beings, far from being an evil, is to be
interpreted as a sign of progress; such
pangs are the growing-pains of Man's
development, whereby he is learning
slowly and painfully, often reluctantly,
that he can neither be happy nor well
if he eats. Hunger, which at present
men deem inconvenient, and if pro-
longed even dangerous, is a habit
unnecessarily retained from the earlier
stages of man's history—a habit, more-
over, which soon will die when our
infants are no longer stout and solid,
from being fed on Somebody's Food, but
ethereal and lustrous-eyed, from being
fed on-Absolutely Nothing !
“Do you eat fruit,” I asked “an
apple, for instance?” and I pointed to a
fine pippin on a bough above my head.
“Certainly not,” she replied with
indignant emphasis, “any more than I
would eat a butterfly ' "
“And yet,” I murmured softly, ‘Nos
numerus sumus, et fruges consumere
nati.’”
“The words of a pagan poet,” she said
gently. “We have climbed the lad-
der of evolution for nineteen centuries
since HoRACE drank his wine and ate his
fruit. Ah,” she went on dreamily, "I
could re-write the Greek Myth of the
Apple. The apple should be a gift of
beauty offered to the Ideal i.i.
It is only when Man opens his impious
jaws and swallows it that it becomes
indeed an Apple of Discord.”
“If we abolish food,” I remarked,
“we should have considerably less work
to do, and considerably more time in
which to do it. How would man use
his increased leisure?”
“He would talk,” was the reply,
“and that is what his mouth was made
for. The eater cannot talk. After.
dinner speeches are a sufficient proof ºf
the absurdity of expecting the mouth
to perform a double function. If, a
man drank with his ears, would he

As she uttered the last words in a
low impassioned voice she left me and
ssed down to my garden gate. Scarcely
had she disappeared when there arrived
a stout choleric-looking individual, puff-
ing in his haste. He introduced himself
as the Secretary of the League of the
Continuous Rebuilders of the Human
Frame.
“I come, sir,” he panted impetuously,
“to counteract with my arguments the
pernicious nonsense to which you have
been listening. Evolution indeed I
should like to know what has kept pace
with the evolution of man more consist-
ently than the evolution of the kitchen.
It was at the epoch of Rome's greatest
glory, at the height of her civilisation,

ROUGH LUCK.
CALM was the scene, and luring to repose.
The scent of balms and hair-restoring spices
Were blandly recommended to the nose;
I heard the barber's garrulous advices
As from afar; and the soft-clashing shears,
Like chirping crickets, lulled my drowsy ears.
And, in a reverie, I passed again
To those far days when, at my grand-sire's place in
The golden Duchy, my redundant mane
Was hogged by JAY the coachman with a basin;
(And why a basin, why of all that's wild
A basin, has perplexed me from a child.)
'Twas there that they constrained my stubborn curls
With a dishonouring comb | When I objected,
They said it was a boy's comb, not a girl's '
They looked too plausible to be suspected ;
But still the memories of my Cornish home
Are soured with thoughts of that infernal comb.
Mine was in truth a wild and rugged mat,
And uncontrollable beyond all others;
My grown-up sisters mocked it; worse than that,
Vilely compared it to my younger brother's,
A little beast, whose head was always sleek,
And wanted soundly punching once a week.
Ah, how I suffered ' I can feel it still !
Young JAMES got all the praise—and I the merriment;
His was the head that called for every skill;
Mine was a field for humour and experiment'
I still remember how my smouldering flames
Burst forth—and how I took it out of JAMEs.
'Twas thus. They had me cropped—a prison crop !
They jeered. Then rose I up against their jeering.
Sternly next morning to the barber's shop
I haled the imp. I bore him from the shearing
Shaven, I tell you, shaven like a sheep !
I got a licking, too—and got it cheap.
+ *k + *k + *
Thus, with a sense of well-requited injury,
I passed through older days to times more recent;
To-day my head of hair is rich (tho' gingery);
JAMEs is so bald as hardly to be decent.
My locks are much admired at balls and crushes,
But JAMEs—when JAMES removes his hat—he blushes!

THE NOWEL NUISANCE.
[The scheme of legislation subjoined is suggested as a means of
regulating the enormous output of modern fiction, a problem wellnigh
as serious as those arising out of the growth of automobilism.]
1. No author or authoress shall be permitted to drive a
quill, steel, or fountain pen of more than 5-paragraph power
until she or he be duly licensed and certificated as competent
to do so without danger to the public.
2. Every authoress and º: shall be subjected to an
adjective tax.
3. All novels shall be registered (for purposes of identifi-
cation) with clearly-marked letters and numbers, indicating
the school or district to which they belong; and no writer
shall, to prevent classification, wilfully obscure his local
colouring or moral purpose. Thus, whilst KY 3496 might
represent the latest creation of the Kailyard romancists,
attacks upon Mayfair and the moneyed classes could be
labelled M.C. 666.
4. No writer shall compose novels at a faster rate than 350
h.-pp. per publishing year.
No speed competitions shall be allowed between
novelists, except in such areas as may be licensed and set
apart for the purpose, e.g., the Dartmoor country, the Avon
(Warks.) district, and the Sahara.
6. Special licenses shall be taken out for italics, autobio-
graphical prefaces, and replies to reviewers.
7. Writers of novels shall be responsible for all sudden
shocks, nervous break-downs, heart-failures, and (in the case
of feuilletons) deaths from suspense occasioned to their
readers, and may be prosecuted therefor.
8. Novels shall be bound and coloured according to their
contents. Thus, sensational fiction must be issued in red
boards, idylls of rural tranquillity in green or tree-calf, whilst
brown covers are reserved for essays of the ruminating type,
despatched from study-windows and the like.
9. The close season for novels shall extend from July 1 to
September 30 in each year, and no work of fiction shall be
published during this period, under a penalty (for every
offence) of six months hibernation under hatches on an
L.C.C. steamer.
A WALEDICTION.
[The Great Wheel at the Earl's Court Exhibition ceased running on
October 6 for good, and its demolition is being taken in hand this
week.]
“Eppur si muove move it does at last,
The Great Wheel turns, though truly not too fast.”
Thus, after two or three false starts, was hailed
Our Toy, till then by Cockney wit assailed,
When in the June of Eighteen-ninety-five,
The huge machine began to look alive.
Skittish it was at first, nor need we tell
The manifold adventures that befell
Staid City fathers and suburban swains,
Who lost their several latest homeward trains,
When captive in their airy cage of steel
They passed the night upon the unbudging wheel.
But soon it settled to its steady round,
Fair day or foul, and stoutly held its ground,
While Wembley's tower refused to sprout aright,
And FERRIs felled his wheel with dynamite.
Ours plodded on, and tried to make a splash
Baiting its cars with lure of hidden cash,
With fivers for benighted fares to earn,
When London's Tombola refused to turn.
We loved the queer contraption for its size,
E’en though it nightly scarified our eyes
With flaming signs some Patent Milk to boom
Or Priceless Candle, to dispel the gloom.
It was our landmark and our meeting-place,
Our freak of clumsiness, our type of grace,
Our butt and pride and by-word, and our bore,
Fated, we thought, to whirl for evermore.
Not so, for by the dawn of Sunday's sun
Its years of not too crowded life were done.
The cold-iron-chisel gang will forthwith swarm
With dour disrivetters o'er its hapless form—
The breaking-up a toughish job they'll find,
Picking its carcass in the Autumn wind |
Its cars will go for seaside bungalows
Or chicken-houses in abandoned rows.
Farewell, fair Wheelſ soon will your spokes be snapped,
And your ten hundred tons of iron scrapped.
Pray Heaven from out your rubbish heap next year
You may not, like a quick-change Phoenix, **).

THE DOGS OF WAR.
(By the Author of “A Dog Day.”)
XI. SMITH.
MENTION of my people reminds me of
Smith.
Smith was a blot on my reputation,
just as Shah was on the Captain's.
The Captain and I- though it never
leaked out—each had a cat friend.
I believe that such secret breaches of
dog etiquette are not altogether un-
common, though seldom confessed. In-
deed there are not wanting those and
I fancy that to Smith I was the Captain.
among them the Captain – who hold
that it shows a certain generosity of
temperament, a fine freedom from pre-
judice, to admit one cat, as an excep-
tion, to all the privileges of our friend-
ship. Still such views were never aired
in public, for they would only have been
misunderstood by the lesser minds.
The Captain suffered a handsome but
proud Persian to be his friend and con-
temporary in his home. I shall never
forget how thunderstruck I was when
by accident I first made the discovery.
I found the creature hiding under a
chair in the Captain's dining-room, and
was proceeding to rush her out when
the Captain, livid with rage, cried,
“How dare you?” I had never seen
him so angry, and I said, “I beg your
pardon, but I thought it was a cat.”
“So it is,” he answered, “and don't
you dare to touch her.”
“Hoity - toity' " said I, losing my
temper in turn. “Likewise, what-ho!”
and I made for the door. The Captain
barred my way, and his tone altered
slightly.
“Naturally what you have seen is con-
fidential,” he said. I agreed, for my
tantrums were always soon over. “And
if you dare to tell a soul,” he added,
“I’ll hound you out of the town.” He
need not have threatened me. Still, he
was the Captain, and in a minute I was
asking his pardon for having forgotten
myself. My word, but I was surprised
Soon afterwards Smith, who was just
an ordinary tabby-grey fur lined inside
with pink-stepped into my life.
She came to us as a tiny kitten, and
to please my mistress I befriended her.
The awful name Smith she received
from my master. My mistress begged
that it might, at any rate, be Smythe,
but my master was a bit of a tyrant.
He insisted on naming all the cats who
came to his house Smith, and the previous
ones had left on that account. There
was nothing funny about it; it was
merely silly and tyrannical.
As a kitten Smith was somewhat try-
ing. She would insist on my playing
with her whether I was in the mood or
not. She grew up, however, into a lady-
like, genteel young person, and some-
thing of an athlete. She was not so
aristocratic in appearance as Shah, but
nevertheless I was not ashamed of her.
It was a great thing to have had the
training of her from infancy, and I some-
times wondered whether the objection-
able qualities in other cats might not,
after all, be due to a large extent to their
up-bringing. It was wonderful how
fond I became of the little beggar, and
she, I felt, both loved and respected me.
I fancy, in fact, that to Smith I was the
Captain—and I rather liked the feeling.
I would often surprise her gazing admir-
ingly at me. I was to her, it was
evident, the embodiment of beauty and
physical strength. And I took pains
not to disillusionise her in regard to the
latter point. At the cost of some in-
convenience when she pricked me I often
pretended that I did not feel it. And
I told her that if I liked I could brain
her with one blow from my paw. And
I would tell her tales of combats with
other dogs which would make her hair
stand on end, so that the nervous little
thing would beg me to take more care
of myself. Sometimes I could not resist
the temptation, and I would stick it on
a bit, and tell her, for instance, how I
had had a fight with a couple of horses
and had easily overcome them, or that I
had chased half-a-dozen policemen for over
two miles. Smith was curiously simple-
minded, and it was the easiest thing in
the world to impose on her. I told her
that dogs really had claws, only they were |.
too good-natured to use them. One day,
again, she confessed to me that she had
an immense admiration for flies; she
thought it so clever of them to walk
upon the ceiling. At this I informed
her that it was really quite easy, and
that when I was younger I would think
nothing of running round the ceiling
two or three times before breakfast.
And she believed it, Lord forgive me !
It was wonderful the opinion Smith had
of me.
Now and then Smith would try a
little mild bragging. For example, one
morning she informed me that she too
was a Quadruped, and I almost died of
laughing. It seems that another cat
had told her so. Trust cats, when they
get together, to talk either nonsense or
scandal. Which reminds me that the
vile Tabby Ochre once declared to Smith
that the Captain was one of the most
cowardly dogs she had ever met. Smith
had the decency and the pluck to tell
her she was a liar. That, anyhow, was
the explanation Smith gave of a nasty
scar on her nose. By-the-by, some of
Smith's mouse tales took a lot of
believing.
A point about Smith for which I could
not help having a hearty admiration was
her agility. Smith used to say that
“everything that a cat can get belongs
to her,” and, if she were hungry, she
would with the greatest ease jump on to
a shelf and help herself—while, if I
were to have attempted such a feat, I
know the dish would have come down
with a clatter.
Naturally enough Smith and I in-
fluenced each other's habits and customs
to some extent. I taught Smith how to
lie down in a dignified manner, with
her paws straight out in front, and she
taught me how to curl up comfortably.
It used to amuse me to see how Smith
aped me in a hundred-and-one ways.
She even took to scratching herself.
And she would eat plain bread like I
did, because she thought it manly.
And I taught her to wag her tail when
she was pleased, like a civilised person,
instead of when she was angry. This
was great fun, as humans would be doing
what she liked, and then they would
suddenly stop, as they thought she
disliked it.
By the way, the Captain once told me
that the disagreement between dogs and
cats owed its origin to tail-wagging. At
the beginning of things, when animals
had just been invented, the dogs de-
clared that it was the correct thing to
“Would you ruin me?” I hissed.
wag your tail when you were pleased,
while the cats took the opposite view,
and they have been fighting about it
ever since.
The one thing that I feared in regard
to Smith was that she would try to
accompany me out-of-doors. I did all
I could to frighten her off the idea by
drawing a highly-coloured picture of

the dangers of the streets. I ran motor-
cars for all they were worth. I told her
how the machinery of the cars, to their
owners' great annoyance, was constantly
getting clogged up with cats. I also
told her how the motorists wore coats
lined with cat-skins, and how many
cats, especially tabbies, were kidnapped
for the sake of their valuable clothes,
stripped, and left naked by the roadside.
In spite of this, one fine morning, judge
of my alarm, on looking round, to find
Smith following me! My rage knew no
bounds. “Would you ruin me?” I
hissed. Smith, I fancy, had never seen
me so angry before. She crouched
down, as though fearing I would hit
her, and then slunk back, a picture of
misery. It was, of
LITERARY NOTES.
WE understand that the authoress of
that biting story The Viper of Milan
has a series of ophidian romances on
hand, some of the titles of which we
have been privileged to divulge. They
are The Cobra of Constantinople, The
Blindworm of Buenos Ayres, The Adder
of Aden, The Rattlesnake of Rye (dedi-
cated to Mr. HENRY JAMEs), The Boa Con-
strictor of Balham, The Python of Peck-
ham Rye and The Slow-worm of Assisi.
The title of Mrs. Coulson KERNAHAN's
new novel The Dumpling is bound to
exert a potent influence on fictional
nomenclature. Already we hear of The
AN AFTERMATH OF OPERA.
The autumn season opened at Covent
Garden last Friday with Rigoletto, of all
depressing themes. I must think it
was chosen for its popular tunes, for
there was a half-provincial air about
the house. The prices were too low to
attract the noblest tastes. The absence
of familiar diamonds made one shy of
believing that the music could really be
first-rate. Mme. MELBA, however, did
what she could to correct this impression,
not only by her glorious singing, but
also by her own bejewelled fingers,
which lent a distinctive lustre to her part
as the simple child of a chartered buffoon.
Most of the Pit Tier boxes had had their
course, a flagrant
act of disobedience,
and I am glad to
say it was never
repeated. It was
the last time I had
occasion to make
any complaint to
her. Taking her
all in all, she was a
very good little
thing; and, my
word, how the little
baggage adored me!
The Captain's
attitude to Smith
was somewhat pecu-
liar. The first time
they met, Smith ran
up to the Captain;
and anyone who did
not know the Cap-
tain would have
said he was afraid,
for he moved off
very quickly. After
that, Smith would
frequently attempt
to play with the
Captain as she
often did with
me — she would try all her arts of
coquetry, for she was a bit of a flirt, was
Smith—but the Captain would always
ignore her. Officially, it was evident
the Captain had resolved to deny her
existence. Smith sometimes complained
of this to me, but, as I told her, it was
not for the likes of her to expect one of
the Captain's rank and position to take
notice of a little ordinary tabby cat
named Smith.
The Burton Advertiser, describing a
haystack fire, states that “the cause of
the outbreak was supposed to be com-
bustion.” A bold guess'

Talking the other day with a West-
End bookseller, I gathered that the best
selling books were Mr. HICHENs's The
Fall in the Mud, and Mr. MAxwell's The
Larded Game.
My interlocutor surprised and fascin-
ated me by adding the curious item of
information that no new novels are
ever issued in buckram. propos of
bindings, my friend told me that his
forty years' experience of London book-
buyers convinced him that if Mr. BENT's
new Every Woman's Library were to
come out at a penny a volume, bound
in Russia leather, it could not fail to
command a considerable sale,
partitions knocked

to this part of the
auditorium an at-

priety, as if it were

seemed to think
they were in a

MELBA obliged them
so far as to leave
her bedroom on the
first floor, come
down by way of the
terrace and make
her bow from the
garden. Then she
retired on the
ground floor; with
the consequence that
when the revellers
came to carry Gilda
off they had to becon-
tent with a dummy.
She was in great
and bird-like voice.
Signor SAMMARCO, as Rigoletto, sang
and acted nobly. I cannot say as much
for the Duca of Signor KRISMER.
When he sang pianissimo he was
pleasant enough ; |. the moment he
let his voice go it seemed to come
through an inferior gramophone, so
metallic was its tone. He was not
a bit like his property portrait on the
wall (these Rigoletto Dukes never are).
His legs were much fatter, and he had no
beard.
Signor WALTER, as the cut-throat Spar-
afucile, was a right Italian stage i.
and the Monterome of Signor THOS was
visibly an injured man.
Vocally the chorus was well trained ;
but they had learned their lessons me-
chanically, and acted rathor like stuffed
marionettes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
At the opening of her new book, Prisoners (HUTCHINSON),
MARY CHOLMONDELEY gives one the impression of having her
literary muscles rather stiff from disuse, or else rheumatics.
Her style is laboured; it lacks freshness and ease. Here is a
bad passage: “The duke approached, superb, decorated,
dignified, with the polished pallor as if the skin were a little
too tight, which is the Charybdis of many who have avoided
the Scylla of wrinkles.” That is really unworthy of her.
But as soon as she reaches, quite early, one of those dramatic
situations in which she so excels, she warms to her work.
She writes best, indeed, when she has most to say, or when
the mood of humour—her special gift—is upon her.
Miss Chol\to\DELEY is a close student of character. In
dealing with her central figure, Fay, she allows no prejudice
in favour of her own sex to temper the almost surgical
sincerity with which she probes to the place where the poor
hansom drivers ultimately repair, positively announces that
“bad ones are condemned to the box seat of four-wheelers.”
This by the way. The supplement to his charming narrative of
A Wanderer in Holland is in keeping with its happy title. He
just wanders about London, and out of full knowledge, keen
sympathy with its light and shade, its colour and its
teeming life, he chatters. Lamenting the tidal wave of
utilitarianism that lately rolled over London City, extend-
ing westward to Charing Cross, he disclaims discovery of
profusion of curious or picturesque corners. What the
traveller must journey to London to behold and study is,
he insists, her men and women, her millions of men and
women. Despite this disclaimer he leaves unnoted few of
the precious bits of antiquity still left to the strenuous
beehive. When found he makes a note of them with loving
hand. He is particularly strong on pictures, devoting
discriminating chapters to the Tate Gallery, Kensington
Museum, and the Wallace Collection, and two to ther National
Gallery. This section forms of itself an excellent handbook.
One cannot be expected to acquiesce in all his judgments.
creature's heart ought to be.
Yet her analysis leaves us
sceptical. “It is difficult,” she
somewhere says, “for those
who have imagination tounder-
stand the insouciance, which
looks so like heartlessness, of
the unimaginative.” That is
a wise saying; but want of
imagination, though it may
lead to very painful results—
such as the suicide of Endu-
mion's father- cannot by itse

It is conceivable that a % º
woman without courage or º
sense of honour might, in order
to cover a situation which
threatened to compromise her
good name, allow her lover to
assume the guilt of a crime in
which neither he nor she was
concerned. It is conceivable,

why I'm goixg To cANE You, Don't You?”
Sloggs (son of the middleweight champion). “YES, SIR.
You'RE A heavy-weight AND I'M oxly A BANTAM."
But in such matters it is not
unpleasant to argue with a man
of strong opinions, especially
when he, having said his say,
must perforce leave you the
last word. There is a delight-
ful chapter on music-halls, and,
by way of balance, many pages
about old churches. I can
imagine no more delightful
companion for a walk down
Fleet Streetor any otherstoried
London thoroughfare than this
cheery, cultured Wanderer.
The large picture-book en-
titled The Education of an
Artist (A. & C. BLAck), the
pages of which I have turned
with so much pleasure, coming
again and again on reproduc-
tions of famous works, should
really have been called The
E.cultation of a Tourist. For,

It's BECA either existed or learned to

is barely conceivable, if she had the merest caricature of a
heart, or indeed was human at all, that, after her husband's
death, she should still let her lover go on wearing out
his life in penal servitude for want of a word from her.
Brutality of this order can hardly be explained by a mere
defect of imagination. But, even so, one can understand
how such a woman might be regenerated if she met a man
with enough heart's blood in him to spare some of it for the
furnishing of her empty veins. But the man whom our
author provides for this purpose is a preposterous and unlov-
able prig, on whose pedantic egoism she is at the greatest
pains to insist. It is indeed a tribute to Miss CHOLMoxdELEY's
charm that she can afford to impose such improbabilities upon
us. So shining are her virtues as a teller of tales that we
must needs overlook apparent errors of judgment which in a
less brilliant writer would have been a damnable offence.
We have long known, on the authority of The Autocrat of
the Breakfast Table, that good Americans, when they die, go
to Paris. As A Wanderer in London (METHUEN), Mr. E. V.
LUCAs, whilst admitting he does not know whither good
paint, everyone will be certain
that Mr. C. LEwis HIND, the author, had a very good time
as he moved from one European gallery to another gathering
impressions, while his portmanteau was acquiring its com;
lement of hotel labels. His ingenuity in forcing the Old
W. to illustrate the story of a modern soul-hunter cannot
be too much admired; but what living artists will say of it
is another matter.
Two things about Mr. SIDNEY LEE's extended monograph
on Stratford-on-Aron (SEELEY & Co.) perplex me intensely:
there is no mention of Stratford-on-Avon's best-known resident
in it, and the date on the title-page is 1907. I write these
words in October, 1906, when this best of years has still nearly
three good months to run, and it strikes me as an injustice
to its sunshine and other merits to look ahead with this
indecent impatience. Why should not Mr. LEE's interesting
book belong to it as well as HUTCHINGs's boundaries and
Hist's record and the marriage of Princess ENA and Presi.

CHARIVARIA.
THE War Office has just placed an
order for 40,000 chairs. It has realised,
we suppose, that our Army, in view of
its reduced numbers, must take all
future attacks sitting down.
The County Council having decided
that there shall be no “Paris in London,”
the City Corporation has been producing
“London in Paris.”
Meanwhile satisfaction continues to
be expressed by our French friends
that the LoRD MAYOR's Coachman should
have been persuaded to include the LORD
MAYOR in his retinue.
H.M.S. Dreadnought having proved
herselfanadmirable -
sea boat, vibration
and rolling being
almost impercep-
tible, a lady corre-
spondent wants to
know why the South
Eastern do not at
once secure her for
their cross-Channel
Customers.
During the Recess
a room in the House
of Commons, which
was previously
looked upon as the
property of the
House of Lords, has
been turned into a
smoking-room. Is
this, we wonder, the
beginning of the
end, and will the
Houseof Lords itself
ultimately be con-
verted into a restau-
rant for the use of
the Members of the other House?
“Are British women's feet growing
larger?” asks The Daily Mail. “Impos-
sible,” answers an ungallant Continental
journal. -
A Frenchman who had been wrong-
fully convicted of stealing some bank-
notes has been granted a free pardon
for the mistake made by his accuser.
The internal decorations of the new
Old Bailey are said to be most interest-
ing, even though the offer of a wealthy
retired house-breaker to present a series
of medallion portraits of Great Burglars
had to be refused.
Exhibitions are undoubtedly a power-
ful factor for civilization. During the
six months for which the recent Earl's
WOL. Cxxxi,
Court Exhibition was open upwards of
400,000 persons paid twopence apiece
for the experience of sliding in a sitting
position on a mat from the top to the
bottom of an erection shaped like a light-
house.
An expert having stated that, in his
opinion, no man can be a really competent
driver of a motor vehicle until he has
had twelve months' experience of the
roads, an Irish M.P. is to ask the Govern-
ment to make it illegal for a chauffeur to
drive until he has had that experience.
Is the horse, after all, so inferior to the
motor? One day last week a runaway
horse wrecked the fronts of four shops
in Middlesex Street.

Dogs all over the world are much
interested in the case of ANTONIO CoNGRO,
of New York. He lived for twenty-one

Mr. Wii FRID SCAwFN BLUNT has pub-
lished a volume on the subject of British
rule in Egypt. “I do not ask,” says
Mr. BLUNT, “that Lord CROMER should
be condemned or dismissed or recalled
from Egypt without a full hearing.”
This seems humane.
The world's natural wood supply will,
it is authoritatively stated, ultimately
give out, and owners of heads made of
that material are already giving them-
selves airs in view of their prospective
increase in value.
“The Isle of wight County Educa-
decided that in future the marriage
of a woman teacher shall be considered
equivalent to the notice necessary to
terminate her engagement.” But surely
marriage has always been one of the
best known ways of terminating an
engagement; this at least has been our
own experience.
Some gentlemen who intended to pre-
sent a Memorial to the President of the
late Duma have abandoned their project,
thus avoiding the prospect of a Memorial

POINTS FOR
LADY CUEISTS.
1. GET a good
grip of the cue with
both hands.
2. One of the
white balls has a
black spot. This is
intended as a guide
for ladies. Try and
hit this spot every
time. Shift the ball ||
if necessary.
3. Incline the
head slightly in
order to put “side’”
on. A backward
movement is neces-
sary for “check.”
4. The method of
“screwing” a ball is similar to that of
putting in a hat-pin – a short, sharp,
vicious jab.
5. Should you mis-cue many times, try
the other end. A little more chalk may
be necessary.
6. Should you tear the cloth, don't
worry; the maid will come up with the
sewing-machine.
7. A game of “fifty up" should not
take more than two hours, even allowing
for the distractions of a mixed “two-
some.”
“The Petit Parisien says that the Chief
Magistrate of the City will be cordially re-
ceived. He will bring something of England's
heart in the folds of his robes, and will take a
great deal of France's back to the other side of
the Channel.”—Daily Telegraph.
FRANCE will of course retain the small
of her back.

THE G00KS AND THE GAIETY BROTH.
SCENE–A room at the Gaiety Theatre.
The time is some weeks prior to the
production of “The New Aladdin.”
The authors of that piece are gathered
in a dense crowd at one end of the
room. They are all talking at the
same time, and the moise is deafen-
ing. Enter Mr. GEORGE EDWARDEs,
smiling paternally. His smile
changes to a look of consternation as
he surreys the eccited mob before
him. The authors rush towards
him in a body, talking and gesticu-
lating.
Mr. Edwardes (deprecatingly). Gentle-
men Gentlemen (Confused shouting
from the multitude.) Gentlemen, this is
too much. You are not the Angry Mob
in one of Mr. BEERBOHM TREE's produc-
tions. You are gifted men of letters.
Kindly behave as such.

sererity). Well, but—-

Mr. Risque. It's your fault. You're
so unreasonable.
Mr. Greenbank. You're just as bad.
Mr. Grossmith. I –
Mr. Edwardes. Stop! Stop! Stop!
(The noise dies away gradually to a
sullen murmur). Now, TANNER 2
Mr. Tanner. It's like this. My idea
is that we want something absolutely
new— something perfectly fresh.
Mr. Risque. And then you go on to
suggest EDMUND PAYNE as a page-boy!
Mr. Grossmith. Why drag in PAYNE 2
I—
Mr. Tanner. My idea is -something
Gilbertian.
Mr. Risque. Well, you've got it,
haven't you? Your stout firy who
nestles in a buttercup is copied from
Iolanthe; your genie who has to talk in
rhyme comes from The Fairy's Dilemma;
your chorus of policemen from The
Pirates of Penzance; and your police-
man lost in London from Peter Forth in
The Bab Ballads. One would think that
that was enough Gilbert for one piece.
Mr. Grossmith. Now I––
Mr. Tanner. What I say is, why not
have a plot in the Second Act as well as

Mr. Edwardes (more in sorrow than in
anger). I never thought to hear those
words from JAMES TANNER!
[Mr. TANNER blushes, and hangs his
head.
Mr. Edwardes (breaking an awkward
silence). Well? Has anybody else any
suggestion to make?
Mr. Grossmith. I've a motion, GEORGE,
that you make a mistake in overcrowding
your stage. Of course it gives a certain
air of liveliness to a scene to have a lot
of people about, but the audience soon
gets tired of it. What you want is to
drop all that, and strike out a new line
altogether. Now, how about turning
the Second Act into a humorous mono-
logue 2 I shouldn't mind doing it. I
must get off and change my clothes

orchestra could play 'em a tune or two

you ?

Mr. Edwardes (with frigid politeness).
At any other time, my dear fellow, I
should be more than glad to listen to
your doubtless sound views on that
obsolete form of entertainment; but time
presses, and we have not yet settled the
details of our new-(with icy emphasis)

|Mr. ADRIAN Ross starts and colours
uncomfortably.
Mr. Greenbank. I say—lyrics. That's
what you want-good lyrics. And (com-
placently) we've got those all right.
Mr. Grossmith (effusively). Thank you,
PERCY, thank you !
Mr. Tanner (who has been slowly re-
corering during the preceding remarks).
I have a bright idea. Why not try
writing the part of a comic foreigner for
Robbitt NAINBY 2
Mr. Edwardes. Excellent. Do it.
Mr. Grossmith (doubtfully). Must he
have a part? It crowds up the stage,

Mr. Tanner. We must have a comic
foreigner, you know. It's the Gaiety.
Mr. Grossmith. Then how about me
doubling the part with my own 2 I

Mr. Risque. Something in the SHAw
style would be my notion of extravaganza.
Leave it to me, and I'll turn you out

Mr. Tammer. GILBERT would be my
model, as I have said. You'd much
better leave the whole thing to me.
Mr. Grossmith. Tell you what. Don't

Simply let me come on and gag. How
would that do 2.
Mr. Adrian Ross. Why not turn the
thing into a concert? Nobody really
wants to hear dialogue. What they
want is to get on to the songs. I'll
write you a dozen lyrics, and you can
dole them out among the company.
Then TANNER and Risque could take a
holiday. I'm sure they want it. They're
looking quite flushed.

Mr. Greenbank. Risqu E, Mr. EDWARDEs

Mr. Edwardes. Please listen to me. I
see now that I was wrong to let you

over. It was a mistake. The only
wonder to me is that you are all still
alive. What you must do now is tº

of a “cream-faced loon.” Personally, I
have never come across that variety, but
to confirm my view I have recently
written to the Director of the Natural

back, “None in Museum, try looking-

what he means by the last three words?

BACON's CLAIM WINDICATED.
DEAR SIR,--I note that you comment
on the suspicious brevity of Macbeth.
It has, you observe, only 2108 lines as
against 3931 of Hamlet. No wonder
you use the epithet “suspicious.” If
you take 1=a and b-2, the first two
numbers in the total at once afford a
convincing clue to the authorship of

London's Importance and Population.

DoNEs, father of the Misses DARE. Its
staple industry is Bridge.
CHAPTER II.
Park Lane.
We cannot do better than come quickly
to riches. What so interesting as wealth 2
What so potent?
The richest people in London live in
Park Lane, which sometimes is called
Pork Lane for obvious reasons. I.et us
traverse this piquant thoroughfare from
north to south, and see
who lives here. Begin-
ning at the Marble Arch
but first an interest-

Marble Arch. It may
not be generally known
that the Marble Arch

ment which has long
been used as the head-

hurch in London. Ser-
vices are held at day-
break on the 15th. of
every month, and are
much appreciated. Re-
suming our walk down
Park Lane, we come first,
on the left (there are few
or no houses on the Park
side), to the magnificent
home of Sir ALGERNoN
CATESRY. Let us wait till
the door opens to admit of the many
gilded callers, and then note the cork
linotype machine in the hall.
• In the adjoining residence, in the
vicoco style of architecture, dwells Dr.
ORLANDO TIBBLES, LL.D. and D.Litt., who
has for neighbour, in the little bijou
residence, so minute as scarcely to afford
breathing space to his dozen flunkeys,
but furnished to perfection, Lord ENo.

of his lordship's salt and sipped his

informs us. Could we peep in, what
splendours we should perceive! The

make the house worth a visit.

“Windsor View,” the charmingly or-
nate building in terra-cotta to which
we now come, is one of Sir GILBERT
PARKER's mighty seats; but he prefers
to reside nearer his senatorial duties, in
Carlton House Terrace.
The fine isolated sombre mansion
adjoining it is Dorchester House, famous
as the birthplace and home of Mr.
Thom As HARDY, the novelist; but he
has for the time being let it to the
American Embassy. It was here, in
the room over the portico, that NELSON
uttered his famous entreaty, “Kiss me,
HARDY"—although there are critics who
maintain that to have said, “Kiss me,
MEREDITH,” would have indicated a
sounder literary taste. Here, however,
we touch dangerous ground, which we
would always avoid.

flittings from Greeba Castle. Not all
our great intellects, however, live in

example, has a chic residence on the
Tube just outside the radium.
Continuing our walk, we find, at the
corner of Bath Street, “Oliver Lodge,”
now the headquarters of the Society for
Psychical Research. Note the handsome
biscuit-ware faience. Here, however, we
must call a halt. Next week, Dear
Reader, we will resume our ramble

the offices of the New York “Flat-iron" and

THE bards have urged (in songs of flame)
That love is deemed of low account,

And who can doubt the charge was true

At home amid the sordid hum,
Where buses hoot and engines squeal,
But nobler transports never come?
Long since for more sublime retreats
She left behind our first-floor suites.

HENRY'S IDEA
OF THE BOOK WAR.
“ANY news from the front?” said
HENRY, as he filled a pipe.
“Nothing very much,” I said. “The
publishers have withdrawn their adver-
tisements in good order, and the Book
Club is pushing forward LOCKHART's
Life of Scott on the left wing.”
“Ah, yes, I rather expected that.”
“Which side are you backing?” I
asked.
“Well, really, I don't know,” said
HENRY. “Perhaps on the whole, though
I expect you'll call me a Pro-Boer, the
Book Club. Of course I don't know
anything about the rights and wrongs
of it all, except that each side is thinking
entirely of my comfort and convenience.
No, why I back The Times is because
of Mr. Hooper.
“Of course I've never seen Mr.
HoopFR—I don't believe anybody ever

MASTERs, who is a cynic, says there isn't
really a Mr. Hooper at all, and that he's
just an abstraction, like the Man in the
Iron Mask, and so on. Of course there's
a good deal to be said for that, but I
think the true explanation is that Mr.
HoopFR was The Man in the Iron Mask.
I mean that would explain so many
things—the Popish Plot, and KEIR-
HARDIE, and the Letters of Junius. I
think, anyhow, there can be no doubt
that Mr. HoopFR wrote the Letters of
Junius. One only needs to compare
the two styles.
“Of course this isn't saying that there
is no Mr. Hooper just at present. I say
there is, and MASTERs says there isn't ; but
then MASTERs is a cynic. MASTERs doesn't
even believe in Mr. ARTHUR FitriNGs, of
Victoria Street. He's the man who puts
himself up as ‘Art Fittings' on his
shop, just as you see ‘Jos. BrowN & Co.'
MASTERs says I'm an ass, and there's
no Mr. FITTINGs; but I say there is, and
a Mr. Hooper too.
“MASTERs hasn't at all the true con-
ception of Mr. Hooper. He actually talks
about him as HoopFR Well now, that
shows the totally wrong spirit in which

But now no more our walks abroad are greeted
With some deliciously familiar strain;
No whistled melody (ad lib. repeated)
Allures the weary brain.
Awake, some lyric bard, and break this silence.
“MILTON, thou shouldst be living at this hour !”
The street-boy's cry, that once was heard a mile hence,
Hath not its ancient power.
And though, maybe, someone, somewhere, is hatching
A phrase to sweep the pantomimic boards,
Just now no epidemic that is catching
Dilates our vocal cords.
NATURE STUDIES.
AN OLD FACTOTUM.
IIIs name was the essentially British one of MARTIN
THOMPSON, and his exiguous size was well suited to the
bustling activities in which his life was spent. He had been
in his time a waiter, a bookseller's assistant, a conſidential
agent to a wealthy American, a butler, a body-servant, a
librarian in a small way, and a gentleman of some leisure
and many occupations; but his mother wit and his native
ability, which remained unspoiled by any merely formal
education, had always, in the estimation of those who knew
him best, raised him superior to the position he happened
for the moment to occupy. Yet no man could have fulfilled
the duties of that position with a more exemplary zeal or
with a more complete satisfaction to those on whose behalf
he laboured. He has been dead more than twelve years,
but the memory of him is still fresh with me and must ever
remain undimmed in my grateful mind.
He was born in Yarmouth, and in the well-bloatered
atmosphere of that town he spent his early years. There
he entered the service of a publican whose merciful habit it
was to dilute with some less potent liquid the fiery waters
that he retailed to his customers. There was a mysterious
and tragical story how on one occasion a public official had
called at the house to test the contents of the barrels. In
vain had the publican attempted to devise some plan which
would permit him to assume an innocent ignorance in the
face of the imminent discovery of a watery admixture in the
rum. Conviction stared him in the eyes, but Providence
interposed to save a guilty man. The official duly arrived
in the morning, but postponed his terrifying inspection
until the afternoon. He strolled out to take the air, and fate
drew him to a bridge under which on that very morning a
mountebank was to pass in a vessel drawn, I think, by geese.
The mountebank arrived, the crowd trampled eagerly from
side to side of the bridge, and the bridge collapsed into the
water, bearing with it, amongst others, the unfortunate
official. “He’ll have had enough of water, poor man,” said
the publican when the day had passed and the inspector
had failed to reappear. I cannot forget the dramatic power
with which MARTIN, as he told this grim story, described, first,
the despair of his employer, and, finally, his infamous relief
and satisfaction.
From Yarmouth MARTIN came to London in the year of the
first Great Exhibition. And now began that Odyssey of varied
employments which left him without an equal for experience
and versatility. When I first knew him he was a butler, but
no ordinary butler was ever like him. He could do odd jobs
of carpentering; he could find lost keys or papers with an
unerring instinct; he could drive a pony-cart; he could
supervise building operations; and, above all, he could
purchase books cheaply at a time long anterior to the founda-
tion of The Times Book Club. Almost any other thing that
required skill and neatness he could carry out in a house, for
he was of those who did not disdain to do that which lay
outside the customary scope of their work. His small stature
might have made him an object of ridicule to a gardener or a
coachman, but he owned a tongue that was more powerful
than inches, and could compel the respect of the most stalwart.
Yet he was human, for he allowed the sons of the house to
borrow money from him, and, since he never pressed for
repayment, he never failed to secure it. I once owed him £5
and sold a microscope to obtain the money.
When, later, he became a body-servant (the word “valet"
would describe him with insufficient distinction) he often
travelled abroad with his master, and though he knew no
foreign languages he generally succeeded at last in under-
standing and making himself understood. The French he
liked ; the Germans he respected, but without liking them.
Nor could he be cured of the notion that French, of which he
had picked up a few scraps, was a universal language equally
adapted to the intelligence of a German chambermaid and an
Italian vetlurino. I once overheard him explaining to a
German man-servant that he and his master were leaving the
German town, in which they happened to be staying, on the
following morning :--
“We’re goin' to-morrow, departer demain, me and my
master.”
“So 2" replied HENRICH, who had not the vaguest idea of
what was meant.
“Yes, we're off by the train--chemin de fer.”
“Jawohl” —again quite uncomprehendingly.
“Chemin de fer, you dunce, chemin de fer du Nord ' "
That was meant to be conclusive, for MARTIN evidently
thought it was the generic name of all European railways.
From these foreign travels he declared he had collected a
number of terrific oaths. They certainly sounded large, but
they were due rather to his own ingenuity than to the
anathematising genius of any continental nation. “Sakard-
billiapolakadonia,” as I remember, was one of them. In later
life he was also accustomed to clinch a statement of doubtful
veracity with the cryptic words “ qu'est-ce que c'est m'a donné
pour la chose,” pronounced in an impressive tone that carried
conviction with it.
During his service as a butler he had been privileged tº
wait on some of the truly great. CHARLEs Dickess had
exchanged many cheerful words with him ; he knew the
dishes that chiefly appealed to the palate of WILRIE Colliss;

For many years, in one capacity or another, he served one

that master's wife within its range. His own private family
he treated with condescension, and he never allowed their
claims to interfere with his devotion to those of whose house-

death of his master was a crushing blow to him, and he

OUR MILITARY CRITIC SPEAKS.
[A correspondent recently complained to a contemporary that “the
Actor in touring companies is badly trained in military matters,” and
is not convincing when he is playing the part of a soldier.]
OH, we take him from the wilds of Maiden Lane;
Twelve bob a week we give him for a wage;
We try to teach him not to look insane
When making his appearance on the stage.
He doesn't often have a lot to do
(Just enter r. and exit l.u.e.),
But—the fact there's no concealing,
You-well, somehow can't help feeling
That he isn't all a soldier ought to be.
0-oh, histrion ToMMY ATKINs,
I've no doubt you do your best ;
But there are a few improvements
You'll allow me to suggest.
Don't salute when you're bare-headed :
It is not the usual plan,
Scarcely, so to speak, the hall-mark
Of a military man.
His regiment's the “Loamshires” or “The Blanks,”
And the discipline's not rigid there, I fear;
For nobody says, “Silence in the Ranks!”
When he greets the hero's speeches with a cheer.
Real soldiers when on sentry-go, I'm told,
Are very seldom heard to air their wit;
But if he says nothing funny,
Then it’s “Give us back our money !”
From the patron of the drama in the pit.
0-oh, histrion ToMMY ATKINs,
That is where you come to grief;
Little Girl (to irritable old gentleman, who thought he had found a quiet spot to read his paper). “If You PLEASE we want to PLAY
At RouxDERs. AND will. YoU BE “Home'?”
Real soldiers hardly ever
Deal in “humorous relief.”
Though I've heard the gallery giggle
When your funniments began,
Yet, believe me, humour's foreign
To the military man.
He's in the mess-room scene in Act the First
When the villain tells the hero that he knows 1
When the latter bids the reptile do his worst
He separates them ere they come to blows.
In the big court-martial scene in Act the Third
He hangs about (left centre) and salutes,
But one feels constrained to mention
That, when standing to attention,
A warrior rarely gazes at his boots.
O-oh, histrion ToMMY ATKINS,
You'd be splendid, I've no doubt,
As a pantomime gazeka
Or a “sudden noise without ; ”
But you're rather like a waxwork
Or a doll that's stuffed with bran;
And this makes you unconvincing
As a military man.

MUSICAL TRAGEDY.
Friday, October 12.-Covent Garden
is not to be mistaken for the Home of
Musical Comedy. To-night is a possible
exception, as there is a Fancy Dress Ball,
but otherwise there has been a con-
tinuous stream of tragedies--Rigoletto (2),
Madama Butterfly (2), Carmen and La
Bohème—and the outlook, with La Tosca
| and Faust in the immediate future, is
no better. For three consecutive nights
Signor ZENATELLO has assisted, as i. g
| gentleman, at the death of a different
| lady friend. The effort to distinguish
| nicely between his various griefs and
| remorses put a heavy strain upon him.
| In La Bohème I found his bedside
| manner rather attractive; but when
Mimi expired — well, I never greatly
cared for these paroxysms of Italian
despair. His voice, though it may not
be the equal of Signor CARUso's in actual
|h.-p., has very seductive qualities. He
is unquestionably the better actor, and
even gave signs of a subtlety that is rare
| enough in opera.
| In Madama Butterfly his sandy wig
(for I assume that it was not his own hair)
gave him a rather unfortunateappearance.
| It was, of course, a concession to the
realities. Having no American accent,
he wanted at least to look like an Anglo-
Saxon, and also to bear some family
resemblance to his flaxen-haired baby,
whose likeness to his father is insisted
upon in the text. All the same, it was
a bad wig, and I was glad that in the
last Act he kept his cap on as long as
he could, and did not (like CARUso) have
to pick it up off a chair in the middle
of a passionate exit. Signora GLACHETTI's
lºº of Madama Butterfly could
ardly be bettered. As the faithful
Suzuki, Signora GIACONIA supported her
well. She was not quite so Japanese
as the charming Madame GILIBERT-
LEJEUNE, but she served; and that
is, after all, what a maid is for.
Having seen Signor SAMMARCO as Rigo-
letto I was sorry for
him in the rather sticky
part of Sharpless. As
the poet says:
O sharpless than a ser-
pent's tooth
It is to have this thankless
task.
The part of Kate
Pinkerton is even
stickier still ; but
Signora GARAVAGLIA was
quite needlessly repel-
lent in her manner. I

carded mistresses. But she is not
likely, in so delicate a situation, to
derive much assistance from a lorgnon.
I hope that Signora GARAVAGLIA is
capable of coming on sometimes with-
out this appendage. I say so, because I
noticed that she was again using one
when she played Musetta in La Bohème.
It is a poor trick, at best.
Dropping in for the last Act of Rigo-
letto on Thursday, I found that the
Management had secured a very charming
tenor in Signor CARPI. He did not quite
come up to my notion of either a duke
or a libertine, but his voice was a vast
improvement upon Signor KRISMER's.
I fancied that Sparafucile's little place on
the Mincio had been pushed rather
nearer the orchestra. The change (if I
was right) offers this advantage, that the
inside couple have less chance of detect-
ing the presence of the outside couple
round the end of the dividing wall when
they both advance to the front in the
Bella figlia quartette, so as to make their
voices carry as far as the rival pair's.
Still it didn't help much, for they must

case, when they are all singing together
by collusion, the attempt at concealment
is hopeless.
This kind of conventional improba-
bility is perhaps excusable in VERD1,
but I do think that the enlightened
PUCCINI might have done without it.
Yet in the Third Act of La Bohème he
allows Rodolfo to sing quite a nice duet
with Mimi when he is not supposed to
be aware that she is in the neighbour-
hood.
The habit of interrupting a scene with
applause of isolated passages is becoming
an intolerable offence. Tradition has
always permitted dreadful things to be
done at the fall of the curtain; the dead
rise while they are still warm ; bitterest
enemies clasp hands; and all come
smirking forward to the footlights. But
artistes might at least discourage the
vulgarity of these interruptions in the
middle of a scene. It would be impos-
sible to imagine a more ridiculous figure
than Signor ZENATELLO cut in the Second
Act of Carmen. Having flung himself on
his knees at the lady's feet in a transport
of passion and buried his face in her lap,
he then raised his head, and turning (still
on his knees) to the audience, did his best
to bow in that embarrassing posture; then
rose torepeat the process with greater com-
fort; and finally resumed his interrupted
genuflexion. I confess that I laughed as
loud as I decently could, and I hope he
heard me.
There are ugly rumours of a Soho
clague in the gallery. If they are true,
the sooner the Management puts a stop
to this alien importation the better it
will be for its own dignity, and for the
claim of Covent Garden to be some-
thing better than a circus. After all,
Grand Opera is supposed to have its place
among the Arts; but what would you
think of a painter who stationed a
batch of hireling puffers opposite his
picture in the Academy to call the
public's attention to its merits?
The social tone of
the audiences would
seem to be improving. I
caught a glimpse the
othernight of the Society
Reporter of The Daily
—, and he had the
glad face of a man who
has sighted a Countess
or two. O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DUTY OF EVENING DRESS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-As it is well known
that you keep an observant eye on social
matters in general, I venture to apprise
you of an important development in the
direction of etiquette which has very
recently taken place in our outlying
suburb. We are, in fact, even now in
the throes of an upheaval brought about
a few days ago by the advocacy in The
Lancet of Evening Dress as indicative of
“tone” and conducive to hygiene. We
were hitherto--I speak, of course, only
of those householders whose rental is not
less than £30 per annum and who
possess at least two sitting or reception-
rooms —we were, I say (if the truth be
admitted) somewhat uncertain in our
inmost hearts as to whether our average
status was that of the upper Middle
Class or merely the middle Middle Class.
But now that our eyes have been opened
to the elevating possibilities of dress
clothes we have promoted ourselves in
a body and at a bound into the lower
Upper Class. I tell you, we hardly know
ourselves, and I don't think you would,
Sir, either.
In one short week the word has passed
round that it is “de rigour” (we are
particular about the phrase) for both
sexes to change their work-a-day habili-
ments before sitting down to the evening
meal—which, by the way, must never
be called “supper” now, but invariably
“ dinner.” We, that is to say, the gentle-
men, offer our arms to the ladies while
taking them in to the same, though we
are divided in opinion as to whether it
should be the right or the left arm, not
having the latest edition of Mammers for
Men amongst us. We insist also on
having a menu (which we pronounce
correctly “may new "), even if the courses
are only cold mutton and tapioca pud-
ding, and we manage to put it in French,
thanks to several clever married ladies,
who have been governesses, amongst us
—though perhaps you will excuse my
transcribing the expressions here. I
have not a very good accent for writing
the Gallic idiom. Coffee is now regularly
served round —never tea or cocoa —after
dinner in the proper sized cups and with
granulated sugar (not the brown kind);
and though it keeps some of us awake at
might we feel it is the right thing, or
“It,” as the Americans say. Liqueurs
are found perhaps to be somewhat of a tax,
pecuniarily speaking, but it is realised
that sacrifices must be made in the
sacred cause.
And this leads me here to mention
that some of us are real martyrs in the
matter. GRUBBE, for instance, who is a
struggling literary man and can only get
inspired in the night hours, is finding
his means of living sadly restricted by
the hampering panoply of shirt-front,
Country Gent (late of the City) observing Countryman raise his hat as he passes, throws him
a shilling.
Countryman. “Thank'EE, SIR-(icith emphasis):-BUT-I-war N'T-TAKIN"—off—My—’AT—
TO—You.
I -—w UR-A'sch ATCHIN'—MY—HEAD !”
which he inevitably inks (and loses time
and temper over), to the consequent
increase of his laundry bills. The
CROMPEs (pronounced Crumps) are so
impressed with the necessity of living
up to and displaying their respective
white waistcoat and somewhat decolty
dinner-gown that they have to spend
many more shillings than they can
afford in theatre tickets and train and
cab fares every other night. JoWEs, who
is middle-aged and stout, is obliged to
hurry home from the City so as to be
able to hook-and-eye his wife up her
back (as she hasn't a maid), and I fear
the constant sprinting this entails will
shortly result in a doctor's bill. His
next-door neighbour (I need not give his
name) is, I believe, finding the expense
of hiring his swallow-tail by the week
rather too much for him ; and there are
several other hard cases which I have
not now time to enlarge upon.
Still, when all is said and done, I
think you will agree with me that we
are doing our duty as Britishers in the
great work of social regeneration—only
I sometimes anxiously ask myself if we
shall be able to stand the racket, and
where will it all end ?
Relying upon your sympathy,
Yours progressively, Zig-ZAG.
MR. BourCHIER long ago expressed the
view that dramatic critics cannot do
themselves justice if they record their
impressions of a play on the first night.
It is, therefore, only fair to him to
reproduce here the Teesdale Mercury's
dramatic critic on Hamlet:—
“Mr. ARTHUR Phillips was a clever, un-
daunted, and accomplished Hamlet. . . . His
soliloquy upon death was passing fine, while
his address to the Ghost was marvellously
realistic. More sublimely weird language
was certainly never penned by mortal man,
and the audience was simply spellbound. . . .
Knowing, as we do, the play from beginning to
end, it was a night of real enjoyment to our-
selves.”

THE DOGS OF WAR.
(By the Author of “A Dog Day.”)
XII.
THE END.
I Now come to the last chapter. And
it will be a difficult one for me to tell,
for the thought of the Captain's end still
cuts me like a knife.
Yes, he died, did this great dog whose
portrait I have attempted to draw.
Would that I had been taken in his
place, for the world could have better
spared me! One cannot understand
these things.
How vividly I remember it all ! How
strange that he who had never had a
day's serious illness in his life should
go out suddenly as he did
On the evening before the end he
came round to me. I offered him food.
He refused it. “Captain,” I said,
“you're ill.” He then told me that all
the afternoon he had been suffering
from dreadful pains in the underneath.
He had come round to me in the hope
that a little walk might do him good.
Even as he told me this he was shaken
by a dreadful spasm, and I advised him
to get home as quickly as he could and
go to bed. It was evident that he had
eaten something which had disagreed with
him. I then saw him home, though it
was only with the greatest difficulty that
he could walk, so frequent now were the
spasms. I did not offer to go in, as I
could see he would rather be left alone.
So, with a “Good-bye, old man, keep
yourself warm, and I'll be round in the
morning,” I left him, little thinking
that that would be the last time I should
see the dear fellow. I remember that
as I spoke to him he looked up grate-
fully at me.
Stupidly, I did not realise how serious
the matter was. The Captain had had
similar attacks in a small way before,
and they had always passed off over-
night. I had often told him that he was
not sufficiently particular as to what he
ate, Sometimes when very hungry he
would pick up things in the road.
Yet in a vague sort of way I seemed
to have a kind of premonition of what
was going to happen. I could not sleep,
and as soon as the gate was unlocked
in the morning I rushed up to the Cap-
tain's house. When I came to the
corner where the Captain, with his bright
little face, usually ran down to meet me,
there was no Captain there, and all the it was stomach trouble.
wag went from my tail. I walked up
to his door, but there was still no Cap-
tain. With sinking heart I sat down
and whined until a servant opened the
door. Her eyes were red with weeping.
She patted my head, and all she said
was, “Poor, poor doggie ' "
Then I knew.
I do not know how I dragged myself
home. I was as one stunned. The sense
of overwhelming misfortune seemed to
numb me, and my legs almost gave way
under me. I could not eat anything,
and I remember my master, who did
not know what had happened, tried to
joke with me. In the afternoon my
people must have heard the news, for
they were both extra nice to me, and
my mistress petted me and tried in vain
to tempt me with all sorts of niceties
from her special sugar-biscuit box.
Later in the afternoon I made another
journey to the house, for on thinking
it over I could not believe it. Somehow
I thought the Captain had so much in-
fluence that he would never die. And
Seated on his own doorstep, surrounded by
devoted friends, all looking up to him, the wise
head on the young shoulders. How fine he
looked then
on reaching his street my heart gave a
great leap, for I noticed that in none of
the houses were the blinds drawn. In
my excitement I scratched the door
impatiently, and when it was opened I
rushed into every room, crying, “ Cap-
tain Captain ' " But the only answer
I received were the servant's sobs, and
then indeed I knew that my dear friend
Was no limore.
Subsequently I learned that he had
passed away early in the morning, and
the doctor who was called in said it was
Gastritis. So I was wrong in thinking
The Captain,
I fancy, would have liked the big word.
He was buried in the dead of the
night at some unknown spot. By reason
of his being hurried into a secret grave,
I was prevented, to my eternal regret,
from carrying out his last wishes. The
Captain had always feared lest he should
be buried alive, and he had made me
promise that, if he predeceased me, the
most approved scientific method of ascer-
taining whether there was still life in
him should be employed. So I was to
have offered him a biscuit.
Dear old fellow, I hope he knows it
was not my fault
The suddenness of it all was appalling.
On the day following his death I was
summoned to a mass meeting of the
Club which had been hastily called
together by interested parties. It was
the fullest meeting ever held. It had
been rumoured that the Captain had
been poisoned by one of the rival Clubs,
and there were angry threats of reprisals.
But there was very little genuine affec-
tion for the Captain shown. It seemed
to me that I was the only one who was
really heart-sore. The question of a
new Captain was raised with indecent
haste, and I think I was the only one
not mentioned for the post, as I did not
mention myself. As a matter of fact
the Captain had once said, while dining
at my house, that, if anything were to
happen to him, he wished me to be his
successor. But I did not speak. I
came away before the meeting was
over, for it sickened me to hear them
wrangling over the leadership, and the
Captain scarcely gone. Mongrels'
I had done with them. This was the
respect they paid to the memory of the
Captain who had made them what they
were —who had slaved for them and
watched over them like a father. Never
again would I have anything to do with
the petty crew. Blood will tell, after
all. Bids were subsequently made for
me by the thorough-breeds, but their
advances too were rejected by me. I
owed that to the Captain. I was willing
to become a social outcast. Thanks to
the Captain, I was now strong enough
to stand alone.
The Club survived the Captain for
about a week. Then it split up into
about a dozen different societies and
associations, some of which comprised
only two members, each with the rank
of Captain.
So the Captain's life-work perished
with him.
I too nearly died. For days I could
not touch food, and it was only
thanks to the loving care of my mistress
and the gentle concern of Smith that I
was brought round. At times I even
thought of doing away with myself, and
that the first motor-car I met might have
me. But my mistress and Smith made
me feel that they would miss me. They,
and even my master, were very good to
me, so that I began to see that the
Captain was right in his opinion of
humans—as, of course, he was right in
everything.
What a rare fellow he was ' The dear
Captain' Have I pictured him I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
In the Days of the Comet (MACMILIAN) is something greater
than a good novel. It is a brilliantly successful effort in the
higher world of romance. It requires deep design and deft
treatment to make the Twentieth Century reader enjoy study
of supernatural conditions of life. That is the task Mr.
WELLs set for himself, and he has triumphantly accomplished
it. The average novelist, proposing to describe daily life
in a comet, viould in his first chapter have soared aloft and
straightway grappled with the fancied surroundings of an
imaginary orb. Shrewder, more original, Mr. WELLs brings
his comet to the earth. In the act of collision the strange
visitor dissolves itself, infusing our patient planet with a
gas that creates a new atmosphere, a loſtier form of life.
Ugly things bloom in sudden beauty... 1)irt, decrepitude,
poverty, war disappear. Mankind dwells in a new earth,
domed by a more gracious heaven. In the wild fancy of
the romancist, even Cabinet Ministers become honest patriots,
uninfluenced by personal ambition, striving only to serve
their country. Which things are, I suspect, an allegory.
Mr. WELLs's colliding comet has transformed a wearied old
world into one young, joyous, pure and good. “Never a
chimney smokes about our world to-day, and the sound
of the weeping of children who toiled and hungered, the
dull despair of over-burdened women, the noise of brute
quarrels in alleys, all shameful pleasures and all the ugly
grossness of wealthy pride have gone with them.” The
change was effected in a night, without fuss or fury. We
went to bed after striving all day to get the better of each
other, to amass wealth, some of us to commit crime. We
woke in the morning with a sense of being what the late
LoRD CHANCELLOR would call “a sort of" communistic cheru-
bim. There is some fine satire on our former method of
daily life, the more effective because it is quietly done.
Mr. Louis Joseph VANCE's new book is called The Private
War, but previous to its publication by E. GRANT RICHARDs
Mr. WILLIAM DE MoRGAN had written Joseph Vance. The
hero and narrator of The Private War is Gordon Traill,
and it only remains for Traill to write Mr. de Morgan, and
then the matter will be fairly settled. Still it was careless
of Mr. VANCE to have been christened Joseph-I am not sure
that it isn't almost actionable. Meanwhile it may be some
consolation to him to hear that he has had at any rate one
appreciative reader, who followed up Gordon Traill all
through the night, one ear alert for revolver shots. (It is
Traill's friend Serrance who does the great feat of blowing
the lock off the door - a thing I have always wanted to try,
“as performed daily in romances.") There are heaps of
corpses in the story; but what I particularly like about it
is that all the fun, or anyhow most of it, takes place in
England in 1906 - no Zendas or fifteenth-centuries for Mr.
VANCE. (The police, of course, were busy catching motorists.
After all, what is a murder when one has a stop-watch 2)
The Prirate War is of the same nature as Mr. MARRIOTT-
WATsox's Adrenturers, and it is high praise to Mr. VANCE to
say that the two may be mentioned in the same breath – or
rather, in the same moment of breathlessness.
America has long possessed a fairly young humorist (in
addition to “Mr. Dooley "). His name is OLIVER HERFORD,
and he is an Englishman. The competition was too strong
at home, so he went over there. His latest book of verse is
called The Fairy Godmother-in-law (BICKERs), and he has
himself drawn the pictures for it very charmingly. It is a
facile pen, so facile that it will rhyme you preserve with
reserre; Theology with Zoology; way, away and anyway
all in one verse, and proposed, composed and opposed in
three consecutive rhymes. Yet, for all this, Mr. HERFoRD's
technique is workmanlike; while his matter is fluent and
his style unstrained. If he has had a model it is Mr. W. S.
GILBERT. Certainly Mr. HERFORD's delightful fancy of the
boa-constrictor that tried to fascinate a stuffed bird on a
lady's hat recalls the tale of the bogey in Bab Ballads, who
sought in vain to scarify the wooden Highlander outside a
tobacco-shop.

A book entitled Sir Joshua and His Circle is a little con-
fusing. Giotto and His Circle I could understand ; or Astley
and His Ring. But what had Sir Joshua to do with a circle?
Is it another word for an ear-trumpet? On dipping into the
book, however, all is clear enough : Sir Joshu A's circle was
his friends, and more than his friends, his acquaintance,
even contemporaries whom he hardly knew. Mr. FitzGERALD
MoLLoy, the author, ropes all in. It is a pleasant book to
loaf over, and the reader will find the times of the great
painter very agreeably re-created for him; but what, I wonder,
do the publishers, Messrs. HUTCHINSON, mean by calling the
horrid shiny stuff on which the reproductions of the master's
portraits are printed, “art paper” 2. When does paper cease
to be honest paper and become “art paper” ”
The Cruise of the Dazzler (HopDER AND STOUGHTON) is a
breezy book, redolent of the sea. It is the sort of story that
will give keen pleasure to a boy, whose father should read
it first. Parental virtue will thereby find its reward. Mr. JACK
LONDON, like some other writers who thoroughly understand
the sea in its many moods, is at his best when manoeuvring
a ship in a storm. Joe's father, from whose palatial estab-
lishment the lad runs away to find a berth on the Dazzler,
is a wordy prig. Even the roughs with whom Joe fights in
the back streets of San Francisco suggest copy-head phrases
in their talk. 'Frisco Kid, Joe's chum on the Dazzler, is a
little sickly in his pathos. But French Pete, the Captain
of the Dazzler, and Red Nelsom, who sails the Reindeer, are
capital. Happily they loom large through the surging story.
A VHRY interesting fact has been brought to light with
regard to the horse St. Luke which won the Welter Selling
Plate last week at Newmarket. The credit for this feat of
research is due to The Evening News. “St. Luke,” says
that organ of theology, “was named after the Evangelist who
is generally acknowledged to have written both the Gospel
bearing his name and the Acts of the Apostles.”

OF FASHIONABLE WEDDINGS.
Old Court, Meadowbury.
DEAREST DAPHNE, --Thanks ever so
muchly for the lovely pendant–so sweet
of you to remember I'm fond of sap-
phires. But, my dear child, what a
letter to send with a wedding presentſ
“Full of wise saws and modern in-
stances,” as the Psalmist says. Had I
been Early Victorian, I might have cried
over it, but crying, blushing, and faint-
ing are forgotten industries, aren't they 2
--like staining glass and dyeing some-
thing purple.
Yes, old girl, I know. But though
all you say is true perhaps, it's not the
sort of truth we can all live up to.
Don't worry about me, DAPHNE, I don't
know that I'm altogether worth it.
And don't blame me either. I'm the
victim of circs. As for your pity, my
dear, I simply don't want it, and return
it to you, carriage paid.
her to buck up sufficiently to be dressed.
And what the Sideglancer called “a
pretty and touching innovation, likely
to catch on at weddings,” i.e., CASHLEss
mère standing close to her daughter
through the ceremony—was simply and
solely to prevent her from bolting before
the knot was tied.
But Violet's only a half-bred 'un,
after all. Blood tells in these matters,
and, when you've made up your mind
to a thing, carries you through with a
stiff upper lip.
Josiah (I suppose I must call him so
sometimes, though I jib at it every time)
has given me a simply gorgeous tiara
and collet necklace to match-diamonds
and sapphires –- enormous stones – as
well as heaps of smaller bits of jewellery.
I really don't think I could have done
much better as to jewels, if I’d become
Princess GALoshkin. But there are
other considerations, and I own to you,
my DAPHNE, in this my last Speech and
-
that can't be repeated too often, and
that pattern, my dear, is cheque.
It's to be an entirely white wedding,
out of compliment to my front name.
You bridesmaids aren't to have a touch
of colour, even in your posies, and the
school-children are to strew nothing
but white flowers in my bridal path.
J. M. has had a ripping all-white
Darracq built for us to “go away” in.
I've dubbed it carte blanche. Did I
tell you that STELLA CLACKMANNAN's
yourfgest boy is to be a page, and BABs
the Second a pagess-if there is such a
thing? The whole wedding is to be
“presented" by SoAMEs of Piccadilly.
Oh my ownest friend Only a few days

I'm certain), took care to tell him of
my engagement, and he left Irgendeinbad
quite suddenly.
The presents are simply pouring in,
and JoAN and HILDEGARDE are in the
seventh heaven arranging them. As
usual there's a frightful lot all of one
pattern. In my case it takes the form
of umbrella-handles. My dear, I've
ceased to count them, jewelled and
otherwise. People seem to think I'm
going to pass the rest of my life in the
open, and in very bad weather at that.
Just fancy, the BULLYoN-BotNDERMERE

pair of opera-glasses, all enamel and
jewels. I suppose they look upon it as

he hadn't thought about it before, but
he supposed he would be my “First

would find me a “ dutiful niece.”
He's a horrid boy, and I'm glad to
say that I almost quite hate him now.
Among the presents that came yesterday
was a little bangle from him, with
“Girlie" on it in small brilliants and
sapphires. I've sent him a little morocco
memo-book with gold corners and mono-
gram and a wee gold pencil, and on the
first page I’ve written his own aphorism

business, and nothing matters much.”

DO ANIMALS COMMIT SUICIDE 2
The letter under the above heading in a daily contem-
porary, the writer of which asserts that a terrier dog recently
put a deliberate end to existence by flinging, itself before
a motor-bus, has produced a number of similar communi-
cations to The Spectator. Through what appears to be a
breach of confidence some of these have been forwarded to
Mr. Punch. In the same spirit he publishes them.
DEAR SIR,-Unquestionably they do. I have frequently
heard my great aunt (the late Miss TIBBLEs) refer to the
peculiarly sad case of a favourite half-Persian cat, which,
owing to grief at some fancied slight, committed suicide no
fewer than nine times, on the last occasion with fatal results.
The combination of despair and patience requisite to enable
the unhappy animal to take all its lives in this deliberate
manner is (I venture to think) characteristic of the mysterious
East from which it, or half of it, sprang.
Faithfully yours,
REGINALD CHUINEY, Lt.-Col. (retired).
SIR,- It may not be (I should prefer to believe it cannot
be) generally known that the tombs of domestic pets which
have been interred in private ground are, in an enormous
number of cases, in a far from satisfactory condition. I am
cognisant of at least one instance, in Lower Balham, where
the sepulchre of a once cherished canary is now habitually used
for the purpose of ºrowing mustard and cress. Whether
any of these neglectºd favourites originally perished at their
own hands or not I am unable to ascertain, but the scandal
remains the same. Indignantly yours,
ALG-RN-N ASHT-N.
DEAR SIR,--Some years ago my sister confided to me the
following facts, for the accuracy of which she was prepared
to vouch. A goldfish, to which she was considerably attached,
had been observed for some time to receive marked attentions
from a young lizard in an adjacent fernery. On the lizard
being given away to a friend, the unhappy gold-fish exhibited
every symptom of uncontrollable grief, until one morning.
when she went as usual to feed her pet, my sister was
horrified to discover its inanimate corpse at the bottom of
the bowl. The faithful creature had committed suicide by
drowning. I may add that my sister was so seriously
affected by this discovery that it was soon afterwards found
necessary to place her under a modified form of restraint,
owing to the development of mental weakness from which
she never entirely recovered. Yours, &c.,
(Miss) Sophia CLUTTERBUCK.
SIR,-With reference to this exceedingly interesting dis-
cussion I am irresistibly reminded of the quotation “There
are more things in Heaven and Earth than Horatio,” a truth
to which some of us would do well at times to pay more
attention. I have never known a case of quadrupedal felo:
de-se within my personal experience, but on the other hand
I cannot recall any instance in which, to my knowledge, a
member of the so-called brute creation deliberately refrained
from such a course. Trusting that you will be able to make
use of this brief contribution to the subject in hand, which
may possibly suggest material for comment to others of your
valued correspondents,
I remain, yours obediently,
A CONSTANT WRITER.
SIR,- In this connection it may interest you to hear of an inci:
dent which occurred no longer ago than last Friday, when I
was walking in the neighbourhood of Soho, accompaniel
as usual by my inseparable companion, a valuable Dachs.

in the course of the morning I had had occasion to administer
a rebuke to the animal for some trifling indiscretion, but ſh;

I observed that Fritz was gazing with the most fixel
attention at the window of a ham and beef shop, wherein

silence, the devoted creature fixed his expressive eyes, hºw

GETTING THE BLUES.
(A Story founded on Fact.)
CARFAx College was plunged in gloom,
And a cloud hung over the Common room,
For alas, the College no longer held
The place that she did in the days of eld.
There had been a time when she used to shiver
Unless she remained at the head of the river,
And Carfax men were wont to yield
To none in the cricket or football field.
But now the glory was all departed.
What wonder the College was broken-hearted ?
'Twas years since she'd boasted a bat of note
Or a single man in the Varsity boat.
Nay, worse—well might the dons turn pale !
Last year—I shudder to tell the tale—
There happened that which appeared to portend
The fatal beginning that marked the end.
Last year—they did their best, no doubt,
To hush up the horror, but truth will out—
Last year, by some curious freak of the fates,
A Carfax man took a first in Greats.
And while the College was still aghast
At this hideous blot on her glorious past,
And, while she was striving in vain to forget,
There happened a greater calamity yet—
A youth came up to Carfax who
Made off with the Hertford and Ireland too.
The dons despaired: you know, perhaps,
That dons are a curious race of chaps,
Though you might be surprised that they could not
choose
But be depressed when they'd got no blues."

And scarce had they let the gangway down
When the Master of Carfax was greeting BRowN.
Don't ask me, pray, to relate what fell
Betwixt the twain, for I cannot tell.
I only know that the man of might
Appeared in a scholar's gown that night;
I only know that the Carfax boat

Has now given way to a roaring boom,

Park Lane.
At the corner of Brook Street the eye
of the pedestrian is at once riveted by
the stately façade of Wontwash House,
the superb palazzo of Sir ALGERNON
BRooks. The dazzling purity of the
tiles testifies to constant ablution, and
a peculiarly charming effect is produced
by the pair of life-size baboons in Car-
rara marble which stand as supporters
on each side of the massive portal. Sir
ALGERNoN BRooks, it will be remembered,
is the hereditary President of Brooks's
Club, and his private menagerie at
Monk Brandon is only surpassed by
that of the Hon. WALTER Rothschild.
The passer-by will not fail to notice the
magnificent Araucarias standing in pots
on the steps. Their presence, it may be
surmised, accounts for the curious fact
that this particular part of Park Lane
is never free from organ-grinders.
The delicate Campanile which sur-
mounts the richly-ornamented Byzantine
structure a few houses lower down is
one of the most graceful features of
Park Lane. This is the home of one of
England's greatest captains of industry,
Mr. C. F. MoBERLY BELL, whose masterly
conduct of the great campaign against
the publishers has filled Mr. FREDERIC
HARRISON, a Huntingdonshire Vicar,
and a retired Admiral, with boundless
enthusiasm. All three of them. In
the courtyard may be observed a fine
second-hand bear from the Bear-wood
menagerie, and through the grille a
glance may be obtained of a splendid
group of statuary representing the
American Generals Hooper and STONEWALL
JAckson receiving the submission of the
Fathers of the Row.
Ch.APTER III.
Hyde Park.
From Park Lane it is an easy step to
Hyde Park—unless a motor-car gets
you. In that case St. George's Hospital
is just across the way, at Hyde Park
Corner, placed there by the Automobile
Club for the purpose. London also is
full of cheap undertakers, one of the
best being Mr. --- [No.: Editor.] The
right of free burial in Hyde Park, which
used to be extended to all members of
BooDLF's, White's, and The Times Book
Club, has recently been withdrawn.
Hyde Park, so named from the historic
game of Hide and Seek played there by
Willi AM THE Fourth and Mrs. John AN,
is a large tract of grass entirely sur-
rounded by houses. Few districts of
London are so thinly populated as Hyde
Park; in fact were the whole city like
this it could hardly contain its five
million inhabitants. In the midst is a
winding lake called the Serpentine, a
corruption of Turpentine, with which
fluid it was originally filled in the old
days before gas and other modern im-
provements. Now, however, there is
water there, and bathing takes place
every morning, summer and winter.
Among the most regular of the swimmers
are Mr. SwixBURNE, Mr. WATTS DUNTON,
Miss KELLERMAN and Mr. MoWTAGU Hof-
BEIN. It was here that BYRON (whose
statue commemorating the deed is close
by in Hamilton Gardens) swam the
Hellespont.
Before leaving the Park and return-
ing to Park Lane let us pause awhile
by the Marble Arch and listen to the
orators. But first a fact about this
building. Its name, like so many other

OUR UNTRUsTwo RTHY ARtist IN LONDON.
Colouring the Troopers on the King's Birthday
in Hyde Park.
London words (e. g. Serpentine), is a cor-
ruption of something else. The building
was originally erected to mark the grave
of a very beautiful actress named MABEL
ARCH, who, in a fit of pique on hearing
of her understudy's engagement to a
peer's second cousin, committed suicide
at this spot. The warm heart of London,
always palpitating with fealty to the
stage, insisted on raising this monument
to her memory, in spite of the opposition
of a stern critical school whose motto
was, “MABEL may be ARCH, but WILLIAM
is ARCHER.”
It is just by the Marble Arch that many
of our leading statesmen,_beginning,
of course, with Mr. Joseph ARch,-have
first learned their trade. It is a severe
but salutary school. Had not Mr. WIN-
STON CHURCHILL addressed crowds here
every Sunday afternoon for a year he
would not now gain the ear of the
House in the way he does. Mr. John
MoRLEY too. And the same with Mr.
BRYCE, whose rounded periods were all
first tried on the audiences that gather
here.
On the KING's birthday all London
flocks to Hyde Park to see the very
interesting ceremony known as colouring
the troopers. With the assistance of a
pot of paint this is quickly and effec-
tively done. No other nation, it is
affirmed, has so original a way of
honouring its monarch. And yet the
English are not considered an artistic

if he be not a Cobdenite, then it may be
asked, what is Cobdenism 2 " This
problem has so far been unsolved, but
Mr. Punch believes that the answer is
that among the exponents and advocates
of the free traders (in books) is the
Editor of The Times, who, if he be not
a Chamberlainite, then it may be asked,
what is Chamberlainism 2

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DEGLINE AND FALL OF MUSIC.
THE statement, recently made in the
Press, that a famous singer was about to
open a dairy has attracted attention to
the economics of the musical profession.
With a view to securing the best expert
opinion on the subject a representative
of Mr. Punch called last Friday on Mr.
ENDYMION SABLE, the famous musical
agent, impresario and concert director,
with the instructive results appended
here with.
“Is it true, Mr. SABLE,” asked our
representative, “that there is an increas-
ing exodus of professional artists into
non-musical callings "
“That is so, I regret to say,” replied
the omniscient impresario, as he laid
down his gilt-tipped cigarette. “With-
in the last week no fewer than five
leading singers and instrumentalists have
removed their names from my books.
Mr. Hoby GULLICK is going into the
banana trade; Madame ADELINA MEDWIN
is starting a vegetarian restaurant; Dr.
MAX LAGERBOH M is entering a firm of
publishers, in consequence of the roseate
accounts given by The Times of the
enormous profits to be extracted from
that line of business; Signor BEPPo
SPAGHETTI is qualifying for a chauffeur;
and – saddest case of all-–YANNI KRITIKOS,
the Klephtic pianist, has been appren-
ticed to a West-end hairdresser.”
“To what cause,” asked our represen-
tative, in accents of deep concern, “do
you ascribe this singular desertion of so
honourable a calling 2"
“Many motives are doubtless at work,”
replied Mr. SABLE. “The example of Mr.
PADEREwski, who is increasingly addicted
to agriculture, must no doubt count for
something. But the fickleness and
shrinkage of the concert-going public are
more largely responsible. There is after
all only a certain amount of money to
go round, and music is no longer popular
when performed by adult artists. Pian-
ists and violinists are too old at twenty,
and singers of more than thirty summers
are being rapidly superseded by the
gramophone. The most painful part of
my business is inquiry into the age of
alleged prodigies. Only the other day
I was obliged to break a contract with
Boris KARAVELoFF, the Bulgarian BEET-
Hovey, owing to the distressing dis-
covery that in spite of his babyish
appearance and velvet jacket, he
shaved every morning, and was born in
1886.” .
“But I thought that the demand for
good music was greater than ever?”
“True; but the variety insisted upon
is more than the human frame can pos-
sibly stand. For instance, I have just
been reading a most interesting book on
the rising generation, in which the fol-

[OCTOBER 24, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CONSPIRACY OF 1906.
ON Wednesday, the 17th day of
October, before Mr. Punch at his Court
in Bouverie Street, Mr. HoOPER, and
Messrs. MoBERLY BELL, Pot LTEN, BYLEs,
and HALL CAINE were charged with
conspiring together with intent to cause
a breach of the peace of the breakfast-
table. A gentleman who gave his name
as R. 17623/284975 was charged with
aiding and abetting them. . HoopFR
failed to put in an appearance, but the
Court decided to take the case without
him.
John SMITH was called first, and gave
evidence that the peace and harmony of
his breakfast-table had been completely
spoiled by the accused. After reading
their letters to each other he felt quite
ill, and was unable to digest properly.
Some letters, of course, were worse than
others. It was an interview with Mr.
BYLEs, for instance, that gave him that
stab in the back.
Mr. Punch said he thought witness
must be thinking of something else.
Witness admitted that this might be
so, but said that in any case the nuisance
was an intolerable one. He simply
dared not open his paper at the break-
fast-table now.
Messrs. BROWN, JONES, and RobiNSON
having given similar evidence, the
counsel for the prosecution intimated
that that was his case.
The prisoners elected to give evidence
on their own behalf, whereupon Mr.
PoULTEN went into the witness-box and
said: I am Secretary to the Publishers'
Association. I write those pretty letters
that appear in the papers every day. I
write them all myself. Nobody helps me.
Cross-eramined.— He wrote them in
the mornings. He could not say how
he spent his afternoons, but generally he
would be resting. It was not true that he
derived great benefit from the Encyclo-
pºedia Britannica in the composition of
his letters. He had already given his
opinion of that work, and he would
repeat it here. On second thoughts he
wouldn't, but it was true all the same.
He had never conspired with the other
prisoners. Some of them he had never
heard of. He had heard of HALL CAINE,
of course. He had never seen Mr.
HoopF.R.
Re-eramined. - He was not Mr. HoopFR.
Mr. BYLEs said: I am a publisher. I
have been interviewed nine times, and
have written eighteen letters on the
matter. I had no reasons for doing this,
save love of Literature. I have nothing
at all to gain ; on the contrary I have
spent one and sixpence in stamps. I
have never conspired with anybody. I
have seen Mr. HoopFR. (Sensation.)
Cross-examined. – When he said he
had seen Mr. HoopFR he meant that he
had seen a gentleman who gave his name
as HoopFR. He (Mr. BYLEs) did not
belong to the Publishers' Association.
He could not say that too often. So far
he had said it twenty-seven times.
Though he did not belong to the Asso-
ciation he admired Mr. Poultex's style.
It was true his firm was a rising one,
but he has never told his interviewers
so. He had no idea how these things
got in the paper.
Re-examined.-- He was not Mr. HoopFR.
Mr. MoberLY BELL said: I am Manager
of The Times. I have written very few
letters to the papers. My speciality is
interviews. I am interviewed every day.
In my interviews I always say I am
quite happy and that the War is over.
As a matter of fact it has only been a
sort of war.
Cross-examined.—He had heard of
Lord HALSBURY and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.
They were members of the Book Club,
but he didn't quite see the connection.
The war really was over. He was very
busy just now, but that was only be-
cause he had to be interviewed so
many times. He had never conspired
with anybody. It was the other way
round. He had heard of America, of
course. Colt MBUs discovered it.
Re-examined.—That was in the Ency-
clopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition.
Cross-examined.--He would swear to
that. He did not understand what
counsel insinuated by “Stop - Press
News.” It was in the main article on
America. There was no American Syn-
dicate that controlled The Times. Mr.
HoopFR wrote some of the advertise-
ments, that was all. He had frequently
seen Mr. HoopFR, and had given him
orders. He could not swear that Mr.
HoopFR was not an American. He had
never asked him. He really could not
be bothered with the private history of
all his subordinates.
Re-examined.-- He was not Mr. HoopFR.
Mr. HALL CAINE said: I am a novelist
and a dramatist. I am about to publish
a perfectly new work of fiction at half-a-
('I'OWn.
Cross-eramined.—It was called The
Bondman. It was not an old work. He
admitted that he had written a book
called The Bondman many years ago,
and that a dramatised version was now
being played at Drury Lane, but this
was neither of those. This was the play
turned back into a story again, and was
therefore quite different. Also it was to
contain a photograph of himself. He
would not swear that he had never been
photographed before. Many people
denied that this would be a test of the
dearness of novels, but he himself was
quite self-satisfied.
Re-examined. — Quite satisfied, he
meant, of course. He was not Mr.
HoopFR.
Cross-examined. — He believed the
advertisement rates of The Daily Mail
were very high. He had never heard
of the expression “Self-advertisement
rates.”
R 17623/284975 said: I am a member
of the T.B.C.
Cross-examined.—He had written to
The Times to say how grateful he was.
He had not signed it. He hated self-
advertisement. He was not “Author
of Forty Years Standing,” nor was
he “Book Lover.” He was just
R 17623/284975. M.O.2846 was another
gentleman.
Before witness could be re-examined
Mr. Punch interposed, saying that he
had heard enough. The prisoners were
found guilty, and Messrs. BELL, BYLEs,
Pot LTEN and CAINE would be condemned
to read each other's letters. Mr. HoopFR
and R 17623/284975 would come up for
judgment together when called upon.

Outclassed the hair-compelling Sioux;
Most pensive Bruin, I descry
Thy presence with profound regret,
This bosom weeps for thee, this eye
Is sympathetically wet.
Pent in yon dark Cimmerian den
Thou liest in enforced repose;
A barren wall obscures thy ken,
Odours of fish assail thy nose.
The crowd moves by, but thou art banned,
An object of delight to none;
No smiles encourage thee, no hand
Confers the unexpected bun.
And lo! as though to point the jest,
A board confronts the empty air,
Bearing the humorous request
“Please not to irritate the bear !”
Oh I have seen in many lands
Bears of all sorts and divers hues:
Bears that performed with gipsy bands,
And some immured in alien Zoos.
Some crawled up mercenary poles,
While others stood upon their head;
All seemed profoundly cheerful souls,
And not a few were overſed.
Thou only, friendless and apart,
Sitting disconsolate dost brood
Alike on man's unfeeling heart,
And the prevailing dearth of food.

obvious reasons) that each quotation has
not a page to itself; but none the less Mr.
SIDGwick is to be congratulated upon the
very successful result of what must have
been a labour of love and much laughter.

A CHAFING-DISH SUPPER.
I SHOULD never have given REGGIE a
chafing dish for his birthday if I hadn't
seen the picture of the girl in the adver-
tisement. She was cooking a dainty
little meal on the supper table, while the
guests sat round in attitudes of respect
and admiration, and the full elbow-sleeve
..of her semi-evening blouse fell back so
insinuatingly from her rounded arm that
the idea at once occurred to me like an
inspiration that my blue crêpe de Chine
could be easily adapted for the purpose.
“If you'd really like to know what I
want for my birthday,” said REGGIE,
alluding to a conversation that had taken
place some time previously, “I could do
with another trouser press.”
“Oh, no, dear,” I replied quickly,
“that wouldn't do. I want to give you
something quite personal, in fact I've
settled what it is to be.” I didn't men-
tion that I had saved thirty-three and
tempence out of the housekeeping for it
already, but I did suggest we should
go to the theatre for a birthday treat,
and have a nice little supper when we
got back. ..
“In that case,” said REGGIE, “we
might invite the BARKERS. I know you
don't care about Mrs. BARKER, but BARKER
can be very useful to me.”
I did not care about Mrs. BARKER.
Still, in consideration of the fact that
she is a bony person herself and it
would be rather good for her to see my
arms, I consented.
REGGIE's chief fault lies in forgetting
all about his birthday and resuming his
everyday manner five minutes after his
presents have been given, which is very
disappointing to the giver.
“You see, darling,” I insisted gently
when, on his birthday morning, he had
pushed the chafing dish aside and taken
up the paper as usual, “we shall never
have to complain of lukewarm suppers
now, served by sulky, sleepy servants
when we get home late. You will have
your meal of three courses tossed together
before your eyes, piping hot—the book
says so.” . REGGIE picked up the
brilliantly plated lid and looked at it.
“It will do to shave by, anyhow,” he
said. “But, dearest, if you really want
to try it to-night we'd better have a
joint on the sideboard as well.”
I felt my eyes fill.
“Then you'll spoil the whole thing,"
I murmured huskily; “I was going to
give you Kedgeree of Lobster, Hamburg
Steak, and Macaroni a la crème, and I
thought you'd be pleased.” . At that
REGGIE suddenly remembered it was his
birthday, and declared it would be
ripping, assuring me that the chaſing
dish was the nicest birthday present
he'd ever had.
We met the BARKERs at the theatre,
and Mrs. BARKER informed me during
the play that in consequence of the
hint in my note of a pleasant surprisº
for supper, they had both dined
frugally. We were all hungry when
we got back, and I ran upstairs first
to see that the maids had put every-
thing ready to my hand on the supper-
table before going to bed. All was as
it should be. Shaking back my º
and holding the butter in one hand an
the chafing dish lid in the other, I turned
to greet my guests with a bright smile,
Mrs. BARKER entered first, her glance
raking the table greedily—then she saw
the chafing dish, and her face fell. -
“Oh,” she remarked, “we had one of

I smiled indulgently, and said, “They
only want proper management. Light

REGGIE, as with a pretty and artistic
gesture I mixed the eggs, lobster, butter

ciatively, but his wife requested to have
the window open, saying the fumes
made her feel faint. As a matter of
fact they were hardly noticeable till the
draught spread the flame and burnt the
kedgeree at the sides of the dish. Any-
how it was served piping hot; indeed
Mr. BARKER, who took a generous mouth-
ful out of compliment to me, burnt his
tongue rather badly.
“What are these little bits of hard
stuff I keep finding in my mouth 2"
said REGGIE.
“Teeth, I should imagine,” I remarked
coldly.
“Rice''' announced Mrs. BARKER, in
a sombre voice, “and I fear I have
swallowed some. You must excuse my
leaving this; I must not play with my
digestive organs.”
She looked tigerishly at me, and
REGGIE said, “Don’t eat it, Mrs. BARKER.
Let's send it downstairs and have it
cooked properly.” I hated him.
“The servants are in bed,” I said.
“Leave it by all means, Mrs. BARKER.
I'll cook the Hamburg steak. Some
people,” I continued, turning sweetly
to Mr. BARKER, who was drinking cold
water to ease his tongue, “think a steak
should be served before it has lost its
delicate pink tinge; others when it has
turned a shade of delicate grey. Shall
we leave it pink or grey””
“We shall leave it anyhow, I expect,”
said REGGIE. “Look at your sleeve. It's
all in the fat.”
I ignored him —with one swift glance,
which Mr. BARKER intercepted.
* Oh, grey, by all means,” he ex-
claimed conciliatingly. “It will be
delicious grey, I am sure.”
“I don't think anyone can teach me
how to cook a steak,” cried Mrs. BARKER,
with sudden asperity. “I will tell you
when to take it off,” and with an insult-
ing air of superior knowledge she came
and leant over the chafing-dish. Next
moment she recoiled with a cry of pain,
and clapped her hand to her eye as a
Splutter of hot ſat shot up and hit her
in the face. At that REGGIE lost his
temper and strode towards his present.

ejaculated. When REGGIE speaks in

having any effect on the flexible flame.

was, in a way, successful, for it lifted
the spirit clean out of the lamp on to
the best tablecloth, where we finally
extinguished it with the best table-

“We must go home,” said Mrs. BARKER,
in an exhausted, suffering voice. “Damp

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSE N C E OF PAR LIAM E. N. T.
-
Extracted from THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
KOEPENICK AT WESTMINSTER ; A CAUTION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS POLICE.
After the brilliantly humorous exploit of the German “Captain” at Berlin, the House of Commons Police will have to use double extra
vigilance (not sparing even the authorities of the House); or some talented swindlers, neatly disguised as the Speaker and Serjeant-at-Arms,
will be absconding with the Mace in solemn procession.
House of Commons. Monday, Oct. 22.
-—Sittings resumed in both Houses to-
morrow. Promise of lively times. Lords
will forthwith tackle Education Bill.
AMPTHILL and HENEAGE early took off their
coats for the fight. A fortnight ago
they handed in a cloud of amendments.
If equal proportion of activity were
shown by other young Peers the 4th
clause won't be reached in Committee
before Christmas eve.
HENEAGE's wrath specially directed
against St. AUGUSTINE.
“Don’t remember any reference to
Cocytus in Obiter Dicta,” he said, feeling
his biceps. “But BIRRELL knows where
the river runs and how its waters are
kept at flood.
Cocytus named of lamentation loud,
Heard on the rueful stream.
When AMPTHILL and I walk him along
its banks he'd better bring with him a
big pocket-handkerchief. He'll want it.”
Curious how altered associations vary
manners. When, eleven years ago, I
knew HENEAGE in the Commons, he was
the mildest-mannered man that ever cut
the company of early-formed political
principles. Now, on this Education Bill,
he is almost bloodthirsty.
In the Commons there will be a big
gap on Front Opposition Bench where
of late DON José sat. His absence—tem-
porary, everyone hopes—will be lamented
on both sides. As PAM said, the House
of Commons likes a man who shows it
sport. Every prospect of wigs on the
green when DoN José was around. A
straight, hard hitter, he occasionally
raised howls of execration on benches
opposite and below Gangway to left of
SPEAKER's chair. But resentment not
lasting. Anger gave place to admiration
of the easy skill of splendid swordsman-
ship. For a while the tired warrior, his
helmet now a hive for bees, is con-
tent to look on from the Scaean Gate
whilst the battle rages on the familiar
plain.
“Very characteristic to use a tem-
porary discarded headgear as a hive,”
said the MEMBER FOR SARK, nothing if
not prosaic. “Bees sting, you know,
and they may yet come in useful."
Quite a crowd of Members looking
in at House this afternoon preparing for
the fray. Came across PRINCE ARTH!!!
in corridor flanking SPEARER's chair. In
beaming health, radiant spirits. Loºk
ing forward with keen delight to coming
conflict. Persistent rumour attributes

on Treasury Bench or in Downing Street.

SoME'ow or uther, 'ENERY Wilks,
although per'aps not perfect, can jener-
ally get along all rite wiv sich peeple as
'ave got somethink of golf inside them.
And that don't only mean good players.
I 'ave 'ad a certain ammount of regret-
tabul frickshun wiv one or two of our
lady members; but if there was more
about like Miss BARBRER SHERRITTON the
job of caddy would be easier and ples-
santer than wot it is.
She can play golf, and, wot's more,
she knows wen'er hattendint is doing
'is levil best to 'elp "er all 'e can. She
seemed to see from the fust that "ENERY
WILKs ment well, and she got into the
'abbit of 'aving 'im for 'er caddy wen-
ever possibul. Those ’oo are ackwainted
wiv 'im "oom I may call the leading
caddy of this club, don't need to be told
that she 'as never regretted 'er choise.
But the uther day, for the fust time,
I came near to regretting it meself. At
least I regretted that Miss SHERRITTON
'adn't picked on some hinfeerior lad for
that ercashun. The course was quite
disserted, and she told me rather mys-
teeriously to bring 'er clubs along to the
second tee—wich, I may say, is more
or less out of site of the club 'ouse. I
found 'er waitin' there, and to my 'orrified
amasement she was not alone. Standing
beside 'er, and sort of grumbling to
'isself, was the very largest bulldog that
I 'ave ever seen.
Of course, dogs is strickly forbidden
on the course; but, as is well known to
most offishuls, ladies is totilly reggard-
less of all rules. Miss SHERRITTON she
jest smiled at me in 'er own delitefull
fashun.
“Narsissus is coming rarnd wiv us
to-day,” she ses, briskly.
Well, of course, I touched my cap
respeckfull, and didn't say nuthink, but
I thort to meself that I could bear quite
komfortably to be parted from Narsissus.
'E was a sort of patchy form collour,
and the way 'is white teeth gleemed
when 'e yawned would 'ave guv some
peeple the cold shivers. And 'e seemed
to be allus yawning, like a sort of thrett.
Thank 'Evvin, I'm braver than most,
but someow I ain't altogevver a dog-
lover. I was bit once by a dog, which
totilly mistook my meening towards 'im
and 'ad three spare foot of chane 'idden
away which 'e made use of, and it as
sort of turned me agin the savage
creachures. But I'id my thorts,
Miss SHERRITTON started 'er practice
rarnd, and that dog 'e walked be ind
wiv me and the clubs, keeping step
jest like a soldier. I didn't want 'im
to pay me sich an attenshun. I could
'ave done wiv 'im in front quite well.
Rarnd 'is neck was a bewtifull blue
silk ribbing, and some'ow it seemed to
make 'im creweller looking than meer
leavver could 'ave done. 'E kep' on
grumbling to 'isself about somethink,
and 'e kep' on getting on my nerves
wuss and wuss. There was somethink
in 'is eye as 'e looked up at me that
almost lifted my 'air from my 'ead.

Toby AND PRINCE ARTHUR.
As a rule it's a perfessional plessure
to watch Miss SHERRITTON play. The fust
time I ever set eyes on 'er, she drove
'ard and low into an 'owling wind, then
took 'er brassey quite cool and grasefull
and bumped 'er ball on to the green.
And I know one or two men as wouldn't
'ave been on that green in two that day.
You wouldn't beleeve as she could do
it, for to look at 'er she's jest like a
fairy what's floated down on a soap
bubble. But on this ercashun my mind
was cleen distracted from 'er play. .
'Owever, all went fairly well until the
sixth 'ole. Then suddingly Narsissus
bounded forward, snapped up the ball
in 'is great mouth, and shook it like a
rat. And nuthink wouldn't perswade
'im to put it down for quite a wile.
“’E 'll 'ave to be punnished,” Miss
SHERRITTON says firmly. “But 'e's sich
a darlin' that I can't bear to 'urt 'im
meself, and so,” she ses, “ and so you'll
'ave to do it, 'ENERY.”
Wiv them dredfull words she pulled a
little whip out of 'er pocket and 'anded
it to me. I took it, but I felt as though
my knees was giving way beneaf me.
Narsissus 'e looked at the whip, and
then 'e looked at me, and 'e jest went
on grumbling.
“I suppose, Miss,” I ses rather trimu-
lous, but trying 'ard to speak jockewlar
like, “I suppose you 'aven't got is
mussel 'andy, which you could jest slip
on 'im fust?” I ses.
“No,” she ses brisk like, “I 'aven't.
Give 'im three smart cuts and get it
over,” she ses.
But someow I couldn't do it. I tried
'ard to make meself, but somethink
seemed to 'old back my 'and. I suppose
it was my yumanity, either for Narsissus
or for meself.
“Why, "ENERy, you're never fritened
of the poor darlin'!” Miss SHERRITTON
cries out, and she begun to larf as though
it was funny.
Well, it was better to be torn down and
mangelled than to be larfed at by 'er.
I 'arf closed my eyes and strook at
Narsissus, egspecting every moment to
feel 'is dred full fangs. But insted of
that I'erd a stifled yelp.
Narsissus was lying on 'is back wiv
'is four legs in the air, and dirrectly I
opened my eyes I reallised that I 'ad
mastered 'im. My strength seemed to
come back to me, and in the suddin
revulshun of my feelings I taught the
konquered creachure 'ow to beyave
'isself on a golf course, until Miss
SherriTTON called to me to stop.
I am glad to say that 'is manner was
quite respeckfull, even grovelling, for
the rest of the rarnd. It jest shows
you, I suppose, what the will of a cool,
determined yumin being can do wiv
the most feerocious monster.

DEVILRY IN BLACK AND RED.
IN La Tosca PUCCINI had so moving a
tragedy “made to his hand " that his own
part in it, if he knew his business, was
bound to be a subordinate one. He had
to make music, scarcely more than inci-
dental, which should illustrate the drama
without retarding its action. This he
h's achieved with astonishing discre-
tion. In the great Second Act—for
which WAGNER would have wanted at
least a week's cycle –there seems to be
scarce ten minutes' worth of vocal score;
for the rest, the music of the orchestra,
very safe here in the hands of Signor
MUGNONE, is less an interpretation (for
none is needed) than an audible echo of
emotions too swift and tense for utterance.
I know no opera in which the rival arts
are more perfectly adjusted. And I can
imagine no better trio for the rendering
of La Tosca, than GIACHETTI, SAMMARCO,
and ZENATELL0. Indulgence was asked
for the Signora; but, though it was
evident that ill-health affected her voice
when any strain had to be put upon it,
yet in the softer passages, such as the
lovely phrase
“Non ti par che le cose
Aspettan tutte innamorate il sole?”
she had lost none of her charm; while
her acting throughout was frankly
superb. So it would seem, after all, that
the possession of a voice need not be
an absolute bar to dramatic excellence.
Signor SAMMARCO played the black devil
Scarpia with a most admirable tact,
and in the part of Cavaradossi Signor
ZENATELLo, whose singing of
“O dolci mani mansuete e pure,”
and indeed of all the delicious music of
the Third Act, was perfect, acted with
his accustomed intelligence and sincerity.
“Ecco un artista " " as Tosca justly says.
If I might permit myself to pass any
captious comment upon so fine a per-
formance, I should have a word to say
about Cavaradossi's costume in the First
Act. I am not quite sure how I should get
myself up if #. painting a portrait
of the Magdalen inside a church a
hundred years ago; but I know I should

And the dreadful property picture! so
insulting to the repentant Magdalen, and
more than insulting, I am sure (though
I never set eyes on her), to the fair
Attavanti who unconsciously sat for
it. Certainly there seemed no sort of
warrant for Tosca's jealousy, and for
her repeated demand—Falle gli occhi
meri. If anybody needed a pair of black
eyes it was the man who was originally
responsible for this preposterous daub.

ante. Madame MELBA was scarcely at
her best best, and Signor SCANDIANI, as
Mephistopheles, sacrificed articulation in
the effort to be sonorous. Also he was
a bit stiff in the facial muscles, and
missed that ingratiating air of bonhomie
which one has come to expect of Gounod's
red devil. The honours of the evening
fell on Signor ZENATELLo's head, already
crowded with laurels, and now sur-
mounted by a fascinating ostrich feather.
I have just ventured to pass a criticism
on his clothes in La Tosca, and I will
say further that in Faust I did not care
for the two little tassels which sprouted
from his high boots above the ankle, and
looked too much like straw escaping
from stuffed calves. But it is only fair
to add that in the Second Act I could
well understand the collapse of Mar-
gherita, so seductive was |. sky-blue

The home-come warriors sang their
“Petit Soldat" chorus with a very
satisfying lustiness. Two-deep they
made a solid human wall across the
stage; in this case an excellent device,
since it concealed all but the flags and
spears of their comrades who marched
across at the back of the stage; so that
a handful of men were able to simulate
myriads as they passed and repassed
without recognition. All the same, the
management of the Autumn Season has
perhaps been a touch too generous with
its men's choruses in the matter of
numbers. They are apt to get so
blocked that they have to trample on
one another's feet to get a glimpse of
the conductor. It seems an ungrateful
thing to say, but I should have them
decimated. +
LITERARY NOTES.
It is understood that a large portion
of the Apocrypha, the authorship of
which has hitherto been a matter of
grave speculation, was in reality written
by Mr. A. C. BENSON, whose name is to
be placed on the title-page of the new
edition, to which he will contribute a
characteristic preface.
We understand that Madame ThéRKSE
HUMBERT, as the result of exhaustive
inquiries, has discovered that the mys-
terious CRAwford Brothers were none
other than Mr. A. C. BENSON, who is now
engaged on a work of sombre thought-
fulness, entitled At a Safe Distance.
It transpires that researchers into the
mysteries of SHAKSPEARE's plays have for
many years been on the wrong scent.
It was not BACON who wrote them, but
Mr. A. C. BENSON, a younger brother of
the poet's boon-companion who now lies
in Westminster Abbey beneath a slab
bearing the simple words: “O Rare

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
LoRD RoseBERY is endowed with two gifts rarely found in
the possession of one man. Supreme as a public speaker,
he is in the first rank among living writers. His last
essay, Lord Randolph Churchill (ARTHUR HUMPHREYs), is, in
the matter of literary style, comparable with his mono-
graph on Pitt, and praise can sound no higher note.
Shortly after Lord RANDolph's death his mother asked Lord
RosBBERY to “write something about him.” Having read
the son's biography of his father, which he justly ranks
“among the first dozen, perhaps the first half-dozen, in the
language,” he recalls the request and fulfils it. He dis-
covers the secret of Lord RANDOLPH's failure to achieve per-
manent success in the fact that he lived in a false position.
“A thorough convinced Radical of the old type,” he found
himself yoked with the MARSHALL-AND-SNELGROVES of a Tory
Cabinet presided over by Lord SALISBURY. This inevitably
led to ructions, culminating in one that finally severed his
connection with official life. In a sentence, Lord RosłBERY
happily describes him as “half-aristocrat, half-Bohemian.”
In another passage that might well serve for epitaph he
writes, “He was human, eminently human ; full of faults, as
he himself well knew, but not base or unpardonable faults;
pugnacious, outrageous, fitful, petulant, but eminently lovable
and winning.” The last time Lord RosebERY saw his old
friend was at dinner at the Duchess of MARLBOROUGH’s house
in Grosvenor Square, his brother-in-law, Lord TWEEDMoUTH,
the only other guest. “The next day he gave a farewell
dinner to his friends, and the next he set out with his wife
on a voyage round the world in a desperate hunt for health.”
I was at the farewell dinner, and over the waste of time
recall the uncanny feeling that possessed me throughout it
that the hospitable table was loaded with funeral baked
meats. I never saw our host again. The dinner was given
in July, 1894. In the following January, home from his
º journey, he was carried into his mother's house
to die.

Mr. R. W. CHAMBERs's life-work is an epic-romance of the
American War of Independence. His efforts to discredit
the honour of British arms have no doubt had a wide success
among the American youth of to-day, lending noble assist-
ance to the work of local history primers in fostering whatever
bitterness of feeling still survives from that deplorable family
quarrel in which the sympathies of Englishmen were never
more than half-heartedly engaged. But at times Mr. CHAMBERs
seeks relief from the sterner claims of patriotism and indulges
in a large frolic. It was in one of these lighter interludes
that he published In Search of the Unknown, and now he
gives us Iole, by the same publisher, CoNSTABLE. The title
is arbitrary; for Iole is but the name of one of an indis-
tinguishable family of American girls, brought up in pyjamas
and a state of outdoor innocence coloured by Hellenic ideals.
Their father, a fat old hypocrite, apparently absorbed in the
unworldly pursuit of aestheticism, yet with an instinctive
flair for eligible sons-in-law, eventually brings his bevy of
beauties to New York, where their childlike candour puts
them in the way of several pleasant adventures. As an
extravagance, the joke is good enough for a while, but
becomes a little tedious through the author's reiteration of
phrases and episodes. There is little attempt at construction,
and the end is tame and amateurish.
Mr. DESMOND Coke is to be congratulated on the restraint
he shows in his 'Varsity story, The Comedy of Age (CHAPMAN
AND HALL). Heroics and love are kept out with a firm hand.
His hero is the ordinary undergraduate, fairly good at games,
pleasant, popular, but (like the majority of undergraduates,
not a blue. This may be a disappointment to some, but they
can console themselves with the thought that ERNAN LANE was
probably a twelfth man. There are really two heroes to Mr.
CoRE's book: LANE, the undergraduate, and RADFord, the
tutor. RADFord is about sixty, and this is the story of his
tragic attempt to realise the ideals of youth as LANE saw
them. Mr. Coke has done it very well indeed. I wonder if
at any time it occurred to him to give LANE's widowed mother
to RADFORD as a consolation prize. If so, he is yet again to be
congratulated on his restraint.

Mr. ANDREW LANG, casting about for a colour for his new

earlier volumes of this wonderful and wholly delightful

have the old perennial charm. I predict much squeezing

(To be continued.)
THE WISE WALKER.
[By way of supplement to
Mr. Montagu HolbriN's interest-
ing article on Walking in Fry's
Magazine, Mr. Punch has received
the following valuable paper from
another old Master of the Pedes-
trian Art, Sir REMBRANDT KENNEDY,
Bart.]
THE wise walker will first
consider his boots, and he
will consider them and look
after them with maternal soli-
citude as long as they are in
use. Some walkers even go
so far as to treasure their
old boots, not merely as
missiles, but as links with
the past. But this is to carry
sentimentalism too far. The
plan that many wise walkers
adopt when their boots have
fallen into decrepitude is to
leave them overnight on the
doorstep. If they survive this
ordeal the only thing to be
done is to export them to
Bayswater to Liverpool Street
and back again for nothing; but you
must be careful not to board the same
bus twice.
Although, as you will see by turning
again to the fourth chapter and reading
it carefully, there is no real theatrical
representation that is free in London,
there is something equally good, and
that is Mr. Plowden's Court. From
time to time managers have put on
farces and comedies that have caused a
certain amount of merriment—from Our
Boys to Charley's Aunt-but their efforts
have been trifling compared with those
example, that we take a cab. But this
will not, of course, hold water. As a
matter of fact we do nothing of the
sort: the cab takes us. All that we
can take is the cabman's number, but
if we are wise we shall do that only if
he is not looking. A cabman who
knows that his fare is taking his
number is no company for a quiet un-
obtrusive visitor from the country who
dislikes to be stared at.
We will now enter the Court, which
you will notice is ventilated entirely by
gusts of mirth and lighted by laughing
gas, Observe the faces of the constables
* Chicago.
To arrive at the right sort of boots wo
must begin by rigorously eliminating
the wrong forms of footwear. Some
men, it is true, can walk in any kind
of boot - e.g., persons with cork legs,
but we are here dealing with normal
pedestrians.
For town wear, again, it is only right
to show some regard for the conventions
of Society. Thus, while the pampooties
of untanned cowhide used by the Arran
Islanders are excellently adapted for
those rocky shores, they look a trifle
outrés in Piccadilly. Again, though
variety is desirable, I should not recom-

mend wise walkers to wear boots on the
wrong feet unless in cases of emergency,
e.g. when lost in the bush, by way of
counteracting the natural tendency of
the right foot to bear too much to the
left, and rice rersi. The ideal boot
should be at once strong and roomy,
flexible yet not flabby. It should also
bear some resemblance to the foot of
the wearer, though I admit that in the
case of persons possessed of cubic feet
it is not always easy to establish this
relationship. For the man who walks
across country in the winter it is well
to see that his boots are kept water-
tight. Water, as PINDAR said, is the best
of good things, but in a boot as on the
rain it is out of place. A little calves-
feet jelly smeared round the seams will
help to keep the wet at bay, and a pair
of boot-trees will save their cost in no
time, , for boots, unlike the opossum,
will last much longer when properly
treed, in which case, paradoxical as it
may appear, you cannot see the trees
for the boots.
In choosing boots, again, be sure to
make certain that they are not shorter
than your foot, otherwise it will be
-
impossible to wear them without cutting
off the toes, either of the boot or the
foot, preferably the former; but in
either case the results are unsatisfac-
tory.
The wise walker will not only exercise
discretion in the choice of his boots, but
in the care of his feet. Russian tallow
is a splendid emollient, but it is neces-
sary to see that it is really pure, for
some kinds have lime added to them
which is the reverse of salubrious.
Blisters are the walker's bogey, but
they can easily be dealt with by filling
the boot with laudanum, which will
deaden the pain most effectively.
Whether to carry a stick or not is a
moot point, and if a man is accustomed
to carry one there is no harm in it. In
that case a stick of an unobtrusive
pattern is best (see diagram).
Finally, let me conclude by a few
practical tips which wise walkers will
do well to act upon.
1. For walking the Channel, waders
are indispensable if you wish to keep
your legs dry.
2. In order to save your heels when
going down hill, the best plan is to
walk backwards, holding a mirror in
your hand so as to avoid collisions.
3. To increase your pace the best
plan is to hold a 56-lb. weight at arms'
length. The effect of this is, of course,
to upset the usual centre of gravity and
throw the body forward. It is difficult
to explain without going into trans-
cendental dynamics, but an appreciable
increase in speed will be experienced
at once. If the speed attained be too
great, the wise walker will be well
advised to be content with a 28-lb.
weight.
4. To avoid monotony, there is no
better plan than to adopt the German
army mixed step for forced marches,
which consists of two steps at the trot
and three at a walking pace, followed
by a hop, skip and a jump.

A TEST FOR MUNICIPAL WOTERS.
It has been urged against the rate-
payers of London that they are woefully
apathetic about municipal affairs, and
that this is due to ignorance. If this is
truly the case it is evident that instruc-
tion in all subjects appertaining to
parochial affairs should be given to
duly qualified voters before the next
election, possibly by municipally en-
dowed lecturers. As this, however,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
-
BRIEF NEWS IS NOW OUR PORTION.
(A fact which, if our correspondent is to be
beliered, accounts for the alarming increase
in lunacy.)
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-- As I have on
several occasions purchased a copy of
your valuable paper, I have not the
slightest hesitation in asking you to
devote a couple of columns or so to the
ventilation of a little grievance of mine.
I am, Sir, of a somewhat inquisitive
disposition; and the result is that a
ten minutes' perusal of a halfpenny
“Daily" or a penny “Weekly’’ drives
me to the verge of frenzy. It is the
present mania for “snappiness” that
is responsible for this unhappy state of
affairs. -
Under the heading “News in a Nut-
shell,” or “Items in Brief,” I am given
just enough information to whet my
curiosity, and am left to fill in the sequel
for myself. Take, for example, the
following “paragraph,” culled from a
weekly newspaper: “Mr. H., a solicitor,
of I---, was thrown out of bed by an
explosion of gas at his house.”
Only that, and nothing more. No
word as to whether Mr. H. landed in
his bath, or whether he went out through
the window and overturned a passing
policeman.
Believe me, Sir, I have, since I read
this item of news, been in a con-
tinual state of mental turmoil. I have
pictured Mr. H. scrambling back into
bed again; I have imagined him accept-
ing the inevitable, making his toilet,
and hastening downstairs to kick the
gas meter. I have had visions of an
infuriated Mr. H., with his head and
shoulders driven through the ceiling,
making frantic efforts to release himself;
of a somnolent Mr. H. seated on the top
of the wardrobe and wondering how the
(leuce he got there; of a terrified Mr. H.
rushing wildly into the street and bellow-
ing “Earthquake!”
If only I had known Mr. H.'s address,
I should, long ere this, have wired him
for full particulars. Not knowing it, I
am almost crazed by the crowd of con-
jectures which force themselves upon me.
Here is another fragment drawn from
a similar source:
“An eight hours' fishing competition,
open only to ladies, has taken place at
Deal.” This, at first blush, appears to
be fairly innocent and straightforward,
but a closer examination shows that it
has been put together with diabolical
ingenuity. You will observe, Sir, that
no information is forthcoming as to what
the ladies were fishing for. They may,
it is true, have been fishing for fish, but,
on the other hand, they may have been
fishing for compliments. They may
even have been fishing for husbands,
and in that case the failure to say so is
-
positively criminal. With competitions
of this nature coming into vogue at
Deal, every bachelor in the country
ought to be duly warmed, lest he stray
by accident into the town at a moment
when the local conditions are full of
danger. Then again, you will note the
ominous reticence as to results. This
is surely an instance of misplaced
gallantry. Assuming, for the sake of
argument, that the contest was of the
genuinely piscatorial order, I can only
conclude that the catch announted to
nil, and that the scribe, in his anxiety
to be both truthful and polite, got over
the difficulty by preserving a discreet
silence. This being so, I find myself
in the throes of a bewildering breakfast-
table problem. If a ladies of Deal fish
for eight hours without catching so
much as a single sprat, how long will
it take y Deal boatmen to secure a
draught of whales? Up to the present
I have not been able to arrive at a
solution, but I am still wrestling.
One more illustration, and I have
finished.
“The last hoppers' train run by the
South Eastern and Chatham Railway,”
remarked a Radical morning paper
recently, “arrived at London Bridge
early Saturday morning.” Now what I
want to know, Mr. Punch, is—Whe N DID
This TRAIN START 2. It is all very well to
tell me that it “arrived,” but that is a
mere bagatelle as compared with the
duration of its journey. It may have
been dribbling through Kent for weeks
and weeks; or it may have been a fast
train, a dashing, fire-eating dragon of a
train, gobbling up the Kentish miles at
the rate of fourteen or fifteen per hour.
Maybe it made so quick a run that the
writer who chronicled its arrival feared
to go into figures, lest he should be
scoffed at by a sceptical public. This,
however, need not have prevented him
from hinting delicately at the record
nature of the voyage. A statement to
the effect that “none of the hoppers had
died of old age en route,” or that “the
hoppers still retained the sunburnt
appearance which they had acquired
whilst hopping,” would have been quite
sufficient. In the absence of any such
illuminating remark, I am left in a state
of hideous uncertainty. A little more
of this sort of thing, and leason, which
is now tottering upon its throne, will
slither off it altogether.
Aid me, Mr. Punch ; aid me to start a
crusade against this growing practice
of setting problems which, in time, will
bring about the display of the legend,
“House full,” outside every lunatic
asylum in the country'

WE are glad to hear of Messrs.
KYNOCH's proposed metric experiment.
The danger of our present confusing
system is strikingly exemplified by the
fact that a certain firm of soap-makers
were recently under the impression that
15 oz. make 1 lb.
The interest taken in the Soap
Question by all sections of the popula-
tion is remarkable. For instance, there
has always been a slight boycott of soap
by small boys, and a proposal that it
shall be taboo altogether has been
received with unbounded enthusiasm in
juvenile circles.
It is now asserted that the Soap Trust
and the Beef Trust intend to work
together to control fats, and that it is
quite possible that Mr. HALDANE will
urge the Government to take steps
to prevent this interference with the
liberty of individuals in the matter of
expansion. - - - -
The L.C.C. is so much inclined, at
times, to be uppish, that the proposal
that women should be allowed to sit on
the new Council gives fairly general
satisfaction. -
Mrs. LAWRENCE, speaking at the
Holborn Town Hall, declared that the
Suffragettes “had a great many things
up their sleeve.” We had always won-
dered what it was that gave some of
them such an air of being badly dressed.
Mr. EUSTACE MILEs has expressed him-
self as anxious to discover a more satis-
factory name than “Vegetarian" or
“Fruitarian '' for his dietetic followers,
and an ill-bred fellow writes to ask us
what is wrong with “Crank” 2
The Rev. J. S. LONGION has been
complaining at the Llandaff Diocesan
Conference that the clergy do not take
a sufficient interest in sport. We think
that this accusation is somewhat unfair.
We know a number of curates who will
openly assist at a game of marbles; and
ping-pong has no more devoted adherents.
The PRIME MINISTER’s Peace and Good-
will feeling continues to extend. He
has now informed the Women's Social
and Political Union that it is quite
impossible for the Government to make
themselves responsible for any further
controversial measures.
The Sydney Bulletin has been making
fun of what it calls “The Brixton

ally exists a Brixton Empire—which is,

We are relieved to learn from The Boot

Last week's Truth contains an inter-
esting statement. “Knowsley Park,
which is richly wooded,” says our con-
temporary, “comprises 2500 acres, and
contains a lake of 90 acres. It is well
stocked with red and fallow deer.” We
should have thought it incredible that
these animals could exist in water were
it not for HoRACE's account of the Flood,
and for the fact that Truth itself is often
found at the bottom of a well.
Clergymen all over the country are
greatly relieved at the reported decision
of the Oxfordshire Education Committee

been seriously impaired.

[An American doctor declares that “inability to relax" is the

“slacking.”]
MEN are perturbed spirits, and their one and fierce delight

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracter. From THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, Oct. 23.
—If the shade of Joseph Gillis BIGGAR
re-visits the glimpses of the gas-lit roof
of the House of Commons, his imitation
sealskin waistcoat must this afternoon
have heaved with sigh of regret at the
decadence of the assembly. Thirty-one
years ago last April Joey B. enjoyed one
of his most successful diversions. It
was a Wednesday afternoon. HARRY
CHAPLIN had secured it for motion touch-
ing question of breed of horses. A great
occasion ; it was known that the SQUIRE
of BLANKNEY, at the time still
in residence at the family
Hall, meant to rise to it. The
House was crowded in degree
rare on Wednesday after-
noons. From the Peers' Gal-
lery looked down his present
MAJESTY, then Prince of WALEs,
the centre of a galaxy of
noble Lords whose faces were
familiar at Epsom and New-
market. In the Diplomatic
Gallery sat the representative
of the German EMPEROR.
HARRY CHAPLIN rose from a
corner seat below the Gang-
way, visibly swelling with
complacency. Here at last
was opportunity of displaying
before a worthy audience those
gifts of sonorous eloquence
envied by Dizzy himself.
Having fixed his eyeglass, he
paused a moment surveying
the listening Senate. Then,
striking himself lightly on his
portly chest, he remarked,
“Mr. SPEARER.”
Swift came response from ,
unexpected quarter. Joseph
Gillis was on his feet, waving
long lean arm towards the
Chair as if he were hailing a
bus.
“Mr. SPEAKER,” cried a
shrill voice, “I believe there are strangers
in the House.” -
Observe the courteous deference of this
way of putting it. He did not bluntly
assert a fact that might be obnoxious to
some hon. Members—Mr. Chaplin, for
example. He merely mentioned his
impression, throwing on the SPEAKER the
responsibility of determining the case
and taking action accordingly.
In those good old days there was no
appeal against individual eccentricity.
On a Member, howsoever insignificant,
taking note of the presence of strangers,
ºut they must go. Accordingly, at Mr.
BIGGAR's bidding, the heir to the Throne,
the German Ambassador, and a few
belied Earls were bundled forth with
Autres temps, autres mours. To-day,
on House resuming sittings for Autumn
Session, discovery was made of presence
of strangers on benches behind SPEAKER's
Chair. They were heads of State Depart-
ments, private secretaries of Ministers,
heretofore accommodated under Gallery.
LULU, with the energy and enterprise
of a new broom, had swept them from
one end of House to t'other.

seared. All very well for young Members
in their first Parliament to suffer dumbly

year, steeped with reverence for the
sacred things of Parliament, case
different. WATSON just the sort of
man who, had he represented West
Derby at the time, would have stood up
against CROMwFLL when he spoke dis-
respectfully of the Mace. Now he raised
the cry of “Privilege ' " Moved for
Select Committee to inquire into the
affair, hinting that, pending investi-
gation, it would be as well if the
First Commissioner of Works were
manacled and detained in the Clock
Tower on dietary of bread and water.
SPEAKER declined to recognize breach
of privilege, but, ever ready to oblige,
hinted at existence of a Standing
Order dealing with case of strangers
presence of mind straightway spied
strangers.
It was at this juncture that JoEY B.,
assuming his spiritual presence, would
be conscious of that ruffling of the yellow
fur of his waistcoat conjectured above. At
a nod from him the galleries were cleared.
Now, under new Rules, a degenerate
House meekly went through process of
division, the proposal that strangers
should withdraw being negatived by
267 votes to 61.
Business done. Both Houses reas-
semble for Autumn Session.
Wednesday night.-With that sudden-
in the House. CLAUDE HAY with great
ness and unexpectedness that marks the
course of events in House of
Commons, a nice question
sprung upon it just now. In
Committee on Plural Voting
Bill. LULU, in charge of
measure, risen to speak on
Amendment. Up gat A. S.
Wilson (only one S., please,
Mr. Printer) and spied stran-
gers. Regarded as a joke,
this repetition a little heavy.
Trotted out yesterday. No
reason why it should not flash
forth again to-morrow and on
succeeding days when the
clerks and private secretaries
show themselves in the pew
behind the SPEAKER's chair.
CHAIRMAN pleaded question
was settled by vote taken on
previous day. Then CARSON's
fine intellect, trained in law
courts on both sides of Chan-
nel, asserted itself.
“May I say, Mr. CHAIRMAN,
that I spy different strangers
from those present yester-
day?” -
Overcome by difficulty here
presented, the CHAIRMAN
yielded. House cleared for
division. In interval someone
remembered CARSON wasn't
here yesterday. How then
could he make the nice dis-
tinction he had set forth with such
effect? Harassed CHAIRMAN, confronted
by this fresh dilemma, feebly replied
that “when the right hon. gentleman
said he saw different strangers, he must
have seen them.”
CARs6N himself discreetly said nothing,
and there matter left. But mystery
remains. CARSON did not deny the soft
impeachment of his absence yesterday.
That being so, how could he to-day spy
strangers different from those he didn't
spy yesterday ?
This question occupied attention of
Mother of Parliaments to exclusion of
such minor matters as Plural Voting, a
Bill prohibiting this privilege being the
ostensible business of the day.
Business done.—The great CARSON

House of Commons, Friday night.--
Not much gaiety yet developed in still
young Parliament. Such as it be it is
eclipsed by death of Colonel SAUNDERSON.
Like some other institutions of elder
Parliaments (including PRINCE ARTHUR)
he was not at home in the transmogrified
House. He addressed it once or twice
in earlier part of Session. Fffect akin to
that of skilful musician, his harp broken,
attempting to recapture the old charm
by touch of unfamiliar strings. Next
Session, the Home IRule question to the
fore, the Colonel would doubtless have
been himself again.
He was, intellectually and physically,
in every fibre a fighting man. But he
never hit below the belt. Possibly
there was exception in the case of the
still anonymous Nationalist whom he
encountered in the free fight that surged
in Committee on the last stage of
Gladstone's Bill of 1893. Naturally some
Here was a
fellow-countryman, presumably an advo-
cate of Home Rule, fortuitously projected
over his shoulder on to his knce and
requiring straightway to be pommelled.
As a rule, otherwise invariable, the
Colonel hit hard but struck fair. No
one said bitterer things of his Nation-
alist brethren than he. Perhaps no
one, certainly none on their own side,
was more highly esteemed. His per-
sonal popularity extended through every
section of parties. Unsought, un-
purchased, the tribute was the more
precious.
Handicapped by illness, SAUNDERSON
was past his Parliamentary prime.
That was reached in the Parliament of
1892, when he hilariously, with back
to wall, fought the Home Rule Bill.
Many of his flashes of humour, shining
in debate, illumine the memory. One of
many I recall in private conversation.
During the Home Rule debate a friend,
dwelling on the opportunities it pro-
vided for Irishmen to come to the front
in national affairs, said :
“You are sure to come to the top of
the tree.”
“Yes,” retorted SAUNDERSON, with
grim smile; “hauled up by a rope
round my neck.”
We shall not look upon the Colonel's
like again. He was a man apart, an
evolution of the richly endowed Irish
character, of which at his grave the
mould was broken.
Business done.- In
Plural Voting Bill.
Committee on
THE AMAZING AMAZONS.
HERE's the Rime of the Ten Pioneers,
Who, braving all masculine jeers,
In a dare-devil manner
Uplifted their banner
And went for the Commons and Peers!
But alas for these claimants to fame!
In spite of their chorus of “Shame!"
A posse of bobbies
l{ushed out from the Lobbies
And ruthlessly closured the game.
‘Twas a moral defeat of brute force
By reformers of ready resource,
For their cries and their capers
Loomed large in the papers,
And martyrs want notice, of course!
Next morn, before Judge HoRACE SMITH,
They gave a fresh taste of their pith;
They flouted the cadi
And screeched, did each lady,
And treated the Law as a myth !
Peace doubtless will reign for a space
In the homes which these heroines grace'
Though the fines were not heavy,
They trooped in a bevy
To jail with a jubilant face.
But the rest of the sex, we are told,
Only laugh, when they should have
condoled ;
So it seems a bit silly
To go and eat skilly,
And earn the repute of a Scold!

POUDRE DE JALOUSIE
OR, THE PowDER PLot.
CoMPARISONs between CILEA's Adriana
Lecouvreur and PUCCINI's Tosca may be
odious, but they are natural. Each of
the two operas is a very modern Italian
setting of a fairly modern French tragedy
with a French theme. But in Tosca
(much the shorter opera) the action is
more swift and direct, the scheme less
complex, its climax more inevitable.
In Adriana Lecouvreur it is difficult,
unless one knows the original play, to
follow all the intricacies of the plot;
and one feels that the tragedy might
easily have been avoided if Maurizio,
whose absence is never satisfactorily
explained, had turned up a little earlier.
Here again in the last scene—
in Adriana's house (not of
course to be confused with
Hadrian's Villa)—we have the
natural sequence of things
delayed as if with the pure
object of letting us gloat over
the lady's agony. It is not
till she has exhibited quite a
long series of spasms that
Maurizio, who has been sup-
porting her shattered form,
observes that there is any-
thing unusual in her condi-
tion. He then makes the
following tardy comment:-
Che? tu tremi ... trascolori.
In this last word the facts,
of course, are misrepresented,
for she had started the scene
with a complexion of unearthly
pallor which did not admit of
variation. _*
There is nothing perhaps
in Adriana to equal the charm of the
love-interludes in Tosca, but in the
overture to the Fourth Act there are
passages of exquisite beauty. One traces
in them a strong resemblance to the
music of another of Puccini's works—-
Madama Butterfly; CilkA's opera being
the earlier of the two.
* Signora GIACHETTI again acted with
extraordinary dramatic force. Her be-
haviour was just what one always expects
in a person who has inhaled the fumes
of a deadly powder concealed in a bunch
of violets. I can't think where she
gets her experience in the art of being
poisoned. Signor SAMMARCO played
Michonnet with the humble devotion
of a faithful dog. There is no better
craftsman on the operatic stage. Signor
ZENATELLO had a rather vague and
thankless part. Maurizio's profound
admiration for his own exploits and
for the splendour of the name which
he eventually consents to confer upon
his lover tended to alienate our sym-
pathies. Yet we had all felt keenly
for him in the embarrassment which
he suffered from the advances of the
Principessa di Bouillon, played by the
handsome Signora DE CISNEROS, who
possesses some poignant contralto notes.
She was so tall and overwhelming that
one's heart went out to the medium-sized
hero (whose affections were engaged
elsewhere) in his obvious reluctance to
being smothered by her embrace.
Signor MUGNONE, who conducted, en-
joyed several well-earned ovations. He
has a fixed formula of action in acknow-
ledging these tributes to his genius. !
Uniting with one hand the fingers of
the artistes on each side of him, he
thrusts forward his remaining hand
in the direction of the orchestra and
waves it solemnly to and fro; with what

[October 31, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Listener's Lure is quite one of the nicest books that
Mr. E. W. LUCAS has published with Messrs. METHUEN during
the past few weeks. The epistolary way is, perhaps, the
way of least resistance for the writer of a tale; but that
doesn't matter so long as the reader's course is equally smooth.
At first I confess (if Mr. EDMUND GossE, of The Daily Mail,
will pardon my use of the first person) that the number of
characters employed in this oblique method of contributing
to the story made me feel as if I had contracted a squint.
But I soon found my way about the book, and lost no time
in being fascinated by the author's humanity. Mr. LUCAS's
mind is a storehouse of fancies, new and old ; most are new,
but all are fresh with the charm of his sensitive humour.
And then, in letters you can write so much that has no sort
of bearing on anything in particular: delightful stories a
propos de bottes, casual criticisms of men and manners,
incidental self-exposures, not permitted to the living voice.
Indeed, if Lynn Harberton, for one, had said aloud all the
things that he wrote I might have called him a bit of a prig.
Not, of course, in Mr. LUCAS's hearing, for fear that he might
retort by calling me a University man, and I should have no
answer to this shattering charge.
Listener's Lure is simple in design; it devotes itself to
sentiment and character rather than action ; yet when we
reach, late in the book, the solitary event (Edith Graham's
engagement to Harberton the wrong man) in which our
interest, amid many diversions, has been centred, the charm
is over. Nevertheless I nurse the sanguine hope that here,
in this book of letters, we have the half-way house between
Monologue and Romance; where the “Wanderer” on many
high-ways and by-ways may rest and take courage before he
adventures up the difficult heights. Meanwhile, being more
than ever impressed by the worth of a good listener, I hang
upon Mr. LUCAS's lips and am all ear; trusting, if only in this
negative way, to win his fastidious approval.
Cngland of the good old coaching days, when the PRINCE
REGENT called himself the father of his people, and wheat
was eighty shillings a quarter, was not a very merrie England.
But the whole country was infinitely happier than the un-
fortunate trio who were the owners of the Running Horse
Inn (MAC MILIAN). The woes of Job or of the lady who was
courted by Auld Robin Gray were trivial compared to the
sorrows of John of the inn and Bess his wife, and George
his long-lost brother, who returned from the wars on the day
of honest John's marriage to the girl he (George) had left behind
him. Customers deserted the inn ; the bank which held their
savings broke; John shot his father-in-law by mistake, and
George, after trying to run away with Bess, was hanged for
the murder under the eyes of repentant John, who arrived
at the scaffold just in time to be too late, and found on his
return home that Bess had fallen over a cliff. There's
tragedy for you! But, my nable ! (to use poor John's favourite
oath), a little less of it, prithee, next time you take up your
pen, Mr. A. T. SHEPPARI), for you have a pretty gift of
writing, an it were turned to a less harrowing theme.
When Mr. Dorgi. As SLADEN undertakes to describe a town,
an island, or a province, he does it thoroughly. His latest
effort has Carthage and Tunis (HUTCHINSON) for its object.
For weeks and months he besieged these historic places
with inquiry, ransacking their stores ancient and modern
Some writers of travel-books trot through a country, ride
round a town, straightway sit down and write a volume
of observation and suggestions. Experientia docet. Mr.
SLADEN's siege of the metropolis of the Orient was conducted
in due form of parallels. He makes minute study of the
classic historians of Carthage in her days of empire. Begin-
ning with Dido, he goes on to quote APPIAN's graphic account
of the destruction of the town and its fortresses. He roots
up the Arabian geographer EL EDRisi, who visited the city
in the twelfth century, when its amphitheatre still stood.
This is well done, since there is nothing left of Carthage
(above ground) but history. The visitor, or the stay-at-home
content to regard it from afar, will find in the first of these
two bulky volumes all that is known of a fascinating wreck
of early empire. Mr. SLADEN, who, not to speak of finding
sermons in stones, is amiably disposed to discover good
in everything, touches but lightly on an eye-searing modern
structure on the sacred soil. Speaking of the cathedral
erected thirty years ago by the pious efforts of Cardinal
LAVIGERIE on the site of the Temple of the Capitoline Jove,
he mildly remarks: “You are vexed that the cathedral
should occupy so much of the hill of Carthage.” I was
indeed. It is impossible from any point of view to avoid
this white monstrosity, which vulgarises hill and bay and
Carthage. Looking on it one wishes that CATO were still alive.
“Delenda " is nothing to what he would have said on behold-
ing it. Passing on from dead Carthage to living Tunis, Mr.
SLADEN, a lively instructive guide, lingers long in the en-
chanting bazaar, a rare span of Eastern life, accessible from
London in something like two days. The text, admirably
written throughout, is illustrated with six maps and more
than three-score illustrations, some in colours.
HELEN MATHERs' Tally Ho,
Published by METHUEN (Self & Co.),

That is, in brief, the groundwork which
The author sets her to enrich,
Adding, like a smooth veneer,
A first-class sporting atmosphere
Which, though it isn't Jorrocks, still
Displays indubitable skill.
But this, though good, is not the thing
That makes the book worth noticing :
Its persons show, it seems to me,
Exceptional vivacity ;
Indeed, the lady Sam, for one,
Beats all Miss MATHERs yet has done.
Mr. LEwis MELVILLE's Victorian Norelists (CoNSTABLE & Co.)
is very sketchy, but if it serves to send readers to the works of
the writers it appraises it will serve. To find Douglas JERROLD
among novelists is something of a surprise—his novels were
not his best work; and the absence of GEORGE ELIOT, CHARLES
LEVER and CHARLOTTE BRONTÉ impairs the value of a book
which is thorough enough otherwise to begin with LYTION
and close with WILLIAM BLACK. In the chapter on SHERIDAN
LE FANU I should have liked to see some reference to the first
draft of Uncle Silas, in his little-known but very admirable
collection of short stories called The Purcell Papers.
The Tribune, in a review of Q's Sir John Constantine,
quotes the author as saying, “Here is interred the soul of the
Bachelor Q.” ; and then adds: “We will not say Requiescal
in pacem.” That is quite right of The Tribune. Requiescal
in pacem ought never to be said of anybody, living or
dead.

NATURE STUDIES.
My RAzor.
Amongst the dear dead days of my long ago no day stands
out in my mind with a greater distinctness than that of my
first shave. It was a dark and dismal day of November rain,
and as I walked along Piccadilly my eyes were irresistibly
attracted by the brilliant lights of a shop-front in which
"Gents' Complete Shaving Outfits” were advertised in bold
letters. I paused,
my hand strayed to
my chin and cheeks,
and I was once again
aware of the down
that decorated them.
It had been a sub-
ject of considerable
controversy. My
fatherhad been con-
temptuous, and my
brother had been
abusive with a
frankness for which
the race of brothers
has been distin-
guished from time
immemorial. But
my mother had
spoken encourag-
ing words:–
“Of course,” she
had said, “it isn't
at its best now, but
whatever you do,
don't shave it. Let
it grow in a natural
way, and in a year
or two you'll have
a beautiful silky
beard that every-
body will envy. If
you shave it, it will
turn into hard stub-
ble, and then when
you want to grow a
beard some day,
where will you
be 2"
Dixon, however,
decided me. He
was older than I by
two years, and was
now in the army.

had said on that

shaving habit, and, seeing that the years of my slavery have
been many, I may lay claim to a certain knowledge of the
whims and oddities that diversify the characters of razors.
The life-destiny of a razor is to begin by being sharp, to
continue by being stropped, and to perform with silent
celerity the duty of removing hair. It is a simple life and
should require no great expenditure of energy. Yet the
chief point about any known razor is its unconquerable
perversity. There are mornings when my razor defies the º

my tender cheek,
and, though it
removes the lather,
no hair comes
with it. In vain I
| coax it to the per-
formance of its task.
After a minute or
two of steady urg-
ing it goes off into
a fit of the sulks
and bites me to the
bone. There is no-
thing for it but to
wipe it, lay it aside
in its receptacle,
and give its brother
a trial. The brother,
having made a
miserable failure
yesterday, has come
to a better mind and
now goes on its way
over the tracts of
skin with rejoicing.
In the end I get
shaved somehow,
but the toil from
first to last has been
hard, and my out-
look on the world
has been ruined for
the day.
It is strange, too,
to reflect how un-
reasoning is the ani-
mosity that a razor
often shows to his
friend, the strop.
Nothing ought to
be easier than to fit
to and fro over the
smooth leathery
surface. Yet there
are moments when

to go about like a moulting bird for? You run along and

I could not face the idea of getting shaved. The hair-
dressers whom I knew were cynical men, and I feared their
ridicule. I therefore stepped into the shop, and in a few
minutes became the possessor of a complete shaving outfit.
I hurried home, the lather was applied, the family butler told
me how the razor should be held, I gashed myself twice, and
then, proceeding with a swift and incredible resolution, made
my face hairless. Since then I have been a slave to the
course in order to
ruin its own edge by slicing away a fragment of the un-
complaining strop. MACAULAY's strops, I have heard, were
great sufferers. His razors, no doubt, resented his omni-
science, and were compelled to take it out of something.
There is, in fact, no more perverse and ill-conditioned
animal in the world than a razor. To eat mutton cold and
cut blocks with a razor has become a proverbial expression
for disappointment and futility; but on the whole it is just
as sensible to use your razor on a block as to expect it to
perform its primary duties.

THE SOAP KING'S DAUGHTER.
(A Scenario.)
TIME: Some sixty years hence. ScFNE: the Park Lane
drawing-room of the Earl of SUNLIGHT, grandson of our own
Mr. W. H. LEVER. The old Earl is in earnest conversation
with his charming daughter, Lady LUX LEVER. It seems
that since the first Earl cornered soap in 1906 the price
has been rising so rapidly that now almost the entire wealth
of the British Empire flows automatically into the family's
coffers. People, to preserve their self-respect, must be clean,
at whatever cost. The consequence is that every penny
that can be spared from the other necessaries of life is spent
on soap, at incredible prices. Lady LUX, the richest heiress
(in fact, the only heiress) in the kingdom, is *ś sought
after by the impecunious noblemen, notably, Lord JASPER
SCRUBBs, the brother and heir of the old and decrepit Duke
of BATH. So much being made clear by dialogue, the Earl
of SUNLIGHT has a song :-
When I was young I used to think,
Perhaps a little oddly,
That men might be as black as ink
So long as they were godly.
But wisdom comes, as years progress,
And Youth's ideals shatters:
And now I see that cleanliness
Is the only thing that matters.
The youth who would succeed in life,
All opposition squashing,
Who'd make a name, and win a wife,
Must never scamp his washing.
A girl who's sensible will feel
No diffidence in snubbing
A suitor who cannot conceal
His urgent need of tubbing,
Having touched thus on the brighter side of his position,
Lord SUNLIGHT comes to the single fly in his ointment. There
is one man in London, AUBREY JELLICOE, who has the spirit to
defy convention, to abstain wholly from soap, and to remain
rich and frankly grubby. Nothing can move him, not even
the glowing advertisements written for the Earl's soap by
Mr. #. the descendant of the great Times littérateur.
What is Lord SUNLIGHT to do?
LUx goes out, and enter Lord JASPER, who propounds a
devilish scheme. It should be mentioned that he loves Lady
Lux (in his own vile way). He proposes that LUX shall lead
AUBREY to fall in love with her, tell him that she cannot
marry anyone who does not use soap regularly and in large
quantities, and so induce AUBREY to spend his money. As a
reward, he, JASPER, is to marry her. Lord SUNLIGHT consents.
None of LUx's suitors have any money, and JASPER is as
eligible as any in point of rank. The scheme is mentioned to
LUx. The dutiful daughter reluctantly agrees to play the part.
Act II. TIME: three months later. SceNE: the terrace
in front of Loofah Castle, the Earl of SUNLIGHT's place on the
Wash. Enter AUBREY. He is wonderfully changed. Before,
he suggested Mr. TREE as Caliban, or Mr. CYRIL MAUDE
as The Pertick'ler Pet. Now his face shines with repeated
scrubbings. His linen is spotless. Music cue: “I’m so
happy I don't know what to do.” Song: AUBREY (Air, “Mr.
Chamberlain,” appropriately from The Beauty of Bath).
Now who was the man whose face to scan would have taken
you all your time, -
Because it was so concealed, you know, behind a mask of
grime 2
Who was the chap who cared not a scrap for what the people
said 2 -
Who is the man who, if he can, should hide his shamefaced
head 2
It's AUBREY JELLICoE, it's AUBREY JELLICOE'
I said, “to wash is simply bosh ' "
But now I know
That my views were most unsound ;
So now I've changed my ground,
And I'm your clean, keen AUBREY JELLICOE.
I said that I hoped that, if ever I soaped, you'd write mo
down an ass:
I felt 'i.shame when the moment came to see myself in the
glass.
I never cared when people stared.
shucks,”
(As Americans say) until one day I fell in love with LUx;
It didn't “amount to
And I'm AUBREY JELLICOE, the speckless JELLICoE
No spot or stain can now remain
On me. Oh, no
Though all my money's spent,
Yet I am quite content
To be your clean, keen AUBREY JELLICOE.
Erit. Enter LUx. It appears that a hitch has occurred
in the scheme. She has made AUBREY love her, and spend
all his fortune on soap; but now she, in turn, loves him.
Will her father give his consent? Never. She asks him.
Lord Sunlight. My child would wed a commoner without
a penny!
Can I believe you?
Lady Luz. Is there no hope, then 2
Lord Sunlight. Child, I won't deceive you.
Not any -
Big scene now. Enter JASPER. JASPER (sings):–
Jasper. With the guile of a snake I have sought her,
And now may I claim my reward 2
I worship your beautiful daughter:
Consent to our union, my Lord.
Lord Sunlight. Yes, I think you may fittingly clasp her.
My boy, here's my blessing. She's yours.
And, 'pon honour, you're lucky, young JASPER
She's jilted her suitors in scores.
But since such a thorough success is
The neat little scheme that you planned,
I hereby approve your addresses,
And formally give you her hand.
Enter AUBREY. He sees JASPER about to embrace Lady LUX,
and, overhearing Lord SUNLIGHT's last words, breaks in :-
Hullo, what's this little drama 2
Hullo, what is this that I see ?
You blot on this sweet panorama,
This lady's engaged, Sir, to me.
Aubrey.
The Earl explains. Dramatic pause. Then Lux plays the
trump card which she has been holding back, which is that
many years ago, quite by accident, she discovered an excellent
substitute for soap. It is efficient and can be manufactured
at an infinitesimal cost. Will her father give his consent
to her marriage with AUBREy, or must she resort to the last,
dread expedient of giving her secret to the world? JASPER
slinks off R., Lord SUNLIGHT takes the centre of the stage, and
with a hand on each of their heads, says in a low voice, as
they kneel before him, “My children, bless you!” (Curtain.)

THE SPOILS OF ROMANCE.
THE statement of a lady novelist in
The Daily Mail of Thursday last that
the minimum which she paid to the
Government in rates, taxes and duties
was £50,000, has naturally excited a
great deal of interest in literary circles.
From an extensive budget of corre-
spondence which has reached this office,
Mr. Punch selects the following typical
letters : —
DEAR SIR, -The remarkable figures
given by the lady novelist in last Thurs-
day's Daily Mail only serve as one more
striking proof of the exorbitant profits
made by the tribe of publishers. The
minimum amount that she pays annually
in rates, taxes and duties being £50,000,
I think we may safely estimate her
income at £1,000,000. Now, as we all
know, on the best possible authority,
that the publisher makes 800 per cent.
profit, it follows by process of logic that
the firm who issue her novels must
make £8,000,000 profit from her books
alone. I trust that some of the Labour
Members will take note of this astound-
ing admission, and bring the utmost
pressure to bear on the Chancellor of
the Exchequer with a view of imposing
a special income tax on those who follow
this nefarious calling.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,
HARRY FREDERICSON.
KIND, GENEROUS MR. PUNCH, - The
revelation of the lady novelist in The
Daily Mail emboldens me to enlist
your assistance. I have written a novel
which my father, who is a very severe
critic, pronounces to be little if at all
inferior to the best work of Miss CoRELLI.
At that rate it must be worth at least,
say £15,000, but I am not grasping,
and would be prepared to dispose of
the copyright entirely for £5000. Will
you advise me what publisher I ought
to apply to ; or better still, purchase the
MS. yourself, in which case you would
be practically sure to make a huge
profit on the transaction ? I may add
that I am only sixteen, that this is my
first book, and that its title is The
Python of Pampeluna. The name alone
is worth a small fortune and quite
original. Yours gratefully,
MADELINE Owen.
P.S.--I feel so certain that you will
say yes, that I have so far anticipated
your answer as to order a lovely new
winter jacket in which I intend to be
photographed for the frontispiece of
The P. of P.
P.P.S.–Pampeluna is in Italy, isn't

believing that no lady novelist has ever
paid more than £1,000 per annum in
rates and taxes. I can only account for
the extraordinary figures given in a
contemporary on the assumption that the
printer, who was possibly thinking of
Dr. Robertson NicoLL at the time, added
00 to the total.
I am, Dear Sir, yours faithfully,
MARIA SCARLATTI.
DEAR SIR,--The figures given by the
lady novelist in The Daily Mail are
somewhat difficult to reconcile with the
hard facts of the greatest circulations.
Estimating her income, as one is bound
to do, at not less than £1,000,000 a year,
I calculate that this would mean an
annual sale of not fewer than 10,000,000
DEAR SIR,--I have the best reasons for
copies. My own experience, if I may be
allowed, without offence, to introduce a
personal element intº the discussion,
inclines me to believe that no contem-
porary novelist, male or female, can
point to the achievement of such an
impressive total. In these matters, how-
ever, it is always preferable to apply
a practical test; and I am ready and
willing to back the circulation of
my forthcoming romance, The Blonde
Woman, against the next novel produced
by the lady novelist in question: the
loser in this competition to abstain from
interviews for the space of a fortnight.
Faithfully yours, MANXMAN.

How To DISCARD.
(By Mr. Punch's Bridge Expert.)
I HAVE received an interesting letter
from X. Y. Z., of the Portland Club,
on the subject of ºliscarding at Bridge.
He points out that, whereas it used
simply to be a question of discarding from
weakness or strength, there are now no
fewer than nine ways of disposing of
one's surplus cards when one has run out
of the original suit. He asks me which I
consider to be the best way.
+ + + + +
Now it must be remembered that the
sole object of the discard is to give your
partner information as to your own state.
It is obvious that the more times you
can discard the more information you
can give. One of the most effective
combinations is this, which I discovered
quite by accident when playing at. The
Times Book Club the other day. Spades
were led, and on the second round I
played a small diamond. On the third
round I discovered that the four of
spades had stuck to the ace of hearts;
whereupon I dislodged it and put it on
the table. This manoeuvre conveyed
the requisite information to my partner,
for after staring at it for some time he
said: “Good lord, if the silly idiot hasn't
revoked again ' "
+ + + + +
That, however, was a short-sighted
view to take of it, for in reality I had
discovered a new and brilliant method
of signalling. The small diamond made
it clear that I did not wish diamonds
led ; while the four of spades added that
if he went on with spades I should
have to unguard one of my strong suits.
There remained clubs and hearts, in
each of which I had five to the tem.
+ + + + +
It may often happen that you have
nothing in your own hand of any value,
and that you wish your partner to dis-
regard you and play entirely for himself.
In this case (supposing you have agreed
to discard from weakness) the simplest
way is to drop, as if by accident, one of
each of the three remaining suits on the
table at your first discard. In spite of
your apologies for your clumsiness, your
opponents will insist on two of the cards
remaining exposed. Suppose that these
are a spade and a club, and that you
leave a diamond on ; then your partner
knows at once that he isn't to lead spades,
diamonds, or clubs. As you are already
out of hearts, the deduction is a simple
one. This is known as The Three
Discard Trick, and is very popular.
+ + + + +
By the way, the same information may
be given to your partner by “Yarborough
again, confound it all!” But not so
subtly. - - -
, ºr - ºk × :k -je.
In the course of his letter X.Y.Z. refers
to the “Odd and Even Discard”—the
discard of an odd-pipped card meaning
“from weakness,” of an even-pipped
card “from strength"—and asks if it
is likely to be popular. Personally I
feel sure it is ; and, feeling this, I have
invented, on the same line, an elaborate
system of “throwing ”—the sole motive
being to convey information to one's
partner. It is known as The Macaroni
Concention. Here it is.
I. An old red card.-“My hand is
now in Class D, and may be had for
1s. 10d. net.”
II. An odd black card. —“The whisky
is behind you.”
III. An eren red card. –“Good lord,
I've revoked.”
IV. An eren black card.-- “Don’t say
anything; perhaps he won't notice.”
V. A multiple of three in red.—
“You’ll have to pay for both of us.
I've only got a shilling on me.”
LINES ON A MODERN POLYMATH.
VI. A multiple of three in black-
“He played that one before; I saw him.”
+ + + + + -
So much for the simple observations
of the Bridge table. But the system
goes further, and includes the naming
of every card. Thus the king of hearts
is shown by discarding first the three
of diamonds and then the seven of
clubs—or, if you have not those, by
any 3-7 combination. The ace of clubs
by a 2-8 combination . . . and so on. If
you happen not to have the right
combination to indicate the particular
ace or king, then you throw the card
itself, and your partner at once sees that
you have it.
sk + × * :k
By the way, I need hardly tell X.Y.Z.
and my other readers that after a ball
or dinner-party he should always dis-
card twice in his best suit.
SHOULD you thirst for information .

to smite the Nonconformist conscience,
quotations from RobespierRE and DANTON
came in with striking appropriateness.
In the Commons this performance
would have had but short run. Warning
cries of “Question' Question " " would
have been raised, and the SPEAKER or
Ch.AiRMAN of CoMMITTEEs would, on the
Standing Order dealing with irrele-
ancy, order the Member to resume
his seat. Noble Lords are more tolerant
with their own order. A Peer's a Peer
for a’ that. To rebuke one publicly
would be to suggest possibility of flaw
in a sacred cult. Accordingly they sat
with polite air of attention whilst the
precious minutes sped.
At approach to end of first half hour
it grew too much even for the patience
of the Peerage. One Peer coughed. Two
or three moved restlessly in their seats.
A low buzz of conversation went round.
Anxious glances were bent on the mass
of manuscript in the hand of the orator.
He seemed good at least for an hour.
“In Trance,” Lord EMLY incidentally
remarked, “the State edited the Cate-
chism--the State which denied the
existence of the Supreme Being and the
immortality of the soul.”
That was too much. AMPTHILL made
desperate appeal to CHAIRMAN of CoM-
MITTEEs. “How long, how long?” he
cried, throwing up his arms with
despairing gesture, reminiscent of Wilson
BARRETT. More to the point was threat
to move that EMLY be no longer heard.
Pained astonishment was written deep
on EMLY's spacious brow. What did
noble Lords want? That he should
confine his speech to his amendment?
Very well. Magnanimous minds, though
wounded, cherish no resentment. He
would proceed to allude to his amend-
ment.
A moan of anguish rose from the
parched lips of the stricken host. AMPT-
hiLL showed sign of rising again. “I
move my amendment,” Lord EMLY
hurriedly said, and sat down, leaving
unread not the least interesting portion
of his manuscript, which dealt with the
history of the Church as affected by
the ingrained lack of ceremony in the
manner of OLIVER CROMWELL, and the
lack of sympathy with ecclesiastical
institutions displayed by his instruments
and associates.
Business done.--First round on Edu-
cation Bill. Government defeated by

Tuesday night.--In both Houses almost
simultaneously hum - drum course of
business broken up by sudden eruption.
In the Lords the Primate, who is having
a thoroughly good time, moved amend-
ment to Clause 2 of Education Bill.
Ministers declined to accept it. The
statesman long known in Commons as
St. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS (now
coroneted but retaining the Saintship
as Viscount St. ALDwyN) submitted varia-
tion on CANTUAR's amendment. This
commended itself to both sides. That
of itself suspicious circumstance. Better
think the matter over.
CREWE suggested dealing with it on
Clause 3. Lord HARRIs, thinking the
time had come to put himself on, bowled
what umpire (ONslow) declared no-ball.
Moved that the House adjourn. Had
this been carried—and the Opposition
in the Lords can carry anything—the
Bill would have been destroyed. At
CHAIRMAN's suggestion HARRIS moved
“that the House resume.” On division
this was negatived. Noble Lords who
had arranged to sit till midnight found
themselves on their way home by eight
o'clock.
In the Commons Plural Voting Bill
stuck fast in Committee. LULU appealed
to Opposition to let it move along. This
the fifth day they had been discussing
the first clause. Let them forthwith
proceed to division.
“Never witnessed such effrontery!"
cried CARSON, upon whom the bland,
almost child-like, presence of LULU at
the Table acts as a red flag flaunted in
face of bull.
The Opposition deaf to entreaty, C.-B.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PLAY3 ANCIENT AND MODERN.
*I.
ARTEMIS OF THE STRAND.
THE Greek play at the Adelphi may
be dead before these lines appear in
print; but the fear of that calamity –
which I should honestly deplore—shall
not deter me from easing my mind upon
so attractive a theme. As an academic
exercise The Virgin Goddess is some-
thing more than creditable to its author
Mr. RUDOLF BESIER ; as a stage-produc-
tion it confirms Mr. OTHO STUART's repu-
tation for sportsmanship. But the
difficulty with these archaistic essays
is that they are apt to prove too antique
for 95 per cent. of the audience and too
modern for the remainder. Mr. BESIER,
leaning to compromise, has sought to
appease M. WALKLEY, by a remarkably
close adherence to the unities beloved
of ARISTOTLE, and by illustrating the
hallowed workings of Greek Destiny;
and at the same time he has appealed
to the modern mind by embroider-
ing his scheme with subtleties, and
deranging the statuesqueness of his
figures with occasional bursts of fury
and clamour.
Haephestion (an impossible Greek
name, pronounced with a short e in
the second syllable; it should, of course,
have been Hephaestion) murders his
King Cresphontes . . . Mr. Alfred Brydone.
brother, the king of Artis, ostensibly
on the ground of cowardice; but to this
motive is added another-that of passion
for the king's wife; and it is this
second, and probably primary, motive
which causes Artemis, in whose worship
he had taken the vows of chastity, to
demand the sacrifice of a life. Yet, strict
as the moral principles of this goddess
were known to be, I doubt if mere illicit
desire, as distinct from an actual breach
of her law, would have incited her to
vengeance. It is true that the punish-
ment of Actaeon, converted into a stag
and torn in shreds by his misguided
pack simply because he caught a
glimpse of her in her bath, might be
urged against this view. But that was
a case of personal pique. In the
present instance I grant that the love
motive is cleverly introduced, since it
softens our hearts to the murderer and
adds a strong force of pathos to his
eventual sacrifice of the woman whom
he loves; but the subtlety of this com-
plication is perhaps rather modern.
Again, the blindness of the king's
mother (played by Miss GENEVIEVE WARD
on the best lines of classical tradition)
has too modern a note of appeal. Cer-
tainly, as in the case of the blind seer
Teiresias, her sightlessness adds poign-
ancy to her power of prophetic vision ;
yet this foreknowledge of doom is here
somewhat of a superfluity, since the
denunciations of the Priestess (admirably
delivered by Miss MADGE McINTosh) sup-
ply all that is needed in that department.
There were two deeds of blood in the
play; and each was apparently per-
formed in the interior of the Temple of
Artemis. I confess that it struck me
as an impropriety that the Holy of
Holies should be thus utilised as a
shambles. It was quite right and Greek,
of course, for these unsightly things to
be done “off”; but Mr. OSCAR-AséHE
(who looked like a Farnese Heracles in
training) was quite large enough to have
killed his brother somewhere else, when
he was not at his prayers and unarmed ;
and, from what I know of Artemis, I am
sure that she would have preferred that
the execution of Althea should take
place in an adjacent grove. The in-
teriors of Greek Temples were not meant
for blood-sacrifices.
The callousness of the chorus of
acolytes, male and female, was appalling.
After personally witnessing the murder
of their king, they casually strolled out
of the Temple with their property lyres
|and pipes, and at once threw off an In
Memoriam Ode, set to what sounded
just like Christian Church music. The
next time that Mr. Asche entered the
sacred shrine on butchery bent they
had the decency to pop out into the
fresh air without assisting at the horrid
spectacle; and put in another Ode of a
more broadly reflective character, suit-
able for keeping in stock for a variety
of occasions.
On the whole Mr. BESIER's verse was
adequately Greek in spirit; and, if not
distinguished by actual genius, main-
tained a workmanlike level. The habit,
common with the best in this kind, of
putting highly-wrought imagery into
unlikely mouths, is not a very notice-
able vice in his work. Once I caught
him mangling a Christian phrase where
! someone proposes to keep the State
“unspotted in the world’’; and once I
was shocked to hear Althea address her
lover as “Heart of my heart!” a tag
that might have come clean out of a
drawing-room phantasy by Mr. WEATHER-
LY or Mr. CLIFTON BINGHAM.
Miss LILY BRAYTON, whose physique
does not seem to allow her to be force-
ful without visible strain, was best in
the moving passage in which she sur.
renders herself to voluntary death. She

knows how to keep still, and her poses,
set off by a lovely himation, were ad-
mirably plastic. Mr. OSCAR ASCHE, on
the other hand, was never so happy as
when he found himself in a scrimi
with six men on the top of him. Watch-
ing the feats of this splendid Rugby
forward it was difficult for us to believe
that, after having declared himself
“Indomitable as a man foredoomed "
(this is from BROWNING's Artemis, not
Mr. BESIER's), he would have tamely
submitted to the threats of a female
referee. I should have thought more of
him if he had persuaded the author to
let him go through with his original
scheme.
Mr. CHARLEs Rock is a sound crafts-
man, but nature never meant him for
a Captain of Greek infantry. His men
had a bad habit of shouting Ay! on
the slightest provocation, as if they had
been British Tars or M.P.'s. I liked
their bare legs better than the fleshings
of the acolytes. As for the chitons of
the chorus of maidens, no attempt
seems to have been made to let them
fall in simple Greek lines. They were
hopelessly bunched about the breast
and waist.
Mr. Joseph HARKER, whose one beauti-
ful scene served for the whole play,
should make a closer study of the archi-
tecture of Greek Temples, and so avoid
repetition of his present hybrid design,

with its Doric triglyphs and Ionic
volutes. Mr. CHRISTOPHER WILSON, before
he next attempts to write incidental
music for a Greek play, had better run
up to Cambridge and hear Sir CHARLES
STANFORD's setting of the Eumenides ;
and meanwhile might cut out that noisy
pizzicato plunking of his fiddles, which
is so intolerable a distraction. I said
“Hush ’’ during one of these excesses;
but the conductor took no notice.
II.
ENTERTAINING DEVILs UNAWARE.
Perhaps our tastes have been vitiated
by an over-lavish use of
epigram on the stage; anyhow
in The Charity that Began at
Home I thought that the fine
gold of Mr. HANKIN's wit had
been beaten out a little too
thin. The first scene was an
almost exact reproduction of
life; and the humours of a
British interior do not often
lend themselves to photo-
graphy. I have, I hope, a
right contempt for the con-
ventional drivel that is written
about the need of action in
drama, dialogue being, of
course, the most common of
all forms of action; but I am
certain that even social drama
should answer certain de-
mands which are not satisfied
by written dialogue, or why
put it upon a stage at all ?
And I felt that apart from
the admirable acting of Miss
HAYDON and Mr. EADIE, both
of whom materially contri-
buted to a realisation of the
author's design, there was
very little in the play which
might not have equally edified
mo on the written page. In-
deed there were one or two
noticeable defects which might
to the point of absolute repulsion. As
for the general motive of the play,
charity is perhaps not so wide-spread
a virtue that we should need anyone to
point out to us the dangers of an indis-
criminate exercise of it. However,
nobody supposes that Mr. HANKIN is in
earnest, and so that doesn't matter much.
What does matter is that his cynicism
appears to disregard the laws of average
and probability. By arbitrarily choos-
ing all his examples (varied enough in
themselves) from the same type—the
type, that is, on whom charity is likely
to be wasted—he runs the risk of seeming

THE following advertisement appeared
in Thursday's Morning Post:

So far as the man in the street was
concerned the matter ended here; but,
knowing the sex as he does, Mr. Punch
was not at all surprised when the fol-
lowing further advertisements arrived
(by mistake) at his office.

merely read the dialogue-
in print; but being visibly presented
on the stage were "a sore affront to my
sense of decency. One was in the scene
where, amid a tittering of the bolder
spirits in the audience, the condition of
the maid-servant who has lost her virtue
is freely discussed in her actual presence,
the miserable girl being all the while
shaken with sobs. The theme in itself
may not be unfit for treatment on the
stage, and one can understand how such
matters might, for the purposes of an
author's scheme, be regarded as a sub-
ject for levity; but this levity cannot
be tolerated in the presence of the victim
who is so pitifully incapable of sharing
it. This graft of humour on a stock of
Stage Society realism was incongruous
to beg the question. After all, the
charitable people who practise indis-
criminate hospitality cannot always be
entertaining devils unaware. There
must be a stray angel or so even among
the forlorn and unpopular.
But, when all is said, Mr. HANKIN's
talent remains undoubted ; and his
ultimate success as a playwright can
only be a question of time and experience.
Motto for the Ninth.

feasting as in fighting, and some of our
city captains and carpet knights will

afternoon. Don't forget I have your

LoRD Roberts may be right in having
no faith in Mr. HALDANE's Army Scheme,
but we think that the expression “Mr.

used the other day, is one that will be
challenged by anyone who has seen the
War Minister in the flesh.

“A LIFE which, if I may so express myself, began early
and has lasted for several years, an observant habit and a
retentive memory, have enabled me to set forth as things
seen and heard by me a good many incidents.” Thus Mr.
G. W. E. RUSSELL presents his credentials on opening a gallery
of Social Silhouettes (SMITH, ELDER). They range over a wide
area, from the schoolboy to the schoolmaster (two of the best),
from the curate to the bishop, from the Labour member to
the Whig, from the diner-out and the carpet-bagger to
the invalid. “Let us part good friends,” Mr. Russell, pleads
in the final chapter. There is scarcely need for the entreaty.
He is not the man to sacrifice a smart saying because if
uttered it might give pain ; but on the whole the volume
is singularly free from acerbity. Among many interesting
stories he mentions one new to me. Thirty-three years
ago, Sir GEORGE GREY sat for Morpeth, a Whig stronghold
unchallenged since the passage of the Reform Bill. In the
fulness of his heart, the states-
While others less modest persuaded themselves, per-
haps too easily, that they were “making history” in the
House of Commons and on the platform, Sir BENJAMIN STONE,
M.P. (one of the faithful seven of Birmingham) has been
patiently pegging away with a camera, making history enough
for all of them put together. His record of men and things
as they exist at Westminster, of which we get a fascinating
glimpse in Sir Benjamin Stone's Pictures (CASSELL & Co.),
will be a priceless storehouse to our successors. It may well
come to be called “Historic. Peeps; or, Extinct Objects of
the ‘Stone Age.’” He has led off, willing captives, to his own
particular gate and archway on the Terrace where his camera
lurks, statesmen and politicians of every class and party,
officials, distinguished visitors from all over the world.
Everyone and everything connected with Parliament has
faced that trusty weather-beaten little lens: from Mr. BALFour
to the Mace, from Lord ALTHORP to the House of Commons'
bootblack, from Mr. EDMUND GossE to the clock-face of Big
Ben, from the Unionist Whips in solemn conclave to the
Pygmies of the African primeval Forest, from Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
right down to the Parliamentary caricaturists.

The cause is that of virgin woods

To be transported, labelled “goods”—

of a family who dwelt near the Line and made friends with
engine-drivers and passengers and extracted all the joy that a
Line can offer. And that is all I shall tell you ; the rest est à

mothers in real life who happen to be living near the Line may
have nothing for E. NESBIT but disapproval-since no child can
possibly read this book without wanting similar adventures.
In her latest novel Miss KATHARINE TYNAN is a little unkind
to her heroine Bawn Cardrew (but née Derèreur). The young
lady is made to tell her own story, and the artlessness of
the achievement is not sufficiently concealed by the author's
art. In fact, The Story of Bawn (SMITH, ELDER) reminds
me of the simple but feeling remark of the Scotch schoolboy,
“Please, teacher, there's too much sugar in the semolina
pudding.” That is the trouble with Miss TYNAN's book. It
is pleasant to the taste, and pure and wholesome, but it is a
trifle too sweet. Still, though Bawn says it herself, or rather
repeats, as un-self-consciously as may be, what she hears
or overhears others say about her, she is as charming as she
is beautiful, and her story has just the touch of distressful-
ness proper to a tale of John Bull's other Island. So that
when she is saved at the eleventh hour from sacrificing her-
self for the sake of her family in a loveless marriage, and
finds herself in the arms of Anthony Cardrew, one can only
regret that one has lost the sweet tooth of childhood's days.

A sundering BAR of soap.
My JANE, 'tis better so for both,
Better that we like this should part
Than later on, when ring and oath
Had strictly sealed us heart to heart;
Better to bear the sudden pang
Of virgin loves that timely sever,
Than have the serpent's horrid fang
Gnawing our married chests for ever,
Uplifted by the natural pride
Resulting from a new trousseau,
You might have made a jocund bride,
But not for very long, oh no!
The Spectre must have come between,
Spoiling your too short-lived elation,
And fetched us forth to BARGRAVE DEANE
To see about a separation.
I sent you late an amorous line,
And there, mid many a sparkling trope,
Thinking to make your cheeks to shine,
Enclosed a slab of Sunlight Soap ;
But you thereat scarce deigned to look,
And straight returned my gallant tender,
Saying you would not let your cook
So much as try it on her fender.
You told me you had proved and found
My pledge of faith how false it was;
You said it didn't weigh a pound,
But something short of 15 oz. ;
Sooner a solid inch of dust
Should on your unsoaped features gather
Than you'd consent to take on trust
Me or my LEVER's loathéd lather.
Thus on a point of Soap we break!
It looks a trivial cause, I own ;
Yet there's a virtue here at stake
Second to godliness alone!
Nor could my trust in marriage-ties
Endure a frame of mind that menaces
The principle which underlies
Man's first Combine (see Book of Genesis).
Better, as I remarked above,
Now, ere the fatal wedding chime,
To see our adolescent love
Safely extinguished just in time;
I'd sooner bear this present jar,
That dislocates our vow to Venus,
Than subsequently find a bar
Of Honeymoonlight Soap between us!
O. S.
Mr. Punch begs to call attention to an extraordinary
coincidence as revealed in The Sketch this week. On page
104 of that paper there is a photograph of a gentleman, and
under it appear the words, “Mr. GEORGE H. DENNEBY, engaged
to Miss QUEENIE CoPPINGER.” Felicitating him mentally, Mr.
Punch passed on to the next picture, which, to his amaze-
ment, he saw described as: “Miss QUEENIE CoPPINGER,
engaged to Mr. GEORGE H. DENNEBY.” That he should be
engaged to her is not at all surprising, but that she should
at the same time be engaged to him —Well, Mr. Punch
feels that the least he can do in the unique circumstances is
to offer them both his very hearty congratulations.

of this Bill give us some guidance? There was once, I
remember, a slow bowler who had a most deadly delivery.
It used to puzzle us, my Lords. My Lords, we are now
puzzled. [Opposition murmurs of sympathy.
The Archbishop of Canterbury. My Lords, I will endeavour
to explain, or, if I may use a vulgar phrase, to put the matter
in a nutshell. If this amendment is carried we shall by the
insertion of mandatory words previously rejected by the
Government and therefore eminently worthy of your Lord-
ships' best attention, nullify—at least I hope we shall to
some extent, though to what extent I cannot quite say, but
at any rate the effect cannot well be the same; and we shall
thus, if we strike out lines fourteen, fifteen and sixteen,
and substitute the words “such teaching as a majority of
parents may or shall after an appeal to the Board of Educa-
tion—” I think this makes it perfectly plain.

I'm told by folk who ought to know
That puppies as a rule
Acquire a charming manner, though
They never go to school;
The tactful art which sets apart
The courtier from the guppy,
The charm, the grace, still find their place
Instinctive in the puppy.

Your manners were acquired,
But howsoever learnt, I swear,

Or even say a curt “Good-day ”?
No, Hooligan, you utter
A piercing cry, and off you fly
To chase her down the gutter.
Don't tell me there's a racial feud
Twixt cats and dogs. That's rot!
You're just as combative and rude
To any brither-Scot.
A bandied pup comes sidling up
To have a friendly pow-wow,
And with a snap you greet the chap,
You vicious little bow-wow.
With men you are no better bred ;
The postman hopes you'll die;
The newsboy watches you with dread
And hatred in his eye.
You love to come with muddy tum
To sit on silk foundations,
And wipe the dirt on Aunt JANE's skirt,
Of whom I'd expectations.
Me too, your lord, you treat as ill
As any other folk;
You drag me forth o'er dale and hill
When I would lie and smoke.
Or, should the rain your zeal restrain,
You, Scamp, who ought to guard one,
Will make your lair in my best chair
And drive me to the hard one.
O Scamp, when all your faults I see,
I gather on the whole
Yours is too villainous to be
A little canine soul;
And when I mark the wicked spark
That twinkles in your eyes, Scamp,
I simply must believe you're just
A human in disguise, Scamp.

A TRAP FOR COUNTRY MICE,
MR. PUNCH's UNTRUSTWORTHY GUIDE To
LONDON.
CHAPTER VIII.
The Clubs of London.
THE great centre of Clubland is Pall
Mall and St. James's Street, but of late
years there has been a decentralising
tendency, and the term West-end Club
now includes Soho as well as Fitzroy
Square, while the fast smart set chiefly
affect the National Liberal Club on the
Embankment, where a Hungarian band
is exclusively retained for the benefit of
the Eighty Club.
To start on a walk through Clubland,
one cannot do better than begin in
Waterloo Place, which is flanked by the
Senior United Service and the Athe-
naeum. In the summer these two vener-
able institutions ex-
change hospitalities,
much to themutual grati-
fication of the Episcopal
bench and science on
the one hand and of
Generals and Admirals
on the other. Strange
as it may appear, the
standard of proficiency
at Bridge and Billiards
is much higher at the
Athenaeum. In deed,
gambling is so rife
amongst the hierarchy
of intellect, that the
frequent headline “Raid
on a West-end Club ''
nine times out of ten
refers to a descent of the
police on the Athenaeum.
seen from Pall Mall on any moderately
clear day. The best view is from
Waterloo Place.
Passing hastily westward from the
precincts of this ill-omened institution,
we note first the Travellers' and then
the Reform Clubs. Of the first com-
mercial travellers are - all er - officio
members; the second, we need hardly
remind our readers, was founded to
commemorate a culinary triumph of
SoYER-cutlets à la Réforme. In the
spacious central hall the only full-length
statue is that of a lady–a fact which
bears eloquent testimony to the spread
of feminism in Liberal circles. What-
ever Clubs may be wrecked by the next
riot of our political Amazons, the Reform
will surely be spared.
The Carlton, called after the famous
hotel, next greets our inquiring gaze.
Here the old noblesse and the new pluto-
Waterloo Place is dull
and decorous enough
by day, but at 2 or
3 A.M. the spectacle of a bevy of prelates,
judges and Fellows of the Royal Society
flying precipitately before the minions of
Scotland Yard lends it a most engaging
animation. These escapades, how-
ever, are invariably hushed up, and the
absence of any inquiry into them before
the Police Commission furnishes a
sinister illustration of the immunity
which wealth and rank can secure for
high-placed culprits.
The fact that strangers are never
admitted into the Club and that (so it
is asserted) an oath of secrecy is extorted
from all members, explains the singular
fact that the precise nature and extent
of these orgies has never yet transpired.
There is a terrible story, however, of a
prelate supposed to be deceased, who
is really immured in solitary confine-
ment on the top storey for his failure
to meet a debt of honour. His white-
walled prison, which was built to accom-
modate him some few years ago, may be

cracy meet on terms of perfect gastro-
nomical equality – a striking tribute to
the genial camaraderie of English
Society. On the other side of the road
we note the Junior Carlton-renowned
for its famous marble staircase, which
reproduces the texture of Gorgonzola
cheese with such astounding accuracy
that an absent-minded member is
stated to have once been detected in
the fruitless endeavour to obtain mural
refreshment from its unyielding surface.
The generous bulk of the Army and
Navy Club next arrests our attention, but
not for long, its ominous nickname of the
“Rag”—derived from recent military
excesses—proving it to be no place for
the pacific sightseer. Any stranger enter-
ing its portals, whether by accident or
design, is at once tarred and feathered.
The statement that all subscribers to the
Army and Navy Stores are ex-officio mem-
bers of the Rag is not accurate. Again
crossing the road we are struck by the

sombre and scholastic façade of the
Oxford and Cambridge Club. It may
not be generally known that conversation
within its walls is habitually carried on
in the dead languages, and that the hall-
porter is the author of a dainty little
brochure on enclitics. -
The charming bijou residence which
adjoins the Oxford and Cambridge is the
Guards' Club, the rendezvous of all the
railwaymen of London. Punctually at
1.15 you may see Sir GEORGE GIBB, Chair-
man of the Metropolitan District, arriving
for his frugal chop, a splendid protest
against the habit of overcrowding so
prevalent on his line; and if you wait
for half-an-hour you will see him, nine
days out of ten, coming down the
steps arm-in-arm with Mr. RICHARD
BELI., M.P.
St. James's Street, into which we now
turn, is full of interest to the student
of sociology. Here is
Boodle's, the home of
plutocrats, where no
member has less than
£15,000 a year, and the
youngestisaffectionately
known as Boodle's Baby.
Here too is Brooks's,
the head - quarters of
the Soap Trust; and
Arthur's, founded by
the late Premier, in the
billiard-room of which
he wrote most of his
famous History of
England. There is a
well-authenticated story
in the Club that he
never entered the read-
ing-room ; and it is
on record that he once
only was observed to
notice the tape-machine
and then merely to tear a
strip off to take the place of a missing
evening tie.
White's Club is noted for its old-
fashioned exclusion of coloured gentle-
men, and the fact that all the scions of
the White family—Sir GEORGE WHITE,
Sir WillIAM White, Mr. ARNOLD WHITE
and Mr. PERCY WHITE amongst others—
are hereditary life members. No White,
in fact, can be black-balled. The Devon-
shire, once Crockford's, is remarkable
for its unusually large proportion of
clerical members and the fact that, by
the Rules of the Club, Cavendish is the
only tobacco allowed in the smoking-
room. The red blinds of the New Uni-
versity Club are the only outward in-
dication of the anarchist views held by
the majority of its members.
But now let us traverse Bond Street
and look in at The Times Book Club and
have 100 up with Mr. MoBERLY BELL in
the billiard-room, giving him 15 start.
But no-on second thoughts we will not.

A LETTER FROM A BRIDE.
Claridge's.
DEAREST DAPHNE, -What a simply
horrid institution honeymoons are At
the same time, what a blessing they're
briefer than they used to be I was
so thankful to get away from that peni-
tential old prison the DUNSTABLEs lent
us and come to town. We shan't settle
into the house in Park Lane much before
the spring. In the meantime it's much
livelier and comfier here, and we shall
be on the wing again soon.
It was rotten luck that you couldn't
be bridesmaid after all. The wedding
went off all right. I went through it
without turning a hair, and came up
smiling. My bridal gown was a dead-
white satin princesse robe, quite plain
and simple some of the mater's old
Brussels point on the bodice and train,
and the Brussels veil she was married
in herself. People were simply most
awfully kind in their comments.
one said I looked “a dream,” and some-
one else said I was “a perfect picture"
(the bridegroom, I suppose, being the
gold frame).
awful, my dear. Wedding garments do
not suit anyone who 's stout and bald.
After the ceremony, too, he smiled a lot,
which also is most unbecoming to him.
Indeed, once or twice during the reception
at home, with all my pluck, I felt, as I
looked at him receiving congrats, that,
though I'd scarcely been married an
hour, I must rush straight off and get
a divorce.
There were only one or two little
hitches in the day's function.
BARs the Second, evidently disliking
her duties as “pagess,” turned refrac.
tory, and finally had to be carried
screaming from the church. STELLA
CLACKMANNAN's little NIGEL, not demoral-
ised by this awful example, did duty
for both like a little angel.
The village choir was more than a bit
out of tune in “The voice that breathed
o'er Eden;" then the supply of white
mums that the school children strewed
in my path ran short. Oh, and another
thing, some local people, in spite of re-
uests to the contrary, threw a lot of
those beastly confetti over me, and,
though I had to smile, I felt more like
braining them. -
The bridesmaids, on the whole, were
a success, but those Incroyable hats want
some wearing, as you know, and, between
ourselves, Wºj and CUckco DELAMONT
didn't come through the ordeal well,
especially Cuckoo.
Everyone was so sweet in carrying out
the scheme of a white wedding, and
dressing accordingly, except the Duchess

came in plaid Of course she didn't

forget, but she had nothing suitable in
her wardrobe, and didn't mean to get
anything. I'd be the last to talk
scandal, particularly of family connec-
tions, but the DUNSTABLES are just as
miserly as they make 'em. They agree
in mising, though in nothing else. My
dear, the little five-o'clock tea-set they
sent me is plated | There! I know one
oughtn't to look a gift-horse in the
mouth—but when the gift-horse turns
out to be not a horse at all, but a
common little donkey, one can't help
mentioning it. And now I beg to make
a present, to all and sundry, of this
social conundrum :--When a girl gets a
positively rotten wedding-present from
people who are simply rolling, ought
she to thank them for it as if it were a
proper one * -
I don't think anyone cried when I
went away, except HiLDEGARDE and my
old Nurse. I didn't cry. No, old girl,
it wasn't that I was hard and unfeeling,
but there are occasions when, if you
once began to cry, you'd never leave off.
That other wedding took place at
St. Agatha's, Berkeley Square, the day
after mine. Someone who was there
has told me about it. Norty looked
particularly handsome, she said, and
rather serious for once. His brother
KIDDY was best man. Aunt GoLDING-
HAM had a brand-new transformation
(auburn this time) and wore a gown of
chiffon-velours (dregs-of-wine shade),
with togue to match. She carried an
ivory prayer-book. Two of the little
HYLTONs—her great-nephews, you know
—were pages. The church was packed
(I rather fancy they put boards outside
with “House Full”), and the choir of

St. Agatha sang “0 Perfect Love” in
their best style. Among the crowd who
witnessed the performance was POPSY,
Lady RAMSGATE, dressed for fifteen, with
young RoNNY Folj AMBE in tow (he's just
left Eton, and I suppose was having an
object-lesson in marriage à la mode).
The happy pair are 'mooning at Aunt

Josiah has such a queer vocabulary.
I don't mean slang or mining terms.
He uses those sometimes, and then
apologises, though they're all right, and
I've annexed some of them myself.
But yesterday he said that someone or
other was “ladylike.” I simply yelled.
Then he got a bit huffy, and said he
supposed the term was old-fashioned,
and sometimes he feared that what it
meant was old-fashioned too. Really,
as a retort, it was “not 'arf,” and I told
him so. I've asked him if I have any
in-laws? He is vague on the point,
and evidently doesn't mean to produce
any, which is by way of being a
blessing, for in-law's that, socially
speaking, are outlaws would be a pro-
blem that would want some solving.
The other day some friend or relative
of Josi AH's, who had evidently read the
account of our wedding in the papers,
and was foggy as to how far my little
title will stretch, wrote to him and
directed it –“ The Hon. Josi AH MULTI-

Saturday, as being a day devoted to
athletics, might be called Fryday.

The above questions, which may
at first sight seem to form part of
the Research and Literary Com-
petitions in “The Reader,” for
answers next week, were in reality
drawn up by Mr. Punch, and will
probably never be answered at all.
But they serve to show what an
interest, and lively interest, is now
being taken in Literature.
But first I must premise that, in-
credible as it may seem, the PETER of
this history is a real PETER, not a nick-
name or a character out of a book. This,
in an age of make-believe PETERs, King
PETERs, PETERs with Households, or those
others whom we have loved on the stage
of Wyndham's or the Duke of York's
Theatre, is, I am aware, to test your
belief in him to the utmost. My PETER,
however, was no mere literary fiction,
but a remarkably solid fact, so christened
by grown-up and responsible godparents
‘I doves, but the simile is an obvious one
in a real church, nay, a cathedral; a
PETER moreover who, at goodness knows
how many or how few weeks old, already
weighs a wholly preposterous number
of-whatever units they employ for baby-
weight. And it happens that PETER's
father is my oldest and best friend in
the world, and PETER's mother is already
one of my dearest; and—I had merer yet
seen PETER.
I wasted my italics there. They should
have been kept for this reflection, which
is infinitely more important and more
charged with alarming possibilities ;
PETER had never yet seen me !
Now you understand, and (I hope)
appreciate the position. Is it strange
that I was nervous at the prospect of
this interview 2 So much depended
upon its result. I had an uncle once
who would estimate character solely by
the behaviour of his dogs, a peculiarity
to which (having always a certain fellow-
ship with the four-footed) I was indebted
for many tips. “There can't be much
harm in a lad,” he would say, “if the
dogs take to him,” and there followed
a sovereign. This of a terrier. Con-
versely then, and how much more, if
PETER should howl, or discover any
symptoms of antipathy towards me?
Where then would be the honourable
record of a bachelor friendship, the
tradition of a blameless career at Oxford
and elsewhere? In two pairs of eyes
I felt that I should have been exposed
for ever. Probably I should be for-
bidden the house, or (at best) tolerated
as a trickster whose worthlessness had
been laid bare. This was the thought
that was unnerving me as I approached
the place of inquisition.
PETER’s parents live in a flat. It is a
very small flat, at the head of a long
and most uninteresting staircase, and
in it they have dwelt since their mar-
riage like two charmingly self-satisfied
turtle-doves on the topmost branches of
a tall tree. Physically of course they
are not in the very least like turtle-
for the contentment of their nest. That
however was W.P. – Without Peter.
How his arrival might have affected this,
and other things, I was now to discover.

explained. “That's PETER.”

Young Subaltern (having applied in rain for the customary orerdraft—to bosom friend). “I say, old chAP, A Most Extraordix ARY
Thing ! MY BANKERS HAVE Lost Their NERVE!”
I was conscious the while of only one
thought, that I had suddenly grown
unutterably old. It was the knell of a
generation that was sounding in this
insistent voice; all at once I saw myself
and my own concerns as things that
were past.
“He'll be in soon now,” said PETER's
father. He spoke nervously, much as
might the host at a theatrical enter-
tainment that had been imperfectly
rehearsed. Clearly he, too, was appre-
hensive of this meeting. I shuffled my
feet in assent, and we waited.
And then, before I had expected it,
He entered, on the arm of a transfigured
likeness to the hostess I remembered,
and I saw him, the arbiter of my destiny,
clad in some traily covering that may
have been clouds of glory or a mere
earthly garment of silk and laces. I
shall attempt no more detailed descrip-
tion, and as a matter of fact he was
wholly unlike anything except a very
pink and crumply baby. He was quite
silent and terribly alert.
The moment had come. “PETER,”
said she who held him (and even her
voice was not wholly free from anxiety),
“look, who's this?”
I stood up, and on the instant various
ingratiating modes of address, com-
mencing with the word “Didums,” fled
incontinent, leaving me naked and
defenceless before the searching scrutiny
of the eyes that met my own.
Blue eyes they were, and hugely, dis-
proportionately round. They seemed
to grow larger and rounder as they
looked. For a long moment he regarded
me without comment, and I fancy that
three faces were a little pale with the
strain of that suspense. And then,
slowly, deliberately, comprehendingly,
PETER smiled.
So that was all right. Instinctively we
all breathed sighs of relief. The momen-
tous question of “Who’s this 2" had
been decided in my favour, and PETER
had taken me under his protection.
Soon he was clasping one of my fingers
in an absurdly tiny fist, with the
apparent intention of cramming it down
his own throat. And quite suddenly
he began to sing, a song formless and
weird, such as a German goblin might
croon upon the summit of the Brocken,
all rolling gutturals and unexpected
turns. The words of it no mere man
might comprehend, but fortunately
without this the meaning was suffi-
ciently clear.
“Pass, friend,” said PETER.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRoM THE DIARY or Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday night, Nov. 5.
—Battering of Education Bill inter-
mitted for brief interval, during which a
painful scene went forward. Not often
have noble Lords looked upon four Mem-
bers of their order brought up to the
Bar, manacled, in charge of BLACK Rod
armed to the teeth. Lord RIPON and
Lord HALSBURY so profoundly affected by
the spectacle that they mumbled inaudi-
ble sentences across the Table.
From other sources of information the
melancholy story was gleaned. It seems
that the four Peers, Lord MANNERs (not
“SALISBURY's MANNERs; ” he is now Duke
of RUTLAND), Lord LEITRIM, Lord GRIM-
THORPE and Lord ARMSTRONG, have been
diligently voting throughout the Session,
regardless of the fact that they had not
taken the Oath of Allegiance. For this
offence the law decrees penalty of £500
for each separate crime.
Affair deplorable in each case. In
GRIMTHORPE's, offence is aggravated by
circumstance that he has recorded his
votes in favour of the Government, thus
giving them a fictitious appearance of
strength.
Printed copy of the Orders enables
noble Lords to gather that Leader of
House is whispering across the Table
expression of desire to amend the division
lists by striking out the names of the

peccant Peers. Three of them, over-
whelmed with sense of guilt, stand dumb,
wistfully watching the countenance of
HALSBURY, and wondering what it is he
is murmuring in response. GRIMTHORPE,
hardened by exceptional enormity of
his guilt, conscious that he can expect
no mercy from a majority whose over-
whelming number he has on several
occasions illegally reduced by one, ven-
tures upon explanation and extenuation.
It was alleged that, in addition to
voting for the Government, he had out-
raged the law after having been warned
of the illegality of his action.
“It is true,” he pleaded, “that whilst
I was washing my hands a noble Lord
asked me if I had taken the oath. I
took the remark at the time as a joke.
I fancied he was trying to pull my leg.
I thought no more about it till the Clerk
called my attention to the situation, and
then,” he added, rattling his chains
with gesture of despair, “I knew it was
no joke.”
Noble Lords assented to the reason-
ableness of this last conclusion. As
“The Tenth never dance,” so Clerks at
the Table never joke. But it was felt
there was some weakness in the earlier
part of the unhappy Peer's statement.
Why, because he chanced to be washing
his hands, should he misconstrue a
friendly warning as a feeble joke? Then
there was hopeless muddle of metaphor
in the reference to his various limbs.
Why, when washing his hands he should
think a noble Lord was pulling his leg,
was a sequence of ideas that did not
commend itself to the logical mind.
The end of the business was that Lord
RIPON withdrew his proposal to get rid
of the matter by amending the division
lists; agreed to refer the matter to a
Committee. Thereupon the House turned
with renewed energy to the exhilarating
business of battering the Education Bill.
Business dome. --In the Commons
Trade Disputes Bill passed Report Stage.
ATTORNEY-GENERAL explains that when at
earlier stage he argued against immunity
of Trades Union Funds from action at
law he did not mean to debar himself
from subsequently insisting upon the
justice of such immunity.
Tuesday might.—Rather the fashion
Just now to speak disrespectfully of the
House of Lords regarded as a business
assembly. Its procedure certainly is a
little quaint. But, as Bishop of St.
ASAPH knows, it can upon occasion
promptly, resolutely stand up for princi-
ples of lºw and order.
After House had been cleared for one
of several divisions taken to-night, the
Bishop bethought him of something
he might have contributed to debate.
Rising with air of conviction that dis-
tinguished him when he was Select
Preacher to the Universities, extending
his right hand as if about to bestow
preliminary benediction, he began his
speech. To his surprise he was met by
cries of “Order | Order " '' -
As the Vicar of GoRLESTON said about
the Episcopal Bench as a body, a good
heart beats below the gaiters of St.
ASAPH. But this really too much for
most angelic temper. A constant visitor
to Peers' Gallery in the Commons, he
was not unfamiliar with what he would
not call turbulent, much less rowdy,

interruption. Was it possible that the
House of Lords, inoculated with the
spirit of disorder, deliberately selected
a right reverend Prelate as the subject
of its sportiveness?
“Sit down and put on your hat,” a
lay brother whispered.
That all very well. But what if he
had no hat? When Bishops put on
their surplices they don't crown the
seemly edifice with a topper.
The Bishop saw it all now. In the
Lords, as in the Commons, if a Member
desires to offer remark after division
has been called he must, in accordance
with antique undated ordinance, remain
seated with his hat on. The Bishop ac-
cordingly sat down wistfully and thought
of his hat left with his umbrella in the
robing room. Three Peers proffered
loan of a hat. The vision of a surpliced
Bishop offering a few remarks from
under a silk hat--" This style, 10s. 6d.,”
as the Mad Hatter's whom Alice met in
Wonderland was labelled—was too sear-
ing. The Bishop declined the hat and
sacrificed his speech.

House of Commons, Friday.—Every-
body knows when a door is not a door.
Novel turn of ancient problem sprung
upon Commons. “When is a part of
the House outside the precincts of the
House?”
Case arises in connection with dis-
covery of clerks from several State
Departments seated in pen behind
SPEAKER's Chair. This the result of
LULU's masterpiece of strategy, whereby
these gentlemen, accustomed through the
ages to find seats under the Strangers'
venient contiguity
with their chiefs
on Treasury
Bench.

dest depths the
prejudices of those

how, when meet-
ing natives on the
Ghats as they pass
homeward from
their morning
bath in the sacred
Ganges, the dusky
devotee shrinks
close to the wall
lest he suffer loss
of caste by casual touch with an unbe-
liever. So these champions of privilege
shrink, not only from possible touch, but
from actual sight, of strangers seated
within the sacred precincts of the House.
“I spy strangers,” said TURNOUR,
confident in the hoary experience of
his third year of membership. As for
CLAUDE HAY, he backed his noble young
friend up with reference to Standing
Order 273, whose dictum he proceeded
to read.
“Are we to understand,” he sternly
asked, “that Standing Order 273 is
practically repealed ?”
“No,” the SPEAKER drily answered.
“There is no Standing Order 273.
There are only 96 Standing Orders.”
For once in a modest career CIATDE
HAY was shut up. In excess of zeal he
had seen more than double. As for that
veteran Parliamentarian the Wiscount,
the SPEARER ruled that a recent division
established the position that, provisionally
at least, the pen behind SPEAKER's chair
is not a part of the House. Argal, the
presence of Strangers there is not a breach
of privilege.
The SPEAKER proving thus virtuous,
there will be no more cakes and ale in
the form of daily spying strangers as
soon as questions are disposed of.

SPORT FOR PLUTOCRATS.
OUR Mr. SMITH left Euston for Holy-
head the other day. He may have set
out in search of pleasure or he may
have set out in answer to the call of
duty. Possibly, having stepped into a
railway carriage merely to see for himself
if railway carriages were all that they
were popularly supposed to be, he was
whisked off before he knew anything
about it. We do not know why Our Mr.
SMITH undertook the journey and proba-
bly Our Mr. SMITH does not know himself.
How then can you expect to know?
The first thing that caught the eye
of Our Mr. SMITH as (for reasons un-
known) he got into the carriage was
the communication cord. Communication
cords exercise a strong fascination over
all human beings, and Our Mr. SMITH
was essentially human.
“Ah,” he said, “it is a cord.
not pull it?”
On pulling it Our Mr. SMITH was
delighted to discover that the cord was
loose, so he went on pulling till he met
with resistance. From that moment he
felt that there was someone pulling at
the other end, and redoubled his efforts
accordingly. Sometimes he gained,
sometimes he lost an inch or two, but
on the whole he maintained the S.Q.A.
Finally he was interrupted by the genial
voice of the Guard.
“Your little joke,” said the latter,
“appeals to me thoroughly, but the
man at the other end, a dull fellow,
is becoming annoyed. It is his busi-
ness to get that cord taut before the
train starts. Now, it is also his business
to test the wheels of the carriages, and
for the latter purpose he is furnished
with a weighty and dangerous imple-
ment. Incidentally, he is a burly indi-
vidual with rather a quick temper. I
think that I should let go if I were you.”
“All,” said Our Mr. SMITH, as he relin-
quished his hold, “I thought from his
repeated jerks that he was getting cross,
but I did not know that he was armed.”
Shortly afterwards the train seized its
opportunity and started.
Have you ever noticed the roving
disposition of the eye of Our Mr. SMITH'
But no, of course you cannot have done
so, for you have never even seen Our
Mr. SMITH. Then you will have to take
our word for it that Our Mr. SMITH's eye
would not desist from roving, and the
next object that caught its attention was
the other communication cord.
“Ah,” said Our Mr. SMITH, “I wonder
if there is any one at the other end of
this.” He pulled it, the train stopped,
and the Guard reappeared at the
window.
“Ah,” said Our Mr. SMITH, “were you
at the other end this time?”
“Oddly enough,” said the Guard, “I

was. However, anticipating something
of this sort, I tied my end of the cord to
the door-handle. Do you think the joke
was worth repeating?”
“Ah,” said Our Mr. SMITH--a most
objectionable habit of his “perhaps it
was not. I am sorry. Let the train
proceed.”
So the train pushed on, but not for
any great distance. Our Mr. SMITH could
not get away from those cords, and,
before he knew it, he had pulled again.
“No joke,” said the Guard, “is worth
playing three times.”
“Joking apart,” said Our Mr. SMITH,
“you never told me what the cords were
really for.”
“My dear fellow,” said the Guard,
“how can I ever forgive myself? Let
me explain the whole thing to you.”
And he gave a detailed history of the
idea, and thoroughly explained the work-
ing of it. He even read and elucidated
the notice underneath, which he humor-
ously referred to as the “directions on
the bottle.” “Observe,” he said, “how
the Company has, by substituting chain
for communication-cord and slightly
accentuating the down, transformed an
otherwise prosy notice into an exquisite
couplet, thus:-
“To stop the train
Pull down the chain.”
Fiually, the tact with which he called
attention to the Improper-Use-É5-a-Time
clause was admirable. Our Mr. SMITH
was quite touched by his politeness.
“No,” he said, “ you need not go over
it all a third time.”
“If you are quite sure that there is
nothing more that you want,” said the
Guard, “we will be getting on. But
remember, if you need anything you
have only to pull the cord.”
The train had barely got up full speed
again when Our Mr. SMITH pulled for
the fourth time.
“You did not tell me,” he said to the
Guard, “which cord to pull.”
“Either,” said the Guard as he started
the train again.
It would be tedious to relate the
details of every occasion on which Our
Mr. SMITH pulled those cords. Suffice
it that he displayed a lively interest in
all the places of note en route. At each
stop the Guard proved to be a mine of
information, and had no difficulty in
answering Our Mr. SMITH's searching
questions. The two of them even
entered into arguments, maintained on
both sides with perfect good taste and
moderation, on the more obscure points
that cropped up.
Twice only was there any friction.
The first time it was at Colwyn Bay,
where Our Mr. SMITH had set his heart
on having a bathe. For this purpose
he desired the train to wait for him,
but the train would not.
“It is not for ourselves that we mind,”
said the Guard, “but there happens to
be a boat waiting for us at Holyhead, and
those nautical fellows are so particular.”
“If that is all,” said Our Mr. SMITH,
as he began to undress, “the boat need
not wait. I am not crossing to-night.”
“No” replied the Guard — almost
rudely, Our Mr. SMITH thought—“but
some of the other passengers are.”
The second time it was at the Menai
Straits. So pleased was Our Mr. SMITH
with the Tubular Bridge that he wanted
to go back and have the fun all over
again.
“Though we are the Irish Mail,” said
the Guard, “and though we do prefer

going straight ahead, we have never-
theless shown ourselves ready to stop
as often as you liked. But we draw
the line at going backwards.”
Our Mr. SMITH was a sensitive man
and did not pull the cords again till
just before Holyhead.
“My bill, please, Guard,” he said as
that official's head appeared at the
window.
The Guard handed in the account.
“Ah,” said Our Mr. SMITH once more
as he wrote out the cheque, “you have
not charged for this last stop.”
“You have been a good customer,”
said the Guard (thus showing that he,
at any rate, bore no malice), “we will
say nothing about that.”

time it is a rissole of SARDOU's Fédora,
to be washed down with water from the
Jordan (acqua da GIORDANO). Something,
I suppose, in its scheme of passionately
conflicting emotions attracted the com-
poser. “Here,” he said, “is ready-made
stuff for opera.” But it never seems to
have occurred to him that the dull
intervals of prosy dialogue which may
be necessary to the evolution of the plot
of a drama are not the most likely

Regarded as matter for Grand Opera,
this is hardly up to the level of OLLEN-
DORFF at his best. I am not surprised at
the splendid reception which the gallery
gave to Signor Giordaxo. He is a brave
man. And I hope he may never become
a coward through catching too keen a
sense of humour.
The main motive of the plot is suffi-
ciently strong, but for half the time –
and the opera consists largely of intervals
—it is eked out with superfluous charac-
ters and incidents.
Much that was meant for dramatic
force was mere staginess; as in the
popular appeal at the close of more than
one of the brief arias in the First Act;
the sudden orchestral explosion which
punctuates the moment when Fédora
kisses her Byzantime cross; the rather
too obvious contrast between the tragic
confession in the foreground of the ball-
room and the gay applause of the
maestro's rendering of Chopin ; and
finally the very banal conclusion that
follows Fédora's death.
Signora GIACHETTI's acting redeemed
the opera from commonplace. It was a
pure joy to watch her eyes, so eloquent of
every passing phase of emotion. Signor
ZENATELLO was not at his very happiest.
I think he must have shared my dislike
of the cut of his evening coat. Signor
SCANDIANI, who was more comfortably
served in this matter, was sufficiently
gallant in his eulogy of the duplex
Russian woman:-
La donna russa e femina due volte.
But I did not care for him in the forced
frivolity of the Third Act, where his cos-
tume of a cavalier in a bowler hat, lightish
kid gloves, improbable gaiters and spurs
looked rather silly against a background
of Swiss lake and precipice. There was
some tampering here with the stage
directions, which order De Sirier to enter
“in costume da ciclista,” and Olga to
elope with him on her bicicletta, “ in
costume da ‘sportswoman.’” There was
nothing to show whether Signora
GARAVAGLIA recoiled from bloomers as

PUNCH, OR
FROM THE DIARY OF YOUNG
NORWAY.
[By an enterprise unprecedented in the annals
of journalism, our representative forestalled the
special correspondent of The Daily Mirror last
week, and obtained the following extract from
Prince OLAF's diary, by methods into which it
is no business of ours to inquire. This inter-
esting fragment from the pen of the illustrious
visitor to our shores will doubtless be the more
eagerly per used on account of the fact that it
was not written for publication.]
Sunday.—Haven't been seasick yet.
Hope nothing happens before I get to
England. Papa and Mamma are com-
ing with me, although I told them it
wasn't really necessary. Expect Grand-
pa will be there to meet us, as I’m his
grandson and Mamma's his daughter.
Monday.—Don’t think much of Grand-
pa's yacht; it won't keep still. Did not
lunch with Papa and Mamma to-day;
did not lunch at all—first time I have
missed in three years. I hate the sea
and don't want to be a sea-king. If I
can't be a king without being a sea-king,
I want to be an engine-driver. Uncle
GEORGE met us at Portsmouth. He's a
Prince like me. But his Papa and
Mamma don't follow him about every-
where he goes. He didn't give me half-
a-crown, although he's my Uncle. Asked
Papa if he was a real Uncle. Papa said
yes; so don't see how he can get out of it.
There's one tune the band keeps on play-
ing which I don't like. Not a bad tune
really, but every time I hear it I have to
stop whatever I'm doing, and stand quite
still with my hand to my head, until it's
over. Don't know why, but I get into
such a row if I don't do it. They played
it when Uncle turned up. When I'm
King I won't have any nonsense of that
sort. Grandpa's a King, like Papa.
They played that tune again at Windsor,
and I pretended not to hear it. I like
Grandma awfully, although she didn't
give me half-a-crown. She kissed me in
front of all the people. If I can't be
an engine-driver I'd like to be a Mayor.
People in streets seemed glad to see me;
I stood on the seat and bowed all the
way to the Castle. Mounted policeman
would be rather a nice thing to be. My

till the tune stopped, so I won. Looked
at newspapers. I like them taking a
lot of notice of me, but don't see why
they should keep on calling me a “pretty

Wednesday.—Papa and Mamma went
with Uncle GEORGE and Auntie MAY to a
place called London. Wanted to go too.
Papa said he was awfully sorry, but
there wouldn't be room for me at
luncheon. They got back in afternoon.
They had to eat soup made of tortoises,
so I am glad I didn't go. Papa brought
back a gold box. I wanted it to keep
dominoes in. It's really for cigarettes.
I expect I shall get it if I keep on at
him. Last night, Grandpa gave Papa a
garter, but I haven't had any half-crown
yet. Of course, nobody can see Papa's
garter when he wears it, so he wears a
sash, just to show that he's got one.
I should have chosen a pony myself.

an Auto-altruist.
He never wantonly kills anybody.
If he injures a fellow-creature (and this will always be the
fellow-creature's fault) he voluntarily buys him a princely
annuity. In the case of a woman, if she is irreparably
disfigured by the accident, he will, supposing he has no
other wife at the time, offer her the consolation of marriage
with himself.
He regards the life of bird and beast as no less sacred
than that of human beings. Should he inadvertently break
a fowl or pig he will convey it to the nearest veterinary
surgeon and i. the broken limb set or amputated as the
injury may require. In the event of death or permanent
damage, he will seek out the owner of the dumb animal, and
refund him fourfold.
To be on the safe side with respect to the legal limit, the
PERFECT AUTOMOBILIST confines himself to a speed of ten miles
per hour. He will even dismount at the top of a steep
descent, so as to lessen the impetus due to the force of gravity.
If he is compelled by the nature of his mission to exceed
the legal limit (as when hurrying, for instance, to fetch a
doctor in a matter of life or death, or to inform the Govern-
ment of the landing of a hostile force) he is anxious not to
shirk the penalty. He will, therefore, send on a swift
messenger to warn the police to be on the look-out for him ;
and if 5. fails to run into any trap he will, on returning,
report himself at all the police-stations on his route, or com-
municate by post with the constabularies of the various
counties through which he may have passed.
At the back of his motor he carries a watering-cart attach-
ment for the laying of dust before it has time to be raised.
Lest the noise of his motor should be a cause of distraction
he slows down when passing military bands, barrel-organs,
churches (during the hours of worship), the Houses of
Parliament (while sitting), motor-buses, the Stock Exchange,
and open-air meetings of the unemployed.
If he meets a restive horse he will turn back and go down
a side road and wait till it has passed. If all the side roads
are occupied by restive horses he will go back home ; and if
the way home is similarly barred he will turn into a field.
He encourages his motor to break down frequently ; be-
cause this spectacle affords an innocent diversion to many
whose existence would otherwise be colourless.
It is his greatest joy to give a timely lift to weary pedes-
trians, such as tramps, postmen, sweeps, and police-trap
detectives; even though, the car being already full, he is
himself compelled to get out and do the last fifty or sixty
miles on foot.
He declines to wear goggles because they conceal the
natural benevolence of the human eye divine, which he
regards as the window of the soul; also (and for the same
reason he never wears a fur overcoat) because they accentuate
class distinctions.

was cleverer not to do things than to do them has passed.
In that old day (whose fruitfulness was its barrenness), in
the glorious eighties and early nineties, one sat tight and
refrained, and gathered a great reputation by so doing. By
never having a play produced one could be known as a very
exceptional dramatic force; by keeping one's mouth shut one
was thought a very Solos ; by merely inverting a proverb

a very dangerous one. Details were important then, and

make money where we used to make epigrams. The young
men who are not active are lost. It is the age of braininess
(as distinguished from brains) and pushfulness. The age of
the hustler. No one who whispers is heard. In the old
days, in the eighties and early nineties, the whisperer spoke
the loudest. But now . . Look at me, where I am writing.
What will you? We must belong to our times. Here
am I–I, MAx, the most famous of the refrainers, the most
accomplished artist of all in the cult of acquiring a reputation
by the minimum of effort—here am I in The Daily Mail

Dieppe, with jocular sauce for the halfpenny groundlings.
What will you?
To tell truth, it was time I went to France. All the
others had been ; I alone was left; and—with all these new
notions as to efficiency about—it was getting to be ridiculous

delays, as of a Piccadilly always “up.”
As I thought about it, standing there in the booking-office
with my new Baedeker in my hand, I wondered if it were tº
late to turn back. Perhaps my friends had been right, after
all. I, personally, had been much delighted by the prospect
of this journey, this emprise. But my good news had been
received very gravely by everyone to whom I toll it.
Instead of the rather envious congratulations that might
have been looked for, I seemed to evoke nothing but pity
and awe-pity for my fate, awe at my bravery in facing it.

we had been so long in the train and I had read my
Baedeker so assiduously that I had come to believe myself in
very France indeed. And here at Newhaven, when I thought
to step out of the train into that glowing courteous land, I
found I was still in England the grey and desolate, and four
hours of the dreariest element ever created separated me from
my new raptures. I looked out the words “resignation ” and
“courage" in my pocket dictionary, and repeated them to
myself until they dominated my brain. “Resignation, courage;
courage, resignation,” I said, over and over. By a stroke of
luck, such as I must confess I rarely experience, both words
are the same in French as in English, but with a slight dis-
tinction in the pronunciation.

CHAPTER IX.
The Eminences of London.
LoNDON, like the Eternal City—as Mr.
HALL CAINE has somewhere remarked
in one of his most impressive passages—
is built upon seven hills, viz., Campden
Hill, Denmark Hill, Haverstock Hill,
Highgate Hill, Lavender Hill, Notting
Hill, and Primrose Hill. There are, it
is true, other gentle eminences such as
Hornsey Rise, Brixton Hill, Ludgate
Hill, Pentonville Hill, Lord ARTHUR
HILL, and the famous Roman Catholic
persiflagiste, Mr. BELLAIRs HILLock, but
the seven hills that count are those that
we have named.
The bold contours of Primrose Hill,
a dome-shaped eminence of
volcanic origin, render it one
of the most attractive fea-
tures in the landscape of
the North-Western district.
The best approach is by
Rosebery Avenue, and to
view it right one should
choose the occasion of one
of the periodical beanfeasts
of the Liberal League, when
its summit presents an as-
pect of great animation. The
ascent is steep, but climbers
can dispense with a rope,
which, however, is indispen-
sable on Haverstock Hill, a
favourite resort of Alpinists
and rock-climbers. Indeed,
etymologists are not wanting
who assert that the name
is a blend of Haversack and Alpenstock.
Campden Hill, which can be ap-
proached either on foot or in a hired
vehicle, has a twofold title to distinc-
tion. Its proximity to Holland Park
endears it to all Liberals, while as a
favourite haunt of artists and literary
men it exhales an atmosphere of culture.
Though easily within the four-mile
radius, it contains several noble resi-
dences standing in their own grounds,
with extensive lawns, shrubberies, and
even forest trees. It is surmounted with
a noble reservoir, stocked with rainbow
trout, eels and other fish, in which first-
rate angling can be had by the per-
mission of the ground landlord, Mr.
JUSTICE PHILLIMORE; and many are the
Waltonians who come here. It was
here that Mr. BULLEN landed his first
cachalot.
Students of seismology find Campden
Hill a peculiarly congenial habitat owing
to the tremors produced by the Under-

OUR UNTRUST WORTHY ARTIST IN
The QUADRANGLE of The Roy AL WETERINARY College, CAMDEN Town.
CHARLES STANFORD, and postillions are to
be observed all day long in Church
Street.
There is one other point to be
mentioned in connection with Campden
Hill. If you are not very articulate in
giving your instructions to your cab-
man, it is more than probable that he
will transport you to Camden Town.
Should this happen, do not fail to pay
a visit to the famous Veterinary College
and Horsepital, which, if the metaphor
be allowed, is one of the lions of the
neighbourhood, as well as a triumph
of civilisation. Here you will have an
opportunity of seeing and conversing
with quadrupeds in every stage of decline
and convalescence. You will see horses
and oxen in bed, in splints, in bath-
chairs, almost in every conceivable posi-
tion except in a teacup.
Campden Hill is connected by a
SL*
–
eneraa-
narrow spur with the twin peak of
Notting Hill, and in frosty weather
excellent toboganning can be had down
the east and west sides of Campden
Hill Square into the Uxbridge Road–
a sport in which Mr. CHESTERTON, the
Napoleon of Notting Hill, has long ex-
hibited a remarkable proficiency.
Denmark Hill, which is rife with
Scandinavian associations, involves a
trip across or under the river, but richly
repays the perils of transit. It has long
been famous as the rendezvous par
excellence of the dramatic profession.
On its upper slopes, when the weather
is not too inclement, you may encounter
Miss EDNA MAY, conning her part in
Romeo and Juliet or some other Shak-
spearian play, Mr. CHARLES FROHMAN
meditating his next presentation, Mr.
SIDNEY LEE musing on the cares of
trusteeship, or Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER
engaged in a friendly bout of jiu-jitsu
with Mr. TREE or Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT.
The “Elsinore Arms”--a sumptuously
appointed temperance hotel — is a
favourite haunt of Mr. BERNARD SHAw,
and here, when he rides down to court
the local Muse, Mr. HALL CAINE never
fails to stable his Shetland pony. Brix-
ton Hill, another gentle acclivity on the
Surrey side, is within easy walking
distance, while of Lavender Hill it is
enough to say that it fully equals the
odorous anticipation excited by its name.
SURPLUSAGE.
“My number,” said the polite member
of The Times Book Club, “my number
I have for the moment forgotten. It
begins with a ‘Z,’ ends with a nought,
and contains a number of 6's and 7's
scattered here and there throughout the
whole. Please give me a book.”
“Owing to the lamentable conduct of
the Publishers,” answered the still more
polite Attendant, “we have at present
no books to give you. Will you accept
instead a pound of butter?"
“Anything,” said the
member, “to oblige a lady
and to spite Mr. PoulTEN.
But why butter?”
What do you suppose
that member's number was 2
Speaking candidly, do
you think that he really
had a number?
I am a member of The
Times Book Club, but I
have never seen Mr. PoulteN.
I have stopped men in the
street and have said to
them, “Are you Mr. Poul-
TEN ?” I have gathered
from their answers that they
were not (by a long way) Mr.
PoulteN. “Then,” I have
said to them, “how would
you like to be an Admiral ”
I may add that I have gathered also
from these chance encounters much in-
teresting information regarding my own
parentage and my probable prospects
in the hereafter.
But what has this to do with the
case? Nothing. What I want to say
is this:–I am a member of The Times
Book Club (have I said this before?)
and yet I have not written to the papers
about it. Why should not I write to
the papers? Why should a hearing be
denied me? Why should “T.123456789,
&c.,” have his say, and not I? Why,
indeed ?
I desire to express 'my entire and
cordial agreement with ſeverything that
has been said on both sides of this con-
troversy, and to add on my own behalf
the above episode which I have invented
for the occasion. Having little or no
point it will (I hope) successfully baffle
both parties.
For the present I can think of nothing
further to say on the subject. -

[November 21, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PROGRESSIVE BRIDGE.
THERE were twelve tables numbered
A, B, C up to-well, twelve of them ;
and I started at E because my name is
ERNEST. Our host arranged us, and of
course he may have had quite another
scheme in his mind. If so, it was an
extraordinary coincidence that my part-
ner's name was ETHEL. She herself
swore it was MILLICENT, but I doubt if
one can trust a woman in these matters.
She looked just like an ETHEL. I had
never seen her before, I shall never see
her again, but she will always be ETHEL
to me. - -
There is only one rule at Progressive
Bridge, and that is that if you lose you
go on to the next table, and if you win
you stay where you are. In any case
you get a fresh partner each time. That
being so, it seemed hardly worth while
to ask ETHEL what she discarded from.
As it happened, though, she began it.
“I discard from strength,” she said.
“So do I,” I agreed gladly. We
already had a lot in common. “Great
strength returns the penny,” I added.
“What's that ?”
“Moderate strength rings the bell.
It's a sort of formula I say to myself,
and brings luck. May I play to hearts?”
ETHEL discarded a small heart on the
first round of clubs, and a small club
on the first round of hearts. After
which, systematically and together, we
discarded from great weakness. What
with the revoke and other things they
scored hundreds and thousands that
game. -
“You know, where Providence goes
wrong,” I said, “is in over-estimating
our skill. Providence thinks too highly
of us. It thinks that if it gives us a
knave and two tens between us we can
get a grand slam.”
“Yes; and I think—I think, perhaps,
that just the least little bit it underrates
DOROTHY's abilities.”
“Indeed 2'' I said. DoRo THY was the
person who had just taken 298 off us.
“Yes. You see, DoRo THY has played
before. I don't think Providence knew
that.”
“It rather looks like that.”
“Mind,” said ETHEL graciously, “I
don't blame Providence for not knowing.”
DoROTHY laughed, and cut for me. I
dealt myself three aces, and went no
trumps. To my surprise DoROTHY's
I artner doubled, and led the ace of
hearts.
“One moment,” I said, and I took it
up, and looked at the back of it. Then
I looked at the back of my own ace of
hearts. Then I looked at the front of it
again, and swore very softly, and played
it.
“I’m very sorry,” I apologised at the
end of the game. “I had a wolf in
sheep's clothing, an ass in a lion's skin.
You saw me play the three of hearts?
Well, do you know–it 's very sad–he
actually pretended to be the ace. Hid
his head behind one card, and his feet
behind another, and only — well, I
thought it was the ace.”
At the end of the round ETHEL and I
moved on.
“Good bye,” I said to DoRothy, “I
like watching you play. If you wait
here I shall be round again soon.”
My next partner was called AGGIE.
ETHEL addressed her as MARY, but she
was much too lively for MARY. I had
never seen her before, I shall never see
her again, but she will always be AGGIE
to line.
She began at once.
“I discard from weakness, partner.
I like hearts led, I never go spades on
my own, I live on tapioca and toad-
stools, and the consequence was -–"
“It's the same with me,” I said,
“except about tapioca. I don't like
tapioca. In fact I always -er–discard
from tapioca. Otherwise we agree.
It's your deal. Now,” I said to ETHEL,
“we shall see what Providence thinks
of our comparative merits.”
Providence made no mistake. In
the whole round my partner and I
scored once only. Chicame in spades.
I moved on to G. I should never see
ETHEL again.
“I always play the Canadian dis-
card,” said VIOLET, “and I like spades
led.”
I need hardly say that AGGIE, whom
ETHEL called MARY, spoke of VIOLET as
MARGERY. But she looked much more like
VIOLET, and she will always be VIOLET
to me. I had never seen her before,
though, and I shall never see her again.
“So do I,” I said. “Do you know
Canada at all? I always wish I had
been there.”
“I go a good deal to Switzerland,”
said VIOIET. “Are you fond of Bridge?”
“No, never; that is, I mean, ‘Wery.'
Shall we cut '2''
The “Canadian discard ” hardly does
itself justice under that name. It is no
mere discard, but embraces all the finer
points of Bridge. It leads through
weakness, and blocks your partner's
long suits, and trumps his tricks; and,
though I couldn't discover any recognised
system about it, revokes now and then.
I too, from tact or sympathy, or some
such motive, played the Canadian discard
for all I was worth. We got to II
without any difficulty. . . . .
J, K, and L may be passed by, for
nothing much happened there. For
some reason “I” was left out, or rather,
run into J. I cannot understand the
point of this. To every man his table,
and I feel convinced that I should have
done renº kably well at “I.” I had
been looking forward to it all the even-
ing. I don't much care about betting,
but I am prepared to wager a hundred
pounds that I should have got a grand
slam at “I.”
It was somewhere down in the X's
that I met MAUD. I had been round I
don't know how many times, and was
feeling quite giddy. ALICE, ELIZABETH,
IRIs, MABEL–they were all forgotten when
I came to play with MAUD. HEpzibah
(on my right) called her MILLICENT or
something like that, but I knew really
that her name must be MAUD. I had
never seen her before, I shall never see
her again, but she will always be MAUD
to me.
“I discard from hearts,” I said. “I
like my weakest suit led, I have revoked
three times this evening, at table G on
the right-hand side of the fireplace I
played the ‘Canadian discard ' and I
shall never play it again, at K as you
go round the lamp I had four aces and
my partner went spades, I've had rotten
luck all through, and I'm enjoying
myself very much. Shall we be very
cautious, or would you like to play a
dashing game * *
“Oh, let's dash,” said MAUD.
I dealt, and went no trumps on two
aces. To my great surprise HEPzBAH's
partner doubled and led the ace of clubs.
“One moment,” I said, and I took it
up, and looked at the back of it. Then
I looked at the back of my own ace of
clubs. Then I looked at the front of it,
and swore very softly, and played it.
“I’m very sorry,” I began at the end
of the game, “but---"
“Haven't we met before ?” said MAUD,
with a smile.
I looked at her hard. “By Jove!
ETHEL!” I cried.
“My name's MILLICENT,” said MAUD,
“and seeing that we met for the first
time a few hours ago ----"
“Yes, you were my first partner.
'THEL.”
“I’m sorry. Who is ETHEL2"
“I beg your pardon,” I apologised.
“But I always call my first partner at
Progressive Bridge ETHEL. It's a sort
of hobby with me.”
“I see,” said MAUD I mean ETHEL.
Well, I suppose I must call her MILLICENT
now. Though I had never seen her
before, and shall never see her again,
she will always be MILLICENT to me.

THE RAID AND THE RAIN.
ON Thursday last in Westminster there was something curious
brewing ; -
You might have seen with half an eye that people were up
and doing.
A sort of tension there was in the air, a sort of terrible feeling,
Made up of a wish to slap a face and to start a bout of
squealing,
And to scratch out eyes, and to tear out hair, and to fly into
a passion,
And to scream for votes with a feminine voice in a most
unpleasant fashion ;
And to seize on men and to give them fits and talk to them
out of season,
As creatures who must be brought to own the might of a
woman's reason.
And here and there in the murky air of a mid-November
noon-tide
Queer resolute shapes were flitting about with their hair done
flat and their shoon tied.
And they all looked fierce as fierce can be, and Inspector
SCANTLEBURY,
When he saw them flitting about the place, he didn't look
very merry.
For he had felt how a woman slaps when on the tiled floor
slipping
He fell on his back and lay there flat, and (oh, but the sight
was ripping !)
The feminine host bore down on him with the force of an
angry pale storm - -
And slapped his face, as he lay supine, till it sounded like a
hail-storm. - -
So he says to his men, the Inspector says, “We can't let the
women shout here;
And if,” he says, “they're for getting in, you must all of you
keep 'em out here. -
They may howl for votes if they like,” he says, “until they
have spoilt their beauty;
But they shan't howl here in the Commons' House, so, men,
you must do your duty.”
Then the desperate DESPARD came by stealth and the
passionate PANKHURST peered in,
And motor-cars brought a good score more, as to Westminster
they steered in,
And things began to look very black, and the clerks of the
House were quaking,
And the members were blue and green with fear, and the
SPEAKER himself was shaking.
When all of a sudden the rain, the rain oh, then there began
a hurry,
For the ladies put their umbrellas up and then they started
to scurry;
And DESPARD scattered and PANKHURST flew, and the rest of
them said, “It’s no go,”
And fled like the Russian fleet pursued by the guns of the
gallant ToGo. -
So that was the end of the female raid and the threats that
were said in vain there
When the draggled women they turned for home as they felt
the pitiless rain there.
“Traveller wanted, to push motor accessory.”—Daily Telegraph.
IT is well said that what is the poor man's work is often
the rich man's recreation.

about the matter.” CREwe, in charge of
Bill, declared against something or other.
STANLEY of ALDERIEY flashed happy
thought through murky atmosphere.
Suppose we don't substitute a clause?
Why have a Clause 7 ?
Noble Lords inclined to jump at this
conclusion. It would save a lot of
trouble. Would also establish happy
precedent. Paper bristled with amend-
ments to subsequent clauses. If the
problems were easy, capable of being
understanded of the Peerage, well and
good. If not, off with their heads.

throw responsibility on ChairMAN of

“Your Lordships,” he said with freez-

position. If you will indicate on which
amendment you propose to divide, I will
submit it.”
A dead silence followed. Had hoped
for better things from CHAIRMAN drawing
salary of £2500 a year, paid quarterly.
The PRIMATE looked at Leader of Oppo-
sition. LANsiowNE suddenly displayed
absorbing interest in structure of the
Woolsack. St. ALDwyN proved master
of situation. His amendment, having
been moved last in a long series, still
(to a certain extent) lingered in the
memory. It was accordingly put from
Chair, and, by a majority of 151 to
43, the clause, to quote the official
reports, “was agreed to down to the
words and that.'”
“What clause is it 2"

shall he have who killed the deer ?”
In the matter of deer taken in New
Forest short shrift and the gallows were
of old time decreed. HobART testified
that he had not seen any deer in the New

tation of his native heath, told how his
constituents were occasionally provided
with venison pasty, consequent upon deer
escaping from the Forest and rooting
up their garden cabbages. By ancient
custom they were in such circumstances
permitted to slay the deer. Wonderful
what a passion the deer displayed for
certain cabbage tracts.

ordered speech, over
whose attenuated
sentences helingers

were the men of the
hour, not to say an
hour and twenty
minutes. The
Colonel rose to the
occasion, many
times to his feet.
Day was breaking
over distant Prim-

was up again, good
for another forty
minutes. Hardly
had he opened his
mouth when a voice
from the neighbour-
hood below Gang-

FLAVIN lounged, in-

quiry, “What have you done to HoRNE 2"
The remark obviously irrelevant. It
might with equal point have taken the
form, “What did you do with the North
Pole?” Its effect on the Colonel extra-
ordinary. Forgetting for moment ini-

closely conning the Bill, jumped up white heat of anger retaining his ornate

Tuesday, 9.40 A.M.–As HART DYKE
would say if he were still with us, the

worm. Through the fog, clamouring
for cabs, hurried a long line of legis-

crumpled state added final touch of un-
canniness to the spectacle. House been
sitting all night with incidental refer-
ence to Land Tenure Bill. A dreary'
performance that might have been
avoided by exercise of a little tact. Only
rson who really enjoyed himself was
r. FLAVIN, and in his case perfect satis-
faction was marred by non-appearance
on scene of the police. Still he made the
best of it, interrupting Members all round,
and having great game with KENYoN-

a slanderer.” Irish Members, properly
shocked at anything approaching dis-
orderly language, insisted on the p
being withdrawn. The DEPUTY-CHAIRMAN
ruling it out of order, the Colonel, more
sinned against than sinning, was com-
º to retract before proceeding with
his speech.
CLAUDE HAY rising once or twice in
effort to look over PRINCE ARTHUR's head
and count number of Ministers on
Treasury Bench was accosted from Irish
º with the cry, “Sit down, LITTLE
TICH.”
This greatly tickled the fancy of
drowsy members.
Otherwise a dreary sitting, a waste
of time and tissue, no credit to House,
a distinct rebuff to the Government.
Business done.--Sat up all night with
the Land Tenure Bill.

|Members of House of Commons, look-
ing on from Gallery over Bar, marvel
at the change that has overtaken him
since he came into the Marquisate.
Whilst he was still with us, seated on
Treasury Bench, he rarely took part in
debate. In the Lords he-like, yet how
unlike, GLADSTONE going from Oxford
to Lancashire—is unmuzzled.
Handicapped by Ministerial responsi-
bility, he was never able to let himself
go. Began well enough. There was
the famous outburst of pride and
patriotism that marked an early stage
of his Under Secretaryship for Foreign
Affairs. It happened long before the
war with IRussia presented Japan in a
new light. Some inquisitive Member
asked what progress was being made
in the direction of securing a Treaty
between Japan and Great Britain.
“Great Britain,” loftily replied Lord
CRANDORNE, “grants treaties, she does
not ask for them.”
That too much even for the PREMIER.
The MARKiss not lacking in sympathy
with the utterer of blazing indiscretion.
Secretly proud of the demonstration of
soundness of the chip of an old block.
But foreign nations have absurd sensi-
bilities on these subjects. Accordingly
edict was issued that the UNDER SECRE-
TARY FoR Foreign AFFAIRs should not in
any circumstances make verbal reply to
supplementary questions. With paper
in hand, his answer dictated by the
PERMANENT SECRETARY and supervised by
his Chief, all was well.
In the Lords these restrictions have
vanished with the past. The new
MARKiss sits on the Front Opposition
Bench, none daring to make him afraid.

A certain amount of deference of course
due to his nominal Chief. He venerates
the office of the PRiMATE, but thinks it
might be filled by a more enterprising
Churchman. From time to time he
shows how a House of Commons majority
that lays sacrilegious hands on the Ark
of the Church should be treated.
His style of speech is in its shrill
vehemence reminiscent of the female
suffragists conversing with the police in
the Central Lobby. No one knows to
what length his righteous passion may
lead him. Even when he resumes
his seat there is no immediate surcease
of apprehension. Noble Lords eye him
askance as if apprehensive that he will
produce and wave aloft a banner bearing
the inscription “The Schools for the
Church.” His incursions are embar-
rassing to authority. But in an age of
make-believe, in an atmosphere of cere-
monial, it is refreshing to find a man
who uncompromisingly declares his
belief on questions to the fore. Like

THE country is congratulating itself DEVONNY):
that FERREIRA's Raid has had no such

has not, so far, called forth a poem

Two days after news of the Raid

Highland lady read in her paper, “The

ſº with profound acknowledgment to
“F. L.,” the gifted writer of exotic literary
criticism in The Pall Mall Gazette.]
SIGNOR BALDAss ARO GALUPPI, the eminent
Sinologue, has just brought out an
exhaustive brochure on the influence of
the Goliardic literature on the court
poets of the Manchu dynasty. Like all
that comes from his pen, this elegant
treatise is perfectly charming. With
the antiquarian keenness of scent for
which he is famous, Signor GALUPPI has
been able to establish the identity of
GIRAIDUs CAMBRENSIs with LAMBERTUs
HERTZFELDENsis, and to trace the pedigree
of the eminent American authoress
Mrs. MARY MAPEs DoDGE to WALTER
MAPEs, alias MAP, the famous author of
the Confessio Goliae. As an instance of
Signor GALUPPI's extraordinarily minute
and convincing etymological analysis we
may be permitted to quote his derivation
of King Pepin from the Greek pronoun
dowsp, as thus: Somep, frep, Örep, drep,
diaper, napkin, nipkin, pipkin, pippin-
king, King Pippin.
Professor QUIDDE, the author of the
famous Caligula pamphlet, has been
moved by the publication of the Hohen-
lohe Memoirs to write a study after the
style of PLUTARCH's Lires, contrasting
Count Bülow with VoIGT, the hero of
the KöPENICK raid. He points out that
they are nearly contemporaries, and that
the difference in their subsequent careers
was entirely due to education and en-
vironment. If Count Bülow had been
brought up as a cobbler and Voigt had
been born the son of an ambassador,
Professor QUIDDE is of opinion that it is
quite on the cards that their rôles might
have been reversed. Incidentally he
notices the fact, which has so far escaped
the observation of all publicists, that
KöPENICK is obviously connected with
CoPERNICUs, a discovery which throws
a flood of light on the ultimate trend
of Germany's naval policy.
At a time when there seems to be a
revival of interest in psychical pheno-
mena, it may be well to peruse the
masterly but readable study on Black ||
Magic by M. Uniburu PANGoFFLIN, in
the current number of The Guipuzcoan
Gazette. M. PANGoFFLIN, whose com-
mand of cryptic Basque places him in a
position of peculiar strength as compared
with other writers on the subject, ap-
pears to take the eminently common-sense
view that where the foci in an aplanatic
surface exhibit no radio-activity, it is
permissible to homologate-or comperen-
dinate as the Quinologists have it—a
Mixo-Lydian gambit. Personally we
should like to know what M. BECQUEREL
has to say on this subject.
Other new books, it is true, are an-
nounced, but as they are in English by
English authors they are obviously of
no interest to me or my readers.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN Puck of Pook's Hill (MACMILLAN) Mr. KIPLING's dear
heart has been tugged this way and that by two ruling
passions. He loves to talk with children, and he loves, no
less, to air his erudition (as we all should if we had it). It
results from these divided aims that the stories told by his
“People of the Hills” are often far and far above the heads
of their child-audience, Dan and Uza. The “Old People”
forget how young these Young People are. They may
think they are telling “Plain Tales from the Hills,” but they
are not nearly plain enough. Best of them all, for its
imaginative charm, is the tale of “Dymchurch Flit.” This
really is a plain tale, for there is no hill on Romney Marsh,
whence the little Old People (I suppose it was the local
Sloe Gin that kept them so small) ſlitted to happier lands,
away from the horrors of the Reformation. Wº: fresh,
too, are the stories whose scenes are laid in the latter
end of the Roman occupation of Britain, a period which
hardly anybody has ever expected us to realise as human.
Among many new sensations we are shown how closely the
attitude of the British-born Roman soldier towards his com-
rade from the Motherland may have resembled that of the Colo-
nial trooper towards the home-bred article of to-day. And a
thrill of novel satisfaction went through me when I found
that even Mr. KIPLING was also human, and had made the
mistake that most of us have made at one time or other—
the mistake of supposing that “thumbs down " was the
Roman signal of doom.
I have seen somewhere an advertisement of an article by
Mr. ZANGwill, entitled, “Why Jews fail in business.” Per-
sonally I had no suspicion that commerce was their weak
point. But if there is any co-religionist of Mr. ZANG WILL's who
shares his pessimism, let him read Mr. KIPLING's poem, Song of
the Fifth River, and be comforted. It is one of many sets of
verse which introduce or follow the different tales in this
book, and are, perhaps, its rarest ornament. One only I
should venture to criticize –The Children's Song; and that
because it is too difficult for children's lips. The rest are
very precious jewels sewn upon a rich brocade of antique fancy.
Some day, when it no longer pays to write books, we shall
all be adding insult to injury by discussing in the columns
of The Times the question of “What to do with our Authors.”
When that day comes Mr. STANLEY WEY MAN must certainly be
appointed Headmaster of Eton, or at least perpetual history-
lecturer in ordinary to the school, with the salary of a Cabinet
Minister. Imagine the joy of being “up" to Mr. WEY MAN
with his own works as text-books, to say nothing of the
novel experience of remembering what one was taught. I
have learnt far more about the Reform Bill and Lord BROUGHAM
and rotten boroughs 2nd the Bristol Riots from his last book,
Chippinge (SMITH, ELDER), than all the poor smattering of dry
facts which I had forgotten between youth and middle age.
Mr. WEY MAN's facts are so well-chosen and so thrilling and
served up with so piquante a sauce Cupidom that they are
not only easily digested but permanently assimilated into the
system of the reader. In fact, to use the language favoured
of those who will some day look up to Mr. WEY MAN as the
“Head,” Chippinge is a rippinge good book, one of STANLEY
WEY MAN's very best.
Among the first changes which the new Headmaster will
initiate will doubtless be a reform of that species of reſined
torture peculiar to Eton known as “Sunday Q's.” He will
find an excellent text-book ready to his hand in Sir John
Constantine, by “Q" (also published by SMITH, ELDER). A
few specimen “Sunday Q's,” with answers, based on the
contents of Sir John Constantine, will serve to show the lines
on which examination papers should be set. Q. Who and
what is “Q”? A. Mr. A. T. QUILLER-Couch, a well-known
author of the pre-Hooper period. (). The dwelling-place of
himself and his heroes? A. Cornwall. Q. Of what classic
do their adventures in Corsica remind you? A. Treasure
Island. Q. With how many men did Sir John set out to
invade the island where Who was born ? A. Seven ; NAPO-
LEON. Q. Do you like the book 2 A. I do.
Some of the ingrafted stories seem a trifle superfluous and
long-winded, but once “Q” gets into his stride his tale is
exciting, original, and remarkably well told.
Out of the clash of battle and fall of dynasties there is
left living no more pathetic figure than that of the venerable
lady who for seventeen years was Empress of the FRENch.
The narrative of a career whose transient brilliance was
suddenly overwhelmed under a shadow of increasing gloom
is told by Miss Stoppant in The Life of the Empress Eugénie
(HopDER AND STOUGHTON). The biographer does not profess
personal intimacy, nor claim to have had access to new records.
The task assigned to herself was to make close study of
the almost countless contemporary notes of the daily life, the
seasons of joyaunce, the times of trial, of the EMPREss. The
result is set forth in animated narrative compressed within
reasonable limits of space. It is the record of a life whose
varied course exceeds the wildest fancy of romance. Politics
apart, it makes the reader acquainted with a gracious person-
ality, who lived gaily in the sunlight, and when night fell
comported herself with a quiet dignity that won the respect
and esteem of the bitterest enemies of the Third Empire.
The author “IoTA”
Recently wrote a
Novel called Smoke in the Flame;
Pride lacking cash is
The theme that it lashes,
And HUTCHINSONs publish the same.
The characters patter
A wit-peppered chatter-
A most intellectual game;
And yet, though it's clever,
You seldom, if ever,
Can get at its object and aim.
In fact, this same tissue
Of talk clouds the issue,
Precisely as smoke does a flame;
And even “IOTA ’’
Could not, I think, quote a
More nicely appropriate name.
A “humorous novel” (advertised as such) may depend
upon a humour of action, or a humour of words, or upon both
together. If it depends chiefly on a humour of action, then the
author is lucky, for the story will write itself, and all he has
to do is to stand by and see that the humour comes out. If
it depends upon a humour of words, then the author has a
tough job before him, for he must take off his coat and see
that the humour goes in. The process is known as “being
funny.” Some years ago the recognized way of being funny
was JEROME's way; now it is JACOBs'. For the greater part of
Love among the Chickens (NEWNEs) Mr. P. G. Wodehouse lets
the humour bubble up, and the result is delightful. But
just oecasionally it runs dry; and then he takes off his coat to
it—the resulting brand, “Wop!:HOUSE and JAcobs,” being flat.
However, I would forgive Mr. Wodehouse anything in return
for S. F. Ukridge. He is glorious—god-like, as Mr.
CHESTERTON would say. On his great shoulders he carries all
the lesser characters triumphantly through the book.

Hushed is now the poet's lay;

Steadily since early May;
Now his only “winter view '

O'er my res angusta domi;

Even sweeter, and, of all hours,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S GREAT OFFERS.
4230,000 in Prize Money.
DELUGE of CoNGRATULATIONs.
DEEPLY impressed as always with the
conviction that the progress of invention
has been delayed by lack of encourage-
ment, Mr. Punch has decided to offer
$30,000 in three sums of £10,000
each, to
(1) The first aeronaut who succeeds in
flying to Mars and back within a week:
(2) The first person who succeeds in
penetrating to the centre of the Earth in
a fortnight:
(3) The first person who succeeds in
swimming from Fishguard to Sandy
Hook before the end of the year 1909.
With a view to enlarging the field of
competitors as widely as possible, the
contests will be thrown open to all
nations, the only conditions imposed
being such as are essential to prove to
demonstration that the prescribed task
has been actually achieved in each case.
Thus it will be obligatory upon the
winner of the first award to bring back
from Mars some tangible Martian trophy
—the tail feathers of a Martian, supposing
the inhabitants of the planet to have any;
the scalp of a Martian, supposing them
to have heads; or the prospectus of a
Martian book club, supposing them to
have enterprise. A live Martian would
of course be best, but in this case Mr.
Punch reserves the right to control all
interviews with him and to become part
owner of the copyright of any book that
he might write on our own planet.
The winner of the prize for reaching
the centre of the earth would have to
bring back specimens likely to satisfy
the best geologists and mineralogists;
and if he should tap any auriferous or
diamond-bearing strata on the way down
Mr. Punch reserves the right of working
them for his own purposes and profit.
Of the winner of the Atlantic swim
it would be required that he should com-
municate with our office by marconigraph
every half hour on the way across.
Needless to say, Mr. Punch's patriotic
and generous offer is exciting incredible
enthusiasm in every portion of the
civilised world. At the last meeting of
the Aero Club in Berlin the announce-
ment threw several hundreds of the
leading balloonists into convulsions of
ecstasy, Privy Councillor BUSLEY and
Professor Ass MANN in particular becom-
ing so excited that they were unable to
keep their feet and floated up to the
roof–an exploit all the more remarkable
when it is borne in mind that Professor
AssMANN weighs 16 and Privy Councillor
BUSLEY 17; stone. Professor HARNACK
has a long article in the current number
of Die Nation, on “Ballooning amongst
the ancient Babylonians,” in which he
describes the pleasures of aviation as a
foretaste of heaven, and RICHARD STRAUSS
is engaged on a new symphonic poem
entitled Icarus.
The enthusiasm in Italy is even
greater, and Signor SCHIAPARELLI, the
famous astronomer, who first discovered
the canals in Mars, is busily engaged
on the construction of a motor canal-
boat for Mr. WELLs. Signor FogAZZARO
has promised to dedicate his next novel
to the winner, and a-large proportion
of the children born since the announce-
ment have been named PULCINELLO in
honour of the donor of the prize.
On his sportsmanlike and generous
offers Mr. Punch has also received thou-
sands of enthusiastic letters, a selection
of which appears below:—
DEAR SIR,--It gives me the most
sincere pleasure to enter for the Mars
race, which has been rendered possible
by your splendid generosity. May I
be allowed, however, to suggest that you
should modify the conditions governing
the competition in one important parti-
cular, viz., that the aeronaut, or as I
prefer to call him, the aviator, should be
allowed to call en route at not more than
two planets to obtain fresh supplies of
petrol. Yours, &c., H. G. WELLs.
DEAR SIR,--I beg to inscribe my name
in the list of competitors in the great
boring prize which you have so gener-
ously offered. It is, perhaps, hardly
necessary for me to supply you with
evidence of the boma fides of my applica-
tion, but I may perhaps be allowed briefly
to refer to my profound and successful
excavations in search of prehistoric fauna
embodied in my little brochure on the
Mammoth, and to the letters—occupying
several thousand columns—which during

a cigarette with great care.

“Well, I was just wondering if we

“You see—”
ZAMBRA leant back and closed his eyes.
“The paper you will find in the

“All right, ZAMBRA,” said NEGRETTI
meekly. “I only meant Ah, here

“Say no more,” said ZAMBRA, and he

“Thank you, ZAMBRA.”

CHAPTER X.
The Tate and the Chantrey Pictures.
THE English people have of course
always been intelligently interested in
art. As is well known, large sums of
money are voted every year by the
Government for the purchase of Old
Masters, in search of which we have
highly-paid expert advisers in all the
capitals of Europe. None the less there
has always been a loophole for private
enterprise, and one of these was seized
by the late Sir HENRY TATE (who is no
relation of HARRY TATE of the Halls, in
spite of the statement to the contrary in
the Almanach de Gotha), who noticed that
rich as was the north bank of the
Thames, about Millbank, in
ship-yards, cab - ranks, and
these eminent artists as masterpiece after
masterpiece is selected by them for the
Tate Gallery. Shallow persons say that
artists are jealous of each other. A lie!
There is a genuineness of appreciation
among painters that cannot be described.
The murmur of their praises reaches
even to Piccadilly, mixing oddly with
the other sounds of the sweet May night
—for the selection of the Chantrey
pictures is always done after dark.
“That's a good picture!” you may
hear. “By Jove, but that's good ' "
“Where's your MICHAEL ANGELo now?”
“Talk about paint' " “Whew, he's a
master!” Such are the phrases which
come tumbling into the street, while

ABOUT GOVERNESSES.
By HELEN AND CECIL.
CECIL and me are always worried now,
and it's just because Miss THOMPson
(Miss ToMMY, we called her) got married
in summer. You see Miss ToMMY came
from a new kind of college, where she
had been properly trained never to tire
children, and always to be interesting.
As soon as ever she wasn't interesting
we told her, and she begged our pardons
and thought of something else quick.
CECIL is much patienter than me, so
I always had to start the languishing.
'ou lie back and blink your eyes, and
draw one hand over your fevered brow
– it's quite easy. We made Miss
ToMMy tell us all about her training,
and how she had to carry her pupils
“along the line of their natural ability."
That was how we came to miss the
multiplication table, and the
dates. They didn't lie along
any of our lines.
Miss ToMMy explained to
Mother before she left that she
thought Mother really ought
to know that there was some-
thing the matter with our
brains, and that the sum part
had got left out by mistake,
and Mother was quite worried,
and CECIL and me heard her
say something to Nurse about
a Specialist.
I thought it must be because
of poor Dad.
You see CECIL and me get
all the really intellectual part
of us from Mother. Of course
Dad is a J.P. and a Chairman,
but he can get all he wants
for its unique collection of
Chantrey treasures that one
Year after
year they come in, directly the
Royal Academy summer show closes its
doors, and with the new arrivals the
Channel service bringing the virtuosi
from Berlin and Munich, Paris and
Madrid, has to be augmented. “Week-
ends at the Tate" (Fin de semaine
au Tate) are among the great attrac-
tions of the Continen Cook, who
issues tickets by the thousand to art
lovers. Most of the Millbank hotels take
the coupons, and special arrangements
for sedatives at reduced prices have been
made with the local chemists.
It is doubtful if London has any more
interesting sight than a meeting of the
committee at work at Burlington House
choosing the Chantrey pictures soon after
the opening of the Academy. It has
been customary to consider a bump
supper as the acme of high-spirited
enthusiasm; but the excitement at one
of those functions is dulness itself com-
pared with the infectious delight of

upon. It is customary to give these
messengers a fee of five shillings if the

has been rejected.

at the County Club and fetches her away.
(CECIL says I ought to say that Dad uses
the Encyclopaedia for a racket press, and
that will show the kind Dad is.)
Then it is Mother who tells Dad what
he really ought to read, only he never
does. Dad says that he once read some-
where that you couldn't be a gentleman
unless you had forgotten your Latin; but
Mother says he has got the quotation all
wrong, and that in any case it was a most
unwise thing to say before us children.
But of course the real thing that's
the matter with poor Dad is that he has
the artistic temperament, and when once
you've got a temperament they say it

was saying to Dad just before she came.

“I am so dreadfully afraid that the
children have been fed on mince-meat,
and are never going to get their intel-
lectual teeth at all. With a conscientious
boy like CECIL the system might suc-
ceed, but not with an inveterate little
shirk like HELEN. HELEN must learn to
grip hard, and I am thankful that Miss
MooR is the real old-fashioned kind.”
Of course I told CECIL, and we were
frightfully anxious to know what the
real old-fashioned kind was like. Now
we do know.
We started with a dreadful disappoint-
ment about Miss MooR the first week.
We had found out that she was very
High Church, so on a Saint's Day we
º to Mother that Miss MooR
might wish to go to church. (We had
had a ripping invitation from the
Forester.)
But when Mother asked her she only
said, “Thank you—no, Mrs. LISTER. I
have never believed in a religion that
interfered with lessons !”
Then there was the Multiplication
Table! Why, the very first morning
Miss MooR said she had never heard of
children of our ages not knowing up to
twelve times.
We explained all about our heads,
and the line of natural ability, but she
just said, “Nonsense!”
Afterwards Dad offered us each half-
a-crown if we would say the thing to
him in a week. We learnt it in two
days, but that was because we wanted
to buy a pair of rabbits.
And even languishing is no good.
Miss MooR only says, “HELEN, as you
are neither the heroine of a magazine
story nor a worn-out seamstress, sit up,
please!”
There's only one gleam in the dul-
ness. You see she thinks CECIL has
what she calls the “faculty for dili-
gence,” and she lets him argue with her
when she won't listen to a single word
from me. So when I'm desperate I
kick CECIL, and then he starts—just to
give me a rest.
Only last Friday she was dreadfully
bothersome over some dates of Edwards
and HENRYs, so I kicked CECIL hard and
said, “Don’t you wish, CECIL, that poor
Dad had been more intellectual?”
“Explain yourself, HELEN ' " she said.
“If Dad had got all this stuff safely
into his head it might have helped me
a little, don't you think?”
“HELEN, I am simply appalled at
you!” she said. “Your father is an
altogether estimable gentleman Stop
idling and learn those dates!”
I kicked CECIL again, and then he
woke up.
“Could you tell me what is meant by
the artistic temperament?” he asked,
awfully politely.

special gift, CECIL, which enables those
who possess it to view things in the
light of what they seem, or else of what
they wish them to be, rather than as they
are.”
“Have you it, Miss MooR2"
“If you had it,” I broke in, “you
could say our sums were right when
they weren't, supposing you wanted to
go, couldn't you?”
“For your sake, HELEN, I am thankful
there is no such fatal flaw in my educa-
tional instinct. Go on with those dates.”
“Poor Dad has it!” persisted CECIL.
“He says the more short-sighted you
are the better you can paint; and the
less you know the smarter you can write.
He says that some of The Daily Mail
people have it.”
“Don’t get discursive, CECIL,” said
Miss MooR. “For a boy of your age, I
do not consider it suitable to discuss
either your own father or The Daily
Mail.”
“Then may we talk about dates?
Because --- —”
“Certainly. Dates are the foundations |

“But wouldn't it be safer to have the
man first, and then the date 2"
“Why safer ?”
“Only—if somebody had forgotten ||
my date, wouldn't I be here?” -
“That is why we keep your birthday,
CECIL, to be quite sure you are there !”
We looked round and there was Dad.
Miss MooR did jump.
But anyhow that's really the kind of
person Miss MooR is, and that's why we ||
know such lots of things now that we ||
never meant to know.
But there's one awfully decent thing
about her. She has an invalid mother,
and has to go home on Friday nights,
and that's how it was, one Saturday,
that we went hunting Socialists. I'll
tell you about that another time perhaps.

THE PUNCHPUDDLE HUNT.
I.
IN the Punchpuddle Hunt there are tinkers and tailors
And rich men and poor men of every degree; - \
There are beggarmen, thieves, there are soldiers and sailors–,
The only thing lacking's a Labour M.P.;
There are butchers and bakers (old men with new acres),
And of sportsmen—at times—a stray couple or three.
Oh, happier far with a duck-gun and punt -
Were the Nimrods that follow The Punchpuddle Hunt!
- II. - -
See The Punchpuddle Hunt on “The Walnuts” converging,
The seat of Sir Solomon Ikestein (we’ll say),
Through villages surging, from stations emerging,
The high-roads and by-roads with scarlet are gay.
On covert-hacks spurring, in motor-cars whirring,
In hundreds they flock to the breakfast to-day.
The steeds of the Ikestein are turned in the stalls;
The ancestor Ikesteins leer down from the walls;
On the chairs in the halls are the famous Three Balls,
Or, on a field sable; while yonder the table
Is groaning beneath a repast that appals. -
Oh, the food and the drink and the roads bear the brunt
Of the damage that's done by The Punchpuddle Hunt!
III.
See the Punchpuddle Hunt on the terrace assembling,
All swelling and pompous and ripe for the fray.
How the horses are jostling and wincing and trembling
As they push to the front of the motley mélée.
See the head carried high,
See the crop-hand on thigh,
For the local photographer's busy to-day.
It is done: they are off to the Ikestein plantations—
“There's a fox,” goes the song, “in the spinney, they say;”
“Eleu, in ” and the whips hurry down to their stations;
“Tally-ho!” from the laurels—the fox is away !
View-holloas are pealing; yes, there he goes stealing,
His pads full of sawdust, his brush full of hay.
O'er the tennis-lawn sailing, he slips through the paling,
And a strong scent of aniseed clings to the clay.
With the dog-pack behind and a bagman in front,
See the charge down the drive of The Punchpuddle Hunt!
IV.
See, The Punchpuddle Hunt on the gravel are striding
Away to the lodge-gate as straight as a die.
|The huntsman is riding: the field-master's chiding:
And behind them, amongst them, the hounds in full cry.
At the lodge one cries, “Whoa' "
And again, “Tally-ho * * *
There's the fox ringing back to his crate in the sty!”
Through a gate on the right throng the gallant first flight, ...
And the wily one crossing the orchard they spy.
On the musical grey > -
**
* *
And the collar-marked bay * * * * º -
And the job-master's hack that goes out every day, -
Feet home, shoulders up, through the meadows they fly,
Under branches low-hung and through gates widely swung
Till a ragged, black bullfinch looms hairy and high.
Right round to the left see the multitude swerving,
For yonder goes Reynard the bold and the sly-
Ah, right in the line is a vision unnerving, -
A grim, four-foot drain, terror-striking—though dry !
So they circle like birds, using horrible words,
As they search for the bridge which they hope to be nigi;
Save a youth on a roan with a will of its own;
See him rise to the sky; hear him yelling “Almigh—-1"
See him cling to the saddle and land with a grunt– -
'Tis the “Hard-riding Dick” of The Punchpuddle Hunt! .
W.
Oh, The Punchpuddle Hunt are unflinching, untiring !
Three times round the house at full gallop they sail,
Red, panting, perspiring-domestics admiring—
Already the leaders are catching the tail.
Three times has the fox
Had a try for his box,
And three times have they headed him off with a pail,
And now through the meadows once more he is slinking,
Since attempts at the pigsty in nowise avail;
He's right back for Leadenhall, beaten and sinking;
He'll run the embankment—he came down by rail.
“Tally-ho! ” in the lane; -
He'll be crossing that drain'
There's the governess waving with might and with main,
See her walking-stick thumping his back like a flail
The hounds in full cry close behind him are tearing;
His limbs seem to totter, his lungs seem to faiſ;
He leaps for the bank with an effort despairing,
And into a rabbit-hole creeps like a snail.
The spade and the pick get him out double-quick;
“Who-hoop !” and the bagman is dead as a nail.
“Forty-five of the best. Now for luncheon and rest;
And let Leicestershire envy and Lincolnshire quail!"

You may turn any brat into this, into that, Had I lived on, they would have killed me dead,
By what you may put in the tum of it. So I committed suicide instead.

THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR
Essence of PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday night,
November 20.-"Do you bite your thumb
at us, Sir?” “I do bite my thumb,
Sir.” “Do you bite your thumb at us,
Sir?” “No, Sir, I do not bite my thumb
at you, Sir; but I bite my thumb."
Thus the servants of Capulet and ||
Montague in a public place in fair
Verona.
- Scene re-enacted in House to-night.
According to arrangements made last
week the sitting was allotted for further
consideration of Plural Voting Bill,
interrupted by lamentable illness of
LULU. Next to Education Bill good
Conservatives most bitterly detest Lulu's
innocent-looking ewe lamb. They fought
it tooth and nail, whilst it was to
the fore. When temporarily shelved,
they, with a view of postponing evil
day when it must take its place in the
forefront of business, enlarged on any
other subject that chanced to come up.
As MATT Prior, not thinking of Parlia-
mentary tactics, sang 200 years ago:-
The merchant to secure his treasure
Conveys it in a borrow'd name:
Euphelia serves to grace my measure;
But Chloe is my real flame.
Hour had struck, and they must needs
buckle to with design to scotch, since
they could not kill, a piece of legislation
genially described by CARson as “the
work, not of a statesman, but of a sneak.”
Judge their surprise when, on open-
ing Orders of the Day this morning,
they found standing first, not the Plural
Voting Bill, but the Irish Town Tenants
Bill! Report current that when he
grasped situation CARson straightway,
from sheer joyousness of heart, proceeded
to perform certain ordered steps in the
cake-walk. Story lacks confirmation.
But, when one comes to think of it, what
a cake-walker CARson would be if he
only gave his mind to it, not to mention
his elbows and knees.
Occasion brings forth one of those
flashes of histrionic art that make us
marvel why PRINCE ARTHUR gave up to
Westminster what was meant, say, for
the Théâtre Français. As soon as Ques-
tions were over, he interposed, and fixing
C-B. with glowing eye asked, “What
about the Plural Voting Bill?”
For a moment C.-B. realised the
feelings of the Wicked Uncle, home
from his dire errand, confronted by
demand for information as to where he
had left the children. Endeavouring to
hide uneasy conscience behind a smiling
countenance, he explained that when he
said he would put down the Plural
Voting Bill for to night he did not think
he would live to find that the Town
Tenants Bill required, a second sitting
for its consideration.
POPULAR PORTRAITURE.
Realising that to the general public a title, an environment, and a little action would add to
the interest of the ordinary portrait, Mr. Punch begs to submit a few suggestions that may be
useful to intending exhibitors at the R.A. and other places of popular entertainment.
No. III.-‘‘SEVERED.” -
“If we do meet again, why we shall smile;
If not, why then this parting was well made.”
PortRAIt of A ProMINENT SportsMAN of UPPER. Tooting ENJoying A Day with the Houses.
This airy treatment would not do for
PRINCE ARTHUR, his heart bleeding for
the fate of the neglected Plural Voting
Bill. Having sternly cross-examined
PREMIER, he remarked, “The right hon.
gentleman is teaching us not to adhere
to anything he says.”
With angry roar Ministerial host
closed round their stricken Chief.
“Withdraw . Withdraw ' " they yelled
at PRINCE ARTHUR. Thus encouraged,
C-B, put himself into fencing attitude.
“Does the right hon. gentleman bite
his thumb at me?” he asked. “Does
he use words implying that I am in the
habit of deceiving the House?”
PRINCE ARTHUR rising to answer found
himself facing an infuriated throng who
shouted “Withdraw . Withdraw . "
with persistency that left no opening for
withdrawal. In comparative pauses he
found opportunity slowly to say: “The
right hon. gentleman is personally incap-
able of intentionally deceiving the House.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
What I mean is, that through careless-
ness of statement he has led us to
anticipate a course of business ultimately
not adopted. In short, Mr. SPEAKER,
I do not bite my thumb at the right hon.
gentleman; but I bite my thumb, Sir.”
“Nothing could be 'andsomer,” was
the comment of an hon. Member below
Gangway seated in neighbourhood of
Mr. WILL CRooks. The uproar ceased.
The Orders of the Day were called
on ; PRINCE ARTHUR, ever thoughtful for
others, hastily brushed away a tear that
coursed down his cheek, and attempted
to console Edward CARSON in his dis-
appointment at accident that had barred
progress of LULU's firstling.
Business done.—Report stage of Irish
Town Tenants Bill.
House of Lords, Thursday. - “At
Last !” as CHARLEs KINGSLEY remarked
when he voyaged forth to view with
unbeclouded eyes the actual West Indies.
Education Bill is through House of
Lords; more precise to say an Education
Bill is in such state. Compared with
the measure the Commons sent on last
August, the one returning to it is as
completely repaired as was the Irish-
man's gun. It's all there, save for new
lock, stock and barrel. -
| “And what do you think will come
of it all?” the PRIMATE, on his way to
unrobe, asked the MEMBER FOR SARK as
he passed him on the steps of the
Throne.
“Since your Grace asks me,” said
my right hon. friend, “I may—using
the words of course strictly in a Parlia-
mentary sense—venture to state my
private conviction that in due course it
will appear that the zeal of the Lords
hath eaten them up.”
Business dome.—The Lords complete
Committee on Education Bill.
CHARIVARIA.
MR. HALDANE has decided not to mount
sentries at the new War Office, White-
hall. He desires to avoid even the
appearance of militarism.
It has also been decided, in the
interests of economy, that barrack
buildings shall have one coat of paint in
future instead of two. The silence pre-
served by the Royal Academy on the
matter of this decision is adversely com-
mented on. --
Not being permitted to encourage
rifle shooting, the Burgess Hill group of
County Council school managers has
decided to ask permission of the East
Sussex education authority to acquire a
piece of land in order to teach school-
boys gardening. It is thought that the
request will be granted on the under-
standing that nothing be taught which
will enable the lads to throw up entrench-
ments.
£10,000 is offered by The Daily Mail
to the first person who flies from London
to Manchester. Personally, we have
often wanted to fly from London, but
Manchester has never struck us as a
more desirable haven. This, we sup-
pose, is the reason why such a substantial
prize is to be given.
An appeal is made for a more handy
word than “Aeroplane.” A barber
asks, What's wrong with “Air-cutter.””
It looks as if brighter times are in
store for authors. Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUX
has just booked another order — this
time from the King of SERVIA.
The rumour that the Crown Prince
of SERVIA was demented has been denied
by an official démenti. Confusion worse
confounded !
Meanwhile we hear that the CRowN
PRINCE is, anyhow, so eccentric that his
younger brother is already a kind of
Half-Crown Prince—in a Twopenny-
ha'penny kingdom.
It seems incredible, but we do not
believe that any one has yet referred to
Mr. MOBERLY BELL as the Bell of New
York. We do so now.
Mr. BEERBOhM TREE spoke encourag-
ingly of the state of the British Drama
at a dinner last week: he questioned
whether at any time since the days of
ElizaBETH there had been so much reason
for optimism. Miss DRAUGHN is now
appearing in The New Aladdin.
A tramp who was summoned at Fair-
ford Police Court for begging was found,
on examination, to be wearing a horse-
rug round his shoulders, two top coats,
a small coat, three waistcoats, three
shirts, three pairs of trousers, and six
pairs of stockings. It seems strange
that this man should not have realised
that he was in a position to earn a hand-
some salary as a Music Hall humorist.
to Animals is considering the question
whether live whelks, when used as bait,
do not come within the scope of the
Wild Animals in Captivity Protection
Act. It is further rumoured that a
sensational charge of ill-treating a Stilton
cheese by imprisoning it in an air-tight
receptacle will, at the instance of the
Society, shortly come before the Courts.
Sir LAUDER BRUNTON regards dust as
one of the greatest enemies of old age.
There can be little doubt that we should
all live longer if we did not become dust.
The publication of the fact that each
of the prisoners' cells at the new Old
Bailey contains a dainty wooden table of
the new art pattern has served to in-
crease the excitement among our criminal
classes, and loud complaints are made
as to the delay in opening the building.
OPTIMISM.
[A deputation from the House of Commons,
that interviewed the PRIME MINISTER with
regard to old-age pensions, was assured that
the matter would be dealt with as scon as time
and money will permit.]
WHEN you find it getting harder
To refill an empty larder
And you're failing in virility and wit;
Don't allow the fact to grieve you,
For Sir HENRY will relieve you—
Just as soon as time and money will
permit.
If you're getting old and needy,
If you're chronically seedy,
Or occasionally subject to a fit,
Yet the State exchequer offers
Compensation from its coffers—
Just as soon as time and money will
permit.
You have merely got to mention
That you'd rather like a pension
(Presupposing you're a law-abiding cit.);
You may not, at first, believe it,
But you're certain to receive it—
Just as soon as time and money will
permit.
When some persons in a hurry
Were unwise enough to worry,
Did Sir HENRY merely counsel them to
* { git * * 2
No! The joyful deputation
Heard him hint at legislation—
Just as soon as time and money will
permit.
Then all honour unto C.-B."
What a thoughtful man must he be!
Let us emulate his optimistic grit!
(Though we feel that we are fated
To be buried, or cremated,
Ere the day when “time and money
will permit !”)
Good News for Battersea.
“Radical repairs are being effected in the
Dogs Palace.”
So, at least, we learn from the Cork
Constitution; the information having
been communicated, no doubt, by a
Venetian colleague of Mr. MAX BEERBOHM.

master, for the Independent Methodist Mission

Mr. HoopFR has come to this decision

Henceforward he will be the brain be-

his services. That is his new métier.
Mr. HoopFR does not bind himself to
think only of the interests of one firm.
He is prepared to think for all who
employ him. He will just sit in a re-

JEU DE MORT.
If you like a good hearty death-bed
laugh, you must go and see The Doctor's
Dilemma; but if you are not yet per-
fect in the cult of Mr. SHAw, but still
feel a little sensitive about the more
elementary decencies, you had better
leave before the end of the Fourth
Act. And, in foregoing the conclu-
sion, you must not be troubled by the
thought that you will miss the full
meaning of Mr. SHAw's design.
will miss that anyhow, and r
You'
should be understood that his vices are
not of the forgivable kind that one
allows to erratic genius; they are ugly
and dirty and mean. And if any other
author had classed such a type among
the followers of Mr. SHAw's creed of
life, Mr. SHAw should have had my
indignant sympathy. Even as it is,
I am very sorry for him.
So the man dies on his wife's breast;
and she loosens her embrace and rises
and moves from the room. Instantly
the doctors burst out into ribald badi-
ribaldry, or else it is an incident without
importance and there is no sense in
trying to harrow us with the pathos of
it. Some such thought as this seems
to have penetrated even the author's
“nuciform" headpiece; for later on
he makes one of his characters say that
“life does not cease to be funny because
people die.” True enough, and merci-
fully so; but one may be permitted to
distinguish between the consolations of
philosophy and the licence of the buffoon.
And the choice of occasion has also some-
thing to do with it. And
in good company; for the
author himself would be hard
put to it to prove that he does
not share your uncertainty as
to his intentions. -
The doctor who suffers from
the titular “dilemma" is sup-
posed to have invented a new
method for inducing good
germs to devour bad ones.
He has ten consumptive
patients under treatment; and
there are two other urgent
One is that of a good fellow,
a poor over-worked member
of his own profession; the
other that of a brilliant young
artist, who is also an accom-
plished scamp. We are asked
to believe that it is impossible
for the doctor to undertake
more than one of these two
cases. Hence his dilemma.
But his reason for declining
to undertake both is never
made sufficiently convincing;
and that is unfortunate, as
upon this point the rest of
the play is made to turn.
His choice is finally made in
favour of the honest man,
whose death would be the
greater loss; and he hands
over the other to a fashionable
doctor, with the fatal results
which were anticipated. In
this course he is influenced
largely by admiration for the
victim's wife, and by a desire

again, it is possible to think
of funny things without neces-
sarily saying them aloud or
in print. As to this possibility,
I think perhaps it may never
have occurred to Mr. Shaw.:
Unless he consents to cut
ſout the chief cause of offence,
and drop his curtain in the
of rapid consumption. Yet I
should regret a fatality which
could be so easily avoided;
|for the play contains some
very excellent phagocytes,
which enjoy a strong; nu-
merical advantage over its
malevolent germs. The hu-
| mour of the first two Acts is
delightful, if not always very
fresh (the joke, for instance,
about being careless recalls
too closely a similar mot in
The Importance of being
Earnest). And there are some
scraps of proverbial philo-
sophy let fall by one of the
doctors—a man of the old
school, who recognises most
of the new inventions as
having been made, and con-
demned, in his father's day-
which have a serious value.
Unfortunately, by steady abuse
of it, Mr. SHAw has long ago
forfeited, his claim to be taken
seriously. -

(though I must doubt if you could get overwhelming tribute to the author's
half-a-dozen doctors to let off so many
familiar professional wheezes in one
another's company) we arrive at last at
the death-bed scene. -
Here, in the presence of his wife and
five lay-figures (four of them eminent
doctors, and one a studio property), with
many appeals to the most sacred asso-
|ciations, the dying man, declaring him-
self to be a disciple of Mr. SHAw, makes
profession of his faith as an artist, and
apologises for his life as a worm. For it
greatness, an eloquent acknowledgment
of his superiority to the laws of common
decency. If, in that chastening moment
of terror and pity, anybody in the
audience had dared, without Mr. SHAw's
invitation, to break the spell with even
a suppressed titter, he would have been
scowled upon for a wanton sacrilege
done to Nature and to Art.
After all, Death is either a very

BALLAD DIDACTICS.
["Incidentally a good round, such as the
17th Century ‘Great Tom is Cast,' or “Turn
again, Whittington,' or a ballad, such as ‘The
Bay of Biscay, or ‘Here's a Health unto His
Majesty, may be used to awaken an abiding
interest in history and geography.”—A. E.
Keeton on “National Art Songs” in the
“Monthly Review” for Norember.]
ACTING on this suggestion, the Board
of Education, abetted by Mr. BiRRELL,
is issuing an annotated edition of
English Folk-songs for use in the
favourably compared with that of cer- Churchman and outspoken believer in
tain Greek heroes, bearing the names
of ALEXANDER, HERCULES and LYSANDER.
In respect of tow-row-rowing the British
Grenadiers were admittedly supreme.
To be more explicit, the instant they
were commanded to storm the palisades,
their officers led with fusees and the
picked men followed with grenades and
threw the latter from the glacis about the
enemies' ears, the tow-row-rowing being
thereupon repeated. We are strongly
recommended in the song to drink to
the divine right of Kings; that he
strongly inclined to Roman tenets
under JAMES THE SECOND, and was on the
point of becoming a Jesuit, but for the
Revolution; and that he was the reverse
of a Passive Resister when Willi AM
claimed his allegiance. On the accession
of ANNE he reverted to Toryism, not
without some strong language addressed
to ecclesiastical trimmers, and finally
under GEORGE THE FIRST elected to
turn Whig, and support the Protes-
National Schools.
We subjoin ex-
tracts :
“The Bay of
Biscay.”—This dra-
matic and descrip-
tive piece of poetry
relates to the cele-
brated occasion
when an unequal
contest was waged
against the fury of
the elements by the
crew of a British
bark. It appears
that some dreadful
thunder roared
loudly, the rain
came down in a
deluge, and vivid
flashes of lightning
rent the clouds
asunder. The night
was dreary and
pitch dark, and
owing to the inces-
sant strain on the
unfortunate ship's
timbers a formid-
able leak was
sprung. The storm-
tossed seamen,
dreading an imme-
diate grave in the
deep, clung to the
tant succession.
His life-story is not
further continued,
but, judging from
the accepted dates,
the reverend gentle-
man must by then
have been a cen-
tenarian. Until his
dying day, however,
he expressed a firm
determination to re-
tain under every
régime the incum-
bency of his agree-

as historic, though the number of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 28, 1906.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is high time for some English publisher to produce
a translation of “PIERRE DE Coulevan's '' L'Ile Inconnue
(CALMANN-Lévy). The extraordinary popularity which this
book has won in France is sufficient proof of a sincere desire
on the part of our neighbours to become initiated into the
mystery of life and manners in this unexplored Isle of
Britain. And, since the charming authoress has here made
a comparative study of the characteristics of both nations,
it is well that a reciprocal interest should be stimulated among
those whose study of French ideals is hampered by their
ignorance of the French tongue. I should be sorry to seem
to underrate the value of those exchanges of civic or com-
mercial hospitality by which the Entente has been from time
to time encouraged ; but it is certain that far more has been
done to promote a cordial understanding by this work of
PiFRRE DE Coli.H.V.AIN than by many international feats of
gourmandise.
To loyal friends of the Sage of Bouverie Street this book
has a peculiar attraction on account of a visit paid to Mr.
Punch by the authoress; a visit to which she devotes many
flattering pages. Appreciation in foreign quarters is not so
habitual an experience with him that he can afford to repress
the blush of modest pride on reading such a passage as this:
“Il n'y a aucun mérite à lire Punch quand on sent l’humeur;
il est délicieux / " He is more and more convinced that a
perfect understanding between the two countries is only a
question of right education, but that it will never be accom-
plished until every inhabitant of both nations subscribes to
his paper, and all hearts on each side of the Channel are
hebdomadally united by the wireless current of his magnetism.
Meanwhile he begs leave to offer to his gracious and amiable
guest the assurance of his homage the most profound.
There ought to be on the front page of every book a list
of the people who appear in it; with a little note against
each name to say “You’ll like this man,” or “This chap's
a beast,” or “She’ll want some knowing, but she's rather
a dear, really ”—so that the reader might start fair, with his
mind prejudiced in the right direction. When I say this
ought to be so, I mean that it would be rather amusing in
the case of some books. It would be particularly amusing
with Mr. KEBLE HowARD's new book, The Whip Hand (CHAPMAN
AND HALL); because I feel certain that against Philip Lowe,
the hero, he would put “Darned good fellow,” or something
like that. Whereas, really, you know, he is the most selfish
prig one has met for a long time. On the other hand,
Oswald Lewis, the bounder, is merely a melodramatic bounder.
Mr. How ARD is taking no risks with him. He is not implicit in
his treatment of types. “I’m going to make this chap such
a bounder,” he says, “that even the ordinary bounder will
recognise him, and thank Heaven he is not as this man.”
Mr. How ARD's strong point, as is well known, is dialogue;
indeed he never seems quite comfortable away from it. The
dialogue here is as accurate as ever, though I am not sure
whether photographic accuracy is the one thing to go for
in dialogue. There ought to be a pleasant mean between
Mr. ANTHONY HoPE's Dolly and Henry his Reader, and Mr.
HowARD is the man to find it. On the whole a quiet, comfort-
able, readable book-qualities which Mr. HowARD seems content
to regard as the aim and end of his art.
Mr. MARION CRAwFoRD knows his Rome, an accomplishment
possible, it is true, to the ordinarily intelligent sojourner
therein. His latest novel, A Lady of Rome (MACMILLAN), is
page glows with pictures of its ancient palaces, is coloured
by glimpses of its bustling streets, the sound of whose names
makes music in the ear. But he is also master of a profounder
study, that of the heart of man and woman, especially woman.
A beautiful girl in love with a well-born but impecunious
soldier is forced into marriage with a wealthy noble. Their
relations are briefly but effectively set forth in a couple of
sentences. “Many persons really suffer if a cat is in the
room and almost faint if the creature accidentally brushes
against them. If any of them read these lines they will
understand, for that is what Maria felt for the man who was
her husband and who loved her almost to folly.” It will be
gathered from this way of putting it that the married life of
the Count and Countess Montalto was not altogether a happy
one. The situation was brought to a climax by discovery of
renewed relations between the Countess and her old lover.
Thereupon the outraged husband quitted Rome and spent
many years in Spain. It is in the story that follows, recording
the conflict between honour and passion fought by the
hopeless lovers, that Mr. CRAWFORD's dramatic skill and delicate
workmanship are seen at their best. Of several studies that
of the husband is, perhaps, the best. Mr. CRAwFORD has
reached a stage in his career in which he becomes his own
most dangerous enemy. Readers of his books are apt to recall
earlier triumphs, and shake solemn heads over imagined
* A Lady of Rome will safely stand this familiar
OrCleal. -
In spite of the fly-leaf list of sixteen books to his credit,
I am convinced that Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT has missed his
vocation; that he is wasted as a writer of “novels,” “fan-
tasias,” “short stories,” “belles lettres,” and “drama” (as
he classifies his works). What he ought to do is to take his
latest production, Whom God Hath Joined (NUTT), to the
editor of some newspaper which placards “shocking scandals”
and “horrible details,” and show it as a specimen of descrip-
tive reporting in the Divorce Court. He is sure of a job.
Only first he must work hard at his proof-correcting.
When I saw The Poacher's Wife (METHUEN), with Mr. EDEN
PHILLPOTTs' name on the cover, I opened the book hoping to
get a breath of that Dartmoor atmosphere which Mr. PHILL-
POTTs, better than any other writer living, knows how to
transfer to paper. What I did get was (as nearly as I can recall
it) the following, vaguely stimulated here and there with the
familiar fragrance very heavily diluted :--Daniel Sweetland,
the poacher, marries Minnie Marshall, and is arrested for
the murder of a keeper in a mysterious poaching affray, his
gun having been found on the spot by Titus Sim, his rejected
rival and ostensible friend, a footman in the service of Sir
Reginald Vician. Daniel escapes, leaving evidence of suicide;
meets sailorman looking for ship's hand; * sails to West
Indies, whither Henry Vivian has gone to inspect his father's
plantations; * writes tedious descriptive letters to his wife;
meets Henry, who denounces him as murderer; flies to
mountains. His ship sails without him, and is reported lost

Henry. Daniel reveals himself to Titus, who rides off to

the art of illusion. In the theatre we can live

“BE sure your sin will find you out !”
Encouraged by this cheerful maxim
Men watch the tough backslider flout
The sense of guilt that never racks him,
Knowing that Nemesis, alive to crime,
Will get him every time.
But there are moments when a course
Of crime, at present undetected,
Visits with pangs of sheer remorse
A conscience hitherto neglected,
Strictly compelling one to look aghast
Upon his lurid past.
Thus at the Play, when I have viewed
The brave but unsuspicious hero
Haled off to penal servitude,
My optimism sinks to zero;
A pungent sense of long triumphant vice

Revolts perhaps, but hardly saddens,
Nor calls to mind the painful fact
That, they like me are thorough bad

Their self-complacency requires a far
More penetrating jar.
With me 'tis otherwise. Though few
Are pledged so deep to callous knavery,
I still remain a victim to
A conscience's uneasy slavery.
The curtain lifts, and lo! my eyes are wet
With penitent regret.
I recollect, while still in socks,
How artfully I broke asunder
My little sister's money box,
And purchased sweetmeats with the
plunder,
And later, quailing 'neath a father's eye,
Threw off a whopping lie.

tied tin cans to poor dumb creatures,
And tripped up blind and aged men,
And fashioned booby-traps for teachers.

Those brains composed of agricultural stuff
Against the Proletariat's urban wit?

And Tenants' rights in jam-producing roots—

That each of these was made the single test ?

But rather ignorant Etonian boors—
And these your Bishops—such a worldly crew,
Doves with the serpent's cunning in their lures—
How dare you thus oppose
The pious savants whom the People chose?
My Lords, I note your independent air
Of men with none to say them Yea or Nay,
Since no elector's favour sent you there,
And no man's whim can pluck you thence away;
Nothing to gain or lose!
This makes you sadly prone to honest views!

THE SADNESS OF THE UNITED STATES.
(With grateful acknowledgments to P.T.O.)
ARE the Americans a sad people? That is a question to
which, strange and paradoxical as it may appear, I have
heard different people give different answers. Some of my
friends—and their name is legion—insist that I confound
sadness with strenuousness. But I can never get rid of the
impression of tristezza as the dominant mood with which I
was brought in contact among the Americans I met in the
streets, on the cars, in the elevators, or in roof-gardens.
Not that one does not meet an enormous amount of good
humour among Americans; indeed they are the second most
good-humoured people in the world. Hence to a Galway
man accustomed to the gay, insouciant, harum-scarum inter.
course of Irish people among themselves, it is like breathing
one's native air to hear and to see the way Americans treat
each other on the football field and elsewhere.
+ + + + +
Still I cling to the conviction that while travelling in
America you constantly get a sense of strange and brooding
sadness. America, in fact, is the land of the Almighty dolour.
And this is doubtless why, in virtue of the eternal law that
extremes meet, Americans are so passionately addicted to
confectionery. As the Roman poet Sophocles puts it, from
the mid fount of sweetness there rises perpetually an amari
aliquid. Personally I can deeply sympathise with their
dualism, because I am saddest when I sing; besides, as a
gay insouciant Hibernian I can recognise the truth of MooRE's
reference to “Erin, the tear and the smile in thine eye."
But I own that it surprised me to find in all classes, all social
strata, from log cabin to White House, this pervading and
terrific gloom. To descend from generalities to the concrete
fact, let me recall an illuminating experience of my recent
visit. As I was returning from a superb luncheon given by
the New York Times Booker Washington Club at Delmonico's,
I asked for an evening paper at one of the news-stands. I
still behold the young lad at his stand; his manner, his
expression haunt me still. I asked the price; he answered
me “one cent.” This was, I think, sufficiently curt. Even
in England, grimy, cruel, and oppressive, but to me inexpres-
sibly dear old England, a normal newsboy would have followed
up this answer with a suggestion to take another newspaper.
But really what struck my insouciant but sensitive soul
was not his laconic utterance so much as the expression of
his face and the intonation of the voice. The eyes looked out
at me from apparently unfathomable depths of self-abstrac.
tion and illimitable woe; and the voice was like the wail of
some abysmal despair. That boy-face, with its fine, dark
eyes, its olive complexion, its look of reverie, isolation, and
despair, seemed to me more like the face of some one of those
monks of the East who have so conquered the spirit and
become so detached from the realities of this transient world
as to suggest already that they have begun their reincarna:
tion into another and happier epoch, nearer to the blessed
Nirvana. -
+ + + + +
It is one of the extraordinary things in America that the
natives of other countries become so quickly Americanised.
Instances are, I believe, on record of European immigrants
who, within two hours of landing at New York for the first
time, have, on the sworn testimony of credible witnesses,
been admitted to the full privileges of American citizenship.
But I prefer to speak of what I have myself seen and felt
Everybody knows what a naturally gay, careless, quick-
spoken and amiable being the Irishman is, but the Irishman
who has been in America for only six weeks unconsciously
adopts that curious, self-absorbed, morne, not to say trisle,
manner of the native American. One's physique even
changes rapidly, under the tremendous and constant pressure

A TRAP FOR COUNTRY MIGE.
MR. PUNCH's UNTRUSTWORTHY GUIDE To
LONDON.
CHAPTER XI.
London Theatres.
ON this subject a word of warning is
needful. Do not be misled by the
phraseology of the theatrical advertise-
ments. The fact that “Mr. CHARLES
FROHMAN presents, &c.,” does not mean
that there is nothing to pay. Quite the
reWerse.
If, however, you are very impecunious
and still desirous of theatrical entertain-
ment, you have only to watch the police
making their arrests. Every woman
arrested in London is an actress. What-
ever she was before, she becomes an
actress by the mere process
of apprehension.
CHAPTER XII.
Politics.
No visit to London is com-
plete without an hour or two
at the Houses of Parliament;
but it is not too easy to
obtain the right of entry.
Members of Parliament
who show visitors over the
House are not allowed to
take tips, but may be re-
warded in kind. A gold-
mounted cigarette - holder;
a scarf-pin ; a match-box; a
cigar-case—these are permis-
sible gratuities. A Member
of Parliament detected in the
act of receiving money is
liable to instant dismissal.
Tea on the terrace is
sometimes included in the
entertainment. An intro-
duction to C.-B. as a pro-
minent provincial supporter can be
arranged for only on special terms.
The usual reward for this honour is an
invitation to a big shoot or private
theatrical week-end party.
Another special privilege, which how-
ever has to be arranged beforehand,
is the sight of a Conservative. These
once were common enough, but you
may now visit the House a dozen times
and get no glimpse of one.
The great thing at the House of Lords
is to be shown round by the Librarian.
Terms on application. Extras include
a handshake from Lord NorthCLIFFE.
CHAPTER XIII.
Greenwich.
A pleasant morning excursion from
London takes one to Greenwich (pro-
nounced Grinnidge). The best way in
summer is by water, but this necessitates
rising at daybreak in order to secure a
seat on the County Council steamers.

Greenwich (so called from its white-

which not only is guilty of the principal
astronomical discoveries, but also sets
the time for the United Kingdom; con-
tains the oldest men in the world (as all
travellers by the Tube lifts can testify);
and possesses the best known specimen
of the meridian that has ever been kept
in captivity. What the bear is to Berne
so to Greenwich is its meridian.

Sir Norm AN LOCKYER, the present chief
keeper (who, curiously enough, tells the
time by a pocket sundial and a box of
matches), is a genial and erudite man,
whose favourite reading is Nancy Noon,
He has a large circle of friends, a strong
antipathy to capital punishment for all
but those guilty of homicidal crimes, and

know him.

CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
(Showing how difficult it is, in some offices, to
write this sort of article properly.)
HEIGH-Ho, Christmas is nearly here
again, and once more the great question
of what to give to our friends confronts
us all, whether we dwell in the lordly
castle or in the simple cot. It seems
incredible that a whole year has flown
since last Christmas!

But there is no staying the inexorable
hand of Time; and so we cheerfully
reconcile ourselves once more to the old

selves anxiously as we make each pur-
chase, “Is this quite suited to HARRY } "
and, “Will JANE really like that?”
[EDITOR. Who is JANE 2 I must know.
AUTHOR. Ah!]
Now I have just made a little tour of
the West-End shops, and I can confi-

been such a goodly stock of novelties for
the connoisseur to choose from. I started
by walking down Regent Street, and my

A FASHION FORECAST.
[“Mark my words, crinolines will come in

Weakens the force of what he states;
Endowed with more than normal vision
He sees the future's fashion-plates:
The time is near (he thinks), to-morrow
May usher in the fateful morn
When ladies will awake to sorrow,
For crinolines will then be worn
Ah, what a time of tribulation
Will then come in to disconcert
That large proportion of the nation
Whose habit is to wear a skirt;
For, BETH, though in your Gibson rig
you're
Turning all hearts and heads to-day,
Soon you will find your splendid figure
Is, broadly speaking, thrown away.
Also, I think some small compassion
Should certainly be felt for us;
Think what the advent of this fashion
Will mean to all who use a bus !
What art will soothe the melancholy
Of men upon their homeward ride,
When lovely woman, “ hoop'd in folly,”
Insists on squatting eight a side?
The lovelorn swain, upon the Tube route,
Will soon perceive the “little rift.”
When she he worships murmurs “You

Because “she hates a clumsy man,”

True, Mr. LANG, your words sound solemn,
And yet I wish you would explain
Whether you penned that chatty column
In graver or in lighter vein;
For, though you always write sincerely,
This little doubt my mind assails,
Whether 'tis sober truth or merely
One of your charming fairy tales!

CLOSE TIME FOR OPERATIG HEROINES.
THE final stages of the Italian Opera
Season were illumined by the appari-
tion of a new Spanish star in the person
of Mlle. MARIA GAY, who was acclaimed
with an almost universal chorus of
praise. This had the desirable effect of
producing a record house at the only sub-
sequent evening performance of Carmen.
Perhaps the praise had been overdone;
certainly I was not alone in being a
little disappointed. One had hoped
for a i. and graceful figure—for
qualities which not only make for
obvious fascination but serve as a foil
to the occasional brutality of Carmen's
methods. To speak truth, I found the
lady too robust; with those stout arms
of hers she looked to have nothing to fear
from a regiment of soldiers. Her acting
in the lighter scenes was full of vital
force, of swift intelligence, of daring and
original diablerie; but when it came
to sterner business she made no great
advance upon tradition. In her dances
she showed vigour rather than grace.
Her singing, except for its dramatic
power, was not very remarkable; one
missed the fulness and ease of Madame
Kirkby LUNN's mellow voice. Still, when
all is said, she probably came nearer to
the real Carmen than any actress yet
seen upon the operatic stage. But I
should still doubt whether she would
reach the highest distinction with any
character less salient and seizable.
Apart from their failure with La
Gioconda, which had to be abandoned
through the breakdown of Madame
NordicA's health and nerves, the Manage-
ment is to be congratulated on a
brilliant autumn season, which should
be a good augury for the coming visit of
a German Opera Company who are to
hibernate in our midst for four weeks
from the middle of January.
There is clearly a growing taste for
Musical Tragedy. That its course has
been unrelieved during the season just
closed is shown in the following tabu-
lated scheme, which embraces the entire
autumn programme. It will seem that
every opera without exception has been
-
fatal to its heroine. Not one has survived.
On the other hand the heroes, although
always in the neighbourhood at the
time, have with two exceptions escaped.

before me.
“This,” he said, “is ours, I think.
It is a waltz.”
I murmured my thanks for the in-

“You Boston, of course?” said he.
I admitted that I Bostoned.
“Good l’” said my partner. “I think
it is a charming dance. I learned the
step from some very nice Americans
that I met this summer at Caux. Are
you ready?”. A look of tremendous de-
termination came into his face as he
sº me, and we moved off.
“I fancy,” said I, “that I am not
doing it very well.”
- “You only need a little practice,” he
observed, stopping and leaning me up
against the wall. “Take more of a long
sliding step, bringing up the second
foot behind the first, as in the two-step,

“I see,” said I. “Shall we go some-
where where it is cooler?”

My second partner wasted no words.
He assumed that I Bostoned as a matter
of course. I gathered this from the fact
that when, after an uneasy half-circuit
of the floor, I disengaged my hand from
his arm and stepped aside out of danger,
he remarked: “You Boston rather differ-
ently from some Americans who taught
me the step in Nova Zembla last August.”
I asked if they were aboriginals.
He looked doubtfully at me for a
second and then (after assuring me that
they were very nice) began to explain
how it should be done.
“You begin,” he said, “with the
right foot, as in the Military two-step,
but you bring your left foot a little in
advance at the second step, and then
start off with it for the next half-turn.
The time is a little difficult to keep, but
that is only a matter of practice. You
want to come in more on the second of
the bar, thus: one two three, four one
two, three four one, two three four.”
I said I would certainly do so, but
just now I must have a glass, a full
glass, of champagne.

My third partner took the opportunity
of giving me some instruction before
we began to dance.
“When you Boston,” he said, “you
count one two three four five six seven
eight nine, one two three four five six
seven eight nine, making one half-turn
at four and another at seven. The
step itself is a sort of half-sliding
polka, half-running sweet-step. It is
quite easy. Now—OFF we go. One

he counted loudly, his voice rising high
above the music.
At “nine” I made a second half-turn,
which brought me up sitting on a divan.
“Don’t you like the Boston 2" he
asked.
I said I loved it, but I was so tired
this evening.
“I am glad,” he said, “that it is to
be popular this winter, because some
very nice Americans, that were staying
in the same hotel with me at Batoum in
September, taught it to me, and I feel
rather ahead of the other Johnnies, you
know.”
*:: & *:: : :
“What I like about this Boston,”
said my fourth partner, “is that you
don't need to worry about the rotten
time or tune, but just go as you please."
With these words he placed me care-
fully in front of him and ran me
backwards violently into a man, whose
eye-glass shot out of his eye and crashed
to atoms against the unnatural teeth of
a lady in black some yards away, who
screamed loudly and dragged her partner
on to the floor, there to become the
nucleus of a pile of bodies which was
still increasing when I darted through
the door.
“You don't carc about it, evidently,"
said my partner, as be joined me on a sofa.
“You should learn it. It's lots of fun."
He explained its attractions to me for
the next five minutes, mentioning inci-
dentally that they had danced nothing
else all October up at Strathpeffer, where
some very nice Americans had introduced
it at a shooting lodge.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, November
26–Thanks to C.-B, the question hour
beginning to revive its old delights. It
provides an opening for Leader of House
to shine with peculiar, at other epochs
unattainable, lustre. What House de-
sires above all things is to be amused.
Question time is the PREMIER's prime
opportunity of serving in that direc-
tion.
Certainly the task not difficult. The
House almost abjectly grateful for any-
thing that even ſº like a joke. The
other night, when someone asked HALDANE
how many sofas had been supplied to the
new War Office and he made emphatic
answer, “One sofa has been supplied to
the War Office,” the roar of laughter
that followed was so hearty and pro-
longed it seemed as if we should never
reach the Orders of the Day. It hap-
pened that the boisterous appreciation
of native humour was a little hard on
HALDANE. He hadn't quite finished his
ioke; was adroitly leading up to climax.
The one sofa alluded to was for the use
of the Clerks. -
“There was,” he continued, “a second

sofa provided for the convenience of the
lady typists.”
Here was humour rich and rare. Un-
fortunately, the tornado of laughter that
greeted the introductory quip still
reverberating, the crowning jest was
heard by only a few Members. There
would certainly have been no business
done had it gone round.
C.-B. couldn't compete with this suc-
cess. There was concatenation of adven-
titious circumstances, that made the
opportunity unique. But he was very
good to-night, his points being made in
a sort of quiet aside that added to effect.
LONSDALE had spent the midnight oil
in preparing a poser. It alleged, on
authority of President of Royal Statis-
tical Society, that the minority in present
Parliament individually represents more
than twice as many electors as do
Ministerialists. This one of the oldest
chestnuts of political controversy. It
was made much of by the Liberals in
the last Parliament when, in somewhat
aggravated form, the same anomaly
presented itself. Nevertheless, looked
damaging on the face of it. Some men
would have made elaborate reply in
endeavour to discredit the President's
arithmetic.

The Doctor on his Rounds.
All C.-B. said was, “The figures
quoted by the hon. Member, which I
believe are of a kind not unusual to be
produced after a General Election, had
escaped my notice.”
Later, AshLEY asked if anything could
be done to obviate the scandal of block- ||
ing motions? “I am familiar with that
scandal,” said C.-B., and old Members
on both sides chuckled at recollection of
the daily practice of Ministerialists in |
the last Parliament fending off awkward
discussions on Tariff Reform and other
matters by putting down a blocking
motion to the pained indignation of the
Opposition.
Thus doth the short answer not only
turn away wrath but is more effective
than a long one.

only drawback to the serenity of life is
a certain monotony of satisfaction.
To-day, unexpectedly after the man-
ner of storms, the sky is overcast. Black
clouds roll up over the expanse but
yesterday of cerulean blue.
It's those pesky Committee Clerks.
Sir JAMES really doesn't know what the
Constitution is coming to if it is to be
thus assailed from outside. Last week
it was the Secretaries of the heads of
departments discovered seated within
the sanctuary of the House. Now it is
Committee Clerks wanting to take their
lunch or dinner in any one of the dinin
rooms whither their fancy may j
them, just as if they were Members for
the Isle of Thanet, or other influential
constituency.
The CHAIRMAN had arranged that if
they insisted upon having
meals at the House provision -
should be made. Only they
must sit apart at a special
table set in a particular room.
And here is the thing being
made subject of a question in
the House, along with others
relating to sandwich-men in
the West End, the governor-
ship of Natal, and revolu-
tionary refugees. Worse still,
the SPEAKER sides with the
querist, positively declaring
that in this matter the Kitchen
Committee have exceeded their
functions.
JAMES ALFRED doesn't want
to embarrass the Government,
who already have House of
Lords on their hands. Still a
man must consider his own
dignity, take thought of the
honour of a high office com-
mitted to his charge.
“And to think of all I
have done for them ' " he said,
mopping his heated brow. “I
feel that if it were only for
the shilling dinner I should not have
lived in vain. You know it, Toby, dear
boy; it's your favourite function; cut
off the joint; gravy lavishly poured out
from a ewer; two veg.; pat of butter;
a square inch of cheese; celery when
going out of season; bread ad libitum;
and all for a bob.
“Don't wish to strike a chord too
high, but in contemplating this boon I
remember Robert PEEL's aspiration when
the Protectionists turned him out just
sixty years ago. “It may be that I shall
leave a name sometimes remembered
with expressions of goodwill in those

MOWING WITH THE TIMES.
AFTER carefully reading through an
article on “Dress at the Motor Show”
MURIEL glanced at the latest news from
the front about The Times Book War.
“If women were publishers, the prices
of books would be changed at once,”
she remarked.
“They would be cheaper?” I hazarded.
ONE WHO KNOWS.
“They would be priced according to
quality, not quantity,” replied MURIEL.
“But no one would agree as to the
quality,” I said.
“All sensible people would,” said
MURIEL. “Just look at this,” and she
contemptuously indicated a volume
which was lying on the table. “They
don't marry, and the heroine is crippled
by a motor accident. And yet they ask
the same price for it as for this one
which is perfectly delightful, and where
there are three marriages in the last
chapter ' " And she smiled reminis-
cently. “If I were a publisher I would
only charge 2s. 6d. for books where they
don't marry, or where any of the nice
principal characters die. Then, you
see, the authors wouldn't let the people
die in their books, and everyone would
be much happier all round.”
Fly from London to Manchester?
Why, I flew from East Manchester to the
City of London myself in next door to no time. Rather think I'll claim
the money!”
“What would you charge for books
in which two men are in love with the
heroine, and only one gets her?” I
inquired.
MURIEL looked pleased.
“Of course they couldn't both get
her,” she said happily, “and I never
like the books where the other man goes
and marries someone else. Men shouldn't
be fickle.”
“But then there would be two mar-
igº in the last chapter,” I reminded
er.
MURIEL looked thoughtful.
“It would all depend,” she said.
should have to read the book to see.”
“What about the Garden of Allah 2"
I asked. “What would you charge for
that?” MURIEL hesitated.
“It was quite worth 4s. 6d.,” she con-
fessed. “But then it would
make a precedent for other
authors. I think it would
have to be issued with a pub-
lisher's note that it was quite
exceptional and mustn't be
imitated. Something like a
patent, you know.
“Then about the bindings,”
she went on, warming to her
subject. “I would have books
bound according to what was
in them.”
4. Yes 2 * >
“Yes,” repeated MURIEL,
with decision. “All the books
that end well should be bound
in bright red and gold.- Books
like The Angel of Pain or The
Image in the Sand should be
in black and silver—kind of
half-mourning—to show that
someone nice, but not the hero
or the heroine, dies in them;
but if either the hero or hero-
ine dies, the whole book would
have to be bound in plain
black. Just think how it would
simplify matters when one was
choosing a book at the library !”
“But you have only mentioned novels.”
“Oh, you can work it out for your-
self,” she said, as she pushed the latest
Times circular between the bars of the
cockatoo's cage, where it was received
with flattering eagerness.
“Then biographies would be-?”

DEAREst, to run some fad to death
Would seem to be your one ambition,
And I am somewhat out of breath
In keeping pace with each transition.
Your Bridge was but a passing craze;
It ceased to be your occupation
Ere I could find a fitting phrase
In which to make my declaration.
Nought but your motor now would serve,
And much I feared your end was
nearing,
Despite your most undoubted nerve
And more or less accomplished steer-

I hate mechanical affairs,
And loathed to see this fury seize you,
Yet learned to do my own repairs,
Hoping my skill perchance would
please you.
But no, I found you now intent
Upon some strange new-fangled
preaching,
Not very obviously meant
To be Platonic in its teaching.
I took the course, though sadly galled
(Since lectures are my pet aversion),
To find your latest fad had palled,
And you had made a fresh excursion.
I saw you driving off the tee,
But could I ask you then to love me?
Alas, 'twas all too plain to see
Your form was hopelessly above me.
Yet, though you left me in the lurch,
I found you, when your zeal abated,
A lovely penitent in church,
Where all your sins were flagellated.
At last, I thought, my way was clear;
Your love of change was surely
waning;
But now, oh bitter news, I hear
That you have started aeroplaning.

But here the last fond strand you

MERCHANTs and manufacturers all over
the country report a trade boom. This
bears out the prophecy made by so many
persons that things would improve after
the South African War.
We know no finer example of the
humility of true greatness than Mr.
GEORGE ALEXANDER's resolve to submit
himself to the suffrages of the populace
for election to the L.C.C.
Mrs. STETson, a prominent Christian
Scientist, declares that Mrs. EDDY will
probably never die. We hear that the
use of the half-sceptical word “probably”
has given offence in some quarters.
Dr. StüBEL, the German Minister at
Christiania, is in disgrace for having
omitted to hand 400 telegrams to his
Royal Master. The KAISER's fondness for
telegrams is so well known that the Minis-
ter's carelessness is almost incredible.
Mr. NEIL PRIMROSE, Lord RoseBERY's
second son, has been bequeathed a sum
of £150,000 with the idea that he should
devote himself to a political career.
Another eligible bachelor, Mr. ARTHUR
BALFour, has pronounced himself in
favour of votes for women, and is already
a little nervous as to the results which
may follow this declaration. We ven-
ture to warn Mr. PRIMROSE against this
dangerous course.
It is to be hoped that the angry feel-
ings engendered by the Soap strife will
now gradually subside, but it is rumoured
that a member of one of the firms of the
late “Trust,” on being asked, the other
day, why he did not advertise in The
Daily Mail, answered, “What's the
good of advertising in papers whose
readers don't use soap?” This, of
course, was mere petulance.
Yet another combine! It is rumoured
that the Shakspearians and the Baconians
are about to join forces in order to fight
the upstart RUTLAND.
We are authorised to deny the report
that Mr. HALL CAINE has been driven
almost mad by the discovery that Miss
MARIE CoRELLI bears an extraordinary
resemblance to Roger, Earl of RUTLAND.
For the rest, Mr. CAINE is of the opinion
that Dr. BLEIBTREU's assertion that SHAK-
SPEARE was nothing more than a drunken
and dissolute actor becomes palpably
absurd to anyone who is familiar with
the bard's lofty countenance.

What's in a name? A Wanguard

A new race who had never seen white
men before has been discovered on
Prince Albert Land. Advertisements of
The Times Book Club, The Times
Registry Office, and the Encyclopaedia
Britannica are about to be despatched.
Certain persons contend that modern
books cost too much. They are, any-
how, not so dear as ancient ones. Last
week the purchaser of a little Caxton
volume which contained only 214 leaves
had to pay £490 for it.
Prince JoACHIM ALBRECHT has started
on his journey to Africa, whither he has
been sent to fight the Herreros because
he wanted to marry the actress MARIE
SULZER. Special police precautions are
being taken to prevent the Prince meet-
ing this lady, and all vivandières are
being carefully scrutinised.
Two interesting Natural History items
are published this week. A new animal
has been discovered in Thibet; and an
inhabitant of Tunbridge Wells claims to
have the biggest beard in Europe—it is
15 feet long, and he winds it round his
body. -
A piece of old Dresden china only
eleven inches in height, representing a
lady and two pug dogs, has been sold
by auction for £1,050, and pug-dogs,
who have always been conceited, are
now becoming unbearable.

on literary topics, exceeding
in profundity of knowledge
and polish of style the average

of talking about himself, ex-
amining his motives, exposing
his sentiments, and narrating
the incidents of his daily life.
This habitude makes the book
almost an autobiography. It
dates back to his school days
at Harrow, finishing at the
Embassy in Paris, whither he
repaired at the close of his
momentous reign in India.
When he touches current
politics, as he most frequently
does during his prentice days
as he moves from Embassy
to Embassy through the
Courts of Europe, he displays
an insight which, in one so
young, was marvellous.
Incidentally he draws a
vivid portrait of his father.

passionate reader. His love
for his father was womanly

In Green Fields (CHAPMAN

of a series of letters written
by a London journalist who
buys an old house and estate
in the country, and runs it on
the principle that the land
affords ample means of live-
lihood for its inhabitants.
Having read it, I find myself
wondering (1) whether Mr.
Oswald CRAwFURD, the author,
is a Socialist with imperialistic
leanings, or is merely tryin
to preach a i.j
gºspel, a compromise be-
tween the systems of Tolstoy
and the week-end cottage;

happened ; and (3) whether
he will get the very large

serves.

noblest representatives of the
highest type of England's greatest men.” Three days after
the first Lord LyTTON's death he wrote to John FoRSTER, “Each
hour brings forth some overwhelming discovery of the noble-
ness, tenderness, generosity and exquisite beauty of my dear
father's peerless nature.” Yet the correspondence reveals the
novelist as a selfish man of hard, exacting nature, who went
near to crushing the fine flower of his son's acute sensibility.
As genius developed, and there was prospect of its bringing
credit on the family name, his manner mellowed. But by
that time Robert LYTION could do without help and encourage-
ment, which, as Dr. Johnson wrote to his tardy patron, “had
it been early had been kind.” Lady BETTY BALFOUR inherits
the literary talent of her father and grandfather. Her
delicate work is accomplished with perfect taste, unerring
judgment, and a skill that conceals its inherent difficulty.

and Mr. NEVILL MEAKIN, the author of that bloodthirsty
- BACON's Essays, which the
journalist reads aloud to him while he works.
As for (3), I have hopes, for the book contains much interest-
ing natural history, and the persons who flit about the slender
line of narrative are, despite the improbability of their co-
existence in one place, all very real and pleasant companions.
We have received the following note from a gentleman
who offers to review for us (if we will send it him) a book
just published by Mr. MURRAY, entitled “Pogroms: their
Origin and Management.” “The Pogrom,” he says, “is a
sort of cross between the Pug and the Pomeranian, and is one
of the most fashionable pets in Society at the present day.
In that part of the book devoted to its management, I expect
to find many useful hints as to its food, ailments, and so
forth. The Pogrom is devoted to children, and this book
should be a highly popular present with our young friends
at Christmas.” We have decided to decline our corre-
spondent's sporting offer.

A SECRET COMMISSION.
[As far as the author can make out the facts, AUGUSTUs, affianced to

mission is given to him by a representative of the vendors, but he at

Note.—On and after January 1, 1907, the acceptance of secret com-

ENCLOSED, AMELLA, you will find the gloves,
Three pairs, as ordered—suéde, and long and fine,
- And of a hue to match the turtle-dove's,
That bird that stands for fond affection's sign;
Also, my conscience being very nice,
I'd have my lady know exactly what
Secret commission on the market price
Her true AUGUSTUS got.
For she that o'er the counter served and sold
Had beauty—not of your heart-breaking kind,
But more anaemic, of a frailer mould,
And (need I say, AMELIA 2) less refined;
And as I sat a-sampling gloves, and deemed
That none was good enough to meet the case,
The shop-handmaiden looked at me and beamed,
Beamed all across her face' -
I gave no provocation, I will swear.
The initiative was hers and hers alone;
She must have noticed my connubial air
And claimed the sex's triumph as her own;
Anyhow, there before me smiled the girl,
And O AMELLA, count it not for sin
That blushfully I let my features curl
In a slow fatuous grin.
This trivial detail I should not narrate—
Plainly a reflex action, pure of guile—
Only that I discovered too, too late
Your aunt was there and watching all the while;
Therefore I think it best that you should glean
The truth from me, nor let your judgment err,
Tricked by a lurid version of the scene
As it appealed to her.
I trust my story (now you have it right)
May heal between our hearts the threatened breach;
Clean is the breast I make; O clasp it tight
When next I bring it round within your reach |
I took the veiled commission—that is true;
I had a moment's softening of the brain;
And then I thought of Honour and of You,
And gave it back again! O. S.

A TRAP FOR COUNTRY MIGE.
Mr. PUNCH's UNTRUSTwoRTHY GUIDE to
LONDON.
CHAPTER XIV.
St. Paul's.
No visitor to London, even an
American here only for a week end,
should fail to see St. Paul's Cathedral;
but anyone proposing to do so must
hurry, for the edifice is said to be in ||
danger of collapsing at any moment.
Several evening papers are subsisting at
the present time entirely on this rumour.
As to the truth or falsity of it, time alone
can testify; but a celebrated architect
has given it as his opinion that if it did
fall the crash would be terrific, while
Sir GilBERT PARKER, interviewed the
other day in Considerable Thoughts,
staked his reputation on the belief that
were a collapse to come the cause would
be a subsidence of one of the foundations.
“In the event of a disaster of this kind,”
the great publicist added, “nothing
could save the ball. It would inevitably
come to the ground.” No wonder that
with authorities such as this in so
pessimistic a mood a good deal of
anxiety is felt in newspaper-reading
circles.
For some reason that his biographers
have never fully explained, Sir CHRIs-
TOPHER WREN placed this masterpiece of
monumental masonry in the midst of
drapers' shops, and fairly near, not only
the General Post Office, but also the
statues of Sir Robert PEEL and Queen
ANNE. Londoners to-day, however, have
cause to be grateful to the famous
architect for also placing the building
on a bus route, for were no buses to
pass the doors, we should have to reach
it either (1) on foot, or (2) in a cab,
which would be respectively (1) weari-
some, and (2) expensive.

The peril of St. Paul's. Renewing the
foundation—for which a sinking fund is being
raised.
by Sir OLIVER LODGE ; but none the
less there are more things in heaven
and earth, as SHAKSPEARE (or was it the
Earl of RUTLAND 2) said–than are ac-
counted for by the plilosophy of Horatio,
and with the ZANCIGs puzzling the whole
Daily Mail staff, one hesitates to say that
anything is impossible or even unlikely.
Whatever the cause, the fact remains
that St. Paul's is threatened by The
Evening Standard, and therefore we
would say to all intending visitors : —
“Go as soon as you can, and don't stay
long.” Cast-iron umbrellas may be
obtained at the corner shop at the
Cheapside end; but of course no one
born to be hanged was ever killed by
a falling stone.
Speculation is always rife as to what
will happen to the site of St. Paul's
when the débris has been cleared away.
Dr. CLIFFORD, interviewed on the subject,
said he thought that there could not be
a better position than this for a Non-
conformist College. Mr. Oswald StoLL,
on the other hand, has already completed
the plans for a new Empire, while the
old cry that there is no good central
City garage has again sounded, with
some significance. It is also suggested
that the summit of Ludgate Hill is
obviously the best place on which to
erect the platform from which aeroplanes
leaving London for Manchester could
Start. º
All this is, of course, premature; but
if not premature what are we? Mean-
while, defiant alike of rumour or
history, Archdeacon SINCLAIR continues
to take his meals in the very shadow of
this imposing structure, between each
mouthful remarking with infinite sand-
froid, “Threatened buildings live long."
That he may be a true prophet in the
present case is the fervent wish of all
those not interested in the fall of the
celebrated fane.
Mr. HALL CAINE is also among the
optimists, but we should, he says, be
prepared for the worst, and he has there-
fore offered as a test case to stand, in
the event of demolition occurring, on
the top of Ludgate Hill among the ruins,
with his head bare, for a whole morning,
so that some idea of what the Dome was
like may be communicated to sight-seers.

A painful impression has been caused
in musical circles by the rumour that the
gifted critic of The Pall Mall Gazette has
resolved to modify his style and to
abandon henceforth the use of the words
“vital,” “accomplishment,” “sensitive,”
“delicate,” “exceedingly,” “superlative,”
“extreme,” and “supreme.” We under-
stand that a national memorial is being
promoted by Mr. HENNIKER HEATON to
impress upon the P. M. G. critic the desir-
ability of reconsidering this suicidally
self-denying ordinance.
We have been asked to correct the
erroneous statement that Boris Bogu's-
LAWSKI, the famous Wallachian violinist,
is the only prodigy in his family.
The painful fact now transpires that
his younger brothers, BoIESLAS, TAssiLo,
BRONISLAw, and PANJANDER, and his
sisters, WILLIBALDA, MAJUBA, and FRISK-
INA, are all similarly affected with
musical hypertrophy, and that, accord-
ing to present arrangements, their débuts
will occur at intervals of a year or so
between 1907 and 1914.
A conclusive explanation of the anar-
chical condition of the Muscovite Empire
has been furnished by The Musical

THE PROBLEM OF THE POLES.
My suffering Public, judge me not amiss
If, rising from the narrow bonds of Rhyme,
I seek the nobler Blankness of the bards,
Where one may stretch oneself, and go ahead,
Not pausing, save for breath, or fat, round words
To clothe his thought withal. I cannot help it.
I am constrained thereto by such a theme,
A mystery so complex, so obscure,
That I can tackle it no other way.
Permit me, then. And, with apologies,
I now pronounce the purpose of my song.
There are among us certain men who seem
(Mark the poetic glories of that line)
Possessed of an insane desire to scale
Our high terrestrial poles---or North or South—
Say North. And what I want to know is this:–
Suppose they get there, what will happen then 2
(There are two North Poles really—I know that ;
But for simplicity we'll call them one.)
Take first the compass. This, as you're aware,
Inevitably, with unerring nose,
Points to the North. I’m sure I don't know why;
Such is its mad, mad humour. Now, suppose
You stick it on the Pole; how does it act?
First you would say that, as it seeks the North,
And, as that lies directly underneath,
It points straight downwards. So it would appear.
But, mark you, what about the other end ?
This (which, with deference, we'll call the Tail)
Has an affinity towards the South,
Equal and opposite in all respects.
One end looks North, the other end looks South.
If, then, your nose points downward to the earth,
From the position of your unshamed Tail
The South Pole must be clean above your head.
But, as you're standing on the northern end
Of the terrestrial axis, for a fact,
The South Pole, being at the other end,
Must stick out right away beneath your feet.
So that your Tail, which points toward the skies,
Must at the same time look the other way.
Dash it, it can't do both. So that won't do.
Now for another. This is harder still.
Science, for travail of geographers,
Draws a straight line through Greenwich, pole to pole,
Which she calls nought or zero, which you will.
Now any place that isn't on that line,
Considered in connection with the poles,
Has bearings East or West. Contrariwise,
All of this world that isn't East or West
Must be in line with Greenwich. Mustn't it?
Now then, suppose a person climbs the Pole,
In what direction must that person gaze?
South. For up there there is no East or West;
And, though he screw his head off, he can still
Only look Southward. Thus his line of sight,
As it sees nothing lying East or West,
No matter where he looks, must pass through Greenwich.
And, as he slowly circles round his Pole,
And yet can never look away from Greenwich,
It fºllows that that quaint old-fashioned spot
Moves, with his eye, clean round the world and back.
13ut Greenwich doesn't—hang it, Greenwich can't
Where are we, leaders? Here we are again.
But wait a minute. No. I'll tell you what.
Man, in the limits of his finite mind,
Of finite things alone has cognisance.
All that is real, everything that is,
Must have three what's-his-names (Dimensions. Thanks),
Or else it's simply nowhere. Now a line,
Being, as EUCLID properly observed,
Length without breadth, which is ridiculous,
Has one di-what's-his-name, which doesn't count.
We see, then, that meridian through Greenwich,
Saving in Science's disordered brain,
Doesn't exist—and every spot where man
Can rest his foot is something East or West;
There is no atom on this mundane orb
But has its little bearings. Very well.
Now put that person up his Pole again.
Recalling what we said of him before,
It becomes clear to an unbiassed mind
That the position which he occupies
Has bearings neither East nor West.
If we apply the paragraph above,
Wherever else his doubtful post may be,
It forms no part of this terrestrial globe.
That is to say, there is no Pole at all.
Which being satisfactorily proved,
I fail to see why people want to go there.
And thus,
DUM-DUM.
THE CITIZEN'S MAGNA CHARTA.
THE “League of Universal Rights” has recently been
founded by Mr. PARFITT (who is, we believe, a descendant of
CHAUCER's “verray parfit gentil Knight”) in order to crusade
against the laxness shown by cabmen, railway guards, omni-
bus conductors, waiters, and others in the performance of
their respective duties.
According to The Daily Express, a start was made in the
streets of London on December 5 by a representative of that
paper and the founder of the League, and some disheartening
scenes were the result. The Members, however, are not going
to be deterred in the prosecution of their common-law rights,
and are prepared to undergo some inconvenience in carrying
out the following programme:–
Calls will be made at irregular intervals during the legal
hours at the Carlton, Cecil, Savoy and similar hotels, when
the several managers, being common innkeepers (as stated
on the licences posted up in their front halls) shall be re-
quired personally to furnish a Leaguer, or “M.L.U.R.,” with
a glass of four-ale to be drunk on the premises and as publicly
as possible.
The station-masters at the London termini, being employees
of Carrying Companies within the meaning of the Act, will
he requested to label the luggage of M.L.U.R.'s, and transfer
the same to the guard's van during the Christmas holiday
season, when the usual shortage of porters is to be expected.
The Postmaster-General, as a paid public official, will be
called upon to attend in person at any branch post-office
within the County of London and hand over the farthing
change on the price of a postcard to any Leaguer, if the
latter is dissatisfied with the demeanour or dilatoriness of
the young lady behind the counter.
Motto for the Congo Free State.
“RED rubber and the breaking up of laws.”
IN the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons
for December 6, there occurs this:
“Licensing Law: Petition from Eccles for alteration of law.”

[Motor-car marriages are the latest freak of American Society.]
From our Porkville (Pa.) Correspondent.
THE fashionable function of the week has been the marriage
between Lord ADALBERT FITz-EGMONT and Miss SADIE Z. |
SPLoSHER, which took place on the bride's paternal motor-cars
at eighty miles an hour."
The bride was attired in the cutest of 'possum-skin
wedding-dresses, with priceless antique motor-goggles said
to have belonged to one of her Mayflower ancestors, while
the bridegroom wore with aristocratic distinction an immacu-
late motoring-suit of rhinoceros-hide. The officiating clergy-
man read the marriage service through a megaphone, and
was skilfully tooted on the motor-horn. -
Owing to Lord ADALBERT's unfortunate mislaying of the
ring, a spare non-skid band had hastily to be substituted
for it at the last moment.
A novel touch was given to the wedding-breakfast by the
killing of most of the provender en route, but the feast came
to an unexpected termination through the front car colliding
with a policeman. At the magistrate's court the party was
sentenced to pay a fine of $10,000, and the marriage lines
were endorsed.
Next month Lord and Lady A. FITz-EGMONT hope to
entertain their friends with a motor-car divorce. -

House of Commons, Monday night,
Dec. 3.-Generally understood country
is seething with excitement. Constitu-
tional crisis at hand. The Lords, har-
messed to Education Bill, have taken the
bit between their teeth. Are rushing
at break-neck speed down a steep place.
Midway, slowly advancing to meet them,
is the 300 h.-p. motor-car of majority in
Commons. Someone surely will be hurt.
Expect to find excitement bubbling at
Westminster, where the storm is gener-
ated. Looking in at Commons, find the
Chamber almost empty. On his feet is
KIMBER, Bart., moving rejection of Plural
Voting Bill. Next to Education Bill
this the measure that most deeply excites
wrath of Opposition. If it stood by
itself, chief work of Session, it would
stir lowest depths of political con-
troversy, ending in deadlock between
the two Houses. As it is, KIMBER's
denunciation of its iniquity is as the
voice of one crying in the wilderness.
There are not thirty Members present to
have their blood chilled, their flesh
caused to creep.
SMITH of Liverpool, who followed in a
surprisingly prosy speech, complained
of the empty state of the Front Bench.
“Which Front Bench º' Members asked
themselves. That on which the esteemed
Leaders of KIMBER, Bart., should have
been seated was absolutely tenantless.
LULU had the Treasury Bench all to
himself.
Nothing daunted, KIMBER, Bart., manu-
script in hand, read his choice bits.
The Bill now before the House was not,
he insisted, a solitary example of deeply
iniquitous plotting. It completed a
triad of fell designs against all that was
good in an ancient Constitution. The
Education Bill was designed to despoil
the Church. The Land Tenure Bill was
meant to despoil the landlords. “And
this,” added KIMBER, Bart., fixing LULU
with flaming eye, “is a Bill to despoil
the electors.”
That's the sort of thing that rises to
the height, descends to the depth, of
actual political situation. The stranger
yawning in the Gallery naturally ex-
pected to find the declaration greeted
with that storm of cheers and counter-
cheers of which he sometimes reads in
the papers. If KIMBER, Bart., had been
remarking on the dampness of the day,
or the lengthening hours of mid-winter
nights, reception of his remarks could
not have been more chilling.
Yet it is true that crisis is at hand.
You can almost hear the rumble of the
gun-carriages dragged into position.
And the House of Commons is in a state
of torpidity out of which it is not

House of Lords. Tuesday, 1 A.M.–
Lord CREWE strolled homeward a stricken
man. Lords have completed Report of
Education Bill. This stage in respect
of any measure is a locus poenitentiae,
provided equally for Ministers and Oppo-
sition. If in Committee amendments
have been added to a Bill which upon
reflection it is found desirable to
abandon or modify, it can be, frequently
is, arranged on Report. There were
sanguine persons who convinced them-
selves that the action of the Lords in
Committee, transmogrifying the Bill on
vital points, was what in less august
assemblies is known as bluff. Having
asserted themselves in Committee, the
Opposition would, optimists insisted,
come to terms on the Report stage.
“Instead of which,” as the judge said,
they have used the Report stage not only
to confirm in the main their amendments
in Committee, but to add at least one
other more hostile to the spirit of the
measure fashioned in the Commons.
“My Lords,” gasped the Minister in
charge of the Bill when to-night LANs-
Downe sprang on House new series of
amendments to Clause 4, “some of us
thought the faculty of astonishment
had been exhausted by the amendments
placed on the paper. That this amend-
ment should, at this stage of the Bill,
be moved by the Leader of the Opposi-
tion, revives emotion in its most acute
form.”
Young SALISBURY chuckled. A great
day for him. LANSDOWNE might lead ;
he governed. DEVONSHIRE came forward
in favourite character of temporiser.
Couldn't the Government suggest some
compromise? No; RIPON threw up his
hands in gesture of despair in face of
an amendment which, he declared,
“struck at the very heart of the Bill.”
Curious to note here, as at earlier hour
of sitting in the Commons, total absence
of outward and visible sign of unrest.
Benches fuller than in the Commons;
but equal lack of movement. The die
is cast. There remains only the Third
Reading stage, which offers no oppor-
tunity of retreat from position taken
up on successive clauses. Within ten
days Lords and Commons will be at
grips, lion and unicorn fighting for
the crown of supremacy in legislative
action. Not a ripple of excitement
shows on the Benches. Heard in silence
is the announcement of the figures
showing that in a House of 176 Mem-
bers LANSDown E's fateful amendment
has been carried by a majority of 86.
Business done. — Report stage of
Education Bill completed.
Thursday.—Usual crop of fairy stories
on booksellers' counters marks approach
of Christmas. None equal in pictu-
resqueness, point and colour to that just
completed by Lords under title “The
Education Bill Changeling.” It is issued
at net price, though, contrary to custom,
the precise cost is not fixed. It may
prove incalculable.
Plot of the story simple, as are all
masterpieces of this class. In the glad
summer-time golden-mouthed St. AUGUS-
TINE BIRRELL conveyed from the Commons
and left on steps of the Lords a lusty
infant. It was his first-born ; naturally
had lavished upon it exceptional measure
of pride and affection. The good Lords,
he was certain, would cherish the little
one. They with their storied wisdom
would judiciously strengthen its frame,
add fresh grace and vigour to its dimpled
limbs.
Coming back at the appointed time to
claim the infant, lo! a changeling was
placed in anguished father's arms.
Regards it with aversion.
“It's no use to us,” he said, handing
back the hapless babe to LANSDowne. “A
poor thing. Certainly not mine own.”
LEADER OF Opposition declines the
charge. It is not his infant. It is PłRE
BiRRELL's, so much improved that he
scarcely wonders the paternal eye does
not recognize it. PERE BIRRELL obdurate.
So is LANSDOWNE. Meanwhile what is to
become of the Changeling?

machines and the huge prizes which are
being offered, there was a slight increase
in traffic receipts on the Bakerloo Rail-
way last week.
People in the suburbs of Manchester
are feverishly putting wired glass in
their skylights.
It is claimed for the aeroplane that it
is bound to be good for trade generally.
Very soon, if the prophets are to be
trusted, everybody's business will be
looking up, if only to see what to avoid.
It is very rarely that one sees a balloon
in our highways and skyways now. The
day of the gas balloon (how delightfully
mediaeval the words sound !) as an aero-
vehicle is past.
Sir Thom As LiptoN, speaking at the
dinner of the Royal Aeroyachtic Club
the other night, declined to say definitely
whether he intended to enter a challenger
for the Sky Blue Ribbon, but expressed
the hope (with the usual catch in his
voice) that the best . . . [Caetera desunt.

It is said that the Socialists, when
they come into power, will not only insist
on Old Age Pensions, but will make
them payable at the age of twenty-one.
With a practical unanimity which is
too rarely seen in the French Chamber,
the Deputies have adopted the proposal
to raise their own salaries from £300 to
£600 a year. -- .
It looks as if Prince voN Bülow's
recent appeal for better relations between
Germany and Great Britain is bearing
fruit after all. The German gipsies
whom we recently assisted back to their
country are so touched by our kindly
treatment that they hope to pay us
another visit next Spring.
The hero of Köpenick has been sent
to prison for four years. It seems a sad
fate for a man with an international
reputation.
King LEOPOLD, in an interview, has
stated that the English people forget the
class and character of the natives of the
Congo. They are, he declares, a barbarous
and uncivilised race. If this be so, it is
astonishing that there should not be
more sympathy between them and some
of the Belgian colonists.
The issue of the latest pattern of
peaked cap for all branches of the Army
has now begun. The shape is exactly
the same as that worn by officers. It
will be interesting to watch the effect of
this experiment on recruiting. We
understand that the Army Council is
prepared, if necessary, to go so far as to
issue Field Marshals' plumes to the
rank and file. “
The Army Council has decided that
we are to have fewer Colonels. Mr.
RooseVELT, who is not wanting in courage,
has never dared to propose such an idea
in America, where it would threaten the
position of the vast majority of his fellow-
citizens. -
The Government is about to abolish
Geography as a subject of examination
for candidates for the Diplomatic Service.
Arrangements, we understand, are to be
made for explaining to our diplomats,
when future appointments take place, the
whereabouts of the particular country to
which they are accredited.
Mr. HENNIKER HEATON, whose achieve-
ments in postal reform are so well known,
is, wenotice, continuing to take an interest
in men of letters. His energy seems to
be boundless; as a foreigner said to him
the other day, he is indeed a busy body.

MARGERY'S SOCK.
CHAPTER I.
WHEN MARGERY was three months old
I wrote a letter to her mother:
DEAR MADAM, If you have a copy in
Class D at 1s. 10d. net, I shall be glad
to hear from you. I am,
THE BABY's UNCLE.
On Tuesday I got an answer by the
morning post : -
DEAR SIR,-In reply to yours: How
dare you insult my cheild 2 She is in
Class A1, priceless, and bought in by the
owner. Four months old on Christmas
Day. Fancy! I am,
THE BABY's MoTHER.
MARGERY had been getting into an
expensive way of celebrating her birth-
day every month. Hitherto I had ignored
it. But now I wrote:
DEAR MADAM, Auto-
want, except to see her uncle (There'),
but it ought to be something that she'll
value when she grows up. And of
course we could keep it for her in the
meantime.
ARTHUR has smoked his last cigar
to-day. Isn't it awful ? I have for-
bidden him to waste his money on any
more, but he says he must give me 500
for a Christmas present. If he does, I
shall give him that sideboard that I
want so badly, and then we shall both
go to prison together. You will look
after Baby, won't you ?
I am, THE BABY's MoTHER.
P.S.—Which she isn't proud, but does
think it's a little bit classier than an
uncle. -
And so, finally, I:
DEAR Child,—I’ve thought of the very
thing. I am, THE BABY's UNCLE.
“I beg your pardon ?”
“A sideboard.”
“The Sideboard Department is up-
stairs. Was there anything else for the
little girl?”
“Well, a box of cigars. Rather full,
and if you have any—”
“The Cigar Department is on the
ground floor.”
“But your Lord Chamberlain told me
I was to come here if I wanted a present
for a child.”
“If you require anything in the toy
line—”
“Yes, but what good are toys to a
baby of four months? Do be reason-
able.”
“What was it you suggested ?

“That was my idea. It may not be
the best possible, but at least it is better

by now. I cannot un-
derstand why it is not
so. Perhaps I shall hear
from you later on with
regard to this. Mean-
while I think that the
extraordinary coinci-
dence of the baby's
birthday with Christmas
Day calls for some recog-
nition on my part. What
would MARGERY like?
You, who are in con-
stant communication
with her, should be able
to tell me. I hear coral
necklaces well spoken
of. What do you think?
I remember reading once
of a robber who “killed
a little baby for the
coral on its neck”—
which shows at any

than perfectly useless
toys. You can always
blow smoke in its face,
or bump its head against
the sideboard. Experto
crede, if you have the
Latin.”
Whereupon with
great dignity I made my
way to the lift.
In the Sideboard
Department I said: “I
want a sideboard for a
little girl of four months,
and please don't call her
‘It.' I nearly had a row
with one of your down-
stairs staff about that.”
“I will try to be
careful, Sir,” he replied.
“What sort of a one 2"
“Blue eyes, and not
much hair, and really
rather a sweet smile . . .
E'LL LEARN Was that what you
rate that they are worn. Do you know
how coral reefs are made? It is a most
fascinating business.
Then there is a silver mug to be
!considered. The only thing you can
drink out of a mug is beer; yet it is a
popular present. Perhaps you, with your
º. greater knowledge of babies,
will explain this.
Meanwhile, I am,
The BABY's UNCLE.
P.S.–Which is a much finer thing
than a mother.
To which her mother:
MY TEAR Boy, It is too sweet of you
to say you would like to get Baby some-
thing. No, I don't know how coral
reefs are made, and I don't want to. I
think it is wicked of you to talk like
that; I'm sure I shan’t dare to let her
wear anything valuable now. And I
don't think she really wants a mug.
I'm sure I don't know what she does
That ends Chapter I. Here we go
On to
CHAPTER II.
Chapter II. finds me in the Toy
Department of the Stores.
“I want,” I said, “a present for a
child.”
“Yes, sir. About how old 2"
“It must be quite new,” I said, sternly.
“Don’t be silly. The child is only a
baby.”
“Ah, yes. Now here—if it's at all
fond of animals——”
“I say, you mustn't call it it.' I get
in an awful row if I do. Of course, I
suppose it's all right for you, only—
well, be careful, won't you?”
The attendant promised, and asked
whether the child was a boy or girl.
“And had you thought of anything
for the little girl?”
“Well, yes. I had rather thought of
a sideboard.”
wanted to know 2 "
“Thank you, Sir. But I meant, what
sort of a sideboard 2 ”
I took him confidentially by the arm.
“Look here,” I said, “you know how,
when one is carrying a baby about, one
bumps its head at all the corners?
Well, not too much of that. The mothers
don't really like it, you know. They
smile at the time, but . . . Well, not
too many corners . . . Yes, I like that
very much. No, I won't take it with
me.”
The attendant wrote out the bill.
“Number, Sir?”
“She's the first. That's why I'm so
nervous. I've never bought a sideboard
for a child before.”
“Your Stores number, I mean, Sir.”
“I haven't got one. Is it necessary?"
“Must have a number, Sir.”
“Then I'll think of one for you . . . .
Let's see –12345, how does that strike
you?”

|
“And the name?”
“Oh, I can't tell you that. You must
look that up for yourself. Good-day.”
Downstairs I bought some cigars.
“For a little girl of four months,” I
said, “and she likes them rather full.
Please don't argue with me. All your
men chatter so.”
“I must,” said the attendant. “It’s
like this. If she is only four months,
she is obviously little. Your observation
is therefore tautological.”
“As a matter of fact,” I said hotly,
“she is rather big for four months.”
“Then it was a lie.”
“Look here, you give me those cigars,
and don't talk so much. I've already
had words with your Master of the Side-
boards and your Under-Secretary for the
Toy Department . . . Thank you. If you
would kindly send them.”
CHAPTER III.
So there it is. I have given the spirit,
rather than the actual letter, of what
happened at the Stores. But that the
things have been ordered there is no
doubt. And when MARGERY wakes up
on Christmas Day to find a sideboard
and a box of cigars in her sock I hope
she will remember that she has chiefly
her mother to thank for it.
THE BRITISH SOLDIER.
He was rather a favourite of my young
day,
I followed him noon and night,
At Talavera and Albuera,
And up on the Alma's height;
Plassey and Minden and Malplaquet,
I was with him in every fight.
I thrilled when he heard the bugle note,
And led the charge with a cheer,
Footman or yeoman, spearman or bow-
man,
Lancer or Fusilier;
I liked his mail or his scarlet coat,
Which was very bad taste, I fear.
And later it pains me to reflect,
When the news of Mafeking came,
I used for lingo the maddest jingo
Regarding him and his fame;
I called him ToMMY, I recollect,
A vulgar but friendly name.
I thought how often he fought for me,
What deserts and seas he crossed,
I thought of his daring and stedfast
bearing,
Whether he won or lost;
And, thinking of this, forgot, maybe,
Exactly how much he cost.
A peaceful subject, who pays his shot
n the way of taxes and rates,
I am told I am groaning and always
moaning

The accurate critic states.
Let me desert my youthful tracks
To take up a saner ground,
Let his fame as a hero sink to zero,
Let him be merely found
To mean in connection with income-tax
A penny or two in the pound.
He is too expensive: it may be so:
Wise words about him are mumbled ;
They talk of reduction and reconstruction,
And I feel properly humbled :
Yet for old sake's sake I want him to
know
That I, for one, never grumbled.
EveRYBody knows that ten days ago
the South Africans beat Wales. To
most people it seemed as though there
were only two ways of putting this.
You might say that “the South Africans
beat Wales’’; or that “Wales was
beaten by the South Africans.” Luckily
for those who love variety The Athletic
News discovered a third method. It
announced the matter thus:-
“A Nation or a Principality which chooses
the succulent and aromatic leek for its emblem,
may be excused if occasionally its enemies
refuse to eat the pungent vegetable. Not only
did the South Africans decline to make a
humble meal off the peculiar product of the
kitchen garden, but they forced Wales to
swallow it with as good grace as possible.”

OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Daniel O'Connell, His Early Life and Journal, 1795 to
1802 (ISAAC PITMAN) is a title at which the jaded reviewer
jumps. Here is promise of a peep behind the scenes in the
early life of one of the most interesting figures of the last
two centuries. Alack! alack! In point of interest, personal
or historical, the journal might easily be excelled by the diary
of a schoolboy of fourteen. It is not even new, passages
having been published in an Irish magazine twenty-four
years ago. “They did not,” the Editor (ARTHUR Houston)
sadly admits, “attract as much attention as they deserved.”
Well, let us see. Under date, Friday, December 11, 1795, it
is written: “I went to bed last night at a quarter after twelve,
and didn't get up this morning until five minutes after eleven.
I remain, in general, too long in bed. This I must endeavour
to correct. It is a custom equally detrimental to the consti-
tution and to the mind.” Other entries at later date, which
fairly represent the journal: “I yesterday received a letter
from my father. I must answer it by next post.” “I read a
sermon by Dr. BLAIR of twenty-four pages.” Here the Editor
hops in with a biographical note relative to our old friend
the Scottish divine. Having mentioned the hour of his down-
getting and up-rising, thrilling facts rarely omitted, O'CoNNELL
chiefly filled his journal with a catalogue of books read during
the day. This gives the learned Editor opportunity, lavishly
used, of inserting biographical notes about, amongst others,
GiBBON, Godwin and ToM PAINE, with a compendious summary
of The Age of Reason. These things are informing. But the
information is not exactly new, nor is it hopelessly inaccessible.
The Crackling of Thorns (CONSTABLE), by Captain KENDALL–
“DUM-DUM" of Punch—is a really remarkable collection of
light verse. No writer of to-day can get more fun out of an
elaborate form of humour. His technique shews an advance
on what before had come very near perfection. He has a
preference for long stanzas, which seem, in his hands, to
lend themselves to a highly-wrought style. If he had not
achieved so marked a success in these forms, avoiding at once
the otiose and the obscure, one would have supposed that
they were more adapted to the garrulous prolixity of BYRON
than to the terseness which is an essential of the modern art
of light verse.
His faculty of invention is shown rather in the treatment
than in the choice of his themes. These, as far as the present
volume ranges, are largely confined to studies of himself (his
person, his clothes, his affairs of the heart, considered lyrically)
and of other and inferior animals. Thus he has odes to the back
of his head, to his tall hat, to his fur-lined coat (a most delectable
poem); he treats of his tailor's bill, his last illusion, his in-
somnia, his leap-year prospects, his tendency to reform; he
addresses a fat pig, a caged lion, a sea-serpent, a hippopotamus;
and makes a very touching threnody on a polar bear. His fancy
has, of course, embraced a far wider field of subjects, political or
otherwise transient, but with great courage and self-effacement
he has refused to present in book form any matter that does
not promise to “appeal at any ordinary time to any ordinary
person.” And this, as he justly hopes, should be “accounted
to him for righteousness.”
I heartily commend “DUM-DUM's " volume as the best kind
of Christmas gift to all who have a palate for the rarer
vintages of English humour.
Paper Pellels (ELKIN MATHEWs) by JESSIE POPE, is another
collection of poems drawn largely from the pages of Punch.
A first adventure in book-making, it is less ambitious than
Captain KENDALL's work, but it deserves to win a very wide
circle of readers, if only as an almost unique example of an
ºnglishwoman's gift for light verse. Yet Miss Pope needs to
make no apology either for her sex or for the brevity of her
experience. She has a true sense of humour, a dainty touch,
and a nice feeling for rhythmic movement. The critics, not
always very expert judges of technique in this school, have
employed their usual formulas about the obvious influence of
CALVERLEY. It may interest them to know that Miss Pope
makes no secret of the fact that she has never had the curiosity
to read a line from the work of that admirable exemplar.
She will, of course, waste no time in making good this defect
in order to find out where she got her originality from. Mr.
Punch, who has enjoyed an intimate observation of her grow-
ing talent, ventures to give a guardian's blessing to what he
knows to be an earnest of even better things to come.
When good Sir Nigel trod our soil
He dealt in deeds of knightly glory,
So says Sir ARTHUR CoNAN Doyle
Who (per SMITH, ELDER) tells his story;
In every chapter he is near
To death, yet always fails to strike it—
I fancy from a courteous fear
That gentle readers wouldn't like it.
He battles nobly in the thick
Of odds indubitably trying,
Of which not least I count the trick
Sir ARTHUR has of speechifying.
Whenever someone's going strong,
Sir A. dispatches several pages
To tell how codes of right and wrong
Have altered since the Middle Ages.
Now, booklore-laden atmosphere's -
- A thing that knights don't really care for ;
They like to pull each other's ears
Without a thought of why or wherefore ;
And so it rather spoils the fun
To find Sir ARTHUR's warriors waiting
While he postpones their turn for one
Less thrilling but more elevating.
In an Apologia prefixed to The Little Squire (CASSELL),
Mrs. HENRY DE LA PASTURE tells us that the story was written
in her early youth, and received with unexpected favour.
She would “fain have reconstructed it in the light of her
present experience, if the process had not involved entire
reconstruction.” Such rare candour (successful authors,
tempted to exhume your youthful indiscretions, please copy)
almost disarms criticism, because it forestalls it. The story,
to be worthy of a place on the same bookshelf as Deborah of
Tod's and Peter's Mother, should have been entirely recon-
structed. The boy squire and his two little friends are
amiable, if a trifle elderly for their age; the sham tutor who
seeks to disinherit him and marry his widowed mother is a
fair sample of the fashion-plate villain, and all of them have
too much vitality to fade at once from the memory. But
for all that their sayings and doings are hackneyed and
amateurishly conceived, and the verdict is that the defendant
is not very guilty, but must not do it again, if she values
her reputation.
OLGA MoRGAN, with her writing-pen and her drawing-pen,
and a little paint (mostly red), and HARRY RouxTREE, with his
drawing-pen and a lot of colour (mostly blue), have gone into
partnership; and here is Mr. Punch's Book of Birthdays,
which they have easily induced the Sage to publish at his
own office in Bouverie Street. I would like to enlarge upon
the pretty child-fancies of its tales, and the whimsical charm
of its designs; but Mr. Punch cuts me short with these words,
marked by a modest dignity all his own: “It is my book of
birthdays,” says he, “and it bears my imprimatur. What
need of further commendation ?”

PUNCH, OR THE
AFTERNOON TEA SLEIGHTS.
WHILE, in regard to small feats of
magic, the dinner and supper table are
excellently well catered for, the modest
claims of the smaller afternoon tea-table
seem generally to have been overlooked.
Also many of the illusions described in
conjurors' handbooks require extensive
paraphernalia, and your smartly-attired
young man resents having the set of
his coat impaired with partially con-
cealed dishes of goldfish, barbers' poles,
and collapsible bird-cages. Now the
following sleights are performed entirely
with the natural appurtenances of after-
noon tea, and they demand little in the
way of practice or natural skill; in fact
any fool can do them.
We call them “sleights,” but sleights
in the strict sense of the term they are
not. Etymological friends, however,
have been as puzzled as ourselves to
supply the exact word, and one—a man
who is something of a purist, too, as
regards momenclature—said, why not
call them pranks?
As we have said, anyone can perform
these tricks, but we specially commend
them to the young man who is lacking
in the polite art of conversation, yet
desires a share of the attention and
interest of the company. This he can
easily secure by following the directions
below.
THE MAGIC, SPOON.—This is a simple,
but invariably effective trick, and re-
quires no confederate. Having got your
cup of tea you seat yourself by, if
possible, a highly-strung person who is
balancing his piece of Sèvres lightly on
his crossed knee, and is deep in con-
versation. Stir your tea slowly and
abstractedly until the spoon has reached
a temperature of about 180 degrees
Fahrenheit; then quietly withdraw it,
and lay its hot bowl gently on the back
of the nervous person's hand. The
result is electrifying, and should do
much to remove the idea that English
people are not emotional.
TAKING THE CARE.-This is a use-
ful as well as a highly diverting sleight,
but if it is to be accomplished with
absolute success the performer must
keep a cool head. It may be laid down
as a general rule, in fact, that for tricks
of this kind coolness is required above
all other qualities. The illusion is this:
The cakes having been handed round
or selected from a centre stand, you
find perhaps that you have fared in-
differently—some alert old lady having
beaten you in open competition for
the choicest or largest section. Be
quick before she commences operations,
and, directing her attention to some
imaginary phenomenon on the ceiling at
a point directly over her head, substi-
tute your own confection for hers.
No. V.-“DIANA OF
POPULAR PORTRAITURE.
Realising that to the general public a title, an environment, and a little action would add to
the interest of the ordinary portrait, Mr. Punch begs to submit a few suggestions that may be
useful to intending exhibitors at the R.A. and other places of popular entertainment.
THE CROSSWAYS.”
After a sufficiently long gaze at this
angle, the old lady will grow slightly
dazed, and her eyes, even on their
return to her plate, will not immediately
notice the deception that has been
practised upon her. By the time they
do, you must be calmly munching the
spoils with a face that gives nothing
away, and hands of the same description.
The INTANGIBLE CHAIR.—This is a
capital trick and, though quite an old
one, has lost nothing of its power to
surprise. An informal circle having
been formed about the hostess, you
take your position just outside it, and
next to, but a little behind, a stout,
choleric middle-aged gentleman–army
man preferred. Watch your oppor-
tunity, and when he rises to have his
cup refilled place your hand casually
on the back of his chair. Don't show
the slightest trace of excitement—there
will be plenty of that in the room when
you have accomplished the trick. Wait
now for the psychological moment, which
is when the Major backs carefully to his
seat with his full cup, and as he lowers
himself into it (the chair, not the full
cup) pull it deftly away. Do not be
envious if, for a few moments, the Major
has the centre of the stage; your share
in the performance will not be per-
manently overlooked.
“THERE is no more dangerous foot-
baller in the county than Birmingham's
little pivot. Perhaps the most effective
factor in his display was the cleverness
with which he used his wings.”

If he goes on like this the little pivot
will be able to retire on The Daily Mail
£10,000 prize, and play as an amateur.

ONE GOVERNMENT, ONE VOTE.
[At the recent Conference on Wireless Telegraphy held at Berlin—a
conference promoted by Germany with the idea (according to the frank
admission of the Vossische Zeitung) of robbing the British Marconi
System of the world-wide supremacy, which it derives from having been
first in the field—it was resolved that in future Conferences on this
subject all nations should have a vote of equal value. Thus Great
Britain, sessing the greatest navy in the world, and depending
largely, 1. national defence, upon the present system of sea-com-
munications, is to enjoy precisely the same voting power as Monaco.
Among Colonies, again, it was arranged that Canada should have the
same voting power as that patch of S.W. Africa which Germany is just
now trying to hold against the Hottentots. . These proposals were
signed by the British Delegates. His Majesty's Government, induced
at the last moment to intervene, retains the option of confirming or can-
celling this signature. The question is about to come up before
Parliament, and strong opposition to the confirmation of the Berlin
agreement is anticipated from both sides of the House on the part of
i. who have at heart the interests of national defence.]
PRINCE of that enchanted rock,
Mecca-goal of all religions,
Where you fleece them, flock by flock—
Trapped and plucked and peppered pigeons;
And the feathers which they shed -
Make a rather downy bed
Where to lay your princely head:—
If at times you wonder well
By what oversight of Heaven you
Still conduct your model hell,
Growing fat upon its revenue,
It should move your heart to mirth,
Just to know what you are worth
In the Councils of the Earth.
Touching matters which affect
Men-of-war's communications,
You enjoy a like respect
With the first of fighting nations;
You, with your one pleasure-boat,
Have, it seems, as large a vote
As the biggest fleet afloat!

Lord of pestilential swamps,
Where the click of German triggers,
Bands and high Imperial pomps
Fail to awe the local niggers;
Do not rage for honour lost,
Though your Reichstag cuts the cost
. Of a most amazing frost.
For the chunk of Hinterland
Covered by your eagle's pinions
Holds within its barren sand
Power to match our great Dominion's;
Canada, I’m told, is not
Better off, one little jot,
Than your dismal jungle-plot.

Happily was he inspired
(And his name is well worth noting)
Who with passion first was fired
To abolish Plural Voting;
Yet I question if he knew,
Modest fellow, how his view
Might be sprung on nations too.
Little could his brain divine
How, on polished Teuton vellum,
British delegates will sign
Just whatever Teutons tell 'em;
. regardless of their connection with sport of any description,
Yet, as I have lately heard
From a small MARCON1-bird
That's precisely what occurred.
If it's true; if they, in fact,
Gave away the whole position,
Then I think such nerve and tact
Ought to have some recognition;
In their honour I would see

ENGLAND v. SOUTH AFRICA.
SHOULD THERE BE A SECOND MATCH2
(With acknowledgments to “The Daily Chronicle.”)
PUBLIC interest has been excited almost to the point of
frenzy by the indecisive result of the great mudlark under
whistling rules at the Crystal Palace. For ourselves we
may say at once that we are strongly of opinion either
that the match should be re-played or that the result should
be allowed to stand as it now does. It may be contended
that the superiority of the Colonists has been subsequently
proved by the fact that the victorious Oxford fifteen con-
tained six times as many South Africans as the Cambridge
team. But this will not do. Oxford is not (as yet) entirely
South African, and Cambridge, although its team embrace
two Scottish Internationals, is not strictly representative of
England. It may be urged again that all the best precedents
are against our proposal. But what does the Liberal Press
exist for, if it cannot sweep away Precedent, and all other
hide-bound and antediluvian institutions? We would dire:
the attention of the House of Lords to this courteous and
even kindly warning. Reverting to the scheme of a re-play.
we have invited, on this knotty point, the personal opinion
of all the well-known men that we could think of, quite
and we append a selection of their views.
When a great national question of this sort arises, one
instinctively thinks first of All of the leading English author.
and it may be said at once that he has responded nobly to
our appeal in a letter breathing English manliness, and
singularly free from any taint of petty prejudice. We only
regret that, as it would have filled two of our columns, we
are precluded from quoting it in full. -

gallant struggle until their clubs are shivered in their hands
like the lances of old-world knights. Turning for the
moment to this unhappy Book War, I may say that I am
fully prepared to make another experiment to which I would ||
draw your attention—”
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, M.P., writes:—
“I wish to point out that the visit of the South African
team has increased that good-will which happily has existed
for the last twelve months between all our Colonies and
the Mother Country. I have no desire to labour the point.
I should like to see the match re-played. If either of the
teams should want another leader either on or off the field, I
may say that I know the ideal man.”
Dr. MACNAMARA, M.P., writes:–
“Certainly . If the general feeling is in favour of a re-play.
why, I shall not stand in the way. I would even be present
at the match myself, in response to anything approaching a
national wish for my attendance.”

Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE writes:–

telepathic talent is possessed by these two simple people !
I could write at length upon this fascinating topic, but I

Answers have not yet come to hand, but are anxiously
awaited, from the KAISER, King LEOPold and the President of
the UNITED STATEs.
The Daily Mail, in its account of the dissolution of the
Reichstag, says: “The entire House, with the erception of
the refractory majority . . . . cheered itself hoarse.” We
recommend these felicitous phrases to our Tory contemporaries
for any occasion when a speech by Mr. ARTHUR BALFour has
been received with enthusiasm by the Opposition.

Mr. Punch once made a picture for the Duchess of SUTHER-

ful handiwork (in metal, &c.) of this same Guild.

To the Members who voted for breakfast or lunch
For the poor little children, this greeting from Punch.
In the turmoil of parties you've done what you could,
And Punch from his office pronounces it good.
He has seen how the children, obeying your rule,
Go hungry and wretched and feeble to school.
He has seen how their efforts at learning are vain,
How they strive and are beaten by hunger and pain;
How, their brains in confusion, their stomachs unfed,
They drag on through the day and go hungry to bed;
And he saw how your children are fed and have fun,
And he thought it was time to let something be done.
So he welcomed your plan, for his heart was on fire,
For giving poor children the food they require.
Now your task is completed; the Bill has gone through,
Though the pedants with bees in their bonnets looked blue.
They were few, and you laughed as you noticed their frown;
You despised their obstruction and voted them down.
For your votes and your labour in crushing the cranks
Mr. Punch and the children award you their thanks.
AN advertisement in The Motor quotes the testimony of
a gentleman from Moreton-in-the-Marsh, who states that
he has run a certain car “nearly 412,500 miles in four
months, and is more than pleased with it.” As this works
out (on a basis of twenty-four hours' running per diem) at
about 143 miles per hour, we have pleasure in asking what
the police are doing in Moreton-in-the-Marsh and its vicinity.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TRAP FOR GOUNTRY MIGE.
MR. PUNCH's UNTRUSTWORTHY GUIDE To
LONDON.
CHAPTER XV.
London's Humour.
You have already had a taste of
London's humour in Mr. PlowdeN's
Court, and probably you have been
convulsed a }. times a day ever
since your arrival by some repartee of
the street, made either by cabmen or
bus drivers, every one of whom, as is
well known, is a humorist in disguise—
often so well disguised as to be un-
discoverable. Possibly you yourself
have been the butt of an original sally,
such as “Get your hair cut" or
“There goes old Bill Bailey,” and if so
we hope you did justice to the wit,
because the theory that London's
drivers are witty has got to
remain, after kippers, sausages, and
our mother's mother, only two topics—
alcoholic poisoning and marital infidelity.
With the mention of these, the catalogue
is complete. No comedian can be sure
of a laugh who deals with any other
theme, and no comedian can fail of a
laugh who offers himself as a heroic
practitioner in either of those two last-
mentioned branches of humour.
When we come to genuinely impromptu
wit, the locus classicus is of course Capel
Court, and after Capel Court the Law
Courts. Perhaps it would be well to
take the Law Courts first, for here that
laughter which resides always in paren-
theses—thus, “(laughter)”—is at its
best, and that is what you want, we
suppose. The quickest route to the
consummation is by way of the artless
query. A Counsel, we will suppose,
mentions a light of the stage or the turf,
Capel Court humour, but there are
other manifestations too, such as the
exchanged hat, or umbrella filled with
rice and rolled up again.
But we must stop. We have perhaps
said enough to show that London is
not the grey city it has sometimes been
said to be; not the “stony-hearted
step-mother” of DE QUINCEy's Confes-
sions; but the home of innocent mirth
and laughter—if only one knows where
to go for them.
TO AN ARTIST IN NEWSPAPER
POSTERS.
To one who, on the morning bills
The World's gyrations summarises,
Plays to the public taste in thrills,
And dishes up our daily crisis;
Whose web of Life's a hectic tweed,
Of loud design, and coarse in tissue ;
Who writes that “he who
be fostered in every way. It
is as important a tenet of our
creed as that John BULL, the
typical Englishman, is an
antiquated beefy farmer with
a tendency to apoplexy.
London's humour may also
be found in its fine flower in
the music halls, where our
greatest and most successful
laughter-makers bring off
their triumphs.
You may perhaps know
something of the process by
which herrings are split open,
dressed and dried for more
leisurely consumption than is
possible when the fish is fresh.
The process to which we
allude is known as kippering,
and the herring thus kippered
is a breakfast-table delicacy. -
There seems to be nothing very comic
about it. And yet, such is the Londoner's
quickness and sense of humour, no one
on the music-hall stage can mention
the word kipper without plunging the
audience into abysses of mirth.
The sausage is equally provocative;
but that perhaps is more to be under-
stood, since from the beginning of time
it has been an article of humour to
affect that the sausage contained every-
thing except pig-dogs and horses in
particular, and after them cats and
buttons, and so forth. Such is our
respect for antiquity that in England
we laugh at everything that our parents
and grandparents laughed at before us,
particularly at our mother's mother.
Anyone who doubts this has only to
visit the latest and most original example
of what, in one of our rare bursts of
irony, we call musical comedy.
The list of the favourite and guaran-
teed jokes of Londoners has not been
exhausted, but very nearly so. There

let us say, for example, a Springbok.
Here is the really witty Judge's oppor-
tunity. “What,” he asks with an
exquisite air of perplexity and polite
lunacy, “what is a Springbok?” On
these words the Court begins to rock
and stagger—to the total disregard of
the pathetic notice on the wall, “Please
do not split” – and another joke is
added by the reporters to the great and
shining roll.
At Capel Court, where the stockbrokers
gambol, the wit is of a more practical
nature. Objection might be urged by
a purist against the humour of such a
question as “What is a Springbok?”
or “Who is CAMILLE CLIFFORD 2" but
there can be no question that it is
funny to affix secretly to a financier's
back a placard bearing the words,
“Please kick me.” In the intervals of
money-making that joke has been
thought of by quite a number of City
men and instantly acted upon. The
placard is the principal vehicle for

While yet thy hand its skill retains
We shall not fail of our sensation.
ON hearing of the Reichstag's refusal
to vote supplies for the war, the Herreros
expressed great sympathy for the KAISER
in his pecuniary embarrassment. They
are a sporting lot, and we understand
that they have offered to advance a few
sinews of war (in kind, of course—beads,
feathers, rum, &c.), so that the enemy
may not have to break off the game in
the middle for want of funds.

LETTERS FROM “THE TIMES.”
[The ingenuity of the Manager of The Times
requires no assistance from the author of the
following types of appeal. Still he offers them
in that quarter with the faint hope that they
may suggest new fields of usefulness.]
I.
To John BRowN, SEA VIEW, BALHAM, S.W.
Printing House Square, E.C.
DEAR SIR,-Christmas is close upon
us, and no doubt the usual family
gathering will soon be assembling at
your table. Probably the one thing of
all others emblematic of this festive
season is the Turkey for the Christmas
Dinner. I can quite understand that,
as a busy man, you will have had no
time to give this important matter that
personal attention which it deserves ;
and indeed it is not unlikely that this
letter will be the first reminder you
have had of your duties as the host of
so many old friends and relatives.
The Times, as you are aware, is read
by “the Country Gentry and the well-to-
do and wealthy classes.” Now The Times
is too good to be, and consequently
seldom is, thrown away after the nobility
upstairs have finished with it. In nearly
every case it passes down to the servants'
hall; and the servants, when they have
read the leading articles, either give it
away or else sell it by weight to the
tradespeople with whom they deal. It
follows that all the high-class firms, such
as habitually deal with the nobility and
gentry, will see The Times regularly;
and among these firms it may be safely
assumed that severalgood-class poulterers
will be included . . . .
In view of the above considerations I
feel sure that you will see the importance
to yourself and your guests of advertising
in The Times for your usual Christmas
Turkey. I am, Yours faithfully,
THE MANAGER.
II."
To MRs. JoWEs, THE CottaGE, PUDDLETowN.
Printing House Square, E.C.
DEAR MADAM, I see from The East
Puddletown Sentinel that you have a
second-hand bassinette that you wish to
dispose of. Permit me to call your
attention to the excellence of The Times
as an advertising medium for this class
of property. The Times, as you are
aware, is read by “the Country Gentry and
the well-to-do and wealthy classes.” Now
in such families it is above all necessary,
for reasons of entail into which I need
not enter here, that a direct descent in
the male line should be ensured. It
follows that in nearly every mansion and
ancestral hall (where The Times is taken)
there is to be found some little child or
other, playing on the hearth, blissfully
unconscious of the great inheritance
which is one day to be his. Further, it
may be safely assumed that the parents
or grandparents of such a child, being
in need of a perambulator, mail-cart, or
bassinette in which to wheel him about
the wooded grounds or by the margin
of the well-stocked lake, would consult
the advertisement columns of The Times
before making their purchase.
In view of the above considerations
I feel sure you will see the importance
to yourself, and the child who has now
outgrown this relic of his youthful days,
of advertising in The Times your wish
to dispose of your bassinette.
I am, Yours faithfully
THE MANAGER.
III.
To MASTER THOMAS RoBINSON,
THE COLLEGE, CLIFFBOROUGH.
Printing House Square, E.C.
DEAR SIR, - Before your Academy
closes for the vacation, and you return
once more to the congenial atmosphere
of the home circle, permit me to call
your attention to a matter of some
moment to yourself.
In a few days from now you will
doubtless be receiving those monetary
offerings, from uncles and other rela-
tives, so usual at this season of the year.
No sooner will the coins be in your
pockets than you will begin to wonder
how you can lay them out with most
advantage to yourself. Probably you
will decide to spend a good propor-
tion of them in the purchase of foreign
stamps to add to your collection. Permit
me to call your attention to the excellence
of The Times as an advertising medium
for this class of goods.
The Times, as you are aware, is read
by “the Country Gentry and the well-to-do
and wealthy classes.” Now such families,
being of substantial means and able to
indulge their every whim, will in many
cases spend a great part of their time
abroad in foreign countries; it being
generally recognised that of all luxuries
that of travel is the most to be desired.
Further, it may be safely assumed that,
while abroad, they will contract many
new friendships among the natives of the
countries through which they pass, and
that these new friends will desire to
keep up a correspondence with them on
their return to their English homes.
We thus see that it is practically certain
that, in all mansions where The Times
is taken, the daily post may be counted
upon to contain numerous letters bearing
foreign stamps upon their envelopes.
Again, it generally happens in these
noble families that at least one member
of them has either enlisted in some
Colonial corps, or has had to emigrate
suddenly to one of our Dependencies.
What more likely than that he should
write home at least once each mail to say
how happy he feels in his new life? It
follows that the fortunate recipients of
these letters (and of those from foreign
countries that I mentioned above) will
have many duplicate stamps in their
possession, and will be only too glad to
dispose of them at an unusually cheap
rate.
In view of the above considerations I
feel sure you will see the importance of
inserting at once an advertisement in
The Times to call attention to your need
of good stamps for your album.
I am, Yours faithfully,
THE MANAGER.
THE LAST GROUSE.
(December 10.)
'Tis the last grouse of Autumn
Disturbed on the hill,
And the yells of the beaters
Are piercing and shrill;
In my butt I await him,
Yet nothing espy,
Except the dark moorland,
Except the dark sky.
Oh! the prospect is dreary,
With snow on the ridge,
And weather more suited
For firelight and Bridge;
On the wings of a blizzard
With black clouds behind,
The last grouse of Autumn
Comes whirring down wind.
Time was when in August
He rose from my boot,
And he gave me an instant,
Though I missed him, to shoot;
But now, a tough veteran
Of whipcord and wire,
He's a speck far to leeward
Before I can fire.
I'll not hit thee, thou last one,
So swift and so tough,
Even granting I see thee,
Which is doubtful enough :
Thus vainly I scatter
My pellets like hail,
At what I conclude is
Thy vanishing tail.

THE WHISPERING WEEK.
I.
This is the whispering week.
I don't mean to say that there has
been no whispering in the few weeks
immediately preceding it; but this is
whispering week above all others.
There is whispering in every corner-
whispering and caballing, plotting and

planning, arranging and calculating, and
a great deal of counting of money.
And every plot and every plan is
being made for someone's happiness.
Mostly, perhaps, for mother's.
But for father's, too, and for the
happiness of sisters and brothers and
uncles and aunts and cousins and rela-
tions and schoolfellows.
And cook.
Everyone is to have something, even
if it is only a joke, such as a lump of
coal done up in heaps of pieces of paper.
For not only is this the whispering
week, it is also the great week for brown
paper and tissue paper and string.
Yes, and sealing-wax.
During the whispering week you may
smell sealing-wax all over the house,
and you must be very careful how you
open drawers and cupboards, because
you may come on a pile of parcels that
you ought not to know anything about.
But everyone is careful.
II.
This is the whispering week.
The whisperers' faces wear expressions
of triumph and mischief and the most
important secrecy.
And if you had sharp ears and were
invisible you would hear such phrases
as these :-
“I’ve only got two-and-sevenpence
altogether.”
“But I wanted to give her that.”
“Oh, not another photograph frame.”
“I’m sure he's got a match-box.”
“I shan’t tell you, of course, but I
know what father's going to give you.”
“Did you give four-three each, for
them? Why" they're only three-three
at BLACKLEY's ’’
“Well, I spent my last penny this
morning, so everybody else will have to
have cards.”
III.
This is the whispering week.
It is also the week of woolwork
against time, and embroidery in extremis.
It is the week when most of the
tea-cosies and egg-warmers and kettle-
holders and soft slippers of the world
are finished.
It is the week of secret sewing, when
work is hurriedly scurried away or
hidden under a cloth directly the door-
handle is turned.

PERSONALLY we should be resting after

The accusation so often levelled against

Fluffy Girls had a smart line each to say
when RUPERT tried to kiss us all in turn.
Mine was, “Ah ! there's many a slip

me some business.
He said, “Just put your tongue out
when you say it, saucily, like this.”
That was easy enough, but it made it
rather hard to enunciate clearly, and
when we went through the scene again
he changed it. He said, “When you

face like a Gaiety photograph.
That was much easier, and I did it
perfectly when we went through the
scene again, only I put my finger on my
mouth when I said “cup,' and poured
out tea at ‘lip.’ And next time I did
the business all right, but I said,
“There's many a lip between the slip
and the cup,” and Mr. WALKER lit a
cigarette, which is said to be a very bad
sign with him.
Just then an awful scrubby man,
who I supposed had come about the
gas, came out of a corner, where he had
been sitting watching us, and said:
“Don’t you reckon, Mr. WALKER, that
she might sort of pretend to slip on the
floor when she says “slip '?” Mr.
WALKER said it was a very good, novel
idea, and I did it that way next time
and got the words all right too.
The scrubby man, who was Mr. STEIN,
the Manager, then said: “Don’t you
reckon, Mr. WALKER, it’d be bright if
she held a cup behind her back till the
word ‘cup, and then showed it to
RUPERT 2'' Mr. WALKER, who I could
see was getting quite annoyed with him,
said he thought it was rather too much
business to crowd one line with. But
Mr. STEIN said: “I reckon she kin do
it if she'll hustle.”
So they got a cup and we did the
scene all over again. But by this time
I was getting rather tired, and mixed
up the beastly “slip” and “cup" again,
and Mr. WALKER went and strode up
and down on the prompt side, trying
to get the thing right in his own head.
When he came back he was very
kind, and explained it all to me so
nicely. Just before we began again
Mr. STEIN. suggested that I should drop
the cup on the stage, because it is
always a sure laugh if you can break a
bit of china in a play. Mr. WALKER
said, “Certainly,” and RUPERT lent me
his tobacco pouch to drop during re-
hearsal. But when I got my cue again
I clean forgot to drop it. I was getting
right down nervous now, for all the
other girls were saying hateful things
under their breath.
Well, Mr. WALRER looked at me for
quite a minute, and then he said: “My
love” – oh! so cruelly—“you ought
not to be an actress. You ought to be
a producer, my angel. Tell me, my pet,
do you really prefer your way to mine?
because if so you must get another show
to do it in, my beautiful adored one.”
So I burst into tears and told him
that I was engaged as a Show Lady and
not as a Juggling Speciality, and I
couldn't be expected to learn all that
business in half a minute.
Then Mr. STEIN came back to say that
he thought he'd keep the china-breaking
till the third act, which wanted strength-
ening. So Mr. WALKER said I needn't
drop the cup. He said: “Just do it
the way I showed you before,” and
simply shouted, “Silence!”
But when I got my cue I found that
I'd forgotten my line altogether, and
so I fainted.

ExtRACTED FRom the DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, December
10.-House this afternoon presented
appearance indicative of historic occasion.
All seats on floor thronged at Question
time. Aliens from Treasury Bench settled
on steps of SPEAKER's chair or in Gang-
way. Side galleries filled. Strangers'
galleries banked up with humanity.
The Peers, who had their own little con-
stitutional crisis in matter of Plural
Voting Bill, forsook their chamber,
crowding the gallery as if they were
pittites awaiting the opening of doors
at popular theatre on a first night.
“They ought to have tea served out
to them,” said Lough, looking up and
gazing with compassionate eye on noble
Lords huddled at the doorway of their
gallery, hoping somehow at some time
to edge their way in.
Cabinet secret well kept. Probably

Would Ministers compromise with the
Lords, or would they, recognising the
hopelessness of situation, send back
their amendments, leaving with them the
responsibility of modifying them, or of

followed on detailed demonstration that
the Lords' amendments “deliberately,
intentionally, destroyed the whole fabric
of the Bill.” At the question Members
bent forward in attitude of strained
attention. St. AUGUSTINE did not long
dally with curiosity. The Government
had, he said, made up their mind to ask
the House to return to the Lords their
amendments as a whole.
Hereupon the crowded benches to
right of SPEAKER broke forth in volcanic
burst of cheering. Below and above
the Gangway it resounded. It was
taken up by Labour party on Opposi-

[DECEMBER 19, 1906.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Friday afternoon.—Had C.-B. adopted
alternative course open to him, moving
that Lords' amendments be considered
this day three months, a strange predi-
cament would have been possible. The
motion would, of course, have been car-
ried by a large majority, and the Order
entered on Journals of the House.
It is a familiar method of moving the
rejection of a Bill. In the ordinary
course of events, when the interval of
delay is covered, Parliament is not sit-
ting, and the Order necessarily lapses.
But three months hence the House will
be in full swing of the new Session, and
might be called upon to fulfil its own
mandate, and on the appointed day take
up the Lords' amendments.
Seems grotesquely improbable. Yet the
MEMBER FOR SARK recalls an instance of
its actually happening. The late Lord
DENMAN brought in a Woman's Suffrage
Bill in the third week of February. It
was quickly disposed of by the formula
of ordering it to be read again on that
day six months. It seemed thereby
safely shelved. It came to pass that,
business being superabundant, the House
was sitting when in the third week in
August the appointed day came round.
Up gat Lord DENMAN. Reminded their
Lordships of their undertaking, and
Fº that the Bill should forthwith
read a second time.
By some ingenious discrimination
between calendar months and lunar
months the House wriggled out of diffi-
culty. But it was felt that old Lord
DENMAN, too often made the butt of
supercilious authority, had scored.
Business done.-A little Scotch.
THE CONNUBIAL AEROPLANE.
Smith. Oh ! do sit still, dear. What
are you wriggling about for?
Mrs. S. I was only putting my hat
straight, darling.
Smith. Never mind your hat. I want
to keep her quite steady. Don't you
see that chap down there taking a snap-
shot at us? -
Mrs. S. Of course I do. That's why
I wanted— Look out, dear, here
come the BROWNS. They live in the
white house just below us, you know.
Bow, dear, they’re quite good people.
Smith. He can't steer straight, any-
how—barging us into a beastly patch of
chimney smoke like that.
Mrs. S. Look out! there's a crow
coming. Oh, do be careful, it's one of
those fierce ones.
Smith. Where?—which way?—I can't
see it.
Mrs. S. On your left. He's coming
right at us O-o-oh !
Smith. Missed him by a hair, by Jove!
Confound these birds, we shall have to
exterminate them.
Mrs. S. That would be rather a pity,
too—the children like to see them about.
Still we could keep a few in cages for
them to look at, couldn't we? What's
it rocking for now?
Smith. That's because you're wrig-
gling again. You're making it rock.
Mrs. S. I'm not. I'm absolutely
rigid. There's something wrong — I
know there is Oh, what is it?
Smith. Only a bit of a squall. Here
comes the breeze. There—now she's
shifting. That's fine, isn't it?
Mrs. S. Yes, dear; but I shall be
awake all night with earache after this.
I've forgotten the cotton-wool again.
Why, there's a bit just below.
Smith. No-that's a sheep ; and look
at that little car crawling along. Aren't
you glad we sold ours for this 2
Mrs. S. Yes, dear, for most things,
but of course one misses not having the
road near to fall on. There now—it's
beginning to wobble again. Do make
it stop—there's no wind now !
Smith. Well, I'm trying to-I expect
it's that off-wing wants a little oil.
Mrs. S. That's made it worse! Oh,
we're going—oh-oh !
Smith. For heaven's sake leave go.
How can I see to things with you cling-
ing round my neck? There, she's right
again now.
Mrs. S. I'm sorry, dear, but when it
does like that I always think of the
children.
Smith. Well, so do I–but if you are
going to lose your head every time we tilt
I shan't bring you up with me again.
Mrs. S. Don't say that—I couldn't
bear to let you come alone, darling.
Smith. Shall we have the sherry and
sandwiches now? You've got them,
haven't you?
Mrs. S. I had until we began to
wobble, then I put them on the little
shelf behind.
Smith. There is no little shelf behind.
I took it off before we started to lighten
her. You've dropped them overboard,
that's what you've done.
Mrs. S. I'm so sorry—but I tied them to
a gas-bag, so we can soon pick them up.
Smith. One gas-bag won't keep them
both up—there they are, drifting over
the ground just above the road down
there. What's that chap waving for?
Mrs. S. He's not waving, he's leap-
ing up and trying to catch them before
they float over the wall. It's a poor
old tramp. Look, he's got them. He
thinks it's a present—he's looking up
and taking his cap off to us. How sweet!
Smith. Very sweet—to drop things
overboard like that. You're always
doing it.
Mrs. S. It was quite an accident. If
you are hungry let's go home and have
lunch.
Smith. I'm not particularly hungry.
Mrs. S. Well, personally, I couldn't
touch a bit of anything. The oscillation
always , makes me rather queer—and
you're looking a little green, dear.
Smith. Green — nonsense — l'm all
right—it never has any effect on me.
Still, of course, if you really want to go
home I'll take you at once.
Mrs. S. Thank you, darling—we've
had a simply perfect fly, but I should love
to lie down a little while on a fixed sofa.
THE VICTIM OF SCIENCE.
[In an article in the Rerue Dr. MAURICE DE
FLEURY declares that the chief cause of fatigue
lies not in sticking to one subject, but in
frequent change of occupation.]
IN days of old, if dons seemed dry
And lectures desolation,
I thought it was the thing to try
A change of occupation.
When PLATO bored, when HoyſER
snored,
When proses came too stiffly,
Said Conscience, “Get a cigarette,
Or paddle down to Iffley.”
In later life the selfsame plan
I carefully adopted :
As soon as anything began
To weary me, I dropped it.
If I felt slack, or found a lack
Of thrill about a Blue Book,
I'd go to lunch, or pick up Punch,
Or dally with a new book.
And do not overlook the fact
That Conscience only guided
My conduct in each little act,
However small, that I did.
I'd take a day to drive away
The megrims or a liver,
And not because AMANDA was
Week-ending up the river.
But ah! the course to which I clung
With such entire devotion
Is Scouted now as being sprung
From some fallacious notion.
“Change ” cries the sage in learned
rage,
“It’s perfectly untrue it
Brings rest to you. Whate'er you do,
Pray do not cease to do it.
“Don’t dance about from this to that.
The longer one continues
Whatever task one may be at,
The more one saves one's sinews.
Beyond a doubt nought tires you out
Like endless alternation;
Would you keep fit and fresh in wit
Don't change your occupation.”
The wise man speaks to ears that hear,
For who would dare gainsay him?
It seems to me supremely clear
I cannot but obey him.
And since the knack of being slack
In me is seldom lacking,
The simplest change I can arrange
Is just to keep on slacking.

FORECASTS FOR 1907.
III.-A VERY SMART GARDEN PARTY. DAYLIGHT FIREworks.
LITTLE LEGAL DECISIONS.
[After the curious legal decisions which have
upset the Licensing Act of 1904, and the
Cemeteries Act, and (until the result of the
recent appeal) the Education Act of 1902, we
may expect in the future to hear of even
quainter legal pronouncements.]
Licensed Victuallers Association v. the
Dean and Chapter of Westminster.
(Before Mr. Justice CoDDEM.)
IN giving his decision in this important
case Mr. Justice CoDDEM said that he
had to consider the precise wording of
the Act, which limited the opening of
licensed premises on Sunday. He could
not consider what was in the mind of
the legislators who framed the law. The
law stated absolutely that no licensed
premises must be opened (save to bond
fide travellers) before 12.30 on Sunday.
The Dean, whom he must congratulate
on the straightforward way in which
he gave his evidence, admitted in the
witness-box that Westminster Abbey
was licensed for the solemnisation of
marriages. Therefore, though with
great reluctance, he was compelled to
grant the injunction asked for by the
plaintiffs, and order that Westminster
Abbey should not be opened before
12.30 on Sunday save and except to
bonā fide travellers.
(Before Mr. Justice BooDLE.)
Pankhurst and Billington v. the Revising
Barrister for the Strand Parlia-
mentary Division.
In giving judgment Mr. Justice
BooDLE said the whole point of the
case turned on the meaning of the word
“man” in the Franchise Act of 1885.
He was unable to take into account the
interpretation put upon it by the Houses
of Parliament. The question was, “Did
man embrace woman 2" . He thought
that the mass of evidence produced by
the plaintiffs, which proved, conclusively
to his mind, that they had been em-
braced by policemen, stewards, and
excited politicians, settled the point. He
therefore granted the injunction asked
for-that the Revising Barrister should
place plaintiffs' names on the roll of
Parliamentary voters.
In the Court of Appeal, before Lords
Justices JUGSON, PITCHER and SNOOZEM.
Duddle v. Dodger.
Lord Justice JUGSON, in announcing the
decision of the Court, said this was an
appeal against a County Court Judge's
award under the Workmen's Compensa-
tion Act. Appellant alleged that the
words of the Act, “common employ-
ment,” did not cover the case of a
plumber who, when sent to repair a
broken water-pipe, looked at the work,
then went into a public-house and broke
his leg by slipping on a slide on the
road. Had the respondent DoDGER broken
his leg when coming away from a public-
house he (Lord Justice JUGSON) would
have had doubts whether the words
“common employment” covered the case,
but after the mass of evidence produced
as to trade customs he had no hesitation
in pronouncing that in going to a
public-house during working hours the
plaintiff was following his common
employment. The appeal would there-
fore be dismissed, and the County Court
Judge's award of £150 compensation
sustained.
Lord Justice PITCHER agreed with his
learned brother.
Lord Justice SNoozEM, on being
awakened, said that he agreed with his
learned brethren. In his opinion the
weight of evidence was entirely against
the validity of the will. (Laughter in
Court, which was instantly suppressed.)
From Sir Oliver Lodge's Scientific
Catechism.
“We have no knowledge which enables us
to assert the absence of intelligence anywhere.”
No knowledge perhaps; but a pretty
shrewd suspicion in one or two cases.

The strength of the team will be
greatly increased by the inclusion of
Mr. LEO MAXSE. A slight difficulty
arose in consequence of Mr. MAXSE's
pronounced Teutophobia, but on his
being assured that the music of Herr
MAX SCHILLINGs was not in favour at
Potsdam, and that MAX DAREwski has
not yet been kissed by any member of
the German Royal family, he courteously
waived his objections. It will be Mr.
MAXSE's special function to act as an
antidote and counterblast to the exces-
sive urbanity of the Captain and of Sir
HERBERT MAxwell, to illustrate the
methods of the Mohocks as
charming knockabout duologue entitled
“The Two Macs Abroad,” which will
form a special feature of the tour.
Lastly, Mr. BourCHIER, having quali-

of Macbeth for inclusion in the team,
will accompany it in the character of

It is all very progressive—and Arcadian.

Mr. Swift MACNEILL and Sir ANTONY

can obtain an invitation under any

prised, as it appears that the ladies
wear swimming club costume without
any skirts, while the gentlemen sport the
ordinary university bathing dress. We
further learn that it is curiously difficult
to recognise people one has known all
one's life when they come swimming
past—especially the ladies, who are dis-
guised by the rubber caps over their
hair. It seems a negative kind of
domino for the natatory incognita, but,
anyhow, this novel bal masqué “causes
the greatest fun imaginable.” Still,
there does not appear to be much oppor-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs (HEINEMANN) have much of the
charm of the otherwise incomparable PEPys. They are written
with the same simplicity of style, the same graphic touch.
They differ inasmuch as the earlier diarist did not contem-
plate publication. Whereas the Prince authorised it. But
he did not live to see proofs of the work, and the friend to
whom he committed it felt at liberty to reproduce the MS.
without editing it with niggard hand. It was the Prince's
habit to keep a journal in which he recorded interviews with
the eminent personages with whom his high diplomatic office
brought him in contact. Nor does he refrain from personal
comment, often piquant, upon his interlocutors. His diary
illumines two notable epochs in European history. The
first, the Franco-German war, the second, the fall of BIS MARCK.
It is naturally with the inner councils of statesmen rather
than the achievements of Field Marshals that the Prince
deals. We see BIs MARCK, whilst France lay stricken after
the great struggle, taking pains that she should not rise
again. On February 18, 1874, BISMARCK remarked to
HoHENLoHE: “We want to keep the peace. But if France
goes on arming so as to be ready in five years and is bent
on war at the end of that time, then we will declare war in
three years.” As for the “Dropping of the Pilot,” immor-
talised in our John TENNIEL's Cartoon, Prince HoHENLoHE
makes it clear that for fully fifteen years BISMARCK had been
threatening to retire. Like a pampered butler or a wayward
housemaid, whenever things did not go entirely to his liking
he “gave notice.” The old EMPEROR, believing him in-
dispensable, time after time coaxed him to stay. The young
EMPEROR, who believes indispensability is confined to himself,
astonished the Imperial Chancellor by one day accepting
his reiterated demand to be relieved from office. From this
and many other stirring episodes Prince HoHENLoHE lifts the
veil with uncompromising hand. We are not only told
exactly what happened, but have set down the very words
used by the parties to the drama. It is a long time since
so valuable a contribution was made to modern history.
I must confess that I read The Magic Jujubes (ALSTON
Rivers) with a certain disappointment, knowing as I did
something of Miss THEODORA WILSON WILSON's other work.
Speaking generally, I felt that the fairy part of the tale
missed somehow the true magic, and that the every-day part
brought up in one's mind odious comparisons with the
incomparable E. NESBIT; so I selected my most pointed
“G,” and began (regretfully) to say so. Then, however, I
reflected as follows: (1) This book is for children and you
are no longer a child; (2) Previously you had been reading
a problem novel by one of those strong silent authors;
(3) You had a pretty rotten dinner, and your pipe won't
draw. So I packed the book up and sent it off to a little
girl of twelve. She read it straight off and was enchanted
with it; and her sisters, who are in the middle of it, love it;
and her father, who glanced at it surreptitiously, thinks it is
charming; and her mother, who said it was time for them to
go to bed . . . and her grandmother, who said that they
needn't take the book with them . . . and her . . . Well,
perhaps I’m getting older than I thought I was.
I prefer the rapier with which Mr. PERCY WHITE once
spitted the suburbs in his mirth-provoking Mr. Bailey-
Martin to the weighty bludgeon with which he now trounces
the West-End. Mr. Bailey-Martin made me laugh, out loud
and often ; The Eight Guests (CoNSTABLE) is a surfeit of
satire and the Smart Set. I don't want to meet any of them,
least of all the smart mercenary Duchess who tries to make
her niece marry the smart and vulgar millionaire, the host
of the story. Nor do I much care for the smart niece, nor
the smart young man about town whom she eventually
prefers to Mr. Moneybags. The millionaire's plan for strip-
ping the eight guests on board his yacht of their social
veneer is ingenious and fairly successful, and is an attempt
to get out of the ordinary rut of novels of this class. But,
even here, it seems to me that the satire is spread too thick.
Next time, Mr. PERCY White, could you see your way to
diluting it with the oil of laughter, which maketh glad the
heart of man 2 I know you have some in stock.
OLIVER ONIONS' Back o' the Moon
Tells of a coiners' gang; -
The plot doesn't thicken remarkably soon,
And it doesn't go off with a bang;
But the time of the tale
Is beyond the pale
Of latter-day strife and racket—
Seventeen-seventy-eight
Is the date,
(HURST AND BLACKETT
Back it).
Oliver ONIONs' trick is to give
Sketches which seem detached –
Slight in themselves, yet cumulative
As the various parts are matched;
There are tears and smiles
And detective wiles
And hanging and love and fighting;
Sport of an excellent sort,
In short;
And a capital screed
To read.
Dr. MATLAND makes haste to mention that sixty friends have
assisted him in preparation of The Life and Letters of Leslie
Stephen (DUckworth). There is here ominous hint of em-
barrassment of riches. Such consequence is apparent only
in a somewhat unusual form of biography. There is some
lack of ordered narrative, a filling and tacking on the course,
which is rather picturesque than objectionable. Modestly
keeping himself in the background Dr. MATLAND allows
STEPHEN to speak for himself by his letters, the picture being
filled in by notes from the threescore friends. It is a pro-
foundly interesting, on the whole a sad, story. A shy man,
more swiftly bored than any fellow-sufferer of his acquain-
tance, he was brought into contact at varied points with the
world academic and literary, and having to earn his living
was fain to make the best of it. Reviewing his career
towards its close, he pronounced it a failure, inasmuch as he
“had scattered himself too much.” “What with journalism
and dictionary-making, I have,” he growls, “been a Jack of
all trades.” The pity of it is that, having given up some of
his best years to editing Cornhill, he retired with a sense of
failure, from consciousness of which the delicate care of his
colleagues could not shield him. Of the Dictionary of Bio-
graphy, in whose service he nearly killed himself, Dr.
AITLAND writes, “even before Mr. LEE's name appeared on
the title-page he was in some respects a better editor than
STEPHEN.” For a proud spirit these things were hard to
bear. LESLIE STEPHEN faced them with grim courage, and
went on with other work. His complex character is summed
up in a sentence written by an Alpine comrade: “Under a
somewhat brusque exterior he concealed one of the sweetest
and kindest hearts ever given to the sons of men.”

PRIZE ESSAY.
WHAT To Do witH THE ARISTOCRACY 2
(With acknowledgments to “The Speaker.”)
WHAT can be done under existing
laws is, I fear, not very much, or, at
any rate, nothing adequate. Emigra-
tion is, of course, a palliative, but for
two reasons it can never provide a
complete remedy: one is that the number
of voluntary emigrants is not, and is
not likely to be, nearly large enough to
meet the requirements of the situation;
and the other, that it is not easy forcibly
to deport aristocratic undesirables.
But if under existing laws not much
can be done we can at least pave the
way for the good time when by a
change of laws the evils of an here-
ditary aristocracy will automatically
disappear.
To descend from generalities to con-
crete suggestions, there are two ways in
which scope can be found for utilising
the talents of the aristocracy before the
abolition of the Second Chamber, the
repeal of the game laws, and the exter-
mination of the episcopate.
1. As Mr. KEIR HARDIE has pointed
out in his article in The Nineteenth
and the gentleman some racing results.]
Century, there is no reason why aristo-
crats should be denied admission to the
ranks of the Socialist Party. On the
contrary, as the course of history shows,
your déclassé aristocrat is often a more
ardent and efficient revolutionary than
the son of humble parentage.
2. An even more satisfactory solution
of the problem, however, is foreshadowed
by that sternly democratic paper The
Daily Chronicle. Chichester, as we
gather from a vivid article, has been
rescued from decrepitude by the advent
of a bevy of high-born “society actresses.”
“Ancient Chichester has even now its
young blood, its passionate hearts, its
Romeos and Juliets,” thanks to the
performance of a comic opera written,
composed, and performed by amateurs.
The “good honest bourgeoisie of
Chichester’ made holiday to see the
piece, which “in the music and in
some of the acting and singing” proved
“a good deal better than anything that
Chichester is likely to get from profes-
sional sources.” The daughter of a
Peer displayed a “delightful voice,
beautifully trained; ” the singing of
flº and madrigals was “quite wonder-
ully accomplished; ” and the lyrics
and airs were “often much prettier and
more taking than the ruck of what one
hears in musical comedies.”
The note of lyrical ecstasy which con-
templation of these high-born amateurs
elicits from this stalwart Radical is not
without its significance. Against the
invasion of the professional stage by
titled histrions every true democrat must
set his face like a flint. But as unsalaried
amateurs these gilded popinjays, with ||
their Bond Street gowns and “every-
thing adorable by way of millinery,”
may temporarily justify their existence
and mitigate the harshness and dulness
of the labourer's surroundings with the
amenities of gratuitous musical comedy.
If “crumbling old Chichester” can
be awakened to gaiety and romance in
the very heart of winter, the most con-
gested districts may well yield to the
revivifying influence of aristocratic
“open-work ankles.” What Radical
whose mind is not caged in the prison
house of a provincial caucus, or entangled
in the meshes of some central home for
wire-pullers, can regard without emotion
the utilizing of this great national asset
for the purpose of wooing labour back
to the land and counteracting the
general spirit of feudalism and squire-
archy that still survives?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
_*
LONDON'S LIGHTNING PROGRESS.
Increased Facilities of Transit.
Through Tickets from Piccadilly to the Temple
To Meet the Needs of our Best Intellects.
Journey Accomplished at nearly Four Miles an Hour.
My idea was to achieve by electric, traction the trip
from the hollow of Piccadilly to Bouverie Street: that is to
say, from the heart of Clubland to the head-quarters of the
Press and the purlieus of the Law. This las always been
the beaten track of London's leading intellects—her barristers
and her journalists. Here then, if anywhere in this Metro-
polis of the World, I should enjoy, in their fulness, those
modern facilities of transit over which Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE has
lately spread his benediction. I had no use for the old
methods: the tedious lurching horse-bus; the hansom-cab
(no vehicle, this, for a man of refined nerves); the four-wheeler
(an admirable means of transport, but never to be found). I
could not tolerate the smelling, screaming, skidding motor-
bus. I had no stomach for an altercation, on my office steps,
with the domineering chauffeur of a motor-cab. And to foot
the two miles on a heavy luncheon was unthinkable.
A Bad Start.
A short but stimulating walk took me to the Down Street
Station of the Finsbury-Park-Great-Northern-Piccadilly-
Brompton-and-Hammersmith Railway (Underground Elec-
tric IRailways Company of London Limited). The scaffolding
was still in situ quo, and the entrance had a forbidding air.
I gathered from a bystander that some days must yet elapse
before the station would be opened to the public. Being
pressed for time I determined not to wait; and so returned
to my Club and began again. (Waste of 3 minutes.)
Walking Exercise in the Underworld.
I now headed up the slope of Piccadilly to Dover Street
Station and bought a triple combination ticket to the Temple.
The price was very reasonable indeed. The ticket was then
punctured and I descended into the bowels of the earth.
After a pleasant promenade, with many quaint turns to
vary the monotony of tubular prospects, I boarded a train
for Piccadilly Circus at about the moment when I should,
if proceeding on foot, have reached that centre of activity.
Arrived there after a brief transit, I alighted to have my
ticket again punctured ; and passed through gallery after
gallery of glazed catacombs and up flights of steps admirably
hewn from the living clay, and so entered a train upon the
Baker-Street-and-Waterloo Railway which bore me to the
Embankment Station.
Ascensus Averni.
Once more alighting, I took two sharp turns and found
myself at the bottom of a prodigious acclivity leading on
and on into what seemed an interminable vista. A man
glanced at my ticket and I was permitted to pass. The
upward grade is not really more than one in three, and the
ground is thoroughly corrugated to prevent back-slip; but
rubber soles are strongly recommended. Battling with a
terrific head-wind I at last accomplished the straight ascent
(actually less than a quarter of a mile in length) and came
upon signs of human habitation. . From here I deflected
my course and reached the summit by a short flight of steps.
Then a stretch on the level and I stood panting at the portals
of the Charing Cross Station on the Metropolitan District
Railway, where a man took a large slice, which I could ill
spare, out of the remnant of my ticket.
Where to wait for First Class.
Taking my stand at the back end of the platform so as to
be opposite the first-class carriage when it arrived, I waited.'
When the train came, all except the last three carriages had
been taken off, and so the first-class carriage drew up
opposite the middle of the platform. Naturally I could not
get to it in time. So I lost that train.
Then I took my stand in the middle of the platform and
Waited. And the next train was of the full size, and the
first-class carriage was at the far end, last but one. Naturally
I could not get to it in time. So I lost that train too.
Then I took my stand half-way between the middle and
the end of the platform, so as to be ready for a train of either
size. And so I had just time to scramble into the first-class,
where I found a spare place between a navvy and a bootblack.
(Waste of time, 8% mins.)
The Unattainable Tram.
At the Temple Station I gave up my ticket—a mere
skeleton—and ascended into the light of day. It was then
a question whether I should take an L.C.C. tram. But the
L.C.C. had laid both sets of rails on the far side of the
road, knowing full well that nobody ever legins by being on
that side; and I did not care to wade there and back, knee-
deep in mud. So I walked the rest of the way, keeping to
the path where the trees have branches on the north side of
their trunks as well as on the south. -
Time for the two miles (or rather less)–42; mins.
But as I shall not try the Down Street Station again till it
has an entrance door and not so much scaffolding; and as I
shall know better another time where to stand at Charing
Cross Station so as to be within reach of a first-class carriage,
I think it would be fairer to deduct the 3 mins. and
S. mins, respectively wasted at these two points. Gross
time, then, 42 mins.; nett time, 31; or, since in dry weather
it would be feasible to attempt the crossing to the L.C.C.
trams, let us call it in round figures half-an-hour--for a little
under two miles.
So you see that, thanks to the remarkable development of
transit facilities in the Metropolis of the World, you can be
conveyed along the most necessary of all routes—namely,
from the heart of Clubland to the head-quarters of the Press
and the purlieus of the Law—at an average speed of very
little less than four miles an hour; and that, too, without
the necessity of having a man walking in front of you with a
red flag.
MATINS.
Anots.ED, I hear the milkman's cry,
The postman's rat-tat-tat,
And know the morning's letters lie
In heaps upon the mat.
“Nay, blankets,” murmur I, “are best,
And dawn has carcely shone.
An earthquake shall not mar my rest;
I mean to slumber on.”
The Cynic labels life a “sham,”
A “dream” the lover's bliss;
The Dryasdust finds germs in jam,
And poison in a kiss.
In vain “Awake " '' the factions scream,
And hurl me books to con;
If life's a cheat, and love a dream,
I mean to slumber on 1
“Mr. H. S. has, with his usual generosity, given the whole of the
employees at the Richmond Railway Station a couple of rabbits"—

It doesn't seem much, but it is always the kindly thought,
rather than the actual gift, that counts,

ticularly like that, after she'd eaten all
the omelette for breakfast. And then
Father says: “Well, he mustn't have so
much this time.’” JIMMY stopped and
wrestled inwardly with his wrongs.
“You know,” he blurted out at last,
“when you’ve got to spend the after-
noon in bed anyhow, to be told that you
mustn't have so much as last time–
well, it’s a bit rotten, isn't it?”
“It is, indeed.”
“I knew you’d back me up. Well,
that's the end of my story at present.”
“I see. Is there going to be a

“I suppose it depends on whether I
get any supper or not. I can't think
why they let you come up. They never
do ordinarily.”
“I came to interview you-to find
like so much tur-key as he
had last time. He was so ill be-fore.”
“There's a thought-ful lit-tle girl,”
said her Mamma.
“He must not have so much a-gain,"
said Papa.
Af-ter din-ner Mamma said, “Now
what would you like to do?”
“I would like to take some tea and
coal to the poor old peo-ple,” said MA-BEL:
“And JAMES is going to bed,” said
Papa.
“O Papa,” said his lit—tle daugh-ter.
“Let JAMEs take the coal to the poor
old peo-ple, and I will go to bed. Do
not pun-ish him.”
“Not much,” said JAMEs, as he went
up-stairs.
That ev-en-ing MA-BEL and her Papa
and Mamma had sup-per a-lone, for
James was still in bed.
“I do love Christ-mas Day," cried
MA-BEL. “I do hope all the poor lit-tle
child-ren are en-joy-ing it too.”

Suffice it to know that my country, in me,
Has a most economical asset.
A NAPOLEON's will and a TALLEYRAND's
tact
I add to the lungs of a Stentor,
With the heart of a fiend, for when
urchins are whacked,
My rôle is Assistant Tormentor;
Yet, if penknives occasion the spilling of
gore,
I am ready with bandage and plaster,
For such surgical skill is expected, and
more,
From a Junior Classical Master.
In order to quell diabolical pranks
I scowl on Young England at dinner;
I offer up grave semi-clerical thanks
On behalf of each juvenile sinner.
At supper I seize on unauthorised buns,
Enforcing dry biscuits and cocoa.
I interview screeching mammas, to whose
Sons
The “Head” has administered toko.
At night I must grind myself into my
grave,
Yet rise with Aurora on each day;
The rest of the year I'm a menial slave,
But a noble grandee upon Speechday.
My chat with papas on the liberal arts
Declares me their affluent patron;
Who knows I'm a hack who can
“treble” the parts
Of boot-boy and usher and matron 2
I teach little dolts of eleven to spell,
I toil like a lodging-house “skivvy ;”
Whene'er my employer is not very well
His form come to me with their Liry.
He cavils at all my best efforts—and yet
(Oh balm in a pedagogue's Gilead )
His manner is sweet when he asks me
to Set
A paper for him on the Iliad.
But now all the clouds from my prospect
are cleared
By the man whom.I honour and trustin.
My outlook on life has been very much
cheered
By thy generous statement, AUGUSTINE.
And when from my labours, at last, I'm
released
Beneath the cold formal “Hic jacet,”
They 'll add, “a great Statesman des-
cribed the deceased
As a most economical asset.”

THE HAUNTED EDITOR.
OUR SPECIAL CHRISTMAS STORY.
It was August; August, and a heat
wave at that | Exhausted in mind and
body with the completion of the most
arduous labour of the journalistic year,
the production of a Christmas Number
that should take time not by the fore-
lock but by the entire scalp, the Editor
of The Snappy Album had flung himself
back in his chair. “Out before any
of the others!” he murmured trium-
phantly.
The clock, which, in accordance with
the stern spirit of competition pervading
that dread abode, indicated an hour
somewhat in advance of the actual time,
was approaching midnight before the
Editor realised that the usual weekly
budget of illustration had still to be
made up. Fortunately, however, this
was not a matter of difficulty. “After
all,” he reflected, with weary gratitude,
“there is always SEY MOUR HICKs, and
our old friends of the Gaiety, and some-
body must have opened a new golf-links
somewhere.”
He was just thinking of rousing him-
self when the door of his sanctum was
flung suddenly open. “Inspector to see
you, Sir,” said a liveried menial, and
before he could reply that he was out
of town and not expected back for a
month, the Editor saw with annoyance
that his unbidden visitor stood already
within the room. The gaunt figure
towered threateningly above the editorial
chair; holly and mistletoe were wreathed
about its frosted locks, and its presence
seemed to be accompanied by a subtle
aroma of glazed paper and printer's ink.
The Editor gasped. “What Inspector
“Nuisances 2 ”
“An error on the part of your in-
formant,” replied the visitor calmly,
“for which we decline responsibility. I
said a Spectre, not Inspector. The mis-
take was perhaps natural.”
“Your voice,” ventured the Editor in
a more conciliatory tone, “is a trifle
husky. Did you—er—happen to mention
whose spectre you were 2"
“I do it now,” replied the Phantom.
“I am the embodiment of that burden
which has lain heavy on your soul for
weeks, that burden which you have but
now transferred to a forgiving public.
Tremble, rash Mortal I am the Ghost
of Christmas Numbers Past !”
The Editor trembled as directed.
“Just so,” he said politely.
“And these,” continued the Spectre,
“are my children; ” whereupon, follow-
ing a gesture of its bony hand, the
Editor observed at the far end of the
room a shadowy company whose appear-
ance struck him as unpleasantly familiar.
“Come,” said the Phantom, “look on
them more closely; they should be
friends of yours. Yonder stately maiden,
for example. See you naught to recog-
nise in her?”
At this, a young girl of haughty yet
benevolent appearance glided forward.
“Speak!” commanded the Phantom,
and the shadow spoke.
“I,” she said wearily, “am called Lady
Bountiful. Clad in becoming furs
visit the homes of needy cottagers, upon
whom I bestow that vague variety of
provender known as Christmas Cheer.
The glow of a robust if somewhat ani-
line colour in my cheeks contrasts effec-
tively with that of the pale recipients
of my bounty. I am known also under
various aliases, such as ‘The Errand of
Charity'; or, “A Friend in Need.' I
have been doing this sort of thing un-
interruptedly for years. I wish now to
retire on a small pension as a public
servant.”
“It is well,” said the Phantom
gloomily. “Next, please.”
The next was a rubicund and choleric
old gentleman with white hair. “My
name,” he began in an aggrieved voice,
“is Squire Jollyboys of Jolliboys Hall,
Blankshire, where I occupy myselſ with
country dances and fox-hunting, the
latter preferably after a heavy fall of
snow. I live exclusively upon tur-
keys * x
“Turkeys, ha!” ejaculated the
Spectre.
“And plum puddings,” continued
the old gentleman hotly, “a diet which
fills me with repulsion. After such a
meal it is my inevitable custom to em-
brace all my female guests beneath a
convenient mistletoe. I am sick of it.
The mere sight of a wassail-bowl makes
me shudder. I demand to be placed on
sick leave owing to chronic dyspepsia.”
“You have heard his plea,” said the
Ghost; “do you admit its justice?”
The Editor fidgeted uneasily. “How
the dickens ” he began, but the
Ghost interrupted him.
“You touch the spot,” it rejoined,
“for it is the DICKENs who is responsible.
But see ' Who follows now 2''
He pointed as he spoke to the forms
of three young men, who had silently
taken the place of Squire Jollyboys.
One was very tall and thin, another
very short and fat, and the third, by
way of distinguishing characteristic,
had red hair.
“We,” answered the tall member of
the trio immediately, “are of many
names and periods, but of one generic
title. We are The Three '''
He paused. “You know them?”
asked the Phantom sternly.
The Editor groaned. “I know them
well,” he said.
“You should,” continued the tall
young man. “For our career under
your auspices has been long and varied.
Clad in powder and brocade we have
led Them through the mazes of the
stately dance, or, in the costume of a
later age, have hunted in Their company,
broken the ice at skating parties with
Them 21
“Them?” queried the inexorable
Phantom, but the Editor checked him,
almost with a sob. “Yes, yes,” he
cried, “The Three Maidens. I admit
them also ! Have mercy!” But the
young man went on, “–and, later still,
have rescued Them from bicycle or
motor accidents. Presently it will be
Aeroplanes | The result however is
unalterable.”
“The result?” began the Inquisitor,
but again his victim broke in with
piteous haste. “I know,” he said
quickly; “a triple wedding at the village
church, and the departure of three
couples——”
“By pillion, motor, or flying-machine
as the case may be,” concluded the
young man. “The separable accidents
may differ slightly, but we ourselves
remain always and inevitably the same.
It was the everlasting monotony of it,”
resumed the young man, “that drove
us to come out with the others.”
“To come out?” repeated the Editor,
mystified.
“I should have warned you,” said
the Spectre sternly. “This is a Deputa-
tion. The employees whom year by
year you have so grossly overworked
have risen at last. Henceforward the
comic carol singers and the old gentle-
man in the nightcap who throws things
out of windows will go through their
dreary performance no longer; the yule-
log will remain ungarnered; and the
Christmas coach will discontinue its
annual adventure with the snow-drift.
Even the salmon-coloured children and
the impossibly curly dog, whose proud
motto, “Suitable for Framing,” boasts
your encouragement of the Arts, even
they have joined us. In a word, your
800 per cent. profits are at an end. We
have Struck '''
“Struck 1" screamed the Editor, sit-
ting bolt-upright in his chair.
“Yes, Sir, the clock has struck, Sir.”
answered the liveried menial politely,
“just gone twelve.”
So it was only a dream after all!
With a sigh of relief the Editor realised
that his trusted and familiar assistants
were still to be depended on, and next
morning the summer sunlight gleamed
upon a thousand bookstalls, where,
unchanged from any of its predecessors
save in date, reposed “The Earliest
Christmas Number.”

CHARIVARIA.
WE are sorry to have to record a grave
set-back to Humour. President Roose-
VELT's order making Comic Spelling
compulsory has been revoked.
Lord TURNOUR, the eldest son of the
Earl of WINTERTON, upon arriving at
New York, announced that he was not
looking for an American heiress. At
this, we understand, the long queue of
heiresses outside his Lordship's hotel
slowly broke up and went quietly home.
Nearly every first-class Power is now
building a Dreadnought, and a corres-
pondent suggests that a Regatta should
be arranged confined to craft of this
class.
Much interest continues to be taken
in the impending House Match between
the Commons and the Lords.
A woman suffragist has christened her
baby boy “Franchise.” The news has
not been broken yet to the unfortunate
child. -
The pit and gallery doors at the
Court Theatre are to be opened one
hour before the performance, “in order,”
it is said, “to obviate the cold waits.”
A suburban correspondent writes to say
that he wishes some of the noisier waits
in his neighbourhood could be obviated
as easily.
Some burglars last week removed from
a house a safe weighing eleven hundred-
weight, using cushions and mats to
deaden the sound of their movements so
as not to disturb the inmates of the
house, who were all asleep. There are
plenty of persons always ready to sneer
at our criminal classes, but one might
journey far before coming across another
such example of kindly consideration for
others.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant
in a recent action felt hurt when a
County Court judge who had a difficulty
in pronouncing “th " described the
matter as being a case of “oaf against
oaf.”
Now that it has been proved that
flying machines are practicable, the
various omnibus companies are already
thinking of titles for their new lines.
We understand that among those which
have already been decided on are “The
Boomerang,” “The Castle in the Air,”
“The Rocket,” and “The Bird of Prey”
—the last-named being of course for a
line of Pirates.

THE WESTMINSTER PLAY.
STRIKING LETTERS OF PROTEST.
The Daily Mail having deprecated
the continuance of the Westminster
Plays on the ground that they do not
repay the exertion involved in their
preparation, and, for the rest, are not
particularly elevated in their morality,
a number of representative publicists
have written to Mr. Punch to express
their views on the subject. The selec-
tion from the correspondence printed
below abundantly proves what a fund
of good sense, sanity and good taste
supports the strictures of our patriotic
contemporary.
DEAR SIR,-As I have no sons at
Westminster, and never intend to send
any there, I am in a position to discuss this
uestion with perfect impartiality and
etachment. I have, therefore, no hesita-
tion in saying that the waste of time and
energy involved in this annual prepara-
tion of a Latin play is nothing short of
a national scandal, and I trust that some
patriotic Labour Member will call atten-
tion to it in the House of Commons
without delay. Anywhere else the sur-
vival of this obscurantist cult of the
classics might have been tolerated, but
in the heart of Westminster, almost
within a catapult-shot of Parliament, its
presence is a monstrous insult to the
representatives of Labour. If the West-
minster boys must act plays, let them
be in the vernacular or in Esperanto.
I am, Sir, faithfully yours,
MoDERN SIDE.
DEAR SIR,-When will the democracy
awake to the full sense of their respon-
sibilities? Year after year the West-
minster Play is made the excuse for a
scurrilous epilogue, in which, under the
cloak of an obscure and outlandish tongue,
disgraceful and libellous attacks are
made on the most cherished instruments
of modern progress and emancipation.
The London County Council, the Labour
'arty, Woman's Suffrage, Municipal
Trading-all these are subjected to
violently calumnious misrepresentation,
and yet no voices are raised in protest
against this worst form of lèse-majesté—
this belittling of the sovereign democracy.
I feel sure that The Daily News would
not, even if it could, sully its pages by
printing a translation of this atrocious
pasquinade, yet I have searched in vain
for any protest against the continuance
of what must be regarded as the worst
blot on our system of secondary educa-
tion. I am, Sir, yours indignantly,
Vox PopULI.
DEAR, SIR,-The drama is admittedly
one of the most humanising and refining
influences of modern society, but here,
as everywhere else, all depends on the
choice of plays. Count TolsToI has
finally and irrevocably demolished the
claim of SHAKSPEARE to be regarded,
either from the ethical or artistic stand-
point, as worthy of study or performance.
Greek and Latin are hopelessly dead;
English is dying rapidly; the only
language with a future before it in this
disunited kingdom is Irish. If Doctor
Gow, the Headmaster of Westminster,
bends to the inevitable and makes the
study of Irish compulsory amongst his
boys, a new lease of life may be secured
for the discredited institution over which
he so negligently presides.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,
PHAUDRIG Boſtol MHE.
DEAR SIR,--I understand that the
repertory of plays on which the West-
minster authorities draw is almost exclu-
sively confined to the works of an
obscure and obsolete poet named TERENCE,
obviously of Irish origin. Why, in the
name of common sense, should this
preferential treatment be accorded in the
capital of England to so undesirable an
alien? The anomaly becomes all the
more flagrant when it is borne in mind
that by far the greatest living Irish
playwright cannot obtain a hearing in
his native country, and is unable to speak
a single coherent sentence in Erse.
Unable for the moment to tell whether I
am standing on my head or on my heels,
I am, Sir, Yours faithfully
G. B. S.
DEAR SIR,--The fetish worship of me-
diaevalism at Westminster is sufficiently
degrading, but what can you expect of
a school which for centuries has allowed
its pupils to indulge annually in a
disgusting bear-fight over a pancake, a
comestible which derives its name
appropriately enough from the two Greek
words trav and kaków? I am, Sir,
Yours truthfully,
HUMANITARIAN.
DEAR, SIR,--While readily admitting
the truth of the old saw that “all work
and no play makes JACK a dull boy,” I
think that greater care should be shown
in the choice of the play than has hitherto
been the case at Westminster. It is all
very well to do in Rome as the Romans
do, but London is not Rome, and the
traditions of Drury Lane ought to be
more binding than those of the Eternal
City. This, of course, does not apply to
the choice of theme, but only to that of
the language in which the play is pre-
sented. Speaking as an impartial out-
sider I should say that, alike as regards
spectacular interest and moral influence,
such plays as The Bondman are far
better adapted for performance by im-
pressionable youths than the dubious
works of antiquated playwrights like
PLAUTUs and TERENCE, none of which,
so far as I am aware, can be obtained
-
with photographic illustrations at so low
a figure as 28. net.
I am, Sir, yours gratefully,
MAN.
HELLAS PRESERVED.
[A contemporary has observed that “when
Greece began to be living Greece once more,
the quantity of currants produced year by year
began to grow larger . . . . and their relative
cheapness to-day is a direct consequence of the
disappearance of the Turk.”]
GREECE, whose poets' pure affection
For the sterner syntax rules
Barely saves them from rejection
In our secondary schools—
Mourn not (though your sons can never
Warble with their fathers' ease)
While the fruits of their endeavour
Serve to spice our A. B. C.'s.
Though no more the Muses foster
Markets for Pierian song,
See the merry Grecian coster
Still contrives to get along;
Though no modern wits can weave you
Rôles of Sophoclean make,
Corinth of the double sea-view
Keeps her interest in cake.
Since upon your mountains Freedom
Reassumed her normal pose,
Swifter to the shores that need 'em
The Levantine currant flows;
Till, where tea-cups sound a paean,
Clerks absorb (their labours done)
Trophies of the soft AEgean,
Set like Cyclads in a bun.
On you go, light-hearted masters
Of a craft that always paid,
And, if unforeseen disasters
Do not cause a slump in trade,
Bards, whose simple meals are mottled
By your toothsome stuff, shall learn,
KEATS-like, to applaud the bottled
Beauties of a 8. Ulril.
Ancient songs are immaterial,
Art of little use to man;
Pies, we know, if less ethereal,
Often keep the mark of Pan ;
So the best of Greece we cherish
(Spirit of her hills and woods),
Though the pure ideals perish
In a lb. of grocers' goods.
That is why no sorrow stirs us
That the classic Muse despairs,
And you count the lyre and thyrsus
Unremunerative wares;
Who can grumble, “Hellas fuit !”
When perforce our cooks must seek
For the cult of Saxon suet
All the cunning of the Greek!

It looks as if the WILLIAMSONs (C. N. & A. M.) had been
motoring along the Corniche and during their progress con-
ceived the original idea of choosing Monte Carlo for the site
of one of their new creations–Rosemary in Search of a
Father (HopDER AND STOUGHTON). But the difficulty of getting
the child-heroine fixed in that neighbourhood—her mother
being a young English widow at once virtuous and penniless
– called for even greater ingenuity. This is how they solved
it. They sent the young widow to Paris to do type-writing,
and then her friends recommended her to go South where the
competition would be less strenuous. And so we find her
in a third-rate hotel in the Condamine at Monaco. Compared
with this brilliant stroke of phantasy the rest of the book is
commonplace. Rosemary is a sort of female “Little Lord
Fauntleroy,” who calls her mother “Angel” instead of
“Dearest,” and prattles tolerably. Their scheme must have
taken the authors at least an hour to elaborate, and the
result (with discount off) is perhaps not a very good bargain
at 2s. for the matter and 1s. 9d. for the margins.
The First Claim (METHUEN) has suggested to me a good
new game for Christmas parties. The first person who
opens the book without finding one or more words in italics
wins. I have played a considerable number of matches
against myself, and have never won yet. I suspect, though,
that the author, M. HAMILTON (Miss, I imagine) really wrote
the novel for quite another purpose. Her aim is to show
how ineffaceable is the maternal instinct, and she has cer-
tainly treated the theme excellently, with the help of some
very cleverly drawn characters. But the story is just a'
little bit long-drawn-out, and my game cheered the way
wonderfully.
Mr. Punch having always a warm corner in his heart for
the Young People, welcomes a book entirely devoted to their
interests. This, under the title The Young People, by One
of the Old Ones (MURRAY), lies before him, and he has
read it and re-read it with very great interest, delighted by
the gentle philosophy and urbane kindliness of the author.
Incidentally the book is also a Guide to London. No one who
feels fogeydom coming upon him should neglect the oppor-
tunity which this book gives him of recovering his youth-or
at any rate of preserving it in good spirits.

You'll have noticed have a “good-bye!”

WE understand that a slight change will take place in the
Government before the beginning of the next Parliamentary
Session. Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN will be promoted
to the responsible position of Under-Secretary for Colonial
Affairs, whilst Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL will be relegated to the
First Lordship of the Treasury. If the change should not
after all take place it will be because this premature announce-
ment will have upset the Cabinet's plans.
It is whispered that a curious intrigue is going on to
secure the support of the Labour Party during the coming
Session. Mr. KEIR HARDIE will take office as Vice-Chamberlain
of the Household, and the position of Mistress of the Robes
will be offered to Miss PANKhURST.
It is the talk of the political clubs that Sir ANToNY MAC-
DONNELL has ordered Mr. BRYCE to resign his office, and has
nominated Mr. BYLEs to succeed him. The rumour runs
that Sir ANTONY holds certain compromising anti-Home-Rule
letters written by Mr. BRYoF.
I hear on the best authority I can get that Mr. Lloyd-
GEORGE has not shown sufficient business capacity for a Presi-
dent of the Board of Trade, and that he will have to resign.
Also that he is to be mollified by an appointment as Special
Envoy to RAISULI. The Government will try to strengthen
their position by including some well-known business man in
the Cabinet. The name of Mr. A. E. W. MAsoN has been
mentioned in this connection.

crowded in anticipation of announcement
of decision of Opposition on Commons'

fate of his first-born.

finding their long labours thus treated
cavalierly, were the affronted party. Not
at all. It was the Lords who were
injured and insulted by having the
changeling thrown on their hands. But
of their magnanimity they would provide
the Commons with a locus poemitentia.
So LANSDowne proposed to move adjourn-
ment of debate in order to give the
Commons a chance of going “on the
knee.”
Business done.-Debate on Commons'
refusal to accept Lords' amendments to
Education Bill unexpectedly adjourned.
Tuesday.-Again a crowded House.
Through the dull day there have been
coming and going of heralds of the two
Houses; consultations of leaders on both
sides, merging in conference between re-
presentatives of the Lords and Commons.
Surely all is settled now ; the long-
drawn-out agony of suspense is cut short.
For an hour before public business
commenced, Lobbies thronged with Com-
moners and Peers discussing situation.
Bishops, “with warm hearts beating
beneath their gaiters,” as the Vicar of
Gorleston said on another occasion, flit
across the Lobby asking for news. No
RUNNING Shont of Expletives.
- A fancy portrait of some members of a Service Club who have just heard that Mº Haldane

Commons, assuming, may asserting, that “I ginning of the end, Sir! Most disgraceful, Sir! Br-br-br, &c. . . "

one has any of authentic character.
Conjecture is rife, rumour running
steadily in direction of the happening
of a hitch.
This confirmed when Orders of day
were reached in the Lords. Motion
made for further adjournment. “Till
when?” asked a noble Lord. Who could
say? Probably till to-morrow;
to a later hour of the sitting. Nothing
to be done at the moment but take up
the next business on Agenda and wait
patiently on the Lords and Commons
still in secret chambers trying to
wrangle out Compromise.
Business done.—Hitch in arrangement
of Compromise on Education Bill.
To be continued in our next.).
AEROPLANE 8AILING DIRECTIONS.
1. AERONAUTs are requested not to
heave the lead, jettison cargo, passengers
or empty bottles whilst sailing over the
Strand in the daytime. A triangular
iece of land known as the Strand
ſº and marked on the chart
due south of Kingsway is quite large

enough to be hit from almost any altitude,
and has been kept vacant for this
purpose for several years past.
2. The Dome of St. Paul's is the
private landing-stage of the Dean and
Chapter, and the vergers have strict
orders to cast off all hawsers made fast
thereto by unauthorised persons. Small
craft may be moored to the tree-tops
along the Embankment, but the County
Council cannot guarantee that the trees
will be fit for this or any other purpose.
The use of the Nelson Column as a
mooring - post is restricted to the
Admiralty.
3. Air-ships should not make rapid and
sudden descents upon the top of the
Victoria and Albert Museum. This
regulation is framed in the interest of
the aeronaut himself.
4. Every effort will be made by the
Fire Brigade to rescue by means of a
rocket apparatus the crews of airships
bond fide stranded upon overhead wires,
steeples, sky signs, or other perils
of navigation, but the aero-world is
respectfully invited not to regard this
as a normal method of coming ashore.
Guests arriving for dinner.
wº
s
ºs
Great caution is to be observed in
passing over storm-centres like the
Hippodrome, especially in the afternoon
or evening, when they are for a space in
violent eruption. Such places will as
soon as possible be buoyed with captive
balloons, illuminated at night, the
managements having made no objection
to their being so distinguished.
5. Public statues are not to be looked
upon merely as convenient anchorages.
There are certain exceptions to this rule
(a list of which will be furnished on
application) where, on condition that
the statue is hauled up bodily with the
anchor and transported sufficiently far
away, no penalty attaches to the dis-
placement of it.
6. Airships navigating crowded tho-
roughfares within twenty feet of the
ground are required to display suitable
boards inscribed (in the tongue of
M. SANTos-DUMONT) “Ne pas déranger
les helices.” It is expected that #.
rule and the reason for it will tend to
familiarise the public with the French
(and the more obscure departments of
the English) language.

R. PUNCH approached the door of the tent.
“The Captain of the Commons, I presume?" he said, as he raised his hat.
“Well,” said the Captain, “what's your business?”
“Observe the white flag,” said Mr. PUNCH, taking out his handkerchief. “This is, in fact, purely a friendly visit.
I am come to interview you on behalf of my readers.” Here he referred for a moment to his note-book. “What,” he
continued, “are your views with regard to the coming contest?”
“Ah, my dear Sir,” said the Captain, “I did not recognise you for the moment. Pray sit down. Very cold the
weather is. Yes. The contest? Ah, yes. Well, roughly speaking, the struggle will be one of Birth v. Brains. I need
hardly say that Brains will win in the end.”
“‘Brains,’” said MR. PUNCH, writing rapidly in his note-book. “That's you, I suppose?”
“Of course. At present we are not quite sure what nickname we shall adopt for the contest, but probably it will be
‘The Brainy Ones.' I myself,” he added proudly, “am known as ‘The People's Will.’”
“The People's Will,” wrote MR. PUNCH. “And are you adopting the 2–3–2 formation or the 3–2–3?”
“Neither. The ‘all-talking-at-once formation' has always been ours.”
“I see. Now I think my readers would like from you a few words on the moral aspect of the struggle.”
“Well, it's like this. I am ‘The People's Will, and the Lords have defied me. And they attacked and brutally
ill-treated “Education' Bill, one of our strongest and most popular Forwards. And to make matters worse they have just
shown that they are too cowardly to tackle ‘Trade Disputes' Bill.”
“But you can't have it both ways,” argued MR. PUNCH. “You can't make it first a cause of offence that they mangled
one Bill, and then a cause of offence that they didn't mangle another. If ->
“Excuse me,” said the Captain coldly, “but didn't you say you came here to interview me?”
“Yes, but——"
“Then why are you doing all the talking? As I was saying—who are the Lords that they should oppose ‘The
People's Will'? They are representative of nothing but their own incompetence.”
“Representative of nothing but their own incompetence,” wrote MR. PUNCH. “Is that really your own It sounds
more like ‘The People's David.’ And when will the contest begin 2" he went on hastily.
“Well, I can't say exactly. The position is this. We have defied them to do their worst, and they are doing it.
But we still defy them. So now it is their move again.”
“I see. I suppose it is useless to suggest arbitration?”
“Quite . . . . Oh, must you be going? Well, tell your readers that my final message is, ‘May the best boat win ''
Which is us,” he added, after a pause.

466 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [DECEMBER 26, 1906,
MR. PUNCH found his way out of the camp; and went up the hill and down again the other side into the enemy's
Camp.
P. . The Captain of the Lords, I presume?” he said, as he raised his hat.
“Hallo,” said the Captain. “What is it?” - - - -
“Observe, the white flag,” said MR PUNCH. “This is a friendly visit. , I am come to interview you on behalf of my
readers. What,”—he had it off by heart this time—“what are your views with regard to the coming contest?
Roughly,” said the Captain, “that it's been a jolly long time coming.”
“But when it does come?” - - 7
“Then it will be one of Gas v. Brains. I need hardly say that Brains will win in the end."
“' Brains,’” said MR. PUNCH, writing rapidly in his note-book. “That's you, I suppose? 71.
“Of course. We are known as ‘The Brainy Ones,' you know. At least you might tell your readers so.
“Certainly. And what formation are you adopting?”
“The sit-tight-formation has always been ours. It has carried every scrum so far.” ->
“Ah yes. Now I think my readers would like from you a few words on the moral aspect of the struggle. *
“‘Moral’?” said the Captain. “I don't know about moral, but the common sense of it is this. The People don't
know what's good for them.”
“And you?” - -
“That's what we're here for. All this rot about interpreting the People's Will—is all—well, rot. That's not
where we come in. The Commons do that. At least they think they do. We are here to protect the People against
themselves. Like a father with his children. That sort of idea.” - • -
“Yes, that's all very well,” said MR. PUNCH; “but how is it that it's always one particular party you're protecting
against itself, and never the other?” - - 22
. Fº me,” said the Captain coldly, “but didn't you say you came here to interview me?
‘Yes, but——”
Then why are you doing all the talking?”
MR. PUNCH apologised.
... But give me,” he said, “a final message to take to my readers.”
... Well,” said the Captain, “all I can say is, ‘May the best boat win ''”
“Which is you?” suggested the SAGE. vºr -

When MR. PUNCH was on neutral ground again he took out his note-book, and read it carefully. -
Arbitration no good,” he repeated to himself. “I wonder.”, Suddenly a brilliant idea occurred to him. He
snapped his pocket-book, replaced it, and began once more to climb the hill. At the top, in full view of both camps, he
ostentatiously opened, for purposes of common consultation, his

THE MISTLETOE BOUGH.
A STORY WITHOUT A PLOT.
SCENE–The Library of a Country House.
In front of the fire there is a
Chesterfield; and in one corner of
the room a writing-desk, with an
“Encyclopædia Britannica " within
reach. The rest of the furniture
calls for no comment.
TIME--11.30 of a Christmas Eve.
HE enters, carrying a large bunch of
mistletoe.
He (standing dejectedly in the middle of
the room). Nobody loves me. Nobody loves
me a little bit. Istood under the mistletoe
for half an hour in the hall–Benson's
chronometer. Very cold in the hall
when nobody loves you. Much warmer
in here. (Looks thoughtfully at his
mistletoe.) Now where shall I put it?
(Catches sight of cigarette-boat on desk.
Goes over and lights a cigarette; them drops
into chair, putting mistletoe on the desk
in front of him.) . . . . This is really
a very beastly place. I don't
know anybody . . . unless
you count Miss Carew, and
she won't look at me. Yet
that girl—only last year. . . . .
(He smiles to himself . . .
and then goes on gently)
Yes! She called me Jack
last year ! . . . (Sighs.) My
name's Freddy, though . . .
And I called her May. She
let me call her May. Won-
derful! . . . I found out
afterwards her name was
Muriel. That really makes it
more wonderful that she let
me call her May . . . . (He gazes at the
Encyclopaedia for a long time, and then
suddenly begins to turn it round.) M-
M–M–here we are. (Takes out a
volume.) What do they say about
mistletoe? These great men unbend
sometimes . . . perhaps we shall find
something chatty on the best place to
hang it. Mistletoe — Viscum album--
dichotomous — h’m — obovate – yes,
of course, one knew that – arboretum.
No. No help. Everything is going
wrong to-night. Well (getting up). I
shall leave nothing to chance. I shall
hang it over the sofa, and I shall go
to sleep in the sofa, and I shall back
myself both ways. (He proceeds to hang
it on the electric light over the sofa, and
while doing so yawns violently.) Oh,
Lord, I really shall go to sleep, and then
I shan’t know what luck I’ve had. (Gets
down and goes to writing-desk. Takes
a ruler and a sheet of paper and begins
to rule columns.) Let's see. I suppose
I shan't get more than six. (Writing.)
“Kindly—fill—in and—initial—in the
—order-—in which—you-come.” Now
then. “One -- State nature of glove

two cushions, and goes to sleep.
enters, and looks round the room.
She sees him in the sofa, goes up to
him, and then catches sight of the
paper. Goes on her knees to read
it. She frowns at first, and then
begins to laugh softly to herself.
She umpins the paper and takes it to
the desk, where she fills in the first
column. She laughs to herself all
the time she writes. When it is
finished she pins it on again. Then
she leans orer the back of the sofa,
and looks at HIM. Finally she
kisses two of her fingers and puts
them on his lips. She hurries out,
stopping a moment to knock the

He wakes up at the noise.
He (rubbing his eyes). I'm sure I heard
something. (Yawms, stretches, and so
sees the mistletoe above him.) By Jove'

off the paper and looks at it.) Lord
A bite! A bite! (Reading.) “Nature

Right you are. “Size—Nines.” . . .
Nines . . . (Rubs his head.) Nines . . .
Is that much or little? (Looking at his
own hand.) What do I take? . .
Nines . . . Twice round the wrist is
once round the neck. Twice round the
neck . . . No, that doesn't help. . . .
Nines, well, I suppose it's all right.
“Number of buttons—Thirty-two.” . . .
Thirty-two. . . . Yes. Nines. Thirty-
two. Nines into thirty-two—nine threes
are twenty-seven. . . . Thirty-two. . . .
(Counting on his arm.) One, two, three,

I haven't got to wear them. “Remarks

He. Because everybody else is dancing

me.” And look here, why have you

THE HIDING DEVIL.
I’ve occupied with heart undaunted
A farm by witchcraft overlooked,
I’ve leased a house reputed “haunted,”
And lived in lodgings badly
“spooked.”
I’ve known my Alderneys and bantams
In May bewitched of milk and eggs.
I’ve seen and walked and talked with
phantoms
If I have eyes and ears and legs.
With not one tremor of my features
I have deliberately stepped
O'er door-mats dim where couchant
creatures
Their horrid, headless vigil kept:
And watched a bookcase, stout and
stable,
Unmoor itself and mount the stair,
And smiled to see from off the table
My dinner service take the air.
Yet is there one strange, diabolic
Confuser of my home concerns,
Who makes me mad and melancholic,
Savage and cynical by turns.
And if you'll draw a little nearer,
I'll whisper you his evil fame,
Since you're a sympathetic hearer—
“The Hiding Devil is his name.”
I cannot claim a bump of order,
The kind that's known as apple-pie,
I'm not an accurate recorder
Of pin and button, hook and eye;
For these let others crawl their druggets,
With craning necks and straining eyes,
As if in quest of glittering nuggets.
| Such thrifty habits I despise.
Yet both myself and dearest Fanny
Are neat and natty as you please;
You'll therefore own as quite uncanny
Such household accidents as these:—
We two were going out to dinner,
And maybe just a trifle pressed
To catch the 7.15 to Pinner,
Yet practically almost dressed—
I standing in my shirt-front speckless,
She pinning on her moss-rose buds—
When Fanny missed her diamond neck-
lace,
And I my only decent studs.
“My opals, dear, are simply nowhere.
Have you a notion where they are 2 ”
To which she only answered, “O where,
Augustus, is my diamond star?”
“I saw it, love, among your sables,
Beside your photo of the Prince,
On one or other of these tables,
It can't be half a moment since.”
Then high and low we started hunting
As swift the precious moments flew ;
On handsand knees Igrovelled, grunting,
With tears she searched her treasures
through.
The time was short, the time grew shorter,
We puffed, we panted, we perspired ;
Our clock cuckoo'd the hour, the quarter;
Excuses to our friends we wired.
Then diving down into the larder
We snatched a lightning snack of food,
And once again with desperate ardour
Our agonizing quest pursued.
The carpet tack by tack we lifted,
And underneath it peered and pried,
The curtains shook, the cinders sifted;
The studs and star our search defied.
And hour by hour we prosecuted
That quest, yet hour by hour in vain,
Till twelve o'clock our cuckoo fluted,
And to renounce it we were fain.
Till, as the candle in its socket
Expired—while folding up our duds,
I found her necklace in my pocket,
She in her flounces found my studs.
A score or more of such like cases
I could have easily adduced,
Where well-known things from well-
known places
Have 'neath my very nose vamoosed.
Of these example on example
I might promiscuously pile,
But let us close with just one sample
In our own demon's smartest style.
The Hiding Devil gets an inkling
Some non-teetotal guests are near.
Well! Up they drive and in a twinkling
Your cellar key will disappear.
For wine you seek the nearest grocer,
Though bad 's the best of all his store.
Your guests are gone. On looking closer,
The key is in the cellar door.
Who took it? Why, the Hiding Devil.
Who put it back? The fiend, of course,
Who positively seems to revel
In every kind of slim resource.
No wonder then this diabolic
Confuser of all home concerns
Can make me mad and melancholic,
Savage and cynical by turns.

customer, testily.
One of the most
disconcerting inci-
dents that can hap-
pen to a lecturer
occurred the other
day. When the
learned gentleman
who was reading
the paper was well
under way, a man
at the back of the
hall complained
that he could not
hear, whereupon
quite a number of
members of the
audience jumped
up, and offered to
change seats with
him.
“Last year,” ac-
cording to the Post-
master-General,
“2,700,000,000 let-
ters were circulated
by the Post Office
in this country,
which represents
62 letters for every
man, woman, child,
and baby in the
country.” Num-
bers of foolish peo-
ple are writing to
say that they did
not receive any-
thing like the
number of letters
mentioned, and
complain bitterly of
the carelessness of
the Post Office.
Our language
would seem to pre-
sent in superable
difficulties to the
foreigner with the
best intentions. A
German gentleman
who, on being told
by an English lady friend that she was
not feeling very well, remarked, “Yes,
you are ill-looking,” is still at a loss to
understand the coolness that ensued.
The hapless foreigner did not mend
matters by expressing the hope that the
invalid would soon be up-set again.

The fact that
Ruffs are coming
into fashion again
leads an illiterate
contemporary to
make the remark-
able statement that
a really pretty
woman never looks
so well as with an
Elizabethan Rough

It is said that, as
a nation, we are
becoming flabby.
Some colour is lent
to this statement by
a notice in a shop
window:—“Corsets

a sixpenny cup of
coffee at a restau-

receiving the expected change, he asked
for it.
“I beg your pardon, I thought
that was for me,” said the waiter.
The Sunset Gun had just been fired.
“Why, what was that?” asked an old

“Well,” said the old lady,

TO CHRISTINE.
(A Quinquennial Address from her Uncle.)
My dear, when you were half your age,
(2's into 10?) a good while back,
I wrote about you on a page
Of Mr. Punch's Almanack.
How you are gaining on me quick!
Your years were then of mine,
But Time, who does arithmetic,
Has made the ratio 2 to 9 |
And now that o'er your shining head
This second lustre (if you know
What lustres are) has been and fled
Into the Land of Longago–
And since you somehow failed to get
Those earlier verses off by heart,
I'll make you up another set.
So that's the Preface. Here we start |
Dear, as I see you nice and small,
Agile of leg and sound of lung,
And rather wistfully recall
What it was like to feel so young,
When grown-ups seemed, in taste and
S1ze,
Removed from me immensely far—
I often ask with vague surmise
How old you think we really are.
Sometimes I fancy you behave
As if you found us past repair–
One foot already in the grave,
The other very nearly there !
Then you are wrong, and you must try
To take a more enlightened view;
You're not so much more young than I,
Nor I so much more old than you.
For, though you have the supple joints
That go so well with childhood's mirth,
In certain elemental points
You are the age of Mother Earth.
And while it's true I’ve ceased to hop
Out of my bed at peep of dawn,
Have lost the weasel's power to pop,
Nor can outrun the light-foot fawn,
Yet otherwise I'm far from old;
The words I use, so long and queer,
My manner, stern, abrupt and cold—
All this is just pretence, my dear.
As when you act your nursery plays,
And ape your elders' talk and looks,
So I have copied grown-up ways
Either from life or else from books.
But in my heart, its hopes and fears,
Its need of love, its faith in men,
I yet may be, for all my years,
As young as little girls of ten. O. S

BODGER AND THE EDITOR.
BoDGER is, in my opinion, a man of
really strong intellect, but he says that
|he will never shine socially because of
the difficulty he encounters in getting
out of a room in an adroit and easy
manner.
| The following incident is a trivial
one, but I narrate it because I should
like to know if anyone can think of
anything that Bodger could have said.
He himself always maintains that there
is a proper mot for every leave-taking,
only he can so seldom find it.
It was like this: he had taken a
manuscript poem round to the office of
a monthly magazine, and was shown
into a room where a weary-looking man
was sitting at a table in his shirt-sleeves,
counting some postage stamps – the
Editor, it appeared.
Bodger put on, he tells me, the rather
menacing air he always adopts with
editors, and said, in a firm and loud
tone of voice, “Good afternoon; I have
brought you a little poem.”
The Editor hurriedly concealed his
stamps, leaned back with a gentle sigh,
and stared blankly at Bodger. There
was an interval of dreadful silence, and
then he said, “Read it out to me.”
So Bodger sat down and read it. I
don't remember the words quite accu-
rately, but it was a neat little thing, all
about autumn:--
“O ! autumn leaves, why will ye fall?
O! autumn winds, why do you squall?
Why do the something somethings bring
Pale, ghostly somethings of the spring?”
I know it went somehow like that.
Well, when Bodger had finished read-
ing it he looked at the Editor, and the
Editor looked at him in an abstracted
sort of way, until Bodger thought he
was in a trance.
However, he roused himself presently,
and began to paint patterns on the table
with a paste-brush.
“It's not very good,” he said.
Bodger quietly put the manuscript
down on the table, and there was another
aching silence.
“Well, what are we to do about it?”
said the Editor at last, in a puzzled
sort of way.
“Print it and pay for it,” replied
Bodger playfully.
The Editor thought a moment; then
he opened a drawer in his table and
took out a stick of sealing-wax, a cham-
pagne cork, a tobacco pouch, and finally
a five-shilling piece. Judge of Bodger's
astonished delight when this goodly
coin was tendered to him.
The rate of payment was not high, to
be sure; but then, as he said, the general
rule with monthly magazines is to pay
their contributors the year after next.
And for once he got off the right
sort of remark at parting. With a little

bow he said, “Bis dat qui cito dat,” and
ran down the stairs and out into the
Strand, in such a glow of pleasurable
elation that he felt he must give himself
a little treat. So he went into a place
where they sell alleged champagne on
draught, and ordered a glass.
He must have been feeling really
skittish, for he threw down his crown-
piece and said, “There goes the last of
the family plate '''-knowing, of course,
that new jokes are bad form in a high-
class bar.
While he drank his wine the barmaid
walked away towards one of those opu-
lent machines, the kind that looks like
a typewriter and isn't one, but stopped
halfway, and then returned to him; and
he says she seemed quite stuffy as she
offered him his crown-piece again.
“What's that for 2" he asked rather
blankly.
“It's a bad one,” says she, looking
a hundred miles beyond him; and she
waited, leaning against the counter.
There was a stern, massive specimen
of manhood meditating in the back-
ground by the patent till ; so Bodger
did not argue, but paid his reckoning
with some coppers he had reserved for
two evening papers and his bus fare
home—all he possessed at the moment,
for he had been disappointed in the
City earlier in the day.
Then he returned to the magazine
office. The office boy had presumably
been sent out to fetch tea, for Bodger
was able to reach the Editor's room with-
out interference.
Again the Editor looked hard at him,
and then folded his arms and leaned
back in his chair.
“About that five-shilling piece,” began
Bodger.
“Well?” says the Editor in a tired voice.
“I’m afraid –er—there's something
the matter with it,” says Bodger.
“Well?” says the Editor again.
“It’s a bad one,” explained Bodger.
The Editor raised his eyebrows a
fraction of a millimetre, and looked at
Bodger harder than ever.
“Well ? . . . . . It's a bad poem,”
says he. +
That's all. Bodger stood gaping at
the Editor for a long, long while, think-
ing deeply, but somehow he couldn't
think of the right thing to say. So he
jammed his hat fiercely on his head and

went out, as he tells me, heavily and
awkwardly, looking like a born ass. He
still feels that there was a retort that
would have enabled him to march out

all, what could he have said 2 -

Punch's Almanack for 1907.
A NEW STAGE ACADE MY.
A VERY interesting dramatic school has
just been opened in the neighbourhood
of Chalk Farm, where domestic and other
animals of value in theatrical representa-
tions may receive the instruction that
some of the less intelligent or more self-
centred—hogs, moles, badgers, Aberdeen
terriers, &c.—rather too obviously lack.
For whereas everyone has agreed, not
only professional critics like Mr. Archer
and Mr. Walkley, but also such semi-
professional intruders as Mr. W. T.
Stead (warm from inspection of La Milo)
and Mr. Bourchier, that the Drury Lane
autumn drama, The Bondman (by a
dramatist whose name for the moment
we cannot recall) would have been
nothing but for the artistic restraint of
its real cow (with real milk), yet the best
intellects are also unanimous in holding
that the recent failure of The Girl from
Jamrach's at the Satiety
Theatre was due quite
as much to the ill-con-
sidered antics of the
jerboa as to any weak-
ness either in the music,
dialogue, or lyrics of the
thirteen collaborators.
The actor - manager
being notoriously ready
to learn wherever in-
struction may be picked
up, either from the man
in the street, The Daily
Mail, or bitter experi-
ence, a meeting of these
gentlemen was recently
held at the Zoo, by the
courtesy of Dr. Chalmers
Mitchell, in a disused
annexe of the Small Cats
house, where it was de-
cided that at the earliest possible moment
a dramatic school for animals should be
established, similar in aim to Mr. Tree's
famous academy in Gower Street. With
the leading lights of the theatrical profes-
sion to think is to act (even if the converse
is only too seldom the case), and the
school was almost instantly founded,
and Herr Julius Treeth engaged as chief
instructor, with an able staff of assistants.
The training of animals for the stage
is of course no new thing; but in two
respects Herr Julius Treeth claims to
be an innovator: in the diversified
range of creatures that he is prepared
to instruct, and in the attention paid
at Chalk Farm to what may be called
the ensemble. In the old days—even in
The Bondman, the sulphurous drama at
Drury Lane--(by the author the loss of
whose name so bothers us)—when we
had an animal on the stage it was alone,
unless, of course, as in a previous dra-
matic triumph by the same hand, it was
a flock of sheep ; but Herr Treeth has
set himself the task of mixing his animals
in crowds. In order to do this success-
fully he trains them together—the lion
learns his part with the lamb. No one
who has had the privilege, which re-
cently fell to us, of attending a lesson
at the Chalk Farm academy, can fail to
be impressed by the intelligent interest
with which the progress of a human
dialogue can be followed by these dumb
yet intensely apprehensive creatures.
During the hero's declaration of passion
to the heroine we noticed an expression
of envy on the donkey's countenance
which it would puzzle our most gifted
histrion to reproduce.
Herr Treeth is prepared to supply
fauna suitable for any play in any
tongue -- carefully-instructed bears to
lend local colour and a sense of illusion to
Gorki's playful playlets; dachshunds for
Hauptmann'sand Sudermann's whimsical
trifles; poodles for adaptations from the
French ; polar bears for arctic scenes at
So much for cows. Horses too are in
request, and are easier to obtain than
cows, the horse being just now largely
superseded by the motor-car. Plays with
a strong equine element can always find
a market. Horses however are not so
amenable to instruction as cows. The
great difficulty with them in theatres,
Herr Julius Treeth informs us, is to keep
them out of the auditorium, many of them
at once making a leap over the footlights,
to the embarrassment of the orchestra
and the consternation of the stalls. As
anything likely to prejudice an audience
against a theatre is unpopular with mana-
gers, Herr Julius Treeth has been obliged
to arrange for a barbed-wire fence to be
stretched from one side of the proscenium
to the other. Few horses have been
known to leap this, but, where they have,
the composer's intentions have almost
invariably suffered.
A MARTYR TO GOUT.
ONCE, with a constitution
scorning
The signs that lead
direct to gout,
I laughed to hear the
solemn warning,
Be sure your bins will
find you out !
But now I know those
“beaded bubbles”
Were “winking” with
their other eye,
And all too late perceive
the troubles
Bred in the Beaune I
loved to buy.
Drury Lane; llamas for Thibetan traves-
ties; okapis for extravaganzas from the
Soudanese ; and even giant sloths
(specially trained by Professor Ray Lan-
kester) for Patagonian problem plays.
Fashions of course will change, but
for the moment, inspired no doubt by
the success of The Bondman (odd how
the author's name eludes us!), plays
with a strong vaccine interest are un-
doubtedly, as the saying is, in the air.
The demand for cows is prodigious,
but the school has no doubt that it will
be able to cope with it. Plays with
cows in them are in active rehearsal at
no fewer than five West-End theatres,
while Mr. Alexander, ever enterprising,
has taken the bull by the horns in
earnest and made this friendly and
serviceable animal actually the heroine
of his new comedy, which bears the
promising title His Dairy in Disorder.
We hear further of an abbreviated
burlesque of this effort which a come-
º is to produce under the name of
The Condensed Milkman.
Get hence, old Port, so
rich and fruity
Thou bringest naught
but grief and pain;
And thou, my Sherry, et tu, Brute, –
Must never kiss my lips again;
O false Champagnes, could only ye know
The actual ills that haunt me now,
You'd surely mourn with Maraschino
The purple flush upon my brow.
The glories of the kitchen dwindle,
Nor yield the joys that once I felt;
My saddened eyes forget to kindle
When sirloins make their presence
smelt ;
Time was when it was wondrous pleasant
To taste the birds and drain the cup,
Now, long before I see the pheasant,
I realise the game is up !
Cut off from my superb Madeira
My spirits, once so ardent, quail
Before the prospect of an era
Of lemon-squash and ginger-ale;
Pinched are my cheeks once round and
ruddy,
And this is now my chiefest care,
|To scan my knuckle-bones and study
The sermons in the chalkstones there!
