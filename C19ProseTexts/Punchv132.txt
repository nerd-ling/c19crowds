THE RACK-HANGER.
PUBLIC sympathy has been lavished
on the strap-hanger, but how about the
rack-hanger, whose grievance is of much
longer standing? I am a rack-banger,
and I demand sympathy. I travel on
the Great Eastern suburban in the
old compartment carriages, where such
luxuries as straps are unknown. As I
hang to the rack I envy the pampered
people who revel in straps.
Our compartments are built with
room for five a side and five down the
middle. They are labelled “Six seats a
side,” and such is the influence of the
printed word that six people wedge
themselves on each side and imagine
they are sitting. (I am speaking of the
second-class compartments. I do not
travel first, because my ticket is not a
third-class ticket.)
Down the middle, on occasions, stand
seven or eight, sometimes nine people.
When there are only seven, the door
shuts easily, when there are eight it shuts
with difficulty. When there are nine it
has to be rammed-to by a porter. Even
on ordinary days the train is often full
when it reaches my station, and it is no
good the porters shouting“ Take your
seats, please,” for somebody else has
already taken the seat for which we
have both paid, or partially paid.
I take my share of the rack instead.
The woodwork is not always clean.
But that is a minor inconvenience. I
would give much for a strap, clean or
dirty. Had I such I would close my
eyes and imagine myself in Paradise.
The strap gives a good hold and is
suspended at the right height. The
rack is admirable for the parcels which
are seldom put on it, but it is not made
for hanging to, and your arm becomes
numbed to the shoulder. If you lower
it to restore circulation the train bumps
over the points and you sit down on
the lap of some one to whom you have
never been introduced.
If he is good - tempered, he says

AVA
OLD FRIENDS WITH NEW YEAR FACES.
(How certain of the classics appeared to a very
youthful playgoer.)
I.-ALADDIN.
ONCE upon a time, in the Market Place
at Pekin, there lived a poor widow
named TWANKEY, with one little boy
called ALADDIN. Though ALADDIN'S
mother was so poor she was very cheerful,
and kept on saying funny things that
made people laugh. Also she was able
to give him some nice suits, but perhaps
she saved on the knickerbockers.
One day the Princess of that country
was coming by with a procession, and
when she saw ALADDIN she stopped the
procession and fell in love with him.
But the Grand Vizier was very angry,
and told him he would be put in prison,
at which ALADDIN's mother wanted to go
too, so that women might have votes.
However, they didn't go, because a
magician took ALADDIN to the mouth of
a cave, which he had to enter all alone.
But when he got inside, instead of being
alone he found crowds of lady-like
young gentlemen in glittering clothes
who walked about to music. And his
mother came in as well and said, “Excuso
me, but is this the Poplar Union ?"
Then they brought the treasures to the
palace of the Empress, the Princess's
mother, who used to live in the Com-
mercial Road, London, and let lodgings.
And when she saw them she was over-
joyed, and allowed ALADDIN to marry the
Princess, and ALADDIN's mother married
the magician, and at the wedding every-
body sang songs, and some very large
fairies flew about in the air, and every-
thing was all over coloured lights.
II.-CINDERELLA.

Mr. Wankle. “I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY ARE. Tue Master TOLD ME TO ’AVE EVERY 'OLE ABOUT THE PLACE STOPPED UP.”
TO A BRUSSELS SPROUT.
FAREWELL, my spherical Belgian friend;
Since everything here must have its end,
Since the world's a shadow, and dark at that,
And is certainly stale and, I doubt not, flat;
And, since I am tired of eating you,
We'll part: it's the one thing left to do.
With a right good will and endurance stout
You ’ve stuck to it well, my Brussels Sprout.
Oh, every day for a month and more
You 've wandered in at the kitchen door,
And observed to the cook, " They pine for mo; .
So dish me up for the family.”
The monotonous cook, whom you spoke so fair,
She took you and beiled you and dislied you there;
And the butler bore you elate along,
And then he went and he beat the gong;
And the family said, when they saw you plain,
“Good heavens, it's Brussels Sprouts again!”
Each day in your pride, my Brussels Sprout,
You imagined you couldn't be done without;
And when the family sat and fed,
You gave yourself airs and you ruled the spread ;
But when he offered you green and hot,
“No, thanks” was all that the butler got.
Farewell! henceforth you may stay and bear
As well as you can the winter air.
You may stay and stick to your lanky stalk
In the bed that borders the garden walk,
Or else you may go and be boileil, d'you sse ?
As long as it's not for mine or m2.

Then suddenly I stopped and cried, “By Jove!
By Jove!” I cried, “I wish it were the Spring!":
So there you have it. Now it's off my chest.
Just for one moment you upset me slightly,
Disturbed my usual calm serenity
Got in my head, and set me vainly wishing
For April, and the country, and one other .....
But that is over. I am whole again.
Good bye! I shall not send this letter now.
I find I have forgotten you already.
THE SECOND EXTRA.
DEAR AMARYLLIS,-(may I call you that ?
Seeing I do not know your proper name ;
And, if I did, it might be something dull —
Like JANE). I offer you my broken heart,
Knowing that if you do not want the thing
You will not hesitate to mention it:
Dear AMARYLLIS, will you please be mine?
We met, 'twas at a dance, ten days ago;
And after sundry smiles and bows from me,
And other rather weary smiles from you,
And certain necessary calculations,
We hit at last upon the Second Extra,
And made an assignation for the same.
“I shall be at this corner here," you said :
And I “Right 0," or words to that effect.
But when the dance came round we both were tired,
So sat it out instead beneath a palm
(Which probably was just as well for you,
And, since I love you, just as well for me).
We talked, but what about I can't remember--
Save this: that you were rather keen on goll;
That I had never been to Switzerland;
And both of us thought well of BERNARD Sulaw.
We talked ; but all the time I looked at you,
And wondered much what inspiration led
Your nose to tilt at just that perfect angle;
And wondered how on earth you did your hair ;
And why your eyes were blue, when it was black;
And why-a hundred other different things.
Until at last, another dance beginning,
You left me lonely ; whereupon I went
Back to the supper room, and filled a glass,
And drank, and lit a cigarette, and sighed,
And asked the waiter Had he been in love ?
And told the waiter, Yes, I am in love;
And gave him twopence, and went home to bed.
Am I in love? Well no, I hardly think so.
For one, I'm much too happy as I am ;
For two, I shall forget you by to-morrow;
For three, I do not care about your friends,
The men you danced with-bounders, all of them.
For four and five and six and all the rest,
I'm fairly sure we shall not meet again.
Not that I mind. No, as I said before,
I'm very much too happy as I am.
Besides, I shall forget you by to-morrow.
Then why this letter? Well, two incidents
Have led me to it. Here you have them both.
First, then, that sitting in my rooms last week,
Sitting and smoking, thinking --not of you,
Not altogether, but of many things,
Politics, football, dinner and tobacco-
Quite suddenly this thought occurred to me:
“By Jove, I wish I had a little dog,
A terrier, an Irish terrier.
I wonder if the landlord would object.”
And, thinking thus, I rose and sighed, and bent
To take my boots off. Had a mouse appeared,
I could have loved it in my loneliness.
Had but the humblest cockroach shown his head,
I think I would have said “Good-night” to it.
This too (I give it you for what it's worth):
Next morning, passing through St. James's Park,
A morning for the gods, all blue and white,
I heard what, strictly, should have been a skylark,
(But probably was quite a common bird)
NATURE STUDIES.
THE EXHUMED SLIPPER.
The hero of this very slight story is a dog, whose virtues
I propose to commemorate for the admiration of those who,
walking on two feet, are not too proud to profit by the
example of the four-footed tail-waggers, their servants and
friends. The slipper, as you will see, is a mere incident, an
incident more permanent, I regret to say, than the hero, but
not on that account to be unduly exalted.
The name of this dog was Ray, and he was a Labrador
retriever of the true breed, bulky in body and something
short in the legs. His coat was of a pure black, its short
hairs being so closely and smoothly laid together that it
glistened in the sun. His hide was very loosely adjusted to
his back. You could lift it, so to speak, in great handfuls
without causing him the least inconvenience. His tail was
an implement of great strength and thickness, nobly adapted
to perform the functions of a rudder when, as often happened,
|he plunged into the water to exercise the oarage of his paws.
His head was even smoother than his back, and it was
adorned by two brown eyes through which love and loyalty
shone eloquently upon his friends. When he sat down in
his favourite attitude with his head lifted and a little thrown
back, the shortness of those sturdy forelegs of his gave him
the appearance of a seal. Indeed, I am now sure that if we
were able to trace back their genealogies we should find that
seals and Labrador dogs possessed a common ancestor in an
age indefinitely remote. I saw a seal the other day in a
Midland town, of all places in the world, and when, sitting
awkwardly on the lid of its wooden tank of water, it shook
hands with its owner, and then, in an access of clumsy
affection, threw back its honest head and kissed him, I was
irresistibly reminded of Ray and other Labradors whom I
have known.
So much for the outward seeming of my dog. For his
qualities of heart and brain let these few words suffice:-He
was always affectionate and joyous. No rebuff ever changed
his love, and no disappointment ever cast a shadow of gloom
on his perfect good humour. He was a friend to all the other
dogs, even to the jealous old spaniel who growled down his
cheerful advances. With his human friends his life was one
round of faithful kindness and indefatigable tail-wagging.
He was a sportsman of great natural gifts improved by careful
practice. No elaborate training had been necessary for him;
he seemed to know by intuition that no scurry of fur or
flutter of feather must disturb him from the heel of his
master till the word was given. He was a good and business-
like tracker, excellently equipped with a nose of high quality.
His teeth never left a mark on the bird which, with an air of
proud submission, he bore back to his master's hand..
I now approach the incident of the slipper, but first I must
mention bones, a subject of some importance to a dog. The
human force of his reasoning powers had not preserved this
Labrador from the canine habit of burying in the earth the
bones for which, having picked them clean, he had at the
| moment no further use. In such cases all dogs have one

WINTRY NOTES.
FACTS ABOUT THE THERMOMETEN.
(By an Old Philadelphia Meteorologist.)
“PUZZLED ” writes from Balham to ask
what exactly is the difference between
the Thermometer and the Barometer.
This opens up a very interesting subject,
and one which, during the present cold
snap, must have been in the minds of
many of my readers. Briefly, the dis-
tinction may be put in this way: the
barometer (that is to say, the mercury
inside it) cannot get below 29 or above
32; the thermometer can, and very
frequently does. If, then, your baro-
meter is found to measure“ 25 on grass”
(a technical term, which I may explain
later on), you may be pretty sure that
your chemist has misled you, and has
given you the wrong article.

Perhaps the most remarkable feature
of the present weather is the extra-
ordinary part played by the thermometer;
so that some further remarks about this
instrument may not be out of place.
There are three kinds of thermometer,
known as Centigrade, Fahrenheit, and
Réaumur. Réaumur may be dismissed
at once, as it is so difficult to pronounce.
M. CENTIGRADE was an Alsatian scientist,
and his first work was to invent the
thermometer which bears his name.
His second was to invent the Fahrenheit
thermometer. About this an interesting
story is told.

Fahrenheit is the German for “fur-
coat.” Now. M. CENTIGRADE was a man
of plebeian birth; and, as soon as he
had made a little money by his first
thermometer, he decided that his one

appearance was to purchase a luxurious |

THE GREAT STRIKE.
Our Special Representative has again
outdone The Daily Mirror', and obtained
some items of exclusive news regarding
the great music-hall strike. Disguised
in a light check suit, a blue chin, a
thick gold watch-chain, and a smart
little brougham, he has gone in and out
among “the profession, and heard
many things which he had no business
to hear.
I learn (he writes) that Miss MARIE
Lloyd is ready to start at any moment
on a tour through the country in a
motor-car of a vivid red colour. Her
purpose is to address roadside meetings
from her car, in the hope of arousing
the people of the country to a sense of
their duty in this great struggle.
(Costumes by Worili, wigs by CLARKSON.

It is rumoured that Litile Tici is to

meeting of the National Alliance of
Employees. It will be his first appear-

a highly pathetic order.
Miss Victoria Monks las long desired
to become a Suffragette, but has been

part in the movement by her contracts

affords an opportunity, which she intends
to use to the full, of being present at
the next suffrage scrimmage, and The
Weekly Dispatch hopes to publish a
series of articles from her pen under the
title “From Halls to Holloway; My

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 6, 1907.
The lady advanced to occupy
The chair: she was all but in it-
When, lo, with a tympanum-piercing cry,
The moke from the door-step seemed to fly
In less than a quarter minute.
The mind of the beast was soon made up,
For the look of the lady had filled his cup;
And before you could say Jack Robinson
The donkey and chair and all were gone.
And away and away and a way he flew,
While his owner after him shuffled ;
And up the hill like a flash he drew
His chair with a pace completely new,
For liis feelings were sadly ruffled.
And faster and faster along the flat
He sped to escape the lady fat,
Till he came to the edge of the cliff, and then
Went over, and never was seen again.
And still, when the nights are wild and chill,
And the furious winds are shrieking,
The ghost of a donkey scales the hill
At a break-neck pace with a cry that's shrill,
And his chair comes after him creaking.
And men say this is the very one
Who fled from a lady of twenty stone;
Who had never in all his life gone fast,
Till he sighted her bulk and went at last! R.C.L.
EASY.
A LEGEND OF BOURNEMOUTA.
THERE once was a moke that drew a chair,
And the name of the moke was Easy:
His coat was matted with thick grey hair
Wherever it hadn't been rubbed quite bare,
And his wind was a trifle wheezy.
This moke did duty in Bournemouth town,
Where the hills go up and the slopes go down;
And he drew a chair, as I said before,
On the cliff that edges the Bournemouth shore.
There never was anything patienter
In life or in song or story
Than this same Easy, who wouldn't stir
Unless his proprietor laced his fur,
His fur which was thick and hoary.
It was “Get up, carn't yer,” and “Stir your stumps,"
And “Now we're off," and “What-ho, she bumps!”
And “Excuse me, mum, if I made too free,
But the donkey 'll be the death o' me."
He might have been eight or nine or ten,
He might have been twelve or twenty ;
For none of us knew precisely when
He first swam into the ken of men,
But we judged that his years were plenty.
His eyes were luminous, large and meek,
And his nose was soft as a young girl's cheek ;
And his ears he waggled them to and fro,
And his pace was a mile an hour or so.
He refused to follow the ways of ants,
Who never put in a rest-day;
And his owner was garbed in a pair of pants
(He was one of the oldest inhabitants)
That had managed to see their best day :
In frayed old pants, and a gaberdine,
The raggedest robe that was ever seen,
And a purple face, and a thing that sat
Askew on his head and was called a hat.
He liked his fares to be thin and light,
This moke as he went a-chairing;
And then, when the Bournemouth sun shone bright
On the sands, the sea and the Isle of Wight,
He started out for an airing:
He started out, but he soon stopped dead,
And I can't repeat what his owner said ;
And the fare observed, “It's a shame to baste
A beast, but you see he won't make haste.”
So matters went on till one fine day,
When there wasn't a cloud in heaven,
With his harness polished and bright and gay,
The moke came round in the usual way
At a little before eleven.
· And he stood at the door and waited there,
With his chair prepared for a lady fare ;
And his head was drooped and his forelegs bent,
Like Patience upon a monument.
And a voice said, “This is the donkey ? Law!
Do you think he can really do it?”
And Easy he turned his head and saw
A sight that struck on his lieart with awe-
No moke could have cottoned to it-
For the figure that stood at the Pension door
Was a lady of twenty stone or more;
And what with her rugs and wraps and that
She certainly seemed to be far too fat.
“WILLIAM BAKER”: THE NEW PARLOUR GAME.
“WILLIAM BAKER" is simple and inexpensive, yet full of
genuine healthy excitement. It can be played with money,
nuts or war medals. Those who object on principle to
large stakes may even use confetti.
To start the game, the following advertisement is put in a
paper :-“Will the relatives of the late WILLIAM BAKER, who
died between the years 1890 and 1906, kindly communicate
with -- --? (here supply full name and address of the
promoter of the game] and they may hear of something to
their advantage.”
For obvious reasons it is advisable to advertise early.
| With the aid of the following rules any intelligent person
(and “William Baker" appeals peculiarly to persons of
| intelligence) may grasp the principles of the game.
The players having assembled (this is an essential point)
all the letters (unopened) are dealt round, with the exception
I of twenty-one which form a pool.
The first player (usually a lady) then opens her top enre-
lope and calls out in a clear voice the degree of relationship
which the writer claims to the late W. B. Having done that,
she neatly tears her letter across, and all the other plarers
pay her her score. She is followed by the gentleman on her
right, who plays his top envelope exactly in the same manner.
Note.-Widows and Birth Certificates entitle a player to
draw one letter from the pool.
The scoring is as follows :-

THE HOME SECRETARY and the police
authorities have been attacked for
allowing an innocent man to remain
in prison. But justice demands that
it should be remembered that a large
number of guilty persons are allowed
to remain out of prison.
A gentleman who has been reading
about the preliminaries of the Thaw

It is feared that the title of Mr. CYRIL

may cause it to be confused, in the
minds of country cousins, with the

A correspondent inquires whether
the Urania Society is the Music Hall

Mr. TREE desires it to be known that
there is no truth in the statement that
has been made public in a London
paper that he contemplated appearing
at a Music Hall. The assertion that he
intended to take the part of HARRY

improbable by many persons.

The finer spirit panting to be free,

A soul ethereal, pining to discard
All earthly ties and live at Nature's

And that, if I may say so, 's where the

Art but a wildfowl, and as such endued
By kindly Nature with an unrefined
But lively lust for food.

What time, a sailor, I designed to pass

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MODERATE OR PROGRESSIVE ?
MR. PUNCH SETTLES THE QUESTION.
WITH the London County Council
elections in immediate prospect, Mr.
Punch has instituted, with his customary
benevolence and acumen, an inquiry
into the question whether the spirit of
the age is moderate, or whether it is
progressive. Candidates and voters
alike will be surprised to learn that it is
neither. It is retrograde. In every
department of life there are signs of
backward movement, excepting in those
where the depression has reached the
limit.
Take, for example, the various branches
of Science, Letters and Art. Mr. Punch's
expert investigators have discovered that
all Literature can be traced to one
fundamental fact, and that is stationery.
They find, too, that there is evidently
no longer any desire to create History,
for records are broken as soon as made;
and that the Drama is being remodelled
on lines laid down by the Backonians.
One cannot write so much as an ordinary
letter without sealing the back of an
envelope, and licking the back of a
stamp. Art yearly fills our Academy
with pictures which, according to many
critics, would be improved by being
hang back to front; and some of Mr.
Punch's own best drawings are pre-
historic. Architecture and Sculpture
have crammed London full of eyesores
and modern instances. Education is
notorious for its particular attention to
backward boys; and attention is most
frequently applied to their backs.
In commercial circles the investigators
hear the same tale. London's greatness
dates from the time of WHITTINGTON, the
Lord Mayor who turned back. The
works most often consulted by business
men are the Blue Books containing
Board of Trade returns. No enterprise
is ever set on foot without some one to

DODGE-MUD, AND HOW TO
PLAY IT.
A GAME FOR A Rainy Day.
DODGE-MUD is a game for Londoners
in London. Played properly it is better
than Golf; it is cheaper and affords
more occasions for self-control. No
apparatus is required beyond a pocket-
knife and a clothes-brush to remove the
inud after each game, and no special
costume is necessary, although the
interest and excitement will be increased
if you happen to be playing in your best
clothes. It is a game within the reach
of all-city clerk, retired colonel, seam-
stress and leader of fashion. Evervone
who can walk can play. All that is
required is rain; 11 of an inch is
sufficient on roads laid down under
Borough contracts, but the more the
rain the faster the game.
Dodge-mud is an out-door game, and
can be played in any London street.
It can be played on the way to and from
the daily work; few games have this
advantage.
| Any one can play excepting sandwich-
and police-men. They cannot; they
can only look on.
The game is played with mud.
There are two sides. You are one,
called the Dodger. Bus-men, coachmen,
chauffeurs and all other drivers of
vehicles are the other; they are called
the Splashiers.
It is the object of the Splashers to
get the mud out of the road on to the
Dodger. The Dodger tries to dodge it.
Splashers may only drive through the
mud; they may not use their whips or
any other implement.
A Dodger may only use two methods :
(1) The dodge-direct, which consists in
springing lightly back or to one side.
(2) The dodge-indirect, which is simply

IN THE POLICE COURTS, 1910.
At the Westminster Police Court,
Martin CARTER, aeronaut to the Marquis
of STIRKDALE, surrendered to his bail.
The prosecution was instituted under
the 5th section of the Act of last year,
and the accused was charged with
having wantonly, and to the incon-
venience of divers persons, discharged
gas from the Balloon No. 2358 L. It
was proved that on June 15 the prisoner
set down the Marquis on the Terrace
outside the House of Lords. The con-
stable on duty then requested him to
move higher up, but he refused and
threw open the valve of his balloon.
The House of Commons was invaded by
an enormous volume of gas, and as four
Irish Members happened to be speaking
at the time a horrible explosion was
averted by the merest accident.
The Magistrate said that competition
of this kind was perfectly intolerable.
He fined the prisoner ten pounds, and
directed the conviction to be endorsed
on his licence.
JAMES BRISTOWE was charged before
Mr. PLOWDEN with negligence in the
management of his balloon. There
was a second charge of drunkenness,
but it was withdrawn, as the police
admitted that the prisoner had only
been “slightly elevated.”
DANIEL MURPHY deposed that on
Wednesday evening he and his wife were
engaged in an argument in the middle
of the road. The prisoner was drifting

evening papers. Moved by curiosity he
lowered his balloon, and the grapnel

PRINCE BUF.Low made a violent attack
on The Daily Mail in the Reichstag last
week. Surely, if ever there was justifi-

Germany, here it is.

Canada has tired of servant-girl immi-

Dominion Government, and a demand is
now being made for "well-bred, well-

Canada would perhaps once more come

take our Suffragettes. They certainly
possess enthusiasm.
“Gambler mauled by Lion ” was the
heading given by The Daily News to
an item last week. A well-known
feminist writes to point out that this
is the latest attempt to deprive her sex
of credit. As a matter of fact it was a
lioness who administered the punish-

THERE is a cherished belief among all good Americans that
the “Britisher” has no sense of humour. A flood of light is
thrown on the origin of this error by the following passage
from a leading paper, The New York Times. After all, it
takes two to make humour effective one to produce it and
one to understand it. The italics, our own, take the place
of superfluous comment :-
"This episode (the appeal for the 'Auld Brig of Ayr') has suggested
to Punch the idea of preparing English translations of Burns's verses.
Punch apologises that it has sometimes been necessary to sacrifice the
lilt and musical sweetness' of the lines to preserve the immortal
plowman's idea. Here is an example of Punch's handiwork, the first
verse of 'Auld Lang Syne':.
'It would be a most improper proceeding to cancel the claims of

And to refrain from remembering them;
That is why we ask if such connections should be foregone,
Together with the days that were a long while since ?

But a girl that has an angel's face
Ought to frame it like an angel's—simply.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Farewell! I have no heart to stay in Town.
I know a picturesque old Haunted Mill
Where walks my friend, the Ghost of WILLIAM BROWN:-
Yes, I shall have to go and settle down
With Bony Bill! Dur-Don
THE CRY OF AN EVICTED GHOST.
My ancient home, farewell! The die is cast.
Soon will rude labour cart away your stones;
Your tiles have gone; your beams are going fast;
And I must quit the refuge of my past,
Also my bones.
There is no room but has its private ties;
No corner but is hallowed by a host
Of mem'ries, humorous and otherwise
'Twas here that I (to my intense surprise)
Became a Ghost.
This is the landing where I first “appeared,"
And first beheld the human hair erect;
(It looks extremely like a turned-up beard,
Which, with a hat on, has a very weird
And odd effect).
Much time has passed since that momentous day,
And many a mortal tenant come and gone;
We got on very well, I'm proud to say,
Once they had grown accustomed to the way
I carried on.
Strangers would be a little shy, no doubt,
But there especially I did no harm ;
Indeed, my healthy action on the stout,
On victims to lumbago or the gout,
Worked like a charm.
With such it was my duty and delight
To meet them at the bottom of the stairs ;
And one and all, at that inspiring sight,
Have squattered off a record up that flight,
Lepping like hares.
And this old room, where often I retired
For solitude ; it was a striking fact
That all young ardent couples were inspired
With the same brilliant notion--which required
Much ghostly tact.
I had a plan both delicate and new:-
When it was clear that someone had to go,
Stealing up silently behind the two,
I sportively materialised, and blew!
And added, “Boh”!
And yon dim nook ;-oh, EMMA, ghostly fair !—
'Twas here I wooed her! To my bitter hurt
She spurned me for a comelier! And where
She's got to now I neither know nor care;
Gassy old flirt!
Those were far days! And you have long been old,
And mortal tenants flock to you no more ;
They want strange innovations now, I'm told;
Bathrooms (good gracious !)-water, hot and cold !
(Lord knows what for !)
'Tis long since last I heard the tradesmen call;
Long since I heard your rusty door-bell ring;
But I stayed on. My social needs were small;
My peace was very great, and after all
Quiet 's the thing.
And now e'en I must leave you, hallowed spot,
As from the sinking vessel flies the rat;
Men claim your “eligible building plot”
For piles of flats! And frankly I do not
Fancy a flat!
THE WRIGHT METHOD OF BIOGRAPHY.
Having successfully brought out his monumental illustrated
Life of the late WALTER PATER, Mr. Thomas Wrigut has,
we are informed, now returned to the completion of his
biographical magnum opus, Darwin and his Friends. Here
for the first time a flood of light will be thrown on the great
Victorian philosopher and naturalist's inner life, which will,
as in the case of Pater, be inexorably illustrated by a pro-
fusion of magnificent and poignantly appropriate plates,
many hundreds in number.
Of these the most important and significant are the follow-
ing:-
(1) Figure-head of the Beagle, in which Darwin made his
celebrated voyage to South America.
(2) Belaying-pin from the Beagle, kindly lent by th:
grandson of the purser who sailed on the voyage in question.
(3) Photograph of the Eton Beagles breaking up a hare.
(4) Portrait of the Headmaster of Eton conversing with
Mr. Wright.
(5) Portraits of Mr. Silas K. HOCKING, Miss MARIE CORELLI,
and Mr. MORLEY ROBERTS, illustrating Darwin's notorious
fondness for novels.
(6) Facsimile (life-size) of early Victorian bull's-eyes, to
illustrate Darwin's extraordinary partiality as a boy for
sweetmeats.
(7) Pen-drawing of Darwin's, dust-bin, with Mr. WRIGHT
in the foreground.
(8) Facsimile of one of Darwin's washing bills, now in the
possession of the biographer.
(9) Facsimile of a letter from Darwin declining an honorary
degree from the University of Speonk, N.Y.
(10) Daguerreotype portrait of the hairdresser who used
to cut the hair of the great philosopher. :
(11) Daguerreotype portraits of five other hairdressers who
never cut Darwin's hair.
(12) Photograph of the stocks at Down (Kent), with Mr.
Wright in the foreground.
(13) Photograph of Down Street Station on the Brompton-
King's Cross Tube Railway.
(14) Photograph of Darwin's family boot trees.
(15) Pen drawing of two lumps of sugar which DARWIN
refused to have put in a cup of tea while paying an after-
noon visit on Mrs. BEGTHWAYT, a neighbour of his in Kent.
(16) Water-colour sketch of a rocking-horse belonging to
the grand-niece of Darwin's groom, ANDREW BOAKES.
(17) Enlarged photograph of an earthworm recently dis-
covered at Down by Mr. WRIGHT.
(18) Photograph (reduced) of a carpet bag belonging to
JONAS WORNUM, a schoolmate of Darwin's, who subsequently
made a fortune as a hardware manufacturer.
(19) Collotype portraits of three friends of Darwin of whom
no one has ever heard.

(22) Portrait of Mr. BERNARD Danwin, the famous amateur
golfer, as he appeared when interrogated by Mr. Wrigut on
the subject of missing links.

(24) Snapshot of the DARWIN family on receiving the
momentous intelligence that Mr. Wright was deterinined to
undertake the biography of their illustrious ancestor.

SMITA took an excellent First,
The thesis included a swarm
Brown took a sort of a Third,
Of new and original “ quotes,"
And his Viva was one of the worst
Of statements in tabular form
The examiners ever had heard.
And bibliographical notes.
The tutors agreed that while Smith would proceed
Brown at once got a chair, as you 're doubtless aware ;

His treatise is set in Otago,
A person like BROWN need not aim at renown,
In Texas they con every word of this don,
He was bound to sink down
And they quote him from Bonn
To obscurity.
To Chicago.
But now-a-days who cares a pin
Now what of the tutors ? Of course,
For the chance of a flukey exam.,
SMITH may have the soul of a muse,
What class two-and-twenty may win
And he also may lecture with force
On the banks of the Isis or Cam ?
When he takes to expressing his views;

So Brown flew away from the High,
Be warned, then, in time, undergrads,
In Bloomsbury safely he perched,
And do not, like SMITH, fondly cling
And daily, till dinner was nigh,
To that worst of all Plato's vile fads-
In the British Museum researched.
"I know that I don't know a thing."
He waded through screeds of what nobody reads,
If you aim at renown take example by BROWN
Through chronicles dead as the dodo,
(That way lies success, never doubt it !);
Then he published a tract called “An Unobserved Act Cock-sure is his pose on the subject he chose,
Throwing light on the Pact
And he knows that he knows
With Duke Odo.”
All about it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
La
THE PUTNEY PAGEANT.
MR. SWINBURNE's seventieth birthday
occurring on the 5th of April, Putney,
the riverside hamlet in which he has
so long dwelt, has decided to rise to the
occasion and celebrate this auspicious
event-auspicious not only in the life of
England's greatest living poet, but in
the annals of the suburb too. For by
making his home here Mr. SWINBURNE
has linked Putney with Parnassus. They
are now as like as two P's, to quote
one of the wittiest mots of Mr. WATTS-
DUNTON, the famous gipsy critic and the
poet's most faithful Achates.
The following provisional programme
has been drawn up, with no assistance
whatever from Mr. Louis NAPÕLEON
PARKER. At an hour before sunrise the
Lord Mayor and Corporation of Putney
will assemble outside the Poet's residence,
“The Pines” (at the foot of Alliteration
Avenue, leading to Wimbledon Common),
and serenade him with songs written in
his hot youth for such early occasions.
It is expected that either the Poet or
Mr. WATTS-DUNTON will make some sort
of a reply, but what form it will take
is not likely to be known until it happens.
The two friends will then be allowed
to return to bed (in the case of Mr.
WATTS - DUNTON, in a caravan in the
garden), and the breakfast interval will
be taken by the municipal revellers.
After breakfast Mr. SWINBURNE will be
waited upon by a deputation of fellow
Algernons, headed by Mr. ALGERNON
ASHTON and Sir ALGERNON West, and
completed by the Piccadilly Johnnie
with the little glass eye and the Mayor
of Algeciras. These gentlemen will first

IN HAPPY DUNMOW.
RICH PROGRAMME FOR THE BACON FESTIVAL.
SHAKSPEARE is not to be allowed this
year to have it all his own way. There
is to be a Bacon Festival too, and it will
be on a scale of some magnificenco. St.
Albans might seem at the first blush its
best venue, but by a fortunate chance
Dunmow's traditional claims were
thought of in time, and the little Essex
town (the birthplace of CLYDE FLITOH the
great American dramatist) was selected
for the high honour. A special service
of motor omnibuses will run during the
festival between St. Albans and this
place, and the two towns for that occasion
only will also be connected by wireless
telegraphy.
The Dunmow Festival, which is in the
capable hands of Mr. Louis NAPOLEON
PORKER, assisted by Sir THOMAS LIPTON,
Mr. WILLIAM HARRIS and the President
of the Baconian Society, will open on
April 22, synchronously with the rival
festival at Stratford-on-Avon for the
play-actor and holder of horses' heads-
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE—to whom has fallen
for too many years the honour of wearing
the giant's robe, presented to him, for
reasons of his own, by the Great Chan-
cellor. The two Festivals will end
simultaneously.
Mr. PORKER has been fortunate in
obtaining the services of a first-class
touring company from Chicago, known
as the Prime Packers, who will give a
series of performances of Bacon's plays
in the theatre that is now being rapidly
built. On the opening night Hamlet
will be played, with Mr. THOMAS B. RASHER
as the melancholy Dane, and Miss LYDIA
BRISKET as Ophelia. These are both fat
parts.
Mr. HALL CAINE has rented a semi-
detached villa for the fortnight, and will
walk in the front garden daily.

DEAR Sir,— We beg to inform you that
we are now making our Spring Contracts.
The C. L. A. is the only agency of its
kind, and has been founded to meet the
wants of Editors who desire ex-convicts,
murderers, and burglars to write their
reminiscences. We enclose herewith our
new circular for the season.
We catch the convict at the prison-
gates, just as his time is up, and retain
him exclusively. Our list includes some
of the most miserable blackguards of
the age. By our process they become
heroes.
WHY I MURDERED HENRY Jimm.
By ex-convict Y 234.
The JIMM murder was the cause
célèbre of fifteen years ago. The man
who did it was sentenced to penal servi-
tude for life, as his case was taken up
by a well-known firm of solicitors, whose
speciality is the reprieving of criminals.

ing story afresh with delightful touches
of humour. Price, £10 108. a thou-

Do You THINK I WAS Guilty ?
By William Bludjohn (ex-convict W 3213).
WILLIAM BLUDJOHN was arrested, tried
and found guilty twenty years ago for
the murder of three policemen, his
brother, and his sweetheart. There
were extenuating circumstances at the
time, and BLUDJOIN, who has never
ceased to protest his innocence, was
sentenced to twenty-five years' penal
servitude. Everybody loved him in
the prison, and he rose to be the con-
fidant of the Governor. He has just

THE
A PLEA FOR PANEGYRIC.
By the Editor of “P.T.F.” (“Praise
to the Face.”)
De mortuis nil nisi bonum is in its
way an excellent adage, but why, in the
TIMUFFATE
words of dear old Solon, should we wait
for the end? Why not antedate our
eulogies and bestow them, when well-
merited, on the living as well? There
has long been a ridiculous prejudice
against "praise to the face,”. due no
doubt to that Pagan superstition em-
bodied in the story of the Ring of
POLYCRATES ; but the progress of civilisa-
tion has gone far to eliminate it from
the mental equipment of the up-to-date
journalist. Cynics and misanthropes
strive to disparage the beneficent influ-
ence of panegyric by comparing it with
-butter. Yet a dispassionate inquiry
will abundantly convince all but the
most prejudiced observers that the com-
parison is honorific rather than the
reverse. Butter is the supreme product
of milk, which is the recognised emblem
of human kindness. The cow, except in
rare moments of irritation, is the very
incarnation of gentleness, serenity and
magnanimity. HOMER, that grand old
prophet of the land of Nod, employed the
epithet “ox-eved” to express an essential
attribute of feminine beauty. The Irislı,
the grandest race under the canopy,
have been largely reared on butter-
milk.

Dear Mr. Punch, I know I'm only a

this that I said to Father yesterday?
You must know that Father is a

silence was partially restored, “applies

does not affect the incomes of the living.”

(From our Correspondent.)
St. Petersburg, April 2, 1908.—Mr.
GEORGE ALEXANDER opened his season
last night at the Imperial Theatre before
a crowded and brilliant audience. Owing
to a strike of electricians, there was a
serious risk that, for want of ade-
quate illumination, the performance
would have to be postponed, but by
heroic exertions and the purchase of a vast
quantity of fairy lamps, Mr. ALEXANDER
contrived to cope with the emergency,
and the curtain rose only about three-
quarters of an hour late. The play
chosen for the opening performance was
His House in Order, and the presence
of the Duma, who entirely filled the
stalls and dress circle, lent a peculiar
appropriateness to the choice. The
Premier, M. STOLYPIN, and several Grand
Dukes occupied boxes, and a contingent
of anarchists, closely watched by the
police, were conspicuous in the gallery.
In these circumstances it will readily be
imagined that the scene in the auditorium GUNNINE kinin

Of dancing fun
As ever scurried about
With a laugh and a shout
Under the sun.
Tumbles ? What does a tumble matter?
Down she goes with a crash and clatter;
She has scraped her hand ; she has barked her shin ;
She has lost a lot of her precious skin ;
But she's up in a moment and off again,
With something more than a hint of rain
In the dark eyes brimming to ease her pain.
There's a touch of the South
In her laughing mouth,
And the rich, deep flush of her rounded cheek,
And her hair with its tresses fine and sleek
That she flings about, with her tossing head
Set off and bound with the ribbon's red.

She swallows them steadily letter by letter,
Line by line and chapter by chapter:

To win your praise for her scholarly merit,
Or to learn a piece and to say it well
With a voice that sounds like a silver bell;

A taste for the multiplication table,
And hasn't acquired it, and doesn't seem able
To face a collision
With long division :
Figures are things you 'll fail to fix
In the busy brain of this girl of six,
And when you stow her away in bed
She often stands on her impish head,
Or slides to the floor till you send her back
With a great pretence at a sounding smack.

Preaching humility with zeal appalling;
As though a peacock to a flock of wrens

Your cooking is unutterably bad;
But all your other misdemeanours pale

Some glass and china, quite a decent lot,
Your casual duster passed-and it was not.
Nor have you spared yourself; the frequent bruise,
The scalded hand bound up with rag and string,

Against all claims that may percbance accrue;
And I have tried to do the same for you.
But when the Agents of the several Firms
Called here and saw you, one and all declined
To take the risk upon the usual terms
Or at still higher payments; and I find
That Lloyd's, in your case, will not be content
With any premium under cent. per cent.
So we must part! for if you were to stay
I could no longer, when I heard the wreck
Of the few things still left, devoutly pray
That you just once for all might break your neck;
Far then I should be ruined through the Act,
So kindly understand that you are sacked.

THE COUNSELS OF BUCKSHOT.
(With acknowledgments to “S.” in “The
Westminster Gazette.")
HAVING Occasion to investigate the
affairs of my friend BUCKSHOT, recently
deceased, I was astounded at the
voluminous notes upon men and matters
which he had made. Nothing seems to
have escaped his comment-he jotted
down impressions of marmalade, motor-
buses, A. B. C. girls, spiritualism, most
impartially. I confess I do not grasp
fully the meaning of some of the remarks,
but I place a few of them ungrudgingly
before an unsuspecting public in the
confidence that, not knowing my address,
it will be unable to make me a sub-
stantial token of its gratification.
Turning first to a little volume of
870 pages ticketed “Spring,” I select a
sentence or two instancing BUCKSHOT'S
wide observation :-
"Nature is renewed ” (he says) “in
Spring .... The time of snow is past;
birds sing, trees put forth fresh leaves.
... How strange it is that the imma-
nence of Spring should be so inherent !”
I pass over Summer and Autumn,
on which his meditations are no less
inspiring, and come to this flawless gem
under the heading “Margarine :"-
"To contemplate a pound of Margarine
in the right spirit is to the wise man
very helpful in seasons of mental dis-
tress. He appreciates the gulf between
the false and the true, the real and the
unreal, the sporadic and the epidemic.
... And if the contemplation of a
pound of Margarine can so uplift the
soul, how much better were it to consider
two pounds."
After Margarine there is a dissertation
on Mumps :-
"A child with the mumps is a pathetic
object, but a man with the mumps is a
butterfly, so to put it, broken upon the
wheel. Yet his companions are merry

ſ“ Arcturus, which is a gigantic orb equal to some twelve or thirteen
hundred suns like our own, is flying through space at the rate of some
257 miles per second in a straight line for ever. . . . If PTOLEMY were
now alive it would require all his skill to perceive that Arcturus held a

ARCTURUS is whirled across space
In a race
With himself at a pace
Which takes him through heaven,
Professors have reckoned,
At two fifty-seven
Full miles to the second !
Just imagine him fizzing
And whizzing ;
His size,
As he flies,
Is a mass of twelve hundred and more times the sun.
In an eager endeavour
He dashes for ever
Straight on with no possible object but fun.
For in vain is the pace of this monarch of stars,
Who has burst through the bars
That impeded his force :
In the years that have gone
He has hardly put on
Half an inch to the visible length of his course.
Now to fly and get on is no end of a game,
But to fly without moving, to stay in the same
Spot
Is not
What a planet with any respect

Would select.
For if PTOLEMY saw him to-day
He would say,
“You 're a run-away star,
But you haven't got far,
And, forgive the remark, you were just where you are
When I saw you some thousands of seasons ago.
For a star of your parts you 're confoundedly slow."
What the deuce
Is the use
Of this fever and fuss,
If Arcturus is still so absurdly like us ;
If, in spite of his chances,
He never advances ;
If he breaks all the records for scurry and fizz,
But with all his impatience remains where he is ?
And yet he is whirled across space

A BLANK DAY.
(Being an attempt to fill a column or 80 of
"Punch” in the manner of that expert
cricketer “ Linesman.")
The weather is the supreme arbiter of
cricket. This or that batsman may be
a contributory factor to material success,
but he is only an incidental in the great
gamut of things. Yesterday it rained
throughout the country, and the man in
the pavilion became the leading figure
on the stage, the deus ex machinâ of
cricketdom. The people's “ Tom” no

Had play been possible HOLLAND would

This HOLLAND is the gentleman among
professional batsmen. There is no
implication here against his fellows; it
is merely a question of style. This tall,
well-made HOLLAND has all the graces of
your PALAIRET or JACKSON. He is the
champagne of cricket, as HAYWARD is the
port. He is the Perseus of the side.
In the last match he made three.

we should have been overwhelmed by

who attended the performance, is re
ported to have declared that in the
whole course of his professional career
he had never witnessed a more perfect
imitation.

Our esteemed and veracious contem-
porary The Tribune has been giving some
intensely interesting details as to the
equestrian feats performed by Frau
Vogl and her horse in the last Act of
Götterdämmerung :-“When Brünnhilde
cried, 'Here, Grane, greet our friend,'
he became restive, snorted, and pawed the
stage. At the moment she sang 'Sieg-
fried, with a last blessing I greet thee,
without receiving the least sign, and
always at the same bar of the music, the
horse made ready, veered round, and
galloped straight across the stage towards
the burning logs. Gripping his mane,
Frau Vogl leapt on his back, and in a
moment horse and rider disappeared
among the rising flames.” In this
context it may be worth noting that by
the kind permission of the Editor of The
Spectator, the part of the Waldvogel in
Siegfried will be played and sung at the
next cycle by an extraordinarily talented
semi-Bombay Duck which has long
been one of the most attractive features
of the palatial office in Wellington

We know, Pat, it isn't your nature to clamour

The feverish struggle possesses no charm;
So we've found you a sinecure, Paddy,
My laddie,
A snug little berth where you live like a lord,
And pocket the gold and exhibit
Ad libit.
The virtues which spring of their own sweet accord.
Just be the natural Par, my boy ;
You can't do better than that, my boy.
You ’ve nothing to do
But just to be you
If you 're eager to kick and wax fat, my boy.
Your temper, of course, must be even and steady-
That 's easy enough with your fine native phlegm ;
If parents are trying you 'll always be ready
With patient endurance to listen to them.
You will teach all your boys con amore

ANOTHER OF LIFE'S LITTLE IRONIES.
An Unwritten Letter.
MY DEAR NORTHCLIFFE, -Everybody remembers your out-
spoken admiration for my talents at the time of the General
Election, and how nobly you boomed me in the columns of
The Daily Mail, to the great indignation of your own party.
To your assistance (under Heaven and aided by the cry of
Chinese Slavery, that admirable "inexactitude") I owed more
than I can say. Disloyalty, as you know, is repugnant to my
nature, and I never forget a service. I trust that after my
utterance in the House last Wednesday you will regard yourself
as well repaid.
Yours very faithfully,
WINSTON.
The Alien Invasion.
"Queen ELIZABETII and her Court receiving the French Ambassador
after the news that St. Bartholomew had reached England' (0. Coope),
a striking picture in which the QUEEN is shown pensive after the
ambassador had told his dreadful news.”—Cork Constitution.
When Britishers brag
Of their wide-ruling flag
You 'll never look daggers at all, my boy.
Of course, we 'll expect you to teach--mathematics,
Some physics, perhaps, and some chemistry too,
With history, Latin, French, German, and statics ---
But that's a mere trifle, dear Paddy, to you.
This thought, when your pupils annoy you,
Should buoy you:
As soon as you 're able to make it quite clear
You ’re a Crichton-cum-Solon-cum-Cato-
cum-Plato,
Why then you may hope for a hundred a year!
Dame Fortune keeps her smile, my boy,
For the lads of Hibernia's isle, my boy:
Then why should you roam
From your emerald home
If you 're after amassing a pile, my boy?

MODES FOR THE MASSES.
That excellent and too - little - read
periodical The Tailor and Cutter has
recently startled its patrons by the
publication of a Plate of Fashions for
Working-men. From this it is obviously
but a step to the “Clothes Letter,"
already so familiar a feature of certain
journals. In the immediate future may
we not expect to find something like
the following in, say, the Saturday edition
of The Morning Leader ?
From Bill Burge, Roadmender, in London,
to Jim Hopkins, of Little Slowcombe-
on-Mud.
DEAR JIM,—This being the start of
what they call here “The Season,” a
time when the principal streets of
London are annually taken up for
repairs, I have been so hard at work
as not to leave a moment for letter-
writing. However, as I know how
anxious you must be to hear all the
news of town, and especially what
people are wearing this Spring, here
goes for a start.

striking costumes I have observed any-
where lately was to be seen the other
afternoon in St. James's Park, where its
wearer is employed on the extension of
the new processional route. The loose
blouse-like shirt, in an artistic tint of
faded green, was made remarkably full,
and was of some soft clingsome material,
probably flannelette, though this I was
unable to get near enough to ascertain
decisively. It was confined at the
waist by a broad buckled belt of maroon
leather, which also passed through the
upper portion of the trousers. These

FALSE COLOURS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, -I am that common
object of the pavilion, a cricketer with
a grievance, and I fancy that you may
be able to help me. Briefly I wish
you to contradict the erroneous impres-
sion which has got abroad as to my
abilities with the ball. I wish you to
state in your columns, emphatically and
on oath, that I am not, never have been,
and never shall be, a bowler. Unless
you do this, I shall retire from the game
altogether; and, Mr. Punch, I am sure
you would not like me to do that.
But, perhaps, I should explain why
I am so anxious to disclaim the reputa-
tion which has been thrust upon me;
and to do this I must go back to my
school-days. At school I got into the
eleven as a moderate bat and a keen
field; but I was also (if I may say it)
the best fifth-change bowler in England.
You know, of course, the qualities
required of a fifth-change bowler? He

five not out, and the other ninety-one,

used to separate them in two overs. In
the first they would complete their cen-
turies; and in the second they would
hit out recklessly, and get caught in the
deep. I was allowed two overs, because
I was supposed to be finding my length
in the first one.
My mission accomplished, I would be
taken off, in order that the original bowler
might get to work on the new-comers.
The result of this was that by the end
of the season I had taken twenty-five
wickets for about twenty runs apiece.
Not knowing the facts of the case, an

Here, where the walls are plastered with your praise
And midnight sees it on our roofs resurgent,
Where no grim mystery, no secret shame,

But you who passed, the sport of alien jeers,

REFINED companion! Sanitary friend !
Who, faring with me by the southward boat-train,
Met as we journeyed home your watery end,
Where Genoa sits enthroned, a sea-girt haute reine ;
Yours was the simple scent that cheered my nose
And overpowered Italia's rich afflatus
In regions where the almond-blossom blows,
But garlic has, in fact, a prior status.
The gilded orange-groves went slipping by ;
The sky, the sea, were blue, but ah, who was it,
When sections of that landscape stung my eye,
That helped me to remove their dumped deposit?
Who else but you could bring the touch of home
Or make the tears in grateful opties gather,
When, whiter than the Alps or Asti's foam,
I sought the solace of your smarting lather?
Your day is passed, you shall not rise again;
A sacrifice to Albion's homely custom,
: Your relics float in many a far-off drain ;
Some foreign basin was your funeral bustum ;
Successors hold your room at eve and morn,
But still your shadow lives, a thought of gladness,
Loyal as Baedeker in lands forlorn
That deem our lustral rites a mark of madness!

MEDITATIONS ON MARCUS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,— Having read a most
ingenious series of nine articles by Mr.
ARNOLD BENNETT on “How to Live on
Twenty-four Hours a Day," and gleaning
from them that he recommends one to
practise concentration during the spare
moments of the day by musing vigorously
on MARCUS AURELIUS, I began last night
by studying Book V. of the famous
Meditations.
My diary of to-day reads :-
7.30. Felt very sleepy on being
awakened, but repeated strenuously to
myself: “When you are drowsy in a
morning, and find a reluctance to getting
out of your bed, make this reflection
with yourself, 'I must rise to discharge
the duties incumbent on me as a man.”

is agreeable to the will and pleasure of
Jupiter himself,” repeated them aloud in
place of my usual observation. Thought
them a little lacking in vim, however.

I concentrated on that noble sentiment:
“O Jupiter, send us, we beseech thee,
send us rain upon all the land.” Unfor-
tunately left umbrella in the train.

way to the office unluckily skidded in a
rain-puddle and was impinged on by a
motor-bus.

THE SPLENDID PORTER.
As my hånsom drew up in the station
yard he emerged from some private lair,
and in a moment I felt like a storm-
tossed sailor who has reached his port.
The first half of the drive I had been
settling mentally what I should give the
cabman, and the second half I had been
wondering what he would say when he
saw it. This is my invariable habit
when I take a cab. The Scotch strain
in my blood, although naturally generous
enough, makes me decline from a sense
of duty to pay more than the strictly
legal fare; and the impulsive, cheery
Irish half of me makes me detest un-
popularity and a scene. I often wish
fervently that I was pure Scotch or pure
Irish.
But on this occasion there was really
no scene—for once. The porter took
the one-and-fourpence from my hand
and gave it to the cabman. He (the
porter) appeared to be a man of about
six foot six and generously built to

I ALWAYS thought myself
(And always told my wife)
I scorned superfluous pelf
And loved the simple life;
And though my better half
Might laugh,
Still stoutly I insisted
I would not share the load of care
Your millionaire is bound to bear.
In cabs, perhaps, and tipping chaps
I might not be close-fisted,
But on the whole, thought I, no soul
Of simpler tastes existed.
For long I stood alone;
All thought I was possessed
Whenever I made known
The creed that I professed.
But now a kindred mind
I find,
Whose view is mine completely;
I note with glee this devotee
Appears to see the world like me;
With joy I read the Spartan creed
Depicted here so sweetly ;
The homely round that she has found
Would suit me very neatly.
The seats of wealth I fly,
Your palaces repel-
In simple manor I
Would much prefer to dwell.
Give me a lawn where blows
The rose
And hollyhocks are present,
A house or two where just a few
Nice orchids do the winter through ;
A modest shoot of copse and root
I fancy would be pleasant,
Where I should not refuse to pot
The inexpensive pheasant.
My stables should not lack
Some hunters-four or five-
A trotter and a hack,
A cob or two to drive.
No simple homely sort
Of sport
My modest tastes disparage ;
I love the sound of bell-voiced hound
When fox is found and skims the
ground;
Nor do I bar the motor-car
When tired of coach and carriage,
And I could do with just a few
Within my humble garage.
Then what can people see
That should their laugliter raise
Whene'er I claim to be
A man of simple ways ?
I only ask to munch
For lunch
The homeliest kind of victual:
Quite pleased I am with chick or lamb
And just a dram of good, dry cham.
For sumptuous fare I do not care
The smallest jot or tittle-
Upon the whole was ever soul
Content with such a little ?

good jokes is nearly always a serious
person with a bald head. One must be
very happy in order to make bad jokes :
in other words one must be an optimist.
There is, of course, a philosophy of jokes,
just as there is a philosophy of buttons.
It is part of the sumptuous folly of adoles-
cent manhood to suppose that bad jokes
are not worth making. This is ad-
mirably shown in that poignant utterance
of mediæval realism, the harlequinade.
In the harlequinade the two who jest
are the middle-aged clown and the
senile pantaloon ; the barlequin says
nothing. The explanation is, as usual,
perfectly obvious. For the solemn,
masked figure of the harlequin stands
for the eternal young man who has
made up his mind only to say things
that are worth saying. ....
The question very naturally arises
here, How is one to know when a joke
is good and when it is bad? The
answer is abysmally simple: one cannot
know. There exists no way of trying it
on the dog, and in the absence of that
cowardly and inhuman expedient there
can be no perfectly flawless test. Per-
sonally, however, I may say that I try
them on myself. If they are good
enough for me they are good enough for

paper it does not matter so much.
When, however, I finally put them into
a book I discard the weaker ones.
On the advantages of being a
humorist there is much to be said, but
from motives of delicacy I shall not say
it. There are a large number of
humorists in Fleet Street, though on
this subject, too, a great amount of mis-

living he had written 3,000 begging
letters, and collected £1,340 (£15 of
which came from his parishioners !) to
wards supplying them with a church of
stone. By acting as his own architect,
clerk-of-works, contractor, master-work-
man, joiner, and stonemason, he erected
with that sum a building worth £2,000.
But Hate of Evil (HUTCHINSON), which
is the title of Mr. KEIGHLEY SNOWDON'S
vigorous story, has to do rather with
the workings of Dare's soul than with
his epistolary and manual labours. He
started his clerical career as a sworn
celibate, who regarded earthly love as a
vile thing. Wherefore Love took its
revenge, part of which consisted in his
being arraigned for the murder of the
first woman who taught him that love
could be beautiful and divine, as well
as ugly and earthly. Afterwards Love
relented, and, having taught him his
lesson, heaped coals of fire on his head.
And since Parson Dare, for all his
earnestness, was never a prig, I like
to think that they warmed instead of
scorching him.
Mr. William CAINE is a man who has
an ear for the throbbing heart-beats of
the moment, or else he keeps his eye on
the papers. His book, The Pursuit of
the President (ROUTLEDGE), is a rollicking
account of the efforts of Miss Waugh, a
Suffragette leader, to interview a member
of the Cabinet. He is Sir John Catter-

THE rain fell pitilessly. Mr. Punch shivered, and pulled his cloak more tightly around him. Toby had vanished into
1 the mist. Mr. Punce stood solitary, shielding his eyes from the storm and trying to penetrate the darkness in front
of him.
“Lost!” he soliloquised. “Totally lost. The place, the time, the season—all are strange. This ought to be
about the middle of England somewhere. But is it? I doubt it. This should be June. June! Ha! The year is-I
know I have the year on me—now where is it?" He felt in his pockets, and at length produced a small calendar,
“Yes, here we are-Nineteen Hundred and Seven. That is to say, it was Nineteen Hundred and Seven when I left London ;
but after all that I have been through—-" He broke off and began to shout. “Hallo! Hallo!”
A figure, strangely dressed, appeared suddenly out of the mist.
"Hi!” called MR. PUNCH. “Come here a moment, will you ?"
The man advanced, and dropped upon one knee.
“My lord hath need of his servant ?” he asked.
“Well, to tell you the truth,” said Mr. PUNCH, “I have. Though I don't think I should have put it quite that way

“That's just what I was coming to. I want to ask you something. I expect it sounds rather an absurd question,
but the fact is I'm afraid my calendar has—has stopped-and-in short, what year is this ? "
“The year of Grace One Thousand and Forty.”
Mr. Punch put his hand to his head.
“Just once more,” he said. “I didn't quite get hold of it. The year of Grace "
“One Thousand and Forty.”
MR. PUNCH turned away and looked anxiously through the mist.
“Where's TOBY ?” he said. “I want Toby. I must go home. Here! TOBY, TOBY!”
“Good my lord— ”
“Oh!” said Mr. PUNCH, “couldn't you say something else ? "
“Marry, fair Sir— "
“Yes, that is a little better, but— "
“ Toodle-oo, old spot.”
MR. PUNCH turned round at the amazing words and gazed at his companion. Then he stretched out his hand
and seized the other's.

“You did say it, didn't you?" he cried. “Those were your own words. "Toodle-oo, old spot.' Then you are

“Well," said the other, “not exactly. You see we're having a Pageant on here, and I'm taking a part. It's
only a small one, because I'm on the Committee and have to arrange everything; but I get so used to talking like that,
that-
“Ah, now I understand. And so you 're having a Pageant too!”
“What do you mean by 'too'? We're the Pageant.”
“Ah!" sighed MR. PUNCH,“that's what they all say. I started from London a week ago, stopping at various
places on the way. At every town I was told that there was to be a Pageant. It was to be the Pageant. St. Albans,
Bury St. Edmunds, Oxford, Romsey, Margate, Wapping—the Wapping Pageant, you've heard of that of course ?-
Tolpuddle, well, everywhere in fact—until I was sick of the very word Pageant. The epochs to be represented were various.
I reeled through the centuries. At Margate '
“Yes, yes; but ours is the Pageant that everybody is talking about. Do you realise where you are? This is
Coventry.”
"Oh!" said Me. Punct, “O-ho! So you 're "
“Jove!” said the other, as the mist rolled away for a moment, “it's MR. PUNCH! The very person I wanted.”
Mr. Punch bowed.
.“ What luck!” said the Committee-man excitedly. “You see, it's like this. We can't decide about the costume
or or otherwise—that the principal figure is to wear. We've wrangled about it for a long time ; until at the last meeting
I had a brilliant idea. I suggested that you should take Lady Godiva's place."
“But why?” asked MR. PUNCH." Why? Certainly I am always ready to do what I can in the cause of peace;
and (though I did not myself make the voyage to Germany the other day) yet I may say without boasting that the offensive
and defensive alliance with Monaco and the naval agreement with Switzerland were among the more happy results of my
last visit abroad. But in this case, to usurp a woman's place—even in the cause of peace would be distasteful to me."
“Ah, no," said the other," you would only be taking your rightful position. Cousider a moment. Godiva rode
through Coventry to lighten the burdens of the people. Is it not then fair that you, who have already lightened the
people's burdens so often, should now "
MR. PUNCH blushed. “You are too kind," he said.
" Besides, think of the weather. Would you let a woman— "
“No more--no more,” said Mr. PUNCH. “I will do it.”
“How can I thank you ?”
“Thank me not,” said the SAGE, “ too soon; you may yet repent that you asked me. For there is one difficulty
I can foresee. It is that the part of PEEPING Tom may become over-popular."
Ile paused dramatically for a moment.
“For,” he added, “I shall take with me my latest chef d'auvre.” And with that he modestly patted his
