i? THE SECRETS OF LONG
DRIVING.
THERE is some doubt as to the
authenticity of the signatures of the
following letters on the subject of
“ Long Driving at Golf.” On the
other hand, the letters themselves
bear an extraordinary resemblance to
those appearing over the same signa-
tures in C. B. Fry's Magazine for
July:-
My opinion is that the secret of
long driving is being fairly strong and
hitting the ball at the right moment.
If one's calves are not hard one does
not get enough out of one's back.
E. BLACKWELL.
In my opinion the principal thing
in long driving is hitting the ball pro-
perly. Some days one seems to hit
the ball all right, other days one does
not.
JOHN GRAHAM, JUN.
To my mind the most essential
part of long driving is hitting the ball
at the right moment. You see, so
many men hit it at the wrong
moment. The consequence is that
they will not get as far as some. Of
course some use their wrists more
than others, but I don't think it is so
important as hitting the ball in the
right way. A. V: HAMBRO.
Length is attributable, in the first
place, to strength in the usual places,
and secondly to hitting the ball per-
fectly; and to do this you must hit in
the right way. H. W. DE ZOETE.
I have always taken a great interest
in this question. Of course a youth
can swing more quickly than a man
who is set, and still more quickly
than a man who is upset. I believe
that all extra long drives are due to
the proper hitting of the ball.

BLENKINSOP rocked him vigorously.
“That will do; now leave him for a

We sat and regarded the cradle and
its occupant askance. A moment later,
at the summit of an appalling paroxysm,
the infant abruptly ceased its cries

DIVORÇONS.
[In a divorce case just reported from Washington, U.S.A., the judge,
in granting the wife's petition, held that the discontinuance of the
morning and evening kiss constituted cruelty.]
.. ARISE, O my suffering sisters, arise !
Too long have our spouses
Been kings in our houses,
Too long have we suffered with silence or sighs
Whatever these monsters might choose to devise.
Were they pleased to be bright to us,
Fairly polite to us,
How we would bow to them,
Blindly kow-tow to them;
If they were crusty, as often occurred,
We turned away meekly and said not a word.
Though our tender hearts were broken
By the tyrant's cruel slights
Not a word was ever spoken
Of the married woman's rights;
Though we pined for osculation,
Did we hint that we might miss
The pre-prandial salutation
Or the matutinal kiss ?
Ah, surely 'tis time that our lessons were conned,
That women united
To get their wrongs righted I
See, see how our sisters across the blue pond
Can deal with the man who forgets to be fond.
Do they sigh for him, pine for him,
Helplessly whine for him,
Ply all their arts for him,
Breaking their hearts for him ?
They take him to court if he shows too much phlegm
And doesn't prove legally tender to them.
Then they fall on him with fury,
And their tears they do not grudge
To a sympathetic jury
And a horror-stricken judge;
And a storm of groans and hisses
Greets the wretch who dares give less
Than the statutory kisses
And the law-prescribed caress.
Oh, truly our sisters are full of resource;
A cure they 've detected
For being neglected :
Let us follow them up in their glorious course,
And cry, not for fatuous votes, but divorce.
If a man can't be brought to do
All that he ought to do,
If he refuses us
Aught that amuses us,
Jibs when we take him out shopping, or sneers
At our social ambition and weakness for peers-
If he do not show repentance,
Let the wretch be dragged to court,
Where the judge pronounces sentence
And the monster's shrift is short.
With a little education
Like the lack of osculation,
These are acts of cruelty.

“ CAN PARROTS UNDERSTAND WHAT
THEY SAY?”
DEAR MR. PUNCI,– Your esteemed contemporary The
Spectator publishes a deeply interesting letter under the
above heading. I am in full agreement with the opinion
therein expressed, that parrots do understand the words
they employ. We have had a plain substantial grey
parrot for the last ten years. During that time it has
perfectly mastered two phrases, “ Pretty Polly” and
* Good-bye."
A tedious lady-visitor was worrying my wife, when our
bird, who was observing matters, said “Good-bye” in
the most pointed manner. The effect was instantaneous,
and, as my wife said, “No one could take offence at a
hint from a bird, and such a dear bird too.".
Another instance of sagacity. My wife had just en-
gaged a maid of singularly prepossessing appearance.
The first time the parrot saw the new servant it unhesi-
tatingly exclaimed, “ Pretty Polly!” Of course the
name was not strictly accurate, but how was the bird to
know that the girl was “ Susan,” and not “ Polly”?
I need say no more.

WEATHER INTELLIGENCE.
ſ“ The Judge said they had only themselves to blame for the bad
weather, for it was the swearing that brought it on."-A recent Report.]
You that of late were busily complaining
Of the pale Sun's obscure and futile glow,
Who thought it rained from being fond of raining,
And blew because it felt inclined to blow,
Who found your work, your play,
Your very week-ends, wholly chucked away,
Listen to me; I bring you weighty tidings-
Tidings, my erring friends, to give you pause;
'Tis in your own deplorable backslidings,
And them alone, that you must seek the cause.
Hear then my tale, and learn
The inner history of the whole concern.
For when the young Spring rose, and all things vernal
Blossomed anew, there swept across the land
A wave of language that was so infernal
That even Nature found it hard to stand;
My brothers, it was one
Too many even for our friend the Sun.
Day after day (with each day getting longer,
Which made it worse) His onward path He took,
While day by day your message came up stronger-
Really, He hardly knew which way to look,
Such wealth, such mass of sound
Impinged like shrapnel on His daily round!
Yet still He staggered through the course of duty,
Till, finally, there rose a strenuous hum,
So vivid, so incomparably fruity,
That, as a curate walking through a slum
Hides his diminished head
By putting an umbrella up, 'tis said,
“This is too much,” He cried, “henceforth and alway,
From My first beain o'er Greenwich, without fail,
E'en to My going down o'er furthest Galway,
I will obscure My Presence with a veil !
Then, 0 ye winds, awake;
One of you bring some clouds, for goodness' sake!”
'Twas done. The winds, in due allegiance, hearkened;
And daily from the sou-sou-west-by-sou
Up came the clouds until the skies were darkened,
To veil the splendour of His decent brow;
And thus, from morn till night,
You got your cold and rain-and serve you right!
A pretty tale, and moral in its bearing,
Yet, after all, it falls a trifle flat,
For, if you put the Weather down to swearing,
You raise the question, what you 're swearing at-
Which floors it altogether,
Because you 've all been swearing at the Weather.

It was in this fashion, as I remember, that LITTLE ALEC
used to carry on his avocation of dog-selling. Everybody
knew him; nobody believed him; yet somehow he used to
sell the strange curs that he led about the streets of Cam-
bridge. His margin of profit must have been consider-
able, but his din giness never altered, nor did his general
disreputability decrease. Parasitically attached, as it
were, to the undergraduate world, he lived his little day.
Here a trouser, there a coat, and there again a pair or
two of stockings came to him by way of barter, and en-
abled him to face the weather with his canine troop.
Where he obtained his animals was a mystery. Some
supposed that he made midnight raids on Oxford and
denuded that city of her stray dogs in order that he might
retail them at Cambridge; but for myself I reject this
imputation on the dog-fancying capacities of the sister
university. To his dwelling-place even imagination
refused to penetrate. Certainly he did not come from
Araby the Blest, nor from Ceylon's Isle, over which the
spicy breezes are said to blow soft, Nobody knew when
he ended. On one day, it seemed, he was. On the next
he had vanished to a country where there are no dogs, no
undergraduates, no trousers, and no red mufflers.

THE FINAL TEST.
(Extracted from future numbers of “The
Sportsman.")
Tuesday, August 20.-The third and
last test match began yesterday at
the Oval before a large attendance.
As our readers know, it has been
agreed to play this match to a finish
in the event of the usual three days
allotted not being sufficient. It is
as well that this is so, for very little
play was practicable yesterday. In-
deed, no sooner had Fry taken guard,
and VOGLER commenced his run up
to the wicket, when rain came down
in torrents, and play had to be aban-
doned for the day. ...
Thursday, August 22.—As we write
these words the rain has ceased, and
there is every prospect of a fine day
to-morrow. If this is so, the attend-
ance should prove a record one, as
the game has been left in a very in-
teresting position. Fry and Hay-
WARD are in, and FRY has taken
guard. VOGLER will be the bowler.
Wednesday, August 28.-Rain,
which had been continuous since 11
o'clock last Thursday, suddenly
stopped at 6.15 on Tuesday evening.
The umpires immediately examined
the pitch, and, to the intense disap-
pointment of the few spectators pre-
sent, declared that the wicket was too
wet for play.
Thursday, August 29.—The um-
pires having inspected the wicket
every half-hour through the night de-
cided at 5 o'clock yesterday morning
that no play would be possible till
next Monday.
Tuesday, September 17.—Thanks
to the enterprise of The Sportsman
the public has been kept informed of
the progress of the third test match.
The score yesterday stood at 3 for 1,

BRIGANDAGE FROM
A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW.
[Although we cannot supply our correspon-
dent with the information which he desires, we
greatly admire his idea. Apparently he has
lighted upon a new solation of the problem,
“What shall wo do with our boys ? ']
DEAR MR. Punch,-Can you give
me any idea as to the probable cost
of setting a youth up in business as
a brigand? My eldest son is about
to leave school, and it is therefore
necessary for me to arrive at an
early decision as to his future. The
ordinary professions, as you are
doubtless aware, are somewhat over-
crowded; and as Thomas HENRY'S
intellect is not unduly robust. I am
anxious to place him in some walk
of life where the competition is not
particularly keen. Under the circum-
stances I have arrived at the con-
clusion that brigandage would be
just the very thing for him, provided
that the initial outlay were not be-
vond my slender means.
The work, so far as I can gather,
is light and pleasant, whilst the
profits appear to be enormous.
THOMAS HENRY himself is simply
delighted with the idea, and declares
his conviction that he was born to be
a brigand, a statement which has the
concurrence of quite a number of my
immediate neighbours. I have always
understood that a natural aptitude
for one's occupation is more than
half the battle, and I feel that my
dear son would quickly find himself
on the high road (probably in a
mountainous district) to success. The

THE HYPNOTIC EYE.
[According to The Daily Telegraph, the burglar with the hypnutic
eye is the latest product of America. At first people scoffed at him as
a fiction of the imagination, Lut Professor MUXSTERBURG of Harvard
and other learned men havo set themselves to show that hypnotic
power may become a most dangerous asset of the criminal.}
John P. Beck of Fortieth Street
Was as smart a burglar as one could meet;
The jemmy and sandbag too he viewed
As hopelessly primitive, coarse and crude :
On one thing only would he rely-
The power of his black hypnotic eye.
Armed with his orb, John P. would dare
To burgle the hall of the millionaire
And pleasantly humour each passing whim
By taking whatever might chance to take him.
But-who is happy in this round ball ?-
At last his triumphs began to pall;
He loathed the monotonous situation
And craved in his soul for a new sensation;
So one dark night, when the policemen found him
With a heap of stolen goods around him,
Instead of making them shrink and quail
He let them carry him off to jail.
Great was the thrill when the news was brought
That John P. Beck had at last been caught.
Never was seen such a crowd before
As hustled around the court-house door.
John P. leant with an easy grace,
Watching the scene with a smile on his face.
Witness One was sworn to the fact
That Beck had been caught in the very act:
“At ten past twelve on Monday night-

Just as the clock struck one-fifteen.
The man was wearing some emerald rings.
I said to him, 'Where did you get those things?
It's very queer
To find you here
With a lot of rubies and pearls and plate
On a Sunday morning at half past eight?'”
The jury stared at the witness. “Mad!
Mad as a hatter !” the thought they had.
Witness Two was called and swore
That Beck was arrested at half-past four :
He caught him himself. The deed was done
Without the aid of Witness One.
He'd known Beck well since he first appeared
With a clean-shaved face and a coal-black beard.
Again the jury opened their eyes
And stared at the man with a wild surmise ;
And each who came through the witnesses' door
Seemed still more mad than the man before.
But further yet was the Court to try
The power of Beck's hypnotic eye,
For when the judge started to sum up the case
The orb was fixed on his learned face.
“The evidence certainly seems,” said he,
“A little conflicting—at least to me.
How BECK was arrested, and why, and when,
I cannot make out from these gentlemen.
If he committed the crime, or crimes,
With which he is charged, at the time, or times,
It is, of course, for the jury to say
That he is guilty. That's clear as day.
But if, again, he never committed
The crime, or crimes, he should be acquitted:

Again, were it proved that another man
Had conceived a base, nefarious plan
To commit the crime, whatever it be,
And throw the suspicion on good John P.,
Should Beck be punished? The jury, I trust, is
Opposed to such a miscarriage of justice.
Suppose such a wretch existed- What?
You say impossible?—Ah, 'tis not.
I know the criminal. Yes, you see
The wretch before you. I am he!
The man who should be in the dock is me!
Arrest me, warders! Step down, John P.!”

Can't beat that as crystallizing de-
scription of PRINCE ARTHUR's atti-
tude on Tariff Reform question.
Once this Session fresh attempt
made to force the wary Leader's
hand. Notice of motion raising the
question was given by a colleague on
Front Bench. Good Tariff Reformers
gleefully rubbed their palms to-
gether.
“Now we've got him,” they
said. “With all his skill and prac-
tice he can't dodge LYTTELTON'S
motion."
After all they didn't know their
Prince ARTHUR. He spoke for an
hour, his voice and manner suggest-
ing that he was consumed by right-
eous indignation about something or
other. What it was exactly his audi-
ence, like little Peterkin's mentor dis-
coursing on another historical con-
Aict, “could not well make out.”
Certainly when he sat down he was
no further committed to Tariff Re-
form than when he rose with assumed
intent finally to declare himself.
Exceedingly clever but nothing
new. Repetition of physical or in-
tellectual feat, however sinart, palls
on repetition. Still there is satisfac-
tion in having once more run the

Au, my brethren, what is life?
That is the question that I came
here to answer-here in this old ram-
bling country house all among the
fens, where a man has table space
for his papers, and ink by the gallon,
and plenty of pens, and all the best
sermons on the shelves.
What is life? I pause for a
reply, or at least I should pause if I
had not backed myself to write this
kind of thing at the rate of ten
thousand words a day for ever and
ever; and to pause and think is fatal.
Easier is it to write on. Life, it has
been wisely remarked, is simpler when
one has friends than it is alone.

thoughts are worth a guinea a pew.
Some philosophers have devoted time
and thought to tracing backwards all
our emotions to their primal origin;
and it is undoubtedly true that in the
intensest and most passionate rela-
tionships of life—the love of a man
for a woman, or a mother for a child
—there is a large admixture of some-
thing physical, instinctive, and
primal. Put in another way, the
discovery of these shrewd and pene-
trating philosophers is that men and
women are huinan after all. How
interesting that is! What a lesson
it teaches.

There was not much more chance
for the players than for the benevo-

as the girl, had the best, and used it
admirably. It was the most difficult
part she has had. Her militant
young “suffragette” in Votes for
Women was more effective, but there
she had the advantage of a direct
model, which makes a vast difference,
as any actor knows; in Joy she had
to express her idea of a high-spirited,
affectionate young thing, and she did
it very well indeed. I was sorry for
the actress who played a parlour-

The sea is unmistakably saline, rising

erosion has been at work in the past,
its operation has been checked by a
stout sea wall, and the citizens of
Understrand possess their souls in
patience, thanks to the town's
spirited defence against the en-
croachments of the marine element.
But what lends such a peculiar
charm to the place is the fact that it
possesses not only a pier and a pro-
menade, but a parish church. From

(Reflections on the recent performances of Keir Hardie in India,
by one who has lived there.)
Poor little soul! Belgravia's iron foe,
Park Lane's destroyer, scourge of Piccadilly;
Alas, that one so very wise should go
And be so silly.
He sought the East; he cast his eyes around;
He saw a crowd; he heard some shrill invective;
He did not think of waiting till he found
The right perspective;
But, firmly buckled to the baboo's tail,
And fed with facts entirely new to history,
Flinging aside the immemorial veil
Of India's mystery,
He solved all problems with his nimble eye;
And now behold him, in the name of Freedom,
Hoisting the banner of his blood-red tie
For Bengalee-dom.
Poor little soul! So lofty, so serene,
So deaf to all the prayers of Might and Mammon;
Alas, that one so great should be so green
When baboos gammon.
Eager to hear his native land attacked,
! And zealous for his raucous baboo brothers,
He has not grasped the interesting fact
That there are others.
India has many races, many creeds,
Who live just now at rest, because they 're made to;
Some go in pleasantly for warlike deeds;
Some are afraid to;
And possibly his friends forgot to state
That with the dawn of “ India as a Nation"
The baboo would become the candidate
For spifflication.
Poor little soul! He ought to take a turn
In regions where the baboos cease from crowing,
Where men are men indeed, and he could learn
A lot worth knowing.
He'd learn of races loyal to a fault,
Men with no use for petty agitators,
Who live in honour, faithful to their salt,
And don't like traitors;
Of soldiers that have been too often led
By Britons to mistake the true position
Of a mere stranger with a swollen head
Vamping sedition;
Who 'd look him over with experienced eyes,
And wait, till someone offered the suggestion,
This-is-no-Sahib : meaning they despise
The man in question.
And then they'd take him sternly by the nape,
And cast him forth, a wiser man and sadder;
Or break his head, and let the gas escape,
Like a pricked bladder.

scenario ofʻthis momentous compo-
sition confidently declared that it
will surpass in monumental gran-
deur . and mellifluous opulence of
local colour even the most sublime
achievements that have yet ema-
nated from the teeming brain of its
phenomenally gifted creator. Mr.
BANTOCK, who is his own librettist,
conceives the hero in the light of a
modern Canterbury pilgrim, uncon-
scious of its doom, gambolling play-
fully on the enamelled pastures until
the very hour of execution. The
soprano solo, “Maori had a little
lamb,” is of bewitching beauty,
while the concluding or cold-storage
section, which is set in the form of
a moto perpetuo lasting fifty min-
utes, is marked by a coruscating
charm unique in the annals of the
meat-market. Throughout the work
there runs, like an idée fixe, a haunt-
ing phrase assigned to a solo cornet,
an instrument whose exquisite bleat-
ing timbre renders it peculiarly suit-
able in this context.

Mr. JOSEF HOLBROOKE has also
signalised the occasion in a manner
eminently calculated to enhance his
high reputation. Taking CHOPIN'S
famous étude on the black notes as
the central theme of his work, he
has woven it into a marvellously
rich and complicated orchestral
tapestry along with a number of
topical melodies, including “ Waltz

To serve my country and my king.

To do its task so swift as I.
What matter though the office brats
Might stigmatise my work as “Rats!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHITECROSS VALE.
This was a run I well remember
On the glorious first of a far November:
A light mist curled in the Autumn air,
And a watery sun gleamed thin and pale;
And all of us rode to our stations where
The covert nestled in Whitecross Vale.
It was “Jack, it's jolly to see you out:
Your health, old fellow! How goes the gout? ”
Or“ DICK, I 'm dashed if it isn't Dick,
And Dick's old flea-bitten, hog-maned grey."
Or“ HARRY, I hope you mean to stick
As tight to the tail of the hounds to-day
As you stuck to the brook and its bank of clay.
Oh, I had to laugh when I saw you paddle,
While your horse went on with an empty saddle.”
In fact we had all the jests and greetings
That mark these first of November meetings.
Now Whitecross covert has earned a name
For holding a fox, and it 's still the same.
There's a queer rough rhyme
Of the ancient time
Which the jolly old farmers shout and sing,
And it goes with a kind of hunting swing:
“Old Noah came to land, sir,
One day in Whitecross Vale;
He'd a pigeon in his hand, sir,
With some salt upon its tail,
And the pigeon told him secrets that day in Whitecross
Vale.
He said, This here 's as pretty
A place as any be:
It isn't near the city;
It isn't near the sea;
It's as good a place for foxes as any place can be.'
So he took them from their boxes,
And he put them in the bog-
A brace of bushy foxes,
A vixen and a dog;
And the trees began to sprout there and cover up the
bog.
They didn't get no thinner,
And reared a family.
They gave them fowls for dinner,
And ducklings for their tea.
And when they both departed they left their family.
So, since the flood declined there,
And Noah went away,
You 're always sure to find there,
And there you 'll find to-day;
And won't he make you gallop when once he breaks
away!”
So much for the Ark--
But hark, hark, hark !
That's Melody's music, well I know.
There 's a hustle and bustle through the bushes
Where the pack in its ardour thrusts and pushes
In Whitecross Vale where the bushes grow.
And now with a forty-power lung,
Listen, the pack is giving tongue.
And, yoick he's out at the farther side 1
He's out, he 's out,
For I heard the shout;
So it 's up with your heart, my son, and ride.
It isn't a mile
To the stiff-built stile.
Gather your horse and lift him over
To land in a field that once was clover.
And, lo, on the slope you see them streaming,
While the thin pale sun through the mist is gleaming
Here and there on the scarlet coats,
And the music floats
From the hounds' full throats
In a rattling chorus of joyous notes.
Lightly over the post and rails,
You and a dozen,-no one fails.
And see how a lady holds the lead
On a thoroughbred built for a turn of speed.
She's made for the horse, and he for her,
And there 's never a touch of crop or spur.
An airy figure she sails along,
Ahead of the red-coat riding throng.
Steady, oh, steady, through the plough,
Over the bank and ditch; and now
There's a stretch of grass with a hedge that bounds it;
But you clear the fence,
Though it's high and dense;
And fast and faster
You follow the Master
As he lifts his beckoning horn and sounds it.
There's mud on the back
Of Dick, and JACK
Has managed to crumple a brand-new hat:
It had once been high, but he wears it flat.
And it's bellows to mend for more than one
Who lag in the rear of the mighty run.
But the trim-built lady is still in front
Of the eager, galloping, panting hunt.
Sixty minutes we rode and more,
And at last in the sight of a bare half-score,
The wreck of the host who had met together
In Whitecross Vale in the misty weather,
At the foot of a hill his force was spent,
And the hounds were on him and down he went.

Mr HENRY FITTER thought that
a mummified sheep's heart in a gold
casket would be tasteful.
Mr. J. G. BUTCHER, K.C., in an
eloquent speech, suggested that an
illuminated address should be pre-
sented to Mr. HEWLETT, conferring
on him the honorary title of “ Carni-
fex Maximus.".
Mr. THOMAS FITTER, whose re-
marks were imperfectly heard, was
understood to say that he opposed
any testimonial to Mr. HEWLETT, on
the ground that in his novel the
butcher was placed in the pillory and
shot. In these circumstances the
rôle of hero was a barren honour.
The Mayor of Canterbury having
cleared up the misapprehension of
the last speaker by reading a passage
from the final chapter of Mr. Hew-
Lett's novel, the various suggestions
were voted upon, with the result that
Mr. HENRY FITTER's proposal was
practically carried unanimously. It
was further decided that the task of
composing a suitable inscription for
the casket should be entrusted to a
sub-committee, consisting of Mr.
JOHN FITTER, Sir JAMES Crichton-
BROWNE and Mr. WALTER SLAUGHTER.

“DIGNIFIED AND SIMPLE;" OR, "SUPER"-KINGS IN THE CITY. NOVEMBER 9.
Describing his connection with the coming Lord Mayor's Show, in an interview with The Evening Standard, Mr. Louis N. PARKER, the “Master-Pageant-Maker," says he is “ beginning
to fear lest people should expect too much .... The first thing necessary was that it should be diguified and simple .... We have got the men. I asked for amateurs . ... The men
will be natural. They are kings riding through their city ; they may talk, wave their hats or their hands to the crowd, kiss their fingers, do almost anything, and uithout risk of appearing

MR. CHARLES MANNERS contributed
a luminous and pathetic letter to
the Sunday Times of November 3,
pointing out what incalculable bene-

the L.C.C. steamboats had been de-
voted to Grand Opera in English.
Various gentlemen, while support-
ing Mr. CHARLES MANNERS's view
that the money spent on the Thames
steamboats has been wasted, differ
widely as to the way in which it
ought to have been laid out.
Mr. WiLLIAM ARCHER is of the
opinion that had the steamboat
money been available for the support
of a Free Theatre, it would enable
the promoters of that scheme to re-

As the greater includes the less so
the TETRAZZINI boom threatens to
eclipse and obliterate all other topics
and personalities in the musical
world. Only a little ago musical
critics confidently pronounced the
reign of the Italian prima donna to
be as dead as a door-nail. In view
of the distressing news that reaches
us from different quarters it becomes
imperatively necessary for these
hasty and prejudiced writers to revise
their partial and ill-founded verdict.

His addiction to agriculture was
hitherto regarded merely in the light
of a parergon, but now, in view of
the revived cult of the prima donna,
it has become an absorbing obsession,
even involving the neglect of his
chevelure. M. PACHMANN, as is well
known, is engaged on an exhaustive
treatise on the Marmoset, which it
may be necessary to remind some

Nov. 11.-Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL
to-day visited Mount Moru, where he
had an appointment with the friendly
vulture whose assistance was so
timely some years ago in connection
with the Rt. Hon. gentleman's

SZON
Under-Secretary and the bird were
closeted together in a cranny among

were bagged.
Nov. 12.–Mr. Winston CHURCHILL
to-day visited Port Elgin, when he
had an interview with the chiefs of
the Salibi, who were accompanied by
4,000 Hookiwalka. Mr. CHURCHILL
expressed his pleasure at seeing
them, and trusted they were all
Liberals and Free Traders. Before
returning to Georobi he promised
them the earth. Much to Mr.

MAY AND DECEMBER.
Wuen over the hill the cowslips came,
And the daffodils dotted the grass with flame,
And the duplicate notes rang cool and clear,
As the cuckoo called to the waking year;
And when, as the dusk climbed down the sky,
And the little stars blinked a bright good-bye
To the rim of the sun who had made them pale,
Out bubbled the song of the nightingale;
The cherry-tree out in the garden there,
She felt the reproach of her branches bare,
And, all in a moment shining bright,
Was robed and veiled in her bridal white.
The swallow skimmed by the river's edge,
And the blackbird bustled from hedge to hedge;
· And, oh, but the thrush was blithe and gay,
For this was the beautiful month of May.
But little it boots to remember this,
The dear green day of delight and bliss,
For now in a drip of dismal rain
The year draws on to its end again.

THE HORNPIPE.
I don't know who was the one to plan it,
But fair-haired POLLY
And brown-haired Mollie,
They shrieked with delight and then began it;
And I was admitted a little later
(Sworn to the secret on bell and book
Before I was ever allowed to look)
To sit where I liked as a free spectator.
The one was eight and the other six,
And both were up to no end of tricks.
Their eyes were glancing,
Their eyes were dancing,
Before their feet
Had moved to the beat
Of the piano that soon was to set them prancing.
In and out
And round about
They swung and swayed
As the music played.
You could fancy you heard the stormy sea,
As the spray saluted each bold A.B.,
And the clapping hands of the jolly tars
Released from the work of sails and spars,
And their cheers and songs and their briny wit,
As their two little messmates footed it.
And soon, as the merry notes were jigging,
They set to work and went up the rigging.
In a short sharp climb-
But they kept the time-
They gripped the ropes with their sturdy knees,
And climbed like cats to the high cross-trees;
And then with never a moment's check
They landed, stamp, on the sounding deck.
Oh, I doubt if the tale would be believed
Of the ropes they hauled and the leads they heaved,
Of the feet they crossed,
And the hair they tossed,
And the capturing wiles
And the sunny smiles
Of this trippety-rippety sailor-pair
As they twinkled through with their hornpipe there.
Till at last, when I thought they must have dropped, :
With a rapturous final stamp they stopped.
R. C. L.
A moment or two they stood, and then
They folded their arms like sailor-men.
Their cheeks were glowing, their eyes were wide,
And they cocked their two little heads aside,
As sailors have done from age to age,
At least all sailors who tread the stage.
Then the music sounded,
And Polly bounded;
And MOLL, with a ringing peal of laughter,
She started in and went bounding after.

And loaded it only for you and me.”.
But the King, he shook his sceptre,
Now the Bugler-Elf was a queer old fellow,
And he kept her-yes, he kept her
Good at a grumble,
To do his lieges honour and to listen to their cheers,
And never humble,
With her bodyguard to back her of the Elfin
His cap was red and his cloak was yellow,
Grenadiers.
And the emerald tunic he looked so fat in
When all were gathered the Christmas-tree
Was tastefully slashed with ruby satin.
Was lit by the King himself;
His shoes were green and his hose were white,
It was loaded all over heavily
And everything seemed a trifle tight.
With presents for every Elf.
There were cakes and buns
His bugle hung
For the tiny ones;
By his side and swung;
And dolls in prams and mechanical toys
And he took it,
For all the gossamer girls and boys;
And eyed it,
And jewels rare
And shook it,
For the Elfin fair;
And tried it,
And a pencil-case, or a fountain-pen,
And then, and then
Or a walking-stick for the Elfin men.
He tried it again,
Everybody looked mighty pleasant,
And, puffing his purple cheeks, at last
For nobody failed to get a present.
He set to work and he blew his blast.
And next the hall was cleared for dancers,
Oh, but it rang,
And they all dashed in for the kitchen-lancers;
And sweetly sang,
They waltzed and they polked-but some sat out-
And joyously welled
And supped, and then with a loyal shout
From the source of sound;
Took leave of their King, who still looked hearty,
And pierced and shivered the walls of night
And so went home from their Christmas party.
Till it tumbled back from the hard-won height.

And then it rose, it rose, it rose,

And ever louder, clearer, shriller blew,
Till on one last long note it faded to its close.
When you eat Nublets you lose your taste for all other
foods!
“ Bravo!” said the King.“ Well done, my boy!"
Then you lose your taste for Nublets!
But the bugler wasn't the one for joy;
THINK OF THE Saving!
He dropped his jubilant bugle down,

And looked at the King with a fearful frown.
“My throat," he observed, “is parched and tickly;

THEN the fine morning came at last, Mr. PUNCH whistled to Topy, and set forth to view his kingdom. Much of it
was under water ; but, keeping as far as possible to the dry portions, the Sage walked along briskly, and as he
walked his thoughts wandered over the events of the past half-year.
“And what strikes me most," he said to Toby, “is the number of anomalies which have revealed themselves of late
| to the student of affairs."
TOBY, doubtful of the meaning of the word "anomalies,” barked a query.
“For instance,” explained MR. PUNCII, “cattle-driving, which must from all accounts be a delightful sport, is
(apparently) legal in Ireland; and yet the Englishman, the Welshman, and the Scotsman have this recreation absolutely
denied to them. The Suffragist, taking occasion by the land, explains (doubtless with warrant) that she is not subject to
the man-made laws of a man-made magistrate; yet, when burglars break into her house, she will not hesitate to call in the
man-made policeman. Nay, she will even supplicate his stalwart arm to enable her to cross the road safely. The Socialist,
again, talks with eloquence of the rights of the working man; but for some reason appears to make a distinction between
the man who works with his hands and the man who works with his brain. The latter is allowed no grievance. You
never, for instance, hear a Socialist stand up for the Editor of The Times against that bloated capitalist the Proprietor.”
The bitterness of this last reflection filled the Sage's mind for a while. TOBY, too, seemed affected by the sadness of it.
“Yes,” said Mr. Punch at last, “what we want is men who can see life steadily and see it whole-men who will
think clearly, who look onwards and upwards toward—-"
At this moment, as if in answer to the Sage's wish, two men appeared. One of them, if not looking onwards, was
certainly looking upwards; he seemed, indeed, as if he could not look anywhere else. The other, it was equally clear,
was thinking deeply. His left hand beat the air as if in time to his thoughts.
"The men themselves," said Mr. Punch, eagerly. “Their faces, indeed, seem to lack intellect, but doubtless this
is only a form of our national impassivity.”
At the sound of a voice the two strangers halted. The Thinker stopped beating time, and the Watcher, with a
great effort, brought his head down to the ordinary level. They both looked at Mr. PUNCH.
“The very man,” they said together. “He shall decide.”
“Gentlemen,” said MR. PUNCH, with a bow, “I am very much at your service. What have I to decide ?"
“Between us,” said the Thinker. “Upon the scroll of fame which of us has the right to the premier place ?"
“But I must first know something about you. You, I take it,” he said to the Thinker, "are a philosopher, quietly
at work in your study upon problems which may change profoundly the whole current of the world's thought. You," he

said to the other, "are no doubt a statesman. With your hand upon the helm you will guide the national barque into
safe waters. Now, between Philosophy and Statesmanship--
“Excuse me," said the Thinker, Laughtily, "I am the All England Limerick Champion."
“I,” said the Watcher disdainfully, " am the World's Diabolo Champion."
Mr. Punch coughed to bide his confusion.
“I-I beg your pardon,” he said. “Of course, of course. TOBY, we had better go home."
“I don't want to boast," said the Watcher, “but facts are facts. I have caught it over ten thousand times
consecutively. As a feat of endurance alone -_-"
"Talking about feet of endurance, what about these? “He was green, but he took it as read.' Red, the colour,
you know. Now that line will live. Taking each word as a foot, which is much the simplest way, you have nine feet of
endurance. Rather good joke that-eh? I shouldn't wonder if you were to see it in my next.”
“I have done it one hundred times in the minute," said the Watcher.
"I have earned one hundred pounds in a minute," said the other triumphantly. "And, after all, money's
the thing."
"I could almost play in my sleep-~".
“Well, I simply think in rhyme now, when I'm doing a last line. Rhyme, line-why, there's another one."
“I can do it with one band,” said the Watcher.
“I always do it with one hand,” said the Thinker with a grin...
“If you think that's funny_-"
“Of course you couldn't be expected to see a joke."
“Gentlemen, gentlemen," said Mr. PUNCII,“ please remember that I am the arbitrator."
“ Well?”
“Well,” said the Sage cautiously, "there is an ideal state which we all strive to reach-Mens sana in corpore sano;
but if we cannot have both it is something to have one. Now, I think that even this gentleman's game might tend to
produce the corpus sanum so much to be desired; and no doubt, in the other gentleman's pastime may be observed
traces of that mens sana without which---"
"It's mens insana," said the Watcher, who knew that much Latin.
The Thinker started angrily. MR. Punch hastily intervened.
“One moment,” he said. “I was about to add that if you both wished for that healthy mind which of itself
creates a healthy body--
"I do,” said the Watcher eagerly. “You know, I read more than that chap thinks. I've finished MARCEL's Hou
to play Diabolo, and ”
"As a matter of fact,” said the Thinker, "since I took to filling in postal orders my right wrist has developed a
suppleness inferior only to that of RANJITSINHJI's.".
"Excellent," said Mr. Punch. "I have the very thing for you both.” And without more ado he presented to the
rivals, thus reconciling their differences, a splendid gift in common. It was no other than hiss

Punch's Almanack for 1908.

Real Burglar (to guest, who has been told“ not to mind any noise he may hear in the night, as it will only be the boys playing a practical
joke"). “NAH THEN, WHERE'S YER MONEY?”.
Guest. “Now, LOOK HERE, YOUNG SIR. YOU THINK YOURSELF VERY FUNNY, DON'T YOU ? But I SHALL CERTAINLY TELL YOUR FATHER IN
THE MORNING !”
TO A FORTUNATE BABE,
TO WHOM, HOWEVER, ONE GREAT GIFT HAS BEEN DENIED.
INFANT, whose orbs—the blue of bluest china, Her captious father clumsily collided
Scan with a like dispassionate regard
With our arrangements, castled high in air ;
Your toys, your Christmas-tree, your dolly Dinah, Without consulting me, the brute decided
And me, the motley bard;
That I must woo elsewhere.
Little you dream (nor could it be expected
I thought to drown myself, but Heaven stayed me,

Twenty-five years ago, when I was younger,
My lady did the like, but hers was broken;
And wore a figure less maturely blown,

And you are here to-day, a living token
That gnawed me to the bone.
Of Granny's fractured vow. .
She was a girl of more than common merit;
Infant, I blame you not at all, nor grudge it,
When I would jest she smiled from ear to ear;
Though fair the gale that on your future blows,

You might have counted me among your Grandads-
Deftly reciprocated my advances ;

Th' unerring wildfowl make
A bee-line to the lake;
As the dry mule,
Freed from his toilsome pack,

The nearest pool;

From far and near;

Long days of quivering heat
And brassy skies,

A skating-rink for those

Only to this gay spot
They come, and falter not;
Such is my yearly lot,
My summer woe;
Their everlasting buzz

And being tickled does
Annoy me so.
