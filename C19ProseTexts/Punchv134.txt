TO ENGLAND IN 1908.
Dedicated to the author of “Forty Singing Seamen,” by one of them.
[The following verses are modelled on the metrical scheme of a poem
appearing in Mr. ALFREd Noyes's new volume (BLAckwood) and entitled
“To England in 1907; a Prayer that she might speak for Peace.” For
those who have never read this fine outburst of optimism, a brief quota-
tion may serve to illustrate Mr. Noyes's motive and method.
The poor and weak uplift their manacled hands
To thee, our Mother, our Lady and Queen of lands:
Anguished in prayer before thy footstool stands
Peace, with her white wings glimmering o'er the sea,
Others may shrink whose naked frontiers face
A million foemen of an alien race;
But thou, Imperial, by thy pride of place
O, canst thou falter or fear to set them free?
*:: º º º & º
Speak, speak and act! The sceptre is in thy hand;
Proclaim the reign of love from land to land;
Then come the world against thee, thou shalt stand'
Speak, with the world-wide voice of thine own sea.]
Now, England, stretch the dismal pall above
The dead year's hopes of universal love;
While to her ark returns the futile dove
Disconsolate o'er the grey diluvial sea.
This was that year of Conference at the Hague,
And the results I find extremely vague;
Rumours of War still raven like the plague,
And still Bellona goes it strong and free.
I bade you speak for Peace, and speak you did,
Trying your best to do as you were bid—
Waste words, as when a cuttle-fish (or squid)
Mottles with squirted ink the indifferent sea.
Did you not promise in the open Press
To build no fewer than one ship the less
If they, the Powers, would sign a joint address
Making the entrance to Millennium free?
None with a like authority could speak.
You are an island : you are thus unique;
Safe as a cert behind your narrow streak
Consisting, all the way, of sundering sea.
Some folk have frontiers—always such a bore;
It means a slavish lust for local gore;
But you, with Ocean's barrier round your shore,
Imbibed at birth the trick of being free.
By land, as on the brine, you take the lead;
Your patriot heirs are bred of manhood's breed,
Each one (per cent.) prepared to die at need
Rather than lose his lien upon the sea.
Yet, England, what availed your wistful cry?
Judge, if you please, by Germany's mute reply:
She lays her keels regardless—we know why:-
To jump our claim to set the nations free.
And shall we hear that menacing voice dictate
Liberty's terms within our seaward gate?
Let nineteen-seven go! Here's nineteen-eight!
We 'll teach them who 's entitled to the sea
You, as I said before (and say again,
For fear the rest should fail to read it plain),
Have the sole right, as Mistress of the main,
Will they or mill, to say they shall be free.
Enough of words. Build Dreadnoughts two to one;
And let your children, every mother's son,
Shoulder the rifle, prime the rakish gun,
And fling this shattering challenge o'er the sea: –
“'Tis ours to stamp the world with Freedom's brand 1
Love us, or we will blow you out of hand
Into the Ewigkeit. So understand,
We mean, this way or that, to make you free
| " '
Thus shall the reign of Peace be shortly due,
Based on a general funk, superbly blue,
Or else because there 's no one left but you
Upon an otherwise unpeopled sea. O.
S.
THE TREE.
I HAVE not written much lately. We have all been
busy getting ready for Christmas, buying presents for
people, and keeping the secret, and wondering who 's
going to send us presents and what they 'll be like,
and doing up the house in holly and misletoe. We
hung a bit of misletoe to the chandelier in the hall, and
I went to Mrs. AUSTIN and told her somebody wanted
to see her—somebody she knew very well, but I wasn't
to mention his name. She said she must make herself
tidy, but I told her he couldn't wait more than half
a minute and she must come at once. So she came,
and when I got her under the misletoe I took a good
jump at her and gave her a kiss, a regular smacker.
She couldn't make it out, but I told her to look up,
and then she knew. She said she never did see such
a owdacious young spark in all her born days, but she
didn't mind really. I tried Miss WiLLs next. I got her
under a picture on which we 'd stuck some misletoe, and
then I got on a chair and tried to kiss her, but I missed
her face and it landed on her shoulder. She didn't
mind either. NINA said if JIM tried to kiss her she
would plunge a stiletto in his something heart. I think
the word was recarrent, or something like that. I hadn't
heard it before, and when I asked NINA she said she
wasn't quite sure how it was spelt. She said she had
once heard it in a theatre. The man who had that
heart, she said, was a villain.
But the best joke we had was the Christmas-tree for
everybody—for us and the servants and all. It was to
be at half-past four, and we were all to have tea together
in the dining-room afterwards. The tree was in the
school-room upstairs. We 'd covered it all over with
presents, and there were a lot more laid on the floor
under it and on the earth round about. It was in
a box. There were candles all the way up it, and strings
of silvery balls, and all the things they put on Christmas-
trees. NINA was the Spirit of the Season. She was a
real fairy this time, and no mistake. She had a muslin
dress and a pair of wings, and a wand done up in silver
paper. First the servants all came in. There was
Mrs. AUSTIN, and ELIZA the parlourmail, and JANE
the housemaid, and ETHEL the kitchenmaid, and ToM
the boy who does the boots and knives. MAC BEAN, the
gardener, came with his little girl ICMILY, and JIM came
from the stables. Mum was there, too, and Uncle Dick
and Aunt MARGERY. They were spending Christmas
with us. All the servants sat round the wall on chairs
and never said a word. They were all dressed in their
Sunday best and looked very uncomfortable, especially
MAC BEAN and JIM. JIM had got on a black coat and
very tight trousers, and a stiff collar and a red tie with
a great big horse-shoe pin stuck in it. He didn't seem
to have any of his jokes left. He didn't laugh at al.

RURAL INDEPENDENCE.
Vicar. “A HAPPY NEw YEAR to You, GILES.”
Giles. “RIGHT O !”
when I asked him if he fancied the looks of any of these
fillies. That's the way JIM speaks in the stable, but
when I said it to him in the school-room he only wiped
his mouth with the back of his hand and said nothing.
When he sat down I thought his trousers were going to
crack, but I'm sorry to say they didn't.
Well, they all sat there as glum as possible, and every
now and then Mum said a word to one of them and the
whispered something back. Mrs. AUSTIN was in blac
silk, and she looked hotter than ever. First NINA came
in and she danced round the room, and then she stopped
in front of the tree and said a bit of poetry. She said
it was a glad season and everybody was joyful. Happi-
ness was spread all over the earth, and the people in it
were having heaps of mirth. She said she could hear
the sounds of rejoicing and laughter, and she told them
now was the time to throw care away and join in revelry
on this festal day. It was something like that, and
she did it very well, but they all sat there quite silent
till Uncle Dick said, “Bravo, little 'un,” and then
they began to clap their hands and whisper to one
another. Then NINA went and sat on Mum's lap, and
there was a loud knock at the door. I knew who it was
and dashed to open it, and in came Santa Claus—Dad,
of course, but I didn't tell the rest. He thought I
didn't know him, but I recognised his eyes, and I saw
his own moustache under the white one. Besides, I'd
heard him talking about it with Mum. He'd got on his
brown dressing-gown, with cottonwool on it for snow,
and a long white beard and a red cap with holly on it,
and he really did look rather old and jolly. The servants
laughed a bit when he came in, but it didn't last long.
Dad came up to the tree and said in a funny voice—
“What scene of riotous revelry is this? Do I, indeed,
behold my old friend, MAcBEAN ?” Everybody looked
at MACBEAN, and MACBEAN looked as if he didn't see
anything. Then Dad went on :-‘‘I have a gift for
MAcBEAN,” and he gave him the wrong parcel, which
was a little doll in a bath meant for EMILY ; but it didn’t
matter. Dad went on talking and giving away presents
off the tree, mostly wrong, and at last he shouted out,
“Do my eyes deceive me? No, they do not. It is, it
is Mrs. AUSTIN. Say, fair one, shall we tread a stately
measure together?” Then he pranced up to Mrs.
AUSTIN and got her off her chair and did a dance with
her. This set them all off. JANE and Eliza simply
screamed with laughter, and JIM got hold of ETHEL and
MACBEAN took NINA, and when Dad and Mrs. AUSTIN
tripped up and fell down, I never saw anything like it.
It was ripping. Afterwards, when Dad and Mum and
Uncle Dick and Aunt MARGERY went away, we all went
to the dining-room and had the most gorgeous tea, and
they all talked away and kept laughing like mad. JIM
was the worst of the lot, but he never tried to kiss NINA.
He kissed everybody else, and they all slapped his face.
It was a very jolly evening. R. C. L.

[JANUARY 1, 1908.
THE KNIGHT OF THE
CHIMNEY-PIECE.
WE don't know his real name, but
we have decided to call him ARTHUR.
(“Sir ARTHUR,” I suppose he would
be.) He stands in bronze upon the
chimney-piece, and in his right hand
is a javelin; this makes him a very
dangerous person. Opposite him, but
behind the clock (Coward 1), stands
the other fellow, similarly armed.
Most people imagine that the two
are fighting for the hand of the lady
on the clock, and they aver that they
can hear her heart beating with the
excitement of it; but as a matter of
fact the other fellow doesn't conje
into the story at all. Only MARGERY
and I know the true story. I think I
told it to her one night when she
wouldn't go to sleep—or perhaps she
told it to me.
The best of this tale (I say it as
the possible author) is that it is
modern. It were easy to have in-
vented something more in keeping
with the knight's armour, but we had
to remember that this
this twentieth century was Sir
ARTHUR on the chimney-piece, with
| his javelin drawn back. For whom
is he waiting?
“It all began,” I said, “a year
ago, when Sir ARTHUR became a
member of the South African Char-
tered Incorporated Co - operative
Stores Society Limited Ten per cents
at Par (Men only). He wasn't ex-
actly a real member, having been
elected under Itule Two for meritori-
ous performances, Rule One being
that this club shall be called what I
said just now ; but for nearly a year
he enjoyed all the privileges of mem-
bership, including those of paying a
large entrance fee and a still larger
subscription. At the end of a year,
however, a dreadful thing happened.
They made a Third Rule: to wit, that
no member should go to sleep on the
billiard table.
“Of course, Sir ARTHUR, having
only got in under IRule Two, had to
resign. He had, as I have said,
paid his entrance fee, and (as it hap-
pened) his second year's subscription
in advance. Naturally he was
annoyed . . . .
“And that, in fact, is why he
stands on the chimney-piece with his
javelin drawn back. He is waiting
for the Secretary. Sir ARTHUR is
considered to be a good shot, and the
Secretary wants all the flowers to
be white.’’
At this point MARGERY said her
best word, “Gorky,” which means
was the
twentieth century, and that here in!
“A thousand thanks for the verisimi-
litude of your charming and interest-
ing story, but is not the love element
a trifle weak 2'' (MARGERY is a true
woman.)
“We must leave something to the
imagination,” I pleaded. “The Sec-
retary no doubt had a delightful
niece, and Sir ARTHUR's hopeless
passion for her, after he had hit her
uncle in a vital spot, would be the
basis of a most powerful situation.”
MARGERY said “Gorky '' again,
which, as I have explained, means,
“Are such distressing situations
within the province of the Highest
Art 2 ''
When MARGERY says “Gorky"
twice in one night, it is useless to
argue. I gave in at once. “Butter,” I
said, “placed upon the haft of the
javelin, would make it slip, and put
him off his shot. He would miss the
Secretary and marry the niece.” So
we put a good deal of butter on Sir
ARTHUR, and for the moment the
Secretary is safe. I don't know if
we shall be able to keep it there;
but jam does as well, and MARGERY
has promised to stroke him every
day.
However, I anticipate. As soon
as the secretarial life was saved,
MARGERY said “Agga,” which is, as
it were, “Encore 1 '' or “Bisſ '' so
that I have her permission to tell you
that story all over again. Indeed, I
should feel quite justified in doing so.
Instead I will give you the tragedy
of GEORGE, the other fellow (no
knight he), as she told it to me after-
wards. -
“GEORGE was quite a different
man from Sir ARTILUR. So far from
being elected to anything under
Rule Two, he got blackballed for
the St. John's Wood Toilet Club.
Opinions differed as to why this
happened ; some said that it was his
personal unpopularity (he had pre-
viously been up, without success, for
membership of the local Ratepayers
Association); others (among them the
Proprietor), that his hair grew too
quickly. Anyhow, it was a great
shock to GEORGE, and they had to
have a man in to break it to him.
(It's always the way when you have
a man in.)
“GEORGE was siricken to the
heart. This last blow was too much
for what had always been a proud
nature. He decided to emigrate.
Accordingly he left home, and moved
to Kilburn. Whether he is still there
or not I cannot say; but a card with
that postmark reached his niece only
this week. It was unsigned, and
bore on the space reserved for inland
communications these words: The
old old wish—A Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year.”
“But what about the javelin?” I
asked MARGERY. (This fellow had a
javelin too, you remember.)
“Gorky,” said MARGERY for the
third time, which means
Well, upon my word, I don't know
what it means. But it would explain
it all.
Meanwhile Sir ARTHUR (he was in
my story, you know) is still waiting
for the Secretary. In case the butter
gives out, have I mentioned that the
Secretary wants all the flowers to be
white? A. A. M.
MUSICAL NOTES.
MADAME TETRAzzini's last message
to the British people has, we under-
stand, created a profound impres-
sion on the Cabinet, and her spirited
advocacy of Old Age Pensions has
greatly encouraged Mr. Asquith.
On the subject of Tariff Reform her
guarded utterances have disappointed
the Editor of the National Review,
who has indeed gone so far as to
describe her as a candidate for the
fiscal Mandarinate; but, on the
other hand, the followers of Mr.
BALFour hail her as a welcome re-
cruit. It is reassuring to hear that
there is no foundation for the
rumour which attributed to her the
intention of standing for the Presi-
dency of the United States.
Madame TETRAzzINI's gigantic and
pyramidal success has, not unnatu-
rally, set the tide once more flowing
strongly in the direction of Italianised
nomenclature, and in the course of
the next year quite a number of
well-known artists have decided to
make a fresh start under new and pic-
turesque aliases. Prominent amongst
these are Madame CLARA ToNNELLATA
and Signor BizzARROGUADo, Signor
ENRico Uccello, and Signor PLUN-
CHETTo VERDI, who must not be con-
fused with his namesake Signor CHEN-
sALE VERDI, the characteristic name
adopted by Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton.
An interesting correspondence,
arising out of the recent publication
of Professor METCHNIkoff's epoch-
making treatise on “The Prolonga-
tion of Life,” has lately been ap-
pearing in a Bessarabian contem-
porary. Discussion having arisen as
to what calling was most conducive
to longevity there has been an almost
universal consensus of expert opinion
in favour of Italian opera chorus
singers. It is believed that at this
moment there are several singers still
alive who took part in the first per-

formance of Don Giovanni, and it is
on record that on one occasion, at a
gala performance at the Paris Grand
Opera, NApoleon, pointing to the
chorus, observed to Josephine that
twenty centuries looked up at them
from the stage.
The valuable services rendered by
the “BALFour Political Choir '' at
Coatbridge, on the occasion of a
recent Unionist demonstration ad-
dressed by Mr. ALFRED LYTTELTON,
remind one that several other similar
institutions are in existence. Pro-
minent amongst them are the “BIR-
RELL Anti-Coercion Choral Society,”
which makes a specialty of the
“Ranz des Vaches '' and “O
GINNELL go and call the Cattle

A fresh evidence to the popularity
of Sir Edward ELGAR is forthcoming

cles his famous melody is now in-
variably sung to the words “Band

THE Admiralty has decided to
carry out a series of tests of modern
magazines on the old battleship
Colossus. The favourite at present
is The Pall Mall Magazine, owing to
the fact that it is publishing Mr.
H. G. WELLs’s “The War in the
Air.”

The most wonderful metamorphosis
of recent times is about to take
place. The War Office in Pall Mall
is to be converted into a club-house
for Automobilists—the apostles of
speed. -

“The Berlin' Board of Education,
by making the study of English com-
pulsory in all its higher schools, has,”
says the Berliner Tageblatt, “laid one
of the strongest corner-stones of the
temple of universal peace.” There
is no doubt that all those persons who
study our language end by respecting
a nation of which every member can
speak it more or less fluently.

“Dr. HENRY CowARD,” says The
Glasgow Herald, “has been appointed
conductor of the Glasgow Choral
Union, in succession to Mr. Joseph

But why take all this trouble?
Surely he could conduct the Sydney
Society just as well from Glasgow as
from New Zealand.

A correspondent writes to The
Times to complain of the number of

the perpetrators of which have been

now arrived when murderers should

Dr. Edward WESTERMARCK, in an

THE APPEAL REASONABLE

DEAR SANTA CLAUs, I am a little
girl named MARION Dolby. My
father is a barrister, and my mother is
very pretty, and lived at Chislehurst
before her wedding. I have three
brothers and two sisters. My
brothers are named GUY, JACK and
PATRICK. My sisters are named Eva
and MARGUERITE. I am twelve, and
the oldest of the lot. PATRICK is the
youngest—he is five. It is because
I am the eldest that I am writing to
you, because the eldest always has to
do things; but as a matter of fact I
don't mind doing it at all, because
the others write so badly, and Eva
can't even spell Teusday right. It
was decided in our own particular
attic, which we share with a hot-
water cistern, yesterday that I should
write to you in the hope that during
the new year 1908, when I shall be
thirteen, you will try to think of
some plan to prevent us getting as
many of the same presents. This

0UR DEGLINING DRAMA-AND HOW TO RESTORE IT.
(A Paper which will sor be read before the Stage Society)
THERE is no doubt about the decline. We hear com-
plaints from all quarters of a disastrous. Theatrical
season. Serious, well-constructed, and thoughtfully
written plays, after delusively enthusiastic first-nights
and sympathetic encouragement from the Press, expire
in a fortnight or three weeks, amidst tepid applause
from houses principally composed of “paper.” And
Dramatists and Managers can't imagine what it is the
Public do want. It may be presumptuous, but I am
going to attempt to enlighten them. I, may even
succeed in showing them how such calamities may be
avoided in the future. It seems to me that Managers
do not sufficiently realise the change that has taken
place of recent years in the habits and tastes of the
community. Some of them do, no doubt, but the
majority do not. Take the hour at which they begin
their performances, for instance. Some plays begin
as early as nine, or even at eight-thirty, and the
audience are actually requested to be in their seats
before the curtain rises on the first Act |
That means dining at half-past seven, and hurrying
over dinner at that. Now really, it is all very well for
actors and actresses to dine at unholy and unfashion-
able hours—it is a penalty attaching to their profession—
but they can hardly expect any really smart audience
to make a similar sacrifice to art—or, if they do, the
result is apt to be disappointing.
Now I have a suggestion which would, I venture to
say, dispose of the whole difficulty in the simplest
fashion. This is my solution. Provide every West
End theatre that does not possess one already with a
first-class restaurant, and (this is where the novelty
comes in) enable theatre parties to dine luxuriously and
at leisure in the auditorium itself, and during the per-
formance. I don't claim absolute novelty for this idea.
On the Continent the floor and balcony of Variety
Theatres are often provided, as everybody is aware, with
little tables, at which the audience sit and enjoy beer and
sausages. Beer and sausages of course would scarcely
attract the Stalls and Dress Circle over here. A London
Manager would have to do his Public better than that,
but, provided that he engages a chef with a Parisian
reputation, and that his charges are unconscionable
enough to be chic, he need not be in the least appre-
hensive as to the reception of his play. That will be
sure of a run, whatever its intrinsic merits. Indeed, the
less it distracted the attention of the diners, the better
would be its prospects of remaining in the bill. For
the fact is, Dramatists as a class have been getting too
much ahead of their audiences of late. They have
grown, if they will pardon my saying so, too artistic and
intellectual for the General Public. Which is why the
General Public goes to music-halls instead. Let me
explain. Would a modern Dramatist open his play
nowadays with a dialogue between two domestics ex-
plaining the general situation? He would rather die
than be guilty of such a solecism. The critics would
be down on him at once. The consequence is that
the unfortunate audience has to make everything out
for themselves, and only the Pit and Gallery, who have
dined early and done digesting, are in a favourable
position for doing so; and even they require the support

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
of continuous chocolates. Soliloquies and asides, too:
when a character indulged in them, you knew at once
what he or she was driving at, you had a key to the
motive. But soliloquies and asides are alike forbidden
now, so you have to guess the kind of people the
characters really are, which is frequently almost im-
ssible.
Admitting that this mental strain is desirable in an
entertainment at all, it would at least be alleviated by
the simultaneous enjoyment of a really recherché little
dinner, followed, naturally, by a cigar or cigarette. The
more enlightened Managers are already willing to permit
smoking during a performance, if the audience so desire;
but this is a half-measure which I fear will not attract
the class of patrons most worth winning.
Only allow your gourmet to finish his cigar on the
spot where he 3. originally dined—which (according to
my proposal) will be the space now occupied by the
stalls—and he may regain a taste for the Drama. I do
not promise that he will applaud, unless the curtain
can be timed to descend between the courses, but he
will certainly come again if the menu and the wines
prove up to the mark.
And there is another advantage about this suggestion
of mine. It will deprive the Dramatist of one of his
greatest grievances. At present, as he frequently
laments, he is compelled to unravel a complicated plot
in the brief space of two hours or two and a i. at most.
Under my proposed arrangement he could begin, say, at
8.15, and go on till a quarter past twelve, without in-
conveniencing anybody, since the majority of the
audience would probably remain to sup in the theatre,
instead of adjourning to a restaurant, as at present. I
should not advise him to drop his final curtain later
than 12.15 (or 11.45 on Saturdays), because, of course,
the lights would have to be lowered a quarter of an
hour before closing time, while the bills were being pre-
sented and paid. But a good many social problems
could be thrashed out on the stage in less than four
hours without , boring any audience—I mean, if my
system were adopted.
Well, if Managers can't see their way to adopting
that, I have another as good, perhaps even better:
Everybody must have observed one increasing tendency
of the age we live in—its strong desire to turn even its
pleasures to some pecuniary advantage. The present
Public is an educated Public; it loves to employ its
intellect in arithmetical calculations, in literary com-
petitions. But its thirst for mental improvement does
require stimulating by, at all events, the possibility of a
prize in hard cash. It delights in a sensational
romance, but it reads one with far greater avidity if the
publisher will but offer a reward to the first purchaser
who can divine its secret. And no prudent person
would launch a new literary journal–be the staff the
most brilliant and popular journalists procurable, and
the contents precisely what the public is craving for— |
without offering the hope of a permanent income for life
as some inducement to become a subscriber. We see a
similar method employed even in developing the popular
taste for such necessaries as tea and cigarettes.
Very well, then. Apply these methods to the Drama,
and you will, soon see the nation once more becoming
alive to its importance. Let some enterprising West
End Manager advertise a series of rewards on an ascend-
ing scale, something, on these lines:–A prize of one
guinea, or, better still, a souvenir—to the playgoer who
sends in the best summary of the plot of the current
piece; another of £50 to the one who guesses most
correctly the amount of the gross receipts at the end
of each week; £3 a week during the run of the piece to
the writer of the best reply to the question why he or
she likes the performance; and £5 a week for life, with
admission to the Royal box on every alternate Monday,
to the author of the Worst last line to a Limerick com-
posed by the fireman of the theatre.
Only try this, and if it does not bring about the
Renascence of the British Drama, I am very much
afraid that nothing will.
This is my advice. You may call it too idealistic, un-
practical, wanting in knowledge of human nature—any-
thing you like. I offer it for what it is worth. I make
no charge for it. F. A.

Gaelic should be the recognised language of their country

weary of the inanities of effete
society, longs for a vital feeling
of the big forces that are ani-

tired feeling of her race. Seated
among her piles of scalps she has
just finished her fifth Manhattan
cocktail one evening when she
hears a voice calling to her from
across the boundless prairie
hundreds of miles away. It is

is John's voice, and it calls

and her deep, vivid, passionate
nature responds. In a moment
he looms beside her, a real

arms about her, in all the thrill of
rich, tender fiction. The book
is big; it burns hot with harsh

THE HOLIDAY STAGE.
I AM sure that Mr. WALKLEY must
before now, in one of his parenthetic
discourses on the Greek drama, have
instructed us about that sense of “a
bursting subjectivity '' (SchLEGEL's
phrase, I fancy) which an ancient
audience derived from the illusion of
| being in the secrets of the high gods.
And something of the same feeling
helps, if less consciously, to expand
the chests of a first-night audience
at a Drury Lane Pantomime. As we
watched, through the gloom of a
primeval chaos, the shifting of natural
scenes, the movement (up and down
sweets. Of these the marrons glacés
served as a very happy comment
upon the humour of the pantomime,
for seldom have I had the satisfaction
of recognising so many frosted chest-
nuts among the jeux d'esprit. In the
scene of Indigestion that followed (as
the night succeeds the day) one won-
dered how the names of the makers of
patent medicines came to be omitted
from their bottles. Certain descrip-
tions of soup, soap, cakes, and even a
weekly journal (read by a robber) had
in previous scenes been advertised
with a most refreshing frankness.
Mr. WALTER PAssMoRE, as the
Male Babe, was pleasantly diverting,
and ALDERs, a delightful burlesque of
the stage duel.
I do not feel that # can do full
justice to the performance, as I was
only present for about three hours.
But I shall pay several further visits
of the same duration, and thus hope
eventually to cover the whole ground.
Since I saw Peter Pan two years
ago there are not many improve-
ments to record, but then how could
there be? Miss SYBIL CARLISLE is a
great advance upon the previous Mrs.
Darling. Perhaps the most graceful
figure upon the legitimate stage of
to-day, she here communicates a
touch of pathos which, if not perfectly
or sideways) of forests,
the reorganisation of land-
scapes, the adjustment of
the orbs of night or day,
we seemed to be assisting
at the very sources of
cosmic evolution.
“We caught for a moment the
powers at play.” -
This flattering thought
remains among the deepest
impressions stamped upon
my mind after witnessing
the first performance of
The Babes in the Wood.
Let me say at once that
the Hellenic note was not
sustained. I missed the
political allusiveness of the
Aristophanic parabasis. The
topical element that was
once the pride of our Panto-
mimes seems to have yield-
ed to purely spectacular
claims, thus reflecting the
modern phase which gives
Matter the preference over
Mind. On the other hand,

maternal, is the next best
thing. Miss PAULINE CHAse
may perhaps want some-
thing of the subtlety of
others who have played the
title-róle, but she has the
quality of perpetual boy-
hood; in this she shows a
consistency which Mr.
BARRIE himself might envy.
I missed in the new inter-
preter of Hook that air of
fallen nobility which Mr.
GERALD DU MAURIER im:
parted to this deplorable
character. Mr. MATTHEws,
as Darling père, seemed a
little sorry for himself in
the kennel scene; and 1
am not surprised. It is
the play's weak spot, defi-
antly preserved. For the

Now MY TROUSERS ARE CREASED
[In view of recent correspondence
in a contemporary regarding the
right rules of etiquette for the recep-
got thrown in gratuitously, was
sustained with an unwonted consecu-
tion of argument. At almost any
point it was possible to recognise
easily that the subject was neither
Cinderella nor Robinson Crusoe. (2)
I gathered from my programme that
the Management's threat to dispense
with the Harlequinade (as plaintively
recorded in a cartoon of Mr. Punch's
last issue) was a false rumour. I
was thus able to rejoice in spirit (for
my body had retired at a reasonable
hour) with the half-dozen precocious
children that figured in a packed
house. (P.S.. I hear that the Harle-
quinade was cut out after all.)
That was a pretty scene in Lolli-
popland where the ballet simulated
a fascinating variety of toothsome
but the best lines were given to the
Baroness, Mr. NEIL RENyon, who de-
livered them in braid Scots, très sec.
I can quite understand that the
eternal fitness of things demanded
that she should be a man; also why
the rôle of the Babes' Governess
should be assigned to Mr. HARRY
FRAGSON (for how else was he to
work his French songs in 2); but I
don’t so clearly sea why, in the Robin
Hood section, that swashbuckler vil-
lain Lord Hugo (not the CECIL)
should be played by a lady with a
thin pipe of a voice. But I do not
expect to understand everything at a
pantomime. Among the things I
really did grasp with intelligence
was a rough-and-tumble fight be-
tween The Robbers, Messrs. DREw
tion of burglars, Mr. Punch offers
the following advice for the guidance of his
readers.]
SHOOT THE BURGLAR INSTANTLY
1. If he betrays any desire to dis-
cuss the fiscal problem.
2. If he is jumping on your chest
with hob-nailed boots. -
3. If he is leaving the house with
all your nether garments under his
ar"In .
4. If he talks like any of the
burglars in magazine stories.
REFRAIN FROM SHOOTING
1. If he is moving towards your
rich uncle's bed-room. (In this case
the prerogative of taking first shot be-
longs to your uncle. Better that the
burglar's feelings should be hurt by
apparent neglect than that your rich

interference.)
2. If your bulldog has the burglar
by the throat. You might disturb
the noble animal.
3. If your teething infant has just
gone to sleep. The burglar might be
a father himself, and would respect
your motive.
4. If you are on the verge of bank-
ruptcy. A timely burglary accounts
so neatly for the disappearance of
portable property.
5. If you couldn't hit a hay-stack
at ten yards. The burglar probably
could.
6. If your wife is a Suffragette.
Leave him to her—unless you appre-
hend the wrath of the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Burglars. (But see next section.)

1. If your wife is a Suffragette.
2. If you are heavily insured
against accident. Point out to the
burglar that a bullet through the calf
would give you a six months' trip
down the Mediterranean.
IN Doubtful CAs Es
1. Do not shoot till you have
warned the burglar.
2. Do not tell him that he is run-
ning a risk of the gallows.
3. Remind him that, if he kills
you, Mr. HALL CAINE and Mr. BART
KENNEDY will almost certainly pub-
lish psychological studies of his
demeanour in the dock. He will
probably burst into tears at the
thought, and go home a sadder and
a better burglar.
On this same theme a correspon-
dent communicates the following
useful hints:–
It is not necessary to wait for a
formal introduction before entering
into conversation with a burglar, but
it should be remembered that he is
by nature something of a recluse, and
may possibly resent any interest,
however intelligent, which may be
taken in his work.
A little thought will readily suggest
suitable conversational openings. For
instance, noticing that he has his
jemmy, with him, you may inquire,
“And how is little JAMEs 2 ”
In case of a dispute it is not usual
to offer the burglar the choice of
pistols or swords. If he has his own
weapon with him he wih probably
prefer to use that.
As to the exact moment for pulling
the trigger, a polished burglar will
always utter the word “Fire " in an
audible voice when he is ready.
Some authoritias hold that a
burglar may be shot at sight. This

is risky, as he may possibly be a
guest from a neighbouring house
party.
To obviate errors in this direction
it is becoming the fashion for all pro-
perly qualified burglars to wear when
on active service all their tickets-of-
leave and other orders and diplomas.
In big burglar shoots dogs are fre-
quently used, but it is considered
ostentatious to employ loaders.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. Tuckwell's Reminiscences of Oarford (SMITH,
ELDER) carry him back to the Thirties, a distance which
leaves few living contemporaries. The fact almost
requires sworn testimony for its acceptance. On the
verge of fourscore, when the life of ordinary man is but
labour and sorrow, Mr. TUCKWELL preserves and dis-
plays almost boyish high spirits. It is the salt of
humour, best of antiseptics, as Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT
once said, that has preserved the springs of youth. He
has keen scent for a humorous story, which happily
suffers nothing in his hands. His good things
illuminate every page, and are told with that brevity
which is essential to success. As adventures are to
the adventurous, so quaint incidents and odd personages
come in the way of a man of humour. Gifted with a
marvellous memory, Mr. Tuckwell recalls the bons
mots of Dons, the escapades of undergraduates, in an
Oxford to-day as extinct as the Heptarchy. Incidentally,
tionate. LEAR, when he had a moment to spare, took up
his pen and babbled. With judicious selection the
book, not at its best ranking high amongst published
correspondence of eminent men, would have been read-
able. There is, for example, a delightful account of the
company LEAR happened upon at a riverside inn on the
Thames. For the most part the correspondence runs on
the following lines, quoted from a letter written from
what the writer—such a wag|—spells “Hupper See-
more Street, Portman D. ". . “O mill how giddy I is.
Perhaps it is along of the cliff of Ain Giddi; perhaps of
the glass of sherry and water close by—only I ain't drank
it yet.” When LEAR is not thus determinately funny he
is very good. Writing about an idiotic sermon he hap-
pened to hear in a country church he asks a question
which has often occurred to less gifted persons: “Why
are men allowed to talk such nonsense unsnubbed in a
wooden desk, who would be scouted in an ordinary
room 2'' LEAR is happily unconscious of his share in
creating the current craze for the balderdash known as
Limericks. It would be a meet punishment for him to

rare pen-and-ink drawings, a portrait of PUSEY in the

time head-master of Rugby, Mr. TucKWELL writes:
“He was a pleasant fellow and a good scholar, though
what the waiter in The Newcomes would call a 'harbi-
trary gent.’” It is with diffidence I venture to suggest
that for once Mr. Tuckwell, stumbles in his reminis-
cences. Wasn't it ForstER whose character a cabman,
hustled in the matter of his fare, summed up in
the familiar phrase, to the great delight of CHARLES
DickeNs?
The Letters of Edward Lear (FISHER UN WIN), would
have been twice as good if the book had been half as
long. Lady STRACHEY, with loyal, well-deserved, but
in effect disastrous adulation of the author of The Book
of Nonsense, finding a pile of letters addressed by him to
his friends ChichESTER FoRTEscue, and Lady WALDE-
GRAve, has tumbled them all out into a stout volume.
The relations between LEAR and the member of the
House of Commons whom some of us remember as
Chief Secretary for Ireland were intimate and affec-
act, even for a Douglas,
but I question its wisdom. At first all is plain sail-
ing. The opening scenes of his novel—the boyhood
of his Irish-Methodist hero and the religious riots which
dispute with ship-building the honour of being the chief
industry of Belfast—are admirably conceived. But
after that he is blown out of his course by the treach-
erous wind of Imagination. To the black-coated
preacher enter a Scarlet Woman, the most beautiful and
wealthiest lady in the world, who has met more
monarchs than even Mr. LE QUEUx. On the Thames
Embankment, somewhere about where the Savoy and
the Cecil and the Savage now stand, she out-Vaticans
the Vatican with a building which includes a cathedral
bigger than St. Peter's, besides an opera-house, a
theatre, art galleries, concert-rooms, terraced gardens,
and goodness knows what else, and instals her little
Methodist lover, who has meanwhile married another,
as its Pope. And the rest is love and jealousy and
extravagant absurdity. I am afraid Mr. Douglas must
try again—unless, like a good cobbler, he elects to stick
to his last.

THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT COLD.
TIME was, SEPTIMIUs, back some decades three,
While yet I had the makings of a hero,
When I would crow for very mirth to see
The glass descend below the line of zero;
When, to the blast impervious, I would go
Steel-shod across the ringing plains of ice,
Fretting their polish (purposely or no)
With many a quaint device.
'Tis otherwise to-day; this bitter snap
Threatens to petrify my skating muscles,
To parch my humours, corrugate my sap,
And cause a poverty of red corpuscles;
Torpid with cold, my veins no longer hum
Ecstatically with the coursing blood,
And, if I fell, I know that I should come
A most infernal thud.
Bucolic sportsmen, such as have a hide
Of the consistency of rhino leather, -
Or he that wears a nose already dyed
May wallow in this “seasonable '' weather;
Young people may allege it makes them fit, * >
And cheery elders say, “It might be worse;
I'm neither young, nor cheery, so I sit
Inside my grate and curse.
Mind you, I'm not a grumbler; I respect
(Broadly) the rules of Nature and of Reason;
I hope I should, on principle, reject
A dish of strawberries gathered out of season;
And, if I overheard the cuckoo's sign
Uttered, in error, on a winter's day,
I should pretend I hadn't, and decline
To give the bird away.
I am not exigent, nor claim to bask
Just now in punts at Maidenhead or Marlow;
But is there not some happy mean? I ask;
Must I be forced to fly to Monte Carlo 2
Must I, against my will, be driven to roam
In that lone alien clime, who might have done
My honest toil contentedly at home
At 400 in the sun ? O. S.
LETTERS OF MARK.
THE Post Office High Court sat yesterday to try
criminal cases. The judges took their seats on the mail-
bags at 8.0 a.m. Great interest was shown in the trial
of ALF. GUMLICHER, 19, post-office clerk, of Little Pipley-
on-the-Pond (three words) under Floodwater. , GUM-
Licher was accused of having postmarked a letter in
such a manner that not only the name but the date was
legible. The prisoner, having complained of cold, was
accommodated with a newspaper wrapper, but was cau-
tioned to leave the ends open. He pleaded “not ex-
ceeding,’’ and conducted his own defence.
The first witness for the prosecution was the post-
mistress of LPP (under FWR). She had often had to
caution the accused about the dangerous clearness of his
date-stamps, and always felt sure in her heart of hearts
that he would come to a bad end. (The witness was
here reminded that her communication must be confined
to formal matter only; anything in the nature of a letter
would necessitate, etc., etc.) The witness, continuing,
said that when she first caught sight of the incriminating
envelope, with its ghastly post-mark shouting the ac-
cusing message, she nearly swallowed a parcels label.
She never saw such a horrid sight in her life. Every
letter and figure could be read with the naked eye.
When she confronted the prisoner with it he blushed
like a pillar-box.
The accused in his defence said that at the time of
the alleged crime he was of unsound mind, having been
engaged in deciphering an inland telegram written by a
lady with the office pen and blotted on the office pad.
After a space (provided for that purpose) the Lord
High Judge of Registration-Fees, wearing the Blue Cross
of St. Martin's, charged with two D's copper, arose and
informed the Court that the jury, having carefully
balanced the evidence and found it overweight, had
made out a bill against the prisoner. That miserable
malefactor was thereupon, whereas, and hereinafter
sentenced to become one of the public, and to read three
country postmarks a day.
The prisoner was carried out insensible.

DEFERRED EXECUTION.
Poor old picture | There, staring
us in the face, is just the very piece
of bare wall that would have fitted
it ; and yet it will never, never know
what it really is to be hung, much
less to be hanged.
It is, by the way, partly the pic-
ture's own fault. There is clearly
no sense in wanting to be hanged,
much less in wanting to be hung.
Hanging is the very last thing that
one reserves for one's worst enemy. I
daresay that even I have on occasion
desired someone to be hanged, but,
speaking to memory, I have never
actually hanged anybody. The most
harsh thing to say to a person who
has incurred your wrath is, “You be
hanged,” unless you are that sort of
brute who would say, “You be. . .”
But, no—that is unthinkable. I am
sorry I ever suggested it. If I
thought you would talk like that, I
could never write another article for
you to read. Promise me you never
will. If you did and I heard you,
I should go straight and tell the
Editor. (I once began a poem:-—
The nicest-mannered men I know,
Although it is myself that's said it,
Are those terrumpty-umpty-o
Whose lot in life it is to edit.
I should not trouble to complete the
third line, if I were you. . If you
did, you could not hope to win a
prize, and we should only stick to
your sixpence.) And so we come
round again to the subject of the
picture.

tures, and written home : —“Arrived
safely. Kettle tired, but otherwise
complete. Practically finished hang-
ing pictures. Love. JAck.” Then
I determined to smoke a well-earned
pipe before completing the job. But
you know how one pipe leads to
another, and another leads to bed.
On January 4th, at 8.25 p.m., I
was on the point of hanging the
twelfth picture when something told
me not to. Think how welcome,
when things began to pall, the sight
of a fresh picture would be “All
right, something old man,” I con-
ceded, “ though I am determined to
hang it to-morrow, I will let us off
to-night.”
On January 7th, at 8.43 p.m., I
broached the question again, but
came to the conclusion that it was
foolish to expect one to write to one's
best girl and hang one's pictures on
the same evening.

merits, and I will not deny that I
put myself to some trouble and ex-
pense to notice how pictures ought
to be ha—, hu—, hanged. (There
is this to be said for that other
unmentionable word, that if one did
want to use it, one would not have
to worry about grammar. One would
simply say “Be . . . ,” and there
| one would be. There would be no
need even to consider the possibility
of “Be dumn.” But then, of course,
one never would use it.)
On September 1st (m.) I returned,
but wasn't going to let myself spoil
a good holiday by hanging pictures
on the last evening of it.
On November 5th (there is some-
thing inspiring about that day) I saw
that the picture must now be sus-
pended, but I could not find the
cord.
It is now nearly midnight on
December 31st. To-morrow will be
the first day of the new year, and
the next day will be the second day
of the new year... So we shall go on
for 366 days till we get to next
31st of December, which will be the
last day of the new year. The day
after that will be . . . But why
drag in days when we are talking
about pictures? I have taken the
picture in question from its resting-
place, and am condoling with the
dear old man on his bad luck.
Stroking his tired old back, I find
the cord neatly tied on him all ready
for use. Whoever tied it there? . .
No, No. It is very kind of you to
suggest that, but I protest that I
was never equal to it. It cannot
have been I. If only we had found
this out on November 5th, who
knows what might have then hap-
pened? Who knows but that . . 2
There ! I have dropped the whole
sordid affair.
Hang the thing !
Yes; that, of course, is what we
have been trying to do all along. But
how can one hang a picture which
bears all the unmistakable signs of
being smashed to smithereens?
Very well. Then there is no way
out of it but—“. . . . the thing ! ”

what good use I made of that eight
years' interval.

To tell the truth, one of the reasons
why ELEANOR had loved JAck was be-
cause he was so boyish, and yet with
it all had a certain manly dignity.
It was in a magnificent soliloquy
that she dwelt upon this.) Now
when you are only sixteen boyishness
is nothing out of the way; on the
other hand, manly dignity looks
rather like priggishness. So ELEANok
had to readjust all her ideas; and she
was still readjusting them, with un-
happy results for JAck, when that
gentleman returned. (NEwton had
gone by this time. He wasn't a
sportsman; , but he was playing
JBridge, and had only come in be-
cause he was Dummy.)
ELEANOR was a reasonable girl, and
she had decided to ask JAck if

any truth in it. -

would have said “Yes,’’ I am sure,
but at that moment the door opened
(now we are coming to the plot)
and NEw to N came in.
NEw to N was the Other Man, and
had all the characteristics of Other
Men. In a few impassioned phrases
he proposed, and was rebuffed.

said NEwton, “you love another.”
“Yes,’’ said ELEANOR simply.
Now mark the craftiness of
NEwto N. He didn't say at once that,
if it was JAck, then she might like to
know that he had been in prison
twice for forgery, and was even now
engaged to three other people. No,
he took a different line altogether.
“Charming boy, JACK,” he said.
“You would never think to look at
him that he was only sixteen last
birthday.”
ELEANor was flabbergasted (if one
may use such a word of such a
charming girl). In the first place

Of course it all came right in the
cnd. Somebody let the secret out,
and she found she loved him more
than ever. There was just one other
hitch, though. JACK had sworn that,
having been refused once, he would
never ask her again. (I like his
spirit.) Things seemed at a dead-
lock, and it looked as though the
marriage wouldn't come off after all.
Then she remembered suddenly. It
was Leap Year.
She went on her knees.

me?”

That was the story. On January

I would not offer it to him again, but
tried it on somebody else, once more
backing it both ways. . . .
By February 29 I had tried most
of the magazines in London. . It
seemed then too late, for people were
beginning to forget that it was Leap
Year. But I did not despair. So
long as 1904 lasted (I swore) I would
do my best for that story. And so it
was not until the 29th of December
that The Missing Octave came back
from The Fortnightly Review for the
last time.
I put it away in a drawer. In
eight years' time, I said, when the
next Leap Year comes, I will try
again. By that time, perhaps, the
public will have been educated up to
my story.
-k × × :
Now then, you see the horrible
tragedy of it. Only four years have
passed, and yet here we are again in
another Leap Year. My story is now
useless. If JACK is really twenty-
four he would have been as old as
twenty on his last birthday, and I am
sure ELEANor would not refuse him
for that. On the other hand, if he
were sixteen in 1904, he would only
be twenty now, and ELEANor would
never have let herself fall in love with
him. No, I must have my eight
years' interval. Why, the title alone
demands that.
I don't know much about Leap
Year, but I know it has something to
do with the carth going round the sun,
and I think MERCAtoR's Projection
comes into it. Also Pope GREGORY. I
believe he is the man I want to meet.
We were going along quite calmly
with Leap Year every four years, and
then in comes GREGORY with a won-
derful idea for leaving out Leap Year
once every hundred years. Of course
I know that but for this my story
could never have been written; but
it is annoying when you have written
it, and are confidently looking for-
ward to the applause of the critics to
find that——
But GREGoRY has always been a
spoil-sport. I remember his powders
in the nursery.

Well, I have done the only thing
possible. I have made my will, and
left my work to my great-grandson
HAROLD. By 2004 he should be just
beginning his literary career. How
he will startle the critics with his
masterly short story, entitled The
Missing Octave 1 What would I not

the ranks of the acknowledged masters
of this difficult art.”—Times. “A

“SAY “when,' old MAN.”
brilliant work, brilliantly executed.”
—Telegraph. And so on.
Of course a few slight alterations
in matters of detail may have to be
made in my story. Bridge, for in-
stance, may not be played so exten-
sively then as now; possibly JACK
would appear a little outré in saying
“I don’t mind if I do.” But the
main scheme is for all time; and if
HAROLD has inherited anything of his
great-grandfather's genius the de-
tails may be left to him with confi-
dence.
This will be in 2004. At least I
suppose so. But I have a horrible
suspicion that some other Pope has
already dodged in with the suggestion
that once every thousand years Leap
Year should go in again. I don't
know, but it would be just like him.
Of course in that case HAROLD will
be unable to get my story printed;
but you will note that in my will I
have left it to him “to use as seems
best to him.” No doubt he would
leave it to his great-grandson, so that
in 2104 the great work would appear.
But that does not concern me. I
have left The Missing Octave to my
great-grandson HAROLD, and when
the time comes he will know what to
do with it. He will know better than
I what are Leap Years, and what
aren't.
His name will be HAROLD, because
by that time only HAROLDs will be
allowed to write for the Press.

HOW TO KEEP WARM.
BY DR. WILL ANDREW son.
The recent cold snap, rendered
doubly severe by the long prevalence
of vernal weather in the early winter,
has once more revived the perennial
question—How to keep warm.
Financiers, impresarios and suc-
cessful novelists remain faithful to
furs. But we cannot all belong to
one or other of these favoured
classes. We may, if the painful
truth must be told, be in a position
to claim relief on earned income
within the £2,000 limit. And then
the question arises in all its insistent
and strenuous urgency—How are we
to keep rude Boreas at bay?
Perhaps the best, because the
cheapest, way of solving the diffi-
culty is that which has been put for-
ward by a correspondent of The Daily
Mail. His communication, which is
dated Reading, runs as follows:—
“At the beginning of the present spell of
cold weather I got my tailor to make me a vest
of brown paper to be worn under my waistcoat.
I now find that my new paper garment
keeps me so warm that in my walks abroad I

Mild Hindu (greaning). “No, MRs. JAckson, it is Not the HEAD; it is waat you call You: ‘BLAck MARIA.’”
THE RECITATION.
THERE was an entertainment in the village hall last
Wednesday night, and Mum let NINA and me go to it, for
a great treat, with Mrs. AustiN. Mrs. AUSTIN had been
to lots of them before, so she knew all about them, but
it was the first one NINA and I had ever been at. Dad
and Mum were dining out that night, so there was no
dinner at home. The entertainment was for the church
Organ.
º got there in jolly good time, and sat in the third
row. The programmes were twopence each, and I
bought three, and gave one to NINA and one to Mrs.
AustiN. Mrs. AustiN said “You 're quite the little
gentleman, Master HERBERT;” and NINA said, “He 's
not so bad for nine, but he 's got a lot to learn yet.” I
think she was a bit angry because she wasn't performing
herself. She said the only way to enjoy such perform-
ances was to view them in a critical spirit. I said
“Yes,” but I don't know what she meant. She did it
by whispering, “How absurd ' '' every now and then
when they shouted rather loud. Those were the bits I
liked, and so did Mrs. AUstiN.
About a quarter of an hour after we got there Mr.
WILLoughby, the Vicar, came on to the platform and sat
down behind a little table. Mrs. AustiN said, “He’s
in the chair,’’ and I said, “Anybody can see that,” and
then NINA started explaining that if anybody was in the
chair it meant he was the ruler, and everybody had to
obey him. Mr. WILLoughby hadn't anything to rule
with, except a jug of water and a glass, but he looked
all right, and we all clapped our hands. Then Mr.
WILLOUGHBY got up and began to speak. He said he
wasn't going to say much, because Chairmen oughtn't
to. Everybody knew, he said, why we were there, and
it was very gratifying to see the room so well filled. He
wanted those who were standing at the back of the hall
to come and sit in the front row, where there was lots of
room. Then he stopped, but nobody moved. “Come
up here, Gosling,” he said, “and you too, DEAcon.”
Gosling is the Sunday name of our JIM, and DEAcon is
the Vicar's gardener. They shuffled about, but at last
JIM came along, looking awfully red, and DEAcon came
with him, and some others, and we all cheered like mad,
and laughed. JIM told me afterwards he 'd be even with
the Vicar for picking him out like that. He said he
thought he 'd take his name off the Men's Club; but he
hasn't.
Well, the Vicar went on for about ten minutes, telling
us all about the organ and how splendid it was going to
be. Then he sat down; but he got up again directly, and
said the choir would sing “Men of Harlech.” They

did it jolly well. MACBEAN is in the choir. He sings
the deep parts, and I could hear him roaring out some
of his words long after the rest had finished. Mrs.
AUSTIN said that was the way of the Scotch all the world
over; and NINA said he oughtn't to sing Scotch in a
Welsh song; but I didn't care. I thought he sang best
of the lot.
Next we had a song called
sung by Miss —
JULIET Hickson.
She was dressed
in white, with
her arms bare,
and she said she
was weary of
waiting all alone.
She said every-
body's heart was

one she would
just as soon be

on like this for a
bit, and then she
got to a verse
where she said
a light was
breaking, and,
lo, someone had
appeared, and
the world was
changed. She
screamed it out.

through me.
Then she finished
up very happy,

that sort. I
didn't like it
very much.

them all off laughing more than ever; but Mr. Evans
didn't seem to like it much. He frowned at them and
shook his head, but it made them worse. JIM had got
his head back and his handkerchief stuffed into his
mouth, and Mrs. AUSTIN was nudging me and saying
“There, didn't I tell you? There isn't anyone like
Some One,” which was him,” and she was rolling about with laughing. Then

tragic, and nobody ought to have laughed. So it was all

THE UBIQUITOUS MICROBE.
The microbe, though invisible to ordinary eyes,
For activity is difficult to beat; -
Ry a baleful omnipresence he atones for lack of size
And is singularly nimble on his feet.
Against his machinations there is no effective screen,
For there 's nothing that he will not do or dare;
It is vain to doubt his presence just because he isn't
seen,
You must take it as a fact that he is there.
His object is to get about and cover lots of ground,
And in this his perseverance is sublime;
Where you least expect to find him he is certain to be
found
In bunches of a billion at a time.
You may dive below the billow, you may navigate the
alr,
The result in either case will be the same;
Wherever you may get to you will find that he is there,
With a local habitation and a name.
He is borne upon the blizzard, he is wafted by the
breeze,
He can travel in the snowflake and the rain,
And fºugh he takes advantage of conveyances like
these -
He will often sit beside you in the train.
In the way of locomotion there is nothing comes amiss,
"Tis a hobby he rejoices to pursue,
And if he has a motto it must certainly be this:–
'' To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.”
But he 's useful is the microbe, and should ever he
decline
His presence would be sorrowfully missed;
The spectacled professor would indubitably pine
And (as such) would discontinue to exist.
He would languish in the army of the chronic un-
employ'd,
For what calling could he possibly embrace,
Who, unskilled in any industry, has hitherto enjoy'd
The exhilarating pleasures of the chase?
Fine-weather Friends.
'' Christmastide in Kendal passed off very success-
fully, the weather, though not of the orthodox character,
b -ing suitable for getting about amongst friends of an
open and Spring-like character.”—Kendal Mercury.
The Morning Post on “Politics at the Cape.”
“The truth of the middle path is often nearer the whole truth
than that of either side. . . . But the middle way is straight and
narrow. It escapes with diffi ulty the encroachments of either side.
It is tortuous and beset with thorns. Especially is the position of those
who guide their followers along the middle way one of difficulty and
almost inevitable disaster.”
So it would seem.

A GREAT CRITIC AT HOME.
(With acknowledgments to “The Chronicle.”
which has recently published a characteris-
tic interrier with Sir W. S. Gilber: ly
Mr. Bram Stoker.)
MY conversation with Mr. WiLLIAM
ARcher, the famous dramatic critic,
publicist and Scandinavian scholar,
was held partly in the study of his
beautiful house, partly as we walked
about , the grounds of his richly-
wooded estate, Longbow Chase,
which occupies a commanding posi-
tion on the summit of Arrow Hill.
Mr. ARcher has enormously en-
hanced the value of his property,
chiefly in the way of adding to its
picturesque effects. Amongst these
is a lovely little lake, resembling
Lucerne in its configuration, where
in the summer time,
Mr. ARCHER and his
friends swim daily,
sometimes two or
three times a day, for
Mr. Archer is a life
member of the Bath
Club, and an intimate
friend of MontAGU

Scandinavians to a *
man, have consider-
ately christened Pier
Gynt.
As the house stands
on the top of the Hill
of Arrow the views from it are finer
than if it stood on the flat. The house
itself is large, standing entirely in
its own grounds, and contains many
fine and commodious apartments,
furnished with taste and stored with
objects of “bigotry and virtue,” to
use the witty phrase of the owner.
The great drawing-room in particular
is a veritable treasure-house of
artistic souvenirs. On one table is a
great ivory goblet (Gothic), of the
seventh century. The tusk from
which it was carved must have been
enormous, probably that of a mam-
moth or perhaps a mastodon. On
another table is an exquisite piece of
carving, representing the historic feat
of WILLIAM TELL. In the hall, a
splendid apartment, measuring 40 ft.
by 24 ft., there is a colossal statue of
IPSEN and a huge model of a Viking
and measuring 16 ft. from the beak
to the tail. On fine days Mr.
ARcher loves to launch this ship on
his lake, and pilot his guests round
its shores, shouting at intervals
‘‘ Heiatohol ’’ and other suitable
Scandinavian expletives. On one of
these occasions Mr. WALKLEY fell
overboard, and narrowly escaped
death at the teeth of a pet shark—
the favourite dish of the Vikings—
which had escaped from its moorings.
• In other rooms of the house are
interesting souvenirs of episodes in
the owner's career as a critic,
traveller and man of letters. In the
belfry is a beautiful bronze model of
the original Bell of New York. In
the conservatory, a palatial building,
recalling in its contours the Great
Exhibition of 1851, are a clump of

Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER is a stalwart
man of just six feet high. Though no
longer in his première jeunesse, he
still retains much of the alert and
athletic vigour of his youth. He can
still toss the caber over the roof of his
castellated mansion, and is the cham-
pion spool-catcher of the Pinner

“Well, allowing an average of 800

“What,” I asked, “is the ten-
dency of the modern stage 2 ''
“Forward—distinctly forward ' In
fact, from the days of AEschylus
onwards there has been a continued
development of the better class of
play.”
Here Mr. ARcher quoted with
great gusto a passage from the
Agamemnon, in the original Greek,
accompanying himself on the pianola,
an instrument on which he is no
mean performer.
When the last strains died away,
“What is your opinion,” I asked,
“of the relative prospects of tragedy,
farce, and
burlesque 2 ''
“That,’’ remarked
Mr. ARCHER, with a
winning smile, “is a
large question. But,
as SHAKSPEARF said,
“All the world 's a
stage,’ and there is
surely room in it for
diverse manifestations
| of the dramatic im:
| pulse. Personally, I
think that they will
all go on; but I do
not wish to dog-
matise.”
“What is your

parative merits of

“That,” remarked
Mr. ARCHER, “is
-- a quest i on be st
answered in the words of the Icelandic
proverb ‘Dnim ruoy nwossenisub.’”
"Are you a believer in the value of
the revolving stage?”
At this moment, just when Mr.
ARCHER was beginning to assume his
most expansive and communicative
manner, a telegraph boy suddenly
hove in sight and handed mine host
an orange-hued missive. Breaking
open the envelope Mr. ARCHER
checked a Norwegian imprecation,
and remarked, “This is really most
annoying; but I am suddenly sum-
moned to attend a private rehearsal
of GRANVILLE BARKER's new play,”
and with a cordial handshake he leapt
on to his motor bicycle, leaving me
disappointed at the abrupt termina-
tion of our momentous interview, but
more than ever impressed by the
fascinating personality of England's
many
premier dramatic critic.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE no hesitation in calling Who's Who 1908
(A. & C. BLAck) the most interesting romance of the
year. Perhaps there are rather too many characters
introduced, but these are all so well drawn that this
fault may be forgiven. One of the first people we meet
is Professor CLEveLAND ABBE, A.M., F.R.Ast.Soc.,
F.R.Met.Soc. (the author is here a little obscure), and
we learn with pleasure that his was the hand which in
1889 gave the world the ever-famous Determination of the
|True Amount of Precipitation, and in 1906 the no less
celebrated Trade Winds and the Doldrums, Met. Zeit.
Hann-Band. It is on page 1 that we hear about this,
and it is not until two thousand pages have passed that
we first meet Sir Edward WITTENooM (Wattename !).
Meanwhile much has happened. MARIE HALL–no rela-
|tion to CoRELLI CAINE–has revealed her secrets to us.
Mr. LE QUEUx has confessed that his recreation is
“Practising with a revolver,” showing that he is in
complete sympathy with his characters; and KEBLE
HowARD owns that his is “Sleeping,” showing that he
is in no less complete sympathy with his readers. The
hero of the book seems to be ERNEST WALLIs BUDGE—
at any rate, the
reluctantly obliged to admit that it is all in the hand-
writing of WILLIAM BRowNE. ELLA FULLER MAITLAND,
to give BETHIA HARDACRE her proper name, has, like
the bee, roamed over the pleasaunce of early English
poetry, and spreads her wealth of honey in this book.
Envious of her leisure, I am grateful for the opportunity
of sharing its prizes.
Mr. Owen RHoscomyl is epic in manner. He is fond
of rhythmical repetitions, and his heroes smile “grey ’’
smiles (a feat, by the way, which, to irreverent minds,
may possibly recall the “last phase ’’ of the Cheshire
Cat). In Wronina (Duckworth) there are times when
this heroic method is altogether admirable, more
especially when Mr. RhoscomyL is describing, with an
almost combative enthusiasm, the grandeur of Cymric
scenery; and times when it is less so, as, for instance,
when he says, “Dark all her dress was, and dark
her hat above it.” I think I could have put that
more simply, though it suggests a rather happy way of
adding interest to our Court and Society columns. The
story deals with that mystic emotionalism which made
possible the strange scenes of the “revival '' in Wales,
and is conducted to a violently dramatic conclusion.
The best chapter (a truly beautiful piece of word-
painting) is that which treats of Llangoel church and its
author devotes more
space to him than
to any of the others.

(CoNstABLE) is a diary to be kept on a shelf con-
venient to the hand, and dipped into every day. As was
written of Britannia's Pastorals, a prime favourite with
MILTON and BEThia HARDACRE, “to lovers of our old
poets it will always be a favourite lounging book.”
Every page is a delight, being starred with unread or un-
remembered passages from poets whose names are to the
present generation more familiar than their writing.
Dealing with the matchless epitaph on Lady PEMBROKE,
“SIDNEY’s sister, PEMBROKE's mother,” BETHIA, concur-

to BEN Jonson, who long enjoyed the fame, but to
WILLIAM BRowNE. In the MS. of BRowNE's poems,
stored in the library of the British Museum, the im-
1 mortal verse is supplemented by a second stanza, which
HAzlitt attributed to Lord PEMBROKE. By comparison
it is abjectly poor, feet of clay added to a form fashioned
of purest gold, BETHIA, having examined the MS., is

the verse written by Sir FRANcis BURNAND, and the
coloured pictures contributed by Miss WINIFRED
BURNAND, it presents attractions far exceeding the
average of this form of literature. Whether the rhymes
were written for the pictures or the pictures drawn for
the rhymes is a ‘family secret I refrain from prying into.
The result is purely pantomimic in its treatment and
effect. Miss BURNAND has more than a touch of
hereditary humour and is rapidly making her mark in
the department of art to which her genius directs her.

THE circumstantial or conclusive

marvels with which the country
teems.

authority of those who claim the best
right to speak on its behalf, posi-
tively revels in being driven for
miles along the roads away from its
pasture. The way in which these
animals enter into the spirit and fun
of the cattle-drives is something in-
describably touching, and on one
occasion recently in Westmeath it
is credibly asserted that a handsome

it must never be
forgotten that to the
late Mr. EDWARD
LEAR belongs the
credit of first dis-
covering that rare
but radiant creature,
the Dong with the
luminous nose. It is
much to be feared
that this species has
now become extinct,
though a correspon-
dent in The Spectator
recently stated that
his aunt, an elderly
lady living in a her-
metically sealed bun-
galow in the Never

a Dong with a bul-
bous nose engaged in
a deadly triangular
duel with a Wallaby
and a Dingo in the

to mention which, if
any, was the survivor
of this terrible
combat.

The Liverpool Daily
Post represents the
Duke of WESTMINSTER
as saying, in the
course of an address
at the opening of an
institute with rifle
range attached : “A
matter of two hun-
dred years ago, on
every village green,
the lads of the village
were to be seen every
even ing practising
with their long-bows
and cross-bows, and
these became the
men later on who
helped to win the vic-
tories of Cressy,
Poictiers, and Agin-
court.” (Applause.)

“Mrs. Filmer, of High
Street, Rochester, is thought-
fully providing a dozen
meals a day to twelve neces-
sitous children.”—Rochester
and Chatham Journal.
Even Oliver Twist
would probably be
satisfied with such an
allowance.
The Daily Express
told a realistic story
the other day of a
young man who
walked about after
dark pursuing his
studies by the light
of the street lamps.
“In his pocket,” said the
Express, “he carries, a

the Rochdale Pioneers.
Happily, however, while the older

taken by an increasing number of
new and even more marvellous
beasticles and birdlings. Among these
the luminous owl is only one, and
by no means the most significant, of
what may be called the thaumaturgic
neo-fauna of advanced civilisation.
Thus we may note in passing the
emergence of a new and patriotic
type of Cow in Ireland which, on the
melody of “We won't go home till
morning ” in such a way as to be
distinctly recognised by a prominent
member of the United Irish League.
A notable and pleasing feature of
the new animal world is the number
of species rejoicing in the possession
of Christian names, a fact which of
itself speaks volumes for the progress
of civilisation. Thus of late years
we have witnessed the rise of the
Annie Swan, a charming and
thoroughly domesticated fowl, which
he pauses under the street
light he commits a phrase to memory and
repeats it over and over again.”
This was all very well, but the
police were bound to misunderstand
him sooner or later, and so we were
not surprised at coming across in
our Erpress this additional item of
news :
“A man was fined 5s. at the Tower Bridge
Court yesterday for using improper language
to a lamp-post.”
The road to success is indeed beset
with difficulties.

THE DROOD CASE.
MANY sportsmen must have re-
gretted the result of the opening of
the DRUCE grave, and none more
than Messrs. TREE and CoMYNs CARR,
for one mystery breeds popular in-
terest in another. Not that there was
ever really any mystery to be solved
by the audience at His Majesty's.
Wh. it reached them across the
footlights it was already in a state of
solution, for the adapter had had
his dear mind divided between two
first-class dramatic traditions: (1)
Never keep a secret from your audi-
ence; (2) Hold their interest to the
end. Between these two principles
he had to decide, and he decided for
the former. This meant that the
edge was taken off the keenness of
our appetites for the rest of the play,
and the interest was largely confined
to a contest of wits between two
actors, Mr. TREE as Jasper, and Mr.
HAvilAND as Grewgious; and very
admirably was it fought out across
the table in the first “Tableau '' of
Act III., the best in the play.
Whether Mr. CARR's ingenious
solution was the one designed by
DickeNs it is not for me or any other
living detective to say; but it is cer-
tainly supported by the original tale's
insistence upon Jasper's passion for
opium, and it is known that DickeNs
had laid himself out for something
hors ligne, and would not have been
content with a common murder or a
vulgar accident. -
Before the curtain rose a lady in
the stalls was heard to hazard the
conjecture: “It's Vanity Fair, isn't
it?” Can it be that Mr. CARR had
over-rated the public's familiarity
with the original fragment? though
Mr. HALL CAINE, I understand,
admits that the works of Dickens
sell three times as fast as his own;
and he would be the last to bring this
charge against the nation if he were
not reluctantly convinced of its
truth.
Certainly, for those who had never
read or had forgotten the story,
the scene outside the Cathedral in
Act. I. (a really exquisite picture) was
rather bewildering with its variety of
characters in all sorts of unexplained
relationships to one another.
The costumes of the early-Vic-
torian, pre-crinoline period were very
piquant. The petite Miss AUGARDE
was admirably served by hers in the
rather colourless part of Rosa Bud.
(Dear old Dickens, and his “cant-
ing '' names | Where, oh where, is
the humour of yester-century?) Mr.
CHARLEs QUARTERMAINE, too, with his
lithe figure and fine-drawn, feverish
face, was very picturesque. But this
period is not for all types of beauty;
and Miss CoNSTANCE Collier, for
one, was a good way outside the pic-
ture. Nor was Mr. BASIL GILL any
too well suited by the fashion of his
environment. One remembers him
an attractive object as Aumerle and
as The Darling of the Gods; but both
in facial and vocal adaptability he is
curiously unaccommodating.
I must not forget how the Durdles
of Mr. ANsoN and the Grewgious of
Mr. HAvilAND relieved the ambient
MR. Basil Gill (Edwin Drood) to MR. Thee
(Jasper). “I have never seen that look in
your eyes before ' "

gloom with their respective styles of
humour—rotund and angular.
, Edwin Drood's mystery may, in
the authorised version, have been a
great one, but the question how, in
its adapted form, it is to sustain a
very strong grip on the popular
imagination is a greater mystery
still. Mr. TREE's own personality,
be it never so versatile and brilliant,
is not of itself enough to carry off a
play which makes hardly any appeal
to one's humanity.
I except the orchestra from this
criticism. As I entered in the
midst of the overture they were play-
ing a Christmas hymn, and I joined
in as well as I could, not having the
words with me.

Now that the Courts are once more

acute. Formerly it was only con-

cases for them to try and let them
do the rest. Nowadays, however,
something more is needed. One can
hardly expect DARLING J., for ex-
ample, to be content with a mere
party and party case. He must
have special witnesses (theatrical
preferred) and a supply of limelight,
otherwise it is felt that he is not
being properly dealt with. But, ex-
traordinary as it may appear to the
average layman, these things are
ruled altogether by chance, and it is
as likely, so careless are the
authorities, that a really humorous
cause providing plenty of opportu-
nities for first-class “gags ’’ will be
assigned to judges like BUCKNILL or
JELF J.J., as to the man specially
designed by Providence and Lord
HALsbury for the purpose.
The question of the work assigned
to each of the Judges for perform-
ance is nearly equalled in importance
by the problem of where they are to
be put to perform it. As our readers
know, during the last term accom-
modation was found for one Judge in
Lincoln's Inn Hall, and for another
in a temporary structure in the Cen-
tral Hall. But surely this state of
things cannot be permitted to con-
tinue. The other Judges, it is said,
are extremely annoyed that two of
their brethren are given such legiti-
mate opportunities for grumbling,
whilst they have to fall back upon
the time-worn complaints that their
courts are not theatres, and that the
ventilation is wrong anyway.
Several leading “silks " are
amongst those who have promised
to take part in the forthcoming
London pageant. It is not yet
known what parts are to be assigned
to them, but the report that Mr.
DANckwerts, K.C., has refused to
represent one of the Princes who
were murdered in the Tower is cer-
tainly premature.
The rumour that in future Mr.
HALL CAINE will write, for The Daily
Mail, descriptive articles of all our
more engaging criminal cases has
aroused the activity of the Criminals'
Protection Association. It is pro-
posed to take steps to put an end to
this practice as tending to encourage
undue competition in crime.

MEDITATIONS IN THE “MAMMOTH FUN GITY.”
By a Mild Hypochondriac.
FEELING unusually low this afternoon. Perhaps a
little “Mammoth Fun" may cheer me up. Though,
now I come to think of it, Mammoths' notion of genuine
fun must have been rather rudimentary.
Am in Fun City. Military band, several orchestrions
connected with “Razzle-dazzles,” and musicians be-
longing to Morocco Willage, all in full blast. I suppose a
Mammoth would find it stimulating. Somehow it de-
presses me.
Discover Circus going on in Main Hall. Stand in
outer ring and see Show for nothing—from prudence, not
parsimony. Easier to go away as soon as I've had
enough of it. Mons. EMILIONE is introducing Baby
Elephant and Horse. Elephant evidently attached to
Horse, but only Horse's high breeding enables him to
conceal his strong antipathy to Elephant. How like so
many human companionships | Must resist this ten-
dency to melancholy . . . Baboon, irreproachably
turned out in shiny hat, blue coat, white cords and top
boots, is riding donkey over fences. His seat is perfect
—he even looks round at Ring-master while taking
jumps. If I attempted this I should come off. And
yet I don't suppose that Baboon has had anything like
§: fluention and advantages I've had. Humiliating,
this
Clown in ring now, with Boxing Kangaroo. Clown, I
can't help thinking, too serious over it. Still, if I were
called upon to box with a Kangaroo, I should be serious.
Much too fond of sparring with its hind-leg. . . .
Young lady cyclist has just turned back-somersault,
sitting, from saddle of her bicycle to that of another
just behind her. To think that I possess a vote, while
she is denied all voice in the government of her country
That's the worst of circuses—they give one such a sense
of one's own incompetence.
Circus over. However, plenty of other amusements.
Might visit the Great Morocco Willage, to begin with.
Some Touareg women (at least I assume they are
Touaregs), their eyes and teeth flashing in their burnt-
almond faces, are sitting by the entrance, with tiny
fuzzy-headed Touaregs at their knees. A coal-black
native (who may be a Mehari, for all I know) is gazing
entranced at the dancing in front of a Cinematograph
Show. Perhaps it represents his idea of a Mohammedan
Paradise. Another Mehari is seated motionless on
camel. Something supercilious and sneering about this
camel's expression, as if it didn't consider entertain-
ment inside worth the extra sixpence. And yet surely
instructive to see these Saharan tribes, with all their
“Curious Rites,” their “Devil Dance,” and so on. Of
course they would be no novelty to a camel. But
suppose I went in and found myself the only visitor?
So uncomfortable to be looking on, all alone, at a Devil

Dancel Can't explain it, but, on catching the camel's
eye once more, find it has put me off. For the present,
at all events. I can always come back. . .
There is at least one person here as lonely as myself l
At the end of a small enclosure I find a painted canvas
frame with two oval holes in it. Through one of these
I observe a portion of a dusky countenance (burnt-
corked, I think), and a gleaming eye which regards me
with a certain wistfulness. For a penny, so I gather
from the placard, the owner of that eye will put his
head through the hole and allow me the privilege of shy-
ing three hard wooden balls at him. None of the public
seems to be patronising him, and I am sure he feels
it. Shall I have a penn'orth—just to encourage
him 2 It would be a humane action—for I'm not likely
to hit him—and yet I cannot bring myself to cockshot
a fellow-creature in cold blood, even for Charity's sake
So I pass on. He was beginning to have hopes of me,
and I have failed him |
Come upon “ Oscillating Staircase,” all the steps of
which are joggling violently up and down. You can
climb up and down them as much as ever you please.
It is only threepence. If I was quite sure it would ex-
hilarate me I might; but no, better not—it isn't so very
long since I lunched. . .
Join a group that has collected round a low platform.
They are mostly school-children, and are staring at the
“Turkish Tom Thumb,” as he sits in a tiny wicker
chair, selling photographs of himself on postcards.
Whenever his attention is called away the children look
at one another and suppress a giggle. Then, as he turns
round, they resume their preternatural solemnity with
extraordinary suddenness. There is no charge for seeing
him. I gaze at him, too—but (I hope) without rudeness.
The T. T. T. takes no notice of any of us. He merely
hands the postcards and pockets the pennies for them
with silent and impassive dignity. He can hardly be
three feet high, and yet he makes me feel insignificant
beside him. . If I had to sit there, selling my own por-
traits in a circle of saucer-eyed children, should I pre-
serve the same magnificent air of detachment? I doubt
it. And, small as he is, he can converse, as a novice
informs me, in no less than seven languages, while I
can't always converse even in my own However, he
is a silent little polyglot at present. I feel I ought to
make some remark, and draw him out, but I don’t know
—so difficult to begin. Anything in the nature of a
platitude would be fatal. And I know those confounded
children would begin giggling again. I pass on once
more. After all, if I had spoken he might have snubbed
me. - -
Arrive at “Katzenjammer Castle.” Almost tempted
to go in. Advertisement outside assures me that
“everybody comes out laughing,” and I notice several
people leaving with, at all events, the after-glow of a
grin on their faces. Dut what if Mammoth Fun inside
took the form of practical joking? On reflection, stay
outside. Still, I do wish sometimes that I had just a
little more enterprise ! . . . .
Another gratuitous show. . Two Indian Jugglers on
small stage, performing basket trick with native boy.
Cannot imagine how so stout a youth manages to dispose
of himself while juggler is jumping on basket and prod-
ding all round with sword; but it can’t be comfortable
for him. And what an existence—to be perpetually
compressed into a basket of limited dimensions,
to lie curled up like a whiting at the bottom, while a
sharp sword is poked all round, then to be painfully ex-
tracted, and go through it all over again There must
b3 moments when he longs for a larger, free-er life I
Wander on, in search of something to raise my
spirits. . .
Shall I put down a penny and take a rod in the
“Electric Fishpond "? The first who lands six metal
fish wins a prize. People of all ages are angling with
enthusiasm. I've a good mind to join them. . . I
should have, too, if only the voluble j who presides
over the competition hadn't pressed me to try my luck
before I was quite ready. But I am no fisherman—very
likely I shouldn't have won anything. And if I had,
would the mere accident of contriving to hook six metal
fish before anyone else have dispersed my gloom for
long? . . . Hardly, I fear. . . What shall I do
next? Might try to find a person of the name of
“JoHNSON.” My official programme contains a photo-
graph of him, and says he is here in disguise, and if I
can only recognise him and bring him captive to the
Exhibitions Advertising Co. they will give me £20 in
exchange for a Token he is carrying. When I come
across him I've merely to ask, “Are you Johnson 2 ”
and he will own up. Chance for enterprise here; but how
if I recognise somebody who isn't Johnson 2—might
end in awkward scene. And if I did succeed in spotting
him, I should look such an ass leading him captive.
don't even know where to lead him to, and a crowd
would be sure to collect. No, I haven't seen anyone in
the least like the photograph yet; but if I did I really
believe I should look another way. Even £20 may be
earned too dearly . . . -
I have spent three hours here; but I am still de-
pressed. . Which is odd, because everybody else seems
to be enjoying Mammoth Fun immensely. Perhaps a
mistake to come here and mammoth all by myself. It's
not as if I were in the mood for mammothing either. I
think I will go straight home now, and take my tonic.

THE FAIRY.
“IF you gobble your food as fast as that
You'll choke, and there 'll be an end of you;
It 'll stick in your throat, and you 'll die—that 's flat—
And your mother and I don't want you to.”
But four-and-a-half, she seemed resigned,
And she spoke in a tone that was pert and airy:
“Good gracious,” she answered, “I don’t mind;
I've always wanted to be a fairy.”
Then, murmuring half to herself, she said,
“I shall fly about with a pair of wings;
I shall never, no never, go to bed;
I shall eat a lot of the nicest things.
There 'll be jam for breakfast and jam for tea;
I shall never wear goloshes or mittens;
And Polly, the parrot, will come with me,
And John, the dog, and the tabby kittens.
“I think we shall have no end of fun,
With any amount of dolls and arks,
And a chocolate-cake and a currant-bun,
And a bottle of glue—it will be larks
But ’’—here she wrinkled her baby brow--
“You must both come, too, and we'll fly together;
And it 's rather cold for a fairy now,
So I think I'll wait till it 's summer weather.”

“A Constant Reader ’’ writes to a
contemporary: —
“Sir, In a heated discussion recently, in
which I took part, the subject being ‘Who is
the most popular novel writer (English-speak-
ing) in the World,' we could not come to a
satisfactory conclusion. Being a constant
reader of ‘The Daily News,' it was decided
that I should write and ask the opinion of ‘The
Daily News' readers.”
If our idea as to who will be voted
the most popular novelist be correct,
would it not be a kindly act on the
part of The Daily News, in emulation
of another journal, to offer him (or
her) a free trip to some remote
country?

Professor ARTHUR KAMPF, of
Munich, in discussing picture for-
geries, has, according to The Sunday
Times, made the interesting state-
ment that “art swindlers existed as
far back as 400 years, and that at
that period plenty of false Rem-
brandts were offered to the public.”
This gives one some idea of the
devilish cleverness of these fellows.
That they should have been able to
copy the work of REMBRANDT one
hundred years before he was born is
a pretty good testimonial.

The Army Council has decided that

TUNING UP ALL ROUND.
Now that Mr. C. ARTHUR PEARSON
is at last comfortably installed in
his Directorship at the National
Gallery, England may confidently
anticipate a new reputation among
the artistic peoples. “Painted by
hand, are they 2 '' were the first
words of the new Dictator as he
passed through the rooms on his
motor bicycle. “Well, we can show
them something better than that on
our new rollers.” The happy result
is that in place of the antiquated
and outmoded REMBRANDT and
REYNoLDs the walls of the Trafalgar
Square Gallery will very shortly be
bright and gay with three-colour-
process blocks of all the new men and
a number of snappy photographs to
boot. The Misses DARE, we under-
stand, are already preparing an
assortment of new poses for the
National Gallery camera.
Mr. C. ARTHUR PEARson's term
of office at the Mint is expected to
be fraught with some piquant
changes. The old coinage will, it
is conjectured, completely vanish,
with the exception of the half-penny,
which is to be produced day and
night in the interests of newspaper
readers. Mr. PEARson's revolution
embraces the supersession of the
sovereign and the introduction of a
new coin to be known as the nimble
ninepence.
Rumours to the contrary notwith-
standing, it is now pretty clear that
the inventor of missing word com-
petitions who is to take over the
control of the Zoo is Mr. C. ARTHUR
PEARSON. In fact that gentleman
admitted as much in an interview
yesterday. “I do not deny it,” he
said, “nor do I affirm it.” One
thing is certain, and that is that
if Mr. PEARSoN has his way the Zoo
will be a very different place. None
of the slower animals will be allowed
to remain at all, the sloth being the
first to get notice. The snakes will
have to grow arms and legs, or quit.
The camels must lose their humps.

“We cannot carry all that dead-
weight,” were Mr. PEARson's own
words, or ipsissima verba, as they say
at Winchester, the grey old Gothic
school whose motto is “ Hustlynge
makyth hay.”
The financial position of Oxford
and Cambridge has grown so unsatis-
factory of late years that universal
relief has been caused by the public-
spirited and patriotic action of Mr.
C. A. PEARson in accepting the task
of reorganising the two Universities.
The details of this colossal scheme
are not yet published, but we under-
stand that he proposes to effect an
amalgamation of the two institutions
under the title of Cam-Ox University,
the undergraduates to be known in
future as Oxtabs, and that in place
of the annual contest on the Thames
a single boat, manned by representa-
tives of both Universities, will row
against time from Mortlake to
Putney.
Some natural tears were shed at
the Royal College of Music when it
was made known that Sir Hubert
Parry had resigned his directorship
in favour of Mr. C. ARTHUR PEARson,
but already the new régime is work-
ing smoothly and to the perfect con-
tent of all the students. Immense
satisfaction was expressed at the an-
nouncement that in future harmony,
composition and musical history
would disappear from the curriculum,
and that every pupil must take up
the pianola as a first study. Mr.
PEARson has wisely resolved to dis-
pense with the services of all teachers
of singing, and to rely exclusively
on instruction by the gramophone.
With the economies thus effected he
hopes to be able to hold out sufficient
pecuniary inducement to Mr. Sousa
to warrant his joining the staff of
the Royal College as Professor of
Orchestral Playing and Platform
Deportment. Another admirable
feature of the scheme of reor-
ganisation is the provision of in-
struction in a number of interesting
but neglected instruments, such as
the banjo, the ocarina, the Welsh
harp, the penny whistle, the pan
pipes, the post-horn, and the mouth-
organ.
Acute disappointment was experi-
enced in Bloomsbury when it became
known that, owing to his other
engagements, Mr. C. ARTHUR PEAR-
son had reluctantly declined the offer
of the Chief Librarianship of the
British Museum. But this feeling
has been considerably assuaged by
the welcome announcement that the
Trustees have gratefully acted on
Mr. PEARson's suggestion and en-
trusted the post to his gifted col-

Before the day is lit, and (partly) warmed;
The morning fog still stings and blinds the eyes;
By those LAST NoTICEs I'm still alarmed,
In which collectors say naught can content 'em
Now, save a superadded ten per centum.
Even my tailor, whom I always thought
A man of some originality,
Cites outworn items which he says I bought—

To me it seems indubitably clear
We might as well be living in last year.
With regard to a recent French train robbery we have
the following information from Carmelite House:
“As soon as the six cash boxes in a somewhat battered condition had
been replaced in the van . . .”—Daily Mail.
“The five cash boxes somewhat battered were replaced in the
van . . .”—0ver-seas Daily Mail.
The difference in the number is obviously to save
weight in the over-seas edition.
A contemporary states that “the chief feature of the
December issue [of The University Magazine–McGill
and Toronto Universities] is ‘Ad Universitam,' Mr.
Rudyard KIPLING's characteristic address to the students
of McGill.” Pedantry is abhorrent to Mr. Punch, but
he does hope that a word like Universitam is not really
“characteristic " of Mr. KIPLING's Latinity.

[JANUARY 15, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BREAKING POINT.
I AM suffering from a new disease,
and I seek a remedy.
I grow thin under the infliction.
My nerves are giving way. I am
utterly weary of it.
Its name is HALL CAINE.
There seems to be no escape.
I go to a bookshop, and ask to see
some books, and the shopman in-
sinuates a volume into my hand, Cob-
webs of Criticism, by HALL CAINE.
It is a shrill plea for the sanity of the
mob, and I do not want it.
I am taken to the theatre, and the
play is The Christian, by HALL
CAINE.
I open The Chronicle, and find an
article by a Mr. BEGBIE daring to
question if Mr. HALL CAINE’s
chromo-lithographic view of Christi-
anity is a true one, and asking if
there is not a finer ideal than he
puts before the playgoer. I shudder
as I think of the morrow.
I open The Chronicle again, and
find Mr. HALL CAINE rioting in reply,
the exponent of Christianity once
again resting his case on the plaudits
of the mob, and falling into Billings-
gate over his critic—thus exemplify-
ing his fitness to provide a perfect
example of the Christian ideal for
footlight consumption.
There is a murder case of a pecu-
liarly sordid character. The trial
lasts for several days, the case breaks
down, and the accused man is
acquitted, to the delight of the
mob, who attempt to maltreat one
of the witnesses for the Crown, a
woman. Who is it that from the
well of the court passes up a request
for the prisoner's autograph?" Mr.
HALL CAINE.
I open The Daily Mail, and find
two columns devoted to a high-
pitched character sketch of the ac-
uitted man. Composed by whom 2
y the mob's staunch friend and flat-
terer, Mr. HALL CAINE.
The DRUCE case at last draws near
its end, and the grave is opened, re-
vealing its pathetic secret. At last
it is known, after months of costly
litigation, that there really was a Mr.
T. C. DRUCE, I open The Daily
Mail, and find that the Editor has
received a communication from Mr.
HALL CAINE, so poignant and plain-
spoken that it cannot be printed,
claiming to have known all the time
that intimate fact which has just
come so dramatically to light, and
hinting that before very long his
gifted pen will inflict upon the world
his own version of the whole romance,
either for the reader or the playgoer.
The DRUCE case ends, and the
papers print their reports. I open
The Chronicle, and find a portrait of
Mr. HALL CAINE leaving the court. I
open The Mirror, and find a por-
trait of Mr. HALL CAINE leaving the
court. I open other papers, with the
same result.
I walk along the Strand, and meet
a gaping crowd following a theatrical
figure with long red hair and an opera
cloak. It is Mr. HALL CAINE, at-
tended, I presume, by a bodyguard
of his own darling public, obstructing
the way of modest men.
And I ask where is this going to
stop. Are we to be saddled for ever
with this intrusive pervasive gentle-
man? Is his passion for the limelight
to be gratified for ever? Is it not time
that the closure was ordered, and a
close time for Mr. HALL CAINE pre-
scribed ?
Sherlock Holmeski.
What might have been another in-
explicable “Railway Mystery " has
been happily averted by the shrewd
intuition of The Daily Telegraph’s
Special Correspondent in the Russian
capital. This gentleman wires: “At
noon yesterday, at a station about
370 miles from St. Petersburg, a
sleeping-car took fire, possibly
through the ignition of inflammable
objects there.” The “possibly "
marks a delicate sense of restraint,
but amidst the bewildering mass of
conflicting hypotheses that will rise
to the speculative mind, we believe
that the Daily Tclegraph's Special
Correspondent has hit the right nail
on the head after all.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
DEAR SIR,-As a keen lover of
animals, I wish to enter a vigorous
protest against the almost universal
custom of placing our harmless Pori-
fera domesticata (the common bath
sponge) out on the window-sills
during the present very severe
weather.
Surely the fact that it belongs to
the lowest form of animal life is but a
poor excuse for this inhuman cruelty?
Might not the attention of the Hon.
STEPHEN be drawn to the matter with
advantage, or that of the League
which supplies the bonnets to 'bus
horses? If hunting is stopped by
the frost these gentlemen will possi-
bly have spare time to ameliorate
the condition of the most humble
and at the same time useful of our
dumb friends.
I am, dear sir, yours truly,
A LovER of THE LITTLE
BROWN SPONGE.
SCHOOL OUTFITS.
DEAR, Mr. Punch,-Of course I
know that schoolboys are not sup-
posed to have any feelings—just be-
cause we keep them to ourselves and
don't make a fuss when they 're
trampled on—but I really think that
attention should be called to an
objectionable practice now prevalent
among tradesmen, which is exceed-
ingly painful to us all. All we want
to do is to enjoy our holidays in
peace, and yet the latter half of
them is entirely spoilt by the abso-
lutely indecent way in which the
approach of school is rubbed into us
from all points of the compass by
tradesmen's advertisements. “School
Outfit ’’ circulars pour in upon our
people by every post, and the same
beastly legend is placarded on each
side of every tradesman's van in the
street—even coal carts—and no
tailor's or outfitter's window is con-
sidered complete without a waxwork
show of little swines dressed up in
tweed or Eton suits—“For school
wear.’’
Let grown-up people put it to
themselves. How would a man
who shortly expected to go to prison
like it, for instance, if on every
hoarding he was faced with adver-
tisements for handcuffs or leg-irons?
or, if he was going to have an opera-
tion, how would he feel if his
mothers and aunts insisted on dis-
cussing the prices of surgical
appliances and gravestones in his
presence?
Yours furiously,

BRAMBLE.
PERSONALLY I like Bramble (the
funny man in my new novel). He
is so genuine. And then he says
such extraordinary things. “Do you
never take exercise, Mr. Bramble 2 ''
a friend inquired. “Sometimes I
stretch ' " That is only on page 9. I
rather think he improves later on.
Yet though I #. recognise that
Bramble is one of my most perfect
creations, it is perhaps better that we
should not see quite so much of one
another. To tell you the truth,
Bramble wants all the stage to him-
self. At the beginning of each
chapter, I say, “This is a serious
novel. (A Study in Temperament I
instance, which gives the funeral of
Little Dai. Of course he ought to
be there, having kept her alive four
days with his inexhaustible store
(53 pp.) of humour. Still, I think
he overdid it. When I showed that
chapter to GATEs (GATEs writes those
impressionist sketches in The Cere-
bellum) he asked, “Why not bury
Little Dai between Chapters XI.
and XII. 2 Then Bramble would be
late for the funeral.’’
I must get rid of Bramble.
Chapter XIV. shaped up much
better than I expected. There was
a little trouble with B. at first. But
after I had let him have twenty-one
pages to give his experiences of buy-
ing a dog, he went to the Club or
-
story. Look how I behaved over the
funeral too ! But there 's SPooner—
a fellow who reads Slaps; and WHITE-
HEAD–a poor creature with no sense
of humour. They say— Oh, it's
too terrible ! Of course there 's no
need for you to suffer unnecessarily.
Just about half a paragraph. Then
—“a peaceful smile lit up the calm
features; but the lips did not move.”
I expect it will upset me for the rest
of the day.
Unless—I hardly like to mention
it. But Spooner suggested it.
“Supposing he had some terrible
affliction,” Spooner said, “ some-
thing that would force him to re-
nounce humour once and for all.”
You remember the tale of HENRY and
am going to
describe it.)
Bramble is a
fun ny man.
There is no deny-
ing it. He is a
funny man. His
duties are clear.
'To relieve by a
few humorous
touches the tense
emotions of the
reader.' But no-
thing about stay-
ing in for three
chapters,is there?
No, Bramble,
you must keep
out of it for a
page or two.”
And does he?
Well, the fact is,
I am afraid that
Bert Pleydell
(hero) is not
pushing enough.
He gives way to
Bramble so. It
is like this.

shy advances. Bert thinks it over.
Angy's advances become more notice-
able. Bert, suddenly fired with pas-
sion, pours forth 1,500 words of
tumultuous—or at least he should do.
What usually happens is that after
Bert has been at it for a paragraph or
so he cools down—wants to analyse
his emotions and all that kind of thing.
I tear up his speech, take a clean
sheet of paper and— Then I re-
member that tale I heard at
Scarboro' last year. And there is
Bramble waiting at my elbow.
I have put Bert off five times
already. Anyway, I start on the
plot to-morrow.
Really Bramble seems to have a
knack of turning up at the most
awkward places. Chapter XII., for
somewhere, and Bert and Angy had
the stage to themselves. Near the
end Bert says, “When we meet in
that To-morrow, and look back into
the black vista of Yesterday, and see
the light of former gladness brighten
the--" I think that was a jolly
lucky idea, my sending Bramble to
the Club.
In future I shall keep Bramble for
the beginnings of chapters only.
I am afraid some of the chapters
are horribly long. To-day I see my
publishers, Messrs. Spooner and
WHITE HEAD.
My dear Bramble ! You must
know that I would do anything
sooner than give you pain. You re-
member how in Chapter III. I pur-
posely cut down Angy's illness be-
cause it clashed with your trout
— like that, I know.
All is well ! There is something
wrong with one of Bramble’s lungs.
(Never heard of a funny man having
lungs before. But that shows how
original are my ideas.) He is saved.
But he must leave for the Cape at
the end of Chapter XXII.
Most of the characters were down
at Old Swan Pier—ah! I must alter
that—to see Bramble off. As the
liner swung into mid-stream B.
waved his hat and shouted, “Not
good-bye! Not good-bye!” (He
was thinking of my next novel.)
Now I can arrange for Beauchamp's
suicide.
It was a good idea of mine to send
Bramble off before the suicide. But
I missed him horribly at the inquest.
A very dull affair.
Something wrong with Bert. He

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Younger Set (Constable) is Mr. R. W.
CHAMBERs's second adventure in the romance of modern
American Society, and it is an extremely good story.
Its best situation is the accidental meeting of a divorced
couple. The looseness of the marriage-knot over there
seems to be a source of great embarrassment to New
York hostesses; you never can remember who has been
separated from whom. A pity that the author should
have spoilt the consistency of his methods by a com-
monplace episode out of melodrama, severing his
Gordian knot with an improbable revolver whose utility is
obvious from quite a long way off. Mr. CHAMBERs is
|-
Bruno's story to the reluctant frogs, and Mr. STONE is
nearly as abrupt in method at the beginning of Scars
(HEINEMANN), for in the first two chapters we are intro-
duced to about a score of characters, with nothing much
to guide us as to their different degrees of importance.
Once we get them sorted out, however, the plot runs
finely. I think this is the author's first novel, and he
has chosen a rather daring subject, for his hero, besides
being an Etonian, a cricketer, and a good fellow all
round, has inherited a very bad kind of homicidal mania.
Moreover, since a great part of the book is occupied with
the careless gaieties of public school and Varsity life the
tragedy is vastly deepened by contrast—as if one should
run across the Pelopidae wearing morning coats in Bond
Street. I feel bound to mention this rather bad-
tempered Greek family, because Mr. STONE himself dis-
happiest with some of his minor
characters, such as Nina and Drina.
His heroine is almost incredibly vir-
plays a strong academic bias, and two
of his characters even quote HoRACE
at a Christ Church ball. But,
ginal; and his hero is always threat-
ening to become a prig, through no
fault of his own, but just because
the author insists on italicising his
probity and manliness—qualities that
are best illustrated without com-
ments from the showman. In the
same way some of his characters pro-
test too much that their society is
“thoroughbred,” a dreadful epithet
which good-breeding, taking itself
for granted, can always afford to
dispense with.
Mr. CHAMBERs has a great resource
of language; but he is too facile, and
should set himself to curb both the
volume and the flamboyancy of his
eloquence. I am glad to note that
in his present novel he has checked
a bad habit of sneering ignorantly at
English manners. He makes only a
single reference to us, and so com-
mits only one error in this connec-
tion. There is talk of an American
duchess leading an “Insular inva-
whether it is owing to admiration of
the classic drama or not, he has cer-
tainly given us a very awe-inspiring

DEAR RICHARD,--I know you like
to hear of a good joke now and then
that you can sketch for your paper.
Now this really happened. The old
sexton at Little Pipley, old Joe
GREEN, is a bit of a character, and
his wife, who was the Thornby
Lodge gardener's wife before she
married GREEN, is rather a crotchety
old body, and old JoE you must know
is a bit too fond of his drop on a
Saturday night, and the old lady
being of the Thornby JENKINson
stock and of course a strict T.T.,
when her worthy spouse goes off to
the Black Swan with his boon com-
panions, or rather I should say when
he comes home again, the domestic
felicity of the GREEN household is
wont to become somewhat ruffled;
in fact, the old couple have words.
Well, one Sunday morning after one
of these rows the Vicar and old JoE
ran across one another close by the
broken spout on the north side of
the church—you know the spot—
and said, “Well, JoE, you 're look-
ing very grave this morning. I hope
there 's nothing the matter at home,”
or ‘‘the matter with MARTHA,”
or something like that. So old Joe
turned round, with one of those
knowing winks of his, I expect, and
said, “I wish she was in HER
grave,” and off he stumped to dis-
tribute the collection bags without
another word ' ' ' The Vicar told me
this himself. I should put “A
Fact ’’ on the top if I were you.
Everybody I have told it to has
been immensely amused at it. Mind
you get the broken spout in.
Believe me, your affec. uncle,
JAMES C. HEvyTHWAITE.
P.S.—We must have you down
here when your picture of the joke
comes out, so let me know what
week it will be.
First Answer (burnt).
Chelsea.
DEAR UNCLE JAMEs.-Thanks for
kindly sending me the story about
JoE GREEN and the Vicar. I will try
it on the Editor; but it is very diffi-
cult to tell exactly what they will
like, so I hope you won't be disap-
pointed if it doesn't appear. Very
likely they may have another
sexton joke on hand with a draw-
ing already done; or for a number
of reasons it might be inconvenient
to put it in. If they should happen
not to accept it, you might send
it to GEORGE, and he could turn
it into a short story for one of the
magazines. I should like very much
to go down to Rolling and see you
all again. Would some time next
month suit you?
Second Answer (sent).
MY DEAR UNCLE JAMEs. – Many
thanks for that capital joke of yours.
I can just imagine old Joe's face.
I shall be delighted to accept your
kind invitation for the early part of
next month, which is about the time
the joke would appear. Love to
everyone.
Your affectionate nephew,
Dick.

A CAND DATE FOR AN OLD AGE PENSION.
As down a country lane I strode,
With sweet and rural thoughts inspired,
I saw a tramp beside the road
Who looked a little tired.
Upon the ditch's marge he lay,
And, as I read his visage clear,
Something within me seemed to say,
“This man is full of beer.’’
I progged him gently in the side :
“What is your story? I would know.”
“I’m Weary WILLIE,” he replied,
Adding the words “What O !”
“A simple, homely name,” said I;
“Myself, when still a tender brat,
Was so addressed for short. But why,
Why ‘Weary'? Tell me that.
“Is it excess of manual toil,
Followed by mental strain, perhaps,
With burning of the midnight oil,
That causes this collapse 2''
He answered with a pleasant smirk:
“Don’t go and fret yourself, ole pal;
I never done a stroke o' work,
Not me, nor never shall.’’
“You labour not,” I said, “and yet
Men call you ‘Weary '2 Pray suggest
How you acquired this epithet
Implying lack of rest."
“That's right,” he said; “I earn no wage;
It 's just the hangin' round about
Waitin' to touch a ripe old age
That fairly wears me out.
“I’ive bob a week for bed and board
If I can only keep alive
To get the Government's reward
For reaching sixty-five.
“Yus, Weary WILLIE 's got ſo wait
Some thirty years, poor patient bloke,
To pouch his pension. Tell yer, mate,
Me 'eart is well-nigh broke ”
I ventured: “Do not deem me rude,
But how do you expect, my son,
To win your country's gratitude
For duties left undone?'"
“The Rads,” he answered, “run the show;
No questions asked about the past;

SWANS IN ADVANCE.
(An Exercise in the New Advertising.)
MR. LoNG JANE begs to inform his patrons that he will
open the Publishing Season by starting four new Authors
from The Oddly Read, viz.:-
A NEW ARISTOPHANES F. J. Gander
A NEW CLASSIC 0. I. E.
A NEW SAINTE-BEUWE R. A. Gosling
A NEW SHAKSPEARE L. Anser GREEN THOUGHTS
Mr. LONG JANE believes that these books are more
than perfect, and will run through the season, or at
least part of it. The following are the particulars:–
I. The New Aristophanes.
By this title the publisher confidently designates Mr.
F. J. GANDER, the author of Love and the Tinsmith, a
work full of the robustious essence of Twentieth-Century
Humour. What the great satirist, wit and jester ARIsto-
PHANES did for the gay pleasure-lovers of ancient Rome,
that will Mr. GANDER do for all those readers in our own
day who, like the publisher, possess what has been called
the fourth of the great cardinal virtues—Humour. Make
a note of Love and the Tinsmith, to be published on
January 29 by the new ARISTOPHIANEs.
II. The New Classic.
The publisher is conscious that it is unusual, except
among publishers, to hail a new writer as a classic, but
Sir Thomas BRowNE, PATER, R. L. S., W. J. Locke, and
Mr. Money-Coutts were once new writers, and he
claims for O. I. E. (those being the initials under which
his latest discovery wishes to conceal his identity) that
he has written a book worthy to be placed along with
the writings of such authors, and worthy also to be placed
with any writer of antiquity that can be named, not
excepting the divine PLATo. Mackenzie Redivivus
by O. I. E. (ready January 29, price 7s. 6d. net) may by
some be voted precious. It is certainly intimate, like all
the best books, yellow or otherwise. But discerning
critics will see its masterly power and delicacy, and
appreciate its new style, from which the publisher has
already learnt much. It stands apart from all other
books, not only because it is published at The Oddly
Read, in itself a hall-mark of distinction, but also by
reason of its truth, its soul-battlings, in a word its
classicalness. Remember the author's initials, O.I. E.
III. The New Sainte-Beuve.
We come now to the amazing critical work of Mr.
Gosli NG, author of Romance and Modernism, that
astounding collection of penetrating search-lights. What
do you think Mr. Gosling does? He takes a few con-
spicuous tendencies of the age—the scientific spirit, self-
consciousness, democracy, realism, pessimism, effron-
tery, bombast, and so forth, with which all of us are
acquainted—and shows how almost every new book may
be regarded as a symptom of health or disease in the
social organism. He does really. The publisher has
called Mr. Gosling the new SAINTE-BEUve, but he might
equally well have called him the new MATTHEw ARNold.
By whatever name his wonderful book (to be published
on January 29—the red letter day of the year—price
7s.6d. net) is called it would smell as sweet.
IV. The New Shakspeare.
Some weeks ago the well-known Editor of a distin-
guished weekly declared he had discovered a new poet—
a real genius. On his being asked if the poet's name
was ANSER, his astonished reply was “Yes.” “I
thought so,” was the retort; “I have just accepted a

the most distinguished living writers wrote me a sponta-
neous letter drawing attention to Mr. ANSER as ‘not only
a poet, but a poet of very great and original powers. . . .
I mean, this is really that rara avis, a man of genius.'''
Could coincidence farther go? Other equally distin-
guished persons with the same spontaneity having said
similar things, the publisher has no longer any hesitation
in calling Mr. ANSER the new SHAkspEARE. Note the
date of the publication of Mr. ANSER's book, Green
Thoughts—January 29. O that day ! What a day for

Mr. LoNG JANE will be happy to give them. His stock

THE HOLLOW REED.
WHAT was it doing, my gold-nibbed Pen,
Here in the Fleet by the river,
Turning my tablecloth into a fen,
Scattering ruin and casting blots,
Till the cream-laid note was covered with spots,
Like a man that is cursed with a liver?
Something had clogged my gold-nibbed Pen,
In its secret chamber lurking;
The blue-black liquid was deep in my den,
And pages of lyrics were floating about,
And the blotting-paper had all run out,
Ere I got the reservoir working.
I took it to pieces, my gold-nibbed Pen
(How silly it looked in sections !);
I twisted the top, like the neck of a hen,
And scraped it clean with a hard bleak knife,
And filled it over The Sporting Life
And the “Saturday League Selections.”
This is the way, I said, O Pen
(And I laughed low down in my gizzard),
And the chances are only a couple in ten
To make your insolent humours stop;
And, putting my mouth to the hole at the top,
I blew like a prairie blizzard.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pen,
Is a pipe with wads of cotton;
And oh! how I wished you had been one then
For the poignant shock of the draught I drank,
As I inadvertently sucked your shank,
Is a thing I have never forgotten.
A downright beast was my gold-nibbed Pen;
And although my aunt (the giver)
Would probably murmur “Just like men,”
And shed for the cost of the thing a tear,
I have chucked it away by the Waterloo Pier,
From the parapet into the river.

THE COMPLETE CONVERSATIONALIST.
“Do you reverse?” asked my
partner.
“We will, if you're keen,” I said;
“but as a matter of fact I generally
get a back-fire when I put in the
reverse. If you like we'll throw out
the clutch for a moment.”
“That would be a good idea,” she
said; “and, when you put it back
again you might put it back a little
bit higher up, if you don't mind. And
perhaps it would be as well if we got
on to the second speed. . . . Thank
you, that 's much better.”
We went round the room twice
under the new conditions, and then
steered into the garage.
“What about a little petrol?” I
suggested.
“Oh, no thanks.”
“. No petrol. Well, let 's find a
cool place, and talk. It 's so hot
here.”
We discovered an excellent draught
and sat down in it, while I fanned
myself—I mean my partner—vigor-
ously.
“Shall we talk about the DRUCE
case ?'' I said.
“Oh, please not.”
“. Right you are. Only I thought I
ought to ask you. Ripping—I mean
rotten weather, isn't it?”
“What?”
“The weather is rather rotten.”
“Oh, I think it 's rather nice.”
“That was what I said first. Rip-
ping weather. Which is your favour-
ite waltz? ''
“I'm not quite sure.

* - Oh.”
There was a short interval for
meditation.
“Do you
here? ''
4 - No.”
‘‘I always think that when you
only know a few people it's rather
rotten–I mean ripping.”
-- Yes.”
“There ought to be,” I said,
having, thought the matter out very
carefully, “some fun when Parlia-
ment meets again.”
'' I suppose so,” said my partner.
I blew my nose for a moment.
“Have you tried,” I asked anxi-
ously, “this new Auction Bridge?
Not that
know many people
I tried again.
They say it 's better than the
ordinary game.”
“Oh 2 ''
"Yes. So they say. Have you
had any skating lately?”
“Oh yes.”
“Yes. You'll let me know when
I'm getting warm, won't you? The
Test matches are rather exciting,
aren't they?”
“What did you say?”
“We’re up to T now. Test
matches. Are you interested in the
Test matches 2 ”
“I don't quite understand.”
“I am trying to find your subject,
and I don't think you're helping me
much. Did I ask you if you had
seen The Merry Widow "
“I really don't know.”
“Then we shall probably get to
that under W. I say—do tell me—
are we going to talk, or aren't we?”
My partner smiled for the first
time.
“I rather thought you had been
talking,” she said.
“Yes, but you aren't helping at
all. If I've got to talk by myself all
the time I'd much sooner recite a
small piece to you. Or if you've got
a box of matches on you I can show
you a trick.”
My partner woke up suddenly.
“I’m very sorry I have been
so dull,” she said, “and I wish I had
a box of matches on me; but if you
only knew how tired a girl gets of
being asked which is her favourite
waltz, and what she thinks of the
DRUCE case, you would forgive me.”
“I am very sorry I have been so
voluble,” I said: “and I wish you
had a box of matches on you, because
it 's a really good trick; but if you
only knew how tired a man gets of
being expected to ask a girl which is
her favourite waltz, and what she
thinks of the DRUCE case, you would
pity me.’’
“Then all these awful questions
were for my sake entirely?”
“Entirely. Particularly the one
about Parliament. I never spoke to
any of the others about that; it was a
special line for you. You know, it
was an awful shock to me when you
refused to talk about the DRUCE case.
I was in despair for the moment.
Luckily I thought of the weather.
We agreed it was ripping weather,
didn't we ?”
“As a matter of fact,” said my
partner, “I know somebody who has
a cousin whose gardener has shares in
the DRUCE Company, so I am really
very much interested in it all. But,
as I told my other fourteen partners,
I have been to eleven dances since
Christmas, and there are limits. May
I have my fan back before you break
it 9 ''
“I'm afraid I mistook your char-
acter altogether,” I said. “You
know there are three ways of making
conversation at a dance. You talk
about , the DRUCE case and your
favourite waltz—that 's one; or your-
self—that 's two; or anything that
comes into your head—that 's three.
You wouldn't give me a lead so I had
to have a dash. Unfortunately I hit
upon the first.”
“You’ll have to try again, won't
you?”
“I suppose I shall. Let's take
the next method. Would it interest
you to hear that I am a drysalter?”
“Is that a good thing to be?”
“I don't know. It sounds such a
thirsty profession. And that I am a
hundred and four, and was educated
at Giggleswick and Gonville, and
have seventeen brothers, and can
catch it two hundred and thirty-
eight times?”
“It is most frightfully exciting,
certainly,” said my partner, “only
as I shall never see you again after
this waltz > y
“Quite so. Then we pass on to
the third method, and I say anything
that comes into my head.”
“Well? "
“Well, then—may I have the next
dance?” A. A. M.

“What is Fame?” is said to have
been the despairing cry of Mr. THAw

THAW case before,
Lord DELAMERE, the big game
hunter, has made the following state-
ment to an interviewer:—“East
Africa is a wonderful country, but
please make it clear that I do not
advise emigration. It is not a coun-
try for small people.” The paper
which publishes the interview then
goes on to give us some idea of the
size of Lord DELAMERE, telling us
that he is farming 100,000 acres near
Nairobi, “and holds 1,200 head of
cattle and 15,000 sheep.” This is,
indeed, a wonderful arm-stretch.

“Mr. Plowden (to witness): Ah, I am afraid

some other things ladies would like to get, but
they have not come yet. (A laugh.)”
Now what we want to know is this:
Why only one laugh? What were
the rest of the officials doing? Surely
they were committing contempt of

The War Office officials, against

this is a pity; it will tempt ladies

their husbands to cast ugly looks at

THE THIRD TEST MATCH. .
(By Cablegram.)
Adelaide, Friday, 12.15 P.M.
The Englishmen have taken the
field. With the exception of FANE,
IHUTchings, CRAW Ford, Hobbs,
GUNN, BARNEs, HUMPHRIES, and
FIELDER, they have all recovered from
their recent exertions. The heat is
tremendous. It will suit the Corn-
stalks, who should win.
5.20 P.M.
England undoubtedly holds the ad-
vantage. HILL is seriously indis-
posed. BRAUND, RHODEs, and HARD-
sTAFF have slight touches of sun-
stroke. Will it get hotter? HILL is
Worse.
Saturday, 12.30 P.M.
The thermometer is already 104 in
the shade. Will it go on rising?
CLEM HILL is in bed. Three doctors
are holding a consultation. Australia
cannot escape defeat.
6 P.M.
The luncheon interval was pro-
longed while the players had their
| temperatures taken. A chart will be
published. Twenty-two certificated
i masseurs have arrived. England is
playing grimly. CLEM HILL's condi-
tion is serious. Roy HILL is fielding.
England must win.
Monday, 5.30 P.M.
A great sensation has been caused
to-day. McAlistER seemed pro-
foundly satisfied when given out
l.b.w. CLEM HILL is no better. Roy
HILL fielded brilliantly this morning.
The heat is terrible. Australia has
no chance.
Tuesday, 2.30 P.M.
CLEM HILL is much worse. The
doctors are giving up hope.
4 P.M.
CLEM HILL is batting magnificently.
Frequent delays have been caused
to-day by players retiring to be
massaged. Owing to strike of mas-
seurs the luncheon interval was again
prolonged.
5 P.M.
HiLL has been missed at mid-off.
In his effort to catch the ball BARNEs
broke his flask of ammoniated
quinine. The game was delayed
while, he changed. Much sympathy
was felt for BARNEs. The thermo-
meter registers 109. A large crowd
is watching it. Will it continue to
rise? HILL's doctors have held three
consultations in the last hour. The
Englishmen cannot hope to win.
5.45 P.M.
A tent has been erected near the
wickets for the convenience of HILL's
medical attendants. Much time is
consequently saved. A large crack
has appeared on the pitch.
9 P.M.
The pitch has been massaged and
treated with cold-cream.
Wednesday, 2.30 P.M.
Consternation prevailed this morn-
ing. The umpires asked if they were
paid by the match or by the day.
FIELDER is in bed to-day. He hopes
to make a hundred to-morrow.
BARNEs was also anxious to rest, but
could not be excused. A collection is
being made for CLEM HILL.
6 P.M.
The collection for CLEM HILL has
amounted to thirty-three clinical
thermometers, seven sponges, and a
bottle of emulsion. Some unpleasant-
ness has been caused by Roy HILL
asking for a share. FANE's tempera-
ture is sub-normal. The game has
made little progress lately. By how
many runs will Australia win? Roy
HILL did not bat.
Thursday, 1.30 P.M.
CLEM HILL has not fielded to-day.
It is nice to see Roy HILL again. The
thermometer is 115. The end came
quite suddenly. FIELDER made one.
This was very disappointing after his
illness.

BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
(NEw STYLE.)
THE Turbine has just celebrated
the second anniversary of its first
appearance in the crowded arena of
journalism, and, as the result of des-
patching a number of telegrams to
well-known people, is in the happy
position of being able to publish
many spontaneous messages from its
well-wishers. These tributes to the
extraordinary longevity of a paper
which has unflinchingly striven to
advocate Liberal principles in their
most acute and uncompromising
form are not unnaturally a source of
profound satisfaction to the conduc-
tors of this journal.
Sir H. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN : —
I consider The Turbine to be by far
the best penny Liberal morning paper
published in London.
Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN (Poet Lau-
reate):—
I raise my glass, brimming with
sparkling Vouvray,
To hail the genius of the Street of
Bouverie.
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL : —
Your paper is sorely needed in
Central Africa. Why not start
special editions for the Pygmies and
the Cannibals?
Miss CHRISTABEL PANKHURST :—
Male journalism does not º to
me. But if I were a miserable man
I suppose I should subscribe to The
Turbine. -
Mr. NAT Gould :-
I have seen many two-year-olds,
but none with an action quite like
that of The Turbine.
The H on. CHARLEs
F.R.S. :— -
Best wishes. I hope you will be
able to knock a few more knots out of
the tangled skein of party politics.
Mr. CHARLEs FROHMAN : —
Presents his congratulations.
Mlle. ADELINE GENéE.
I am never génée when I read your
sparkling criticisms.
Mr. H. BEERBOHM TREE : —
Hearty congratulations. But I
wish you would change the title to
The Treebune.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER:—
Heaven prosper your splendid
efforts and those of your noble con-
tributor, Mr. G. R. SIMs, to promote
the cause of social reform.
PARsons,
Professor ELIE METschinikoff : —
I am greatly interested in an anni-
versary which proves that you have
achieved longevity without senility.
ZBYsco, the famous Galician ath-
lete :-
You is a great paper.
with your leaders daily.

A Sincere Well-wisher writes:–
How time does fly! It seems only

columns is the dramatic gossip by
the frolicsome W. A. Whatever
other changes you may be contem-
plating, my daughters and I implore
you to retain him.

I like everything about you but
your whiskers. One ought not to

Please quickly renew your six-

you many happy returns of the day.

THE WINTER DAY.
THis little space of misty winter day,
How like a flash it goes;
From its late rising to its early close,
How swift it passes and is rolled away;
Yet we can make it hold -
All new delights and high enchantments old,
And children's voices, and their pretty sport,
The keener, being short;
The while
With winsome smile
And song and laugh, in mere excess of joy,
The noisy troop their little limbs employ;
And, though the sun, the pale and hazy sun,
Hangs low beyond the hill,
And the north wind blows chill,
They brook no rest as o'er the white-rimed lawn they run.
And now it comes,
The breakfast-time of birds,
The chosen moment for the scattered crumbs
And due enticing words.
And soon a feathered riot is afoot,
A dusky welter on the whitened lawn
Of little shapes that from the early dawn
Watched to be sure of this their daily loot:
Thrushes, and blackbirds, and a jostling crowd
Of bob-tailed purple starlings, and a cloud
Of sparrows, and that high aristocrat
In red and brown,
The comfortable, fat,
Round robin who looks down,
Hopping apart, on all this eager noise
And these too fevered crumb-devouring joys.
And next on the frozen marsh at ease
We glide on our gleaming skates,
While some of us cut our Q.'s and threes,
And some of us cut our eights;
And some of us scrape and others scratch,
While ever the surface rings
To the swift appeal
Of the sharp-edged steel,
And even a laggard can fairly match
The pace of a pair of wings.
And somebody tries to make a loop,
And doesn't he stagger and twist and stoop !
He throws up his arm, and then goes plump
On the broad of his back with an awful bump.
And still, while the skaters are gliding and toiling,
The little boys keep their pot a-boiling.
And now we 're home to our heart's desire,
A jolly tea and a crackling fire,

THE AUTOCRAT OF THE NINE-
FIFTEEN.
AT first I used to encourage that
Guard's advances. I would offer him
my last night's papers, and buy an
occasional Minstrel Entertainment
ticket; whilst he, in his turn, gave
me much of the earlier history of
Clapham Junction. He was the
fore end of the nine-fifteen. I was
a Second-class Season. So, in a way,
I belonged to him.
In time he grew to assume a certain
amount of authority. “Here you
are, Sir," he would say each morn-
ing. And I knew that he had
selected the compartment in which
he wished me to travel. Sometimes
I changed into another at the next
station. But that annoyed him,
so I gave it up.
Now, if I have a weakness, it is for
an empty smoker. It is a silly fancy,
I know—but there it is. But he
liked me to have plenty of young
society. If there happened to be a
compartment containing nine school-
girls anywhere in the train, he would
find it for me. Failing this, he
favoured a corner seat opposite the
Ladies’ Working Guild. You have
probably never heard of the Guild.
The L. W. G. was about twenty-
seven, tall, brown hair. She always
did crochet. Always the same pat-
tern. I believe she was working a
lawn cover.
Of course I ought to have put my
foot down and insisted on an empty
smoker—every Monday, let us say.
But I kept on putting it off. “After
my holidays,” I said. Then, “after
His holidays.” While He was away
at Yarmouth, quite frequently I tra-
velled in a third smoker—a thing
which He would never sanction.
The morning for the blow for free-
dom arrived. I deliberately chose
an empty smoker. I heard the old
familiar voice—“Here you are, Sir.”
My boot was on the footboard. Sud-
denly the train jerked. (He was not
a man to stop at trifles.) The next
I remember, we were passing through
a tunnel, two miles down the line.
I was lying on the seat of a non-
smoker. The L. W. G. was bathing
my head with eau-de-Cologne.
After that I am afraid my action
was indefensible. The Ladies’
Working Guild, and the tunnel, and
the eau-de-Cologne. Three distinct
warnings. A wise man would have
caught the eight forty-five in future.
Of course it does seem a shame to
arrive in town half an hour earlier
than you need. But then, there 's
heaps to see in London. I am con-
Vinced there are dozens of rooms in
the British Museum that I have
never done properly.
As it was, I pitted my strength
against His. “After all, He is only
a guard.” I repeated this sentence
to myself all the way to the station.
“After all, He is only a guard. He
is only a guard. Only a g The
nine-fifteen was late that morning.
I treated Him to a frigid stare. I
entered an empty compartment.
Empty? Comparatively empty, I
should have said. Empty to all
appearances from the outside. She
had dropped a stitch or something of
the kind, and was searching under
the seat. I believe I helped her to
find it. Anyway, I remember, quite
a number of people thought the com-
partment was empty at Raynes
Park.
It was after this that the Guard
first revealed His art. You have no
doubt seen a conjuror force a card.
He holds out the pack and invites
you to take whichever you please.
He pushes the ace of clubs towards
you. You parry. Ace of clubs retires.
“Perhaps the gentleman would like
one from the bottom of the pack.
. . . . Thank you.’’
The ace of clubs
So each morning my Guard forced
the L. W. G. compartment. As the
train steamed in I would carefully
notice position of ace of clubs.
Fourth from guard's-van. Guard
would apparently recommend fifth.
I dodged, meant to jump in sixth,
grew flurried, got on the wrong side
of fifth—ace of clubs again
At the end of three months (per-
haps it was only three weeks really)
she used to open the door and wave
her parasol before the train stopped.
You can't miss a parasol.
Now, I put it to you, there was only
one course open to me after this. I
must miss the nine-fifteen every
other day. “If I see her only three
times a week,” I told myself, “she
will, in time, forget me.” In years
to come we should meet as mere old
friends. “Do you remember those
pleasant little chats we used to
have 2 " I should say. “What In
the nine-fifteen. Shall I ever forget
them 2 '’ “Ah, that reminds me
. . . My wife—The Ladies' Work—
er—Miss SMYLEs.”
Have you ever tried to miss a train
every other morning? You walk to
the station at 75 miles an hour.
Buy a paper and wait while the boy
changes your sovereign. Count the
change twice. Add halfpenny and
ask for gold at the booking-office.
Meet your sovereign again. Listen im-
patiently for train to leave. Ask after
ticket-collector's rheumatism. Arrive
on platform. Nine-fifteen steams into
station. The train you missed was an
empty goods !
Later on I decided to miss two a
week—that is, an average of two. If
I caught five nine-fifteens one week
I would only catch three the next.
Through May this plan answered
pretty well. I was frequently re-
warded for my perseverance by some
such greeting as: “I waved yester-
day. Oh, you missed it. Naughty
boy | And I had some wool to wind.
Never mind. Hold out your hands.”
Through June and July I am afraid
I grew rather slack. For at the end
of the latter month I had still one or
two June trains to miss.
Then—one morning—in August—
I asked her—to-—our Tennis Fête.
I pitted my strength against HIS.
And I have won. For I travel by the
nine-fifteen now—in a smoker. The
Guild (to which I am now a kind of
Treasurer) is no longer a season-
ticket-holder. A strange coldness has
arisen between the Guard and me. I
believe it was over the wedding. He
was there, but right at the back of
the church—in the free seats. Per-
haps He thought He ought to have
given me away.

G. B. S. has sent me
a long and interesting
letter on clothes in
general, and one remark
of his is particularly
worth quoting. He
says, “I agree with a
great many things that
you say and a great
many you do not.” Of
course it would be ex-
traordinary if so great
an authority on dress
agreed with everything
I said; but he goes on
to say that he does not
hold with me as to the
extravagant prices
charged by many West
End tailors. Opinions
may differ as to whether
19s. 11d. for a lounge
suit is too high a price.
A suit made of the very
best superfine sackcloth
suiting, with sandpaper
lining, cut by a first-
class firm, and made
up with the best Secco-
tine, would not be too
dear at 19s. 11d.; but
it is a question whether
you cannot get a suit
that would look as well
and wear as well for
less money.
During the recent
cold spell I was con-
stantly be in g asked,

cheapest and most be-
coming are the “Elec-

well-known Chevelure
Emporium in Albemarle
Street. They are to be
had at all prices and in
all colours, and anyone
calling at any hour and
asking for them will be
warmly welcomed.
I wish to add some-
thing on the subject of
masculine lingerie. It is
quite a mistake to think
the artificial shirt front,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DRURY LANE AGAIN.
Mr. Punch, having done a grave
injustice to the Drury Lane Manage-
ment when he inaccurately asserted
that the Harlequinade was to be dis-
pensed with, commissioned me to pay
penance on his behalf at the shrine of
Pantomime. So I came to supple-
ment my first-night visit; paid like a
true penitent for a stall round the
corner; and proved by my own eyes
the error of Mr. Punch's allegation.
The Harlequinade was distinguished
by, an extraordinary agility, which
failed, however, to stir the audience
very deeply. Perhaps we are all
older than we used to be, children
included, or it may be that the
spectators had exhausted themselves
before my arrival. Certainly there
was little enthu-
tentment. No one is working except
the Engrossing Clerk, and he con-
tinues his methodical copying only
because he feels restless if otherwise
engaged. .
The Junior Clerk, refreshed by his
siesta, thinks that he must do some-
thing, and yet is unwilling to under-
take too great a responsibility.
“THIS INDENTURE,” he writes
therefore, “was made the day of
” So far he feels he may go
without committing himself. Though
he has but a vague idea what an in-
denture may be, experience has
taught him to rely implicitly on that
preface. When every other word in
his drafts has been scratched out,
those words have a thousand times
been allowed to remain. Even in the
unlikely event of their being for once
tried to explain things, but shall
never be so foolish as to try to ex-
plain this. It purports to be a
means of connecting any room in
a building with any other room or
with the general exchange; it appears
to be a mad complication of wires,
plugs and bells; it is only one more
device contrived for the demoralisa-
tion and ultimate destruction of tele-
phone clerks. Now, the Junior Clerk,
besides being the son of Northern
parents, is also a Telephone Clerk.
The Junior Clerk hears the ring
(and the telephone means that he
shall), removes the receiver, arranges
the plugs, and, with the view of
eliciting important information from
some person or persons unknown,
asks, “Are you there?” There is
no answer, so that the Junior Clerk,

THE LIFE OF THE JUNIOR
CLERK.
“THIS INDENTURE,” writes the
Junior Clerk.
It is a Wednesday. The afternoon
is a drowsy if a bright one. The office
(which for the most part has but just
returned from a more than adequate
lunch) is peaceful. There is a blessed
absence of hustle and a welcome
silence prevails over the electric bells.
The speaking-tubes wear an air of
innocence, and even the telephone is
for the moment subdued. The drone
of electric trams in the next street but
one adds to the general feeling of con-
wrong, not he but the person who
detects the mistake will have to find
the right ones. That clinches the
matter, and, adding the word “be-
tween,” the Junior Clerk knows that
he has earned a rest. His thoughts
wander to his aged parents in the
North. How thankful he is that he
is not an orphan I Were he an
orphan, his thoughts would not be
able to wander to his aged parents in
the North. He would in fact have to
go on working, and if there is one
thing that junior clerks hate it is
work.
While he is still engaged in medi-
tating on the possibilities ſº.
and specific) of parents, the telephone
recovers from its apathy and rings its
bell. The instrument is complicated
by an immoral invention known as
the Private Exchange. During
a disastrous career, I have often
change come s
into play, thinking no doubt that the
telephone per se is not an adequate
irritant. When junior clerks do give
way to their passions they are not
particular to a turn or two of the
handle. When Private Exchanges do
make practical jokes, they do their
utmost to make their jokes thorough.
. . . . The Junior Clerk is still turn-
ing, when, purple in the face, the
Senior Partner bursts into the room.
Whatever senior partners cannot
do, they can, at any rate, talk . . . .
The Junior Clerk is still young and
susceptible. Moreover, as there are
five holes and five possible plugs, it
is morally certain that in making his
second selection from the twenty-five
possible combinations he will in his
agitation hit on another wrong 'un.
This time it is the Cashiers’ Depart-
ment, and cashiers are not without a
less subtle but still effective elo-

the

quence. They are, however, much
too busy a class to come down to the
clerks’ office; they expect the clerks
to receive all communications (pro-
fessional and personal) per telephone.
In this instance that expectation is
doomed to disappointment. The
Junior Clerk hurriedly removes all
the plugs, so that no one is now in
communication with anyone else.
The Cashier's affectionate messages
are merely earthed. But on second
thoughts the Junior Clerk determines
that the Cashier is not too great (save
in his own eyes) for the retort which
has just suggested itself. The plugs
are replaced, the bell rung, and voice
given to the Junior Clerk's repulsive
epithets. But the Private Exchange
is one too many for him, and has now
got him through to the Original
Caller.
There are five important facts
about this Original Caller:-(1) He is
an important client. (2) He has been
waiting all this time for an answer
to his original call. (3) The telephone
has just been ringing with some
harshness in his ear. (4) He is a
senior partner himself in another
firm. (5) He is now in direct com-
munication with the Junior Clerk.
These sordid negotiations have
waked the office, and one half wants
the telephone instantly, the other
half wants the Junior Clerk at once.
Neither half hesitates to make its
wants known. The Senior Partner
is still brooding over his wrongs, and
he has come to the conclusion that he
has left things unsaid which he
ought to have said. . He is therefore
ringing his bell for the Junior Clerk.
The Managing Clerk does not like to
seem less busy than anybody else,
and is blowing with all a managing
clerk's impatience and sweet unrea-
sonableness into the Junior Clerk's
whistle. Clamoured for, threatened,
but more especially abused, the
Junior Clerk feels that little is
needed to complete his woes. That
little is at once supplied by the young
lady at the General Exchange.
“Are you there?” she interrupts.
Yes, the Junior Clerk thinks he is
there. “Don’t go away,” she snaps;
and the harangue is continued amidst
the increasing din of bells, whistles
and human shrieks.
+ * + +
It is a Thursday afternoon. The
office, having for the most part re-
turned from a lunch even more
adequate than yesterday's, is at
peace. There is no suggestion of
hustle; and bells, speaking-tubes and
telephone are silent. The drone of
the trams is more soothing than ever,
so that even the Engrossing Clerk is

asleep. The Junior Clerk wakes
gradually, and starts working
leisurely. “This INDENTURE,” he
writes (it is the same indenture),
“was made the day of -
between .” His thought
wander to his maternal grand-
parents in the West. He is just
thanking his stars that his mother
was not an orphan, when the tele-
phone bell rings . . . .
The sporting expert of a Sunday
paper is of the opinion that a certain
; is “ the smartest in the four
emispheres.”. It is a pity to overdo
the thing like this,
AND You MiGHT JUST TALK To THE MAN IN A CARELESS sort of way,
The discoverer of a specific for

action for alleged libel against The
Lancet was surely ill-served by his
parents when they gave him the

It seems a thousand pities that Mr.
Plowden should not have tried the
case. It is a great chance lost.
“Though “the honour' seems to be a detail
of small value, experience in match play has
roved over and over again that he who can
old by the advantage is bound in the end to
wear down and to defeat even the most stub-
born opponent.”—The Field.
We believe this to be true.

Edith WHARTON could have made two books out of
The Fruit of the Tree (MACMILLAN), or better still,
perhaps, have left the bitterest part of the crop un-
gathered: for there is a point where we almost refuse to
accept the tragedy that depends upon coincidence, and
feel inclined to cry out that fate could never have been
so unfair as the author. Progress, as Mrs. WHARTON, ex-
hibits it to us, may work terrible havoc with the lives
of individuals. We have Amherst, a mill foreman,
young, attractive, and keenly interested in improving
the economic condition of operatives. He marries
Bessie Westmore, the mistress of the mills, and the
carrying out of his reforms causes an estrangement be-
tween them. Afterwards his wife is thrown by her
horse, and has to be kept alive in intense agony, (a

his manner I quote at random (not because it is the
best) his comment on the classes:—“The shallow rich
talk much of the turbulence of the poor and their
tendency to agitate. It is the patience of the poor
which most strikes those who know them.” This is, of
:* not new ; but it contains a great truth and is well
88.101.
Prodigals are generally attractive people, and The
Prodigal Nephew (DUCK worth) is no exception to the
rule. Yet when Mr. Alfred Munney arose and returned
to his uncle and aunt, Nosey and Mrs. Harris, who kept
a little general shop in the village of Crampford, his re-
ception was hot rather than warm, and he was at once
kicked out into the street, without any mention of the
subject of veal, partly because his relatives failed to
recognise him, and partly because he had asked his aunt,
who happened to be an ardent temperance reformer, for
a drop of beer. Luckily for him, Jim Bailey, the be-
horror only made
possible by the ad-
van c e of medical
science) in the hope
of her husband's re-
turn, until at last her
nurse, yielding to an
impulse of mercy, ad-
ministers an overdose
of opiate. But that
nurse is Justine, who
had attracted Am-
herst before his mar-
riage, and raised this
very problem of
euthanasia at the
beginning of the book.
Later, when these
two are married, the
secret is revealed,
through a doctor who
had loved Justine,
gone to the bad, and
now attempts to levy
blackmail; and thus,

Farmer Holt's old
hoss as a wedding-
gift. Now the old
hoss was the apple

In order to secure

WHARTON's name is a guarantee of sterling workman-
ship. But it is just, I think, because the characters are
SO flieſ. in their simple relations that one's sympathy
becomes dulled by a crisis so improbable. Even allow-
ing for the ruthless irony of the gods, it doesn't seem
quite fair. -
The Comments of Bagshot (Constable) are marked
by the moderation of tone, the sound commonsense, the
accurate knowledge, and the insight into problems of
life that make the leading article in The Westminster
Gazette a necessary study for all, irrespective of party
politics, who are concerned with public affairs. Relieved
from a sense of editorial gravity, Mr. SPENDER indulges
in flashes of quiet humour that enliven every page of
the book: . As Addison evolved Sir Roger de Coverley
out of his inner consciousness, making him a real per-
sonage outside the realms of fancy, so the Editor of The
Westminster has created a gentleman with strong
opinions, clear views, a turn for epigram, a touch of the
pragmatical, and called him Bagshot. As a specimen of
- and, when Alfred,
the Prodigal, appeared on the scene, was busily engaged
in searching for someone whom he might induce to
relieve him of the human half of his bargain. Further
than this I do not think I ought to give away the plot of
Mr. “JUpson Bolt's "amusing book, which is suitably
illustrated by Mr. FRED BENNETT. I do not recall Mr.
“BoLT's '' name as that of a humorous writer, but he
certainly has a gift that way, otherwise he could not
remind me, however faintly, of Mr. W. W. JAcobs and
the famous SoMERVILLE-Ross combination.
Cricket Notes.
“The failure of this tour to date has been the inability of our team
to press home an opportunity, to take an advantage at the flood with
both hands and hammer it home.”—The Globe.
Still, as Mr. C. B. FRY says in another place, “We
need not despair yet of losing the rubber.”

[JANUARY 29, 1908.
THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF
MR. HANS BAMBERGER.
RECENT advices from Valparaiso
give a full account of the terrible
experiences of Mr. HANs BAMBERGER
on his voyage last summer from
China to Peru. While passing
through the Straits of Magellan
the steamer containing the famous
violinist was driven ashore by
a tidal wave, and immediately a
posse of Tierra del Fuegians swooped
down on the crew and passengers
and carried them off into the
interior. Shocking to relate, with
the sole exception of Mr. BAMBERGER,
every single captive was immolated
to gratify the notorious predilec-
tion of the Fuegians for canni-
balism. Him, however, they spared
solely on account of his musical
genius, for they are devoted to the
art, and insisted on his playing
BAch's Chaconne over and over
again to drown the shrieks of the
victims. Mr. BAMBERGER remained
in the cannibal camp for nearly nine
weeks, suffering great privations, as
there are no daily papers or inter-
viewers in Tierra del Fuego, and his
cruel captors insisted on cutting his
hair once a fortnight. Finally, how-
ever, on his contriving to convince
them that if anything happened to
him his father-in-law, who was an
Alderman on the London County
Council and Deputy Lieutenant of
Lundy Island, would bring pressure
to bear on the British Government
to send a punitive expedition, they
consented to let him go, and pro-
vided him with a swift catamaran to
continue the voyage to Callao. Mr.
BAMBERGER, it must never be for-
gotten, is the husband of CLAUDINE,
the daughter of Sir PoMPEY BoldERo,
and is the father of those charming
triplets so happily named STEINWAY,
ERARD, and BECHSTEIN BAMBERGER.
A strange experience befell Mr.
and Mrs. BAMBERGER on their recent
visit to Paris. Mr. BAMBERGER, as is
well known, never travels without a
magnificent parcel - gilt sitz - bath,
which was presented to him by the
EMPEROR MENELEK, and on this occa-
sion was filled with costly jewels, in-
cluding several superb tiaras, snuff-
boxes, diamond-hilted shoe-horns,
etc. Amongst the young couple's
luggage there also happened to be
an enormous wooden box filled
entirely with Press cuttings relating
to the family tree of the bride. The
luggage passed through the douane
all right at Calais, but in the transit
to Paris a gang of thieves broke into
the luggage van and made off with
their booty. On arriving at Paris
Mr. and Mrs. BAMBERGER were at
first petrified with borror on discover-
ing that the precious box was gone.
Their relief can better be imagined
than described when it turned out
that the thieves had only abstracted
the bath with its contents and that
the priceless collection of Press cut-
tings was still safe.
Troubles never come singly, and
this extraordinarily gifted couple had
barely recovered from the shock when
they were prostrated by an even
more agonising calamity. On Satur-
: week a children's fancy-dress
ball was held at Kensington Town
Hall, to which their charming trio
of olive branches were, of course, in-
vited. That night, it will be remem-
bered, was remarkable for a sudden
and very dense fog, and as the
BAMBERGER triplets—still wearing the
costume appropriate to their imper-
Sonations of MozART, BACH, and
BEETHoveX—were returning home in
their 3-cylinder overstrung trichord
upright grand pram, the chauffeur
(an exiled Hungarian Count) lost
his way in the mazes of Campden
Hill and was held up by a mahalla
of brindled Doukhobors, who, after
chloroforming the chauffeur, carried
off his precious charges. For three
days and three nights the distracted
parents, assisted by all the talent of
Scotland Yard, searched every nook
and corner of Soho. On the fourth
day, when they were on the point
of giving up the quest in despair,
the triplets suddenly arrived home
safe and sound, having been rescued
by a group of Armenian Hentchakists
who had a hereditary vendetta
against the Doukhobors. Sir
PoMPEY BoldeRo, who had been
decimated with grief, has resolved
to celebrate the event by starting a
new paper, to be called The Daily
Bamberger, in which the remarkable
and unaccountable experiences of his
daughter, son-in-law, and grand-
children will be duly recorded by the
best writers. Sir Pompey, it will be
remembered, is a fourth cousin of the
Earl of Booterstow N, and his wife
is a sister of Captain “HUGHIE ''
SHYSTER, the M.F.H. of the Tufton
Hunt.
Just as we go to press the dread-
ful news reaches us that Mr. and
Mrs. BAMBERGER, their three chil-
dren, Sir Pompey BoLDERO, and Cap-
tain SHYSTER have been swallowed
up in a waterspout while yachting
off the coast of Mull. No details
have yet reached us, but an uncon-
#j rumour reports that the entire
party have been safely deposited in
the neighbourhood of Dunrobin
Castle. This seems almost too good
**------------ -
to be true, but we must hope against
hope that the illustrious virtuoso has
been once more spared to illuminate
our drab world with his inimitable
adventures.
OLIVIA AND I.
I Took up OLIVIA’s knitting and
prepared for action.
“Which do you prefer,” I asked,
“spot or plain?”
OLIVIA has a way all her own of
raising the bluest eyes in the world.
She does it quite slowly and gravely,
and then, just at the end, you catch
a glimpse—a glimpse, no more—of a
small, amused angel looking mis-
chievously at you through the gates
of Paradise.
“I suppose you mean pearl or
plain?”
I admitted that that was what I
might have meant.
“Plain,” said OLIVIA; “it isn't a
stocking, you know.” This with a
suspicion of conteinpt.
“Isn't it? ''
‘‘No, it 's a silk tie.'''
I decided to take the bull by the
horns.
“Are you knitting it for me?”
She shook her head.
“Confound those Deep Sea Fisher-
men l '’ said I.
OLIVIA smiled—a fantasia in two
dimples. “It isn't for them, either.”
I sighed and dropped two stitches.
A Deep Sea Fisherman I should not
have resented—they hardly count—
but I was not prepared to forgive
anyone else.
“As a matter of fact,” said OLIVIA,
“that tie has been promised for ages
—simply ages. I beg your pardon,
what did you say?"'
“Nothing of any moment,” I an-
swered, with a tinge of bitterness.
“And last night,” she continued,
“HUGH was here to dinner.”
I groaned, and dropped three
stitches.
“You remember HUGH, don't
you?”
“No one could possibly forget
him,” I replied ungraciously.
“Well, just as he was going away,
he said, ‘Oh, OLIVIA—'''
“Impudent young dog," I mut-
tered.
She regarded me reproachfully.
“How can I tell you if you keep in-
terrupting? You know, we're cousins
only three times removed; there 's no
reason why he shouldn't call me
OLIVIA.”
“How many times removed?”
“I know it 's either three or four,”
she answered doubtfully, “but I'm
not quite sure which.” -

“Call it four,” said I vindictively,
and I dropped four stitches.
“What are you doing?” cried
OLIVIA.
“Only introducing a little ventila-
tion,” I protested; “after all, it isn't
a chest-protector. We must give the
fellow air.’’
She reached out a hand and took
the knitting away from me. “Every
bit you 've done will have to be un-
picked.” Her voice was plaintive.
I gazed steadily at the fireplace.
“Goodness " '' she exclaimed sud-
denly, after a little while, “I’ve made
a hopeless mistake; it won't do at
all.’’
I continued to study the fireplace.
“Now you ’re cross,” she said,
looking up from her work. I don't
know if I told you, but when OLIVIA
lifts her eyes—oh yes, I remember, I
did mention it.
“No, I'm not,” said I, “merely
wounded.''
OliviA laid the knitting in her lap
and looked at it doubtfully.
“Perhaps I’d better finish it.
Would you—would you really care for
it? ''
This was adding insult to injury.
“No thanks,” I answered coldly.
“What a pity! It will be quite
wasted. I'd forgotten that HUGH
said DoRIS particularly wanted a
green tie; and this is heliotrope.”
I remembered DoRIs—a girl, an
inane girl, I always thought, but still
—a girl. I considered deeply for
nearly a minute. Somehow, as
OLIVIA had remarked, it did seem a
pity that the tie should be wasted,
“It's awfully good of you,
OLIVIA,” I said at length; “may I
really have it?”
“If you care to.”
I held out my hand. “Let me
work a bit more of it. I think I can
do it better if it's for myself.”
OLIVIA surrendered the knitting
and, leaning back in her chair, re-
garded my efforts with undisguised
interest.
“You’re improving,” she said,
when I had finished six rows without
a slip.
“I thought I should.”
She watched me through another
rOW. -
“Sometimes I think I should
rather like to be a man.’’
I shuddered.
“Not always, of course; but just
now and then, for a change.”
- 4 Why? x -
“Oh, I don't know ; only men are
different from girls. It must be re-
freshing to be so—so simple.’’
And as I looked at OLIVIA, I caught
sight again of the small, amused
angel as he lingered for a moment at
the gates.

THE LOST HEIR.
- PART I.
You know the Duchess of BATTLEDow N,
With her beautiful house in Belgrave Square,
The richest, handsomest house in town,
In fact, the handsomest anywhere.
Before becoming a Duchess, she
Belonged to an ancient family,
The Robinson-SMITHs of Campden Hill:
She sometimes visits her parents still.
She 's a splendid Duchess, and seems delighted
To see her friends—though she is short-sighted,
So short that she might be blinkered or blinded;
And, besides, she is highly absent-minded.
Well, after a year of married joy
In Battledown House they had a boy,
Who grew and grew till at eight months' old
No brawnier child you could well behold.
And one fine day when the sun was bright,
Just twenty months after her marriage,
She took him out. In the middle of the night
She started and awoke, and remembered in a fright
That she hadn't brought him back in the carriage
So she woke her Duke, and she said, “Dear B.,
A curious thing has occurred to me.” -
But the Duke, who cherished his well-earned sleep,
Turned over and murmured, “Won't it kepp?
You're always waking me up, you know,
When my vital forces are running low,
With some preposterous trivial matter,
Some nurse's gossip or kitchen chatter;
And you talk and talk and you ramble on
Until the best of the night is gone.
I always feel, when my sleep is missed,
I'd just as soon be a Socialist.
I'm battered about from pillar to post,
Like a sleepless, silly, ancestral ghost.
Forgive me, Duchess, for being candid,
But I tell you plainly my health won't stand it.”
The Duchess sighed, but she knew her man:
She shook him again, and then began: –
... You may shut your ears, you may hide your head,
But you've got to listen to me,” she said.
“It isn't as if I had lost a cat—
I wish I had, but it isn't that;
It isn't as if a dog had strayed,
Or a cook or a butler been mislaid;
It isn't as if, in fact it 's worse
Than if I had gone and dropped my purse.
It 's worse than anything GRAyson teaches,
It is worse than Radical votes and speeches.
It 's worse than setting a rick on fire;
It 's worse than bursting a brand-new tire.
It 's probably worse than BELFoRt Bax,
And I think it's worse than the Income Tax.
It 's worse, if anything worse there may be,
Than the Cobden Club—for I've lost the baby.”
At this the Duke sat up in bed,
Unclosing his auriculars.
"Good gracious, dear,” was what he said,
" Pray give me the particulars.”
“'Tis useless to proceed,” she urged,
“Without deliberation:
Our judgment must not be submerged
In fevered agitation.
Oh, let us calmly think it out
And, bit by bit, remove each doubt,
Considering how to pull what ropes,
And thus renew our shattered hopes,
And in the end with loving care
Receive again our missing heir.”
The Duke rang for his valet, the Duchess for her maid:
“GQ swift,” they cried, “to Scotland Yard, and do not
be afraid;
And bid them send their minions out and all their tact
employ
To find the Duke of BATTLEDown his only little boy.
Five hundred thousand babes of sorts in London town
there be,
But none so gay and frolicsome and beautiful as he.
Describe to the Inspector there his tucker and his bib,
Each dimpled hand, each beaming eye, and each well-
cushioned rib.
Say that he cannot walk as yet, but do not pretermit
A due account of every smile and all his infant wit.
And, by the way,” the Duchess said—the Duke was
seen to wince—
“I took him driving yesterday, and haven't seen him
Sln Ce.
Go, call the nearest taxi-cab or mount the swiftest bus,
And tell your tale at Scotland Yard, and then report
to us.”
The maid, she lingered not at all, the valet didn't creep:
Away º flew : the ducal pair resumed their broken
sleep.

I HAVE thought of a brilliant way
of making money. . Not only will my
idea make money for me, but it will
bring happiness into the homes of
thousands of , other people. We
learn in suffering what we teach in
song. I have suffered, and now I
shall sing about it.
People are always saying to me:
“You know,

“yes,” I reply, “I must get
One.
“Don’t get one of those common
ones,” they go on. “Get one
with a-—”
“Yes, I will,” I say.
can I get a good one?”
“Oh, any shop, you know, where
they sell them.”
“Ah, yes,” I say; and, of course,
that 's just where I was before.
Take the hot-water bottle, for in-
stance. It is a beautiful summer
day, with a thick yellow fog, as I
write; but winter may be upon us
at any moment. Now, I do like a
hot-water bottle in winter. It 's so
—so warm. Besides, I have been
recommended to take one. “You
know, what you want,” said some-
body, “is a-— ” “Yes,” said I,
“I must get one.”
But where do I go for one?
It is made of rubber, you suggest;
why not try a rubber manufac-
turer's? Ha, you think so. Then
what about its flannel waistcoat?
Do you think rubber people sell
flannel waistcoats? Don't be so silly.
A tailor is the man . . . .
After all, though, it is a bottle
underneath. What about a wine-
merchant 2
But it 's a rubber bottle. India-
rubber. Why not a stationer's?
You see, now, that it is a more
difficult business than you supposed.
And there are other things than hot-
water bottles. I want one of those
—you know what I mean—you pull
out a thing on the right . . . . they're
made of copper, and there 's another
place on the left . . . . and there 's
a spirit thing for the kettle in the
middle. You know. Well, where
do I get that? Is it animal, veget.
able, or mineral?
Now, then, you see what my
trouble is. I want a whole lot of
things, and I don't know who sell
them. If I did know I should
have to wander round London look-
ing for their shops. And if I did at
last find them—well, some of these
merchants are terrible fellows, and

the Games department. ‘‘No, sir.
Now goldfish——”
At this point you decide to give
it up and get a corkscrew instead.
After all, you can't draw corks with
an elephant.
“Corkscrew, sir? Certainly. You
will find them with the elephants in
the Glass department. In the other
building, sir.’’
So much for the Stores. At the
Intermediate Stores things will be
very different. You will go quietl
into the place, and find ºl Wei-
comed by a nice-mannered intelli-
gent-looking clerk. He will give you
a chair and a cigarette.
“Good morning,” he will say;
“what can I get you to-day ?”
“Oh, a whole lot of things | At
least I want—my aunt says I want
—a hot-water bottle. One of those
—you know——”
The clerk nods and makes a note.
“Seen the cricket?” he asks.
“We ought to win now. If only
BARNEs——"
“Oh, and I want one of those—
you know—I can't describe them,
only they're made of copper, and
you pull out a-—”
“Of course. Yes." He makes
another note and goes on talking to
you about the cricket. No hurry.
Take your time.
“Yes, it 's about TRUMPER's turn
to make some runs,” you agree.
“Oh, now I remember—an elderly
cousin of mine is getting married.
Mrs. WALKER. It 's the third time,
so she won't want a butter cooler.
Something about two pounds. Here 's
a card, if you 'll have it put in.
That really is all, thanks. Except
that I've got some people coming
in to tea this evening. Good morn-
ing.''
As soon as you have gone the
clerk goes to the telephone. He
rings up a stationer's (or whatever
it is) and orders a hot-water bottle.
He rings up another shop and orders
the brass thing that pulls out. He
runs through an address book and
makes a note of the twenty other
resents which have been ordered for
Mrs. WALKER. Nobody, apparently,
has thought of a toast-rack. Finally,
he rings up a confectioner's to say
that Mr. Jones is having a tea.
party; cakes and chocolates as usual.
“But what stationer does he give
the order to ?’’ you ask; “and how
does he know the hot-water bottle
will be a good one?”
Aha! That is the beauty of the
scheme. The Intermediate Stores,
Ltd., will only deal with a limited
number of shops. The competition
to be among the number will be very
keen; they will have to pay a yearly
subscription. And, of course, if once
they provide a poor article, some-
body else takes their place.
There is money in it, I am sure,
if I can induce the public to sub-
scribe. The private member would
not object to pay five guineas a year
for the privilege of ordering his
things in this luxurious way. Ten
thousand members at five guineas
would be fifty thousand pounds.
(Never mind the odd shillings. I
should take those.) A hundred firms
at five hundred guineas is another
fifty thousand pounds. A hundred
thousand a year the gross income !
And the expenses couldn't be more
than fifty thousand. Now then, roll
up and take shares.
But I suppose the public won't roll
up. It will say that money is tight,
and that the Liberal Government
has increased the price of bread.
In that case I shall have to fall back
on my old “black slave '' idea. You
know that ? You have a small black
slave, and you say to him in the
morning as you dress:
“I want you to take some books
back for me this morning. After
you 've written those letters, of
course. Then you can go and
get me a hot-water bottle. Trot out
now and see if it 's cold enough for
my fur coat; you 'd better wear my
new boots as they 're a bit tight at
present. Oh, wait a moment. Just
find my collar-stud first; it's pro-
bably under the bed somewhere.”

IN chill October's fruitful prime,
When Autumn down the hedgerow

And crystals of an early rime
On yellow leaf and stubble squan-

What sylvan pastime then more

For then in young and callow sort
He flusters up an easy target,
Thus pandering to a taste for sport
Acquired in shooting booths at

And, since he rises at my boot,
I've time to aim before I shoot.
Alone beneath an Autumn sun,
No hireling eye upon my pocket,
I seek my victims where they run,
Too innocent as yet to rocket—
A habit which one frankly fears
In pheasants of maturer years.

Congeals the blood and chaps the

You see what dangers threaten you to-day,
But do you see the biggest of the lot?
Lest you should have a troublous course to steer,
You must, C.-IB., see Beer.
Take warning, sir. If you would not despair
To hold your Party steady on its legs,
Pursue your legislative path with care,
Or you will find, as sure as eggs is eggs,
That vast majority will disappear,
Swamped in a flood of Beer.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
House of Commons, Tuesday,
January 28. – To-morrow Parlia-
ment meets for its third Session.
Clans gathering in anticipation of
hard fighting. Bustle already com-
menced in environs of the House.
Members from town and country
hurry on to the familiar scene.
Curious to note the elation of the
coming back.
“There are,” the MEMBER For
SARK says, “two hurried hours in
the Session. One is the rush from
the place in August; the other the
race for good places at the opening
of the new term.”
On both sides the joyaunce of
coming together is dimmed by
consciousness that to-morrow and
through the Session there will be
lacking from the Treasury Bench a
familiar presence. LAwson WALTon
had been Attorney-General only two
ears. While still a private Member
is constitutional modesty kept him
in the background. He was within

hail if he was wanted either to serve
the State or a friend. But he never
pushed himself to the front. When
he was dragged into debate his low
musical voice, his gentle manner,
added effect to the force of his
argument, the weight of his counsel.
Absolutely without an enemy in
the world (except ill-health), his
personal friends were as numerous
in the political camp opposite as in
his own. Yet he never sacrificed
principle to natural impulse to
avoid ruffling the feelings of others.
His advancement, attained at a
comparatively early age, his stepping
stone to the highest prize of his
profession, excited no envy. Rather
it was universally acclaimed. The
tragic suddenness of his taking. off
casts a gloom over the opening of
the Session. The Government have
lost a powerful colleague; the House
of Commons mourns the passing away of
a friend loved for his sweet nature, ad-
mired for his commanding ability.

‘’ Thank you, Toby,” he said,
“I'm wonderfully fit. Every pros-

know as well as most people, it
is the unexpected that happens in
this shop. House of Commons
always reminds me of the sea. Not
that, which thundered day and night
on the broad beach at Biarritz. I'm
thinking of a quiet pond-like ocean,
looking as if it wouldn't wreck a
cockle - shell. Suddenly over its
placid surface sweeps a gale, and
before the day is spent your ship,
maybe an Atlantic liner, is tossed
about like a cork. Equally common
is the day breaking in a storm and
ending in sunshine and calm. Storm
signals flying just now. South cone
hoisted on clock tower. But who
knows? We may, after all, have a
common-place, even dull, Session.”

“Then you don't mean forthwith
to have it out with the Lords?"
C.-B. regarded me out of corner
of his eye with suggestion of sus-
picion that there was more guile in
me than was indicated by general
appearance.
‘That reminds me, Toby,” he
said. “When Mr. G. was in Biar-
ritz, being within measurable dis-
tance of the Basque country, he
thought the opportunity convenient
for acquiring a new language. I won-
der how far he pursued the study?
I suppose you never by chance heard
him drop into the Basque tongue?”
“No,” I said, marvelling what
connection there was between this
incident and the settled intentions of
the Cabinet with respect to the
House of Lords.
“Nor did I,” said C.-B. “Well,
good-bye now. See you to-morrow.”
When he had gone it occurred to
me that he not only had not answered
my question about the Lords, but
had left me no opportunity for pur-
suing enquiry.
Business done.—Begins to-morrow.
LORD HIVEBURY SPEAKS OUT.
LoRD HIVEBURY, the new Lord
Rector of St. Bunker's University,
in succession to Mr. ANDREW
LIBRAIRIE, delivered his inaugural
address last week.
His Lordship began by stating that
science was of vital importance in
human life; it was more fascinating
than a fairy tale, more brilliant than
a novel, at any rate most novels,
although there were, of course, ex-
ceptions. (Sensation.) And any one
who neglected to follow the trium-
phant march of discovery was
deliberately rejecting one of the
greatest gifts with which we had been
endowed by Providence. Many, if
not most, of our troubles we made
for ourselves. In the first place,
many of them were purely imaginary.
“I am an old man,” said Colonel
Goodwin, “and have had many
troubles; most of them never hap-
pened.” That was the way to look
at it. Don't believe in bad luck.
Keep on saying, “There is no such
thing; I am not out; I have not
failed in the exam. ; the brokers are
not in." A man who steadily said
“I am not out '' would in time con-
vince even the umpires. Every one
could, if he chose, keep his mind,
on the whole, at peace, contented
and cheerful. No one else could do
it for him, though others might help.
In further detailing his “map of
life " Lord HiveBURY gave utterance
to a number of maxims, including the
following:— Never say die; faint
heart never won fair lady; leave ris-
ing balls alone; don't count your
chickens before they 're hatched; the
darkest shadows in life are those
which a man makes when he stands
in his own light. He had often
thought how closely the maxims of
golf apply to real life—Keep your eye
on the ball; keep straight; keep in
the course; take time; do not press;
not up, not in ; do not lose heart; be
temperate in all things; keep your
temper or you will lose your game;
drink sloe gin; use a Schenectady
putty; don't give your caddie gold.
Probably nine people out of ten eat
more than they need, more than is
good for them. A light stomach
makes a light heart. Our body is so
exquisitely constructed and adjusted,
so beautifully adapted to its purposes
and surroundings, that to spoil and
ruin its delicate and complicated
mechanism is not only a terrible mis-
take but a grievous sin. Use pepsine.
Don't eat ices just before a large
meal: profit rarely comes of it.
Avoid mad bulls in narrow lanes.
Don't exceed the speed limit. Think
of Baron HUMBoldt. Good solid
work is as necessary to peace of mind
as it is for the health of the body; in
fact the two are inseparable. By
the exercise of the body we secure
peace of the mind. The body is an
invaluable servant, but a cruel
master, and we have all to ask our-
selves whether the body is going to
rule the soul or the soul to rule the
body. Nature can do much for her
darling, the strongest; she can make
him great and rich and powerful, but
cannot make him happy; that he
must do for himself. Let us all do it
for ourselves. Let every one present
say, “I will be happy whatever hap-
pens for the rest of my life.” Time
is said to be money, but it is more—
much more—it is life. Some men
do Time—but Time does most men
sooner or later. In the best sense
every one may be great if he chooses.
It depends upon what he eats. Look
at DANIEL LAMBERT. Cod liver oil is
very fattening. It is not so easy to
make oneself small, but you can do
wonders with gin. BURNs said, “Gin
a body.” Those who make trouble are
unhappy themselves and a fountain
of unhappiness to others, while those
who take trouble are not only a
source of happiness to others but to
themselves also. Let us all be foun-
tains of happiness. Why not ? We
often complain of the faults of others,
but have much more reason to com-
plain of our own. They do us much
more harm, and yet how we love
them. The man who has no sym-
pathy will not get it. The man who
puts up a fence, fences out more
than he fences in. If spring came
but once in a lifetime, if the sun
rose and set once in a year instead of
once in a day, if a rainbow appeared
once in a century, if flowers were as
rare as rubies, and dewdrops as
diamonds, how wonderful they would
seem to us, how they would astonish
and delight us. A blue moon would
probably be more than we could bear.
There is no place like home; by
which he meant one's own home.
HARVEY, the discoverer of the circu-
lation of the blood, lived at home. A
stitch in time saves nine. It has
been well said that a love of reading
is better than £10,000 a year. He
had tried both and meant to do so.
Reading changes hours of ennui into
moments of delight, and ScHILLER
scarcely exaggerated when he said
that no one who had read HoMER
could justly complain of his lot. On
the other hand, no one, whether he
had read HoMER or not, ought to
complain of his lot. Complaint was
cowardly, just as delays were dan-
gerous. Look at ARCHIMEDEs. (Loud
cheers.)
-
FOG SIGNALS.
A correspondent writes to us:
“In the recent fogs two pedestrians,
whose united ages amounted to 100,
ran into each other, each having
passed his house, 100 yards on either
side, without knowing it. Surely
this constitutes a record in fog ex-
periences?”
At Oxford Circus on Thursday
morning a motor omnibus skidded
from the pavement into the road, to
the consternation of the passengers.
It is reported that during the fog
Miss CHRISTABEL PANKHURST was
escorted across Downing Street by
Mr. Asquith.
At many of the principal shops
ladies waited patiently for hours
awaiting the “final fog reductions.”
Owing to the fog, passengers were
enabled to catch the next day's
trains with ease on all the principal
lines.
Several persons used broken-down
motor omnibuses as shelters from the
weather during the fog, and might
have been seen reading their papers
till the time came for them to keep
appointments.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
KATHLEEN MAWOURNEEN.
WHEN the actors on a stage laugh
very loud at one another's pleas-
antries I generally feel myself ex-
cused from joining in their hilarity.
Certainly the more boisterous merri-
ment of the First Act of The
O'Grindles, at the Playhouse, left me
almost 'as indifferent as the stuffed
pig behind the stile, who preserved
throughout the scene an absolute im-
mobility. But the quieter humour
of Miss ALEXANDRA CARLISLE as
Kathleen Fitzgerald—a very graceful
figure in her green riding habit—
made fair amends. I have before
now complained that the appearance
of the larger quadrupeds in a play
always makes me nervous, but she
handled her mare very tactfully, and
there was always the stolidity of the
pig to reassure me.
I read in an interview somewhere
that the author, Mr. EsMond, re-
garded his play as a farce, but that
Mr. MAUDE preferred to consider it
a light comedy. They were both
right and both wrong, but neither of
them confessed to an element of
rather thread-bare melodrama. This
comes into the Second Act, with its
time-honoured scheme of a hero
under false suspicion and a villain
allowing the blame to rest on the
innocent. But it is too much to
invite us to take an Irishman seri-
ously; and the tragic possibilities of
the situation suited so ill with the
light-hearted natures of these adorably
inconsequent folk that one began to
doubt the genuineness of the picture.
Already our confidence had sustained
a severe shock by the apparition of
a figure that seemed to have no con-
ceivable relation to her environment.
It was that of Mrs. Harding
O'Grindle, whose sniffy airs and
affectations were admirably conveyed
by Miss WINIFRED EMERY-a very
welcome reappearance. What the
divil, I asked myself (speaking the
language), was the lady doing in this
dear old unseaworthy galley of the
O'Grindles 2 How did she ever come
to marry into such a happy-go-lucky
crew 2 Still, the very contrast fur-
nished by her self-assurance gave
promise of a very pretty scene when
the truth should come out and she
should find that her devoted hus-
band, and not his bachelor brother,
was the libertine of the story. But
the Third Act, in which everything
righted itself along the old familiar
lines, was a sad disappointment; and
the nonchalance with which she re-
ceived the news was such that I
thought I must have missed some
delicate subtlety. This Act was re-
deemed by a really genuine Irish in-
cident—namely, the organisation of a
supper-party to the whole neighbour-
hood by an officious friend of the
house without the faintest collusion
on the part of the actual host.
Mr. MAUDE and Miss ALEXANDRA
CARLISLE played with refreshing
spontaneity, and made in all moods
a delightful pair of lovers, though
they were naturally at their best in
the quieter phases that permitted
easy badinage or tender sentiment.
Apart from the obscure rendering of
Some dialogue at the opening of the
First Act, the whole cast showed
a very level excellence; and special

HINTS TO ARMY OFFICERS.
WE, notice in The Daily Graphic
that the Army officer is now allowed,
when in mufti, to travel in a penny
omnibus. The concession is certain
to result in a big rush of military men
for this popular vehicle, and share-
holders in omnibus companies are to
be congratulated on the unexpected
creation of a new class of patron.
While it is probable that at many
of the military riding schools an om-
nibus will in future form a part of
the equipment, so that officers may
privately become familiar with its
way before attempting to use it in
public, there are many, doubtless,
who will welcome the information we
are able to give about this pleasant
mode of travel.
The omnibus may be seen in most
of the principal thoroughfares of Lon-
don. It may be distinguished from
the hansom cab by its wealth of
colour and display of reading-matter.
If you see a two-horsed, four-
wheeled vehicle, with “Nestlé’s
Milk '' printed in front, and on the
side “Vesta Tilley,” in big letters,
separated by a strip of glass from
“Liverpool Street, Bank, Charing +,
Piccadilly, Sloane Street,” and other
information in smaller letters, that
is an omnibus.
Unlike the hansom cab, the omni-
bus requires two men to run it—a
driver and a conductor. The driver
is the man in front, above the milk;
the conductor either stands at the
back, ringing a bell, or wanders
about the omnibus, ringing a bell.
He is a conductor of sound, and fre-
quently of heat.
The omnibus is unlike a cab in
other ways. If the omnibus contains
one or more passengers, that is not
an indication that it is engaged, and
an Army officer in mufti is at liberty
to hail it and to enter it. It will
not always take you just where you
wish to go. An omnibus marked
“Putney ’’ cannot be persuaded to
go from the Army and Navy Stores
to the Trocadero. The only way to
make an omnibus go where you want
it to go is to want to go somewhere
to which it is going. The omnibus
will not catch a train for a double
fare. Copper coins may be tendered
in payment without a crowd assem-
bling. A further dissimilarity is that
any Army officer in mufti may ride
on the top of an omnibus without risk
of being mistaken for a sailor on
furlough.
The uninitiated may have a difficulty
in ascertaining where an omnibus is
going. Beginners will find it a good
plan to stop the omnibus (raising the

umbrella to the conductor is suffi-
cient: it is not necessary to handle
the vehicle in any way) and walk
round it, reading the names of
streets, public-houses, and churches
printed upon its sides. Another way
is, having stopped the omnibus, to
walk slowly up to the conductor, and
ask “Where are you going?"
To get on an omnibus while it is
in motion, run after it, avoiding the
mud as much as possible, grasp the
left-hand rail with the left hand (care
should be taken to continue running),
and the right-hand rail with the right
hand. If the hat and umbrella be-
come
let go one hand (but keep on
running) and give them, with the eye-
glass and any other obstacles, into
the care of the conductor. Having
firmly grasped both hand-rails again,
while still running place the left foot
on the lower step, and simultaneously
cease running with the right, which
should be lifted to the second step.
Take the first turning to the left, and
you are in the omnibus.
The motor omnibus can be distin-
guished from the other kind by the
absence of horses. Further, it is
troublesome at this stage,
bigger, swifter, and noisier than the
horsed-omnibus; it also stops longer.
Do not run after a motor omnibus;
you are sure to lose.
THE SKIPPER.
THE cock, one January morn,
With trumpet tone punctilious,
Awoke me, dreary and forlorn,
I wished I never had been born ;
My visage, shrivelled and unshorn,
Looked ominously bilious.
I paced, with neither aim nor scheme,
From basement floor to attic,
And saw, depending from a beam,
A rope. “Why strive against the
stream 2
To end it thus, I thought, would
seem -
Both tragic and dramatic."
But Heaven decreed another course;
Instead I started skipping;
I whipped my toes without remorse,
With every skip I gained new force,
And bounded like a bucking horse,
My pores with moisture dripping.
Dyspepsia's sword is in its sheath l
I've solved the liver riddle.
What though the house, my skips
beneath,
Should join the Tube at Hampstead
Heath,
To-day I'm crowned with Hebe's
wreath,
And fitter than a fiddle !

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HALF hoped when I began The Explorer (HEINEMANN)
that the name had a psychological or social meaning,
because people who perforate untrodden jungles are
occasionally boring to the reader as well. But I soon
found that Alec MacKenzie was an exception. Mr.
MAUGHAM has shown a quite heroic reticence about lug-
gage and rare flora and unpleasant entomological speci-
mens where they don't concern his plot, and the result is'
a SARGENT-like portrait of a pioneer as he ought to be—a
strong man not too silent, and, except when he is on the
march, not too long-winded H -
either. I don't think even
to know, that, after such a prologue, he is in for a peck
of trouble and a halo in three acts and a tableau.
Act I. : Master Wild Oats runs amok, and commits one
particularly foolish offence against the criminal laws.
Act II. : Hero takes on his shoulders the disgrace and
burden of the said crime, to the dismay of all his friends
except One-who-believes-in-him. Act III. : Wild Oats,
overtaken by Nemesis, dies repentant, proclaiming with
his last breath the innocence and heroism of his de-
liverer. Final Tableau: Hero is discovered in a blaze of
glory and a brand-new halo, smiling at One-who-believes-
in-him (off). That, roughly, is the scheme of Mr.
ALGERNoN Gissing's Second Selves (LoNG), the un-
academic story of two Oxford undergraduates. As a
— psychological study of poor
double-faced human-nature
the author of The Modern
Traveller would really dis-
like him. Nor are the nice
people he leaves at home
forgotten, as so frequently
happens in novels of travel.
Mr. MAUGHAM remembered
that it was going to be
leap-year, and has made
Dick Lomas compel that
very charming widow, Mrs.
Crowley, to propose to him
as the finale of a delightful
flirtation. These two char-
acters form a flippant relief
to the more passionate part
of the story, which is also,
as far as one can foresee,
destined to come right in
the end. But I should like
to know whether Alec
MacKenzie will buy back
Hamlyn's Purlieu for his
wife when he comes home
from the Congo. Mr.
MAUGHAM will perhaps add
a footnote about it in
another edition.
Mr. Punch's established
modesty does not preclude
him from giving it as his
opinion that life would be
cºte. ºoº-º-o-d
it is distinctly clever. But
I find the motives as:
signed for the central
crime—absolutely certain
of detection and nearly
barren of reward—far too
trivial. I suggest to Mr.
GissiNG that what really
happened was that poor
Wild Oats committed it in
a fine frenzy of altruism.
He knew that he was the
villain of the piece, and
that without his help Hero
could not possibly win his
halo. So he just did the
first outrageous thing that
came handy, without wor-
rying about probability or
motives. The idea, I ad-
mit, sounds far-fetched,
but I honestly prefer it to
Mr. Gissing's.

[To an ardent Ireformer, M.P., hinting, in conclusion, at the advisa- 1

AND so the futile round begins again ...
In that high Palace of the People's Will,
Vocal with repetitions chiefly vain, , .
And talkers talking with a curious skill
For signifying nil.
Look back, my ARCHIBALD, two little years!
How sadly different was then the scene-
When first you sat elect among your peers,
Among the brand-new brooms alert and keen
On sweeping most things clean.
Had not the Shrine of Demos been profaned
With foul Augean filth? and were not you,
You and the other Herculae, ordained -
To purge it of the rotting refuse due.
To the old Tory crew 2
Rightly you looked upon yourself with awe,
Fixed by the Nation's Choice in Freedom's van
To be a filter to the Fount of Law,
And realise upon a Liberal plan
The latent Rights of Man.
You'd bring the late Astraea back to earth :
No one who jibbed at work should go forlorn;
Old Age, regardless of intrinsic worth,
Should win its weekly crown, and bless the morn
When ARCHIBALD was born.
Bursting all barriers (like the House of Lords)
You would renew the Paradisal spell;
Ploughshares should blossom in the place of swords,
And the vile slum exchange its local smell
For whiffs of asphodel.
Alas for every dear illusion lost!
Ehcu for blighted hopes that turn you 'ickl
And all those pretty budlets nipped by frost
That seemed, before the cold had touched their
quick,
So span and oh! so spick |
For see your Temple, set on holy ground,
Proves but a babble-shop where, say, a score
Of chartered orators enjoy the sound 2
Of their own voices, saying o'er and o'er
Just what they said before.
There happy songsters should have built their nests,
Chanting the paans of an Age of Gold;
Not simply parrots throwing off their chests
Those petrified refrains that leave you cold,
Being so very old.
And you who were to put creation right,
You are required to hush your swelling throat,
And through each matinée and half the night
Perform your dull mechanic part by rote,
And vote and sleep and vote.
Still, do not be down-hearted; clouds may lift.
In dreams I see a god debouch below
Out of the Upper Chamber, stern and swift,
To tell the Commons: “'Tis a farce, your show !
Mend it or out you go!”

THE LITERARY WEEK.
[Somewhat as “The Academy” now sees it.]
WE call attention to the Trilby Parva scandal. The
Rev. ADoLPH.Us BLoxIIAM, the vicar of that parish, in a
moment of senile dementia—he is in his eighty-seventh
year—invited the children of several local Nonconfor-
mists to a magic lantern entertainment held at the
vicarage. On hearing of this atrocious act of in-
subordination the Bishop of Bootle (Dr. GARGoyLE) at
once very properly inhibited Mr. BLOXHAM, and ordered
him to be confined for a month in his own cellar. Our
Nonconformist contemporary, The Daily News, affects
to be wounded by the normal results of Mr. BLOXHAM's
outrageous laxity of discipline. We know nothing of
Mr. BLOXHAM except his age, but we have been assured
that his cellar, though somewhat damp, is infinitely
more comfortable than many of the cells provided by
ToRQUEMADA for the reception of recalcitrant Church-
men in the palmy days of the Mother Church.
The sudden and lamented death of “OUIDA ’’ suggests
an historic reference to the “lofty slashing stroke ’’ of
the winning crew at Putney. The capital made out of
this venial blunder only serves to illustrate the pre-
posterous importance attached to success in athletics, or
the correct use of athletic jargon by the man in the
street. Mr. REGINALD McKENNA’s sole claim to
political advancement was the fact that he had rowed
in the Cambridge eight. He does not know a
Bollandist from a Mahatma, or a scapulary from a
phalanstery. He probably thinks GARIBALDI a greater
man than Pio NoNo, and Dr. CLIF Ford better company
than CARDINAL ANTONELL1 (if he ever heard of him).
And yet, on the strength of having once possessed a
straight back and a certain amount of brawn, he is now
allowed to decorate the front bench with his perky
profile. That in itself is odious enough. What is far
worse is the entrusting to this suburban opportunist, who
has no convictions but a genuine hatred of a past which
he cannot understand, of the power to wreak his ven-
geance on the work of saints and martyrs.
The state of the Lunacy Laws is a constant source
of grief to the judicious. Perhaps in no respect is their
inadequacy more patent than in the liberty which is
accorded to our most popular novelists to assume at
will the rôle of critic. Sir ARTHUR ConAN Doyle has
just invited his thousands to follow him “through the
magic door ’’ of his own sumptuously upholstered study.
Cannot the system of confinement “during the King's
pleasure,” or some other which would produce the same
effect, be extended to such cases? By some such
means such persons who are not positively insane might
be subjected to the humane and remedial treatment of
expert doctors, as they are at that admirably conducted
institution—Broadmoor.

These passages are printed in a book for all to see—

Till classic Sheffield offered him her LL.D. degree.
Then Ponson P. engaged a berth as swiftly as he
could,
And soon he was invested with a brand-new Sheffield

But ere he travelled home again he thought he ought
to see
If Oxford could be wakened from her fatal lethargy.
The dons were most polite to him; they opened wide
their doors,
And fed him like a monarch from their hospitable stores,

you read?”
Prof. Porso N. P. is safe at home in Upaidee again,
But ah! the fatal Oxford blight has settled on his brain.
Unmoved he scans the theses which the College book-
shelves hold,
The lsº of his seminar now leave him strangely

All Upaidee is puzzled; they regard him as a freak—

MY SPEECH.
[I don't see why the Government should be
the only people to make a speech at the begin-
ning of a Session, even though they do call it
The King's Speech, and pretend that they
didn't write it. Why shouldn't I be allowed
to make one for myself? Anyhow it would be
a bit brighter than the Parliament one.
A. A. M.]
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen
(May I say, Friends 2)—
It 's a perfectly topping morn-
ing, and I'm as fit as anything,
and jolly glad to see you all
again. Thank Heaven the fog's
gone. I don't mind rain so much--
in fact, I rather like it in the country
—but I do bar fog. However, that 's
all right now, and it 's the 1st of Feb-
ruary, and in another month it will
be spring.
My Lords and Gentlemen, Think of
that
Court and Society.
My relations continue to be
friendly. My uncle and I have just
concluded an agreement concerning
our respective interests in old clothes
and solid cash, whereby we both hope
to derive much benefit. My cousin
HENRY sent me a fiver on my birth-
day—pretty decent of him, consider-
ing. In the home circle I am still
thought to be kindly, intelligent, and
hard-working. I had a letter from
CYNTHIA yesterday, the dear. How-
ever, she isn't a relation—luckily.
Small Holdings.
The correspondence (including
several important telegrams) which
has recently passed between the pro-
prietors of an eminent newspaper and
myself has placed me in possession of
a handsome History of the World in
several volumes. It is known as The
Historians' History, and that rather
made me wonder whether I was
worthy of it, not being an historian
myself in the strict sense of the word.
However, their fifth letter reassured
me on this point.
The Sinking Fund.
By the way, going back to my re-
lations for a moment. Bob has just
paid up the tenner I lent him years
ago, and jolly well time too. We'll
leave it there for the present.
Colonial Matters.
Turning to our Colonies (you know,
you mustn't think that I am not in-
terested in Public Affairs. On the con-
trary, I read the papers every day, and
I am a true Imperialist, being par-
ticularly keen on Australian ques.
tions)—turning to our Colonies, i am
glad to see that, in Australia, Hut.
CHINGS continues to take runs off the
opposition. I spotted him five years
ago as the best bat in England, when
they weren't even playing him regu-
larly for his county, so I'm naturally
rather pleased about it. It will be
perfectly sickening if we lose the
rubber; and ſ 've got a level half-
crown on it that we don't with Thom-
soN, who is a beastly Little Eng-
lander. (If it had been the South
Africans I should have called him a
Pro-Boer, so he may consider himself
lucky.) Now that Joxes is back I'm
certain to win; but I shall refer to
this again when I come to the Esti-
mates for the year.
Foreign Affairs.
Foreign affairs have also claimed
my attention. I have entered into
an arrangement with Messrs. Thomas
Cook under which I hope to travel
as far as Switzerland in the summer.
A Bill for preserving the integrity of
Swiss hotel keepers, who will charge
two francs for quite a small
lemonade, which failed to pass into
law last year, will be again submitted
to them.
Ladies,
Did I say I'd had a letter from
CYNTHIA yesterday? Awfully sweet
it was.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
Estimates for the expenditure of
the coming year have been occupying
my attention quite a lot lately. You
know it 's perfectly absurd, but it
works out at about twice the esti-
mated income. On the “double
entry '' system, putting down the re-
ceipts twice, and allowing for
THOMSON's half-crown, I can just
make it square; but that isn't good
finance, you know. -
Negotiations for a loan from my
cousin HENRY are in progress, and in
the event of their failing to mate-
rialise the offer will be renewed at a
later date. . Meanwhile we can only
hope for the best (unless you can
think of something), and—as I re-
marked before—it's a perfectly top-
ping day, and spring 's nearly here,
and I'm blowed if I care what
happens. -
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen,_
Bills will be laid before myself for
the following purposes:–
To amend the system of
monthly payments for the His-
tory of the World, either by re-
ducing the amount or by length-
ening the period.

THE LOST HEIR.
SYNopsis.
[The Duchess of BATTLEDown, who has a handsome house in Belgrave
Square, one day takes her baby boy, aged eight months, in the carriage
with her. Somehow she mislays him and fails to bring him back.
Being both absent-minded and short-sighted, she does not noire the
child's absence until the middle of the next night, when she suddenly
wakes and realises her loss. She arouses the i. her husband, and
informs him, and they at once send the maid and the valet to Scotland
Yard.] .*
- PART II.
IN this distressing but veracious history
I don't propose to rack you with a mystery:
The Earl of BRASENOSE, the infant heir,
Was gone—but I shall tell you how and where.
The ducal coachman, Mr. WILLIAM OATES,
Was of the kind on which a Duchess dotes.
No portlier man, I ween, has ever graced
A lofty seat, and none so purple-faced.
With careless ease he wore his curly wig;
His calves were massive and his back was big-
Poised on the great barouche's box he sat,
And, poised on him, reposed his cornered hat.
He could control his prancing chestnut pair
With wrists of steel and hands as light as air.
If some pert busman, facile with his slang,
Upon his looks the ready changes rang,
Calling him “Porpoise,” “Puffer,” “Pudden-head,”
Or names like these, no word he ever said;
Or if a cabman, as a cabman will,
Pointed him out with, “There 's a beauty, BILL,”
He answered not, but with a glacial frown
Looked the delinquent up and looked him down,
And left him there in London's busy street
Convinced of sin and frozen to his seat.
Now, in spite of his splendour, WILLIAM 0.
Had never been caught in the toils of Cupid :
He thought the stages of courtship slow,
And marriage itself he reckoned stupid.
By the charms of the fair he set no store;
He meant to remain a bachelor.
His father was dead, but his mother remained :
She kept an animal shop in the Dials,
And whenever the soul of the son was pained
By the burdensome weight of a coachman's trials
He sought the home of feather and fur,
And called his mamma and consulted her.
One night—it happened to be the night
When the Duke and the Duchess had their fright—
A man with most of his face concealed
In a muffler that left one eye revealed—
A man who wafted upon his way
A faint aroma of straw and hay—
A man who bore on his ample arm
A burden carefully wrapped from harm, -
One night this man, as I say, crept up
To the door that was flanked by kit and pup,
And when Mrs. OATEs had let him in
Declared himself as her kith and kin.
“I'm your son WILLIAM,” he said, said he,
“And I'm sorry to say as I've made so free
As to bring yer the Earl of BRAs ENose.
This 'ere 's the Earl in his Sunday clo's.
His mother, the Duchess, went and dropped him,
And I nipped orf o' the box and copped him.
It 's the Earl 'isself, and it ain't no other,
And you 've got to keep him for me, dear mother.
'The baby's a regular precious gem,
And he 'll be much better with us nor them.”
His mother heaved a sigh. “The Duchess dropped
him 2 '' - -
She said at last, “she 's really rather careless.
I'll temporarily at least adopt him,
I bet she 'll hardly notice being heirless.”

DANCING DEITIES.
HIGH JINKS IN WALHALL.
THE brilliant representations of WAGNER's Ring at
Covent Garden, we are glad to learn, have been greatly
appreciated in immortal circles, and, in particular, in
the house of Donner. A baronetcy, it will be remem-
bered, was recently conferred on Mr. Edward Donner,
of Manchester (though his brother-god, Mr. Thor,
received no such honour), and a paragraph in the social
and personal column of a leading newspaper states that
“The fancy dress ball for young people, given by Mrs. Philip
Donner and Mr. Julius Donner at the Villa Beauregard, went off
j.". The dresses were superb, the dancing animated, and the
children looked delightful.”
A later wireless telegram from Walhall gives the
following interesting particulars as to the progress and
conclusion of this unique entertainment:-
“Among the grown-ups present were Mr. Bert Froh,
Fire-Brigadier Loge, Hon. Wanderer and Lady Fricka
Wotan, Miss Popsy Freia, Sir Siegmund and Lady
Sieglinde Volsung, Colonel Fafner, C.B., in fancy
dress; Mr. Perce Siegfried, who wore an antique cap
and massive gold ring, accompanied by Lady Brünnhilde
Siegfried, who brought her horse (one) and her sisters
(eight), the Misses Gerdi, Ortli, Trauti, Schwertli,
Wiggi, Siggi, Grimgi, and Rossi Walküre; Lieut-General
Alberich, V.C., and Mr. Herb Hagen (the Public
Executioner) from Nibelheim Lodge; Mrs. Erda
chaperoning Miss Norn, Miss Gladys Norn, and Miss
Trixie Norn; Miss Gutrune Gibichung, Dr. Mime,
F.R.C.S., and Mr. Sid Hunding; Sir Frederick Fasolt,
K.C., was also present, but unfortunately died soon
after the party commenced. Fräulein Waldvogel and
the Rheintöchter Trio sang at intervals. Besides Sir
Frederick Fasolt, other guests died during the evening,
and the survivors were consumed later by a fire which
unfortunately broke out. The refreshments, supplied
by Mr. Gunther, were also consumed. The Rhein-
töchter Trio alone escaped by taking to the water,
having previously annexed Mr. Perce Siegfried's golden
ring in lieu of their fee, which under the mournful
circumstances was otherwise unattainable.”
DEAR Mr. Punch,--I see that the Labour Conference
at Hull has resolved that the Party shall aim at the
establishment of social and economic equality between
the sexes. My wife's social qualifications are so
transcendent that I doubt my ever becoming her equal
even in a democratic sense. But what I want to know
is this : If the future Democratic Providence allots me
£500 a year as my proper share of the loot, will it, in
order to make my wife economically my equal, grant
her the like amount 2 Yours anxiously, WAverer.
According to a contemporary the De Beers Company
at Dutoitspan has stopped washing, and discharged
a hundred white workmen in consequence. This seems
a pity, as under the new conditions they might soon
have qualified as “coloured labour.”

PARIs To PARIS BY PERAMBULATOR.
(From Our Correspondent.)
Paris, Feb. 3.
The perambulator race from Paris
to the North Pole and down the other
side of the world to the South Pole
and back to Paris is creating much
interest here. America will be repre-
sented by four prams, France by
three, and Germany by one. The
competitors are all men of note in
perambulator circles—manufacturers
of baby carriages, fathers of families,
etc.—and realising the importance to
the world of knowing how these
popular little vehicles will stand
rough handling in arctic regions and
the tropics, these unselfish men have
come forward in the interest of the
public, ready to undertake the noble
task.
Each competitor will push himself
and his pram. News of the race will
be conveyed to the Press direct from
the “log" of each vehicle. As most
of those concerned are no novices at
log-rolling, the public may rely on
being kept fully informed of all the
necessary details. -
Though the generous donors will
blush at having their disinterested
kindness publicly recorded, it must
be mentioned that the travellers'
emergency rations of canned Sauer-
kraut are the gift of the Boomer
Food Company, while every peram-
bulatorist will be swaddled up to the
armpits in bear-proof bags presented
by the Trumpeter Trouser Trust.
As the domestic pram will, of
course, be used a great deal under
arctic conditions in the future (and
we all know how Baby loves a ride
down an iceberg), the tests in the
terrible frozen North will be looked
forward to by us at home with the
deepest interest; and the behaviour
of the sturdy little carriages whilst
ploughing their way through the
sands of tropical deserts will be
watched no less keenly, seeing that
Nurse may find herself obliged at
any moment to cross the Sahara.

It seems a thousand pities that the

other's long unfamiliar eyes, was
enough to move a less sensitive
nature than that of the Chief Secre-
tary. He felt it was a spectacle
that boded no good for him. Whilst
they were divided he might, to a cer-
tain extent, rule. Reunited, animated
by a common object, their conduct
guided by a single policy, they would
make him feel the resemblance of the
Irish Office to a bed of roses to be
more remote than ever.
Before new Session had advanced
an hour, example was forthcoming of
the practical working of La Belle Alli-
ance. John REDMOND, taking excep-
tion to absence of notice of the depri-
vation suffered by the House conse-
quent on temporary withdrawal from
the scene of the Member for North-
west Meath, at present in prison for
contempt of Court, moved appoint-
ment of a Select Committee. Last
Session TIM HEALY would have sat
scornfully silent, attempting by subtle
adjustment of his pince-nez to ex-
press pitying contempt for John's
judgment and his intellectual capa-
city generally. Now he rose to sup-
port the contention of “my hon.
friend,” a tremor shaking his voice as
he thus alluded to him.
Ominous this for the Chief Secre-
tary, who has two Bills in hand.
Meaner natures would have resented
the burying of the hatchet and all it
portends. St. AUGUSTINE paid it the
tribute of a tear as he murmured—
“Then blessings on the falling out
That all the more endears,
When we fall out with those we love
And kiss again with tears.”
The Member for Sark, taking a
sordidly practical view of the matter,
is accustomed to hold forth against
the ancient practice of moving and
seconding the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. He points
out that it is in its inception and
execution a purely artificial perform-
ance, to be regarded seriously only
inasmuch as it is responsible for
wasting valuable time on threshold of
Session which, as PRINCE ARthur de-
monstrated, cannot be long enough
for its appointed work.
The anachronism was to a certain
extent justified by proceedings of
to-day. RUDIE LEHMANN's speech in
moving the Address was a model of
the best thing possible in the circum-
stances. In excellent taste, admi-
rably phrased, modestly delivered, it
reached the highest level of the
opportunity.
“Now 's the time,” says SARK,
nothing if not logical, “to strike the
performance out of the bill. We
can't improve upon the latest ‘pre-

say. Opportunity accordingly en-
ticing to drop the flummery, and get

Business dome.—New Session opens.
Thursday. — House disturbed by
wild stories of Cabinet Ministers be-
sieged in their bedrooms at early morn
by forces of Amazons armed with
bannerets and umbrellas. Circum-
stantial narrative current of one
Minister, disguised as the milkman,
captured as he was making his way
out by a side-door, and held for
ransom just as if he were Kaid
McLEAN. Happily his appearance on
the Treasury Bench shortly after
three o'clock discredited the report.
A hearty cheer testified to general
relief at his escape.
(The new Solicitor-General and Attorney-
General, Mr. S-m Ev-ns and Sir W-ll-m
R-bs-n.)
Still the question remains with us,
oppressively insisting on an answer.
How long are our Cabinet Ministers
to be made the sport of clamorous
woman? Cattle-driving in Ireland,
deplorable as a form of popular
pastime, is a trifle compared with
this new sport of Cabinet-Minister-
hunting. LLOYD-GEORGE, though en-
couraged by project on foot to double
his official salary, is reported to have
expressed doubt as to whether the
money is sufficient compensation for
the daily, inconvenience, the hourly
anxiety, imposed upon him by the
Suffragist crusade. It was bad
enough when right honourable gentle-
men were assailed in their office or
waylaid on their way home. When
it comes to routing them out of bed
at break of day with shrill enquiry
why no mention of women's votes
was made in the King's Speech, life
is not worth living, even at the rate
of £5,000 a year.
In contrast with these scenes of
disorder was the appearance of the
House this afternoon. No one
casually looking in would guess that
the subject of debate was one which
Socialists have made their own.
RAMSAY MAcDoNALD moved amend-
ment to Address deploring absence
from King's Speech of reference to the
state of the unemployed. There was
nothing violent about him save the
colour of his blood-red necktie. As
for PETE CURRAN, who seconded the
amendment, he preached pure Social-
ism in a quiet matter-of-fact manner
suggestive that he was doing nothing
more startling than reciting the mul-
tiplication table, say up to twelve
times twelve. Apart from its matter
—and, after all, that is something—it
was an admirable discourse, reaching
a level of style which many much
older Parliamentary hands might
envy. -
Next to this earnest, simple, out-
spoken avowal of Socialism, de-
claimed in hearing of the unshocked
Mace, the most remarkable thing
was the grave attention with which
it was listened to by a crowded
House. No cry of dissent, no note
of remonstrance interrupted the
measured flow of PETE's eloquence.
In fact, as happened when a foreign
prelate addressed at length a peccant
parrot, no one seemed a penny the
worse. When the Socialists among
the Labour Party made an end of
speaking, members strolled out
quietly into the division lobby, and
the amendment was negatived by 195
votes against 146.
Business done.—Debating the Ad-
dress.

BUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 5, 1908.
A ONE-GIRL SHOW.
Her Father, the new play at the
Haymarket, has been adapted from
the French by Mr. Michael, MoRTON.
It must be great fun to be an
adaptor, and Mr. MoRTON must have
enjoyed his work immensely; but I
am afraid he has not been completely
successful. Luckily I have an idea
for him.
He started off well. “Her father ’’
in the original was an architect.
Now we don't care much about archi-
tects in England, but we do like a
lord. So Mr. MoRtoN gave the fellow
a title—Lord Claremont. The lover
was turned into a baronet — Sir
Claude Trehmayne. Good. Now
what can be done for the Rigeley-
Fanes? A “Hon.,” a simple “Hon.”
at least.
Having Englished the characters
successfully, Mr. MoRTON turned to
the plot. Here he was in a perfect
sea of troubles. French Law (I don't
know whose fault it is, but it makes it
extremely awkward for adaptors) is
different from English Law. Now
the whole play turns on a point of
law. Mrs. Forster had obtained a
judicial separation from her husband
eighteen years ago. Her baby had
just been born, and the Court gave
er the custody of the child for
eleven months in the year; but in
the month of June it was to be
packed up and sent to Mr. Forster.
(Mr. Digby, the solicitor, would
have put it better than that.)
Whether this is good law or not I
cannot say; but somehow I do not
see an English Judge ordering a babe
of six months to spend June away
from its mother. However, we need
not worry about that. The point is
that when the child, Irene, is
eighteen years old, the father (now
Lord Claremont) suddenly turns up
and claims his month.
Irene has never seen her father;
Mrs. Forster has never forgiven him.
The mother and daughter swear they
will never, never, never be parted
from each other. Besides, Irene has
just become engaged to Frank Morris,
a very attractive young man. But
Mr. Digby puts the case for the
claimant so strongly that Mrs.
Forster has to submit. Off goes Irene
to Berkeley Square.
You guess, of course, what hap-
pens. The girl who came to hate her
father remains to love. Also, I am
afraid, she forgets Frank (she never
had really cared for him, you know),
and loses her heart to Sir Claude.
When she returns to Hampstead and
Mrs. Forster, Lord Claremont goes
with her, and there is a pretty recon-
ciliation scene to end up. -
Let us return to Mr. MoRTON. At
some moment in his work of adapta-
tion a horrible thought must have
struck him. Has an English Court
power over a girl of eighteen 2 Or
does it only last until she is sixteen
years of age? We can imagine Mr.
MoRTON wrestling with this problem;
staying awake o' nights; finally ob-
taining expensive legal advice. And
then we can imagine him saying,
“Well, hang it, there 'll be no play
at all if I’ve got to alter that. I'm
dashed if I do. . . . Besides, what
does the English public know or care
about law 2 ”
I think he was wise.

we had not had this play, we should
not have seen Miss MARIE LOEHR as
Irene. I am almost afraid to say
what I think of her—her prettiness
and charm (which, after all, is her
own affair), and her delicate acting
(which as a free-seater was mine).
But I shall tell Mr. MoRtoN my idea.
It is this. Why not have Miss
Loehr on the stage all the time? In
the First Act, for instance, when
Mrs. Forster and Frank are having
dull explanations, which only we are
supposed to hear, Miss Loehr might
be arranging the flowers in the back
room, with the door open. (Of course
she would be too honourable to
listen.) That would make the First
Act complete. The Second would
be more difficult, but I think it could
be done. The stage would have to
be divided into two parts—one side
the Berkeley Square house, with
Lord Claremont waiting for his
daughter, and telling his friends
| Perhaps he was.
about her; the other a compartment
of the tube, containing Miss Loehr on
her way from Hampstead. . . . And
so on. Do you see the idea, Mr.
MoRTON ?
I must say a few words about the
others. Miss HENRIETTA WATson I
last saw as Mrs. Clandon, a similar
part to that of Mrs. Forster. In both
cases my sympathies were all with
the man. In You Never Can Tell
that was perhaps right; in Her
Father I am not sure that they
should have been. As an injured
woman Miss Watson is always so
austere; her voice is so—so righteous.
That may be her interpretation of
Mrs. Forster, but I don't think it is
the right one. Mrs. Forster, in tell-
ing her story to Frank, has to break
down and cry; in reproaching Irene
for letting herself care for her father,
to wail (in the charmingly unreason-
able way of women), “You don't love
me any more. No, don't talk to me.
You don't love me any more.” Miss
WATson’s Mrs. Forster would never
have cried, would never have been
unreasonable.
Mr. BourcHIER's performance as
the father was another fine piece of
acting misplaced. Now and then
(I am awfully sorry) Lord Clare-
mont struck me as rather a bounder.
But Irene, who
had already detected lapses in Frank
which nobody else could see, certainly
would not have liked a bounder for a
father. Mr. MARsh ALLEN as Frank
was charming; but then if he was
really a bit of an outsider Mr. ALLEN
should not have been so charming.
And so where are we now? I don't
know. No one of the interpretations
seems to fit in with all of the others.
But if you go to the Haymarket to
see Her Father (as of course you will)
it will not really be to see Her father,
or Her mother, or Her lover, or any-
body else. It will just be to see Her.

“A lady who was visiting Monte Carlo for
the first time, desired to try her luck at the
tables, and being undecided as to what number
to choose, she asked a friend to settle for her.
“Put it on your own age,’ was the reply. So
accordingly the louis was placed on number 25.
When the croupier announced ‘quarante '' that
poor lady's discomfiture told its own tale.”
With great deference to the
authoress who contributed this story
to The Daily Mail, we do not believe
it. And we are surprised that she
should imperil her immortal soul for
the sake of four paltry pips, when
trente-siz would have done almost as
well as quarante, and at the same
time would have had the crownin
merit of being one of the actua
numbers employed in roulette.

THE greatest excitement has been
caused by the discovery—gleaned
from an interview with Dr. B. P.
GRENFELL, the Egyptologist, printed
in The Daily Mail—that in ancient
Iºgypt social life went on more or less
as it does now. One of the wonder-
ful papyri unearthed at Oxyrhynchus
runs thus: , “ Chaeremon invites you
to dine with him at the table of the
Lord Serapis, in the Serapem to-
morrow, which is the 15th of the
month, at nine o'clock.” Such tes-
timony to the modern habits of the
ancient Egyptians has naturally sent
a thrill through the impressionable
heart of Carmelite Street. Think of
it—the ancient Egyptians ate and
gave parties |

Dr. GRENFELL, in a further inter-
view which he granted to ourselves,
has told us several things which he
dared not trust to the youthful yet
brainy emissary of our sprightly con-
temporary. It seems that, again on
the evidence of these papyri, the
ancient Egyptians kept and revered
cats, and, what is more remarkable,
these cats had kittens. Egyptian
Society was divided, much like our
own, into rich and poor; some
of the populace were shopkeepers;
politics and religion had a part in
their lives; they played games; and
when they died they had funerals. It
is all almost too incredible, yet Dr.
GRENFELL assures us that it is true.
More, they read books, and, indeed,
stored a large number in the library at
Alexandria, which unhappily was not
only burned but was not insured.
The ladies wore jewellery, the chil-
dren had toys. . In fact, the only
thing in which the ancient Egyptians
seem to have been poorer than our-
selves was in the lack of a daily press
in which the renascence of wonder is
an every-day occurrence.

It was all very well to dissemble his
love, but why did he catch them and
sell them in the Liverpool market?

IN Sheaves (HEINEMANN) Mr. E. F. BENSON returns
to his old form. His books had been falling off sadly;
the tone had got more morbid, the writing had grown
more and more careless; and in The House of Defence
even his dialogue seemed to have lost the gay sparkle
which had once characterised it. But Sheaves is quite in
his best style: I should put it next to The Challoners
and Limitations. The subject of the story is the love
of a young man for a middle-aged, but still beautiful
woman. Hugh Grainger marries Edith Allbutt, in spite
of her fears for the future when she is old and he is
still only in his prime. But Mr. BENSON does not solve
the problem for us; for Edith dies of consumption. (One
day Mr. BENson will give us a story without a disease
in it.) Hugh, by the way, is a wonderful singer; Edith

the men and women of the story are a bit stagey. The
author does not seem to have quite made up his mind
whether he should write a biography or a novel.
Perhaps the former would have been better. Certainly
the finest chapter in the book is one in which he, un-
restrainedly falling into biographical form, presents a
vivid character-sketch of CLAVERHouse as he moved and

Mary's: “I think you would say he is very gentle-
manly—in the widest sense, I mean, and that covers a
great deal of ground, doesn't it?” What wonder that,
endowed with the three graces of grammar, goodness
and gentility, Mary romps home anyhow. As a matter
of fact she has two admirers—one over sixty, but both
well-to-do—marries the old gentleman first, and is after-
wards re-claimed as a widow by her early love. It is
very hard to make this type of suburban romance
deeply interesting from a serious point of view; and I
don’t know whether anyone, except perhaps Mr. PETT
RIDGE, could do it. But the “wicked sisters '' at least
seem a faithful representation, and, considering that
they have the name of Jellibee to get away from, are
not much to be blamed for their carryings-on.

MUSICAI, NOTES.
MR. HoRNUNg in his new play
Stingaree lays peculiar stress on the
passionate love of music which
dominates all circles of antipodean
society. This is borne out by the
recent epoch-making concert tour of
Count and Countess RUMMERLEY
KENFORD, of which a full account has
been compiled by . Mr. P. F.
WARNUNG. Perhaps the most extra-
ordinary adventure of all was that
which befell them on the voyage from
Yokohama to Adelaide. A charity
concert had been organised for the
benefit of the Stokers and Donkey-
engine Drivers' Widows and Orphans
Fund, at which the Count and
Countess had kindly consented to
officiate. The talented pair were
singing The Night Hymn at Sea,
when an extraordinary commotion
was heard overhead, and two magni-
ficent cachalots, who had leapt on
board, attracted by the divine
melody, hurled themselves down the
companion ladder, and without any
formal introduction burst into the
crowded saloon. The audience were
moved to tears, and the cachalots,
blubbering profusely, presented the
diva with an exquisite bouquet of
seaweed.
Hardly less extraordinary was the
experience of the Count and Countess
on their arrival at Woolloomoolloo.
Their concert was in full swing when
an elderly kangaroo, who had been
accommodated with a fauteuil in the
front row of the stalls, rose, and
in expressive marsupial pantomime
besought the Countess to sing Home,
Sweet Home. Needless to say the
request was at once granted, amid
thunders of applause, the kangaroo
officiating as accompanist with com-
mendable dexterity.
The fondness of the New South
Walians for music has long been pro-
verbial, and is only equalled by their
passion for cricket. Happily an
opportunity was found for gratifying
both these tastes in the match be-
tween Sydney and the famous I
Stingari Club, for which Count
KENFORD kindly consented to play.
In the second innings of the Stingari
an extraordinary incident occurred.
Count KENFORD hit a ball to mid on,
and simultaneously began to sing
BRAHMs’ “Four Serious Songs '' with
such astonishing break of tone that
the whole field were hypnotised, and
the batsmen ran 144 before the §
was returned to the bowler.
The results of the tour may be
thus summed up. Seventeen bush-
rangers have abandoned their calling
and adopted the musical profession.
Forty-one aboriginals have changed
their names to RUMMERLEY or KEN-
Ford. Sixteen wallabies have died
from excess of rapture at hearing the
efforts of the great artists. The re-
cord is, on the whole, most satisfac-
tory, but the Count and Countess
make no secret of their disappoint-
ment at not being kidnapped by the
Mazawattee Indians, as happened to
Mr. and Mrs. BAMBERGER last year.

HINTS ON BRIDGE.
BY DRUCE-Port LAND.
I can Not impress upon my readers too strongly the
paramount necessity of watching the fall of the cards.
People who, after playing a card, take up a book or a
hand-mirror or stroll about the room by way of dis-
traction, till it is their turn to play again, seldom finish
in the front rank. It was my privilege once to watch
a game of bridge being played upon the ruins of San
Francisco, shortly after the earthquake; and I noticed
that one of the players produced no fewer than four
aces of trumps during the course of a single hand. It
would have been impossible for this irregularity to have
been overlooked if his opponents had been carefully
watching the fall of the cards. ... I remember asking a
lady partner, more in a tone of curiosity than of re-
proach, why she had chosen to lead the one particular
card which threw the rest of the game—a no-trump
declaration—into the hands of our opponents. She
replied that she had been busy wondering how she was
to get her luggage on board the liner next day. I felt
a profound admiration for the rare candour of her ex-
planation, but her case affords a terrible example of the
danger of allowing one's thoughts to wander.
On the other hand, I have known a man to watch the
fall of the other players' cards so carefully that he
never noticed what he was playing from his own hand,
with the consequence that he seldom revoked less than
six times an hour. He became unpopular, and eventu-
ally abandoned the pursuit of Bridge. , -
It is not enough to watch the fall of the cards. You
must make deductions from your observations. Some
people merely notice what cards are out, and do not
deduce from their absence what cards are still left in.
Yet this deduction is really a quite simple mental
process; and the strain on the memory becomes less and
less as the game advances, till finally you can tell with
consummate ease what are the four cards that remain
(including your own), even though you may not have the
faintest notion where they lie.
But the process of deduction should go still further.
Thus, from the fact that a player has not followed suit,
even a moderate performer may hazard the conclusion
that he has no more cards of that design. A higher
stage is reached when, for instance, from the playing of
an ace by the third hand during the first round of a suit
you deduce that he either does or does not hold the King,
according as he has played a false or an orthodox card.
Here the question of character comes in. Before a
man will permit himself to play a false card, he must
have sunk to a certain level of depravity. It is therefore
advisable not only to watch the fall of a man's cards,
but also the decline, if any, of his moral standard.
This observance of what I shall call Bridge-character
is a very essential matter. I can illustrate my point
from a game played by an acquaintance whom I may,
I hope without offence, describe as Z. His opponents
(shall we say A and B?) had already been diagnosed
by him on previous occasions; they belonged to the type
that never itself commits a revoke, and only detects it
(or anything else) in others when the circumstances are
peculiarly flagrant. His partner (Y) was a perfect
stranger. Z knew nothing of him, except that he had
the outward bearing of an imbecile. Dummy (B) had
won the first, round of hearts with the King and re-
turned, a small one. The second round was taken by A
with the Queen. A fresh suit was now led, but not
made the deduction that the Ace also lay with A. Two
small hearts remained in Dummy's hand, and two even
smaller in his own (Z's). Z therefore made the further
deduction that his partner had no more of that suit.
Accordingly he took the first opportunity of leading a
third round of hearts for his partner to rough A's Ace.
Judge of his surprise when A roughed his heart, and was
over-trumped by Y. Z at once began to deduce very
smartly. He deduced that his partner had had the Ace
all the time, that it was on the outside of his hand, and
had been mistaken for a blank card, its solitary pip being
obscured by his fat thumb. A revoke therefore had
been made; and a less intelligent student of Bridge-
character would at once have called out to his partner,
“Having no heart?” Not so Z. He swiftly gathered
the trick (which gave them the odd and took them
out), and saying, “We don't want any more, do we,
partner?” threw the rest of his hand across the table
(he would have lost all these last tricks, anyhow), and in
the general confusion the revoke escaped notice.
I say nothing about the morality of Z's behaviour;
I only say that he had a keen flair for Bridge-character,
and was a brilliant deducer. Some people instinctively
carry their observations beyond the point of mere utility
for the purposes of Bridge; after a few hands they can
tell you what are the dominating influences and motives
in the lives of the other players: this one is a confirmed
agnostic; this professing bachelor has a married estab-
lishment in the suburbs; this woman leads a treble life.
It is a superb gift ; but it may always be acquired by
dogged industry and application.
A correspondent, signing himself “Gunner,’’ sends
me an account of an excellent little invention to take the
place of the living voice, and do away with the risk of
vocal insinuations when a player has to declare a suit
or convey any other permissible intelligence.
It consists of an electric indicator, worked by levers
on a junction-board attached to the Bridge-table, and it
causes certain phrases in common use—such as, “No
trumps; ” “I leave it to you; ” “This must positively
be the last rubber, as it is past 3 a.m., and I am
lunching with a Bishop at the Athenaeum ”—to appear
momentarily in bright red letters through the green
baize.
My correspondent also suggests an alternative in the
form of Gramophone Bridge Records by well-known
artistes, and he speaks very highly of Madame TETRAz-
ZINI's “I make it diamonds ''; Mr. HAYDEN CoFFIN's
“IHaving no more?’’; Miss MARIE LLoyd’s “I double '';
and Mr. HARRY LAUDER’s “How 's that for a revoke?”

hard
With facts about the infant Earl and guesses of their

With that he bowed the valet out; he gave the maid a
wink—
Of all polite Inspectors he was certainly the pink. .
They both remarked “So long,” and then sped back to
Belgrave Square, -
And nothing more was heard about the little missing
heir.
The Earl in the Seven Dials grew,
As babies everywhere mostly do.
He seemed to find it a treat to live
On the best that the Dials had to
Such as crusts and meat and a das
In his bottle of milk, to keep him thin.
For Mrs. OATEs had a simple plan
For rearing a right down healthy man:
“Whatever,” she said, “is good for me
Is good enough for the likes of he.”
She never spanked, but she petted him,
And humoured his every infant whim.
The neighbours wondered at first and smiled
At the tales she told them about the child:
For she said that once, when her shop was full,
She had missed a puppy, a brindled bull;
And later on, when the crowd dispersed,
And when in a rage
She searched the cage,
Instead of the pup
The babe turned up,
All properly dressed and nicely nursed.

“I hadn't the heart,” she said, “to out him;
And that 's as much as I know about him.”
Obeying precedent, the years went on
And passed away; the child, obeying, too,
The rule of children, or, at least, of males,
Grew, as I said, and so became a boy.
He had the name of THOMAS : Mrs. OATES
Once had an uncle who adorned that name,
And she bestowed it on the stolen Earl.
His rightful names were six : ALOYSIUs
OTHO FITZw YoraM RUPERT ARTHUR CHARLES;
But now as ToMMY OATEs he shared the fun
Of streets and gutters, and he came to know
How many beans make five; he sucked at ease
The juicy orange or the brandy-ball.
Tip-cats he knew and played; full many an eye
He did endanger, and to sundry hats
Of those who wandered by incautiously
A dent he gave, but minded not at all.
The whirling boxwood of the top he whipped;
The peg-top, too, he very deftly spun,
And raised it in his palm, and tossed it up,
And caught and tossed it spinning yet again.
And language, too, he learnt, the English tongue
As men and women speak it in the Dials : —
“Blimey,” he said, or “Bust my bloomin' eyes,”
“Not arf,” and “Ain’t she got 'em on to-night !”
"This 'ere 's a beano,” when he would imply
That joy and revelry were holding sway—
And many spicy bits of insolence
And repartees as fruity as the vine
That grows in far Oporto's tinted fields.
All these he knew, and much he knew beside:
The lore of birds and beasts, the care of dogs,
And how to groom a Persian kitten's coat.
(To be concluded.)
THE ETIQUEITE OF CALLING ON CABINET MINISTERS.
(As arranged for Ladies intending to join the Woman's
Freedom League.)
By AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT.
As soon as possible after your admission
to the League you will be expected to
call upon the various members of the
Cabinet at their private residences. To neglect this duty
on the pretext of not having an appointment would
betray gross ignorance of the usages current in the
Society to which you have aspired. Be careful not to
call later than 9 a.m. At this hour a Cabinet Minister
is almost certain to be at home—whether instructions
have been given to deny it or not. And he may be
delighted to see you. You never know.
Almost any style of costume may be
worn on these occasions. The less
elaborate it is, the better. “Tammies,”
fur jackets, and short skirts are perhaps most suitable,
while stout walking-boots with double soles are de

rigueur. You will see why presently.
Calls should not be made singly. This
Nº." is never done. As many should call to-
gether as can arrange to do so. The
more the merrier. The majority, however, will remain
on the pavement, while three of the party, selected for
the º stoutness of their boots, ascend the steps.
One of the trio will now knock, while the other two
ring, and this should be continued until it succeeds in
attracting attention from within. But kicking the
panels—except in cases when at least five minutes have
elapsed without response—is a social solecism which
cannot be too carefully avoided.
It is not necessary to explain to the
butler what you have come about. He
will quite understand. If, as is not
unlikely, he assures you that it is
absolutely out of the question for the Minister to receive
you at that moment, you will infer that he is either in
his bath or still in bed. In either case you should
waive your demand for an immediate interview. Tell
the butler that, as a matter of grace, you are willing
to allow his employer twenty minutes to dress. The
door will probably be closed at this stage.
The interval will be spent in consulta-
tions with your colleagues and in
haranguing the crowd which will by this
time have collected. Also, should the front-door—like
those of most London mansions—be of a sombre appear-
ance, you may correct its lack of gaiety by attaching a
coloured poster to the panels. This attention is sure
to be highly appreciated. As soon as the twenty minutes
are up, knock and ring once more.
If the door remains unopened, the proper
course is to leave a bannerette. This
should be of glazed calico, as nearly
white as possible, and bear the words, “Votes for
Women,” in plain black. Coloured or gilded lettering
would be in the worst possible taste. It is more correct
to have the inscription in the middle. The bannerette,
after being well flourished, should be neatly rolled up
and pushed through the letter-slit in the door. It would
make a charming fire-screen, should the owner of the
house be not already provided with one.

for an answer—until, in time, a police-sergeant may re-

II.--A MAN WHO DID. -
About the middle of the seven-
teenth century WILLIAM (afterwards
|Captain) KIDD was born in Scotland.
He could not get on in Scotland
so he got out.
He never did absurd things, such
as washing his neck twice a day, but
from the very first paid his court to
Success, the lady with the big, glad,
welcome smile.
The last words his mother sobbed
out to him at parting were “Make a
Profit,” and he never forgot them.
He said to himself, “Though I am
a KIDD, I will be a man as well.”
If he had stayed in Scotland he
would have probably become a pub-
lican, but he went to the West
Indies and became a privateer.
He never forgot the famous words
of Sir Thomas LIPTON, Bart. : “Re-
member, corkscrews have sunk more
people than cork-jackets will ever
save.” -
Becoming a bold and skilful sailor
he obtained the KING's commissio
to put down piracy. -
He showed the pirates that two
could play at their game. He did
the KING in the eye. He was the
Sunny Jim of the Western Main.
KIDD was no slobberer. He never
got into the soup. He made piles of
gold. He did not trample on the
weak. He simply made them walk
the plank. -
KIDD was a great man, but he lived
too soon. He invented the hidden
gold game, but there was no weekly
paper to organise it properly.
It is true that he was hanged; but
what of that ? He had succeeded
first. He was the foremost pirate of
his time. -
It is better to be successful and be
hanged than to be a failure and die
in a failure's bed.
KIDD's motto was, Do him now.
Make it yours.
WHAT SOCIALISM REALLY
MEANS.
BY ROBERT BLANDMAN.
[NotE.-Articles on “Socialism in the Draw-
ing Room,” “The Socialistic View of the
Septuagint,” “What Socialism will do for
Music,” and “The Happy Socialist” have
appeared elsewhere. For the benefit of those
readers who wish to come to closer grips with
the subject, we have made arrangements with
an eminent Socialist to tell us what Socialism
really means.--EDITOR.]
WHAT is Socialism 2 What will it
do? Why are so many of the great
minds of the day Socialists? How
would a Socialist Government go to
work if it were in power to-day 2
These are some of the questions
which your Editor wishes me to
answer for you.
First of all, then, what is Social-
ism 2 The ignorance which exists in
the minds of Liberals and Tories
alike over this simple question is ap-
palling. Not only appalling, but
criminal.
Suppose that you wanted an
answer to the query “What is
tapioca pudding 2 " How would you
set about it? Well, I suppose you
would first go to your cook. She
would tell you, anyhow, the ingre-
dients of the pudding. More, she
would tell you how it was made, how
served. There her knowledge would
end. She could not give you any
information as to its medicinal
effects; for this you would have to
go to your doctor. Your doctor (if
you found him in) would add to your
knowledge. He would tell you (for
a trifling fee) that tapioca pudding
was invaluable for invalids, easily
digested, a strength-restorer. Good |
You are learning ! But if you are
really desirous of knowing all about
tapioca pudding you will not even
stop here. On leaving your doctor
you will go home to your library and
turn to your Encyclopædia Britan-
nica under T. Here you would be-
come acquainted with the historical
aspect of the matter—the origin of
tapioca. And, perhaps at the end

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
:
of the day, you would really be in a
position to give some sort of answer
to the question “What is tapioca
pudding?" You would not (and
here is my point)—you would not
dismiss it contemptuously as “milky
sort of stuff with blobs in it.”
Very well then. So far we have
got on all right, and can understand
each other. Now apply this to
Socialism. How do our opponents
dismiss this—I say it without fear—
this enormous question of Socialism 2
Contemptuously, as “milky sort of
stuff with blobs in it;” as, that is to
say, a “share-and-share-alike con-
cern,” an “all-men-are-equal show.”
And having assumed that Socialism
is this or that they proceed with a
great flourish to prove how ridiculous
it all is. They don’t, as honest men
would, consult their cook, their doc-
tor, their Encyclopaedia. They have
not read my book “I Don't Think ";
they do not subscribe to my paper
The Blast. They have, in fact, taken
no trouble at all to find out what
Socialism really is.
“All men are equal.” Where
have I said that? Of course all men
are not equal. Is ZBYsco equal to
LITTLE TICH2 Hardly. He is bigger
(is he not ?) to start with. He is
taller. He is more round the chest.
He wrestles, I suppose, with more
skill. On the other hand LITTLE
Tich is, I take it, the more humorous
companion; the lighter on his feet,
the shorter, the less round the
chest. Yet in face of all this our
opponents go about saying that
Socialism pre-supposes that all men
are equall It does nothing of the sort.
Refuting this sort of argument,
however, is really too simple. Let
us take something more difficult. A
writer in a magazine makes parade
of contesting MARx's theory of
economic values. Who is MARx?
I have never read a line of him in
my life. And do I believe in econo-
mic values? How could I? Who is
to decide what is the economic value
of any of us? What is HALL CAINE’s
economic value as compared with
that of Atlas 2 Who is to settle be-
tween HARRY LAUDER and Euclid 2
What is the economic value of MARx
himself, whoever he is? The impos-
sibility of answering these questions
makes it evident that I do not be-
lieve in economic values.
But who said I ever did—except
this magazine writer? I challenge
him to find anything about it in my
book “I Don't Think,” or in my
signed articles in The Blast.
Then what, you ask, do I believe?
I will tell you. I believe in
Socialism. Nay, I will say more. I

will speak not only for myself, but
for my brother Socialists. We all
believe in Socialism, the regenerating
force of the twentieth century.
But what is Socialism? What
does Socialism really mean? Well,
that is what I have been trying to
explain. Once more I will make it
clear even to the dullest intellect.
What is Socialism? Socialism is
simply this – “England for the
English ’’; or, to put it still better,
“Britain for the British.'"
And what will Socialism do? Well,
it will do this. It will make this a
happy England, a contented Eng-
land, a peaceful England. It will
lend a strong hand to the suffering;
it will raise the degraded. Under
Socialism there will be no more
slums, no more unemployed. Under
Socialism we shall dwell together in
unity, loving each other. And this
fair land of ours, this beloved Eng-
land, will smile again, as it smiled in
those far-off days, ere the labourer
had fallen (to his honour) and the
capitalist had risen (to his shame).
And how will it do this?
Well, I can but quote again the
beautiful Socialist motto. Then you
will understand.
“From each according to his
strength; to each according to his
needs.''
There you have it all. A. A. M.

ublish a luminous article by Mr. HUBERT
YNDBLATCH, entitled “What Socialism really
and truly does mean.”—FD.]

House of Commons, Monday, Feb-
ruary 3.—It is written in history that
when Mr. Toots was still a pupil in
Dr. Blimber's educational establish-
ment he occupied his time in writing
long letters to himself from persons
of distinction, addressed “P. Toots,
Esq., Brighton, Sussex.” These he
carefully preserved in his desk, occa-
sionally took out, and re-read with
pleased concern.
Swift MAcNEILL, recalling this in-
cident, held interesting conversation
with the SPEAKER with reference to
case of Member for North-west
Meath, just now in jail on convic-
tion of contempt of court in
connection with cattle-driving. The
lineal descendant (by a collateral
branch) of the late Dean Swift sug-
gested to SPEAKER that Mr. GINNELL
might be supplied with Parliamen-
tary papers and reports just as if he
were in residence at home, instead
of in a building registered as his
Majesty's.
The SPEAKER, ever ready to oblige,
assented. “But,” he added with
habitual caution, “whether he be
permitted to receive them is a matter
over which I have no control.”
Swift MAcNEILL explained what
was desired was that the imprisoned
patriot should have the papers in
order that he might take intelligent
interest in what was going on at
Westminster, might write letters and
conduct his correspondence without
prying interposition on part of prison
authorities. Held out pleasing pros-
pect of Mr. GINNELL occasionally

mollified by this prospect that the
adroit Swift pressed matter a little
further.
“Might not Mr. GINNELL,” he
asked, “be allowed in his retirement
to draw up questions in the usual
manner addressed to Chief Secretary
or other Minister, and have them
printed on the paper?”
“Ah, there you have me,” said
the SPEAKER—not of course precisely

If the prison authorities didn't
object to Mr. Toots (I mean Mr.
GINNELL) writing out questions and
forwarding them per post, the
SPEAKER had no objection to their
appearance on the paper, “pro-
vided,” he added, thinking aloud, as
to amusement of the House his not
infrequent habit is, “it does not pre-
suppose or necessitate the appear-
ance of the hon. member here.”
If Mr. GINNELL’s name appeared
on question paper in the ordinary
manner, the SPEAKER must, when
his turn came, call upon him by
name, well knowing that after his ex-
ertions with other people's cattle
pastured in his native land he was
enjoying a period of rest in a neigh-
bouring country.
“Which,” added the SPEAKER,
happily quoting Euclid, “would be
absurd.”
In the end it was agreed that Mr.
GINNELL might write letters to him-
self or to other public persons, pose
ST. AUGUSTINE with searching ques-
tions “arising out of that answer,”
and generally enjoy himself. Whether
within walls of House of Commons
anything would be heard of corres-
pondence or questions quite another
thing.
On drear night this little episode
gave huge delight. As far as drama-
tis personae concerned the duologue
was perfect. Below the gangway

question by shaking his fist at the
Clerk at the Table, now and then
abruptly stopping to slay with
haughty stare a jeering Ulster
Member above gangway; in the Chair
the gowned and wigged SPEAKER,
with imperturbable countenance,
slowly making reply which, without
obvious intent or apparent self-con-
sciousness, brought out the absurdity
of the situation. -

This last a duty most trying to a
Leader: , Equal danger of overdoing
it or of falling short in due measure
of emotional speech. Happily the
House possesses in Leaders on both
sides masters of the art. Differing in
style, they equally rise to the situa-
tion. PRINCE ARTHUR, alack l still

for a while ST. AUGUSTINE stirred the
stagnant pool with vigorous speech.
Oratorical honours rest with TAY-
PAY. “Somewhat exaggerated elo-
quence,” Robert CECIL sneered.
But it moved a fairly crowded House
on both sides.
For the rest, debate miserably dull.
Situation more depressing by con-
trast with what was anticipated. The
unprecedentedly bad condition of Ire-
land, the criminal incapacity of the
CHIEF SECRETARY on eve of opening
of Session, supplied notes for the
rallying cry of the Opposition. With
drums beating, flags flying, horse,
foot and artillery moving in masses,
they were to advance on a cowering
Ministry and, if not entirely rout
them, administer what the Private
Secretary, in moments of extreme
provocation, was accustomed to de-
scribe as “a good hard knock.”
Behold the battlefield ! A desolate
space, void of movement, life or
colour. Last night a Member sug-
gested that House should be counted.
Not a difficult process. Including
gentleman on his legs, the number
present was four. Division of Parties
nicely balanced; two on one side, two
on the other. At sound of division
bell others trooped in. When
SPEAKER, folded cocked hat in hand,
counted up to forty, they trundled
forth again. A little better to-night,
but not much. Opposition sorely

who could have invested the melan-

A final staggering blow dealt by
DUDLEY. He, a Unionist above re-
proach, rose in thronged House of
Lords, and, speaking with authority
of an ex-Lord Lieutenant, defended
ST. AUGUSTINE’s policy in refraining
from recourse to coercion.
Conclusion came on stroke of

vagabonds AND villains.
I HAVE not yet read Mr. W. J.
LocKE's book, but the Second Act of
his play gave me some idea of
Paragot the Beloved Vagabond—of
Paragot the philosopher, Paragot the
stroller, the artist, the rhapsodist,
Paragot following the open road,
singing in the sun and sleeping
under the hedge, Paragot grasping
the skirts of happy Chance, lending
a hand in the hayfield, fiddling to a
wedding party, drinking deep at an
inn, and for ever scattering his philo-
sophy abroad — the incomparable
Paragot, the Beloved Vagabond, that
divine creature.
This, I suppose,
that her father has been guilty of—
has been indiscreet, the hero con-
sents; he signs a document (oh, these
documents 1) undertaking to absent
himself from Paris for five years
without any explanations to the
lady. Joanna, for no apparent reason,
but in the way of heroines, there-
upon marries Verneuil, who poisons
her mind against her defaulting and
dead lover. (He had mentioned
casually that Gaston was dead.
Naturally she believed him.) Five
years roll by. Werneuil dies. The
beautiful widow discovers her old
lover, who now calls himself Paragot,
still alive in a garret. Misunder-
standings and explanations ensue;
was great enough to be a play in
himself, just as Broadbent is a play
in himself. Just as, too, Mr. Pick-
wick might be; you would not push
him into a farce whose plot turned
upon the coincidence that two people
were both called Smith. The
Beloved Vagabond, in short, would
have been technically a better play,
if Mr. Locke had not worried about
technique; if he had left it to itself,
as Mr. SIIAW left John Bull's Other
Island.
It is because the Second Act and
half of the Third were so good that I
am annoyed with Mr. LocKE for not
giving us more of it. Mr. TREE in
these parts of the play was Paragot
to the life; I can
is Paragot of the
book. But he
was too big, too
unwieldy for the
stage. Too irre-
sponsible also.
“You must have
“form,'” said
Mr. Locke (or
was it Mr.
TREE?). “Your
play wants a be-
ginning and a
middle and an
end. You want
a plot. Now
Paragot is like
good red wine;
an excellent thing
in itself, but you
can't have it run-
ning about all
over the place,
just where it
likes. You want
it neatly bottled.
Any old bottle
will do.” But

his mistake, for

he forgot that the
wine was new, and he pushed poor
Paraqot into the oldest bottle he
could find. There are many old stage
bottles (I must keep my metaphor) to
be found on the Surrey side of the
river, and the oldest of them is this.
The hero—well, let us give them
the names which their latest sponsor
has chosen—Gaston de Nerac, then,
the hero, called briefly “the most
wonderful man God ever made ''
(and to be known in the Second Act
as Paragot) is engaged to Joanna
Rushworth. Joanna's father, Lord
Rushworth, is in difficulties; unless
he can find £20,000 he must go to
prison. The Comte de Verneuil (hal
the villain () offers to pay the money
if Gaston will resign his claim to the
lady. To save her the knowledge
but at last he takes her in his arms.
Curtain.
Now there you really have a plot;
but what the dickens, I ask, is
Paragot doing in it? Any Brown or
Robinson would have acted in much
the same way. He would have
signed the document and left the
lady to his rival; in the Third Act he
would have had misunderstandings
and reconciliations. The only differ-
ence would have been that Robinson
in the five years' interval (in the
great Second Act, that is to say)
would have gone up to the City as
usual, trying to drown his sorrow in
work; while Paragot spent them
gloriously on the open road.
Mr. Locke should have had the
courage of his creations. Paragot

pointed. It was entirely the fault of
the squatters, who never got into the
Bush at all, but remained at the
back-blocks. However, I mustn't
be too technical.
That nobody was shot was, I think,
a mistake of Mr. HoRNUNG's. I
could have spared Bracy. When
Bracy drew a bead on Stingaree the
latter might have sighted him
through his hip-pocket and shot him
in the wrist. This is often done.
Instead, Stingaree hands over his
gun with the words “Take two.”
Even so, things might have hap-
pened. Bracy might have dropped
his shooter and taken the other's, with
the poetical idea of killing a bush-
ranger with his own weapon. It would
then have transpired that Stingaree
(who knew the idea) had given him
an unloaded one. Exit Bracy.
Of course I quite see Mr. HoRN-
UNg's difficulty. He had to make his
hero a romantic fellow—good at
heart, you know, but a little hasty.
So when he held up the mail it was
simply to get the papers and see how
many TRUMPER had made; and when
he took your watch it was only
because he wanted to know the
right time. And he had never,
never killed a man in his life—only
a rabbit, I swear. Of course, then,
he couldn't have killed Bracy. But
a flesh-wound nobody would have
minded. A small flesh-wound on the
fiftieth night, please, Mr. HoRNUNG.
However, shots or no shots,
damper or no damper, the play is de-
cidedly interesting and picturesque.
Mr. HENRY AINLEY made an excellent
Stingaree; certainly a much better
one than I had anticipated. But
then he has a deal of love-making to
do, and I had expected scalps. As the
heroine Hilda Bouverie, Miss HILDA
ANToNY looked charming, and sang
delightfully. Three years elapse be-
tween the first three Acts and the
fourth (personally I smoked a cigar-
ette), and in some wonderful way
Miss ANTONY, who had been, I sup-
pose, twenty-two in the First Act,
really looked three years older. The
others hadn't altered a bit. M.

times turning to the end to see if she marries him or
not. But not so with Mr. R. A. Scott-JAMEs. To him
a novel is a symptom, a portent, a straw to show which
way the wind is blowing. No sooner, does he read a
novel than he pigeon-holes its author either among the
decadents or the mystics, the protesting apostles or
the pessimists, the fugitives or the borderlanders. , Mr.

MORE PAGEANT NOTES.
THE postponement of the London
Pageant until 1909 gives time to the
leading actors to allow the natural
changes through which their counten-
ances have to pass to be more gradu-
ally consummated. Mr. STEAD, for
example, who, on being cast for
OLIVER CROM well, announced his in-
tention of sacrificing his beard, will
now be able to shorten that orna-
ment by such easy stages that when
the time comes none of his friends
will notice the transformation—just
as MILO carried a calf so consistently
that it grew into perfect cowhood in
his arms practically unobserved.
Great competition has, it is said,
already set in for the rôle of Dick
WHITTINGTON. Mr. Louis WAIN at
present is first favourite, being a safe
draw with a cat; but both the part-
ners in the firm of GIDDY AND GIDDY
are in the running on the strength
of their capacity for turning again.
Mr. FRANK WHISKERson, whose in-
tention, it is said, is to play either
Lord Dundreary or Blue Beard,
according to the impulse of the
moment, Blue Beard's early days
having been spent between Maiden
Lane and Doctors' Commons, will
now be able to subject his chin to
that prolonged and careful irrigation
without which no really satisfying
face fungus can be provoked.
The Old Lady of Threadneedle
Street will be an interesting character
in the Pageant. For her costume
Mr. PIERPONT MoRGAN is lending a
dress length of cloth of gold as used
at the famous field meeting between
HENRY VIII. and KING FRANCIS. It is
doubtful as to who will represent this
mother of millions, but the names of
both Mrs. EDDY and Madame
HUMBERT have been mentioned.
To prevent facetiousness the part of
HENRY VIII. will be taken by the
head waiter of the Bachelors Club.
The part of Edward THE BLAck
PRINCE will be given to BookER
WASHINGTON, who will be in England
for the season.
Another rôle for which there are
many claimants is that of Sir WALTER
RALEIGH, the salient point in his
career that has been chosen being
the lighting of his first cigar. No
other smoking will be allowed in
the Pageant. The choice of the
Committee is expected to fall upon
Mr. BARRIE.
There is no truth in the statement
that Sir RAY LANKESTER will take the
part of Gog.
A number of Suffragettes will walk
in procession to symbolise the great
city's out-skirts.
Some odd anomalies are promised.
Thus the part of Sir CHRISTOPHER
WREN has fallen to Lord HAWKE.
The Plague of London will be
represented by [No, we daren't.
—ED.] Dr. SALEEBY will take a
prominent part in the Pageant.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WEEK OF MY LIFE AT ETON,
NEW STYLE.
[By permission of the Headmaster of Eton,
an address was recently delivered to the whole
school by Mr. GRAY, of “The Manchester
Marchers” (unemployed)].
April lº the entire staff
of assistant masters left and the new
system of open-air instruction by out-
side experts began. In the morning
Mr. W. P. BYLEs lectured on “The
Dangers of Militarism,” with special
reference to public school cadet
corps. Meeting broken up in conse-
quence of allusion to the bloodthirsty
cruelty of British soldiers. Mr.
BYLEs rescued by the Headmaster
and conveyed to the station under
police escort. In the afternoon ad-
dress from Miss CHRISTABEL PANK-
HURST on “The Cruelty of Boys,”
with cornet solos and collection on
behalf of imprisoned Suffragettes.
April 2. — Visit of Mr. Victor
GRAYson, and address on “Socialism
for Schoolboys." Eloquent appeal to
all sons of peers to disown their
parents, discard all titles, and re-
pudiate all debts. Mr. GRAYson
carried shoulder high to the river,
and taken to the station on one of the
Royal Humane Society's drags. In
the afternoon lecture by Mr.
CLARENCE Rook of The Daily Chroni-
cle on “The Tyranny of the Bath.”
Mr. Rook also carried shoulder high
to the river.
April 3.−A quiet day. In the
morning Mr. PIERPONT MoRGAN ad-
dressed the school on “The Irredu-
cible Minimum of Pocket Money.”
The great financier said that the
burning question in England, and in-
deed America, at the present time
was, “Could a self-respecting Etonian
manage to exist on 200 dollars a
term?” . After describing the ardu-
ous youth and early privations of
CATO MAJOR, Lord Rothschild, Mr.
RocKEFELLER, and Mr. ANDREW
CARNEGIE, he said that the task was
herculean, but not impossible, given
that self-denial and Spartan frugality
which had always been the distin-
guishing feature of the British aris-
tocracy. . . (Great cheering.) There
was nothing wrong in the desire to
possess money. As the Latin poet
put it, the auri fames was sacra or
holy. It was the use one made of it
which mattered. A welcome feature
of the address was that there was no
collection. In the afternoon Mr.
G. K. CHESTERTON lectured on the
“Evolution of the Eton Jacket,” in
which he found a complete refutation
of the Darwinian hypothesis of the
simian ancestry of man, He added
that he was having an Eton jacket
built for him by PoolE, to wear with
a Panama hat and a pair of accor-
dion-pleated bloomerloons. (Cheers.)
April 5.-A delightful lecture this
morning from Lady GRove on
“Social Solecisms.” The Head-
master introduced the lecturer as a
lady who had risen superior to her
status and fearlessly exposed the
petty shibboleths of caste. (Loud
cheering.) After the first part of the
lecture, which was devoted to pro-
nunciation, an examination paper
was set in the names of the aris-
tocracy, full marks being awarded to
Isidore GoLDBERGHEIMER. To cele-
brate the event a half-holiday was
given the school, and the lecture on
“Emperors I have Exhausted,” by
Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUx, postponed
till next term.
April 6.-This morning we had a
surprise lecture from Mr. A. C.
BENson on “What I would do if I
were Headmaster of Eton.” The
Headmaster, introducing Mr. BEN-
son, said that the subject of the
lecture was apparently somewhat
irregular, but hypothesis was always
fruitful, and it was the duty of all
generous public school boys to hear
all sides, no matter how unpalatable.
Mr. BENSON then began his lecture
by saying that if he were called on to
undertake the post of Headmaster of
Eton the first thing he would have to
do would be to give up writing any
more books. This announcement
was greeted with such a tempest of
dissent that the lecturer found it im-
possible to proceed, and the whole
school spent the rest of the morning
in playing the new games of Huma-
nitarian Hockey and Socialistic
Spillikins.
April 7.-This morning the school
were summoned to attend a contro-
versial debate between Sir OLIVER
LoDGE and Mr. PETER KEARY on
“Success and How to Achieve It.”
The Headmaster introduced the dis-
putants as two of the master minds
of the age, and begged the school
to give them an attentive hearing.
OLIVER LODGE told us that what we
had to do was to spiritualise our in-
tellects. PETER KEARY said this was
all bilge. Life was a wrestling match
on the catch-as-catch-can principle,
and if OLIVER hadn't asked for more
he would now be lodging on the cold
ground. Ultimately the Headmaster
had to separate the combatants and
administer first aid to both.

sented to the Headmaster, signed by
the entire school, begging for
the reinstatement of the assistant
masters and the abandonment of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LITTLE TALK ABOUT TORTOISES.
(With reference to a particular case.)
In all probability there are few men now living who
can claim to be as intimately acquainted as I am. with
the idiosyncrasies of the Common Tortoise. This is not
boasting—it is simply stating a plain fact. I ought to
know something about Tortoises, after having kept them
as pets, employed them as paper-weights, and used
them (occasionally) as missiles, for a period of several
years. I ought to—and I do. Only this afternoon, in
the window of a certain West-End shop where they
sell kindergarten toys, I happened to see a glass jar con-
taining what had once been a rather ordinary tortoise.
It was now preserved in spirits of wine, and its under:
shell had been removed to afford a view of its internal
arrangement. Altogether, it formed an instructive, if
not a pleasing, plaything for the young. Well, my own
studies had been purely psychological—and yet this
anatomical revelation came as no surprise to me ! It
was so exactly what I had always felt intuitively
that a tortoise would be like inside
Sympathy, in my case, had supplied the lack of biolo-
gical research. My taste for tortoises began on the day
I first bought three off a barrow in Oxford Street;
the man wanted half-a-crown apiece for them, I
remember, but I got a reduction in taking a
quantity. Ah, sturdy old “Samson,’’, frolicsome
young “Absalom,” and shy, bright-eyed little “Lady
Godiva" [I always prided myself on finding appro-
priate names for my tortoises] even as I pen these
lines I seem to see your friendly faces around me once
more | I do not keep any now, having taken to a
motor-car instead; but to this day the most casual refer-
ence to a tortoise will strike a responsive chord on my
heart-strings, assuming (I have already implied that I
am no anatomist) that organ to be constructed on
the principle of a harp. Poets seem to think
so—and they may be right. Anyway, the reader is
now in a position to understand the vibrating thrill of
emotion which I experienced the other day on reading
| the following pathetic appeal to the Editor of The Daily
Mail : —
“Sir, (it began, quite simply) I have had a tortoise
for many years, and every winter it has been in the
habit of going to sleep from October until March. This
| winter, however, it has not done so, and has been as
lively as it generally is in summer, eating, drinking, and
| roaming about the house, and sleeping only at night.
Can anyone enlighten me as to the reason of its strange
behaviour ! ”
I would gladly do all in my power to allay the writer's
very natural anxiety—but before I can speak with any
certainty I should require rather more precise informa-
tion. How lively, for instance, is this gentleman's
tortoise generally, in summer? ... Is it just sedately
cheerful, as a well-regulated reptile should be, or does
it eat and drink to excess, and then proceed to riot about
the house? A great deal would depend on this. My
poor “Podasokus"—one of the most promising young
| tortoises I ever possessed—perished of premature decay,
entirely brought on by want of ordinary self-control.
Then what about the family history of The Mail cor-
| respondent's tortoise? I mean, is there any hereditary
tendency to insomnia? Is he quite certain that it ever
| does go to sleep, even at night? It may lie awake and
| brood; it is not generally known, but some tortoises are
rather liable to morbid introspection. I don't quite like
its habit of roaming all over the house—it seems to
point to its having something on its mind. Grief, pos-
sibly, or remorse. Which reminds me of “Barbara,’’’
an extremely amiable tortoise I once owned (we called
it “Barbarossa’’ for a long time, but had to alter the
name when it laid an egg unexpectedly). Well, “Bar-
bara '' struck up a sort of friendship with a tortoiseshell
Tom of ours. They used to play together—at least,
the Tom would sit by “Barbara's " shell and claw her
head the moment it protruded. It seemed a poor game
from “Barbara's '' point of view, but she and the cat
understood one another. She used to take him out
poaching; or else the cat took her out poaching—we
were never quite sure which. And one day “Barbara ''
came back from the coverts alone, with every sign of
agitation and concern. On examining her shell, I found
it dinted as though by a charge of small shot. Later we
discovered the body of the cat lying in the bracken,
and guessed what had happened—a keeper must have
fired at “Barbara,” and the shot had ricoché'd. But
“Barbara '' couldn't forgive herself for the accident.
For weeks she rambled restlessly up and down stairs,
searching for her lost playfellow, and mewing, as tor-
toises will in distress, like a kitten | Eventually Time
the Consoler brought oblivion; but “Barbara " never
quite recovered her former spirits. (I sent a full account
of all this at the time to The Spectator, but they didn't
put it in. I don't know why.)
If the abnormal restlessness cannot be accounted for
in any of these ways, it may arise from some premoni-
tion of danger. A tortoise has a singular instinct for
foreseeing peril, , and will often display remarkable
courage and resolution when the emergency arises. I
had a very worthy tortoise once of the name of
“Archibald,” which, when autumn came round,
could not be induced to hibernate as usual, either
by persuasion or threats—and I tried both. One
or two neighbouring houses had been broken into
recently—but it never occurred to me that the fact
could have any connection with “Archibald's '' extra-
ordinary conduct.
One night, however, I became aware that there was a
burglar in the room immediately below mine. I heard
him so distinctly that it was unnecessary to go down and
investigate. I knew that, if I could only retain suffi-
cient presence of mind to stay in bed, the burglar would
go away in time of his own accord. Not that this one
did; they found him next morning in a swoon under
the sideboard, with “Archibald " still hanging gamely
on to his left calf -
The burglar was very unwell afterwards—and so was
“Archibald.” Blood-poisoning was said to be the
cause in both cases. I fancy the burglar must have
been in poor health at the time. Thanks, however, to
careful nursing, each recovered; “Archibald " retiring,
when convalescent, for his annual rest-cure, while the
burglar was ultimately removed to Dartmoor. (I sent
this anecdote, too, to The Spectator—but they never
published it. I don't think the Editor takes much
interest in tortoises.)
Is it not just possible that The Daily Mail gentleman's
tortoise may really be fast asleep all the time—in short,
a somnambulist? If so, he should be careful not to
awake it too suddenly, as I did my poor “Matilda"—a
lovable but sadly neurotic creature. I acted entirely
for the best--but I see now that it was a mistake to
restore her to consciousness by such means as a soda-
water syphon. She survived, it is true—but with a
reason permanently unhinged. -
One last explanation occurs to me: I recollect being
completely mystified once by the unaccountable pro-

ceedings of another tortoise I had, which I called “Hop-
lite.” Its temperament, which hitherto had shown no
trace of levity, suddenly became almost painfully frivo-
lous and irresponsible. I could not imagine what on
earth possessed the thing! But at length I found out
that an acquaintance, whose psychical powers have
been exceptionally developed, had taken what I must
describe as the unpardonable liberty of hypnotising the
unhappy animal without my permission. He had actu-
ally impressed it with the conviction that it was a hare
I have only volunteered these reminiscences and
suggestions because I cannot bear to see any man in
trouble about his tortoise without making some attempt

there may not be anything very serious the matter with
the tortoise. F. A.

THE LOST HEIR.
SyNOPSIs.
[The Earl of BRASENose, son of the Duke and Duchess of BATTLEDown,
carelessly mislaid by the Duchess when he is eight months old, has
been j by Mºw... OATEs, the ducal coachman; He hands
the child over to his mother, the proprietress of an animal shop in the
Seven Dials. She brings the Earl up to the best of her ability, and
under her care, while ignorant of his noble origin, he acquires a fine
sporting command of the English language as spoken in the Dials. He
passes under the name of Thomas OATES.]
PART IV.
IN Battledown House from day to day
Affairs went on in the usual way.
One child they had had and lost : no other
Was ever to call the Duchess mother.
A house with never a girl or boy
Is certainly not a house of joy;
But after all, when you own a yacht,
A moor, a forest, and quite a lot
Of castles and palaces here and there,
The grief you feel for a missing heir
Instead of being a wild crescendo
Is apt to be planned on a diminuendo.
And so, having passed through the first mad flurry
Of loss, they finally ceased to worry.
But still at times the Duchess felt a sense of something
lacking, -
A something quite elusive that she couldn't well
define;
That came upon her suddenly when breakfasting, or
packing,
Or sitting at the opera, or going out to dine.
A sort of void that didn't ache, but yet possessed an
ache or two,
That sometimes made her somnolent and sometimes
seemed to wake her, too;
That sometimes made her garrulous and sometimes
made her still,
Determined or affectionate or quite bereft of will.
She took to keeping tortoises; she had a cage of bats;
A pink-eyed rat became her joy, a very queen of rats.
She thought of breeding yaks and gnus; she had a tank
of seals;
A score of twinkle-footed “Poms '' went yapping at her
heels.
And, spite of all the Duke could say his town house
came to be,
Instead of being fit for him, a vast menagerie.
A keeper being requisite, she went to WILLIAM OATEs:
She said, “I want a lively boy to come and groom their
coats;
To feed them when it's time for food, and generally do
Whatever may be good for them. I don't know one;
do you?''.
Now Mr. WILLIAM OATES was growing old :
And sometimes, as will happen with the old,
His conscience pricked him for that he had filched
The little Earl and never said a word.
Oh, what a chance was here ! He might restore
A son to both his parents, not, of course,
As being their son, but in another guise;
And Fate, that weaves our lots to all of us,
To Dukes and Duchesses and coachmen, too,
And lads and ladies of the Seven Dials—
Fate would provide the sequel and the end.
So thought, so done. “Your Grace,” he said, “I know
A sturdy boy, a very willing boy: —
He 's twelve years old, and all his life was spent
With fur and feather. He can come at once.
OATES is his name, he being, I believe,
My mother's uncle's cousin's aunt's first cousin,
Or something similar that makes him kin
To me and mine.” “Engage him,” said the Duchess.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“TAXIMO.”—Your best plan, if you want to take a
licensed motor-cab from the rank in Piccadilly or at
Hyde Park Corner, is to knock at the door of the
Shelter, raise your hat, drop on bended knee, and
implore one of the haughty ones for his patronage. He
will ask you contemptuously where you want to go, and
you had better leave in his hands the choice of your
destination. You may with luck be taken somewhere,
but your chance will be greatly reduced if a gramophone
concert is going on at the time inside the Shelter.
“LITTLE NAVY.”—So you prefer Old Age Pensions
to an adequate Fleet 2 But have you properly con-
sidered whether we should be in a position to enjoy to
the full our Old Age Pensions if we had already perished
in our beds at the hand of the Invader? You should
consult Mr. Asquith. He is said to have very firm
views on the question.
“PRO-ZAKKA.”—You are wrong in supposing that a
week-end in Bombay is all that you want. Ten days
is the minimum period of residence in India required
to give you a real inside experience of the religious,
political and social life of the numerous races which
make up its native population. That great expert
Dr. RUTHERFORD took no less than six weeks to perfect
his first-hand knowledge of our Indian Government's
“misrule.’’
“PITITE.”—We understand that after the passing of
Mr. WILL THORNE's Eight Hours For Everybody Bill
the universal working day will be from 10 to 6. En-
quiries at the best Working-Men's Clubs show a general
expression of feeling that this arrangement will conflict
less than any other with the convenience of the labour-
ing classes.
“CANTAB."—We do not share your discouragement
on reading in The Pall Mall Gazette that several of the
Cambridge crew “seem unable to hit the water during
the swing forward.” We have met winning crews
before now who steadily declined to collide with the
river in this manner. “See our oars with feathered
spray '' was written by a poet, and he knew no better.
“ANTI-SUFFRAGETTE.”—You are quite wrong in sup-
posing that “Pantechnicon '' is derived from two
Greek words, pan, black, and technicon, Maria. By
derivation it really means something “altogether
artful.’’
“INDIGNANT MALE.”—We cannot go with you so far
as to say that the responsible Press of this country is
in the pay of the Suffragettes. But we admit that the
service rendered to their cause by the persistent publi-
cation of the names of every obscure female who gets
herself arrested by a reluctant policeman gives colour
to your grave suspicion.

GENERAL ORDERs.
Feb., 1908.
Owing to the well-known fact that
Englishmen, after a month's resi-
dence in a British Colony or Posses-
sion, become ferocious savages, it is
important that the attention of all
ranks should be specially called to
the following orders: —
1. Contrary to the usual practice,
women and children captured on this
expedition will not be flayed alive.
2. The regulations till now in force,
cnjoining the sacking, burning, and
laying waste of the entire country,
will be suspended from this date.
Any man found setting fire to a stone
sangar will have his matches confis-
cated, and will send a written
apology to the landlord.
3. In the event of an officer or
soldier fracturing the greenhouses,
hothouses, and conservatories on the
line of march, and plucking the rare
tropical fruits therein contained, he
and his regiment will be at once sent
to the base; and a new greenhouse,
hothouse, or conservatory (as the
case may be) will be forwarded per
runner, and charged on the barrack
damages of the unit in question.
4. It having been brought to the
notice of the G.O.C. that firearms
have been found in the possession of
some individuals of the Expedi-
that this unauthorised practice must
be discontinued. It cannot be too
strongly impressed upon all con-
cerned that any hint of violence is
foreign to the purpose of the expedi-
tion, and must be rigorously avoided.
5. It is now well understood that
the Zakka Khels are in reality per-
fectly peaceful persons, who only
give way to murder and robbery as
the result of an emotional tempera-
ment. Being gentle and timid by
nature, they must not be alarmed by
the sudden appearance of a combined
body of troops The advance will
therefore be carried out in ones and
twos at 100 yards interval. The
files will stroll forward carelessly (but
keeping strictly to their alignment
and dressing), and chat lightly on

ER—BY THE way, I suppose IT was My UNcle who D1ED, AND NOT yours?”
PEARCE AND PLENTY.
DEAR Mr. Punch, –While Mr.
Robert PEARce's Bill for Providing
More Daylight is before the public, I
want to enlist your sympathies for a
similar little project of my own.
This scheme is to provide everyone
with more money by renaming the
various coins now in circulation. It
is extremely simple, perfectly prac-
tical, and the general verdict can
only be one of amazement that no
one has thought of it before. There
will be no disorganisation of the cur-
rency, no calling in of the coins, and
no new and elaborate machinery
required.
I simply propose to call the shilling
a sovereign and to regard it as one.
The consequence is that it becomes
a sovereign. The sixpence I call
half - a - sovereign; the threepenny-
piece a crown. In the bronze series
the penny becomes a shilling, the
halfpenny sixpence, and the farthing
threepence. I admit that this ad-
justment presents a slight discrep-
ancy, as the man who has thought-
fully provided himself with a large
reserve of threepenny pieces (pre-
sumably for charitable purposes) will
find himself at a financial advantage
º with his neighbour whose
small change is composed exclusively
of bronze. Do you think that it
would be practicable, while regarding
the single penny as a shilling, to
accept the tender of three together as
equivalent to five shillings, or does
this, in your opinion, detract from the
rigid simplicity of the scheme?
The gold certainly seems to present
some features that call for a little
manipulation. . My first impulse was
to accept the sovereign as a five-
pound note, but as we already have
the shilling (old style) as a sovereign
the proportion would tend to bring
gold into disrepute and to demoralise
the money market. I should propose,
therefore, to regard the sovereign as
a twenty-pound note, the fiver as a
one-hundred pound note, and so on.
The chief difficulty lies in making a
start, but I find people wonderfully
intelligent. I explained the scheme
yesterday to PUMMET, my occasional
gardener. After listening attentively
he said, in his slow way, ‘: Well, sir,
why not make the start yourself?
Then I daresay others would follow.”
“Certainly, PUMMET,” I replied,
thinking that the occasion might
serve for a little pleasantry; “I will.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Feb-
ruary 10. — PRINCE ARTHUR back
again, showing evident signs of recent
illness. Would do better to take a
fortnight's holiday in sunnier clime.
But duty calls to Westminster, and
hither he comes. Hearty cheer, in
which both sides join, welcomes him.
C.-B., who also looks as if he, too,
were better in bed, rising to reply to
question, gives graceful expression
to the meaning of the cheer. As the
incident closes, news comes from
across the way that Leader of
House of Lords has been bowled
over by common enemy. Thus, in
the midst of life, are we in grip of
influenza.
Member long familiarly known as
SAM Eva NS also comes back, bring-
ing his sheaves with him in shape
of Solicitor-Generalship and a Knight-
hood. (Mustn't call him SAM any
more, but to begin with Sir SAMUEL
seems rather a mouthful.) Towards
close of sitting he made first appear-
ance on Treasury Bench in new
Ministerial capacity. General cheer
testified to appreciation of merit and
wide approval of its guerdon. It
has been won by sheer capacity, un-
assisted by adventitious circum-
stances. Loyal to his Party, S. T.
has never been abjectly subservient
to the Whip. Has, indeed, on more
than one occasion been embarrass-
ingly independent, which makes the
appointment more honourable on
both sides.
New Solicitor-General is formidable
recruit to already overwhelming de-
bating force on Treasury Bench.
Among private Members SARK always
placed him in first rank. He is ab-
solutely free from that peculiar, in-
definable atmosphere with which
what Dizzy used to call “gentlemen
of the long robe '' surround them-
selves when addressing House of
Commons. HERSCHELL was conspicu-
ous exception. So was EDWARD
CLARKE. In present day. Asquith
succeeds. Would be much easier to
mention names of men who carry all
before them at the Bar, but here suc-
ceed chiefly in moving Members
towards the door. As they address
“M” Lud '' in the SPEAKER's Chair
you can almost hear the rustle of
silken gowns worn elsewhere.
From the first, SAM Evans caught
on the indescribable, incommunica-
ble House - of- Commons manner.
Alert, resourceful, fluent, he has
the gift of humour whose price
is above rubies. One night during
last Parliament, dropping in whilst

Minister in charge of a Bill was con-

reply. Subject one with which he
was intimately acquainted. Only
difficulty was he had not heard the
discourse to which he volunteered
answer. That would have discom-
fited some men. S. T. pounded
along, cautiously at first, but, assisted
by whispered hints from friends who
had heard the speech, he accom-
plished a brilliant reply that left the
wondering Minister overwhelmed.
Business done.—Army Supplemen-
tary Vote agreed to in time to get off
for eight o'clock dinner.
Tuesday.—If you want to make
your flesh creep, John RochE is your
man. Nature has gifted Member for
East Galway with advantages un-
known to the Fat Boy. Sombre in
appearance, mysteriously low in
voice, prone to pauses in which the
shivering listencr imagines he sees
fresh horrors, he held the House in
thrall whilst he disclosed newly dis-
covered plot for the defamation of
Ireland.
Of course an Irishman was the
alleged conspirator. It is the crown-
ing sadness of Ireland that its
enemies are those of its own house-
hold, its traitors nourished within its
own camp.
John was so appalled by fresh in-
famy he had unearthed that he found
it difficult fully to open his mouth in
articulation of the narrative. This,
combined with fine Galway accent,
made story difficult to follow in all its
details. No doubt, however, that
Lord AshTown was suspected of
being at bottom of bad business.
Nationalist idea of that nobleman
fantastically melodramatic. When
they draw him it is done in the
“two-pence coloured '' style of Early
Victorian dramatic portraiture. He
is the landlord who, according to
popular belief, recently blew himself
up. Obviously a work of supereroga-
tion. Plenty of patriots ready to blow
up an Irish landlord, figuratively or
bodily, without troubling him to take
a hand in act of discipline.
John Roche has discovered fresh

==
eccentricity on part of this hapless
nobleman. It is alleged that Lord
Ashtown, in the solitude of his
chamber, the blackness of his heart,
devised a little scheme excelling in
childish melodrama the earlier plot
attributed to him. He wrote anony-
mous letters to five of John's blame-
less constituents, inciting them at a
certain hour to blow up the village
church, including the Priest and con-
gregation. This done, he with super-
human cunning communicated with
the police, informing them that at
such an hour on such a day the
murderous attempt would be made,
warning them to be on the spot to ||
arrest the intending malefactors.
In support of his case JoHN
read the letter. From conditions
hinted at, he was not audible
throughout, a circumstance which,
designedly or not, contributed to
eeriness of episode. In Mrs. RAD-
CLYFFE's novels candle usually went
out in turret room of moated castle at
critical moment. So our John, when
he came to particularly blood-curd-
ling passage in the narrative, dropped
his voice to hoarse whisper. Mem-
bers craning their necks caught here
and there a sentence in which ToM,
the person addressed, was warned
not to make mistake and place the
bomb at the wrong door; was further
entreated, if he was afraid of the job,
to hand it on to another patriot—the
job being the blowing up of his be-
loved Priest and the slaughter of his
neighbours. All discussed in fluent,
precise, unemotional phrase, as if
the matter at issue were sale of a
pound of butter or a pint of butter-
milk. The letters, it is true, were
anonymous. But John knew they
were written by Lord Ashtown.
Why? Because he was in Dublin
the day they were posted, and the
letters bore the Dublin postmark.
Q.E.D.
This is trivial. All the same there
remains the admitted fact that Lord
Ashtown informed the police that
on the night of the 31st August,
the date fixed in the anonymous
letter, outrage would be attempted
on the church in question. On the
face of it a remarkable case of
second sight.
Business done.—Vote of £2,500 on
account of law charges in Ireland
agreed to. As SARK says, If there is
no law in Ireland there are law
charges. CARSoN, momentarily drop-
ping Party feeling in professional
pride, admitted gratification in re-
flecting that the money went into the
pockets of the lawyers.

DIANA OF THE CROSS FACE.
THE prospect of a scene in a shop-
dormitory, with the “ young ladies ''
undressing for bed, threatens to
draw half the manhood of London to
the Kingsway Theatre to see Diana
of Dobson's. But when I say that
the only visible nightdress—stuffy
pink flannelette—is drawn on over the
whole of the owner's clothes, with the
exception of her skirt and bodice—it
will be seen that the standard of pro-
priety is a lofty one. For the rest,
the scene is human enough ; and it is
only Diana herself that here, as in
the Third Act, disturbs the atmo-
sphere of probability with her shrill
platitudes. The play indeed is a
curious medley of rant and reserve.
Nothing could be more admirable
than the restraint of the Fourth Act
—on the Embankment—with
everybody playing in quiet
undertones. And nothing could
be much more blatant than the
outburst of Diana in the Third
Act, when she finds that the son
of a peer is a little disappointed
to learn that she is a penniless
shopgirl, and not a woman of his
own caste with a moderately
comfortable revenue—as she had
given everybody to understand.
One of these days we must have
a play written round an ill-paid
shopwalker who poses, out at
St. Moritz, as a gentleman of
leisure. He shall engage the
affections of a Duke's daughter,
and then, when she flinches on
learning the facts, he shall abuse
her at the top of his voice for a
contemptible snob for whom a
world of honest workers has no
sort of use. And the clever
author of Diana of Dobson's shall be
asked to occupy the stage-box, and
see herself as we other men see her
in her present play.
All the same, the occupants of the
Pit had a glorious evening. Accom-
modated in the last row of the stalls
—a place of splendid vantage—my
spinal cord trembled to every spasm of
their emotions. Loud and irrepres-
sible giggles greeted the dormitory
scene. The sentiment of the play—
never too subtle—went straight home
to their bosoms; its humour—seldom
too recondite—to their intelligence.
Personally I was not very happy
about that charming actress Miss
LENA Ashwell. It may be that the
dismal character of her accustomed
rôles has affected her manner; but
she wore almost throughout an air
of rather repellent boredom; when she
spoke in low tones, it was a sort of
monotonous recitative; her higher
notes were metallic and harsh. In
the First Act she promised to drink
with great gaiety the swift cup of joy
as far as her legacy of £300 would
allow her; but nobody who saw her
in the earlier of the two scenes at
Pontresina, when she was supposed
to be gyrating in a very vortex of de-
light, would have guessed, so colour-
less and sombre was her bearing, that
she was having the time of her life.
True, the company at the hotel were
a dullish lot; but she might have
moved on if they weren't to her
liking. -

men, and then perhaps he wouldn't
stroke the back of his head quite so
much, or twist his body into such
stagey curves, or use his mouth as if
he were illustrating a primer of elocu-
tion. He was best in seedy clothes
on the Embankment, when the
L.C.C. seat limited his attitudes,
and his pipe was of the essence of the
action, instead of being just a stop-
gap like the eternal cigarette of the
Pontresina episodes. Miss FRANCEs
Ivor, as Mrs. Cantelupe, must have
modified her manner a good deal
by the second night (when I saw
her) if one of the first-night critics
was right in charging her with ex-
travagance. Miss GERTRUDE Scott,
on the other hand, played the part of
Mrs. Whyte Fraser with an absurd
exaggeration of emphasis. Mr.
DENNIs EADIE was excellent as Sir
Jabez Grinlay, Bart., the Sweater
King; but most delightful of all were
the performances of Miss BERYL
MERCER as an Old Woman, and of
Mr. NorMAN McKINNEL as Police-
constable Fellowes. Their quiet un-
assertive humour could hardly have
been bettered. If I thought I could
fall in with such excellent company
I should be greatly tempted to try a
night out on the Embankment when
the weather gets a little milder.

MR. DE MoRGAN's idea in Somehow Good (HEINEMANN)
is not new, but his treatment of it has distinction and
charm. Mr. Fenwick, or Palliser, or Harrisson (he was
a nice man all the same), having lost his memory,
promptly finds his wife, from whom he had been separated
—with complications—for twenty years. He marries
her again, and Mrs. Fenwick hopes that those unhappy
complications will never be recalled. Any sign of re-
turning memory alarms her, but she cannot help asking
questions and playing the game called “nettle-
grasping.” Mr. DE MoRGAN has the gift of making his
characters and his readers become one large family
party. Sally, for instance,
for safety, presses and comes to grief, like many a
good man before (and behind) him. Still, I am glad
he did notºr up his card. After all, it's not such a

more; but the word “powerful '' is rather misleading. The
writing is powerful, but it has the power of the rapier
rather than that of the bludgeon, which, I think, is the
kind of force that epithet has come latterly to suggest
when applied to fiction. The tale is very slight—there
are only three characters in the greater part of it, and
one of these dies half-way through—yet so deftly is it

less you pause to consider.
A ship at sea takes fire; two
children, a boy and a girl,
leave it in a dinghy with an
old sailor; they land on a
coral island in the South
Pacific, and there live; and
the children grow up to-
gether, learning the secrets
of life as nature reveals them.
That is really all there is
of it, yet I can say that it
is a long time since I read
a book more fascinating,
more delicately conceived,
more healthily nurtured on
the fruits of an observation
which knows when not to
observe.
After an aloof career of
several years at a very high
figure, under the not too
alluring title Arabia Deserta,
Mr. CHARLEs DoughTY's
great and wonderful story of
his travels reappears in a
cheaper and more negotiable
form as Wanderings in
Arabia (Duckworth). There
had always been a body,
fit but few, of literary ex-
how Arthur Hillyar, tripping
carelessly down the hill of
the same rural retreat for falsifying his accounts
with insufficient skill. As long as I was taking George
and Arthur in alternate doses I quite enjoyed myself.
But when their lines of life at last converged, and I
learnt that they were as like as two peacocks, my heart
sank. Not so Mrs. Arthur's. She saw at once that
her husband might contrive to escape from prison, and
that George, his exact image, could be recaptured in
his stead. Personally, I would have laid her long odds
against the success of her scheme, though to her it
seemed as simple as peeling bananas. But I was wrong,
as a man always is when he pits his experience against a
woman's intuition. As a golfer I would put Mr.
MAURICE DRAKE's handicap at about fourteen. He is
one of your splendide mendaz players—brilliant when
he has a good lie. Going out with the wind behind
him, he puts up very nearly a scratch game. But
coming in he gets into difficulties, and instead of playing
life, was consigned to
plorers who knew that Mr.
T}oughTY's book was in many respects the best
book of travel ever written; that little band will
now become greatly reinforced. A word or two from
Mr. GARNETT's admirable preface may be quoted:
“The writer must confess that he knows no other book
of travel which makes him so proud that the author is
an Englishman. Gentleness, courage, humanity,
endurance, and the insight of genius—these were the
qualities that carried Doughty safely through his
strange achievement of adventuring alone, a professed
Christian, amid the fanatical Arabians.” Any one wish-
ing to give a boy a rather better present than usual—
and one that would lift his imagination as it should be
lifted, and fire his blood as it should be fired—ought to
make a note of DoughTy's Wanderings in Arabia.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LIFE IN SICILY.
A correspondent sends the follow-
ing impressions gathered at a play
performed by the Sicilian actors at
the Shaftesbury Theatre.
Sicily is a mountainous land (he
writes) so I went into the gallery. It
seemed to me that I should be more
in the atmosphere of the play. We
were a happy party up there—
waiters, ice - cream dealers, and
asphalte-mixers—but the atmosphere
was disappointing. It may have
been Sicilian, yet it was most un-
satisfactory.
If Sicilians really are what the
actors represent them to be, a pretty
problem offers itself. Do the Sicilian
actors carry on like that because the
Sicilians do it, or do the Sicilians do
it because they have seen their actors
do it? Somebody must be respon-
sible.
Anyway, Sicily must be a terrible
place to live in; indeed, few people
really live there. Sicilians as a rule
spend their time either in barely
escaping death or in dying slowly
and in great pain. Where in England
the man in the street asks his friend
to come and have a drink, in Sicily
he whips out a knife from behind,
and tries to kill him.
It is to this constant danger that
the free gesticulation of the people is
due. So long as one keeps one's
hands and arms flying around with
great rapidity, the other man has
little chance of planting a fair blow.
Of course this is fatiguing, hence the
national custom of the siesta (or the
Sicilian equivalent), during which
time of rest no honourable person
would kill his friend.
In Sicily marriage is the admission
to one's life, on equal terms, of one
who is to all intents and purposes a
panther. It is also a race between a
man and a woman as to who shall be
first in despatching the other. There
is no advantage, however, in remain-
ing unmarried. The unmarried
person becomes at once a tertium
quid, and by the etiquette of the land
is removed first.
It is safe to assume that the
coroners in Sicily possess a very
strong trade union, otherwise they
would be worked to death, and to
death in a shape which is looked
down upon in a land where other
styles of decease are so plentiful.
Living must be very expensive in
Sicily. As soon as a Sicilian gets
into a rage he cannot be appeased
until he has smashed glass, crockery,
and furniture, preferably all three.
This happy country should be a fine

NAVAL AND OTHER ESTIMATES.
Dove, with the signs of moult on each poor feather,
And the limp olive drooping from your beak,
Bear up, good fowl, and pull yourself together,
And cease that attitude of solemn pique;
You have been hustled at the Hague, my pet,
But there 's a lot of fun before you yet.
Europe may hear your views without emotion,
And keep on building bruisers night and day,
But here are those who think the realm of Ocean
Not worth the ponderous premium we pay;
Let other sea-dogs bark upon the blue,
For pups like us a little growl should do.
See where around your ruffled plumes they rally,
Wreathed in the very best Elysian smiles,
Taking, as well becomes this white-winged ballet,
Their time from BRUNNER and their tune from BYLEs ;
(PERKs, having lent the Cause his sounding name,
Thought better of it and withdrew the same).
But there 's another task for you to handle,
Distinct from schemes connected with the brine—
Viz., to arrest a shocking, shocking scandal
That under darkness works its fell design,
Gnawing away at England's very vitals—
I am referring to the trade in titles.
I understand that anyone who proffers
The regulation prices on the mart,
Planking his bullion in the Caucus coffers,
At once becomes a Baron or a Bart.
That 's how we get our ready money for
The “bloated armaments " of Party War.
“War,” you observe, a war of Whig and Tory—
“A sort of war,’’ not where a man's red blood
Is freely spilled for King and home and glory,
But fought with rotten eggs and lies and mud;
And yet the kind of thing, I beg to ween,
In which a bird like you should intervene.
Ay, here 's a mission Peace should take upon her—
To check the Party lust we now indulge;
So might we ring with bounds the Roll of Honour
With which Debrett and Burke already bulge,
And spare the self-made victims doomed (one hears)
To swell the coming holocaust of Peers.

This might have been put better. Even now we are
not certain whether it is the cage or the tit-bit which
is so easily amused.

After all, what are looks compared with beauty of soul?
A “COMPETITION" CONCERT.
It was in the autumn of 1892; I was staying in a
little Oxfordshire village, and, walking into Henley one
day, I happened to see handbills in the shop-windows
announcing : —
“HERR ScHMAkoffski's GRAND CoMPETITION CoNCERT |
At the Town Hall, Henley-on-Thames,
On Wednesday, September 28, at 8 p.m.
Vocal (Comic and Sentimental Songs) and Instru-
mental Music, for which Musical Instruments and other
Useful Prizes will be given, the Winner of each competi-
tion to be decided by the Audience.
Herr SchMAkoffski (who has played before) will also
give his Entertainment, a Highly Elevating and Instruc-
tive Lecture, with songs in French, German, Swiss, and
English. Views of London, Oxford, Bath, Ireland and
America, the Holy Land (Old and Ncu. Testament),
Rome, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Arctic
Regions. With Comic Views and Portraits of Illustrious
Persons.”
I rather needed elevating just then, and there was
something about the wording of this announcement that
seemed promising. The name of Herr SchMAkoffski
(slightly altered here) was not altogether unknown
to me: that is, I had heard of him as the proprietor
of a musical instrument shop in Oxford, and of a
string band in great request at undergraduate “wines ''
in the late seventies. I decided that this lecture was an
opportunity that it might be unwise to miss, and so, on
the appointed evening, I made one of a fairly large audi-
ence in a long upper room rawly lit by a big gas star,
and decorated by two full-length portraits of CHARLEs
THE SEco ND and his Queen.
On the platform at the further end, a table on which
stood a battered old tin magic-lantern ; near it lay a
guitar; at the back, a frame with a dingy and disre-
putably wrinkled sheet. In the front seats a few
notables; behind them, the local shopkeepers, neigh-
bouring farmers, and their families. There was nobody
on the platform, and we spent some minutes in
speculating where the piano would be placed—a sheer
waste of time, because, as we were soon to discover,
there was not going to be a piano. At last Herr
SchMAKOFFSKI appeared, midst feeble applause, with
his arms full of slides. An amiable elderly gentleman,
with white hair and beard, and a strong foreign accent—
nationality, I imagine, Polish. - -
“Laties and schendlemen,” he began, “dere are only
two schendlemen to gombete, and dey gannot be hier dill
ade-thirdy. Zo, vit your kind bermissions I will gif my
enderdainment virst, instet of at a gonglusion, and I
bromise to schdrain all my effords to enderdain you.”
There was an engaging artlessness about this that
would have propitiated the surliest. We applauded
vigorously; the gas star waned to pale blue, a dim circle
dawned on the screen, and we prepared to be enter-
tained. “Wirst,” we heard Herr SchMAkoffski's
voice announce in the darkness, “I shall show you som
sceneries of Englandt and oder blaces—de Pay of
Nables, wit Vesuvius in de pack.” There was a little
trouble about the focus, and Vesuvius could not be in-
duced to emerge. But this was amply atoned for by a
procession of partly obliterated feluccas, which sailed
jerkily through the sky, upside down, and were up-
roariously welcomed, for we had already discovered that
the lecture would not prove unentertaining. Encouraged
by this Herr S. next exhibited “A few sceneries from

A “scenery of Baris '' followed, with a digression on
the Parisian café. “I will dell you an anegdote of an

It was a blameless ditty, and began: “An English-

cept that Herr SchMAkoffski, in the character of the
Swiss girl, played the guitar and yodelled at the end of
every stanza, it was perhaps a little deficient in point.
However, it was warmly applauded. “Hier,” continued
the lecturer, “is de Leaning Dower of Bisa. Eferyvon
who goes to it always puys a vodo of de dower. I haf
peen in many schendlemen's houses, and eferyvere I see

spectability we could hardly do less than express our
approval of the Leaning Tower. “Nexdt, a sqadue of
Sain Betre in Rome. Hier my liddle curl will zing you
‘Zanta Lucia.’” Which Fräulein SchMAKOFFSKI sud-
denly came out and did. After that, I think the slides
must have got a little mixed. I know a view of the Staub-
bach was introduced as “a scenery from Ems, a Sher-
man watering-blace,” while a Venetian canal appeared
unabashed as “a schtreed in Nables.” But we were
perfectly happy—some of us almost hysterically so—till
we got to the Scriptural scenes, which seemed to cast a
gloom. Even Herr SCHMAKOFFSKI noticed that they
were not going as well as might be wished, for, after
announcing “ABRAHAM and SARAH, mit deir pabe, de
liddle Is AAG,” he added consolingly, “Bresently I shall
show you somtings more laughable—Meester and Meesis
Pluebeard ' " Somehow the comic slipping slides, with a
man and a puppy exchanging heads, and other equally
humorous effects, failed to provoke the mirth their
exhibitor evidently anticipated, and his own faith in
them appeared to be shaken at length. But, at the
close, when he thanked us for “so craciously and
batiently listening to a boor olt man, and I wish my

enderdainment was a pedder von,” there was a pathos in
the appeal which I think touched all of us, and I like to
remember that in the response we made there was
nothing at all ironical.
Then came the “Competition Concert.” Two young
gentlemen (who I fancy were in the employment of the
leading linendrapers) mounted the platform. The first
was tall, pale, and exceeding shy. It was some time
before he could convey to Herr SchMAKOFFSKI (who was
to accompany him on the guitar) any clear notion of the
key he proposed to sing in—he did not seem very cer-
tain about it himself. At length he gave us a senti-
mental song: “My Darling 's with me in my Dreams' "
a piece of information which (possibly because we did
not know the lady) left us cold. His rival was short, of
mild aspect, with side whiskers, so, as was only to be ex-
pected, he obliged as “The Storm Fiend.” His rendering
was hilariously received, particularly when he chuckled
and laughed “Aha!” It would have been unnecessary,
as we felt, to hoist the weather-cone for so futile a fiend.
“Now,” inquired Herr SchMAKOFFski, as soon as we
became more composed, “vich is de Winner?” Some
unknown benefactor in the front row suggested faintly
that we should like, before deciding, to hear from the
Fiend once more. So the Fiend sang us “The Friar of
Orders Grey,” and “ho-oh-oh-oh-d'’ to such unfathom-
able depths that the rest of the refrain was drowned in
roars of laughter, in which the Holy Friar unaffectedly
joined. He was unanimously awarded the prize, pre-
sented by Herr S. with a neat speech: “Holy vriar,
egscuse me galling you so, but I remember it pedder.
Hier is de brize, a sblendid biccolo vit sigsdeen keys' "
After which we broke up, and I did not consider a
six-mile trudge back in the dark at all too heavy a price
for such an evening. Indeed, I would willingly perform
the same pilgrimage again if I could hope to be so
ingenuously entertained. But I fear the light of poor
old Herr SchMAKof FSKI's lantern has long since flickered
out. F. A.
THE LOST HEIR.
SyNopsis.
[The Earl of BRASENose, having been lost at the age of eight months
by his absent-minded mother, the Duchess of BATTLEbowN, is secured by
Mr. Willi AM OATEs, the ducal coachman, and is by him handed over to
the care of the coachman's mother, Mrs. OATEs, the proprietress of an
animal shop in the Seven Dials. There he is reared in ignorance of his
origin up to the age of twelve years. The Duchess, feeling that, by
some means which she hardly realises, an aching void has been caused
in her life, attempts to fill it by taking charge of various animals whom
she keeps as pets in the family mansion in Belgrave Square. She finally
decides that she must have a boy as special attendant for her menagerie,
and, at the suggestion of WILLIAM 3. (now repentant), engages her
own twelve-year-old son to fill the post under the name of Thomas
OATEs, supposing him to be her coachman's distant relative.]
HAviNG now brought the Earl and his mother together,
I have all but arrived at the end of my tether.
It remains to be shown
How he came by his own;
How, in spite of all checks and all chance of denials,
He not only emerged from the grip of the Dials,
But was owned in the end, by a fortunate fluke,
As the Earl that he was and the son of a Duke.
When the Duchess beheld him she shivered and said,
“What a nice little boy,” and she patted his head.
Then she shivered again,
Like a creature in pain,
And, poohpoohing suggestions of bronchial catarrh,
Which the new boy put forward, remarked, “If you are
What I feel that you must be you 're certainly dented
By the knob of a grate, which you fell on and bent it.
It was twelve years ago, but there 's somehow a some-
thing,
A vague thing, a notion, a queer thing, a dumb thing,
A thought which is hinting that somewhere or other
I have met you before—that, in fact, I'm your mother.’’
Then, in spite of his struggles, her eyes growing tender,
She applied the boy's head to the knob of the fender:
Oh, her heart went pit-pat, and her cheeks became
aler,
But sº held the lad fast, and the knob didn't fail her.
Her bad luck at last was completely outwitted,
For the boy had a dent in his head—and it fitted
Some day I may tell you—I hope to—the story
How the Earl went at Eton from glory to glory;
How, whatever he did, he was always on top :
How he rowed in the Eight, was elected to “Pop,”
Was the pride of his tutor, the joy of his House,
And was sent up for good, and was famed for his vočs.
But the lingo he learnt in the Dials, when young,
Came trippingly still from the tip of his tongue.
It infected the boys; in the course of some weeks
It had seized on the dames and had conquered the
‘‘ beaks.''
The Head was its victim :
It went for and picked him,
And thence, spreading fast from the up to the down,
It absorbed every suburb and swallowed the town;
Till at last all frequenters of decent society,
In its ranks and its fashions in all their variety,
When they held conversation were sure to employ
Instead of “ow,” “i,” the expressions “eow,” “oi"
All this I may tell you (it's not very pleasant)
On a future occasion. I've done for the present.
THE END.
We cull from The Daily Telegraph of February 20:-
“A Willesden girl who applied for the position of scullery-maid in a
well-known county asylum received a form containing some forty
questions, including the following:
“Do you sing 2
“Of what compass is your voice 2
“Do you play any musical instruments? If so, state what instrument.
‘Would you be willing to entertain the patients?'
There was no question relative to the girl's capabilities as a
scullery-maid.” -
We have cabled the above catechism to Mme. TETRAz-
ZINI. If her voice has a kitchen range, if her musical
references are satisfactory and she has a good character
from her last “place,” no doubt her prospective em-
ployers will overlook any dish-washing deficiencies.
Another Mystery.
“Witness added that among Morell's partners in crime were many
who were either in gaol awaiting trial, or at liberty.”—Daily Telegraph.
But where on earth were the rest of them 2
Many critics have complained lately of the way in
which theatre managers continually accept plays from
the French, instead of encouraging British authors. The
latest example of this unpreferential treatment is
recorded as follows in The Daily Mail:—
“NEW ROYALTY. ROMEO & JULIET.
Adapted from the French of Henry Bern.”
We could mention at least one English playwright
who could have treated the subject equally well.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
A BY-ELECTION.
- Millchester.
DEAREST DAPHNE, - The latest
from your BLANCHE is that a by-
election is simply screaming fun, and
that we've all been having the time !
of our lives here. When North-East
Millchester fell vacant we all per-
suaded Norty that he ought not to
hide his talents any longer in a
bushel of something, especially as
the MIDDLESHIREs have a place close
by, and the VAvAssoR interest is
strong there. Like a good boy, he
said if we all wished it he didn't
mind having a touch at Parliament,
so down we all came to see the thing
through. It 's been a three-cornered
contest. In addition to the man on
the Wrong Side, a Socialist stood,
and OUTA TELBows, the Hungarian
Socialist Count, has been here
making some of his ridiculous
flaming speeches. I see now how
fallacious Socialism is. I can't
imagine how I could ever think OUTA
TELBows good-looking. The creature
has grown a beard, and is positively
frightful | He ought to be exported
as an Undesirable.
I'm not in the least ashamed of
my change of opinions. Norty says
I needn't be. He says opinions are
like other things—you want to try a
lot before you find a set to suit you.
The Wrong Side (I don't notice
the Socialist gang, we don't expect
anything decent from them) have
behaved in a most odious way. Their
posters, my dear, and the leaflets
they 've put about !
KIDDY and his Yankee wife came
to help, and LALA MIDDLESHIRE; and
AUNT GoLDIE arrived in a very
juvenile get-up to captivate voters;
but she caught sight of one of the
Wrong Side's great posters—a fear-
ful caricature of herself and Norty,
and the words, “A, man may not
marry his grandmother, however
much money she has ' ' ' and the
poor old dear fled back to Devon-
shire. NoFTY says only rotters
would hit below the belt like that.
But of course we didn't take it lying
down. NoFTY's agent got out some
screaming posters about them, en
revanche, and leaflets with lots of
little things he 'd found out. .
Millchester, as you know, is full of
great factories and of workpeople.
I don't exactly know what it is they
make, but the poor things get up
awfully early to make it, and work
very hard. I went about in my
big white Darracq that I call Carte
Blanche, dressed in white cloth, with
white furs, and made friends with

them, and told them what wonderful
things Norty would do for them.
Poor boy he 's pledged himself to
such a programme ! But, as he says,
programmes are only made to be
altered. And the Wrong Side have
certainly gone one better in their
programme. They've promised pen-
sions to all who don't care about
work; votes for women, and the
best and least draughty seats in the
House to be reserved for the female
Members; the Speaker to be a
woman, and to be allowed to speak.
I went about among the people
and got them all on my side. The
dear, grimy things simply wor-
shipped me. We gave a Cake-and-
Jam Tea to a lot of the kiddies, and
those wretches on the Wrong Side at
once put out leaflets with “How a
Buy-Election is Managed. Voters
of North-east Millchester beware of
Mr. NoFTon VAvAssoR (first cousin
of that bloated aristocrat the Duke
of MIDDLESHIRE, the biggest ground-
landlord in Millchester), and beware
of his Fair Friends ! Speak out your
honest opinions, Electors of North-
east Millchester, and don't allow
your mouths to be stopped with Jam
—with Raspberry Jam, with Straw-
berry Jam, with Bribery Jam | "
What d'you think of that, my
dearest ? .
Never mind. We 've frustrated
their politics, confounded their
knavish tricks, and got our man in.
After the poll was declared we gave
a great kick-up to all and sundry.
Josiah suddenly appeared on the
scene, and seemed a bit sumphish.
He congratulated Norty formally,
and then asked him if he had
“ thought seriously of any of the
problems of the day—of the Unem-
ployed, for instance?”
“Oh yes,” said Norty. “Natur-
ally I’ve thought about them, for
I'm one of them.”
We 've great hopes of our new
Member. He 'll begin in just a small
way, asking questions about things,
you know—the size of policemen's
boots, say, or something of that kind.
Then he 'll go on to introduce little
private Bills, and will speak when-
ever he can get or make an oppor-
tunity. And if he 's very cheeky
and unmanageable, and advertises
himself enough, he may get into the
Cabinet when his own side is in, or
even before that if he cares to do a
quick-change turn.
His views on the everlasting Irish
Question he takes from me. Yes,
my dear, my latest Cause is the
Irish. I've put in a fortnight in
Ireland lately, and what time I could
spare during a week's parties in
Dublin and a week's hunting in
Galway, I gave up to mastering the
Irish Question. And now I speak
with authority of the Irish. They 're
clever, DaPHNE, but they 're queer,
and what they want is not ruling but
managing. You can do anything
with them if you go to work the
right way. I'd some lovely talks
with the Galway peasants. I told
them how silly they were to want
Home Rule, and to hate their land-
lords, and to drive cattle away from
laces. A funny old chap, sucking
a little black pipe, said, “Sure, dar-
lint, 'tis yourself knows all about
us. If there was more like ye, Ire-
land's throubles would soon be
over.” (There can be no doubt that
with all their queerness they do
understand and appreciate one !) I
promised I'd send him some tobacco
to smoke in his little gossoon—(it's
always a good plan to use their own
words, if you know any)—and he
said, “May the Heavens be your
bed, darlint; but 'tis a dhudeen I'm
smoking—a gossoon is a little bhoy.”
I'm working simply most awfully
hard for Ireland just now. I've
bought a ghastly heap of poplin (a
loathsome material, my own, and I
shall never have it made up), and a
frantic lot of Limerick lace (which is
rather nice, though its name is
enough to give one the shudders
now), and let me see—oh, yes,
about a ton of horrors in bog-oak.
(Entre mous, I consider there 's no
greater proof of the unbalanced state
of the Irish mind than those fearful
things they make out of bog-oak')
So you see how strenuously I'm
working for my new Cause !
Ever thine, BLANCHE.

WHO WORKS THE HARDEST?
HERCULEAN LABOURERs on THEIR
TASKs.
WITH a view to ascertaining the
amount of work done by various
public men and women of distinc-
tion, in order that some idea may be
gained as to how many hours should
be given to toil, a representative of
the Halfpenny Central Press Associa-
tion has been making inquiries in
those places where such inquiries are
always made. Information has
naturally been “elicited,’’ an assort-
ment of which is now laid before the
expectant reader, who is, however,
not asked to carry it in his mind for
more than an hour or so, for these
articles don't really matter, and to-
morrow there will be something fresh
for him.
Mr. Asquith, discovered behind a
zareba of despatch boxes, correspon-
dence, and private secretaries, with a
deputation waiting for him in every
room and two in the hall, and a sus-
picious-looking female on the door-
step, found time to answer rapidly a
few carefully chosen questions.
“Are you in agreement with Mr.
RAMsAY MAcDoNALD, M.P., when he
says, as he has recently done at
Coventry, or perhaps Leicester, that
men and women are dying to-day be-
cause they do not have enough leisure
to enable them to replace the mental
and physical wear and tear of life?”
“Yes, I mean no.''
“Do you view with favour, or at
any rate without venom, the project
of Mr. WILLETT, as brought forward
in a private Bill the other day by a

Mr. BERNARD SHAw was char-
acteristically witty. It was absurd,
he said, to talk of work and play as
distinct things at all. To him all
work was play and all play was work;
but that was, of course, because he
was so incorrigibly and gloriously
unique. He had never been tired in
his life, and never meant to be. The
current ideas as to the necessity of
rest were ridiculous. A man who
needed rest was not worth consider-
ing, while, on the other hand, a man
who did not lie in bed all day if he
wanted to was a slave. And so on.
Mr. John LANE said he never slept
for more than three hours. He

search for new geniuses, of which, by
the way, he had several, from whose
works he would like to read a few
passages. The first was
Mr. GEORGE R. SIMs said that the
greatest fallacy of modern times was
the doctrine of rest. No one needed
rest. There was only one way to
keep oneself fresh, and that was to
have a curious mind. Be interested
in things. He personally had not slept
for years, and such was his interest
in things that he never felt tired.
He wrote sixteen hours a day, and
explored life and London for the rest.
His aim was to make two blades of
mustard and cress grow where only
one had grown before, and he meant
to go on doing it, even if he had to
call in the aid of Thatcho. He would
never have discovered the priceless
secret of Thatcho if he had obeyed
the ordinary rules as to rest, for it
came to him at four in the morning,
when everyone else in the world was
asleep and idle.
After knocking for some hours at
Mr. HALDANE's door without obtain-
ing any reply our representative
left. e has since discovered
that the footman thought he was the
Suffragettes, and behaved according.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER said that
only actors really knew what work
meant. He had often watched
navvies in the street, and had
longed to be one, except for their
baggy trouser-knees. The actor's life
was one unceasing round of drudgery.
If he was not rehearsing he was at
the tailor's; if he was not at the
tailor's he was at the photographer's;
and if he was not at the photo-
grapher's he was at the County
Council. And then came the per-
formance, and during the entr'actes,
when he was supposed to be resting,
the trying ordeal, often very dis-
heartening, of counting the dead-
heads through the little hole in the
curtain. Add to this the visits from
would-be dramatists and would-be
leading ladies, and where were you?
Better sweep a crossing.
Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON said that in
his opinion the hours of work in an
ideal state would be limited to two a
day; but in the imperfect civilisation
which we endure it is impossible for
a brain-worker to keep body and soul
together on so little. He himself
had to write for at least two hours
and a-half every day if he were to
enjoy the balance in reposeful dialec-
tics with his friends and foes.
Inquiries at the House of
Commons elicited the fact that Mr.
BELLoc is the most hardworked of
all our younger Parliamentarians.
The week-end brings him no respite
from his labours, as he invariably
spends it in the grimy heart of Sal-
ford amongst his constituents, where
he conducts classes in military his-
tory, conversational French, mediae-
val theology, and thorough Bass. As
Mr. BELLoc has expressed it in a
touching couplet:
“French is my heart, but loyal and sincere
Is, and shall be, my love of British beer."
In the wrestling world the pressure
is equally great. HACKENscHMIDT
works twelve hours a day at master-
ing the languages of his various rivals
—Galician, Turkish, Slovak, and
Albanian.
At Windsor it was ascertained
from Mr. GRAY, the leader of the
“Manchester Marchers,’’ that no
class worked harder than the unem-
ployed. At least eight hours of his
day were occupied in interviewing, or
the composition of manifestoes. Eight
hours more were devoted to his
duties as open-air lecturer to Eton
College. He had given up eating
simply because he had no time for
meals. -

A WEAK POINT.
THEoDoRE is a dear, I admit—
And it 's one of the sweetest of names–
He 's ready with sympathy, wisdom and wit,
And he 's perfectly splendid at games.
And I can't fail to see he has taken to me,
For his feelings he openly shows;
But he's got one defect which he cannot correct: –
I don't like the shape of his nose.
His hair is an auburny hue,
And, when it grows long enough, curls;
His eyes are so dreamy and wistful and true—
At least when he 's talking to girls.
When he dives in the scrum he makes everything hum
And mincemeat of most of his foes;
He knows how to dress, and his work's a success,
But—I don't like the shape of his nose.
Yet I haven't the heart to refuse
If he ever suggests we should meet,
Up that strip of red baize between whispering pews—
The prospect, in fact, is quite sweet.
But it may be, oh dear, when I'm shaking with fear
From my veil to my white satin toes
And the church is quite still, I shall answer “I will;
But I don't like the shape of his nose!”
LITERARY NotE.-Considerable feeling has been aroused
in poetical circles by the very pointed way in which
Miss LENA Ashwell's new play, Diana of Dobson's, has
been entitled. In order to redress the balance, Gertie
of Gosse's, Lily of Lang's, Bessie of Binyon's, Nina of
Noyes's, and Tottie of Trench's are shortly to be pro-
duced at rival theatres. There was talk also of Winnic
of Watts-Dunton's; but it has been decided that a
simpler title would be better, and it may, therefore, be
expected as Sally of Swinburne's or Polly of the Pines.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RUSSIA Vigilant.
(Count B-nck-nd-rff.)
House of Commons, Monday, Feb-
ruary 17.-Russian Ambassador hur-
ried down this afternoon bright and
early. Occasion momentous. British
Government have accomplished pur-
pose vainly pursued by predecessors
during the last forty years. Have
signed and sealed Convention with
#. which PRINCE ARTHUR, called
upon to curse it, to-night admitted
“carries with it substantial advan-
tages, which may, and I hope will,
carry in addition some augmentation
of that friendly feeling which is the
great security for peace and good-
Will.’’
That's all right. Echoes the even
more emphatic approval expressed by
LANsdowne the other night, rising to
high traditions of British statesman-
ship which guard foreign policy from
the venom of Party spite. A new
turn given to affairs in the Commons.
That eminent statesman, Earl PERCY,
regarding situation gravely shook his
head.
“This will never do,”
mured.
Accordingly drafted and placed on
paper Resolution involving censure of
a settlement which, “while involving
material sacrifice of British interests,
leaves room for international misun-
derstanding.”
With this portent in the hurtled
air. Russian Ambassador did well to
hurry over his luncheon and hasten
to secure place in Diplomatic Gallery.
His Excellency expected to find

House crowded in every part, seeth-
ing with excitement. He looked
down upon it half empty, wholly list-
less, regarding with quizzical look the
middle-aged young gentleman at the
Table engaged in demonstrating that
all was lost; that Persia, a rich ripe
pear, was ready to fall into the open
mouth of the TsAR, at whose feet
India lay prostrate.
Old Members regarding Earl
PERCY, recalled another of his name
familiar in the House twenty-five
years ago. On the whole, the Earl
PERCY of to-day has more grit than
his esteemed parent who sat below
the Gangway in the Parliament of
1880-5, and looked after the Uni-
verse. Called to the House of Lords,
the Earl PERCY known to Commons
of past generation to-day invests de-
iivery of his nothingnesses with ducal
pomposity that for a while—say seven
or eight minutes—is amusing. But
as AMURATH to AMURATH succeeds, so
we had back again to-night the very
marrow of the Earl PERCY of the
Eighties, glib, confident, capable of
wrestling with the Himalayas or
taking the Persian Gulf in a flying
leap.
The speech and the motion all very
well for an irresponsible Member,
albeit he spoke from Opposition
Bench with the authority of an ex-
Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.

three tailors of the electoral Tooley
Street, peremptorily calling him back.
Attitude assumed by LANsdown E to-
wards Convention in other House
was obviously result of concert in
Opposition councils. Had PRINCE
ARTHUR been disposed to take another
view, which he evidently was not,
expression of it was impossible.
Still there was the Resolution for.
mally moved. He must have been
consulted as to its terms; he asso-
ciated himself with it to the extent of
asking for a day for debate. It was a
tight place, but not the first PRINCE
ARTHUR has been in, and he got out
of it with accustomed dexterity.
“I do not believe,” said JoHN
MoRLEY, “that anything would ter.
rify the right hon. gentleman more
than the carrying of Earl PERCY's
Resolution.”
Here was his opening, and he
quickly jumped through it. The
Resolution was, he pleaded, a mere
question of procedure. If a harmless
motion for papers , would equally
serve the purpose, he would forth-
with substitute it.
“I have not,” he said, “the least
desire to press the motion. I do not
desire to divide the House.”
So the Resolution was withdrawn,
and the Russian Ambassador went
home more than ever puzzled with
Parliamentary ways at Westminster.
Business done.—Earl PERCY, adapt-
ing a famous example, wrote on the

Tuesday.—Through the dull atmo-
sphere that filled House to-night there
suddenly flashed a bolt, striking
Treasury Bench in the place where
C.-B. might have been sitting.
Scotch Small Holdings Bill principal
business. This is one of the twin
measures presently to be launched
against the Lords. As leading up to
political crisis, its progress might
have been expected to be accom-
panied by scenes of excitement. On
the contrary, had we been decent
folk attending a funeral we couldn't
have been more dolorous.
To this end, SINCLAIR, in charge of
Bill, contributed speech an hour
long by Westminster clock. This
triumphantly, possibly finally, dis-
poses of old gibe about Scotsmen
having no humour. As he remarked,
't was the third time he had intro-
duced the Bill. C.-B., properly pro-
testing against waste of time follow-
ing on vain repetition of stale argu-
ments, allotted a single sitting to
second reading stage. With private
Members taking their turn at a
quarter-past eight, this meant four
hours for the whole business. The
Secretary of State for Scotland ap-
propriated one, being a quarter of the
heritage of 670 Members!
LAMBTON moved amendment, nega-
tived by majority of 247. House next
divided on question “that this Bill
be now read a second time,” and
WHITELEY announced that 247 voted
for the Bill, 103 against, majority
144. Here was catastrophe. On
the face of it, it was clear that 100
supporters of the Government had
deserted the colours. They had
voted against the amendment, but
when it came to supporting the Bill
they revolted. It was not a defeat;
but it was a defection that must
prove fatal to Ministry.
Whilst the Opposition chortled
and faithful Ministerialists marvelled,
Whips made discovery of little error.
They had miscounted by trifle of a
round 100. It was 347 who voted for
the second reading. Thus Ministerial
majority was restored to normal
figure, and all was well. But it was
a bad quarter of an hour.
Business done. — Scottish Small
Holdings Bill read a second time.
Friday.—THOMAS BURT looked in
to-day, making one of his rare ap-
pearances on a crowded scene where,
as a rule, there is no seat for him.
As an ex-Minister, a Privy Councillor,
he might, as is the wont of others in
similar circumstances, claim a corner
seat, whether above or below the
the corner-seat disposition in BURT.
In all circumstances he instinctively
makes for the lowest place at the
table, and if any bids him come up
higher, he blushes and takes earliest
opportunity of making for the door.
In the bypaths of House of
Commons life, nothing to be found
more pleasing, more honourable to
both sides, than its attitude towards
BURT. As everyone knows—the story
is just retold by AARON WATson in
the life of “A Great Labour Leader,’’
a book whose literary qualities make
it worthy of its theme—the ex-Par-
liamentary Secretary of the Board of
Trade began life as a pit boy. Start-
ing in his tenth year, he worked
mainly underground till, when he
reached the age of twenty-seven, he
started on a public career, which

other man contributed to the eman-
cipation of the miner from the
slavery of sixty years ago.
There is no Member to whom the
most critical assembly in the world
listens with greater pleasure, keener
interest. He speaks too seldom, but
when word goes round that BURT is
up the benches fill with magical
rapidity. Members listen as intently
to the deep Northumbrian burr of the
speaker as if he were the Prime
Minister.
There are officially known two
Labour Parties in the House. One
is the majority who sit on the Minis-
terial side, and in the main work cor-
dially with C.-B. The other, lately
delivered from the fantastic leader-
ship of DoN'T KEIR HARDIE, follow
the custom of irreconcilable Irish
Nationalists, and whilst Ministers
come and Ministers go sit in Opposi-
tion for ever. SARK says there are
three Labour Parties, the one so-
named, the Independents, and
THOMAS BURT.
The last a rare, perhaps unique,
exemplar. C.-B. did a graceful thing
when he made the former pit boy a
Privy Councillor. But THOMAs BURT
was right honourable even when he
drove his pony in the depths of Has-
well Colliery, and has remained so
through the varied stages of a long

SPADE WORK.
THE news that the candidate for
North Kensington has written a
Tariff Reform play, which is to be
acted in his constituency, will be
welcomed by all patriotic English-
men. At the same time it is a ques-
tion whether he has done his work in
the best manner possible. The in-
tention of his play is to educate the
public. Now, according to the short
account given in the press, his work
has taken an allegorical form; and it
is here that I think he is wrong.

JEssie explains -that GEORGE has

brings him in and leaves them to-
gether. GEORGE gives some account
of his birth, prospects and position.
Cand. Yes, that all seems satisfac-
tory. But there is one other point.
Are you a Tariff Reformer?

Cand. Have you never studied the
question?
George. No. Never seem to get
the time, somehow.
Cand. Then of course
to dabble in, and with t
not too intelligent voter
particularly so. My idea
would be something more
direct. I should let the
candidate himself appear
upon the stage in his own
person, and I should make
him express trenchantly
but naturally in the course
of dialogue the higher
truths of the great Cause.
I give here an example,
necessarily brief, of what I
mean ; it could, of course,
be expanded at will. For
myself, if I were a Tariff
Reform candidate, I should
be inclined to add to it a

Jessie. It 's not my fault, dear.
That's how our great battle-song

differently, that 's all. It 's “I

Fiscal Reform.” It goes just as
well. (Sings.) You see?
you're one. (Warming to
it.) It's like this. All
the great industries of this
country are dying. Now
if we have Protection—er,
that is Fiscal Reform—by
which I mean a small tax
on imports, we keep out
the foreigner; so that all
the goods which the Ger-
mans have been selling to
us will be made by Eng-
lishmen in England. That
means no more unem-
ployed.
George (pleased). Quite
SO.
Cand. Furthermore, this
small tax, when levied
upon the immense quan-
tity of German goods
which are now pouring into
the country, will yield an

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
BARBARINA, Lady GREY, made a collection of letters
found in the family archives with intent some day to
publish a selection. The purpose was unfulfilled.
Happily the task has been undertaken by her niece,
GERTRUDE LysTER, and the world is richer by a charm-
ing book. The principal contributors to A Family
Chronicle (John MURRAY) are Lady DACRE, whose life
graced the first half of the nineteenth century, and her
daughter, Mrs. SULLIVAN. They not only wrote excel-
lent letters themselves, but were the cause of delightful
letter-writing in others. Among their correspondents
were SHERIDAN, Miss MITFoRD, JoANNA BAILLIE, FANNY fi
KEMBLE, Sir E. BULWER-LYTToN, Lord DUFFERIN, Mrs.
Norton, SYDNEY SMITH, and his brother “BoBUs.” In
the DACRE family circle it was held that the elder and
less renowned brother was superior to SYDNEY. Cer-
tainly his letters by their literary charm sustain the
bold assertion. Best of all in a brilliant circle is Mrs.
SULLIVAN. Much has been written about QUEEN VIC-
There are pink roses on the cover of The Individualist
(GRANT RICHARDs), but inside there is the canker-worm.
Stretton Wingfield falls in love with a village school-
mistress, who takes an emancipated view of the mar-
riage ceremony, partly, I think, on aesthetic grounds and
partly because she does not wish to spoil the hero's pros-
pects. He deserts her, and, though she joins him again,
proves a second time inconstant. I cannot see why
they did not go to a registrar in the first instance, but I
suppose that is not my business. There are some very
interesting politics in Mr. GIBBS's book: the Liberals
have been sponged off the slate, and there are only
“Constitutionalists '' and Socialists left, with a little
band of Individual Democrats (of whom Stretton Wing-
eld is one) sandwiched in like the dormouse. But
Wingfield goes back upon his party when he finds that
he cannot lead it, and proves, I suppose, that an Indi-
vidualist will be selfish all through. I cannot help
thinking that a lady as clever as Miss Frensham would
have seen through him earlier; as it is, both his political
and personal defections come as surprises to her. She
does not seem to have read the papers, which is of
course quite inexcusable. However,
Tori.A’s Coronation; but I do not
remember anything that excels
the vivacious, graphic description of
the scene written by Mrs. SULLIVAN
to her boy at Eton. It is interesting ||
to read, under date 1793, how it was ||
a recognised habit of the ladies to
steer clear of the gentlemen when
they came out from their long sitting
after early dinner on summer even-
ings. Lady DACRE, a girl in her
teens, shrewdly surmised that there
was “some extraordinary satisfaction
in getting drunk.” Resenting the
attempt of selfish man to retain
monopoly of the pleasure, she carried
a big black jack full of strong ale to
an out-of-the-way part of the garden, |g|
where, seated under a bush on a
warm summer afternoon, she pro-
ceeded to drink it. She found it dis-
agreeable work, but persevered till
she fell asleep, in which state she
was discovered by her sisters.
The level of craftsmanship displayed
In the Baroness ORczy's Beau Brocade
(GREENING) misses the mark that each
Of her former tales have contrived to reach.
There isn't the dash that one looks to see,
One misses the spontaneity,
And the characters drawn and the things they do
Are neither remarkably strong nor new.
The Beau, of course, is a highwayman,
Polished, courteous, spick and span,
In fact, a knight-of-the-road de lure—
As highwaymen mostly are in books.
You know, I imagine, the sort of thing:—
Sir Humphrey, the villain, is having his fling,
When sharp to the tick, with a knock-down blow
And a sprightly jest, up gallops the Beau.
It is thus ad lib., in the old, old strain,
Till love 's triumphant and vice is slain;
And when I'd finished the story—well,
I sighed for The Scarlet Pimpermel,
WANTED–
A collah STUD THAT CANNOT ROLL UNDER
The CHEST OF DRAWERs.
there is a foil to Wingfield in the
shape of an enormously strong and
well-educated blacksmith, who had
loved Alicia all his life, is a genuine
Socialist, and is, I think, going to
marry her soon.
All that glitters is not gilt. An
incredulous and proverb-ridden gene-
ration notwithstanding, even the
golden locks of a third-rate actress
may be the real eighteen-carat
copper-bottomed article. . The Young
Columbine (METHUEN), for instance,
had hair the colour of sunlit corn and
|lips ruddier than a guardsman's tunic.
But did the world believe that her
gold and her scarlet were her own 2
Not a bit of it. Peroxide and Bloom ||
of Ninon, dear boy. That 's what
the world said. So poor Columbine
ran away from the cruel, cruel
profession in which she was born and bred. But
her golden hair and her tinsel past still clung to her.
Even after she had dyed the hair dark-brown the
past refused to be decently buried, and sadly interfered
with her present, until at last she found sanctuary in
an Isle of Man cottage and the arms of a modern
double of the late Mrs. Betsy Trotwood. And I wish
that the arms had been mine. For I have fallen in
love with DoRothea DEAKIN's fascinating little actress.
I am the worst of bad sailors, but neither the sickness of
the sad salt sea nor the fear of meeting the genius loci
in a brand-new tourist-suit would deter me from crossing
to Douglas by the first possible boat, there to lay myself
and the fortune which it would be Love's light labour
to make at her plucky little feet.

THE GREAT MOTOR RACE.
TERRIBLE ExPERIENCES OF CoM-
- PETITORS.
SIGNOR ANTONIO SPARAGRAsso, who
is in charge of the Tutti-Frutti car in
the New York to Paris motor race,
sends us the following appalling ac-
count of the sufferings endured by
himself and his companions during
the first stages of their journey
across the American continent.
Afflicting as were the privations of
the occupants of the Züst car (see the
account in The Daily Mail of Feb.
26th), those of the Tutti-Frutti party
were infinitely more distressing, as
will be seen from the following narra-
tive : —
Toshville (Mo.), Friday.
We reach the city of Tipperusalem
after Herculean toil and labour.
But we cannot stay. The inhabitants
rush towards us with grotesque ges-
tures, offering us Tipperusalem arti-
chokes and other local delicacies.
But we rush along at great speed
past walls of stone and even brick.
We see behind windows men who
smile and women who weep. We
flash past Ithaca, Griggsville, Pekin,
Nijni Novgorod, and Buster's Gulch,
and once more find ourselves in the
all-embracing arms of the boundless
blizzard. The trees are again in con-
vulsions, but the car goes on. The
snow grows deeper and deeper. Our
limbs are petrified, our noses are un-
conscious, our brains and our skulls
are numb. The prairie hens hover
over us with mocking cries. Gigantic
pickerels menace our progress. Our
supply of petroleum is exhausted,
and if it were not for the opportune
discovery of a dead whale on the
shores of the Great Salt Lake, which
enabled us to replenish our tanks
with spermaceti, further progress
would have been impossible. . . . In
the night we are held up by Chip-
munk Indians, but are rescued by a
timely diversion created by a stam-
pede of buffaloes. With the dawn the
snowstorm grows in intensity and
volume. Every ten minutes we have
to get out and excavate a path for the
car, but after several hours of ex-
hausting labour the wheels refuse to
go round. The car is smothered in
snow, and finally overturns in a dis-
used quarry forty feet deep. No one
is killed, but the situation is des-
perate. Our strength is exhausted,
and we wait for assistance. . . . It
comes in the shape of a herd of
Mexican mustangs, who haul our car
out of its snowy mausoleum. . . . A
crowd gathers round, and an old man
with snow-white chevelure watches
Vicar. “WELL, MARY, I was very surprised to SEE John walk out IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE SERMON YESTERDAY!”
Mary. “AH, SHR, I Do 'ope You'll Excuse My Poor 'USBAND.
wALKIN' IN 'Is sleep.”
'E's A TERRIBLE ONE Fon
us eagerly. He is an Italian, an ice-
cream seller from Cappella Bianca,
who only vaguely remembers his
mother tongue; but the sound of our
voices brings back memories of his
beloved fatherland. His heart is
deeply stirred, and he weeps as we
leave, observing in broken accents,
“Pur dicesti, una voce, di tanti
palpiti.” -
The temperature rises in the night,
and crossing a ford on the Muskwa-
bash River, we run into a herd of
musk - alligators. . . . Their shrieks
are terrible, but some well-aimed
back-firing puts them out of their
pain. Two miles further on we run
over, a sleeping bobolink, but our
brains are too numb to realise the
full purport of the mishap.
We travel on a road which has no
meaning for us. We don't know
where it starts; we don't care where
it ends. On the sea of our wearied
minds floats no desire of any kind.
Not a movement is made, not a word
is spoken. Eventually ARRIgo Boito
grasps the steering wheel. The car
moves forward. We fall asleep, all
but the indomitable ARRIGo. Sud-
denly, through a mist of dreams.... .
[The rest of the message is so
awful that we have been obliged to
suppress it.]

TO MR. REGINALD McKENNA.
(With the felicitations of a Cambridge contemporary.)
[In contrast to the recent cry—“Too old at forty"—as applied to
persons engaged in commercial enterprise, it is interesting to note that
an evening paper, assuming the traditional attitude towards members
of Parliament and the public services, describes Mr. REGINALD. McKENNA,
who is in his forty-fifth year, as “a mere boy.”]
YouNg fellow, you who find your sphere
Amid the quaintly solemn strife
Where ancients in their seventieth year -
Are deemed to touch the pink of life; ,
I marvel at your lofty station,
And how you learned sufficient lore
To run the country's education—
You, a mere chit of forty-four !
*
Some say you have a hardened mind,
Impervious to the means of grace;
You wield a sword, they say, designed
To scarify the Church's face;
To deal such knocks that none may mend her,
None readjust her riven nose;
I answer, “At an age so tender
He cannot be so bellicose 1 ''
I take, indeed, the natural view
That what concerns the children's weal
Must make, to one so young as you,
Almost a personal appeal;
Who could be found more fit to pen a
Bill that should earn our infants' thanks
Than one who, like yourself, McKENNA,
Is still aglow with Nurse's spanks?
And other thoughts would make me loth
To stamp your schemes as wholly vile;—
One Alma Mater reared us both,
We overlapped a little while;
One narrow path we used as neighbours,
Strolling with academic air
To our contemporaneous labours,
You to the Hall, and I to Clare.
'Ah! in the eighties, ere the Game
Of Life began, I love to think
“We twa hae paidled ” on the same
Turbid insanitary sink;
It warms my marrow like Spring-weather,
'Tis a new lease of careless joy;
Because, if we were up together,
I, too, must be the merest boy
Delicious thought—that Father Time
Has run a rearward course, for then
We thought that we had reached our prime
And took the sobriquet of “men '';
So murmur not “Ehcu fugaces,”
Nor grieve to miss a vanished mane,
If Life has left such gentle traces
And brought our boyhood back again. O. S.
“He is particularly good at rooksters, rather a difficult shot.”
The Australian Star.
It may not be generally known that a rocketing
wallaby is always called a “rookster” in Australia.
“Wanted, smart boy, for lathering after school hours.”
Gloucestershire Echo.
The schoolmaster's life appears to be like the
musician's. When he is not actually at work he has to
practise.
OUR CURIO COLUMN.
INTRODUCTORY.
EveRYBODY collects something nowadays—whether it
is picture-postcards, railway-tickets, or merely Hokusai
prints. It is the fashion to do so. Accordingly, Mr.
Punch has decided to follow the example of other weekly
periodicals and devote a certain portion of his space to
the prevailing craze. Here are some useful
HINTS To Collectors.
It should always be borne in mind that, in collecting
the china pomatum or anchovy-paste pot-lids which
are being so much sought after by connoisseurs, by no
means every lid is worth picking up. Such, for example,
as are decorated with no other device but the words
“Potted Prawn,’’ or “Best Bear's Grease,” are of
little commercial or artistic value. On the other hand,
one adorned with a transfer design in colour, represent- |
ing the 1862 Exhibition, or Nelson, as a midshipman,
attacking a Polar bear, may fetch more than an enamel
by LEONARD LIMOUSIN or either of the PéNicauds, for
which the demand has considerably fallen off of late.
A lid with pot complete, especially if it still contains
bloater or shrimp paste, is seldom, if ever, a genuine
antique. A circular frame of blue or crimson plush will
form an admirable set-off for an example of this very
beautiful ware.
Another Art production of the last century that has
gone up enormously in value is the trophy of fruit
realistically moulded in coloured wax under a glass
shade of the period. One of these was recently knocked
down at Christie's for the record figure of one thousand
guineas | But, now that even the humblest dealers are
finding out their value, it is becoming almost impossible
to obtain one for a reasonable price. It is well to
remember, too, that there is always the risk of being
imposed upon by the spurious imitations that are being
turned out by the gross. Several of these “fakes ''
have been acquired for large sums by American mil-
lionaires, though I regret to say that many undoubted
originals have been allowed to leave the country.
Never be persuaded to purchase a trophy of which every
peach, plum, grape, etc., is intact. This is generally
an indication that it is quite modern.
People of taste are taking more and more to decorate
their sitting-rooms with the beautiful memorial cards,
executed in white, black, and silver, which were
formerly considered only fit to hang on the walls of
cottage parlours. One very smart woman I know is
the proud possessor of no fewer than a hundred of these
charming, works, many of them enriched with original
poetry, which she has gradually amassed while motoring
through country villages.
It seems singular that the claims of the old wool-
work kettleholders of the Mid-Victorian age to be con-
sidered as serious Art should have been so long ignored,
but they are now coming into their own at last. A
friend of mine managed to secure quite a chef d’aeuvre
the other day—with a kettle picked out in strong black
on a scarlet ground, and the quaint device of “Put
the – on "-for no more than a five-pound note l
Fortunately, the dealer happened to be an exceptionally
ignorant, and unsophisticated old woman. These kettle-
holders look lovely in an old Florentine gilt frame—or,
better still, in one of ebony and tortoiseshell.
In old furniture nothing is more remarkable than the
recent revolt against the hideous SHERATON, CHIPPEN.

an eyesore to persons of any artistic sensibility, and
the return to purer and loftier ideals. If you should be
lucky enough to possess or inherit, for instance, such
a treasure as a carved Swiss chair with a chamois
inlaid on the back in ivory, and a musical box under
the seat that will play the overture to William Tell
when sat upon, don't on any account be induced to
part with it. In another year or two it may be almost
priceless.
The cult for Early-Victorian mahogany suites shows
no signs of decreasing, though it is not everyone who
is capable of appreciating the severe simplicity of their
style. Only a day or two ago I was horrified to find
that an acquaintance who had just obtained a sofa, six
chairs, and two arms, in fine condition, was actually
proposing to replace the lovely original horsehair by
Louis XV. tapestry ! I was only just in time to prevent
such vandalism.
Next week I shall have something to say about
worsted and crewel-work napkin rings, or “serviette-
holders,” which is, perhaps, the more refined term.
Meanwhile I may observe that I shall always be happy
to give my opinion on the value of any objects of Art
or articles of vertu that may be forwarded to me for
inspection. These (if marketable) will immediately be
disposed of, to cover expenses. And now, as several
readers have anticipated this column by writing already
to ask for advice, I will conclude with a few
ANswers To CoRREspondents.
BRUNNER MACD.—Your “ British Fleet at anchor,” if
in good condition, is of far greater value than you appear
to realise. To cut it down as you suggest would render
it practically worthless. - -
KEIR H.—The model of which you send a drawing, |
representing a “Car of Jaggernath, as used by British
Commissioners and other Indian Civil Service officials
when making a progress,” is undoubtedly of native
manufacture, but much too crudely coloured to possess
the exaggerated value you attribute to it. Afraid you
have been imposed upon.
T.B.C. (375, Oxford St.).-Your copy of “The
Hustlersville (Ohio) Commercial Directory for 1895,”
uncut and in fair condition, should prove a very saleable.
lot. Why not make it the “Bargain for To-day ’’ at
18. 11d. ” Or it might be given to the Poor.
G.B.S. (Savoy).-The articles you believe to be bon-
bonnières are really cavalry holsters of a pattern sealed
for the Bulgarian or Servian Army any time within ||
the last thirty years. The chocolate-cream found in ||
one of them, however, is an unmistakable antique.
H.C. (Greeba Castle).-The deal writing-slope on
which the cheap popular edition of The Bondman
was composed is not of any special value. I should
leave it to the nation. Or else give it to the Poor.

THE SMITH FAMILY.
INTERESTING MAss MEETING.
SENSATIONAL INTERRUPTIONS.
UPoN the announcement in the
| public press that the history of the
SMITH family was to form an episode
of the Bury St. Edmund's pageant a
mass meeting of the clan (or ilk) was
called for Sunday afternoon last in
Smithfield, at which most of the
SMITHs in Who's Who were pre-
sent, together with a large contingent
from the Post Office Directory. The
chair was taken by Mr. G. O.
SMITH, the famous international,
supported on the platform by Mr.
Aubrey SMITH from the Garrick
Theatre, Mr. ToM SMITH the cracker
king, Mr. F. E. SMITH, K.C. (the
new Tory humourist), and others.
Mr. G. O. SMITH, after congratu-
lating the family on its numerosity
—(laughter)—read a cablegram of
encouragement from Mr. Goldwin
SMITH, the Canadian Nestor, and
then stated that the meeting had
been called to ask for five worthy
representatives of the family to be
chosen from London for the Bury St.
Edmund's revels. Would five John
SMITHS volunteer?
No sooner had Mr. SMITH uttered
these words than fifty-three thousand
eight hundred and twenty-four arms
were raised. The counting having
been accomplished, Mr. SMITH
selected five and five understudies,
and after thanking the remaining
53,814 John SMIths for their willing-
ness and patriotism, sat down.
The rising of JEM SMITH, the ex-
Üß was the signal for cheers.
What he wished to say was let there
be more pageants. (Cheers.)
were good things. (Cheers.)
Mr. REGINALD SMITH, K.C., the
F. followed, but he had
ardly begun his very interesting re-
marks when a procession headed by
a very brass band entered Smithfield
from the west, and approached the
latform. They were (said the
eader, Sir JAMEs CRichton-BRowNE)
a deputation of the BRowN family,
who had come to protest against so
much attention being paid to the
SMITHS. Among those present were
BRow N, New LAND and LECLERC,
BustER BRow N, and the Brown Dog.
The SMITHs by an enormous majority
refusing to hear the deputation, it
moved off to Battersea, amid the
derisive singing of John Brown's
Body.
The Hon. W. F. D. SMITH, M.P.,
then rose. This was, he said, one of
the great moments of his life. (Ap-
They
plause.) Never in a long public
career did he remember to have seen
such an intelligent audience.
(Cheers.) With their permission he
would read them a passage of the
highest significance from the works
of ADAM – (laughter) — SMITH.
(Cat-calls.) Whether or not the
speaker would have had his way
no one knows, for at this moment
there entered Smithfield from the
east a second procession heralded by
a blare of trumpets. On reaching
the platform the leader explained
that he was Sir ALFREd Jones, and
he had come with other influential
members of the Jones Family to ad-
just the balance. They claimed to
be of equal importance with the
SMITHs, and they objected to be left
out in the cold. Where was their
pageant? In other words, what was
going to happen to Jon Es? Among
those who supported Sir ALFRED were
Mr. HENRY ARTHUR Jon Es, the
dramatist, Mr. KENNEDY Jones, the
Carmelite Street mystery man,
Messrs. DickeNs and Jones, and the
President of the Welsh Harp Cymric
Bathing Club. A contingent of
SMITH's newspaper boys having been
told off to clear the square the original
meeting was resumed.
Mr. F. E. SMITH, K.C., kept the
vast concourse in roars of laughter by
his droll quips and riddles, among
the latter being the question, “When
is a SMITH not a SMITH 2'' the sar-
casm in the speaker's voice as he
supplied the scathing reply, “When
he 's a SMythe,” being something not
easily forgotten by even the youngest
there.
He was followed by the mayor of
Ladysmith, happily in England at
this juncture; but what that speaker
said no one knew, for his voice was
drowned by the fanfares blown by
the trumpeters of the Robinsons, who
at that moment entered Smithfield,
thousands strong, from the north.
Their leader, Dean Robinson from
Westminster Abbey, was supported
by a detachment of stalwart young
livers-in from PETER Robinson's, by
the Swiss family of that name, and
representatives of RoPINsoN CRUsor,
from all the provincial pantomimes.
A posse of blacksmiths, however,
who had been brought to the meeting
to deal with interruptors, fired them
into Little Britain before you could
say “Jack Robinson,” and the pro-
ceedings were resumed.
The meeting terminated automati-
cally when Mr. HoRAcE SMITH, the
magistrate, rose to address it. With.
out waiting to hear the sentence the
company stampeded in all direc-
tions.

LEGAL NOTE.
["A regrettable incident occurred during the
luncheon interval in the Lord Chief Justice's
Court. A dispute arose between two wel-
known King's Counsel, and those who were near
declare that several blows were exchanged."]
The elevation of Mr. SPARLING was
not unexpected. Mr. Justice SPAR-
LING, as we shall now have to call
him, had long been marked out by
his broken nose for preferment. He
has literally fought his way to the
front rank of his profession. His
atest triumph was gained in the
amous Piffle Chancery action, which
had been in and out of the courts for
years. One morning he was met in
the purlieus of the court by “the Pet
of Paper Buildings.” who was lead-
ing for the other side, and they
agreed to “settle the case out of
court.” The “Pet " got the best of
the first round; but in the second the
“Darling ”—as the new Justice is
popularly called—knocked his oppo-
nent out, and within ten minutes a
case that had occupied a whole
decade had been decided for ever.

THE LATEST AUTOBIOGRAPHY;
or, MoRE MUSTARD LEAVES FROM
THE LIFE OF PAPA’s DAUGHTER.
I HAVE had a most eventful life,
for as papa's daughter I naturally
have met everyone at least once, and
I have always made a point of sum-
ming them up very quickly and with-
out any silly false sentiment. If you
want that kind of thing it is quite
useless to come to me for it; but if
you want to see papa's friends during
the past fifty years truthfully
touched off, why, I am your
authoress.
There is poor old SALA, for ex-
ample, one of papa's oldest friends.
I remember as if it were yesterday
how SALA and his wife came to dinner
one evening. Mr. SALA was talking
to me in the inner drawing-room
when BRET HARTE was announced. I
notieed Mr. SALA start and look out
eagerly into the other room; but, be-
fore he could move, papa came up
with BRET HARTE, saying, “I want
to introduce my old friend SALA to
you, Mr. HARTE.” SALA got up; but
before anything else could be said,
BRET HARTE looked straight at SALA,
and remarked quite coolly, “Sorry to
make unpleasant scenes, but I am
not going to be introduced to that
scoundrel.” Imagine the sensation,
if you can Papa protested, and tried
to ºmake some sort of a modus
vicendi between the two men, but it
ended by poor SALA and his wife
going into the little library, and wait-
ing there until a cab could be
fetched, and they left us without
their dinner. Mr. BRET HARTE being
the new friend and rather a lion, of
course the old friend who had been
insulted was the one to send away
without dinner. But isn't it a nice
story to tell the world, particularly as
both Mr. SALA and Mr. BRET HARTE
are dead?
I remember the present GERMAN
EMPEROR only too well. As a child
he came to papa's studio to be
painted, and his conduct was simply
awful. He was quiet at first, be-
cause he was picking the great cairn-
gorm in the dirk handle and then
casting it away; and I do not think
that it was ever found—very likely it
is in the German crown at this
moment; then he began to fidget; his
mother tried to hold him, and at last
handed him over to his two uncles,
LEopold and ARTHUR, whose bare
legs he bit, while º bore the pain
like Stoics. I only hope they
smacked him well when they got the
little ruffian back to the Castle. I
Sive this reminiscence because one

should, I hold, set down everything;
and of course it is not everyone who
is in a position to describe with
accuracy the extraordinarily bad be-
haviour of the GERMAN EMPEROR as a
small boy. All authors, I consider,
have a public duty, and then–where
is papa's cairngorm 2 -
One of papa's jokes was too splen-
did. We had a foreign teacher whom
papa asked to sit for one of the figures
in a new picture. The Signor ob-
jected—some think naturally enough
but he consented on papa's giving him
a solemn promise not to reproduce
his features. He did not see the pic-
ture until it was completed, and the
day before it was to be exhibited, and
then he nearly had a fit; it was he
himself. Papa must paint it out,
must alter it, and he raved and tore
about the painting-room until papa
gave him some sort of a promise that
he would do what he could. But the
picture went for exhibition un-
touched. The next Thursday came
and no Signor, and so did the Thurs-
day after with the same result, and
at last mama went round to his poor
lodging, which was in one of the
narrow streets leading out of Soho.
But the landlady . only tell her
that the Signor had gone out as usual
on the Tuesday, leaving all his goods
and chattels about, and had never
returned. From that day to this we
have never heard the reason of his
disappearance. I daresay he com:
mitted suicide; but wasn't it a good
joke? Some people think that papa
ought to have kept his word; but why
should a great artist be bound in
little petty ways like that? Besides,
the man was only an Italian teacher.

deeply enter into the whole economical life
overthere which is narrowly connected with
the German sale. Stopping of orders, restraints
and close of numerous plants, as well coming
back of European immigrants in frightening
manner. All these marks shows that the
economical shaking overthere cannot be con-
sidered to be slightly overcome.

THE READING COMPETITION.
MoTHER is really cross about it,
and has asked me to write to Mr.
Punch. You see father is a sort of
literary man, and he was just getting
nicely over the Limerick craze when
this new competition came out, and
now he's worse than ever, and is
always bothering us about it. It 's
like this. The paper father reads has
offered all sorts of big prizes for
answering the questions that it sets
every day. You can always find the
answer to these questions in the
paper itself, and you must say where-
abouts in the paper the answer is to
be found. This morning the ques-
tion was “What are Mr. BALFour's
Christian names?” Of course every-
body knows the answer, only you 've
got to find it in the paper, which they
say trains you to read it properly.
Father seemed to think this ques.
tion would be a very easy one, and
he read all the political articles
very carefully; but Mr. BALFour's
name didn't come in, as it was a
Monday, and the House of Commons
doesn't talk on Saturdays. Then
father read all the sporting news,
in case Mr. BALFour had been
winning any golf handicaps; but
he hadn't been playing anywhere
apparently, so father tried all the
advertisements about indigestion
and torpid livers, because he said
that if Mr. BALFour gave up active
work so suddenly he would probably
have had to take some of the
remedies, and might have sent them
a testimonial.
Mother said it would save time if
father began at the top of the front
page, and read the whole paper right
through; but father worked it out,
and said it would take him 7 hours
9 minutes and 41 seconds to do that,
even if he never looked up once, and
pointed out to us the advantages of
his logical training. He said that the
fact that Mr. BALFourt had not been
making any speeches or playing golf
was a definite clue, and as he didn't
seem to have sent any testimonial for
back-ache cures, father went on to
the reports from the seaside and then
to the police news.
After lunch mother suggested that
he should finish his article on “Great
Statesmen of the Day.” Father
only told her not to bother him, as
he had thought of another possibility.
He gave me the sheet with the City
and financial news, and asked ºne
just to glance through it in case the
markets had been affected by the
| political situation, while he worked
out his new theory. I couldn't find
anything, and mother picked up my
“Who's That you'RE DRAwing, Bob?”
“SEAN'T TELL You.”
“It isn't Much like hER.”
“WASN'T MEANT For HER!”
page to read the instructions for
making a baby's pelisse, which were
on the back of the same sheet.
Then father, who had been think-
ing very hard, suddenly shouted,
“Eureka! " I jumped up at once,
and asked him to show me where he
had found it; but he hadn't really
found it at all, only it had struck him
that the explanation was that Mr.
BALFour had been writing a new
book, and his name would appear
either among the reviews or in the
publishers' announcements. Mother
had got out her scissors and, not
thinking what she was doing, I sup-
pose, was making a paper-pattern for
the baby's pelisse out of the sheet
that the instructions were on.
Presently father said, “Oh, blow
the thing,” and crumpled up the rest
of the paper, and came over to see
what we were doing. He always will
interfere, and want us to do our dress-
making on his own scientific lines,
which don't work at all. “What
are you making?" asked father, and
when mother had explained he made
her give him the instructions, which
she did to save bother. Then he
began to read them aloud—he says
you get a clearer idea of them by
doing this—and they began like this:
“A dainty and attractive garment
for a child of some six to twelve
months old He stopped there
to point out that our baby was
thirteen months old, so that the
daint and attractive garment
wouldn't fit. Mother explained that
that didn't matter, so he went on,
“some six to twelve (or thirteen)
months old, is the ARTHUR JAMEs
BALFour pelisse.”
So will Mr. Punch please make a
cartoon showing that this competi-
tion is really gambling, and saying
that Mr. GLADstone ought to stop it?

Vienna, March 2nd.
THE Bishop of LoNDoN arrived at midday to-day.
After playing a tennis match with the station-master
he proceeded to his hotel, and at two o'clock he was
driven to the Imperial Palace in a motor car. After
an informal conversation his Lordship stripped for a
game of Bowls with his Majesty the Emperor. The
result was for a long time doubtful, but in the last
game the Bishop's bias had its due effect, and the
Emperor had to acknowledge defeat. After the massed
bands had played “God Save the King ” the Bishop
addressed a few touching words to the Imperial circle.

The Bishop of LONDON on his arrival to-day was wel-

he drove to his hotel, and at two o'clock was ready for
the International Foursome over the Royal Hungarian
Links. : The game was exciting, but the Bishop's
magnificent short play saved the match for the Union
Jack. His partner, the Third Secretary of the British
Embassy, was bunkered at the last hole, but the
Bishop extricated the ball and won the game. In the
evening the Bishop attended a Mothers' Meeting of
Hungarian magnates and spoke feelingly on “Kossuth:
What he stood for.”

The Bishop of LoNDoN arrived here to-day and imme.

Her Majesty the Queen. CARMEN SYLVA got a good
start and kept ahead till the last ballad but one. Here,
however, the Bishop's rhyming ability stood him in
good stead, and amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the
assembled Roumanian notabilities he gradually forged
ahead, and eventually won the match. The Bishop's
ballad has been printed at the National Press, and is to
be set to music by the King's organist with a view to
its being played by the Royal Guards at their morning
parades.

The Bishop of LoNDoN crossed the Danube in safety
yesterday and arrived here at 6 a.m. to-day. He won
a Cold Bath match against the Premier at eight o'clock,
and at ten he drove to Slivnitza to meet PRINCE FERDI-.
NAND on the Royal Bulgarian Quoits Pitch. Having
defeated the Prince, the Bishop returned to his hote
and polished the Exarch off at draughts. The after-
noon was devoted to light refreshments, and in the
evening the Bishop gave illustrations of Shove-halfpenny
before the Sobranje. -

House of Commons, Monday, Feb-
ruary 24.—It is the fashion to de-
scribe PRINCE ARTHUR as indefinite in
his opinions on certain questions and
bewildering in effort not to express
them. This charge may not be
brought against him in respect of
Education Bill. As soon as McKENNA
completed his brief and masterly ex-
position of new scheme he was on
his legs demolishing it. Absolutely
revelled in opportunity of hitting
straight out from the shoulder unem-
barrassed by considerations of Fiscal
niceties.
A House crowded in every part
looked on with animated interest.
Here was the Government backed by
big majority making second attempt
to solve perennial difficulty of Edu-
cation as affected by religious ques-
tion. Beaten back the first time by
the Lords, they return with signifi-
--
cant declaration that there is more in
new Bill than meets the eye. Inci-
dentally it deals with Education.
Actually it involves question of exist-
ence of the House of Lords under its
ancient conditions. What will the
Lords do? Will they show desire to
temporise, to make friends with the
adversary whilst he is in the way,
and so keep a roof above their heads;
or will they, faced by a measure from
their point of view worse than that of
1906, hew it in pieces?
PRINCE ARTHUR's animated speech
an unmistakable reply. “Nothing,”
he declared, “can make this Bill a
good Educational method. Educa-
tion you sacrifice absolutely to the
violence of religious prejudice and the
desire to injure a Church to which
you do not belong.”
Battle-cry answered by cheers and
counter-cheers. But there was plainly
lacking the turbulent note of pure
partisanship frequently heard in
analogous circumstances. Members
recognised the seriousness of the new
situation, and were subdued in con-
templation of its possibilities. Truly
in place of the proffered olive branch
a sword was brandished. Without a
moment's hesitation PRINCE ARTHUR
drew his, and the momentous fight
forthwith began.

was double-headed. At the very
moment he spoke the other House
was engaged in Committee on Scot-
tish Land Bill introduced by Govern-
ment, and thrown out last year by the
Lords. CAMPERDown's Bill was prac-
tically the English Small #.
Bill added to Statute Book last Ses-
sion. Proposal was that it should be
extended to Scotland in preference to
measure now before the Commons,
presently, with cup-filling intent, to
come on to the Lords.
Structure of joke growing a little
complicated. But the parts so artis-
. put together that it went off
with a flash. A little by-play con-
tributing to success was the spectacle
of the shade of Bob REID, long known
in House of Commons as most un-
compromising Radical of the day, dis-
guised in wig and gown, throned on
Woolsack, whilst LANsdowne and
other Unionist Peers patted him on
the back, the Bishops cooing ap-
proval. The Government measure,
when it reaches the Lords, will be in
his charge. CREwe described as act
of discourtesy to LoRD CHANCELLOR
the attempt to forestall his action
and his Bill. Leader of Opposition,
with tears in his voice, protested that
nothing was further from the
thoughts of himself or his noble
friend. They esteemed the occupant
of the wº too highly ever to
dream of affronting him. Whereat
the Bishops cooed again, and CAM-
PERDow N applied sympathising
pocket-handkerchief to damp and
deprecating eyes.
RoseBERY created for himself a de-
lightful part in the comedy. In
sparkling speech he chaffed his
esteemed son-in-law on the difficulty
that environed him, inasmuch as he
was obliged to oppose the extension
to Scotland of a recent Act passed
at the instance of his colleagues, and
by common consent most beneficent
in its operation.
“My noble relative,” RoseBERY
said, “got out of his difficulty with
the airy grace of a butterfly; but it
was a butterfly with a pin through
it.” -
The play having run for two hours
amid frequent bursts of merriment,
Court.NEY thought there 'd been

the matter of enquiry into monastic
and conventual institutions. Thirty
years ago CHARLEs NEWDIGATE-
NEwdEGATE, almost the last repre-
sentative of unadulterated dignified
Toryism known at Westminster, was
in his prime. Every Session he
brought in sometimes a Bill, some-
times a Resolution, designed to reveal
what he in sepulchral voice hinted
were the dark mysteries carried on
behind the walls of conventual insti-
tutions. Whether Bill or Resolution,
it was promptly hustled out of House
by big majority. NEwdEGATE not the

himself when he rose surrounded by
Irish Members foaming with rage
(humorously simulated), at his at-
tack upon their Church and their
womenkind.
One of these occasions was made
memorable by revelation to House
of a new and original humourist
in person of Major O'Gorman. In
the privacy of his London lodgings,
the ºf. had elaborated a parable
designed to illustrate the operation of
the enquiry contemplated by NewDE-
GATE. Puffing and snorting, his vast
bosom heaving with emotion, he pic-
tured “one of these Royal Commis-
sioners '' demanding admission at a
convent. The door opened; a nun
appeared; the Commissioner asked
her to define her station.
“Sir, I will tell you,” she would
reply, the Major assured the crowded
House. “My sire was a king; my
mother was the daughter of the sixth
JAMES OF Scotland and the first
JAMEs of ENGLAND. His mother,
sir, was Queen Regent of Scotland.”
Further tracing the genealogical
tree, whose branches were hopelessly
interwoven, the Major continued, still
impersonating the nun and lowering
his stentorian voice to piping accents
accordingly, “I have a brother.”
The brother having, like either the
nun's father or mother (it was not
clear which) been done to death, the

“WOTES FOR MEN.”
THE Bachelors' Freedom League,
with which is associated The Bache-

now open to receive funds. At pre-

who are distributed as follows: —

“It really doesn't matter so long

WILLIAMs, when at school, was the

you can't behave like a suffragentle-

afraid we shall only be able to give
him a minor post on the staff. Just

ENRY filled and lit his pipe.
“You see,” he said, “there is a
small regulation about the length of

tered in June, if you have been in
the same rooms for a year, or some-
thing like that. Now it 's about

tion in that time. . . . Quite half

“IRight you are,” said WILLIAMs.
“Let 's start at once, captain.” He
looked at his watch. “Hallo, it's

way to the Vegetarian Restaurant.
So the Bachelors' Freedom League
is formed, and all single men are
invited to join. We have a battle-
cry, right on our side, a good example
in the women, and no end of sport
in front of us. All we really want
now is funds. We have had some

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THAT London is a romantic place many people have
insisted. STEvenson was the first; the latest is Mr.
MARRIOTT WATson in his tales of two people, entitled
A Poppy Show (METHUEN). I must suppose that I am
unlucky, for I have never had an adventure in London.
The nearest I came to it was when an elderly seafaring
man accosted me in Northumberland Avenue one dark
and windy night, and asked the way to Portsmouth. I
showed him roughly the direction, and bade him God-
speed. There my connection with the matter ended;
but I am certain that Romance was afoot that night
—a lugger beating off-shore (or whatever it is they do),
and waiting for the tardy signal . . . . Even the com-
mon countryman has more adventures than I; he at least
is relieved of his purse and told an exciting story of a
gold brick. Perhaps I should not do justice to any
encounter that came my way.
WATson is shown into a

he carries it off with a
delightful coolness; in his

would lead me to take

not be surprised at my
disappearance, for it is
plainly his opinion that
your man of forty is the
only person to see these
affairs through properly.
As it is another of his
opinions that the girl of
eighteen is everything

it won't add too much to the depression he must now be
suffering through the loss of the ashes. Frankly, the
atmosphere of the Brecknock borderland is not too
exhilarating, and though the author of The Sheep-
stealers possesses a peculiar knowledge of this country
her methods of imparting it in her present book are in-
dustrious rather than inspired. The story itself holds
the interest very passably; but it seldom escapes from
familiar levels. The scene that gives the burying of the
plague-stricken Eustace is an exception—a grim, un-
sparing piece of realism. The author has, perhaps, put
her best work into the character of Hester, a woman
originally colourless and passive, whom a tyrannous
love and a tyrannous hate render capable de presque
tout. She is drawn with that uncompromising relent.

There is a great deal of very good writing in this book:
the East Coast landscapes, the colloquies of the towns-

excellent. But there are also some serious lapses into
the slipshod, and I am not at all certain whether
the plot can really be justified, the sorrows of a hang-

have denounced it as a sordid and unspeakable outrage,
as a leprous stain on the thin garb of false religious pro-
fessions in which those who support it pretend to be
clad. But it is something worse, far worse, than this.
It is the elevation of chicanery and petty larceny into a
fine art. Henceforth let no man shudder at the black-

naked and unashamed, is rearing her hateful head in our

crushes him to pulp. With the other she eviscerates
the pallid publican, and boisterously beats the brewer
down into the dust. How shall our judges reconcile it
to their consciences to sentence the thief or to mete out
a condign punishment to the fraudulent trustee, while
the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his minions walk
unabashed in the light of day with no one to say them
nay? Whither is fled the manhood of England? If

Two years ago—how Time does fly!—

Bell-like and clear (not quavery):—
“Down with the reptile Tory brood |
Down with the price of daily food |
And down with Chinese ‘Slavery
As when of old some sacred Bird
Gave augury, the Liberals heard
And knew the heavenly token; .*

It is the Sovereign People's Voice;

But, now that Demos turns his coat
And they observe the Tariff vote
Swell up like vernal flora,
The Thing that bade Millennium come
Is called a piffling pendulum,
A popularis aura.
And yet we thank our natal star
That we are not as Frenchmen are,
Inconstant, jumpy, skittish;
That certain features well-defined
Which stamp the bulldog cast of mind
Are traits uniquely British
Wobblers, I fear, we still shall be,
Like jelly or the aspen-tree
(Those types of instability),
Until our Women grace the poll
And graft on Man's effeminate soul
Their own superb virility.
Meanwhile I do dislike to think
Our fate depends—to swim or sink—
On anything so chancy;
That shifts and veers all round the clock,
Behaving like a weather-cock,
To suit the breezes' fancy.

Past Ossa piled on Pelion,
My Lords exist without the need
To bribe and flatter, coax and feed
This monstrous fine chameleon.

REM.INISCENCES OF A LAKE “POET.”
SUMMER visitors to Bowness, Windermere, twenty-five
or thirty years ago, could hardly fail to notice a small
corrugated-iron stall on a patch of waste ground beside
one of the lanes leading to the lake. Above this stall
was an announcement that “The Poet CLEGG is here,
selling his works.” This, being more than the majority
of poets succeed in achieving, naturally excited my desire
to make his acquaintance—no very difficult matter, as
he seemed rather to invite than shun publicity. I found
him seated behind the open front of his hut; a stout
elderly personage, fresh-coloured, with grey, hair, and
short chin-beard, and light grey eyes like a shrewd but
suspicious parrot's. -
The divine frenzy was upon him just then, for he was
feverishly scribbling a verse with a stubby pencil on the
back of an envelope, so I had to wait until the Muse
had taken flight. At length he looked up; “Are ye a
person of consequence?” he inquired; which obliged me
to confess that I was nobody in particular. “Well,” he
said, “I’ll give ye just five minutes. There were two
noblemen coom to see me the other day, looking like
lords; I received them vera respectfully for half-an-hour,
and at the end of that they offered me a shilling ! ‘No,'
“IN THE CAUSE OF OUR WORKING SISTERS.”
- (See Suffragette Manifestos)
Flower Woman. “I wish THEM SuFFERAJETtes would Move ALONG. They've RUINED My Business To-DAY!”
I told them, ‘ye ’ve wasted half-an-hour of my valuable
time, and then ye insult me with a shilling ! Take
back your shilling,' I said. “Thank God, I 'm in no want
of shillings, any more than yourselves. I took ye for
noblemen and gentlemen—and I find ye're neither!'”
“I count myself as high as TENNYson every bit,” he
went on, “and my time's my money, and I don't ask
any one to coom to talk to me. I'd rather they'd keep
º if they don't come to buy. What are you going to
uy?”
I bought the Poet's “Tenth Grand Christmas Book,
with fine Portraits and Grand Comic Cuts.” Being a
non-subscriber, I paid five-and-sixpence for it, “in a stiff
cover.” (I might have procured “ the Queen's copy, in
morocco and gold,” for fifteen and sixpence; but I did
not think I could quite afford it.)
“TENNYSoN was at Bowness only a while ago,” he told
me, “and would ye believe it, he was too prood—though
he must ha’ known I was here—to go these few steps out
of his ro-ad to visit a Brother Po-at l” I endeavoured
to express incredulity and astonishment. “I’ve never
read any of his stoof,” he continued; “I’ve no time to
read other Po-ats. I like to use all my spare time
writing out my own compositions. I'm my own Poob-
lisher. London pooblishers won't buy my copyrights—

might consider himself lucky to have got even that forty
pounds. “Well now,” he said, “ye ’ve bought one of
my books—what more do ye want with me?” I am
ashamed to confess that on this I represented that I was
fired with an ambition to write verses, and wished to
know if he would be willing to give me, say, six lessons
in the art of Poetry. I was nearly thirty years younger
then, and the temptation was irresistible. Now of course
I should overcome it—at least, I trust so. “Eh,” he
said, “Po-atry's a thing ye canna be taught. ... It just
cooms. There 's times I feel it floating through my
brain, like the air there. I mind well how I first coom
to write. I was a lad of seventeen, and I'd had a
quarrel with soom o' the Grammar School boys, and I
told them: “I defy ye, with all your Latin and all your
Greek 1 I'll just go home and write a reply that shall
crush ye!' I couldna sleep all that night, and the morn
I got oop in my nightshirt and wrote a satire on the
white-washed wall reet off, and copied it down on paper,
and had it prented—and for three weeks the toon was
like Election time ! One big scholar wanted to fight
me aboot it, but I said, ‘Nay, I've won my battle !'
And so I had l But I couldna tell ye whether ye ’ve the
makings of a Po-at in ye withoot ye show me soom of
your attempts. . . Now I must away. I can't afford to
talk with ye any longer; working here all day knocks me
oop, and I have to write all night.”
He was even more busy and important when I next
requested an audience. “I can't attend to ye now,” he
said, “I’m correcting the proofs of my next Christmas
book, and that 's more important to the Pooblic, and
more pleasant to you in the long run, ye know, than
what ye 've come aboot.” But I persuaded him to
glance at a little thing of my own—an Ode to the Moon,
of which all I remember is that I compared her, when in
crescent form, to “a paring from pale Dian's finger-nail,”
and inquired: “O Moon | Are Railways and the Electric
Telegraph known to thee yet? Or will they be soon?”
After reading it aloud, he remarked that he noticed I put
my rhymes in the middle of a stanza, a liberty he never
permitted himself, and asked whether I had counted the
syllables in my last line. I owned that I had forgotten
to do so, and he informed me that that kind of line was
known in the profession as an “Alexandrian.” When I
ventured to ask him if he detected any promise in the
poem, he was most encouraging. “It's grand ' " he
said; “there 's a loftiness aboot it that shows me ye only
want practice to be a Po-at. I'll tell ye what I'll do
for ye. I'll º this poem in my next Christmas
number, and have a picture put to it, for I keep an
artist, though I don't wish it to get aboot. There 'll be
Doochesses reading it ! And I'll only charge ye seven-
and-six for setting it oop ''
No one had ever offered to be my publisher before; but
as I couldn't see my way to advance seven-and-six the
Doochesses never had the opportunity of reading my
Ode to the Moon. Which is a pity, because I think it
would have appealed to them. The Poet then com-
plained of the intemperate laudation of some of his ad-
mirers in the Press. “See here—a friendly thing they
wrote of me in The Ulverston Mirror. I had it prented;
but it goes beyond—it's almost too extravagant 1 " . It
was indeed. I was inexpressibly pained to perceive that
the writer had obviously been pulling the Poet's leg.
“There was a man coom to me the other day, and
wants me to write a poem for him, and I says to him—
as I might to yourself—‘Who are ye? I want to know
all aboot ye.’ And he tells me he 's giving a lecture on
all things in Heaven and Earth, and would I write a
sketch saying well of him for the gentry and tradesmen.
Hoo much would it be? “If ye were a rich man I'd
say ten guineas,' I told him, ‘being, as I take ye to be,
poor, it'll be five shillings.’ “Hoo long will it take?'
he says. “Half a day?’ ‘Bless yel " says I, ‘ye just
take a toorn oop yon hill and coom back in five minutes,
and I'll have it written for ye. Stand away! I feel the
lines coming already ' - -
“The Figaro's my friend,” he continued, “and The
Graphic. But they can't get me my pension back. I
sent some verses oop to them, but—and mind this—it
just shows their critic, though dootless a clever man in
his way, is no judge of Po-atry. They only prented one
o' the verses—the vera one I knew myself to be the
worst of the lot '' -
I wonder if it was on the same level of excellence as
the following stanza of his “Grand Electioneering
Poem,” price 3d. :
“We sing not of great KINGs and Royal QUEENs,
Or even take a single glance
At GLADSTONE or great EARL of BEACONsfiei.D
To make some fairly jump and dance' "
It may, or may not, be a reflection on the literary ap-
preciation of the last century, but it must be stated that,
in spite of producing thousands of verses of a quality fully
equal to the above, the Poet CLEgg never succeeded in
getting back that pension. F. A.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEW PARTIES IN POLITICS.
(Special to “Punch.”)
THE proposal mooted in the cor-
respondence columns of our esteemed
contemporary to form a Spectator
Party in politics, has stirred the
nation to its depths. Wellington
Street has been practically blocked
for the last few days by myriads
of ardent partisans anxious to enrol
themselves under the banner of the
gifted editor; and the daily queuc,
carefully shepherded by the police,
has equalled if not eclipsed that of
the audiences of The Christian. But
it was hardly to be expected that the
example set by The Spectator should
not lead to emulation and imitation,
and already it is becoming over-
whelmingly apparent that a number
of similar parties are likely to be
formed, with results most beneficial
to the variety and picturesqueness of
political life.
Foremost amongst the rival groups
is The Observer Party. The leader,
needless to say, is that redoubtable
publicist Mr. J. L. GARVIN, who is
already hailed as the MAssinghAM of
the Tariff Reformers. Confident of
capturing a sufficient number of seats
to place them in an absolute majority
over all other groups combined, The
Observer Party have already formed
their Cabinet. Mr. Leo MAxse will,
of course, be Prime Minister, while
Mr. GARVIN, by his vast abilities as a
financier, is obviously marked out for
the post of Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer. The Foreign Minister will
be Sir Rowland BLENNERHAssETT;
the Secretary for War, Mr. IGNotus,
and the First Lord of the Admiralty,
Mr. CALCHAs. Mr. L. S. AMERY has
kindly consented to act as Colonial
Secretary, and minor posts in the
Administration will be filled by Mr.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, Mr. WALTER
Long, and Mr. BonAR LAw.
The Observer Party, it will be ad-
mitted, is a powerful combination,
but Pearson's Party is hardly less
formidable. Here, again, a pro-
spective Cabinet has been formed,
with Mr. C. ARTHUR PEARson as
Premier and Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, and Mr. PETER KEARY as
Foreign Secretary, with a seat in the
Lords as Lord KEARY of M.A.P. Mr.
GAMAGE will be President of the
Board of Trade; Sir Thomas LIPTON,
First Lord of the Admiralty; Mr.
Lyons, Minister for Education, and
Mr. BARKER, Secretary for War. The
badge and emblem of Pearson's Party
will be a peony, and its war-cry,
"Get On or Get Out.”
For sheer brain-power, however,
Cook. “WELL, IT was LIKE THIS, MUM.
Mistress. “Good gracious, Cook, what have You Done to the coal-scuttle?"
I was A-FILLING of IT IN THE coal-CELLAR, when A
ENORMoUs AVALANCHE commenced To DESCEND FROM THE Top.
And I LEAVE You To judge which was THE Most valuable!”
It was Me on The scuttle, MUM ;
[Whatever doubt there may have been before, Cook is now an easy first.
The British Weekly Party probably
stands unrivalled. As yet no appor-
tionment of posts has been officially
announced, but we understand that
Dr. Robertson NicoLL will contest
the City, Messrs. HopDER and
Stoughton will stand for two Kail-
yard constituencies, while Mr.
CLEMENT Shorter will court the suf-
frages of London University, and Mr.
CLAUDIUs CLEAR will storm Tun-
bridge, Maidstone, or some other
Kentish stronghold.
Other parties in a less forward
state of organisation are the Tit-bits
Party, the Home Chat Party, and
The Earchange and Mart Party, but
the full range of their activities has
not yet been precisely defined.
With regard to The Spectator some
further details may be of interest to
our readers. For instance, every in-
tending member is obliged to sign an
attestation paper declaring his readi-
ness to support cat-and-dog suffrage
and free breakfasts to a number of
birds, including thrushes, robins,
wrens, woodpeckers, and tom-tits,
though the inclusion of the latter
may cause some confusion with the
Tit-bits party. Members of The
Spectator party, again, must all
possess (a) a rifle or (b) a Morris
tube or (c) a Mauser pistol. Their
wardrobe must include a slouch hat,
a bandolier, and a copy of BASTIAT’s
Economic Fallacies.
Circumstances alter Cases.
“His “apologia pro mea infirmitates' did
not help him much among his colleagues.”
No wonder.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
- TAKING: STOCK.
| BEATRice has been spring-cleaning
me to-day, or rather my clothes. I
said, wasn't it rather early for it, as
none of the birds were singing pro-
perly yet, and she had much better
ºãº year; but no, she would
#ºv. BEATRICE is my sister-in-
he said— Well, I forget
id: say, but she took a
fêof things away with
§and I know John will be
ºrit fáncy shirt of mine to-
morrowºśs a matter of fact it was
a perfectly new one, and I was only
waiting till Lent was over.
| BETRice said the things were all
lying about anyhow, and how I ever
found anything to put on she didn't
know; but I could have told her that
(they were all arranged on a symme-
trical plan of my own. BEATRICE
doesn't understand the symmetry of
a bachelor's mind. I like a collar in
each drawer, and then whatever
drawer you open there 's a collar
ready for you. BEATRICE puts them
all in one drawer, and then if you're
in a hurry, and open the wrong
drawer, by mistake, you probably go
up to the office in two waistcoats and
no collar at all. That would be very
awkward. - -
--
BEATRICE actually wanted a braces
drawer-(if she hadn't married JóHN
I should never, let her talk, to me
about braces)—but I explained that
I only had one pair, and was wearing
those, so that it would be absurd. I
expect she wanted me to think that
John had two pairs. All I can say is
that, if he has, he ought to be above
taking my best shirt. . . .
I don't think the waistcoat drawer
will be a success. There are twenty-
three of them, and some of them
don't blend at all well. Twenty-
three in one drawer—you know there
are bound to be disputes. I see
William has got to the top already.
Ah! he was a fine fellow, the first I
ever had. I don't quite know how
to describe him, but in colour he was
emerald green, with bits of red, silk
peeping through. Sort of open-work,
you know, only where you would ex-
pect to see me there was more of
William. I wore him at BEATRICE's
wedding. . He would come. Only he
wouldn't let me into the vestry. I
wanted to sign my name; all the
others were. I have never worn him
since that day; but BEATRICE has
fished him out, and now he lies on
the very top of the drawer.
Of course it 's awfully good of
BEATRice to take so much trouble
about my clothes, and I'm extremely
grateful, and after all she did marry
my brother John ; but I think some-
times she- Well, here 's a case.
You know, when you have twenty-
three waistcoats you perhaps run a
bit short of of other things. So,
naturally, the few you have got left
you— Well, BEATRICE took them all
away, and said that as I, couldn't
possibly wear them again she 'd cut
them up for house-cloths. And
really—half way between winter and
summer is a very awkward time for
re-stocking. But I suppose it is
going to be warmer now? .
House-cloths l I bet John has a
go at them first. . . .
BEATRICE found what they call in
the profession a “morning-coat and
vest '' under the ‘bed, and said that
she would take it away and sell it for
me. I like the way she “finds''
things which I have been keeping for
years under the bed. It is absurd to
talk about “finding '' anything in a
small flat, because of course it's
there all the time; but BEATRICE
thought that I ought to be grateful to
her for her discovery, so I pretended
I was. She said she would get at least
half-a-crown for it; but I said I would
rather have the coat. However, it
turned out that I wasn't even to have
had the half-crown. . . .
... I used to have thirty pairs of old
white gloves in a drawer. I would
take them out sometimes, and stroke
them affectionately, and say, “Ah,
yes, those were the ones I wore at
that absolutely ripping dance when I
first met CYNTHIA, and we had supper
together. You can see where I spilt
the ice pudding.” Or—“This was
that Hunt Ball, when I knew nobody
and danced with HILDEGARDE all the
time. She wore black. Just look at
them now.” Well, BEATRICE had
that drawer out pretty quick. And
now they are on their way to Perth
or Paris, or wherever, it is; except
HiLDEGARDE's pair, which will just
do for the girl when she cleans the
grates. I expect she really will get
them, you know; because John
doesn't dance. -
You know, you mustn't make too
much fun of BEATRICE; she has rip-
ping ideas sometimes. She filled a
“ summer-trunk '' for me—a trunk
full of all the clothes I am going to
want in the summer. She started
with a tennis racquet (which, strictly
speaking, isn't clothes at all), and
went on with some of the jolliest
light waistcoats you ever saw ; it
made me quite hot to look at them.
Well now, that 's really a good idea,
so far as it goes. But what will
happen when the summer does come?
Why, we shall have to go through the
whole business all over again. And
who 'll arrange the winter-trunk?
BEATRICE. And who 'll get the green
pyjamas and the purple socks that
there 's really no room for, dear?
Why, JoHN. - - -- - -
Yet I am sorry for John. He was
once as I am. 'What a life is
his now. BEATRICE is a dear, and
I will allow no one to say a
word against her, but she doesn't
understand that trousers must be
folded, fiot hung; that a collar which
has once been a collar can never be
opened out and turned into a cuff
(supposing one wore cuffs); and that
a school eleven blazer, even if it
happens to be pink, must not be cut
down into a dressing-jacket for the
little one. Poor John Yes, I am
glad now that he has that shirt
of mine. It is perhaps a little too
bright for his complexion, perhaps he
has not quite the air to carry it off;
but I am glad that it is his. Now I
think of it. I have a tie and a pair of
socks that would go well with it; and
even William—can I part with.
William 2 – yes, he shall have
William. Oh, I see that I must be
kind to John. . . . .
Dear BEATRICE ' I wonder when I
shall have everything straight again.

THE PRESS AND THE LION.
I.—“THE PROTECTIONIST.”
. . . WE have the more pleasure
in joining in the chorus of felicitation
upon Mr. Nestorith's eightieth birth-
day because we can so confidently
claim him as an adherent to the great
cause of Tariff Reform. Again and
again in his works, more particularly
the political novels, such as Hol-
loway's Career, may be found the
strongest possible suggestions that
their author is under no misappre-
hension as to the necessity for Pro-
tection if England is again to occupy
her old proud position among the
nations. . .
II.-‘‘THE FREE TRADER.”
The eightieth birthday occurs to-
day of perhaps the grandest Free
Trader now living, one who is old
enough to remember England under
Protection, and who has never fal-
tered from the flag — Mr. GEORGE
NESTORITH, the novelist. Of his
literary attainments we speak later;
but first let it be put on record that
no one can read his works with an
open mind, destitute of party bias,
without being conscious of his in-
tense love of the open market. As a
novelist. . . .
III.-"The Christias Adventises.”
Our hearts are filled with unctuous
joy at the thought that that great
and valiant swordsman for the truth,
Mr. NESTORITH, has been spared to
attain his eightieth birthday. What
English literature would be like
were it not for the presence of such
simple faithful souls we tremble to
think. Superficially, we are aware,
Mr. NESToriTH has now and then
suggested that he could not consider
everything in this world to be for
the best; yet read properly, with
Christian tolerance and imaginative
sympathy, there is not a word in all
his many and wonderful works that
does not breathe a beautiful spirit of
resignation and hope.
IV.-" THE FREETHINKER.”
All freethinkers should rejoice in
the continued vigour and intellect
that are enjoyed by Mr. NESTORITH,
the novelist, whose eightieth birth-
day has just been kept. In all his
works he has consistently brought to
bear upon superstitions the white
light of irony and wit. He has never
paltered with his conscience, which
probably is one reason why his name
is so much better known than his
writings.
W.—“The SUFFRAGIST.”
It is with the greatest possible
pleasure that we wish “many happy
returns of the day '' to Mr. NEST.
orith, the great novelist, not only
because we admire his work, but be-
cause he has shown himself so warm
a friend to our cause. . .
VI.-‘‘THE ANTI-SUFFRAGIST.”
It is pleasant to think that one of
the last public pronouncements made
by Mr. NESTORITH before entering
upon his eighty-first year was a re-
buke of the militant pantechnicon
brigade for their unwomanly and un-
seemly tactics. When criticism
comes from such men as this, the
honoured of the nation, it cannot be
lightly set aside even by the political
Maenad and the vote - desiring
Bacchanal.

Essence of PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
... House of Commons, Monday,
March 2.-Much talk during last
three weeks of revolt in Ministerial
ranks on question of expenditure on
Army and Navy. Almost the last
time C.-B. appeared on Treasury
Bench he warded off impending blow
by suggesting that MURRAY MAC-
DoNALD's resolution, insisting on re-
'duction, should be postponed till
Army and Navy Estimates were pre-
sented. Then, as he observed with
affected ignorance of Parliamentary
methods, Members would know ex-
actly what they were talking about.
C.-B. been in the House long
enough to know that that condition
is immaterial to the moving of reso-
lutions or the making of speeches.
If it is to be rigorously insisted upon,
many of us will be reduced to silence
and inaction.
However, to-day solemnly set apart
for the pow-wow. Opposition crowded
in to enjoy spectacle of Ministers
baited by their own followers. It
wouldn't do for them to support
Resolution put forward by gentlemen
who know more about the Army than
N. BonAPARTE HALDANE, are more
'intimate with the working of the
Navy than JACK FISHER. But a
schism in Ministerial ranks always
pleasant for contemplation from
benches opposite.
Full muster of Ministerialists. The
Independent Labour men were seated
in serried rows below Gangway insis-
'tent on reduction of warlike expendi-
ture. The cost of a Dreadnought or
two, the disbandment of a few batta-
lions of the Line, would go some way
towards providing old-age pensions or
making easier the lot of the Un-
employed, who at Maidenhead the
other day refused to turn the crank
that prepared the morning chips for
the pampered householder.
Looking round the crowded
benches, taking note of the varied
sections, the experienced eye dis-
cerned material for debate and divi-
sion damaging even to the master of
legions. In other circumstances prog-
nostication might have been realised.
Suppose, for example, that before
LLoyd-GEORGE found salvation on
Treasury Bench he had undertaken
to lead this attack on the Govern-
ment. Things would have hummed.
MURRAY MACDONALD not an ideal cru-
sader. There is about him a subtle,
indescribable but unmistakable
Bow - and - Bromley manner that
stifles enthusiasm. In low voice,

The Hon. F. W. Limbt-n chaſis Mr. H-ld-ne on Army'Estimates,
paper on the virtue of economy, our
friendly relations with Foreign
Powers, and the righteousness of
retrenchment in the expenditure on
armaments.
The effect on John BRUNNER of the
reading of the paper was remarkable.
Whilst others were depressed, he was
in merriest mood. Assuming an easy
attitude and a conversational tone,
he delighted the House with certain
autobiographical details, chiefly re-
lating to visits to Paris and Berlin.
On one of the former, welcomed and
fed—John seems to have dined im-
partially in both capitals—by a repre-
sentative body of Frenchmen, a
native orator addressed him at
length.
“A most beautiful speech,” said
J. B., his eyes uplifted to the gas-lit
roof in ecstatic recollection.
It had reference to a jaunt of
Trades Unionists - to Paris. The
orator remarked upon the circum-
stance that winter preceded spring;
spring's deft fingers touched the
'sward and lo! the crocus bloomed.
Then, in the ordinary course of
things, comes summer with its
wealth of fruit and foliage. The
poetic fancy of the orator somehow
linked the arrival of the Trades
Unionists on the Boulevard with the
coming of summer. . . .
It doesn't work out very well in
English. The Labour Members were
anxious that John should quote the
text in French. He, suddenly re-
membering that the passage had
nothing to do with the Itesolution he
had risen to second, returned to his
notes. - * . . .
Bucked up again when he got to
Berlin, this time carrying the red dis-
patch box and the dignity of Royal
Commissioner. Spent what he ad-
mitted was “a convivial evening ”
with German hosts. When he was
leaving one of them said, “I don't
trust you yet.” ‘’’
Regarded as a remark having per-
sonal bearing, this at once unkind
and unjust. Not, an honester, more
reliable man in the Commons than
Member for Northwich. House under-
stood that the thing was an allegory.
The convivial German, embodying
for the moment the Fatherland, and
regarding J. B. as representing Great
Britain and Ireland, waggishly ad-
monished him. -
In the end, which didn't come till
close of an eight hours' day of talk,
MACDONALD's Resolution was nega-
tived by 320 votes against 73.
AsquiTH had placed on paper a deftly
drawn amendment, bland with
pleasing generalities. Eleven o'clock
struck before it was reached, after
which hour opposed business may
not be taken. PRINCE ARTHUR pro-
posing to move amendment, debate
collapsed, a right conclusion of the
matter from an artistic point of view.
Business done.—None.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
Tuesday.—Whilst Cousin HUGH
was still with us, going strong on the
Fiscal Question, PRINCE ARTHUR used
occasionally to remark with deep-
drawn sigh, “Life would be endur-
able but for its cousins. They are
worse than other facts and figures.”
Cousin HUGH is now afar off in
the wilderness, leaving the House
lamenting. Facts and figures remain,
and from time to time PRINCE
ARTHUR stumbles over them. To
have them further complicated by
the incidence of Leap Year is enough
to daunt a less resolute heart.
Matters especially perplexing this
evening. Motion to go into Com-
mittee on Navy Estimates. Prelimi-
nary tussle. Important section of
Ministerialists take up their parable
against bloated armaments. Oppo-
sition insist they 're not bloated nearly
enough. Financial Secretary to Ad-
miralty goes minutely into figures to
show that what has been achieved at
Whitehall is the juste milieu, the line
of perfection on which is marked ab-
solute security combined with perfec-
tion of economy. To prove his case
cites columns of figures, setting forth
what Germany and England are
severally doing in matter of de-
stroyers, torpedo boats (first-class
and second-class), submarines and
eke cruisers.
PRINCE ARTHUR, patiently listening
hour after hour, at length steps in.
His point is to show that though the
necessities of the current year have
been fairly met, overwhelming de-
mands on the Exchequer will be
made in 1909. Starts cautiously.
“The year 1908,” he said, “con-
sists of only 12 months.”
No one objecting to this, some
even applauding, he proceeded,
“Those months will soon be through.
When 1909 begins, it will be found
that an expenditure not inadequate
for the necessities of the 365 days—”
Here in half a dozen voices swiftly
came the correction. “Three hun-
dred and sixty-six.” Not noticing
the interruption nor acknowledging,
whilst adopting, the correction, he
went on—“the necessities of the 366
days—”
Shouts of “Three sixty-five ’’ burst
forth.
Things growing desperate. Which
was it? Hit high or hit low—366 or
365—he could not please them. Only
thing to do was to ignore interrup-
tion and finish his sentence. This he
proceeded to do. Resuming his seat
he furtively drew forth his pocket-
book. Spent some time with the
assistance of almanack in working
out the puzzle whether there are 365
days in the year or 366.
WRESTLING" witH THAT whetched ARITHMETIC.
“Excepting Leap-year, at which time
February's days are twenty-nine.”

to background, by what was known
as The Strange Case of Sir CARNE
RAsch. The Member for Chelmsford,
whose absence and its cause are to-
day regretted in both political camps,
had been seen by such responsible
witnesses as Sir ARTHUR HAYTER,
MEYSEY - THOMPson, and GILBERT
PARKER, in his usual place above the
Gangway at a time when he was cer-
tified to be confined to his bed by
illness.
Analogous case has of late ruffled
meditation of Members. A quarter
of a century ago one of the most
familiar figures in the House was the
tall, slim, upright one of Lord
ARTHUR HILL. Returned for Kilmar-
nock in 1877, he from '80 to '98 re-
presented a division of County Down.
For thirteen years he acted as Whip
of the Unionist Party. Ten years ago
he retired from the scene, giving
place to his son ARTHUR.
Since the new Session opened
what seemed to be the wraith of the
old Whip returned to his familiar
place. He was seen in the Lobby as
of yore, save that, being no longer a
Whip, he wore his hat. He was fre-
quently observed sitting solitary in a
side gallery, looking down on the
strangely altered scene. He spoke
to few, and few addressed him. He
took no part in debate, and was not
eager to participate in division.
New turn given to the mystery by
issue of a writ for the election of a
Member for the Western Division of
County Down “to serve in the place
of Lord ARTHUR HILL, who since his
election has accepted post of Steward
of the Chiltern Hundreds.” This
varies the mystery, but does not ex-
plain it. Why should an old Mem-
ber, yearning for the scenes of yore,
go through trouble and expense of
contested election, wander about the
House for a month, and then resign?
The wraith accounted for, there still
remains, something uncanny about
the incident.

[“The 3rd V.B. Northumberland Fusiliers'
Mess Gazeka is dead.”—-Local Paper.]
IN the Mess-room of the 3rd Corps,
In the wainscot by the doorway,
Lived our little Mess Gazeka,
Lived our regimental bogy.
No one truly ever saw him,
Though some said he wore a hair tuft
And declared they'd seen him
hopping
On the carpet after dinner;
Yet his voice was heard by all men
Once or twice at least each evening,
Queerly comic, bubbly peevish,
Partly whistle, partly choking,
Like a trombone filled with porridge.
At the usual yearly meeting
Once there rose a windy speaker,
Spoke of many things and varied,
Things beyond the ken of all men;
But at length his voice was silent,
And he slowly settled downward;
Then there came from out the
wainscot
Such a sudden burst of cheering,
Such a squirt of strangled joy notes,
That all present burst out laughing;
'Twas our little Mess Gazeka,
'Twas our regimental bogy.
When the corps all look their
brightest,
Red mess jackets—spotless waist-
coats—
And the silver, dragged from boxes,
Gleams amid the piles of roses,
Then the Story-teller tells 'em ;
So our little Mess Gazeka
Hears the most appalling lies told,
Cannot bear it any longer,
And then off he goes in gruffles.
Hear him crickle in the wainscot 1
But the Mess Guest, glancing side-
ways,
Says in tones of awestruck wonder,
“What on earth 's that noise of
almonds,
Noise just like
almonds?”
And we all say, laughing lightly,
‘‘’TiS Our i. Mess Gazeka,
Pretty little Mess Gazeka.
You should see him drink his Bovril
Nine o'clock on Sunday mornings |
But he bites just something horrid,
So we keep him in the wainscot,
In the warm and quiet wainscot,
the taste of
That is why you hear him gruffle,
When he 's pleased he always gruffles,
'Tis a habit that he 's got there
In the wainscot of an evening.”
Then the Mess Guest, looking fur-
tive,
Talks of other things—of Battles,
Bullets, Ballets, Bandoleros—
Anything but what that noise was,
What that funny little noise was.
So the ever-changing years passed;
Comrades left or got promotion, -
But our little Mess Gazeka
Gruffled, as of yore, to laughter—
Speeches, Stories, Thin No Trumpers,
In the warm and quiet wainscot,
In the wainscot of an evening.
But old Father Time was watching
(Ah, those sands that keep on run-
ning !),
So at length our Mess Gazeka
Fell away where all the rest go—
Fell away without saluting,
Tumbled down into oblivion,
In the February cleaning,
In the scrubbing and the cleaning;
For the sideboard alteration
Slew our regimental bogy,
Killed our little Mess Gazeka.

pUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A ST. MARTIN'S LANE SUMMER.
REVIVAL of “THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON”
SINCE I saw him, last Bill Crichton
has gained in virility, and that is
what you want most on a desert
island. Mr. LYN HARDING has the
advantage of Mr. HARRY IRVING in
the physique that is essential to the
bucket business: He was perfect in
his capacity of butler, and next best
in the Second Act, where he is in the
chrysalis stage of transitional man-
hood, having ceased to be a mere
worm, and not yet blossomed out into
a winged god. He was least good as
“The Guv.” In his exalted position
he lacked the geniality that great
rulers can afford. His face never
relaxed even when he indulged in
romantic sentiment, and it was
here that his voice took on some-
thing of the portentousness of melo-
drama. Even in the dance there was
only a physical, not a mental, un-
bending. True, in the old life he had
always expressed the view that the
condescension of Lord Loam, shown
in the social entertainment of his
menials, had been subversive of dis-
|cipline and the right recognition | .
But |
of caste in the servants’ hall.
here on the island there was no ques-
tion of degrees of servitude. All
were equal, being alike immeasurably
removed from Mr. Crichton’s own
sphere. And, after all, it is incredi-
ble that a potentate so haughty and
aloof could have held his slaves in
such a state of sacrificial devotion.
As the Earl of Loam, Mr. ERIC
LEwis, though his manner smacks a
little of the best Harley Street tradi-
tions, escapes the rather too farcical
rotundity of the late Mr. KEMBLE's
inimitable methods. Miss MIRIAM
CLEMENTs cannot quite reproduce the
intellectual agility of Miss. IRENE
WANBRUGH, but she has a more femin-
ine charm. Miss HILDA TREveLYAN
is an adorable Tweeny.
Mr. GERALD DU MAURIER is ex-
cellent as ever. Miss SYRIL CAR-
Lisle and Miss MURIEL BEAUMONT
have lost nothing of their natural
grace; and Miss MARGARET FRASER's
clever performance as Fisher makes
one again regret the brevity of her
part. . - - -
It is late in the day to find a new
word of praise for this which is far
the best of Mr. BARRIE’s plays. The
last Act was the only one ever open
to serious attack, and I am certain
the author justified himself of the
conclusion which he is said to have
referred to another that came into
is head. . Women critics used to
protest against the snobbishness of
Lady Mary Lasenby. She ought, they
said, to have stuck to her second love.
But she had no choice in the matter.
Bill Crichton had too good a know-
ledge of the rules of “the game '' to
allow her to stay behind with him on
the island; and in London it would
have been more, impossible still for
him to, countenance the sacrifice. He
recognised with remarkable lucidity
of soul that, if one environment may
go far to make a man, another may
go equally far and with equal pro-
priety to unmake him. He was a
stickler for Nature in her primal
state, but also for the “second
Nature " that is evolved from habit

and prescription. A notable philo-
sopher, this Crichton, and gifted with
a curious taste for detachment.
If I were to hazard a criticism of
this delightful play it would be that
on a second view of it—with the
knowledge of what is coming when
the gun goes off—there seems to be a
certain air of factitiousness about the
general enthusiasm for the Simple
Life. I say nothing of the two pro-
tagonists or the parson; but if the
rest of them were so enlarged and in-
toxicated by the healthy activity of
their island picnic why should they
leap for joy at the prospect of re-
turning to the stuffy atmosphere of
Mayfair, above or below stairs? I
am sure there must have been a
reason, deep-rooted in the imbecility
of the race, and Mr. BARRIE could tell
it me if he chose, for he knows so
many good reasons for the stranges
things. O. S.

WEALTH WHILE YOU WAIT.
DEAR Mr. Punch,-‘‘L.C.C. saves
over £2,500,000.” This gratifying
headline greeted me the other day as
I opened my copy of The Daily Mail.
You can imagine my pride as a Lon-
doner, and my pleasure as a rate-
payerl And the whole thing is so
simple—simpler even than your own
idea of renaming the coinage. The
Council merely decided not to spend
certain sums of money which had
been estimated for various schemes.
Mr. Punch, why shouldn't I too save
like that ?
I have begun already. Last year I
estimated that a yacht such as
would really do me justice should
cost £5,000 a year, or, say, £150,000
capital. I didn't go in for it, so I
am now the richer by that amount.
And I hope to do much better
still in the near future. The
yacht will appear again on my
balance-sheet for this year, but
having saved £150,000 I can afford
to have one rather better equipped.
It would cost, say, £200,000. I shall
save that sum too. Then I should
like a racing stable. That could be
run comfortably on the interest from
£300,000, with an initial outlay of
£150,000. Altogether that will make
over three-quarters of a million saved
by next Christmas.
Now, can you tell me the best way
to invest this, or would you advise
me to wait another year or two, and
offer to pay off the National Debt?
Yours faithfully, RATEPAYER.

TELL ME, SQUOIRE, The Difference BETWEEN
WALKER I
WE live and learn, and doubtless it
will be news to many persons to find
that they have never really walked
at all. They have merely put one
foot before the other, which is a very
different thing. Walking is a self-
conscious accomplishment, only at-
tained after years of thoughtful
study at a desk. By the time a man
is sixty he is perhaps qualified to go
out and try his paces; but seldom
before.
Children wish to walk properly, but
we hastily do all we can to check
them and impose artifice upon them.
Hence they never walk again. They
get there, may be, but not by walk-
ing. .
Dr. Hookey, of Blisterville, Pa.,
who is perhaps the greatest walker in
the world, knows all about it, and
some of his knowledge has found its
way to one of the magazine pages,
next the picture of the woman who
suffers in silence, and above a spicy
serial story of semitic life.
According to Dr. HookEY, who is
introduced to English readers by
H. H. Diddle, M.B. (Camb.), the
walking in which we now indulge
must go. In its place will be rational
walking. Rational walking is done
with a bent knee and a body flopping
over it. By shuffling along in this
way you go farther and faster, and
are less tired. How very American
—to be always going farther and
faster | Most of the American latter-
day gift-horses (which we have got
into the useful if irritating habit of
examining in the mouth) have borne
the same recommendation.
But suppose one does not want to
walk any faster or go any farther,
and supposing one is not tired as it
is, what then? Are we still to bend
our knees and totter forward through
life, or may we hold ourselves erect
once more, and try to look like inde-
pendent gentlemen? If we do, says
Dr. HookEY, we shall be defying
science and practical wisdom. And
the example set is of the American
Indian, that first authority on the
needs of city life. For if an Indian
bends his knee to shuffle over broken
ground how reasonable that we who
walk on smooth pavements should do
the same !
Never mind, it is good magazine-
page filling.

happier ending than is at present promised for Mr.

moves, are up against the Knighthood of Nonconformity,
and stale mate is threatened. But the CASTLEs have a
simpler task. They move, as become Castles, only
in a straight line, and they usually get there. The
ten life-problems in their book, mostly variations on the
theme in which White has to play and mate in two or
three moves, are worked out with considerable ingenuity,
especially those in which White wins his mate (and the
inevitable orange-blossoms) at the point of his trusty
rapier. In this age of non-corrosive ink and Hague
Conferences it is refreshing to turn—particularly when
led by guides so attractive—to the stirring days when in
most hands the sword was still mightier than the pen,
and when even WILL SHAKSPEARE learnt to be “a
butcher of a silk button.”

standable enough, but I can find no very cogent

stops short at one of the sudden deaths, and, excepting
that the pace is different, it is exactly as if a bad toss at

for the complete petrification of the whole show. Just

The Westminster Gazette, commenting upon the

“Even a bard, when he is writing in prose, ought to observe the
rules of arithmetic. For, conscious as we are that in the recent by-

one of them that the Kipling candidate was returned by nine to one.”
We have worked this out, and find that our genial
contemporary has not given Mr. KIPLING so sound a
lesson in arithmetic as it might have done. Its esti-

the proportion, if nine-tenths of the Liberals crossed
over, must in any case be more than nine to one, and
might conceivably run to within a fraction of nineteen

elementary calculation, The Westminster Gazette
should have weakened, by a possible fifty per cent. and
more, the force of the lesson in arithmetic which it
administered to the peccant bard.

MORE ILLUSTRIOUS LETTER WRITERS.
' [Being an intelligent anticipation of further
journalistic enterprise.] r
WE are rejoiced to learn that the
electrical condition of the inter-
national atmosphere caused by the
disclosure of the President of the
Swiss REPUBLIC’s letter to Lord
Esher has been happily dispelled.
It will be remembered that the Editor
of The Times recently stated in the
Observer considers that the incident
may profitably be considered closed.
It is generally believed that the story
of this deplorable interchange of in-
discreet correspondence would never
have become public but for Mr.
SYDNEY Buxton's unhappy weakness
for talking of his epistolary triumph.
A quick-witted woman soon puts two
and two together.

LLOYD - GEORGE admits that he
showed the message to Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL; but that does not explain
the currency of the rumour. Cherchez
la femme must be, as of old, our
comment.
The statement made by Mr.
MoRLEY in the House of Commons
on Friday as to the nature of the
communication he had received from
the TsAR has practically ended the
columns of that sensitive
journal that it was widely
known that the President
of the Swiss REPUBLIC
had addressed a letter to
Lord Esher commenting
adversely on the kitchen
ranges used in Windsor
Castle, and demanding
that the correspondence
should be published. The
excitement caused in the
ironmongery trade has been
intense, but it has been
happily allayed by the
. statement made in
the House of Lords on
Thursday last by Lord
ESHER. Lord Esher ad-
mitted that he had received
a letter from the President
about three weeks ago, but
that the contents were of
an entirely pacific char-
acter. It was, in fact, posi-
tively jocular in character.
He had shown it to Mr.
BERNARD SHAw, as the
creator of Captain Blunt-
schli, who agreed with him
that it possessed no politi-
cal significance, and he had
answered it in a similar
tone. Lord LANSDOWNE,
on behalf of the Opposi-
tion, stated that he was
perfectly satisfied with
Lord Esher's explanation,
and the incident may now
be regarded as closed.
In spite of all contradic-
tions, official and other-
wise, The Observer is in a

painful excitement created
in Paris and St. Peters-
burg by the sensational
article which appeared in
The Times. It was there
alleged that the TsAR had
written to Mr. MoRLEY
offering to make him Shah
of PERSIA if he would con-
sent to substitute the
Russian for the English
language throughout the
Indian Empire. It was
further stated that Mr.
MoRLEY had promised to
give the proposal his best
consideration. Mr. MoRLEY
briefly explained that he
had received a letter, not
from the Emperor of
RUssia, but from the Em-
peror of the SAHARA (M.
JAcQUEs LEBAUDY), but
that its contents were of a
purely personal character.
He had not replied to it,
and did not intend to. Mr.
F. E. SMITH congratulated
Mr. MoRLEY on having re-
frained from the risk of
speaking disrespectfully of
the Equator, and Mr.
GRAYson has withdrawn
his motion proposing that
Mr. MoRLEY should be de-
ported to the Andaman
Islands. We understand
that M. LEBAUDY's letter
was of rem a r k a b le
piquancy, and contained a
proposal that Mr. MoRLEY
should write his (M.
LEBAUDY's) life on the
position to state on the
best possible authority, inferential
and direct, that the epoch-making let-
ter recently sent by the Emperor
MENELIK to Mr. SYDNEY BUxTon is
of a wholly facetious character, its
principal point being a play upon
words, connecting the name of the
Emperor of Abyssinia with the
operation of moistening a large num-
ber of stamps. While agreeing with
The Times that it is of the highest
consequence that Postmasters-
General should not be on friendly
Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE have not been
made public; but The Times is un-
doubtedly right in clamouring for the
imprisonment of that Minister for
not only receiving the message, but
aggravating his offence by replying
to it at the nation's expense, and
giving the telegraph boy twopence for
waiting. These are grave scandals.
As to the missive Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE
very suspiciously refused to divulge
its words, but the keyhole expert of
Printing House Square has dis-
same scale as his memoir
of Mr. GLADstone. In conclusion he
complained bitterly of Mr. Hichens's
praise of the desert, which had
caused an influx of undesirable aliens
into his dominions.
The Times draws attention in a
leading article of extraordinary bit-
terness to the letter recently received
at his private residence in Battersea
by Mr. John BURNs from Mr. WIL-
LIAM HARRIs, the Sausage King,
offering free sausages to every clerk
in the Board of Trade for one day

Times says, a concealed attempt to
interfere with a Government Office,
and cannot be too severely criticised.
Mr. BURNs's defence is that, just as
a cat may look at a king, so may a
Cabinet Minister receive a letter from
His culpability begins when he
deals unwisely with that letter. In
his own case he showed it at once to
Mr. Asquith, who laughed, and ad-
vised him to put it in the w.p.b.
This he had done. None the less, as
the vigilant Times says, a grand his-
toric tradition is being tampered
with, and it behoves all of us to be
on our guard against abuses.
It is understood that the rage and
mortification of those Cabinet Minis-
ters who have not been the recipients
of letters from crowned heads furnish
a pathetic sight. Mr. GLADstone,
indeed, makes no effort to hide his
chagrin ; but Lord ELGIN, on the
other hand, attempts to laugh it off.

LETTERS FROM FATHER.
By R*DºD K*PL**G.
[It is possible that this letter was intended for one of our daily
contemporaries. It was, however, duly addressed to us, and we
publish it just as we received it, with a full sense of the honour done
to us by the distinguished politician and poet-traveller who wrote it..]
WHERE 's the verse that SHAKSPEARE wrote
Once three hundred years ago?
Every lodger has a vote,
Since the Law decreed it so.
Some are better, some are worse:
That's the way with bits of verse.
Octagon and hexagon;
. Man and manners makyth man.
Lo, the lights of Babylon
Shine upon the selfsame plan.
They are red, and you are green—
What the dickens can it mean?
Nineveh 's an old abode
Mostly marked by heaps of dust.
Lay the long lance on the road,
Since I say you shall, you must.
Raisers, Tsars, and Emperors
Eat what any one devours.
Multiply the breadth by length:
When it 's done you 've got a square.
Then you come and try your strength
Till Oblivion cries “Beware ’’
So you tramp the Wilderness.
That 's the answer: can't you guess?
I am about to speak of England and those whose mis-
fortune it is to live there. I speak of England with
respect. I have tried to do what I can for the country,
but everybody can realise that the efforts of one man
must be useless—especially when the rest are living in
an iodoform-scented fog of sentimental miasma. For
two years they 've been living there, and it is not dis-
pelled yet. Men of the Blood despise them. You can
hear South Africa shouting her scorn from Table
Mountain, while Australia responds with derision from
the banks of the Wagga-Wagga. Wherever there is a
Colony the doors have been shut and bolted and barred.
Even the black man of the remoter Bush curls a con-
temptuous lip when you tell him about Empire. Only
yesterday I happened to be speaking to a young Fijian
about the Motherland. I dwelt on her glories: her
steamers, her locomotives, her motor-cars, her bayonets,
her big guns, her ports, and her Imperial politicians.
“Me no eatee,” he remarked, and the conversation fell
flat. That is what the Government has made of Eng-
ſand in two short years. To-day a Canadian took me
to Canada. He was laughing all the way. “Don’t you
see,” he said, “that you 're not in it? Size, acreage—
just think of it. Frenchmen, too, lots of them.
Montreal, Toronto, and Quebec, can't you see? No,
you're not in it.” It was the password. I bowed my
head. The truth couldn't be contested. That, again,
is the fault of the Government.
“The ‘Kentis', Gazette and Canterbury Press' has a
LAGER CIRCULATION
than any other Kentish newspaper published eastward of Ashford.”
We are not blown up with either beer or pride, dear
reader. We merely state facts,
PEDAGOGY UP-TO-DATE.
O SIMPLE and crude were the notions I had
When I was a callow and green undergrad
And simplest of all were the thoughts that were mine
On how to excel in the pedagogue line.
I fancied—like many Oxonian geese–
One should study the culture of Rome and of Greece;
I dreamt of the grove where Calliope sings,
And my heart it would pant for Pierian springs.
And when I had gathered such lore as I could,
And flung o'er my shoulders a bachelor's hood,
I thought, in my folly, I'd nothing to do
But set up as Master and teach what I knew.
Rude, rude was my waking ! I soon was to find
My notions were ages and ages behind :
The hours I had spent in achieving a taste
Por classical culture were nothing but waste.
What was Oedipus Rear 2 What was PERIcLEs' speech?
I should have been studying how one should teach.
For What you impart doesn't much matter now :
The only significant thing is the How.
I should have been busy researching. I ought
To have measured the length of an infantile thought,
To have marked the effect on the cardia's action
Induced by an effort in simple subtraction.
I should have been weighing the toddlers before
And after a lesson in nursery lore,
And known what they lost, to a scrupulous gramme,
In learning the story of Mary's pet lamb.
I ought to have studied with close application
The full psychologic effect of dictation; º:
And the chemico-physical change that ensues
When an infant is learning that four is two twos.
Ah me! Can I wonder if men who have wrung
From Science the secrets of teaching the young
Arrive at the seats of the mighty, while I,
A mere scholar at best, am a thing to pass by ?

“Though it is hard to believe that Sir Henry could
have given a superior rendering of The Bells, it is safe
to say that the enthusiasm of any audience could never
have been surpassed even when the ‘Chief ' was in his
prime at the Lyceum.”—Cambridge Daily News.
“Mr. J. M. Barrie's play, ‘The Little Minister,’ was produced for the
first time in Germany at Vienna last night.”—Yorkshire Erening Neurs.
According to Mr. Punch's Special Military Corre-
spondent, the KAISER had written to one of the Austrian
Ministers asking him, as a friend, to hand over Vienna
to Germany. In these circumstances a better play
could not have been chosen with which to celebrate the
occasion.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PEACEFUL PERSUASION.
A DAY IN THE LIFE of AN
ENTHUSIAST.
9 A.M.–There seems to have been
a great meeting at the Queen's
Hall yesterday to protest against
Asquith's dastardly robbery. I wish
I had been there. I see that a Mr.
HAROLD SMITH, of Liverpool, “ad-
vised everybody, before dealing with
a tradesman, to find out whether or
not he was in favour of the Licensing
Bill.” That is an excellent idea.
To-day, at any rate, nobody who is
not prepared to fight the Bill to the
death shall receive my money.
10 A.M.–An awkward dispute with
the 'bus conductor, who refused to
say definitely whether or not he was
in favour of the Time Limit. His
actual words, “Ho yus, I don't
think,’’ were indecisive. I gave him
my twopence with the greatest re-
luctance, but remembered afterwards
that he was only an agent of the
General Omnibus Company. They
are the people whose views I should
have ascertained. This is very an-
noying. What am I to do? For all
I know they may by to-morrow be
actually spending my twopence on
propaganda in favour of the Bill
Shall I get off? I suppose I. . . .
Of course I'm very late as it
is. . . . They may be against it, after
all. . . . Still. . . . Well, I'll stay on
now, but I really must be firmer next
time. |
10.30 A.M.–It is extraordinary how
quickly crowds collect. Foreigners'
visiting our metropolis have often
noticed this, I believe. All I did
was to ask the paper-boy what his
views were upon the Licensing
Question. . . .
11 A.M.–The Office Boy says he is
in favour of the Licensing Bill. Im-
pertinence 1 I have told him to be
so kind as to dust the Encyclopaedia
and carry it downstairs. I'll show
him.
Noon.—On second thoughts I'll
have the Encyclopaedia up here, after
all. That boy doesn't get enough to
do. The result is that he spends his
time imbibing pernicious trash from
the Radical papers.
1.30 P.M.–My difficulties seem to
increase. Mr. HARold SMITH may
be able to carry out his ideas in
Liverpool all right, but London must
be different. I went to my usual
barber's to havo my hair cut. Re-
membering my weakness on the 'bus
I marched straight into the shop and
asked for Mr. SUTTON,
“It is extremely important that I

should see Mr. SUTTON at once,” I
said.
“Certainly, sir,” said the man;
“but who is Mr. SUTTON ?”
I pointed to Sutton's Toilet Soap:
“The person to whom that belongs,”
I said with dignity. “I wish to
know what he thinks of the Licensing
IBill.’’
“Oh, but there is no Mr. SUTTON
actually,” said the man, with a
smile. “It's just—well, a trade
term. That soap, I may tell you
in confidence, is made from a special
recipe. It leaves no odour, , is
smooth to the skin, lathers freely,
and * >
I walked angrily into the saloon
and took the only empty chair.
“Hair cut,” I growled.
“Yes, sir. How would you like it
cut, sir? ''
“Without prejudice,” I replied.
2 P.M.–Lunch. I am going to
take it for granted that the proprietor
of my restaurant is against this con-
founded Bill. I can't go through
another scene until I have had some-
thing to eat. After all, he 's a
Licensed Victualler, so he 's bound to
be. But I am undecided about my
waiter. He always agrees with me
whatever I say, and I am sure I
could never find out his real opinion
on the Time Limit. Perhaps it
would be safer not to give him his
twopence to-day.
2.30 P.M.–Coming out after lunch,
and feeling that I really had done
something for the Cause this time, a
beastly motor 'bus splashed me from
head to foot. That is the sort of 'bus
that would be in favour of the
Licensing Bill. I was certainly in-
discreet this morning in coming up
by one.
2.35 P.M.–Just seen myself in the
glass. Heavens ! A clean collar at
Once.
3 P.M.–I am beginning to feel a
little sympathy for Passive Resisters.
It is certainly very hard to know
what is the right thing to do in
matters of conscience. I went to
“T. R. PLUMMETT '' for a collar.
Directly the assistant saw me he
guessed what I had come for.
“Size, sir? '' he asked.
“I want Mr. T. R. PLUMMETT,” I
said.
“He never comes up now, sir. He
lives at Streatham.”
That was awkward; but still it was
refreshing to find that he was an in-
dividual and not a company. With
great difficulty I got his telegraphic
address. (I forget what lie I told,
but one doesn't stick at that on be-
half of the Cause.) Then I went
into the Post Office and wrote out a
telegram. “PLUMMETT, Fancivest,
Streatham. Are you in favour of
Licensing Bill? Reply paid."
And then it suddenly struck me—
I was actually dealing with the very
Government which had brought in
the Bill! I was giving them a shil-
ling, part of which would help to pay
the salary of the arch - robber
Asquith ! I tore the hated thing up
at once.
3.10 P.M.–I don’t know what to
do. (I wish I had Mr. HAROLD
SMITH, of Liverpool, here. He would
know.) PLUMMETT isn't on the tele-
phone; and, if he were, the Tele-
phone Company might not be against
the Licensing Bill. I can't face the
Office Boy in this collar. I can't go
home for a clean one, because I
daren't take a 'bus, and don't like
the idea of walking both ways. The
only thing left is to go home
altogether.
10 P.M.–Let me hurry over the
rest of this awful day. I have eaten
nothing since lunch. Not knowing
where my housekeeper gets the food
from, I simply daren't. I have seen
no evening paper. For all I know
Mr. HAROLD SMITH, of Liverpool, may
have made another speech; how ter-
rible to think that I may have missed
it ! I am out of tobacco. Supposing
John Cotton turns out to be in
favour of the Time Limit, how can I
ever smoke his mixture again 2 I
can't write letters because of the post-
office trouble. Well, I shall just
read The Daily Telegraph once more,
and then I shall go to bed. At least
I am safe there.
11 P.M.–In bed. A horrible
thought. Is my newsagent against
the Licensing Bill? Oh, HAROLD,
HAROLD, spare me my breakfast-table
Telegraph at least !
MIDNIGHT.-A happy thought at
last. “Many of the clergy approve
of the Time Limit.” Then I shan’t
go to church again. Ah, now I can
sleep peacefully. A. A. M.
“The Bill said that a two-thirds majority

anachronism; either the Press should be

eleven o'clock.”—The Morning Post.

the examination standard was too

who will only have to pass an ex-
ceedingly simple examination, and to
whom only quite easy wars would be
entrusted.

I CAN'T 'ARDLY Move AGAINST 'EM' "
f : IT.”
THE LATEST CRAZE.
EveRYBoDY is talking about “IT,”
just as five or six months ago
everybody talked about Diabolo.
“IT '' has taken London by storm
“IT '’ can be had in three qualities—
MILD, MEDIUM, or FULL.
The “MILD '' is particularly recom-
mended by the Faculty.
Government Offices have adopted
“IT.” Schools are taking “IT "up.
WHAT IS ‘‘IT ''2 : AH !
Listen to what Mr. BIRRELL
says: —“I had “IT ' in the mild
quality for some time, and wish for
no other kind.”
Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON writes:–
'' If there was ever any doubt (which
I do not admit) as to ‘It’s ’ desira-
bility, (odious word'), the very fact
that doctors as a class give it a warm
welcome must, one would think,
dispel that doubt from the mind of
the ordinary sane man.”
Many people who have not got

AND THEY will GET “IT.''
The stock is absolutely unlimited.
BUT WHAT IS ‘‘IT ''2

Both, we fancy, will recommend

For those who have found the
answer to the above we append the
following simple facts and precau-
tions, reprinted from the contem-
porary Press, by observing which
anyone can avoid the prevailing com-
plaint. All you have to do is to
remember that—
Influenza germs can only exist in a
vitiated atmosphere. Always ride on
the outside of omnibuses.
Cold winds and chill lessen the
vitality. Avoid all unnecessary ex-
posure.
Sleep with bedroom windows as
wide open as possible.
Above all things, carefully avoid
night air.
Damp holds the microbes. Do not
go out in the wet.
The recent rain will do much to
clear London of the epidemic, for
which a dry and dusty February is
responsible.
Keep the system well fortified by
a generous diet which will enable it
to resist infection.
Influenza attacks the well-to-do
most, especially those who over-eat.
Avoid all strong scents which irri-
tate the mucous membrane.
Take plenty of eucalyptus.
Keep cheerful. Determine that
you will not be ill and you won't be.
Go to bed at once.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtEACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March 9.
—With the exception of one quarter,
red-cushioned Chamber thronged. In
spite of recent recruiting, viewed with
distrust by HUGH LEA, the muster
of Liberal Peers at epochs of excite-
ment is ludicrously small by com-
parison with the array opposite.
Perhaps it was desire to display
studious indifference to question at
issue that accounted for absence of
his Majesty's Ministers. When pro-
ceedings opened only ELGIN and
PortsMoUTH in places. To them
presently entered Tweed MoUTH,
smiling cheerily as he looked round
the galleries crowded with Peeresses
out for a Roman holiday, not with-
out hope that somebody's head would
be cut off before teatime.
PRINCE OF WALEs on front Cross
Bench. On his left hand RosebERY.
Steps of Throne thronged with Privy
Councillors and elder sons of Peers.
Undistinguished Commoners peopled
the pens by the Bar, jostled, each
other in the inadequate space allotted
to them in Gallery above it.' Wedged
in among the long line of Peeresses
sat a group of Foreign Ministers.
What had they come out for to
see? Well, it was TweedMoUTH
shaken by The Times. The GERMAN
EMPEROR had posted to him a private
letter. Instead of writing across it
“Not known at the Admiralty '' and
returning it through Dead Letter
Office, First Lord opened, read, and
replied. Had even talked of the
correspondence in private conversa-
tion which someone betrayed. Pierc-
ing eyes, regarding incident from
Printing House Square, fiercely
snapped at pretence of personal cor-
respondence. What had really hap-
pened, they clearly saw, was that
GERMAN EMPEROR, intent on baulk-
ing British determination to main-
tain supremacy on the seas, had
privily written to First Lord of
Admiralty, with design of modifying
our Navy Estimates.
“An absolutely insane inference,”
said RoseBERY, going to root of
matter in a brief speech contributed
to conversation between Tweed-
MoUTH and LANsdow NE. “Aren't
we, as a nation, making ourselves
ridiculous?” he asked. Noble Lords
murmured assent, and turned with
almost ostentatious interest to con-
sider two small departmental Bills
that constituted legislative business
of the Sitting.
“What I feel about it,” said the
Member for Sark, as we strolled back
TRAgic Scene AT THE ADMIRALTY.
(The figure marked with a cross is Lord Tw-dim-th.)
to the Commons, “is that by com-
parison with the Germans we 've
been made to look exceedingly small.
You remember a little episode in the
career of ST. John BRodrick when
he was at the War Office? The
GERMAN EMPEROR held a big review of
his troops. On the appointed day there
rode on to the field a warlike figure
disguised in the uniform of the Surrey
Imperial Yeomanry. It was the
British Secretary of State for War.
Here was the pick of the German
Army conveniently assembled. The
latest resources of civilisation in the
way of arms and men were displayed.
The warlike instincts of the Surrey
warrior, trained to highest stage of
perfection, would take all in at a
glance. Scanning the scene with
assumed intention of ascertaining
where the refreshment tent was
situated, he would master all the
points of the German military
system, and would naturally utilise
his knowledge to the advantage of
the Army under his control.
“Did any portion of the German
Press hysterically denounce the
German War Office for permitting
the incident? Were Ministers hotly
interrogated in the Reichstag? No,
sir. The foreign visitor was politely
treated, and before he dismounted
was photographed free of charge. It
would be unpatriotic to say that the
Germans are a bigger people than we.
Certainly upon occasion they show
they have more common sense.”
Business done.—In Lords and
Commons the bubble floating over
GERMAN EMPEROR’s letter to Tweed-
MoUTH is pricked.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—
The event of the day, striking and
memorable, happened unexpectedly.
Usual long list of dull questions gone
through, Members with one accord
strolled forth to chat, write letters,
read papers, or otherwise pass the
slow hours before Division bell
clanged. House in Committee on
Navy Estimates. Prospect of some
hours pecking at details. PRINCE
ARTHUR's appearance at Table only
slightly stirred scanty audience.
Wanted to know whether it is the
fact that towards end of year 1911
Germany will be going one better
than Great Britain in respect of ships
of Dreadnought class?
Neither in voice nor manner did
Asquith indicate exceptional import-
ance of statement he was about to
make in reply to this question.
In low conversational tone attuned
to desolate appearance of Benches
he laid down the principle that
Great Britain must maintain un-
assailable supremacy at sea, to
which end the Two-Power standard
was desirable. As to the German
programme on paper, threatening by
November or December, 1911, to

have thirteen Dreadnoughts against
twelve British, if there be apparent
possibility of its being carried out
“we should feel it our duty to pro-
vide, and we should provide, not only
for a sufficient number of ships but
for such a date of laying down those
ships that the superiority of the
Germans the #: hon. gentleman
foreshadows will not be an actual
fact.”
By this time the House aware of
importance of the occasion, the
momentousness of decision an-
nounced. By its naval programme
Germany, designedly or not, had
thrown down the glove; Asquith on
behalf of the nation had picked it
up. Done so quietly too. No blare of
trumpets, no beat of drum, no de-
fiant attitudinising. For once in a
way plain business manner became
at a grave crisis dramatic by reason
of its simplicity and directness.
Business done.—AsquitH pledges
himself to see to it that Britannia
continues to rule the waves.

pearance on Paper of question stand-
ing in name of MitchELL-THoMson.

State for Colonies whether his atten-
tion has been called to statement in
the Report on Southern Nigeria for
1906, to the effect that the only out-
come of the present legislation on
game preservation has been “to limit
the shooting of a few bond-fide
European sportsmen.”
This the first intimation the House
has received of existence of the out-
rages. Strong desire to know when,
where, and by whom the European
sportsmen were shot? Something
odiously cynical in suggestion that
stops short of absolutely prohibiting
the practice, merely talking of limit-
ing it.
Members recall with a shudder the
fact that during his recent visit to
Africa the Under Secretary for the
Colonies, a representative bond-fide
European sportsman, got a little
shooting at big game. Happily it
was in another part of the continent.
That a mere accident. Duty might

THE BARD'S SPOT AND SPOTS BARRED.
AN overflow meeting has just been
held, under the chairmanship of Mr.
BALFour, to attempt definitely to de-
cide upon the site for the proposed
SHAKSPEARE Memorial. Among those
present were Lord Esher, Mr. BEER-
BohM TREE, Mr. BERNARD SHAw, Mr.
SIDNEY LEE, Mr. BELLOC, Mr. G. K.
CHESTERTON, and the Surveyor of the
London County Council.
The Chairman in his opening re-
marks said that everyone present
must agree with him that a
SHAKSPEARE Memorial was an abso-
lute necessity to Londoners, given as
they were to playgoing, that highest
of intellectual pastimes. Every day
of his life he was more amazed at the
number of theatres, all of them
doubtless—he was no reader of news-
papers, and could not therefore
speak, with authority—all of them
doubtless busy with one or other of
the Immortal Bard's masterpieces.
(Mild sensation.)
The present idea, he said, was to
erect the SHAkspeaRE Memorial in
Portland Place. Why, no one knew,
unless it was for the convenience of
American visitors to the Langham.
They were met to-day to see if they
could not devise a better scheme.
For himself he would suggest that
Portland Place was absurd when
you had Stratford Place close by.
(Cheers.)
The Chairman then read a letter
from Miss MARIE CoreLLI on the sub-
ject. London, she considered, did
not deserve a ShakspeaRE Memorial
at all. What it wanted was a
statue either to Mr. GEORGE
EdwardEs or to the author of Dear
Old Charlie. That was what London
really wanted. This whole scheme
was a device on the part of a lot of
literary men to (Roars of in-
dignation.)
Mr. BEERBoIIM TREE said he should
be delighted to provide a site for the
SHAkspeaRE Memorial on the roof of
His Majesty's Theatre. That obvi-
ously was the fitting place for it, and
he was astonished that he had not
been approached before.
Lord Esher said he was very sorry
but he could not support the project
for taking down the Duke of York's

column and substituting SHAKSPEARE,
although he was convinced that there
was not a man in Germany, from the
EMPEROR downwards, who would not
be glad to know that the Duke had
been deposed. (Panic.)
Mr. G. K. ChestERTON said the
Memorial, in his opinion, should be
on a vast scale. He went on amid
cheers to offer to give sittings to the
sculptor.
The Surveyor of the , London
County Council urged upon the meet-
ing the importance of selecting the
waste ground in the Strand where
Holywell Street used to be, which
at present is used only during General
Elections to make known the results.
He pointed out how central it was
and how eligible. Not only would
there be ample room for the
Memorial, but ample room for the
public to waltz round it.
Mr. SIDNEY LEE agreed. He said
that he had seen that morning an
eloquent article by a gentleman who
first said that he was too humble
himself to make any proposition, and
then went on to propose that the
Memorial be erected in Hyde Park,
by the side of the Zuy—the Ser-
pentine. For his own part he thought
that a poor suggestion for many
reasons, one being that there were no
deer in Hyde Park. (Laughter.)
Besides, it was too far away. They
wanted SHAkspeaRE in their very
midst—all among the men in the
street. (Cheers.) Incidentally he
would say that the Life of the Poet
could be had on very reasonable
terms at any bookshop. It was no
use looking at a memorial of the
author unless you had first read his
life.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw ridiculed the
whole affair. Why raise another
memorial to SHAKSPEARE 2 he asked.
There was an excellent statue in
Leicester Square, opposite the Em-
pire. Nothing could be more suit-
able than that. Let the people save
their money until someone worthy of
a memorial on the proposed scale
should have qualified for it by pass-
ing away—he would not use so vulgar
and absurd a word as dying.
At this stage of the proceedings
Mr. BELLoc started singing the Mar-
seillaise, and the meeting broke up
in some confusion.

A PLAIN TALE FROM THE
HILLS.
THE Anglo-Indian novelist has
much to answer for. He has even
corrupted the untravelled innocence
of some of our dramatic critics.
Nothing short of the hottest curry
and spice will serve to content their
jaded palates. And so when Captain
JoHN KENDALL, ex-gunner, with many
years of service in India, produces
a plain unvarnished tale from the
hills, here and there you find the
ingenuous protest—“This is not KIP-
LING: this is commonplace.” Well,
one, if not more, of these remarks is
true of most things in life, of which
the Stage is never tired of professing
itself to be the Mirror. And I think
that thanks are due to Captain
KENDALL for correcting, in a very
quiet unassertive way, our florid
notions of the Orient, and showing
that even in an Indian hill-station
the average Briton remains incurably
British.
A very pleasant humour runs
through the play; not scattered in-
discriminately all over the dialogue,
but deftly distributed among the
characters that have a congenital
aptitude for its exhibition.
There are interludes of compara-
tive dulness, but these may be ex-
plained by the artistic honesty
which distinguished between probable
and improbable channels of cynicism.
The author knows his atmosphere too
well to indulge a flattering estimate
of regimental intelligence. His
soldier-men may be a little too near
the angels in point of altruism, but in
their mental outlook they are never
unwarrantably spirituels. And they
have the advantage of being drawn
from life, and not from the maga-
zines. Any one of them would
have bitterly resented the imputation
of being a hero.
The type is not, of course, a stage
tradition, and Mr. RUDGE HARDING,
who played the laconic Captain
Smith, had little enough precedent
to go upon. He acted conscientiously,
but did not quite succeed in covering
up the traces of careful coaching.
One felt that even his manners had
been got by heart. Mr. ViviaN
GILBERT, again, has still something
to learn about the affable assurance
of our subalterns. But if these two
did the author something less than
justice, Miss MARIE ILLINGTON, as
the match-making Mrs. Bill, may be
said to have enhanced the excellence
of his humour by personal qualities
of her own. For the rest, Mr.
GARDEN as her worse half; Mr.
HoLMEs-GoRE (with eye-glass) as the
Colonel; and Miss BEATRICE TERRY
as a young thing with two minds,
were all admirably at their ease.
It is, perhaps, a defect in the play
that certain things essential to its
development occur off the stage and
have to be set out in retrospective
dialogue. I do not refer to tiger-
shoots and punitive expeditions, for
which the accommodation at the
Court would be inadequate. But I
feel that we ought to have been
allowed to see with our own eyes
something of the changes that were
going on inside Mabel's adaptable
heart during the period between
Captain Smith's departure and his
death, and again between his death

and resurrection. However, the
author may well plead the unam-
bitious brevity of his scheme.
The interest of the story, by the
way, was appreciably modified, for all
but first-nighters, by the revelations
of the critics. There should be an
article in the code of professional pro-
priety forbidding the betrayal of plots
on the day after. To give the secret
away before the first night is regarded
as an act of infamy; yet the distinc-
tion is almost negligible.
In a review written by one of
those critics who made the discovery
that Mr. KIPLING was not the author
of this slight comedy, I have read that
it “smelt abominably of the theatre.”

subtle odour at the first time of

stage construction. But I am con-
fident that Captain KENDALL will liv
down the flattery of that review, as
he will also live down the initial dis-
advantage under which he labours of
having already achieved success in
another field of art. The British
public resents the suspicion of such
duplicity. But I would wager some-
thing round and large that he will

SITTING TOO TIGHT.
DR. Istvan BAcu (we hope we
have his name correctly), of Temes-
var, Hungary, according to the
papers, attributes, most of the phy-
sical evils of modern civilisation to
our excessively sedentary life. Long
ago, also, KINGSLEY maintained that
“ of sitting, as of all other carnal
pleasures, cometh satiety at the last.”
Stimulated by such high authori-
ties, an Anti-Sitting League has
sprung into existence, and its mem-
bers intend to conduct an aggressive
propaganda.
Among the first objects of their
attack will be the Mother of Parlia-
ments herself, on the ground that
the sittings of the House are need-
lessly long, and the Sessions like-
wise. M.P.'s will in future be
allowed only to stand for their re-
spective constituencies, and not to sit
or to lie on their behalf. ,
Perpetrators of the Postcard Smile
will be severely diseouraged from
bestowing further “sittings " , on
photographers. Young (or middle-
aged) ladies, who offend against this
rule will have to go back to school
until the smile wears off. .
Able-bodied individuals who retain
their seats in crowded District trains
while we are strap-hanging are to be
taken back to the station whence
they started and there suffer the
utmost penalty of the law.

spectators who sit and shout at each

. . . . THE hustler need not be a
noisy and feverish person. The old
American hustler (derived from the
onomatopoeic word “ostler,” which
records the sound made by a man
who is rubbing down a horse) was of
that type—always “on the bound,”
always loud, always feverish, ob-
streperous—or, as some humourists
say, obstropolous—bullying and im-
patient. But this type of hustler is
passing away. The true and nobler
type is to be found not only amongst
adults but amongst what Mr.
PETER KEARY—himself a master of
the art—so charmingly calls “kid-
dies.” Perhaps the most perfect ex-
ample of the infantile hustler is to
be found in the American child.
Thus Mrs. Rogers, writing in the
current number of the Atlantic
Monthly, gives a delicious picture of
“an elaborately dressed American
baby of six, entirely unattended,
walking into a huge hotel dining-
room where her parents had lived for
years, and ordering “Devilled crabs
and pink ice-cream ' for her dinner,”
which she actually ate amidst the
enraptured glances of the guests and
waiters. . But American children
have immense advantages over their
cis-Atlantic brothers and sisters.
Here, for example, parents do not
live for years in huge hotel dining-
rooms. They move from place to
place, from room to room, thus
acquiring a feverishness entirely
alien from the calm tranquillity of the
cultured American hustler. Still this
type is not altogether unknown in our
midst. For example, I know one of
the greatest hustlers in London. But
he is a man of the stillest and
quietest demeanour, low - voiced,
leisurely and patient, with sleek hair,
a pathetic smile, and an eye like a
kind boot button. For the last ten
years his income has never been less
than £10,000, and yet he seldom goes
anywhere without a copy of the bijou
edition of Dr. Robertson Nicoll's
Ten Minute Sermons. He knows
each man's business and each man's
capacity. He has written down in
plain figures the value of each man
in his firm. I imagine that the
hustler of the future will be a man
of this austere yet lovable nature.

We do not need many hustlers in
the world, and we cannot expect to

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN a young beauty publicly announces in a ball-
room that she must find a husband before midnight (or
else, by the terms of a will, just come to hand, she will
lose a fine heritage), and then and there holds an
auction and knocks herself down to the most likely
bidder—that 's not a bad start for a romance. So
thought the authors of Colonel Kate (METHUEN), those
two brilliant Irish sisters who take the composite name
of K. L. MontgomeRY; and they give you no chance of
getting your breath again till half an hour after the
finish. If ever you are tempted to pause it is only when
you want to probe some mystery, such as that which
shrouds the politics of Lord Lovat, or the morals of the
lady of “the Taffety Parlour.” In a dozen lines these
clever writers can conjure up an atmosphere of obscurity
which Mr. HENRY JAMEs would be proud to produce in
as many hundreds. As in an earlier novel of theirs,

wishes to enjoy a clever and delightful book, I cordially
commend The Heart of a Child (HUTCHINson).
An attractive preliminary note is sounded in Mr.
GEORGE BIRMINGHAM's narrative of The Bad Times
(METHUEN). It is a dedication in verse to Sir HoRACE
PLUNKETT, an Irishman who has done more for the
welfare of his country than any Secretary of State or
any agglomeration of Nationalist Members. The Bad
Times recorded happened in Ireland during the plenitude
of the power of the Land League. The reference sug- ||
gests polemical writing. I confess that reading the book
leaves me in pleasing doubt whether the author is a
Home Ruler or a Unionist. What is certain is that he
knows the country, the period, and the people of whom
he writes. The chapters present a picture gallery of

There never was a couple of

Mr. Edward NoBLE, if I may

knows her storms and her calms,
and he knows the people who live

put down on paper all that this

know, and he can paint character;

he is not a very good hand at a
I(idderminster's heart, and lives (or
will, when Kiddie gets the marquisate) at Buckminster,
the family seat, which is several sizes larger and consider-
ably less squalid than our alley. When she married
Kiddie, The Comet said that her father was Mr. James
Snape-Mainwaring, for long honourably known as closely
connected with our shipping industry. In other words,
Snape, who hastened his wife's departure to a happier
world with a hobnailed boot, was a drunken dock-
labourer. Thanks to the painful experience of her Sally
Snape days, there's not a lady in the land who could
teach Lady Kidderminster anything in the arts of stitch-
ing trousers, making jam, or putting on smart clothes;
and as Miss Sarita Mainwaring, of the Grecian Music-
Hall and the Verandah Theatre, she was unrivalled as
a dancer. But it was not these qualities, nor even her
red hair and green eyes, that made Kiddie fall in love
with her, and finally overcame the prejudices of his
family. She owed her success and her salvation to the
quality which FRANK DANBY expresses in the title of her
book. At each stage of her upward career Sally thought
herself in clover, till she found that in the clover there
were also pigs. But she kept them all at arm's length,
and incidentally made a man of Kiddie by virtue of
the heart of a child which was in her. Very likely there
story. At least, the story here is
hardly worthy of its setting. The underlying object of
the book is to expose the disgraceful conditions to which
seamen are subjected on the windjammers that compete
to supply England with cheap corn. Such an exposure
can be made effectively only by keeping to facts. Mr.
NoBLE's indictment may be true in the main, but there
are too many revolvers, too many brains blown out, too
much gore generally, to make it convincing. There are
pressgangs and fierce mutinies on the high seas which
urge one's mind back to the eighteenth century, the
novelist's golden age of such things; but an author has
no business to indulge in these old-world romantics when
there is Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE's name on the first page
after the “Prelude.” I should have liked to skip Mr.
LLOYD-GEORGE, but you can't very well skip the first
page of the first chapter.
It is denied that Mr. GEORGE BIRMINGHAM has in pre-
paration a sequel to “The Bad Times,” entitled “The
Excellent Daily Mail.”
By the way, when are we to have a great novel of
Town Life written by Mr. GEORGE BIRMINGHAM, Mr.
JACK LoNDON, and Miss ELLEN GLASGow in collabora-
tion ?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BACON MEMORIAL.
A NUMEROUSLY attended meeting
was held in the East Ham
Athenaeum last night to decide upon
what measures should be taken for
raising a fitting memorial to BAcon.
The chair was taken by Sir
THOMAS LIPTON, Bart. Among those
present were Lord GRIMTHORPE, Mr.
WILLIAM HARRIs, Mr. DENNY, the
brothers HUdson, and His Honour
Judge BACON, great-great-great-great-
grandson of the beneficiary. Various
plans, the Chairman said, had
been suggested for perpetuating the
fame of the great Lord Chancellor,
and not only the fame, but, he would
add, the name.
favour of a BACON Theatre. He
wrote:–
What needs my BAcon for his honoured bones?
I pray resolve me that.
The answer comes in no uncertain tones:
Parts full of fat.
And now, said the Chairman,
having cleared away opposition, let
us get to business. (Laughter.)
Mr. DENNY then rose and proposed
that the memorial take the form of
a gigantic statue of Lord BACON at
work upon Hamlet, with suitable
symbolic groups all around the base.
He would suggest as a site Smith-
field.
Lord GRIMTHORPE agreed as to the
monument, but said that he thought
meeting was addressed by . His
Honour Judge BAcon, who said that
speaking as a member of the family
—(prolonged enthusiasm)—he could
assure them that his ancestor pre-
ferred modest statues to anything
vast. Gray's Inn was undoubtedly
the best site. As for Hamlet, that
was, perhaps, a little bit dangerous.
They must not forget the Brown Dog
difficulties at Battersea, brought
about by controversial matters on
the inscription. He thought it
would be wise not to name the
play that BAcon was writing, but
merely to indicate that it was
a play, and let the public draw
their own conclusions.
(Cheers.) It was
a name of which
they were all
proud. (Hear,
hear.) It was
time that Eng-
lishmen rose to
the occasion and
let it be known
to the world at
large that the
prosperity and
eminence of the
nation were due
to Bacon. (Wild

“Much more to the purpose if the

(Long and increased cheering.)
The Chairman then proceeded to
read letters from eminent men. Mr.
SIDNEY LEE wrote that he saw no
reason for the memorial. (Groans.)
Dr. FURNIvaLL stigmatised the meet-
ing as a sty. (Tumult.)
Among other communications read
to the meeting was a quatrain
from the sprightly pen of Mr. WIL-

One of the HUdsons seconded
this. He said that a man's statue
should be erected in a man's town.
Lord BAcon was a St. Albans man,
and St. Albans ought to have his
statue. Look at BUNYAN. He was
a Bedford man, and his statue is at
Bedford. Look at Nelson. He was
a Trafalgar man, and his statue is in
Trafalgar Square.
The other HUDson differed. He
said that a national genius should
be celebrated in the national capital.
That was London. He would defy
anyone to say that London was not
the capital. Peaceable as he was, he
was prepared to fight the man who
contradicted him on the point.

with a name like that) will appeal
more readily than will the optimism
of The Birmingham Daily Mail.

AUTHOR TO ARTIST.
“Nunquamne reponam 7”
DEAR JAMEs, I have your card;
And, under protest, I will go
Next Sunday afternoon and throw
Upon your private picture-show
A cursory regard.
As for my sense of paint,
I never could contrive to tell
Whether it 's handled ill or well,
Though I appreciate the smell,
Which turns me sick and faint.
And I can seldom judge
What the design is meant to be,
Or know, without a printed key,
A “nocturne '' from a “symphony,”
Or either from a smudge.
Still, as your card has shown,
If honestly it seems to you
My patronage is worth a sou
It 's not for me to take a view
Less sanguine than your own.
Besides, I like to think
I'll find some living pictures there
(Women of fashion, wondrous fair,
Come to expose their fresh spring-
wear),
And lots to eat and drink.
But if I prattle Art,
Praising your work's ideal aim,
Don't hope to make me buy the
Same ;
If that is your insidious game
I simply will not part.
For well your conscience knows
That you in turn would smile awry,
Finding my humour fairly dry,
Were I to hint that you should buy
The stuff that I compose.
Some day I'll hold a test:
I too will circulate a card
And rope you in to listen hard
While the chefs d'acuvre of me the
bard
Are flung from off my chest.
Some sultry afternoon
I picture you, profoundly bored,
Hearing my epic, Gideon's Sword,
Followed by Lines to One Adored,
Jetsam and Nuts in June.

Of order forms that quote the charge
For luxe-editions wide of marge,
And I will watch you gaze at large
Musing on other themes.

A PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILL.
MR. A. E. W. MAsoN, M.P.,
AT THE PLAYHouse.
WE were wrong, after all, in
imagining that the Entente Cordiale
was an invention of our own days.
It seems that there was a good deal
of it going on among the outposts
along the lines of Torres Vedras; and
certainly one French prisoner on
parole in Devonshire had a very com-
plete understanding with Marjory
Strode, daughter of a neighbouring
magistrate. Warlike sentiment, how-
ever, still ran deep. Witness the
very graphic scene when the news of
a British victory, in which the local
regiment had borne a gallant part, was
read out in the hearing of the French
prisoner, his presence being over-
looked in the general excitement.
Mr. MAsoN’s play turns largely
upon a contest of wits between
Youth and Crabbed Age. Both the
very young Marjory and her very old
uncle showed a most remarkable cun-
ning for their years. But love and
parental pride are always excellent
intellectual tonics. At one point we
came within a trigger's pull of
tragedy; but Mr. MAsoN's admirers
never quite lost confidence in their
man's ability to get his puppets safe
out of a tight corner.
The character that did most to
bring about the happy conclusion was
a certain Spanish convent-girl who,
being in sudden need of protection,
threw herself, very sketchily attired,
into the arms of the young Ensign
Dick Strode, and ultimately relieved
his parent of any further need to
press his boy's suit elsewhere. Un-
fortunately, and to my profound re-
gret, this seductive creature was not
permitted to appear on the stage,
where I am certain she would have
been very well received.
There were one or two rather con-
ventional effects, such as Marjory's
song of separation, and the foreign
marriage of her rejected suitor; but
these found a sufficient set-off in the
novelty of the main scheme—the
prisoner's efforts to get himself

arrested so as to be relieved of his
parole.
The spontaneous humour of the
first two Acts (the second was excep-
tionally fresh and piquant, and full of
engaging contrasts) gave way to more
serious movement in the third,
save always when Dackum, most
delectable of butlers, animated the
scene in the person of Mr. John
HARwood; but it came again in
the last Act with Dick Strode's con-
fession of his exotic marriage. The
audience, though they derived a very
solid satisfaction from the play, were
not always immediately responsive
to Mr. MAsoN's humour. I fancied,
for instance, that the grotesque toy-
figure of WELLINGTON, constructed
by the French prisoner to hasten his
arrest, was rather wounding to their
insular susceptibilities.
The two old brothers Strode,
admirable foils to each other, were
excellently played by Mr. CYRIL
MAUDE and Mr. ALFREd Bishop, with
the assistance of Art and Nature
respectively. But much as I enjoyed
their performance, I could have done
with a little less of them, if I might
have had a little more of Mr. AINLEY.
In the part of Jean de Selac he was
an astonishingly attractive figure. To
a very masculine dignity he added
an almost womanly persuasiveness.
As a lover he was irresistible; and
his own discretion, aided by a slight
French accent and deportment, car-
ried him comfortably over the pitfalls
of sentimentalism.
In the title-rôle no one could have
bettered Miss SEVENING's charm of
face and manner; but the part called
for rather more impulsiveness and
mobility than she had at command.
I was privileged to sit close to a
politician of Mr. MASON's own colour;
and I wish now that I had thought to
tell him that I regard the evening's
Bill—a private member's—as likely
to be the most popular one that the
Liberal party has produced since it
came into power. Perhaps he will
kindly accept the present intimation
of my views on this head. O. S.

“APRIL will soon be here,” said
Miss MIDDLETON with a sigh of hap-
iness.
“Bless it,” I agreed. “My
favourite month. Twelve,” I added
conversationally, “is my lucky num-
ber, and Thursday the day of the
week on which I do least work.
When next the 12th of April falls
on a Thursday, which may not be
for centuries, look out. Something
terrific will happen.”
“It’s about now that one begins
to wonder if one is in form, or likely
to be.”
“Just about now,” I agreed. “I
always say that when the draw is
announced for the Semi-Finals of the
English Cup, in which, of course, I
take not the slightest interest what-
ever, and in fact hardly know what
teams are left in for it, though I
must say I hope Southampton win

She got up excitedly.
“Come along, then. I’ve got the

fact there is only one thing to say:
“You should have come out to 'er,

remark to make, because it is just
what one is always doing. At school
I could come out to anything that

difficulty lay in staying in. Nobody
ever told me how to do that.

“I know,” said Miss MIDDLEToN.
“But we must play against a wall.
Don't bowl too much to leg.”
I hadn't bowled since October the
4th. The first post-October ball
was a trifle over-pitched, and a little
too much to the right. All the same

“By Jove, I didn't know you were
so good. Was that the grapes?”
“How awful ' Yes. It simply
seemed to fly off the bat. 1 did ask
you not to bowl there, didn't I?’’
She looked so penitent that I had
to comfort her.
“It's all right,” I said consol-
ingly, “I had a man there. You
would have been out all the way.
Besides,” I went on, “a little air
will do the grapes good. They stay
all the time in one hot room, and
then when they go out into the cold
they don't muffle up, and the natural
consequence is— Or am I think-

“Never mind. We must remem-

There are several ways of cutting.
For myself, I was taught to cut
“square '' with the left leg across

sequence being that I can do neither.

her whole body into it; and the direc-

said.

it's all your fault for bowling so
badly.”

suggested. “It is generally.”

“It will be a point for lawyers to
argue, I fancy. What is actually
meant by hail? You would probably
define it at once as aqueous vapour
cooled down in the atmosphere to
the freezing point of water.”
“I don't know. Perhaps I
should.”
“But ‘hail ' here obviously has a
wider significance. I take it to mean
“anything that descends suddenly
from the clouds.” I haven't Williams

“It 's no good my keeping them

The worst of coaching—I speak
now as an expert—is that it is so
difficult to know what to say when
a lady whirls her bat twice round her
head, gives a little shriek, gets the
ball on the knee, and says, “What
ought I to have done then 2'' The
only answer I could think of was
“Not that.”
“I thought you knew all about

“But, you see, it depends upon
what you were wanting to do,” I said

was the best thing to do with that

modestly. “You don't often meet
that sort of ball in good cricket.”
“No, I suppose not. That's why
I didn't know what to do, I expect.
You know I generally know exactly

“Is that really so?” I cried ex-

Philanthropist (home from China). “You Know, My DEAR people, The prisons THERE ARE NOT THE sort of PLACES To which
You AND I ARE Accustomed.”
ALL ABOUT THE COMMON HOUSE-FLY.
[Explanatory Note.—As soon as I heard that a Children's Encyclo-
paedia was about to appear in parts, I sat down and composed this
article expressly for it. I thought it might strike the Editor as chatty
but instructive, and calculated to please not only the tiny tots, but boys
and girls of a larger growth. I was mistaken there, because it didn't.
The Editor replied that I “appeared to have completely misunderstood
the scheme and purpose of the work,” and “regretted his inability to
use the contribution I had been good enough to submit to him.” He
will regret it even more when he sees how well it looks in print. But
I am not angry with him, only rather annoyed.]
YoU may have noticed sometimes, when lying awake
in your little white cribs on a summer morning, a
quantity of small black dipterous (or two-winged)
objects apparently engaged in playing “I spy '' in the
air above your heads. And very likely you have wondered
what these objects can possibly be. They are Flies.
Their Latin name is Musca domestica—but you need not
trouble about that, as no fly ever answers to it. Per-
haps, too, you have wondered how it is that they never
happen to knock up against another. The reason is that
they are clever enough to know that if they did they
would be stunned, and perhaps severely bruised. They
are far more intelligent in their games than most
children. But how do they manage to walk up window-
panes, and upside down on the ceiling? If your hands
and feet were round hairy discs or suckers, like theirs,
you would be able to do so too. But as they are not,
perhaps you had better not try. The fly, when perfect,
has six legs, but all of them are extremely thin. It
is very sociable and readily attaches itself to human
beings, especially when they are not so young as
they used to be. If you possess a dear grandpapa
you will probably have observed this for yourselves.
But it likes butter even better. It is fond of animals—
especially horses, cows, and dogs. Some considerate
people who keep horses always have their tails cut quite
short, because, otherwise, the poor flies would be liable
to be disturbed just when they had settled down com-
fortably.
There is a pretty story of Uncle Toby (a kind old
gentleman in a celebrated book which you will know all
about some day, though you may never find time to
read it) who once caught a fly which had been buzzing
about his nose. Then he opened the window and let
it out, saying: “I’ll not hurt a hair of thy head. Go.
This world is surely wide enough to hold both thee and
me.” This fly was so touched by this act of generosity
that it refused to accept its liberty, and persisted in
returning to remain by its benefactor ever afterwards.
This will show you that a kind action is never thrown
away—even on a fly.
It was a fly, as I daresay you have read, who was the
only witness of the last moments of Poor Cock Robin
(v. article “Redbreast [Robin].” in future number).
“‘I,’ said the Fly, “with my little eye, I saw him die.’”
Though, really, a normal Fly has two eyes. These are
compound, and enable it to see all round itself, which is,
of course, a great convenience. It also possesses a long
fleshy proboscis, or trunk, like an elephant's (v. article
“Elephant,” in Part 3), through which it sucks up its
drink. In hot Weather it is afflicted with a perpetual

thirst. A great poet (it might have been Dr. WATTs,
but I really forget—you might ask your governess) once
addressed it as: “Busy, curious, thirsty fly," and
invited it to share his ale with him. But that particular
fly must have been unusually modest, because as a rule
they do not wait to be asked. -
The Fly, like the Cuckoo (q.v.), is the Harbinger ºf
Spring, though it has not the same characteristic call.
When you see the first fly, you will know that Winter
is coming to an end. But do not write to the paper
about it—leave that to your papa.
The Fly is most particular about its personal appear-
ance. If you watch it you will frequently see it brush-
ing its hair and cleaning its face with its front legs. In
this respact it affords a good example to children who
do not always keep themselves as tidy as they are told
to do. Ahem
I am sorry to say that quite lately people have been
trying to take away the Fly's character. One very
clever and learned man provided a large piece of cheese
and induced a fly to walk all over it. Afterwards he
examined its footprints through a thing called a micro-
scope (v. article “ Microscope,” later). I think you will
agree that this was not quite a nice way to treat one who
was, after all, in the position of a guest. In fact it seems
rather sneaky. But he did, and reported that it had
left goodness knows how many thousand bacteria (I must
tell you more about these interesting little creatures some
other day) in each footstep. Which is all very well, but
if that learned man ever examines his own bootsoles
after he has come in from a walk, I should just like to
know how many thousand million bacteria he would
find on them ' And in all probability he only has two
feet, while a fly, as we have already seen, has six
Yet he proposes that we should abolish all flies while
they are still larvae, i.e., quite babies! Have you ever
thought what would happen if there were no flies? I
will tell you. Quantities of poor people would be
thrown out of employment, and your poor papa would
have to pay more rates and taxes (you will know what
rates and taxes are when you are grown up) to support
them.
All the people who live by making fly-papers, and
those pretty coloured paper globes for the flies to settle
on, and the other things coated with sticky stuff which
are useful but not so pleasant to look at, and are some-
times called “Catch 'em alive oh's ''—all those hard-
working people are entirely dependent for their living on
the humble little fly, and would miss it dreadfully if it
disappeared altogether. Very likely that clever man
forgot to think of them; but when you come to know a
little about Political Economy (you must never expect
to know very much) you will see that there are two
sides to every question, and generally several.
Another interesting fact about flies is that it is
never easy to be certain whether they are really dead,
or only think they are. So, if you should discover one
seemingly lifeless in your cup of milk or tea, remember
that there is always hope. If you will only persevere
for two or three hours in the treatment recommended
for restoring animation to the apparently drowned (v.
article “ Humane Society,” in next part) you will, in
nine cases out of ten, be rewarded by perceiving signs of
returning vitality.
But if, on the other hand, the fly is found embedded
in a currant bun, you will merely be wasting your time
in any efforts to revive it.
And now I have told you all it is necessary for you
to know at present about the Common House-Fly.

THE DREADNOUGHTS.
A BALLAD ADAPTED TO THE Two-Power StANdARp.
[Dedicated, without any responsibility on the part of Mr. Punch (that
stern advocate of a strong Navy), and with apologies for all metrical
and tactical irregularities, to those extreme Germanophobes who appear
to forget sometimes that the “Two-Power Standard ” was adopted in
order to protect this country against any hostile combination of two
Powers.]

AT Rosyth, in the North Sea, Sir RICHARD GRENville

And a submarine, like a spouting whale, came plunging
from far away : -
“German ships of war at sea! We have sighted fifty-

Then sware Lord THOMAS How ARD,

I was never son of a gun, but I have not two to one;
I have only a hundred-and-five; we must fly to keep

I should count myself the coward if I left it, my Lord

So Lord How ARD on a Dreadnought he swiftly passed
away,
And he i. one hundred-and-four to fight off the Eastern
Shore ;
And Sir Richard looked not to the right nor yet to the
left that day;
But his colours to his mast

was made

He had only a hundred thousand men to work the ships
and to fight;
And he lay off Rosyth harbour till the German came in
sight,
With his inky Nassaus smoking, fifty-three, and all
abreast.
“Shall we fight or shall we fly?
Good Sir Richard, which is best ?
Woe is us for two that fail us that would make them
one to two.”
And Sir Richard said again:-"They be bulky Teuton
men;
But we'll play a round of rubbers with these hairy
German lubbers;
And we 'll batter them and shatter them, and beat them

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March
16.-The smell of gunpowder per-
meates both Houses. The talk is all
of guns, fifteen-pounders or eighteen-
pounders. A park of field artillery
fills the Star Chamber Court.
Members, trained in ordinary peace-
ful pursuits, involuntarily straighten
their backs and move in military
step as they enter the House. Across
the space of Palace Yard, which
really ought to be surrounded by a
moat, the tap of busy hammers
closing rivets up gives dreadful note
of preparation. (This, to be precise,
is only the workmen taking up Vic-
toria Street flanking Westminster
Abbey. They always do it when
Parliament is in session.)
In the Lords, CARNOT MIDLETON,
Organiser of Victory, has raised the
whole question of the readiness and
fitness of the Army for War. In the
Commons N. BonAPARTE HALDANE,
all unconscious of what was in store
for him, entered the House at Ques-
tion time blithe and debonair.

Appears from successive volleys of

mouth, which lately came under
hammer. Designing to obtain a big
price, he, according , to FABER,
manoeuvred to withhold from persons
assembled in auction-room, with
presumable intent of purchasing,
knowledge that the Government con-
templated passing a Licensing Bill
which would annihilate, blow up,
undermine, crush, knock over side-
ways the Trade, incidentally lessen-
ing the value of “The Coach and
Horses.”
In vain HALDANE cited fact that
Ministerial intention of bringing in
Licensing Bill had been common pro-
perty for two years. To deaf ears he
pleaded that Secretary of State for
War has nothing to do with settling
terms of sale of public-houses.

guns in Star Chamber Court.” Where
were the eighteen-pounder quick-

Ah! You can't deceive the Ad-
jutant of the Isle of Wight Royal
Artillery. The whole thing was a
blind. The fifteen-pounders were
designed for the service of the
Territorial Army. The eighteen-
pounders reserved for regular forces.
Mr. PERKs and other Members going
down to inspect the guns, finding
only one class on exhibition, believed
all was well. Place an eighteen-
pounder beside a fifteen-pounder, and
the edifice of false security devised
by HALDANE's subtle brain would
crumble in dust.

down to Staffordshire, will raise the
county in arms, march upon Shrop-

left the Bar.
Business done.—Army affairs hotly
discussed in both Houses.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—
Striking instance presented itself to-
night of manner in which House is
liable to submit to subtle influence
of passing circumstance. Sitting
set apart for business in connection
with closing of financial year. In
Committee of Ways and Means, bang
went £44,355,000 on account of
coming year. A mere trifle, scarcely
worth mentioning; decidedly not
worth discussing. Next came Report
stage of Supplementary Estimates.
On vote for Board of Agriculture,
LAURENCE HARDY rose to offer a few
remarks. At the moment, following
close on Question time, habitually the
most crowded period of sitting,
benches fairly filled.
Glancing round faces of expectant
audience, he remarked, “I desire to
call the attention of the Committee
to the manner in which the Destruc-
tive Insects and Pests Act is admin-
istered in relation to Gooseberry
Mildew.”
Gooseberry Mildew Hardly were
the words uttered than change was
wrought in appearance of House.
Blight fell first on benches below
gangway on Opposition side. Na-
tionalists and Labour Members, fold-
ing their copy of the Orders like the
Arab, as silently stole away. Cross-
ing the floor, Mildew descended on
Ministerial garden plot. Under its
influence Members curled up like the
young gooseberry leaf, and their
places knew them no more. Loyal
to an esteemed colleague, the group
of Members immediately before
LAURENCE HARDY for a while with-
stood the dire influence. Ulstermen
a tough breed. Can suffer an hour's,
even a night's, bickering with Home
Rulers below gangway. Gooseberry
Mildew quite another thing. Even
WINTERTON succumbed. Conscious
of a gathering hue on his expressive
countenance suggestive of a goose-
berry sickening of a vague disease,
the noble lord staggered towards the
door, closely followed by Captain
CRAIG, Corbett, and A. S. WILSON.
The SPEAKER, to some extent im-
mune under canopy of the Chair,
further sheltered by full-bottomed
wig, bravely sat it out. Possibly had
the Deputy Speaker been within
hail he might have yielded to temp-
tation and obtained a substitute. But
EMMOTT, who abhors Mildew, cannot
indeed stand blight of any kind, was,
like the “little JANE" of early-Vic-
torian verse, among “the first to
go.”
Big Ben tolled the knell of parting
day. One by one Members passed
slowly o'er the Bar. LAURENCE
HARDY plodded his weary way, and
left the House to Gooseberry blight
and me.
Sitting never recovered effect of
visitation. In vain BANBURY, who
invariably takes the palm on these
occasions, endeavoured to interest
Committee in exportation of silver
coinage to Africa. Darkly hinted there
was more in it than met the eye.
Can't be too careful with a Ministry
in power such as that which now
holds the reins. Subsequent effort to
discuss appointment of Public
Trustee fell flat. CRAIG and CoRBETT,
returning to their places, each carry-
ing a smelling-bottle, opened fire on
Nationalist quarters. They were
empty.
“Gooseberry-Mildewed,” WINTER-
ToN bitterly said.
“Gooseberry Mildew."

as rapidly as possible putting in
motion the hydraulic process by
which he pumps up his rolling voice
from the depths of his boots.
Unfortunately, confident that this
time he had collared a shuffling
Secretary with the deadly minutia of
his question, he had prematurely let
his voice go. To bring it up again is
an achievement of no slight en-
gineering effort. Just as the Speaker
was about to call on the next ques-
tion the bench on which Mr. WEIR
sat shook with subterraneous motion.
There was a rumble reminiscent of

WHEN CYRIL saw him, his first
thought was that his weight must
break down the balcony of stone.
His vastness did not lie only in
the fact that he was abnormally
tall and of colossal bulk. The man
was planned enormously in his
original proportions. He was en-
larged terribly to scale. His head
looked bigger than a head ought to
be. His nose reminded one irre-
sistibly of the outline of the Gross

lionaire pleasantly, “I will answer
you in your own familiar rhetoric.
You think that it is possible to pull
down the Manager. I know that it
is impossible, and I am going to try
it,” and, opening the door of the
Savoy Restaurant, he led CYRIL, cry-
ing like a child, into the tumultuous
roar of the Strand.
THE DUEL.
Both combatants had thrown off
their coats and waistcoats and stood
sword in hand, CYRIL in a close-
fitting tunic of Newfoundland wood
pulp, and the Manager in a doublet,
of three-quarters levant with Turkish
trousers and an Albanian fustanella.

The Professor suddenly said, “En-
gage,” and the two blades touched
and tingled. CYRIL fought like a
demon, while his enemy parried his
thrusts with a kind of clockwork
skill which reminded his opponent,
he knew not why, of Printing House
Square . . . Twice CYRIL knocked
his opponent's point far out of the
fighting circle; the third time his
sword actually bent under the weight
of the Manager's body which it had
pierced. But when he withdrew his
sword there was no blood on it. A
minute later he felt his point enter
the monster's neck below the jaw. It
came out clean. Surely the man
bore a charmed life. The Professor
was only a goblin; but the Manager
was a devil—perhaps he was the
Devil. “After all,” said CYRIL to
himself, “I am more than a devil; I
am a superman,” and he fell to
fighting again with a supernatural
levity, like a Mohammedan panting
for Paradise. Suddenly, to the
astonishment of everyone, the Man-
ager sprang back quite out of sword
reach and threw down his weapon.
“Stop!” he cried in a terrible voice
like the trumpeting of a rogue
elephant. “We are fighting to-day,
if I remember right, because you
expressed a wish to pull my nose.
Would you oblige me by pulling it
now as quickly as possible, as I want
to appear before the Court?” Walk-
ing in worlds he half understood,
CYRIL took two paces forward and
seized the massive proboscis of his
redoubtable antagonist.
He pulled it hard, and it came off
in his hand.
THE MANAGER's TRIUMPH.
One by one the wanderers ascended
the bank and sat in their strange
seats. But the central chair was
empty. Suddenly the Manager
passed silently along the front like a
shadow and sat down in it. He was
clad plainly in a pure and terrible
white vellum, and his hair waved in
ambrosial ringlets on his encyclo-
paedic temples. The fire slowly faded
and the slow stars came out,
and the seven strange men were left
alone. At last the Manager spoke
dreamily but with an accent of placid
exultation. “We will eat and drink
later,” he said. “Let us remain to-
gether a little, we who have loved
each other so sadly and have fought
so long.” There was complete silence
in the bleak bare wood for a while,
and then CYRIL turned in his chair
towards the speaker and said in a
harsh yoice, “Who and what are

“I was and am and shall be the
Manager,” said the other, without
moving. -
The Professor started up. “I
know what you mean,” he cried,
“ and it is exactly that which I can-
not forgive you. I know you stand
for ultimate reconciliation, but I am
not yet reconciled.”
The Manager looked at him and
said in his softest bel canto: “It
seems so silly that you should have
been on both sides and fought
yourself.”
The Professor replied: “True, I
understand nothing, but I am
happy. In fact I am going to
sleep.”
And then CYRII, said with the
simplicity of a little child, “I wish I
|-knew why I was hurt so much,” and
turning his eyes so as suddenly to
see the great face of the eternal
Manager, which wore a saturnine
and colossal smile, “Have you,” he
cried in a terrible voice, “ have you
ever suffered?” As he gazed the
great face grew to an awful size—
larger even than the Sphinx and the
Great Wheel combined. It grew
larger and larger, filling the whole
sky. Then everything went black,
and CYRIL remembered nothing more
until he woke in the middle of next
week, murmuring to himself the old
line which he had read at Win-
chester: -

manner of pro-consuls, thought he would like to
enter Parliament. In 1879 he had arranged to
stand for East Norfolk at the pending General Elec-
tion. Lord SALisbury, who knew a capable man
when he came in contact with him, offered him the
appointment, of British representative in the dual
control of Egypt just arranged with France. It is

Mr. ARCHIBALD MARSHALL has written Many Junes
(METHUEN), and I have had the good fortune to read it.
Mr. MARSHALL has not imitated himself, for the novel
differs greatly from Exton Manor and The House of
Merrilees. Indeed, it is written in a minor key, for
Hugh, the hero, is one of those unhappy beings whose
till his fortieth year. Fate reserved
him for Egypt, and he, more than
any other man, worked out the
metamorphosis which places the once
hapless country amongst the most
prosperous of provinces. In Modern
Egypt (MACMILLAN) Lord CROMER,
with a modesty that adds charm to
the narrative, tells the wondrous
story. The task reluctantly taken in
hand is admirably defined in a sen-
tence. Themselves an alien race,
the English had to control and
guide a second alien race (the Turks),
by whom they were disliked, in the
government of a third race, the
Egyptians. Lord CROMER makes it
clear that there was no pretence on
the part of Mr. GLADs.ToNE's Govern-
ment, 1880-5, in their reiterated pro-
clamation of desire to be delivered
from the task. They put their hand
to it since they could not afford to be
indifferent to the internal manage-
ment of the highway to India. They
were forced to complete it by the
dillydallying of France, culminating
in the withdrawal of the French
fleet from Alexandria prior to the
bombardment. A series of events
want of character (cleverly portrayed
in this instance) leads them from
mischance to mischance and denies
them any compensating happiness.
He engages himself against his judg-
ment to the daughter of a match-
maker. By the somewhat holo-
caustic death, if I may say so, of a
whole family of relatives, number-
ing, I think, seven (one perishes in
an Indian frontier war, the rest are
drowned en masse), he succeeds to
wealth and a great estate, but imme-
diately falls in love with a miller's
grand-daughter, with whom he
carries on a desperate flirtation. His
ill-luck, however, again asserts itself,
and he has to marry the lady to
whom he was engaged, while the
lady of the mill marries an old
clergyman. Thus he is left with a
good deal of quiet unhappiness still
in front of him. Mr. MARSHALL’s
style is always pleasant, as his
readers know, and his gift of humour
plays agreeably over the pages of
Many Junes.

TREMENDoUs TESTIMONIES.
[“The Omniscients' Omnium-gatherum.” seen
through the eyes of its Readers.]
THE proof of the pudding is in the
eating, or, as the Roman poet
SoPHocLEs used to say, Earperto
crede. The real test of the utility of
the Omniscients' Omnium-gatherum
is that applied by its purchasers, who
range from Field-Marshals to sand-
wichmen. The opinions which fol-
low, selected at random from billions
which have reached us, state in con-
cise yet pathetic terms how helpful
our universal olla podrida has proved
to all ranks, all classes, all creeds,
from the king sitting on his crown to
the labourer sitting on his cottage.
The chief of a Central African
tribe, whose name is unfortunately
illegible, has graciously permitted us
to make use of the following unique
testimonial:—
Literal translation.—“Having de-
voured your omniscience for the
past fortnight I have now renounced
cannibalism for ever.”
A famous Field-Marshal, whose
name we are obliged to suppress in
deference to the wishes of the Army
Council, allows us to print his
opinion of the Omniscients' Omnium-
gatherum, which he has lately pur-
chased out of his winnings at
Kriegspiel:—
“I am convinced that the study of
these massive and magniloquent
volumes cannot but conduce to the
inauguration of a pacific millennium.
So appalling is the amount of warfare
recorded in these pages that if it
could only be made compulsory for
every private soldier to commit them
to memory the fighting instinct
would be irreparably atrophied, and
the question of international disarma-
ment solved by a universal military
strike.’’
A famous Poet, whose name we
are obliged to withhold in deference
to his notorious modesty, allows us
to print the following appreciation:-
“In the opinion of this writer your
work has only one serious drawback.
Its attractions are so absorbing that
for the last three weeks the fount of
his inspiration has been checked, and
not a single line has been added to
the masterpieces with which he has
already enriched the treasure-house
of English literature. The loss, how-
ever, may be compensated by future
gain, as this long abstinence from
the Pierian spring can hardly fail to
provoke a recurrence of the divine
afflatus in its most acute form.”
A pronounced Vegetarian sends the
following remarkable testimony from
Pythagoras Mansions, Woking:—
~
-
DISTINCTION WITHOUT DIFFERENCE,
ſ
ºa
She, “I’m Told You BELIEVE IN NOTHING."
Ble. “I NEVER SAID so.
I said I BELIEVED ONLY IN what I UNDERStood.”
“Your wonderful work is a verit-
able beanfeast of mental proteids.
Since embarking on its perusal . I
have been able so to reduce my daily
diet that before long I hope to be
able to subsist on one nut cutlet and
two gooseberries per diem.”
A Rural Dean forwards us the sub-
joined flattering estimate of our uni-
versal Brain-feeder:—
“I have only one thing to say
against your magnum opus, and that
is that I find it so fascinating that
my work is apt to suffer in conse-
quence. For instance, the other day
I was so deeply immersed in your
priceless pemmican of fact and fancy
that I entirely forgot to prepare my
Sunday sermon. But hurriedly con-
sulting the index under the headings
PERICLEs, BossueT, LUTHER and
SwedENBoRG, I was enabled to treat
my congregation to such a compen-
dious and illuminating discourse that
the parish is still reverberating with
the echoes of my eloquence.”
A great Pianist sends us the follow-
ing gratifying letter from the
AEolian Hall : —
“Your Omnium - gatherum is
colossal. I have not touched the
keyboard for five days, but when I
do it will be with a reinforced brain
power that will stagger humanity and
cause THALBERG to turn in his
tomb.”

WHY NOT :
THE “Grand Guignol ’’ performances by the Parisian
company at the Shaftesbury Theatre have so successfully
tickled the palates of jaded British playgoers in search
of a really cheery entertainment that before long we
shall probably see some enterprising London manager
providing them with something similar, in a language
they understand even better than French. The theatre
will perhaps be re-christened “The Grown-up Punch
and Judy Playhouse,” or “The Snippet Show,” and
the morning after the opening Mr. Punch anticipates
finding in his daily journal some such notice as the
following:— -
SHRIEKS AND SHUDDERS AT THE SNIPPET-SHOW.
A THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE EVENING.
London has seen “La Ville Lumière,” and gone one
better | With yesterday evening began a brighter,
happier era for our long-depressed British Drama.
We cordially congratulate the management of “The
Snippet Show Theatre '' on the triumphant success with
which they have assimilated and improved upon the
dramatic ideals and methods of our livelier neighbours
across the Channel. Every one of the five playlets in
their present programme may be relied upon to furnish
the spectator's spinal marrow with that peculiar frisson
of delicious horror which is the infallible test of all
, Great Art. Last night, indeed, two eminent dramatic
critics fainted in their stalls, and another had to be
carried out in an epileptic fit, while the tumultuous
applause was frequently enhanced by violent hysterics
from ladies in all parts of the house.
The first drama, “The Way He Should Go,” by Miss
VIRGINIA JUNKETT and Miss PRIscilla BUBB, shows us
a room in a fifth-story flat, where a momentous discus-
sion is proceeding between a typical Father and Mother
(Mr. CHARNELL Scully and Miss CAssandra STAIR) con-
cerning the education of their infant son. The Father is
determined to send him to a Public School “to make a
man of him.” . The Mother, fearing that the boy's in-
dividuality would be destroyed and his spirits cowed by
bullying, insists on his being brought up at home under
private tuition. A wonderful duologue, reminding one,
by its strange mysticism and the lurid side-lights it
throws on the past and present relations between the
pair, of the Norwegian Master himself! The child is
sent for, and the final choice referred to him. The
poor little fellow (most pathetically played by little Miss
BIRDIE NICKERSON) can only answer that, of the two
alternatives, he prefers his Mother's. Whereupon the
exasperated Father, in a burst of ungovernable rage,
hurls him through the open window. . A sickening
thud is heard below, followed by confused cries of
horror. “The area railings are spiked,” shrieks the
agonised Mother. “You have ruined our only son.” “I
have saved him,” is the Father's grim retort. “No one
now will ever reproach him for being a milksop | ". Then,
as the curtain falls, both remember with unavailing
remorse that, after all, the boy might have attended a
Public School as a day-boarder
“The Hydrophobiac,” by Mr. ALARIC PAPSEy, was
of a somewhat lighter order. A jovial householder,
returning late from a fancy-dress ball at Covent
Garden, is unrecognised by his faithful hound, which
fixes its teeth in his nose. Alarmed by the absence
of all sensibility in that organ, which he has read
is a sure symptom of approaching hydrophobia, the
Master orders the dog to be destroyed, and a doctor sent
for. Alone. on the stage, his symptoms increase in
violence. The extraordinarily humorous effects that Mr.
ACTAEON HoRNIMAN achieved in this soliloquy—his furious
snaps at the furniture, his lips white with real foam, his
deadly terror of a soda-water syphon, and, finest of all,
his dying convulsions—cannot be described here. Suffice
it that they are strong enough to draw all London. The
doctor, on arriving, removes the dead man's nose, which
proves to be merely pasteboard, while the dog is pro-
nounced perfectly sane. “There is a worse disease than
Hydrophobia!" he says. “We call it Imagination "
which brings the curtain down in a gale of laughter.
The third item on the bill, “Pinned In,” by Mrs.
EUNICE ORRED, is so daringly unconventional and so
appallingly gruesome that it requires an iron nerve to sit
it out—though that, of course, is not likely to deter the
public from thronging the box office. Just before the
curtain rises we hear a grinding, deafening crash, with a
roar of escaping steam, and heartrending screams for help.
Then a portion of a derailed express is discovered, in
the wreckage of which a wealthy financier is seen to be
imprisoned. He frantically offers half his fortune to
the man who will get him out before the flames (for
the wreckage has caught fire) reach him. Unfortunately
for him, the only person in a position to rescue him is
a platelayer, who, having formerly been ruined by the
financier's dishonesty, very naturally declines to render
any assistance.
The grim humour of this scene was positively electri-
fying. But we must confess that, before the moment
at which the unhappy, financier is, by a marvellously
contrived illusion, slowly consumed in full sight of the
audience, we made a hasty retreat to the nearest refresh-
ment-bar. So we can only record that the curtain had
to be raised nine times before the house had grown
weary of expressing its enthusiasm.
After this, “Grandfather's Clock,” by Messrs. JEM
JAMIESON and GoTTHEMAR GEHN, seemed comparatively
tame. The plot is simple. A collector has just pur-
chased an antique eight-day clock at an auction. It will
not go, although it persists in striking thirteen every
quarter of an hour, and the local Clock-winder is
called in to consult and advise. As he opens the
case the corpse of an aged man topples forward in an
advanced stage of decay, but the Clock-winder is just
able to identify his great-grandfather, who mysteriously
disappeared on the Coronation day of the late QUEEN
Victoria. This little trifle is very slight, but it has the

merit of freshness, and its authors may certainly be
encouraged to try again.
The concluding piece, “The Electrocution Cell,” by
Mr. JEREMIAH RIPPIN, was more farcical in character. We
are shown the Electrocuting Chamber, with its dread
paraphernalia, all prepared for action. The condemned
man, never having been electrocuted before, professes his
utter inability to understand how the apparatus is
worked. So the executioner obligingly illustrates the
process by seating himself in the fatal chair. No sooner
has he done so than the convict switches on the current
and escapes, leaving his victim to expire in acute agony.
A smart skit on Capital Punishment which provoked the
audience to vociferous merriment.
Next week we are promised Mr. LARRY O'HooliGAN's
scathing exposure of Army Discipline, “The Last
Stand.” . We hear that its first scene will depict
the pitiable cowardice displayed by a handful of British
officers and men, besieged in a stockade by an over-
whelming force of savages. The Englishmen offer to
betray important strategical secrets if their lives are
only spared; but, being unable to express themselves
in any foreign language, are massacred to a man. The
second scene represents the unveiling of a memorial to
their memory, with orators delivering eloquent tributes
to the heroes' self-sacrifice at their Country's call.
This mordant satire is certain to delight the growing
section of Anti-Militarists.
We should add that a staff of doctors and nurses are
kept in readiness at the theatre, and bottles of strong
smelling-salts may be obtained on hire from any of the
attendants.

Mr. Punch gave his readers a few facts about the
house-fly last week. Since then, however, an important
discovery has been made by a correspondent of The
Daily Graphic, who writes to that paper as follows:–
“I have found a very effective way to clear a room of the house-fly,
and also the blue-bottle, is to use a butterfly-net. When you have
caught some put the net on the floor, kill them, turn them out, and
commence afresh.”
Mr. Punch heartily approves of this plan, which may
be adapted with equal ease to an overflow of hippo-
potamuses, white-mice, or electric-eels—the root idea of
“killing, turning out, and commencing afresh,” remain-
ing the same.

tively) and in the Guildhall, and (often) in the Corn Exchange (!), a
cold, cheerless building.”—The Record.

AN OPEN LETTER TO SPRING.
DEAR LADY,-When I woke this
morning to find another damp, dark
miserable day I resolved there and
then to write to you about it. Is
this, I decided to ask you, is this
the best you can do? You know, I
don't believe you 're trying.
It is, of course, more usual to ad-
dress you in verse at this time of the
year; and I should have done so, only
I thought you would be tired of verse
by now. You mustn't think that I
couldn't do it. I could easily; in-
deed I began something which went
like this:–
“O Muse, who never failed me yet;
Save once—when on some Indian tribe row
A chastely-worded chansonette
Turned out an epic to an eye-brow—
Tell me, my pretty,
Is this the spring, or not, or what, and where's
NEGRETTI 2 ''
I might have gone on; but the diffi-
culty of finding any sort of rhyme to
“ZAMBRA ’’ in the second verse
steadied me; and, as I say, I knew
you would be tired of poetry—even
the best. Yet my Muse would have
at it again, and we initiated an appeal
ad misericordiam. Thus:
“I stood in tears amid the flowers,
And waited for you howers and howers."
If I must be truthful, it was really
then that I saw how much better
would be a few stirring words in
prose.
My dear, you must do your best
for me. Give me a fine April and
May, and your sisters shall do what
they like with the other months. I
am trying to encourage you. Yes-
terday I took out my bat (the one
with which I made that twenty-two
last year), and oiled it carefully.
She will see I am waiting for her,
thought I, and she will come to-
morrow. But you didn't, you know.
I don't ask you to think only of
me. Think of the flowers and but-
terflies and birds, and the man who
wants to write to the papers to say
that he has heard the cuckoo, or
caught a tortoiseshell in his library; I
doubt if you are being quite fair to
them. If I were a gardener I would
tell a harrowing tale to bring you to
shame. A tragedy of—of dahlias,
full of hope and promise, cut off in
their prime. Knowing what you do
about dahlias you may say that this
is absurd; but if I had given you
the Latin name you would never have
recognised them, and you would have
been so sorry. What of the blighted

of him.

pose that Ruby had gone out of her

self out a bit; had, perhaps, put
herself forward rather—for a bird;
and that now he was throwing it in
her face. (The cad.) Well, dear
Spring, I want you to think of Ruby.
She must be feeling now that she
need not have been in such a hurry,
after all; that she might just as well
have waited another month; that all
for nothing had she been unmaidenly.
Poor dear, you have been cruel to
her, have you not?
To leave birds and flowers (for,
after all, I know little about them,
and I may be misjudging their feel-
ings), and to come back to myself:
I have this also against you, Spring
—your fickleness. No doubt we all
have that against you (as indeed
against all your sex); but I fancy that
certain of us are affected particularly.
The householder steps into his
garden after breakfast, takes the
morning for a moment, and says:
“A warm day, my dear. I will have
my light coat.” Very good. But
have you ever thought of us others,
perched on the tops of high buildings,
with no means of tasting the day ?
I used to think that the bath was a
sure test. When at the first plunge
a loud cry of “Help! ” came unex-
pectedly to my lips, then I knew
that I should want my thickest coat.
When I uttered an unstudied “Oh 1'.'
something lighter was necessary.
But could I rise silent from the
waves then I felt that I might ven-
ture into the open all unprotected.
Lately, however, something seems to
have happened to the cistern. They
must ice my water; anyhow, I say
“Help! ” every morning.
So now I have to take my chance.
It was not fair to me, Spring, to
give us that glorious day after a suc-
cession of cold ones, so that I
marched round London in two waist-
coats and the thickest of ulsters.
Well, my dear, let me beg you
once more. Pull yourself together,
and give us a beautiful April. Never
mind ZAMBRA or the young woman
at The Daily Graphic. Put on your
greenest frock, your sweetest smile :
be your own sunny self. I know
that the poems addressed to you
must make you long to weep; but
see—I have spared you mine. Come
then, buck up. Be sure that your
smallest effort will be appreciated by
your admirers. . . .
P.S.—You will get this on April
the First. As I look up I see that it
has turned into a beautiful day; and
I suppose that you will go on like
this now so as to make an April fool
of me. How like you ! You know, I
wondered if you would be able to
resist the temptation. In fact that
is partly why I wrote. So perhaps
it is I who am making an April fool
of you! A. A. M.
BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
A LEAP-YEAR DANCE.
DEAREST DAPHNE, - My mi-
caréme Leap-Year Fancy Dress
Dance was a simply howling success,
and has had an enormously gratify-
ing result in the shape of HILDE-
GARDE's engagement to Lord Wide-
LANDs, of which more anon.
I appeared as “My great-grand-
mother,” after one of our RomNEY
family portraits down at Old Hall.
Josiah said, “Where do I come in 2
I can't figure as “My great-grand-
father,' for I don't go back as far as
that.” “Oh, that 's all right,” I
told him. “Gives you all the wider
range. Think what an immense
choice of characters you can pick
from, and still figure as ‘Your great-
grandfather'ſ '' Finally, he decided
on Dr. Johnson (one of the few cele-
brities he knows of); but, as he had
no Bozzy to draw him out and make
him say, “’No, sir,” and “Hold
your tongue, sir,’’ and all those sorts
of things that have made the old
Doctor famous (and a very easy wa
of getting famous, I think!) he fell
rather flat.
Bosh and WEE-WEE came as a pair
of Historical Puzzles. Bosh was that
mysterious Man in the Iron Mask
who wrote the Letters of Junius, you
know, and said “Remember 1 '' to
somebody; and WEE-WEE was PERKIN
WARBEck, who said he was one of the
Princes who had been smothered in
the Tower, when everyone else said
he wasn't. . She was got up rather
like a Principal Boy, and I will own
here that, when I first saw her, I felt
a bit cheap, and out of conceit with
“My great-grandmother.” BABs
was the Spirit of the Age. She was
all hung with symbolical things. I
daresay it was very clever, but no-
body took the trouble to stop and
learn her.
Norty rather offended some people
by coming as Influenza. He was
muffled up in grey draperies with a
horrid little black figure on them
that he said was the microbe of it,
and he had on a sort of crown made
of small quinine bottles. He said he
didn't suppose anyone would have

the courage to ask him to dance, but
plenty did.
Lord WIDELANDs, who, as of course
you know, has suffered for some time
from eligibility in an acute form, and
has earned quite a name among the
demoiselles à marier as a passive re-
sister, looked very well as a Court
Jester in motley, with cap and bells.
It certainly is a dress, I allow, that
wants a particularly neat figure and
'straight legs, and Lord WIDELANDS
has not, perhaps, exactly a neat
figure, and is just a weeny bit bandy;
but still he looked very nice, and was
quite a success. He kept up the
character with a lot of funniments.
Norty said they were old chestnuts
that he 'd learned up on purpose.
What if he had 2 W. can't all be
spontaneous. HILDEGARDE was sim-
ply a dream (everyone remarked on
her likeness to me) as Aurora, in
clouds of rosy tulle-de-soie, with the
morning-star on her forehead.
Dolly DE LACY made quite a small
sensation as “Turkish Delight—the
Belle of the Harem.” He certainly
did both look and act the part à mer-
veille. Nobody would have guessed
that he wasn't a girl, and an Eastern
girl at that He was brought by
Popsy, Lady RAMsgATE (she was the
cause of her grand-daughter's en-
gagement to Dolly being broken off,
you remember; the girl got so jealous
of her granny). Popsy came as Little
Boy Blue. Josiah was furious when
he caught sight of her, and said she
oughtn't to have been let in, looking
like that. I believe he would have
liked to turn both her and poor
Dolly out of the house ! He doesn't
get a bit more up to date in his ideas.
And now, my dear, for little HILDE-
GARDE, and the way she brought off
her coup !
She and Lord WidelANds, who 've
been rather pals for some time, were
sitting out when the rush for supper
began.
“Won't you take me in?” said
the Court Jester. “I don't mind,”
answered Aurora, rising. “Well,
you ought to offer me your arm,”
said the Court Jester. “That's cor-
rect Leap-Year form, isn't it?”
“There it is, then,” said Aurora,
holding out her arm; “but I can't
offer it without its hand, can I?’’
Wasn't it smart of the child?
She 's not been under my wing for
nothing 1 The engagement will be
announced almost at once.
Norty said rather a nasty thing
when I whispered the news to him
that night before he left.
“The Court Jester will have to
alter the spelling of his front word.”
He must have his joke at any cost.

PADDY.
(With acknowledgments in several quarters.)
Now let me sing of the prowess of PADDY the speedy
left-winger, - º .
Paddy the pet of the crowd, PAddy the pride of his pals.
No one more skilful than he ever scudded along any
touch-line,
Swift as a giddy gazelle, swift as a bolt from the blue;
Swift as the ready retort of a cabby that 's baulked by
a 'bus-man; -
Swift as the flash of my brain weaving you verses like
these.
Ever since he was “induced '' to enrol with the Rotten-
ham Roosters
(Who, to secure such a plum, paid a phenomenal fee)—
Ever since PADDY, I say, first joined the redoubtable
Roosters,
Donned the uproarious shirt striped with the red-
white-and-blue,
Made his début with éclat (and aplomb) v. the Chip-
pendale Chestnuts—
Right from that day until this, PADDY 's been Rotten-
ham's pet.
Note the reception he gets as he enters the crowded
arena— -
Plaudits and, now and again, little tit-bits of advice:
“Nah thin, PAddy me boy, give 'em socks ''—but why
ever not stockings?—
“Give 'em wot for, do yer 'ear? Tell 'em they'd
better go 'ome 1 ''
“Nah thin, PADDY me boy, you're a-goin' to be beaten
—I don't think!".
(Neat little touch like the last clearly betokens the
Wagº).
My nºis hang on each twist and each turn of his
lithe little body,
Take in the points of his shirt—whether he rolls up the
sleeves, -
How many buttons there are, and whether he fastens
the top one :
All, to the man in the crowd, matters of life and of
death.
There goes a roar of delight as Paddy bowls somebody
over,
Rolling him right in the mud, spoiling the bloom of
his shorts.
There goes another that 's louder, for PADDY is sprinting
his fastest,
Swift as-you'll find it above—straight for the opposite
oal.
Now the crowd rises en masse—more French, you will
notice—on tip-toe,
Watches that slim little chap going for all he is worth;
Watches with eyes that are glued and with breath that
(believe me) is bated,
Thrilled through and through to the bone: points in the
League are at stake 1
See, he has diddled the half—but, oh, will be diddle the
full-back 2
Look! he is past in a flash . . . Gad, he has got 'em

ALL ABOUT THE CREWS.
THE waterman was standing on the edge of the
tow-path near the Putney boathouses, and had just
finished shouting something stentorian and (to me) quite
unintelligible at the commander of a string of barges
that were going up on the last of the flood. The com-
mander, however, had evidently understood him and
had answered in similar language with various panto-
mimic gestures thrown in. The waterman laughed
heartily. “I told yer 'e done it—ah, and last Thurs-
day, too ! 'E never went back on 'is word. Beg yer
pardon, sir; I took you for old JoE. My eyesight ain't
what it was. Oxford and Cambridge crews? No, you've
missed 'em. They went 'ome 'alf-an-hour back, but
they 'll be out again in about three hours' time on the
ebb. Can't wait for it? Well, it 's a pity. They 're a
likely lot, both on 'em; 'andles their oars well and sets
up to their work.” He accepted a cigar, lit it, and
puffed. “Which on 'em 's goin' to win? Ah, I've got my
own fancy, you know. Can't 'elp 'avin' it when I seen
'em every day. They can't both win. That's what I
allus say: one on 'em 's got to go faster than tother;
and when it comes to that there you are; but they 're
all tryin' 'ard. There was a bit of work Cambridge done
yesterday—no, it was the day before yesterday. I re-
member, the day, 'cos it was the same day last year I
'ooked the ole gal out o' the water. It was nine o'clock
of a Toosday night, and I was settin' by the path near
the pier down there, when I see 'er come along. ‘Well,
if 'e won't come 'ome,” she sez, ‘’ere goes,’ she sez.
‘I told 'im I'd do it.’ I 'eard 'er quite plain, same
as I sees you, and with that she give a shriek and climbs
up the railing and over she goes. She 'd mistook the
tide, for the ebb was three parts run out, and there
warn't more 'n a foot or two of water where she jumped.
She stood there 'ollerin' blue ruin, and I got 'old of a
skiff by the 'ard there and after 'er I went. “Don’t
save me, sailor," she sez when she see me comin', ‘ I 've
sworn to die.’ “So you shall, ma'am,' I sez, “ some
other day. You'll die all right, never fear; but you've
got to come aboard 'ere now,’ and with that I ketched
'old of 'er. It took me ten minutes to 'eave 'er in, she
was stuck so tight in the mud. She kep' cryin' out-
that she wanted to die first; but she never let go o'
me, and I got 'er ashore at last. It was only a 'alf-
grown job. "Erole man wasn't too pleased when I took
'er back to 'im, but 'e paid up.”
“Then you think it'll be a good race?” I ventured to
put in, just to bring him back to his subject.
“Race? Ah, you'll see a race all right, never fear.
There 'll be some 'ammer an' tongs work between this
and 'Ammersmith; but there 's only one in it, same as
my little dawg when they set 'im up agin a rat last
Saturday at the ‘Compasses.’ It was one shake and no
more wanted. 'E 's got some terrier in 'im and a bit o'
bull crorsed with a spanel; a very game dawg 'e is, but
'is teeth is gettin' a bit loose. It was all along o'
the distemper. D'ye know 'ow I cured 'im 2 Larded
'is nose with a lump o' tar. Stockolloma tar, mind
you, not ornery tar. Ornery tar's no good for dis-
temper, but this Stockolloma kind 's prime stuff.”
He relit his cigar and I brought him round to the
subject of coxswains.
“Ah, you may well say coxens. They're little chaps,
but they 've got to 'ave a big ’eart to steer this course.
There 's a cruel eddy when you come out through
'Ammersmith Bridge, and Barnes ain't much better;
more by token it was at 'Ammersmith I got upset when
I went after a dead un. Bobbin' along 'e was, but I

GENIUS AND MELODY.
CouxT Tolstoi's recent declaration of his preference
for the classical composers has prompted our enterprising
contemporary Polyhymnia to circularise a number of dis-
tinguished British authors with a view to ascertain their
musical likes and dislikes. Out of a vast number of
answers we select the following:—
Mr. CLEMENT SHORTER, writing on behalf of Mr.
GEORGE MEREDITH, stated that his friend the famous
fictionist was much addicted to the compositions of the
musician known as CLEMENS NON PAPA. Some excellent
photographs of Mr. MEREDITH listening to Mr. SHORTER
playing on the pianola have just been published in Dork-
ing, and are bringing visitors in their hundreds to the
quaint old Surrey township.
Mr. H C— playfully confessed to a natural
preference for the music of his ancestor TUBAL. For the
rest it was enough to say that he had been elected by a
large majority to the House of Keys on a broadly pro-
gressive programme. Mr. C– added that he thought
there was a great deal of insincerity in the cult of
WAGNER. At any rate the queue at Covent Garden when
the Ring was being performed was not a quarter as long as
that which attended the production of The Prodigal Son.
Miss M– C—, who, it is well known, is pro-
ficient on the piano and the mandolin (Who's Who,
p. 398), and began to compose an opera entitled Ginevra
da Siena when barely fourteen (ibid.), professed her in-
ability to appreciate a good deal of modern music. Still,
the name of perhaps her most famous heroine was MAvis.
The Poet Laureate in a long autograph letter observed :
“This writer has always been remarkable for the
divided allegiance which he has paid to horticulture and
the Muses, and, as the greater includes the less, so must
distinction in the service of Apollo ea hypothesi involve
a complete mastery of all the apparatus possessed by
Euterpe and Polyhymnia. It was BRow NING's entire
lack of melody that prevented his making good his claim
to be considered a major poet, and thereby earning the
privilege of writing to the newspapers in the third person.
Moreover, BRow NING's repute was fatally damaged by
the discovery that not only the Ring but the book had
been written by WAGNER. In conclusion this writer ven-
tures to recall the following couplet:-
Aim at a style bajovial, not Brahmsy,
If you one day would quaff the Laureate's Malmsey.”

THE OPENING OF THE Port LAND HALL
of VARIETIES.
(From a Newspaper of 1918)
LAST night saw the formal opening
of the magnificent new music-hall,
to which the name The Portland
has been given. This building,
it will be remembered, began its
career as the Shakspeare Memorial
Theatre of National Dramatic Art,
just as some years earlier the
Palace music-hall had begun as
the English Opera House. It is
perhaps well that the early chapters
in the lives of such establish-
ments should be chequered, since
it thus becomes the more easy for
them to be made brilliantly success-
ful when they fall into the right
hands. The end, at any rate,
justifies the means. A more com-
fortable hall than the new Portland
could not be imagined. The
decorative scheme in white and
crimson and gold is exceedingly gay
and attractive, the seats are
luxurious, and each one is provided
with a ledge for glasses and an
ash-tray, while the view of the stage
from every point is perfect.
The original statues around the
walls were fated to be a little out of
place, but a few deft strokes on the
part of a staff of sculptors put that
all right. It is astonishing, indeed,
what a clever craftsman can do with
a mallet and chisel. For example,
the bust of Mr. SIDNEY LEE, who
was one of the prime movers in the
original disastrous scheme, needed but
a very little treatment to be trans-
formed into that of HARRY LAUDER,
one of the pillars and glories of the
variety stage—in fact, one might
almost say its BEN JONSON, if, as
is surely only just, we consider DAN
LENO as its SHAKSPEARE. Among
other transformed busts are those of
Mr. GoLLANcz, now GEORGE Robey,
and Mr. SPIELMANN, now LITTLE
TIcH.
The opening programme was of
record brilliance. The lion of the
evening was unquestionably LARRY
O'Connor, the Irish comedian, who
sang “What is Whisky 2 " with all
his incomparable humour, following
it with “The Green Petticoat '' and
“Kathleen of Killarney with the
wicked black Eye.” Among the
stars who supported him were
TRICKSY TRIXIE, the new comedienne;
Sol, LAZARUs, the Jewish patter
humourist; HUz and BUz, back-
answer specialists; and the famous
Australian dancer and pose use GER-
TRUDE WATERs, the rage of Paris and
Vienna, in a series of Biblical horn-
pipes with waxwork effects. Drama
itself was not wholly absent, since
for twenty minutes Mr. MARRON
GLAssie and Company kept the
house in a roar with the comic
absurdities of a new sketch entitled
“Mother-in-Law's Kippers.” The
audience was enthusiastic and called
for the manager again and again, .
and it was long after midnight before
the curtain was allowed finally to
fall. London is heartily to be con-
gratulated on its latest place of
entertainment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
March 23.-Nothing can exceed com-
pleteness and weight of gravity with
which the House when it pleases can
lend itself to what Mr. CARLYLE de-
lighted to stigmatise as a simula-
crum. Haven't for long time heard
anything of Chinese Labour question.
As was set forth to-night, when pre-
sent Government came into power
they found 50,000 Chinamen in
Transvaal mines. These have been
reduced to 34,000, of whom 25,000
will this year go back to home and
beauty, the remaining 9,000 disap-
pearing by January, 1910. Labour
Members and Radicals, clamorous in
denunciation of Chinese Labour, have
accepted this process whilst lament-
ing the necessity of observing con-
tracts which accounts for its slow-
ness. Suddenly, unexpectedly, on
motion for second reading of Consoli-
dated Fund Bill, ALFRED LYTTELTON
appeared at the Table with solemn
announcement that he has “a very
grave matter to bring before the
House.” -
Turns out to be our old friend. It
happens that Peckham polls to-
morrow. Last time it so disported
itself, Chinese Labour question much
to front. Many votes filched from
Unionist candidate by representation
of the Heathen Chinee enslaved in
order that the pockets of a class pic-
turesquely described as helots of
Park Lane might be filled. An at-
tractive flash of poetic justice if
tables can be turned and votes recap-
tured at Peckham by denouncing
Government as false to their pledges,
as having climbed into office on back
of AH SING, leaving him to his fate
when they arrive.
On face of it, in view of figures
cited, this a little difficult. But at
election times, whether dated 1906 or
1908, elector too busy to bother about
facts. What he likes is bold state-
ment tersely put. Accordingly to-
night ALFRED LYTTELTON, more in
sorrow than in anger, not only de-
nounced Government for breaking
their pledges, but was understood to
have accused ASQUITH of deliberately
intending to do so at the moment
when he assented to re-enaction of
Ordinance.
A serious matter this. Had such
charges been bandied across the
dinner-table fisticuffs would have fol-
lowed. Conveyed in written form,
there would have been action for
libel. But Lor' bless you, we know
each other in the House of Commons.
It is the Unionists' little game to-
“Why This simian LAUGHTER 2"
(Quotation from remarks by Mr. Swift MacNeill.)
This is how, for some reason or another, Mr. Swift MacNeill (and no one else) saw the Unionist
Party on the night of the Peckham Election.
(With a certain melancholy precedent in mind, Our Artist, having the instinct of self-
preservation somewhat strongly developed, has discreetly abstained from showing the hon.
member himself.)
day. Two years ago the Liberals
were ready to start one on same lines.
Asquith, being, after all, only human,
a little restive under personal charge.
House, little more than half full, lis-
tened as languidly as if ALFRED were
stating an abstract case. Had
charges been embodied in Resolution
on which a division might be chal-
lenged, things would have been dif-
ferent. PRINCE ARTHUR knows better
than that. Not the man gratuitously
to provide opportunity for Govern-
ment ranks to close up and Ministers
to receive vote of confidence in their
policy on Chinese Labour question.
Peckham didn't want Resolutions.
What it hankered after were allega-
tions, and here they were plain and
plump. Fraud, Hypocrisy, Betrayal
were writ large in indictment of
Government.
This done, subject dropped. Con-
solidated Fund Bill read a second
time without further ado. Army
Annual Bill passed same stage with-
out remark; House adjourned at
twenty minutes past eight.
Business done. — The Heathen
Chinee once more; this time under
new auspices.
Tuesday. — House of Parliament
suddenly turned into House of
mourning. News flashed across land
and sea comes announcing death of
Duke of DEvoNSHIRE. Passed away
this morning at Cannes, remote from
the turmoil of London life. No time
to prepare requiem oration. What
had to be said and done must be
accomplished straightway. Better
thus. More fully in accord with the
simplicity of the nature of the states-
man lamented. In the Commons,
Questions over, Asquith in a score of
sentences voiced the feeling of the
silent audience that bared its head in
reverent memory. As PRINCE ARTHUR
said, “tribute to a great man de-
parted could not have been proffered
in terms more exquisitely or more
fittingly chosen.” As usual on these

—PRINCE ARTHUR himself rose to full
height. In the Lords a pall appro-
priately fell over the half-empty
Chamber. The shy March sun with-
drew behind the afternoon cloud.
Lack of opportunity to prepare
funeral orations more marked here
than in the Commons. It was Lord
Rosebery who, in unexpected speech,
uplifted the level of oratory. . No
detriment to effect of his speech that,
emotion overcoming him as he
thought of the lost colleague and
friend, there was occasionally diffi-
culty in catching the closing words
of his sentences.
The dead Duke had many honest
prejudices. One, most strongly
marked, was against speech-making,
whether he or other were the trans-
gressor. As RoseBERY said, “no
man spoke with so much previous
anguish or so much misery at the
time of utterance ’’-a picturesque
sentence that recalled the familiar
figure, whether at the Table of the
House of Commons or the House of
Lords.
Observing him at close range
through the varying circumstances of
thirty-four years of public life, I per-
ceived close resemblance to the third
Earl SPENCER, better known as Lord
ALTHORP, who to his personal distress
filled a large space in State affairs
during the first half of the nineteenth
century. Both were men whose in-
nate shyness gave something of clum-
siness to their manner. Both loved
field sports and desired nothing more
than to be left to enjoy them.
Both were reluctantly dragged into
public life by a sense of duty.
Equally devoid of personal ambition,
both, to their pained surprise, found
themselves exalted to the position of
Leader of their Party in the House
of Commons. Both won the esteem
and confidence of political friends and
foes by the simplicity of their man-
ner, the integrity of their mind.
One night whilst ALTHoRP led the
House he had occasion to make a
statement on a matter of fact which
he had intended to support by cita-
tion of a document. When he
reached the appointed place he dis-
covered he had forgotten to bring the
paper with him. This would have
embarrassed some men. ALTHORP,
with the imperturbability we have
seen revived in HARTINGTON, ex-
plained the accident, and assured the
House that if he had only been in a
position to cite the particulars they
would have found them convincing.
His word was instantly and fully
accepted. If ALTHORP said so, so it
Was. -
The story is part of the life of Lord
ALTHoRP. To those who knew him
in either House it will be recognised
in every detail (not excepting the

ment in his pocket) as characteristic
of the statesman whose earlier name,
Lord HARTINGTON, most readily
comes to tongue or pen.
Business done.—Lords adjourn in
token of respect to memory of Duke
of DEvoNshire. The Commons
busy themselves with Bill that, had
he lived to deal with it, would have
had his warm support—the Children's
Charter.
House of Lords, . Thursday.—Not
heard much of late of Young
WEMYss. Silence accounted for.
Been hatching a joke. Out to-day in
Bill printed and circulated (at public
expense), entitled an Act to Transfer
all Private Property to a Commis-
sion. Lengthy preamble. Only one
clause: , This sets forth that property
of all kinds, private and State, shall
at the end of fourteen years be trans-
ferred to a permanent Commission,
who shall manage and distribute it in
the interests of Government and for
the public good.
Young WEMYss not the man to
evade consequence of his own crea-
tion. Does not forget one of old
time of whom it was written “He
had his jest and they had his estate.”
Means to afford practical illustration
of working of his proposed scheme.
To that end, so SARK tells me, he is
prepared, in anticipation of the date
mentioned in Bill, to hand over his
private property to be dealt with in ac-
cordance with its provisions. No. 23,
St. James's Place, will shortly be
in the market. Gosford House and
Amisfield House, both situated in
Haddingtonshire, will have new
tenants. Closed will be the hos-
pitable doors of Elcho Castle, Perth.
Neidpath Castle, Peebles-shire, will
go the way of Hayes Lodge, whilst
Stanway Hall will, figuratively of
course, absolutely as far as its pre-
sent proprietor is concerned, sink in
Moreton-in-the-Marsh.
Not often that a Member of either
House bringing in a Bill is in position
so strikingly to illustrate its working.
Business done.—Cost of Irish Ad-

An indignant correspondent, writ-
ing to The Mansfield Reporter about
the Licensing Bill, says of the pre-
sent Government :-
“The sword of Demosthenes already hangs
over its head, and 'tis to be hoped will soon

improve his elocution; the sword
swallower of the circus is a later

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MY FUR COAT.
(By “Mr. Punch's "Charivariety Artiste.)
A Rich uncle left it me; and I re-
member we thought it a very mean
legacy, and we only went into half-
mourning. As for the coat, “I
shan’t take it,” I said. “I hate all
wearers of fur coats. I shall re-
nounce the legacy.” “You will do
nothing of the sort,” said my wife.
“I don't want to look like a beastly
millionaire,” I said. “And wh
not?” asked my wife. “Well, we #
see,” I said weakly.
The thing was a long while
coming. I imagine that for a time
the two executors wore it on alternate
days as one of the perquisites of
office. Anyhow, they had not taken
great care of it. “I think,” said I,
on viewing the coat, “that my uncle
would have done better to present
this to the Natural History Museum
for research purposes,” and I angrily
removed a couple of moths with the
words, “My coat, please.” “Non-
sense,” said my wife; “it 's been
neglected a bit, that 's all. We'll
have it done up, and made to fit you ''
—my uncle was a very stout man–
“ and in the cold weather you 'll be
very pleased to have it. After all,
why shouldn't you look like a gentle-
man?” “Very well,” I said; “only
I haven't the remotest idea what to
feed it on, or anything of that sort,
and you had better try and find out
what is the best handbook on the
subject.”
It came back from the extermina-
tors as good as new, and I entered
into a compromise with my wife,
under the terms of which she was not
to insist on my wearing the coat in
Town, but I agreed to take it with
me on a lecturing tour on which I
was just embarking. As a matter of
fact I found it extremely useful on
my tour. It certainly added to
my prestige: It undoubtedly made
me look almost worth my money. At
the same time it was not all lavender.
The coat, I should mention, was an
extremely valuable one, and, at
moments when I was striving to
amuse my audience, a pained expres-
sion would suddenly cross my face.
I would be wondering whether some
vile fellow was not, perhaps, making
off with my coat from the little room
at the back. It was the old tale, so
to say, of the clown making merry
behind the footlights while his
favourite child was dying at home.
However, no one guessed the value
of the coat, and it survived my tour.
That was last year.
This year opened with weather of

exceptional severity. “You 'll be a
fool if you don't wear your fur coat,”
said my wife. The implied compli-
ment that I was not always a fool
pleased me, coming from such a
quarter—and, besides, it was very
cold, and I had got over my initial
repugnance to the thing. So I took
to wearing my fur coat in Town, and
I have come to like it. My friends
declare that it is exercising a subtle
influence on my character, and that
I who used to be so modest am
becoming arrogant.
Naturally at first I had to run the
gauntlet of a number of ill-natured
remarks and feeble jests from my ac-
quaintance. The sleeves of the over-
coat had a way of working them-
selves up so that the sleeves of the
under-coat protruded. I pointed this
out to a man who I thought could,
perhaps, suggest a remedy. He put
his ear to my shoulder and listened.
Then he turned a grave face to me,
and said, “Ah, I thought sol '!
“What is it?” I cried anxiously.
“Why, it 's the moths,” he said;
“I distinctly heard the little beggars
.# ! Now then, all together,
pull l’”
Another so-called friend sent his
little boy round to me one day with
his butterfly net and an insulting re-
quest. Yet another acquaintance
asked me, “What is the name of
your coat—Fido or Dinah 2 '' and
another, “I suppose it can catch
mice as well as moth ?”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
“Toby, M.P.,” was never a dog that cared much for
dry bones; and his Memories of Eight Parliaments
(HEINEMANN) does not pretend to be a work of academic
erudition. For chronology, as such, he wouldn't give
you a collar-button, and his cheerful contempt for
pedantry is reflected in a fluency of style which betrays
no sign of superfluous lucubration. Yet his head is a
veritable treasure-house of Parliamentary knowledge; for
up aloft there, from his vantage-place of looker-on who
sees most of the game, he has allowed little that was
worth noting to elude his watchful eye. But Mr. Lucy
(“for it is he ”) has also enjoyed, as few other journal-
ists, a personal acquaintance with the best politicians
matical imitation of the Doctor's stilted language, plenti-
fully seasoned with such words as beastly, frightfully,
kids, spiffing, swizz, chouse, blub, curious, decent, and
so forth, and in everything that they do or say or write
they must unconsciously serve as the butt of their
creator, the author's, humour. At least that is the
fate of the twelve Merivale boys who tell the stories
in what they would call the book of PHILLPoTTs. I am
not denying that they are human or that their stories
are fairly amusing, but I do wish that the next time
Mr. PHILLPOTTs wants to talk about boys he would try
to be a little more up-to-date instead of giving us the
Magazine Boy again.
While I admire extremely the ingenuity which Mr.
A. C. Fox-DAvies has brought to the making of the
series of episodes contained in his book The Finances
of Sir John Kynnersley
of every shade; and it
must be accounted to him
for virtue that he has so
little to say about himself.
He even underestimates,
in his title, the length of
his experience, which has
extended over mine Parlia-
ments. And his discretion
is such that it would be
a hard matter to decide
from the internal evidence
of his book what are his
own political leanings. He
appears to be a Liberal-
Conservative, with a slight
bias in favour of Unionist-
Radicalism. His judgment
is as kindly as it is catho-
lic; and Lord Rosebery,
whom he describes as a
“tireless worker,” should
not be the only one to
give him credit for erring,
if at all, in excess of ap-
probation. So infectious,
it would seem, is the at-
mosphere of geniality that
emanates from Mr. Punch.

on earth Mr. EDEN PHILLPOTTs and sundry other
less eminent writers of school stories get their
raw material. I suspect that they must dig it up
from the back numbers of the sixpenny magazines.
There, of course, I have often read of the sort of school
(where the ages of the boys range from eight to eighteen)
which Mr. PHILLPOTTs calls “Merivale.” The school-
sergeant, “who was old and had seen battle, and had
a grey moustache and medals and a fiery expression,”
is a very old friend. So is the Doctor. I know by
heart the sesquipedalian phrases which he will give away
with the prizes, and I should feel defrauded if his
daughter Milly were not secretly engaged to the rot-
tenest kid in the school. Also, “me being older than
her,” I know that the boys cannot help themselves. It
isn't that they will be boys. They 've got to be boys,
and go in for keeping guinea-pigs, and fighting, and
scoring off the masters, though all these pastimes have
long ago ceased to be part of the ordinary public-school
curriculum. And their conversation must be an ungram-
- with the money markets;
and, when he deliberately pirates copyright books and
resells them to publishers, then I say that he does not
deserve the G.C.B. which he gets for a fortuitous service
rendered to the War Qffice. Still, I read every word of
the book, and enjoyed nearly all of them. Among the
exceptions, were those which went to the composition
of split infinitives.
“The Throne” on “Diana of Dobson’s.”
“Somewhere, or other, she has read or heard a quotation, “one
crowded hour of glorious life.' She does not know it is Tennyson's.”
But she might have thought it was, and that would be
almost as bad.
“Upon the removal of the cloths, everything went with an esprits de
corps, which, notwithstanding an hour's extension, the hour of departure
arrived all too soon, toast, song, and recitation so agreeably blending
as to form a most pleasant evening.”—The Tonbridge Free Press.
We are afraid that the esprits were too strong for the
corps in one instance.

THE SWAINS’ REFUGE.
“ENGAGED '' recently wrote to a
contemporary to complain of the
distressing condition of similarly
betrothed couples, who have to
wander through interminable streets
in all weathers or waste money, that
they would rather save, at places of
entertainment, for lack of a club or
institution of unquestionable respect-
ability for the benefit of the matri-
monially-inclined.
We are happy to assure such
sufferers (and their bereaved rela-
tives) that an establishment of the
kind will very shortly be opened.
With this purpose in view the Keep-
ing Company Company (strictly
limited) is in process of formation.
Already the rush of applicants is so
great that prospective shareholders
may be seen daily extending in a
long coo down Maiden Lane, where
the offices of the Company are situ-
ated.
The rules of the proposed Club,
the premises of which will adjoin the
Tête-à-Téte Gallery, are as fol-
lows:—
1.—NAME.
The Club shall be called “The
Armshouse, London,” with the
motto “Between Four Eyes.”
2.—OBJECTs.
The Objects embraced by the Club
shall be those commonly observed in
silent communion in the more shel-
tered parts of the public parks.
These shall be facilitated by the
judicious arrangement of screens in
the Club-rooms.
3.—QUALIFICATIONS For MEMBERSHIP.
Candidates shall have proposed
and been accepted, in pairs, and
shall have become a nuisance to
their respective families.
4.—ORIGINAL MEMBERs.
All the other members shall ap-
pear original, not to say quaint, to
any particular couple. Each pair,
however, will constitute a world in
itself, and, as far as possible, ignore
the rest of the Club.
5.—LIFE MEMBERSHIP.
There shall be no Life-members.
6.—ExTRAoRDINARY GENERAL
MEETINGs.
All the meetings of any fiancé and
fiancée shall be, in their own eyes,
of extraordinary importance, and the
same shall apply generally.
7.—ExPULsion.
Any member jilting another shall
ipso facto be suspended from the
use of the Club premises. The
presence of the party jilted shall also
be considered superfluous, as roving
or unattached members may cause
complications.
8.—RETIREMENT.
Every couple, if and when their
banns are published for the third
time, shall automatically retire.

MID-DEvoN, Worcester, Hastings, Leeds,
Beheld the Liberals chew the dust;
Lightly we did heroic deeds, -
As men who knew their cause was just ;
Good was it then to be a Tory,
Fighting for issues clean and clear;
But now the swelling scroll of glory
Is badly soiled with Beer.
Silent our foemen bore the shock
Like losers in a decent game;
Now Malice gets her chance to mock
A crowning triumph smirched with shame;
Another victory such as Peckham
Is like to cost the Party dear,
And see our hopes—naught else could wreck 'em—
Swamped in a swill of Beer.
I hold no brief for Asquith's Bill;
If England wants to cure a vice,
Why then let England have her will,
But let her pay the current price;
I sniff aloud at virtuous robbery,
But most I loathe the easy sneer
That twits us with the taint of jobbery
Which seems to lurk in Beer.
Give me a fighting line that asks
No aid from semi-savage types,
Who, rolling up their reeky casks,
Poison the wells with pungent swipes;
To shift our simile to Ocean—
There 's better stuff on which to steer
Straight for the fruity land of Goshen
Than bulging seas of Beer.
God save us from our so-called friends !
I'd sooner miss the shoreward flood
Than use, to gain the best of ends,
Methods that smack of malt and mud;
Sooner I'd lie on sea-weed pillows
In Davy's locker dank and drear
Than bound across the bar on billows
Mainly composed of Beer.

SAVE US FROM OUR FRIENDS. HOTEL STATISTICS.
[Being the bitter plaint of a temperate Unionist on the alleged WonderFUL as have been the new London hotels
during the past few years nothing has been done hitherto
to compare in magnificence, luxury and splendour with
the new Pall Mall Hotel, now rapidly approaching com-
pletion. In mileage of electric wires alone it is more
remarkable than any other, while if its myriad chimneys
were placed vertically on end they would, it is conjec-
tured, go some distance towards reaching the moon.
This curious and unparalleled fact should of itself fill
the hotel throughout the season. The bricks used in
building the Piccadilly hotel would, it has been stated,
if placed longways in a straight line, extend from
London to Buda Pesth—that is, of course, if the direc-
tion was right, although how the difficulties of the
Channel are to be surmounted is not said. But the
bricks used in building the Pall Mall hotel would (if
sufficient space were left between them) put a girdle
clean round the earth, or, without any intervening space,
reach not only to Buda Pesth but back again These
facts have only to be known to have the proper result.
The decorations of the Pall Mall Hotel are also of the
most sumptuous. In every bedroom will be a wash-
hand stand supplied with real water, thus rivalling some
of the most famous and realistic effects of the melo-
dramatic stage. The furniture of even the cheapest
bedroom, if we may use so common an adjective, is
Louis Quatorze or Quinze, the latter being a sovereign
more. Everything that art can do has been done.
There are so many bedrooms that if all the carpets
were made into a patchwork quilt and spread over
London it would extend from Hampstead Heath to
Sydenham, and East Ham to Putney. Fact. The
passages are so lengthy and numerous that it would
take a man walking at the rate of four miles an hour a
week to traverse them completely.
Who could choose to go to another hotel after that?
Moreover, special interpreters for the use of American
visitors are to be stationed cn every floor, with plovers'
eggs and iced “watter ’’ always ready. Plovers have
been engaged by the tens of thousands in Scotland and
elsewhere, and are at the present moment laying eggs
as fast as they can against the opening of the hotel.
Other alluring peculiarities of the Pall Mall Hotel
will be its cuisine de luze, special receptacles for every
article of food having been designed by some of the
first artists of the land. Thus its salt-cellars are of
pure gold, and into every finger-bowl will be dropped
Attar of Roses at a guinea a drop. It has been well
said that the Pêche Melba dishes and Cantaloupe melon
bowls will be of more than passing interest to its clients
—so much so, indeed, that a large staff of trained
detectives will be always in the vestibule.
But we have said enough to convince Londoners that
their interests are being well looked after by the hotel
proprietors of the present moment. No one who has a
few bank-notes in his pocket need ever starve, or sleep
on an Embankment seat.
“Thus the rats at the docks are responsible for nearly £60 worth of
damage a day, or, in round figures, £3,000 a year.”—Daily Mail.
Even leaving out Sundays and Bank Holidays, and
giving them a week at the seaside, we get rounder
figures than that.

WonderFUL NEW INVENTIONs.
THE marvels of the new SIMPson
gun, expounded by Colonel MAUDE in
the current number of The Contem-
porary Review, have already at-
tracted considerable attention in
military circles. But the invention
is vitiated at the outset by the fatal
objection that its efficacy rests in the
last resort on its purely destructive
power. We are glad to be able to
announce that various alternative
methods of attaining the same de-
sirable end by purely pacific means
have already been devised, and will
shortly be tested by a Select Com-
mittee appointed by the War Office,
and consisting of Lord RossLYN, the
Marquis Townshend, Mr. HoRATIO
BottomLEy, M.P., Mr. Swift MAC-
NEILL, M.P., the Countess of WAR-
WICK, Mr. STEPHEN Col.FRIDGE, and
Mr. WIGGLEsworth D'ARcy.
Recent developments in the pro-
gress of wireless telephony have sug-
gested to an eminent novelist, who
for the present desires to remain
anonymous, the happy thought of
reciting select passages from his
most famous works to audiences in
all the most turbulent storm centres
of the world. By means of an
auxetophone attachment he is en-
abled so to magnify the tones of his
voice that it can be transmitted to a
distance of 30,000 miles, and on
arrival will be distinctly audible at a
radius of 200 miles. Tentative ex-
periments on the savage Chunchuses
in Mongolia and the ferocious clans
on the North-West Frontier of India
have been attended with the most
gratifying results. Seventeen of the
most desperate Chunchuses fled pre-
cipitately into the depths of Lake
Baikal, and a large bevy of intransi.
gent Afridis committed hari-kiri with
unanimous enthusiasm. Embold-
ened by these preliminary triumphs
the inventor now proposes to try the
effect of his method on the Amazons
of Dahomey, the insurgents of Mis-
sispanca, the dacoits of Burmah, and
other irreconcilable tribes. A re-
markable feature of the new inven-
tion is that by the employment of a
sound-proof chamber at the trans-
mitting station the operator does not
lacerate the tympanums of the sur-
rounding population.
Hardly less epoch-making than the
Manx telephone is the new Improved
Astral Body Projector which has
been recently perfected by Messrs.
Gosling and QUACKENBUsch. This
astonishing instrument, which has no
recoil, and causes no explosion what-
ever, enables the operator not merely
to project his astral body to un-
heard-of distances, but to expand and
inflate his cranium and features to an
altogether exorbitant extent, causing
the assembled spectators at the re-
ceiving station to fall into a state of
obtuse apathy. A detailed account
of the apparatus, from the talented
pen of Major Colney HATCHAM, will
shortly appear in the Wapping Lyre.

The May number of the Earlswood
Review will contain an electrifying
article on his new musical instrument
the Jumbophone, by the inventor,
Captain Woolley Dodd'ER. The
Jumbophone, which in appearance
suggests a combination of a bom-
bardon and a theodolite, is composed
entirely of fluorescent brown paper,
with a kedgeree mouthpiece and
vulcanite valves. Its timbre is sin-
gularly luscious, and the inventor
confidently expects that his instru-
ment will finally supersede the kibob,
the balalaika, and the octoroon. We
understand that a concerto for the
Jumbophone, by Herr JAMRACH, will
shortly be included in the programme
of one of the London Symphony
Orchestra's concerts.

A DOMESTIC PROBLEM.
For days and weeks the cloud
Was always growing bigger,
MIRANDA's head was bowed,
And trouble bent her figure.
Her courage all was cowed,
The crisis grew acuter,
For she must tell the wedded pair
Who kindly cooked our homely fare,
And made the beds and brushed the
stairs,
They really did not suit her.
Thick lay the lurid dust,
The rugs were brown and muddy,
The tongs were red with rust,
The very grates were ruddy;
And oh! the thing called crust
That filled the sodden pie-dish
Few, few the things that we could eat;
Impossible the blackened meat
MIRANDA lived on bread and beet,
While apple-sauce was my dish.
Yet how were we to part
With all this imbecility?
MIRANDA had a heart
Compact of sensibility.
Some mistresses are tart
In their domestic dealings,
Some treat their Abigails as dirt,
Are rough, abusive, crude and curt—
But she would rather die than hurt
The meanest mortal's feelings.
My wife, I may explain,
Requires but small incentive
To exercise a brain
Incredibly inventive.
Again and yet again
MIRANDA started planning:
“Let's swear you 've been ap-
pointed—say, ,
Prime Minister of Mandalay,
Or that we're off to Hudson Bay
To practise walrus canning.”
Then, after days of thought
And nights of deep dejection,
A plan MIRANDA caught,
A counsel of perfection.
“I’ll say the post has brought
Some news that 's very grievous:
My mother thinks of coming here
To settle down with us—poor dear!—
She brings her maids, which means,
I fear,
That you will have to leave us.”
At lunch and dinner we
Discussed the tale and plotted,
We crossed with care each t
And every i we dotted.
But soon we were to see
Love's labour lost. Next morning
Our wedded pair appeared in view
And crudely gave us notice. “You
Are not what we 're accustomed to,
And so we give you warning.”

The Daily Mirror of April 2 has un-

Monday evening to discuss Mr.

They recognise each other by a badge
containing a photograph of their idol
and a shield emblematic of three of
his most popular plays plus the
pansy, his favourite flower. They
are further distinguished by the
mystic initials K. O. W., which
stand for “Keen Order of Waller-
ites,” or, according to another inter-
pretation, “Keen On Waller.” These
devoted ladies, however, are pledged
never to speak to the object of their
admiration, which, they are careful
to explain, is for the actor and not
the man, nor to embarrass him by

MY IDEAS FOR A SHAKSPEARE MEMORIAL.
No one, I am perfectly aware, has expressed the least
desire to hear my views on this, or any other, subject;
but, after all, if I waited for that 1 . . . . And, in this
particular instance, I have some ideas which I really do
think are worth considering. You may not agree with
me there, but I hope that at least you will not decline to
listen to them.
I gather that, at present, although all the distin-
guished persons whose opinion has been consulted are
in favour of a National Memorial, they differ consider-
ably as to the precise form such a memorial should take:
Some approve of a Statue, on condition that it is erected
on a spot more frequented by SHAKSPEARE, when alive,
than Portland Place—such as the Embankment. Others
object to any effigy in human semblance, preferring
something symbolical—which I suppose would be in the
nature of a gigantic swan. Others again will not hear
of anything but a National Theatre, in which all of
SHAKSPEARE's plays could be presented in their entirety.
While a fourth section will only consent to a Theatre,
provided that it has a statue of SHAKSPEARE in the
vestibule.
Now my plan combines the advantages and avoids the
drawbacks of all these schemes.
First, I think we are all agreed on one point. If as a
nation we are going to do the thing at all, we must do it
well. We must go on as we mean to begin. After call-
ing in all the Intellect and Culture of the United
Kingdom, and appealing for contributions to the whole
civilised world, we cannot be content with some such
compromise as a SHAKSPEAREAN Cycle (for subscribers
only) at the Royalty Theatre, or an unobtrusive drinking-
fountain in Finsbury Park. That would be almost an
anti-climax. No, our memorial should be grandiose,
imposing, sublime; something to strike the imagination
of the ages to come. If we can't rise to that we should
do very much better to leave it alone altogether.
Very well, then. The next point is the site. This
should be as high as possible. I first thought of
Primrose Hill; but that possesses a SHAKSPEARE Tree
already. It is unnecessary to pamper Primrose Hill.
There is Tooting Bec, but we have no records showing
that SHAksPEARE had any intimate associations with
Tooting Bec. And it is not nearly so high as Campden
Hill. That is the site I should select. It is true that it
is not mentioned by SHAKSPEARE, but it must have been
there in his time, and he could have gone up it if he had
felt disposed. If he was fond of exercise he probably
did. There are Waterworks with a lofty tower on it
now ; but these could surely be removed. It would cost
something, no doubt, but if we are really sincere in our
determination to do honour to the World's Greatest
Dramatist, we shall not allow any sordid questions of
expense to stand in our way. You agree to Campden
Hill, then 2 Thank you very much. Then, after clear-
ing the ground, we will proceed to erect our Memorial.
And, before doing so, we must make up our minds what
it is to be. I see it myself as a Statue. But no ordinary
statue. A figure immense, so colossal as to dominate
the whole Metropolis, and be seen from all points beyond
the six-mile radius—even the chauffeur of a “Taxi" will
know his way to it ! Bronze, of course, and at least
500 ft. high. I haven't worked it out, but I calculate
roughly that if every British subject in our dominions
were to contribute a copper the sum total would amount
to quite a handsome figure. And this without counting
all the pfennigs that would flow in from Germany,
where SHAkspeaRE is regarded as a Teutonic discovery.
This statue should, I think, be easily recognisable as
the Bard, though it need not resemble either the
Stratford bust or the effigy in Leicester Square. I
wouldn't have the legs crossed. I should represent
him seated, the chin supported by the left hand, while
the right (which would hold a pen) lies loosely on the
table before him. This would show him engaged in
thinking out the plot of his finest play, which of course
each spectator would be at liberty to imagine was his or
her own particular favourite. The features could be
idealised—that could be left to the sculptor—but with
one restriction, which is absolutely essential if my plan
is adopted. I mean, there must be no hair on the top of
the statue's head. Not so much because we know, if
the evidence of contemporaries can be trusted, that
SHAksPEARE, even in his prime, was never in much danger
of incurring the fate of ABSALOM, as for another reason
that will be apparent later on. If you must have your
swan it could be sitting at his feet under the table; but
this is by way of concession to the symbolists. Per-
sonally, I am against a swan... I think it superfluous. I
doubt if SHARspeARE himself could have composed in
any comfort with a swan so close to his ankles. I know
I couldn't.
We've got our statue. Now for the pedestal. This
need not be more than 150 feet high. I should treat it
in the Elizabethan or Jacobean style, with Renaissance
façades, and the interior would form the National
Theatre. Let the design be severe, rather like the
Prinz Regenten Theater at Munich, with plain tip-up
seats in Austrian bent wood, and a marble proscenium.
From the theatre-lobbies visitors would ascend by
hydraulic lifts and spiral staircases to the first floor of
the statue, which naturally would be hollow. This floor
would be on the level of SHAKSPEARE's waistband, and
contain the Library, furnished with a complete collec-
tion of all the volumes that have ever been written
about him in any language, also MSS., including (I
hope) the original MS. of the late Mr. _CURDLE's cele-
brated essay “On the Character of Juliet's Nurse's
Deceased Husband.” (I was so fortunate as to secure
this the other day at SoTHEBY's, and am open to offers.)
There would also be a platform, on which readings, in
morning dress, could be given of all the less known
dramas. The Library would be lighted not only by
electricity but from windows pierced through the slashes
and buttons on the statue's doublet.
A corridor through the right Arm would communicate
by an exit in the palm of the hand with the table. This
platform would serve as a spacious promenade, and
might be provided with a Summer Theatre (for Eliza-
bethan masques or variety entertainments), a band-
kiosk, and an open-air restaurant. Returning to the
Stomach, a lift would enable the visitor to reach the
Chest, which I should reserve as a School of Elocution,
where pupils could be instructed in the art of delivering
Blank Verse precisely as if it were Prose.
We then ascend to the Head, where there would be a
luxurious Winter Garden under a lofty glazed dome.
Now perhaps you will understand why I insisted upon
keeping the Statue bald. Think of the effect at night.
When illuminated, that mighty brain would be visible
for miles, apparently glowing with luminous fancies. No
city in the world, not even Rhodes or New York, could
boast a more majestic and impressive landmark
British sailors far out on the German Ocean might see
it, and bless the Bard that provided them with so noble
a beacon |
Altogether, I should expect my Colossal SHAKSPEARE
to rival the Great Wheel and Eiffel Tower as a public

attraction, especially on Bank Holidays, when it might
serve as an incentive to the study of his works for many
who are now content to witness them at the Lyceum

admission, booking for the theatre, pupils' fees, and the
sub-letting of the restaurants, refreshment bars, and
Shakspearean side shows, I am greatly mistaken if the
Statue does not pay for its own upkeep, and perhaps
even return an occasional dividend on the subscribed
capital.

THE LONG GUN AND THE MAN BEHIND IT.
It is really very hard on Mr. HALDANE that, just when
his Territorial Army comes into being, publicity should
be given to the fact that a Mr. SIMPson has invented a
wonderful gun with a range of 300 miles, which ought to
render armies of little use. It has not yet been tried,
however, and there is some discussion as to where the
test should take place, and on whom. Certain en-
thusiasts think the gun should be mounted in the High-
lands, and pointed at Burton-on-Trent, while another
view is that from the latter place it should try and find
East Fife. In Ireland, again, there is an opinion that,
fired from Waterford, its projectile might, with a favour.

ing wind, reach the House of Commons, and a trial is
solicited.
In any case we feel that the firing of the gun should
be entrusted to a thoroughly capable person. Surely
among our eminent journalists there are many whose
mastery of the art of “firing the long gun” would qualify
them for the work. What about the military corres-
pondent of The Times Or there is Lieut. Coulson

SIR,--I have been a life-long sup-
porter of the Liberal Party. It must
be nearly forty years ago that I first
recorded my vote against the Tories,
and it has been recorded against
them ever since. In the dark days
of the Home Rule split, when he
was deserted by many of his oldest
friends, I remained loyal to the great
GLAdstone. When the Boer war
burst upon us I was content to be
upon the unpopular side; I laboured
unceasingly for the cause during
those dreary days of opposition; and
I had my reward later in the know-
ledge that I was one of those who
had triumphantly returned the pre-
sent Government to power with the
greatest majority on record. But
now I have reluctantly come to the
conclusion that I can support them
no longer. I can be no party to a
system of organised robbery such as
is this Licensing Bill. At the
General Election, which cannot be
long delayed, I shall for the first time
in my life vote for the Conservatives.

SIR,-For fifty years I have been

not specify them here, but I may
say that the total sum of such
subscriptions would amount to a con-
siderable figure. Moreover, on at-
tending a place of worship I have in-
variably given with cheerfulness my
mite to the offertory. I regret that,
owing to Mr. Asquith's unauthorised
campaign of plunder, I, as a life-long
holder of Brewery shares, shall be
unable to continue these subscrip-
tions.—I am, etc.,

To the Editor of “The Daily Telegraph.”
SIR,-As a life-long Temperance
Reformer, Teetotaler, and Minister
of the Gospel, permit me to re-
cord my disgust at the present
Licensing Bill. If I could see in it
the smallest attempt to deal cour-
ageously with the Drink Traffic I
should be the first to support it. But
having considered the terms of it
carefully I am reluctantly forced to
the conclusion that if it passed into
law it would actually increase intem-
perance rather than diminish it.
I am, etc.,
DisgustEd MINISTER of THE Gospel.
IV.
To the Editor of “The Daily Telegraph.”
SIR,-As a life-long Brewer I would
welcome gladly any honest measure
of Licensing Reform. Though an
ardent Conservative I was prepared
to support such a measure, and, if
necessary, to vote and work against
my own party in order that it should
become law. But Mr. Asquith's
Bill is frankly ridiculous. Is it a
joke, or what? -
I am, etc.,
DisgustED BREWER.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY or Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
March 30.—Members never so re-
lieved in their lives as when they saw
Long John O'Connor walk out of the
House without having GEORGE
CLARK, shipbuilder and engineer,
tucked under his right arm. As
everyone knows, it is a little Parlia-
mentary mannerism invented and
cultivated by Long John. It 's his
way of moving the Closure. Earl
WINTERTON knows all about it. Last
Session, having raised Long John's
dander (whatever that may be), he
was himself uplifted, packed under a
muscular arm, and carried forth
kicking. At least I've seen a pic-
ture in a veracious weekly paper de-
scribing the scene. Anyhow, it is a
remarkable coincidence that the
Member for Horsham, up to that
period known as Wiscount TURNour,
immediately after changed his name,
and now meekly confronts the
Ministerialists under the style Earl
WINTERTON.
CLARK contributed to Home Rule
debate an interesting study of Irish
character. In the north, where they
make ships and things, the people
are, he said, thrifty and prosperous.
In the south and west they are lazy.
This too much for Member for Kil-
dare. Lifting his tall figure till its
monumental six feet eight and a-half
brought his head in dangerous con-
tiguity to the overhanging gallery,
he casually observed that Mr. CLARK
was a coward. Captain CRAIG,
having recovered from physical ex-
haustion following on effort earlier in
the sitting to envelop ST. AUGUS-
TINE’s reluctant figure in the folds of
the Union Jack, appealed to Deputy
Speaker to say whether such remark
was in order.
Long JoHN gloried in his iniquity.
“I admit it,” he shouted.
Mr. REDDY's shrill voice led storm
of cheering from Irish camp. When
Deputy Speaker succeeded in getting
a look in he ordered Long John to
withdraw the offensive expression.
“No,” said the Monument,
shaking its cupola more in sorrow
than in anger (for everyone likes Mr.
EMMOTT, and would in ordinary cir-
cumstances hasten to oblige him), “I
will not withdraw.”
“Then I must name you, Mr.
John O'Connor,” said the Deputy
Speaker.
Customary procedure in such cir-
cumstances is for Leader of House to
move rule suspending the offending
Member from further attendance.
Motion to that effect would be put,
Balfour. “Don’t you feel awfully embar-
rassed carrying that horrid thing about?
Mine's bad enough, but that's simply beastly "
Asquith. “Never felt less embarrassed in
m"life, dear boy! Have you seen the board at
the back? That's where the fun comes in 1"
House would divide, and twenty
minutes would be lost. Whilst
Asquith was hurriedly hunting up
the text of rule, Long John arose in
his might and strode towards the
gangway, above which GEORGE S.
CLARK, shipbuilder, sat wishing there
was a tug in sight.
Was he literally “going for ” him?
WINTERTON secretly wished he might
be. Friendly and nice that another
fellow should know what the method
of locomotion towards the door was
like. Captain CRAIG, late of the
North of Ireland Imperial Yeomanry,
instantly took command of the de-
fence. He threw out MooRE (the
term is used in its military sense) on
the right front, directly in the path-
way of the advancing force. For
himself he took up a position in the
rear whence, as he remarked, he
could obtain a more undisturbed
view of the situation.
These manoeuvres proved unneces-
sary. Long John, having reached
the gangway, wheeled sharply to

the right, bowed to the Chair, and
walked out of the House unaccom-
panied.
Business done.—John REDMOND
moved resolution designed to pledge
Liberal Party afresh to Home Rule.
PRINCE ARTHUR gleefully regarded
Asquith as being in what he de-
scribed as a tight place. Warned
him would be no use meeting situa-

Of course, with due safeguarding

liament, Ireland will some day get

ment.
Tuesday.—Just a quarter of a cen-
tury since GLADSTONE, then in the
prime of power politically, physically
and intellectually, brought in an
Irish University - Bill. Iłejected on
second reading, it dealt, in boome-
rang fashion, a fatal blow to the
tottering edifice of , one of the
strongest Ministries of the century.
Mr. G. resigned office, and Dizzy

the mind as ST. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL
walks up floor of House bringing his
sheaves with him in shape of another
Irish University Bill. A general cheer
greeted him. Only Black Ulster
sat in ominous silence. Since the
historic failure of 1873 other
Ministers have attempted to deal
with thorny question of University
Education in Ireland. The latest
was BRYcE, who immediately after
indicating his scheme fled to sanc-
tuary in Washington.
One is never sure of anything re-
lating to Ireland, more especially in
respect of legislation. Teally it does
look as if this time ST. AUGUSTINE
had come by his own. On conclusion
of his speech explaining details of
the scheme, a strange thing hap-
pened. In succession PRINCE ARTHUR,
John DILLON, BUTCHER, WILLIAM
O’BRIEN, WYNDHAM and CARson rose
up and called the Bill blessed.
Only Ulster grim, implacable in
opposition. Its hostility was voiced
by MooRE, after rapid survey of
bench below gangway where Long
John sits. It is not usual to oppose
introduction of a Bill. Members,
assuming a virtue if they have it
not, admit it will be just as well to
know exactly what they are fighting
before opening fire. Accordingly
they allow the first reading as a pre-
liminary to having the Bill printed,
thus securing opportunity for study-
ing its detai). Ulster knew all about
the Irish University Bill without
wasting time upon its text. Regarded
it as a surrender to the Roman
Catholic Bishops, and would have no
dealing with the accursed thing. It
went into the Lobby against the
first reading, and came out twenty-
four strong against a muster of 307.

As in 1886, “Ulster will fight.”

would not continue quotation of his
famous distich, “and Ulster will be

Business done.—Irish University
Bill introduced amid chorus of ap-
proval, varied by one note of discord.
House of Lords, Thursday.—“Sup-
pose,” said Mr. Pecksniff to Martin
Chuzzle wit on the introduction of
the new pupil to the office, “suppose
you were to give me your idea of a
monument to a Lord Mayor of
London; or a tomb for a Sheriff; or
your notion of a cow-house to be
erected in a nobleman's park.”
UNDILUTED WITRIOL.
There is no point of resemblance
between Lord DARTMoUTH and the
architect and surveyor of Salisbury
beyond the attitude of interrogation
and a habit of suddenly submitting
posers. Noble lord . came down
bristling with a sort of Shorter
Catechism designed for searching the
mind of Under-Secretary for War.
In the catalogue queries were num-
bered up to five. Actually, with
subsidiary questions they ran up to
a score, covered the whole field on
which is bivouacked the new Terri-
torial Army. The Catechism, near-
ing in length the proportions of
Speech from the Throne, covered
more than page of folio paper. At
end of fourth group of questions
DARTMOUTH, with possibly unconsci-
ous echo of the directness and
brevity of a query that has come
down through the ages, suddenly
asked—
“What is a unit 2 ''
PoRTSMOUTH gasped for breath, as
indeed DARTMoUTH had done when he
worked off the penultimate volley
leading up to this heavy round shot,
“What is a unit?” He might,
quoting the dictionary, have replied,
“A single thing or person; the least
whole number; one.”
That would have been a mean way
of slinking out of a quandary.
PortsMoUTH is not Hereditary Bailiff
of Burley, New Forest, for nothing.
Feels he must live up to his reputa-
tion.
“In its ordinary military sense,”
he answered, fixing DARTMoUTH with
gleaming eye, “unit is a somewhat
elastic term, depending for its pre-
cise significance on the context with
which it is used.”
DARTMOUTH's turn now to display
emotion. If he had been in the
House of Commons it would have
been suspected that he was sud-
denly smitten with gooseberry mil-
dew. Limp he sat and speech-
less, what time PortsMoUTH ambled
on to the end of his reply. The col-
lapse is, however, only temporary.
He is thinking of an impromptu re-
tort. We may have it next week. If
not, it may be looked for after

MY FUR COAT.
II.
OF course I did not wear my fur
coat with absolute confidence all at
once. That came gradually. At
first I suffered cruelly from self-con-
sciousness, and I imagined that every
passer-by was trying to solve the
roblem: Is he a Nobleman, or a
raudulent Bankrupt? I dared not
smoke a big cigar with it. And when,
in accordance with my custom, I read
my Daily Mail in the train, I im-
agined the thought of everyone
seated opposite to be, “Fancy that
wealthy man reading only a half-
penny paper He 's one of those
mean millionaires, I suppose.” Some-
times this idea got on my nerves to
such an extent that I would buy two
copies of The Daily Mail instead of
one. But now I have
gave the functionary who helped me
on with my coat at the Savoy a shil-
ling, he looked so glum that I had to
say, “Sorry, but I've got no gold
with me.” And then there are the
cabbies! And one windy morning
my new silk hat blew off. Now a
man in a fur coat cannot be seen run-
ning after a hat. I had to let it go,
and to pretend that its loss was a
mere bagatelle to me, and that I
usually bought two or three of them
in the course of a day.
If only I could gain the respect of

to whom the sight of my coat seems
unpleasing. It appears to arouse
their worst passions, and I have even
been called “a blurry haristocrat.”
They refuse to realise that as honest

as beneath a dirty corduroy jacket.
cently troubles me somewhat. . I
dream that I am kidnapped by gipsies
who, after roughly manhandling me,
strip me of my fur coat, and drive
me forth to rejoin the ranks of the
Middle Classes. It is absurd how this
trifle worries me.
MR. PUNCH'S GREAT EXPERIMENTS.
IN common with all thoughtful
men we have been deeply moved by
the progress of that great enterprise,
The Daily Mail Farm. . We have
followed with breathless interest the
story set forth day by day of the
heroic tenant, selected in the face of
overpowering odds for his high mis-
sion, who was destined to leave behind
the pigs and daffodils of his back-yard
for a wider sphere. We have read
of the fourteen acres and the great
grown out of all such silly
fancies, and realise that the
wearing of the fur coat
means for me increased re-
spect with all classes ex-
cept the unwashed.
The Stationmaster, be-
cause he wore grander
clothes than I, used always
to cut me. Now he says
“Good morning '' to me,
even when it isn't. And
a pleasing incident took
place only yesterday. A
respectably dressed woman
said to her little boy who
was asking for his ticket
at the booking-office when
I arrived, “Let the gentle-
man take his ticket first,
John NIE.” And a dear
friend of mine who has

Exhibition.
ash-tree that were to be his
on Lady-day. We have
debated within ourselves
the wisdom of his decision
in starting with two cows.
We have mourned with
him in spirit over the two
stepsons who refused to go.
We have rejoiced with him
over the son in the chem-
ist's shop who has resolved
to share his fortunes.
Above all, in tender mo-
ments our eyes have filled
with tears at the contem-
plation of the two “tiny
girls’’ who will feed the
hens. They will do it.
They are determined not
to leave it to father. They
have already been prac-
tising in the parlour.
For by these humble in-
no fault of his own asked me the
other day whether he might walk a
little way with me in the City, as it
would improve his credit. Naturally
I consented, as I love to do these
little acts of kindness.
The coat undoubtedly does improve
one's credit. I had a striking ex-
ample of that not so long ago. I
went up to a newspaper vendor who
has a shop round a lamp-post, and
asked for an evening paper. When I
came to pay for it I found that I had
—as befitted me—nothing smaller
than half-a-crown, and the man had
not sufficient change. “Never
mind, guv'nor,” he said, “pay me
next time you pass.”
But the wearing of the fur coat is
also a shockingly expensive business,
and I sometimes wonder whether I
shall be able to keep it up. One has
so constantly to remember “Noblesse
oblige l’’ The other evening when I
How different is their bearing to that
of a hardworking class for whom I
have the greatest regard. I refer to
servant-girls, who eye all wearers of
fur coats admiringly. We are, I
fancy, the heroes of their novelettes.
In fact, when ruin faces me I shall, I
think, hire myself out to them for
walks at a shilling per hour, like a
soldier.
Meanwhile, as regards the unsatis-
factory attitude of the mob, this has
led, I think, to a feeling of solidarity
among wearers of fur coats. When
we meet, even though strangers, we
eye each other in a sympathising
manner; and, if the Revolution ever
breaks out, we shall, I fancy, be
found standing shoulder to shoulder,
and I dare swear that we shall give a
good account of ourselves when the
evil-smelling throng closes round us.
P.S.—An unpleasant dream which
has recurred night after night re-
struments The Daily Mail
will solve at last and for ever the
whole mass of tangled questions con-
cerning agricultural economics that
have baffled our legislators for a
century.
But there are other problems.
Now that The Daily Mail has shown
the way it seems a pity to waste the
time of Parliament in fruitless dis-
cussion, when by the new method
the whole thing can be done in the
course of a three years' lease. Why
all this talk about Education? What
need of this worry over the Licens-
ing Bill?
Let the nation look to us, and it
shall know the truth.
We have started a School.
For many weeks a large staff of
clerks has been at work sifting and
arranging the van-loads of applica-
tions which arrived every morning
at our door, and we have selected
our Schoolmaster. We feel that we

have found in him a thoroughly
representative man. “I have always
longed for a school of my own,” he
said when our decision was communi-
cated to him. “I used to be at
school myself, you know, when I
was a kid.” We hope that in the
course of the experiment the religious
difficulty will be attacked simul-
taneously from every side. Our
Schoolmaster is a Roman Catholic,
and his wife is an ardent supporter
of the Methodist cause. His son
early threw in his lot with the Ply-
mouth Brethren, and there is a great
divergence of religious opinion among
his five tiny girls who will conduct
the kindergarten branch. One of
them is said to be interested in
Christian Science. The two step-
sons—to their father's deep regret—
have emigrated to America. Our
representative called upon the School-
master yesterday. He found him in
his shirt-sleeves—a good sign in any
man. He was busy waxing the
business end of his cane. We hope
to publish, down to the smallest de-
tail, the progress of this family day
by day.
We have also opened a Public
House.
In this case we had more than
half a million applications to deal
with in the two days during which
our offer remained open. But we
have finally selected our Landlord.
We feel that we have in him a
thoroughly representative man. “I
have always longed for a pub of my
own,” he said, shaking us warmly
by the hand when our decision was
communicated to him. “Ever since I
was a little lad I've always longed for
a pub. It 's been a sort of dream of
mine.” Pressed to give some reason
for this laudable ambition, he replied
that he hated going out of the house
on wet nights. Our Landlord is a
father. His son, we are told, is
actively at work practising with a
corkscrew, and has already almost
mastered that instrument, while his
nine tiny girls are eagerly reading the
papers to discover if Mr. Asquith is
going to allow them to come into the
bar. His two stepsons—to their
father's great regret—have signed the
pledge. Our representative called
upon the Landlord yesterday and
found him with his boots off—a good
sign in any man. He was engaged
in painting his sign.
Detailed reports of the progress of
this venture will be published in our
columns.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Too often, when novelists carry us back to the studied
graces of a century ago, their characters lose in spon-
taneity what they gain in courtliness, but CLEMENTINA
BLAck has provided a very charming exception in
Caroline (MURRAY)—a lady who, defying her date,
which is 1780 or thereabouts, seems to step straight in
from the spring sunshine. And indeed she could never
have known a cloud at all, I suppose, had it not been
for that fatal tendency to eavesdropping which heroines
find it so difficult to resist—a, tendency traceable, I
think, more to their innate
I do not happen to have read any of Miss ELLEN
GLAsgow's .#. novels. If they are as good as The
Ancient Law (Constable) I regret the oversight. The
scene of the story is laid in the United States, and is
redolent of that country alike in its urban and its rural
aspect. The canvas is large, peopled with many figures;
but whether light sketches or elaborated studies they are
all real personages, if we except the unworthy people.
The villain of the piece, the ex-convict who dogs the
steps of Daniel Ordway, is tiresomely melodramatic.
The rich City man who runs off with Ordway's daughter
is conventional. But delightful is Beverley, whose
airy manner and gay selfishness are reminiscent of
Harold Skimpole. The interest of the story is kept up to
the last page. There were three
charity towards the plot than
to any laxity in their code of
morals. Caroline overhears
an apparently damning con-
fession from the lips of Gilbert
Hardy, and so accepts Lord
Pevensey, whom she does not
love a bit, though he is a very
great gentleman all the same.
Then a rather uncouth “detri-
mental,” with a taste for
smuggling on the sly, conceives
the idea of a forcible abduc-
tion, and Captain Hardy has
his chance. He comes to the
rescue post-haste, but in so
compromising a manner that
he is charged with the very
crime he is trying to frustrate.
So the book ends in a trial,
which would perhaps be more
exciting if we were not certain
that a lover who has rescued
a horse from a burning stable
when only a boy, and sub-
ºf - -.
º
sequently helped to relieve
Gibraltar, is bound to be
acquitted by a jury that
knows anything about novels
at all. However, nothing
can detract from the sweet-
ness and freshness of the
possible endings. Ordway might
have married the girl he fell in
love with ; he might have be-
come reconciled to his frigid
wife; or he might have died of
the fever caught in his last
effort of expiation. These would
have been commonplace con-
clusions. With artistic in-
stinct Miss GLAsgow finds a
better way, which the reader
will do well to search out.
The problem presented in
your ordinary murder - story
is, of course, a much more
elaborate affair than the classic
Cock-Robin case. Still, the
intelligent reader can generally
spot the murderer long before
the author has finished his
little game of fastening sus-
picion upon everyone but the
right person. But I confess
that the mystery of Garianni,
the foreign blackmailer, as set
forth in The Virgin Widow
(published by METHUEN, and
invented by Mr. RANDAL
CHARLTON), is beyond me. At
first I thought, greatly against
my will, that the widow her-

pleasant to remember, are still

Perhaps Mr. John, who tells the story, had been pull-
ing my leg all the time, and had fired the fatal shot
himself. But I was obliged to acquit him. There
wasn't a shred of evidence against him, and he, like
the other two, left the Court without a stain on his
character. After that I gave it up, as I rather think the
author meant me to do. All the same I am very glad
I read the book, which is clever and entertaining, and
does not lose in verisimilitude because it is unconven-
tional enough to leave the mystery unsolved.
Almost ready—by an anonymous author well-known
in Berlin Court circles—The first volume of “The
Letters that Should Not have been Written.”

To judge by a puzzle which is being
hawked about entitled “Find the
KAISER,” that august personage is
very much cut up, and it is easy to
believe the rumours that he has de-
cided to bring his career as a Man
of Letters to an end.

PRINCE EDWARD or WALEs is now
completely recovered, and we are
somewhat surprised that it did not
occur to a certain ultra-loyal news-
paper to publish a photographic en-
largement of one of the royal measles.

At the recent fire at the house of
Mr. Somerville, a master at Harrow,
a number of the boys, it is stated,

teresting to know how many school-
books were rescued.

There has just died, the news-
papers tell us, at the age of eighty-
nine, a gentleman who never slept
out of his own house. We trust this
does not mean that he never went to
church.

“A pure milk supply would be a
great aid to temperance,” says The
Essex County Chronicle. This con-
firms an opinion we have long held
that topers would at once give up
the nasty beer and spirits if we could
only guarantee the purity of the glass
of milk we offer them.

“There is many a quack who is as
good as a doctor,” declared Mr. Jus-
tice RIDLEY last week, and the quacks
and the doctors are not quite sure for
which of them the compliment was
intended.

A project is being considered for
the transference of the celebrated
Jardin des Plantes to a site three
miles outside Paris, where it is in-
tended to create a “Zoological
Oasis,” in which the animals can
have comparative liberty. One
feature of the “Oasis '' is to be a
large hot-house in which all kinds of
butterflies would be reared. It is to
be hoped that due precautions will be
taken to prevent these fighting with
the lions.

A wave of excitement is passing
over theatrical circles. Actors and
critics alike can scarcely live for
pleasurable anticipation. “Fluffy

cess, is to come to London.

Mr. Justice JELF visited the
Oxford Music Hall last week in order

The De Beers Company is now
being urged to reduce the price of
diamonds “so as to bring them
within the reach of the masses in
Europe and America.” We cannot
help thinking, however, that when
everyone wears them the effect of the
constant glitter and sparkle will have
a deplorable effect on our eyesight;
on the other hand, as Mr. Asquith
would say, your De Beers will cost
you less.

SELECTIONS FROM MR. ASQUITH'S
LETTER-BAG.
No. I.
DEAR SIR,-Though years have passed since we met, I
venture to recall myself to your memory once more,
though my former letter, written when you became
Chancellor of the Exchequer, has remained unanswered.
Of course you remember TEDDY ToMPKINs at school-
the small boy who used to walk along the desks on his
hands. Well, that was I. Since then I have done a
good many things, been in America, Brazil, New " saland
and South Africa; but it hasn't come to much. ' of
I want to say is that I have invented a new food, in
which the common nettle is the chief ingredient, and I
want to bring it before you. It only needs to be put
forward influentially to be universally adopted. Will
you, therefore, kindly grant me an interview on an early
date? Three-quarters of an hour would probably be
enough. I shall bring specimens of the food with me.
It is made in small square cakes and can be carried in
the pocket. A prompt reply to the Post Office, Balham,
will find me.
Congratulating you on your elevation to the office of
Prime Minister, I am yours truly,
EDWARD HOPKINSON
No. II.
SIR,--I am instructed by the Mannington Branch of
the “Votes For Women '' League to forward to you the
following Resolution, which was unanimously passed at
a largely attended meeting of the Branch : —“That this
Branch of the V.F.W.L., whilst refusing to join in the
disgusting congratulations which have been offered to
the Right Honourable H. H. Asquith on his acceptance
of the post of Prime Minister, reiterates its solemn
determination to pursue him through the length and
breadth of the United Kingdom until he recognises the
right of women to the suffrage, after which the Branch
will combine to support him.” º
I am desired to add that ten of our members have
formed themselves into a doorstep brigade and propose
to begin operations shortly.
Faithfully yours,
EDITH PETHINGTON PANKTHoRPE.
No. III. º
SIR,-Is there a place for an honest man in the ranks
of the miserable aggregation misnamed a Government, of
which, if the daily Press may be trusted toº have
deviated from its customary mendacity, you are to be
the chief? I have spent a long life in exposing the
iniquities and subterfuges of party politicians. I am
still integer vitae scelerisque purus, and am prepared to
continue as I have begun. Still, the battle a ainst
ignorance, rapacity, and injustice is a tiring one when
waged by a single pair of hands. I should be con-
tent to accept any post in which I should be able to
influence the decisions of the Government in the right
direction, but it must be understood that the acceptance
of a salary however large is not to constitute a claim
upon such blind support as is unbecoming to one whose
watchword through life has been sic semper tyrannis.
Yours obediently,
DoNNISTHORPE BOTT.
No. IV.
DEAR MR. Asquith, Our Social Debating Society is
going on Tuesday to discuss a motion that Liberalism is
on the whole of greater advantage to the Empire than
ToMPKINs.
Conservatism. I thought that as you have just been
made Prime Minister you might be able to give me some
hints about proposing this. When you write please
don't bother about writing too much. Two or three
sheets of notepaper will do, and I shall be most awfully
obliged to you, and I should like to smash the other side,
which I shall easily do if you will do what I ask. My
father heard you speak once. Would you mind writing
by return of post,” I am sorry I could not let you
know before.
Yours truly, ARTHUR MINCHIN.
No. V.
DEAR SIR,--The Peddlington Tariff Reformers wish me
to say that they have unamiously passed this Rellosu-
tion that the permorfances of the Government entitles
them to no creddit.
Yours obedient W. SMITH.
[Besides these there are 2,500 applications for posts in the Post
Office, Docks, Government Offices, the Police, the Corps of Com-
missionaires, and the Staff of the House of Commons.]
HINC ILLAE LACRIMAE.
[It is said that an antiseptic property has been discovered
to exist in tears..]
HEARKEN, my friends, to the last therapeutical
News, that may save you your medical fees;
Listen, and drive from your tissue and cuticle
Any attack of infectious disease;
Learn how the mumps and the measles and scabies
Straight from a lachrymal drop disappear;
Chicken-pox, atrophy, fever, and rabies
All of them run at the sight of a tear.
Had but the Greeks, in the days of THUcydides,
Scented the use of a blubbering eye,
Then had they lived in a slightly sore-lidded ease,
Never lain down in their thousands to die;
Had the Florentines dreamt of the properties,
So prophylactic, of weepings and wails,
Then they had started to weep and to mop hurt eyes,
And we had wanted BoccAccio's tales.
Germs are concealed in a penny or halfpenny;
Therefore at shops, when receiving your change,
Shed on the coppers a tear, and escape any
Perils of eczema, struma, or mange.
Yes, and 'tis probable too that a germ 'll lie
Hid in a handshake, a kiss, or a touch;
Weep then when shaking the hand of a firm ally,
Weep when you kiss your inveterate “Dutch.”
Pollen brings fever that troubles your ocular
Organs, and darkens their luminous ray;
Weep then, however internally jocular,
When you are looking on barley or hay;
But, that the cure may not ruin your eye, oh, be
Careful to shed but a modest amount;
Lest, like the recklessly sorrowing Niobe,
You should entirely dissolve to a fount.
From an account in The Cambridge Daily News of
the College Servants’ races on the Cam:
“The winning crew ‘caught crabs' rather badly, but maintained
their speed . . . Trinity No. 2 lost his oar, which probably materially
affected their time.”
No wonder Cambridge does so well at Putney, so long
as this dauntless spirit prevails among her gyps.

Caddy. “SAY, Miss, we'RE JUST GoING To DRIVE on to THAT GREEN.”
Aunty. “Oh, THANK THE GENTLEMAN so Much for sending you To TELL Us!
THEN we SHALL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL view ’’
MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL’S
POSITION.
(From a wholly untrustworthy correspondent.)
WILL Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL
join the Labour Party? (This is our
own original question, and is not
borrowed from any halfpenny paper.)
He is nearly sure to have the offer
of a Cabinet appointment, and his
acceptance (which, we understand,
has already been given, requiring
only the offer to complete the
arrangement) will entail his re-elec-
tion for North-West Manchester. But
his majority there was only 1,241,
and if he fails it is a question as to
how he can get back. A few of his
friends have offered to retire in his
favour, but there is no one among
them whose majority was more than
3,000. We understand that Mr.
CHURCHILL considers Sir John
BETHELL (Romford, majority 8,855)
his best hope; but Sir John has been
invited to dinner, and has been
talked to about possible peerages,
without effect. Liberal Members
feel an especial pride in their posi-
tion in the House, and knowing
that if they once relinquish their
seats they may never recover them
—at any rate for thirty or forty years
—they are naturally slow to offer
help.
Thus, should Mr. CHURCHILL fail at
Manchester, he stands a good chance
of not sitting on the green benches
for a very long time to come, as a
Liberal. Knowing what a disappoint-
ment absence from the House would
be to him, the Labour Party has
approached him (I am informed) with
a view to winning him over to their
ranks. Having changed his poli-
tical views once, they argue, he may
be prepared to change them again,
and certainly the conversion of this
brilliant young aristocrat into a
Labour Member would be a great ac-
complishment. Of course, as has
been pointed out to him, the red tie
is quite optional. If Mr. CHURCHILL
agrees, the proposal is that Mr.
FENwick (Lab., Wansbeck, maj.
7,176) and Mr. W. Hudson (Lab.,
candidate, with a little preparation.
Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD is quite wil-
ling to lend him the necessary clothes,
including a hat; Mr. WILL CRooks
has volunteered to give him lessons
in the vernacular any time Mr.
CHURCHILL cares to step down to
Poplar and look in for a cup of tea
with him and Mrs. CRooks; and Mr.
Victor GRAYson has offered him the
loan of his private vocabulary in the
hope that in a few years Mr.
CHURCHILL may be persuaded to go
a step further and become one of
the Socialist group.
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL has not
yet replied to the suggestion, but
there is every possibility of interest-
ing developments taking place.

THE OLD BLUE-PYE.
I'M a lean old, mean old sight in a street
With a foolish, ghoulish glare at a man,
And my kennel-mates look grand at a meet,
With a bloom on the Belvoir tan;
And they sneer who gape on my colour and shape
And my veteran, villainous, bloodshot eye,
For the crowds that swarm round fashion and form
Pass over the old blue-pye.
But the Huntsman knows what a hound can do,
And he knows that I know that he knows it, too:
He knows my voice on a fox is true,
And the blood of a fox my joy;
So I clear my way thro’ the thick of the pack
To where he sits on the bay mare's back
With his, “Poor old Vagabond—Vagabond—Vagabond
Poor old Vagabond, boy 1 ''
I'm a hard old, scarred old, quarrelsome brute,
I'm a peevish, thievish bundle of bone,
But I'll sing to a fox when the rest are mute
On a line as cold as a stone.
Oh, the Belvoir blood is gallant and good
On a scent you could eat, when it hangs breast high,
But the casting vote on a doubtful note
Is left to the old blue-pye.
And the Huntsman knows what a hound can do,
And he knows that I know that he knows it, too:
He knows my voice on a fox is true,
And the blood of a fox my joy;
So clear the way for the pick of the pack,
When he waves us in from the bay mare's back
With his “'Leu-'leu, Vagabond—Vagabond—Vaga-
bond
'Leu-'leu, Vagabond, boy
| ".
I'm a slinking, blinking beast on a bench,
I'm a sulking, hulking bully at home,
But I'm king of the sport of kings as I wrench
Thro' the woods where the red rogues roam ;
And my fine sleek mates must bury their hates
And gather and gallop to get to the cry
When the brushwood rocks and the word is, “For –
On the faith of the old blue-pye.”
For the Huntsman knows what a hound can do,
And he knows that I know that he knows it, too:
He knows my voice on a fox is true,
And the blood of a fox my joy;
So cleave your way to the pick of the pack,
When he wakes the woods from the bay mare's back
With his “ Huic, to Vagabond l—Huic, to Vagabond
Yoo-ick, Vagabond, boy ''
I'm a creepy, sleepy slug in the straw,
But endure as sure as fate on a line,
And a fox must make the most of his law
When the set of his mask is mine;
And the riders troop to the shrill who-hoop
On staggering horses and steeds that sigh
As the word goes round that the fox was found
And killed by the old blue-pye.
For the Huntsman knows what a hound can do,
And he knows that I know that he knows it, too:
He knows my voice on a fox is true,
And the blood of a fox my joy,
As he fights his way to the thick of the pack,
Where my jaws are crushing a wet red back,
With his “Leave him, Vagabond —Vagabond –
Vagabond
Leave him, Vagabond, boy!”

Motto—“We Touch the Spot!”
To illustrate the wide scope and practical utility of
our assistance, we append a few extracts taken at
random from recent correspondence. Originals can at
any time be inspected on application.
(1) “Bow Belle '' (a novelist with one of the largest
circulations in contemporary fiction) writes:–
“The second chapter of my new romance begins
thus:– Three days later they were in Florence. There,
standing together before the mighty masterpiece of

moving canvas in the whole realm of art, they, etc.'
Kindly fill in title of any really first-class picture to be
seen in this town, with not less than four lines of expert
appreciation. On the way back to the hotel I want the
heroine to be run over by a bullock-waggon and carried
into an adjacent catacomb. Is this all right ! If not,
please suggest suitable alternatives. Shall probably be
writing you again in a day or two.”
(2) “Recluse '' (Devonshire) is under the distasteful
necessity of introducing one powerful sensation scene to
liven up his forthcoming volume of philosophical reflec-
tions, The Vicarage Spare-Room. His idea is that the
leading female character should be decoyed to a lonely
portion of the South Lancashire coast, and there mur-
dered. A cursory inspection of the map has suggested
Blackpool as a spot possessing an appropriately sinister
name; he would therefore be obliged if Messrs. M. B. M.,
Ltd., would favour him with a description of the locality,
enclosing height of cliffs, tide-table, and all similar details
likely to be of assistance. Are there any houses near?”
Also inquiries for a geyser, a Zulu impi, a Pata-
gonian broncho-buster (two applications), and the
purlieus of a mango-swamp.
We have helped others. Let us help you.

FOOD FOR THE MIND.
[N.B.-This is not an extract from the Home
& Colonial Stores Price List, as it might seem
at the first glance, but a by-election speech
guaranteed to win any seat at the present
moment.]
MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN, -In
addressing you—the enlightened and
intelligent electorate of the Peckish
Division—I ask you, in the first place,
on what cry did the conglomeration
of ravenous brigands which calls itself
a Government—on what cry did it
come into power? You know, gen-
tlemen, the cry of Free Food. Two
years have passed away. I ask not
whom have they done—for they have
done everybody—but what have they
done.
The Big Loaf of which they
bragged costs the careworn house-
wife a penny more. The Butter,
with which the honest toiler renders
his dry crust more succulent, has
risen from 18. 1d. to 1s. 3d.
The Margarine, which the profli-
gate expenditure of a dishonest
Cabinet often compels us to use as
a substitute, has also risen from 6d.
to 8d. per lb.
Bacon—Gentlemen, my emotions
will hardly allow me to dwell on
bacon—suffice it that from many a
humble home the smell of the appe-
tising rasher is absent.
Meat—whilst the jester BIRRELL
drives cattle in Ireland his Socialistic
colleagues drive up meat prices in
England.
Nor with such an Admiralty—in-
different to England's interests on
the high seas—can we wonder that
the pleasing Winkle grows scarcer
and dearer?
So, gentlemen, I can go through
the entire catalogue of your domestic
needs—the sugar that sweetens your
bitter cup, the appetising pickle, that
poor man's joy the kipper, the bulls-
eyes which your stalwart lads suck,
the chocolate creams which delight
your winsome daughters—all, all
have risen through the baleful influ-
ence of a Government which came in
on Free Food.
And Beer—Gentlemen, I tremble
when I think of Beer. In that de-
lightful melody which you sang at
the opening of this meeting with such
religious fervour are these stirring
lines—
“Up with the sale of it
Down with a pail of it.”
The motto of this Government—the
infamous Cabal which will soon be
swept away by a free and intelligent
people—is “Up with the price of it.”
&vº & s -ºs, ºc-
Boy. “SixpeNN'orth o' cod liver oil, please, SIR. AN', I say, Don't give ME Too MUCH,
'cos It's ME what's Got To DRINK IT.”
In that profligate Act, of which
TITUs OATEs would be ashamed,
there are provisions which will inevi-
tably raise the price of Beer to 4d. a
glass. What will be the hideous
consequences? The working-man will
be deprived of that pure nut-brown
beverage which is his natural drink,
and drunkenness will be multiplied
tenfold. -
Now, gentlemen, this is my pro-
gramme. By the imposition of light
taxes on imported food, which the
foreigner will pay, the prices of food-
stuffs will be instantly decreased. On
the other hand I will resolutely
oppose all increase in the duties on
beer or the imposts upon publicans—
for it is an ascertained economic fact
that whilst any tax on food falls on
the producer, not the consumer, a tax
on beer falls solely on the working-
In an .
Will you endure for a moment
longer, gentlemen, the existence of a
Government under which your army,
navy, colonies, homes, wives, reli-
gious faith, and alcoholic refreshment
are imperilled. Will you? (Thunders
of interested negation.)

LONDON LETTERS.
I.
DEAR CHARLEs, I saw a sad thing
last Monday outside the House of
Commons. A dozen sandwichmen
were parading the street with boards
on their backs, imploring us to
notice which way Members voted
on the second reading of the
Licensing Bill. Of course the second
reading had just been postponed for a
month, so they will have to come
out again after Easter. This means
that a whole day was wasted, and I
don't know how many shillings of the
widows and orphans. A sandwich-
man, you know, gets one-and-six an
hour (or is it a day?—anyhow I know
it 's one-and-six); and if you multiply
that by a thousand, or whatever the
number of them was, you get a lot.
Talking of the Licensing Bill, I
know a man called BAss who writes
fiery leaders against it in one of the
Unionist papers. He isn't really one
of the Bassy Basses, being more of a
Baritone, and of course his leaders
aren't signed; but still, I don't think
he ought to do it, do you? He is
bound to be prejudiced. I am quite
disinterested about this. If his name
were Cocoa or AERATED I should
object just as much to his writing for
the Westminster. A journalist, dear
CHARLEs, must be above suspicion.
(“Like CAESAR’s wife,” as we say in
the profession.)
Oh, I say, I've just had a nephew 1
(Uncle doing well.) Did you know?
Look here, we 'll arrange a sporting
match between him and your son
over hurdles for 1922. Your boy will
still be a year older, but, bless
you, I don't mind that. My nephew
is so ugly that I feel he must be good
at something. Probably hurdles.
Of course if either of us perishes in
the meantime the nominations be-
come void. (“The nominations be-
come void ''—did you notice that?
Quite the sportsman.)
What sort of weather are you
having? I ask because the weather
differs according to the locality,
and down at Castle Bumpbrook
it may be quite fine, while it is
raining here, and vice versá. Why is
this? Why shouldn't the weather
be the same everywhere? Some-
thing to do with the solstices, I be-
lieve. What is a solstice? (I have
asked you no end of questions in this
letter, and I don't suppose you will
answer one of them.)
Have you ever thought—
Oh Evans, oh the Dickens and
Jones—I’ve just remembered that
HiLDA is staying with you ! So you
did know I had a nephew, and you've
observed him for yourself. Look
here, you simply mustn't let her see
this letter. Or if, following a distin-
guished precedent, you have to leave
it about, just block out the bit about
the “ugly,” as they do in Russia.
And I'll put in a P.S. on a separate
bit of paper, which you can show to
HILDA. See?
I seem to have stopped, rather un-
fortunately, at “Have you ever
thought?” I was going on—Have
you thought how awkward it would
be if the weather were the same
everywhere? Like the stars. When-
ever I go away for a week-end to a
strange place I arrive at tea-time,
and break the ice by saying “And
what sort of weather have you been
having here 2 ” I can then help
myself with some distinction to
muffins, and by the time I have
eaten the last muffin everything is
going on very nicely. Now, if I had
said, “What sort of stars have you
been having here?” that wouldn't
have led to anything, least of all
(probably) to muffins. You see what
I mean? But I don't suppose you
do. You never think of things like that
in the country. What do you think
of at Castle Bumpbrook? Tell me.
Do you grow oranges at Castle?
(Forgive the familiarity.) I have
just eaten about six. I get through
quite a dozen a day. The fact is I
heard a doctor say the other night
that they were awfully good for the
complexion — or else awfully bad,
I couldn't quite catch which. He
spoke very indistinctly. It was a
pity that I missed what seems to
have been the important word; it
wouldn't have mattered so much
about the “awfully.” However, I
go on eating them, and if one day
you turn up in town and find me a
full-blown mulatto, you will know
that the word was “bad.” I shall
become a sort of test case, like
“Wreford v. Partington (1883).”
Eminent people will refer to me. How
nice to be referred to—not that it
would be the first time. “Refer to
drawer,” I remember on my cheques
at Cambridge. That, sir, was me.
Do you know, I made up the names
Wreford and Partington on the spur
of the moment. The names are
simple enough, but I think the com-
bination is wonderful. There must
have been such a case in 1883. Who
do you think Wreford was 2 I fancy
he was a small chandler, and he fell
down the coal shoot of Partington's
in Cannon Street. James Parting-
ton, the senior partner, said (fairly
enough) that a great firm like his,
which had branches all over England
(including Norwich), must have coal
some time, if they were to cope suc-
cessfully with increasing foreign com-
petition, which, owing to the present
Gov— - Oh no, this was 1883; I
forgot. Well, anyhow, he said they
must have coal. Wreford retorted that
he didn't mind their putting coal
down their shoot, but when it came
to including respectable citizens of
London
You remember the excitement
when the case came on ? We were
only babies then, but I have a recol-
lection that my nurse was a pro-
Partington. Wreford won, but as he
was heavily fined for having know-
ingly caused a crowd to collect it did
him little good, poor man.
Good-bye. I have written you a
long letter. Write back at once, on
one side of the paper only, pinning
your sheets neatly together, and
marking them “Elephant ’’ in the
top left-hand corner. Ever yours,
WILLIAM of ORANGE.
P.S.—Have you heard about my
nephew 2. He is the dearest baby
you ever saw. His face I should call
interesting and clever, rather than
handsome; but it is one that grows
upon you. A. A. M.
VER WERECUNDUM ;
OR, NATURE's GENTILITY.
O SPRING-TIME, how can I express
The coyness of your gradual
coming,
The caution of that first address
So different from the loud caress
That bards are bent on thrum-
ming?
They see (with Eros at her side
Affixing to his bolt a new barb)
A corybantic lady glide,
And all the woods about her pied
With red and green, like rhubarb.
They sing how at a glance she stirs
The seeds that slumbered during
snow-time,
Till all the conquered dale is hers,
And on the bough the catkin purrs
In practically no time.
I fail to see it. Calm and slow
(A patch of rain and now a dry bit)
A proudly proper gait you go,
And, as I said, I do not know
What words can well describe it.
Not with a sudden rosy stamp
That sends a flush through fields
and fences,
But dim and delicate and damp
With large goloshes and a gamp,
The English spring commences.

WHAT OUR ARTIST HAS TO PUT UP WITH.
Visitor. “I say, old CHAppie, TELL ME, what is About The Average PRICE of AN Old MASTER2"
ANOTHER HUSTLER.
AN INTERVIEW.
HANDING him my card, I awaited
his words, note-book in hand. It was
in the smoking-room of the Astor
Hotel, amid circumstances of peculiar
grandeur and the smell of the very
last thing in paint.
“Yes, sir,” he said, “I am Mr.
CY RUs K. DExTER, at your service for
ten minutes. I can give you till a
quarter of six.”
“Is it the case,” I asked, “ that
you are in London in connection with
a recent change of fashion here?”
“Yes, sir, I am. That is so. The
news came that the British aristo-
cracy were giving up frock coats,
and I took the next boat across. I
caught it by twenty-five seconds and
a biggish jump. I came on the
Torymania. She is a great ship.
Fine.”
“What was your idea?”
“My idea, sir, is to make a
corner in the best English frock coats
for American wear. In our country,
sir, we have a liking for the frock
coat, but our tailors are inferior. In
your country you have good tailors,
and are tired of the frock coat. Do
you see?”
I said I saw.
“My idea, sir, was to buy up the
classiest frock coats that had so sud-
denly gone out of fashion, and take
them back with me carefully
marked.”
“But how?” I began.
“I go, sir, not to the master but
to the man. I go to the valet. At
the present moment I have in my
possession four hundred and eighty-
two frock coats in good condition, all
once the property of noblemen.
Others are continually arriving. I
shall return to New York on Wed-
nesday next with the complete haul;
and I promise you the scene on my
arrival will be worth witnessing.
There is a demand for these coats:
among our leading citizens such as:
you cannot imagine. I am receiving
cables on the subject every few
minutes. Here is one I have just
had with regard to the Earl of
RossLYN's, with satin facings. -
“But,” I said, “supposing they
don't fit?”
“Fit, sir,” said Mr. DExtER,
“will come not first; nor will it come
second or third. Before fit will come
the shape—the frockiness, as I may
put it, of the coat; before fit will
come the tailor, the builder of the
coat, with his London label; before
fit will come the guarantee of
genuineness, the certificate signed by
a reputable valet, as to its previous
owner's connection with it. . .”
“But the fact that the coat is
second-hand 2 ''
“Sir,” said Mr. DExTER, “it is a
quarter of six. I must bid you a very
good evening. You evidently do not
know our people.”

THE INDISPENSABLE INFOR-
MANT.
BIARRITz.
Of brilliant Biarritz, which has
just become the centre of the uni-
verse, too much cannot be known.
All eyes have been turning that way
and every ear strained for news from
the French Brighton, as it has never
before been called. For Biarritz, you
exact, it is on the Bay of Biscay; and
'not the least of its many attractions
is the sound of voyagers in agony on
the numerous vessels which cross
that uneasiest portion of the uneasy
Atlantic. Breezes blown in from the
sea add to the healthiness of Biarritz.
There are occasional gales; rain
sometimes falls, and sunshine varies
with cloud. In summer the sea is
bathed in. In winter, not.
Brilliant Biarritz, so called because
it was there that His Majesty re-
ceived Mr. Asquith in audience, is,
like other French towns, whether
maritime or inland, divided into
must know, is on the sea: to be
CIVILIAN AND SOLDIER TOO.

streets. It has an “hotel de ville ''
and a railway station, or “gare,” as
these places are wittily called by our
lively neighbours. (Hence the Eng-
lish word “guard ”—one who is
found at a “gare.”) Biarritz has
shops (“magasins de nouveautés '')
and visitors often buy things in them.
The visitors are not only French but
English, and American too, who stay
for the most part in the hotels, walk
out on fine days, and seldom pluck up
enough courage to complain of their
bills. Nothing can exceed the
uniqueness of Biarritz or the
brilliance. Brilliancy is indeed its
keynote.
Such a town naturally has its
lions, chief of whom is ARNAUD
MAssy, the golf champion, who was
born at No. 4 Rue de Fer, where his
aged mother still resides. Few in-
deed are the young golfers who do
not visit the old lady in the hope of
acquiring a tip or two. Mrs.
MAssy, who has not only discarded
her Dolly Vardon bonnet for the sea-
son, but has now given up Taylor-
made clothes, is herself no mean
practitioner, and can wield her
“cercles,” as clubs are called in
France, with the best, and with them
make rings round even the most
formidable opponents. With pardon-
able pride she refers always to her
mashie as her massy. Dear old soul.
At present the fares to this charm-
ing resort are not excessive, nor is
the price of living there too high; but
if the new French Licensing Bill
passes it is conjectured that your
Biarritz will cost you more.
Letting them down gently.
“One of the most essential points
in rifle-shooting is to lead a somewhat
temperate life.”—The Rifleman.

“You will get there immediately
by the Tube '' is perhaps, a better
translation of this simple Latin
phrase.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED from THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
April 6.—House met at usual hour
amid customary observances. Per-
haps benches were more than usually
crowded for a Monday. Strangers'
Galleries thronged. Thin black line
of Peers occupied Front Bench of
gallery to right of clock. Amid mur-
mur of conversation ordered business
went forward. There were new
writs to be moved—one for Kincar-
dineshire, in the room of J. W.
CROMBIE, whose taking off whilst
still in the prime of life as years
count has been partly overlooked in
public record occupied with the sick-
ness and death of more prominent
Parliamentarians. The House knows
it has lost a man of gentle nature,
rare intellectual gifts, a speaker who
touched the chord of pathos or
humour with equal sureness, who,
handicapped by constitutional phy-
sical frailness, bravely made light of
his burden.
Over four-score questions on the
paper, of something more than usual
nothingness. Three were addressed
to the PRIME MINISTER. Members
turning over the pages were conscious
of the fact that there was not any
more a Prime Minister, nor in truth
“OUR REVERED AND TRUSTED CHIEF.”
Henceforth a Happy Memory only.

he said, “his Majesty the KING has

FULSOME FARE FOR RADICAL
READERS.
(With grateful acknowledgments to “The
Daily Chronicle.”)
SIR JULIUs Schloss returned from
Mentone last Friday, and for the first
time slept in his new mansion,
Mosel House, Arlington Street. The
work of preparing the mansion for its
owner has occupied a considerable
time, upwards of 500 workmen being
employed day and night for the last
nine months, but the final touches
were given about ten days ago, since
when the major-domo, Lord SAN-
Dow N, and the entire staff of servants
(numbering 167) have been anxiously
awaiting their eminent master.
Mosel House is now a positively
Sardanapalian palazzo, and contains
old masters, plate, bijouterie, tapes-
try, and first editions of priceless
value. . . The lighting of the classic
servants’-hall is one of the most
striking features of this magnificent
apartment. Old Roman lamps of
antique bronze are suspended, like the
sword of Damocles, from the ceiling,
but the illumination is supplied, not
by the oil flame, as in the pitifully
primitive days of HELIOGABALUs, but
by electric torches fitted to the
lamps. The servants'-hall, it may
be added, is furnished with a sump-
tuous musicians' gallery, from which
Sir JULIUs's private orchestra of 100
performers, conducted by Herr
Bolossy BAMBERGER, discuss sym-
phonic music to the assembled
menials four times a day. Plain
living and high thinking is, however,
the rule enforced by Sir JULIUs, who
only allows his domestics good sound
claret à discretion on week-days, and
the dryest champagne on Sundays.
Before leaving England on the
occasion of his last visit, and when
Sir JULIUS Schloss was in Abyssinia,
the GERMAN EMPEROR paid a visit to
Mosel House, his Imperial Majesty
having previously expressed a desire
to Lord SANDown to view the
wonders of what is undoubtedly the
most sultanic and miraculously gor-
geous residence in London. Lady
Goldwasser received his Majesty in
the absence of her brother, and con-
ducted him through the numerous
rooms, of which there are seventeen
more than in the Vatican. The
KAISER was particularly fascinated
by the Pompeian pantry, and above
all by the superb Turkish baths,
which are constructed of porphyry
and platinum, the cork mats being
studded with fine emeralds. The
KAISER could hardly tear himself
away from this superb temple of
ablution, in which the soap is
scented with attar of roses, and caged
nightingales, trained to sing directly
the taps are turned on, mingle their
seraphic strains with the dainty
plashings of the luxurious bathers.
The water used in this bath, it should
be added, is conveyed in gold pipes
all the way from the Bosphorus in
order to give the correct local colour
to the scene.
On taking possession of his new
home Sir JULIUS Schloss hands over
his old residence, 390, Park Lane to
his niece, Lady CosherLEY, who
already possesses one bijou dwelling
in Berkeley Square, one in Palace
Gardens, and a third in Grosvenor
Gardens. The Park Lane mansion
is second only in splendour to Mosel
House, and has been perhaps more
often honoured by Imperial, Royal
and Grand Ducal guests than any
other private house in town. On the
other hand, Lady CosherLEY's bijou
Berkeley Square “band-box”—as it
was wittily called by the late Heredi-
tary Hospodar of Podolia—had grown
altogether too small for the require-
ments of Lady CosherLEY, whose
dinner parties have for many seasons
struck the top note in the gastro-
nomic gamut. Lady CosherLEY
shares her uncle's love of the beau-
tiful, and her Mixo-Lydian boudoir
was almost, if not quite, one of the
most unique things in its way in
London. The walls and ceiling were
ornamented with wonderfully lovely
paintings by Sigismund GoetzE, HER-
BERT SCHMALz, and other incom-
parable artists, and the Turkey carpet
was of so astonishingly thick a pile
that Lady CosherLEY's pet Schip-
perke used to disappear from sight
when walking across the room. It is
hardly likely, however, that Lady
CosherLEY will take up residence in
Park Lane before the end of May.
She has felt the death of her famous
Borzoi intensely, and her husband,
Sir Joshua CosherLEY, is so fully
occupied in handicapping the com-
petitors in the putting competitions
organised by the Grand Duke
MICHAEL at Cannes that he will be
unable to return to London for
several weeks. Sir Joshua, it will be
remembered, was recently elected an
honorary member of the Kitchen
ºmittee of the National Liberal
Club.
Many well-known faces were at
GARRIDGE's for tea yesterday when
Dr. FILLINGHAM BRIDGER's lecture on
“Royalties whose teeth I have
crowned '' proved very interesting.
Lady MARGERY MoLAR was pictur-
esque in terra - cotta, and Lady
MATLASKE in pastel shades, with a
floral toque, was sitting at tea with
Lady ZERBOA PILAFF and the Hon.
AZIMUTH BLANdAMER. On the same
evening the restaurant was very full
for dinner. Sir JASPER SALsify and
Count PIMENTo were dining together,
and Baron von GULP of the German
Embassy was also entertaining.
The reference in a recent issue of
Madame to a feat of strength of
KING Edward, who in his early days
made and won a bet that he would
carry a small pony, up a flight of
stairs, has set the fashion of
“ athletic luncheons,” at which the
guests are all expected to give proof
of their physical prowess. A charm-
ing example of this form of entertain-
ment was recently held at Lady
DURDLE's beautiful house in Gros-
venor Square. Sir HUGo BURLEIGH
carried a baby elephant from the
ground floor to the attics without
stopping; but the first prize was
awarded to Lord LUNDY, who poised
on his head a tank containing a small
sperm whale kindly lent by the Prince
of MonAco, and walked with it three
times round the square.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE JEW OF VENICE.
WHILE Mr. TREE was about his
business of remodelling The Merchant
of Venice, I rather wonder he did
not think to improve its title as
above. For Shylock, at . His
Majesty's, has the pick of the lime-
light, of the curtains, of the dramatic
pauses and delays. He dominates
the Ghetto, and for his sake this
obscure quartier Juif becomes the
fashionable resort of carnival. He
appropriates an extra episode (not in
the book) that he may have the
opportunity of reversing SHAK-
speARE's estimate of him as a man
who thought more of the loss of his
ducats than of his daughter, and so
appealing to emotions which the
author never proposed to excite.
But Mr. TREE justified himself to
all but the pedants. His Shylock
was a very subtle study of character,
marred only by its noisier passages.
Miss ALEXANDRA CARLISLE had a far
harder task with Portia. She elected
to be consistent with herself rather
than to attempt to follow the incon-
sistencies of the character that
SHAKSPEARE drew. For it is difficult
to conceive of Portia as the “great
lady '' that some of the critics would
have her to be, and at the same
time capable of just any girlish devil-
ment that occurs to her. Miss
CARLISLE's youth has been made a
charge against her; yet, of course,
one of the chief virtues required (and
not always found) in an actress who
plays Portia is that she should enjoy
that “ lack of years ” for which
Bellario: apologised when he recom-
mended her to the Duke's notice.
This gift of nature Miss CARLISLE
supplemented by a very charming
vivacity, tempered with enough of
dignity to support the magnificence
of her establishment at Belmont.
The rest of the cast did not shine
too conspicuously, though I liked
the contagious gaiety of Mr. QUAR-
TERMAINE’s Gratiano. Mr. ANSON
played the blind Old Gobbo very
carefully; and Mr. NorMAN PAGE
made the most of the indifferent fool-
ing assigned to Gobbo Junior.
The trial scene was an illumina-
tion. In reading the play one fails
to appreciate the extraordinary
licence permitted to spectators in a
mediaeval Venetian Court of Justice.
Every moment I expected Mr.
Plowden (who was in the stalls) to
intervene and remind Gratiano that
if there were to be any pleasantries
in court they must emanate from
the Bench only.
Another thing that impressed me
was the astonishing discretion shown
at Belmont in the matter of the
secret of the caskets. When one
suitor after another had failed with
the gold and the silver, everybody,
from the major-domo downwards,
must have made a shrewd guess as
to the whereabouts of the hidden por-
trait, yet nobody gave the answer
away. I do hope that the household
of the ex-Premier at that other Bel-
mont, N.B., has always been equally
reticent about any state secrets that
it may have overheard.
The music was a very notable
feature of Mr. TREE's production;
but the beautiful old Hebrew melody,
Kol Nedrei, was drowned in the
cackling of the audience during an
entr'acte, and the adorable song,
Tell me where is fancy bred, was no
sooner begun than it was obliterated
by the deafening bark of Mr. BASIL
GILL over the caskets.
Both scenery and costumes were
of an amazing beauty, but the gon-
dolas annoyed me; their motions, as
usual on the stage, being most con-
demnably sticky. O
THE OTHER SIDE.
ANOTHER GREAT RESTAURANT STRIKE.
REMARKABLE scenes took place at
a West End teashop the other day.
At the stroke of 1.30 p.m. every
customer in the place dropped his
knife, fork, or spoon, and left off
trying to eat the alleged food before
him. . No matter where they were
or what they were doing, on the
stroke of 1.30 the customers stopped.
The waitresses were thunderstruck,
and tried all they could, some pro-
testing, some cajoling, to induce
the customers to go on with their
lunch, but in vain.
On the arrival of the manager, who
had been fetched from a neighbour-
ing hotel, where he was getting
something to eat, the ringleader of
the customers, a small, fair-haired,
vivacious man who is known to his
friends as “Ben,” handed him a
document written in chalk on the
bottom of a tea-tray. This docu-
ment contained the demands of the
customers, among which were the
following:—
That all customers shall be guaran-
teed to be served with their
lunch within fifteen minutes of
giving their orders (matinée
days, twenty minutes).
That the eggs served shall be eggs,
and the beef beef.
That waitresses shall be occasionally
reminded by the management
that they are there to earn their
living, not to confer favours.
That no breadstuff more than ten
days old shall be put before
customers.
That no customer shall be poisoned
or have his digestion ruined for
a period of three months from
the date of the document.
The Managing Director of the Com-
pany was telephoned for, and on his
arrival he took in at a glance the
seriousness of the situation, and at
once signed the document with a
chocolate éclair. Thereupon the
customers cheered, and quietly went
on with their work.
“Ben,” interviewed by our repre-
sentative, said, “For fifteen years I |
have come here to lunch and sat at
the same table; and every day my
lunch has been two half-scones and
two pats of butter, with a cup of
cocoa. Yes, I should prefer variety,
but I feel that by having nothing but
scones I ensure the supply being at
least moderately fresh. Were I to
change my meal, even for a single
day, my food the next day would
be some twenty-four hours older than
usual. I have observed the troubles
of my fellow-customers for some
time, and have long felt that some-
thing ought to be done—as a rule it
is either underdone or burnt to a
cinder. Yes, I am prepared to go on
with this great work if the manage-
ment do not abide by their under-
taking ”—and he flourished the tea-
tray proudly.

PARS ABOUT THE PREMIER.
(With apologies to ALL our contemporaries.)
MR. Asquith owes his present ex-
alted position in no small measure to
the fact that he was born a boy. Had
Fortune ordained otherwise it is pos-
sible that to-day he might have been
the trusted leader of the Suffragettes.
He is, as everyone knows, a Balliol
Iſlall.
*.*
Mr. Asquith is a man of purpose.
Watch him as he leaves his office and
steps boldly down Whitehall. His
object is to reach the House, and he
does it by his sheer ability to over-
come difficulties. He is, you see, a
Balliol man.
x +
It is often said that “ Asquith is a
born speaker,” but from what we
have heard from those who knew him
personally during the first few weeks
of his career the word “speaker’”
would seem to be merely a corruption
of “squeaker '' (q.v.). There is no
doubt, however, that he is a Balliol

Policeman. “So I've Got YER THIS TIME, "Ave I?"
Burglar. “GARN 1

Popular tradition represents Mr.
Asquith as an austere politician with
no particular love for his fellows.
This is not so, however; he is, on the
contrary, a genial kindly man, with
(in spite of the Licensing Bill) a dis-
tinct sense of humour, and he is very
popular with his Tennants. Jowett
predicted great things for Mr.
Asquith, which seems to show with-
out doubt that he is a Balliol man.
From an advt. in The Pioneer:
“FOR SALE, OWNER GOING ON LEAVE.

In fear lest some confusion follow
upon the production of the American
play The College Widow at the
Adelphi, Mr. A. C. BENson writes to
remind us that it is not a dramatisa-
tion of his sparkling pasquinade From
a College Window, although at first
sight it looks like it. This being so it
is a matter for extreme gratification
that the new play is not being per-
formed by the BENsoN Company.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE civilian reader will probably complain that in his
Memoirs of Field-Marshal Sir Henry Norman (SMITH,
ELDER) Sir WILLIAM LEE-WARNER has been too generous
with military details. In reading the chapters recording
the assault and capture of Delhi, one cannot see the
wood for the trees. This is not the biographer's fault,
save inasmuch as he is responsible for the marshalling
of the material placed at his disposal. Sir HENRY
NorMAN was a soldier—to be poecise, an Adjutant-
General—and in his diary and letters there appear a
wealth of particulars of men, armament, movements,
and consequences, admirable in an official report, a
little repellent in a book for general reading. There
comes within the story, for example, the blowing up of
the C a s h m e re - - - -
motor industry in the act of wrecking the country's
manners and morals. The book is, I believe, the fifth
which has come from Mr. JAMEs BLYTH during the last
fourteen months, and he is perhaps to be congratulated
on bearing the strain of production without showing
signs of wear. I have read four of the five, and this
seems to be as good as any of them. There are the
usual number of disagreeable people, the usual rather
insincere-sounding outbursts on various social questions,
and the usual amount of unctuous elaboration of the
obvious. One of the outbursts is brought to a close with
words which reveal an attitude of mind that the author
should be urged to cultivate. “But avauntl I am on a
pet subject, and though it will ease me to let fly, it will
bore my readers ineffably.”
It is a pity that Mr. ALBERT DoRRINGTON took the
scene of his novel And the Day Came (HUTCHINson)
- - — away from the
Gate, one of the
finest feats of
heroism in the
record of war.
Sir HENRY NOR-
MAN's pulse does
not seem stirred
by the episode,
which he re-
ports in the bald
style proper to

Never the less,
from the accu-
mulation of de-
tail unassisted by
literary art, the
reader is im-
pressed with the
peerless courage,
endurance and
self - d e n i al
crowned by the
re capture of
Australian Bush.
Of Bush life he
writes with both
simplicity and
strength, and he
emphasises its
influence over his
heroine, N or a
Hastings. “Sad-
ness, of course,

of the Australian

suffered sunstroke alternating with pitiless rain, in many
cases finishing off with cholera. On the day of the assault
66 officers, including the two Nicholsons, fell, and with
them over 1,100 men. NorMAN had a charmed life. Bullets
fired point-blank at him missed fire, shells exploded at
his feet, carrying havoc to those who stood by. Save for
a shot which, after killing his horse, grazed the rider, he
came out of the Mutiny scatheless. When The Delhi
Gazette appeared distributing crosses and promotions his
name found no place in it, much to the indignation of
comrades who had watched his strenuous efforts through
the siege. Later in life honours were showered upon
him. He rose to the rank of Field-Marshal, was
appointed Governor of Jamaica, and was offered the
Viceroyalty of India, which on reflection he declined.
A gallant soldier, a tireless worker, a modest man, of
such are the makers of Empire.
The principal theme of The Weaning (WERNER LAURIE)
is calf love, of which a violent case is described in detail.
Secondary, and more interesting, is a picture of the
arms of the Hon.
Manton Belstrade, a man who broke the seventh com-
mandment so habitually that little sympathy could be
felt for him when he died—very abruptly—through
someone else breaking the sixth. Perhaps Mr. DoR-
RINGTON would do better to leave the aristocracy alone
altogether, and to write a novel of Bush life plain and
simple, for I am sure he would make good stuff of it.
The Bushman who could laugh at himself might be the
hero.
Mr. CHARLEs E. HANDs, The Daily Mail Special Cor-
respondent at Biarritz, had a stirring interview with Mr.
Asquith on his arrival, in the course of which the
Premier remarked that he had nothing to say. Our con-
temporary, however, was not content with this unique
triumph on the part of its correspondent, and urged
him to further efforts; the result being that on the
next day all the papers came out with large headlines:–
“MR. Asquith Kiss Es HANDs.’’
THE NEW WRESTLING STYLE.-‘‘ Scratch as Gotch can.”

THE UNANSWERED QUESTION.
ScENE–A railway carriage, first smoking, on a suburban
line. TIME-9.20 A.M. There are five passengers
of the usual City and Suburban kind.
First Passenger (addressing the world in general from
behind a halfpenny paper). What's all this fuss about?
Second Passenger. What fuss?
First P. Why, all these elections.
Second P. (in amazement). My dear chap!
have you been 2
First P. (hurt). Same place as you, worse luck.
Second P. (to the rest). Here's a chap who doesn't
know we've got a new Prime Minister; he 's never heard
the name of Asquith ; he thinks WINSTON CHURCHILL 's
the name of a chest protector; and he believes LLoyd-
GEORGE is a golf pro. Good old BILL!, Isn't he a daisy”
Whero
The Rest (appreciatively). Good old BILL | You're
the limit.
First P. (indignantly). Oh, none of your rot. I know
all that rubbish. What I want to know is—
Second P. (interrupting amiably). Give him air. Don't
crowd him. Somebody ought to undo his collar. Now
then, look out for it. He 's opening his mouth. He 's
going to speak. Listen, everybody.
First P. (sternly). Funny dog. You'll hurt yourself if
you don't watch it. (To the rest.) Can't one of you tell
me? You're not all out of your minds, are you?
Third Passenger (compassionately). Right, BILL, I'm
same. I’ll give you a chance. What is it?
First P. What do they want to have all these elections
for? There 's WINSTON CHURCHILL in Manchester and
RUNCIMAN in Dewsbury. I thought they were Members
of Parliament already.
Third P. (benignantly). So they were till yesterday.
First P. Well, why aren't they now? What's hap-
pened?
Third P. (in a superior way). They've accepted office
under the Crown. It 's an old Act of Parliament.
First P. (suspiciously). What's an old Act of Parlia-
ment 2 -
Second P. (breaking in). That's right, BILL. Don't
you spare him. . Make him tell you.
Third P. (beginning to realise he is in a tight place).
It 's this way. If a chap takes office he 's got to fight
an election. It doesn't matter his being an M.P. In
fact it makes it worse.
First P. (triumphantly). Oh, but that 's rot.
Third P. (coldly). What do you mean?
First P. Mean what I say. (Refers to his paper.)
They've made SEELY Under-Secretary for the Colonies,
and a fellow called MASTERMAN has got a job too.
They 're both Members of Parliament, but there 's not
going to be any election in their places.
Third P. (incredulously). Where do you find that?
[The paper is handed over and the statement is
vcrifica.]
Third P. (defiantly). Well, all I can say is that they
ought to have an election. (A light breaks in on him.)
I've got it. Of course. Didn't I tell you it was an old
Act of Parliament 2 - -
First I. (grudgingly: suspecting a trap). Yes, you did.
Third P. (with determination). Well, then, there it is.
When that Act was passed these jobs that SEELY and
MASTERMAN have got hadn't been invented. They're
new jobs, and so they don't come under it.
Second P. HARRY's got it. Isn't he a red-hot
wonder? Now then, BILL, your turn again.
First P. (unconvinced). It's all very well for him to
think he 's found it out; but what I want to know is,
why the other two chaps have got to be elected again.
It 's no good jawing about old Acts of Parliament. Any
fool can do that. But none of you philosophers can tell
me why an Act like that was passed, and why it should
get hold of WINston and t'other chap and leave out
SEELY and his pal. (Silence prevails.) Ah, I thought
not. Well, you are a jolly wise lot. Public school and
university education, and all that. Bahl

TO PRISCILLA, F.G.S.

PRISCILLA, knowing, as you surely do,
That in my eyes it 's altogether shocking
To hint that you wear open-work of blue—
Or hint at all about a lady's stocking—
Why have you put aside your recent craze
For hockey (which you played with courage stoic)
To spend, monotonously, all your days
In search of fossils that are eozoic 2
It pains me to remark that you won't find them;
And, if you do—what good is there behind them?
You once were troubled if the smallest hint
Of horny-handedness should come upon you;
But now you hammer beastly chunks of flint,
Despite resultant blisters; and, anon, you
Will bid me put aside my studies classic
To tell you all I know of trilobites,
Or what's the proper way to spell “Jurassic,”
And how cretaceous fossils rest o' nights.
What would befall, my dear, if you mistook them,
And questioned me about the way to cook them 2
Think you that life its dreariness will lose
If you become a LEIBNITz or a HUTTON,
And yet ignore the proper way to choose
A juicy, tender joint of Cymric mutton?
If mesozoic mysteries distress you,
Dismiss them, dear PRIscILLA, from your mind;
And don't let metamorphic rocks impress you
With their stupendous value to mankind.
It may, of course, be very nice to know them;
Bºº 's the use?—you'll never learn to throw
them | -

A PLATFORM NOTE.
It is bad enough to be turned out of almost every train
between High Street and South Kensington to wait for
another to take one through to Charing Cross or the
City; but it is worse when the only advertisements on
each side of the track are obsolete. All refer to the late-
lamented Tribune. “Gives the news while it is news,”
says one notice several times repeated. “If you see it
in The Tribune,” says another, “you can trust it ";
while the third, , plaintively, and obviously with its
tongue in its cheek, asks, “Have you got your copy to-
day?" Then the train at last comes in, with standing-
room only.

ANOTHER RANK POET.
(FROM our very own CoRREs-
Pondent.)
A good deal of fuss has lately been
made over SETTIMIo Di Vico, the
cabman-poet, who plies for hire in
the Piazza di Spagna at Rome. It
seems only fair, therefore, to tell you
of a similar case that has come to
my notice in the person of WILLIAM
Scroggs, a London cabman, whose
rank is in the Tottenham Court
Road. Although originally the
driver of a hansom, he is now the
chauffeur of an auto-taxi; and it was
while riding in the latter that I made
the discovery of which I am about
to give you the particulars.
I was nestling back in the
cushions, thinking how well they do
these things nowadays, when I sud-
denly caught sight of a small volume,
neatly bound in grey cloth, stuck
in a lappet at my side. Drawing it
out, I read the title-page, “Between
Fares—a Collection of Lyrics in the
five - line Metre, by WILLIAM
Scroggs.” On the frontispiece was
a photograph of the said Scroggs,
which I had no difficulty in identify-
ing with the gentleman at that
moment occupying the box-seat.
The book (gracefully dedicated “To
my Mews") proved to be nothing
more nor less than a collection of
successful and unsuccessful Limer-
icks, which the author had evidently
been in the habit of sending in for
the different competitions. He ex-
plained to me how his success in
those competitions had enabled him
to give up his hansom and take a
three months' course of lessons in
motor-driving, which had led to his
present more lucrative position. He
has himself summed up the situation
in characteristic style:–
There was a young fellow called Schoags,
Who steadily went to the dogs,
Till a Limerick prize
Of exceptional size
Put a new set of spokes to his cogs.
The racy metaphor of the last line
is a good instance of the happy allu-
siveness that permeates all Scroggs's
work. A noteworthy feature of the
volume is the Foreword by a well-
known Limerick judge. Scroggs sells
his book personally over the mud-
guard at the absurdly low price of
one shilling; but, of course, he ex-
pects a pourboire.
It should be added, in conclusion,
that W. S. (initials of good omen 1)
hopes shortly to publish another
volume of verse, in which the tacksy
metre will be largely employed as the
vehicle of his poetic fancies.
“Young Man wanted, twelve or fifteen years
old, knowing both languages and bookkeeping,
one with experience in a lawyer's office pre-
ferred.”—Montreal Daily Star.
It would be a tragedy if an accom-
plished linguist and book-keeper with
a lifelong experience of a lawyer's
office, were rejected merely because
he was thirteen or fourteen years old.

SCOTLAND FOR EVER.
GREAT PUBLIC MEETING.
A MEETING of influential Scotsmen and others has
just been held at the Argyll Rooms to come to some
decision with regard to a testimonial, to Mr. HARRY
LAUDER for his services in bringing before the English
public the more alluring side of Scottish life. Among
those present were Mr. A. J. BALFour (in the Chair),
Lord TweedMoUTH, Mr. ANDREW LANG, Lord RosebERY,
Miss ANNIE Swan, Dr. Robertson NicoLL, Mr.
CRocketT, etc.
Mr. BALFour in opening the meeting said that
although he had never had the pleasure of hearing Mr.
LAUDER in person—(cries of dismay)—yet he took his
place at the head of that meeting without misgiving.
(Cheers.) He had heard him on the gramophone—(re- |
newed cheers)—and he had read his life. (Applause.)
He could confidently say that no one had done more to
make the Scotch popular.
Lord TweedMouth, speaking in his capacity as a
Knight of the Thistle (which, he said, he found very
good eating) supported Mr. BALFour. He had received,
he said, a telegram on the subject from an illustrious
personage which it would be no impropriety to read
aloud. (Panic.) It said, “Wish LAUDER all joy, and
may his porridge-bowl never know low tide.” (Cheers.)
This he, the speaker, need hardly say was signed
WILLIAM HoHENzoLLERN.
Lord RoseBERY said that he entirely concurred in the
object of the meeting. It was a great thing that a
Scotsman of genius had at last risen to tell the world
what Scotsmen really were like: not dour, commercial-
minded, censorious folk, but a rollicking, convivial, tick-
ling, dancing people, full of jest and fun, with great loving
hearts and nimble feet and voices of exquisite timbre.
Too long had the world been thinking the contrary. Not
since Sir WALTER Scott had any one man done so much
as Mr. (he wished he might say Sir) HARRY LAUDER to
turn southern eyes to the land of cakes and the leal.
(Terrific applause.)
Messrs. Cook AND SoN here rose en masse, and tes-
tified to the effect of Mr. LAUDER's songs on the tourist
business. Thousands of Englishmen, they said, who used
to go to Ostend and Paris and other gay continental
resorts for their holidays now go to Scotland in the hope
of meeting with Mr. LAUDER's heroines.
Dr. Robertson NicoLL opposed the testimonial. Mr.
LAUDER, he said, neither took in The British Weekly
nor had he taken any active part in disapproving of the
Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL. -
Miss ANNIE S. Swan cordially supported Dr. Robert-
son NicoLL. The songs of Mr. LAUDER, she contended,
lacked the true domestic note, and were aggressively in-
stinct with what she might call the joie de vivre.
Mr. ANDREW LANG said that the success of the great
patriotic Minnesinger whom they were met to honour
was a striking example of the vitality of apolaustic
hedonism—(cries of Help!)—amid a Puritanical environ-
ment. He added that he hoped to develop in an ap-
pendix to the next volume of his History of Scotland an
interesting parallel between the songs of Mr. LAUDER
and those of Rons ARD.
In conclusion he moved that funds should be raised to
present Mr. LAUDER with a gold-mounted sporran en-
graved with the motto “Lauder a laudato.” The
motion was supported by the Master of ELIBANK in a
pathetic speech, and carried, Dr. Robertson Nicoli, and
Miss ANNIE Swan alone (as ever) dissenting.
THE GIRL, AN 0DD RHYME OR TWO, LOWE, TOBACC0,
AND THE POET WHO WAS A BIT OF A BOUNDER.
[For the purposes of reviewing, indexing in albums, reciting, setting
to music and ‘...; enthusiastically to one's friends, this article may
be referred to briefly as “The Girl, &c.”]
HER name was DELIA, just the sort of name
No girls would stand outside a silly poem;
Or, if they would, their parents are to blame,
I'm glad to say that I at least don't know 'em;
But, if they would or not, it 's all the same
And makes no sort of difference to this proem.
Whatever else her name was in the flesh,
It wasn't DELIA. Let us start afresh.
Her name was DELIA. There I go again!
I've said it was, it wasn't and it was,
And yet it wasn't. Let us have this plain,
I want to have it very plain because
I think you ought to know her name was JANE,
As nice a name as anybody has.
(I don't much care what sort of rhymes I use,
But “was,” “because,” and “has "!... . . My dear
old Muse !)
Her name being JANE, and not, as you'd have thought,
Being DELIA, I kissed her pretty face,
Then asked her if she 'd marry me, and brought
Some argument to bear upon the case.
She hum'd and ha'd, and said I didn't ought,
But, as I had, she 'd like a little grace;
So might she have five minutes, say, to think?
I said she might. I'd go and get a drink.
Now beer is good, and beer is furthermore
Extremely good. ... I know a man, my dear
('Tis not because I love you, Reader, or
Because I hate you that I say “dear" here,
But knowing “beer'' was coming soon), who swore
IHe loved his wife but better loved his beer.
But even so the time was hardly ripe
For beer just then. Instead I smoked a pipe.
A coarse, a black, a noisome-looking growth,
Having a smell cross-bred of glue and tar;
Its proper name (I would not take my oath
. Upon the wherefore) “Tawny Yellow Star,”
Once called “The Dustman's Pride" (or “Joy,” or
both),
When dustmen weren't the faddy men they are;
And costing roughly half-a-crown a sack (Oh,
Beshrew these rhymes'); such is my . . . yes, tobacco.
With that dank weed I filled my pipe withal,
My only pipe, a frayed but chubby fellow
That you'd have loved, short in the stem and small;
Without—a greyish-reddish sort of yellow;
But, oh, within l—what ladies always call
Most vilely foul, but we divinely mellow.
I sat and smoked, the strictest silence keeping.
What wonder that I ended up by sleeping?

Her name was DELIA. “DELIA 2 DELIA What?”
'Twas DELIA Nothing, dear but stupid friend,
For I have told you once, or have I not,
Her name was JANE 2 JANE SMITH son.

To bring my poem to its tragic end.
But how to gild that bitter, bitter pill? . . .

CHICK-FOOD.
AUNT Sloppy's MonThly MAGAZINE for
CHILDREN.
(With homage to the ingenious conductors of
“The World and his Wife.”)
THE NEW “ALICE IN WONDERLAND.”
DEAR Chicks,
This is the beginning of a scrumptious new
serial, a sequel to Alice in Wonderland by the
delightful Lewis Carroll. Lewis Carroll, chicks,
was one of the kindest men living, and he
would have adored both this magazine and The
Children's Encyclopædia, especially, Mr. BEG-
Bie's revised Bible. Nothing would have given
him greater pleasure than to know that we
were re-writing his famous work, which we
can do what we like with now, as it is out of
copyright. Your loving
AUNT Sloppy.
JUST as Little Alice had decided
that she 'd never—never—never get
in a temper again, she suddenly
found she was in one—and a very
bad one, too ! But, really, I don't
wonder, for someone trod right on
her very “littlest " toe; and if
there 's one thing more than another
that puts most people into a bad
temper, it is having their toes trod-
den on
“You—you—CLUMSY thing !”
she cried, giving a violent push to
the person who 'd stumbled.
“I—I—really beg your pardon,”
said a very humble voice, “but I'm
in such a hurry to get to the match.
Are you coming?”
“No, I'm not l’’ snapped Little
Alice, though in her secret heart she
meant to follow this very clumsy
person, and see what the match was,
and where it was to be held.
Looking up when she thought his
head was turned away, she saw—
whom do you think? The Mad
Hatter. Just as Little Alice looked
up he was busy changing the label
on his hat. He 'd had one on saying
that the hat was ten shillings and
sixpence; now he stuck one in the
band saying “For Tennis.”
“Now I'm ready,” he said with
a contented sigh. And Little Alice
decided that he evidently thought
people would call his tall hat a
tennis-cap now that he 'd changed
the label.
(To be continued.)
TID-BITS.
Here, chicks, are some riddles for you, and
some interesting facts. AUNT Sloppy.
Lightning comes before thunder.
If you count after seeing the flash
you can tell how far the storm is

you can count before you hear the

What great Roman Emperor's

THE NEW “ROSE AND THE RING.”
DEAR Chicks,
The old “Rose and Ring,” which everyone,
alas! has now forgotten, was written by a
writer named THACKERAY, who lived at Ken-
sington (not very far from the present home of
the Duke of ARGYLL, who by a strange coinci-
dence is an author too). Some day, chicks,
when you are grown up, you will read more of
this great man's writings, of which no one can
ever tire. Your loving
AUNT Sloppy.
The royal pair had one only child,
the sweet Princess ANGELICA. It was
said she had the longest hair, the
largest eyes, the slimmest waist, the
smallest foot and the most lovely
complexion of any young lady in all
Carmelitia. She could play the most
difficult pieces at sight, and she
knew The Children's Encyclopædia
by heart.
Her nursery governess was Mrs.
GRUFFANUFF, who would not let her
go to Peter Pan, but kept her at her
lessons all day. This was because
Mrs. GRUFFANUFF did not believe in
fairies and disliked to have them
mentioned, while as for waving her
handkerchief to save one of their
trumpery lives, never !
But how about the Fairy Black-
stick?
(To be continued.)
THE NEW “CHILD'S GARDEN OF
VERSES.”
DEAR Chicks,
This month I give you another great treat—a
modern version of a very delightful book by
dear old Robert Louis STEVENson, the great
writer who loved you all so much (as who
could help doing !) that he made a book of poems
on purpose for you. . But as his cruel pub-
lishers won't let me give it to you free, as your
kind AUNT Sloppy would love to, I have had to
get a clever young man to write it a little
differently, although just as well. See, chicks?
Your affectionate AUNT Sloppy.
THE KIND Cow.
The cow we meet along the lane
I love with all my soul.
She gives me milk with might and
main
To fill my china bowl.
A Thought.
The world is so full of jam tarts and
NoAH's Arks,
I'm sure we should all be as merry
as larks.
SYSTEM.
The child who is not clean and
smart,
With many things to please his
heart,
Is either naughty, or his sire
Has failed great riches to acquire.
ANOTHER THouGHT.
A child should be extremely good,
And speak so 's to be understood,
And try at table still to sit—
As far as he can manage it.
Looking Forward.
When I'm grown a man to be
I shall behave most haughtily,
And tell my playmates not to dare
To meddle with my toys, so there

AUNT SLOPPY HERSELF.
(A Character Sketch)
DEAR Chicks,
Knowing how much you want to know all
about me I have at last acceded to your request,
many times expressed, and have given leave
for a description of me to appear in Chick-Food.
I could not, of course, write it myself, for that
would not be nice, and so it has been written
by another. I hope, chicks, you will like it.
Your faithful AUNT Sloppy.
Picture to yourselves a beautiful
old lady with a kind pink face and
the sweetest eyes beaming through
her gold-rimmed glasses. Picture
her seated in her high-backed chair
in her charming drawing-room sur-
rounded by happy children as she
bends towards them and in her soft
and soothing voice tells them one
of the old, old stories. Do you
think Aunt SLOPPY is really like
that? Do you?

“Japan's mission is in the word of one of its
greatest statesmen, ‘To lead sia.’ This is an
intelligible programme, there is no deception

leap to it.

AMAZING FULFilmeNT of THE WITCHEs' PROPHECY |

Being a timely caution to Admiral Sir John Fisher and other eminent
persons, who may be interested in making the acquaintance of their
ew political chiefs.

“Fear not until McKinnon Wood
Do come to Runciman.”—(Macbeth, MoRE on LEss.)
(By direct telepathy, or by some astounding freak of the Doctrine of *
Chances, the Prime Minister, braving superstition, has brought together
in the Education Office these two gentlemen, for whose conjunction Our
Artist has watched with frenzied eagerness for many months.)
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday,
April 14.—With the succession of a
new Premier there were noted certain
indications of indefinite postponement
of the struggle for predominance be-
tween Commons and Lords. To-day,
on meeting of Parliament after inter-
val occasioned by reconstruction of
Ministry, there was forthcoming
evidence of maintenance of deeply-
rooted jealousy and distrust.
SPEAKER took Chair at 2.45 as
usual. Unexpectedly large gathering
on both sides. Questions on Paper
deferred. Only business was moving
of writs for new elections consequent
on Ministerial changes, and the be-
stowal of royal assent on Army
Annual Bill.
List of writs disposed of, when
movement observed in neighbourhood
of door leading to Lobby. Serjeant-
at - Arms hurriedly left his chair.
Loosing his sword in scabbard, he
advanced to door by which hastily
mustered body of messengers. In
the twinkling of an eye the heavy
open door was banged to, closed, and
bolted.
Among startled Members watching
the scene explanation circulated. The
Lords had despatched Black Rod to
summon Commons to other House to
hear royal assent given to Army Bill.
If, however, the proud Peers thought
their emissary would be allowed to
cross the threshold of the Commons
at his will, they were mistaken. The
door barred, a sliding panel cunningly
let in was cautiously withdrawn by
the Serjeant-at-Arms, who casually
inquired, “Who's there?”
Back came the strident answer,
“Black Rod 1 ''
Oh, very well. If that was all, he
might as well come in. Bolts were
ostentatiously withdrawn, the door
flung open, and Black Rod, carrying
his wand of office resting on his
shoulder, entered. A messenger going
before pulled up at the Bar, and,
bowing to the Mace, announced
“Black Rod l’” That functionary,
halting thrice to make obeisance,
advanced, delivered his message, and
retired backwards, threatening at
every step entanglement of his
shapely legs. The SPEAKER and one
or two Ministers present obeyed the
summons, passing out through the
upstanding lines of Members.
This, of course, is no new thing.
A ceremonial dating back to STUART
times, it is solemnly performed when-
ever hapless Black Rod presents him-
self. What was significantly new
was the action of the Chief Whip.
As soon as the first indication of
movement in the Lobby reached the
Treasury Bench, or ever Black Rod
came within sight of the barred door,
GEORGE WHITELEY was on his feet
moving “that the House do now
adjourn.” Had the motion been
carried, there would have been an
end of the business and the sitting.
Black Rod would have been left for-
lorn on the wrong side of the door-
way, and a bloated peerage that
lately threw out a Scotch Small
Holdings Bill would have, so to
speak, bitten the dust.
An anxious pause followed the
action of the Ministerial Whip.
Would the motion be put from the
Chair, and would conflict between
the two Houses be precipitated on
this side issue? Happily the public
peace was saved by the presence of
mind of the SPEAKER. Obviously he
might not be party to revolutionary
procedure. After a brief pause that
to the strained attention seemed to
stretch the full length of fifteen
minutes, he remarked that arrange-

Commission in the other Chamber,
and till its business was fulfilled
motion for the adjournment should

Thus was a Constitutional crisis
averted. Black Rod was permitted
to enter and deliver his message,
and on the return of the SPEAKER
from the other House WHITELEY
again moved the adjournment, this
time with success.

LONDON LETTERS.
II.
DEAR CHARLEs, Many thanks for
your definition of a solstice. Is it
really? Fancy! By answering one
of my questions you become , a
unique correspondent. Nobody else
answers questions in a letter. Some-
times, of course, one is asked,
“What train are you coming down
by on Saturday? Let me know at
once.” But the proper thing to do
in such a case is to wait till Satur-
day afternoon, and then wire “Just
missed the 2.22. Hope to catch
the next.” Questions in letters are
mostly rhetorical; which is why I
ask you, How, oh how could you
have the nerve to head your paper
“Castle Bumpbrook,” and fill it
with arguments against the Licens-
ing Bill? It is hardly decent. You
know, I doubt if you ought even to
have heard of the Licensing Bill at
Castle Bumpbrook.
What I expect from you is pleasant
gossip about the miller's daughter.
Is she engaged yet to the postman 2
Has the choir begun to practise the
Christmas anthem 2 When does
Mrs. BATEs's husband come out 2
These are the things you should tell
me. Tell me, too, of your simple
recreations. Has whist reached
Castle Bumpbrook yet? It is a jolly
game for four. One person deals,
and you turn up the last card, and
then the But I must send you
a book about it. -
I have been having a correspon-
dence with my landlord as to what
I should do in case of fire. Of
course, if your little cottage got
alight, you would simply hop out of
the window on to the geranium bed;
but it is different in London. Par-
ticularly when you are on the top
floor. Well, he tells me that I can
easily get out on to Mr. Podby's
roof next door . . . . and so home.
This is certainly comforting, but—
Podby I I don't like it, CHARLEs.
Supposing anything happened, just
think how it would look in the
papers. “The unfortunate gentle-
man was last seen upon Mr. Podby's
roof . . . .” No, I shall have to
go for the drain-pipe at the back.
Look here, I have two stories to
tell you. One is quite true, the
other isn't. Which will you have
first 2 All right, the truth.
When I first came to town I was
very—I mean I believed everything
I was told. One Sunday I met a
small but elderly gentleman on the
Embankment, who asked me the
way to the German Embassy. He
had the river on his south, so ob-
viously all the Embassies were in the
other direction. I pointed vaguely
towards the north. He thanked me
and said that—— (By the way, do
you prefer oratio recta ? I forgot to
ask you.) Well then, he said :
“The Embassies would be shut on
a Sunday, he in 7 ''
I said: “Doubtless.”
He said: “I am a Professor at
Heidelberg. I have just arrived in
London, and I have no money.
To-morrow I go to my Embassy and
get some. Meanwhile, could you
lend me five shillings?"
CHARLEs, in those days I was
very Well, I gave him half-a-
Crown.
He said: “I should like to pay
this back to you.”
I said: “Quite so. That is the
idea.’’
“Then would you give me your
card, so that I can send you the
money to-morrow 2 ''
Charles, I You see, I had
just had some cards printed. They
had “Mr.’’ on for the first time. I
was very Well, I gave him one.
That ends the first scene. An
interval of nearly five years elapses,
and we come to last Saturday. I was
walking through the Green Park,
when a small but elderly gentleman
came up to me.
He said: “Is this the way to the
School of Music 2''
I said: “Which one do you want?
There is the Guildhall School, and
the Royal College, and the Royal
Academy, and x - -
He thought for a moment, and
then he said in German the German
for “Do you speak German?” (My
dear Charles, I can't spell it.) I
said “Nein.” .
He considered a little, and said,
“Parlez-vous français ?'' I said
(What's the French for “Not
very well?” Well, that 's what I
said.)
At this his face brightened. He
drew a long breath, and began:
“I am a Professor of Music at
Heidelber n >
CHARLEs, I had to interrupt him.
I simply couldn't help it. I said,
“Then you owe me half-a-crown.”
He stopped, and looked at me with
a sort of sad dignity. Then he
turned round with a sigh and plodded
wearily across the Park. And oh, I
do hope he had better luck with
somebody else, because he has been
at it for five years now, and it must
be a heart-breaking life. His hair
had gone quite grey since I saw him
last.
CHARLEs, you do see that that is
a true story, don't you? If I had
been making it up, I should have
said that he gave me back my own
card as a reference. I wonder why
he didn't. I suppose it had got
rather dirty after five years.
Do you want the other one now?
It is the merest anecdote, and HILDA
told it me, and I know it 's not true.
She has a cat called “Didums poor
little kitty wee, then "; you put the
accent on the “then,” and spread
it out as long as you can. Well,
Didums, etc., goes about eating
moths; a curious diet for a cat, but
I believe it keeps them thin. He
swallowed them whole, you know,
and HILDA told him how cruel it was.
She seems to have spoken of the
sufferings of the imprisoned ones in
the most moving terms. Anyhow
she found Didums next day up in her
bedroom remorsefully eating a seal-
skin coat.
I am surprised at HiLDA. If she
is not careful her baby will grow up
a journalist. I have seen him since
he came back from you. This time
I approached from the west, and I
noticed a great difference. He is
certainly a fine child, and as he let
me put him to sleep I love him.
After all, looks don't matter tup-
pence to a man. The great thing
is wisdom. Knowledge comes, but
wisdom lingers. I remember a
General Knowledge Paper in my
Mays. One of the questions was,
“Give a list of the chief coaling-
stations you would pass on your way
to New Zealand.” The only two I
could think of were Cyprus and
Rickett Smith. I never heard whether
I got full marks; probably not. But
since that day knowledge has come,
for I have a friend in the Admiralty.
He was a very high Wrangler the
year I wasn't, and just as FishFR
is the man behind the First Lord,
so he is the man behind Fisher; at
least, he tells me so. And he buys
his tobacco by the knot—or is it the
quid 2—and plays the Hague Conven-
tion at Bridge, and (as I say) knows

“The British Minister and his wife are ex-

They have a special man for that
sort of thing. Omnibi, quori, tertii

A PARABLE FOR PROTECTIONIST8.
THERE was once a Man who lived at
Torquay in excellent health. But one
day a Quack came to him and said:
“My poor friend, you are in a ter-
rible state. You're dying, that 's
what's the matter with you.”
“Am I?’” said the Man anxiously.
“Yes,” said the Quack. “Only
one thing can save you. You must
go and live at Margate. Bracing up,
that 's what you want.”
“But,” said the Man, “I tried
that a long time ago, and it didn't
suit me at all, and I've been here
now for years and years, and x -
“Go to Margate,” said the Quack,
“ or you'll be dead in a week.”
This made the Man so nervous
that he decided to journey to London
and see a Specialist.

“You’re all right,” he said.

“Are you sure?” asked the Man.
“Quite.”
“And if I stay at Torquay I shall
be perfectly well ?”
“Perfectly,” said the Specialist.
“You pledge your reputation on

to be certain. -
“I do,” said the Specialist.
“Then I shall go back to Tor-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARſ.
THINKING ALOUD.
By JAMEs Watts-Douglas.
(Author of “The Quintessence of
Eulogy,” “Pinolatrous Ponder-
ings,” etc.)
I REMEMBER as if it were yesterday
a certain morning in 1884. I was
then living in the wilds of Dunton
Green, and I had ordered from
London a new umbrella modelled
on the picturesque and magnificent
implement wielded by the immortal
author of Aylwin. When the post-
man put the parcel into my hand,
I trembled with the foretaste of joy.
I can see myself very plainly, a
vague-faced boy with a mist of down
on lip and cheek—both as yet inno-
cent of the safety razor—with hesi-
tant eyes, and a lambent, limpid
laugh. . . . There I stood, greedily
alone, nursing my selfish bliss. That
moment became a landmark of my
youth, and to this day I associate
the name of Dunton with a brown-
paper parcel and a downy stripling
stricken with jealous delight. There
are other famous personages con-
nected with umbrellas in history and
romance—GEORGE Borrow and Mrs.
Gamp and Mr. GLADSTONE, to men-
tion only three—but the parapluie
of my friend ALGERNoN DUNTON, like
that of the King of DAHOMEy,
standeth alone “as the nightingale
sings.” Withdrawn beneath its
spacious canopy, he dwells aloof in
the tents of his soul, austerely de-
tached from all literary cliques and
coteries, and communing with all the
mighty masters of the immemorial
past. . . . But in those days I
did not even dream, callow child
that I was, that I should ever
see the owner of this priceless and
impayable pagoda. Heu vatum
ignarae vates / You know BRow N-
ING's lines:—
“And did you once see ALgy clear,
And did he stop and stamp,
And did you on all fours draw near,
And serenade his gamp?”
+ x +: *
Let me tell you how I first saw
ALGERNoN. I was free-wheeling over
Putney Bridge one rapturous spring
morning when suddenly I was aware
of a limber, lithe, lyrical figure
gradually outstripping me from be-
hind. He was not like anyone I had
ever seen, but I recognised him at
once. He was striding along at a
terrific pace, his step had the aban-
don of a Samothracian gazelle, and
ever and anon he waved as it had
been the mystica vannus Iacchi, his
great green Gargantuan gamp. His
clothes were negligible, and his mag-
nificent head was obscured by an
unbecoming puggaree; but the man
was palpitating with vibrant vitality,
he was vibrating with vital palpita-
tions, he was vitalised with palpitant
vibrations. The sight set my flesh
aflame and my nerves afire. I wept
tears of rapture. I was torn out of
the world by the tempestuous rhythm
of his enormous en-tout-cas. The
life around me became remote, and 1
looked upon my fellow-men as I
looked upon the cattle in the fields.
They were outside my Paradise. As
the man went by our eyes met, and
I felt in my bones that he was either
ALGERNoN Ashton or ALGERNoN
DUNTON. : -
× ** ... + . **
The next time I saw him it was
at “The Artichokes,” the famous
semi-detached villa on Primrose Hill
in which he has lived with his illus-
trious friend THEoPHILU's BoTTs for
the last fifty years. I was taking
down a monologue of Mr. Botts’s
when the poet burst into the library.
He was fresh from his morning walk.
It had been raining heavily, and as
the sun, with pardonable intrusion,
shone on him, the raindrops on his
pontifical beard shone like diamonds,
and I saw that he was drenched to
his superb and spacious skin. It was
indeed an intolerably exhilarating ex-
perience, and again I wept tears of
rapture. Religious mystics record
their exaltations, and I really do not
see why mystic poetists—to use the
adorable word coined by The Daily
Chronicle—should not record theirs.
Looking at his magnificent head

THE NEW AUTOCRAT.
ERE hockey had shown her what
sport meant,
Ere yet she grew giddy and pert,
She doted on dolls and deportment,
And only came down for dessert:
Her sisters would apprehend no
sting
From one so exceedingly green,
Nor jibbed at the casual toasting
Of bashful fifteen.
Her tastes were not always con-
sidered;
She seldom got more than her
share;
And parents, whenever the kid erred,
Brought suitable pressure to bear !
But gone is the rule of the hoar
head;
Old age is dismissed with a grunt;
And youth's irrepressible forehead
Has come to the front
O wormwood and gall to our women
O torture far worse than the rack,
To find that the smartest of trim men
Are off on a different tack:
For both at the helm and the prow,
too,
There lolls an unspeakable chit,
And Thirty now learns she must bow
to
Fourteen and a bit !
Her locks are confined by a ribbon;
Her language is open and free;
She talks like a parrot, she 's glib on
The problems that petrify me;
Her phrases are novel; to-day, what
I marvel at most are the queer
Little statements she clinches with
“Eh, what l”
Tacked on to “Old dear!”
Though chaperons tell her where
minxes
Are certain to go when they die,
A sequence of eloquent winks is
Her sole and sufficient reply;
Though dowagers, itching to slap her,
Would send her in tears to her bed,
The simply ineffable Flapper
Goes smiling instead
And yet, when reflective December
Repines at the pertness of May,
Sweet solace it is to remember
She too has her time of decay:
She too, when she starts to put flesh
On,
Will take a subordinate post,
While babies, devoid of discretion,
Are ruling the roast !

º (By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE been counting up Mr. MARION CRAWFORD's
novels and find they reach the respectable figure of 35.
Pretty well; but better still is the fact that there is
nowhere any sign of haste or indication of failing power.
His latest—The Prima Donna (MACMILLAN)—reaches
the level established a quarter of a century ago. It
opens effectively with a scene in a New York opera-
house. An explosion shakes the building to its founda-
tion. The lights go out; panic ensues; there is danger
of great loss of life, when the Prima Donna begins her
song again, holds the audience spellbound, and averts
catastrophe. Mr. CRAWFORD speedily changes the scene
to England, where the mystery of the murder of a
young girl in the opera-house on the night of the ex-
plosion is unravelled: A minor plot shrouding the
away, did you? The authors are EDEN PHILLPOTTs and
ARNoLD BENNETT, so that in addition to the adventures
you have both humour and style. Why should not other
authors take a holiday together and collaborate in a book
of this kind? Messrs. HENRY JAMEs and BART
KENNEDY, for instance, might give us a splendid story,
full of sentences about the right length. I must not
expect to see this suggestion adopted immediately, but
the interval of waiting will not be long if the PHILL-
PoTTs-BENNETT combination continues to give such
pleasant entertainment.

came of the Mariage de Convenance between ANDREAs,
Prince of Hungary, and GIovaNNA, Queen of Naples,

colouring, a Neapolitan ice | Thus, in the first para-

acquaintance of Van Torp, the American millionaire,
and the daughter of an English Peer, is cleverly main-
tained and satisfactorily worked out. Mr. CRAWFORD
is a shrewd observer of men and women, especially
women. His description of one sitting down for the first
time in a perfectly new gown is a masterpiece of close
observation and original thought. It is a safe assertion
that no one before thought of the serpent in this connec-
tion. When it is suggested, there seems a good deal
in it.
That The Statue (CAssELL) is really an exciting story
you will agree when you hear that it includes one
murder, one secret trial—I mean marriage, between the
son of the man who was killed and the daughter of the
man who killed him, two detectives, one proper trial
with reporters, one escape from Dartmoor, one Cabinet
meeting, and one threatened war between Germany and
France. It also contains the secret of the statue itself,
which was nothing more nor less than—see Chapter
XXV. You didn't really think I was going to give it
the olives silver and grey, and the foam of cherry-
trees white. Miss Bowen has a wonderful eye for
colour, particularly that affected by the beardless

or the Empire—on boat-race night.
portraits, landscapes, interiors, battle-pieces, and
murder scenes nearly all reek of it; and yet they all
prove her to be a born painter. She takes the dry
bones of Neapolitan history, A.D. 1343, and really makes
them live, clothed on with flesh and blood (especially
blood), and decked in all the colours of the rainbow.
Personally I could do with rather less of the predominant
colour. When I sit down to sup on horrors I don't like
them quite so underdone. Still I think this is Miss
Bow EN’s best book up to date.

AIRS OF AN EXILE.
Oxford MEMORIES.
OH, in the day when Folly decked my brows,
And prescient manhood bloomed upon my cheek;
When I combined a genius for carouse
With Socialism and the bards in Greek;
When that first “fancy knitted " oriflamme
Of freshness lent my limbs a suppler grace;
When I evinced a taste for epigram
And hung a “Captain WARREN '' in my face;
When in an atmosphere of Gothic age, -
Fixed seats and sporting prints and BERNARD SHAw
I throve on picnics, port and persiflage,
Drank Audit ale and took a “third ” in Law,
I little dreamed how soon would come a time
When I should be collecting outlawed bills,
Preparing leases and defending crime,
In far-off townships under alien hills.
I was immortal then; inured to Art,
And dandled on the lap of every Muse,
I pored on HAMERTON in groves apart,
Derided MILL and scoffed at NIETzsche's views.
PATER was mine, and SYMoNds; MATTHEw A.,
RUskIN and MoRRIs held me in their thrall;
I babbled BRAHMs with men of kindred clay,
And sat out ELGAR in the Balliol Hall.
And there were days when, straining at the oar,
I stapped my vitals for the College weal;
Stroked (with consummate pride) a “junior four,”
And ate raw beef at every other meal.
And there were moments, birthday wines and bump
Suppers when, pledged to woo the vinous god,
I haled the College porter to the pump
And lit a bonfire in the chapel quad.
But now—Ye Gods ! can I be that same youth
That down the classic Cher was used to roam,
Pressing the search for elegance and truth,
Aided by frequent subsidies from home?
Am I that youth whose cynicisms wrung
AEsthetic coteries' approving smiles;
Round whose Apolline limbs sublimely clung
Distinguished raiment in the latest styles?
Here in a ten-floor office block I ply
The small attorney's inexpensive trade;
No fires of inspiration light this eye,
My speech is terse, my costume ready-made.
Codes of absurd procedure hold in check
A soul once intimate with all the bards;
I pour the shameless cocktail down my neck,
Start work at eight and spend the night at cards.
Briefly from Intellect's essential springs,
A cultured exquisite, I quaff no more,
But toil, the victim of material things,
A seedy exile on an alien shore.
I don't repine; but ofttimes in the sad
Long sleepless hours I murmur, “Would that I
Were once again the careless undergrad,
That trickled blithely down the dear old 'High.’”

LONDON LETTERS.
III.
DEAR CHARLEs, Do you truly want
me to recommend you something to
read? Well, why not try the serial
story in some ha'penny paper? There
you get a glimpse of the real thing. I
turned idly to Lepers in Israel (or
whatever it is called) last night, and
found myself suddenly up to the neck
in tragedy. Lord Billingham. .
CHARLEs, you 're a married man,
tell me if it really is so. The gentle
Pamela is urged by a cruel mother
to espouse Lord Billingham for his
money's sake. Lord B. is a vulgar
brute, I'm afraid; in any case
Pamela is all for young Prendergast;
but one must be sensible, you know,
and money does make a difference,
doesn't it? So she becomes Lady
Billingham; and a year or two later
Prendergast comes back from South
Africa to find that it is he who is the
real Lord Billingham after all. (I
got most of this from the “synop-
sis,” which enables you to start the
story now, so I can't say how it was
they overlooked him in the first
place.) It would be extremely cruel
(you see that, CHARLEs?) to talk
about it, because Pamela would then
become plain Mrs. Stubbs, and no
money at all; so Prendergast decides
to say nothing to anybody. But he
was reckoning without Mrs. Tre-
velyan, no less. Mrs. Trevelyan
finds out the secret, and threatens
Prendergast that she will tell every-
body that he is the real Lord Billing-
ham unless he marries her. So of
course he has to.
It is at this moment that we meet
Capt. Pontifaz. Capt. Pontifaz is
in love with Mrs. Trevelyan, at least
he thinks he is, and he says that if
she doesn't marry him he will let
on about what happened to Mr.
Trevelyan, who was supposed to have
died of old age. At the same time
the news gets out that Prendergast is
really Lord Billingham, and so
Pamela does become Mrs. Stubbs;
and as Prendergast cannot honour-
ably withdraw from the alliance he is
about to contract with Mrs. Tre-
velyan, it looks as though she is going
to be Lady Billingham. But on the
eve of the wedding a body is found
at the bottom of the old chalk
quarry. . . Whose 2 . . .
What I want to hear from you,
CHARLEs, is, Do people always get
married for this sort of reason? Are
you really the Duke of Norfolk, and
did KITTY discover your secret and
, threaten to disclose it? Oh, you
"coward I don't mind anybody
knowing that I am the true Earl
BILLINGHAM.
About the body. We shall know
to-morrow. I think it's Capt. Ponti-
far myself, but I will send you a
telegram.
Are you an authority on dress? A
man got into my carriage on the Dis-
trict to-day wearing a top hat, a
frock coat, and brown boots. Is that
right? I ask it seriously, because
the point I want to discover is this:
Supposing you suddenly found that
you had nothing in the house but
brown boots and a frock coat, would
a bowler or a topper be the better
way out of it?
You see the idea, CHARLEs.
add a bowler then the thing you have
to explain away is the coat. I don't
quite see how that is to be managed;
you could only put it down to absent-
mindedness. But if you add a topper
then you have only the brown boots
to account for. This could be done
in a variety of ways. A foggy morn-
ing, a sudden attack of colour-blind-
ness, or that your mother asked you
to wear the thickest ones, dear, and
never mind about the silly fashion.
It is an interesting point which has
never been dealt with properly in the
etiquette books. You and I are
agreed upon the topper, it seems.
I went to a play last Tuesday. It
was not bad, but the funniest scene
happened right at the beginning,
when I watched an American buy a
seat at the box-office. They gave him
J13. and he only discovered it after
he had paid for it, and had put his
change carefully away. Do you
know, CHARLEs, he nearly cried. The
manager assured him there was
nothing in it; people sat there every
night, and were heard of again. It
was no good. He got his money
back, and went away looking quite
miserable. Isn't it childish 2 I am
going to be married on Friday, May
13, just to show. When is that?
Sickening if it's not for years and
years and years. I have a patent
calendar somewhere which tells you
the date for any year up to 1928. I
never know why it should stop there;
something to do with the Golden
Number getting too big. It won't go
backwards either, which is a pity,
because I have always wanted to
know on what day of the week I was
born. Nobody will tell me. It was
one of the lucky days, I am sure.
How can I find out?
To-morrow.—I have just sent you
a telegram to say that it was Sir
Richard Tressider's body. Strange
that you hadn't thought of him.
CHARLEs, I felt very shy in the Post
Office. Yes, about Castle Bump-
If you ||
brook. She didn't believe there was
such a place; I offered to bet. We
went through the Telegraph Direc-
tory together. Do you know, you
come in the Castles, not in the
Bumps at all. (Put me among the
Bumps.) Something ought to be done
about it. I always thought Castle
was your Christian name, kind of.
Yes, it was Sir Richard's corsp. It
occurs to me now that you will get
this letter a day after the telegram.
How did I put it?
“Body believed to be that of Sir
Richard Tressider. Death certified
as by drowning. Inspector Stockley
suspects foul play.”
An eleven-penny touch, CHARLEs,
and I never signed it, and you'll
wonder what on earth it 's all about.
Probably you will dismiss it as a
joke, and that would be elevenpence
thrown away. This cannot be al-
lowed. You can get a telegram re-
peated at half price, can't you? I
think I shall go and have a fivepenny
ha'penny repeat.
I say, what are you doing about
the weather? Are you taking it lying
down? I want to sign a petition, or
write to my M.P. (haven't got one,
then I shall write to yours), humbly
showing that it 's the rottenest do
there's ever been. Do you remember
the story (it comes in Gesta Roman-
orum, or should) of the man who built
a model of another man and threw
things at it, and the other man sat
in a bath with a mirror in his hand,
and whenever the first man threw he
ducked under the water. If he got
under in time his enemy missed, and
it was all right. Otherwise he was
killed. Well, I am going to rig up a
Negretti in my room, and throw
boots at it, and if the original has to
spend all his time in a cold bath.
ducking, I think, CHARLEs, we shall
get some warmer weather soon.
“Oh, how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day.”
CHARLEs, in your courting days was
she ever as cold to you as this? Poor
old dear! Never mind, it's all right
now. Give her my love, and believe
me to be always yours, A. A. M.
E.

THE PASSIONATE GOLFER T0 HIS LOWE.
DEAREST, it almost breaks my heart
To speak the word that bids us part
For ever past recall.
Were you less charming, had you less
Of that perfection in excess
Which holds my soul in thrall,
I might dismiss you from my mind
At lucid intervals, and find
My eye upon the ball.
Now, when I raise my club to drive
My well-meant efforts seldom thrive,
Your presence seems too near.
No open champion, since the sky
Saw the first shaggy divot fly,
The first bare patch appear,
Could at one time in rapture dwell
On all the charms you wield so well
And also strike the sphere.
So when I'm playing through the
green
The thought of all your grace, my
queen,
Intoxicates like wine.
"Witch'd by your beauty's mute
appeal,
'Stead of the leathern grip, I feel
Your tender hand in mine.
Then if I press, oh, who could blame?
Not Zeno's self, yet all the same
The ball goes off the line.
But, ah! my cup of woe is full
When after socket, slice and pull
Or fatuous half-topped roll,
Forth from the bunkers' grim embrace
With trembling lip and pallid face
At last I near the hole—
Only to find, absorbed in you,
One cannot putt and worship too—
Each meeds a single soul!
So we must part; but not all grey
Will be your solitary way,
For though our bonds I snap,
*You'll watch as I relinquish fast
Stroke after stroke until at last
I offer you, mayhap,
To dull the pain of parting thus

said “that the colouring of the hair,

that the work is original. While
tolerably certain that the painting is
a Van Dyck, Frau Hoegel, thinks
there is a bare possibility that it may
be a Rubens.”

here, a having-it-both-ways line of

one to become “a high authority on

We may try it ourselves. “Yes,
sir, it is certainly an old painting.
Look at the dirt and the cracks. At
present, since the surface is entirely
black, it is hard to say whether it is
a Velasquez or a Tintoretto; but both
have been dead some years, and both
used oils.”

gone—“It may of course be a |
Leonardo, but if not, why should it
not be a Luini? They were very
much alike. Perhaps Luinardo is
the best ascription.”

let it obtain a worthier grant. Busi-

it is an interesting work. If it is not

doubt, it is a Van Hier. In his best

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DONE INTO ENGLISH.
According to “Playgoer’’ in The Weekly Dispatch,
“a London manager says that the next time he buys a
play on the Continent he will have it done into English
at a translation bureau, and that version, polished up a
little, will stand every bit as good a chance of catching
the public support as a version for which he would have
to pay fees.”
Of course the London manager is absolutely right;
the manners and customs of polite society in England
and France have become so similar—especially since the
Entente Cordiale—that the services of a skilled adapter
are now superfluous. In support of this assertion Mr.
Punch begs to submit a few specimen extracts from a
verbatim translation of a modern comedy by one of the
most brilliant and successful of Parisian dramatists.
The scene, it is true, has been changed from Trouville
and Deauville to St. Leonards and Bexhill; the names
of the characters have been Anglicised, while as many
of them as possible have been given titles in order to
render the play interesting to a West End audience.
But otherwise his translator has faithfully followed the
original text:—
Act I.-A large apartment in Seaview Villa, St.
Leonards, occupied by Lord RoNALD SHILLINGFORD,
and his widowed sister, Lady LAURA STREATLEY.
Lord Ronald (to one of his guests, Sir Joseph BRYANT,
a Sheffield ironmaster). Whatever, may come of it, we
will try, dear Sir Joseph, not to leave you too bad an
impression of our St. Leonards.
Sir Joseph. And I am not sorry, besides, to see what
a pleasure-city at the commencement of the twentieth
century is like.
Lord R. You have permitted me, have you not, to
introduce some of our friends to you presently 2 We
shall have Lord HURSTMonceUx (to LUCIAN BRYANT, Sir
Joseph's son). In fact, HURSTMONCEUx is a schoolfellow
of ours. We shall have WELDHAM—steelworks, forges,
blast-furnaces, metallurgy—like you.
Lucian (modestly). A hundred times larger!
Lord R. I say, there is one who has a constitution of
steel. He is a little good man of nothing at all. Since
the death of WELDHAM père he conducts all alone a
colossal business, which does not prevent him from
enjoying himself.
Sir Joseph. Yes, he is the holiday-making manufac-
turer, one of the marvels of contemporary industry
Lord R. Ah, there he is, arriving from the shore with
Lady MAINWARING.. I was forgetting to tell you that we
are dining with Lady MAIN wariNG, his cousin.
Lady Laura. What will Sir Joseph think? She is not
only his cousin, she is also his fiancée. She is a charm-
ing woman, divorced from Sir HEctoR MAINw ARING, who
has conducted himself odiously to her.
Lord R. Our other guests are two club friends—WINK-
worth and KENNARD. They are very nice.
Lady Laura. Very nice, but great gossips, and slightly
slanderous.
Sir Joseph. That is of no consequence.
(Enter WELDHAM and Lady MAINwaring.)
Lord R. Dear friends !
Weldham. My good SHILLING Ford
Lord R. Introductions are unnecessary. Let us effect
them in a summary manner. (To Lady M.) Dear
Madam, Sir Joseph BRYANT, Mr. LUCIAN BRYANT.
Lady Laura (to Mrs. LUcIAN B.). Lady MAINw ARING
—Mrs. LUCIAN BRYANT.
Lord R. (presenting WELDHAM). Mr. WELDHAM.
Lucian. Sir! (He presses his hand while inclining
himself.)
Lord R. (to the Hon. MonTY WINKworth and ALGIE
KENNARD). My dear friends ! (Introduces them.)
Monty Winkworth. Madam, Sir.
Kennard (same business, to Lady M.). Dear madam.
(WINKworth and KENNARD proceed to talk scandal about
Lord HURSTMONCEUx.)
Lady Mainwaring (laughing). I do not detest, myself,
that one slanders Lord HURSTMONCEUX |
Winkworth (gracefully). You ! You are in love with
him. It is another thing.
Weldham (to Sir Joseph and LUCIAN). Yes, ravished
that our friend SHILLING FORD has placed us in communi-
cation. (Enter Lord HURSTMONceux.)
Lord Hurstmonceuz (going straight to Lady LAURA).
Madam, my homage. (He kisses her hand. After being
presented to Mrs. LUCIAN, and finding that she has for-
gotten his having been presented to her on a former
occasion.) I regret no longer having passed unperceived,
since it procures me the pleasure of recalling that little
incident to you.
Lady Laura. Come, gentlemen, let us take a turn in
the garden while we are waiting for dinner.
Lord Hurst. At your orders, Madam. (He takes her
hand familiarly and places it on his arm.)
[In the next Act the scene is a terrace at Lady MAIN-
wariNg's house at Beachill, close to the sea.]
Weldham (to Lord RoNALD). My dear, you will be-
lieve me if you like. I have never had any success
with women. I proclaim it to my shame. Explain that
to me. - -
Lord R. Perhaps you are too gay.
Weldham. Then, why do the music-hall singers have
so much 2
Lord R. Because they are dull in private life.
Lady Mainw. (to Lord R. and the BRYANTs). You will
take lunch with us?
Weldham. On the yacht, you know. On the yacht !
Lady Mainw. Have you given notice to the Blue
Hungarians?
Lord R. Blue Hungarians ! In broad daylight?
Weldham. Why not? I wish this affair to be
tumultuous. (Music without.) Come. Go ahead. The
Hungarians arrive. Do you hear them? They are
thawing their fingers. Sir Joseph, you are as nice as
everything to come to visit my little installation.
Sir Joseph. Tell me, my dear Mr. WELDHAM, are your
Blue Hungarians going to accompany us to the yacht?
(Enter Blue Hungarians.)
Weldham. Reassure yourself. We are not going to
pass through all the crowd with music. And besides, it
will be very well, you know. They will applaud our
passage like madmen. Bexhill is very gay this year.
[Later.—The Hon. Monty and ALGY KENNARD have
been hinting that Lord H. has made a conquest of
Mrs. LUCIAN BRYANT.].
Monty Winkworth (to Lord H. mysteriously). My
compliments, dear friend
Algy. An extra page for my posthumous biography of

y Lord Hurst. Do you want still another?
Algy. I should think so I Women? No. Duel?

indiscretion, are your adversaries?

That woman's mission was to be a wife

Was taught the way to grill, and stew, and fry,
And had the very daintiest hand at making
A cake, a tart, a pudding, or a pie.
She had that skill to sew and darn which does band
The peaceful home in bonds serene and glad;
She 'd all a wife requires—except a husband,
And somehow he was never to be had.
Meanwhile, across the road, at No. 7,

She 'd sunny hair, and eyes as blue as heaven,
A dimpled smile, and pretty baby ways.
But, ahl she had not one domestic habit,
'She could not mend a sock, or bake a tart,
Or even skin an ordinary rabbit—
Her parents simply spoiled her from the start.
But now she 's married; for her useless beauty
Fevered, the brow beneath a coronet;
Whilst JANE, expert in every wifely duty,
Lives in a flat, a lonely Suffragettel

ExTRACT FROM THE RECEss DIARY or
Toby, M.P.
Buscot Park, Monday.—Brought
with me for reading in rare lei-
sure time ARTHUR DASENT's Life
and Letters of his Uncle, JoHN
THADEUs DELANE, sometime Editor
of The Times, just published by
MURRAY. Not given to the average
nephew to approach GEORGE, TRE-
vely.AN in recording the life of
MACAULAY, DASENT has successfully
accomplished a task of some delicacy.
DELANE was not only Editor of
The Times through stirring periods of
history. He was the friend, confi-
dant, and counsellor of the men who
in Cabinet Council guided the des-
tinies of the Empire. In these latter
days The Times has added to its staff
a gentleman known as Parliamentary
Lobbyist, a purveyor of political
notes. For thirty-seven years DELANE
was not only Editor of the paper but
was its direct medium of political in-
formation. Through successive Min-
istries he occupied a position akin
to that of honorary member of
the Cabinet. CLARENDoN, ABERDEEN,
more constantly and intimately
PALMERSTON, in personal interviews
or in long letters, informed him in
fullest detail, not only of the political
situation at home and abroad, but of
Cabinet intention upon pending
issues. In 1852, when the DERBY
Administration was being formed,
Dizzy, Chancellor of the Exchequer
and Leader of the Commons, wrote
him no fewer than four letters within
forty-eight hours. One contained
promise of the list of the new
Ministry, which, “if it be possible
I will send you for a second edition
to-morrow.” Amongst Premiers an
exception in this respect was made
in case of Lord JoHN RUssBIL,
whose icy manner is deplored by
the biographer. GLADSTONE also
habitually refrained from secret in-
tercourse with the powerful Editor.
As far as it affected business in
Printing House Square that did not
matter, since there were colleagues
eager to contribute information. In
1867, when a private meeting of
the Liberal Party was held at
GLADSTONE's house to decide on its at-
titude towards Dizzy's Reform Bill,
DELANE had only to write to four Mem-
bers in order to secure full narrative of
proceedings carried on behind locked
doors. Of his correspondents three
were C. P. VILLIERs, HENRY BRAND
(afterwards Speaker), and BERNAL
OSBoRNE, a habitual purveyor of
political and social news. Lord Tor-
RINGTON, one of the Lords-in-Waiting
at Windsor, gloried in the name of
“Your Windsor Special.” When
on duty at the Court he daily wrote
to Printing House Square reporting

its tittle-tattle, and what QUEEN
VICTORIA said to him in private con-
versation.
When in 1857 a new Parliament
was elected, PALMERSTON consulted
DELANE on the choice of Speaker,
accepting his designation of EveLYN
DENison. Four years later he
offered him Ministerial office, sug-
gesting that he should become Under-
Secretary of War. Small wonder
that the flattering proposal was de-
clined. To vacate the throne in
Printing House Square for an Under
Secretaryship would have been poor
promotion.
This was a unique position for a
journalist to hold. Its long con-
tinuance testified to DELANE's trust-
worthiness. He never betrayed a
confidence. Even more greatly to his
honour, his favour was not purchas-
able by its bestowal. Dizzy's assidu-
ous court to the great man was at an
early stage rewarded by the appear-
ance in The Times of a review of
Coningsby, which he “read with
pain and astonishment, a review cal-
culated to do the work very great in-
jury.” DELANE accepted the favour
of contributions by Cabinet Minis-
ters to his news-chest, but he recog-
nised that the power and influence of
The Times were based upon the foun-
dations of public spirit, concern for
national interest, and absolute im-
partiality in dealing with statesmen.
PALMERston was his personal friend
and his hero. But if he differed from
him on matters of public policy he
did not hesitate to state his views in
the rolling periods of a leading article.
There were two institutions whose
welfare lay close to the heart of
DELANE. First came The Times,
next the British Empire. In his own
mind doubtless the interests were
identical. He served them both with
unfailing loyalty, unflagging labour,
making and maintaining the position
of a morning newspaper at a height
of power never before reached or
since paralleled.

AMERICA IN LONDON.
The College Widow, a comedy of
American 'Varsity life, is given
nightly in the original American at
the Adelphi Theatre. It is a glorious
entertainment for everybody; for, if
you are a native, you appreciate Mr.
GEORGE ADE's humour, and, if you
are a Britisher, you are delighted by
the novelty of the mise-en-scène.
When Mr. MICHAEL MoRTON or Mr.
SYDNEY GRUNDY has “adapted " it
into English (I am sure one of them
must) the story will run as follows:—
Act I.-The beginning of the Lent
Term at Cambridge. Mr. Muttle-
bury is in despair, for the boat is in a
hopeless condition. Oxford is bound
to win. While he is discussing the
situation with various undergrads in
the Trinity Great Court, Bolton, an
English millionaire, comes along. He
offers to bet a thousand pounds that
Oxford will win, and mentions that
his son Billy, the famous stroke, is
just going up. The bet is taken;
Billy himself appears on his way to
Oxford in charge of a tutor; where-
upon Mr. Muttlebury conceives the
idea of kidnapping him. The pret-
tiest Girton girl is asked to flirt with
him, in the hopes that her fascina-
tions will induce him to remain at
Cambridge. She consents.
Act II.--Loíd Rayleigh's monthly
dance at Cambridge, dress optional.
The Chancellor addresses the under-
graduates, and hopes they 'll have a
jolly evening. The undergraduates
all shake hands with each other.
Jane Witherspoon, the Girton girl,
gives Billy several dances, and per-
suades him to stay on at Cambridge.
Billy announces to Mr. Muttlebury
his readiness to occupy the stroke
thwart if required. “Cambridge'
Cambridge Cambridge | Rah
Rah || Rah ''
Act III.-Putney. Lord Rayleigh
addresses the crew. Billy franti-
cally in love with Jane, and ready for
anything. Jane asks him not to
strain himself. He laughs at the
idea, and says that he has often
rowed before for Durham v. Man-
chester. “They're off ” Mr.
Muttlebury frightfully keen, but not
quite sure whether he 'll watch them,
or stay and remonstrate with Jane
for leading Billy on. Billy is row-
ing like a demon. “Now then, boys,
give 'em ten.” Hooray! Cambridge
wins ! “ Bolton / Bolton / Bolton /
Rah! Rah! Rah! ” Oh lor', here 's
his father l
“My son 's in the wrong boatſ
Help! ”
Act IV.-The celebrations at Cam-
bridge. Billy decides to chuck row-
ing and marry Jane. He forgives her
for her share in the kidnapping. Old
Mr. Bolton pays up his thousand
pounds and forgives Billy. Lord
Rayleigh forgives everybody. Cur-
tain.
So you see what jolly good fun it
all is. If anybody says it isn't we
will drink his bad health. With
musical honours, gentlemen, please.
“For he's a squab and a pin-head,
For he 's a squab and a pin-head,
For he's a squab and a web-footed rube,
And so say all of us.
It's a way we have at Atwater,
It's a way we have at Bingham,
(Both American 'Varsities),
Which nobody can deny.”

If 2 + 2 was set to shatter
A brain with theorems alive,
Contemptuous of a pedant's patter
He put the answer down as 5.
'Twas much the same with CHARLEs’

He lived among the shadowy dead;
But substantives the form were pat in
Got jumbled up inside his head.
And so each morn he failed in
grammar;
Each morn, since there was none

He got his trousers warmed as well.
Till finally the Head, a dullard
Whose mental vision, bleared and

Requested CHARLEs to pack and go.

Once more (for mere routine too

WHAT they want on Isle Raven is a mat... A large
mat and a qualified referee. No self-respecting native
of this extraordinary spot can meet a fellow-islander,
or for that matter a harmless visitor from the mainland
either, without instantly closing with him (or her) in a
silent death-struggle. The story (written by Owen
WAUGHAN and published by Duckworth), rages and
seethes round the claim to possession of this modern
Corcyra, where law is of no avail and policemen would
be murdered at sight. The islanders are of Black Mat-
thew's brood, and they raven, it appears, in the year
1902 as they ravened in the time of Prince RUPERT (who
gave the place to their ancestor). Their eyes flush red
and their foreheads grow purple on the slightest provoca-
tion, and sometimes, so far as the reader can perceive,
on none at all. Nor does the author's style fall short
He shows by diagrams galore
How to control your swing,
And how the freakish rubber-core
Behaves when on the wing.
In short, all golfers who aspire
To reach the highest grade,
Should buy or borrow, steal or hire
The work of JAMIE BRAID.
P.S.—Advanced Golf is the title
Of this delectable recital,
Published quite recently at ten-
And-six by Messrs. METHUEN.
The heroines of Mrs. CoNYERs' clever sporting novel
Three Girls and a Hermit (HUTCHINsoN) seem to me to
have points in common with their hunters. Miss Moira
Considine, like her horse The Star, was inclined to take
the bit between her teeth and bolt. Eva bore a resem-
of the passions of his
characters. Incoherent
blance to Gog — a sur-
prisingly unenterprising
sentences abound, and the
nominativus pendens is as
common as the beetling
brow; yet there is a kind
of wild poetry which car-
ries us violently over the
most rocky places. The
book opens with the in-
cident of a motor-smash
caused by one of the claim-
ants, who calmly drives
a “beam-and-spike" har-
row across the roadway to
intercept a car arriving
some forty miles an hour
above the speed-limit;
but the ferocity of this
encounter is nothing to
cro ºneº-º-o-
animal—while Kathleen's
hunter was of an indepen-
dent frame of mind, and
determined to be “in
at the finish.” In justice
let me add that the Misses
Considine had many
charming qualities which
were conspicuously lacking
in their horses. Owing to
Miss Moira's desire to
hunt foxes, and—-if the
truth must be told—hus-
bands as well, the Con-
sidines left the remote
corner of Kerry, where
they had been brought up,
and descended upon the

To reach a higher plane,
No better book can Punch commend
To realise that aim
Than that which JAMIE BRAID has penned

FLOWER OF ORANGE.
BY AN Egoist ABROAD. *
White noon that on the columned patio falls
Still leaves the flanking chambers dim and cool,
Here where the swart kings held their alien rule
Behind Alcázar's battlemented walls.
Cusped arch and arabesque and cedar dome
Endure for sign of their illustrious reign,
Wrought in a borrowed art when royal Spain
Once more was mistress in her ancient home.
And here the terraced gardens lie below,
Lovely with rose and iris and the scent
Of myrtle labyrinths where lovers went
Losing their ways and hearts—how long ago!
Made restive by a poignant itch for rhyme,
I yearn, among these Andalusian bowers,
To conjure back from sleep the golden hours,
And solve the strange conundrums set by Time.
Here, then, they lived and loved (or so 'tis said),
Here strolled in couples, trailing courtly feet,
Bathed on occasion in the broiling heat,
And ultimately vanished, being dead.
And was their life-work largely lost in air?
I have no certain news how that may be,
But this I know, because my eyes, can see—
At least they kept their pleasaunce green and fair.
Acting without posterity's advice,
Could it occur to them that some fine day
I too, the ages' heir, might walk this way
And want to find their gardens looking nice?
Not it. They failed to read their mission clear,
Yet served, unconsciously, that useful end,
Giving me (see enclosed) my chance to send

[She faces collar, and with considerable difficulty pro-
ceeds to put tie in with long end on her own right.
He. There, I knew it, I knew it! You've done it
wrong !
She. I haven't! (Flaunting the collar in his face.)
He. You have I told you to put the long end on the
right side, and you've got it on the left.
[He attempts to snatch collar with his left hand. She
retreats a pace or two.
She. I know you said the right side, and I've got it
on the right side.
He (in despair). Very well, then, put it on me and
you 'll see.
[She puts it round his neck, and contemplates her
work.
She (triumphantly). There, it is on my right.
He (in irritation). Yes, but it's on my left
She. Oh, that 's what you meant, was it? Why didn't
you say so at the very beginning?
[Removes collar and readjusts tie properly.
He. I did say so, only you wouldn't understand me.
Now, come, do hurry up and let's get the thing done.
[She fires collar at the back, and then begins a desperate
battle with the front stud.
He (as , the battle proceeds). Oh-ow—-ugh—ouch
Don't pinch. Wow! Wow! You're choking me !

She (shaking him as a terricr shakes a rat, and speak-
ing with set teeth). I'll—do—it—or—-die" Keep still,
can't you. Let me get my thumb in at the back of that
stud. There, done it.
[She lets go of him, and he sinks down on a chair. The
breakfast gong sounds, and steps are heard patter-
ing down the stairs. Children begin to shout below.
She. There 's the gong ! Get up quick, and let me
tie it.
He (rising meekly). You can't do it.

She. Stuff and nonsense ! Which end first?
He. Wind the long end twice round the short end.
[She does this.
She. Next, please.
He (looking or cr her shoulder into the glass). Pass it
up. No, not in front. At the back—at the back, I say!
Oh, that 's all wrong. You'll have to do it from
behind.
She (attempting to do this). I can't reach properly.
You must make yourself shorter. That's better. Now
say it all again.
He (repeating the formula while she watches him in
the glass). Wind the long end—no, no, not that way—
from above. Not three times, only twice
She (firmly). I won't do any more unless you shut
your eyes.
[He shuts them submissively, and she proceeds with
her dreadful work. Children's screams are heard
from below.
She (giving a final tug to the tie). There, it 's done
I must go to the children. (Dashes off.)
He (opening his eyes and looking into the glass). Good
Heavens ! She 's done it in a bow !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE weakness of the Unionist
Parliamentary Party in the House
of Commons is the subject of a
spirited suggestion in a leading
Review that the Easter Recess should
have been utilised to bring up intel-
lectual reinforcements. “It ought
not to be beyond the resources of our
Whips,” cries the editor, “to find
seats for such men as Mr. HEWINs,
Mr. L. S. AMERY, and Mr. MAC-
kiNDER.’’
We fully endorse the principle
enunciated by our contemporary,
but we demur to the narrowness of
kits application.
The great weakness, not merely
of the Opposition, but of the entire
House of Commons, is its lack of
bright, humorous speakers.
Mr. F. E. SMITH, K.C., un-
doubtedly does his best, but he
clearly suffers from overwork.
To be more specific, what the
House lacks is comedians; and yet,
incredible as it may appear, it is
none the less true that the Mr.
MACKINDER whose claims are urged
by our contemporary is not the
famous Gaiety jeune premier, but the
President of the London School of
Economics |
We do not wish to belittle the
talents of this erudite gentleman,
but we respectfully submit that if
the Conservative Whips do their
duty, they will give priority to the
claims of his more illustrious name-
sake.
Another claimant for Parliamentary
honours whose title to recognition is
paramount is LITTLE TICH, whose
forehead bulges with intellect, and
whose skill as a clog-dancer marks
him out specially as an ideal repre-
sentative for a Lancashire con-
stituency.
Think, again, of the exhilaration
that would be infused into the dreary
debates if Mr. KEBLE HowARD, the
Lady Bountiful. “WELL, ALL I CAN say is, JENKINs, That IF THESE PEOPLE INsist on BUILDING THESE horrid Little villas NEAR MY
GATES, I shall LEAVE THE PLACE.”

modern Chicot (self-styled), were
there to apostrophise Mr. Low THER
as “friend the SPEAKER ‘’l
But the claims of the dramatic'
profession, scandalously neglected
though they are at present, must
not be allowed a monopoly of all
the vacancies that may occur. We
want singers, as well as actors, to
sustain the Government and hearten
the Opposition during the fatigues of
all-night sittings. Mr.
RUMFORD, with his wide knowledge
of Colonial problems, Mr. LEO STOR-
Mont, the Imperialist stentor, Mr.
HAYDEN CoFFIN, the nightingale of
patriotic militarism—these are only
a few of the names that leap to the
lips in this context. We can only
hope that the Conservative Whips |
will be sufficiently intelligent to
realise how enormously they would
strengthen the hold of their Party on
the nation by the return of men of
this stamp.
To say nothing of Mr. CHESTERTON.

RATHER A FARCE.
Pro Tem. (adapted by Mr. Cosmo
HAMILTON from M. ALFRED ATHIS’s
farce Boute-en-Train, and produced
by Mr. CYRIL MAUDE at the Play-
house, “by arrangement with
Mr. CHARLEs FROHMANN,” though
whether that means that he per-
mitted Mr. MAUDE to produce this
particular play, or permitted . Mr.
HAMILTON to translate it, or perhaps
in a general way permitted Mr.
HAMILTON to translate anything he
liked, I cannot say for certain; nor
does it matter, so long as his name
is in the programme somewhere)—
Pro Tem., as I was saying, is funny,
but I think not funny enough.
In a farce, to amuse is everything;
probabilities go for nothing. Seeing
that the plot of every farce turns
upon some misunderstanding, this is
as well; for in real life misunder-
standings do not last through three
Acts. You can have a short misun-
derstanding with a cabman, or a
hotel manager in making up your
bill may mistake you for a million-
aire; that is about all. Hence one
is not exacting in farce. One is not
alarmed for the unities even when,
everything hinges upon the unlikely
circumstance of two people both
being called BRowN. In Pro Tem.
there are no Browns, for Mr. HAMIL-
Ton has rightly kept to the French.
But Dodo Brezard, coming to a
small seaside hotel, is mistaken for
the Prince of Sylvania. The results
are amusing, of course, only not
amusing enough.
Mr. O. B. CLARENCE was delight-
ful as the hotel proprietor's factotum,
Poulette ; so long as he was on the
stage everything was all right. Mr.
MAUDE was always happy and bright,
but he reminded me too much of
Mr. MAUDE in other parts. The
ladies had not much to do, but Miss
HILDA ANTHONY “looked pretty " as
the proprietor's daughter: she does
this as well as anybody I know.
I must congratulate Mr. Cosmo
HAMILTON on his restraint; there was
only one of those smart topical allu-
sions at which he is such an adept.
Poulette remarks that the Sylvanian
Stock Exchange is closed owing to
Free Trade, whereupon a dozen gen-
tlemen, who thought they were in a
music-hall, applauded faintly.
The Mikado was revived on
Tuesday last at the Savoy, with Mr.
RUTLAND BARRINGTON in his original
part of Pooh Bah, Mr. Lytton as
the Mikado, and Mr. WoRKMAN as

DEAR CHARLEs, Don't talk to me
about politics, or the weather, or
anything; I have lost my tobacco-
pouch. Oh, Chas., what is to be
done? It is too sad.
I bought it in a little shop at Am-
bleside, my first, my only friend, on
the left-hand side as you go down
the hill. It was descended from a
brown crocodile in the male line, and
a piece of india-rubber in the female;
at least, I suppose so, but the man
wouldn't say for certain. He called
it a trade term. I smoked my first
pipe from it—on the top of Scafell
Pike, with all England at my feet.
The ups and downs it has seen since
then—the sweet-smelling briars it
has met ! In sickness and in sorrow
it comforted me; in happiness it kept
me calm. Old age came upon it
slowly, beautifully. In these later
years how many men have looked at
it with awe; how many women have
insulted it and—stitched its dear
sides together!
It passed away on a Saturday,
CHARLEs; this scion of the larger
Reptilia, which sprang into being
among the mountain-tops, passed
away in a third-class carriage at
Dulwich l The irony of it ! Even
Denmark Hill But it matters not
now I have lost it. Nor can I bear
that another should take its place.
Perhaps in a year or two. . . . I
cannot say. . . but for the present I
make shift with an envelope.
Two thoughts sustain me. First
that no strange eye will recognise it
as a tobacco-pouch, no strange hand
(therefore) dip into it. Secondly,
that the Fates, which have taken
from me my dearest possession,
must needs have some great happi-
ness in store for me.
CHARLEs, I perceive you are cry-
ing; let us turn to more cheerful
things. Do you play croquet? I
have just joined a croquet club
(don't know why), and one of the
rules is that you have to supply
your own mallet. How do you do
this? Of course I know that ulti-
mately I hand a certain sum of
money to a shopman, and he gives
me a very awkward parcel in ex-
change; but what comes before that?
I have often bought a bat, and
though I have not yet selected one
which could make runs I can gene-
rally find something which is pretty
comfortable to carry back into the
pavilion. But I have never chosen
a mallet. What sort of weight
should it be, and is it a good thing
to say it “doesn't come up very
well " ? I have, they tell me, a ten-
dency to bowness in the legs and
am about a million round the biceps;
I suppose all that is rather impor-
tant? Perhaps they have their mal-
lets classified for different customers,
and you have only to describe your-
self to them. I shall ask for a Ser-
viceable Mallet for a Blond. “Ser-
viceable " means that if you hit the
ground very hard by accident , it
doesn't break; some of these highly-
strung mallets splinter up at once,
you know. As a matter of fact you
can't miss the ball at croquet, can
you? I am thinking of golf. What
about having a splice with mine; is
that done much 2 I don't want to
go on to the ground looking a perfect
ass with no splice, when everybody
else has two or three. Croquet is a
jolly game, because you don't have
to worry about what sort of collar
you'll wear; you just play in your
ordinary things. All the same I
shall have some spikes put in my
boots so as not to slip. I once took
in to dinner the sister of the All
England Croquet Champion—I did
really. Unfortunately I didn't
happen to strike her subject, and she
didn't strike mine — Butterflies.
How bitterly we shall regret that
evening—which was a very jolly one

all the same. Here am I, not know-
ung a bit how to select a mallet, and
there possibly is she, having just
found the egg of the Purple Em-
peror, labelling it in her collection as
that of the Camberwell Beauty. Let
this be a lesson to all of us.
CHARLEs, I feel very silly to-night;
I must be what they call “fey,”
which is why I ask you, How would
you like to be a Pedigree Goat? I
have just seen in an evening paper a
picture of Mr. BRowN “with his
Pedigree Goat.” Somehow it had
never occurred to me that a goat
could have a pedigree; but I see now
that it might be so. I think if I had
to be a goat at all I should like to be
a pedigree one. In a way, I sup-
pose, every goat has a pedigree of
some kind; but you would need to
have a pretty distinguished one to be
spoken of as a Pedigree Goat. Your
father, CIIARLEs, would need to have
had some renown among the bearded
ones; your great-uncle must have
been of the blood. And if this were
so, I should, in your place, insist upon
being photographed as a Pedigree
Goat “with Mr. BROWN.’’ Don't
stand any nonsense about that.
If I ever have a goat, and you
won't let me call it CHARLEs, I shall
call it DAvid. My eldest brother, you
know, was christened DAvid, and
called so for a year; but at the end
of that time we had a boot and knife
boy who was unfortunately named
DAvid too. (I say “we,” but I was
still in the Herebefore myself.) This
led to great confusion. When the
nurse called for DAVID to come and
take his bottle it was very vexing to
find the other DAvid turning up with
a brown shoe in one hand and a fish-
knife in the other. Something had
to be done. The baby was just be-
ginning to take notice; the leather
polisher had just refused to. In the
circumstances the only thing was to
call the baby by his second name.
Two or three years passed rapidly,
and I arrived. Just as this happened
the boot-boy took the last knife, and
went. Now was our chance. My
second name had already been fixed;
it was immediately decided that my
first should be DAvid. The new boot-
boy didn't mind a bit; everybody
else seemed delighted. . . . and
then someone remembered that in
twelve or thirteen years' time I
should be going to a public school.
Yes, CHARLEs, the initials. .
You know what boys are. . .
would have been very awkward.
And so now you see why I am
going to call my pedigree goat DAvid.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PIPARIAN HERESY.
“HEARING there was dissension in anti-carnivorous
circles over the spread of ‘piparianism,’’’ writes a cor-
respondent, “I called upon Dr. PEPIN, the eminent
digestive scientist, in order to ascertain what is precisely
the bone, or rather the pip, of contention. . . .
“‘You ask me,’ said Dr. PEPIN, “whether I think the
Piparian theory has come to stay?, May I venture in
turn to ask whether you are aware of the nature of that
theory?’
“‘Well,” I replied, ‘I understand that piparianism is
the dietetic creed of those who regard nutarianism as a
needlessly gross form of alimentary sustentation, and
believe that by substituting the pip for the nut a more
refined and equally nourishing diet can be provided.'
“‘You are very nearly right. But when you say
“equally nourishing '' you understate the piparian claim,
which is that the pip is, almost without exception, a
more highly condensed form of the vital essence than
the nut. You follow me?’ -
“‘Certainly. But are not the quantity and variety of
pips exceedingly limited as compared with nuts?' -
“‘Ah! There you touch the weakest point of the
piparian system as at present practised. But this ob-
stacle is in a fair way to early removal. Mr. LUTHER
BURBANK, who, as you are probably aware, has intro-
duced the pipless apple into commerce, is expected to
produce an appleless pip of a size commensurate with the
fleshy envelope thus displaced, and it is practically cer-
tain that by judicious crossing a large variety of giant
pips will be attainable. A similar process will no doubt
succeed as well in the case of the Orangcada”, or citronic
group, as in that of the Cideraceae. And, moreover, the
resources of chemistry are quite equal to the piptonisa-
tion of many food substances not naturally piptonic.’
“‘I suppose, then, that at present the pip is usually
employed rather as an adjunct to the nut than as a
complete diet in itself?'
“‘By many people. I myself am not yet a strict
piparian. Indeed, only this morning I ate part of a
brazil-nut at breakfast. Yet I believe it is far better
for the piparian to restrain the occasional desire for the
coarser indulgence of general fruitarian nutrition.’
“‘Thank you. May I now ask if you will give me a
few particulars concerning the ordinary meals of a
piparian 2'
“‘Certainly. Suppose I tell you what I and my
family—whom I never allow to transgress in the direc-
tion of nut-foods—had on our table yesterday. Let me
see. For breakfast we had hot-pip broth, pip-flour
scones spread with pipper, and orange-pipskin tea. For
luncheon—or rather dinner, for it is our principal meal—
we had pipkin-au-feu, a savoury stew of pippose force-
meat, followed by a pipsy cake, and a dessert of roasted
lime-pips, a delicious finish to any meal. Tea, save for
the absence of broth and the presence of a dish of appe-
tising piprock cakes, resembled breakfast. Supper was
a light meal, consisting of lemon-pipwiches, and pear-
pip tartlets, with pipley water to drink. You will gather
º, to use the common parlance, we did ourselves
Well.
“‘ Undoubtedly. But now, and it is almost the last
question I will trouble you with, is it true that a special
disease not infrequently attacks piparians? I have
heard——’
“‘You may take it from me that the cases of the
disease to which you refer are so rare that the liability to
contract it is exceedingly remote. Of course, there is no
-
-
denying that the very name of that complaint points to
its connection with a piparian diet. But, as I have said,
the pip is so uncommon a disease among human beings
—and it is a remarkable fact that even in the lower
orders of creatures only parallelo pipeds are subject to it
—as to be no more a bar to piparianism than is chicken-
pox to the eating of spring-poultry.'
“‘In conclusion, Dr. PEPIN, can you give me any idea
as to the extent to which the piparian diet has been
taken up in this country 2 '
“‘One instance alone will give you a pretty fair notion
of the widespread popularity of the new diet,' replied the
distinguished foodist. ‘You will readily admit that
motorists are just now the most prominent type among
the upper classes. Well, I am not only frequently in-
formed, but I know from personal experience that so
much is the growing piparianism of motorists a matter
of notoriety that even the children in village streets are
accustomed to chaff them as they dash past, calling out
“Pip ! Pip ! ” in every key of childish treble. Ah!
there goes the dinner gong. I am sure Mrs. PEPIN will
be delighted if—— No? You have an appointment.
Well, perhaps another time. I am very glad if I have
been of any use to you.’
“I thanked the famous scientist for his courtesy and
information, and hailing a taxi-pip, went off to lunch at
the club.”

SIHOULD ONE LEND ONE'S
CAR 2
INTERESTING Correspond ENCE.
THE question, Should or should not
a gentleman consent when asked by
a friend to lend him his car, is one
which never fails to excite warm dis-
cussion in motoring circles. Under
the impression that it cannot be too
widely considered we print the fol-
lowing letters:– -
DEAR SIR,--I have long made it a
rule never to lend a first folio of
SHAKSPEARE, and I don't think it has
cost me the friendship of any one
worth considering. I should extend
this principle to a motor-car.
Yours, etc.,
SIDNEY LEE.
DEAR SIR,--It depends on the
friend. There are some friends to
whom it would be a clever thing to
lend a car—provided the car was in
a sufficiently unsatisfactory condi-
tion, and the steering gear liable to
lock. I keep several cars for this
purpose. Yours, etc.,
TIMON.
DEAR SIR,-My answer is No. I
did it once, and am still having to
pay for it.
it was most reckless, and the car was
returned to me with little pieces of
pedestrian all over the wheels. He
is now in prison, and I am in bank-
ruptcy. Yours, etc.,
“NEVER AGAIN.”
DEAR SIR,--I should say No. The
best way, if you do not wish to run
the risk of offending your friend, is
to promise it to him and then
arrange an accident to the car trifling
in character but sufficient to keep it
in dock till the horrible day is over.
The trouble is that if this occurs
often he will begin to suspect your
| bona fides, and that, of course,
among friends, is beastly.
Yours, etc.,
“ONE WHO KNows.”
DEAR SIR,--I never lend my car.
Yours, etc.,
KEin HARDIE.
DEAR SIR,-Never having had a car
I cannot say; but if for car you read
toothbrush I should reply No.
Yours, etc.,
CoNst ANT READER.
DEAR SIR,--I have found it very
profitable to lend a car, if it is lent
to a man at once wealthy, open-
handed, and a fool. I obtain a guar-
antee as to repairs before he starts,
and in this way I have succeeded in
getting several old concerns made as
good as new. I was only had once,
when the friend was so suspicious
and ungenerous as to have the car
overhauled before he started, and
then he said quite plainly that on
second thoughts he would not borrow
it at all.
Yours, etc.,
NATHAN LEw INski.
DEAR SIR,-In my opinion it de-
pends largely upon the size of the
friend. I once lent my car to Mr.
G. K. CHESTERTON and Dr. W. G.
GRACE, and the results were terrible.
But a slim believer in Eugenics may
have it any day.
Yours, etc.,
C. W. SALEEBY.
DEAR SIR,--I know little of motor-
cars, but I once borrowed a pan-
technicon and it led to lots of
trouble.
Yours, etc.,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
April 27.—One of the most difficult ||
tasks from time to time falling to lot ||
of Ministers or ex-Ministers is that ||
of worthily, appropriately, lamenting|
On ||
death of a great statesman.
a memorablé occasion Dizzy, not in
this or other respects habitually
“conscious of his own infirmity,”
borrowed a passage from a funeral
speech delivered by a French orator,
embodying it in his own composition.
In modern times GLADston E was
supreme in the field. His speech on
the death of PEEL, with felicitous
quotation of WALTER Scott's lines on
PITT, beginning, “Now is the stately
column broke,” not only lives in
English history but adorns English
literature. Rosebery is a master of
this branch of an art in whose various
developments he equally shines.
PRINCE ARTHUR holds a worthy place
in the small companionship.
To-night Asquith was
in it.
Scene in House quietly impressive.
Benches filled on both sides. Every
man in decent mourning; all heads
bared when the PRIME MINISTER, in
voice broken with emotion, sounded
the opening notes of his lament. Had
written out his speech. Manuscript
lay before him on the desk; skilfully
avoided appearance of reading. The
verses from WOTTON with which he
finally rounded off his speech were
declaimed without a glance at the
manuscript. When he resumed his
seat a murmur of cheers from both
sides paid tribute to one of the finest
funeral orations spoken from the
familiar place within the memory of
the oldest Member. Listeners felt
how happily its conception and style
were attuned to the simple character
of the man they mourned.
With the exception of moving the
adjournment on the day of C.-B.'s
death, this was Asquith's first
appearance as Premier. It will
have permanent effect on the rela-
tions between himself and the House.
Hitherto Members had been accus-
tomed to regard him as a man of iron
compared with fellow-mortals of flesh
and blood. His intellectual capacity
freely conceded, what was lamented
was apparent absence of the grand
emotion that sometimes flooded
GLAD ston E's speeches, or the mellow
humour that illumined C.-B.'s Par-
liamentary manner. Listening to
him this afternoon, watching his
struggles to master his emotion as he
thought of the friend who was gone,

the House discovered it had made a
mistake. It began to suspect it is
shyness that has been accountable
for Asquith's habitually cold
manner, his studious restraint of
anything approaching emotion.
The error corrected will not herº-
after prevail. The revelation sud-
denly flashed upon the House will
have miraculous influence in smooth-
ing the way of the new Premier.
Business done.—House, meeting
after Easter recess, forthwith ad.
journed in reverent token of memory
of C.-B.
Tuesday.—French Premier, looking
down from Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery, much struck by singular
breadth of mind with which British
legislator approaches consideration of
controversial questions. To-day the
hosts met in battle array round
Ilicensing Bill. On one side measure
is denounced as ruthless attack on
rights of property. On the other it
is upheld as effort designed in best
interests of the public to diminish
drunkenness.
Second reading of Bill first order
of the day. Before it is reached
there is sort of reconnaissance in
force conducted by Members present-
ing petitions for and against the Bill.
Among them is GoRDoN HARVEY,
Member for Rochdale.
“Mr. Speaker,” he said, “I beg
to present a petition from 1,300 in-
habitants of North-East Derbyshire in
favour of the Bill.” Looking again
at the document, he hastily added,
“I mean against the Bill.” -

Nor was he disturbed by fresh dis-

purported to come from North-East

Member finds himself entrusted with
presentation of a petition on burning
question of day. He announces it as
friendly to a certain Bill. Whilst
Ministerialists cheer, glorying in ap-
proval of 1,300 inhabitants of North-
East Derbyshire, he looks again at
petition and finds it is against the
Bill. Is he flustered? Does he drop
on floor and, like BEERBOHM TREE in
Merchant of Venice, rend his gar-
ments or, by preference in the case
of a business man, those of his neigh-
bours ? Pas du tout. Trojan and
Tyrian are one to him. He calmly
announces that so far from petition
being in favour of the Bill, it is hos-
tile to it. Whereupon the crest cf
Opposition rises. They cheer in turn.
“This gives Monsieur from Roch-
dale fresh opportunity of studying
petition. What does he now find?
Why, that the 1,300 inhabitants of
North-East Derbyshire ‘hail ' (or, as
some would say, ‘rain ) from other
places scattered about the island.
Surely this upsets Rochdale? Ah
nous autres do not understand ces
Anglais. Rochdale thinks it well
casually to mention the matter. This
done, he walks up to Table and drops
into pendent sack (hence, le membre
pour Sark, homme très gentil, tells
me, comes the phrase ‘giving it the
sack') a petition which is at once
against Licensing Bill, is in its
favour, and is signed by 1,300 inhabi-
tants of North-East Derbyshire, who
live in Birmingham, London, Sit-
tingbourne, West Hartlepool, Don-
caster, Burton-on-Trent, and other
places.”
Business done. — PREMIER moves

Friday.—REEs (of India), fortunate
at the ballot, gives notice to call
attention to length of speeches
in debate. No new thing this.
Whilst CARNE RAsch was still with
us, he, session after session, pro-
tested against the practice. Once
he found opportunity of moving reso-
lution affirming desirability of limit-
ing duration. In admirable argu-
ment, for whose exposition ten
minutes sufficed, he supported his
plea. Might have carried his motion
but for unforeseen, unfortunate acci-
dent. Hon. friend who seconded it
so carried away by conviction of its
soundness, so angered with habitual
transgressors, that he was on his
legs for full forty minutes. This
rather threw chill over proceedings,
fatally checking CARNE RAsch's
crusade. -
Example better than precedent, or
even abstract resolution. Asquith's
accession to Premiership likely to
have important influence upon prac-
tice in this matter. It was Mr. G.
who, more than forty years ago, set
and saw established practice of pro-
digiously lengthened speeches. Ex-
ample was fatal to that child of
Nature, Dizzy. He was unapproach-
able when, according to earlier habit,
he confined himself to twenty
minutes or at most half an hour
for delivery of speech. With Mr.
G. taking five hours and a-half for
exposition of Budget, never making
interiectory remark in debate of less
than an hour's length, it would not
do for Dizzy to be content with his
modest measure of time. He some-
times held forth by the hour, and was
comparatively ineffective accordingly.
Asquith goes back to the time
limit of Dizzy's prime. Rarely ex-
ceeds half an hour; commonly de-
monstrates to observant audience
how (apparently) easy it is to pack
into twenty minutes masterly conglo-
meration of argument, illustration,
persuasion. Never a superfluous
word in his speeches, and yet every-
thing said.
PRINCE ARTHUR of the same cult.
Something more bounteous in wealth
of words: never uses them for pur-
poses of marking time. With these
two shining examples in high places
there is promise of new style of Par-
liamentary debate when, to quote
from a classic, we shall “cut the
cackle and come to the 'osses.”

HOW TO GET A MOTOR-CAR
FOR NOTHING.
BY UNCLE EPHRAIM.
I
I want to talk to you a little about
my Motor-car. Now I am, speaking
temporally, a poor man : how comes
it, then, that I own a nice clean
motor-car? I will tell you in a little
while.
II.
I dare say all of you wish that you,
too, had Motor-cars; but, being good
Britishers, you swallow your bitter
pills of vexation like sensible men and
WOInen.
III.
have to use such unusual mate-
rials.
X.
Now I dare say you are a little dis-
appointed that it has turned out to be
this kind of Motor-car. But this is a
very good kind, too, as you will see
if you try it.
XI.
You see, once it is made it never
breaks down. It does not fly along,
I admit, but it goes quite nicely, and
you have a pretty good time.
XII.
Now I want you to try and make
one, just to please your Uncle
EPHRAIM.
I know the strife is ended
And Mr. Potts, M.P., -
Has triumphed by a splendid
Majority of three:
But still my pulse beats faster
To think how near we came
Through one absurd disaster
To wallowing in shame.

Now I am going to tell
you something: I got
my Motor-car without pay-
ing for it. No, I did
not steal it, because that
would not have been
British.
IV.
We could all have
Motor-cars if we wished.
Yes, even though you are
a poor man (as I am,
speak in g temporally),
you could have one and
not pay for it, and still
not do anything un-British.
V.
Now how must you set
about getting your Motor-
car? Well, I will tell
you. You must make it
yourself. It is a matter
of home industry.
But, you say, the things
to make it with will cost
money. But I will tell
you this, that no, they
will not cost money. They -
will not cost money, because they
are not that kind of thing.
VII.
Listen to me. What I tell you is
the truth. I made my Motor-car
with my own things, and it took a
long time. But I got it at last.
VIII.
The things that I made my Motor-
car with were not Tyres and Iron and
Petroleum. No, I made it with Tem-
perance, Endeavour, Patriotism, and
Strength, and one or two more.
IX.
You see, we are all our own Motor-
cars, and we must try to make them
as good as possible. That is why we

AN APRIL HONEYMOON.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I was
married in April because
all my friends told me it
was unlucky to be mar-
ºried in May, and I should
like to protest against this
foolish superstition in the
name of hundreds of other
suffering victims besides
myself. Even supposing
it is bad luck to marry in
May, I cannot say that,
in the light of our united
- experience, it is parti-
cularly lucky to be married in April.
Where is the luck in going to your
wedding in a blizzard, and getting
a long wheel mark of mud on your
white satin train 2 Where is the
luck in having one's hair out of curl
all through one's honeymoon, a red
tip to one's nose every time one
goes out, not to mention hiding one's
trousseau frocks under a mackintosh
cloak; and finally where is the luck
of having a husband who pays such
unremitting attention to the cold in
his head that one gets justifiably
jealous of the quinine bottle?
It is said one must learn by experi-
ence; but there is no comfort even in
that when one is denied a chance of
doing differently another time.
Yours forlornly, APRIL BRIDE.

There are a good many paths open to
rebels, and Mr. REGINALD FARRER gives a
pleasing selection of them in The Ways of
Rebellion (ARNoLD). Rebellion depends
a good deal on the point of view. Thus,
when you are born to great estates and
have innumerable titled relatives, you are
a rebel if you throw over the lot and go
in for social reform on new lines. That
is the path which Michael Hallibon took,
and nothing that could be said about him
by Society was bad enough. Another way
to rebel is to decamp with the right man
after having married the wrong one.
Elinor went that way. She married John,
Mrs. Tweedie quotes ERAs MUs, who, in his dis-
course On Behaviour at Meals, insists that “it is
very rude. . . . to wipe your fingers on your neigh-
bour's coat.” There is a good deal to be said for this
injunction. . Not the least interesting chapter in a
fascinating book is devoted to the grim chronicles of
Tyburn. The last man hanged in this now fashionable
quarter passed away on the 7th of November,
1783. Thereafter New-
and went off with Michael, simply be-
cause she felt she must. Michael died, and John,
well satisfied when she told him all about it, took her
back, and loved her all the more for her honesty. Per-
sonally, I think that is rather revolutionary too; though
it doesn't actually count among the author's “ways,”
because he takes a great deal of trouble with his
psychology, and succeeds very cleverly in making John
plausible. Indeed, he makes all the characters plausible,

SAGES OF CHELSEA.
[According to The DailyMail neither DICKENs
nor The Jungle Book are ever asked for in the
children's reading-room of the Chelsea Free
Library. The ages of its habitués vary from
five to sixteen, and during the year many appli-
cations were made for works dealing with
science, sociology, fine arts and religion.]
O AGE of light and learning !
O worthy of all praise,
When Wisdom's torch is burning
With such a brilliant blaze;
When Youth, no more benighted,
Declines to grow excited
O'er rubbish that delighted
Our simple boyhood days.
While yet brief knickerbockers
Left bare my nether limbs,
My favourite fare was shockers
And fairy tales of GRIMM’s ;
Boys' books I had in plenty
To fill my far niente,
VERNE, BALLANTYNE, and HENTY
Amused my youthful whims.
But when on those romances
That our young fancy took
The enlightened babe now glances,
Contemptuous grows his look.
No more the infant vogue is
For fairies, imps, or bogies,
And only old, old fogeys
Will read the Jungle Book.
Where Indians, wildly whirling
Red tomahawks to kill,
Set my young scalp-locks curling
With many a glorious thrill,
The hair of these young sages
Of tender, tender ages,
Curls as they turn the pages
Of NIETSCHE, SPENCER, MILL.
Now, bidding youth defiance,
The big-browed bantlings pore
O'er works of social science
And strange eugenic lore.
Ignoring prams and nurses
The learned babe immerses
His soul in controversies
Abóut the Open Door.
O happy, happy nation,
Where culture so can thrive,
Where one finds Education
So very much alive;
Where, by the grace of heaven,
We 've savants of eleven,

ENGLAND'S WEAK SPOT. *
[Dedicated to my host and hostess of Jerez de la Frontera in grati-
tude for the best luncheon I ever handled.]
ALL roads to England ultimately lead
(Mostly by water, which is often rough),
And there a man may buy his every need,
Including all the best exotic stuff.
This thought has cheered me up in many places
When sick to death of bargaining with foreign races.
Take Spain. You want mantillas, broidered shawls,
Or clattering castanets? Why cross the foam 2
Why hunt for spoil among Alhambra's halls -
When we've our own Alhambra here at home?
Yet there are spots on even England's sun,
And her indifference to sherry-wine is one.
Can she provide that potion, pale and sec,
Dear solace of my exile eve and morn?
Or let that liquid amber lave my neck
Sampled in Jerez where the same was born?
Never of that divine exalting glow
Can they be cognisant who only England know.
Great memories haunt the traveller fresh from Spain—
Córdoba's shrine by Paynim knees impressed;
The minaret towering over Seville's fane;
Nevada in her dazzling ermine dressed—
Precious are these; yet cannot they efface
The memory of a meal for which I still say grace.
Ah! luscious dejeuner and long drawn-out
With ever some fresh tap of mellower age
(Each one a surer antidote to gout);
And then to view the barrels, stage on stage,
Whereof the fumes, enjoyed by inspiration,
Would furnish of themselves a liberal education |
England, you underrate this noble juice I
And let me tell you frankly, heart to heart—
If still, when I have left you no excuse,
You spurn the highest, then we two must part;
I shall elope to Andalucian Jerez
And rent a vine, and sit beneath its sherry-berries.
O. S.
THE CULT OF THE MICROBE.
AFTER Dr. John EYRE's lecture last month to the
Members of the Institute of Hygiene on “Beneficent
Bacteria,’’ it was simply inevitable that there should be
some change in the general attitude. Till then, most of
us had no idea of drawing any distinctions between
them; we included them all in a vague antipathy and
distrust. But Dr. EYRE has compelled us to realise how
cruelly many most respectable micro-organisms have
been misunderstood. So far from infecting us with
disease, it seems that they are actually defending us
from it ! And millions of industrious microbes are also
rendering invaluable services in the manufacture of food-
stuffs and textile fabrics, in the tanning of leather and
the curing of tobaccol. So it is not surprising that, by
way of reaction, we should be tempted to apotheosise
the blameless, Bacillus, or , that the Press (always
responsive to the latest trend of popular opinion) should
combine to boom him for all he is worth. But really
there are limits. . Mr. Punch cannot help thinking that
the thing is being just a little overdone. For it is
becoming impossible to open one's daily paper now
without coming across such paragraphs as these:—
BRIxton's BRAVE BACTERIUM.
“Early yesterday morning, Mr. GEORGE STODGKINSON,
15, Eaton Crescent, Brixton, discovered that his interior
was being violently disturbed by a gang who are believed
to have effected an entrance under cover of a pork-pie of
more than usual indigestibility. Mr. STODGKINSON owes
his life, which was for a time in serious danger, to the
vigilance and courage of a lactic acid bacterium, who
had cleverly concealed himself on the premises in some
curdled milk. After a desperate struggle the intruders
were eventually overcome, and the bacterial benefactor,
with characteristic modesty, withdrew without leaving
either name or address. Mr. Stodgkinson, though still
suffering from the shock, was able to go up to business
as usual.”
MILLIONs of BERMONDSEY MICROBEs IDLE To-DAY.
“To-day all the bacilli engaged in the Bermondsey
tanneries are out on strike, as a protest, we under-
stand, against the excessive length of their working-
day. The campaign is being conducted, so far, with
dignity and quiet. If it is the fact that a microbe is
expected to labour for twenty-four hours a day, this
obviously leaves him but little time either for recreation
or self-improvement, and the strikers may be assured of
sympathy from the Public. Considering that, as Dr.
EYRE has demonstrated, the tanning industry depends
entirely on bacterial co-operation for its successful prose-
cution, the employers will be wise in adopting a more
conciliatory attitude. It seems to us that this is
eminently one of those disputes in which the President
of the Board of Trade should be asked to intervene.”
SoNs of THE SOIL
“A scene of unusual interest, we learn from a corre-
spondent at Fallofield, Blightshire, occurred yesterday
afternoon on the platform of the local railway station,
where one of our most respected residents and agri-
culturists, Mr. Charlock, welcomed the first detachment
of bacterial fertilisers whom he had been anxiously
expecting from London to assist him in the improvement
of his land. The sturdy little fellows, who arrived
punctually by the 3.35, seemed little the worse for their
long journey, and, after being conveyed in one of Farmer
CHARLock's own vehicles to the scene of their operations,
were immediately set to work on the soil. It may be
confidently hoped that the next Harvest Supper at
Couchgrass Farm will, thanks to their presence, be a
far cheerier function than has been the case during all
these years of agricultural depression.”
REMARKABLE REForMATION of A CoMMA BAcillus.
Reuter's Agent cables from Calcutta: “Some sensa-
tion has been caused here by the announcement that a
Comma Bacillus, one of a society notoriously engaged
in the dissemination of Asiatic Cholera, has recently
become one of its most determined opponents. His
conversion is entirely due to the efforts of Professor
SFARUM, and is a striking proof of what culture and suit-
able surroundings may effect in eliminating evil ten-
dencies in the most virulent bacillus. After having gone
through various probationary stages, the Comma is now
the guest of a native gentleman, whom he has undertaken
to protect against any further choleraic attacks.
“On p. 8 will be found portraits of the Converted
Comma, and also of Mr. CHANDRA LoLL PRAGANATH, his
present host.”

peared to answer a charge of alleged cruelty to several
microbes, by confining them in a solution of solidified
gelatine in such a manner as to deprive them of all power
of movement. The defendant, who conducted his own
case, denied that the microbes suffered any appreciable
pain. The Magistrate (severely): “How can you possibly
say that, sir? Who can tell what pain and annoyance may
be experienced by a sensitive microbe when compelled
to remain motionless for hours at a time while it is being
examined under a powerful lens?' (Applause in Court.)
It was monstrous to treat the humblest of our friends
and allies in this cold-blooded fashion, and the defendant
must pay a fine of 40s. and undertake to set the poor
creatures at liberty at once. The defendant, who
seemed surprised at this decision, left the Court amidst
hisses.” - -

“An elderly bacterium, while engaged in assisting to
cure a consignment of cabbage-leaves which had recently
been delivered at Messrs. Nomeny, Corlees and Com-
pany's well-known British Regalia Factory, expired quite
suddenly yesterday afternoon. The deceased, who had
been in the company's service from a mere spore,

Mr. Punch yields to none in admiration of the
Microbes' many excellent qualities, but he does submit
that it is unwise, in their own interests, to invest them
with quite so much importance as all this. Hitherto
one of the most endearing traits in our Bacilli has been
the shrinking self-effacement with which they have
sought to avoid public recognition. Surely we cannot

LONDON LETTERS.
V.
DEAR CHARLEs, I am learning to
dance the Minuet. I say “the '' in-
stead of “a " because I am sure
| mine is a very particular kind of one.
You start off with three slides to the
| left, then three to the right, and then
you stop and waggle the left leg.
After that you bow to your partner in
acknowledgment of the interest she
has taken in it all, and that ends the
first figure. There are lots more, but
one figure at a time is my motto. At
present I slide well, but am a mode-
rate waggler.
Why am I doing this, you ask. My
dear CHARLEs, you never know when
a little thing like a Minuet will turn
out useful. The time may well come
when you will say to yourself, “Ah,
if only I had seized the opportunity
of learning that when I was young,
how. . . . etc.” There were once
two men who were cast ashore on a
desert island. One of them had an
axe, and a bag of nails, and a goat,
and a box of matches, and a barrel of
gunpowder, and a keg of biscuits, and
a tarpaulin, and some fish-hooks.
The other could only dance the
Minuet. Years rolled by ; and one
day a ship put in at that island for
water. As a matter of fact there was
no water there, but they found two
skeletons. Which shows that in cer-
tain circumstances proficiency in the
Minuet is as valuable as an axe, and a
bag of nails, and a goat, and a box of
matches, and all the other things that
I mentioned just now. So I am
learning in case.
My niece, aged twenty months (do
I bore you?) has made her first joke:
let it be put on record and handed
down to those that come after. She
walked into the study, where her
father was reading and her mother
writing. They agreed not to take any
notice of her, in order to see what
would happen. She marched up to
her father, stroked his face, and said,
“Hallo, Daddy! ” No answer. She
gazed round; and then went over to
the writing-desk. “Hallo, Mummy!”
Dead silence. She stood for a
| moment, looking rather puzzled. At
last she went back to her father, bent
down and patted his slippers, and
said, “Hallo, Boots ' ' ' Then she
walked quite happily out of the room.
However, we won't bother about
MARGERY, because I have something
much more exciting to tell you.
McGUBBIN has signed on for the
something Rovers for next season 1
I saw it in the paper; it had a little
paragraph all to itself. This is splen-
did news—I haven't been so happy
about anything for a long time.

for them. I'll back McG., and you
can hold the towel for GAUK. My
man would win at football of course,
and yours at cricket, but the other
three events would be exciting.
Chess, golf, and the Minuet, I think.
I can see McGUBBIN sliding—one,
two, three, one, two, three—there,
now he 's waggling his left leg.
CHARLEs, you 're a goner—hand over
the stakes.
Look here, I smoke too much, at
least I have been lately. Let's give
it up, CHARLEs. I'll give it up alto-
gether for a week if you will. Did
you know that you can allay the
craving for tobacco by the judicious
use of bull's-eyes? (“Allay ” is the
word.) You carry a bag of bull's-eyes
with you—I swear this is true, I saw
it in the Press—and whenever you
feel a desire to smoke you just pop a
bull's-eye in your mouth. In a little
while, they say, your taste for
tobacco—and I imagine for every-
thing else—is quite gone. This ought
to be more widely known, and then
your host would say, “Try one of
these bull's-eyes, won't you? I import
them direct; ’’ and you would reply,
“Thanks very much, but I would
rather have one of my own, if I
may.” “Have a bull's-eye, if you
like,” your partner would say at a
dance. Of course, too, they wouli
have special bull's-eye compartments
on trains; that would be jolly. But
it would ruin the stage. The hero
who always lights a cigarette before
giving off his best epigram—I don't

couldn't. . . . well,
wait such a time.
Why are they called bull's-eyes?
I don't believe I've ever seen a
bull's eye really close. If you look a
bull in the eye he doesn't go for you.
Which eye? He might be a left-
handed bull; you 'd look at the wrong
eye; then where would you be?
The world is too much with me,
CHARLEs, but all the same I've just
ordered a flannel suit which will
make Castle Bumpbrook stare. Sort
of purplish; and it makes up very
smart, and they can do me two pairs
of trousers in it, whatever that
means. I should have thought that
they could have done me as many
pairs as I liked to ask for, but it seems
not. They only print a limited edition.
and then destroy the original plates,
so that nobody else can walk about
looking like me. I asked the man if
he thought it would play croquet
well, and he said, Yes.
By the way, I have learnt some
more about croquet since I wrote
last. First then, you can go round
in one, if you're frightfully good. I
should like to go round in one : I
suppose that would be the record?
Secondly, if you're wired from all
the balls, so that you can't get a
clear shot at every part of any one of
them, you go into baulk, and have
another turn, This must happen
pretty often, because you could never
have a clear shot at the back of a
ball, unless you went right round the
world the other way, and that would
be too risky, besides wasting so much
time. No, I can see there 's a lot to
learn in the game; but patience,
CHARLEs, patience. I shall go round
in one yet. A. A. M.

In art circles a pretty tale is being
told of a Scotch sculptor. He was
showing an acquaintance a bust of a
gentleman who was known to them
both. “Frankly, I don't think it is
much like him,” said the acquaint-
ance. “Ah, weel,” said the sculp.
tor, “ ye maun ken that it 's no gi'en
to every man to be like his bust.”
THE LONG ARM AGAIN.
[“A correspondent of The Glasgow Herald
draws attention to a curious coincidence in
connexion with three of the foremost living por-
trait-painters—Sargent (whose portrait of Mr.
Balfour will probably be one of the features of
this year's Academy), Shannon, and Solomon.
Their names begin with the same letter, but
the full initials of the famous trio are much
more noteworthy:
J. S. S. (Sargent).
J. J. S. §º -
S. J. S. (Solomon
The initials of the first and third are identical,
the order only differing. There are three
famous “B's" in music, but the parallel of the
painters is much more striking.”—Westminster
Gazette.] -
Now this is perfectly amazing; but
there is more to follow. Let us look
at literature. Mr. J. M. BARRIE is a
well-known writer, and he is beyond
criticism and speculation. Who would
believe that the assistant editor of
The Sphere has the same initials?
Yet he has-J. M. B. The literary
gossiper of The Westminster again is
J. A. B.; while is there not a mili-
tant publicist and Member of Parlia-
ment named J. M. Robertson, or
J. M. R. 2—and everyone knows how
like R is to B. All this is wonderful,
and fills one with a sense of impend-
ing doom. . -- .
So much for the miraculous B's.
Look, too, at the A's, all you who
are superstitious. Is there not the
Laureate A. A. 2 That is remark-
able enough—a double first, so to
speak, in initials—but behold there is
ALGERNoN Ashton too. It is almost,
if not quite, too much. Add Mr.
ARTHUR ACLAND, and we have the
deadly and mystical three, so strange
to The Glasgow Herald and West-
minster Gazette. -
Perhaps even more sinister is the
case of the late Mr. GLAdston E and
the present Librarian of the House of
Lords. Both men of letters, both
connected with politics, both of the
same sex, both using the organs
of speech, for communicating their
ideas. Will it be credited that the
Grand Old Man's initials, W. E. G.,
were also those of Mr. Gosse, a little
differently placed—E. W. G. 2–and
is not Mr. Russell, the anecdotist,
G. W. E. (mark you!) Russell, an
acquaintance of both men? It is
marvellous, and uncanny too.
MUSICAL NOTES.
THE phenomenal attractions of the
opera season have now been raised to
high-water pitch by the arrival of
another diva of superhuman accom-
plishments and fascinations — we
refer, of course, to Madame ADELAIDE
PASTALANI, the golden - throated
Bulbul of Calabria. Madame PASTA-
LANI, who was the favourite pupil
of Porpora, LAMPERTI, GARCIA,
SBRIGLIA, and other famous maestri,
was specially destined by WAGNER to
create the principal rôle in the new
opera, which unhappily he did not live
to complete. She is only forty-
seven years old, and her figure is as
8velte as if she were only seventeen.
She has already amassed a fortune
estimated at anything from £500,000
to £2,000,000, and is the happy
possessor of ten motor cars, a turbine
yacht, and a golden Turkish bath.
Madame PASTALANI is a lovely-
appearing woman of the dolicoce-
phalous type, with an opulent profile
and abundant hair of a beautiful
natural terra-cotta tint. Her voice is
a dramatic soprano of , the finest
quality, ranging from the double D in
petto to G in altissimo. Its timbre
is distinctly mezzanine in the lower
register, but approximates to the
piano mobile in the tessitura of the
voce di testa. As one of her ad-
mirers, the Count BELGIojoso, hap-
pily put it, “her voice is as soft as
velvet and as glutinous as a Carlsbad
plum.” It was Signor Titton I, the
famous Italian statesman, who gave
her the sobriquet of the Bulbul of
Calabria, and the most desperate
members of the Mafia and the
Camorra worship her with a fanatical
ecstasy rare even in tropical climes.
Madame PASTALANI received Mr.
Punch's representative in the boudoir
of her new house in Park Lane, and
even to his seasoned optics, satiated
with the magnificence of three gene-
rations, its dazzling splendour came
somewhat as a surprise. Even mem-
bers of the Royal Family have been
denied a peep as the work progressed
to a completion, which in classic
beauty and chaste decoration eclipses
anything ever before attempted in
this or any other century. The
scheme of colour is salmon, emerald
and Botticelli-blue, and there is not
another note of colour in the mould-
ings and cornices. Again, some idea
of the width of the doors may be
gathered from the fact that no fewer
than twelve peeresses can pass
abreast without the slightest risk of
rumpling their gowns or disarranging
their chevelures.
Madame PASTALANI not only sur-
passes all other prime donne in the
magnificence of her mansion but in
the size and number of her pet
animals. In her palmiost days
Madame PATTI never had more than
nine parrots. Madame PASTALANI
has twenty-three, besides four cock-
atoos, three penguins, one albatross,
and a splendid barnacle goose, which
has been taught to sing the Inter-
mezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana. On
her roof garden there are cages con-
taining lions, tigers, tapirs, dingoes,
jerboas, and other choice mandibles,
presented to her in every case. by
Oriental potentates of the greatest
altitude. -
The honours showered upon
Madame PASTALANI might well have
unhinged her mental balance, but in
spite of everything she still retains
considerable vestiges of sanity. Thus
when she was at St. Petersburg the
TSAR used to make tea for her be-l.
tween the Acts, and the late M.
PobedoNosTzEFF used to let her call
him “papa.” President Roosevelt
sent her a canvas-back duck, which
he had shot with his own hands, and
wrote a set of verses in her album,
beginning:
“I guess that Madame A. Pastalani
Knocks spots off the Lily of Killarney.”
Other contributors to her album are
Count Tolstoi, Mr. WILLIAM LE
QUEUx, Mr. HENRY JAMEs, and Mrs. |
ALEc weedić.
It is not, however, only as public
performer that Madame PASTALANI
eclipses her rivals. Phenomenal as
her artistic gifts are they are not
more remarkable than the domestic
virtues and accomplishments which |
lend an added, lustre to the aureole ||
of her divadom. She is pre-eminently
a woman of simple habits, her only
weakness being in the matter of |

“JUST LIKE HIM.”
On the days on which she sings at the
opera she takes a light repast at 4
p.m., abstaining with stoical endur-
ance from any further refreshment
until midnight. Madame PASTALANI
is an omnivorous reader, her favourite
authors being ANNIE Swan and
MARCEL PRévost. In short, whether
we consider her intellectual or her
natural gifts, we can safely say that
we seldom, if ever, expect to look
upon her like again.
E.
The Cambridge Chronicle makes
out to quote Cassell's Saturday
Journal on Mr. CHURCHILL as follows:
“Photographs flatted him with a merry
boyish look. As a matter of fact, he is pale to
the verge of being hagged; he is short-sigoted.
He is by no means gifted in otatory as the
phase is generally understood.”
Later on there is a reference to his
“btain" and his “jeeting ” re-
marks; and no doubt the editor felt
justified in making these improve-
ments upon what cannot have been
in the original a very exciting story.
But after the “RITA” case he should
be careful.
A THEATRICAL REFORM.
JUDGING from an Italian news-
paper the relations between managers
and first-nighters are about to be
placed on a more business-like and
less vocal and emotional footing. We
learn that a new method by which
approval or disapproval of a play can
be shown without disturbing the per-
formance is being introduced by the
dramatist TRAVERSI. Before leaving
the theatre every person is to drop
a ticket into one of three boxes
marked “Good,” “Indifferent,” and
“Bad.” Meanwhile other sugges-
tions for securing a silent but effec-
tive verdict are pouring in upon us.
CLASSICAL STUDENT advocates a re-
turn to the humane and considerate
etiquette of the Coliseum, when,
without making any fuss, a simple
gesture of the thumb indicated that
the spectators had no further desire
to spare their victims' lives.
A RETURNING OFFICER, in view of
the popularity of by-elections, and
the excellent practice to be obtained
in conducting the same with decorum
and self-control; would hold a poll of
the whole attdience between every
Act, to determine whether the play
should continue or not. -
STAGE-FRIGHT asks plaintively for
the Safety Curtain to be lowered
during the whole of the first perform-
ance should any section of the pit or
gallery show signs of restiveness.
FIREMAN says: “What's wrong
with the hose? It could be turned
on from either the stage or the audi-
torium.
AN OLD CLUBMAN maintains that
the only gentlemanly way of express-
ing one's dislike of an actor's per-
sonality is to blackball him.
If any or all of the above proposals
be adopted, we feel sure that the bad
old practice of “booing ” will
speedily become extinct.
=
From Mr. E. F. Besson's latest
novel, Sheaves:
“Tense silence; but after some ten minutes
somebody blew his nose. Pure simple pathos,
the striving of a weak man to do his best, and
finding his best failing, was there.”
He should have tried again.

WE soon got over our disappoint-

Iazăre Station, which we had been
led to suppose was even more beau-
tiful than Cannon Street, and on
driving through the streets of the
French capital (Paris) the girls could
hardly restrain their delight. Every-

and Miss Robinson was quick to
notice the difference between the

here, by the way—doesn't it sound
odd?) Lunch was followed by a
drive to the Bon Marché, and thence
to Les Invalides, and later we en-
trained for Monte Carlo, leaving dear
Paris (which we already felt we knew
and loved) with feelings of regret.
As the train proceeded we discussed
the Parisians and their quaint cus-
toms. “The way the children do
their hair makes me sick,” said Miss
BrowN, “and I object strongly to
their legs.” Miss HARDY thought
this was rather an insular view to
take, but she confessed she was en-
tirely with Miss BRowN re legs; they
were not a bit like honest English
children's legs. Miss GREEN said it
was rather unfair to blame the chil-
dren for this defect; it was only to be
expected, seeing that they had not
had the advantage of English
mothers
Monte Carlo was reached without
further comment; the sky here is a
deep blue; so is the sea; you can
hardly tell which is which. In the
evening we went to the Casino. The
“Daisies’’ were particularly struck
by the beautiful paintings in this
wonderful building, which contrasted
strangely with the haggard faces of
the players. -
“I don't like it,” thus commented
Miss Jones, “ and I'm sure the
County Council wouldn't allow it in

“I only hope Mother won't find

the Chair a flutter of excitement ran
along crowded benches. Glass door
below the Bar flung open. Enter
two men with the dinner dress that
waiters wear at mid-day, carrying
between them three parcels neatly
covered with serviettes. With joined
hands they upbore a central package,
each carrying another with his free
hand. Proved to be the pioneers of
a long procession similarly burdened.

Ecstasy of expectation rudely
shattered by Robert CECIL. An-
nounced that the parcels just de-
posited in front of the Table were
nothing more nor less than the signa-
tures to petition against Licensing

area of Metropolitan Police districts.
Signed by over half a million sturdy
citizens. Comprised 32,175 sheets of
paper, and was nine miles long.
“Will the noble lord bring the
petition to the Table?” said the
SPEAKER, using the formula cus-
tomary to the occasion.
This more than Lord Robert had
counted upon. In resistance of con-
fiscation, robbery, burglary, and the
rest of it, he would do all that might
become a man. When there came
question of bundling into the petition
bag by the Clerk's chair a document

consider his position. It was, if he
might put it so, outside the cab.

known athlete. At University Col.

hurling it 143 yards further than the
best fling of BAYLEs of Balliol. Give
him time and training, he would even
now dump the petition in the bag as
if it were a bale of American hops

The SPEAKER, observing his hesi-
tation, kindly came to the rescue.
“Will the noble lord,” he said,
“bring as much as he can 2''
Gratefully availing himself of this
compromise, Lord Robert, amid en-

signment of telegraph wire. Carried
in by two sturdy messengers, it was
calculated to have appreciable effect
upon course of debate and results of
division.
“It's a mile and a-half long,”
said JoHN WILsoN, proudly.
“Pooh ’’ retorted Bob CECIL, his
spirits risen since the SPEAKER helped
him out of his dilemma with the
nine-miler.
“Lord Robert needn't be so

WHITAKER. “Temperance is a power
in the land; but I confess that, con-
sidered as an allurement to signing a

the Table; he must
with his own hand
place the document
in the bag prepared
for its reception.
“Roll it along,”
cried a sympathetic
Member, as John
Wilson stood for-
lorn by the cylinder.
Not a bad idea,
but there was no
room by the passage
between the Table
and either Front
Bench. It was the
SPEAKER who again
solved the diffi-
culty.
“Will the hon.
Member,” he
blandly said, “bring to the Table as
much of the petition as is possible?”
Severing from the bulk about an
eighth of a mile, John WILSON stag:
gered up to the bag and dropped it
in. After which House regretfully
got to business.
Business done.—Second reading of
Licensing Bill agreed to by majority
of 246 in House of 542 Members.

third attempt the line floats out, and
the tiny Blue Upright settles above
the water just behind that projecting
spur of the opposite bank, where a
good fish or two are perfectly certain
to be lying. We picture the heavy

imaginable. Alas! before the fly can
reach the water there is an ominous
crack at our ear and it is gone. No
matter. In twenty minutes we have

straightened out the gut collars with
india-rubber, dressed the line again
with deer's fat, polished up with

a member of the finny tribe. He is a

one of those “goodly denizens of the
stream ” of which we write so much.
He is in perfect condition, weighing
94 ounces, and a trifle over when
wet, and cannot have been dead
many days before he was claimed by
Nature's cold storage; and we decide
to send him to Sir BRUM with a grace-
ful note of thanks for the day's sport
afforded.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.) .
EveRY now and then, thanks to the mad Mullahs, our
parochial intelligence wakes to the fact that there is a
place called India (where the ink comes from), which
has something to do with this country. Before our pre-
sent lucid interval comes to an end and we return to
our slumbers, I recommend everyone to read The Great
Amulet (BLAckwood), by MAUD DIVER, I have not come
across Mrs. Diver's other book, Captain Desmond, V.C.,
but I am told that it is first-rate, and if the Desmonds
are as pleasant in their own story as they are in this
I can well believe it. In The Great Amulet they are
only an attractive side-show. The centre of the stage
is occupied by a gunner friend of theirs and his difficult
but charming wife. -

say that their reasons for deciding, on their wedding-day,

This book, The Pleasant Land of France.
Crossriggs (SMITH, ELDER) is a clever study of contrast
between selfish natures and one purely unselfish. The
story moves within the limits of a family circle. . There
is the father, Mr. Hope—“Old Hopeful,” as he was
known to his friends—beaming benevolent eyes upon the
world at large, but a little embarrassing in a small
household of limited means. There is Matilda, the eldest
daughter, who marries, goes abroad, loses her hus-
me, from an artistic point of
view, rather thin. Otherwise
I have no fault to find with
the structure or technique of
Mrs. DIVER's book, which
ends only when the happy
couple, who, of course, meet
again in India, have perma-
nently fallen in love for the
third and last time. But The
Great Amulet is much more
than a mere love-story in
three parts. It gives a
wonderfully clear idea of the
difficulties and dangers, the
heroism and self-sacrifice, and
the fine romance of faithful
service to both countries
which are of the essence of
the life of most English men
and women who live in India.
Next time I go down to Til-
bury Docks to wave a parting
handkerchief from that dismal
tender, I shall think of Mrs.
Diver's fascinating book, and -
feel more than ever proud to belong to a country which
produces the quite ordinary-looking passengers who
crowd the sides of the departing liner.
You know the France that men call gay,
The Entente Cordiale France you know;
You've witnessed (from the train) the way
Her far-flung fields and orchards blow.
But would you fan to flame the glow
Born of this scanty passing glance?
Go, then, to Mr. PROTHERo
His book, The Pleasant Land of France.
Haply you ’ve spent a fleeting day
Among the woods of Fontainebleau,
Where revelled FRANÇois PREMIER
And BATTIsTA DI JAcoPo;
Where DIAz, too, MILLET, CoRot

These fragrant names more fragrant grow

|an Australian stranded
band, and after many years
returns home, dumping a
considerable family of young
things upon an impoverished
home. “Old Hopeful" rather
likes this. It is good to have
children around you : only as
he never before earned a
penny to meet current ex-
penses he does not now begin.
It is upon Alexandra, the
younger sister, that the
burden falls. Meanwhile “Old
Hopeful” and Matilda support
the situation with unfaltering
equanimity. A mere domestic
story, you see; but MARY and
JANE FINDLATER, working
together so harmoniously that,
save for admission on the
title-page, dual authorship
would never be guessed, tell
the story very well indeed,
lighting it up with many
flashes of fancy and humour.
One of them—I fancy it is
— MARY ; girls named JANE don't
do that sort of thing—possesses in rich quality the gift of
reproducing landscape with a few broad touches.
Letters from Queer Street (A. & C. BLAck), by
J. H. M. Abbott, purports to be a record of expe.
riences amongst the submerged tenth. The letters
are supposed to be written by one John Mason,
in London, to his friend
“Jimmy '' at the Antipodes. John is having a pretty
bad time of it, and he takes care to let Jimmy know all
about his sufferings and his degradation. Jimmy, how-
ever, who is often invoked as “My James,” does not
appear to have been moved, though he was living in
“God's own country,” which in this case happened to be
Australia. In spite of John's lurid language in regard
to the iniquities of London, he leaves him to his fate,
until on the last page “John Mason was found leaning
over the last unfinished sheet of this letter. He lies in
Waverley Cemetery, Sydney.” We are thus led to
suppose that Jimmy came to Queer Street when all was
over, and to a certain extent made up for his previous
neglect. It is not a very convincing book, and I do not
quite understand why it was written.

No.

15, and being a son of a member pays 15s. for
the Club year, or whether the son of a member
or not is accompanied by a member and pays
a fee of 5s. per day on Saturdays, or 1s per

complied with. The above privileges only
apply to persons under 18.”

this his boy would be 19, and he

Reporter (phrasing his periods for a paper in which the

that all this finished perfection of floral beauty, this
iridescent wealth of gardens that breathe the subtle
atmosphere of faërieland, should have sprung up in a

THE GOOD TIME COMING.
[So far from the best British workmen being dead before they reach
the Old Age Pension standard of 70 years (as alleged by the dissatisfied
Labour Party), we now have it on high authority that much of the
world's noblest work has been produced by septuagenarians.]
Courage, mon bravel That, ARCHIBALD, is French ;
“Buck up, old boy!” would be a free translation.
Once, eager as Achilles in the trench,
(That for the rhyme) with great determination,
And each his special aim,
Did you and I strive manfully for fame.
Once, like Achilles, as I said before,
You vied with me in strenuous toil, but lately
We've lost our (figurative) thirst for gore,
And seem content to look on things sedately,
And even, now and then,
Fancy ourselves just ordinary men.
We thought we might, at five-and-sixty years,
Approach the last and feeblest of our stages;
In fact we grew, depressed by foolish fears,
A little sensitive about our ages;
You winced when you were called ,
With questionable humour “ARCHIE-BALD.”
Courage, mon bravel (you know the meaning now);
The Star of Hope above us plainly twinkles.
I see the laurels on your lofty brow,
Ditto on mine, effacing all our wrinkles.
Yes, ARCHIBALD, I'll bet
A shilling that we do the business yet.
Do you recall how once an Editor
Retained your Sonnet for a week or longer?
Do you recall that match in which my score
Crept up to nine, and I was never stronger?
He sent you back your Sonnet;
I knocked the wicket down, and sat upon it.
But what's our failure here? (as BRowNING said);
For now no pang of disappointment lingers;
Although our hopes were pretty nearly dead,
We'll spread our manly chests and snap our fingers.
If the above be truthful,
We've only failed through being far too youthfull
When we are seventy 1 I shall smite with glee
Till I've made ten—my lifelong hope, as hinted;
And after years of waiting you will see
Your Sonnet to the Shades of Evening printed.
Be patient for a time,
We shall do wonders—when we reach our prime.

Sometimes in a glassy tomb.

In my heart a sanguine glow:

Where the tame sea-horses canter,
Keeps a docile mammoth too?

DEAR CHARLEs, Are you coming
up to town this month 2 If you do
we will make a journey into Shep-
herd's Bush together, and see the
Exhibition.
I am afraid I have been doing
Shepherd's Bush an injustice all
these years. John and I once
arranged a system of seven Hells, in
which we put all the men we hated.
Nobody known personally to either of
us was eligible (which may have
saved you, dear CHARLEs), so that
they had to be filled with people in
the public eye. The Seventh Hell
contained two only. One a Socialist,
who is thought a good deal of by
himself, I mean; the other a Novelist
who is always writing about
Duchesses’ children. The punish-
ment for this class was simple; per-
petual life in an open boat on a
choppy sea, smoking Virginian
cigarettes. John's idea chiefly, he
being a bad sailor. The doom de-
creed for the unfortunates in the
Fifth Class—now I am coming to the
point of this reminiscence—was more
subtle; they had to live at Shep-
herd's Bush, and go to The Chinese
Honeymoon every afternoon.
There were four men in the Fifth
Class. Three of them we need not
bother about, but the latest arrival
was a certain headmaster who adver-
tised a good deal. One day we met
somebody who knew him well. We
broke the sad news to him gently,
and he was much distressed about it.
He asked if there was any hope. We
- -
ever get too stout—not unpleasantly
so, I mean; you hardly ever see an
obese post-card. I don't believe I
have used one of any dimensions for
ten years; yet they are such handy
things when you want to say “Right
O,” or don't quite know whether you
are “very truly ’’ or “sincerely.”
The post-card touch is hereditary.
Some families have it, ours hasn't.
But now it is going to begin. To-
morrow I buy as many stout ones for
sixpence as they will give me.
Talking of buying croquet mallets
and sich—I went into a tobacconist's
a little while ago (What for? Guess),
and while I was there a man came in
and ordered a pipe, two ounces of
bird's-eye, and a box of matches. I
wanted to tell him that you really re-
quired a rubber pouch as well, and a
little silver thing for pressing down
the tobacco. It must want some
nerve to start straight off like that,
especially at his age—forty or so. I
am about to play golf seriously, and
I shall certainly get my clubs at dif-
ferent shops; a driver at the Stores,
a putter in Piccadilly, a niblick
(What's a niblick? Anyhow, I shall
have several of them, because of the
name)—and several niblicks in Fleet
Street. It would be too absurd to
buy a dozen assorted clubs, one ball,
a jersey, and the little red flag all at
the same place.

on the part of the learned gentleman
we sent his friend a telegram : “Ed-
wARD left Shepherd's Bush by the
nine o'clock steamer this morning.”
And now it looks as though the
Bush were much more of a place
than we thought.
Every week or so I have an in-
spiration; and I had one yesterday,
when the thought struck me sud-
denly that it would be a good idea to
buy some post-cards. You get them
at the post-office—six stout ones for
ninepence. Oh no, that can't be
right—nine stout ones for sixpence.
I shouldn't think a post-card would
3 not out, and that will bring me top
of the averages. (If you divide 3
by 0 you get an awful lot, you know.)
You have an average bat, I suppose?
I like them rather light—or I would
take the money; whichever would be
more convenient.
I have just written myself a letter,
pleasantly stand - offish, but not
haughty. The reason is that I have
my doubts about the post-office, so I
am giving them a test. My address,
as you have discovered, is an awk-
ward one. There are nine distinct
ways of getting it wrong, and most
people try two or three of them. But
the letters do get here eventually,

after (I expect) a good deal of sick-
ness on the part of the postman.
What I am beginning to wonder now
is whether a letter with the right
address would arrive; I fancy that
the chief of the detective depart-
ment would suspect a trap, and send
it somewhere else. And as I am cer-
tain that I have never received one or
two letters which I ought to have
had, I am writing to myself to see.
It is a great art, that of writing
nicely to yourself; to say enough,
yet not too much. When JoHN
was getting engaged he wrote to him:
self every day. Before he started
doing this he used to spend hours
sitting and wondering whether the
postman had been. The few letters
he had had from her came by the
8.30 post. At 8.15 he began to look
out; nothing happened. An awful
quarter of an hour followed. 8.30–
no postman's knock; never mind,
perhaps he 's late. 8.35—well, it
is rather a busy time; besides,
he may have fallen down. 8.40–
one ray of light left; he did come
once, you remember, at 8.42. 8.45–
despair. A half-an-hour's agony, you
see, CHARLEs. Then he thought of
writing to himself in time for that
delivery. The result was that he
remained quite calm, knowing that
the postman was bound to come.
“Ah, there he is. Will there be a
letter from her? Yes—no.” You
see? Your heart in your mouth for
five seconds only.
I never saw any of these letters.
But, knowing John, I should say
that at the beginning they were sym-
pathetic—“Buck up, it's all right '':
or hopeful—“Never mind, she 'li
write to-morrow.” Later on they
would tend to become cynical :
“Done in the eye again. What on
earth do you expect?” And finally,
I expect, insulting: “You silly ass;
chuck it.” . . . . Then, of course,
she wrote.
Good-bye. Don't forget I am going
to play for you. Would it be side to
wear flannels? White boots would
be a bit lofty, anyhow. I shall wear
one brown pad on the right leg.

“WEARY WILLIE.”—Your case is
a very good one. You will be seventy
next December. Your income, de-
rived from your professional occupa-
tion as a tramp, averages 98. 11d. per
week. It is 43 years since you last

for a felony. You are not a lunatic,
but in full possession of your senses,
having never suffered from anything
approaching brain-fag. Indeed, apart
from an occasional burglary, you
have never done a stroke of work in
your life. You are, therefore, the

sion, and you have an indubitable
claim upon the income-tax derived
from the working community.

THE SCIENTIFIC PARENTS.
[Visitors to the Exhibition in Southampton Row, which was organised
by the Sociological Society to teach parents how to select their
children's toys, have been introduced to the toy as “a profound
educational agency.” They have learnt, e.g., by means of graphic
curves on scientific charts of pleasure, all about “biting and
tasting plays,” of “social,” “individual,” and “intelligent play,” of
“competitive” and “co-operative group games,”, and some have gone
away congratulating themselves that they were born in the days when
their own parents were not also Sociologists.]
JonATHAN PRATT at six weeks old
Was as healthy a babe as you could behold;
Pink and creasy and soft and fat—
A wonderful baby was JonATHAN PRATT.
JonATHAN's joy no limits knew
When they brought him a coral to chump and chew:
He grinned and gurgled in huge delight,
And chawed at the coral with all his might.
But suddenly JonATHAN grew aware
Of four keen eyes with a serious stare–
Four great eyes, round, grave, intent,
On poor little JonATHAN always bent.
Scared and timid the babe became;
He would not play at the biting game,
But dropped his jaw and his coral too,
And uttered a long and a loud “Boo-hoo! ”
Months rolled by till the babe could crawl,
And bread and milk began to pall,
When one fine day they gave him to eat
Something sticky and red and sweet.
Laughed his dimples and danced his soul,
As he smeared his face with divine jam-roll—
Till, all of a sudden, he found those eyes
Watching him still in their solemn wise.
Scared and timid the babe became ;
He would not play at the tasting game,
But dropped his jaw and his jam-roll too,
And uttered a long and a loud “Boo-hoo! ”
*
Master JonATHAN, a tat four,
Met with some nice little friends next-door,
And oh, with what glorious fun were made
Castles of sand with a bucket and spade
Shouts of joy were heard to rise,
Till they all grew aware of those four great eyes
Fixed on them, solemnly taking note
How they made battlement, bridge and moat.
Hushed were the shouts, and the joy was killed,
For how can youngsters contrive to build
If you treat them as specimens that portray
The earlier ages of social play?
Master JonATHAN, attat seven,
Went to school, and he thought it heaven,
For here was cricket, and JonATHAN PRATT
Learnt to play with ball and bat.
Ah! why must father and mother itch
To study their boy on the cricket pitch?
Why must they want to observe their son
As he made for the school his very first run ?
Cricket is rare, but it 's not the same
If it's called a competitive ball-group-game,
And if your parents are watching you
From the sociological point of view.
Poor little JonATHAN PRATT grew pale;
The first ball carried away a bail.
He fled from the wicket in tearful flight,
And his taste for cricket was killed outright.
Weep, if you will, for the martyred brat—
But what of Mr. and Mrs. PRATT 2
Fain would they study with chart and plan
The stages of play in the embryo man;
But though there's a will there is not a way
For JonATHAN mopes and he will not play;
He 's thin and haggard, a mass of nerve,
Who simply declines to be placed on a curve.
THE SPOKEN WORD.
[It has been decided that, in future, the speeches of all Members
| delivered in the House of Commons shall be reported in full and
without correction in the Official Report. We venture to give an
example of the result of the new method. We have, of course, sup-
pressed the speakers' names.]
First Hon. Member (perorating). We do not say,
Mr. SPEAKER—at least Honourable and Right Hon.
ourable gentlemen opposite will do me the credit
which I think I have fairly deserved, and nobody
is , more entitled to say that, for, I believe, it is
acknowledged on both sides of the House—but what I
do say, and I say it with a very firm and rooted convic.
tion, a conviction I have entertained for many years, as
a result of the investigation I have conducted on this
subject for a long time past; and I should like the House
to take note of what has been written on this subject
by men so distinguished as Professor JAckson and Sir
WILLIAM BootLEs, whose authority in this matter
nobody can venture to contest. If the House, Mr.
SPEAKER, has carefully followed the argument which I
have laid before it they will perceive, Mr. SPEAKER—
and this, after all, is the main point, though I am far
from denying that there are many other points of equal
and possibly superior importance. But that, after all, is
not the question with which we are at this moment deal.
ing, though on another occasion I shall be quite ready to
state my opinion on it without any reserve, and it is for
that reason that I now confidently support the motion
before the House. (Loud cheers.)
Second Hon. Member. In rising, Mr. SPEAKER—ahem
—um–er—to address a few remarks, Mr. SPEAKER—er
—um—ahem—I should like, Mr. SPEAKER—um—or
rather if I may say so, Mr. SPEAKER, I desire to preface
the few remarks which—um—ah—if the House will
grant me its indulgence for a few moments. (Cheers.)
Encouraging voice from the Irish benches. Go on,
CICERO !
Second Hon. Member (continuing). I am well aware,
Mr. SPEAKER, that such remarks as–erra—um—ah–
which I am addressing—ah—um—are not palatable to
all sections— -
Voice from the Labour benches. Don't you mind our
feelings, Sonny. We can bear it.
Second Hon. Member (resuming the thread of his dis-
course). The figures show, Mr. SPEAKER, that the Right
Honourable gentleman has not only—er—um—ah—con-
nived at outrages, but has actually been ignorant of their
occurrence, which for a Right Honourable gentleman,
erra—um—ah—in the Right Honourable gentleman's
position—um—ah—is a most reprehensible position, I
had almost said a thoroughly unsatisfactory position.
Encouraging voice from the Irish benches. That's
right; you say what you mean.
Second Hon. Member (concluding). And much as I
wish to speak with all courtesy—erra—ah—the Right
Honourable gentleman, Mr. SPEAKER, has not acted in
accordance with the high traditions—um—ah—of the
office—um—erra—ahem—which the country has a right
to expect.

ELECTIONEERING ladies
My sympathy repel,
For politics a trade is
Sordid and fierce and fell.
And yet the application
Of wholesale condemnation
I bar, in admiration
Of her who bore the bell.
Some names there are that linger
Like jewels rich and rare
On Time's outstretched forefinger,
And hers will sparkle there.
For mightier than Box.EY,
Or stout ColocotRoNI,

The pride of County Clare.
Some play the pianola,
Some on the harp excel,

Some use the mezza gola
According to MAUREL;
And others tingle-tangle
The frivolous triangle;
But she preferred to jangle
The simple muffin-bell.
Mid markets marmaladen
Or blocked with bales of jute,
This unrelenting maiden
(Like Orpheus with his lute)
With frequent raid and foray
Still hounded down her quarry,
And never, sick or sorry,
Abandoned the pursuit.
Though, on the far Equator,
By lions undismayed,
The fiscal gladiator
Grew mightily afraid
Of Mad'moiselle MALONY,
And summoned, per MARcoRI,
Full many a trusty crony
To come and lend his aid.
Tommy. “Don’t wast to.”
When crowds ran helter-skelter,
When missiles flew around,
She never sought for shelter,
But grimly stood her ground;
And dauntlessly debating,
Orating, imprecating,
And tintinnabulating,
All opposition drowned.
Then slainte / Miss MALONY,
To you I raise my cup,
You made old Caledony
Effectively sit up.
You popped up like a puffin,
And, spite of all his bluffin',
You nearly knocked the stuffin'
Out of the “Blenheim pup.”

The question whether you should

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from THE DIARY or Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May
11.-With present Government still
in power, Captain CRAIG is prepared
for anything. Have already suffered
cold wet spring of unprecedented
severity. Only this morning Sir
FREDERick BANBURY, turning over his
blue books, came upon one testifying
to the fact that in the year 1907,
being the second of existence of
Liberal Government, the birth rate
was the lowest on record. It is a
self-evident mathematical proposition
that if this process goes on unchecked
at by-elections the Englishman will
in due time be as extinct as the
dodo.
To depression of feeling consequent
on these reflections came sudden dis-
covery that the House of Commons
was in the hands of the soldiery.
What would be misleading affectation
to speak of as “a thin red line"
gleamed in Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery. There 's nothing thin about
the Cameron Highlanders, at least
not about the specimens on view to-
day. A brawnier set of men never
wore kilts. Captain CRAIG's keen
eye, trained in the service of the
North of Ireland Imperial Yeomanry,
noted that whilst this detachment of
the Camerons was almost within
sword stroke of the Bar of the House
the rear was protected by another file
occupying a Bench of the Strangers'
Gallery. He further detected a light-
ing } of the martial eye of NAPoleoN
B. HALDANE seated in mufti on the
Treasury Bench. When it fell on the
band of warriors in the gallery it
flashed the light of battle. Almost
imperceptibly, certainly unconsci-
ously, N. B. H. squared his massive
shoulders what time his right hand
instinctively moved towards his left
thigh in search of the accustomed
sword hilt.
Had been announced that WINSTON
proposed at the sitting to take his
seat for Dundee. Word went round
that the warriors in the gallery were
a body-guard that had accompanied
the successful candidate on his
journey southward. Was said that
as President of Board of Trade ad-
vanced to take the oath they, on pre-
concerted signal, would spring to their
feet, draw their claymores, and shout
their battle cry. That, of course,
would be distinctly out of order. But
there are occasions when might is
right, and what would the Serjeant-
at-Arms be amongst so many?
Suggestions and apprehensions
turned out to be groundless. The
martial array in the gallery was
merely a muster of the Cameron
Highlanders, who, having attended
the KING's Levee, looked in at the
House. They sat unmoved when,
amid ringing cheer from the Minis-
terialists, WINston walked up to the
Table escorted by the . PRIME
MINISTER and the Master of ELIBANK.
Unmoved they remained when, the
new Member being formally intro-

duced to the SPEAKER (who seemed to
have somewhere seen him before), the
jubilant cheer rang forth again, and
WINSTON with characteristic modesty
withdrew behind the SPEAKER's Chair
to escape further notice. Questions
over they rose as one man, made
sharp turn to the right, and marched
forth, leaving behind no trail of
blood or booty.

rattling majority of 313. Promise of

day.—Looking in

rienced eye re-
cognised that one
of two interests
must be at stake.
The Opposition

with Peers. Min-
isterial ranks,
though, as divi-
sion when taken
testified, the y
presented no ap-
preciable increase
owing to recent
a u g men tation,
were by comparison with ordinary
occasions well filled.
What was up? Church or Land”
Glance at Orders showed that busi-
ness was proposal to go into Com-
mittee on Land Values (Scotland)
Bill. Then it was Land. Figure
long familiar in House of Commons
stood at Table uttering solemn words
of warning. Odd, when we come to
think of it, that a statesman known
to the Commons as St. Michael AND
ALL ANGELs should, when he went
to the Lords, retain in another form
the saintly appellation. He is now
Viscount ST. ALDw YN. This better,
inasmuch as whilst it preserves old
associations it is briefer.
For a while it seemed the majority
would get rid of the measure at this
midway stage. But there are more
ways of killing a cat than serving it
up as rabbit pie. The night young;
nothing to do till dinner dressing-bell
rang; much better allow Bill to go
into Committee, and then let these
depredators, these confiscators of pri-
vate property, breaking out in fresh
place, be taught a lesson.
This course adopted. In Com-
mittee, with majority of 119 to 32,
adoption of Act by local authorities
made optional.

Hearty cheer greeted the bearer of a

opportunity of sharing in the loaves
and fishes seemed yet far off. He
had gone to another place before his
big boy established the position
of most popular of First Commis-
sioner of Works, speedily leading to
Cabinet rank. To-day there are once

No sooner had
the door swung
to behind me
than I guessed I had made a mis-
take. But since at the last moment
to change one's mind about a restau-
rant is fatal, I took a seat.
“Bring me,” I said to the waiter,
“a loin chop and a grilled tomato.”
He looked at me with pity. “Ex-
cuse me, sir,” he said, “but this is
not that kind of restaurant.”
“Well, what can I have then?” I
asked. “What is it? Is it vege-
tarian or is it corrupt” I mean have

said. “Our food wouldn't satisfy
you at all. It 's mind food, worked
up into little messes. I know the
look of the place is misleading, sir,”

THE adaptation of Le Voleur had

Thunderbolt is a very conscientious
piece of work, but, apart from the
rather commonplace business of the
theft and destruction of the will
(already accomplished before we
arrive), it is really not so much
a play as a collection of cha-
racter sketches on the lines of
a novel in dialogue. Drama, after
all, concerns itself with action—pre-

course I have to look as if I were a bit sur-
prised and pained.”
ferably the kind of action that goes
on in character under the influence of
circumstances and environment. It
is not enough to pourtray character,
though this is obviously necessary at
the start, that we may know what we
have to work upon; the real business
of the dramatist is with its develop-
ment. Now, if we may, perhaps, ex-
cept the assumption of her guilt
by the erring lady's husband, and
the evolution towards a suspicion of
generosity that takes place in the
tough heart of the eldest brother,
there is in this play no sort of de-
velopment of character. Every-
body's internal system remains sta-
tionary. After the first half-hour,

of personalities well enough differ-
Miss Mabel Hackney (Phyllis Mortimore). “I
entiated, one finds that the senti-
ments and almost the very words of
each character under changing con-
ditions are just what one might have
guessed they would be; and the chief
interest that remains for us is to
observe very respectfully the meticu-
lous care with which the author main-
tains the consistency of his fixtures.
I venture also to think that Mr.
PINERO was ill-advised in the choice
of a title which, as far as the audi-
ence was concerned, could only re-
present the sensation of a few inno-
cents on the first night. From that
date onwards there could be no pos-
sible question of a thunderbolt.
Nothing so much marks the glorious
upward movement of British drama
as the change in the fashion of its
curtains. o end an Act on a
dramatic exit would in these days
be a sign of hopeless, banality.
Thus Mr. PINERo prolongs the
first Act to allow a butler to enter
the solitary room and extinguish a
couple of lamps. This may, of
course, have been a subtle touch
suggestive of bourgeois economy,
but it was not precisely of the
nature of a culmination. At the end
of the terrible strain of the third Act,
when Mr. ALEXANDER's exit threat-
ened to bring down the house, the
tottering fabric was sustained for
some moments to allow scope for
several rather cheap pleasantries
which might well have been left to
the imagination of an audience by
this time thoroughly instructed in the
manners of the Mortimore family.
And in the last Act I thought the
curtain would never come down at
all, so many little anticlimaxes
clamoured, one after another, for a
hearing.
I have seen and heard Mr. ALEX-
ANDER's performance praised as a
superlative feat. Perhaps I sat too
far forward for the right perspective;
|but I confess that his acting in the
more tragic scenes confirmed my con-
viction that his true forte lies in light
comedy. Miss MABEL HACKNEY
began on so funereal a note that she
scarcely left herself anything in re-
serve for her thunderbolt. She
failed, too, and that was partly the
author's fault, to win the sympathy
that we were all anxious to lend her.
There was not enough of human ap-
peal in the vague motives that
actuated her offence. Mr. Louis CAL-
vent as James Mortimore, and Mr.
BEveRIDGE as Elkin, the lawyer, were
really admirable; and to Mr. DRAY-
cott's Colonel Ponting I have
pleasure in awarding a D.S.O. for his
gallant efforts to relieve a very
closely beleaguered house. Miss

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp (A. C. FIFIELD),
by W. H. DAvies, is a very remarkable book. I
own I have no particular liking for the title. It
is precious and affected, and harmonises badly with
the style and matter of the volume itself. As a
matter of fact Mr. DAVIEs was never a super-tramp.
He was a tramp with literary aspirations, and always at
the end of every “beat" he had a vision of himself sitting
at ease under his own vine and fig-tree, and composing
great poetry to please himself. However, I suppose the
“super" is intended as a gratification for Mr. BERNARD
SHAw, who has written a preface to the book in his
“well-known manner ''—the words are his own. I have
never in all my life come across so calm and at the same
time so candid a narrator as Mr. DAVIEs. With the
utmost unconcern, though in admirably well-chosen lan-
guage, he lays before his readers the story of his tur-
bulent childhood, his youth, and his manhood. He
organised a gang of boy bandits, stole confectionery and
groceries, and having been captured was sentenced to
find nothing but pity for the Corsican adventurer. In
The God of Clay (HUTCHINson) we are introduced to ever
so many people: aristocrats, sansculottes, Jewish finan-
ciers, English spies, an Irish monk with a donkey, and
a Levantine buccaneer with a beautiful daughter; and
one and all despise this thinker in Continents who has
no time for the real business of life, which is obviously
love. Where would the novelist be if it were not so?
Ranging himself therefore on the side of the ANTONIES
MARK and HoPE), Mr. BAILEY has written a series of
ramatic and romantic episodes which are very
delightful to read, and not importunately true to
historical fact. I became a little tired of descriptions
of the hero's features (I must have seen a picture of
them somewhere), but Mr. BAILEY's style is most
refreshing, and several of the subordinate figures in the
book, notably Barsac and Mr. Waring the midshipman,
are quite irresistible. Insular pride is also abundantly
satisfied by the complete humiliation of BonAPARTE
before Jerry Wild, and the triumph of sentiment over
sordid ambition. Rule Britannial
If I were in love and the object of my affections would
not or could not reciprocate them because she lacked
twelve strokes with a birch
rod, which he duly received.
Later he turned tramp, not
because he was unable to
work, but because he did not
want to work. He travelled
over the greater part of the
United States and England
by road or by rail, associated
with the queerest companions,
and endured intolerable hard-
ships. Finally, a railway
train severed his foot from
his leg, and brought his career
as a tramp to an end. He is
now the author of two volumes
of poetry, and of the present
book, in which he tells the
story of his wanderings. Mr.

should not ask anyone else,

friend, to endeavour to “open

as if it were a sardine-tin), and
expect him, if he succeeded,
to retire in my favour. I
have a feeling that the scheme,
though ingenious, would not
work. It would inevitably be

DAVIEs has a keen eye for character. He indulges in no
high-flown language or maudlin introspection. . . Ruth-
lessly, but with perfect lucidity, he describes himself,
his companions, and his adventures from the outside.
It is a deeply interesting record, marred only by a few
split infinitives.

No writers, whether of history, poetry, or romance,
can feel, I imagine, that they have treated themselves
º until they have had a fling at NAPoleon. Some
of them admire, and some condemn; but Mr. H. C.
BAILEY is one up on most of his predecessors, for he can
while I proceeded with shame
to take a back seat. This is just what happens in The
New Galatea, and Mr. SAMUEL GoRDON, the author,
apparently recognising that his original lover is a little
wanting, is careful to explain that his father had died in
a lunatic asylum. However, after Galatea marries the
friend the story gains in strength what it loses in
originality. At first she is a wife in little more than
name. Her unopened heart is still a block of virgin
marble. But you know that this cannot last. In due
time she will fall in love with her husband when it
is almost, but not quite, too late, and will pass through
as many bad quarters of an hour as she has given him
before they reach true connubial bliss and the end of
the book. Messrs. GREENING, the publishers, are of
opinion that Mr. GoRDON “handles a theme which in its'
boldness is reminiscent of the most advanced Continental
writers with a delicacy which cannot offend even the
most Puritanical taste.” Certainly I found nothing
here to raise a blush on my own cheek, but then, per-
haps, my innocence has suffered more than that of
Messrs. GREENING from excursions into foreign literature.

ticulars of Mr. BRowN's caravan. A friend showed me
your advertisement. Please send full details. And
what about the horse? It really seems an ideal holiday.
She would like to have a reply from Mr. BrowN by re-
turn of post. And is it watertight? I want you to send
lowest terms.

LETTER No. II.
DEAR SIR,--I feel I really must write to thank you for
introducing me to caravanning. Your letter was most
interesting, and I am sure that it is an ideal holiday, and
such a nice way of seeing the country. My husband
and I feel that we simply must go caravanning this
summer. We are not quite sure about the date, but
would you please reserve the caravan for us from August
15 to 19, unless one of them is a Sunday 2 My husband
has such strong views; and we think Lowestoft would be
a nice place to start from. My brother (did I mention
that he would be of the party?) is so fond of that part of
Westmorland. Will you please have it sent there by
rail? My little boy WiLFRED will be four months old
next Michaelmas. Do you think he will be old enough
to go? There are so many things that I want to ask
you. Of course my husband will cook the breakfast.
He was in the Volunteers, and is quite athletic. He used
to play lacrosse for Upper Tooting. The post is just
going, so I must stop. Do write me definitely. We are
quite excited to think that we will soon be on the Open
Road.
I am, yours in haste,
EFFIE McGUPPIE.
LETTER No. III.
DEAR MR. BRow N, Thank you so much for the plan
of the caravan. It looks perfectly fascinating, and I
think it will be a splendid way to see the country. I
am going to get a short skirt with a leather binding, and
my Aunt (did I mention that she is going to join us?
She hopes to come if she can get away; but she has a
very important position in an office, and is never certain
if º can be spared. I am sure that it would do her so
much good, and she thinks it will be an ideal holiday),
says I should have a strong walking-stick.
Now, my dear Mr. 13Row N, would it trouble you too
much to make some small structural alterations in the
caravan 2 (We think “Boa-constrictor’’ is such a
pretty name—so unusual.) For one thing we would like
the beds in the kitchen. Unfortunately I suffer at
nights from cold feet, and the doctor tells me a little
drop of something hot about 1.15 a.m. is absolutely in-
dispensable; and it would be so much more convenient
to be near the stove. Then is the roof removable : My
bro'her-in-law (did I say that he will be one of us?)
has been advised by his medical man to try the fresh-air
cure for his laryngitis. I know I had some more ques-
tions to ask, but I must wait till my husband comes
home, so I shall post this to-day, and you can let us
know definitely by Sunday.
-- I am, sincerely yours,
EFFIE McGUPPIE.
LETTER No. IV.
DEAR Mr. BRow N,+We are so disappointed and sur-
prised that it would cost £8 to send the caravan to
Lewestoft, and as you say the rent will only amount to
£2 12s. 6d. we can perfectly understand that you do not
wish to pay all that. It would be most unreasonable of
us to expect it... Would it not be fair to both of us if you
were to pay half of it?
Please let me know definitely by return of post. We
are so much excited at the prospect of becoming real
gipsies.
I am, yours very sincerely,
EFFIE McGUPPIE,
P.S.--What do you, mean exactly by the expression
“brake "? These technical terms are so puzzling.
LETTER No. V.
MY DEAR MR. BRow N, I feel that I must not take
up too much of your time, but I should be so grateful if
you would answer one or two little questions before we
come to a definite decision. -
(1) Would there be room to take a mangle? Of
course we shall do all our own washing. I think that is
the charm of it—don't you?
(2) Do you think the under-gardener (we shall havo
to take him) would be able to drive the horse?
(3) Will you kindly put in a hassock for my aunt 2
(4) Is it best to take the horse out of the shafts, if we
decide to stay several nights in one place?
Please send me full details.
I am, yours very sincerely,

MY DEAR MR. B.Row N, Many thanks for your letter.
There seem to be a dreadful lot of difficulties in the way.
I am afraid we shall have to give up the Lowestoft idea
after all, but we cannot possibly start from Chester, as
my cousin (did I say that my husband had asked him to

is very unreasonable of you not to make the small altera-
tions I suggested; and I don't at all agree with you
about the sleeping accommodation. I am sure we shall

And with the utmost calm began to mine
The dark, unplumb'd recesses of a purse !
The senseless porter slams the infernal gate,
And far away the laden train has roll’d.

SHEPHERD’S BUSH.
FAscINATING OLD-WoRLD LoRE.
Nothing being of such interest to
the public as the presentation of un-
important subsidiary facts concerning
an important event or personage, we
have been at considerable pains to
collect information around Shep-
herd's Bush, the locale (as our gay
visitors would say) of the great Ex-
hibition, which some papers would
have us call the Ententeries, a thing
which it is earnestly to be hoped no
one will ever do.
Why Shepherd's Bush? Who was
the Shepherd? When did he live?
Of what did his Bush consist 2 Was
it a gorse bush or a holly bush, a
gooseberry bush, or a Bull and
Bush? Why had he only one? All
these questions we are prepared to
answer, having spent much good
time in the British Museum up to
our necks in research.
To begin with, here is the story of
the Shepherd. His name might have
been, but was not, Norval. His name
was Giles. Later this grew into
Giles Shepherd, owing to his interest
in sheep, which he carefully tended
day and night for a hard taskmaster.
From a shepherd he became in time
a flock owner, and his sheep grazed
on the luscious grass between Not-
ting Hill Gate and Acton, in the days
when neither of those pleasure re-
sorts had been heard of. For Giles
Shepherd lived a very long time ago,
ere yet old Dan CHAUcER had tuned
his rathe pipe.
It is difficult to think of Greater
London in Giles Shepherd's days.
Imagine a green plain, broken only
by gentle undulations and bisected
by a bad road here and there. That
was London west of the City.
Imagine it. No Tube, no buses, no
miles of houses, no Ealing spire, no
Wormwood Scrubbs prison, no Olym-
pia, and, more than all, no Shep-
herd's Bush Exhibition.
And that brings us to an interest-
ing point. Giles Shepherd, when in
his cups, or rather flagons, for he put
away, the mead to some purpose,
would sink into a trance, in which he
could see far into the future, how
accurately none knew then, but all
Inay know now. It was in one such
cataleptic swoon, dead, as a later
sage has expressed it, to the world,
that he dictated to a learned clerk
who shared his potations the famous
shepherd's rede, as it is called, in
which he foretold that a time would
come when the fields on which his
flocks were then grazing would be
built over, and would no longer be

fields, and that one day a white city
would be erected in their midst,
which would not be ready for the
public until months after it was
thrown open. All this did Giles
Shepherd see in his dream, and all
this was written down in monkish
characters by his clerk companion,
and preserved piously for our own
eyes to rest upon in the British
Museum.
Is not that an interesting story?
Giles Shepherd, we have further dis-
covered, lived to a round old age, much
respected by his sheep, and finally
died, leaving a sum of fourpence to
be spent annually in providing tee-
total beverages to a hundred poor
topers. Money was so much more
valuable in those days that the fund,
being never applied for, has swelled
to enormous proportions, requiring a
board of directors to administer it,
and offices and a banqueting-hall to
administer it in.
So much for Giles. Shepherd, who
gave his name to the district in which
this wonderful embryonic Exhibition
is now being held. No one can go
there without thinking of his brave
and useful life.

PUN CH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARLY
[May 27, 1908.
vers DE société—NEw style.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Always—as becomes a stalwart
and up-to-date Radical—a diligent and devout student
of the “Social and Personal '', column in The Daily
Chronicle, I have been much impressed with the note of
lyrical ecstasy which inspires the writer in the discharge
of his exalted duties. More than any one else he brings
home to us the profound and welcome truth that to be
a successful and shining Liberal it is not necessary to
lead a life of Spartan asceticism and self-denial; on the
| contrary, that the votaries of Peace, Retrenchment,
and IReform lend fresh lustre to their cause by the sump-
tuousness of their entertainments and the splendour of
their attire. Only in one respect, however, do these
records of the strenuous opulence of our enlightened
plutocracy admit of improvement. Facit assentatio
versum. So noble a theme ill assorts with a pedestrian
medium of expression. I am only too well aware that
the following efforts are crude and amateurish, but if
they serve, as I humbly hope they will, to stimulate the
competition of The Daily Chronicle I shall not have|
laboured in vain.
Believe me to be,
Yours with profound respect,

BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I won't keep you a minute. I
only want to protest against some of the idiotic names
which are being showered on the Franco-British Exhi-
bition. The Daily Mail is evidently determined that
we shall call it The White City and only The White
City. I daresay it paid Mr. BART KENNEDY a fabulous
sum for inventing the title, and I don't blame it for
trying to get its money's worth. But when I am asked
by the Central London Railway to “Go to the
Busheries by the Tuberies '' (I am not romancing, this
is an actual advertisement), I think it is time to protest.
The next thing will be for the London General Omni-
bus Company to invite us to Go to the Shepherdies by
the Motory-Busseries ' If we must have an endearing
name for the Exhibition (at any rate during its inco-
herent infancy), surely some of your readers could
evolve something better than The White City and The
Busheries, which suggest respectively a cemetery and a
nursery garden. Yours faithfully,
A READER of PUNCHERIES.
P.S.—A friend, who has thought about it a good deal,
sends me the following suggestion, the best that has yet
reached me:– “Why not call it The Franco-British
Exhibition ? '’ he asks.

FIGURES AND TLETTERS.
The Evening News' announcement
last week of “23” as the title of its
new serial story has started an in-
teresting discussion among authors
and publishers. For some time the
clashing of titles has been a cause of
trouble in the book world, and there
is a feeling that perhaps in the use of
figures a better way, for a time at
any rate, may be found.
“ Unless a title is either Biblical or
Shakspearean,” said a well-known
publisher to our representative, “it
is notorious that a book has little
chance. Both those sources having
been exhausted, the use of figures
would carry us on for at least another
six years. After that, something
else would have to be found. Of
course, the simpler the figure the
more easily can it be remembered,
and the better chance is given to the
book. I have, therefore, entered all
| numbers from 1 to 100 at Stationers’
Hall for my clients. “1” is to be
the title of the next book of our lead-
ing novelist, whose recent researches
in Egypt * > -
Calling on another famous pub-
lisher, our representative gathered
the opinion that, while figures were
good, the combination of letters and
figures was better. “There will be
a rush to register the title ‘ 1 ' for
instance,” said the senior partner
with a smile. “Well, let them have
it. Personally we have secured ‘A1,’
and that will be the title of our lead-
ing novelist's new book. You saw in
the papers, no doubt, that she was
reserving the announcement of the
title for a few weeks. Well, you can
take it from me that that is the
title.’’
Looking in upon his tobacconist,
who is something of a wit, our repre-
sentative found him smiling gently
over the title “24.” “An epitome
of domestic life,” he said darkly.
“By the way, have you tried our
‘Tertium Quid '? No married home
is complete without it.”
THE AMENDE FEMININE.
DEAR JACK, when we quarrelled last
night
I told you to go, and you went,
And I've felt ever since I must write
To say I said more than I meant.
But your smile was so cuttingly calm,
Your manner so slightingly short,
That my sensitive feelings found
balm
In the shape of a bitter retort.
I told you to go in disgust,
Omitting the usual kiss,
Our tender adieu, which I trust,
Like me, you 've continued to miss.
Till then I’d consistently shown
A character guiltless of flaws;
Last night you were treated, I own,
To a small exhibition of claws.
My temper was hot, I confess,
I really won't argue again.
Much love, yours as ever—P.S.,
I am sure I was right in the main. .

Next came BULL with intent to make
a bull's-eye on Colonel SEELY as repre-
senting the Colonies. To Captain
CRAIG's firm hand and sure eye were
committed the life and fortunes of
RUNciMAN, just come to the Educa-
tion Office. As for WINTERTON, he,
firing right and left, was expected to
bring down Asquith at the head of
affairs, HERBERT GLADSTONE at the
Home Office, BIRRELL at the Irish
Office, and felt quite sure he would
never miss the spacious, figure of
NApoleon B. HALDANE.
This was the little scheme formu-
lated in secret council. In design
and frame faultless as those of Ter-
ritorial Army. The best laid schemes
of mice and statesmen ‘‘gang aft
agley’’ (anglice, don't always come
off). The Ministers marked down for
slaughter warily kept out of range.
The conspirators fondly pictured
them getting up one after another,
and in varying form making excuse
for their shameless neglect of the
highest Imperial interests. Their
absence spoiled the whole thing.
Worse still, the PREMIER stepped in.
An awkward man to take a hand in
this sort of game. Answering for
self and colleagues, he coolly re-
marked : “No sufficient reason has
been shown for departure in this
matter from the practice of our pre-
decessors.”
A nasty one that. Object of de-
monstration was, of course, to show
up this Government in its true light,
as Little Englanders who care no-O b viously it
thing for Empire or Empire Day.
And here was PREMIER incidentally
recalling familiar fact that during
their long term of office his prede-
cessors were equally guilty.
As SARK says, men will be boys
sometimes.
Business done.—Second reading
debate on Education Bill carried on
through eight hours in House that
successfully managed to conceal
tumult of feeling in the matter.
House of Lords, Friday.—Apart
from legislative circumstance, House
of Lords is ever interesting. Has a
way of flashing unexpected sidelights
on common objects that endears it to
mankind; and may be counted upon
to prevail against the machinations of
those who would mend it or end it.
Only the other night BURLY BALFour
accidentally unearthed a curious ety-
mological fact. In Committee on
Scottish Land Values Bill he moved
an amendment in which he spoke of
“any purpose to which such land can
presently be devoted.”

would be inconvenient to embody in
Act of Parliament a word which has
contrary meanings according to the
geographical line above or below
which it is cited.
And now comes TweedMoUTH with
a new definition of Friendship. In
debate on alleged inefficiency of artil-
lery in Territorial Army he quoted a
letter from an authority “who,” he
added, “is a friend of Lord
Roberts.”
“How do you know he is my
friend?” asked the sturdy Bobs.
“I have seen you sitting together,"
replied Lord President of the Coun-
ciſ with air of ingenuous conviction
not generally shared by noble lords.
To the trained legal mind of LONG
John O'CoxNort, looking on from the
Commons' pen, there occurred what
may be cited as a leading case. For
many years after the great disruption
in Committee Room No. 15, TIM
HEALY and JoHN DILLON sat together
on second bench below gangway in
the Commons.
It is true they

quite in season. We bought
sixpenny-worth; the man put
them into a paper bag for us,
and we took them up on the
Heath to give them a gallop.
When we opened the bag we
found three newts inside. It
seemed impossible that the
thing could have happened
naturally, so we went back to
the shop to explain to the man
that he had made a mistake.
However he hadn't ; he had
merely given us one newt dis-

Well, we returned to the

he is quite as much at ease

the impression that my man's name
was TURLEY: I should say my third
of a man, because I share him with
two others, but anyhow I thought his
whole name was TURLEY. So I used
to write nice little notes, beginning
“If you're waking, call me, TURLEY,”
and leave them about for him. He
invariably woke at seven and read
them—and came and called me,
mother dear. Of course I had to get
up. Well, I have now heard that his
name is really Holland, which
makes all the difference. It would
be absurd to write him any more
notes of that kind. My one satisfac-

third of Holland, which is about

What did happen was that they got

they now? In the mighty Thames
somewhere, I suppose. So, CHARLEs,
if ever you are near the river, keep
a friendly eye open for them, will
you? They may be a little wild now,
but they were good newts in their
day.
We had a Buforium too in our time,
you must know. I have just made
that word up, and it means a place
where you keep toads. In our case it
was the sink. The toad, as you may
not have realised, has no vomerine or
maxillary teeth, but he has got a dis-
tinct tympanum. However, what I
really wanted to say was that the
toad has a pyriform tongue of incredi-
ble length, by means of which he
catches his prey, thus differing from
the frog, which leaps at 'em. We
used to station a toad opposite one of
the walls of the sink—of the Bufo-
rium, and then run his breakfast
down the side. Sometimes it would
be a very long centipede, and then
you could have one toad for each
end; or a-— What brutes little
boys are; I'm not going to tell you

say that his omosternum is generally

Did I ever talk to you about our
hedgehogs? We kept no end of
them, but Peter was the only one
who stayed. He used to live in the
scullery, so as to see that no black-
beetles got about. One night the
cook woke up suddenly and remem-
bered that she had left the scullery
tap running. So she jumped out of
bed and ran downstairs, not even
stopping to put on slippers. . . .
She was a very heavy woman. .
No, Peter wasn't hurt much ; but
she refused to have him in the
kitchen again.
This is a very zoological letter, but
I just wanted to show you that you
weren't the only one. Time fails me

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
AFTER reading The Metropolis (ARNOLD), I am not at
all surprised that London is so full of Americans just
now ; New York certainly seems the limit. Mr. UPTON
SINCLAIR's book would be called, I suppose, a story with
a purpose; actually it is almost entirely purpose with
only a very slight story. The hero spends most of his
time at the houses of hopeless vulgarians who eat too
much ; that, roughly, is the plot. There are a good
many other characters in the book, and they also eat too
much. Mr. SINCLAIR describes many of the things they
eat—with, it seems to me, a certain gusto; rather as if
he wanted you to know that he had been through it all
himself. (What a change from the corned beef in The
Jungle 1) When I read a book of this kind I am always
puzzled by one point. Is the author writing from his
own inside know---
ledge of what goes
on at these million-
aires' houses? If
not, then his testi-
mony is of little
value. On the other
hand, if he speaks
from experience,
then one cannot help
reflecting that he
has accepted the
hospitality of these
people, that he has
been given a very
good or, at any
rate a very filling
time by them, and
that now he is
making money by
running them down.
However, Mr. SiN-
cLAIR must settle
that with himself;
no doubt the end
justifies the means.
I wish him all suc-
cess in so far as his A. G. s.
campaign is against |\ºmen is nº
immorality; but I -
think he makes a mistake in attacking vulgarity so
strenuously. Ridicule would be a better weapon.
By The Gates that shall not Prevail (LANE), Mr.
HERBERT M. FARRINGTON means, I suppose, the powers
of hell. His hero, a muscular East End parson, is not
above persuading people to be Christians by the argu-
mentum ad fisticuffs, and is well qualified to take the mat
against the champion heavy-weight of the lower regions.
Mr. FARRINGTON calls him Brother Paul. Brother Peter
would surely be a more suitable name, and personally I
should have been tempted to christen Mr. Higgins, late
king of the Sandbaggers (whom Brother Paul had
brought into the fold by knocking him out), Niblick Nick
instead of Bunker Bill. A niblick has just as much to
do with sand as a bunker, and seems to express more
aptly the unregenerate character of the converted
Hooligan. But that is by the way. Brother Paul sits
to a fashionable Free-thinking painter for an allegorical
portrait (bearing the same title as the book), in which he
is represented in his monkish cassock defying the storms
ove-ºns ----> .

IF THAT Floweſt KNEW. This was N'T REAL RAIN, it wouldN'T GRow
of hell by the aid of the Cross. He also proves himself
a very St. ANTHONY by the strength with which he re-
sists the alluring advances of the artist's favourite
model, a lady, I regret to say, who was no better than
she should be. In the end both Freethinker and
Magdalen are won over by Brother Paul's influence to
join in his New Crusade against wickedness in high (and
low) places. Though the tone and tendency of the book
are irreproachably moral, I think it suffers artistically
from being part novel and part sermon. Nevertheless,
unlike so many modern examples of its two component
parts, it is neither stupid nor dull.
Mr. John Ayscough shows in his novel Marotz (CoN-
sTABLE) that he is a master of detail; but he is, I think,
in some danger of allowing detail to master him. “The
reader may be oceasionally bored,’’ he seems to say,
“but no detail of Marotz's life is insignificant to me,
and I mean to write my book in my own way.” It is,
- perhaps, ungrateful
to complain of Mr.
AYscough's method
when, on the whole,
it produces a most
excellent result.
But I confess that
Marotz's life in the
Convent of the Re-
paration (she arrives
there on p. 97 and
doesn't get out till
p. 178) is described
with a wearisome
minuteness. Mr.
AYscough is him-
self aware that he
is becoming tedious,
for just before his
heroine leaves the
C on v ent he
writes : — “To the
reader it is scarcely
likely that Marotz
should have ap-
peared very interest-
ing.” The remark
is both candid and ;
true. However,
- - - during her early and
unhappy married life, and through the peaceful years
while she is bringing up her son in the lonely Sicilian;
castle, Marotz is drawn with admirable skill and care.
If some of the closing scenes are unexpected and fan-
tastic, nevertheless the book still impresses me as a
very sincere and conscientious piece of work.
WHAT's
Mr. PAUL HERRING's Dragon's Silk (CAssell) is
drowned in dialogue, and I should be very sorry to have
to count the “smart '' remarks which are scattered over
its pages. Mr. HERRING manufactures jokes without
difficulty, but he is far too easily satisfied. “To be un-
attainable,” said her Grace in an epigram, “is an ideal
life, and produces satisfactory dividends.” Her Grace,
by the way, was called the Duchess of Dazzle; but I
cannot say that her conversation reflected her title. Mr.
HERRING's lavish display of verbal fireworks suffers from
a prevailing dampness, and his undoubted gifts of
imagination are lost in a riot of words. If he would give
up trying to be so amusing I think that his next novel
might be really good. For Mr. HERRING has ideas.

Our present electoral System,
according to Mr. Asquith, is “an
inadequate and untrustworthy ex-

this exceedingly satisfactory.

398 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [JUNE 3, 1908.
TO A CANDIDATE FOR A CORONET.
[The PRIME MINISTER addresses a climber (M.P.) who has been of
great pecuniary assistance to the Party, but cannot be raised to the
Peerage because his seat is not considered safe, his majority being
a paltry two thousand.]
SIR-and I would that I could say “My Lord "-
None more than you deserves a title;
Your gifts are such that I can scarce afford
Adequate space for their recital;
But this is not the psychic hour, I fear,
For making you a Peer.
Your claims are obvious. If in point of birth
You are as yet a mere beginner,
You have attained to that more solid worth
Which stamps to-day the certain winner;
For wealth, like “simple faith,” can always sneeze
- At Norman pedigrees. -
\
True instinct warned you not to waste your time
On feats of science, art or letters;
You felt that only fools would hope to climb
That way to seats among their betters;
Besides, you never (frankly) had a brain
Designed for such a strain. -
But other gifts you had, and these you pressed,
With lavish hints of more to follow,
Into the Liberal Party's yawning chest
Where nothing ever fills the hollow;
And every time you thought : “Unless I err,
Something must soon occur.’’
For it was understood, though no one spoke,
Since spoken terms might sound too sordid,
That loyalty like yours was not a joke,
And couldn't well go unrewarded;
Otherwise Virtue, to the general sorrow,
Would shut up shop to-morrow.
So you were put upon the waiting list.
Then came those dreadful by-disasters,
Which made us feel how much you might be missed
If, in revolt from former pastors,
Your flock's majority, two thousand strong,
Happened to go all wrong.
Few seats, in fact, are safe—this side the Tweed
(Thank Heaven for Scotland's taste in humour !);
And you, who were to found a noble breed,
Must be content to spread a rumour
That you declined to join, though clear the call,
A House condemned to fall.
You are well out of it; for yours would be
The sorry end which fate conferred on
That Greek who steered the Persians o'er the sea,
And won a golden crown for guerdon,
Whereat the Admiral, by way of banter,
Chopped off his head instanter. O. S.
“To Kill Wasps.-Clap your hands smartly together so as to crush
the insect between them as it flies. When thus killed it is quite unable
to sting."—The Country Side.
Though it is quite true that a dead wasp cannot sting,
yet it should be noted that a dying wasp is sometimes
so ungrateful as to spurn the hand that stroked it.
Beginners, therefore, should avoid the “south end,”
where the sting is, and clap the animal on the head.
SONGS IN SEASON.
[Spoken to the Editor.]
MY dear sir, you would like to have the first
refusal of a really good song? No self-respecting music-
hall will soon be without its “Exhibition Song,” and,
in anticipation of the great demand there is sure to be,
I beg to submit the following samples:—
No. 1.
[Note:-This song may be sung in public (singer's risk), and should
be delivered by a real lady dressed in clothes which no gentleman
would wear.]
At Shepherd's Bush the Franco-Brit
At present, 's going strong,
And those who haven't been to it
Should not delay too long;
So get your shillings ready, boys,
And ask your girl to go
And share with you the many joys
Of-this—stu-pen-dous—show !
(Chorus)
Come, come, come to the Bush along,
Don't dee-lay !
What if you do have to struggle and push a long
Way, way, way 2
Once you get there won't it make FlossIE stare
It will strike her dumb ;
And imagine her joy when you take her, my boy,
To the stadi-adi-um !
You don't seem to care much for that song? Well,
here I have a different kind altogether. This song should |
be sung by a Naval officer—Admiral preferred—who
waves a Union Jack in one hand and a Tricolor in the
other. He must have white gloves, and the tune should
be something like the Marseillaise, with just a soupçon
of the National Anthem in it. Dark stage. Limelight
on the flags.
No. 2.
In Nelson's days the French we fought
On land and on the sea; (waves Union Jack.)
In Nelson's time who would have thought
To-day such friends we'd be 2 (waves Tricolor.)
Our flags are both Ited, White and Blue,
And out at Shepherd's Bush
They wave together, and now who (defiantly)
Will dare those flags to push 2
(wavcs both flags.)
[Why “push ’’?–Ed.
Didn't I tell you this is a music-hall song?
Ah! I had forgotten.—ED.j
(Chorus)
Then here 's to the new-formed friendship
'Twixt France and old John Bull;
May neither of us ever have to send ship
[Pardon me; I think I will take advantage of the offer
you made me at the beginning of this interview.—Ed.
What offer?
The first refusal of your songs —Ed.]
“The Musical Society then gave a performance of ‘The Jackdaw of
Rheims.' We cannot but admit that a further week's practice would
have made a difference. On more than one occasion the sopranos failed
to come in at the right time and generally speaking the singers were
not well together. Nevertheless the performance was in oth r respects
a good one."—The Cambridge Chronicle.
After all, heartiness and good fellowship are what you
look for chiefly in a Musical Society.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
To MAKE THE “Revival of The glories of the BRighton Road” MoRE complete, why should Not other PUBLIC-SPIRITED MILLIONAIRE8
Join IN? MR. CARNEgie, FoR INSTANCE, Might “hold Up” The VANDERbilt coach IN THE Good old style.
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
A Series of Hurried Halfpenny
Leaders.
CAUSE I.
An old woman at East Marden has been so
severely stung by a bee that she has been con-
fined to bed for a week.
EFFECT.
THE Toll of The HIVE.
It might almost be said that every
day brings with it a new menace;
that life becomes more and more in-
secure and fugitive. Science toils
unceasingly to wrest the secrets from
disease, and devise means whereby
its terrible inroads may be repaired or
prevented, while Nature at the same
time is loosing her trained assailants.
As summer after summer arrives,
and brings with it the melancholy
tale of the stings of bees, it becomes
more and more evident that some-
thing drastic must be done if man-
kind is to be preserved from the blind
attacks of this venomous insect. We
submit with all seriousness that the
time has come to ask ourselves the
question, Is honey worth the cost?
There are parts of England during
Swarming time where the ground
literally runs blue with the common
rural antidote to the poison of the
hive, too often, alas! of small avail,
as a piece of news in our columns this
morning again testifies. Once more
we ask, Is honey worth such a cost?
CAUSE II.
Mr. W. Hugh Spottiswoode announces a
large increase in the demand for Printer's
Pie this year.
EFFECT.
A NEW DISH.
It is gratifying to note that the
British people are alive to the re-
sponsibilities of their position as
leaders of the world (although how
long they can hold it with such a
Government as we now groan
under is a question tragic in its un-
certainty), and are sufficiently supple
and plastic to be willing to experi-
ment in new and wholesome articles
of diet. What Printer's Pie is we
do not know; of what ingredients
it is composed, or how prepared for
human consumption; but it has a
healthy substantial sound, and we
have no more hesitation than usual
in devoting a short leader in praise
of our countrymen for their enter-
prise and good sense. Yorkshire
pudding and Norfolk dumplings (“the
jockeys for me,” as ColeRidge's
friend said) have formed the basis of
many a stalwart British hero: why
should not the pie of the printer?
And so on.
CAUSE III.
The death is announced at Leeds of a house-
agent named Webb, who has been in business
for sixty-five years.
EFFECT.
A DANGEROUs PROFEssion.
A telegram from our special cor-
respondent at Leeds reveals a state of
things that cannot be too seriously
considered by the nation at large, and
especially by the paterfamilias who is
casting about for some career for his
son. We refer to the death some-
where or other of a house agent. The
tragic thing is that almost every day
brings a similar piece of news.
One had always thought of the house
agent as the member of a singularly
reposeful and secure profession, im-
mune from risks. But that is not
the case. The house agent is sub-
jected to a thousand perils, not the
least of which is that of continually
entering empty and, therefore, un-
aired houses, often still damp from
new bricks and mortar, with, very
likely, thorough draughts in every
room, owing to defective glazing. We
cannot too seriously deprecate the

unwisdom, to give it only a mild term,
of owners of house property who do
not keep fires always alight. Other
evils of the house agent's life are the
risks of tripping up and falling over
surveyor's pegs, or even over his own
tape measure, together with brain
fever from the intricate task of re-
ducing an estate to rods, poles, and
perches. Altogether we think it ad-
visable to warn fathers face to face
with the question, What to do with
our boys? to be very circumspect.
-
PERFORMERS IN PERIL.
STRANGE AdventurEs of EMINENT
MUsiciaNs.
THE perils to which musicians are
exposed in the pursuit of their pro-
fession have been vividly illustrated
by the thrilling experiences of Sir
FREDERick BRIDGE, who, as we learn
from a recent issue of The Daily
Chronicle, while crossing the Rockies
was wantonly attacked by a grizzly
bear, and, though armed with no
other weapon beyond a hymn-book,
contrived to keep the savage intruder
at bay.
But the adventure of the genial
organist of Westminster, alarming as
it undoubtedly was, is easily cast into
the shade by the terrific and unex-
ampled experience which recently
befell Mr. and Mrs. HUGo BAMBERGER
during a holiday trip to Switzerland.
The gifted violinist and his charming
wife were accompanied, as usual, by
their remarkable child, Boleslas
(who, though only two years old, has
already obtained a complete mastery
of the double-bass), and on the
occasion in question were wheeling
him in his semi-grand overstrung
Blüthstein pram in the grounds of
the hotel at Zermatt, when a golden
eagle suddenly swooped from an in-
credible altitude, seized the unsus-
pecting infant in its talons and soared
away to its eyrie on the summit of
the Schreckhorn. The situation
might have paralysed some parents,
but Mr. and Mrs. BAMBERGER never
lost their presence of mind for a
single moment. Rushing to the
hotel the gifted virtuoso at once tele-
phoned to the Commander-in-Chief
of the Swiss Army for the loan of a
captive balloon and a parachute,
which arrived in the course of a few
hours by special train. To inflate
the balloon and ascend in it to the
eagle's eyrie was simple enough, but
in the course of the ensuing struggle
for the possession of the priceless
infant the envelope of the balloon
was pierced by the eagle's beak.
This, however, was the bird's last
effort, and the intrepid parents de-
scended safely with their portentous
offspring in the parachute. Con-
gratulatory telegrams were subse-
quently received from Herr Kusse-
witzky, the famous double-bass vir-
tuoso, Mr. CoRTELYoU, Mr. OTHO
Twigg, Mr. ORRY Cor.JEAG, and
many other celebrities. We are glad
to hear that Master Boles LAs is none
the worse for his adventure, though
the eagle has succumbed to the
wound inflicted by Mrs. BAMBERGER
with a diamond-hilted hairpin pre-
sented her by Count TAssilo FESTE-
Tics. The only untoward incident
connected with the episode was the
loss, by the rescuers, of a priceless
collection of press-cuttings, which
they inadvertently left in the eagle's
nest.
In this context mention may fit-
tingly be made of the narrow escape
from a watery grave enjoyed by Mr.
BAMBERGER last autumn while dry-
fly fishing for tarpon in the Nile near
Luxor. Mr. BAMBERGER, who is an
expert disciple of old Is AAk, had
hooked, as he thought, a remarkably
fine specimen of the tarpon tribe
when a terrific tug at his line upset
his balance and precipitated him into
the waters of the historic stream.
Holding his rod firmly in one hand
while he paddled with the other, Mr.
BAMBERGER suddenly realised that
he had hooked, not a tarpon but a hip-
popotamus, which made rapidly for
him, spouting with rage and emit-
ting prolonged hoots. The situation
was most precarious, as Mrs. BAM-
BERGER, who watched the scene from
the bank, was unable to swim, and
no musical critics or reporters were
within hail; but by a miraculous
coincidence the monster, when only
a couple of yards off, was suddenly
seized with cramp, and sank like a
stone, leaving the renowned artist to
scramble on shore, dripping but un-
daunted. The hippopotamus, we may
add, was subsequently recovered,
and his head, superbly stuffed, graces
one of the thirty-six best bedrooms in
Mr. BAMBERGER's palatial residence
in Park Lane.

amusement. Returned a sympa-
thetic answer.
10.30. — Received deputation of

persons who have married their de-

benevolent neutrality, but deeply re-

in the way of endowing a National

but twice before they refused to
grant special pensions to the parents
of infant prodigies earning less than
£5,000 a year. Added that although

modating attitude on this as indeed
on every question which appealed to
the elementary instincts of our com-
mon humanity. (Great cheering.)
Learning to think Imperially.
From an Empire Day essay by a
L.C.C. child (aged 7):
“There are a lot of Empires, like Chinese
Empire, Hackney Empire, Stratford Empire,
and Russian Empire. Hackney Empire is
different to ours, tºur, they sing there, and
ours is places.”
The distinction between the two
classes of Empire is admirably de-
fined; and it is further emphasised by
a second child, who says: “The
British Empire belongs to us, you
can go in free.” “Ours is the best,”
says a third, and, again, “You don't
pay anything.” It is good to see this
recognition of our free birthright.

DEAR CHARLEs, A thing has just

happens to people in jokes.
would not believe it did I not lay my
hand on my heart—(the heart isn't
on the left side, as you thought, by
the way.
only the left auricle does all the
work. However)—on my heart, and
swear that it is true.
I was in the silver department of
Liberty's buying some spoons. Yes,
I fell back on spoons, after all.
(Never fall back on , a spoon,
CHARLEs, if you can help it.) It was
a hot day, and the business of selec-
tion was so exhausting that I took off
my hat and gloves, and laid them on
a chair beside me. When it was all
over the man went off to make out
the bill. I wandered round the
place, looking at all the other things
which I wished I had bought in-
stead. Suddenly a voice at my side
said:
“Can you tell me if this is where
you get ladies' jerseys for golf?”
(I told you you had to get a jersey
for golf.)
I said: “Oh, do you think that is
a good thing? I rather thought of
spoons myself. . . . .I mean, for a
wedding present one does want some-
thing which. . . Oh, I beg your
pardon. . . Yes, I am Mr. LIBERTY.
No Liberty at all, madam, I assure
you. . . This is the silver depart-
ment, you know. . . Yes, all that
white shiny stuff. . . Well, I dare-
say we could do you one, if you
wouldn't mind having the lion
worked on it. . . No, we don't
charge for the lion. . . Or what
about something quite simple in
pewter. ... Oh, I see. . . . The art
muslin department would be the
nearest thing we have. . . a freer
swing, certainly. . . Good morning.”
Well, no, I didn't say that ex-
actly. Having my hand on the left
side of my heart it would be impos-
sible to pretend that I did. With the
best intentions in the world how easy
it is, LUcy, to slip from the rocky
path of truth into the crevasse of
make-believe. (Maxim from The
Fairchild Family.) But really and
'really, CHARLEs, she did take me
for the shopwalker in the silver de;
partment, and she did ask for ladies'
golf jerseys. What I actually said
was : “I’m very sorry, but I'm
afraid I'm only a customer.” And
she said: “Oh, I'm so sorry.” And
then I put on my hat to show that I
had one, and took it off again to show
that I knew my manners, and she
You
It 's bang in the middle,
went off to the clock counter, and
said she was sorry to trouble the man
behind it, but could he tell her where
she went for ladies' jerseys for golf,
and he said he was very sorry, but
they didn't sell them. Altogether
there was a good deal of sorrow going
about.
IBut not on my part—never. In
common tweeds, to be mistaken
for one of those splendid frock-
coated gentlemen, and admitted into
a lady's confidence on a question of
jerseys—there was glory, for you. I
doubt now if I ought to have gone
down to Castle Bumpbrook. Any-
how, I should have insisted on all the
gate.
What was the gate? I distinctly
saw three small boys hiding behind
a cow. I suppose they paid all
right? CHARLEs, I did enjoy it
awfully, as I think I have told you
several times. It was good of you
to send me in first with the postman,
and as a postman I am sure I should
love him very much, but he is too
fast for me on the cricket field.
There wasn't a run there, you know
—a simple shot straight to cover. I
expect he thought it was an “ex-
press delivery '' or “late fee ''
stroke, with “immediate '' in the top
left-hand corner; or perhaps the
brown pad made him think I was a
telegram. lf I ever go in first with
him again I shall register myself.
I gather that the Vicar has to bowl
at one end all the time, hasn't he?
In lieu of tithes or something. Other-
wise you get the Ecclesiastical Com-
missioners down on you. He varies
his pitch cleverly, I admit. His firstly
would take any batsman by surprise;
I can't think why it only bounces
once—finger-spin, I suppose. Then,
immediately afterwards, you get his
secondly, a high full-pitch which
would almost be a wide in a layman.
Yet all the time you feel that he is
only leading up to his sixthly and
lastly my brethren, which is one of
the subtlest half-volleys I have ever
seen. But is “over the wall ” out?
I thought that was only when you
played in a garden with a stump.
Perhaps being the churchyard wall
makes a difference.
CHARLEs, I love your garden. It
was jolly to see the white flower of
Mrs. Sinkins' blameless life again.
I knew Mrs. Sinkins as a bulb-I
mean as a boy, and have always re-
garded her with affection. I suppose
I shall have to wait for Dorothy
Perkins. She is hardly out yet.
My love is like a-— Oh, but Dorothy
is pink. Anyhow, she sweetly
smiles in June, and it 's just on
June, so I'm blowed if I don't come
down to see her next month, whether
you ask me or not. Better send me
an invitation for form's sake.

That's cut by a nigger
Who hasn't a rag to his back?
O Afric's coral strand,
Where Nature wears a smile,
Where orchids glow in bravest

And all things grow sans spade or

Is man alone so vile?
Because each loathes his neigh-

And crude sartorial style.

To a person whose breeks

How can he dissemble the passion
He feels when there passes along
A person arrayed in
A suit that is made in
A style that is hopelessly wrong?
He cannot help a sigh
Upon the veld to see
A knee that bags, a seam that sags,
A sleeve that drags, a cuff in rags;
However hard he try

Great truths of prophetical kind,
But this would appear
To be perfectly clear

A bit up-to-dater,
Will harmony dwell in the land.
When quite the latest cry

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
May 25.—NAPOLEON B. HALDANE can
be silent in seven languages. Also
can be exceedingly voluble in one.
This a red-letter day for him. In the
space of thirty-five minutes , he
worked off sixty-eight speeches.
Nominally they were answers to
questions. Actually, with one excep-
tion, they had the due proportions of
a speech.
Exception cruelly made in case of
ARNOLD-ForsTER. Had prepared a
poser with respect to Territorial Field
Artillery. And now N. B. H., lavish
in reply to others, curtly said, “The
answer to the first part of the
question is Yes; the second, No.”
What could be fairer? Still it
wasn’t nice to make the distinction.
Compared with his treatment of the
INTERROGAtoRY AsHLEY, the difference
The CATECHETIC CATERPILLAR ;
Or, “HALDANE's PEST.”
(Hon. W-lfr—d Ashl-y.)
painfully marked. Of thirty-four
questions on paper addressed to War
Minister, a fraction over one-sixth
stood in name of THE ENQUIRER. But
that only half the truth. Whilst his
printed questions were numbered up
to six, they actually contained eleven
distinct interrogations. Nor was that
all. Having studied the early manner
of the Irish Members, THE ANxious
ENQUIRER never accepts N. B. H.’s
luminous speechlets for a full answer.
He is up again in a moment. In-
stinctively assumes attitude of note
of interrogation, and puts a supple-
mentary question. .
This elicits fresh speech, one of
whose sub-divisions suggests another
question. On the average he works
off three supplementary questions,
which, “by a simple rule of arith-
metic,” as Don José said when ex-
pounding the gospel of Old Age
Pensions, brings his contributions to
the sitting up to forty-four ques-
tions.
From other side of House, BELLAIRs
looks on moodily. In the new Par-
liament he was the inventor of this
form of entertainment. Taking the
Navy under his wing, he, day after
day, put down series of argumenta-
tive questions, following them by
others “arising out of that answer.’’
LAMBERT, Cincinnatus of the Minis-
try, taken from his farm to assist in
ruling the King's Navee, bore the
ordeal without showing sign of its
ravages. SARK tells me he has at the
back of the Admiralty a rood of land.
When things go wrong in the office
or the House, he takes off his coat,
brings out a spade from its hiding-
place, and makes believe he is dig-
ging potatoes on his farm at Spreyton
IBow, North Devon.
EdMUND Robertson, his colleague
at the Admiralty, had no such means
of relaxation. He was literally wor-
ried into the Peerage by BELLAIRs,
and promises himself the pleasure of
presently coming down to the House
and from Peers' Gallery seeing how
MACNAMARA likes it.
Time in its traditionally obliging
fashion has brought its revenges.
BELLAIRs' patent has been infringed.
What he did for the Navy, AshLEY is
now undertaking to do for the Army.
Method and manner are servilely
copied. Every day THE ENQUIRER
puts down two or three questions on
the paper. Follows them up by
others suggesting that the Minister,
hopelessly cornered, is criminally en-
deavouring to throw dust in eyes of
representative of the people, is mis-
leading them by garbled statements
or deliberate evasion.
Hard that, even under LLoyd-
GEORGE's highly extolled new Patents
Act, there is in this matter no protec-
tion for the inventor. Happily BEL-
LAIRs has one endearing little trick
that may not be purloined. When
he rises to put supplementary ques-
tion, he holds a rolled-up copy of the
Orders in both hands, and as he
speaks wrings it as if it were a wet
towel or the neck of the Civil Lord
of the Admiralty. The latter sugges-
tion being more à propos, the habit
“Wrings it as if it were a wet towel or the
neck of the Civil Lord of the Admiralty.”
(Mr. C-rly-n B-ll-rs.)
contributes considerably to the effect
of scathing inquiry.
Busincss done.—Income Tax Reso-

Tuesday.—Since VERNoN DUNCAN
PIRIE, ex-Captain, fluttered the
Courts of Europe by organising a
Foreign Legion for service in the
Greek War, he was never so elate as
when, this morning, he tripped down
to the House. A great opportunity
awaited him. Was in charge of a
Bill designed to give Home Rule to
Scotland, or, as the instrument was
officially described, “a Bill to amend
the provisions for the future govern-
ment of Scotland.”
An ordinary Private Member in
such case would have formally moved
for leave to introduce it. This would
have been given as a matter of
course; the Bill would have been
printed and circulated; on moving
the second reading its fond parent
might expatiate on its merits,
capabilities and possibilities. PIRIE
knew better than that, Ministers
are accustomed to introduce im-
portant measures under the Ten
Minutes Rule (so called because there
is nothing in the Standing Order
alluding to ten minutes). Why should
an important measure affecting Scot-
land be smuggled through its initia-

tory stage? PiRIE answered the
question himself. Claimed the privi-
lege of the Ten Minutes Rule; rising
in a House which seemed lamentably
indifferent to the issue, began what
should have been the exposition of
the scheme.
Unhappily House of Lords has
been at it again, mauling Scottish
Land Bills and the like. Now was
the opportunity of giving what in
cribbage is described as “one for his
nob.” The exercise might have
passed without comment but for
chance presence of PRINCE ARTHUR.
Lingering after Questions to take part
in discussion on procedure with re-
spect to the Budget in Committee,
he ominously pricked up his ears
when the pugnacious PIRIE, forgetful
of his Bill to amend the provisions
for the future government of Scot-
land, ran amok at the Lords. At the
end of five minutes he rose to point
of order. Was it permissible, he
asked the SPEAKER, that a Member
avowing intention of explaining the
clauses of a Bill should make these
excursions into controversy 2
The SPEAKER thought it would
perhaps on the whole be better if the
hon. Member would confine himself
to explanation. VERNoN DUNCAN dis-
played amiable inclination to join in
discussion of this side issue. Was
proceeding at length when SPEAKER,
quoting HERRick, reminded him that
Old Time is still a-flying. One half
of his allotted opportunity had
lapsed, and he had not yet ap-
proached the Bill. Thus adjured,
PIRIE turned to his Bill, and was be-
ginning to explain it when time was
called.
“A scheme so crude that its own
author cannot explain it to the
House,” said PRINCE ARTHUR, with
unwonted bitterness. If he went
into the Lobby alone he would oppose
the motion for the first reading.
A jubilant cheer broke forth from
the faithful seated behind him. Go
into the Lobby alone? Not if BAN-
BURY knew it. Still small in num-
bers (in spite of by-elections) but
high in spirit, the Opposition leaped
to their feet, and with cheers
escorted their chieftain to the “No”
Lobby. As for PIRIE, he got under
lee of the colossal figure of EUGENE
WAsoN, who acted as co-teller, and,
coming up to the table, breathlessly
announced figures which showed that
his Bill was saved. But it was a
near thing.
“No more Ten Minutes Rule for
me,” he said, mopping his brow on
resuming his seat below the gangway.
Business done. — More Budget
'resolutions agreed to.
Friday.—With hereditary courage,
self-abnegation, devotion to public
affairs, Lord IRobert CECIL deliber-
ately resolved to make a dreadful
example of himself. If there is one
illicit Parliamentary practice he
abhors more than another it is that
known as “blocking ” Bills or reso-
lutions. The process is as follows:
When a Member gives notice to bring
in a Bill or move a resolution, a
nimble-footed adversary runs to the
Clerks’ Table and hands in a resolu-
tion dealing with the same subject.
That puts a spoke in the wheel. Ac-
cording to the Standing Orders no
question may be debated if there
already stands on the paper notice of
intended action thereupon.
Lord Robert has, since the present
Government came in, determined to
stop this abuse. Judge, then, of the

general horror when, The O'GRADY
having given notice to call attention
to the visit of His MAJESTY to the
TsAR, the Orders of the next day con-
tained a blocking motion standing in
the name of Lord Robert CECIL.
Now he explains it was all done on
principle. Adopting (on strictly tem-
perance lines) the classical example
of the Helot, he, in the interests of re-
form, determined to make of himself
an awful example that would bring
home to the minds of the House the
iniquity of the existing rule.
A noble idea, finely carried out.
Pity to hear Members scoffing and
sneering. As SARK says, some men
are too good for a carping world.

THE CRACKSMAN'S RIGHTS.
A MEETING convened by circular was held yesterday to
protest against the provisions of the Preventive Deten-
tion Bill introduced in the House of Commons by the
Home Secretary. The hall in which the meeting took
place was tastefully decorated with trophies of skeleton
keys, dark lanterns, india-rubber shoes, masks, revolvers
and jemmies. On the wall over the chairman's head
was displayed the motto “Our Profession Our Politics.”
There was a numerous attendance, the assemblage in-
cluding all the most noted cracksmen of the day. Mr.
Joseph LIGHTFoot (Gentleman Joe) was unanimously
voted to the chair. The proceedings began with the
singing of Sir WILLIAM GILBERT's pathetic ballad, “The
Enterprising Burglar,” which was exquisitely rendered
by the Fagin Quartette. Mr. LightFoot's speech
was marked by much feeling. He said that a crisis had
arrived in the noble vocation which they all had so
much at heart. Unless they rallied in defence of their
rights they would be crushed out of existence by a
Socialistic Government, which stopped at nothing. (Loud
cheers.) No doubt there were extremes in burglary, but
the profession itself was not responsible for them, and
this Bill, so far from putting a stop to them, would only
increase them. Up to now they had all done their best
to prevent the cracking of policemen's heads and the
unnecessary gagging of middle-aged female householders.
Why had they done that ? Because under a humane
code of law they had a hope of being able to retire on a
competence.
Now, however, that hope was to be taken
away from them. He had no hesitation in saying that
the Government would be responsible for every damage
that might be incurred by a constable or a citizen after
this infamous Bill was passed. It was the worst sort of
robbery. They were accustomed to be deprived of their
goods. That they had to endure, but they couldn't
suffer without a protest the wicked confiscation of the
last remnant of their liberty. Was there to be a time
limit for brewers and none for burglars? What was
sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander. Were
burglars to be imprisoned for ever? (Cries of “ Not
much.”) He denounced the hypocrisy of the Home
Office. This Bill would increase crime by making men
desperate. He concluded by moving the following reso-
lution :-" That this meeting protests emphatically
against the Preventive Detention Bill, and will leave no
stone unturned to prevent the passage of this iniquitous,
unconstitutional and confiscatory measure.”
The motion was seconded by Mr. WILLIAM Sikes in an
impassioned speech. He adjured his hearers by the
memory of his much-respected great-uncle not to falter
in the fight. Their rights were as sacred to them as those
of other people. Let them organise mass meetings in every
constituency, and bring pressure to bear on Members of
Parliament. A midnight procession must be organised,
and branches must be formed throughout the country.
He himself would head a deputation, and was pre-
pared to chain himself to the Home Secretary's railings.
At this juncture the appearance of a policeman was
the signal for a hurried stampede, the meeting breaking
up in confusion.

THE LONG WAY ROUND.
I of TEN feared that two years of
travel on the Continent would have
spoiled her natural simplicity. I
was more than delighted to find her
still unchanged. It was this very
simplicity which had first attracted
me to the little convent-bred girl by
the shores of Lake Leman. On the
slopes of Bouveret I had instructed
her in the gentle art of gentle flirta-
tion. I congratulated myself on
having accepted her sister's invita-
tion to call on them when they re-
turned to England.
a subject that I have at my fingers'
ends. I told her of every incident
that had happened to me from my
birth to the present day. Then I
retraced my steps to my early years,
with the help of some adventures
that had really happened to my
brother-in-law, and returned to the
present by appropriating the career
of a third cousin who is a bit of a
liar. But the end of the fourth mile
saw me no nearer the point than
had her topmost door-step.
We crossed a square and turned
down two streets in silence. Strangely
To my intense surprise the clergy-
man mounted the pulpit and gave
out his text. -
The sermon was followed by a
second hymn. After this the con-
gregation left in a body. I began to
grasp the situation.
“Didn't we miss part of it?” I
asked.
She said nothing.
“Your sister said that we should
have plenty of time,” I added, in-
dignantly.
She said nothing again.
At that moment a brilliant idea
flashed into my brain. I knew
From Geneva the conversa-
tion turned to Lucerne, from
Lucerne to Tell's Chapel,
from Tell's Chapel to chapels
in general, and thence to the
church. It was a Sunday
evening.
“EdNA will never take me
to church,” she said with a
sigh, “and she won't let me
go by myself.”
“They are so draughty,”
said EDNA, with a shudder.
“So are theatres,” she re-
plied.
The stars were shining
especially brightly as we left
the house. The chiming of
the innumerable bells floated
with unwonted sweetness on
the air. The path gave re-
siliently beneath my feet. I
recognised the symptoms,
and my heart leaped within
Ine.
For the first mile we
walked in silence. I had
my second sentence ready.
From this depended, in my
that a four-mile walk lay
ahead of us; but I determined
to make it six by judiciously
losing the way. It was
obvious that I should be
forced to find a new opening
remark. Also I had thought
out several new headings,
which would require time
when once I got really
started. I turned to the left.
She turned to the right.
“Where are you going?”
she asked.
“Why, back to your
house,” I answered, in a tone
of surprise.
“But that isn't the way
we came.’’
I gazed round me critically.
“I am certain that this is
the way.”
“Don’t be so absurd. I
ought to know my way home
by this time.” -
I adopted a firm tone. “I
have no intention of going in
that direction,” I said.
“You are so used to this
brain, a brilliant flow of elo-
quence. All that was lack-
ing was an opening remark.
This, for some reason, I was
absolutely unable to con-

I finally gave it up in de- -
spair. I decided to begin with
the second sentence. I opened my
mouth some fifty times. At the sight
of her dainty profile above the fluffy
white boa it closed itself with a snap.
If she had not been so sweetly simple
I should have found my task easier.
Yet it was for this very simplicity
that I loved her.
At the end of the second mile I
determined to begin a general
conversation, and trust that some
kind spirit would make an opening
for me. An ordinary girl, I knew
well, would have assisted the kind
spirit in his task; but she-- That
was why I loved her so.
For half a mile I talked rapidly on

enough it was her natural simplicity
that came to my rescue.
“You have told me,” she said,
“all about the curiously mixed life
you have led. It seems to me so
strange that in the course of your
numerous adventures you should
never once have fallen in love.”
“But I have ' '.' I shouted ; “I

Before I was able to tack my
second sentence on to these opening
words she spoke again.

are here.”
I was only just in time to open the
red-baize door for her. The congre-

“There is a pillar-box along this

“Yes, but not that pillar-box,” I
cried triumphantly.
She seemed puzzled. “Anyhow I
am certain that this is right,” she
said.
“I have no intention of going in
that direction,” I answered firmly.
“You can't go home alone, and you
will have to come my way.” -

she guess that my persistence was
only part of an ingenious scheme to
gain time for my declaration? I felt
the blackness of my guilt in severe

piece of deception I would ever in-

that it should have every chance of
reaching the past tense.

“Very well,” she said suddenly.
She came obediently to my side, and
we walked in silence the twenty
yards to the next corner. I turned
off to the left. This would take us
in a direction diametrically opposite
to that in which we had come. I was
determined to run no risks.
“Straight on, please,” said she.
I continued slowly along the road I
had selected. I intended to avoid
this discussion at every corner by a
show of silent firmness. I knew that
she would come to me. She was
such a timid simple little woman.
I had taken but ten paces when an
opening sentence of extraordinary
brilliance flashed into my mind. All
my troubles were over. The moment

me, ran up the steps, drew her sister
into the hall, and slammed the door.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
As you may gather from the title, Before Adam
(WERNER LAURIE) is not an up-to-date society novel.
The period is the Mid-Pleistocene; and Mr. JACK LoNDoN
gives his story the verisimilitude of the first person
singular by making the narrator a modern man who lives
over again, in his dreams, the life of his ancestral missing
link, Big Tooth. Many of our dreams, according to Mr.
LoNDON, are but racial memories. For instance, we
often dream that we are falling into space. That is be-
cause our ancestors, who lived in trees, were always fall-
ing off; the shock produced molecular changes in their
cerebral cells; and these changes were transmitted to the
cerebral cells of their progeny . . . . and eventually to
us. Now suppose the ancestor hit the ground and was
killed. Then he would not have any progeny after that.
tired) for the sake of his charming pictures, very racy of
furrow and fence, and his admirable sketches of hunting
types.
The casual Rahilly is a study that would not
shame the authors of An Irish R. M., and that is high
praise.
I commend the book to lovers of the shires, and
not less to citizens who only hunt by proxy but can
follow a good lead from cover to cover of a sporting tale.

The tale
is told in the first person, and apart from Lazzaro
Biancomonte's admission that he was once daunted
“for just a second,” he relates his virtues and his
valours with a self-complacency which inclines to be
irritating.
Still, if I could write “an epic modelled
upon the stately lines of Virgil,” perhaps I should be
immodest enough to describe it as “a brave thing when

it was done.
But if he saved himself by
clutching at a branch on
the way, he would still
have the shock to the
nervous system, and (it
might be) lots of progeny
subsequently. And that is
why when we dream we
are falling through space
we wake up before we hit
the ground; because our
ancestors never hit the
ground, at least, not until
they had become an-
cestors. So you should
always say to yourself
when you wake up with a
jerk, “A near thing that
time, Blue Nose, old boy.
Do be more careful in
future.” It is an interest-
ing theory—more interest-
ing, indeed, than the
story, which is a ver
plain (and short) tale from
the tree-tops. Mr. LONDON
gets fewer words on to a
page than anybody I

know. His ancestor must
have been an economist with the nuts.
If you get as far as the first chapter of Mr. RAMSAY's
The Key of the Door (HUTCHINsoN), you are bound to
see the thing through. I have seldom come upon an
introduction that intrigued me more. A popular
General, home after long absence, takes refuge in a
public building from the cheering crowds, and there
encounters a lady in waiting for him who claims to be
his wife, though he had never yet set eyes on her till
that moment. She is discouraged in her advances by
his polite inability to recognise her; but a pleasant
chance throws them together at Leicestershire covert-
sides, where they complicate the situation by falling in
love with one another. The author knows his country
and has the trick of communicating this intimacy.
If, perhaps, he seems more at home with hounds
and with the easy manners and morals of the folk who
follow them than he is with the perfect technique of his
art, I can easily excuse a few blemishes of style (notably
a tendency to false rhetoric in his heroine and a rather
perfunctory handling of the plot, of which he grows
As Lazzaro does not quote any of the
poetry which created such
a sensation, we must
accept his own estimate
of it; but he does record
some of the quips and
jests which amused the
Court, and they do not
amuse me overmuch.
Merely to call a man an
ass does not, for instance,
strike me as “a pretty
play of wit.” In truth
Lazzaro was abler at
deeds than at words, and
it is as a man of action

him. I wish, by the way,

Shining like a little star,
With the fairest face of all,

Watched you bend your head and

Over some absurd libretto—

Using language most profane,
When they see this hardy stock
Turning up and up again;
But to one as fresh as you

Everything is nice and new
In the good old Garden.

Hints of how the diva sang,
Notes on who was wearing what,
Just the old familiar gang—
Types that thrill the common breast
Having, so it seems, a smart air—
Not a word about the best
Flower of all the parterre.

Long elude that cheap success,
Long be missed among the names

DEAREST DAPHNE,--The way BERYL
CLARGEs is trying to best me as a
hostess is distinctly funny. She
was just mad about my getting the
darling NUM-NUM to look in at my
last big party, with all his jewels on.
He was worth a million as he stood,
my dear. A propos de quoi, BABs said
to me during the evening, “That
was an awfully nice man I was talk-
ing to when you came up. Who is
he 2 I don't remember meeting him
before.” “Probably not, my dear,”
I said. “He’s a 'tec from Scotland
Yard; there 's several of them here
to-night; such an expensive creature
as the NUM-NUM can't be trusted
alone, even among people who ought
to know better.’’ ‘‘What fun ' ' '
said BALs. “I’ll make him take mo
to supper and tell me who did the
Forest Hill murder.’’ -
There was only one small hitch that
night. I got a little nautch-girl
from an Amusement Bureau to dance
thing, squirmed a merveille, and
made one think of elephants and
palms and the Taj Mahal and all
that sort of thing, you know. The
NUM-NUM was so pleased that he
gave her a jewel and said some-
thing to her in native stuff. She
didn't understand, and one of the
suite said, “His Highness wants to
know what part of India you come
from.” “Is it where was I born ?”
said the little brown Indian
nautch-girl. “At Ballinasloe, your
Honour!'" Vexing for me, wasn't
it? As Norty said, my little Hindoo
turned out a little Hindon't
And now for BERYL's trying to get
even with me, and what came of it.
She heard by a side-wind that the
DAILY DAMA was likely to come over
here. I don't know whether I've
spelled him right; he sounds like a
newspaper, but is really a mixture of
a priest and a king—a delicious
mysterious creature that no one 's
ever had a good look at, and that
rules with a big It, making people
jump over precipices when they 've
offended him, and even sometimes
when they haven't, if he wants
amusing. Oh, and another thing—
his dignity won't allow him to go in
at any sort of gate. Fancy, what a
lovely ideal BERYL, who has a good
bit of influence in a certain official
quarter, got a promise that this sweet
thing should go for a week-end to
Clarges Park, and should pay no
other private visits. (That's just
like BERYL | Her selfishness is
simply horridl)
I don't deny that it would have
been a very big thing if she could
have pulled it off, for, what with the
mystery about him, and the stories
about precipices and never going in
at gates, he would have been the
rage here. But after she'd had the
great Norman gateway removed at
Clarges Park, and about a quarter-
of-a-mile of the park railings, and
made other preparations, she heard
that the dear DAILY DAMA had de-
cided to stay at home in the back of
beyond In the meantime, trippers
had been pouring, through the gap
into Clarges Park, eating fearful
sandwiches all over the place, and
stray animals had established them-
selves there for life, and CLARGEs got
furious and gave BERYL, a piece of
what he calls his mind. She gener-
ously repaid him with a larger piece
of hers; and I shouldn't wonder, my
dear, if it ends in a separation.
I've been bringing forward an
extraordinarily gifted brother and
sister that I discovered last winter
under my patronage, was crammed.
The brother's performance on a large
ivory comb with a peculiar kind of
tissue-paper over it is a thing of
sheer delight; you don't know how
TschAIKowsky and SAINT-SAENS can
sound till you've heard them played
in this way. The sister recites
Nursery Rhymes and gets wonderful
effects out of them. On Saturday,
when she got to the end of Mother
Hubbard, the weirdly realistic bang
of the cupboard docr and the howl of
the disappointed dog fairly brought
down the house, and made some
people feel quite nervy. -
D'you know anything about the
Noumenon, my dear? It's correct
to talk about it, since that sweet

Clackmannan House, “The Noume.

been trying to read those wonderful
books of his, “The Materials of our

looking at it and touching it and

when you've time. And what a
consolation it must be to some people
to know they're not really a bit like
themselves, but are something quite
dif. I There was a regular scrim for
the red rose after the lecture. Your
BLANCHE managed to secure it. The
Professor's not at all old, and, in
spite of being the profoundest thinker
of the age, is quite as good-looking
and well-dressed as if he didn't know
anything. Norty hasn't a good word
for him; says he 's a bore and a
humbug. “That's because you
don't understand him,” I said:
“The Professor lives in a world of
his own.” “Let him stay in it,
then,” said Norty. “It’s a pity he
ever comes out of it into this one.
And what was he doing on the Flip.

Who owns the boon of health and

To keep me in cigars and wine.
Beneath the village chestnut tree
Your brawny arm shall wield the

You'll wind the herd across the lea,
And teach the vicar's children

And soothe at eve your jaded nerves
By fashioning refined preserves.
A country fare shall always please;
Who murmurs for the cates of

When girls with cookery degrees
Can gild the unpretentious

Hurrah for Cool Streams!

WHAT do you think that something

be needed of all who after the town's
oppressive heat can get away into the
country or by the sea?
Think a little.
would it be, perhaps, cooler
clothes? or a fishing-rod 2 or a sturdy
walking-stick? or a patent thick-soled
boot ? or a cricket bat? or a tennis
racquet 2
You are on the wrong tack.
If you think like that it is clear
that you don't understand the

No, the further desideratum is
none of these things, but a box of

You are surprised? That shows
how little you know of modern life.
You don't know that the first thing
to do when you get into the open air
is to light tobacco and taint it.
It is so nevertheless. That is the
new way. -
A holiday without tobacco, espe:
cially tobacco taken in the form of
cigarettes, cannot any longer be a
real holiday.
Pipes, of course, are still smoked
by a few old-fashioned fellows. Cigars
are for the rich. For the great mass
of mankind there is nothing but the
cigarette.
Fill your pockets with them, and
smoke them continually. Don't give
your lungs a chance.
Take them to the Cornish coast,
take them to the Broads, inhale them
on Snowden, chain-smoke them in
the Lakes, puff them all day in the
Solent. This is the way to enjoy a
holiday and come back well.
Of all the solaces of civilisation the
ſag is the very flower.
Remember to ask for White Dog.
And now for a little bonus !
Somewhere in the millions of
White Dog cigarettes that are turned
out daily are a few with an overlap
more than one-eighth of an inch
wide. Anyone detecting one of these
and sending it to the makers will be
presented with 100 cigarettes free.
Don't be discouraged if you don't
spot it at once. Go on buying more
cigarettes till you do. -
That is the way to build up a sound
national constitution.
Far better than camps, with their
brutalising militarism.

surroundings.”
“It isn't their youth I object to,
but their height. I believe you feed
them on gin. I suppose they are
your own, by the way?.”
“Yes, mother bought them this
morning.”
“I am not sure that that was what
I meant; but never mind. . . There
—the captain was the last to leave
the plate.”
“You pig, haven't you left me
anything?”
“I’m sorry, but it's a bad time
of the year for fruit. So my waiter
says. A bit too late for the rhubarb,
and a bit too early for the prunes.''
It was a very hot afternoon. I
leant back in my chair and closed
my eyes. Yes, I almost think I slept.
But not for long.
“Have you been to the Exhibition
yet?” said Miss Middleton, sud-
denly.
“I say,” I remonstrated, “this
isn't a dance.”
“No, but I really wanted to
know.”
“Didn't you notice my French
accent at lunch when I asked you to
pass the banańas?”
“That 's Spanish.”
“Don’t quibble. I said omelette,
too.” -
“Stadium, stadium, stadium,”
said Miss MIDDLETON, “stadii, stadio,
stadio. You ’re not the only one.
Are you in for any of the Olympic
Games 2 ''
“I don’t think so.”
“If I were a man, I should want
to do something for the honour of
England.”
“Why not go in as you are for
throwing the cricket ball? I expect
you 'd win.”
“Can't you run or jump, or any-
thing?”
“Rather. I did over twenty feet
once. In about ten and a-fifth. No,
I'll tell you what I do rather fancy
myself at.”
“What?” asked Miss MIDDLETON,
eagerly.
“Hurling the javelin.”
Miss MIDDLETON got up excitedly
and stepped on to the lawn.
“What do you think of the idea?”
I said.
“But how splendid Of course
I'll help you—I'll mark. What's
your longest javel? Come and show
rne.
“But I only thought of it just
now. And I haven't a javelin or
anything on me. Besides, it's pro-
bably too late to enter now. No, I'm
afraid it 's no good,” I said, and I
closed my eyes again.
“Nonsense. We'll lend you a
javelin,” said Miss Middletox, con.
fidently. “What size do you take?"
4 4 Sevens. Roman numbers, of
course.’’
Miss MIDDLEToN disappeared into
a side door. For the honour of
England I crawled out of my chair
(such a comfortable deck chair) and
went on to the lawn. Also I swung
my arm several times round my
head, and felt my biceps.
Miss Middleton returned with an
armful of stumps.
“I’m so sorry,” she said, “but
we 're right out of javelins, and the
man forgot to call to-day, so will
these do instead? Just for practice."
“Dear, dear, that 's very annoy.

I ought—”
“Oh, please do. Don't say you've

“It's so awkward when you're
used to a full-size court. But

—“I can show you the grip, any.
how.”
“Yes, do show me that,” said
Miss MIDDLEToN.
“You know,” I began, “there
are two styles of holding the javelin
preparatory to the hurl. There's
the Graeco-Roman, with the strangle-
hold barred; and the strict toe-and-
heel , or overlapping grip. The
actual hurling is easy. Slow back
and don't press, get the body well
forward at the beginning of the
stroke, keep the right leg still, heels
up, and discard from great strength."
“See illustration on page 37,” said
Miss MidDLETON.
I took a stump in both hands and
poised it deſtly above my head.
“Poised " I am almost sure is the
word.
“Surely not two hands,” said
Miss MIDDLETON.
I put the stump down again.
“Why not?” I asked in some annoy-
ance.
“I’m sorry; this is the toe-and-
heel grip, I suppose.”
“The Graeco-Roman.’’
“But I thought the Graeco-
Romans always had a shield or *
fishing-net or something in the leſ
hand, so as to ward off the other
man's javelin.”
“This isn't a broadsword match.

“I see. There 'd be plenty of

“One of them jumped 55 feet

“Yes,” said Miss MIDDLETON,
thoughtfully, “that would do it.

I took up the stump, and got posi,

GEORGE is unmarried, and has no

his recreation is assistant horticulture
—such as leading the horse when the
lawns are mowed.
“Not GEORGE; he has a mother.”
“Hang it, everybody has some-
thing. All right, then, no target.”
I lifted up the stump.

DLETON. -
“This is too much,” I said, as I
put it down again. “Am I never to

“I’m very sorry. I just wanted
to ask you—which way is it going?
If it 's backwards there 's the draw-
ing-room window. And mother's in-
side, and she can't jump, at least not
fifty-five feet. Besides the broken
glass.”
I ignored her altogether. I shook
it backwards and forwards three
times, and hurled. . . .
“I’m sorry,” said Miss MIDDLE-
ToN, “I put you off. Do it again.”
“What do you mean, you put me
off 9 ''
“Was that. . . you didn't. . .
I'm—yes, that 's very good. I sup-
pose that must be the record.” She
walked over to the stump. “Thirty
feet almost.”
She picked it up, and threw it care-
lessly. It sailed over a may-tree, and
landed in a bed some miles away.
“Yes; but that 's all wrong,” I
said. “Let me show you again.
There, that was almost forty feet.”
=
Miss MIDDLETON picked it up and
threw it into the bed after the other.
“I don't know anything about
Graeco-Roman,” she said. “The
good old Kentish way is enough for
me. Give me the others. . . There.
And now they 're all over there let 's
play cricket.”
That is so like women. They are
undisciplined, and don't understand
the necessity for rules. If people
were allowed to run about hurling
javelins as they liked, nobody would
ever get disqualified, and there would
be no competition at all. Well, I wash
my hands of the whole thing now.
Miss MIDDLEToN may go on her knees,
but I shall not be found among the
javelin-hurlers in the stadium.
But I may tell you in confidence
that I am a dark horse for tossing the
diskus. I showed Miss MIDDLETON
the grip with the strawberry-plate
afterwards. She agreed that it was
a powerful one. She also said it was
Crown Derby, and what would
mother say? I don't know; but l
have made her promise to tell me.

I THINK it began a year
ago—last June, in fact. I
can’t remember that be-

attention to weddings. If
I heard that a friend was
| to be married I ordered a
pair of silver candlesticks
or a sugar-sifter or a patent

and thought no more about
it. Sometimes, of course,
I had to be present in
person, but I never lingered
over the celebrations. I

I left this unhappy artist, after
expressing my profound sympathy,
and, crossing Piccadilly, entered the

| the well - known trunk - and bag-

engaged in measuring a cigar-box,
fashions for seaside and continent,
and the alteration of costumes to
what Lady GoLIGHTLY, who was in
here just now, called ‘the irredu-
cible minimum,’ has compelled us
to manufacture an enormous stock of
trunks such as you see there, the
largest of which is no bigger than a
dressing-case, and the smallest about
the size of an average work-basket.
If the summer is warm we shall
make little profit; if it is cold, all
this new stock will be thrown on our
hands.”

assuring him of my sympathy, “if

the magnificence of this celebrated

want to skip even that, and perhaps
I ought to have taken it as a warn-
ing. It didn't occur to me, however,
and so matters went on. By the
way, have you ever tried to read a

kind, with a name something like

which are incorporated the Clayfield
Sentinel and The North Stoddington
Advertiser; circulating in every part
of the county. A high-class adver-
tising medium.” It is always a
paper of very extensive acreage, and
as its pages are never cut you end by
getting wrapped up in it from head
to foot. I always did when the ac-
counts of the weddings had been
tucked away in pages 2 or 3 or 6 or 7.
The other pages, of course, are more
getatable.
The real trouble, however, began,
as I said, in June last. I found my-
self obliged to attend three weddings
on three successive days. The first
one (it was in the country) went off
well enough. All I remember about
it is that I stayed to the very end
and threw an old dancing shoe after
them as they drove off. I explained
this to myself by their having pos-
tilions. The second wedding and the
third were in London. I began to
lose my head as soon as I heard
MENDELssoRN's March at the first of
these. It seemed to send the blood
boiling through my veins. JAck
Rogers. who was next me, said,
“Steady, old man; what 's the
matter? You ’re not being married,
you know.” Then he pulled me
down off the seat on which I was
standing, and I knew that something
new and strange was going on inside
‘me. When the bride and bridegroom
walked out I was the first after
them, and I stayed the whole busi-
ness out. Next day it was the same.
On the following morning I had The
Morning Post brought to my bedside.
I picked out two good weddings, and
went to both. I warmly congratu-
lated both bridegrooms. To one I
said, “May a third cousin from
Ceylon offer his best wishes?” To
the other I explained that I was his
wife's aunt's son by a second mar.
riage. They shook me enthusiasti-
cally by the hand. That evening, in
a lucid interval, I realised that I had
got wedding-mania; but I didn’t
mind. I revelled in the thought,
and, far from struggling against it, I
plunged head-first and with my eyes
open into a course of unparalleled
wedding dissipations. I have at-
tended two hundred and fifty wed-
dings in the past year without a
single rebuff. Whenever I read of an
engagement I wire to both parties,
wishing them joy. The detective
who keeps watch over the presents
knows me quite well. So do the two
old ladies who do the weeping as the
bride says Good-bye and kisses her
mother. You thought they were
aunts, but I know better. They've
simply got hymenomania and can't
get on without weddings.
What am I to do about it? Can
any one advise me? I was so
wretched in May, when weddings are
scarce owing to some silly supersti,
tion, that I thought I should have
committed suicide. Would homoe-
opathy help? Globules of orange-
blossom or tabloids of wedding-cake
ought to do the trick; but I can't
make up my mind to try such reme-
dies. I want to go on with my
mania. -

HETTYQUETTE FOR THE
VENERABLE.
THE advantage of the Atlantic
cable and the electric current has
never been better illustrated than by
the fascinating and important mes-
sages which have recently been sent
to the London Press from New York
with reference to the belated activi-
ties of Mrs. HETTY GREEN, the sep-
tuagenarian millionairess, who has
suddenly become a world-power.
Breakfast would not be breakfast
without the latest tidings of this
aged but resolute lady, to whom the
proverb, “It is never too late to
mend or spend,” comes as an
evangel. How she emerged from
her obscure top-floor flat to live at
the toniest New York hotel at a
dollar a breath; how she decided
that the time was ripe to give a
dinner-party, and how one was
arranged for her by the manager at
four guineas a head, exclusive of the
best champagne (whatever that may
be); how she invited a number of
leaders of New York society, irre-
spective of previous intimacy with
them; how, apparently, they came;"
what she wore and what she said as
she watched them eat and drink;
how she went to a six-guinea course
of beauty-renewing, and submitted
her wrinkles to the mercies of the
operator—this and much more has
been flashed along the ocean's bed
for the last week or so, to the no
small amusement of the fish en
route, and to the great satisfaction of
the British newspaper reader anxious
to be well informed on the progress
of the universe.
And truly it is worth transmitting,
for it is fine to see an old woman
ashamed of the economy of her long
life, and resolute in her attempt to
remove the traces of time. Never
was a poet less inspired than that one
who wrote that old age is beautiful,
Old age is, of course, nothing of the
kind, as we now know. The wise
spare no pains to eliminate its signs.
What old modern person would hesi-
tate for a moment if asked to choose
between a face lined by years of life
—years of joy and suffering, laughter
and tears, in a word, experience—and
a face smooth as a billiard ball? A
good complexion is all, no matter
what the vacuity accompanying it.
And therefore we say all honour tº
Mrs. HETTY GREEN for her bold and
public effort to devenerablize. her
countenance and go back on all her
native prudence.
A woman who has lived so long
knows how to spend her money. She
is beyond criticism. She know;
what trust is to be put in stories ºf
the poor and their penury and want;
she knows how much is talk and
how little is fact; and knowing, whº
would dare to blame her if at her
age she spends four guineas a hº
on a banquet to total strangers who
cat a better meal every night? Cer
tainly not we.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
June 1.-Must be admitted that
there is occasionally something infan-
tile about the ways of the House of
Commons. To-day set down for
second reading of Budget Bill. If it
were felt desirable or useful further
to discuss subject here is the chance.
But Tariff Reformers feel they
haven't had a look in lately. About
time they knew, with such approach
to precision as is possible, PRINCE
ARTHUR's latest views on the burning
question. Accordingly amendment
raising fiscal question is clapped on
motion for second reading.
PRINCE ARTHUR's views promptly
indicated by alteration of the amend-
ment as first placed on paper by a
private Member. Now confines itself
to calling upon Government to in-
crease resources of the Exchequer by
‘‘ broadening the basis of taxation.’’
Thus toned down to comfortable note
of vagueness, even ToMMY Bowl Es,
jun., hereditary and unbending advo-
cate of Free Trade, publicly an-
nounces that he can vote for it.
Voicing the desire of his reunited fol-
lowers, PRINCE ARTHUR insists that
one night's sitting is insufficient as a
safety-valve for the seething tide of
passionate conviction that floods
their souls. PREMIER pleads pressure
of public business; finally relents,
“Put me among the Earls,
Put me-e among the Earls!”
(Farewell to the Rt. Hon. George Whiteley,
who resigns his seat and the post of Chief
Ministerial Whip)
The CUTEST TRout in the FISCAL STREAM.
“I’ll make as many bubbles as you like, but I'm not taking any flies, thank you!"
and debate will be continued to-
morrow.
Kno wing these preliminaries,
Fancy fills the benches with a host
of stern foemen. Not an empty seat
on either side. Speeches punctuated
with storm of cheering. Dinner for-
gotten. Amaryllis, accustomed to
be toyed with in the shade of the
Terrace, left in solitude and tears.
Alack-a-day ! what are the facts?
When LAURENCE HARDY rose to move
the amendment majority of those
present with one accord hurried to-
wards the door. Admirable speech
delivered to empty benches. From
this collapse House did not re-
cover till, after dinner and 10
o'clock, LLOYD-GEORGE interposed.
At a quarter-past eight linger-
ing decline almost arrested by
sudden death. Courthope on his
legs addressing nine Members whose
purpose in remaining obviously was
to catch the SPEAKER's eye for the
next turn. A count moved. Bells
clanged; Whips wildly went forth
in search of men to make up a
quorum. The sands in the glass
had fallen. The SPEAKER unselfishly

tured and driven in. As soon as they
were counted and a House made,
they fled full soon (being the first of
June), and bade the rest keep listen-
ing to CourtHoPE as he wended his
By this
way through level agricultural dis-
tricts, lamenting the increase of local
taxation.
'Twas ever thus, SARK testifies.
Nothing so ruinous to vitality of de-
bate as attenuation through being
stretched over two or more days.
What might have been a more or less
brisk discussion had it been confined
to a day's sitting turned out to be
what is here feebly described.
Business done.—Second reading of
Budget Bill moved.
Tuesday.—Debate on Tariff Re-
form amendment to second reading
of Budget Bill resumed. Brisked up
blithely. Members realise that busi-
ness really is beginning. BonAR LAw
opened fire with one of those closely-
reasoned, sharply-pointed, forceful
speeches that confirm his place on
Front Opposition Bench as second
only to his chief as a debater. The
irony of his late Ministerial rank of
Under Secretary as compared with
some colleagues who bear the Cabinet
mark grows sharper as the days pass.
Ex-Ministry not so rich in debating
power that it can afford to repeat a
game which kept John O'Gorst in
the background till he retired from
the scene in disgust.
BonAR LAw's speech the only one
of the brief series that had about it
note of preparation. That inevitable
since he had to lead off, replying
chiefly to LLoyd-GEORGE's stinging

speech that momentarily lifted the
wet blanket weighing down yester-
day's melancholy performance. For
the rest, WINston, PRINCE ARTHUR,
the PREMIER, delivered in succession
purely debating speeches, necessarily
extemporaneous. This the highest
form of art. Also its most successful
exposition. -
Coming to be a common-place to
say that in his last speech WINSTON
excelled himself. Certainly true of
his unpremeditated discourse to-
night. For profound and accurate
knowledge of the science of finance it
was a revelation. WINSTON is so
habitually sprightly in manner, so
ready, upon occasion so reckless, in
speech, that it is (or was) the fashion
to regard him as superficial. After
to-night that reproach may not be
heard.
PRINCE ARTHUR, dexterous as usual
when skating over thin ice of Fiscal
Question. Earlier speakers from
Treasury Bench insisted on enquiry
as to what was the meaning of the
new phrase, more blessed than Meso-
potamia, “broadening the basis of
taxation.” PRINCE ARTHUR not going
to spoil a good thing by explaining it.
Answered the question by asking
another.
“How are you going to get your
ten millions which will be wanted
next year? You have taken a farth-
ing off the Sugar Tax. I suppose
you are going to put it on again.”
PREMIER wound up debate in
fine fighting speech. Caused a
quiver of pained indignation to run
through Opposition ranks by con-
temptuously dismissing the amend-
ment as “a hollow-sounding gene-
rality about broadening the basis of
taxation.” Supposed no one would
refuse to give academic consent to
the proposition that taxation be
broadened. “But what do you
mean by broadening? In which
direction ? '' .
Excitement culminated in the divi-
sion, on which Ministers got a
majority of nearly three to one.
Business done. — Tariff Reform
amendment rejected by 367 votes
against 124; Budget Bill read a
second time. -
Thursday.—Off for a too-brief
holiday. Been reading REGINALD
L U C A s 's “Memoir of Colonel

John MURRAY. Lucas was for a
while Member for Portsmouth; en-
joyed opportunity of knowing SAUN-
DERSON inside the House as well as

gether some memories of a striking
figure that strode the Parliamentary
stage these last twenty years,
SAUNDERSON essentially a fighting
man. When he rose to take part
in debate instinctively drew him-
self up in fighting attitude. De-
lighted in stirring up with long pole
his countrymen in Nationalist
camp immediately opposite. Com-
mented upon them and their con-
duct with freedom no one else
dare practise. They literally howled
resentment; but in their heart
of hearts they kept a place in
which SAUNDERson was enshrined.

(The late Col. Saunderson, M.P.)
Irishman gone wrong. What a
treasure he would have been to the
party had he chanced to be born the
son of a tenant instead of a landlord
In fierce volubility he would have
outshone John DiLLON. For stinging
speech addressed to Chief Secretaries
and the like, he would have beaten
Banagher and TIM HEALY. Fortune
ranged him on the side of the Saxon;
his manner and method of speech
remained racily Irish.
Once in the stormy days of the
Home Rule Bill a Nationalist at-
tempted to win him over by pointing
out how enactment of the measure
would make openings for Irishmen to
come to the front in national affairs.
“A man as popular as you,” he
urged, “is sure to come to the top
of the tree.”
“Yes,’’ said the Colonel, “ hauled
up by a rope round my neck.”
Thus ready were his flashes of wit.
In action he admitted that he was
occasionally precipitate. In the free
fight on the floor of the House of
Commons which enlivened Com-
mittee stage of second Home Rule
Bill, an Irish Member was projected
over SAUNDERson's shoulder on to his
knee. Finding him there convenient
he vigorously punched his head. Sub-
sequently assumption of position
favourable to such action turned out
to be accidental. SAUNDERSON, soul
of honour, felt compelled to explain
to the House that “the hon. gentle-
man who flopped down on top of me
had slipped and arrived there by
accident.’’
All the same, his head had been
punched—an achievement that re-
mained irreparable.
To a House often jaded with ver-
bosity, aweary of the commonplace,
SAUNDERson's interpositions in debate
were like a brisk breeze from his be-
loved sea vivifying a sultry atmo-
sphere. An uncompromising foeman.
a hard hitter, he won, and through
successive Parliaments held, the
position of one of the most popular
members.

THE LOVE SONG.
[It is said that the men of to-day are far less
passionate in their love-making than their
ancestors.]
I LovE you, or at least I think
That very possibly I do;
In common honesty I shrink
From statements not precisely
true,
But still it's safe to say I'm pretty
fond of you.
I cannot swear a mighty oath
To worship blindly till I die,
In fact I should be rather loath
To form so very rash a tie,
Unless I knew a most substantial
- reason why.
I shall not, with a valiant air,
Pour out my life-blood for your
good,
Nor even boastfully declare
That if I had the chance I would,
| Because, to tell the truth, I hardly
think I should.
No knightly deeds have I to do,
And no impassioned words to
say;
Still, I should like to marry you,
If you will tell me that I may,
And also kindly name the most con-
venient day.
I can't explain the thing, you
know
(They used to tell us Love was
blind),
But since it happens to be so
Forgive my weakness, and be
kind,
Or if you're not that way disposed—
well, never mindl

a fine rotundity. Perhaps the char-
acter that went best with the weather
was that of Slender, whose humour
seemed thin to the point of transpar-
ence—no blame to Mr. QUARTERMAINE.
Mr. FISHER WHITE's Shallow was
a most delectable performance; and
Miss CICELY RICHARDs impersonated
Mistress Ford with great naturalness,
laughing as people laugh who simply
can’t help it. Miss ELLEN TERRY, as
the other Merry Wife, entered with
such heartiness into the spirit of her
scenes that her disregard of the exact
letter of them seemed to matter very
little. Indeed, the whole company
played as if they were enjoying the
game, and there were even times
when their merriment threatened to
communicate itself to an audience
(third night) that was dull beyond the
average.
Several pleasant pieces of rough-
and - tumble work, not actually
ordered by the book, were thrown in
gratuitously, and nobody seemed to
be trying to save himself; but then,
of course, they all knew that they
were in for a very short run.
O. S.
THE FIGURE-HEAD OF THE
PRESS.
I WAS about to enter the King's
Cross tube station last Wednesday
morning, when I accidentally knocked
my bag against a man on the foot-
path. I apologised. “Don’t men-
tion it,” he said; then he continued:
“Let's see; 14 a minute for 12 hours
a day is roughly 10,000 a day, isn't
it? With the same number to-mor-
row, and double the number on
Friday, and double again on Satur-
day, that makes 80,000, I think.”
I did not deny it; but I am not
certain in my own mind to this day.
“Then multiply by the ten largest
stations in London, and you get
800,000. ”
“I follow you there,” I said;
tº but—’’
“That 's another 5s. for me,” he
said, with a light in his eye.
He was a quaint little figure, with
a bulging forehead on which his fin-
gers played as he made his calcula-
tions; and a foot-rule stuck out of
one pocket and an exercise book out
of another.
“How does it make 5s. 2'' I asked;
for it seemed to me that 800,000 of
anything should come to more than
that.
Then he told me. He was the
man I have longed to meet—the
man who tells us that the GERMAN
EMPEROR's moustache, if in one long
hair instead of many short ones,
would go five times round the Im-
perial waist, and things like that:
“I make calculations,” he said, “and

each. You see, you are the seventh
person starting on his Whitsuntide
holidays who has passed me in a
minute; probably there were seven
who went into the station at the
other side in the same time. That
gives 14—and you observed how I
calculated the total Whitsuntide
exodus from London.”
“But I am not going away at all-
I am going down to the British
Museum,” I said.
“That doesn't matter; very likely
there were eight on the other side
of the station. Anyway, there is no
need to be particular to one or two
when dealing in thousands. I have
been fearfully busy at the Shepherd's
Bush Exhibition. It took me over
an hour and a-half to measure th:
thousands of miles of electric wiring

tionately). “The 24 miles of road-
way were easier. I had to walk
about a mile in tracing the wiring,
and then feeling that I had not
covered a twentieth of the ground I
soon arrived at the estimate of 24
miles. I found it very difficult to
give with anything like accuracy, the
numbers of people who are thinking
of coming from all parts of the world
—excepting in the case of New Zea-
land, where I had information to
help me, for I heard some months
ago that two friends of my cousin are
likely to come from there.
“Yes, I am very successful. I
don't claim to be infallible, but I
have never had one of my calcula-
tions disputed. I may not always
be right, but I'm hanged if anybody
can prove I'm wrong. That is where
I score.” And the little fellow
chuckled as he wished me good day.
As I came from the Museum at
lunchtime, the placard of an even-
ing paper caught my eye.
“WHITSUNTIDE ExoDUS :
800,000 LEAviNG LoNDoN.”
THE ETON ROSCIUS.
REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENTS.
The cmergence at Eton of a boy
actor, to whose colossal genius the
Headmaster has borne such thrilling
testimony in The Daily Mail, has
created the greatest possible excite-
ment in Maiden Lane and other re-
sorts of the histrionic profession.
Interviewed by Mr. Punch's repre-
sentative in the palatial duomo of
his theatre, Mr. TheE complained in
accents of the most pathetic intona-
tion of the unfair competition which
Eton threatened to exercise with his
Dramatic School. “There are,”
said Mr. TREE, “1,100 boys at Eton,
and I understand that Canon
Lyttelton is confident that, under
the régime which he has now intro-
duced—viz., Delsartean gymnastics,
hypodermic massagé of the cerebel-
lum, Boole-work, Pestalozzian sol-
feggi, and accordeon-pleated hygienic
flannel trousers—he will be able to
turn out at least fifty boys yearly
who are histrionically capable de
tout.” “But,” queried Mr. Punch's
representative, “at least your school
has the common advantage over Eton
that it provides for the instruction of
actresses as well.” “The advan-
tage,” replied Mr. TREE, “will
cease to exist next year, when, as I
have been credibly informed, a Bill
will be introduced into the Commons,
at the express instigation of the
Headmaster, to reorganise Eton on
the basis of co-education, and con-
SceNE IN A LoNELY PART of THE Highl ANDs.
vert it into an annexe of the new
National Theatre, with Mr. Bour-
cIIIER as Director of Dramatic De-
portment.”
Dr. JAEGER, the celebrated sanitary
sartorialist, who courteously received
our representative in his antiseptic
sanctum, expressed the greatest
satisfaction at the new departure.
“Eton is going ahead,” said the
Doctor, “by leaps and bounds, under
the sagacious yet enlightened guid-
ance of the new Headmaster. For-
merly it was a case of ‘great cry and
little wool.” Now it is ‘great cry,
Lyttelton, and all wool.' The hygi-
enic drama has a tremendous future.
And has anyone realised the comic
possibilities of a vegetarian panto-
mime or a sanitary extravaganza?”
Mr. GRAY, the late leader of the
Manch ester unemployed, who
marched to Windsor and addressed
the Eton boys, was naturally de-
lighted by the courageous and en-
gaging venture of the Headmaster.
“No man is fit to be a Socialist, no
mam can touch the great heart of the
people who can't act a bit,” said Mr.
GRAY. “Look at Victor GRAY so N.
Look at me. If I wasn't myself I'd
like to be GEORGE ALEXANDER. Think
of a whole school of GEORGE ALEx-
ANDERs Why, the mere thought of
it is a tonic that tunes up the nation
to concert pitch.”
Mr. MAYER, the impresario respon-
sible for introducing so many French
companies to London, stated that the
situation was radically affected, not
to say bouleversée, by the Etonian
-discovered in the person of the Hon.
prodigy, whose Parisian accent, ac-
cording to the Headmaster, was won-
derfully good. Mr. MAYER added
that he had never seen GARRICK or
Miss Elizabeth Asquith, but from
what the Headmaster said it was
evident that they were not in the
same class with his illustrious pupil.
Mr. FLETCHER, the famous Ameri-
can authority on diet and deglutition,
has cabled his profound satisfaction
with the Headmaster of Eton for
establishing the intimate relation be-
tween digestion and the drama upon
a firm basis. -
Further inquiries at Eton on Satur-
day last revealed the gratifying facts
that CHIRGwin had accepted the
post of Professor of Elocution, and
that houses had been offered to Mr.
FRED KERR, Mr. EDMUND GwenN,
and Mr. WILKIE BARD. It was also
announced that the Headmaster had
PoMERoy BLANDY, a prominent mem-
ber of the eleven, the greatest bass
singer since LABLAche. His voice is
of extraordinary volume, and the
Headmaster stated that he was far
and away the greatest boy bass he
had ever heard. His voice produc-
tion is absolutely perfect, and as
he is one of the driest Dry Bobs ever
turned out at Eton, his future career
will be watched by the Headmaster
and other dispassionate critics with
the keenest interest. As the Head-
master puts it, “If I can produce
only one LABLACHE and one SIMs
REEves every year I shall not have
laboured in vain.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Alien Sisters (SMITH, ELDER) are Ruth Tem-
pleton, daughter of Sir Raymond, and Rose, who takes
the surname of her mother, De Winton. Coincidence,
that dauntless romantic intriguer, has enabled Mrs.
DEARMER to bring them together, and she has further
complicated their relationship by making one the fiancée
and the other the mistress of Hugh Templeton, Sir
Raymond's heir... I was disappointed in Hugh. He
started as the brilliant accomplished scoundrel, for
whom one retains a sneaking affection, but he degene-
rated into a stage-villain, and finally faded out
like a Phlizz. I think he went into Parliament
or something equally dull. But the two heroines (of
whom I prefer Rose) are admirably well defined, and
the scenes which occur in Cornwall and Yorkshire should
-
old pagan ancestor of mine, WULFERCESTER, King of
MERCIA, in the seventh century.”
From such height of ancestry he looked with scorn on
common men. In the course of his reading he found Scott
“ tedious,” JANE AUSTEN “a poor creature,” DickeNs
“frequently but caricature,” BULwÉR Lytton “a
clown,” perhaps the last reproach one would have ex-
pected to hear cast upon him. He employed the same
freedom of expression in reference to certain men and
events in his public and professional life. The result was
that he shocked and disgusted people, being in the end
disbarred, disbenched. For a while the idol of the mob,
then forsaken, he died within a fortnight of his defeat at
the poll in a borough which, immediately after the close
of the Tichborne Trial, had carried him in triumph to the
House of Commons. In its sadness the story reaches
the depths of tragedy.
Mr. Crewe's Career (MAcMILLAN), by WINston
make some of the large pen-
owners in those provinces
look to their preserves.
Then, again, Mrs. DEARMER
gives you a lot of value for
your money: she has put a
whole anthology of quotations
at the beginning of her
chapters, and every now and
then a lady named Monica
Holden goes off to her room
and writes a few philosophi-
cal reflections in her birthday
book, which are very like a
Greek chorus, and almost as
hard to construe unprepared.
I gather from this novel,
what I had long suspected to
be the case, that men, on the
whole, are a bad lot; the
difficulty seems to be that
women are now and then the
same. Considering the awk-
wardness of the problem she
tackles, Mrs. DEARMER is cer-
tainly to be congratulated.
But why does she say (on
page 120), “During the con-
THE LATEST LION.
CHURCHILL, was nearly as
meteoric as the rise of the
other WINston CHURCHILL,
whose life-story still remains
to be written. Perhaps,
when the public demand for
a biography of the English
statesman becomes too in-
sistent to be ignored, the
American author will oblige
by taking on the job. “ The
Career of Winston Churchill,
by WINSTON CHURCHILL,"
should have a fallacious at-
traction for the general. But I
must keep my eyes in the
boat, and return to Mr.
Crewe, which I do with all
the pleasure in the world, for
though I don't much care for
Mr. Crewe himself, and am
as bewildered by the mys-
teries of American State poli-
tics as a Bank Holiday trip-
i. in Hampton Court maze;
ut I do like the spirit of the
book, which is dedicated to
versation dinner had progressed silently to the end "?
Miss ARABELLA KENEALY has performed a filial duty in
preparing the Memoirs of Edward Vaughan Kenealy
(Long). She has been assisted in her task by discovering
among her father's papers several chapters of autobio-
graphy and some pages of diaries. In these Dr.
KENEALY stands exposed with a thoroughness and sim-
plicity which would have been cruel in any other writer.
In an early entry in the diary he heartily prays: “O
God, suffer me not to be prudent.” Never since in-
vocations were first uplifted was prayer so bounteously
answered. KENEALY had in him some flashes of the
divine fire of genius. He was a scholar of rare attain-
ments. Had he only been endowed with a modicum of
common sense he would have been a great man. For
an Irishman he was phenomenally lacking in the sense
of humour. Dominated by superlative vanity, this lack
of a national characteristic was largely responsible for
his gigantic failure. In small affairs it led him to the
conviction, set forth with circumstance, that he was
of royal lineage. In his thirty-sixth year he writes in his
diary, “Walked to Wulfercester's Qastle, built by an
“the men who in every State
of the Union are engaged in the struggle for purer poli-
tics." The real hero, Austen Vane, a young lawyer who
stands as the emblem of that struggle, is a ripper. The
State to which he belongs is run entirely in the interests
of the Imperial railroad, and his father, Hilary Vane, as
the Railroad's chief counsel, has the control of all the
State legislation and all its official patronage. And Austen
happens to love not only his father but also Miss Flint,
the Railroad President's daughter, a no less charming
person than himself. To oppose his father and
Flint, and yet keep the affection of the one and
win the respect and the daughter of the other,
is a fairly stiff proposition. But with the help of Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL he trium, hantly solves it, whereas
Crewe, the sham reformer, comes a cropper, just when
he seems about to step into the Presidential chair. For
this and many other reasons I find Mr. Crewe's Career
a very enjoyable book.
“There is no more ideal house for a ball than Bute Lodge, Regent's
Park. The gardens are close to the Zoo, from whence the roaring of
the lions may be distinctly heard.”—Dumfries Courier.

[JUNE 17, 1908. -
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A vision of FAIR womeN.
Go, wretched scoffer, you who point your thumb
At Woman panting in the Suffrage-chase,
And deem her thirst for votes is due to some
Deficiency of face;
Who've seen her only as a Kodak guy,
In attitudes inimical to charm,
Pendent from area-rails or rumpled by
Robert's coercive arm ;
Go, sirrah, seek the Tube and let your eyes
Gaze on the noblest placard-sheet of all
(Not even “White Man" WALLER occupics
A larger slab of wall);
There you shall find—the catalogue is free—
A gallery of women pioneers
Taken in full repose; and you will be
Surprised, almost to tears.
And on your knees you 'll limp across the line
(Mind the live rail!) and, leaning humble brows
Against the poster, as it were a shrine,
Pay your repentant vows;
And swear that, if they need your moral aid
(Though but a man's) in Hyde or any Park,
For Beauty's cause you'll willingly be made
The object of remark. O. S.
THE HOUSE WITH THE HIGH WALLS.
It was the first house I had come upon for miles; a
high brick wall separated it from the lonely road, but I
could see it through a pair of rusty scroll-work gates—
a large gloomy old mansion, with projecting wings. An
elderly gardener was mowing the neglected grass-plot
in the centre of the drive, and on this plot stood a large
board. I could not read what was on it from the bank
on the other side of the road, and I felt much too
lazy just then to get up and go near enough to do so.
For it was a sultry afternoon, I had had a long tramp,
and was glad to find a shady tree under which I could
lie down and rest for a while. But I had not lain there
long before I saw that the old man had come through
the gate and crossed the road. -
“I observe, sir,” he said, addressing me, “that you
are looking at this Institution. I am the Superintendent,
and I shall be pleased to take you over it and show you
the inmates, if you will allow me.’’
He was still carrying his scythe, but he had a vener-
able white beard, and, even before he spoke, I knew
that he could not be the gardener. I thanked him and
explained that I had not time just then to accept his
offer.
“Nonsense,” he said peremptorily ; “ you had much
better come—it will be a useful experience for a
professional humourist like yourself.”
I never quite like being called a professional humourist
—it seems to imply a certain reproach. But, after all, it
happens to be the way I earn my living, so I couldn't
very well resent it, though I had not supposed I bore
the stamp of my calling so visibly upon me. And some-
how I yielded and found myself inside the gates with
him on the drive.
“It is a Private Asylum, I suppose?” I said.
“Hardly that,” he replied, “though it is true that
some of my patients—but we prefer to call it a Retreat,
a kind of Convalescent Home.’’
“For whom ? '' I enquired. --------
“You have eyes,” he said somewhat impatiently.
“Why don't you look at the board there?” I looked
and read this inscription :- -
Home of Rest For Aged on DESTITUTE Jokes.
(Supported entirely by Voluntary Contributions.)
You may imagine I was surprised, but I was not. I
had often wondered where all the old jokes went to.
Now I knew. I followed my guide through a dinn old
hall, and out upon a terrace at the back, overlooking
spacious grounds surrounded by fine trees—mostly chest-
nuts, as, indeed, one might have expected. -
“You will find most of them here,” he said. And there
they were-jokes of all ages in every stage of poverty,
sitting listlessly in the shade or crawling feebly about in
the sun, like so many belated November blue-bottles. I
cannot describe their appearance more precisely; but
most people recognise an old joke when they come across
one. And so did I. The rest I must leave to your
imagination, merely remarking that I have seldom seen
a more pathetic spectacle. Many of them, poor as they
secned now, had, so my conductor informed me, enter-
taired Saxon earls, Norman nobles, and barons, and
even Tudor monarchs in their time, for they were rich
jokes in those days. But, like all favourites, they had
allowed themselves to grow too familiar; and a joke that
once forgets itself is naturally soon forgotten. Though it
seemed that even the oldest of these had a chance of
coming into their own again, for I was told that a
popular music-hall comedian had generously undertaken
to find employment for several of them in one of his
new “turns.” -
“Perhaps,” suggested my informant, “ you yourself
might be disposed to 2 ” But I got out of that by
asking him who were the creatures like uncouth over-
grown lads who were languidly chasing one another
about the grounds with a ghastly affectation of gaiety.
“Street jokes,” he explained; “their day is over, poor
things, though they don't know it. They will never go
outside these walls any more.”
Now I came to look at them I found I knew several
quite well. There were, “How 's your poor feet?”,
“I’ll 'ave your 'at l”, little “Woa, EMMA,” and “Get
your 'air cut,’’ and many others I had missed for years.
I thought they were dead—however, they might just as
well have been. -
“But now,” said the proprietor, “let me show you
some cases which I don't despair of restoring to public
usefulness yet. You see that one lying face downwards
on the lawn 2 Well, it was brought out by a nervous
man at a stiff dinner-party, and fell perfectly flat. But
with ordinary care and encouragement you would be
surprised to find how well it would go. Now don't you
think you could ?'' I explained that, being of a
nervous temperament myself, I really could not under-
take the responsibility.
“Ah, well,” he said, “here is another—a most excel-
lent joke. It came out quite unexpectedly from the
Bench only the other day. I forget if it was in a Police
Court or a Law Court—but one of the two. Unfortu-
nately no one saw it—not even the constable or usher—
and so it never got into any of the papers. A failure at
present—but it only requires another chance.”
It was a good joke, but unfortunately, as I pointed
out, quite unsuited to my particular purposes. Too
subtle.
“Then how about this one?” he persisted, indicating
a hydrocephalous-looking little thing that was strutting

into Punch, and it has been considered quite good
enough to do so by a parent whose standard of humour
is so high that very few jokes have ever really amused
him. I thought if you happened to know the

I did know the Editor, and I intimated very decidedly
that I could not dream of introducing such a joke as that
to him : it would be as much as my place was worth.
“You are the best judge, of course,” he said stiffly.
“Perhaps you would prefer to adopt an anecdote :
That one over there in the corner has been attributed to
many of our most celebrated wits. Swift, SHERIDAN,
CHARLEs LAMB, THEoDoRE Hook, SYDNEY SMITH have
all had to bear the responsibility for it in their time
—so surely you need not be ashamed of it. It has
been an orphan for years now, so a fresh career is open
to it.’’
That might be; but I excused myself. I could never
feel any real pride in fathering so aged an anecdote. The
Medical Superintendent still went on pressing me. Of
course from his point of view he was quite justified in
trying to find suitable openings for his various charges;
but my patience became exhausted at last.
“I don't think you quite understand,” I told him,
with quiet dignity. “These old jokes—whatever their
merits—are really of no use in my kind of work. I may
be a professional humourist, but I flatter myself that my
jokes, such as they are ''-(this was irony, not modesty,
, for, between ourselves, I was far from being ashamed of
them)—“are at least my own. So I will take up no
more of your valuable time.”
He seemed to feel the rebuke, for he led me back into
the hall without a word. There he stopped at a door.
“I have no more to show you,” he said, “unless you
would care to see the cases in here. They are not
particularly interesting—quite too hopelessly imbecile to
be at large. I should not venture to suggest your
adopting any of them.”
I looked in, simply to oblige him, as he appeared to
wish it. And the next moment I fled from that grim
house in horror, for the inane idiotic jokes I had seen in
that chamber of oblivion were mine—all, all mine ! And,
bitterest blow of all, they were those I had considered
my very best -
I found myself lying on the bank once more, with
the old man's malicious laughter, as he bowed me
out, still ringing in my ears. Presently, pulling myself
together, I rose and went to the old gates to have
another iook at that board. But all I read was, “This
Desirable Mansion To Be Let or Sold.” The elderly
gardener (whose beard, I now saw, was not so very long)
was still mowing.
“’Ad a tidy ole nap over theer, eh, Mister?” he said,
with a senile chuckle. “I 'ope it 's done ye good, I'm
sure " '' . -
I suppose it had ; but, all the same, a dream of that
sort is a little unfair on a professional humourist. So
disheartening ! F. A.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAN IN THE FRONT ROW.
AT first I said, “It is a coinci-
dence.” He was a three-shilling
ticket-holder at Hither Green on
Tuesday—a “front row ’’ at West
Kensington (I was giving my humor-
ous and dramatic entertainment) on
Wednesday—“a reserved and num-
bered '' at Harrow-on-the-Hill on
Friday. -
Then I discovered him behind a
bank of palms at Basingstoke.
“There is more in this than meets
the eye,” I said. “He is doing it
for a wager.’’
But at Bishop's Stortford and
Potter's Bar he led the applause. .
Now if he were really doing it for a
wager he would look grim and deter-
mined—he would, in short, show
that he was performing a feat of en-
durance. Instead of which he en-
cored my “Village Concert.” The
“wager '' hypothesis fell to the
ground.
“There must exist between us an
unaccountable psychologic correla-
tion,” I told myself. “Perhaps in a
former state of existence we may
have been corner men in the same
minstrel troupe, and conceived a
mutual passion for one another's
jokes.”
After this I began to look out for
him. Each evening, before com-
mencing my performance, I would
cast one reassuring glance along the
front row. He never failed me. Of
course it was gratifying to know that
one out of those mildly-applauding
hundreds had paid his two-and-six,
not out of charity, not because the
Dramatic Society's secretary hap-
pened to be her brother, but solely
to see and hear me. Still I often
thought I could have managed my
entertainment better (the jokes, espe-
cially) were he, let us say, in the
shilling seats. It was like this. I
open up with desultory attack on
piano. Applause—in three places.
I bow and thank audience effusively.
Iłoars of laughter. So far—good |
Now I leave the music-stool and step
towards the Winter Gardens, very
carefully polishing my monocle. This
creates the atmosphere necessary for
my “cab-horse " story. “By the
way,” I begin, and the Man in the
Front Row takes out his handker-
chief, “ as I was driving here to-
night '' (he is chuckling) “I had
rather a curious '' And there is
that silly idiot roaring with laughter.
My cab-horse story is a miserable
fiasco. I start another. Halfway
through, just when the shilling seats
are beginning to sniff the air, I catch
sight of
_-
THE NEW “SPOONERISM.”
“I say, what's The USUAL TAx For A Tipsy cAB 2"
Have you, dear reader, ever told
the same joke to the same man
thirty-five times? The first day you
start off in the pink of condition, and
let him have it twice on the way to
the station. Second day you run
over the main points in the City and
again at the club. Third day, ring
him up on the telephone, and fire it
off three times in rapid succession
before the girl at the Exchange
realises the situation. Fourth day,
take him for a long country walk,
feel in your pocket for the bottle of
chloroform, and—this will make
eight times. You will now begin to
realise my feelings.
After his hundredth appearance I
decided to cut out the “Village Con-
cert " from my repertoire, There
were parts—the curate's comic song,
for instance—that I simply loathed.
Besides, when a man has heard the
same thing fifty or sixty times
After the elimination of this popu-
lar feature, my engagements fell off,
and we did not see quite so much of
one another. Sometimes I ‘‘ rested ''
for half a week. This gave him a
rest, too, during which he seemed
to gather fresh energy.
Before my hundred - and - fiftieth
performance came round I said,
“Something must be done.” I was
growing nervous and absent-minded.
Quite frequently I would begin a
story and forget the finish.
Should I denounce him to the audi-
ence one night? Hang it all, in these
days of confederates “in front " they

would think it part of my show.
They would expect him to jump up
and request me to “Come back to
your home in Baltimore.” If only I
could prevail on his good nature to
stop away every other performance.
When I broached the subject he
said he couldn't hear of it. He had
grown so used to my entertainments
that he couldn't—he simply couldn't
-—live without them.
One night (his 189th) he had the
front row all to himself.
He wanted three hundred down. I
offered him a pound a week for life.
(I think my “Village Concert " had
told on his health rather.) He
accepted. Said he was going to settle
down in the country, and write an-
c ther of the “ Secrets of Success ''
series.

GILDING THE GOLDEN DOME.
(With compliments to “The Daily Mail.")
Won DERFUL as is the whole con-
geries of “ cloud-capped towers and
gorgeous palaces '' that enchant the
eye at the White City, no visitor who
is asked his opinion as to the most
ravishing spot in the whole exhibition
can hesitate for a moment in making
his award. One and all plump
immediately for the Golden Dome of
the Dairy Pail Butter-nut Factory.
From dawn to eve hundreds of
millions of fascinated spectators
crowd to watch the revolving arms of
the indefatigable machine as it
churns the yellow paste, mingles it
with refined sugar, and pulls it into
that luscious compound which has
cemented our mighty Empire and
glutinized the Entente Cordiale itself.
All the milk is produced by the
Dairy Pail's exclusive cows, and
imported at prodigious cost from the
Dairy Pail Model Farm : whilst the
sugar is the most exquisite creation
that can be distilled from the maples
of Canada, the canes of the West
Indies and the beetroot of France.
No exhibit, not even the dancing-
saloon of the Senegalese village, has
achieved so instant and so signal a
triumph as the Golden Dome.
Prisoners in Wormwood Scrubbs
catch a glimpse of it and find their
lot endurable; and from a host of
rapturous testimonials we cull the
following :- -
MR. It's TACE MILEs. -- “Your
butter-nuts are more sustaining than
my nut-butter.”
THE DUKE of ARGYLL :--
“From Paris to Perth,
Where'er you may roam,
There 's no place on earth.
Like the Dairy Pail Dome.”
SIR THOMAS LIPTON.—“Incompar-
able. If I had not already called my
last yacht Shamrock XIV, I should
have named it. Butter-nut I.’” -
SIGNOR GINISTRELLI.—“The Dome,
in point of majesty . . . reminds me
of St. Peter's.”
MR. IMRE KIRALFY.—“Butter and
butter.’’
NEW SITES FOR OLD
I,ANDMARKS.
FIRED by the noble example of
Mr. CROKER, who proposes to bring
over the Temple of Philae and set
it up in Central Park, New York,
it is rumoured that Signor GINIs-
TRELLI has determined to com-
memorate his double victory on the
British Turf in such a manner as to
bind England and Italy in indis-
soluble bonds of friendship. The
Signor's scheme has a massive sim-
plicity which is all its own. - It is to
effect a bodily transference of the
ancient Coliseum to London, and
simultaneously to transport the well-
known London music-hall of the
same name to the vacant site in the
Eternal City. There are, Signor
GINISTRELLI frankly admits, con-
siderable difficulties in the way, but
with the tactful assistance of
Professor WALDSTEIN and Mr.
Oswald STOLL he is sanguine of
overcoming them. Meantime the
inhabitants of Saffron Hill are
unanimous in their enthusiastic sup-
port of the project. Mr. HALL CAINE,
we understand, approves of the idea
subject to certain modifications, the
most interesting of which is that the
Roman Coliseum should be re-
erected in the Isle of Man, in which
case he is prepared to offer Greeba
Castle to London to fill the gap
caused by the removal of Mr.
STOLL's palazzo.
Mr. HENRY J. Wood, long re-
nowned for his exertions in pro-
moting and maintaining friendly
relations between England and
Russia, has put forward an admir-
able plan for furthering this laud-
able aim. He proposes that a
Mansion House Fund should be
started to raise subscriptions for the
purchase of the Great Bell of
Moscow, with a view to its being
permanently installed in Printing
House Square under the auspices
and protection of its illustrious
namesake. Sir l)ox ALD MACKENziE
WALLACE, cordially supports the
scheme, but we regret to learn that
The Daily News considers it in the
light of an unwarrantable concession
to Grand-Ducal obscurantism.
The absence of any monumental
architecture in Battersea Park has
long exercised the teeming brain of
that illustrious necro-archaeologist
Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton. But the
enterprise of Mr. CROKER has now in-
spired him with a really noble plan
to remedy this crying need. This is
nothing less than the removal of the
Pyramids and the Sphinx from
Egypt to decorate and embellish the
popular transpontine playground. Sir
ELDoN GoRST is giving his most
careful consideration to the scheme,
which is viewed with the greatest
favour by the members of the Cairo
Golf Club, who have long resented
the presence of the Pyramids as a
most unsightly eyesore as well as an
unfair hazard on their links.
Canon Lyttelton, the Head-
master of Eton, writes : —“The
theatre of Dionysus at Athens could
contain 30,000 spectators, and that
at Megalopolis 44,000. These facts
are vouched for by the high
authority of Haydn's Dictionary of
Dates, and yet, to our eternal
shame, Eton, which now boasts the
greatest boy actor in the world, pos-
sesses no theatre comparable to
those in which the ancient Greeks
exhibited their crude and negligible
talents. As Eton is not only the
largest but the richest public school
in the world, it is surely not too
much to ask of her alumni that they
should raise funds for purchasing the
Théâtre Français and re-erecting it
on the Playing Fields. Such a
scheme would not only promote the
Entente Cordiale, but stimulate the
genius of a young Colleger named
BILLINGTON-Duck in whom I have
recently discovered a dramatic swan
of the first magnitude—in short, a
prodigy combining and eclipsing the
best qualities of ARIstoPHANES,
MoLièRE, SHAKSPEARE and SHERIDAN.”
The most exciting and picturesque
outcome of Mr. CROKER's action,
however, is the sporting suggestion
of Sir ARTHUR CoNAN Doyle to
enhance the glory of the Primrose
League and simultaneously add a
conspicuous feature to the London
landscape by superimposing the
Peak of Teneriffe on Primrose Hill.
As the famous novelist justly says:
“The resources of modern engineer-
ing are fully equal to the task. It
is only a matter of expense, and if
only the support of the Women
Suffragists, the Socialist members
and the Irish Nationalists can be

secured, I am convinced that Mr.
Asquith will throw himself heart
and soul into the movement. The
Peak of Teneriffe is only 12,200 feet
high, or little more than twelve
times the height of the Eiffel Tower,
and its removal from the Canary
Islands would not impair the com-
mercial stability of that archipelago.”
A SIGN OF THE TIMES.
THE “EveRY Word '' SERIES.
MR. John STRONG begs to announce
a new series of stirring novels, which
will be inaugurated by a story of
powerful emotional interest by the
leading lady novelist of the English-
speaking world—
INTERIA DROSS,
author of the sultriest books of our
time. INTERIA DRoss in her forth-
coming novel,
“NAKED YET UNASHAMED,”
handles with the utmost skill a
topic of the profoundest interest to
all students of morbid pathology.
All the wealth of language, the
romantic fervour, the rich imagina-
tion that she is possessed of, INTERIA
DRoss has cheerfully devoted to per-
fecting this great book, not a line of
which will it be safe for the prurient
reader to skip.
It is advisable to order at once, as
an enormous popular demand for
Naked but Umashamed is confidently
anticipated.
The second volume in the “Every
Word ” series (so-called from the
necessity to keep the eye glued to the
page for fear of losing anything pecu-
liarly nasty) is a new story by that
very popular writer HERBERT EELs,
famous for his sensational novel,
“THE BAD YOLK.”
In his forthcoming romance, which
is dedicated to the Sanitary Inspectors
and Sewage Boards of England in
a charming sonnet, Mr. EELs sur-
passes himself. Nothing more sug-
gestive has ever been written in
English for popular consumption,
and so urgent and powerful are some
of the episodes that it has been
thought advisable to bind the work
in asbestos covers. The title is
“ UNCLE OR WIDOW 9 ''
and a first edition of 100,000 copies
is already exhausted.
The third volume in the “Every
Word ' ' series is
“A WOMAN INDEED,”
By PAUL SculbulderY.
In this novel will be found the
remorseless yet tender dissection of
a woman by a new writer of aston-
ishing gifts and grip. Certain
matters never mentioned in polite
society are here treated with the
utmost delicacy consonant with per-
fect frankness.
Mr. John STRONG also has much
pleasure in announcing
“AFTER DINNER STORIES,”
being the reminiscences of a well-
known vieux marcheur whose name
is kept secret for obvious reasons. A
hundred furtive grins to every
chapter; and there are eighty-five
chapters. The volume makes a
capital present for boys. -

FATHER WAUGHAN TUPPER'S GREAT
SERMoN.
WE have been fortunate in obtain-
ing the manuscript of the searching
and vivid sermon on “Marriage:
Its Trials, Failures, and Triumphs,”
delivered by that inspired yet caustic
observer of modern life, Father
VAUGHAN TUPPER, at the head-
quarters of the Mayfair Roman
Catholics on Sunday. We print his
scathing remarks and profoundly
shrewd counsels just as they issued
from his lips, but the readers of cold
type necessarily lose the fire and
spirit of this great and original
preacher—his fervour, his sarcasm,
his irony.
“Marriage is a lottery. I say it
with all caution after hours of
thought on the matter. Marriage is
a lottery. You may get a good wife,
you may not; and (here I address
myself to the ladies), you may get
a good husband, you may not. Yes,
my friends, marriage is a lottery. A
lottery.
“When a man goes forth to get
a wife he should be guided by good
sense. He should not choose a
showy, flighty, smoking-room girl,
but one whom he can admire and
respect. If she is beautiful so much
the better; but probably he will think
her beautiful, and that will do as
well. -
“I will not say that the man is the
superior, or the woman the superior.
In every case time will show.
-:
“Men and women are so different
that there are almost certain to be
moments when they disagree. The
fewer and the briefer are these
periods of disagreement the happier
is the marriage. I say it deliberately
—the fewer and the briefer are these
periods of disagreement the happier
is the marriage.
“Nothing can so assist the hus-
band and wife as good advice. Let
me give you some. I am full of it.
Also I am by my office a bachelor,
and therefore the best judge.
“To the husband I would say: Do
not interrupt your wife and say sar-
castic things to her. Let her talk
on. Give her sympathy. Give her
ornaments and clothes, if you can
afford them. Love her. Be kind
to her.
“To the wife I would say: Don't
mag. Don't scold. Don't cry. That
husbands dislike tears is a truth that
has been borne in upon me. Never
mind what other people say, but
take it from me that husbands dislike
tears. Don't keep a bad cook.
Husbands like good dinners. Were
I, in fact, to speak in a more vulgar
phrase, I might say, at the risk of
shocking you by my originality and
homeliness, feed the brute. Dress
well. Do not be slovenly. See that
the house is well kept.
“To put the "... matter briefly,
I should say to husbands: Hus-
bands, do not do anything to annoy
or disappoint or alienate your wives;
and to the wives, Wives, do not lose
your husbands' love.
“Only thus can there be happy
marriages.”

Score were a score, however small,

Should let no fierce expletives
fall—
I shouldn't swear.
But as I didn't get a ball

And as my partner didn't call;
And as the umpire told a lie;

on the estates, about 10,000, or 7 per cent, are
indentured men.”—Overseas Daily Mail.
As the writer reasonably said, when
the editor protested: “What's the
good of the first 7... if it doesn't
come in the answer?”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtraCTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Wednesday,
June 10.—-Commons resumed sit-
tings after Whitsun Recess. Lords,
exhausted with labours which, com-
mencing at 4.30 in the afternoon,
have been known to continue up
to 4.45, reasonably extend their
holiday.
No unseemly rush for places.
Majority of Ministers and ex-
Ministers, for once in unity, defer
arrival on scene. Example loyally
followed above and below gangway.
RUTHERFord raising in Committee
of Supply question of wages of Pre-
ventive force was supported on
Unionist benches by presence of
two members. In other parts of
House crowd not much denser.
Anxious time for the new Minis-
terial Whip, who formally enters on
his duties to-day. Would never do
to begin career with count-out on a
Government night when progress
with Supply is confidently reckoned
ors. Happily “JAck" PEASE (so-
called because he was christened
Joseph) is popular on both sides; no
one disposed to play pranks at his
expense.
The NEw Whip of The MINISTERIAL PACK.
(Mr. Jack Pease.)
Has had considerable experience in
the office. Served eight years in the
wilderness as Junior Opposition
Whip, not dreaming of a time when
he would day after day come up to
table to announce overwhelming
Ministerial majorities with ACLAND-
Hood, long familiar with the practice,
relegated to second position on his
left hand. C.-B. coming in made
him Junior Lord of the Treasury
serving as second Whip. Now, still
on the sunny side of fifty, he fills
the onerous and important post of
chief Whip, a well-earned tribute to
trained capacity and modest mien.
Business done.—Quite a lot. Over
two million sterling voted in Com-
mittee of supply, and Members got
off shortly after six o'clock.
Friday.—Is whammeling legal?
This the question the PRIME
MINISTER finds facing him on return-
ing to Westminster. MoLTENo pre-
sents it, calling upon him to intro-
duce at an early date “a Bill for the
reform of the Fishery Law dealing
with the Solway Firth, making it
clear that whammeling is legal.”
Asquith, conscious of being al-
ready overburdened, surmises that
for the strained back of his
Government whammeling would be
DioGENES John.
The Rt. Hon. John Burns delivers (at Ealing) another of his racy straight-talks to Englishmen
the last straw. Still, feels it un-
desirable to flout Scotland, where
of late the course of by-elec-
tions has been pleasantly modified.
Explains to MoLTENo that case is
environed by peculiar difficulties. In
the first place, one-half of the
Cabinet does not know what wham-
meling means. CREw E believes it is
a fish sauce, and would like CAR-
RINGTON to sample it first. BIRRELL
suspects it is a Scottish form of
cattle driving; whilst McKENNA, new
to his post, is not quite certain, but
fancies it is part of a battleship—
like a transom, for example.
That the least difficult part of
situation. The other half of the
Cabinet, taking very strong views
on the subject, finds itself hope-
lessly divided. Compared with the
discord, secret or avowed, born of
Home Rule or the Education ques-
tion, whammeling is almost demoniac
in its influence among esteemed
colleagues. If a Bill were intro-
duced, it would certainly lead to
split in the Cabinet. In view of
importance of remaining in office
long enough to bring in a Reform
Bill and clip Unionist opportunity by
abolishing plural voting, that would,
the PREMIER thinks, be unpatriotic.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN PRAISE OF A DOG.
IT has recently been my misfortune to lose one of the
best friends that any man could hope to have. This
was Rufus, a brown spaniel, who for more than fourteen
years has shared my lot, making it pleasant with his
faithful and unquestioning affection. Some years ago
in these columns I recorded his living virtues in verse.
It seems fitting, now that he has taken his place among
the shadowy hounds who await their masters by
Charon's farther landing-place, that I should dedicate
a few words of prose to his memory.
I saw him first nearly fifteen years ago. He was
then, at a guess, something more than two years old, a
full-grown dog, very lively, very vigorous and very
impulsive in the pursuit of sport. His residence at that
time was a kennel, to which he was attached by a
detested and circumscribing chain, and my first memory
recalls him as he pranced and pirouetted on the approach
of his owner, barking in anticipation of his release and
winding himself more and more hopelessly in his
shackles. After the
highly the greatness and the virtues of the beloved
master whose shadow he wished to be. With ladies
his behaviour showed a tolerant but blundering defer-
ence. Though he never failed to couch himself upon
the skirts of their dresses—and he did this with a par.
ticular insistence when he was very wet and muddy—he
never admitted them fully to the recesses of his friend.
ship. There seemed to be a natural antipathy between
their orderly tempers and the animal spirits that
prompted him to upset small tables and to disarrange
rugs. Often, though he might be guiltless of wrong, he
assumed a stubborn hang-dog air at the mere sight of a
woman. As for children, he was firmly convinced that
they were a sort of dog with whom jealousy was out of
place. He would spend hours in gambolling with them,
but he never stooped to obey their orders.
As he advanced in age and lost his abundant vigour he
seemed to grow even more faithful and affectionate to
the one man whom his heart had chosen as being suited
for esteem and loyalty. It became a misery to him to
be deprived of his master's presence, and until I returned
to him he suffered life
first mad excitement
of his liberty, and
after hurling himself
frantically against the
legs of everyone
present, he began to
cool down and pre-
pare himself for the
duties of the day.
He was solemnly
bent on business, but
now and then, as we
marched to our place
for the first partridge
drive, he would spare
a moment for the
m a king of friend-
ships with those
who m he accom-
rather than enjoyed
it. His eyes lost
their brightness with
the years; he became
very deaf, but he
knew the hand of his
master, and his
| stumpy tail wagged
frantically when that
hand was placed *
his head.
His final illness
was mercifully short,
and he was soothed
and cheered to the
last by those whom
he had never wil.
lingly offended, and,
not least, by the
!
panied. During the
drive he stood solidly
e no u g h at his
owner's heels. When
it was over he -
launched himself like a furry thunderbolt into the
surrounding country and collected, not merely those
birds that might justly be considered his own, but all
the rest that came within range of his nose. These he
stacked in a feathered pyramid close to his owner, and
then, panting but triumphant, sat down beside them,
and glared and growled at any rash stranger who,
deluded by his former advances, presumed to come
too near him. It was this combination of a ridiculous
ferocity with an almost furious good nature that
attracted me to him. I struck a bargain with his owner,
and not long afterwards Rufus became an inmate of my
house.
From that moment he knew no more of chains and
kennels. He had the range of the rooms and the
garden in unrestricted freedom. I think he appreciated
the change. Somewhere in his doggy heart he knew

With shouting boastfully of what she 's done;

NEXT time I go to Devonshire I shall expect to see
cottages placarded somewhat to the following effect:
“Notice to authors. Fishing among these peasants is
strictly preserved. Apply to Mr. EDEN PHILLPOTTs.”
Otherwise two Devonshire novels will appear simulta-
neously some fine day, with exactly the same characters
and stories in them, and then there will be a row. But
there must always be a welcome for a book by Miss
WILLcocks. A Man of Genius (JoiiN LANE) deals with
the old conflict between the intellectual and the more
earthly types of love, and it is a very fine book on the
psychological side. But if anything it is even finer
Devonshire. There is never a trace of unreality in the
speeches and emotions of
to War, the Quaker ladies that I have the pleasure of
knowing seem to me to dress and talk and eat and drink
very much like ordinary folk. Dean's Hall (MURRAy)
takes us back to the days when they believed in the
powers of witchcraft and looked upon ribbons and laces
and laughter and other such fripperies as the invention
of the devil. Those were stern times, when a reputed
witch could expect little mercy at the hands of our rude
forefathers, even if they belonged to the Established
Church, and still less in a community consisting chiefly
of small Quaker farmers. In the particular dale which
is the scene of Miss MAUDE Gold RING's story lived an
unfortunate wise woman who, chiefly because of her
skill in the use of simples, was looked upon with super.
stitious dislike by the Society of Friends as the author
of all their little misfortunes. If their children or their
cattle fell ill, or their young men and maidens were so
Thyrza, the country girl who
becomes the wife of Ambrose
Velly, architect. Ambrose is
also loved by Damaris West-
away, the Rector's daughter,
an idealist, who gives him up
because she finds out that her
rival has established the one
insuperable claim. After-
wards Ambrose sees the
mistake of his choice, and
Th yr 2 a , overhearing his
avowal of it, runs away; but
Damaris comes to the rescue,
and the wife returns to her
husband. Miss WILLCocks’s
methods are philosophical and
poetical by turns, but the
realism of her dialogues never
suffers at all. There is no
excuse for not reading A Man
of Genius and making a short
stay in the “seventh Devon
of delight.”
Mad a m e ALBANESI calls
Drusilla's Point of View
(HURST and BLACKETT) “a
little story of love,” and I
congratulate her not only on
the book but also on her
description of it. Most of - -
the characters in this modest, rather old-fashioned
novel are rich, amiable people, and there is nothing
alarming about the “point of view.” Drusilla, I feel
sure, had never heard of Women's Rights, for the only
one she insisted upon was the right to flirt, and that
she exercised widely. At first, when I found Brian
Keston arranging a priceless library, my mind flew
back to Miss SINCLAIR's The Divine Fire, and I began to
wonder if we were to have another young librarian as a
hero. But Keston develops in a way which is scarcely
heroic: he was altogether too patient, and would have
been more interesting if he had occasionally lost his
temper. Madame ALBANESI has succeeded in getting a
flavour of comfort into her book, and Lord Carlingford is
the most human nobleman I have discovered lately in
fiction. Although she writes of millions, she treats
wealth with an easy hand that leaves no thumb-mark of
vulgarity.

abandoned as to fall in love
with anyone outside the
charmed circle of their own
faith, it was always because
they had been “overlooked"
by the witch, and at last, in
a fit of frenzied fanaticism,
they rose up and drowned her.
That is the darker side of the
life described by Miss Gold:
RING, the contemplation of
which was, in my own case,
considerably brightened by a
| complacent feeling of my
superiority to these “bygone
worthies of a purblind age."
I don't burn witches. I pay
them a guinea to tell my for-
tune. Others, less pharisaic:
ally inclined than I, will find
the requisite relief in the
rather sad but happily-ending
love-story which is skilfully
blended with this dramatic
account, based on fact, of the
Wise Woman of Littondale.
Mr. GEORGE ADE's The
Slim Princess (GAY and HAN-
cock) may be good enough for
American consumption, but

is a patriot. He supplies the newest slang for the
teeming millions of the States. Those picturesque turns
of phrase which fall with such apparent spontaneity
from the lips of his countrymen in our midst, and add so
rich and exotic a colour to our insular existence, are his
invention, the work of patient hours beneath the mid-
night lamp. But in any other language his humour, Is
not of the highest. His story, for which he has found a
capital motive in the traditions of an Oriental country
where adipose deposit is the measure of female charm, is
dull enough reading till he introduces a young Americal
trained in the author's own school of diction. Then it
becomes passably funny for those who care about that
kind of thing. -
I should of course be sorry to underrate the virtuº
of American slang. It is the poetry of a pioneer ra".
the medium in which a fresh ingenuous imaginatiº"
elects to become articulate. But the best humour, likº
the best poetry, does not need to depend upon loca
tricks of speech or imagery.

THE SPEECHMAKER.
LoRD of War! what an age has passed
Since this writer addressed you last,
You that of old in your manly prime
Stopped the gaps of my starveling rhyme,
Furnishing copy, week by week,
Drawn from your fancy's latest freak.
I may have cooled my early zest -
And given my WILLIAM a well-earned rest,
But you have the same unwearied rage
For bounding about the comic stage,
Staggering Europe's torpid brain
With a “Hoch l’’ and a “Here we are again!”
Rumour revives those brave old tags
Culled from your lips by local rags,
Threats that you drop with your chin out-thrust,
In the course of unveiling a forbear's bust—
Hints for a mess or a guards' parade,
Like “Let 'em all come ! ” and “Who 's afraid 2 ”
These I explain, to a large extent,
By atmospheric environment—
The bellicose air of grandpa's bust,
The Marcobrunner's inspiring crust,-
Or perhaps your bluff is a pressman's fake
(This is the best excuse to make).
Besides, who blames a rhetorical flight
When the round world knows that your heart is
right?
Have you not sworn that your fleet's increase
Is due to a passionate lust for Peace?—
Meaning, “Whatever the cost may be,
By Heaven, I'll have, on earth and sea,
A Paz Germanica, run by Me! ” O. S.
A THREATENED INSTITUTION.
For years past it has been losing its hold on the
affection of the people; its tyranny has provoked bitter
protests from many who have suffered under it, while
the majority regard it as, at best, an obsolete
encumbrance.
No, I do not mean the House of Lords. The institu-
tion I refer to is of less antiquity but in far more
imminent danger of abolition—the Tall, or Silk, Hat.
And it is fully aware of it, too. At this very moment
innumerable Tall Hats are trembling in their bandboxes
at the prospect of solitary confinement for the rest of
their natural existence. Observe your own some day,
when it is off its guard. You will notice—unless it has
grown too dull to be capable of any reflection at all–
that it is brooding darkly over its neglect. You do not
take it out so much as you did—you know you don't.
Yet, not a hundred years ago, the High Hat was
Man's inseparable companion. I have met a very old
White Beaver which had been through many a boat-race
and cricket-match, and whose owner would never have
dreamed of tramping over the stubble after partridges
without it. There was nothing singular in that. All
the High Hats went out rowing, cricketing, and shooting
in those days. Now their participation in active sport
is limited to hunting and coaching. -
And, in many other respects, their opportunities of
mixing in the world's affairs are becoming more and
more restricted. They are not to be seen so frequently
in the City as they used to be, though they are quite as
businesslike as ever they were. In the House of Com-
mons, where they have done such service in retaining
seats, there is a growing tendency to discuss the most
important measures without their assistance—a severe
deprivation to a class of hat so intimately connected with
politics.
Even a greater grievance is that a Silk Hat is no longer
allowed to attend Divine Service in the country. They
must feel this denial of religious privileges the more
deeply from its not being applied to the Round Hat. It
can be scarcely conceivable to any Silk Hat that a truly
devout churchgoer could ever, on first entering the build-
ing, breathe his customary invocation into so unorthodox
a receptacle as a Bowler. It is impossible to
exaggerate the haughty superiority with which the Tall
Hat regards its lower orders. But I believe it detests
the Bowler above all other rivals—possibly from a
consciousness that it is the most formidable of them.
Not that it is much fonder of the Straw or the pre-
tentious Homburg, while no words can express its
immeasurable contempt for the new green Tyrolese felt
—a thing that wears its bow, or—more revolting still—
a tuft of chamois beard at the back
Nevertheless the Silk Hats are forced to recognise
that such parvenus as these are gradually ousting them
from their supremacy. In their pessimism they ascribe
it to the degeneracy of an age that has grown too
luxurious and self-indulgent to be willing or able to bear
any longer the White Man's burden. Several of them
have already emigrated to foreign climes, where they are
still held in much esteem by the Heathen. Others are
leaving shortly. -
Are we to allow their departure without making an
effort to retain them? Can we afford to lose the
powerful moral influence exercised by a flawless Silk
Hat 2 What man does not remember the subtle
transformation that took place in him when, as a
boy, he assumed his first topper? The sudden sense of
having put away childish things; the awakening of a
new responsibility; the feeling that one had been brought
into closer touch with the mysterious world of grown.
ups; the intense pity for all less fortunate youths who
were not accounted worthy of a Tall Hat. How one
cherished it, shuddered if, by accident, one stroked it the
wrong way, grieved when its sheen was blurred by a
passing shower' True, there came a time when it was
less lovingly tended, but something of its early grandeur
always clung to it—even in decay. I think the man
must be hardened indeed who does not preserve some
kindly recollection of his first Tall Hat.
Then is it not a serious thought that, in the near
future, all boys—even at Eton itself—may grow
up without this invaluable stimulus to manliness and
self-respect? I think so—and, what is more, I hap-
pen to know, from sources which I need not particu-
larise, that all the more thoughtful Tall Hats are filled
with profoundest apprehension at the mere possibility.
They have few social pleasures heft to them now, an
occasional race-meeting or garden-party—if they are
very good hats—but little else. Very soon the only func-
tions at which they will be allowed to be present will
be weddings and funerals—a dismal prospect. At these
even the poorest people feel that the Tall Hat is indis-
pensable—indeed, I read only recently of a humble
establishment from which it could be hired for such
occasions at a shilling a day.
But can a Tall Hat be expected either to rejoice or
mourn with any sincerity if it only attends as a hireling?
Till now the Silk Hat's most influential protectors
have been the Frock and Morning Coat, both of which
have shown a marked distaste for any meaner headgear.

But they may be forced to abandon it at any time. Two
or three leaders of fashion have only to walk down Bond
Street some afternoon in frock coats and straw hats,
and the next day the Tall Hat would have fallen for
ever ! -
I am acquainted with an elderly and rather neurotic
Silk Hat, whose nap shivers with the conviction that this
will inevitably happen within the next twelvemonth.
Not that it need excite itself, as it will certainly be
superannuated long before that. But, of course, it
would be vain to attempt to soothe any Silk Hat by
such consolations.
Happily, the horizon has suddenly brightened in the
most unexpected quarter. Only this morning I read in
The Daily Chronicle that a band of heroic men have
resolved to make a gallant effort on behalf of the Tall
Hat.
They are organizing a demonstration on the 4th of
July in the grounds of the Franco-British Exhibition.
There they will parade, each champion adorned with a
Tall Hat “ of the most perfect shape.” I have for-
gotten to mention that the demonstrators will all be
members of the Journeymen Silk Hatters' Trade Union
—but that, after all, is such a detail.
It will be a magnificent—indeed, a sublime spectacle,
that procession of dauntless men in perfect Top Hats.
It can hardly fail to produce a tremendous impression.
No crowd could witness it without an instant revulsion
of feeling, a remorseful conversion to the beauty and
utility of the hat which, in their blindness, they had
discarded. I should not be surprised if they all burst
into tears. They will certainly repent. They needs
must love the highest when they see it. Yes, July the
4th is going to be a proud day for the Tall Hat.
It will serve to remind the nation of what it is in too
great danger of forgetting—that in times like these, when
none can say how soon or whence troubles and perils may
threaten us, we should think twice—and even thrice—
before lightly deciding to throw away our Tall Hats.
For, as has been nobly said (I forget by whom—myself,
perhaps), it is the Tall Hat that has made us English-
men what we are. F. A.

SIR THEODoRE MARTIN approaches his august theme,
Queen Victoria as I Knew Her (BLAckwood) with awed
manner suggestive of walking in a cathedral aisle while
service is in progress. When one grows accustomed to
this mannerism, one has to acknowledge that he adds
much to common information about the true and simple
nature of the late QUEEN. She was above all things
womanly, alike in her greatness and her defects. Sir
THEODoRE describes her in a sentence : “No marble
statue, but human to the core, craving the homely
... of simple, healthy human life.” Inevitably
the little volume covers some of the ground appropriated
by the massive work recently published by Mr. MURRAY.
Had it come first, its value would have been more
highly appraised. As it stands it is excellent. Sir
THEoDoRE's appreciation of his personal connection with
royalty is touching. He was personally introduced to the
QUEEN on the 14th November, 1866, and notes that
“the night before was memorable for the marvellous
transit of shooting stars (the Leonids) across the
heavens.” Thus is Nature apt to usher in momentous
events.

had been seriously impeded by an embarrassing develop-
ment of taste amongst the lions of the district. It
appeared that in general these lions were harmless
animals not without some reputation as family pets
amongst the native population. The building of the
railway had interested them at first in a mild way.
Closer investigation, however, had convinced them that
the men who were building the line and working the
trains had peculiar and irresistible attractions as cheap
food. So long as you remained a mere native or a
white spectator nothing happened to you, but as soon as
you began work on the railway you were seized and
masticated by a lion. I don't know how the struggle
intendents and to marvel at the sad vicissitudes to
which an Imperial race is compelled to submit.
To supervise Chinese workmen is in itself bad enough,
but to be poisoned by them for doing your duty seems
to be an excess of punishment. Even under ordinary
circumstances life at Ichang cannot be too attractive.
Golf there may be and tennis of a sort, and there must
be a club since there are Englishmen in the place; but
this exiguous list probably exhausts the amenities. No.
body can want the varieties of existence, increased, by
the dreadful suspicion of poison in his daily food. And
I wonder, by the way, what the ordinary unpoisoned
diet of a resident in Ichang consists of. I guess the
luxuries are not too many. Strychnine, arsenic, anti-
mony, prussic acid, and the rest, may be pleasant
enough in their proper places, but there are obvious dis-
conclusion of the

of the public de-

all superfluous expenditure. They investigate the sums
spent on Royal Palaces, on Parks, on Art and Science
Buildings, on Law Charges and Criminal Prosecutions,
and so forth. Amongst other items submitted to them
were the charges for “Gaol, etc., at Ichang.” I am
not quite sure that I know where Ichang is, but it has a
Chinese sound, and the inference that might naturally
be drawn from this is confirmed by what follows in the
Report.
With regard to this gaol, then, the Committee deliver
themselves in the following terms:– “An excess of
£120,” they say, “is explained as due to the cost of
superintendence being greater than had been anticipated.
In order to prevent bad workmanship, European Clerks
of Works have to be employed to supervise the Chinese
workmen. There is some difficulty in finding these
..superintendents, as ‘the Chinese persist in poisoning
them.’” I pause here to condole with the super-
terms of expen-
diture. Their feelings have been obviously touched, but
duty compels them to confine themselves to the business
committed to them. It is not for them to describe the
sufferings or to deplore the fate of the supervisors; nor
do they weigh heavily on the infernal persistence of the
Chinese workmen in the habit of poisoning. The words.
“not unnaturally,” so artfully introduced into their

A Remarkable Coincidence.

that of his twin brother, the Hon. F. W. Lambton,
born June 19, 1855.”

We think that Mr. SYDNEY BUxTon
ought to be told about this,
RULE BRITANNIA.
WHEN I looked at the programme
of The Flag Lieutenant (by Major
W. P. DRURY and LEO TREvoR) and
read “Richard Lascelles . . . . Mr.
Cyril Maude,” I knew at once what
the play would be about. For Dicks
in fiction and drama (and probably,
by this time, in real life) are always
the same; gay, gallant, and mis-
understood; particularly where the
other sex is concerned. The course
of true love never did run smooth
with anybody called Dick. In this
case, however, Lady Hermione was
a real sportsman, and promised to

stick to him; though I doubt if they
would have been married had not the
truth come out in the end. . .
In the British camp in Crete, sur-
rounded by howling Bashi-Bazouks,
are Dick Lascelles, flag-lieutenant,
and Bill Thesiger, major of marines.
The ammunition is giving out, and
unless a message can be got through
to the Fleet the play is doomed.
Bill conceives the idea of dressing up
as a Bashi, and making his way to
the telegraph office, whence a wire-
less message can be sent asking for
assistance. Just as he is starting, a
spent bullet knocks him over, so
Dick takes his place, and carries out
the plan successfully. When he gets
back (and he really does it very
quickly—in about even time, I should
—-
think) Bill is up and conscious, but
has completely lost his memory.
Whereupon Dick decides—can you
guess? yes, that's right—to pre-
tend that it was Bill who did the
gallant deed. You see, Bill had been
awfully good to him some years
before . (I can't explain now), and,
after all, it was his idea; and he was
in love with Mrs. Cameron, but
would not speak so long as he was
only a poor and undistinguished
major; and it really was sickening
luck to have been knocked over just
when his chance had come. So the
flag-lieutenant passes the honour and
glory over to his friend, which, seeing
that his name was Dick, was no
more than I expected of him.
Of course, what everybody wanted
to know was, where was Dick Las.
celles when Major Thesiger was mak.
ing his gallant effort? Hiding,
probably, the coward; or asleep in—
what 's the word 2—an embrasure.
There was some talk of a court.
martial, for Dick refused to give any
explanation. Luckily for Hermione
the truth leaked out, and so all ended
happily—even for Bill Thesiger; be.
cause they decide never to let him
find out that he wasn't the hero.
(Only five people knew the secret,
and two of them were women, so it
was quite safe; especially if the

second Act, in the British camp at
Candia, is the perfection of staging
and playing. There is even a Bashi:

contributor to the programme is
Lady DAisy FLUDYER, who is unques-
tionably the best lady player on the
penny-whistle in Arlington Street.
Lord ALDEBURGH has kindly promised
to play the “Chopsticks '' waltz
with the Marchioness of PERIVALE;
the Earl of MATLAskE will give a
banjo solo, and the Baroness
BLow ITz has generously undertaken
to recite “The Charge of the Light
Brigade '' to an accompaniment of
three tambourines played by the
Hon. ERMYNTRUDE, GLADYS and
BETTY BLAKENEY, the charming
daughters of Lord WINKLEMERE.
The generous interest taken in the
Ballet by the PRIME MINISTER is, we
learn on the best of authority, shared
by several of his colleagues, with the
result that the output of high-class
dance music is going up by leaps and
bounds. Mr. LULU HARcourt,
whose benevolent desire to provide
for the culinary needs of Members
of Parliament has so largely minis-
tered to the popularity of the present
Cabinet, has commissioned Mr.
GRANVILLE BANTock to write a new
set of Kitchen Lancers; and Mr.
Asquith has approached Sir Edward
ELGAR with a view to his assisting
the passage of the Licensing Bill by
composing a grand Temperance
waltz under the title of “Band of
Hope and Glory.” Mr. SYDNEY
BUxton, desirous of celebrating the
introduction of the penny post with
America, has invited Mr. Sousa to
commemorate the event in a “Wash-
ington Post Office Two-Step.”
The amenities of Tea on the
Terrace, it is pleasant to hear, will
be greatly enhanced by the establish-
ment of a permanent café chantant,
at which a Spotted Dalmatian Band
will shortly make its début, together
with a trained corps of Dervishes.
The waitresses, when not engaged in
handing or removing the teacups,
will execute various suitable choreo-
graphic evolutions—pavanes, sara-
bands, demivoltes, semilunes, and
caracoles—in which they are already
being instructed by Miss BELLE
CUNARD, the esteemed Terpsichorean
of the Frivoli Music-Hall. Mr.
HAROLD Cox and Lord Robert CECIL
vehemently opposed this humane
innovation on the ground that it ill
consorted with the dignity of the
Mother of Parliaments, but their
objections have been overruled as
the “futile protests of belated and
isolated fanatics,” to quote the noble
and dignified phrase of the PREMIER.
Outside Covent Garden, the dis-
couragement of British composers is
happily a thing of the past. At the
Impress Hall, Mr. Joris BAMBERGER,
perhaps the most brilliant of our
native conductors, is to give a concert
entirely devoted to the compositions
of British musicians of the advanced
school. The programme is not yet
complete, but it will certainly include
two symphonic poems, “Huitzi-
lopochtli" and “Chilpancingo,”
from the patriotic pen of Mr. QUAN-
Tock DE BAN VILLE; a suite entitled
“Haroun-al-Raschid,” introducing a
set of variations on the Burmese
National Anthem, by Mr. * FRANz
Josef HolleBRUCK; “Konx Ompax,”
an Eleusinian Mystery, by Mr. KUNo
MEYERSTEIN ; and an º: ode,
“The Death of Glumdalclitch,” for
bass solo, chorus and orchestra
(reinforced by sixteen contra-bass
tubas), by Mr. ALEXANDER CHIos, the
illustrious Anglo-AEgean from Shore-
ditch.

THE IDEAL LIFE.
INTERVIEw Ed by a representative
of the Eastminster Gazette, Miss
ZILLAH O'FLAHERTY, the famous
actress, has been giving her opinions
as to the best career for a nice girl.
“There are no two opinions,” said
the charming lady. “The only
calling for a girl is the stage. As for
its being overcrowded, that is absurd.
It may be congested in London, but
look at other parts of the world—
Africa, Asia, Iceland, Nova Zembla.
Wherever there is land there is the
site for a theatre, and wherever h.
is
a theatre there is need for
actresses.”
“It is a healthy life?” I said
tentatively.
“Healthy? I should think so,”
said the enthusiastic histrion.
“What is more healthy than
washing, and look how often an
actress has to wash. She must
spread grease-paint and other stuff
on her face continually, it is true;
but think, she must also get it off.
There 's hygiene for you!”
“Fresh air?” I suggested.
“Fresh air is an exploded idea,”
said Miss O'FLAHERTY. “The
healthiest persons are those con-
nected with theatres, who live per-
petually amid gas and heat and
draughts. Who ever hears of an
actress being ill?”
“But is it good to be always pre-
tending you are someone else?” I
asked.
“Good? It's splendid. Show
me a woman with any personality of
her own. You can't. The ordinary
woman without a personality never
gets one; the actress assumes a dozen

forth. I began at thirteen, and my
probation lasted ten years. I wish I

CHARIVARI. 463
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June
15.-After patient, not unfriendly,
observation, the MEMBER FOR SARK
has come to the conclusion that the
sitting House of Commons is the
dullest he has known in an experi-
ence of thirty-eight years. The more
grateful, therefore, for flash of
humour that to-day varied the dull
grey surface.
Second reading of Old Age Pension
being moved, HAROLD Cox submitted
an amendment, and Lord Robert
CECIL seconded it !
“The two anarchist leaders,”
LLOYD-GEORGE described them. Had
positions been reversed, the implac-
able Tory aristocrat moving the
amendment and the extreme Radical
seconding it, situation would have
been sufficiently piquant. As it
stood it was exquisite.
During brief period that has
elapsed since HAROLD Cox descended
from the Press Gallery and by favour
of shrewd electors of Preston took his
place on floor of House, he has by
sheer merit established a foremost
position amongst private Members.
Has not had many competitors in
the race. The new Parliament not
fruitful of rising men. The Treasury
Bench the only one that maintains
the high level of debating power.
Unaided by wealth, family connec-
tions or personal interest, HAROLD
Cox, midway through his third ses-
sion, has attained the enviable dis-
tinction of commanding attention in
both political camps. True, he has
formed the habit, attractive in debate.
of frankly criticising the policy and
practice of the Government under
whose flag he is ranged. Such
ebullitions certain to be applauded
from benches opposite. It is the
commonest device of political adven.
turers from the days of Dizzy down-
ward. HAROLD Cox enjoys the ines-
timable advantage of having con.
vinced the House that when, as to-
night, he differs from his esteemed
leaders, he is actuated by purely
conscientious motives, that truth and
honesty compel him, at whatever
sacrifice of personal predilection, to
speak outright.
This a recommendation irresistible
to House of Commons. Its price is
above the rubies of eloquence or
debating skill. Cox adds to it
evidence that, whether right or
wrong in his deductions, he is
thoroughly master of his subject,
is able to present his argument in
lucid form, here and there illu-
mined by flashes of quiet humour,

rattling majority of 388. Only 29
Members, Unionists all but one,

his best. Approved principle of
the Bill; denounced the Govern-
ment scheme; abstained from
voting in the division. His sympa-
thies, always broad, went out to
LLoyd-GEORGE in the depressing cir-
cumstances of the hour. Having
charge of a Budget he had not
devised, here he was piloting a Bill
for whose paternity he was not re-
sponsible.
“An embarrassed stepmother,”
PRINCE ARTHUR described him.
Laying aside political prejudices
and partisan asperities, his generous
heart expressed full sympathy with
the hapless CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExchEQUER. Slave to the stronger
will of the PREMIER, he had this mis-
taken measure foisted upon him. He
did not like it; was fully alive to its
frailties and its imperfections; did
not know where he was to get the
money needed for administering the
scheme it involved. Nor was he
quite clear as to its precise amount,
Was it to be six million or seven
million and a half 2
On this point PRINCE ARTHUR
earlier had his own tribulation.
Earl PERCY, with the cocksureness
that pertains to middle-age youth,
revelled in a mass of figures. Pulled
up by the practical-minded PREMIER,
he hesitated.
“My impression is,” he said,
“ that the CHANCELLOR of THE Ex-
cHEQUER announced that in view of
the changes he proposed to make in
the Bill we must be prepared for an
immediate cost of at least seven and
a half million.”
“The exact contrary,” said the
PREMIER grimly.
What is “the exact contrary " of
seven million and a half 2 PERCY in
bewilderment turned to his nearest
neighbour on Front Opposition
Bench. It chanced to be PRINCE
ARTHUR. Now if there is one thing
he ungovernably hates it is to have
to grapple with facts or figures,
particularly figures. And what a
problem this was to have suddenly
sprung upon one !
“Seven million and a half,’’ in-
sisted PERCY.
“The exact contrary,” said the
PREMIER.
“What do you think?” asked

PERcy, turning in bewilderment on
his Chief.
“Precisely,” said PRINCE ARTHUR,
nodding his head with air of con-
viction that carried the point.
That happened two hours ago.
Memory of the plight into which
he had been inconsiderately plunged
by the appeal of his colleague was
still with him, and softened his heart
towards the CIIANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER.

House of Commons, Friday. —
CATHCART W Aso N finds the advant-
ages of six feet nine and three-
quarter height, with breadth in
proportion, have their drawbacks.
For example, when he steps out into
Palace Yard and looks about for a
hansom, the drivers with one accord
find engrossing attraction on the
other side of the Square. As for a
four-wheeler, since on Budget night
two years ago he stuck in the
doorway of No. 17,451, and withdrew
only when assisted with crowbars,
they are taboo. He finds most con-
venient way of taking fresh air is to
hire a Road Car 'bus all to himself
on Sunday afternoons and drive to
Kew and back. Even then he is
annoyed by the conductor, who, at
various stages of the journey, absent-
mindedly offers him blue tickets,
price 2d., whereas the fare for a
single person is a penny.

“The overlapping of three men to one horse had a most serious effect . . . .
(Rt. Hon. George Wyndham's speech on the Territorial Cavalry.)
These things by the way. An inci-
dent happened just now which goes
some way to redress the balance.
Among unwritten laws of the House
is one that forbids a Member to
pass between an hon. gentleman on
his legs and the SPEAKER whom he
is addressing. CATHCART WASON,
standing by corner seat below the
gangway, was in this attitude when
THEoDoRE TAYLOR strolled in. His
mind engrossed with a statistical
problem that he proposes to submit
to Royal Society, of which he is a
shining light, he passed between
WAsoN and the Chair, as he made
his way up the gangway towards
his seat.
This an opportunity the House
never neglects. From both sides
there rose a roar of angry rebuke that
could not have been fiercer had
TAYLOR picked the Orkney Member's
pocket as he passed. From his full
height, drawn up to address the
Chair, WASON was ignorant of what
—or rather who—had passed. So
Beachy Head fronting France does
not see the fishing boats skimming
the waves at its feet. What had he
done or said to account for this storm
of obloquy” He turned round with
enquiring glance, reassured only
when Member sitting near whispered
explanation.
Meanwhile THEoDoRE TAYLOR, safe
in his seat below gangway, took off
his spectacles, breathed hard upon
them a thanksgiving for escape, and
polished them with his pocket-hand-
kerchief.

RHAPSODY IN THREE FLATS.
SHE had a name; that name was BEE.
I loved the girl and she loved me.
I put my bowler on my head
And called upon her. “BEE,” I said,
“Believe me when I briefly state
My love for you is very great.
It is, moreover, quite sincere.”
“Same,” said the simple maiden
“here.”
“If that 's the case,” I said, “a
man's
First duty is to book the banns.”
“But stop,” she cried, “ you go too
fast;
I promised JAMEs on Monday last.
He said: ‘I’ve liked you all my life;
You 'd better come and be my wife.
You'll find the living plain but
good.’
I'm almost sure I said I would.”
“Though I refuse to call him names,
I'm very cross,” said I, “with JAMEs.
It shows what sort of man he is
To go and carry on like thiz.
To come and interfere like this
Proves what a tactless man he iss.”
That 's not the half of what I said,
So BEATRICE married me instead.
“What course,” you ask, “ did
JAMEs pursue?”
What has that got to do with you?

“A T last,” said MR. PUNCH, “I have the pleasure of meeting you. I know your name so well, but this is the first time
I have been able to put a face to it.” And he shook England's Dramatist warmly by the hand. “Let me see,”
he went on, “you have twenty-three plays running in London just now, I think?”
“Twenty-four,” said the Dramatist modestly.
“You must be a man of many parts,” hazarded MR. PUNCH. -
“Well, of course I—” -
“There are one or two things about which I should like to talk to you. I have seen your name so often on
º hoardings, and if you will forgive me for mentioning it—motor-omnibuses, that I feel I know you
uite well.”
Q “You are very kind,” said England's Dramatist.
“A playwright,” continued the Sage, “particularly a twenty-fourth playwright, must have a great knowledge of
affairs. Also, by long practice, he must have achieved the art of projecting himself into the personality of others. Tell
me, then, what do you think of the new fashion in women's dress 2"
“Woman,” said the Dramatist, “is cutting off her petticoats to increase her hats.”
“Pardon me,” said MR. PUNCH gently, “but I was not for the moment addressing Mr. SoMERSET MAUGHAM, the
brilliant epigrammatist, but one of his many heroines. I wish for an expert opinion.”
“Then I may tell you in confidence that there is very little in it.”
“So I rather gathered. As Father BERNARD MAUGHAM, then, it might be your duty to »
“You misunderstand. I mean that there is little chance of the fashion being adopted to any extent. We pretend
in the Press that it will, just as we pretend that everybody calls the Exhibition the White City. But nobody does call
it that, of course.”
“You are speaking now as ALFRED MAUGHAMsworth 2" queried MR. PUNCH.
“. Rather as the Maugham in the Street. And I say that I do not do and think things just because my ha'penny
paper tells me that I do.”
“A very proper spirit. By the way, I must congratulate you on the advance the Exhibition has made since it
first opened.” -
Mr. MAUGHAMRI KIRALFY bowed.
“Let us hope now that England will do herself justice in the Olympic Games. And that reminds me. What is
your opinion of Australia's refusal to take part in the Triangular Test Matches 2"

“Briefly,” said the Maugham Sahib of NAWANAGAR, “that it is unsporting. We hear frequently that these matches
help to keep the Empire together, and we have been told that you cannot have Empire without sacrifice; but Australia,
all through, seems to keep her eye fixed firmly on the main chance.”
“It is evident,” said MR. PUNCH severely, “that you are speaking now as a Radical Maughamber, and it is therefore
my painful duty to call you a Little Englander.”
“Why not tell me to stay at home and mind the baby?” asked England's Suffragist scornfully.
“My dear Maughdam,” said MR. PUNCH, raising his hat, “I should not tell you to do anything so ridiculous.”
“Women are as good as men,” suggested Lady HENRY SOMERSET MAUGHAM.
“You will never get me to admit,” said the Sage, bowing gallantly, “that they are no better than men. Yet it
is still possible to feel that they are not such good citizens, that they cannot take such a wide view of affairs, and that
their logical sense is not quite so prominent. However, we shall do no good by arguing. Let me, instead, take the
opinion of Miss MAUGHAM ALLAN on another question. At what precise moment does a Watch Committee decide to
j." performance 2 At the moment when it is shocked, or at the moment when it realises that it ought to be
shocked 2 ”
“The Manchester Watch Committee is quite right,” said Mrs. MAUGHAMISTON CHANT firmly.
“Dear, dear,” said MR. PUNCH, “I beg your pardon. Shall we—er—leave the ladies for a moment? I think I
feel more at home with your male characters.” -
“To tell the truth,” said Mr. SoMERSET MAUGHAM, “I am tired of them all.”
M ſº that case I shall address you as yourself, and ask you, What do you think of the SHAKSPEARE Memaugham—
emorial?”
“You make it rather difficult for me,” he said. “I-er—well . . . Well, it's like this. SHAKSPEARE has no
plays on in London at the present time.”
“I see,” said Mr. PUNCH. “You think prolificacy rather than genius should be rewarded; and no doubt there
| - - - - - - - - -
is something to be said for that. But what if genius itself were prolific 2 I am thinking now of one whose total output
3 *
is rapidly approaching a century-and-a-half of volumes, and whose wit, humour, geniality, kindliness and—" Here
he said several things which modesty forbids him to say again. “Where, you ask, is such a man to be found 2 Where
can the results of his genius be obtained ? I will tell you. Nay, more, I will xx
“I don't mind if you do,” said the Maugham in the Street. “Because I know quite well what's coming next.
