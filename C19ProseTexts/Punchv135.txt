A DRAWING-ROOM PROBLEM.
Miss X. is a good young lady,
living in an agricultural district, who
invites an adult Sunday School class
to tea in the drawing-room. Y., one
of the scholars, is a burly farm-
servant, unaccustomed to social
functions, and especially inapt at the
handling of tea-cups.
He is supplied with a diminutive
cup and saucer and a bun that is too
big to go into the saucer. Finding
the tea too hot for his taste, he puts
the bun in his mouth, holds the cup
in his right hand and pours the tea
into the saucer which is in his left
hand.
Having done all this satisfactorily,
he raises the saucer in order to
blow on the tea before drinking, but
discovers, with confusion, that the
bun is in the way.
What ought Y. to do?

THE PERFECT SCRIBE.
["No journalist ought to write anything of which he is ashamed."—
Lr,titli Weekly.]
AUTHOR of yon immortal wheeze,
Which so commoved me when I read it,
If with this law your life agrees
It does you (may I say so, please ?)
The most enormous credit.
"Pis well that in the whirl and rush
Of things that hamper introspection
You have the gift of saying " Hush!"
In time to stop the ruby blush
From staining your complexion.
Your conscience keeps you timely wise:
You take its counsel like a sage's,
Rejecting naughty words and lies
Which must, if printed, compromise
Your Weekly's model pages.
So, having purged your matter free
From faults of spirit and of letter,
You say: '' There are no spots on mo;
This is as good as good can be,
Or even slightly better!
Ah, would that we could follow you,
We other scribes, mere ha'penny print-hacks!
We are indeed a shameless crew,
Content to say what's far from true,
And farther still from syntax.
Some of us try a nobler strain,
Treading the track your feet have dented,
And yet we somehow don't attain
Your self-assurance, but remain
Divinely discontented.
Thus, had you written in my stead
These lines that I have here begotten,
Your heart, perhaps, would not have bled;
Mine does, because I 've seldom read
Anything quite so rotten. 0. S.
DISCURSIONS.
MBS. BOBRINSKY.
I AM not sure that the title I have given to this story
is the best I could have selected. There are others that
would perhaps have suited it quite as well, if not better
—but, after all, Mrs. BOBRINSKY began it, and her name
shall, therefore, stand at the head of it. Originators
have some right to be considered.
Mrs. BOBRINSKY is my housekeeper. She was born a
PEOLER, of London, and became entitled to the
BOBRINSKY by marrying a Polish exile, now deceased,
who, according to her account, made the best cabinets
that were ever sold in the Euston Road or anywhere
else. He used, she has told me, "to rig up a bit of
tarpaulin on some poles in the backyard, and sit there
of a Sunday morning reading his paper, and say it
reminded him of Poland." Once a year it was his
custom to walk to the Russian Embassy in Chesham
Place and relieve his patriotic feelings by spitting on the
doorstep. This sacred rite having been accomplished he
would return to his cabinet-making with a light heart.
Mrs. BOBRINSKY, in spite of her name, is British to
the core. Her father was in "the joolery business,"
and most of her uncles "was cooks." I quote her
family history as related by herself. She can sew any-
thing and can cook most things. She is a mine of anec-
dotes and a most excellent housekeeper in a London
flat. Her relations with the porter are respectful, but
not cordial. She suspects the lift-boy of every possible
dereliction of duty that a human lift-boy can commit.
She considers him to bo too saucy and frivolous in his
talk for the responsible position he occupies. Some day,
she believes, there will be an accident, and the world
will realise too late the inefficiency of the lift-boy.
It was a June evening, and Mrs. BOBRINSKY was
laying my table for dinner while I was sitting in an arm-
chair. "There's only a couple of cutlets, some new
potatoes, a dish of peas, and a gooseberry tart," she
remarked. "And a very good dinner, too," said I.
She then began to tell me the story of BOBRINSKY and
the one-eyed black cat with three legs; but she broke off
before she finished it and went out of the room. 1
heard her talking outside the room to someone whose
voice was strange to me. I determined to follow her.
When I opened the door I noticed without the least
surprise that the hall of my flat had disappeared and the
Twopenny Tube had taken its place. The Tube
stretched out interminably, but it was brilliantly lighted,
and I could see along it for miles. Mrs. BOBRINSKY,
now a mere speck, but easily recognisable by a green
silk hood which I had never before seen her wear, was
rushing down the Tube at an astonishing pace. She
was ten miles away and still going strong. As no trains
were running there was nothing for me to do but to
pursue her on foot. No sooner had I started than a
motor-'bus came thundering round a corner upon me. I
remembered that a Colonial Bishop had once told me
that the only way to deal with such a 'bus was to kneel
to it and say " Rottingdean " three times very quickly.
I knelt, but for the life of me I couldn't say
"Rottingdean."
Mr. ASQUITB, the Prime Minister, was in the 'bus.
He had a long white beard and wore a Glengarry cap
and a kilt. He was very like a Scotch piper I had seen
in Parliament Street that afternoon, but he had left his
pipes behind. He winked at me very deliberately, and,
the 'bus having by this time passed completely over me,
I found myself at Paddington Station, where, after a
dispute with a cabman, who had been driving me for
more than an hour, I entered a train at Platform No. 5.
My wife was already in the carriage. She smiled at me
and continued to feed our youngest daughter, aged four,
on marmalade and Shetland shawls. I said, "You
know that is not good for the child," and she said, "I
had to buy Whiteley's new hippopotamus: he was so
cheap." I realised that this explained everything.
At this moment a porter looked in and said the plat-
forms had all been changed and our train had gone five
minutes ago. I said to my wife, "I told you so," and
got out at once. When I turned round I saw my wife
and child three platforms away. She said, "St.
Pancras " and vanished, and I recognised the Master of
Trinity, who said he was sorry, but I must on no account
walk on the grass. He added that it wasn't Olympic
and laughed heartily. I knew it was the best joke in
the world and laughed even more heartily
"Your cutlets are on the table, Sir," said Mrs.
BOBRINSKY.

MORE FLOWERS OF SPEECH.
ital. "I SAY, OLD MAN, STIFFISH NTMPHEBY. WHAT?
A MERE EPISODE.
(By a Person in a Pageant.)
OUR episode is the tenth and last,
and (I may add unofficially) the most
important. The period of it is 1750.
In order to lead up to it properly it
has been found necessary to start the
first episode at 53 B.C. This gives
the audience time to get hungry for
us. "At last! " they say, when we
come on; " this is the end, MARIA."
The Duchess of KIRKCUDBRIGHT
(N.B.) says that they don't say that
at all. They say, "Why, HENRY,
it 's 1750! I had no idea. How the
time flies when you are enjoying your-
self. We must stay to the end; a
few minutes won't make any differ-
ence now, and it 's only cold
mutton."
I must explain that it is the
Duchess of KIRKCUDBRIGHT (N.B.)—
and do remember the "N.B." be-
cause she is very particular about
it—who in this episode condescends
to dance a minuet with me: that
stately old measure (if you don't trip
over the sandhill opposite Block D.)
which so delighted our forefathers.
It is a very sad thing, but though
the whole Pageant, as I have ex-
plained, hinges upon us, yet our
names and description do not appear
upon the programme. We are put
down briefly, and I think libellously,
as " Revellers." However, we learnt
that we were really people of
some position—right in the Smart
Set, by all accounts; so I decided to
be Lord TUNBRIDGE WELLS, and my
partner the Duchess of KIRKCUD-
BRIGHT (N.B.). That is just like her
—to be a whole county, when I am
only a watering-place.
We are supposed to do the " revel-
ling " as soon as we come in. As I
lead my partner down the steps I
say to her, "Our revel, 1 think,"
and she replies, " Shall we revel, or
shall we sit it out?" After a little
discussion we decide to revel, partly
because there is nowhere to sit down,
and partly because the prompter has
his eye on us. Now, I don't know
what your idea of revelling is, but
mine would include at the very least
a small ginger ale and a slice of seed-
cake. I mean, I don't think that
would be overdoing it at all. But
do you suppose we are allowed this
—or indeed anything? Not likely.
And yet it is just a little touch of that
sort which gives verisimilitude to a
whole Pageant.
Before we have really got through
our revelling the band strikes up, and
suddenly we are all in our places
for the minuet. Now although you
have paid your two guineas like
a man, and are sitting in the very
front row, you mustn't think we
have taken all this trouble of learning
the minuet simply to amuse you.
Not at all. We are doing it for the
sake of KING GEORGE THE SECOND,
no less; a command performance.
And so when we are all in a line,
just ready to start, and I whisper to
my partner, "I say, I'm awfully
sorry, but I 've forgotten the minuet.
Let 's do the Lancers instead," she
whispers back, "Quick! GEORGE is
looking at me. Is my patch on
straight?" "No,"I say. "Now,
don't forget you have to smile all
the time. Hallo, we 're off."
I am not going to describe the
dance to you, because it is too diffi-
cult. But I may say briefly that

[JULY 1, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
there 's a whole lot of things you do
with your feet, and another whole lot
with your hands; that you have to
sway your body about in an easy and
graceful manner; that you must keep
one eye on the ground to see that
you don't fall over the sandhills, and
another eye on your partner to see
that she is doing it all right, and the
two of you a joint eye on everybody
else to see that the affair is going
symmetrically. And then — then
comes the final instruction: "Don't
look anxious. Smile, and seem to
be enjoying 3Tourself."
So far I have resisted the inclina-
tion to smile. The fact is that when
I cast aside my usual habiliments
and take upon me the personality of
another, I like to do the thing
thoroughly—to enter into the spirit
of the part. Now I will put the case
before you, and you shall say
whether I am not right.
Here we have, as I conceive the
situation, a sprig of the nobility,
TCNBRIDOE WELLS. He is a modest
young man, who spends most of his
time at his lovely Kentish seat,
flanked by fine old forest trees—pre-
ferring the quiet of the country to
the noise and bustle of London.
One day, however, he ventures up
to town, and looking in at his cus-
tomary coffee-house is hailed by an
acquaintance. TUNBRIDOE WELLS, I
may mention, is beautifully attired
,in a long blue coat, white satin waist-
coat, fancy breeches, with quaint
designs painted on them, silk stock-
ings, and shoes which are too tight
for him.
"What are you doing to-night?"
says his friend. "Come down to
Chelsea with me. There 's a grand
Venetian fete on, and old GEORGE
will be there."
"Right," says TUKBRIDGE WELLS.
When they get to the Gardens his
friend takes him aside.
"I say," he begins anxiously, "I
hope you won't mind, but the fact
is that I 've promised you shall dance
in a minuet to-night. Old GEORGE
particularly wants to see one."
"But I simply couldn't," says
TUNBRIDGE WELLS in alarm. "Can't
you get somebody else?"
"Oh, but you must. I 've got
you a jolly partner—the Duchess of
KIRKCUDBRIGHT (N.B.). You know
the minuet, of course?"
"Well, I've learnt it; but I've
very nearly forgotten it again. And
my shoes are beastly uncomfortable.
Before the KING, too. It's a bit
steep, you know."
"Well, then, you will. Good
man."
"No, no," cries TUNBRIDGE
WELLS hastily, and leads his friend
aside under the trees. "I say,"
he begins mysteriously, "don't say
anything, but . . . well, it 's rather
awkward .... I may as well tell
you .... these—er—these things
are a bit tight. They look all right
like this, you know, but when you
bend down—well, I mean I have
to be jolly careful."
"I was just thinking how pretty
they were. A beautiful thing, that,"
he adds, pointing to a crescent moon
in blue on TUNBRIDGE WELLS' left
knee.
"Don't touch," says .WELLS in
alarm. "It comes off like anything.
I lost a dragon-fly only yesterday.
Well, you see how it is, old man.
But for them I should have loved it.
Only ... I say, don't be a fool.
. . . . Your servant, DUCHESS. 1
was just saying .... Yes, I am
devoted to it. .• . . Yes. . . . Yes.
Let 's see, it is the left foot, isn't it?
(Confound that idiot!)"
Now then, do you wonder that
the poor fellow looks anxious? or that
I feel it my duty, as a good actor, to
look anxious too?
I have promised not to describe
the whole minuet to you, but I must
mention one figure in it of which I
am particularly fond. In this you
rejoin your partner after a long
absence, and you have once more
her supporting hand to hold you up.
For some hours previously you have
been alone in the wild and undulating
open, tripping over mole-hills and
falling down ha-has; and it is very
pleasant (especially when your shoes
fit you too soon) to get back to her and
pour all your troubles into her sym-
pathetic ear. It 's a figure in which
you stand on one foot each for a con-
siderable time, and paw the air with
the others. You preserve your
balance better if you converse easily
and naturally.
"I nearly came a frightful purler
just now. Did you see?"
"H'sh, not so loud. Have you
found mother yet? She 's here to-
day."
"One of my patches fell off. I
hope nobody heard it."
"You 've got a different wig to-
day. Why?"
"It's greyer. I had such a very
anxious moment yesterday. You
know that last bow at the end where
you go down and stay under water
for about five minutes? Well, I
really thought — however, they
didn't."
"I don't like you in this one. It
doesn't suit you at all."
"So I thought at first. But if you
gaze at it very earnestly for three
hours, and then look up at the
ceiling, you"
"Why, there is mother. Hold up."
"I fancy we have rather a good
action in this figure. Do you think
she 's noticing it? I hope she knows
that we could stand on one leg with-
out moving the other one at all. I
mean I don't want her to think
Hallo, here we are. Good-bye. See
you again in the next figure but
one." And the Duchess of KIRK-
CUDBRIGHT (N.B.) trips off.
I put in the "N.B." because she
is very particular about it; and I say
"trips " because I know the ground.

OUE GREATEST NOVELIST IN
DARKEST AFRICA.
Miss VICTORIA Boss's TOUR.
IT is pleasant to think that the
enterprise shown by Mrs. ELINOR
GLYN in sampling the seamy side of
Californian life, as recently chronicled
in The Evening Standard and St.
James's Gazette, is not an isolated
instance of feminine intrepidity. Our
correspondent at Abomey, the capital
of Dahomey, sends us" an interesting
letter describing the even more thril-
ling adventures of Miss VICTORIA
Boss, carefully-edited extracts from
which we now venture to place
before our readers :—
"Miss VICTORIA Boss, the no-
torious English novelist, whose
romances have recently been boy-
cotted in the foe Vies of all the
whalers of Dundee and Peterhead,
was at first looked on askance on
her arrival in Dahomey; but gradu-
ally the exclusive Amazonian coteries
unbent, and before her departure she
was entertained to an anthropophagi
di'jciincr by the Generalissimo and
Staff of the Territorial Army."
"Miss Boss, who is travelling
through West and Central Africa in
search of local colour for her next
story, 'The Man-Eaters,' is charmed
with her experiences at Abomey and
Whydah, where she visited the sacred
snakes in the Temple of Bilimbing.
During her stay in the Temple she
was actually bitten by one of these
formidable monsters; but, as might
have been expected, the audacious
reptile did not long survive the in-
discretion."
"Interviewed by a representative
of the Abomey Bugle, Miss Boss ex-
pressed herself in laudatory terms of
the morals and manners of Dahomey.
'Your methods of dealing with the
question of the survival of the unfit-
test," she said with a charming smile,
'seem to me admirably logical and
efficacious, and I only wish that the
Prime Minister of England hnd an
opportunity of witnessing your war-
dances, or introducing them at one
of his garden-parties.' Miss Boss
subsequently took part in a grand
gorilla hunt, in which two fine speci-
mens of the anthropoid ape fell to
her rifle, and when last heard of was
wading dauntlessly through the Great
Agrimcj Swamp, in the company of
her publisher, Mr. STINGAREE
GULCHRH and the Headman of the
Bodili tribe, on her way to the Kong
mountains in search of further
tropical experiences to incorporate in
her new novel."
LOW LIVING AND LOW
THINKING.
[We learn from the most recently published
volume of the Eversley Tennyson that the poet
once made a strenuous effort to be a vegetarian.
At the end of six weeks, however, his sense of
fatuity drove him back to a mutton chop, after
which he saw visions.]
SAID I, "Let the lambkin no longer
Be led to the slaughter for me;
Let the ox, honest beast,
Still continue to feast
With the grass growing up to his
knee.
No more shall they jelly the conger
To gratify palate of mine;
The chick shan't be taken
And served up with bacon
To make me a dish when I dine.
Refined shall be my food,
And simply chaste my fare;
Upon some humble cereal
My soul shall grow ethereal:
Gross thoughts shall ne'ei
intrude
To raise my startled hair
If I but crunch a nut for lunch
And dine upon a pear."
With hope all expectant I started
My test of the simple regime.
The first thing to take
Was a cauliflower steak,
And then I sat waiting to dream.
When several hours had departed
And nothing came into my brain
I dined somewhat sparsely
On cutlets of parsley,
And then I sat waiting again.
Week slowly followed week—
How slowly none can know!
Once o'er a leg of lentil
My soul grew sentimental;
And once a loin of leek
Inspired my genius so
That with its aid I nearly
made
A little tiny mot.
Alas! these poor flickering flashes
Grew fewer and further between,
And they came not because
Of the diet that was,
But because of the meat that had
been.
Rice sirloins and carroty hashes—
I found it was these I must thank
For kindly revealing
The empty-full feeling
And turning my mind to a blank.
"A ruddy chop," I cried,
"A steak with richness wet,
This is the raw material
That makes a man ethereal!
My vegetarian pride
I 'm eager to forget —
Who will may rail, but I shall
trail
My clouds of glory yet."
HERE, THERE, AND
EVERYWHERE.
(An exercise in Westminster Gazettics.)
The Pan-Anglican Congress.
LONDON, the place chosen as the
scene of the recent Pan-Anglican
Congress, is the capital of England
and one of the principal cities of the
world. It is very old, traces of
Roman occupation being still visible,
and every year it increases in size
and attracts more and more visitors.
This year the number of Americans
in London is said to be phenomenal.
London has had many celebrants,
but none more eloquent than the
American poet, who wrote:—-
City of industry and wealth and grime,
How wonderful thou art, and how sublime!
No two better adjectives than these
have ever been applied to London.
It is truly wonderful and sublime.
The New Prince.
The birth of another Prince to the
Queen of SPAIN is by no means the
only instance of a Royal mother
having two sons in succession. In
fact this feat was accomplished by no
less a personage than the Queen of
SPAIN'S grandmother, the late QUEEN
VICTORIA. Apropos of the new
Prince, it is interesting to note that
the letters of his many names, when
added together, come to a total only
five fewer than the number of ships
in the great Armada sent out k>
conquer England by PHILIP.
The Lush Month.
In July, says the poet of the
cuckoo, he gets ready to fly. This is
no doubt true. The whole poem
may come to the reader as a pleasing
novelty:—
In April
Come he will.
In May
He sings all day.
In June
He changes his tune.
In July
He gets ready to fly.
In August
Go he must.
To these were appended, says the
late Sir MOUNTSTUART GRANT-DUFF,
the following amusing lines at a
breakfast party at which DARWIN
and ODO RUSSELL were vying with
each other in couplets. DARWIN
added:—
In September
He 's gone, remember.

Strand takes one back to the
eighteenth century and the contro-
versy which raged around the pro-
posal of the then Lord Mayor to

of Gog and Magog by undraped
figures of himself and the Lady

alive with opinions on the subject,
and it is needless to say that the

HOW NOT TO DRESS ON £2,000

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Forgive your
old friend " The Major" whose con-
versations on clothes you must have
met next but one to the advertise-
ment pages in the weekly papers) for
ntruding, but really it is too bad.
Silk hat and knickerbockers, indeed!
I need not remind you that it was
I who first announced to an aston-
ished world that trousers must be
pressed down the middle, the only
operation I ever heard of that can
be performed by a man asleep in his
bed. The more sleep, in fact, the
better for the trousers. But perhaps
you keep a trouser-press.
From the many little ohats we
have had about summer suitings, the
ups and downs of collars and the
extraordinary merit of Messrs. PUSH-
SALE'S back studs (the distinction
between me and the advertisement
pages has not always been strictly
preserved) you will have gathered
that I have a delicate, artistic tem-
perament. Silk - hat and knicker-
bockers! (Breeches, no doubt, he
would call them, but that would be
a mere quibble.) Conceive my feel-
ings, to whom, though long experi-
ence of barristers' clerks has made
the Bowler - hat - and - Tails seem
familiar and almost picturesque, the
Frock-coat-and-Straw-hat is still pain-
ful. What are those things to Silk-
hat-and-Knickerbockers?
Tired and worn by exacting ex-
periments upon the polishing of
pumps, I had on that fatal afternoon
had the misfortune to meet in the
Strand two sets of Frock-coat-and-
Straws, one of them smoking a pipe,
and such a pipe, too! Quite un-
manned, I did what you would have
done; I fled to Bond Street for rest
and recuperation. It was there, of
all places, that I saw IT. Oh, the
pain and the shame! 'Silk-hat and
knickerbockers, indeed! In London,
note: in Birmingham it might have
amused me. In Bond Street, mark
you: in the Fulham Eoad I might
have endured it with only a passing
spasm. Silk hat and knickerbockers!
Hateful; inconceivably vile; mon-
strous. And the fellow was a
Bishop too.
Your desperate MAJOK.
Objection has been raised to the
opening of the Franco-British Exhi-
bition on Sundays, because it is a
place of amusement for which an
entrance fee is charged. The diffi-
culty has now been met by the
suggestion that the public should be
admitted free, and charged a shilling
to go out.

NEW FRUITS FOR OLD.
[Mr. BOYLE in the CornVill expatiates on the delights of a number of
unfamiliar fruits, including the tarippo, the cherimoya, the langsat, the
rambi, the guango, the mandaroit, and the bododo.]
OH, I am aweary of all the ancient fruits—
The apple, the pear, yea, even the velvet peach,
And when I behold them, any or all or each,
My heart sinjss down to the bottom of both my boots.
The strawberry once I loved, but strawberries pall;
I love the nectarine still, but the only time
When the taste of the nectarine touches a height
sublime
Is when you pluck it fresh from a sun-kissed wall.
Time was when the orange attracted my callow lips,
And the lemon blended with soda merited praise,
But the glamour of both has waned in my latter days,
For they break my heart with their everlasting pips.
No, the ancient fruits no more my allegiance claim,
'And I long for something that is not obsolete,
"With a flavour of Will-o'-the-wisp," yet not too
sweet,
And above all owning a weird, exotic name.
Such qualities, I am sure, must be enshrined
In the heart of the delicate, elegant tarippe.
I can fancy its juices adown my gullet slip
Like a river of liquid gold quadruply refined.
And the name of the cherimoya my soul arrides,
Recalling the whisper of muted ^Eolian strings,
Or the melodies sung at the courts of elfin kings,
Or the lapping at dusk of dim Lethoean bides.
Why should the langsat afar in a tropic land
Waste all its sweetness on savages forlorn,
While I with palate unsated in London mourn ?—
This, this is a thing no fellow can understand!
Could I but feast, in a humble catamaran,
On the ranibi, what measures divine would flow from
my pen!
What deeds would I do, unknown to mortal ken,
Inspired by the guango or even the jintawan!
O why, Sir ALFRED JONES, are you grown so keen
On shipping bananas alone to the Severn shore,
When the throats of men like me are thirsting sore
For the sweets of the mandaroit and the mangosteen?
Oh, bring us the cool bododo, for which I pant,
Give us the luing, and, ringed with an aureole,
Your name shall blaze on Pomona's golden scroll .
As her truest and most devoted hicrophant.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIABY OF TOBT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
June 22. — Indefinable
something of difference
about Mr. WEIB since last
he heckled the hapless
Scotch Secretary. A deeper
note in his reverberating
voice as, in reluctant sub-
mission to hidden hydraulic
power, it is brought up
from his boots. More
threatening glare in his eye
as over his pince-nez he
regards the guilty Minister.
Sterner tone in his re-
minder that two years ago
the very same answer was
made to identical question.
"If," he added ex pro-
fundis, "the right hon.
gentleman does not do
something shortly he will;
go down to posterity un-
honoured and unsung."
Member for SARK says
the subtle change is due
to Royal influence. At the
Windsor Garden Party on
Saturday, Mr. WEIR,
watching' the Independent
Labour Members stalking
the King, determined that
Ross and Cromarty should
not be out of the game.
After patient endurance he
succeeded in being hon-
oured by recognition. SARK says
that on approaching the Presence he
instinctively dropped inlo his habitual
Parliamentary formula and began,
"Is your Majesty a-Weir?"
That probably a flight of fancy.
Certainly Mr. WEIR had speech with
his Sovereign and feels it rather a
come-down to be now putting his
customary half-dozen questions to a
mere Secretary of State.
Business done.—HERBERT GLAD-
STONE moved second reading of
Eight Hours (Miners) Bill. Eleven

to finishing debate to-night. At
eleven o'clock at least a dozen

cordingly adjourned to unnamed

Tuesday.—When F.- W. LAMBTON
lets himself go he is the Eclipse of
debate. For powerful denunciation
of an iniquitous Ministry he has no
compeer. Consider his protest against
their arbitrary use of closure to
hustle on the Old Age Pensions Bill.
"The Government," he said in an
impassioned flight of eloquence
that brought tears to eyes of Sir
FREDERICK BANBURY, "throws at the
House, as bones are thrown to a dog,
crude Bills w-hich Ministers have
not thought out. Hon. Members

As this glittering cascade of almost
Oriental imagery fell from
LAMBTON's lips HENRY
CRAIK sat, hard by in
gloomy silence. Had had
his little triumph. But
what was it compared with
this avalanche of trope?
In debate on Old Age Pen-
sions Bill he clinched the
matter, by describing the
contributory principle as
"the sheet anchor holding
the balance."
In contrast with LAMB-
TON'S metaphors this has
disadvantage of being
submarine in locality. A
sheet anchor holding a
balance is one of the secrets
of mechanics which the
dark, unfathomed caves of
ocean bear. LAMBTON's
pageant moves on the sur-
face under the dome of
heaven. You see ASQUITH
throwing to clemmed
Members crude Bills he
has not thought out.
You watch the pack turn
at crack of whip, gallop
across Lobbies, and so to
their kennels upstairs.
Almost you hear the
crunching of the ill-cooked
measures they gorge them-
selves withal. The unplumb'd, salt
estranging sea hides working of
CRAIK's simpler device.
But there it is, grandly impressive,,
reckless of storms above or ground-
swell below—a sheet anchor holding

"Sir," said Mr. BEES, more in
sorrow than in anger, "does the

moment in my hand a discharge."
As he held out the document in
full view of what should have been
a sympathetic House, a roar of
laughter burst forth. Where did he
get the discharge? Was it duly
certified? and where had he been
secreting himself for the last fort-
night? These and other ribald ques-
tions went round.
REES returned document to breast

mitting to himself that nothing is to
be done with a flippant assembly like
this.
Business done.—More Committee

SEELY has put on the Ministerial
manner as if it were a garment.
Also how well it fits him. Only the
other day was a free lance below
the gangway, wanting to know all
kinds of inconvenient things from
Ministers. Now the poacher is
turned game-keeper, with proverbial
consequence.
Easy enough to read from manu-
script answer to question of which
notice has been given. It is the
supplementary enquiries permitted
by leniency of the SPEAKER that
give the Minister pause. No one
has yet taken a rise out of the new
Under Secretary for the Colonies.
On controversial questions connected
with DINIZULU or labour in the Rand
Mines the ball is tossed from side to
side. Ministerialists and Members
of Opposition fiercely talk at each
other across the body of Under Secre-
tary. All the while he feels that
the Transvaal and Natal are listening
at the door. A maladroit expression,
an unjustifiable denial, an untimely
admission, would have the effect of
dropping fat on the flame. SEELY
stands the cross-fire with unfailing
coolness and comes out unhurt.
Business done.—Tobacco Growing
(Scotland) Bill passed third reading.
THE COASTGUARD.
FROM the white-washed wall that
enclosed the garden in front of his
trim cottage you could have thrown
a stone far into the sea two hundred
feet below. He was standing at the
corner of the enclosure, a big tele-
scope tucked under his arm, a mast
with the White Ensign flying at the
gaff rising just behind him. I
glowed with exercise and patriotism
as I scrambled up the steep path to-
wards him—a solitary figure keeping
watch and ward over miles and miles
of Britannia's realm.
"You 've got the command of the
sea here, anyhow," I remarked,
thinking my little play upon words
rather happy, considering the heat .of
the day. He nodded gravely.
"You wouldn't believe what the
wind's like on this cliff," he said;
"took up all them broccolis by the
roots last week, it did."
I glanced round the devastated
garden, not quite sure which was the
plant in question; but my nautical
fervour refused to be brought to
earth. My eyes fell upon a small
shed that must needs, I thought,
contain the signals that will be let off
en the approach of the enemy.
"Blue lights? " I ventured, point-
ing to it, pleased with my acuteness.
"Blue rocks," he corrected. "The
missus likes 'em in a pie, but they
make a sad mess of the garden, they
do."
I began to conceive a dislike to the
garden. The awkward pause that
followed was interrupted by a second
coastguard running out of the cottage
to us, with anxiety and even alarm
written large upon his bronzed face.
"Let's have that glass, BILL," he
said, hastily taking the telescope.
"Is it possible," I pondered,
"that the invading squadrons are
already upon the horizon?" But
no. The second coastguard, steady-
ing the telescope by the mast under
the shadow of the White Ensign, was
searching, not the sea, but the coun-
tryside. My heart gave a jump.
"Surely, surely," I gasped, "they
cannot yet have landed. Where is
the Home Fl"
"Haven't seen naught of my
ducks this morning, BILL, have
yer? " muttered the anxious one, the
glass still screwed to his eye.
It was evident that in order to get
at the expert opinion of BILL and his
mate upon naval policy I must first
ingratiate myself by pretending to
take an interest in their curiously
rural pursuits. I determined to
seize the earliest opening that offered.
"Here 's the gunboat, HENERY!"
suddenly snapped the first coast-
guard, springing to the handle of
the semaphore that stood at the
corner of the wall.
HENRY swiftly swung the telescope
round to bear upon a craft just glid-
ing into view from behind the head-
land and close in-shore.
"New type of scout," I observed,
by way of showing how up-to-date my
naval intelligence was.
They gave a grunt that might
have meant assent or the reverse.
They were already talking to the gun-
boat with their weird machine.
Now was my opportunity to show
how much I delighted in ducks.
"Have they seen anything of
them? " I asked, with anxiety.
BILL fixed me with an eye in which
there was a good deal of pity.
"If," he said, slowly wagging his
head towards the path up which I
had come, "you would kindly rejine
your—your attendant—HENERY and
me is rather busy."
That 's the way with these pro-
fessionals. The more enthusiastic
the amateur is, the more severely
they snub him.

[A pretty little story appeared lately in The
Evening Neva of how Mr. JOHN BURNS was
seen in a tramway car playing with the toes of a
curly-haired baby which was sitting on its
mother's knee (or it might have been its aunt's).
"How delightful," whispered a lady to a
companion, "to see a Cabinet Minister playing
with a baby." "A Cabinet Minister!" replied
the other. "What do you mean?" "I mean,"
the first lady said, with a alight inclination of
the head, "that that is the Right Hon. John
Burns—the people's John—John of Battersea."]
A TOUCHING little incident is re-
ported to have occurred in Whitehall
yesterday. A boyish-looking figure
was seen hurrying across the road-
way, making for the Board of Trade
Office, when his progress was barred
by a pigeon which was complacently
feeding in the gutter. Instead of
brushing the bird aside impatiently
or even trampling on it (as many
men in his place would have done,
for he was evidently in a hurry), this
courteous knight waited till the bird
had passed, and then—but not till
then—resumed his way with a cheery
nod and a smile to the feathered ob-
structionist. "How sweet," said a
smart-looking woman to her com-
panion, "to see a Cabinet Minister
so punctiliously polite to a pigeon."
"A Cabinet Minister?" replied the
friend. "What do you mean?" "I
mean," said t'he first lady, "that
that is the President of the Board
of Trade—WINSTON CHURCHILL—our
WINNIE—the Member for Dundee."
[It turned out afterwards to be a
War Office messenger, but we give
the story for what it is worth.]
EXPLOSIONS THAT TELL.
A FRENCH scientist claims to have
invented an explosive which, instead
of going off with a bang, speaks any
word and in any language that is
required of it. By this invention
every firework may tell its story, and
every Chinese cracker crack its little
joke.
An enterprising vendor of novel-
ties is putting on the market, at a
shilling a dozen, what he has named
"Bombs to relieve the feelings."
If a straphanger steps on your toe,
or if you just miss your train, or ii
your article is declined, or if your
bootlace breaks, all you have to do is
to drop one of these little bombs on
the floor and it says the word for
you, saving you all further trouble.
The Post Office also is kindly sup-
plying the lady clerks at the counters
with "Civility" bombs. Rush of
business has hitherto prevented these
fair servants of the public from doing
themselves justice, but it will be the
easiest thing in the world to throw a

Then she remembers she 's only half

with Madame Blag-

can't. Then they all

the curtain falls on

much of by everyone, and gave little
sermon-lectures at people's houses.
Converts are cropping up every day.

from the Stores to make it complete.
The man brought him, put him
among the bergs, and gave him some-
thing to keep him quiet. When
people came they were quite en-
chanted with such a nicky idea for a
hot afternoon, though, of course,
there are always some who are too
jealous and envious to praise you for
anything. MELANIE and her Comte
were particularly charmed. If people
felt uncomfy with the heat, all they
had to do was to look at the bear and
the bergs and they were cool again.
Presently, however (whether the man
hadn't given him enough stuff, or
whether the bergs weren't cold enough
for him, or the noise of our chatter
bothered him, I can't say), the bear
began to get lively and to move about
and look through at us with the
dearest, angriest little eyes. He
looked particularly hard at Aunt
GOLDIE, and she screamed and rushed
to another part of the room, anc
then everyone began to get so jumpy
and MELANIE'S "Tiens!" got so lou<
and shrill, that I had to send for th<
man, who gave him some more stuff
and he settled down among the bergi
again and was a good, sedate bea:
and part of the picture.
This, my dear, if you want t<
know, is a ribbon summer, and it 'i
correct to be very lively. Ribboni
and liveliness always go together
and lace and languor. Which ii
cause and which effect, whether it 'i
the ribbons that produce livelinesi
or the liveliness that expresses itsel
in ribbons, I 'm not here to tell you
as they say in the House.
Darling Pompom has been feelinj
a wee bit used up and run dowi
lately, so I 've sent him to do a curi
at a Doggie's Home of Rest a littli
way in the country—not too far fo
his loving mother to motor down an<
see him often. Already the fresh air
early hours and simple life are givinj
Ihe sweet mite the bloom of hi;
puppy hood again.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
"TRAIN up a child in the way that he should go, and
when he is old he will not depart from it." Those, I
believe, were the words of Solomon the Wise, who was
once a boy himself, and is reputed to have had several
|children of his own. In'The Pedestal (CHAPMAN &
iHALL), Mr. DESMOND COKE gives us the converse of the
j proposition. Neglect your child for the pleasures of
Society while he is in the nursery, and selfishly spoil
'him in his early boyhood, and when at last you briug
yourself to send him to school he is bound to come to
: grief. Sir BERNARD FOTHEKGILL succeeded the late
baronet at the early age of seven, and his decline and
;fall dated from the moment when his father's sudden
: death in the hunting-field made him his repentant
i mother's idol. At school he made friends with a rather
hopeless sort of cousin, and, to help him out of a diffi-
culty connected with the house cash-box, consented to
go into the dressing-
room and '' borrow
some money from
"the big fellows'
bags." Of course he
was caught in the
act, and of course he
nobly declined to
give away "the
other fellow," and of
course his heroic re-
serve was regarded
by his foolish mother
as the stubbornness
of guilt, till his com-
parative innocence
was triumphantly
e s t a b lished. Mr.
COKE knows a good
deal about boys,
though I don't think
that in this respect
The Pedestal comes
up to The Bending of
a Twig. But to
those of you who are mothers (as the College Don
said when he preached one of his old village-sermons to
an audience of undergraduates) I commend it as a
solemn and salutary warning. The Parents' National
Education Union ought certainly to put it on their list of
useful publications.
The strife ensuing when passion twists
The steeled nerve-tissues of scientists—•
ARTHUR APPLIN depicts complete
In his novel The Butcher of Bruton Street.
The book (GRANT RICHARDS) is made to present
Three clear types of medical gent;
Two are pleasant enough to meet;
The third is the Butcher of Bruton Street.
There 's old Pill Brown, who 's a bland G.P.;
There 's Janson, who can't stand surgery;
And he who is loved of the great elite,
Haigg, the Butcher of Bruton Street.
Each is lured by the selfsame maid;
Each pursues in his way his trade—
Janson, reformer; Brown, discreet;
And knife-'em-all Haigg of Bruton Street.
Mingling human traits with the set
Demands of medical etiquette.
Partly a treatise, partly a treat
Is the tale of The Butcher of Bruton Street.
In One City and Many Men (SMITH, ELDER) are set
forth in pleasant, chatty form memories of olden times
by one who has discovered the secret of perennial youth.
Sir ALGERNON WEST'S recollections go back to the early
days of Queen VICTORIA'S reign. After serving under Sir
CHARLES WOOD when that forgotten statesman was at
the India Office, he was Private Secretary to Mr. GLAD-
STONE throughout his most momentous Premiership.
Succeeding to the Chairmanship of the Board of Inland
Revenue, he had tha opportunity of studying Lord
RANDOLPH CHURCHILL at close quarters, and givrg some
interesting particulars of his brief tenure of the Chancel-
lorship of the Exchequer. Much has been written about
_ Mr. GLADSTONE. His
former secretary and
friend adds precious
material to common
knowledge. One of
the most charming
chapters in a book
of unfailing interest
is descriptive of a
walk through dc-
serted London,

THE EGOIST IN THE GARDEN.
'CONFOUND TOU, SIR! JUST LOOK AT MY CUCUMBER FRAME!
which Sir ALGER-
NON'S memory and
fancy people with a
crowd of interesting
wraiths.
I have long held
the conviction that,
owing to no fault of
its own, the most
disorderly word in
the English language
is " only." More fre-
quently than any
other it is misplaced.
The impression is confirmed by a sentence in a book other-
wise blameless in the matter of style. "I was," Sir
ALGERNON writes, "only born on the day of the Reform
Bill passing." Why this petulant complaint? Did he
expect to be also christened and married? However,
the reader will rejoice that he was at least born, since
he has lived to give the world this delightful book.
The graceful and allusive writer on the open air is
always with us; but we do not know of any English
hand now executing this pleasant task better than Mr.
BEACH THOMAS, author of From a Hertfordshire Cottage
(ALSTON RIVERS). His knowledge of natural history and
his memory of what other men have said of natural
history—both poets and scientific writers—are about
equal, and they see-saw very agreeably through the
book. Mr. THOMAS, I think, makes a mistake in with-
holding the names of his poets as often as he does,
especially as he seems to have explored the less known
lyrics more than most. I like to find again Sir EDWARD
GREY'S remark that to hear the first song in early spring
of any bird is "better than a personal success." Not
bad for a Cabinet Minister.

DO MANAGERS READ PLAYS?
Mr. Punch is under an impression that the following
letters were intended rather to reach the Editor of The
Daily Mail than himself, but he h^s decided to print
thorn, if only as a warning to correspondents to be more
careful how they address their communications.
SIR,—As the author of several plays, none of which
has hitherto been produced, I have for some time
suspected that the malingers cannot have rend a single
MS. I submitted to them. Wishing to satisfy myself on
Uiis point, I recently exposed a leading actor-manager
(whoso name I mercifully refrain from giving) to the
following test. I sent him a Three Act Society Comedy
entitled All Sorts, the first Act of which consisted of the
Second Book of Euclid, with the figures and lettering
omitted, and the text cut up and assigned to various
dramatis pcrsonte. The Second Act was extracted from
the Anglo-Portuguese Phrase Book, while the Third was
composed of several pages from last year's Academy
Catalogue, arranged in dialogue form.
After waiting three weeks, it was returned to me with
all the courtesy of postal registration and a printed
notice stating that, after careful consideration,
.Mr. regretted that the play I had been kind enough
to submit to him was not calculated, in his opinion, to
prove suitable to the tastes of his audiences. Which was
exactly what he had said of all the plays I had sent
him previously. Comment is superfluous!
JUSTUS ET TENAX.
Sin,—I know that Managers do not read plays—at all
events, not my plays—and I am in a position to prove
that this is so. A short time ago, stung to indignation
by the specious—I will not say hypocritical—excuses
with which a certain Manager (to whom I had the
advantage of a letter of introduction from one of the
greatest living authorities on Metric Craniology) had
rejected several dramatic works on which I had
expended both time and thought, I hit upon a plan
to expose such insincerity as it deserved. I prepared
three Acts in the regulation brown-paper covers, each of
which bore the title "Sold !" but contained nothing
but blank sheets. These I forwarded to his private
address, with a note bogging him to read the piece as
soon as possible and let me know exactly what he
thought. Within three weeks I received an answer which
I cannot resist quoting in full. Here it is: —
"Dear Mr. PULLKGG,—I have at last found leisure to
look at ' Sold,' and hasten to offer you my sincere con-
gratulations on a work which strikes mo as an immense
advance on anything of yours which 1 have yet had the
pleasure of seeing. While it possesses all the qualities
that distinguished your earlier efforts, it is richer, it
seems to me, in incident and character, and more tell-
ing in dialogue. I like, too, the manner in which you
have contrived to preserve your secret right up to the
denoument. The only consideration which prevents me
from accepting it for immediate production is that,
unfortunately, it is too much in the nature of a ' problem
play' to be quite suitable to my theatre. I therefore
return it with many thanks for submitting a piece in
which, believe me, I sec nothing but promise.
Yours very sincerely,
GRANVII.LE STUART HARRIMAN."
Perhaps it is a little too bad to pillory him like this—
but he has brought it on himself, and will, I trust, have
sufficient sense of humour to smile at the neatness with
which ho has been entrapped.

(Author of "Refused a Hearing," "How Long?"
"While you Wait," etc., etc.)
SIR,—I see that there is a correspondence in your
columns on the question whether Managers are lax or
otherwise in reading plays that are submitted to them,
so possibly your readers may be interested by a
recent experience of my own. As I was doing up a Five-
Act Drama, with a view to posting it to a certain brilliant
and popular comedy actress, it suddenly occurred to me
that I could easily detect whether she had read it all
through or not by inserting a dead cockroach (which I
procured without difficulty from the kitchen) between
the last and penultimate pages. After some months
had passed in absolute silence, I thought it advisable to
write to the lady once more. At last I received a reply,
in which she stated as her reasons for finding the play
unsuitable, that the principal character in it was lacking
in vitality and too unsympathetic to be popular on the
stage. She also objected to the death scene in the last
Act as being both " dry and flat." As a matter of fact
none of the characters died in any of the Acts, while it
is significant that the body of the cockroach was in
precisely the same place and position as when I
dispatched my MS. I am afraid, Sir, that these facts
admit of but one inference!
INDIGNANT PLAYWRIGHT.

"BRITISH HOSPITALITY."—This appeal for funds for
the entertainment of foreign competitors in the Olympic
Games is, as you say, a little sudden and hasty, seeing
that the authorities must have guessed, several years
ago, that somebody was sure to want to come and com-
pete. Still, if I were you, I should invite them to use
your half-crown at once, and not put it out at com-
pound interest against the next reception of the kind,
sixty years hence. For by that time Mr. HALDANE may
have collected all the Territorials he has advertised for,
and the Government should have greater leisure for deal-
ing with the more peaceful forms of invasion.
In The Daily Mail Signer BONCI instructs aspiring
singers as follows: —
"Take a deep breath, extending tlio diaphragm lo its fullest extent;
next exhale slowly, pressing from the bottom of the lungs, drawing
t!.e diajliragin inwards to commence witli and upwards to finish,"
A common fault, he complains sadly, is that many
beginners will press out the bottom of the lungs against
the diaphragm. What can you do with people like
that? They don't deserve to have a diaphragm at all.
"A deafening shout preeted the spectacle of Mr. Balfour, wearing a
hat much too small for him."—Daily Neics, p. 8, col. 4.
"Mr. Balfour borrowed the hat of Mr. Alex Cross. It was too big
for him."—Daily A'eira, p. 8, col. 1.
A careful editor would have hedged in a leader.
Describing the preparations outside the Town Hall for
the Royal visit to Leeds, The Yorkshire Post says: —
"The lions on either side will have a setting of Scotch furs."
This must be the result of the agitation against the un-
clothed Strand statues.

THE TENANTS' BALL.

OOT NO NAILS IS MY BOOTS."
THE PROPOSED NEW RULES OF COLF.
THE Secretary of the Royal and
Ancient and Modern Golf Club has
very courteously submitted to us a
few amendments to the New Rules of
Golf. These amendments remove all
possibility of ambiguity or miscon-
struction. The first deals with the
two octavo volumes containing Rule
27 relating to " casual water."
If a ball lie or be lost in casual
water through the green (whether the
bull lie in the casual water or not), or
if the water lie or be lost in the
groen through a casual ball, or if
the player's stance interferes with
the casual water, then the player
may either drop the casual water
within two club lengths of the
margin of the ball, keeping the green
where the margin crossed the ball in
a line between himself and the
nearest available bunker, or he may
drop the bunker either in the hole or
any place mentioned above within
two casual water lengths from the
margin of the ball nearest the casual
water where the bunker lay,
except as otherwise provided for in
these rules. But if, when the player
has dropped the casual water (for
dropping casual water see under
section xix., sub-section xi.), it lie so
as to interfere with the margin of the
player, or if the bunker when dropped
roll into the ball, or if the stance
when dropped interferes with the
player's casual bunker, then the
player may re-drop the hole two ball-
lengths from the casual water and
play the bunker from where it lies.
But if it be found impossible to
play the casual water from where it
lias been dropped, then the player
shall with respect to
Section xix. Drop the casual water
further from the hole than the
margin at which the hole entered
the spot.
Sections xx. and xxi. Drop either
himself or the hole as near the
ball as the stance will admit, but
no nearer the casual water.
The penalty for breach of this rule
shall be disqualification.
Another amendment (to Rule 50)
provides an alternative method of
dropping a ball.
"A ball shall be dropped in either
one of the following two ways :- -
(i.) It shall be dropped; or
(ii.) It shall be dropped."
An amendment to Rule 107
(" Playing a moving ball ") runs as
follows:—
"A player shall not play while his
ball is moving (for ' moving ball ' see
definition 10, k) except in the case of
a moving ball (Rule 106), a teed ball
(Rule 175), a ball in water (Rule 583,
section vi. b), or a ball in casual
water in a hazard (Rule 1004). If the
ball begin to move immediately it
has been played (see Vol. ix., Rule
35, section xi.) he shall incur no
penalty for causing it to move, but
he shall not be exempt from any
penalty he may have incurred under
Rule 56 B or Rule 1058 (section iv.,
footnote), or any other rule."
Finally we have an amendment to
Rule 2001 ("Disputes"):-—
"A dispute shall be settled by an
umpire or referee except in the case
of
(i.) Player's ball from the tee
striking opponent.
(ii.) Player driving into the couple
behind.
For the purpose of this rule a
niblick shall not be regarded as an
Umpire or Referee."

AN OUTSIDER'S HENLEY.
"WHAT does it mean," I asked,
"when it says that the coxswain's
weight in the programme is the
actual weight carried, inclusive of
dead weight (if any)?"
"I don't know," said Miss
MiDDLETON.
'Oh, but I thought you knew
everything."
"Everything except that."
I sighed and returned to my pro-
gramme.
"There 's going to be a race in
half an hour," I said. "At least
I hope so."
"There was one half an hour
ago," said Miss MIDDLETON. "Don't
be greedy." She yawned gently
and put her sunshade up.
"If I had known," I went on,
looking round the enclosure, "that
everybody would have been wearing
a blue coat and a pink tie, I would
have worn them myself. When in
IJorne"
"You 're nil right," said Miss
MIDDLETON. "I say, there 's a man
with an evening paper. Do go and
ask him how many HuTcnjsaa. has
made."
"My good girl, this is a regatta.
We am surrounded by rowing blue:;
and ninth men; in fact, I suppose
that I am the only man here who has
never been to Mortlake. And you
want me to go up to a perfect
stranger, and ask him Why,
it's absurd. Now if it were a ques-
tion of sliding seats"
"I should think they 'd bo glad
to get away from shop for a little."
"I don't think they are," I said
reflectively. "No, I don't think so.
I may be wrong, but I fancy that if
on the third day of Henley you went
up to a man who was wearing a Cam-
bridge blazer, an Old Etonian tie,
Leander socks, and Hall trousers,
and talked to him about ice-hockey,
I fancy that he would not respond
too readily. ... Or else he ivouhl
respond too readily."
Miss MIDDLETON got up un-
decidedly. "If you 're frightened,
I '11 ask him myself," she said.
She walked away a few steps, and
then came back and sat down again.
"Bother, I 'm frightened too," oho
said. "It's the heat."
1 looked round to see that nobody
was listening. Then I leant across
to her.
"To tell the truth," I whispered,
I 've fairly lost my nerve. There
aro too many aquatic celebrities
about. In a little while I shall
begin to regret that I have wasted so
much time playing cricket when I
might have been learning to row."
"Oh! hush," said Miss MIDDLE-
TON.
"No, it hasn't quite got to that
yet, but very nearly. We must be,
careful."
"We ought never to have come."
"I think you 're right. But now
we are here let us be reasonable.
From a rowing point of view we arc
infants compared with all these
people, but wo may know more about
other things."
"Of course we do. Oh for just
one moment with a Lacrosse blue."
"How we would clasp him by the
hand, and talk to him of bases," I
sighed.
"Or even a reserve at chess."
'' That we might prattle together
about revokes."
"Perhaps it would be better if we
went out on to the tow-path for a
bit."
"I expect they 'd ho even more
nautical there."
"They couldn't be," said Miss
MIDDLETON. "Let 's try."
The tow-path was crowded and
hot and noisy. Everybody looked
hot, but the hottest of them all was
a man who was soiling extremely
-.mail and fragile-looking chairs for
one-and-sixpenco. "As patronised
by Royalty," he told us. Well,
they could only have been patronised
once each.
"lie is a nice man," I said to Miss
MIDDLETON, "and I like his face.
Moreover he is the first person we
have spoken to who never got his
blue. Shall we have a chair?"
"Of course wo must. . . Oh, look,
here 's another man who wasn't a
blue. I wonder what made him
think of selling penny rows of beads.
Do you have to have them when you
row ?''
"It is a question of taste. Some
do and some don't. I think we must
have some beads. . . Only a penny?
Thank you."
We pushed along towards the
bridge.
"This is much jollier, isn't it?"
said Miss MIDDLETON. "I feel we
really are doing it in style now. One
of those, yellow ducks, and I shan't
ho afraid of anybody."
"A duck is certainly more in onr
line. . . We want a yellow duck,
please. One-and-sixpence? Oh,
that's absurd."
You can get a real duck for onc-
and-suxpence," put in Miss MIDDLE-
TON. "One to eat, I mean."
"You can get a chair for one-and-
sixpence," I told the man severely,
"or eighteen rows of blue beads.
Of course if you won't take
less"
"Think of a chair," pleaded Miss
MIDDLETON. "How much more
comfortable than a yellow duck."
"Think of eighteen rows of blue
beads. A whole costume at the
Palace."
"It isn't as if we really wanted a
yellow duck," said Miss MIDDLETON.
"We could get on quite well without
one. In fact we have, so far."
"It isn't as if we really had one-
and-sixpence left," I said, suddenly
examining my pockets. "Speaking
for myself we have only one and
threepence and two stamps."
"I 've got a shilling."
"In that case," I said to the
man, "perhaps we might pay your
ruinous and extortionate charge, if
you 're quite sure he '11 waggle his
head just as well away from
home. Sometimes, you know, with
strangers"
"Why, there 's a paper boy,"
cried Miss MIDDLETON.
"Wait a bit. If we get a paper
and a yellow duck, that will leave
us with eightpence and two stamps.
Now, is there anything we can get
with eightpence and two stamps'.'"
We could get eight postcards of
the course and send off four of
them."
"Then we shouldn't have a penny
for a pencil, and we couldn't send
them off if we hadn't a pencil."
"Well, then, six postcards and
another row of beads, and a
pencil •
"That will only leave us with one
postcard each. You know we
never ought to have bought that
chair. Would you," I said to the
man, "like to purchase a small
chair? As patronised by Royalty.
You may have it for one and five
ponce. Or we would exchange it for
a duck, and send you one of the post-
cards when we get back to London."
"We would, faithfully," said Mir:;
MIDDLETON.
"Or I have another idea. We
might "Dang!
"What's that?" cried Mie:;
MIDDLETON.
"I wonder," I said. "I '11 ask

I came back to her with a paper.
"Kent, 290 for 2," I said. "Isn't
it splendid'.'"
"Oh, the dears! Did he tell
you what the bang was for?"
"Oh—only another race begin-

AURORA BOREALIANA.
MANY gentlemen who dined sump-
tuously last Wednesday evening and
on their homeward way remarked
certain celestial phenomena, were
greatly relieved on Thursday morn-
ing to read in their newspapers of
tho Aurora Borealis.
The Aurora Borealis is not fre-
quently seen in this country. As its
name implies, it hails from a foreign
land. There is only one way of
spelling it, but a certain amount of
latitude is permitted in the matter of
pronunciation.
Like many of our leading actresses,
to be seen at its best it should be
observed in its home life, which is
lived modestly and far from the
madding crowd up among the polar
bears and the eternal ice and the
eternal polar expeditions.
The visit of the Aurora Borealis
last week was partly due to com-
passion for a people sick to death of

Woman's Suffrage antics, though its
chief object, of course, was to enable
Londoners to read The Evening News
at midnight without the aid of arti-
ficial light.
The Anti-Suffrage movement is
growing rapidly. A plan of cam-
paign will shortly be completed, and
will include some novel forms of
demonstration. Tho more active
supporters of the movement are
arranging to attend the meetings of
the Suffragists, and to take their
babies with them for the purpose of
interruption.
Tho official declaration that mem-
bers of the Woman's Suffrage Society
are never guilty of unladylike con-
duct has given general satisfaction,
indicating as it does that tho actual
members are much fewer in number
than was generally supposed.

She. Well, you might do something by way of a
change. We shall never get one if we both stand like
a block of marble. Here 's another.
[A taxi-cab approaches rapidly. She waves her
parasol with vigour. In the cab is a fat man wear-
ing a Panama. He blows a kiss in response to the
parasol as he is ivhirled past.
She. Well, / / .'
He (furious). There you are. That 's what comes of
it. Perhaps you '11 believe me another time.
She. You never told me there was a fat man in the
cab, and you never even hinted he was going to

He. Going to blow you a kiss? No, I didn't; but
we '11 let the hideous past bury its hideous ones. Of
course, he thought from the way you went on that you
were recognising him.
She (in a loud tone of tragic solemnity, aside). I must
dissemble. (To him) CHARLES, I adjure you by the
memory of the happy days we have spent together, by
our home and our children, do not let one light act on my
part (She turns away. Sobs choke her utterance.)
He. Oh, you may wave at all the fat men in London
if you like. (Another taxi-cab approaches swiftly. He
darts fonvard.) Hi ! Hi!
[The cab passes. From within it a resplendent lady in
green silk withers him with a look as she flashes
by.
She. I 'm afraid it isn't one of your lucky days, dear,
But, do tell me, who was that swcei thing in green with
the mauve complexion?
He (ignoring the taunt). We shall have to chuck it.
Let 's take a four-wheeler.
She. Never. A hansom I wouldn't mind.
He. And a hansom I won't have. I 'm not a coward
really, but I draw the line at hansoms.
[A third taxi-cab suddenly drops from the sky or rises
from the boivcls of the earth. They both rush at
it. It is empty. They engage it, give an address,
and enter it.
He. Got it at last.
She. Yes, my brave husband got it all by his own
self. Oh, what an enviable woman 1 (In alarm)
What is he doing?
[The driver having extended a warning arm, the taxi
grunts violently and begins to back. A motor-bus
comes to a standstill within an inch of a collision.
An exchange of amenities follows between the taxi-
driver and the busman. Finally the taxi is turned,
grunts again and proceeds.
He. A pretty near thing that.
She. He 's going much too fast. Why, we 're half-
way up Bond Street already. Oh, oh! Tell me when
it 's over. (She covers her face with her liands as the
taxi skims round a furniture van, dodges a victoria and
avoids a Yorkshire terrier by a hair's-breadth.) Are we
safe?
He. Don't know. I can't bear to look.
She. Well then I must. (She uncovers her face.)
Stop! Stop! He's done it this time. No, we 're
through. Oh! Let me out.
He. It 'B no good. We 're in for it, and we 'vc got
to go through with it. Oh, dash it, this is beyond a
joke. (The taxi swings round a corner. He is
precipitated against her. There is a sliglit crash.)
There goes your parasol. I 'm awfully sorry. Couldn't
help it. He 's bound to bag that old woman. No, by
Jove, missed her!
She. CHARLES, if I die first, which I shall certainly do
in another minute, promise me (The taxi stops with
some suddenness. His hat falls off.) Oh, never mind
your hat at such an awful moment. Let 's get out
quick and run away. (The gears groan again and the
taxi goes on.) Thank Heaven, the street 's clear for a
bit. (.4 hansom emerges from a side street, but stops
just in time.) That was terrible. My mind 's giving
way.
He. Mine 's gone. There are two buses, a broughnm

we might No, we 've escaped again. (Wildly.)
Where are we? Why don't we get there, '.' Where are
we going? (Suddenly they arrive at their destination.
They get out hurriedly, pay the man, and enter a shop.
Having made their purchases they emerge.)
She (hesitatingly). Shall we take a four-wheeler?
He (with determination). No, not even that. We '11
walk. (They do.)
BOMBS FOE WOMEN!
"Is this Russia, or England?" a delightful lady-
martyr indignantly inquired lust Tuesday on being
arrested for merely putting some "good big stones"
through Mr. ASQUITH'S front-door panes and tripping
up f: constable—after which she uttered the portentous
threat, " it will be bombs next time!
It is reassuring to learn that, even should the action
of the Government unfortunately necessitate a resort to
such extreme measures, little or no inconvenience will
be occasioned thereby to the general public. The
bombs will bo hurled with the same perfect good-
huii'our and absence of all personal animus that have
characterised all previous demonstrations. They will
be so constructed as not to injure any genuine
sympathiser with the Cause in the very least, while they
will not hurt anybody really seriously, as they will con-
tain nothing but a little picric acid and a few safety
pins. There is a suggestion for including asafcetida
in cases where the bomb is intended for delivery
within the private residence of a Cabinet Minister; but
even this the softer-hearted Suffragists arc in favour
of tempering with a drop or two of attar-of-roses. In
every detail there will be the note of daintiness and
good-taste which is so essentially feminine. For
instance, the bombs will be manufactured in four Art
shades—fawn, pastel-blue, mouse-grey, and old rose,
with purple, white, and green ribbon attachment for
slinging. A special line of "Dorothy" bomb-bags, in
assorted colours and three sizes, to contain three, five,
or seven bombs as required, will shortly be put on the
market, and should find a ready sale. Of course, if such
moderate and dignified measures as those fail to con-
vince the Nation of the justice of the Women's Cause
there is no saying what they may-not have to do. But,
for the present at all events, they are determined to
observe the greatest self-restraint, and even such op-
ponents as Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD will be blown up as
humanely and inoffensively as possible.

Miss CALLIRRHOE POBBLE, who is
to give a series of Maeso-Gothie

of a Patagonian wool-broker who
amassed a fortune in the early sixties
and lost it a few years later. Miss
POBBLE had the misfortune, while
dancing before the DALAI LAMA last
year, to be afflicted with frost-bite,
in consequence of which she lost all
her toes. This disaster, fortunately,
has had no effect on her saltatory
efficiency, which, in the opinion of
several Cabinet Ministers, is of the
highest order. During her stay in
London, Miss POBBLE will be the

one ex-Premier, two Deans, and
seventeen Archdeacons.

LADIES, would you lovely be?

Shine resplendent with its aid—
Beauty is not born, but made.
Would you have a skin of silk
Winter than the, morning milk,
Cucumber and lemon too—
These must yield their juice for you.
When upon your couch you lie,
Place a slice on either eye;
Place on cheek and brow and chin
Slices exquisitely thin.
Through the night-time, close at
hand
Let your watchful handmaid stand,
Ever prompt to change the pieces
As their healing coolness ceases.
Nor should bathing be forgot;
But, instead of " cold " and " hot,"
On your taps the words be placed,
Lemon," "Cucumber" and
"Waste."
All this thought and all this care
Mean incessant mental wear,
Endless planning, few delights,
Strenuous days and strenuous nights.
So, in order that the brain
May not yield beneath the strain,
Once in every week a day
Must in resting pass away.
Rest your limbs and eyes awhile,
Rest, oh, rest the wrinkling smile;
Frowns and crowsfeet come from
thought;
Rest your mind and think of naught.
Hard the life, severe your part;
Yet let this make glad your heart—
If for others thus we slave
Wept and honoured is our grave.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June
29.—Ireland has a fresh grievance.
Every prospect of University Bill
passing, and so happily closing con-
troversy that has for half a century
hampered higher education. But the
strawberries served ut tea on the
Terrace are small in portion whilst
the price is high. To-day Whip of the
Nationalist Party, "rising in his
place," as the papers say (as if it
were his habit to rise in somebody
else's), solemnly put Chairman of
Kitchen Committee to the question.
"What," he asked, "was the
market price of strawberries per
pound in London last week'.'what
was the price per pound paid by the
Kitchen Committee? und what was
the price per pound charged by the
Kitchen Committee for the same
strawberries when doled out at tea
on the Terrace?"
With trembling hand JACOBY pro-
duced from coat-tail pocket the small
hand-glass that serves him for
monocle. In solitude of his chamber
had prepared written answer to
terrible charges involved in interro-
gation citod. He might have taken
refuge in refusal to give particulars,
PAT O'BRIEN isn't an Income Tax
Commissioner authorised to inquire

the Chairman of the Kitchen Com-


mittee be
upon to

called
];ive up
the secrets of that
remote chamber?
Scorning a n y-
thing that might
have appearance of
evasion or flight,
JACOBY had drafted
a document making
full disclosure of
innocent commer-
cial transaction.
Extraordinary in-
cident threatened
to prevent its being
reud. This one of
the hottest days of
ft quite decent
summer. Through
the open windows
a shaft of sunshine
fell upon the slim
figure of the Kit-
chen Chairman. It
struck full on the
hand-glass placed
over the manu-
script with intent to
make its lettering
clear. As JACOBY cleared his throat
and looked round at the expectant
throng that was eager to see how he
would emerge from this difficulty, a
curl of light smoke uprose. The sun,
playing through the convex glass of
the Chairman's eye-opener, was burn-
ing the paper. With great presence of
mind JACOBY shifted his position; the
danger passed before more than one-
half of the onlookers perceived it.
"The charge for a portion of straw-
berries served on the Terrace large
enough for two" (.JACOBY really
meant the portion of strawberries,
not the Terrace), "including cream
and sugar, is l.s. Or," he added,
throwing back his head arid regarding
the House with proud air of conscious
innocence, "sixpence per head. The
market price," he continued, "varies
according to size and quality. The
Kitchen Committee purchase the best
selected fruit, as large in the lowest
strata as they are on the top. They
pay 8rf. a pound."
This straightforward and satisfac-
tory. But the Chairman, an old cam-
paigner, kept the best news to the
last. "From to-day," he said, or

almost chanted, "the charge of one
shilling per portion will be reduced to
eightpence."
A wild cheer went up in crowded
House. The Chairman of the
Kitchen Committee carefully replaced
the round hand-glass in his coat-tail
pocket, resumed his seat and mopped
his brow. The House, its anxieties
relieved, its spirits raised in propor-
tion to the lowering of the price
per plate of strawberries, forthwith
turned its attention to Old Age Pen-
sions Bill.
Business done.—With assistance of
Closure, third clause of Bill carried
in Committee.
Tuesday.—Curious to note how
evil communications corrupt good
manners. Outside, a jeering multi-
tude roars with delight as individuals
among organised mob of women
clamouring for the suffrage dash
themselves against the wall of police'
and are haled off to prison, suddenly
serene with the consciousness that
their names will be " in the papers."
Inside, hour follows hour of dull de-
bate in Committee on Old Age Pen-
sions Bill. At half-past ten Member:;
noted with chaste pleasure the signal
for the Closure and so home to bed
through the cool air of the summer
night.
Suddenly tumult arose; echo of
that dying away in the streets.
According to rules, when the guillo-
tine is in operation, only amendments
put down by the Government after
duo notice may be dealt with. One
submitted just now required verbal
alteration. Was it in order to deal
with it? SON STEWART BOWLES on
his legs said "No." SON AUSTEN,
seated with hi:; hut on, agreed. Lord
BOB, not inclined to be overlooked in
obscurity of back seat, wildly waved
his arms and shouted, "Point of
Order!" CHAIRMAN insisted that
notice had been duly given. Amid
the uproar EMMOTT kept his head,
and division went forward.
Then someone discovered that door
to Opposition Lobby had been locked
earlier than that through which
trooped the Ministerial horde. And
this a so-called free country! SON
AUSTEN, having tasted blood (with
his hat on), asked for more. PRINCE
ARTHUR suggested that a fresh divi-
sion should be taken. Shouts arose for
"Mr. SPEAKER! Mr. SPEAKER!" In
the uproar a shrill but irrelevant cry
of " Votes for Women! " came unrc-
buked through Ladies' Grill.
On division it turned out that
Opposition were 31 strong all told.
378 voted for the amendment. An-
nouncement of numbers suggested
there would be a rush for cabs.
Dash for door accordingly made;
tumult subsided as rapidly as it
burst forth.
Business done.—Getting on with
Old Age Pensions Bill.
Thursday. —Present Government

faithful, carries all before it. Also

acts. Members turning over fresh
leaves of Orders of the Day come
upon detailed proposals for closuring
by compartments standing in name of
noble lord.
"And what do you think of my
plan?" he asked, gazing with
parental pride on the entry.
"It is perhaps a little lavish in
allotment of time," I said. "Fifty
days for Committee is a large order.
Did it ever occur to you that
your action might have fatal conse-
quences upon prospects of the Bill
passing this Session? In due course
Ministers will give notice of their
intention to put in practice a scheme
of Closure. According to strict inter-
pretation of the Standing Order, your
resolution appearing on the paper
stops the way. It is, in brief, what is
called a blocking motion."
"Dear me," murmured Lord BOB,
looking genuinely distressed, "you
don't mean to say so? What a
weary world it is in which an honest
desire to help a Government should
turn out to be what in blank verse
is called a stab in the back."
His poignant emotion touching.
Yet he has been in House long
enough to know the result of his well-
meant interference.

Of all the distinctions at disposal of
the SOVEREIGN, this the most envi-
able. It sufficed PEEL to the end of
his life. GLADSTONE, thrice declining
an earldom, was content to follow
the example set by his great master.
It was only under pressure of old age
and the influence of fading faculties
that the Right Hon. BENJAMIN
DISRAELI descended to the style of
Earl BKACONSFIELP.
The Chair of Committees is the
most trying post in the House of
Commons. Armed with less autho-
rity than the SPEAKER, unsustained
by the state of canopied chair, the
dignity of wig and gown, its occupant
has a more difficult part to play.
Mr. EMMOTT, coining fresh to the
position, a comparatively young
Member, has conducted himself with
a patience, urbanity and impartiality
that have won respect and esteem in
both politicarcamps.
Business done.—Private mem-

ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN.
MR. ROOSEVELT is to signalise his
retirement from office, and conse-
quent liberty to travel, by a great
hunting tour in Africa with his
eldest son, in search of big game.
He is to describe his triumphs in a
series of articles in Collier's Weekly,
for which he will receive the sum of
£20,000.
Obviously these articles will not
be in the least like those which are
printed bolovv, but Mr Punch has
to fill his pages somehow. Doing
that is his big game.
The African Jungle,
April 1, 1009.
We are now right in the thick of
the strenuous life, after a very
tedious time on board ship, where
there is little or nothing to kill. We
organised a few rat hunts, it is true,
and though some thousands' fell to
my six-shooter, it is not very excit-
ing sport, nor for big game very good
practice; and we had some fun with
a shoal of porpoises • that followed
the ship, and of which I succeeded
in bagging four. NICHOLAS also got
an albatross, the wings of which he
is sending home for ALICE'S new
matinee hat; but altogether life was
tame.
Now, however, that wo are once
more on land, and in the exhilarat-
ing vicinity of wild beasts, our
hearts again begin to beat and our
veins to throb.
The photographers arc getting
their cameras in order, and the re-
porters sharpening their pencils, and
we begin to-morrow in earnest.
Our rifles are, perhaps, worth
describing at this point. My own
are old and trusted friends, with n
few larger and more powerful
new weapons for local contingencies.
I have, for example, a largo bore
rifle for elephants, rhinos, and hippos.
For the swifter or morev elusive
game, such as the giraffe or okapi,
I have a smaller bored and longer-
ranged rifle. For lions a special brand
has been built for me. The other

is also well fixed up with a variety of
rifles, and so is my eldest son. The
other children have weapons accord-
ing to their ability—good enough to
make a decent hole in God's
creatures, any way, if not absolutely
deadly.
Camp Cortclyou,
April 2.
We have had a busy and useful
day. I selected with great care an
open space, where the cameras
would have a good view of all of us
and where there were easily-climbed
trees for the reporters and descriptive
writers. The natives were then
ordered to drive all the animals they
could find past this clearing, so that
we might practise upon them
and get our eyes in.
Wo were kept pretty
strenuous. I got a mixed bag
of hartebeeste, antelope, and
other small deer, and the
others did fairly well too. I

April 20.
An inhuman brute of a lioness
with cubs dared to make for one of
our party this morning, but we soon
settled her. I never saw a body so
peppered. It is a great pity, as I
wanted to have the skin dressed as
a hearthrug for TAKT.

some miles without food, for we feared
to lose the quarry if we stopped. At
last I glimpsed the gently waving
head of the father above the long
grass, half a mile off. The wind
had changed, and they had given up
all thought of danger.
We crept forward on our stomachs
for another seven hundred yards;
and it was.no joke, I can tell you.
Talk about the strenuous life! But
it was no joke for the giraffes, either,
for we got the lot. I picked off the
mother, NICHOLAS took the father,
and the foal fell to my eldest son. I
never saw a boy so happy! Indeed,
we all were, for it is not an easy
thing to shoot a giraffe; and very soon,
I am told, there will be none left.
Camp Washington,
April 10.
NICHOLAS, who has a pretty turn
have hope. I have never failed
hitherto to kill anything I set my
heart on, and if there is an okapi
left I will get him. The one fear
that keeps rne awake nights is that
the breed will be extinct before I can
reach it—is already extinct! What
a tragedy! Suppose that that one
which the naturalist fellow photo-
graphed was the last, and it has
died since? A terrible thought. I
will get a lion or two to calm my
mind.
Liona are all very well, but we
feel the want of bears. It is a great
defect in Africa that it has no bears.
The jungle is also bad for our
photographers, who have often
missed me completely as I made the
winning shot, owing to scrub and
trees.
Later. Triumph t I have got an
okapi at last. Now it matters no
longer whether they are extinct or
not.

Africa has been splendid, and we
reckon there can be very little big
game left, at any rate in the parts
where we have been. Next year we
shall move on to India, and try to
clear it of tigers.
INSURRECTION IN STOKE
NEWINGTON.
PROMPT ACTION OF NOVELISTS.
A GREAT public meeting of British
novelists was held in Hyde Park last
Saturday to protest against the action
of the local authorities and inhabit-
ants of the North London suburb of
— Stoke Newington. From
statistics which have recently
been published, it appears
that in the public libraries
of that district only 16'3 per
cent, of the books on the
shelves consist of fiction, and
that last year there was a
decrease of 2'498 per cent, in
the number of volumes of
this character issued.
Special trains brought a
large number of provincial
novelists from the kailyard
and other manufacturing
fictional districts, and the
demonstrators marched in
five processions, headed re-
spectively by Mrs. L. T.
MEADE, Mr. W. LE QUEUX,
Mr. ANDREW LORING, the
Baroness ORCZY and Mr. GUY
THORNE, from various out-
lying points to their ren-
dezvous at the eastern end of
the Serpentine. A special
feature of the demonstration was the
lavish use of banners emblazoned
with the names of the most
famous modern novelists, including
THACKERAY, RANGER GULL, GEORGE
ELIOT, ANNIE SWAN, WALTER SCOTT
and SILAS K. HOCKING.
Before proceeding with the formal
business of the meeting, "Rita,"
who presided, read a number of
communications from sympathisers.
Madame CLARA BUTT wrote " Next
to ballads, novels form the most
humanising influence at the com-
mand of modern civilisation. Please
inform your great meeting that I am
no relation whatever of the Newing-
ton Butts."
Mrs. ELINOR GLYN wired the fol-
lowing terrible threat: " Have at once
decided to lay the scene of my next
novel in North London."

The Grand Duke MICHAEL wrote:
"My heart and soul are with my

tho title of my last romance, 1 bid
them 'Never Say Die.''
"Rita" began by observing that
the position of the novelist at the
present moment was exceedingly
precarious, threatened as they were
by the competition of motors,
denunciatory preachers and dancers
If the bad example of Stoke Newing-
ton were to spread, there would be
nothing but old age pensions between
them and destitution. She suggested
that a deputation of novelists should
wait on Mr. ASQUITH without delay to
insist on having the proportion oi
novels in free libraries fixed at a
minimum of 50 per cent.
Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUX said I hut
he thought the time had gone by for
deputations. Force was the only
remedy, and ho was glad to be able
to inform the meeting that the
President of tho Republic of San
Marino had generously offered to
place his entire standing army at the
disposal of the novelists of Great
Britain, if and when they decided to
invade Stoke Newington. Amid loud
cheers Mr. LE QUEUX added that he
was prepared to take command of the
army, which he had known from its
youth up. It was one of the most
picturesque and compact forces in
existence.
The Earl of IDDESLEIGH said that
he thought that, with a Government
so notoriously amenable to agitation,
they could attain their ends without
resort to open violence. Mr.
ASQUITII had said that he had an
open and clastic mind. Ho (Lord
IDDESLKIGH) had calculated that the
total population of Stoke Newington
was considerably less than the num-
bers of the novelists of Great Britain.
It would be perfectly absurd if they
were not able to combine to defeat
this outbreak of local obscurantism.

Mr. HALL CAINE, addressing the
meeting from the summit of the
Albert Memorial through a mega-
phone, was understood to observe
that the reduction in the number of
novels read mattered little if the un-
fit were eliminated and the public
concentrated their attention on works
of real genius.
Mr. HEINEMANX, the famous pub-
lisher, said that he endorsed in toto

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE is an irresistible fascination in Rose Maclcod
(CONSTABLE), by ALICE BROWN, perhaps the most
delightful of living American novelists. One of its
characters is enough by itself to make the book's
reputation. It is that of an adorable old lady (with a
grown-up granddaughter) who writes a book of Recollec-
tions, treating, with allusive, intimacy, of the departed
leaders of various movements in her day, and giving
passages from their letters and private talk. It
creates a vast sensation and she is overwhelmed with
requests for further details. To none of these can she
reply, because all her "recollections" had been simply
faked out of her dear old head, just for joy. Very
attractive, too, is Billy Stark, her
ancient lover, who is for marrying
her with one foot in the grave.
By a most unfortunate coin-
cidence (since plagiarism is out of
the question) there is in this book
a type—the pitilessly immaculate
and self-righteous Elcctra—which
is almost identical with the
Imogen of ANNE SEDGWICK'S
recent novel Valeric Upton;
and, by the further malice of
chance,"both entertain an exalted
infatuation for a philanthropic im-
postor. For the rest the
characters—and notably the im-
postor, a superb creation—are
astonishingly fresh.
The, story's main motive, the
love of a woman for the spiritual
beauty that shines through a
maimed body, is handled with
infinite delicacy of feeling and
fancy. Indeed I have seldom
read a romance in which the
author's insight into unseen
things is more admirably com-
bined with knowledge of the
visible and real. An earlier work,
King's End, had already shown
ALICE BROWN to be possessed of
very unusual gifts. But her pre-
sent book marks a great advance both in ambition and
achievement, and she is now assured of the wide
popularity which she has long ago deserved.
TJic Flemings, by JESSIE and CHARLES FIELDIN.I
MARSH (SMITH, ELDER), contains a warning to young,
struggling artists to be careful whom they marry.
Mary Fleming was a monopolist, and although she
thought, that no sacrifice was too great to make for her
husband, her jealousy of him was abnormal. The
opening scenes of the book, in which the battle of Art
versus Income was fought, are mout ably written, and it
is a pity that this contest was ended by Roger Fleming
inheriting £20,000 a year. For as soon as he becuiM1
rich and gave up all thoughts of painting, he ceased to
be interesting. As a country squire Roger occupied
himself mainly in wanting to be a father, while Mary
disliked the idea of becoming a mother for fear that
children might prevent her from monopolising her hus-
band's love. When a refreshingly frank doctor told
her that she was "a sexless woman" she was silent,
and presently "the conversation drifted into common-
place channels." "If," muttered the doctor, "those
two people are an enigma to a clever man like me, I
wonder what they are to one another!" Unfortunately
they developed into a kind of riddle which wus not worth
wondering about or solving.
The authors know the inside of the artistic world, and
have described its little cliques and quaintnesses with
humour and salience. But The Flemings would have
been a better book if the question of matrimony had
been handled with less insistence.

DDR DOGS SCFFER VERY

Sir EVELYN WOOD tells once more the deathless story
of The Revolt in Hindustan (METHUEN). Here it has the
advantage of being recorded by one who, at the time
a young soldier, rode through the campaign with the
17th Lancers and won the
Victoria Cross. The civilian may
complain that the narrative is
here and there somewhat over-
loaded with detail. For the
military student this will add to
its value. Sir EVELYN is
studiously uncritical of the
powers tha.t were, of their policy
and their action. But of the
inability of some in high com-
mand to read the signs of the
times he gives a notable inci-
dent. At the punishment parade
that preceded the outbreak of
mutiny at Meerut, during the
many hours while the process of
rivetting iron fetters on the ankles
of the malcontents went on, 400
British soldiers, mainly re-
cruits, had only blank cartridge
to their carbines, though they
stood between two Bengal battal-
ions carrying ball ammunition.
Similar banalities were counter-
acted by the generalship of OUT-
RAM, NICHOLSON, HAVELOCK, the
LAWRENCES and other heroes,
supported by the splendid disci-
pline of the rank and file.
MUCH F1IOM THE HOT 1'AVE-
AXD THE ABOVE SUGGESTION,

The plot of A Case for Com-
promise (ALSTON UIVERS) reads to me like a combination
of two Hard Cases from Vanity Fair. Hard Case
No. 1 :—Mr. and Mrs. A. are happily married. Enter
a rascal, B., who points out that Mrs. A. was and still is
his wife. What ought they to do? In Mr. HENRY
STACK'S book Mrs. A. temporarily solves the problem by
declining to live with either of her husbands. She
disappears into the void of London, and puts in rather
a bad time, till she becomes the owner of a smart hut-
shop off Bond Street. Here she is eventually discovered
by A. and B. While she is firmly refusing to share the,
proceeds of the hat-whop with either of them, it turns
out that a friend of hers, Mrs. C., was herself the long-
lost original wife of B. Now what are they all to
do? This is Hard Case No. '2. Mr. STACK'S solution is
a compromise. "Contrary to all the rules of good melo-
drama," said Mrs. C., the wag of the party; "I can
only call it farce." If you feel curious about the com-
promise you should read the book, which is good of its
kind. I 'm not going to give it away.

IT was not until Thursday that I found
the Knight Commander, and as I came
upon him in the smoking-room of one of
our most palatial hotels quite by sur-
prise he had not had time to change
from the mufti in which I found him
into the uniform in which he looks BO
well. However, hia breast glittered
with the many foreign decorations for
which he is famous, and his moustache
was in beautiful condition.
"I fear you were ill last Tuesday,"
I said.
A shadow passed over his face. "No,
I wasn't," he said shortly.
"Not able to get to London in time,
perhaps?" I suggested.
"I have been here ten days," he said,
staring gloomily at the carpet.
"Then why, oh why -"
"It is a painful subject," he said,
interrupting me; "yet I am glad to
have this opportunity of explaining to the
world that it was not my fault. I can't
think what has come over the London
papers—you are tha first journalist to
look me up on this unhappy business.
And unfortunately I have already spent
the fifty guineas which I fully expected
to receive from the Press for 800 words or
so about the ceremony. However, that
cannot be helped now. As I say, it
was not my fault. I came specially to
London in good time, the officials at
Henrietta Street knew I was here and
ready for work, and the Prince himself
was not unacquainted with my presence
and my readiness to be of service. But
they managed without me. Whether
they managed well, I leave it for others
to say"—and he shrugged his shoulders
in quite an Italian way. "I could have
done a good deal for them in one way or
another. I could have covered their
escape by myself posing for the Press
photographers; I could have got the
thing written up well in many of the
leading London and Continental papera;
and I could have driven with them back
to the hotel to lunch afterwards—I could
have done all sorts of things. However,
my services were not required, and
there 's an end of it. Thank you very

NAVY NOTES.
PETTY officers seldom rise to the rank
of Admiral, but the opposite process is
not unknown.
Resignation, in naval affairs, is at
once a temperament and an act. It
becomes the Admiralty in its contempla-
tion of the troubles of life; and it may
be expected at any moment as an act of
grace on the part of one or more of our
Admirals.

hope to have).—The ARTHUR LEE-way.
"Perhaps it is only rowing men who know
the irresistible impulse with which one inter-
rupts a lady's sentence to get on one's legs,
with a lump in the throat, as one' catches the

goes up from the bank. College is cheering

Most unfortunate that the writer should
have selected Christ Church as one of
his colleges, seeing that no Christ Church
"old boy " ever called his boat anything
but "House." But the "flashing sculls"
should have warned the editor that
something was wrong with his corres-
pondent.

THE GERMAN WAITER ONCE MORE.
[The type may be studied at any of the annual dinners that are held
every evening iu the season.]
HE serves the beano night by night,
An alien out of Teuton lands,
With cotton gloves of virgin white
Veiling his vast prehensile hands;
He sees our manhood at its best,
Waits on it where it sits and gorges
Straining its virile lower chest
At annual summer orgies.
The hungry pageants cross his pitch—
Regiment, college, school and corps—-
Leaving him careless which is which
And what on earth we do it for;
Sombre of air, detached of soul,
He hears our speeches, long or terse 'un&,
Content to pouch his paltry dole
Without respect of persons.
We come to fill the yearly void,
Meet a few men of our own time—
Absolute strangers, who enjoyed
No knowledge of us in our prime;
But ever there 's a voice that rings
Familiar with the old attraction: —
"That's all, sir; hope that everything 's
Been to your satisfaction?"
This hint (with variants) he has blown
Into how many a famous ear,
Breathed it to men of taste and tone,
Bishop and actor, bard and peer;
Few mortals in the common ruck
Have met so much of light and leading,
And fewer still have had the luck
To watch the lions feeding.
Their names, however, move him not,
As in and out he deftly trips,
Save as a guarantee of what
They 're good for in the way of tips;
Blind, for the rest, to rank or claim,
Incurious how their gifts are rated,
He serves thorn with the single aim
Which I have indicated.
And yet at times he studies men,
And takes a note of what is said;
Such are the high occasions when
The patriotic feast is spread;
When veterans praise our Briton breed—
"A pretty toughish nut to crack, Sir;
Our little army goes a d—d
Long way, Sir, there and back, Sir."
'Tis then lie dives behind a screen
Where he may chuckle, low and long,
Thinking of camps where he has seen
A nation armed, three million strong;
And slaps his waistcoat, like a man,
Where once the belt confined his tunic,
And drinks to HALDANE'S Army Plan
Deep in a mug of Munich. O. S.

D1SCURSIONS.
A NEW JURISDICTION.
THE Court for the Consideration of Hitherto Unpun-
ishable Offences was busily occupied on Thursday last,
and the proceedings were of great public interest. The
first case on the list was that of an Infinitive, who
complained of having been violently assaulted and
split by JOHN JAMES CROPTIIORNE, described on the
charge-sheet as a poet. The complainant appeared in
tho witness-box in a heavily-bandaged condition, and
gave his evidence under tho stress of great emotion.
It appeared that the prisoner, a man of no attainments,
had decided to write a poem entitled, "A Song of
Sunrise," and had hired the complainant to help him
in the first line.
The poem had been duly composed, printed and pub-
lished in a sixpenny magazine, and had been signed by
the prisoner with his full name. The first line appeared
in the following form:—
To with the lark and with the sun arise.
The complainant, in answer to tho magistrate, ad-
mitted that he had been split before, but added that
he had never been split so badly. Ordinary splittings
by the insertion of one dividing word he could stand,
but the prisoner's offence went far beyond that. A
seven-word split gave rise to intolerable sufferings. At
this point the complainant fainted, but revived after a
strong dose of LINDLEY MURRAY had been administered
by the magistrate's clerk.
Mr. HARRISON, a critic, deposed to finding the com-
plainant in a state of collapse outside the office of
Messrs. BUMBLE & BLICK, the well-known publishers.
He had him conveyed to his home in an ambulance,
and bound him up there. Great violence must have
been used by the prisoner. Such offences were a grave
danger to the community, for many might be led away
by the example. In cross-examination by the prisoner,
who was not defended by counsel, Mr. HARRISON ad-
mitted that he had taken part in the agitation for the
establishment of the new Court. He bore the prisoner
no grudge. He had never heard of him before.
The prisoner made a long and rambling statement in
his defence, but called no witnesses. He urged that
he had been educated in a public school and a-university,
and was now doing his best to keep a roof over the
heads of his wife and family. He admitted that it was
not necessary for him to write poetry. Even if he had
committed an offence he pleaded that it was merely a
technical one. He had had no intention of injuring
the complainant. Quite the reverse. He asked the
magistrate to deal with him lightly. In addition to his
wife and children, he had an aged mother dependent
on his exertions.
The magistrate asked if anything was known against
the prisoner. Police-constable BLUNT said he had on
many occasions misused a relative by putting him in the
wrong case. Only a month ago he had caused the
following sentence to be printed and issued to tho
public: "The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, whom
wo believe has never before dealt with a problem cf
such complexity." He had also attacked several quota-
tions and had brutally ill-treated them, but none of

The magistrate, in passing sentence, said it was a
very bad case. Poetry was very dangerous stuff, and
must always be carefully handled, especially when the
person employing it hml had no previous experience of
its use. This kind of thing had gone on too long, but
the Legislature had decided that Infinitives were not to
bo split with impunity any more. It was sad to see a
man in the prisoner's position. He might have sup-
ported his family by manual labour, for which his
physical strength evidently fitted him. Instead of that
he had chosen to be a poet. Having made his bed he
must lie on it. He (the magistrate) was bound to see
that the law was obeyed. Infinitives must be protected
in their lawful avocations. If such crimes as the
prisoner's went unpunished, wo could none of us know
whose turn it might be next. He took a very serious
view of the prisoner's offence, and felt he should not
be discharging his duty properly unless he passed upon
him the heaviest sentence permitted by the law. The
prisoner must undergo ten years' solitary confinement
with a dictionary and a selection of novels written by
ladies, to be followed by five years of rigorous con-
finement in a printing office. The gratitude of the
public was due to Police-constable BLUNT for the way in
which he had prepared the case.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
CHIEFLY MATRIMONIAL.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,—HILDEGARDE is
Lady WIDELANDS, and I flatter my-
self that, thanks in a great measure
to your BLANCHE, it was quite the
wedding of the season. St. Agatha's
was simply crammed; people were
killing each other to get in; and the
street outside was a block. At your
own wedding you 're handicapped
by being the bride, and can't see to
every little detail; but a sister's
wedding you can put through without
a hitch. The leitmotif of the affair
was pastoral, with the bridesmaids
en bergere, and pastoral music
played. I wanted to hand over the
church to SOAMES and SOAMES be-
forehand, have a lot of the pews
removed, and a regular pastoral
scene set. The authorities made
some objection, however (how
narrow-minded people are!), so I
had to do things on a smaller scale.
I chose the maids strictly for their
beauty. Where, of two sisters, one
was pretty and the other clever (we
don't use a harsher word in these
days), I took the pretty one ruth-
lessly, and left the other. 1 believe
I 've given offence in some quarters,
but I can't help that. One ought lo
have the courage of one's ideas os
well us of one's opinions. The shep-
herdesses were correct in every
detail, with field flowers and genuine
crooks, and, as a realistic touch, I
thought of making each of them
carry one of those dear little pigmy
sheep that have been the fashion
lately; but they persuaded me out of
this. I wanted, too, to have ushers
for the maids in the American stylo,
and dress them as shepherds, with
smock-frocks, Pan-pipes, and ribbons
in their hats; but, if you'll believe
me, DAPH, I positively could not
get them to dress so! Aren't people
sickeningly self-conscious nowadays?
You can't get them, especially the
men, to sink their individuality for a
time and merge themselves in a
picture. Dear Professor DIMSDALE,
in one of those lovely lecture-chats
on mental philosophy, told us of a
great French philosopher who dis-
covered the Ego. Myself, I think
it 's a pity he didn't leave it where
it was! I 'm sure it 's made people
absurdly priggish and odiously dis-
obliging.
HILDEGARDE went through it with-
out turning a hair. There 'a ro
scope for originality in a bride; she 's
I bound to be conventional. But I
• made one small innovation that, I
think, will catch on at summer
weddings. Instead of flowers or a
Prayer-Book, she carried a white satin
fan, with orange-blossom painted
round the edge, and all that matters
of the Marriage Service (the part
where the responses come in, you
know), printed in silver. •
Afterwards we had a fete cham-
petrc in the garden here. SOAMES
and SOAMES had turned the place
into a very good imitation of those
sweet old Flemish pictures by
WATTEAU or WOUVERMANS, where
there are always boors revelling; only
there were no boors, and we didn't
revel.
And now, my dear, let me say how
perfectly shocked and miserable 1
am at the news of your being engaged
to a country parson. I 'm so vexed
that I positively won't say another
word about it! You, who might have-
done so well! Why didn't I bring
you here by force, and give you a
season in London? You oughtn't to
have come to this for ten years yet.
No girl has any business to think of
the lesser clergy till she 's past thirty.
Where 's the use of telling me that
you "re happy and suit each other?
Such last-century nonsense! We "re
living in the twentieth century now,
and those things don't count. It's
quite a tragedy! Of course, I know
that, just as every private soldier in
somebody's army was said to have a
marshal's baton in his knapsack, so
perhaps every curate may be said to
have a bishop's apron in his sermon-
case, but I 'm afraid the odds are all
against it in this instance. And
some day, when I go down there to
open a bazaar or lay a stone, I shall
find my poor DAPHNE wearing a
middle-aged bonnet and mantle, and
with a family of children, and her
face "seamed with the horrid
cares" of something or other, as
MILTON says. Do, my dear child,
take the advice of a true friend
(which is not too common a thing
among us women); break it off at
once, and come and stay with me,
and I '11 do the best I can for you.
If I were asked what has been the
special obsession this summer in
London, I think I should say
Descriptive Dancing, Musical Ex-
pression, or Choregraphic Narrative
—for it 's called by all these names.
A good many of us have been bitten
by it, and have taken lessons. One
can get hold of it quite quickly, for
there are no difficult steps to learn,
and one doesn't have to practise
much. And then, my dear, the dress!
It can be compared to nothing! We
gave a performance the other day at
the Matine'e Theatre in aid of a
Seaside Home for Irresponsible Im-
pecunious Idiots. I danced a Prelude
and Fugue of BACH'S, dressed in
gold fringe, against a black back-
ground. Then BERYL CLARGES did
TSCHAIKOWSKY'S " 1812," dressed in
two little flags (French and Russian),
her background being a painted cloth
showing wintry scenes and soldiers
marching. It was my turn again
after that, and I danced the " Moon-
light Sonata." I wore iridescent
sequins, and was backed by a starry
sky. It was immense! But the
piece de resistance was a duet for
BERYL and me—Eve and the
Serpent. There was a set scone for
this, the Garden of Eden with the
Tree in the middle. \Ve 'd a bit of a
turn-up as to which of us should do
Eve and wear the sweet little dress
of pink silk-fringe; but BERYL had
to give way, and do the Serpent or
nothing. (I 'd a right to choose,
having arranged the whole thing;
but some people are so solf-asserting,
aren't they?—never satisfied unless
they 're first.) I must say she did
the Serpent very well. Her sinuous
movements were a good deal
admired; and, though she certainly
looked rather spiteful all the time,
that suited the part too. My dancing
of Eve's irresolution and final taking
of the apple was voted to be as
classical, artistic, and satisfying a
chorographic poem as any profes-
sional has yet expressed!
I 've had my first little triumph en
the Turf—only a weeny one at the
Smallbury Races (rather a rotten
little meeting), but it 's a beginning.
FREDDY and BILLY VAVAS«UR (I
think I told you they train for me)
say it 's best to begin low down. The
winner was a darling two-year-old
filly that I 've called Blanclicite.
FREDDY and BILLY think she may
prove a wonder, and smother
Signorinetta's record by annexing
both the Guineas next year as well
as the Derby and Oaks! I was such
a happy little woman that day, with
the first taste of success, that I in-
sisted on leading in my own, own
little winner. FREDDY and BILLY
tried to dissuade me, saying it's
only done on big occasions. As if I
didn't know that! Qa m'est eaal. I
don't follow a fashion; I set it.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.

(From Holborn to the Strand and back in
2J minutes.}
[ The following article is asserted to be the
work of a driver of the Holborn—Strand train,
but wo have been unable to verify tliis alle-
gation.]
OF all those who want to go from
Holborn to tho Strand only a few are
moan enough to walk. For the
others there is a train. With that
reckless disregard of expense which
has always characterised the actions
of Tube Railway Companies there is
provided a man to drive this train.
Equal to the dignity of his post and
alive to the difficulties of his under-
taking, he steps into the train at Hol-
born and turns a handle.
When he arrives at the Strand he
steps into the other end of the train
and turns another handle. When he
gets back to Holborn he is confronted
by a red flag, which informs him that
he can go no further. But he did not
need a red flag to tell him that,
because—
(a) He has been to Holborn be-
fore.
(b) He can see that there is no
further to go.
Thereupon he realises the position
at a glance, and adopts the only
course open to an honourable man.
He goes back to the Strand.
You ask me: "Who may this man
bo who drives this train from Holborn
to the Strand, from the Strand to
Holborn, and from Holborn to the
Strand, with such conspicuous
ability?" I answer you simply and
straightforwardly: "I am that
man."
Are you coming with me to—
CHAPTER I.—The Strand?
The Strand Station is a spot of
especial interest to the tourist in
London. It lies 150 feet below the
surface of the street, and is coloured
green and white. Its most striking
features are some theatrical posters
and a self-winding clock. When you
approach the lifts you will see a
notice—" Have your Ticket Ready."
The meaning of this notice is
briefly this: that you are to have
your ticket ready. If you have no
ticket you need not have it ready.
To that extent you score over those
who have tickets. On the other
hand, they score over you in that
you, having no ticket, will not be let
out of the tube and they will. That
will be my gain, because I like your
company, but it will be your loss
because it may interfere with yuur
work.
On reflection I think you must
have had a ticket, or you would
never have been allowed to descend
by the other lift. Therefore, if you
have no ticket, you must have lost it.
I beg your pardon. I did not under-
stand you to say that you have a
return ticket. Then you will of
course be coming back with me to
CHAPTER II.—Holborn.
Holborn Station is a spot of
especial interest to tho tourist in
London. It lies 149 feet below the
surface of the street, and is coloured
green and crimson lake. Its most
striking features are a self-winding
clock and some theatrical posters.
"Hurry off, please," says my
learned friend tho Guard, and you
start hurrying off. "Hurry on,
please," says the double-faced rogue,
and you hurry back again. Back wo
go, then, to

Situated, as it is, 150 feet. . . But

ever, I am equally fond of returning

from my travels, and by a curious
coincidence I have been to
CHAPTER IV.—Holborn
12,073 times also. Of the, two I
prefer
CHAPTER V.—Thc Strand.
Which do you prefer, this or
CHAPTER VI.—Holborn?
Yes, you think you like this better,
but, believe me, you really prefer
the other. Mind you, I have been to
both 12,074 times, and ought to
know. But just come and have
another peep at
CHAPTER VII.—The Strand.
Ah! I thought you had not looked
properly. I was born at
CHAPTER VIII.—Holborn,
but educated at
CHAPTER IX.—The Strand.
Sometimes I wish I had been edu-
cated at
CHAPTER X.—Holborn,
and born at
CHAPTER XI.—The Strand.
Wherever I was born I have lived
anything but a dull life. My day is
full of changes, in fact I am always
changing from one end to the other
or from the other end to one, as the
case may be. Wearing though the
strain of such an existence is, I do
not think I could stand the monotony
of a quiet life above the surface. My
noble friend the Liftman tells me
that things are very slow up above,
and he has been there a good many
times. He is a good sort, although
he does wear a flannel collar; and I
am certain he would not tell a lie.
(You must not speak to him when
the lift is in motion.)
But we must be getting back to
CHAPTER XII.-—Holborn.
Are you getting out here? Well,
good-bye; I am very pleased to have
met you so often. If they make any
fuss about that return ticket of yours
(they are such unreasonable fellows
at this end) you are always welcome1
in my little train. Good-bye again;
I think I shall be gadding along to
CHAPTER XIII.—The Strand,
on my way to
CHAPTER XIV.—Holborn.
"It was a peculiarity of the storm that it

CHARIVARIA.
ATTENTION has been called again
to the shabby condition of the red
benches provided for the Peers in the
House of Lords, and it is suggested
that it is the intention of the
Government not to abolish the Upper
Chamber, but to let it gradually
crumble away.
* *
Mr. HALDANE laughed, in the
House of Commons, at the idea that
there are foreign spies in this
country. Is it that we have no
military secrets worth stealing?
* *
"It is significant," writes one^f
our Society correspondents, " that at
a tea-party given by Mr. KEIR
HARDIE the other day King EDWARD
was conspicuous by his absence. No
attempt was made to conceal the
reason. His MAJESTY was not
invited."
V
The British Undertakers' Asso-
ciation has decided that " advertise-
ments tending to loudness" shall
be discouraged. It would be inter-
esting to know whether this would
mean a cool reception over here for
the American undertakers' classic
trade announcement, "You kick the
bucket: we do the rest."
* * *
*
The question whether capital
punishment shall be abolished is still
being discussed hotly in France.
For ourselves we should have thought
that in view of France's dwindling
population the retention of the death
penalty is highly inadvisable.
V
Several Union Jacks were torn
down in various parts of the States
by indignant Americans on the
Fourth of July; but the victory was
not bloodless, for 71 Americans were
killed, and 2,624 injured on that day.

*
In spite of reports to the contrary
the recent Silk Hat Parade at the
Exhibition did much to promote the
sale of that form of headgear. It
came on to rain during the demon-
stration, and many of the five hun-
dred demonstrators have in conse-
quence had to purchase new silk
hats.
V
The agitation on the part of the
local gentry to get tho name of the
thoroughfare known as Houndsditch
changed to something more attrac-
tive has been revived. The alterna-
tive name has not yet been decided
on, but we believe that a large party
is in favour of swopping names with
Park Lane.
V
A Philadelphia!! preacher has ad-
vanced the interesting proposition
that MOSES 'was a negro. This, we
suppose, is the swing of tho pen-
dulum. A little while ago it was tho
fashion to whitewash every historical
character.
#
The statement that a newspaper
which has just made its appearance
in a French provincial town is tho
first journal to be printed on fly-
paper has called forth a protest to
the effect that one or two papers pro-
duced in this country print such
poisonous matter that they are quite
as effective for the purpose.
It is hoped that it will be possible
at the banquet which the Govern-
ment has decided to give to the
members of the International Peace
Congress to make an announcement
that an early cessation of hostilities
between some of our Admirals is
imminent.
* *
At the Children's Garden Party,
given by the QUKEN at Buckingham
Palace, the entertainment was pro-
vided by Mr. ASIITON, and some dis-
appointment, wo hear, was felt
among the youthful audience because
Mr. ASHTON did not recite to them a
number of his bright letters on tomb-
stones.

We are sorry to hoar that the
profession of Comic Burglar is suf-
fering from temporary depression
owing to an accident to a person of
this calling in Germany. The gentle-
man in question had broken into an
hotel at Rensburg, and was about
to loave with his loot, when the
humorous idea of inscribing his initials
and profession in the Visitors' Book
occurred to him. While ho was thus
engaged the poor fellow was sur-
prised by a waiter, and now he is
languishing in a gaol.

CENT. PEE CENT.
NOT to be eclipsed by his enter-
prising daily contemporaries, Mr.
Punch determined to discover, by
hook or by crook, a Centenarian cf
his own. Herewith he has pleasure
in presenting the results of his search
in his ambassador's own language: —
'' After scouring the country for
many days without avail, I struck
oil north of the Tweed. Sitting one
evening in the bar-parlour of a way-
side inn, brooding—I repeat, brood-
ing—I overheard a chance remark
that put me on the track at last. I
brooded a little more, paid for it, and
followed up my man.
"' Ay (Yes),' he said, 'he'll be
a hundred the noo.'
"' Hoots, mon,' I answered (being
fairly fluent in the language), 'ye'll
no be sayin' it I And what '11 be his
name, d' ye ken (know)?'
'HENERY,' replied the bucolic.
Ah!' I exclaimed, in my
waggish way, 'now we shall soon

"My informant led me to the cot-
tage of the patriarch, and ushered
me in.
"I found myself in the midst of a
unique family party. At the head of
iho table sat our friend HENEUY,
clad in a smoking-cap such as our
grandmothers delighted to embroider
for their swains, and in full possession
of all his faculties. He has never in
his life worn glasses for reading, but
can see the smallest print. He is
unfortunately unable to read, but \-<s
daughter, a strapping lass of seventy-
nine summers, reads the paper to
him every night before she goes to
bed—she finds it inconvenient to do
so nfter.
And so," I began, shaking
hands, 'you remember the Battle of
Hastings? Ye '11 ken jist a' aboot it
—what, hey?'
''Ay (Yes),' he replied. 'I
mind how mo mither smackit me
weel the day. the news cam"—an' the
way I greeted (cried).'
"' Father '11 aye be tellin' ye c'
that,' put in the youngest boy, a
fresh-faced youngster of sixty-five.
Have you ever been to Lon-
don?' I asked.
'" Ye '11 be fra' (from) Lunnon

"Ay, ay.'
"Ay, man, I'll be there twa

think I '11 forget Lunnon.'
No, no. Come now," I pursued,
'what did you think of it?'

genial old man smiled at his recol-
lections. We chatted awhile, and I
prepared to leave.
"' Before I go, Mr. HENERY,' 1
suggested, 'you will give me a hint
or two for the benefit of my readers
on the way to live to a green old ago
—what, hey?'
"Food faddists will not be greatly
taken with my old friend's ideas.
He has always, he says, eaten and
drunk precisely what he pleased,
except when unable to obtain it. He
believes in exercise—a three-mile walk
on a Sunday morning he considers a
splendid thing for a tonic. Having
lived for a hundred years, he has spent
some time in the open air.
"' Tak' everything as it comes, and
dinna fash yersel' (don't worry),'
was his sensible parting advice.
"' Even if you 're caught takin'
it.' I said, as I wished him farewell.
He laughed very heartily at this
sally, so much so that we all joined
in. I left him still chuckling."

MABK LOCKWOOD STALKS THE ALIEN IN EITINQ FOBEST.
House of Commons, Monday, July
6.—Colonel MARK LOCKWOOD, V.C.,
back on duty; his countenance has
taken on a manlier bronze, his hat is
tipped a little further towards back of
head, carnation in his button-hole
nearer than ever to circumference
of a sunflower. Excited some atten-
tion on entering the Lobby by carry-
ing a telescope under his arm.
"What's that for?" WALTER
LONG asked him. "A new way of
catching the SPEAKER'S eye?"
Beneath the bronze a blush
mantled MARK'S ingenuous counten-
ance.
"Beg your pardon," he said;
"force of habit."
Rushed off to locker, deposited spy-
glass. Back in time to put a ques-
tion which explained everything. For
the past ten days, during which
Lobby, House and Terrace have
lamented his absence, MARK has been
down in Epping Forest, stalking a
couple of foreigners. By various
strategic movements, such as climb-
ing trees, crawling on all fours
through the long grass (on one occa-
sion hiding in an outhouse, the door
of which the owner casually locked in
passing, imprisoning the unsuspected
Colonel for the space of five hours),
he accumulated evidence revealing
the true character of the self-styled
tourists. They were, in brief, Ger-
man spies, charged with mission of
securing photographs of Epping
Forest and water-colour sketches of
the more picturesque views, with
intent that the German Army,
having sunk the Channel Fleet and
gobbled up the Territorial Forces,
should march by nearest route on
London.
This afternoon brought subject to
notice of House in form of question
addressed to SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
WAR. With that hide-bound contempt
which Ministers commonly show for
information reaching them through
any but official sources, NAPOLEON B.
HALDANE made light of the affair.
Told a little story relating to what
he described as similar incident. Re-
port made to War Office of three
foreign officers taking observations in
a rural district. Specially mentioned
as conclusive evidence of guilty
intent that they "drank cham-
pagne and drove about in motors."
Investigation made, it turned out
that they were innocent, even
commonplace, visitors, wholly uncon-
nected with military matters.
"This is the kind of thing," said
N.B.H., casting a look of scorn at
the cauliflower in MARK'S button-
hole, " that is constantly coming up."
Thus is patriotism encouraged by
the present so-called Government.
After spending five hours in an out-
house, breaking his watch-chain in
forcing his way through inade-
quate outlet provided by a partly-
shuttered window, and carrying out
the other strategic movements cited,

Tuesday.—Like that other re-
nowned warrior, General TROCHU,
Captain KINCAID-SMITH has his
"plan." It is more comprehensive
even than the original one for the
deliverance of beleaguered Paris.
Having carefully considered the
Territorial Army scheme, an eye
trained in warfare perceives its weak
point. As, many years ago, the late
Mr. BIGGAK, criticising a Bill brought
in by Mr. CHAPLIN relating to the
breed of horses, observed, "It 's too
narrer, Mr. SPARER, much too
narrer." It provides excellent
machinery, but lacks the force to
work it. In brief, it does not make
provision for raw material of an army
•—men, to wit.
This KINCAID-SMITH is prepared to
do. Has drafted a scheme, elaborat-
ing plan of national military training,
making it compulsory,
for leave

This aftcr-
to introduce
his Bill. Avails himself of privilege
of Ten Minutes Rule to explain it
clause by clause with reiterated
formula. "Clause 1 lays down"
he said. "Clause 2 lays down"
and so on to the end, as if the Bill
were a hen laying eggs for families.
House began to show signg of im-
patience at the quaint reiteration.
KINCAID-SMITH took no notice of the
restless movement, the increasing
buzz of conversation, the murmur
of "Time! Time!" He had, so
to speak, a hen up his sleeve
that would "lay down" something
sure to please Members, safe to
secure a first reading of the Bill.
"Clause 11," he said, in due
course, "lays down that exemption
from compulsory training shall be
accorded to habitual drunkards, per-
sons of weak intellect, and Members
of both Houses of Parliament."
A roar of cheers and laughter
greeted this happy grouping.
When it subsided, KINCAID-SMITH
started off again. "Clause 12 lays
down—" This brought up the
SPEAKER with significant reminder
that the allotted time had expired.
KINCAID-SMITH quite surprised. Was
getting on so nicely. Process of laying
down carried on with unvarying punc-
tuality and dispatch. Though there
might be no appeal from ruling of the
Chair, he was not disposed to forego
delivery of his peroration, carefully
prepared after close study of JOHN
BRIGHT'S masterpieces.
In solemn voice, with impressive
manner, he began to "lay down"
one of the longest sentences ever
worked off in debate. Members,
placated by the artful bribe of remis-
sion of compulsory training, listened
in silence to the first furlong or so.
As he went on, laying it down as if
it were an Atlantic cable, the long
unfamiliar cry of " 'Vide! "Vide!"
broke forth, drowning orator's voice.
This bad enough; mild compared
with what followed on a division,
when leave to introduce the Bill was
refused by 250 votes against 34.
Business done.—Old Age Pensions

Friday. To the joy of his friends
and the delight of the Labour Mem-
bers, to whom he is of never-failing
interest, Earl WIXTERTON has come
back, bringing his sheaves with him
in the shape of an honourable scar or
two earned in the polo field. He
finds the Government at their old
game, suspending Eleven o'Clock
tlule, closuring everybody, forcing
obnoxious Bills through at the blade
of the guillotine.
. "I think," Mr. SPEAKER, he said,
looking gloomy for one of his tender
years, " the time has come when
some kind of League should be
formed for the protection of Private
Members."
There is about the inception of the
idea that misty vagueness that in-
vests with grandeur distant mountain
peaks. WINTERTON doesn't conde-
scend to detail. The proposed com-
bination is to bo what Lord HALS-
BURY would call "a sort of" a
League. In throwing out sugges-
tion he doubtless had in his well-

MY FIVE-POUND STORY.
I AM writing this story for a wager.
Let there be no mistake about that.
In the first place JORKINS said I
couldn't write a story. Then he said
I couldn't get it accepted anyhow.
Whereupon I drew out five sovereigns
from my sovereign-case, placed them
on the table, and dared JORKINS to do
the same.
JOKKINS accepted the challenge
and we drew up the conditions :—
(1) I am to name my hero ALAN FAIR-
FAX, and my heroine CLARIBEL.
(My condition.)
(2) Each time the story is returned
by an editor I am to add a
chapter to it.
(JORKINS'S con-
dition.)
I mention this
second condition in
order that editors
shall see that the
sooner they accept
my story the less
of it there will be
to accept.
CHAPTER I.
There was a big
crush at Lady BAS-
SINGTON'S. A con-
tinual stream -of
Cabinet Ministers,
artists and poets
ascended the broad
staircase and flowed
into the brilliantly-
lighted salon. A con-
tinual stream of
Cabinet Ministers,
poets and artists
descended the back
staircase and passed
out by the emergency
exit.
Thus the brilliantly-
lighted salon was kept supplied with
fresh celebrities.
At the top of the first staircase
stood ALAN FAIRFAX. His bronzed
face and strong, square chin con-
trasted strongly (there is nothing
about not having two "strongs"
together in the conditions; anyway,
I shall chance it) with the weak,
effeminate types around. One felt
that here (at last) stood the hero.
It ia sometimes wise to trust one's
intuitions. He is the hero. He had
been away from England for ten
years, -shooting big game in South
Africa, South America, Scotland.
[Editors, please delete two of those.]
He had returned to his native land
to find CLARIBEL.
Night after night he had waited at
•the top of the stairs. He had now
been waiting three months. CLABI-
BEL was overdue.
Suddenly his eyes lighted on a
familiar aigrette of iorchon lace—
[Are aigrettes fitted with torchon
lace? Please confirm]—that was
being carried upwards in the stream
of Cabinet Ministers, artists, and
poets. "It is she," he said. "She
will arrive in half an hour."
"CLARIBEL
"ALAN!"
"At last,
come."
"O ALAN!

away, through the brilliantly-lighted
salon, down the second staircase,
and through the emergency exit. She
was gone! ALAN FAIRFAX searched
the thronged rooms. He spoke to the
footman at the door. He enquired
at the box-office. She had vanished.
Out into the starlit night. Out
into the silent blue-black immensity
of space. Beyond the park railings.
On! On!
Unheeding the low, hoarse cries of
breathless men. Unheeding the
urgent voices of the night. On! On!
Faster! Faster! Croydon—Red-
hill—Ilandcross. Surely he must
beat the record.
Then a blinding crash. . . The earth
rose and rushed upon
him and beat the life
out of him. . . . Then
—a silence.

rifle and bayonet, instead of being re-armed with the sword.]

You think I shall find it difficult to
add another chapter? Wait and see.
CHAPTER II.
Where was Claribel?
A moment ago ALAN had held her
in his strong arms. [Is this right?
Should he have taken her into the
salon first?] Now she was tern
from him in a sudden wave of artists.
Cabinet Ministers, and poets. Far
Two days later—
when the ice had
melted — they found
him.
THE END.
[Declined.—EDITOR,
Sunday at Home.]
CHAPTER III.
Through a typo-
graphical error in my
last chapter "found
him " was printed for
"fined him." ALAN
FAIRFAX attended the
Court with bandaged
head. When they
asked his name he
replied not. He only
stared at the crowded
court and the white-
robed usher. [Is this
wrong?] He had for-
gotten it.
ALAN FAIRFAX had
—' lost his memory!
"It is hopeless," said the Court
missionary. ..." unless he were to
receive some sudden shock."
"Ten pounds and costs," said the
magistrate.
But even this shock was not enough.
He left the Court. He began to shoot
big game once more. Whenever he
saw a policeman he would call for
his 6'7 repeater. [Please correct.]
One day he was shooting near
Hawkhurst Grange, where CLARIBEL'S
married sister lived. He had had
no luck that morning. Suddenly a
strango beast approached. It rushed
upon him with a hideous roar. He
raised his 6'7 repeater.
They applied all four brakes and
jumped down from the car.

I have a presentiment that this
will be the last.
The shock had done it. ALAN'S
memory was restored. He opened
his eyes and recognised CLARIBEL.

Miss BONANZA BYNOE, the greatest
novelist of the last fortnight, whose
Gargantuan genius has caused some-
thing like an earthquake in Vigo Street
and the vicinity, is not only one of the
most beautiful women in Bays water, but
derives an added lustre from her dis-
tinguished antecedents. Her real name,
which she withholds out of a laudable
modesty familiar in modern lady novel-
ists, appears in a footnote to an appen-
dix in Debrett, and her brother enjoyed
the inestimable privilege of being fag
to a belted earl at Eton. Miss BYKGE, it
may be added, began to write poetry at
the age of three, and although some of
her rhymes are peculiar—e.g., "rhodo-
dendron" and "pendulum "—there is a
high-bred distinction about her ideas
which points unmistakably to her aristo-
cratic birth.
Miss ANNABEL VIVIAN, whose recent
novel, The Quandary, has been pro-
nounced by her publisher to be the
greatest work of the century, is related
to several of the oldest families in Ireland,
and appears — though of course not
under her pseudonym—in Thorns Direc-
tory and nalfard'i County FamiHei.
Indeed, we have the best authority for
stating that Miss VIVIAN'S uncle by
marriage is the second cousin once
removed of a gentleman who for some
years past has presented a claim for the
revival of the dormant peerage of Bally-
bunnion in North Kerry. •
Miss HILDA GILLESPIE, who has recently
been declared by The Peebles Gazette to
be the greatest female novelist of the
century, prefers to write under an
assumed name in deference to the wishes
of her father, whose great-great-grand-
mother on the maternal side was the
foster-sister of the housekeeper to the
last Lord BANAVIE of Rannoch. Although,
strange to say, Miss GILLESPIE'S real
name docs not appear in Dcbrclt, it is
to be found in The Peebles Directory in
close proximity to that of a well-known
baronet of sporting tendencies.

IF you are an exiled Russian Prince, it makes it much
more amusing to be a Nihilist too. But Prince Rurikoff,
who is the hero of The Honour of X (SMITH, ELDER),
went one better than that, being a sort of
humanitarian Nihilist engaged in saving the life of the
Tsar who had banished him. As a member of the
"Inner Circle " he had sworn not to marry, which he
found very tiresome when he camo across Nest
Llewellyn, an undiscovered diva living in a part of
Wales that does not ap-
pear in the railway ad-
vertisements. Why a
spy should have any
scruples about breaking
his oath, and how the
unknown X squared his
position with his con-
science at all (for he kept
giving information to the
English Government), aro
points which Miss GRAHAM
HOPE does not very
clearly explain. Prob-
ably one has to be very
good at algebra to under-
stand it, and 1 never got
much beyond quadratic
equations. Anyhow, the
middle part of the book,
where liurikoff comes as
a strolling artist named
Gregory to Porth Howell,
is wholly idyllic and de-
lightfully written, so that
it seems quite a pity that
the stranger's shirts and
collars are marked B. G.

scended from UUKIK, Em-
peror of all the Russias.
However, he defies fate,
marries Miss Llewellyn,
and after a stormy inter-

a truly feminine genius
for using commas in the

against re-incarnation and automatic writing and other
similar snags.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Ufa I
AT this moment, when the thoughts of all are turning to
the fields and the hills and the sea, Mr. Punch appeals to his
gentle and generous readers to remember the Children of the
City, to whom the simple delights of the country are for-
bidden unless there are kind hearts somewhere to care for
them. Last year the CHILDREN'S COUNTRY HOLIDAYS FOND was
able to give a fortnight's happiness in country cottages to
41,970 children. This number represents only about 5 per
cent, of the elementary school population of London, of whom
not more than one-third have the chance of escaping from
the town for even a week's holiday. Mr. Punch begs his
friends to support this Fund, which is badly in need of help,
and to send contributions, large or small or middle-sized, direct
to the Hon. Treasurer, the Earl of Arran, at 18, Buckingham
Street, Strand, W.C. Mr. Pundi is not often importunate in
this way, but he confesses to being something of a beggar in
the cause of children, so near are they to his heart. Though
he is himself full of years and very, very wise, he still
remains incurably "a child in these matters."
THE GREAT LITTLE GAMES.
THE Olympic arena seethed with officials, unofficials
and competitors. On the cinder track the demi-semi-
finals of the 109'36 yards sprint, and the 29th heat of
the 4'05 miles race were being worked off concurrently.
On the cycling track the performers in the If lap race
were threading their way amongst casual groups who
had eluded the Kiralfian police. Fountains of spray
went up from the tank every time that a fancy diver
could find a wet spot in the middle of a water-polo
match (Finland v. Monaco). On the grass several
thousand physical-exercisers were performing various
evolutions in a shocking light, the air being dark with
flying javelins, diski (both styles), arrows, shot, and
so-called hammers. A steeplechase and the 437'4 yards
hurdle race just left room for a section of the American
contingent, who were engaged in an exotic competition
known as the Standing High Jump. At any moment
the Marathon runners might appear at the turnstile
clamouring for admission.
As my eye ran over the vast empty spaces in tho
part reserved for spectators, " Ah I " I thought, " if only
the public could change places with tho occupants cf
the arena, what a magnificent gallery it would be!"
Suddenly 1 caught sight of an Austro-Hungarian
friend who had come over to represent the Dual
Monarchy in the Hop-Skip-and-Jump. His Czech suit
shone brightly out from the Distinguished Strangers'
Block. We hod met in Prague, where he held the titlo
of Backward-Somersault-Loug-Distance World Cham-
pion. I beckoned to him to join me on the higher
slopes of the cycle-track. There we sat down and
conversed in the Bohemian vernacular.
I found him unfavourably impressed by the indiffer-
ence of the British public. "And yet," he said, " they
are only asked to concentrate their attention upon a
•few score of Olympic contests extending over a beggarly
fortnight—or a bare month if we include outside events!
Is this all the advance we have made, in these twenty
centuries of progress, upon tho paltry eight or ten
contests at the old Pan-Hellenic Games?"
"Well, anyhow," I said, "we seem to have de-
veloped some fairly fanciful games that no grown-up
Englishman ever thinks of playing at except on these
occasions, such as the Back-Swimming-Race, your
Hop-Skip-and-Jump, the Standing-High-Jump, and tho
Standing-Broad-Jump. Don't you call that advancing
by leaps and bounds?"
"It's all right," he replied, "as far as it goes:
but we want more of that spirit. I would have a separate
event for every conceivable form of muscular activity.
Thus I have a Magyar friend who holds the Water-Ping-
Pong Championship of the Danube. What chance has
he here of proving his claim to Olympic honours? That
is one of the nobler branches of athletic competition;
but I could easily mention dozens of others that are at
present sadly neglected. The following, for instance,
occur to me as among the gravest omissions: —
High Jump (kneeling).
Broad Jump (sitting).
Hop-Skip-and-Jump (sideways).
„ „ (vertical).
Throwing the Paper Dart (Greek Style).
i. ,. (any style).
Feet-First Diving (with tank).

Punching the Ball.
Tossing the Pancake.
Quick-Shaving (safety razor).
„ (danger „ ).
Skittles at 10'45, 12'53, 14'62 yards, and so on.
"One might," he concluded, "with great profit ex-
tend these competitions indefinitely till everybody got a
medal."
"And how would you find time for the intervals
between the Quadrennial Games? " I asked.
"There wouldn't be any," he replied. "And an
excellent thing, too, for the World's Peace. It would
be like a Hague Conference sitting till further notice.'
"And a banquet every night?"
"And a banquet every/ night. Regularity is the
secret of athletic training.'
"By the way, you said nothing of a Greasy Pole
Walk. You wouldn't miss that out?"
"No, indeed. But I only gave a few obvious samples.''
"Well, we 're on the way towards your ideal. But
let 's hope it won't all of it come in my time. Give me
the Inter-University Sports with ten events and the
whole thing over in two hours. That 's good enough
for me."
"By tho way," I added, as I slipped down the slope
and threw a couple of performers in the Cycle "Pur-
suit " Race, " here 's luck to you in the Hop-Skip-and-
Jump. Don't hesitate to take this championship out of

A FALLEN CLASSIC.
'No, MY GOOD MAN. IT 's NO GOOD BEGOINO. I"
'PARDON ME, SIR, YOD MISTAKE. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU FOR THE MEANS OF IGNITION."
A REAL CONVERSATION.
I CANNOT say what language the
two men at the table next to mine
were talking. It was not English
nor American nor French. It may
have been German, but I doubt it.
I know three German expressions,
"Good morning," "lemonade," and
"Thank you," and certainly none of
those came in.
They were not conversing as
Englishmen converse: they were
employing the European or "free
style "—the rules of svhich are that
the bigger man of the two talks
rapidly and continuously, and the
other waits impassively for his
voice to break. Then — but you
shall hear for yourself. Though I
did not know their language I had
no difficulty in understanding their
meaning, and this (I swear) is what
they were saying. I reproduce it in
order that this evidence of British
sympathy with an unrecognisable but
friendly nation may do something to
bring about an entente cordiale
between us.
"I will now," said GUSTAV, "lay
before you the history of my early
struggles."
"No," said ADALBERT formally,
and helped himself to a sardine.
"I was born in a little village of
our Hinterland, of obscure but fat
parents, forty-five years ago. My
early youth was passed in the
pleasant surroundings incidental to
that fine country, and I shall not
be accused of boasting when I say
that a love of beauty inherited from
my mother enabled me to appreciate
perhaps more than most of my little
companions the Titanic splendour
with which Nature had endowed the
mountains in which our hamlet
nestled."
"Have you been to the Exhibition
yet?" asked ADALBERT. "I really
think this is the hottest night of the
year. Some ice, waiter."
"But before I go any farther it is
necessary that I should give you
some idea of my parents, who had so
much to do with my upbringing, and
for this purpose I must take you
back to the year 1700, when a small
farmer of humble aspect but aston-
ishing vitality settled upon the coast
of Dalmatia. This was my great-
grandfather, and I am revealing no
secret when I tell you that had he
not survived the unprecedented suc-
cession of severe winters which
greeted his appearance upon those
shores the whole course of my destiny
might have been changed."
"Sole," said ADALBERT. "And
get me some toast."
"It was not until the year 1794
that my grandfather was born, and 1
well remember—that is, I have often
heard my mother describe to me the
scenes of legitimate festivity with
which the occasion was celebrated.
I need not detain you with any long
account of the early years of my
grandfather's life. Sufficient to say
that, if ever a man's boyhood was
passed amid scenes calculated to
inspire and uplift, these were—or,
rather, his was. But at the age of
fourteen . . . ." GUSTAV took a
hasty drink at a moment when
ADALBERT'S mouth was full, and
resumed his narrative before the
other could break in .... "Which
brings me down to the point from
which I started, my own birth and
early years. I have mentioned that
my native village nestled in a pic-
turesque way among the mountains,
but a more detailed description is
necessary if you are to appreciate
properly the startling nature of ther

accident which befell me when I was
still only in my third year. But
perhaps you know that district?"
"Yes," said ADALBERT, "I live
there."
"Then I will describe it to you.
You must know that at the back of
our village there rises steeply to the
sky a singular mountain, about
which a curious legend is related.
The legend is this. Some three hun-
dred years ago . . . ."
"1 have often wondered," said
ADALBERT in the middle of the
legend, "how they make their ices
here. They seem to have no taste
whatever."
". . . . You are now in a position
to understand the nature of the set-
ting which Providence had devised as
the background of my horrifying
experience. It was shortly after
throe o'clock upon a sunny afternoon
in May that, accompanied only by
my nurse, 1 set out upon what was
to prove an excursion pregnant with
the direst possibilities. My nurse, I
should explain, was an English-
woman of a respectable class, but
endued with a love of poetry slightly
above her station. Her favourite
author was SHAKSPEARE, and many is
the time when she recited to me a poem
called Macbeth, in the hope that its
soothing cadences would induce that
sleep of which I was at this age so
much in need. Forty-two years ago
it was, but even to this day I can
recall every word of that sublime
lullaby. How does it go? Act I.
Scene 1, an open place, thunder and
lightning: enter three witches: First
Witch: When shall we three ..."
"Another cigar, waiter," said
ADALBERT. "I expect you 're pretty
busy now, aren't you? Really? I
suppose it 's the same everywhere."
". . . Flourish. Exeunt. All that,
however, has no actual bearing upon
, the terrible incident I am about to
'narrate, though as a sidelight upon
. one of the most marked features of
my character, the memory which I
inherit from my mother, it may not
have been without interest to you."
"I must remember to get a pic-
ture postcard of the Embankment to-
morrow," said ADALBERT. "I knew
there was something I had for-
gotten."
GUSTAV, who had been gesticu-
lating so wildly that a less acute
person than myself would have sup-
posed that he was indicating to a
Swedish competitor the Athenian
method of throwing the diskus,
calmed down as he finished his horri-
fying narration.
"And my mother," he ended,
"when my nurse in trembling ac-
cents told her of our adventure,
clasped me to her arms and thanked
Heaven that so straight-backed a
son had been spared to her. But it
is time that I hastened over these
childish episodes, and placed before
you the true facts regarding my early
manhood. And here I may assure
you that by the time I have brought
my story down to the present day—
and when I say the present day I
mean it literally, for even this morn-
ing a curious adventure befell me—
you will agree that a more singular
narrative it has never been your good
fortune to hear.
*****
"And so we come down to this
morning. You might have thought
that so much adventure was enough
for one man, but not so. For at
lunch only to-day I had the happi-
ness to find myself seated opposite a
compatriot—a man even bigger and
more finely built than myself. Just
as I was Wondering how to introduce
myself to him he leant over to me
and said, 'I will now narrate to you
the history of my life. I was born
in North Germany of sensitive but
well-matched parents, some eight-
and-thirty years ago, and '"
This was too much even for
ADALBERT. He bent across the table
and blew a cloud of smoke into
GUSTAV'S open mouth. Then, while
the latter was coughing, he began:
"For my part, I belong to one of
the oldest families in Europe, and
if I am to trace their history with any
satisfaction to yourself it is necessary
that I should go back to that ADAL-
BERTUS, who in B.C. 60 . . . ."
"Waiter," said GUSTAV, "my
soup is cold. Will you take it away
and bring me some fish?"

"THAT WAY MADNESS LIES."
[A new theory to explain Hamlet's madness
is suggested in an article in Scribner's Magazine.
"The simple truth of the matter is that Hamlet
had been too long at the University. We find
him at thirty still a student at Wittenberg."]
O, MANY a deep and learned sage
Has sought to make it plain
In many a deep and learned page
Why Hamlet went insane.
But vain is all their subtle lore
And scientific knowledge;
The truth is this and nothing more —
He stayed too long at college.
About his youth not much we know,
But this at least appears:
He was a student still although
He owned to thirty years.
O ye, who call slow Camus friend,
Or up the Cher have paddled,
Remember this and comprehend
Why Hamlet's brain was addled.
What made him stay so long? you
cry;
But history is mum.
He may have been retarded by
A stiff curriculum.
He may have differed with the dons
About the sex of mensis,
Stuck at the asinorum pans
Or TvjrraB tricky tenses.
Again, he may have loved a life
Of suppers, wines and sport,
Shrinking from all the pretty strife
And jealousies of Court.
Or possibly another ground
Induced the Prince to settle
In Wittenberg: he may have found
Some most " attractive metal."
Again, we know the simple lust
For scholarship and lore
May make a man a dry-as-dust
And fossilised old bore;
And if the Prince became a don
What else could be expected
Than this, that, as the years rolled
on,
His brain should be affected?
No matter what the reason was —
Whether his mind grew sick
With too much learning, or because
He could not pass matric. —
This simple fact stands out mcst
clear —
To spend so long a season
In a collegiate atmosphere
Would ruin any reason.
It 's all so plain, then why so blind
Our learned LL.D.s?
The men who write on Hamlet's
mind
Have Hamlet's own disease.
To set your college dons to catch
The cause why he behaves so,
Is like expecting Colney Hatch
To say why Hanwell raves so.

ROBBIE'S SUCCESSOR.
ANECDOTAOE continues to accumu-
late about and around and upon Mr.
JOHN BURNS, who, since Mr. MORLEY
went to the Upper House and lost
his Christian name, is the one and
only JOHN of the people — PLAIN
JOHN, HONEST JOHN, DOWNRIGHT
JOHN, BATTERSEA JOHN, JOHN. It is
useless for denials of these pretty
stories to be printed: they go on just
the same. For example, a week ago it
was stated that Mr. BURNS had a
special tenderness for St. Paul's
Cathedral, because once, when down
on his luck, he acted as the model
for one of the angels in Sir WILLIAM
RICHMOND'S decoration of that fane.
Could there be a more charming
anecdote? But what does Sir WIL-
LIAM RICHMOND but deny it? Why a
paltry affection for truth should be
allowed to have its way against so
picturesque and harmless an inven-
tion, we cannot understand; but the
great artist hastened to repudiate
the angelhood of the President of
the Local Government Board, and
down he fell, like Lucifer. But
since no denial ever caught up a lie
yet, and this particular and very
pleasing story had a few days' start,
we need not worry. It will soak
well into the minds of the readers,
and never really be dislodged. And
why should it be?
Meanwhile let us ourselves add
to the Burnsian apocrypha in the
hope that these other inventions
also will stick and become folk-
lore in time. If Jack the Giant-
Killer, why not JOHN BURNS? If
Hop-o'-my-Thumb, why not JOHN
BURNS?
Mr. JOHN BURNS is, as everyone
knows, a great cricketer and, though
not himself a county player, lacks
nothing of enthusiasm and ability,
but merely the time and practice.
It is told that once when Yorkshire
were playing Somerset at Taunton
they arrived with only ten men.
Owing to a mistake GEORGE HIRST
had missed a connecting train, and
instead of being on the West-country
ground was miles away wrestling
with Bradshaw at a Midland junc-
tion and getting no wickets or runs
out of it at all. (Have you ever seen
HIRST with a Bradshaw? It is im-
mense.) Well, in despair Lord
HAWKE walked round the ground,
asking in a loud voice at intervals,
"Is there a Yorkshire cricketer here
who would help us?"
"Ay, my Lord, I will," said a
sturdy man in a blue serge reefer
jacket and a short dark beard.
"But were you born in York-

shire?" his Lordship asked, being
particular on this point. (Cheers.)
"Of course I was," said the
stranger, tearing off his coat and
rolling back the shirt sleeves from
his sinewy arms.
"Then come along," said Lord
HAWKE.
The stranger, we need hardly say,
not only batted well, knocking up a
hurricane fifty-two, but took three
wickets and won the match. You
ask who it was? It was JOHN
BURNS. Lord HAWKE never tires of
telling this story, and nothing but
the want of time prevented him from
telling it again on the occasion of
receiving a testimonial last week.
A few years ago, during a period
very prolific in burglaries in the
London suburbs, Mr. BURNS hap-
pened to be returning home to
Lavender Hill by way of Clapham
Common in the small hours. On
his way he noticed a policeman
lying prone on the ground in n
swoon. To take off the officer's
clothes and don them himself was
the work of a few moments, and
Mr. BURNS, thus clad, patrolled the
Common until morning. There were
no burglaries at Clapham that night.
Mr. BURNS after his recent illness
went to the South Coast to re-
cuperate. He walked one day to
Hythe and asked for accommodation

at an inn. The landlord at first de-
murred but afterwards consented,
and asked Mr. BURNS where his
luggage was. Mr. BURNS named the
place where it was left. "What is
the name? " BONIFACE (the landlord)
then inquired. "Never mind the
name," said our JOHN, with his cus-
tomary bluff wit, "but there 's a
jolly big J. B. on the side." It is
unnecessary to add that the visitor's
identity was soon disclosed.
A little girl was recently crossing
a Battersea street with a jug of
milk. At that moment a motor-car
came round the corner at a fearful
.speed and only just escaped knock-
ing the little girl down and doubtless
killing her. In her fright she fell
and broke the jug. As she did so
a thick-set bearded man, wearing a
blue serge reefer jacket and a straw
hat, dashed to her side and carried
her to the pavement, and then, pur-
suing the car, stopped it with one
hand, and with the other severely
chastised not only the chauffeur but
the occupants, nil of whom were
heavy-weight champions. Having
completed his task he returned to
the little girl, and after carefully
mending the jug picked up and re-
stored the spilt milk, and sent her
home happy. "Who do you think
that was? " someone asked her; and
on her expressing total ignorance of
her Bayard's name he told her that
it was the President of the Local
Government Board; or, in other
words, England's JOHN. Who else
could it have been?
Mr. BURNS is also often very busy
at his office.
A SONG OF SHINING
MOMENTS.
THOUGH I 've lived to be middle-
aged and grey,
I have hitherto run my race
Without emerging for even a day
From the ranks of the common-
place.
Yet at certain points of my drab
career
I have risen above my fate,
And done some things that came
very near
Deserving that epithet "great."
I never got into the Sixth at school—
I hadn't a " sense of style,"
And one report of a savage sort
Said my Latin verses were " vile."
No, the writing of poetry that scans
Was not for the likes of me;
But I once wrote a letter on warm-
ing-pans
That appeared in the P.M.G.
I do not shine in the vocal line,
And my musical sisters averred
That a more distressing voice than
mine
Was seldom, if ever, heard.
But once, in my bath, on a glorious
day
In the genial month of June,
I bellowed so nobly The Vicar of
Bray
That they recognised the tune.
At cricket I was distinctly bad,
For I never made a score;
And the highest average I ever had
Was decimal seventy-four.
But once, when I was fielding slip,
As the ball carrie curling by
I brought off a catch that won the
match
When a single was wanted to tie.
Though to compass a mastery of golf
I assiduously strive,
That course isn't found which I can
go round
In under a hundred-and-five.
But the other day, with a niblick
shot,
I cut a " Colonel " in half,
And hooking a drive with a new
"Black Dot"
I killed an innocent calf.
At school and college athletic sports,
In the hope of winning a " pot,"
I always entered, in shoes and shorts,
But no guerdon I ever got.
Yet once the judges freely allowed
I had made a record throw,
For I hurled the hammer into the
crowd
And broke a policeman's toe.
In the company of the gentle sex
As a boy I was always scared,
And to ask a lady to give me a dance
I simply never dared.
Yet once, unafraid of a lovely maid,
I asked her to be my wife,
And the answer she gave made me
her slave
For the rest of my natural life.
MELOTHERAPY.
WONDERFUL EFFECT OF REED BANDS
ON THE STRONG-MINDED.
ENCOURAGED by the success of the
treatment of the feeble-minded by
music under the Metropolitan Asy-
lums Board at Witham, in Essex,
a distinguished practitioner, Dr. O.
BOWES, has during the last six
months carried on a system of what
he calls Melotherapeutics at his
establishment in Great Wigmorc
Street.
The great feature of the treatment
at Witham, according to a recent
issue of The Daily Chronicle, has
been the stimulating effect of brass
bands on the feeble-minded. Con-
versely, Dr. O. BOWES has now con-
clusively proved that people who are
suffering from an excessive strength
of mind, or mental hypertrophy, can
be reduced to a normal level by
listening to, or performing upon,
reed instruments. Interviewed by a
representative of Mr. Punch last
Saturday, Dr. O. BOWES stated that
the pulsations of the reed—whether
single or double—exerted an influ-
ence on the ganglia in the vicinity
of the tympanum which was little
short of thaumaturgic. "Our modus
operandi," he continued, "is as
follows: First we play to our strong-
minded patients, and then we induce
them to play on the reed instruments
themselves.
"Perhaps the most remarkab'e
cure I have effected is that of a
lady who had been sent to prison
four times for breaking the PRIME
MINISTER'S windows. As her case
was acute, I subjected her to the
most powerful register of the double
bassoon for five hours daily for a
fortnight. The results have been
entirely satisfactory. She has now
adopted what we call a 'hostile
attitude' towards Hyde Park, she
has no longer any desire to visit
Holloway, and has developed a posi-
tive passion for crewel-work, cookery
and other domestic pursuits.
"Another patient, who has ad-
vanced with great rapidity under the
new treatment, is Lady X. — for
obvious reasons I withhold her name.
In her case I prescribed the bass
clarinet. At the end of the first
week she evinced a disposition to
serenade Mr. LULU HARCOUKT; but
that soon passed, and she is now
so wedded to her instrument that
she cannot be separated from it even
at meal-times. Ferociously misan-
thropic only a month ago, she now
entertains officers of the Territorial
Army to tea."
Dr. 0. BOWES further made the
interesting announcement that the
new Anti-Woman-Suffrage Society
were so favourably impressed by the
results of his treatment that they had
resolved to organise bands with a
special uniform to go throughout the
country applying the melotherapeutic
treatment on the spot to all persons
suffering from incipient suffragitis.
Chronic cases of cranial expansion
will, as heretofore, be treated in Great
Wigmore Street, the climate and
name of which seem to exert a peculi-
arly soothing influence on that dis-
tressing complaint.

A STAGE WHISPER AT THE EXHIBITION.
HJLTHLETES FHOH THE BTAJU1I!
SOAPOIDS.
(An anticipated development in li
cures.)
Do you wash'? It is a well-known
medical fact that scrubbing the face
and hands with chemical detergents
is absolutely ruinous to the delicate
outer fabric of the skin. You would
not pour a can of petrol on the side
of an aeroplane to make it go, would
you? Why then attempt to open the
pores of the cuticle and keep them
working by the external application
of saponaceous tablets and other
inferior frauds of the kind? Beware
of these as you would of a poison.
Water is equally dangerous. Why
is it that you meet so many people
every day in the street with grey
smut-stained faces and toil-begrimed
hands? Simply because they abrade
and destroy the elegant envelope
with which Nature has provided
their bodies, instead of treating it
rationally from within. The only
way to be clean is to swallow
soopoids, with their wonderful in-
ternal operation on the fibres and
nerve tissues. However dusty or
gritty * you may be, one dose of
Boapoids will set you right. The
pores will spring open and shed off
the unnatural accretion of foreign
substances as a snake sloughs its
skin.
Think, too, of the time and
money you will save. No more
tedious ablutions and ruinous water-
rates. You can swallow your
soopoid as you walk to the office, and
be as bright as a new pin.
Our final word is—If you have been
washing, stop it. If you have not,
don't begin. Spare your epidermis,
and swallow soapoids. Try Nature's
way, and be clean.
ONE MORE SOCIETY.
"No," said he, "I will not join
your Society. There is only one
Society I want to join, and that does
not exist."
I asked what it was.
"I would join a Society," he said,
"for supplying people to whom
books are lent with a good working
idea of what those books are about,
suitable for use in conversation with
the confounded lenders.''
It took me some time to get this
into my head. I asked him to say
it again.
"I would join a Society," he
said, " that, when I have a book lent
me, would tell me enough about it to
enable me to say the right thing
when I took it back."
"You are bothered by book-
lenders? " I said.
"Horribly. One used to hear that
book-borrowers were the real pests,
but it is not true. I don't mind who
borrows my books, but I should like
to think that I am never to have a
book lent me again."
"But why do you take them? **
Because I am polite and weak-
minded, and the people who lend
them to me are so strong, and are so
sure I shall love reading them."
"And you never do?"
"Never; they are the only books
it is impossible to read."
"But an opinion is expected from
you?"
Exactly. How quick you are!"
Thinking it over, I have come to the
conclusion that there is something in
it, and a real opening has been found
at last for hundreds of leisurely men
and women with literary tastes. I
can imagine this in The Athcnaum:—
To those upon whom books have been forced.
—Conversational Abstracts of lent books pro-
vided at the shortest notice. Suitable adjectives
a speciality.—Apply, etc.
Who knows? It may come to this
if the masterful lending habit con-
tinues to spread. .

position. Vote for something over
a quarter of a million for medical
expenses proposed; the Major ob-
jected. Encouraged by the sup-
port of that other eminent states-
man, CLAUDE HAY, he went length of
challenging division. Full 150 Mem-
bers ready to make deposition that
they saw him pass out when division
was called. Was seen to take up
position at wicket gate ready to assist
in counting his following. No sug-
gestion that ho had been over-
whelmed by their number. To tell
the truth, they were five all told.
Thus a couple of minutes—or, say,
two and a-half—sufficed for the
counting.
Thereupon it was the duty of
the Major, as one of the Tellers,
straightway to repair to the House,
and await completion of the counting
and the arrival of his co-Tellers. Here
they were, standing in a line: JACK
PEASE holding a paper in his hand
recording another Ministerial triumph
in Division Lobby; the MASTER OF
ELIBANK on his left; next to him
CLAUDE HAY. But where was Major

centration Camps during the war

St. Andrews Burghs? Not the kind
of person who might be overlooked
in casual inspection. If CATHCART
WASON, Himalaya of Members, were
not still with us, the Major, in re-
spect of physical proportions, would
be reckoned a mountain of a man.
Painful pause followed. Members
began to think of Lost Sir Massing-
berd, also of Edwin Drood, still
missing. Old Members recalled an
incident in Home Rule Parliament
of 1892—5 when an eminent states-
man, entering Lobby with apparent
intention of joining in division, was
not seen to emerge, nor was his vote
recorded. Lord PEEL, then in
SPEAKER'S Chair, appealed to on sub-
ject, delivered one of those sound
judgments which link his name with
SOLOMON'S.
"To my knowledge," he said,
"Members have gone into the Lobby
and they didn't always come out of
the Lobby."
The case of Major ANSTRUTHSR
GRAY, F.R.G.S., F.S.A., differed in-
asmuch as he had not gone into the
Lobby and therefore could not, by
reasonable persons, be expected to
come out. He stood at the entrance;
it was from the entrance he vanished
from human ken. Tension of situa-
tion, which brought beads of per-
spiration on spacious brow of CLAUDE
HAY, broken by cries of "Name!
Name I" This obviously a mere
expedient to relieve overcharged
feelings. What was wanted was not
the name, but the man—to be pre-
cise, the Major. To that end, Mem-
bers rushed wildly forth in search.
Meanwhile the three Tellers stood
forlornly at the Table.
Presently murmur of cheering heard
by doorway. Through the group
clustered at the Bar broke the
Major. In three strides he was at
the foot of the Table, and, falling
in line with the Tellers, heard the
result of division announced. For
the vote, 167; against it, 5.
SARK tells me explanation of the
incident quite simple. The Major,
who, though still a new Member,
has been in the running for belt of
Champion - Questioner, finds himself
of late falling to rear. ASHLEY, who
slackened off a bit a fortnight ago,
is making up for precious time lost.

Cuts short a cook's career.
No charms of form or feature
Were hers; she did not seem
At all the kind of creature
To waken love's young dream;

Eemembering her, would sob
To think there could be such a waist,
A nose so like a knob.
And yet, though one could merely
Consider MARY ANN
As built on a severely
Unornamental plan,
She was possessed of points that must
Have pleased a butcher's whim,
For Mr. JOHNSON found her just
The very girl for him.
Ah, heartstrings all a-flutter
With thrills of brimming bliss
Too deep for tongue to utter!
Will someone tell me this?
What are the female charms that make
A butcher's bosom hum,
And cause him to refuse to take
His wonted pabulum?
Swifter than any Jehu
Would he approach our door,
Bright as the brightest sea hue
The apron that he wore,
Soft as the fan of zephyr's wings
His voice, as day by day
He brought her chops and steaks and
things,
And smiled her heart away.
O shade of Mrs. BEETON,
Lament with one who feels
Almost as if he 'd eaten
His last of earthly meals;
The robber JOHNSON claims his bride
This morn, and we 're bereft;
No other cook, however wide,
Can fill the gap she 's left.

THE AKOND OF SWAT.
SEEING that we are all at this moment madly occu-
pied with athletics and that many bicycle races arc
included in the Titanic programme of the Olympic
(James, I now propose to relate the story of a certain
bicycle. I am not sure that there is any real end to
this story. So far as I remember, it just fades out
gently into eternity, and, for all I know, it may still be
going on.
The bicycle of which I speak became known to me
seme sixteen years ago. It was then carrying on a
blameless, but diversified, existence in Oxford. In
other words, it belonged to a bicycle agent and manu-
facturer, and from time to time it was hired out to
undergraduates who desired to use it for the purpose of
coaching their College boats from the towpath of the Isis.
Of such undergraduates none was more expert and
determined than my friend ROBERTS—we will call him
ROBERTS—of Magdalen College. He lived with his
understudy DICKSON, also of Magdalen, in Long Wall
Street, and their " digs." were renowned for hospitality,
for dogs, and for the number of oars, the trophies of
victory, that lined and adorned their walls. The hospi-
tality was profuse—cold fowl, cold lamb, salad, biscuits
and marmalade—the dogs were wire-haired terriers, and
were usually to be found on the armchairs, and the oara
were of the ordinary pattern with six-inch blades.
On a certain morning after lectures it occurred to
ROBERTS that he wanted to coach his College eight and
would require a bicycle in the afternoon. He imme-
diately sent DICKSON, his slave and worshipper, to
hire a machine, and DICKSON duly proceeded to the
bicycle shop, selected a spruce and promising bicycle,
mounted it, and so conveyed it back to Long Wall
Street, where he left it propped against the wall out-
side his lodgings. He then reported the success of
his mission to his leader, and both of them set to work
on their lunch. After lunch, since time hung heavy
on the hands of ROBERTS, he decided to take a pre-
liminary tour on his new acquisition. He opened the
front-door and looked about him, but the bicycle was
nowhere to be seen.
It was not in the nature of ROBERTS, an oarsman of
great pluck and polish, to sit down meekly under this
intolerable affront. Having by a severe cross-examina-
tion brought home to DICKSON the burdens and respon-
sibilities of existence, he at once sent him to the police
station to give information as to the disappearance of
the bicycle on which he had so confidently counted.

[JULY 22,1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DICKSON, feeling that his reputation and his friendship
with ROBERTS were at stake, hurried off, and within a
few minutes the Oxford police shook their helmeted
heads, assumed an air of sagacity, and promised to
enquire. When DICKSON returned to Long Wall Street
he was shocked and alarmed to find the bicycle, the
object of his complaints, safely propped once more
against the wall. There was only one thing to be done,
and he did it by hastening back to the police-station and
relieving the mind of the Inspector. When, after the
accomplishment of this humane duty, he once more
came in sight of his lodgings, lo and behold, the bicycle
had vanished again. Thoroughly unmanned he fled up
the street, appealing for succour as he went; but as he
fled he happened to turn round, and there, sure enough,
was the demon bicycle resting against its now familiar
wall as if nothing had happened. DICKSON rushed upon
it, seized it and conveyed
it within the house. Then,
having locked the door,
he sat down upon the
stairs and endeavoured
in vain to think out the
situation.
I must now hark back
an hour or so in order
that you may learn that
in the house adjoining
that of ROBERTS and
DICKSON there lived
COCKBURN, of University
College, an aquatic hero
of fame almost equal to
that of ROBERTS. He,
too, had proposed to
coach an eight and had
desired to hire a bicycle.
Preceding DICKSON by
a few minutes, he had
gone to the shop, had
selected the identical bi-
cycle which was after-
wards to attract the
fancy of DICKSON, and,
not wishing at that
moment to ride it him-
self, had instructed the
man to send it on later
to his lodgings. There-
upon, as you already
know, the ineffable DICKSON had come and taken it
away. It is no part of the story to explain why they
let him have it.

condemned DICKSON as incompetent, got up on the
machine and pedalled cheerfully away.
I feel that this story is now strangling me, but I must
proceed at all risks. COCKBURN, coming out once more,
observed that there was no bicycle, and he, too, fled
on the wings of fear to the police to give information
of his dreadful and inexplicable loss. DICKSON also re-
turned, as I have described, and went shrieking up Long
Wall Street. Then ROBERTS pedalled back, propped the
bicycle and went within; and lastly DICKSON turned
round, seized the bicycle and took it into his lodgings.
ROBERTS eventually had the bicycle, DICKSON was
restored to favour, and COCKBURN, a distracted man,
went roaming over Oxford searching for a machine
which had eluded him. The police have never under-
stood the business, and
are still confusedly look-
ing about them for a
bicycle which has long
since gone to the scrap-
heap. The agent lost a
valued customer in COCK-
BURN, but regained pos-
session of his bicycle.
He, too, has never under-
stood the ins and outs
of the painful story; but
he was a man of no
imagination and cared
little for romance. I find

ALONO, OLD QII1L. You 'VE HAD QUITE ENOUUII TO DKINK!"
When COCKBURN, having lunched briefly but suffici-
ently elsewhere, returned to his house in Long Wall
Street, he was pleased to see the bicycle against the
wall where DICKSON had left it. "The man," he said
to himself, " is prompter than I thought him," and, fired
by his new sense of ownership, he immediately mounted
the machine and rode off for a practice spin. It was
at about this time that ROBERTS and DICKSON emerged
from next door, with the result that DICKSON paid his
first visit to the police. In the meantime COCKBUUN
came back, deposited the bicycle, and went into his
own house, with the result that, as you have been told,
DICKSON hastened again to the constabulary. At this
moment ROBERTS, moved by some presentiment, decided
to take the air. He came out, found the bicycle, rashly
"Hatton finished off the in-
nings in great style. He took
the fifth and sixth wickets witli
successive balls. Had not a
catch been missed his next
delivery would have yielded a
victim also. Oft the second ball
of his next over he finished the
innings by doing the hat-trick."

We don't quite see how
he did the hat trick in
one ball, but seeing how
near he had come to it the over before, and that his
name was simply crying for it, we are ready to
believe.
"Room for improvement" is one of the attractions
offered in an advertisement in The Liverpool Daily Post
of a publichouse to lot; but we are afrajd that the
billiard room mentioned just before will prove the more
attractive of the two. Still it is a worthy idea, and we
should like to bring it to Mr. ASQUITH'S notice.

The attempt of the Suffragettes last Thursday to seize
a pitch for themselves at the Oval was frustrated, stump
oratory being no part of the programme for HAYES'S

by brooches bearing the initials L.B.W. (" Let "s Be

and addresses of the several passengers
shall be taken as being accessories be-
fore the fact, on the ground that, with-
out such public patronage, the vehicle
would not be running, or failing to run,
at all.
The police shall then, with all possible
despatch, request the attendance of a
magistrate to read the Riot Act (Geo. I.),

assembled.
Failing the peaceable departure of the
latter, the military shall be called out,

In any case, a cordon shall be drawn
across the road, and barriers erected
one hundred yards in front of, and
behind, the cause of obstruction, with
the notice "Road Stopped by Order of
the L.C.C." legibly exhibited.
As soon as all householders within one
quarter mile radius have bo<?n warned to
put up their shutters, and, in the case of
shop-keepers, to barricade their shop-
fronts, a detachment of Royal Engineers
shall be summoned to blow up the
stationary motor-bus with dynamite.
On the removal of the debris, which
must be effected within two hours of the
explosion, and after due inspection by
the Chairman of the London County
Council, provided that he was at the
moment of the breakdown not more
than fifty miles from the scene, the street

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
JOHN TREVENA has told us all about Furze the Cruel,
and his last novel, which he calls Hcailier (ALSTON
RIVERS), might well have been named "Heath the
Horrible," for a larger collection of unpleasant charac-
ters has seldom appeared in a single book before. It
would be a positive relief to come across an escaped
convict after encountering a few of the author's eccen-
trics and solitaries. Some of them have consumption
and live in a kind of open-air sanatorium on the moor,
where they have to feed for all they are worth, regard-
less of immediate consequences. Others are "com-
moners" of Dartmoor Forest, residing at Wheal Dream
in a state of dirt and unpleasantness that the daily
papers (but not Mr. TREVENA) would undoubtedly find
"indescribable." Then there is a vicar who burns
down most of the village (of which he is also
landlord) in order to
send the insurance
money to his wife
who has run off with
another man; and an
artist, George
Brunacombe, who re-
minds mo of nothing
so much as the old
man with the beard,
of Limerick fame.
But the author's
power, pitiless
though it is, is mag-
nificent, and he pre-
sents the savage
charm of his country
with an almost
terrifying enthropo-
morphism that
haunts the reader
long after the book
is finished. It is
pleasant to relate
that the only two
tolerable people in
the story, George
and Winifred, come together at the end, though their
union is slightly irregular, and that the former, on
becoming suddenly famous, decides to wash. I can-
not help thinking that all the nice clean cottages down
Dartmoor way must be occupied by the other novelists
as lodgers, for Mr. JOHN TKEVKXA does not seem to
have found any.
Jack Spurlock, Prodigal (MUKRAY), by GEORGE
HORACE LORIMER, reads as if it were written for serial
publication. This tends to spoil the interest, for one
gets into the way, after a chapter or two, of knowing
just where to expect a minor climax, and one is con-
scious every now and then that the author is expanding
the matter to fill the space. Still there is a good deal
of fun, and some sound sense, in the account of Jack
Spurlock's struggles to exist after that Captain of In-
dustry and Railway Magnate his father has "turned
him from his do'," as Major Magoffin Jackson (a de-
lightful character) puts it, and before that "do" " has
been opened to welcome him back. It is all as American
as buckwheat cake with maple syrup. So American
is it, indeed, that on the strength of its evidence one

is moved to reform certain old-standing opinions. One
is inclined, for instance, to doubt all one hears about
Yankee hustle when one reads that Jack " was like the
bank cashier who, in answer to a hurry-call from his
wife to get rich quick, loaded up with Steel Common
at fifty, only to find the toboggan greased and the bank
examiner at the door." It would have saved so much
time (which, I understand, is valuable in America) to
say merely that he made a bad bargain.
I wish I could help Mr. JOHN GALSWORTHY. His
restless discontent with the social system is shown in
every chapter of this collection of sketches, A Com-
mentary (GRANT RICHARDS), but he makes no effort to
construct a better system. He sees a poor man in
consumption; a convict in a prison; a fashionable lady in
her carriage; or perhaps he hears of some anomaly in
the Divorce Laws; and he says bitterly to himself,
"It's all wrong." Whether the question "How can
it be put right?" occurs to him then, I cannot say;
there is no sign of it
in this book. Nor
can I say whether
Mr. GALSWORTHY ever
sees anything good in
the world; if he
does, he thinks it is
hardly worth while to
comment on it. His
attitude appears to
be: "There is a vast
amount of suffering
going on, and the
thought of it makes
me very uncomfort-
able. I am going to
tell you all about it
and make you un-
comfortable, too;and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UNLIMITED LULU.
[With compliments to the Right Hon. LEWIS HARCOCRT, First Commis-
sioner of Works, to \vhose multifarious functions and versatile tact a
contemporary has lately directed attention.]
You who, by right of office, fill the chair
When Britain tenders public hospitality
(In hope of feeding angels unaware)
To foreigners from every known locality,
And all the tongues of Babel
Are urged to eat as much as they are able;
In you how many graceful functions blend!
It is your dearest joy as well as duty
To elevate the Cockney and extend
His latent interest in London's beauty;
It is, in fact, your part
To mould his tasto for Monumental Art.
To you alone the Royal Parks belong:
If in those scenes designed for meditation
The Suffragette would like to come out strong,
It is to you that she must make oblation;
The very grass and trees
Must ask you, "May we go on growing, please?"
It is beneath your mild but searching eye
That char-maids purge the House with mop and
besom;
To you the Peers uplift a plaintive cry
To have their pews repaired, and you appease 'em;
Or, should you choose to doubt
If they deserve it, then they go without.
Some men rely on Grace and some on Works;
You shine in both; a subtle air of fitness
Under your nobly-groomed exterior lurks,
And even Tories take delight to witness
Your perfect self-control,
Your limpid Lulucidity of soul. O. S.
MY DRAMATIC DEBUT.
You may have seen a letter which was recently pub
lished by an important London journal, signed " One o
the Great Unacted." It was mine. Unsuspected by
the simple souls of Brickville, I have written and.sub
mitted to the so-called actor-managers of London, under
whose senseless and emasculating sway the genius o
our younger playwrights is being slowly but surelj
crushed out of existence, several plays of undoubtec
though unacknowledged merit. Inept adaptations o
unpleasant Continental dramas, wholly unsuited to th<
purer atmosphere of the British stage, and mutilatec
and bowdlerised till they have entirely lost what littl
original virtue they possessed, are daily accepted by th
so-called actor-managers of the Metropolis, under whose
senseless and emasculating sway But I perceive
that I am repeating myself and my letter. As yoi
have doubtless read it, this is an unnecessary waste o
time. I turn from the general to the particular.
One of these rejected addresses was couched in th
form of a duologue, :it once wise and witty and tende
and true. For five years and four months it had gon
the round of the principal managers in London, only t
return to me, time after time, like the dove to the ark
its delicate plumage soiled and disfigured by thumb
marks, which, had they had their deserts, would Ion
ago have been registered at Scotland Yard. Little di
I think when it was refused for the sixth tirnq that Mrt>
MASTERMAN, our Rector's wife at Brickville, would be
the humble and unconscious means of its seeing the
glare of the footlights. Little did I think—7- But that
belongs to a later part of the story. For the present,
I need only say that, when I yielded to Mrs. M.'s
demand for my assistance in raising funds for a new
churchyard, I concealed the fact that the play which I
promised to produce, with the assistance of GLADYS,
vas my own. I was resolved that it should be judged
qlely on its own merits.
It was.
During the frequent arm-chair rehearsals which were
lecessary before we were word-perfect (the mere acting
vas a comparatively simple matter, as, like all good
rama, my play acted itself), GLADYS once or twice ex-
>ressed a fear that the Brickvillians might not see its
eal beauty. Hadn't we better, she asked, do some-
hing which their unsophisticated minds would be able to
*rasp'? Surely there must be some play
I assured her that, as far as my experience went,
here was none, and that it would be all right on the
night, she would see. And, though privately I shared
ler apprehensions, they proved to be quite unfounded.
Six times we were called before the curtain, and only
he obvious jealousy of the stage-manager—the Brick-
alle butcher—prevented me from responding to an un-
deniable seventh appeal. But I found consolation in
,he somewhat bitter thought that, for each of the rebuffs
which I had received in London, Brickville had given
me a call.
After it was all over, Mrs. M. came up to me in her
lamboyant manner (inclined, as I often think, to
embonpoint), and tapped me on the shoulder with her
[an.
"Splendid!" she cried. "Magnificent! How ever
.lid you do it? You were both first-rate. I can't tell
you how grateful I am. You must always act for me."
I smiled a deprecating smile, secretly enjoying my
long-deferred triumph. "Did you really like it?" I
asked. "Didn't strike you as being amateurish?"
"Not a bit!" she said. "I was just going to tell
you. Some friends of mine in the audience saw the
piece performed in London by professionals. And they
didn't do it half so well as you and Miss GLADYS!"
GLADYS looked at me, and I looked at GLADYS, and
we grinned, and while I was thinking of a really neat
way of scoring off Mrs. M. without being too severe she
took up her parable again.
"Of course," she said, "it was all the acting. Silly
little piece, isn't it? I wonder who it's by. But you
got such a lot out of it. You really must go on the
stage, both of you." And she fluttered off to her next
victim.
And then, somehow, such is the divine power of
svmpathy with which some women are blessed, I found
tliat all unconsciously, seeking only to heal my wounded
self-esteem, GLADYS had slipped her little hand into
mine. Mrs. MASTERMAN'S failure to appreciate the fine
and subtle qualities of my play had brought about the
complete understanding with GLADYS which I had long
sought in vain to compass by more direct methods. And
so, though, like all true artists, I abhor the banal con-
vention of a happy ending, my own story is brought to s
close to the sound of wedding bells.
There is only one subject on which GLADYS and I a«
not agreed. She persists in thinking, as I confess I die
myself at first, that Mrs. M. lied about her friends ir
the audience. But I am not so certain. After all, 1
seldom vijit a London theatre, It seems to me mon

LINES TO THE LAST STRAWBERRY.

Whose comrades have incarnadined my platter,
Late laggard of July, and just about
To pass away into a pinkish batter,
I pause to dash
The tuar-drop from my eye, before I mash I
I shall not feel, I think, such fond regret
When dying roses make the lawn look squalid,
Nor when, too soon, across the slackened net
The last white orb of summer has been volleyed,
As now I do
Soft spheroid, in eviscerating you.
What garden was it, languorous with scent,
Where first the morning sun began to mottle
Your homely features in the heart of Kent?
And ere they packed you in the leaf-lined pottle
On what low bed
Of patent compost did you hide your head?
I cannot say. But, anyhow, the stream,
The still, white stream of, Lethe laps you closely;
The sifted sweetness mingles with the cream;
You perish, but you shall not perish grossly;
A form so fab
Deserves some pomp—Great Heavens, what was that?
Vile ingrate! Scarlet hypocrite! Is this
The way you treat the fervour of a port?
What madness of the gods, what Nemesis
(You looked the nicest of the lot, you know it)
Has made me sing
The mausoleum of a Creeping Thing?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SALAMIS SIDE-LIGHTS.
[Contributed by our Kxtremely Sporting Cor-
respondent, Author of "Maratlion Memora-
bilia," "Marathonia," "Mince-meat from Mara-
thon," etc., etc.]
THE Salamis Race, which is due to
take place on Friday at Henley, will
bring to a fitting conclusion the
series of International aquatic con-
tests upon which the eyes of the
sporting world have been fixed for
the past few days.
The Origin of the Race.
As all my readers know by this
time, this race is called the Salamis
Race because it commemorates the
famous eight-oared crew, stroked by
one PHEIDIPPIDES, which rowed from
Salamis to Athens to announce the
news of the great Greek victory over
the Persian fleet, the distance be-
tween the two places being approxi-
mately the same (if we allow for the
difference in the Greek calendar) as
that which will be negotiated upon
the Henley course on Friday.
The world's best crews are com-
peting, they are in splendid condi-
tion, and international rivalry is
acute. Though it is too early yet to
venture to name the winner, I may
safely predict that the winning crew,
whichever it may be, will take a lot
of beating.
The Course.
But, first, a few words as to the
course. Below will be found a map
of the Salamis Route.
[We much regret to say that our
Extremely Sporting Correspondent
has (by some error) sent its, instead
of a plan of the Salamis Route, what
appears to be a chart of the District
Railway between St. James' Park
and Hammersmith. .4s this can be
seen at any Underground station, we
forbear to reproduce it.— EDITOR.]
The course is in excellent condi-
tion, the surface being delightfully
smooth; all the competing crews are
enthusiastic about it, and are loud in
their praises of the trouble the
A.R.A. have taken to prepare it.
On the whole, a wonderfully level
route has been chosen, hills of
any steepness having been carefully
avoided.
Where to See the Race.
That the whole course will be
lined with spectators goes without
saying. I have, with some diffi-
culty, prepared a list of trains and
trams to the different points on the
route, and •
[Our Correspondent has been too
conscientious. The simplest way in
to drive or train to Henley, walking
or rowing from there to the desired
position.—EDITOR.]
Time Table of Race.
The times at which the leading
crew may be expected at the differ-
ent points named •
[Seeing that, if the Daylight
Saving Bill sliould pass before the
Salamis Race is rowed, all these
times ivould become extremely mis-
leading, we have decided to hold
them over.—EDITOR.]
"Who's Who" of Crews.
Long Boat and Pontj: Sensational Story.
CANADA.—The Canadian long boat
(or, as we should say, " light ship "),
is much fancied to win the race. The
crew of the "long boat" have not
been training with the Canadian run-
ners at the Stadium, but have been
rowing at Henley, where they have
accomplished some sensational times,
on several occasions arriving at the
winning-post before their coach, who
was upon a pony.
CAMBRIDGE. — The oldest of the
competitors. Slightly on the wrong
side of six hundred and seventy.
Best suited by firm going and dry
surface. Much fancied to win.
LEAXDEU.—The only Greek entry
which has any chance of success. Its
victory would be extremely popular
at Athens. Much fancied to win.
BELGIUM.—With a high-springing
action, this country, upon which the
Belgians pin their faith, should be
well up in the front. Much fancied
to win.
Salamis Smatterings.
A herring won the last Salamis
Race.
There is great diversity of opinion
as to what is the best nourishment
to take during the race. All agree
upon the value of a wet sponge
passed over the head and neck at
intervals during the contest. Luckily,
there is plenty of water obtainable for
this purpose.
The original Salamis course was
over salt water. At Henley the
water is fresh. To avoid any suspi-
cion of unfairness the Committee has
explained the nature of the difference
to the foreign competitors.
Curiously enough, the last Salamis
Race was won by a herring. This is
the first recorded instance of such a
thing happening.
It is considered unlikely that any
of the competitors will mistake the
route. A. A. M.
THE BATTLE OF AVOIRDUPOIS.
[In the final of the Olympic Tug-of-War the
Dity Police pulled over the Liverpool Police.
The light-weight of the former team is stated
to have scaled 14 stone.]
WHEN the foaming sea-god thunders
On the mute marine parade;
When the home-bound Vanguard
blunders
And the kerb is badly frayed;
When the bull-whale seeks revenge in
Battle for his consort slain;
When one sees a donkey engine
Drive a crane—
Things like these convey a notion
To the human weakling's mind
Of colossal power in motion,
Bulk and majesty combined:
Pulses in the heart are shaken
By those mammoth powers at play,
Much as by a tonic taken
Thrice a day.
But of all titanic tussles
That can sound the soul's abyss,
Was there ever match of muscles
Worthy to be ranked with this'.'
What were all the Hellene's hobbies,
What the pagan wrestler's scope,
When compared with Briton's
bobbies
On a rope?
Milo with his beefy dinners,
Zeus-engendered Heracles,
All the roll of classic winners
Would not take the boote of these;
Evermore in moments idle
I shall muse upon the scenes
Where they stamped their fratricidal
Small eighteens.
And at eve, when ROBERT drowses
Softly at his usual post,
While the careless world carouses,
I shall drain a silent toast
To that deathless tourney proper,
Where, before a gaping throng,
Copper made immortal copper
"Pass along."
LITERARY GOSSIP.
["A New York publisher has lately Ijern
sending round the American Press a brief
biographical notice of Mrs. HcsiriinT WARU,
in which it is mentioned, among other things,
that she is a granddaughter of 'the famous
Dr. ARNOLD, who wrote the Tom Hroicn stories.'"

novel is shortly to be. expected from

life have achieved BO wide a popu-
larity of recent years, is. we under-
stand, a collateral descendant of the
illustrious Miss ANNE BULLEN, whose
remarkable romance The Cruise of
the Cachalot, first brought her to the
notice of KING HENRY VIII.
The late R. L. STEVENSON, though
he spelt his name differently, was,
we are assured on the best American
authority, a grandson of the famous
engineer, ROBERT STEPHENSON, to
whom Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING dedi-
cated his volume Menai Inventions.
Although it has been positively
stated in some of the best American
papers that Sir WILLIAM S. GILBERT
is distantly connected with GILBERT
WHITE of Selborne, we have good
authority for asserting that this in-
teresting allegation is unfounded.
On the other hand, Mr. PERCY
WHITE, the first large edition of
whose new novel has been entirely
exhausted, undoubtedly bears the
surname of the gifted naturalist as
well as that of BLANCO WHITE the
eminent poet, a fact which is in
itself strong presumptive evidence of
hereditary genius.
An extraordinarily interesting dis-
covery has just been made by Mr.
VOLNEY P. SLOCUM, the literary
paragraphist of The Pitfsbing Clarion.
It is to the effect that East Lynne
and many other novels were written
by Mrs. HENRY WOOD, the gifted
vocalist and wife of the renowned
conductor who presides over the
Queen's Hall orchestra with such
magisterial prestidigitation. The same
writer has also placed it beyond a
doubt that Mr. FRANK R. BENSON,
the illustrious tragedian, is the author
of Through a College Window, The
Upton Letters, and the "Dodo"
books.
Mr. W. II. HUDSON, the famous
naturalist and author of The Purple
Land, has written to the Athcnceum
to contradict the statement of the
New York Bookie that at nn earlier
stage of his career he was known as
HUDSON the Railway King.

THE POSTMAN.
HAD it been an ordinary letter, the
fellow would have just slipped it in-
side the letter-box and said nothing
about it. But, you see, it was not
an ordinary letter. People who
write ordinary letters do not write
them to me, either because they
think that I am too aesthetic to
tolerate the colour of a penny stamp,
or because they cannot bring them-
selves to make the necessary outlay,
or because they do not know my
address. I rarely, if ever, receive
letters from people outside the Ser-
vices; in fact I may say that my only
regular correspondent is the Army
and Navy, whom I met over n deal
in socks. One is perhaps a small
number for a complete circle of
friends, but I venture to think that
there is more in my one friend than
in twenty of your everyday acquaint-
ances. My friend is the sort of
creature who knows a bit about
everything; and a friend who can
and does tell you all about the
quality and price of all known things
and draw pictures of most of them
is a friend whose correspondence is
worth having, even though he is only
a Stores.
Now, my letter-box is built
especially to fit my correspondence.
It will only admit the ordinary-sized
letter, and the people who write the
ordinary-sized letter do not write it
(as I have said) to me. Therefore
the Postman cannot put my letter
into the box, but must give it to me
personally. That he cannot do if T
am not here; so that, when I am
away, my friend cannot write to me,
a fact which saves him trouble and
me disappointment. Hence the four
knocks on the door and the Postman
waiting without.
"Come inside, won't you? " I said
to him.
"Now that is really nice of you,"
said the dear old fellow (as I thought
him then) with tears in his eyes.
"I have called on 487 others this
evening and not one of them has even
answered the door."

"The door should not ask ques-
tions," I said in my jocular way, as I
led him through into the sitting-room.
Once ensconced in our chairs before
the fire where the July log was
blazing, "How do you like being
a Postman?" I asked him, more to
start the conversation than with a
view of eliciting scandalous chit-
chat.
"Oh, so-so," he answered. "How
do you like not being a Postman?"
and" from that we passed on to such
other topics as a Postman and a non-
Postman would naturally discuss
together. "If you were to guess,"
he said, "how many letters were
delivered in a year. ..."
"I should," I interrupted, " guess
wrong."
"But delivering a letter," he con-
tinued, "is not the simple job you
suppose it to be. Ours is a
difficult and responsible position,
which requires a great deal of tact-
ful discretion. Take this block of
flats, for instance. The minute my
rat-tat. . . ."
"I beg your pardon."
"I beg yours," he said.
"Let each keep his own," 1
suggested, " and consider the mutual
transaction as complete."
"The minute," he pursued, "there
is heard the double knock, which no
other than a Postman can give and
than which a Postman can give no
other, everyone in the building ex-
pects a letter. 'There 's BANKS,' you
say to yourself; 'he 's a decent sort
of fellow, let 's give him one. Then
there 's CLEAVER—he 's got as much
as is good for him already; and I
gave Miss SAUNDERS one yesterday.
FRASER means well; give him a post-
card. HEBBLETHWAITE doesn't; give
him a bill.' And so on."
"Why, then," I said a little
crossly perhaps, "do you nearly
always leave me out?"
"Well, you see, old man," he said
apologetically, " if I give you a letter
in the morning, you go back to bed
and stay there reading it when you
ought to be getting up, and, if I
give you one in the evening, you stay
up reading it when you ought to be
going to bed. As you are always out
for the afternoon delivery, what is a
man to do?"
"Have a cigarette," I said, " and
take it that you are forgiven."
"Thanks," he answered, putting
his hand in his bag; " have a letter."
I blessed him for the kindly
thought and gazed casually at the
half-penny stamp. "Ah," I said,
"from the Army. Do you know
him?"
"Army? " he said. "Let me see.
Doesn't he live with the Navy down
Victoria way? Oh, yes, I know him
fairly well; I call on him about five
times a day."
"Excuse me opening it? " I asked
in my best manner.
"1 would excuse you willingly,"
he replied, "did the letter not
happen to be open already."
"For once, old Thing," I laughed,
"you are wrong. For this time only
by some curious chance they have
licked the flap."
"Indeed? " he said curtly, examin-
ing the envelope, which was obviously
closed. "Then you owe me a penny."
1 was too much hurt to argue with
him, so paid him the penny with
frigid politeness, telling him at the
same time what I thought of this
petty extortion. He saw I was up-
set and tried to pass the whole thing
off as a joke, but it became plain
that it was no joke when he refused
to give me my penny back. There
were words, and the upshot of it all
was that I told him that I should not
in future be at home when he
knocked. He answered with passion
that he should never knock again if
he could possibly avoid doing so, and
gave me back (as became a gentle-
man and a Postman) as much of my
cigarette as he had not smoked.
* * * *
Since that eventful evening he has
always brought old Stores' letters
when I have been out and has forced
them under the door. I hate to
think what would happen if someone
were to address to me a good-sized
parcel.
AMUSEMENT.
FOE the tenth .time I laid aside
the volume by Mrs. HENRY WOOD.
Under other conditions I might have
managed it; but this afternoon it was
impossible. The rain grew worse
as the glass rose higher. For the
tenth time I endeavoured to find
something new in The Daily Tele-
graph: I even read the advertise-
ments. I walked round the pictures
again, and again read the funeral
card that was stuck in the mirror:
SAUAII ANN THURSBY, aged 59. A
very easy age at which to die, I
thought it. It was a wonder that
she had lived so long. Her end was
peace, anyway.
The rain was worse than ever, and
the glass higher than ever. An old
man was crossing the road under an
umbrella, which so dripped that he
was wetter in one part of his back
than he would have been all over had
he carried a walking-stick. What was
I to do? The train did not go for;!
two hours yet; and a time comes
when old Tatters and old Sketches,
celebrating plays long since dead, are'
less entertaining than nothing. Why.
had I not Mr. GLADSTONE'S gift of
going to sleep at any moment? One
should cultivate it.
I wondered if HAYES had insured
himself against this weather, and, if
not, how he was taking his luck. I
opened a cupboard in the hope of
finding another book, but it con-
tained only a pack of cards and some
bagatelle balls. I looked out of the
window again. The sky grew lighter
with that lightness which, while on
some days it means a clearing up, on
days like this means worse rain.
The gramophone in the bar began to
sing. I turned again to Mrs. HENRY
WOOD.
At this moment the door was
knocked and the servant-girl came
in carrying a book. "Please, sir,"
she said, "Mrs. WINTER sends you
the Visitors' Book with her compli-
ments, and hopes you may be
amused by it."
"Amused! Delightful word. I had
thought never to be amused again.
1 took the book.
Have you ever examined the
Visitors' Book of a country inn,
either for amusement or with the
cold eye of criticism? It is appal-
ling. That is the only word 1 can
think of, and I use it deliberately.
Appalling. The beasts of the field be-
come intellectual beside the facetious
commentators and even serious com-
mentators of these volumes, which,
it must bo remembered, exist in their
thousands in this country alone.
"Dr. and Mrs. SILVESTER much
enjoyed their stay at the White Hart,
which they prolonged by two days
owing to the beautiful weather."
"Lord DORKING and the Earl of
PECKHAM can speak to the freshness
of the White Hart eggs. No elec-
tion brand here. Now we shan't be
long."
"Mr. LIPSCOMBE and the members
of the Roydale Botanical Society
made a Hart-y meal."
"The Roydale Botanical Society
understand chestnuts anyway!
E. THOMAS."
"' The Ten Boozers' arrived
from Pulverhampkm in time for
lunch, and very soon made the joint
look silly, especially His Nibs."

concluded their fifth annual visit.
Everything perfect as usual."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DiAEf OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July
20t/i.—One of the nights when the
shabbiness of red leather benches
lamented by Viscount RIDLEY is hid-
den by crowded assemblage. At
last the frozeti-out gardeners of the
legislative field, the coroneted un-
employed, have work to do. Old
Age Pensions Bill, read a first time
the other day in presence, and with
consent of, five Peers, comes up for
second reading. WOLVERHAMPTON,
youngest of Viscounts, making
maiden speech in moving the stage,
dexterously dragged in a tribute to
DON JOSE, " the Onlie Begetter " of
the scheme.
This meant to be awkward for
noble lords opposite who
denounce measure as ini-
quitious in conception,
ruinous to prosperity of the
country, dangerous to ex-
istence of Empire, inas-
much as its drain upon
public purse will necessi-
tate reduction of amount
appropriated to ImperiaJ
Defence. Fundamental
principle of politics that
circumstances alter cases.
What 's one man's nourish-
ing meat at a certain epoch
is deadly poison at another.
Thus in another place, in
debate on application of
guillotine rules to Licens-
ing Bill, we had PRINCE
ARTHUR crushing PREMIER
with quotation of uncom-
promising denunciation of
the practice, delivered by
him on former occasion;
ASQUITH retorting by reading from
same record passage in which PRINCE
ARTHUR extolled the guillotine as a
beneficial, indispensable factor in
legislation.
A pretty comedy, amusing at first,
apt to pall by reason of constant
repetition through revolving years.
By-and-by, characters exchanged, we
shall have Prime Minister PRINCE
ARTHUR having rigged up the guillo-
tine, reading extracts from ASQUITH'S
speech of last Friday in support of
his case; Leader of the Opposition
H. H. ASQUITH responding with
quotation of PRINCE ARTHUR'S wither-
ing denunciation of the practice. If
plot and play a little stale, the grave
air of conviction on part of principal
performers never varies.
Whilst noble lords, excelling each
other in denunciation of Old Age
Pensions Bill, redressed the balance
by voting for the second reading,
HAROLD Cox in the Commons poses
Government with awkward question.
Cites case of Mr. JAMES WALKER,
age fifty-five, recently charged with
bigamy at Huddersfield Police Court,
it being alleged that he had gone
through form of marriage with eleven
women.
"Will he," queried Cox (on
behalf of his hon. friend Box, tempor-
arily absent), " be entitled, on attain-
ing the age of seventy, to an Old Age
Pension? If not, under what pro-
vision of the Bill will he be excluded
from the reward intended for veterans
of industry?"
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,
discreetly taking refuge behind fact
that the case is sub judice, declined
to discuss it, nevprtheless, there it

stands. Type of innumerable diffi-
culties that will attend working of
proposed Act.
Business done.—Young WEMYSS'
motion designed to shelve Old Age
Pensions Bill finding only 16 sup-
porters in House of 139 Members, Bill
read a second time without division.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—
What a month ago seemed to be the
impossible has been accomplished.
To-night Clause 1 of Licensing Bill,
perhaps the most important of the
lot, got through Committee.
"It was the riding that did it,"
remarked the late Mr. PALMER, of
Rugeley, commenting on the verdict
of wilful murder and the consequent
sentence of death.
"It was the guillotine that did
it," the PREMIER might have ob-
served as he folded up his paper and
left Treasury Bench.
Gratitude has no place in politics.
Otherwise he would have halted on
his way out to shake PRINCE ARTHUR
warmly by the hand. It was he,
whilst Leader of the House,
who introduced this thrice-blessed
machinery, failing which all legisla-
tion would to-day be impossible.
At half-past ten the blade fell,
cutting through a thicket of redun-
dant amendments. On division
taken in crowded House, Clause 1
was added to the Bill by 348 votes
against 140.
ASQUITH has introduced new-
tactics .in generalship. Formerly—
notably in the giant days of Mr. G.,
who, with more than fourscore
years on his back, carried Home
Rule Bill of '93 through Committee
single-handed—Minister in charge of
important measure per-
sonally conducted it. One
of the Law Officers, perad-
venture an Under-Secre-
tary, was told off in
attendance; but in the
main it was a one-man job.
ASQUITH has got together
a finely selected team,
ready at a sign to step in
and reply to successive
points. It includes Ad-
miral MCKENNA, HERBERT
SAMUEL, who, starting well,
is daily improving, and
LULU. Among the younger
men, this an incomparable
trio of debating power.
On opposite Bench
PRINCE ARTHUR in constant
attendance. Has passed
a Licensing Bill himself;
knows all its ins and
outs. Watchful, wary,
dexterous, he fights with his back to
the wall all through the summer
night. WALTER LONG, BON\U LAW,
and SON AUSTEN chip in from time
to time. Practically on the Opposi-
tion side it is a one-man fight.
At the outset SON AUSTEN got a
rather nasty tumble. With right-
eous indignation denounced what he
described as proposal of the Bill to
reduce to the unit licences in country
villages. HERBERT SAMUEL said the
Bill contained no such proposal.
Across the Table he quietly handed
a copy, indicating the lines dealing
with the case.
Through awkward pause SON
AUSTEN studied the text. No doubt
about it; someone had blundered.
Would he admit his error, apologise
and resume his seat? Not he. He
turned upon the INFANT SAMUEL and
hotly complained of interruption.

Opposition, taking the cue, loudly
cheered.
"We only ask," said PREMIER,
interposing, "that the right hon. gen-
tleman should read our Bill before
he criticises it."
Here Ministerialists broke in with
strident cheer.
SON AUSTEN had gained his point.
Amid the angry scene his blunder
was overlooked. But only tempor-
arily. The House, to certain extent a
business assembly, thinks that, after
all, there is something in the
PREMIER'S insistence on essential pre-
liminary to discussing a Bill.
Business done.—Clause 1 of Licens-
ing Bill passed through Committee.

Sittings.
Friday.—Some men are never
satisfied. Members to-day enjoy
privileges and comforts unknown to
predecessors of go short a time back
as twenty years. LULU, most popu-
lar of First Commissioners, has
marked his short reign by various
improvements. As for the Kitchen
Committee, under Chairmanship of
JACOBY, it has wrought wonders.
Think of the shilling dinner: Soup,
fish, choice of two entrees, joint,
game in season, tarts galore, rich
choice of cheese, and bread at discre-
tion.
True, the quails arc small. SARK,
turning the thing over to-night in
quest of scraps of flesh, says he
understands how in ancient Palestine
two sparrows were sold for a far-
thing. But what would you? There
are limits to the possibilities of a
shilling, even in JACOBY's dexterous
hand.
Now, here comes HARWOOD want-
ing a verandah built over a portion
of the Terrace, so that in wet
weather Members may meditate on
the spectacle of the storm-swept
Thames.
"We like," he said, "to enjoy
fresh air, even when it is raining."
This a novel view of the busi-
ness for which Members are sent to
Westminster—to sit on the Terrace
and enjoy fresh air, wet or shine.
"I may remind my hon. friend,"
retorted LULU with grave sarcasm,
"that there is abundant supply of
excellent fresh air within this
Chamber."
Business done.—Report stage of

A TRIAL TRIP.
WHEN quite young I made a model
fire-escape, an ambulance, a torpedo
destroyer, a Thames dredger, an
electric tram, a toy lathe, and a
half-plate camera.
"Why don't you make a micro-
scope?" said JORKINS one evening
as we were giving the dredger a
run across the dining-room carpet.
"Done!" I replied. "I will. I
will make it in chapters."
CHAPTER I.
The Eye Piece.
The Eye Piece is, as everyone
knows, situate in a pleasant resi-
dential locality at the extreme north
of the instrument. When examining
a caterpillar's collar stud or a spider's
spinning jenny, it will be the first
thing that strikes one's eye. Hence,
I suppose, its name. Mine con-
sisted of two lenses, which I picked
up dirt cheap at a second-hand book-
stall.
The object of the Eye Piece is to
prevent children from falling down
the tube of the microscope and so
injuring the objective.
CHAPTER II.
The Tube.
Unlike most other tubes, the Tube
of the microscope has no interme-
diate stations. I christened one end
of mine Shepherd's Bush, and the
other Bank. When a dandelion's
foreleg got in at the Shepherd's
Bush end it travelled right through
(growing larger and larger), until the
man at the Eye Piece called out
"Bank!" Then it got out.
CHAPTER III.
The Mechanical Stage.
The Mechanical Stage is that part
of the microscope specially devoted
to dramatic productions. It is here
we place our troupe of highly-trained
rhizopods, our comedy trio of cheese-
mites. Ifc is worked on the Two-

House system. As soon as one turn
has finished, a twist of the milled
head brings on another, and number
one waits in the wings for the
Second House.
CHAPTER IV.
Having described my' microscope
in detail, I will now give a short
account of her speed trials. They
took placo one Sunday evening, i
was the commodore, JORKINS the
stoker, and SYMPSON watched for the
Admiralty. Having broken a bottle
of dry ginger ale over her bows,
SYMPSON said we might proceed to
test her engines.
GRAND FINAL EPISODE.
The Drop of Water.
Selection by the orchestra—A Life
on the Ocean Wave.
The first object to be examined
was a drop of pond water. JORKINS
had gathered it, and assured us that
it teemed with microscopic life.
"Then, hard-a-port," I shouted, and
we dropped it on the mechanical
stage.
"What do you see?" I asked
SYMPSON, who was at the Eye Piece.
"Nothing," replied SYMPSON.
"Put her two points to wi?id-
ward," I called out to JORKINS, who
had now taken off his coat.
"What do you see now?" I
asked.
"Water," replied SAMPSON.
"Good! Anything else?"
"No—yes—It 's a thing with a
fut body and a—a mouth and a tail."
"That 's a porpoise," 1 said.
"Hard-a-port."
"Now there 's a long thing with
any number of legs."
"Southend pier," I said. "Wo
shall be in choppy water in a
minute."
"Don't," cried SYMPSON. "Now
there 's a—ugh •"
"A ground swell," explained JOR-
KINS.
And SYMPSON, who is a martyr to
mal-de-mer, went below.
"JORKINS! Up in the conning-
tower," I gave the order.
"Ay, ay, skipper," cried JORKINS,
who was now covered with grease
and perspiration.
"Light on the port bow," he sud-
denly called out.
What does she look like?"
"A rakish-looking craft with a
big hoad find ninety-seven legs."
"Margate jetty," I said. "Run
her close in and reconnoitre."
Suddenly we ran aground.
"Full speed aster-r-rn," I shouted,
and I rushed to the steering-gear.
Our drop of water had evaporated.
THE END.
A Simple Arithmetical Problem.
Mr. TILAK, the Indian Nationalist
leader who published seditious arti-
cles in his newspaper Kcsari, made
an address to the jury lasting six
days. lie was fined i'06, and sen-
tenced to six years' transportation.
Even an innocent man might have
received that sentence in the cir-
cumstances.
So near and yet so far.

Wolffe will to-morrow make another attempt
to swim across the Channel."—Daily Mail.
Unhappily even this encouragement
did not bring him success. But it
was a nice thought, all the same.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
PROVERBIAL NEGLECT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I have a real
grievance. It occurred to me last
Sunday week, and I have been try-
ing to write about it ever since,
but Well, the fact is they have
been putting rape in my seed-pot
lately and I simply have no time for
anything. To-day they
are late in feeding me—
so here goes.
I had just been un-
covered and had hopped
from the ring, where I
sleep, down to the perch,
where I live. Before
springing on to my seed-
pot I glanced out of the
dining-room window. A
robin was looking for his
breakfast in the laurus-
tinus. "Poor thing!"
I said, and cracked
ninety-three rape seeds;
then, "Fancy having to
turn out on a rotten
morning like this." Next
I started on the water-
cress. Simultaneously
the robin discovered a
long worm. "Heavens!"
I cried. "This must be
The Early Bird." Full
of excitement I rushed
to the edge of the cage
to catch another glimpse.
But the robin had retired
with his petit dejeuner.
The world seemed very
empty, and I remained
quite still for several
seconds — thinking —
thinking. At the end of
that time I found I had
a grievance. So have all
the other canaries, if
they only knew it.
Dear Mr. Punch, why
don't they put us into
proverbs ? There are thou-
sands and thousands of
canaries (besides linnets
and bullfinches and other
cage-birds) in these
islands alone—and not
one proverb among the
lot of us. Not one. Look how many
the other birds have—the bird
in the bush—the bird that wouldn't
be caught with chaff, and lots of
others. Even a wretched stray cat is
better off than we are. And as for
dogs, bears and tortoises—why, I am
perfectly sick of hearing about them.
Of course, you say you don't want
any more proverbs. Don't you,
though? Things are always happen-
ing that the proverb-makers never
thought of. Supposing you just miss
a railway accident through staying
for an extra glass of gingerade?
Neither '' Taking a horse to the
water," nor "A stitch in time"
quite fits the case, does it? So that
you see you do want one or two
more—really good ones.
It'« no good leaving the cage door

A DIFFICULT CHOICE.
A green canary should not bathe.
That is another one. I don't know'
exactly when you ought to say it, but
if your canary is green, that helps the
point.
Paint its cage yellow and your
canary will disappear. This suggests
a scientific problem that should keep
canary-owners awake for many a
night and incidentally
benefit the colour-artist.
The hand that gives
the groundsel gets the
song. This should cover
a bare patch or two in
life's daily round, though
I am afraid it is a bit
like "Virtue is its own
Reward." Still most
people would rather talk
about canaries than
virtue. Always cater for
the masses.
A blind canary u-ill eat
lead shot. Do not take
a blind canary to the
theatre. Both of these
may be funny, but not,
in my poor opinion, in
very good taste.
In conclusion I should
like to tell you of one I
thought of in my bath
yesterday. It is short,
yet so full of meaning.
It seems to bring before
us, in a few simple
words, all those grand
mysteries of Life and
Death. It runs as fol-
lows:—A stuffed canary
does not sing.
What do you think of
that?
Dear Mr. Punch, I
should feel very grateful
if you would publish
this letter. People ought
to know what a lot of
good - wearing proverbs
\vo could supply them.
I am, yours truly,

P.S.—There are heaps

open after the canary is dead. I
thought of that the other morning.
It sounds nice, and might come in
well when a cheque is returned dis-
honoured.
A canary that is not fed to-day
To-morrow will have flown away.
That is poetry. A mistress might use it
now and then during spring cleaning
to urge on an unwilling maid. Or
the maid herself might quote it when
giving notice.
Referring to the new war balloon,
"Dirigible No. 2.," The Evening
News says:
"It creates on the mind of the spectator the
impression of a colossal Germau sausage."
We have heard of " footprints on the
sands of time," but this seems to be
quite a new impression, and we
tremble to think of the mental state
of London after the new balloon has
made a trial trip over the metropolis.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerics.)
Love's Shadow (GRANT RICHARDS), by ADA LEVERSON,
is a most refreshing sketch, and I only wish that a few
more woman-writers had her joyous sense of humour.
The story is not much in itself, and its construction is
rather desultory; the author, indeed, seems to have
written a new chapter just whenever a fresh idea came
into her charming head. But her dialogue is a pure
delight. Of the heroine, who describes herself as a
"bachelor girl," we are told that she had not enough
of the Bohemian quality to warrant that description;
"she was too plastic, too finished." I am sure Mrs.
LEVKUSON has no more notion what this contradictory
sentence means than I have: but I easily forgive her
for the sake of the courage which she shows in letting
the girl make her own running along the course of true
love. The fun that is made out of Bruce Otllcy, of the
Foreign Office, is perhaps a little exaggerated and cer-
tainly tends to grow discursive. But his patient wife,
who sees through
his foibles but for-
bears to take advan-
tage of her insight,
is a noble example
of restrained humour
on the part both of
the lady and her
creator. By the
way, how is it that
Lord Sclscy, who
cuts out Cecil
Reeve, his nephew
and heir, in the
affections of the
widow Eugenia, is
only twenty years
older than that
nephew'? Cecil's
father (Lord Seise i/'s
younger brother)
must have married
at a very precocious age.
But this is mere captiousness. Mrs LEVERSON's
book marks a great advance upon her previous work,
and I hope she will not miss the appreciation which she
has thoroughly earned.
When young Nevile Arnott fell in love with Pauline
(CONSTABLE), a lady with a past, there was a good deal
of fluttering in the Arnott dovecote, and the wise
mother-bird promptly winged her way to Switzerland,
there to talk to the siren, as woman to woman.
Pauline's husband was a bad lot, and she had divorced
him. Also she was an actress, and some years older
than Nevile, who was engaged to a nice little bread-and-
butter miss at home. Mrs. Arnott put it to Pauline
that for all these reasons she was no fit mate for the
pride of the Arnotts, and Pauline, far from contradicting
her, offered to make her young lover believe that she
really was as black as she had been painted.
The conventional youth (Eton and Oxford) obediently
and blindly walked into the trap. He returned
to his Evangelinc, won a by-election for the
Unionists, compared with which Pudsey was a
moral victory for the Liberal Party, and was on the
point of settling down as a prosy married M.P.—when,
one unlucky day, he went to see Pauline in a French
play. He guessed from her performance that she had
sacrificed herself to save him and please mamma; had
his head cracked with a decanter, of all vufgar weapons,
by an admirer of the lady; was jilted by Evangelinc,
and, after all, accepted by his other love, only to learn
that she had received her death-sentence from the
doctors. As a rule I enjoy the novels of Mr. W. E.
NORRIS, but this one I find a trifle heavy, in spite of
the comic interludes of a terrible old lady with an ear-
trumpet who had an inconvenient habit of thinking
aloud. There is good work in Pauline, but as a whole
it seems to me to fall a little short of the high standard
which we generally expect from Mr. NORRIS.

The Foal. "OH, MA, is THAT OEE DOING FOR A RIDE is A MOTOR?"
Mr. Louis J. VANCE'S story, The Black Bag (GRANT
RICHARDS), begins, as all good romances should, in a
London hotel; but it is not long before the villain is
sneaking out by a back door to avoid the police, and the
hero and heroine are driving to Bloomsbury in a hansom.
On page 60 they two are, with the exception of the body
of an unknown man, alone in an empty house; and if
there is one thing
more romantic than
a London hotel and a
hansom cab it is an
empty house. But
Philip's happiness,
for he is by this
time in love with
Dorothy, is short-
lived, for by page
107 the boat was—
this is official —
gathering impetus
as it momentarily
diminished in the
night's illusory per-
spective; the boat,
that is, which was
Coflveying the villain
and the girl aboard
the brigantine.
Philip was at the
wharf to see them off, riot being aware that the
other man really was the villain; and Dorothy went
quite willingly, under the mistaken impression that
he was her father. However, Philip finds out his
error and gives chase. Up till now he has not
even tapped his hip-pocket significantly, far less shot
anybody; but at Antwerp he boards the brigantine,
collects all the revolvers (I am never happy until the
hero has all the revolvers) and makes off with the
Black Bag and Dorothy. It is then the villain's turn to
give chase—his effort is even more exciting. Mr. VANCE
knows exactly how to do this sort of story, and I recom-
mend him enthusiastically to all who are not familiar
with his methods. I forgive him for making his hero
American, seeing that the latter talks English and has
his adventures in Europe. If Philip had got the bulge
on a club-footed snipe in Fifth Avenue, it would have
been another matter.

momentarily hidden by the shreds and patches that percolated the rind
of secrecy that those who were striving to run the Triangular Tests

The Grand Vizier, FERID PASHA,
who quite recently received from the

right in putting on mourning.
In reply to a grateful telegram from

The Under-Secretary for the
Home Office, speaking on the Old
Age Pensions Bill, apologised for the
fact that the age-limit was at present
as high as 70. "You must remem-
ber," he said, "that the Bill imposes
no small charge upon the resources
of the nation.'' There was never any
fear of our not remembering this fact.
***
Meanwhile the Bill has given
a distinct fillip to the Manhood
Suffrage agitation, for it is obviously
only fair that those persons who are
to receive pensions should be in a
position to give effect to their views
as to the amount of the same and
the period at which they are to be-
come payable.
As several articles entitled "The
Ideal Public House " have appeared
on the subject of Lord LAMINGTON'S
Bill, we are requested to state, in
order to prevent false hopes from
being raised, that the Bill does not
propose to make it compulsory for
every publican to supply customers
with free drinks.

THE MAN THAT STOLE THE DIAMONDS.
[To Mr. RUPERT GUINNESS, Commander of the London Division Naval
Volunteer Reserve (H.M.S. Buzzard, moored off the approach to
Mr. Punch's Offices). Mr. CJuixxESS is reported to have been the
object of a hitter attack ou the part of Mr. HKRBKRT BURROWS, in the
course of the hitter's appeal to the Socialist Electors of Haggerston.]
RUPERT, I 'm told you 've never done
A decent day's work 'neath the sun,
Never perspired in any one
Of life's laborious furrows;
But I am certain (see Who 's Wlio ?)
This allegation isn't true
Which (they allege) was flung at you
By Mr. BERTIE BURROWS.
That bulwark of the public weal
Says " Man must work, or beg, or steal,
To earn the matter for a meal
To stuff his Little Mary at;'"
And, since you always shirked a job
And shunned to beg the casual bob,
One course remained, says he,—to rob
A toiling proletariat.
Yet I have read that, long before
Your Buzzard flanked flie Temple shore
And you became the Commodore
Of civil tars that manned her,
YOU figured in the Eton eight,
And helped to lift the Ladies' Plate,
And twice secured, al: welter weight,
The Diamonds for Leander.
From time to time, when I observe
Your waistcoat's more than ample curve,
I 've thought what courage, what a nerve
Hanc agitavit mole HI;
And now I hear our HERBERT swear
You never turned an honest hair,
Or won the Diamonds on the square,
But simply went and stole 'em.
Bear up, my KTPERT; never mind,
Though men like HKRB are gravel-blind
To labour of the larger kind,
Tho work that 's not for wages;
Your efforts on the L.C.C.,
Nobly performed without a fee,
Shall stimulate our heirs and be
The envy of the ages. 0. S.
OUR SUMMER NUMBER STORY.
AT the base of the cliff he sat sketching. Behind him
the granite wall rose forbiddingly—up, up, and again
up, and yet up again. The tide swirled ominously round
the rocks—like a tiger licking his lips before his lunch.
Yet ho noticed it not, for a vision of ethereal beauty
had swum before his ken. He knew her at once for the
Summer Number Girl, for she had liquid violet eyes,
and she wore, no shoes, stockings, sleeves, or neckwear.
However, a Directoire hat made up for these deficiencies.
A pink freckle on her lissom neck set his veins dancing
with liquid fire. Where the sun had kissed why should
not. he?
A tiny scream—instinct with graceful abandon— rent
the air. She had slipped on the rocks! To his dying
day he will remember that sickening scrunch as she sat
down suddenly on a colony of periwinkles.
She was thirty yards away, but in a single bound he
was by her side. She had fainted—her ankle had given
way. A horrible indecision made a moment waver out
into an eternity before his eyes. Ought he to chafe her
ankle or her wrist? In the end he decided that the
latter would be more genteel.
Her eyelids opened like two April flow'rets, revealing
eyes of liquid violet, then closed modestly like two timid
oysters. "Thank you," she murmured, and the uncon-
ventional camaraderie of her words sent a thrill of exalta-
tion to his brain.
"Not at all!" he replied with almost passionate
intensity.
"I must have slipped," murmured the Vision. Even
in his intoxicating rapture he could not help noticing that
she never " said " but merely " murmured."
"Not at all!" he repeated; then he could have bitten
his tongue off at the audacity of the remark. Suppose
she were to resent it?
But his indiscretion was quickly banished from
thought.
"Tho tide!" she panted. "It's rising! We're
cutoff!"
It was so. The tide was swirling menacingly around
them. One wanton wavelet touched her toe. She
blushed and drew it under her skirts.
In an instant he had slipped off his scarlet cummer-
bund, tied it into a lasso, and cast it up at the merciless
granite wall behind them. Twenty feet above a tiny
projection glinted in the sunlight. The noose caught—
held—tightened. To clasp her in both arms and to
swarm up the cummerbund with the other was the work
of a moment.
They were on a ledge some two inches wide, looking
out wild-eyed upon a waste of waters. On the far
horizon a tramp steamer flirted a puff of smoke mock-
ingly towards them. And still the tide rose. . . .
Again he cast up his cummerbund another thirty feet,
and drew her into temporary safety in a crack of the
cliff that just afforded a hold for one' foot. And still the
tide rose. . . .
"It looks jolly awkward," he breathed, feeling that
he was voicing an eternal truth.
"Yes, isn't it'.'" she murmured; and her words
seemed to him an ample reward for a'ons of purgatory.
Fifty feet above them a single root of samphire tan-
talised him with its offer of safety. Alone, he might
have leapt and caught it, but with her in his arms lu-
felt that the risk was unthinkable.
They must perisit together unless . . . unless . . .
An avenue of safety suddenly flashed upon his miu'l!
It was horribly prosaic, but for her sake he felt that no
sacrifice could be too great. It must be done.
"Why not take the lift up the cliff'.'" he whispered
hoarsely.
"It will cost us twopence," she murmured; "and
I 've lost my purse."
"May I pay for you . . . always'.'" He was gazing
passionately into the depths of her liquid violet eyes.
They loomed up before him like the coloured bottles in
a chemist's window.
She lowered her eyelids, down, down, down. They
reminded him of the blinds closing down o'er the
chemist's shop. Then she trembled deliciously.
He^huug on her words in an agony of apprehension.
"You will be my hero . . . always," she murmured.
"Then I can never be your husband?" he demanded
fiercely.
"No! " she answered sadly, "not if you and I are to
keep our pride of place in the Summer Numbers!"

A WANDERER IN WALES.
CROSSING o'er the English borders
By my worthy doctor's orders,
Well equipped with home-spun rai-
ment,
Gold, to make immediate payment—-
Fully armed likewise with divers
Weapons—fishing rods and drivers,
Niblick, putter, clock and baffy;
Thus I went to call on Taffy.
Disappointments not a few
Lent my trip a sombre hue.
For I never saw COKELLI
At Llandudno or Pwllheli;
Did not see SHAW take a header
In the sight of all Llanbedr;
Did not run against MACKINNON
WOOD, M.P., by Ll.yn or Ffynnon;
Did not meet with DONALD TOVEY
On the links of Aberdovey;
Failed to recognise Count HAYNAU
In the environs of Blaenau;
Or encounter Baron WRANGKL
In the streets of Llanfihangel;
Did not pluck the wild persimmon
On the summit of Plynlimmon;
Did not hear the voice of " MABON"
On the platform of Ruabon;
Never saw, worst blow of all,
RAVEN-HILL at Raven Fall.
Subject to these reservations
Wales, throughout my divagations,
Answered all my expectations.
Ordered specially to " slack it,"
And avoid all needless racket,
Soon I found that Cambria's railways
Were tho very best of snailways.
Further, that this land of quiet
Harmonised with varied diet.
Thus I sampled fair Portmadoc's
Admirable shrimps and haddocks,
And appeased a mighty twist with
Mutton pies at Aberystwith;
Lunched off lamb and peas and
lettuce
At the hostelry of Bettws;
Mingled ham and eggs and shandy-
Gaff beside tho Mill of Pandy;
And partook of beer and trifle
On the cairn that crowns Yr Eifl.
For the rest my Welsh impressions
Justified my prepossessions.
Though the trippers' ways at Bar-
mouth
Much reminded me of Yarmouth,
Vocalists I heard at Bala
Worthy of Milan's La Scala.
Though tho Merioneth "Terrier"
Should be more to make us merrier,
Still tho walls of Harlech stand
Frowning over mead and strand;
Still the ancient songs that stirred
Heroes to the fight are heard;
Still the old enchantment clings
To the ruined halls of kings;
Still ami'l her hills and vales
Throbs the unconquered heart of
Wales.
The Church Times begins an
article upon "Church Finance"
boldly thus:
"This is a largo problem. This is a difficult
problem. But it is a problem the consideration
of which can be deferred no longer. At every
turn it presents itself, and then the temptation
is to talk platitudes, to wish vaguely for reform
while implying that reform must wait for the
millennium, and so to pass on hastily to another
subject."
Unfortunately it ends (on the third
column) in this way:
"We have no space left wherein even to
indicate remedies. Possibly we may find an
occasion of returning to the subject."

THE HOLIDAY GUIDE.
"WHERE are you going for your
holidays?" asked BEATRICE, who
always wants to know more than is
good for a sister-in-law.
"I don't know," I said sleepily.
"Isn't it nearly tinle you began to
think about ft?"
"My dear, I 'vo been thinking
about it for weeks. Don't be cross
with me."
"You haven't even decided when
you 're going, have you?"
"Oh, yes, I have."
"When?"
"As soon as I've decided ivltcrc
I 'm going. ... Is that for me or
for Baby'.' If it's for me, it's too
small."
BEATRICE stitched in silence for a
little while. Then she -
put down her work and
began to talk seriously.
"Why don't you go
abroad?"
"I can't go alone," I
said; " I should probably
get stolen. You wouldn't
like it a bit if the post-
man turned up one morn-
ing with an ear of mine
in a little box, and you
were asked for ten thou-
sand pounds for the rest
of me, ond twopence
anyhow for the over-
weight."
"Don't be absurd."
"I '11 go if you'll let
mo have JOHN. You
know, I always think
they 'd eat JOHK first.
He is fatter than I am.
1 should point that out."
"I 'm afraid you can't have JOHN."
"Oh, if you 're going to be selfish
about it"
"XVhat county did you think of,
if you stay in England'.'"
"I don't know. I like all the
counties. This is so sudden."
"Why not Cornwall?"
"Yes, why not Cornwall? Only
. . . Well, what I feel is that if
I go to Cornwall I am sort of casting
a slur upon all the other counties.

that would have made rather a good

"MARY says Northamptonshire is
lovely."
"Now that really is nice of MARY,"
I said enthusiastically. "Northamp-
tonshire has it. I shall qualify for
the county. Hang Cornwall."

citedly.
"Yes. I leave it to you and
MARY to find me a nice place there."
"I '11 write to MARY to-night."
She got up and moved towards the
house. "I suppose you don't want
to be too near a town?"
"Not too near. But so long as
it's quite close to the sea, I don't
really mind. I want," I went on
dreamily, "to lie on the top of a
cliff and smoke, and listen to the
waves, and watch the rabbits play-
ing on the sands below. I want"

suddenly.
"I should like to shake you,"

"Wh.-it's the matter?"
"Northamptonshire isn't near the

That looks a jolly little place."
"Osmington," began BEATRICE,

"If you really want the sea and
will be sensible, perhaps I might
make a suggestion."
"I wish you would. Then I'll
tell you what I don't like about it."
"All right. Wait a minute." She
disappeared into the house, and came
out again with something in her
hand. Drawing her deck chair next
to mine she spread a map out on
her knees.
"A map," I cried, sitting up
quickly. "How, lovely. Oh, look,
there 's the sea. W7hat county is
this?"
"Dorset."
"Cheers for Dorset. Is the sea
really as blue as that?"
"Bluer. Much bluer."

piciously. "Have you got shares in

with 'The Landlord' written just

map being spoilt," said
BEATRICE. "Not a bit."
"Then will you do it

what to eay to land-
lords."
BEATRICE folded up the
map and looked at mo.
"You're simply too"
"It 'B you who wonted

tested. "I was quite
willing to go on thinking.
Now von 're trying to

"That's it exactly," 1
said in admiration.

"Well? " said BEATRICE, nibbling
her pencil.
"First, a big breakfast."
"'The food must be ample,'1
said BEATRICE to herself.
"Is 'ample' strong enough?" I
asked doubtfully.
"Quite."
"Well, you might add 'particu-

it will turn out to be the name of a

teach them trades, show them what fools they

[AUGUST 5, 1908.
THE THORN IN THE BUSH.
(,4 Complaint from the Exhibition.)
OH city of the dazzling domes,
And pleasances by genies planted,
Wherein the happy tourist roams
And ought by rights to feel
enchanted;
I 've done my best
To feel that zest
Your gushing little guide-book takes
for granted.
I know where every trade is wooed,
Where every cloistered walk or
glen is;
I 've hung upon a bridge and viewed
(While counting my remaining
pennies)
Electric boats
Pop out like stoats,
And murmured, '' This is fairyland
(or Venice)."
In vain! it was no earthly use.
It seems the half-inspired creators,
Whose airy intellects produce
These palaces and hire the waiters,
Have no regard
For me the bard
Who cannot stand a tumult of spec-
tators.
Just as I seemed to have it hot
(That glamour that the scribes
reported),
Some visitor defaced the spot
Where only Fancy should have
sported,
The fine effect
Was simply wrecked
By amatory pairs who crooned and
courted.
But take away the selfish mob,
Remove the mere erotic sillies,
And I 'd have gladly paid a bob
For porticoes like earven lilies;
So rare a shade
They might have made
For me to wander in alone with
PHYLLIS!
SEASIDE RHAPSODIES.
(To suit all tastes.)
Northgate.—Brilliant sunshine to-
day in the morning; the Mayor's
"At Home " in the afternoon. Sea
somewhat choppy in parts, but
smooth places still obtainable. Penny-
in-the-slot machines are being well
patronised by visitors. Curiously
enough, wretched weather is being
experienced at Westbourne.
\Vcstbourne.—Sunshades are being
used here to keep off the sun.
Thousands of visitors watching the
tide come in. Performance twice
daily. Northgate seems to be unfor-
tunate in its weather just now. It
never rains there, they say—but it
pours!
Teymouth. — Glorious sunshine,
cool breezes, and a sea like glass.
Beach black with babies. Heavy
excursions expected to - day from
Northgate and Westbourne, where
the weather seems to have broken
up for good.
Eastsea.—Delightful weather con-
ditions as always. Sun, 4.30 A.M. to
7.30 P.M. (Free). Band of the Boys'
Brigade in the Terrace Gardens (6d.).
The influenza victims who arrived
yesterday from Northgate, West-
bourne and Teymouth are rapidly
recovering.
Highstairs.—24 hours' bright sun-
shine. Rainfall nil. Cool breezes
from all quarters. Sea to suit cus-
tomers. Daily Mail on breakfast-
table, 5.30. The fund inaugurated
by The Highstairs Independent for
the sufferers at Northgate, West-
bourne, Teymouth and Eastsea now
totals several pounds. Umbrellas
and mackintoshes are still required
for their relief, and will be acknow-
ledged in the columns of The Inde-
pendent.
THE ADVERTISEMENT;
OK, A SCHOOL FOB LIARS.
"How to let the cottage for
August?" I said. "Why, adver-
tise, to be sure."
"What a good idea!" said
ELEANOR. "How clever you are,
uncle!"
"I could have told you that,"
said HUMPHRY.
"Yes," said ELEANOR, "but you
didn't. Cleverness consists chiefly
in saying the right thing at the right
time, doesn't it, uncle?"
"Certainly," I replied.
"A stupid man," ELEANOR went
on, rather incautiously, I thought,
"who says the right thing at the
right time is cleverer than a witty
man who keeps silent."
"The case exactly," said HUMPHRY.
ELEANOR, who never sees irony,
beamed upon her husband.
"Let us draw up the advertise-
ment," I said hastily. "How many
rooms?"
"Let 's see," said ELEANOR.
"Four bedrooms, counting the attic,
one sitting-room, one kitchen, larder,
wood - shed, bicycle - house. How
many is that?"
"Strictly speaking," said HUM-
PHRY, "it is six and an attic."
"It would never do to say that,"
I said.
"Must one give the exact num-
ber? " ELEANOR asked.
"Certainly not," said HUMPHRY—
"not in a clever advertisement. It
was for such difficulties that the
word ' roomy ' was invented."
"Or ' commodious,' " I added.
"Yes, or commodious," he agreed.
"The advertisement should begin:
To let, for the month of August,
roomy cottage '—and so on."
"Do you think it quite fair to call
it roomy?" ELEANOR asked. "You
know how we hit our heads some-
times."
"Isn't it 'roomy'?" HUMPHRY
asked.
"I don't know," ELEANOR ad-
mitted. "It depends on what you
mean by ' roomy.''
"If," said HUMPHRY, " by ' rainy'
you mean appertaining to rain, by
'roomy' you mean appertaining to
a room. A house possessing only-
one room thus becomes ' roomy.' It
is an excellent word."
"Oh, HUMPHRY," said ELEANOR,
quite convinced, "how clever you
are!"
"Very good so far," said I
quickly. "Now, how do we go on?
Isn't it a drawback to have no bath-
room ?''
"Couldn't we just say 'bath '?"
asked ELEANOR, who was very rapidly
descending to the low moral level of
the house-agent. "Something like
this: 'Eoomy cottage, with all need-
ful offices, bicycle - house, bath,
etc.'?"
"Well," said HUMPHRY, "I'm—•
blowed. And you have been calling
uncle and me clever. We 're not in it."
ELEANOR shone with joy.
"In this advertisement here," I
said, reading from a paper, "they
mention cricket and golf."
"That 's all right," said HUMPHRY.
"We can add 'Cricket and golf.'
What 's to prevent us?"
"Only that there isn't any," said
ELEANOR.
"There 's cricket in the village on
Saturday afternoons," said HUM-
PHRY. "Why not mention it? And
one could putt on the lawn if one
wanted to. I think as a matter of
fact that the words ' cricket and golf'
ought to be added to all advertise-
ments just as a symmetrical ending.'
"Very well," said ELEANOR. " But
could we say 'good fishing,' too ?''
"No," said I, "you couldn't.
You will get into enough trouble as
it is. How far are you from the
station?"
"Two miles and a quarter," said
HUMPHRY.
"A very bad distance," I said.

"One should never be over two

"Why say the distance?" HUM-
PHRY asked. "Why not say merely
'within easy distance of station '?"
"Because you 're not," I replied.
"But two miles and a quarter
would be quite easy in a motor-car,"
ELEANOR said. "You merely say
'easy distance,' and every one lias a

"Splendid 1 " said HUMPHRY.
"Jesuit!" said I.
"Then it now reads," said HUM-
PHRY, "' To let, for the month of

all needful offices, bicycle-shed, bath,
etc. Golf, cricket. Within easy
distance of station.' I don't think
that 's quite enough."
"Here 's one here," I said, read-
ing again from the paper, "that
says 'Fruit and vegetables.''
"Oh yes," ELEANOR cried, " that 's
very attractive. Of course, let them
have the fruit and vegetables."
"There won't be any," said HUM-
PHRY. "There 's nothing but parsley
and herbs and apples. The apples
aren't ripe till October."
"But some people," said ELEANOR,
"like green apples. Don't you remem-
ber how Mr. THISTLETHWAITE did?
And parsley is a vegetable, isn't it?"
"Quite * right," said HUMPHRY.
"' Fruit and vegetables.'"
"Is that all? " I asked with some
sarcasm.
"Look and sec," said HUMPHRY.
"Well, here's one," I said,
'' that mentions a garage."
"The bioyelcrhouse !" cried ELEA-
NOR.
"No," said HUMPHRY. "I think
that would bo deception. Every-
thing else has been all fair and
square; but to call the bicycle-shed
a garage is a little bit too strong.
No, uncb, you must not tempt us.
No garage."
"Tempt you!" I replied. "I
like thatt"
"Well, uncle, we should not have
thought of it but for you," said
ELEANOR, who is as fickle as April.
"It was tempting, in a way, wasn't
it?"
"Very well," said I, laying down
the paper, "I hare done with it. I
wash my hands of the whole affair."
"But what about the rent?''
HUMPHRY cried. "We must fix that."
'Kent moderate,' " I said .shortly.
I was tired of it.
"Oh, uncle," ELEANOR exclaimed.
"Why moderate? How can we get
to Holland on it it it 's only
moderate'.' ''
"Well, we must say moderate,
anyway," said HUMPHRY. "Once
they have nibbled we can fix the
amount. They won't nibble at all
if we don't say moderate. That 's
the point, as uncle says."
"I said nothing of the kind," I
replied hotly. "What I said was
I was tired of the whole d
whole thing."
"Oh, uncle," said ELEANOR, " don't
be unkind. You are so useful. We
could do nothing without you."
Hereupon ELEANOR sat down and
copied out the advertisement just as
it had been compiled, save for the
mention of a garage, and it went oft
to the papers that very night.
Jolly for the poor beggars that bite.
Sure to have a large family. But
what awful liars of nephews and
nieces an uncle can have!

THE USE OF THE WHISTLE.
Tnu dance over, I placed myself
delicately in a taxicab and ordered
the fellow to drive me to my eligible
residence. Upon arrival I alighted
(as who would not have done?), and
as I paid the fare to the taxicabman
I could not helf noticing that a dis-
cussion was pending between us. As
I always come off worst in discus-
sions, whatever the topic, 1 stepped
up to my front-door with alacrity
and admitted myself cordially and
without hesitation into my front hall.
I loft the cabman deliberately wind-
ing his engine, as one that desired
to give a man every chance of relent-
ing and returning to increase the
bonus.
Just inside the hall I met a man
svhom, upon cross-examination, I
liscovered to be a burglar. In his
professional enthusiasm he had
sbandoncd his weapons of defence,
md I noticed with horror that he
<x> seemed to bo gathering himself
wgether for a discussion—moral,
>robably, and socialistic. So I re-
sorted to a subterfuge. "After all,"
I said, "the legal element in the
matter JE not altogether negligible.
Let us procure an Expert." There-
upon, retreating to the doorstep, I
blew once, and, reminding myself
with pleasure of the report of the
Police Commission, I blew again
upon that whistle, without which no
householder (be he casuist or not)
is complete. "Let us have three
Experts," 1 said, and blew once
again.
There was a short, sharp silence.
The Dialectician of the Doormat re-
garded me curiously from his side of
the lintel. I maintained my posi-
tion on the step, mute of malice
and trusting that my experts would
not tarry in their coming. I felt
now less inclined than ever to carry
through single-handed an argument
which showed every sign of being a
violent one. At moments like these
one's senses are alive to the smaller
details. My eye feasted itself upon
the burglar's neckwear, and dis-
covered in his scarf a shade of green
hitherto unsuspected. My nose de-
tected, sensible through a widely-
distributed atmosphere of alcohol, the
aroma of my own whisky, and lastly
my ear listened attentively to the
sound of a rapidly approaching motor.
With a feeling that warmed the
cockles of my heart and loosened the
stiffness of my facial muscles, I heard
the car pull up at my doorstep.
Much as I have always admired the
Police, I hardly expected them to
come to my assistance in an electric
brougham. I turned round to greet
them, and the burglar, not to be
outdone in politeness and the better
to watch the proceedings, stepped
past me on to the pavement.
It was no electric brougham that
met our anxious gaze. It was not
even a private automobile. It was
merely an empty taxicab. It was,
in fact, the taxicab. "Thank you,"
said the burglar, with genuine grati-
tude, "thank you a thousand times
for this most generous thought";
und to the taxicabman, as he packed
himself and his congested bag into
the loathsome machine, "Whito-
chapel, please, WILLIAM."
Thus the two controversialists
passed out of my life.

SUCCESSFUL CORYPHEES OF THE SEASON.
SlGXOEItiE LULU, ASCUITTA, ASD AOOSTUTA BlBHELLI COME FORWARD WITH SOME CONFIDENCE AT THE FAU. OF THE CCBTAIS.
House of Lords, Monday, 27f/i
July.—" The Government come to
the House of Lords and thrust Bills
down your Lordships' throats one
after another."
Thus CAMPERDOWN, on proposal to
take second reading of Irish Uni-
versities Bill. Phrase a little am-
biguous. Striving to realize the
picture suggested, one is not sure
whether it is the Bills that, one after
another, are thrust down throat of
noble Lords, or whether,' one after
another, noble Lords are taken in
hand and have Bills administered to
them.
A small matter; does not affect
forcefulness of the fancy. The case
is certainly hard. Month after
month the Lords have had no
work to do. Now Ministers plump
down upon them measures by the
bushel. They will be required to
crowd into this single week their
consideration of multiform labours
which the Commons have spread
ever months. By way of aggravation,
the important Bill set down for
second reading to-day has not been
circutated. Peers are invited to pass
a critical stage of a Bill they have
never seen, whose provisions are a
matter of hearsay.
True, it has been before the other
House and the country for months.
Newspapers full of reports of debates
in Commons, with leading articles
thereupon. By going into Commons'
Lobby any Peer might obtain copy
of the Bill at the Vote office. That
a low utilitarian way of looking at
things. In accordance with ancient
tradition and etiquette, the Lords
know nothing of any legislative pro-
posal until it has been presented to
notice through their own channels.
In theory they knew no more about
the much-debated Bill than if discus-
sion actually carried on across the
way had gone forward in Saturn.
These matters must be understood
before full realisation of the enormity
of the Government's fresh attempt
can flood the shocked mind. With
a Liberal Government in office,
CAMPEUDOWN'S life is full of anxiety.
Has arrogated to himself the char-
acter and position of watchdog at
the door, on the look-out for fresh
attacks by an iniquitous Government
on a blameless Assembly. Small
wonder if in excitement following
on discovery of fresh outrage there
is something ambiguous in his
bark.

sion.
Tuesday. — HALSBURY in what he
would describe as "a sort of"
hole. Eleven years ago, when he
sat on Woolsack, the Government
of which he was chief ornament
brought in un Education Bill.
Loyally impressed with largeness of
majority by which it was carried
through other House, majority in the
Lords decided to adopt it without
amendment. A small but raucous
Opposition submitted certain amend-
ments. These touched money mat-
ters exclusively in the purview of
the Commons. To meddle with
them was to assail the ancient privi-
lege of that House.
Thus Lord Chancellor HALSBURY
ruled, in statesman-like speech that
broke, down the Opposition and car-
ried the Bill intact.
Unfortunately his speech was re-
ported. Is found to-day in unim-
peachable pages of Hansard. Another
Party is in Power. Another Money
Bill rea-jhes the Lords. Amend-
ments are moved from Front Oppo-
sition Bench of character kindred to
those denounced from Woolsack
when, in 1807, PIIINCI: ARTHUR'S
Education Bill came up from the
Commons.
Of course, wily Ministers to-day
quote HALSBURY'H judgment, extoll-
ing its lotty view, its unassailable
constitutional principles.
What is to bo done'.' Should the
ex-LoRD CHANCELLOR stay away, kept
to his roo7a by sudden indisposition?
or should ho boldly show up, declare
that what ho had said he had said,
and that neither wild horses nor
motor-cars should drag him off the
lofty plane of constitutional law he
mounted at an earlier time in other
circumstance's?
HALSBUHY did neither. Ignoring
references to his historic dictum, he
declared it "time for the House of
Lords to assert their rights, and to
show whom it might concern that
there is in the land one institution
that will insist upon the privilege of
free discussion uncontrolled by the
Ministry of the day."
Burst of applause followed.
Amendments similar to those form-
ally denounced by LORD CHANCELLOR
as affecting privileges of Commons

THE WOOIN' O'T.
the true history of a romance which
has just been enacted at a \VorJ;hou«e in
Buckinghnmshire.)
PAUPER JIM was a gay old soul;
Sixty summers had bared his poll;
Sixty winters had snowed on him,
And bent his back and bowed each
limb;
But his heart was gay
As the month of May
And light as the pocket of PAUPER
JIM.
Clo.se to the "House" and across
the road
Stood a neat little, sweet little, trim
abode,
Comfy, cosy,
Green and rosy,
Owned by a widow who sat and
sowed.
Greon were the leeks iu that garden
fair,
Green the cabbages blooming there;
And JIM had been given to under-
stand
That this nice little lot was on free-
hold land.
Once and twice and thrice a day
The wandering orbs of JIM would
stray
To that ultra-respectable
Highly delectable
Haven of refuge across the way-
Onae and twice and thrice, maybe,
Those wandering orbs would srnile to
see
Somebody sitting there,
Possibly knitting there,
Possibly sipping a cup of tea.
Whenever this spectacle caught his
eye
JIM THE PAUPER was heard to sigh;
For he loved that elderly widow and
He did not object to the freehold
land.
Now and then his heart stood still,
And down his marrow there passed a
thrill,
As he fancied he caught an answering
sigh
And the " Come hither " look in the
widow's eye.
JIM'S white locks began to curl;
He warbled a song to his grey-haired
girl.
But who—oh, who rould hope to woo
In a pauper's jacket and trousers, too'.'
Show mo the swain could achieve
success
Clad in a hideous workhoiise dress I
JIM knows well that the female heart
Loves not a little tho tailor's art,
So he takes his courage in both hi
hands
And before the Guardians, lo, he
stands.
Swiftly the case is explained by JIM:
The widow has certainly smiled on
him,
But though she favours his suit she
loathes
(As what woman wouldn't?) his
pauper clothes.
Could the Board but see their way
To purchase a courting-suit for J.,
It was but a trifle they had to spend,
And the rates would certainly gain in
the end.
So urged the swain, and not in vain:
The Guardians saw that his case w-as
plain,
And resolved nem. con. that JIM bo
dressed
In a blue satin tie and a fancy vest,
Black coat, brown shoes, and a pair
of spats
And the dernier cri in billycock hats.
What need of more? What pen is
equal
To telling the rapturous joy of the
sequel?
Arrayed like this who could resist
him?
The widow fell plump on his neck
and kissed him.
JIM is now lord of that lady and
Her snug little parcel of freehold
land.
"Here the pleasure-seeking public delight in
the health-giving nroma of the marine ozone,
anil a happy time can be speut amid the swish
of the never-resting waves. Bathing is freely
induged in without the restrictions of conven-
tionality."
This appears in a local paper under
the heading " Newbiggin's Charms."
Wo do not quite know what the
second sentence means, and find the
writer more intelligible when he re-
marks that
"The ]>erriots did not find the sands salubrious
to Iheir finances aud with the nobility, peculiar
to the Arab, tliey struck their tents, and
departed silently in the night."
We assume that these were talking
perriots—always a risky investment.
We learn from The Evening A'r?cs
that the Suffragettes have been
teaching some school-children the
following martial song for a parade:
Asquith, Gladstone,
Cabinet Ministers all;
Fifty thousand Suffragettes
Determined to have their way.
All of them doing their level be^t
To bring about Votes for Women.;
1^0 give your vote for a woman's sake,
And keep the Liberal out.
Clearly a protest against the " man-
made laws " of metre and rhyme.

IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.
'Pin-: first-class carriages happened to be few in number
and somewhat crowded, so the two ladies, after zig-
zagging feverishly up and down the platform for a
minute or two, decided at the last moment to enter a
smoking compartment occupied by three men. The
three men all moved at once in order to transfer their
hats and newspapers from the vacant seats, and the
two ladies plunged into a vortex of collisions mitigated
by excuses. Both ladies were flustered but triumphant.
One was young and fair, and conveyed a general im-
pression of being dressed in grey and having little silk
bags hanging from her wrists. The other was ample,
and her dominating note was tight black silk. She was
more mediaeval than her companion, and there were
suggestions of a Yorkshire terrier being concealed about
her person, stray canine gleams, as it were, of a black
snout and wisps of hair lovingly addressed as " Tiger"
and promptly thrust back into obscurity. Finally wo
all seated ourselves—I ought to have mentioned that I
was one of the three men invaded—and the ladies began
to talk to one another.
"Was it a bangle? " said the elder.
"Well, not quite a bangle, you know. You might
call it a bracelet. There was a pearl with some dia-
monds, and the clasp was Where *s my dressing-
bag-' I'm sure I saw it on the platform. The porter
must have Oh, thank you. I didn't-sec it on the

"Oh, he. I forget what he said. Something silly,
of course. There 's Tiger again. You mustn't let
that dog show so much. They '11 be wanting ft ticket

tapped herself all over, opened various little bags, and
found her watch peacefully ticking in its place on her
breast. "Fancy finding it there," ehe said. "I
thought I 'd left it on the toilet table."
"Watches," said her friend, "are more nuisance
than they 're worth."
After this the conversation dropped to u whisper for
a few moments. When it rose again the subject had
been changed. "Of course," said the grey lady, "she
tried to catch ALGY. Men are such perfect fools. She 's
four years older than he is, and "—she touched her
head—" not a hair of it her own."
"Bald?" asked the stout lady.
"Quito bald in front. I went into her room once
when she was dressing, and caught her putting it on.
Poor old ALGY. He isn't fit to go about without a
keeper. Go back, Tiger, naughty dog."

Tiger having been re-interned, the conversation con-
tinued:—
"Did he lose his temper? " said the stout lady.
"Well, you know what men are. He said, 'Mer-
ingues again,' and I said 'Yes, meringues.' Then he
said, ' I can't bear meringues. I 've often told you so;'
and he took one off his plate and threw it into the
fireplace. It was there at breakfast next morning. I
told the housemaid not to touch it."

Soon it stopped, and
porters were heard shout-

"Where "s my ticket?"
said the grey lady.
"I 've got mine," said

"You 've got mine,
too."
"No, I haven't."
"Well, then, where
can I have put it?"
To this there came no
answer, and the ticket-
collector entered the car-
riage. Three men and
one stout lady handed
over their tickets at once,
while the lady of the mer-
ingues went hunting for
hers. Two siH bags were
drawn blank twice, and
their miscellaneous con-
tents emptied over a seat.
There was o handkerchief

but no ticket. Then we
nil joined in. I took up
the cushions one after

brokers risked apoplexy in
searching under the seats.
At last the ticket was'
found on the window-sill. "It 's the wrong half," sa;d
the collector; "and there 's the dog—a shilling. Five-

ANOTHER MENACE FROM THE LICENSING BILL
"THE same as usual, I suppose, sir?" said Mr.
LEACH, dropping both hands into the pocket of his apron.
I respect LEACH. He is a little bald man, who years
ago invented a never-failing hair restorer. That is clear
proof of an unselfish nature. And more than that, he is
an artist who can boldly dare the most extensive under-
takings in hirsute expression. He can engineer a fuz-buz
that shall guarantee a perfect mastery of all that is
most intricate in CHOPIN. He can arrange the flowing
locks of melodrama in a manner to make you weep.
He knows to a nicety how to trim just at the turn of the
wave, and give assurance
of unostentatious literary
merit with a promise of
polished gems of style
hanging on a slender
thread of interest. He
can train a long wisp
from a left-side parting
to form a sort of bower
over a barren skull, and
mingle with the foliage
on the other side. No-
thing can move it—short
of poetic frenzy or taking
off the hat in a high
wind. For these reasons,
with unwavering confi-
dence 1 have these many
years entrusted to LEACH
the superintendence of
my head.
"Quit the same as
usual, LEACH. You know
exactly what 1 like,"
said I, taking my seat in
the sacrificial chair.
"Exactly," repeated
Mr. LEACH, with a bow
that included the scissors
and comb. Then, as he
deferentially adjusted my
head to get at the poll, he
sighed deeply.
There is a cleanness of
attack about LEACH'S
snip - snipping, together
with the assurance of
great power in reserve.
These give a sense of
security and induce re-
pose. It is usual with
many people under these
soothing influences to close the eyes. Then as one's
thoughts wander the voice of the barber undergoes trans-
formation and becomes a running brook. Only now and
then a phrase stands out from the flow of words—but
fraught with a strange power of hypnotic suggestion.
The hopeless melancholy of LEACH, the profundity of his
sigh, gave the impression of a great imprisoned soul
struggling under the limitations of human life.
"Cheer up, LEACH. Cheer up," I murmured.
LEACH shook his head. ''Ave you perused the per-
ticlars of the new Licensing Bill? " he inquired.
"Not carefully."
"It is clear to see you 'aven't put your money in a
brewery, sir."

grows barley? Where 's your farmers and your labourers

Not at all. You can be or remain in the perfessional
classes, but to 'old a licensed 'ouse is out of reach. Or
take myself, sir. Suppose it was only five shillings and
costs or seven days in my case. Could I become a publi-
can? No. I could cut "airs. I may move in the best
society, and ne reference made. But 'ave my name on a
signboard, I can't. Therefore, looking at it with the heye
of reason, I say, publicans are the. pick of the commercial
basket. Tho haristocracy of the trading community.
They are bound to be—'aving clean sheets, as they 'ave.
And I only wish 1 'ad 'im 'ere—I 'd cut 'is 'air!
"Or take the subjec' of Temperance. Can you make

If I can't get it open, shan't I get it sly? Of course I
shall. It 's the wrong way about, sir. Put on a penalty,
ses I, so heavy as you like for ti breach of the law, but
leave a man free. Legislation is not Nature, sir. Let
Nature put on the penalty. Now, say, like this, sir.

'Then I s'pose you 've earned it,' says I. 'Well,
perhaps I 'ave,' laughs you. Then I turn to and
shampoo you so fresh as a daisy. There 's nothing like
a shampoo, wet or dry, for a 'eadache. So there you
'ave it all. The whole scheme complete in a nutshell.

I opened my eyes. A hand-glass, deftly held,

"Good gracious, man! What lia vc you done? You've

my appearance for a month."
Orestes making oblation at his father's tomb did not

""Pis a clear case of mistaken—mistaken Indent-toy,"
ho stammered. "I was carried away, sir. I never mixed

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF Mr. R. C. LEHMANN has any superiors among rowing-
coaches, they must be very few; and if there are better
masters of lucid diction, they can't be very many. Any-
how, I know of no other living connoisseur, in either
kind, who so well combines the twofold qualifications
which go to make the excellence of The Complete Oars-
man (METHUEN). Students of the art of rowing will
have no need in future to take preliminary risks in a
boat; they can acquire perfect oarsmanship in their arm-
chairs with the help of Mr. LEHMANN's printed instruc-
tions and photographs. As the poet sang:
What UUDIE doesn't know of rowing
Caunot be very well worth knowing.
And he was right, though it. is true that the said RUDIE
had previously got him elected into the Leander Club.
Mr. LEHMANN traces back the history of English
rowing styles to KING ARTHUR'S day; but without
pedantry. Indeed, there is a fine reserve of strength in
his simple declaration: "I pass now from Tristram to
Bell's Life." But the
book is not for specialists
alone. The chapters on
"Famous Crews and
Memorable Races" arc
as thrilling as any tale of
heroic adventure. AnJ a
fine spirit of sportsman-
ship runs through the
volume, as befits the
work of an ardent ama-
teur. He is all for the
Game, as distinct from
personal achievement.
And, indeed, in rowing,
more than in all other
games, the first neces-
sity is combination, the
sacrifice of individualism
to uniformity of style,
and this perhaps largely explains why professionalism
is confined almost entirely to the one-man business of
sculling.
Mr. LKHMANN'S book has made a timely appearance;
and I could wish that at least one passage in it had been
laid to heart by a certain section (who shall be nameless)
at the Olympic Stadium, where it was much more
needed than it is ever likely to be among the good
sportsmen who meet at Henley:—"The real thing,
after all is said and done, is the game itself—that and
the spirit in which it is played. Compared to that,
victory or defeat in any particular race is a trifle."
Mr. LEHMANN has good right to say this, for the rowing
world recognises the fine cosmopolitan work he has done
for the advancement of the game that he loves the best.
When I first heard someone talking about The Last
Shore (CHAPMAN and HALL) I thought for a moment
that G.B.S. had been at it again. But when I got the
book I found that, though its title (as pronounced in
the best circles) recalled the name of our only dramatist,
the hand that wrote it was the hand of Mr. VINCENT
BROWN. The latest SHAW and The Last Shore are,
however, alike in this, that they both deal with certain
aspects of the married state. Or rather, to be precise,
Mr. BROWN'S book is about the unmarried state. In
the course of a violent quarrel between a brutal husband
and a friend whom he fancies to be in love with his
wife, the husband tumbles down a back-stair and cracks
his skull. The horror of this tragedy so plays on the
mind of the survivor that, though he and the widow
make no bones about setting up house together, they
agree to dispense with the customary formalities. Be-
sides her pseudo-husband, the lady has a wicked lover and
a devout lover. The wicked one—who has the makings
of a poisoner—falls into the pit that he had digged for
another, and is asphyxiated. Whereupon the devout
gentleman, who had been running a waiting race, comes
with a rush at the finish (I have just returned from the
Stadium), and carries off the lady to the bosom of
Mother-Church with the full consent of the third party.
It is not always true that all 's well that ends well,
and, though the book has its points, it is rather sombre
stuff.

morniny). "Mr GOOD FELLOW, I ASSURE YOU THAT YOB CAS SEE THE SKETCH

Criticism of a culinary dish is sometimes offered in
the formula that it is neither fish, flesh, nor good
red herring. The Japanese Spy (GRANT RICHAKDS) is
neither a record of travel, a political disquisition, nor
a good work of fiction.
Mr. LA.NCRLOT LAWTON,
attempt'.ng to combine
the three methods of
treatment, has produced
a book of prodigious
length, and of a duln;-s
which is relieved only by
marvel as to whither we
are going now, and who 's
who in the muddled
action. The best parts
are those devoted to de-
scription of social life in
Japan. In this Mr.
LAWTON is literally ;<t
home, and he would ha\ e
been more successful had
he been content to writa
a chatty narrative unen-
cumbered by a slight thread of fiction.
Bess of Hardcndalc, by THEODORA WILSON WILSON
(HUTCHINSON), is a strong novel, well written and
interesting. Miss WILSON doesn't allow her story to
maunder into byways or to drivel into obscurity. She
keeps a firm grip on it, and makes it obey her. Her
characters are real ficsh and blood, not wraiths dimly
seen through a mist of impressionism. Children, of
course, have been changed at birth in other stories
before this, but Miss WILSON gives a freshness to the
plot, and the reader excuses it for the sake of the
mother who passionately desired a boy and whose life
is saved by the substitution. All comes reasonably right
in the end; but I can't help thinking that Mr. Harden
might have been allowed to live out his six months of life
instead of being prematurely killed by a dog.
We understand that the next volume of the " Men of
the Hour " series will be entitled, Doratido and Sicvier;
or, The Two Winning Posts.
"Board in country cottage near gold links."—Daily Mnil.
"Cottage, near bone collar-stud" is what we

two or three of the bullets would
take effect." If this estimate of
Turkish marksmanship be a correct

Scarcely ever, we believe.

A LAWLESS PEACE.
THK hour incites to jocund song;
From teut and cabin, hut and cave,
Issues the happy, careless throng
To wallow in the teeming wave;
The sands are black with boisterous folk:
The infant sports with spade and bucket;
And LIZA on her lissom moke
To 'AURV'S "Chase me! " answers " Chuck it!
Nor are the spirit's needs forgot;
A coloured minstrelsy supplies,
With music made to touch the spot,
Laughter and tears and amorous sighs;
There is the Pierrot, wan with paint,
The Nigger, burnished like a scarabee,
To cause the ladies' hearts to faint
With songs of youth and love and Araby.
Similar draughts of bliss inflate
The Briton's waistcoat where he flogs
Some harmless pool from ten to eight
Or paints the moorland over dogs;
He has an air of ale-and-cakcs
Whether with infinite fatigue he
Surmounts the Matterhorn or takes
His axe by railway up the Ilighi.
What is the source of all this joy
"In widest commonalty spread"?
(Had I been in the Mail's employ,
"Far-flung" is what I must have said).
Is it perchance the change of scone
Allowed by intermitted labours
That makes us wear so glad a mien
And even almost love our neighbours?
'Tis that; but there 's a deeper cause: —

How potent for the public weal;

EVER ready to encourage dramatic talent, Mr. Punch
has been offering a prize consisting of a Daylight-Saving
Watch that contains n skip-and-jump movement as re-
quired under the coming Act—for the best handling of
a dramatic theme. The problem set was as foflows:—
She rich, He poor—in love with one another—but the
money stands in the way of their getting married.
Solution required.
After profound deliberation the judges have awarded
the palm to Mr. ARTHUR WING PiNERO for his effort
entitled
THE FAMILY SKELETON.
[The scene is a drawing-room in the Midland town of
Dumpborough, A family council is being held to
settle tlie, question of marrying Her. In order that

business, and he "d know how to put the money out to
advantage.
Isabel. A smug hypocrite!
Aunt Eliza. Ho, ho! Hoity-toity! I don't know
what girls are coming to nowadays! Why, he 's Grand
Master of the Order of Ancient Buffaloes.
Isabel (calmly). I will wot marry him. Mr. WAY-
MARK is the man I love.
Uncle Ed. (horrified). WAYMARK! A fellow earning
three pun a week at doctoring, and not even collecting
it! The family 's not going to stand a missalliance like
that! I suppose he 's been hanging round you trying to
get a look in at the money?
Isabel. Mr. WAYMARK has not done me the honour
of asking me to marry him. It is this wretched money
that is standing between us. I wish it had never been
left to me!
Great-Aunt Charlotte (from a back corner of the
room). It never was.
[General consternation.]
Uncle Ed. Oh, come now, Aunt, a joke 's all very-
well—I like a little joke myself at times—but this is
too strong!
Great-Aunt Charlotte. It never was! All these
years I 've held my tongue, but now I '11 speak out.
Your father was never properly married, ISABEL.
Aunt Eliza (scntentiously). Then the money ought
rightfully to come to us! I never did think it proper
for a young girl to have all that left to her.
Great-Aunt Charlotte (to Aunt Eliza). But that 's
not all. Your father, too, committed bigamy when he
married your mother. I found his first marriage lines
in between the leaves of our Bhakspeare only yesterday.
Uncle John. What a cunning place to hide them in!
Then where does the money go to?
Isabel. The lawyers must advertise and find out.
We must right the wrong.
Uncle Ed. Oh, come, ISABEL, we mustn't do that!
Think of the scandal! Where 'd my business go to il
this got about Dumpborough? We must 'ush it up.
Of course your ton thousand pun will have to bo divided
up equally amongst us. And perhaps (generously)
we '11 give you a couple of hundred between us. Look
here, ISABEL, you say nothing about this, and you can
marry young WAYMARK if you want to. And I tell you
what, I '11 get him a situation as Medical Officer of
'Ealth to the town. There 's plenty of pickings in that
post. Give us a kiss, lass, and settle it!

He (drying her hair). Why shouldn't I? I am your
equal in birth—my great-grandfather was a Regency
buck. I am more than your equal in education—I have
been to a Polytechnic. I am far cleverer than you—I
can build up a dozen styles of coiffure and you can't
build up one fit to be seen in. Moreover, I have a vote
and you haven't!
She. Would you think me very old-fashioned if I
referred to my rank and my income?
He. It would pain me—I should hate to suspect you
of being conventional. It is true that you have rank
and money, but I shouldn't refuse to marry you on that
account. As a Socialist I have too much pride and
courage to let a mere matter of that sort part us.
She. People might say that you were marrying me
for my money!
He. People might say that you were marrying mo
for my brains! But let us test the opinion of "people."
(Throwing open a window.) I will call up the first
"man in the street" that passes. . . . Hi! Hi!!
Come up!
She. Oh, he mustn't find me like this. (She knots
lier hair roughly into position and throws off the towel
from her shoulders.)
A Policeman (entering hastily). What "s the matter?
Murder?
He (calmly). Worse than that—marriage. As the
"man in the street" we want your opinion. This
lady and I are in love; she is rich and of high social
standing; I am poor but brainy; ought I to brave public
opinion by marrying her? Would it be likely to ruin
my prospects?
The Policeman. Well, I'm blowed!!!
He. Come—your opinion, constable!
The Policeman (slowly recovering). Is either of you
married already?
He. No.
The Policeman. And you aren't lunatics?
He. We three are the only sane people in Bond Street.
The Policeman (judicially). Well, the Law 's got
nothing to say against it. If you two people really
love one another . . .
He. Ah, the true British sentiment. It smacks of
roast beef and a black coat on Sundays. My last
scruple has vanished, NINON! I will marry you. You
cannot fight against me.
She (resignedly). I suppose one can't help the in-
evitable happening; that is always a comfort if things
go wrong. But remember, I shall keep the purse!

the lips".' It 's so horribly stilted."
"Well, rny dear," said Mr. BROOK-
WYLLIE, "it's a regular form of
words. How would you put it?"
"I should say, 'which have been
uttered,' or something simple and
direct like that," said BERYL.
"I don't mind that," said AGNES.
"Wrhat I object to is calling that
impossible Mr. HASTIE your old
friend. You know you 've always
barred him."
My dear, have I? He 's a very
good fellow at heart."
"Yes," said JACK, "they always
are—at heart—that breed."
"My dear children," said Mr.
BROOK-WYLLIE, "you are very
young. When you are my age you
will know that you must not be so
critical. I intend to call HASTIE my
old friend whatever happens. Be-
sides, for all practical purposes he
is."
"He did all he could to help in
your defeat at the last election,"
said JACK.
"Well, that was a matter of poli-
tical conviction. I can't punish him
for that."
"Political grandmother !" said JACK.
"Anyway," said AGNES, "you
needn't go out of your way to butter
him up."
"Well," said her father, "sup-
pose for a minute that I said
exactly what I felt, how do you think
it would come out? What kind of
a figure should I—should we all—
cut? I now resume," he added,
clearing his throat. "' Since public
speaking is not my forte 'By
the way, AGNES, is it 'forte,' or
'fort-e '? I notice people say
'pianofort-e ' a good deal."
"I should say ' forte '—one syllable
—if I were you," said AGNES.
"'. . . Since public speaking is
not my forte, I propose to say only
a very few words '"
"Hear! Hear! "• said JACK.
It has been a very great
pleasure to me to hand over to the
Corporation this piece of land.'"
"Oh, father," cried BERYL, "hovv
can you say so? It wasn't a pleasure.
You had to do it to keep Red-
lands."
"Well, my dear, it was a very
great pleasure to us all to keep
Bedlands, so the phrase is all right.
By handing over the land we had
pleasure."
"Yes," said AGNES dubiously, "I
suppose that 's true."
"' And I hope,'" Mr. BROOK-
WYLLIE continued, "' that it will
serve a useful and (may I add?)
delightful purpose in its new career
as a Bilmington lung.' That 's
rather good, I think."
"What 's good?" said BERYL
coldly.
"Why, the word 'lung.' Mean-
ing an open space."
'' Why not say 'open space,' then ?''
"My dear child, how could I?
Look at the tameness of it—' as a
Bilmingtou open space.'"
"Quite as good as 'lung,'" said
BERYL, "and more decent."
"Decent! " gasped the orator.
"Yes, decent. I consider the em-
ployment in rhetoric of the internal
organs of the human body a serious
blot."
"Human! " cried JACK. "Well,
I like that. Why, pigs have lungs."
"One does not think of a pig s
lungs," said BERYL. "Pig's trotters,
I grant you, and pig's liver; but
never pig's lungs."
"BKRYL," said her father, "you
are very young. When you come to
mv ftge you will realise that there
are many occasions when an epi-
grammatic term is more effective
than a plain and commonplace one.''
"You will also learn," JACK
added, "that the lung is never in-
decent."
"Don't be coarse," said BERYL.
"' A few words,'" Mr. BROOK-
WYLLIE went on, "'may not be
inopportune '"
"' Out of place,'" suggested BERYL.
"' . . inopportune, "Mr. BROOK-
WYLLIE continued, "'concerning
the history of the aforesaid plot.''
"Oh, father," cried AGNES, " not
'aforesaid plot.' That 's like a law-
yer's document."
"But how the dickens," said her
father, "is one to refer to it? I
can't say ' lung ' again."
"No, certainly not," said BERYL.
"This part has given me more
trouble than all the rest of the thing
put together," said Mr. BROOK-
WYLLIE. "How on earth those
writing fellows manage it, I can't
think."
"Say 'this piece of ground,' or
'the piece of ground in question,'
father," said BERYL.
"Very well. 'Piece of ground.'
'It came into the possession of my
ancestor Sir HUMPHRY BROOK during
the Commonwealth, being a grant
to him by OLIVER CROMWELL for
services rendered in the Parliamen-
tary cause.'
"Better go slow with that," said
JACK. "Old Lady CATT will be
present, and she 's a Jacobite and
all the rest of it. Sends a wreath
to Whitehall every year, don't you
know."
"Oh, please don't offend Lady
CATT," said AGNES. "At least, not
till the Pageant is over. She offered
to put us up all the week, and thab
will save all kinds of trouble."
"But it is the only interesting
part of my speech," said her father.
"Never mind, dad, cut it out,"
said AGNES. "It 's much better to
speak badly than well. People think
more of you. They 're suspicious of
fluent speakers. Just say you are
very much honoured and so on, and
sit down."
"I don't think I ought to," said
Mr. BROOK-WYLLIE. "I've taken
a lot of trouble over this speech, and
it will be expected of me. People
will go away disappointed if I don't
deliver it, and that won't be fair.
One must be fair and kind."
"True kindness," said BERYL,
"is not to make speeches at all."
"Oh, come, my dear," said her
father, "it 's not so bad as that.
Think what we should have missed:
DEMOSTHENES and CICERO and CATO
and—and—BURKE and GLADSTONE."
"Yes," said JACK, "and BROOK-
WYLLIE. Go on, father, and don't
listen to them. Only I would skip
OLIVER CHOMWELL if I were you."
"Very well," said Mr. BROOK-
WYLLIE. "Then I '11 go back to the
study and cut out OLIVER CROM-
WELL; but I 'm sure it will disappoint
them horribly. If you young people
were only a little older, you 'd know."

THE HOLIDAY PROSPECT.
SHALL I travel to far Honolulu,
Blest Island pf mountain and palm,
Though numbered with those as a rule who
Prefer that the sea should be calm?
Shall I bound on its breast as a sailor,
Inhaling the luscious ozone,
In a nautical suit that my tailor
Evolved from ideas of his own?
They tell me Aloha is delightful,
When sung by Hawaiian quartettes;
That the largest hotels are all quite full
Of the smartest and wealthiest sets;
That the surf and the rides through the passes
Are fine, and the starlit lagoons,
Where you float with a crew of picked basses
To warble appropriate tunes.
Shall I hie to Yosemite's gorges,
Where Sequoia gigantica * stands,
Reminiscent of juvenile orgies
On clarets of picturesque brands?
They tell me that everyone goes there
To fish, or take photos, or climb;
That one always meets people one knows there;
That the scenery 's simply sublime.
Yes, I feel it 's my duty to scan yon
Sierras, but then there are things
At Lake Tahoe, Palm Beach, The Grand Canyon,
Encenada and Arrowhead Springs,
That they tell me are just as enthralling,
And each one unique of its kind.
Good heavens! the number 's appalling!
I wish I could make up my mind.
Time was when I viewed the Atlantic
With a vastly inflated regard;
When Ramsgate still charmed a romantic
And grossly ill-recompensed bard;
When a trip to Southend on the Throstle,
Of heaven seemed more than a glimpse,
As one gaily washed down with a wassail
Of stout a sixpenn'orth of shrimps.
Selection in those days was easy,
One packed a few trifles away,
Then bought a cheap ticket to breezy
St. Leonards or balmy Herne Bay;
Where, extended at ease on the jetty,
One gazed on the life-giving sea,
Till the cares of existence seemed petty,
And the one thing that mattered was tea.
But alas! for the sense of elation
A respite from servitude lends;
I shall never enjoy a vacation
As I did those delightful week-ends;
When we 'd left the Swan Pier and were slipping
Past Greenwich, agog for the sights
And the sounds and the smells of the shipping,
And the fairway a-twinkle with lights.
Though I traverse the globe in expresses,
And the state-rooms of \\ners-dc-luxe;

Though for months at a timo my address is
The ends of tho earth, care of COOK'S;
Though I sample hotels without measure,
Ana scatter largesse like a lord,
I shall ne*er extract the same pleasure
Those holidays used to afford. ALGOL.
DISCURSIOIMS.
BRANDY IN BASUTOLAND.
A WHITE Paper recently presented to Parliament con-
tains a report of the proceedings of the Basutoland
National Council, which met at Maseru in January and
February of the present year under the Presidency of
Mr. H. C. SLOLEY, the Resident Commissioner, and
discussed matters of great moment. For instance, on
Monday, February 3rd, "the Council considered Law
No. 9, which dealt with the question of 'turning the
door of the house' from one chief to another." The
following interesting discussion then took place: —
MATSABISA: Who is to blame when a man turns the
door of his house—the man himself, or the chief
who receives him?
TSOLOANE: Both.
PATSO: The matter is almost as great & source of danger
to the country as brandy.
PHILIP: If men turn from one chief to another and it
is found that these chiefs have done nothing towards
having the matter cleared up, then the chiefs should
be punished.
QAMAKO: It is a very difficult matter for chiefs to deal
with.
SEKAKE: Who amongst us is said to be breaking this
law? Let him be named.
NKING: The men who are at fault in this matter are
the petty chiefs. They are always turning to
greater chiefs.
Reverend N. MPITI recommended plainer speaking.
JAMES MATETE: I consider the matter of turning tho
door to be a very important one.
Here, however, the matter ended. The Reverend N.
MPITI'S recommendation of plainer speaking was not
followed up, and we are left guessing. I suppose
"turning the door of the house" must bo something
like "crossing the floor of the House" with us. In
Basutoland Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL would be said to
have tunied the door of tho house from Mr. BALFOUR
to Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN. On the other
hand, Major RENTON, M.P., and a number of Haggcrston
electors have just turned it in the opposite direction.
In Basutoland they would be blamed for this tergiver-
satory proceeding.
Later on the Council discussed witchcraft, and it is
stated that " the opinion of the Council appeared to be
that legislation on the subject would be unadvisable, as
certain forms of witchcraft were certainly practised by
universal custom; but it was denied that the practice of
'litaola,' or bone-throwing, involved the mention of indi-
viduals' names.'' I am glad of that; though I am bound
to say that to throw bones, so to speak, in vacua, would
appear to be an aimless and uninteresting pursuit.
When our own ancestors used to make little figures of
wax and stick pins into them, they were never foolish
enough to make what I may call general figures. They
made them in the particular likeness of a favourite

enemy, and always hoped for fatal results from the
pin-sticking.
I pass on, however, to the tremendous question of
brandy, which the Council debated on Saturday and
Monday, February 1st and 3rd. We, too, have had our
Licensing debates; but, unlike the House of Commons,
the Basuto chiefs appeared to be all of one mind in
the matter. A few extracts from the Basutoland
Hansard will show the nature of the discussion: —
PARAMOUNT CHIEF: With regard to brandy, I drink it
myself; but when I see its effects on others I can
see that it is a bad thing.
JOSIAS: There is no use in chiefs saying they should
put a stop to brandy-smuggling unless they bind
themselves to stop drinking brandy.
Reverend C. M. SEBETA: One of the greatest evils of
brandy-drinking is that chiefs cannot hear cases
owing to being drunk. We shall soon ask that those
who are drunken should not have the right of
hearing cases.
Various chiefs having spoken in the same strain, the
Council closed with prayer.
This was on Saturday, and the subject came up again
on Monday, when MAKHAOLA opened the proceedings: —
MAKHAOLA: I do not know what good these men, who
even come into the Council after drinking, are as
advisers. I do not drink myself, and can always
attend to the messages of the Assistant Commis-
sioner.
This remark was evidently regarded by the Paramount
Chief as being of the nature of a personal attack on
himself. He at once retorted with some dignity :—
PARAMOUNT CHIEF: No one has ever found me incapable
of doing business through drunkenness, but I
occasionally suffer from headache.
Had this remark been uttered in the House of Com-
mons it would certainly have been punctuated by " Loud
laughter and cheers." In the Basuto Council, however,
it passed without any comment whatever. It must be
admitted that in thus pleading guilty to the minor count
of headaches the Paramount Chief gave himself away.
Finally the Resident Commissioner wound up the
debate with an excellent speech, in which he promised
to do what he could to help the Basutos in this matter.
He told them they must choose between national
prosperity and drink, and also declared that he would
"talk over this matter with the Paramount Chief before
he leaves Maseru." I hope there will be no more head-
aches, and in the meantime I commend the whole of
this debate to the notice of those who propose to speak
in our own Licensing debates in the autumn.
The Liverpool Echo, describing some prehistoric
remains lately discovered, states that " the femur boner,
of some of the skeletons exceeded in length by several
inches the same bones in the arms of the biggest
workmen.
We thought there must be something wrong about the
construction of some of our workmen. No wonder wo
have so many unemployed.

A PA11TIAL PORTRAIT.
MR. HAROLD Cox, M.P.
SOMEWHAT schoolmasterlike in mien,
Yet simpler in his speech than
scholars,
Undeviatingly serene,
Artistic in his ties and collars—
Such is the style of HAROLD Cox,
The man who gives his Party shocks.
Aloof, alone, yet undismayed,
When any Party move is mooted
That will not tally with Free Trade,
Cox preaches COBDEN undiluted,
Regarding as a base defection
LLOYD-GEORGE'S dallyings with Pro-
tection.
A thorough master of detail,
A perfect demon at statistics,
He never yet was known to fail
In castigating cranks or mystics;
And when an ignoramus chatters,
Cox tears his fustian into tatters.
When ASQUITH seeks in rounded
phrase
To palliate some rash surrender
To Labour's menace, or essays
The role of Poverty's defender,
Cox bids him talk to the marines,
And gives the polished Premier beans.
Yet though his sentiments are strong
And though his irony is searing,
Such virtues to his speech belong
He never fails to gain a hearing;
Nor does he strive to be effective
By lapsing into crude invective.
Expert at diagnosing fools
Who grope in intellectual twilight
Or seek to sit upon two stools,
He radiates unceasing dry light
Upon the sophistry that snares
The minds of muddled doctrinaires.
Free from the tremors that assail
The vacillating opportunist,
Whore Folly flounders like a whale
He smites it like a good harpoonist,
Delighting specially in digs
At all humanitarian prigs.
The efforts of the candid friend
Excited CANNING'S execration,
But HAROLD Cox contrives to lend
The part a certain elevation;
For here at least the wounds are felt
To be in faithful earnest dealt.
Most Members treat with more re-
spect
Their Party's whip, their Party's
banner;
Few have a keener intellect,
A more alert debating manner;
And few would be more badly missed
Than Cox, the Individualist.

been kept standing outside for half-an-hour in a long
queue, for all the world as if the place were a soup-
kitchen, the least you can do now they have let us in is
to find a table to sit down at!
Mr. Spettigue (a wizened little man with an air of
nourcd depression). If we wait here, they '11 give us one
presently.
Mrs. iS'. You never get anything in this world, THEO-
HALP, if you wait for people to come and offer it you. I
see a table over there which will do well enough. Quick
now—before anyone else gets it!
Mr. S. (as they arrive at a table laid for four). I don't
know if you 're aware of it, DEBORAH, but this table has
a card with " Reserved " on it.
Mrs. S. (seating herself, tearing the card into pieces,
and throwing it under the table). It hasn't got it now,
anyhow. If people reserve places, they should come in
time to take them. But you 've no idea of standing up
for yourself, THEOBALD—you leave me to do everything.
It was I who insisted on those people taking their places
at the end of the line just now when they were trying to
push in before us.
Mr. S. One of them said he 'd engaged a table for
four, my dear.
Mrs. S. Very likely he did—but it doesn't follow that
he was telling the truth, tioes it? (Two young men in
straw hats enter with their respective fiancees.) They 've
just come in—don't look round. Those two hussies with
them are no better than they should be, 7 'II be bound!

near the commissionaire chap at the door? Well, she
and her husband have nipped in first and calmly taken
our table. However, I '11 soon have 'em out of that.
(Approaching Mr. SPETTIGUE) Sorry to disturb you, Sir,
but as a matter of fact this table is reserved for us—
you will notice it is laid for four.
Mrs. S. THEOBALD, tell this young man that it is
nothing to us if it was laid for forty. We got here first—
and we intend to stay here.
Reggie (to his friend). This is a bit too thick. I '11
see if I can find the manager. (Returns later with the
manager.)
The Manager (to Mr. S.). Excuse me, but ze gentle-
man have engage zis table. I give you anozer, very
nice, inside there—for two persons.
Mrs. S. Thank you—my husband and I are very
comfortable where we are, we shall certainly not move—
unless you choose to drag us away by main force.
Manager (iritli a shrug, to REGGIE). I am sorry—but
viz such types, vat can I do'.' And to-night zere is so
much crowd. I have no more any tables for four at
present. If you like to sit here all ze same, I tell them
to bring two more chairs. (REGGIE consults his party—
they decide to accept this arrangement; the chairs arc
brought, REGGIE being on Mr. SPETTIGUE'S right, facing
Mrs. S.)
Mr. >S'. I should not have thought this table large
enough to seat so many as six, should you, DEBORAH?
Mrs. S. Certainly not, THEOBALD—but if people will
thrust themselves in like this, I suppose we must put up
with the consequences. I always say the worst about
coming to a place of this sort is the company one is
brought in contact with!
RKGGIE (gloomily, to himself). We "re in for a rotten
time, if I can't manage to shunt DEBORAH and THEO-
BALD! How would it be if I I '11 try it, anyhow.
(Aloud to Mr. S.) Come, now, haven't you kept this up
about long enough. Uncle THEOBALD?
Mrs. S. (bristling). "Uncle Theobald," indeed!
THEOBALD, don't tell me that young man is any relation
of yours!
Mr. S. Of course not, DEBORAH. (To REGGIE) I
don't know what you 're talking about, Sir, and I 've no
wish to know.
Reggie (affectionately). I wouldn't go on with it any
longer, Uncle. Really, I wouldn't. 1 can't bear to see
you and Auntie there—two of the dearest, merriest old
souls who ever breathed—(Mrs. S. glares at this descrip-
tion, while her husband regards him with a scowl of
suspicion)—you are—you frnoir you are—I can't see you
letting my friends here misunderstand you for a minute
more than is necessary. If you won't tell them, I must!
Mr. S. (hopelessly mystified). Tell them—tell them
what? / 've nothing to'tell your friends, Sir!
Reggie. "Then you leave it to me, Uncle? All right.
(To hist party) It was like this. My dear uncle and
mint found out wo were dining here to-night, and so
Aunt DEBORAH—who never could resist a spree—sug-
gested giving you all a pleasant surprise by joining the
par|;y. (General surprise and bewilderment.)
Mrs. S. (to the party). Don't believe a word he says!
It 's an absolute falsehood!
Reggie. I 'm wrong. No, it was Uncle suggested
that. And then, Aunt DEBORAH, you said, what fun it
would be if you and Uncle got in first and pretended to
be a cantankerous old couple who couldn't play the game
for toffee. And jolly well you 've done it, too, I will say!
Anyone would have been taken in who didn't know what
ripping good sorts you really were. But you mustn't let
your love of practical joking carry you too far, you know.
Now own up, and be your own cheery selves!
(Delighted applause from Jiis party, wlio by this time
have grasped the situation.)
Mrs. S. (crimson with rage). Don't take the slightest
notice of that young jackanapes, THEOBALD, or of those
giggling minxes either. They are only trying to make
us ridiculous! It is high time you thought about order-
ing some food. (Taking the carte from a waiter) I shall
have consommc'e—and you had better have the same.
And curried mutton and rice to follow.
Reggie (tenderly). Do, Aunt DEBORAH, do. But
you '11 have some fish first? Do try a little fish! To
please me!
Mrs. 3. (furiously). Are we ordering this dinner, or
are you?
Reggie. Oh, I thought I was to be host—but, of
course, if you insist (To the party) Just like my
dear Aunt and Uncle—always so hospitable! (Leaning
over Mr. S.) If I might suggest, Uncle, I wouldn't havo
braised lobster—safe to bring on your gout—and isn't
curried mutton just a little heating this weather? For
Aunt, I mean. Do you mind if we have some chicken
mayonnaise and Neapolitan ices instead?
Mrs. S. Have whatever you please. It 's nothing to
us!
Reggie. Awfully good of you, Aunt! (To the others,
in a stage whisper) Simply rolling, both of 'em!
Mrs. S. Stop, waiter—you 're sure you quite under-
stand what you 're to bring us?
Waiter (rapidly). Consommee, braise lobstare, curri
mutton, mayonnaise, rasberri tart, Napolitau ices for
seex—alright. (He rushes off before Mrs. S. has time to
protest.)
Reggie. You do understand ordering a little dinner,
Uncle! Are you looking for the wine list? (Handing it)
Lager will do us quite well—you and Aunt DEBORAH, I
know, never drink anything but champagne—that ain't a
bad wine—but a little on the dry side, for Auntie's taste.
A glass or two of champagne will buck you up like any-
thing, Aunt. And you 're coming with us on the Spiral
Railway and the Flip-Flap, aren't you? I remember
how you enjoyed yourself at Earl's Court last year. Hoir
many times was it you went down the Helter-Skelter
Lighthouse? Fifteen—or was it twenty?
Mrs. S. (rising wratlifully). If you prefer to endure
the impertinences of a pack of impudent young idiots,
THEOBALD, remain by all means. But don't expect me
to put up with them—for I will not!
Reggie (rising). Aunt, I implore you. If you must
'deprive us of your genial presence—at least—at least
leave us Uncle THEOBALD!
His Party. Yes, yes—do let Uncle THEOBALD stay!
Mr. S. (rising). I am coming, DEBORAH—I have long
felt that this is no place for us.
Reggie. I won't say good-bye. Perhaps, dear Aunt
and Uncle, when time and curried mutton have brought
you to a gentler mood, we may all meet and forget this
unhappy family feud—on the Flip-Flap.
(They edge their way past him, and retreat in some

Aren't they, Miss CRAW-

Mrs. Jackson. And how

Mrs. Jackson. What!
Through all those people,

consider that an equivalent to an

Miss CKAWLEY, if MURIEL sees her in
the street she is not to bow.
Miss Crawley. Certainly, Mrs.

Mrs. Jackson. You should never
have gone near her in the water at
all. You placed yourself in a very
awkward position. Miss CRAWLEY,
you must bathe with MUKIEL to-
morrow, and keep her near the right
people.
Miss Crati'lcy. I am afraid it will
upset me, Mrs. JACKSON, and the
tents are a very long way from the
water.
Mrs. Jackson. Nonsense; you '11
soon get used to that. I cannot
have my child running these risks.
Besides, you may be useful to
Mrs. LEADER-RIPTON, who has not
brought her governess or maid, I
believe.
Muriel. But I don't think I want
to bathe any more, mumsy.
Mrs. Jackson. Of course you must
bathe, you foolish child. But go and
dry her now, Miss CRAWLEY; the

with her hair. And to-morrow you

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN I take up a novel and read right at the beginning
"Through the open window the clear, sad cry of some
night-flying water-fowl reached her. The elfin ring in
it quieted her tumultuous thoughts," I naturally
assume that the note of romance, like the widgeon's (or
whatever it was), is going to be pitched fairly high. But
in Love and the Poor Suitor (HuTCHINSON), the only
unusual feature that Mr. PERCY WHITE has provided is
the lady's name, Sonia (short for Ausonia), and, barring
the fact that her husband is a struggling artist and
that the book ends in Rome, there is really no justifica-
tion for this heroic piece of nomenclature. The
appalling poverty of life in a Hammersmith flat is the
theme on which the plot turns, and there is a shadowy
tcrtium quid in the person of Lionel Musgrave, a rich
dilettante and critic,
but as Sonia never
felt the slightest in-
terest in him I felt
bound to imitate her
example. Treated as
a mild comedy, the
story would go well
enough, but Mr.
WHITE evidently con-
ceives it to be a full-
blooded drama, and
there I do not fol-
low him. If Mr.
Musgrave had been
a little more enter-
prising and Sonia a
little less placid,
or if there had been
any chance of her
husband's really
starving, I might
have been stirred;
but, as a matter of
fact, poor suitor
though he was, hf
stuck to his last, I
should say his
palette, with a diligence that was so praiseworthy as to
bo not a little dull.
in me the frame of mind for ever connected with Oliver
Twist's mood at meal time. As a story it is brightly
told, the interest maintained to the last page. Lady
NAPIEK has a keen eye for character, and can draw it
with a few light touches. She knows many women,
but with the exception of her heroine, Betty Fitzhngh,
a charming girl, she is not fortunate in her findings.
Some of the portrait-paintings of woman—scheming,
iselfish, dishonest, at best frivolous—look dangerously
like sketches from life made in circles of more or less
intimacy. If Lady NAPIER does not love all women,
she is at least alive to the beauties of landscape. Also
she likes dogs. One of the best-drawn characters in a
clever book is her four-legged confidant and companion
"Johnnie."

With various sports of the good old brand,
Who crack their bottles and whips, and act

From London City (abode of crime!)
Who weave foul plots, but finally fail

In The Cliff End (GRANT RICHARDS) Mr. E. C. BOOTH
has been more generous than discreet. His pen is so
fluent that he has allowed his showers of metaphor and
simile to become a
deluge, and I regret
this the more be-
cause he says many
things which are
w-ell worth saying.
In method he re-
minds me often of
Mr. DE MORGAN; he
is as leisurely, and
shows as humorous n
sympathy for all
sorts of curious
people, but he just
lacks the charm
which makes Mr. DE
MORGAN'S discursive-
ness pardonable.
You do not mind
how long Mr. UK
MORGAN goes on, but
with Mr. BOOTH you
are concerned to
know when he is
going to stop. The
scene of The. Cliff
End is laid in a York-
shire village, and Mr.
BOOTH has the touch which makes his characters like-
able even when they are ridiculous. His gallery cf
minor portraits is full of admirable work, and if the
hero and heroine— "Wynne, a composer who was visiting
the village, and Paw, a post-girl who spent her leisure
in wanting to be a sister to her numerous swains—are
a little commonplace, The Cliff End is, after all, a book
which depends more upon its setting and its subsidiary
characters than upon its main theme. As a novelist
Mr. BOOTH has an equipment almost too ready to hand,
and he has only to spare himself—and not, in golfing
language, to press—if he is to fulfil the promise he has
already shown.

OUR DRAMATIC COMPETITION.
(Concluded.)
[It will te recalled that the problem set was as follows:— She rich,
He poor— in love with one another — but the money stands in the way
of their getting married. Solution required.]
MR. SOMERSET MAUGHAM'S innumerable successes on
the London boards should console him to some extent
for having gained only third place in our competition
with the following exercise :—
THE DETRIMENTAL.
[The scene is the usual Mayfair drawing-room. She,
the usual Society debutante, is leaning back amongst
the usual sofa, cushions. He, the usual Society
young man, is leaning the usual elbow on- the
usual mantelpiece and throwing off the usual smart
sayings.
He (moodily). I 'rn going off to the Colonies — the
refuge of the deservedly destitute.
She. Ah, no, you are worthy of better things than
that?
He. If we all got what we were worth on this earth
there would be no need for an under-world hereafter.
She. Won't you change your -mind and stay? . . .
(Hesitatingly and lowering her eyes.) For my sake?
He. Men are not allowed to change their minds —
except politicians and millionaires. I 'in only a pauper.
She. The peerage?
He. Fifteen lives stand between me and the Earl-
dom, and most of them are hale and hearty. That 's
why your mother is usually out when I call.
She (banging a cushion). Money is hateful.
He (kicking the fender). Lack of it is still more
hateful..
[A footman enters with the usual urgent letter for him.
He (taking the letter). Excuse me. (Opens it, reads,
and then lets it flutter to the ground.) Two uncles and
four cousins gone — a yachting accident.
She (eagerly). Then you are rich now?
He. Only in my love for you. Nine lives still stand
between me and a banker's smile.
Newsboy (shouting off stage). Spesh-hul! Orrrrhbl
Dsssahhhstr! Spesh-hul!
[He goes to window and buys a copy of the paper, opens
it, reads, and then lets it flutter to the ground.
She (tensely). What is it?
He. Two more uncles, one cousin, one second-cousin,
ono half-cousin, three nephews, and one half-nephew —
the liner went down in mid-ocean. . . . That leaves me
high and dry as the heir.
Her Mother (entering with a telegram). Have you
hoard the news? The old Earl . . .
He (taking the telegram, reading, and tlien letting it
flutter to the ground). A boating accident. . . So there 's
gold in sea- water after all.
She (whispering to tier Mother). He succeeds to the
title.
Her Mother. My dear boy, you have my very
dee pent condolences. I hope (archly) you will manage
to spare a little more time to call on us in the future!
You have always been a most weloome guest here!
He. Thank you. (Sotto vocc) Sapphira!
(Curtain.)
"Honourable mention" is also accorded to a
dramatist who writes under the pseudonym off "X."
(Will he. kindly send his name and address?)
THE BOOSTER.
[The scene is a farmyard in the Isle of Man. A milk-
maid is pumping real water from a real pump into
a. real milk-pail. A flock of real sheep parses across
the stage. Exit the milkman, stumbling over a
real hayfork. She, the farmer's daughter, enters,
carolling blithely, iciih a dish of real peas to shell.
He enters in farm-labourer's dress, and surveys her
melo-soulfully for some moments.
He (removing his hat elaborately). Good morning,
Miss GWYNIFRED.
She. Good morning, QUIM.IAM.
He. Can I help you with your task?
She (doubtfully). Oughtn't you to be turning out the
pig-sty?
He. I ought to be, but I cannot bear to bo turning
out pig-styes when I might be near you.
She (aside). How noble he is! (Aloud) If my father
wore to ...!
He (heroically). Let him! I would face even his
wrath for your sake. For I love you, GWYNIFRED, I
love you with the- inmost fibres of my heart t Name the
deed of daring to be- done for your sake, and it shall
bo done.
She (bursting into tears). If only I dared . . .!
He. Dared what?
She. If only I dared to sacrifice my position! To
become the wife of a poor labourer! . . . But, yes, I
will, I ivill marry you, whatever the world may say!
(Throwing herself into his arms.)
He (recoiling). Never! Never shall it bo said that I
let you sacrifice- yourself for me! If there is any sacri-
fice to bo made it is for me to make it! I will give you
up, and go away to seek my fortune.
She (clinging to him.). No, you shall not, QUILLIAM t
If you love mo truly, you will not be so selfish as to
wound me by sacrificing yourself. It would break my heart.
He. In this world, dearest, the call of duty comes
first. My duty is sacrifice, and I shall go through with
it to the bitter end! 'Tis better that wo should part.
She. Then I shall cast myself down from yonder cliff.
He (burying his forehead in his hands). What a
terrible situation! Is there no solution to it? No
way out?
A Postman (appearing ut the gate). Is Master
QUILLIAM QUATKINS about the house?
He (rising majestically). I am QUILLIAM QUATKINS.
Speak ovit and fear not!
The Postman. Then I have a document for you.
(Holding out an open document with a conspicuous red
seal.) You have been elected Turncock to the House
of Keys and Booster-General of the Isle of Man.
She (ecstatically). Oh, QUILLIAM, all my life I have
longed to be a Booster's wife! How splendid for you!
He (to the Postman). Convey to them my acceptance
of the posts. [Exit Postman.
She. Nothing shall ever, ever part us now!

And in the lane that borders the garden
No scent of petrol affronts the nose.
Our style of living is not tip-top,
But you 're neither epicure nor fop,
And you shall have the prophet's chamber
As long as ever you care to stop.
1 own that most of the reasons I give
To tempt you hither are negative,
But it is a boon that no fat stockbrokers
Within our six-mile radius live.
The boys are home from Eugby. HUGH
Already is quite as tall as you;
JACK goes to Oxford in October,
With hopes of winning a football blue.
MAUD'S skirts are lengthened — she calls them
'' trains '';
Her hair, the most rebellious of manes,
Is now put up, and she gives good promise
Of passable looks as well as brains.
If you hanker after a life of ease,
We '11 sling you a hammock under the trees,
Where little is heard from morn till even
Except the drowsy murmur of bees.
If games allure, our friend the Dean,
Next-door, has a capital bowling green;
Or MAUD will take you on at tennis,
And give you probably half fifteen.
There 's cricket, too, in the village; COBB,
My coachman, trundles a curly lob;
Your godson JACK 's a lusty smiter.
And / don't always get out for a "blob."
Well, come if you can, and let it be soon,
For, though the landscape is best in June,
You 're not too late to see the glory
Of ripe wheat under an August moon;
To witness, unaided by costly mummery
Or wigs, or any sort of flummery,
The finest pageant that England offers—
The country arrayed in a garb still summery.

THE CHASE OF THE GROUSE.
[You may have read a lot of bright inform-
ative articles on this subject during the last
few days, but this is brighter and more inform-
ative than any of them.]
A CLEVER cynic once observed—
(N.B.—He didn't; but tbis makes a
good start for any article)—that the
only reasons for Scotland's existence
were that it provided a home for
Mr. CAHKEGIE, seats for Liberal
Cabinet Ministers, and forests for the
grouse.
What a picture King's Cross
Station presents a day or two before
the Glorious Twelfth. (N.B.—The
Great Northern station, not the
Metropolitan. Many people wishing
to witness the northern exodus, as
it is called, have spent hours at the
latter, to their great disappointment.)
Fox-hunting is over, flat-racing has
not begun, and peers and Cabinet
Ministers, sovereigns and suffragettes,
bishops and baronets, surge wildly
up and down the platforms—all eager
for the blood of the grouse.
You may see (or you may not)
Lady WARWICK with her famous
brace of blood-hounds, which will
soon be on the scent of the bird,
or Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL with his
petted dachshund which has played
havoc with many a grouse warren.
On these occasions the lot of the
humble porter is to be envied. No
more content with the customary
two-pence, he demands gold for
merely cramming one of England's
nobles into an already crowded
guard's-van. Often a porter gathers
in between two and three hundred
pounds during this busy week, and
railway directors have been known
to assume the porter's uniform in
order that they might share in the
golden harvest.
Soon all (with the exception of the
porters) arc whirling northward eager
to hear once more the sweet song
of " Scotland's nightingale." Quaint
it is that the favourite exclamation
of the grouse, as of the Scot, is
"Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!" Un-
happily the grouse is a delicate bird,
especially when hatched out by the
domestic fowl or duck. That fearful
disease " the gapes " often decimates
the feathered inhabitants of the
grouse-forest. This year the famous
forests around Dundee, Stirling, and
Montrose will be ruined by this
disease. Experienced keepers allege
that the outbreak of "the gapes"
coincided with the series of Scotch
by-elections.
Fabulous prices are paid for the
choicest grouse forests. Mr. BAILLIE-
McNAB's famous Fochabers estate
of four hundred acres always com-
mands a rent of ten thousand pounds
for the season. The MACKINNON of
Graddock has a kailyard, situated
between two famous grouse forests,
which lets literally at a pound a
square foot. But, of course, in this
instance the lessee has no expenses
of keepers' or beaters' wages. He
merely lies in ambush amongst the
kail and brings down the grouse as
they rocket over from one forest to
the other.
But what cares the sportsman for
expense when once more he sets foot
in his beloved Scotland?
(N.B.— Now for a bit of fine
sporting writing. Some of it may be
Crockettese. You proceed at your
own risk):—
At dawn the faithful ANGUS raps
at my window, and after draining a
flask of usquebaugh, cries, "Hoots,
mon, I spaed a grouse o' seven tyne
sprouching on Ben Glumskill this
morn." (Sprouching, I may explain
to the illiterate Southerner, is crouch-
ing to spring on its prey.)
In half a minute I throw a kilt
round me and rush down-stairs.
My trusty repeating rifle is on my
shoulder, ANGUS grips the whisky
keg and the sandwiches, and we
set off on our six-mile crawl to
Ben Glumskill. The hot sun beats
upon me, a hail-storm sweeps down
from the hills, the keg springs a
leak till ANGUS heroically plugs it
with his mouth; yet in spite of mis-
fortunes I press on. At last, tired
and worn, I creep over the summit
and espy the cock grouse of Ben
Glumskill not a dozen yards away
singing sweetly as he perches on a
tussock. (Please note admirable
local colour in last word.) ANGUS
hastily slides the rifle into my hand.
"Try a sighting shot, mon, whiles
he sings."
Bang!
"A wee bit tae the left, aiming at
the middle grouse ye see—none of
the outside yins—and allowing for
the wind."
Crack, crack, crack, goes the re-
peater. At last, at the twentieth
shot, the grouse collapses. He
makes an effort to crawl away, but
the deadly explosive bullet has done
its work.
"The landing-net, ANGUS," I cry.
"Approach wi' caution, mon," he
answers as he gives it me.
Another moment and we are gazing
on the noble carcase.
'' Hoots, we maun wet its feathers,''
cries ANGUS.
Alas! alas! the keg is empty.
FACTS ABOUT FOOD.
CHICKEN cutlets are made of rabbit.
Hence the name.
Though in the latter end they are
inseparable, in their early youth rasp-
berries and red currants do not grow
on the same trees.
Rhubarb is spelt with an " h " and
eaten with a fork.
For those who prefer the juice to
the substance of this delicious if inex-
pensive stalk, a spoon is substituted
for the fork. The " h," however, is
still retained.
Chicken patties are so called
because they are made of rabbit.
There is no edible substance known
to mankind which does not find its
way into a plum pudding, save only
the common plum.
Even the most skittish lamb on
the brightest spring morning may be
reduced to a state of comparative
solemnity by the production of a bowl
of mint sauce. It is odd what an
antipathy the gentle creature has to
this apparently innocuous liquid.
Market gardeners admit that the
most responsible part of their work
is the selection of professions for their
potatoes. Many a promising spud
has failed miserably as a saute which
would have been an instant success
as a mash.
Consistently with the derivation of
their title, chicken creams are made
of rabbit.
The only safe way to eat a straw-
berry ice is to place a small portion
at a time upon the tongue and press
it against the roof of the mouth.
WThen it is thoroughly warmed
through it is fit to swallow. It seems
a pity that this heating process can-
not be done in the kitchen, where
more suitable and efficient apparatus
is available.
Every cloud has a silver lining, so
that milk may be boiled in it without
fear of burning.
Game cutlets are made of rabbit.
In their case no snobbish exclusive-
ness is shown in the selection of the
rabbit.
Welsh rarebit is neither Welsh nor
rare. It is not, however, made of
rabbit.

AN EPOCH-MAKING BANQUET.
IT was a happy thought to bring
together at one table all the HENRY
VIII.'a who have figured in recent
pageants.
At the head sat Dr. BEST, who was
HENRY VIII. in the Dover Pageant,
while around him were seated HENUY
VIII.'s from Winchester, Chelsea,
Pevensey, St. Albans, Gloucester,
Derby, Worcester, and several other
towns which have lately celebrated
their picturesque past in the very
attractive new manner.
It was an imposing and splendid
scene. Never have so many corpu-
lent gentlemen in dazzling array
dined together before. At first it
had beon intended that they should
meet merely as private friends, to
exchange experiences and jokes; but
to Dr. BEST came tho excellent idea
of insisting upon their appearing in
their regal habit, and every guest
therefore retired to a dressing-room
before tho banquet and donned the
royal jerkin. Tho Savoy has wit-
nessed many strange sights, but none
stranger than this: a dozen Royal
HARRYS, all exactly alike, bending
over their plates in unison, genial,
prosperous and majestic in girth—
each one every yard a king.
From statistics gathered during the
evening it appears that the heaviest
representative—Alderman FAGGE, of
Gloucester—weighs nineteen stone
eight, and the lightest (with one ex-
ception) fifteen stone three. These
figures were ascertained at the re-
ception before dinner, a weighing-
machine being in attendance; what
they afterwards wore who shall say?
One HAL, however, it should be ex-
plained, had stuffed for the part—
Mr. LANCASTER, of Derby — whose
weight without pillows is only twelve
stone. None of the others, let it
proudly be put on record, had any
recourse to art for their pomp of
flesh. The total weight of the com-
pany was 1 ton 2 cwt. 1 stone 12 Ibs.
Of the twelve monarchs, five only
wore their own whiskers: the rest
were made up very skilfully, although
as the evening wore on and the heat
grew more noticeable some of these
artificial appendages showed a ten-
dency to slip. The oldest HENRY was
sixty-two; the youngest forty-nine.
Their total ages came to 672 years.
One was a doctor; two were
brewers; three were retired gentle-
men; one was an auctioneer; one a
hotel proprietor; one a butcher; one
a yachting-agent; one a veterinary
surgeon, and one a town clerk.

&i*Hennch IJnmor'ifl (amnxinrj liimtrlf at fjepenme of Hiyltland Caddie). "HOOTS, YE KEN,
MA WEE BIT LADDIE, \01f WAS NAE BO JIUCKLE BAD A SHOT THE KOO. WlIAT THINK YE?"
The Bit Ijaddie. "En! An'M TIIINKEN YE'LI, LEARN Scorcu QUICKEU'N IE'LL EVER
LEADS OOt'F!"
It was computed by a mathe-
matical professor from Harvard, who
was staying in the hotel and was
deeply interested in the occasion,
that the chances against twelve
HENRY VIII. "s dining together again
are eight million to one. In spite of
this, however, they have arranged to
do so next year.
The meal was in character. The
waiters were dressed as beefeaters.
Ale and Malmsey wine and sherris
sack were drunk; boars' heads and
chines of beef were eaten.
Dr. BEST proposed tho health of
Mr. Louis N. PARKER, "tho HENRY
VIII.," as he wittily put it, "of
pageant makers" — meaning, as
he explained, not that he was of
extraordinary girth but extraordinary
attainments. (Cheers.) Ho also pro-
posed their noble selves. Might their
shadows, he said, never grow less!
Might they always remain bluff de-
fenders of the faith! (Applause.)
Mr. WILLIAM TOOGOOD, the re-
spected auctioneer of Worcester,
responded in a humorous speech.
As for himself, he said in the
course of his remarks, he would tell
them a curious thing: ho had two
daughters whose names by an odd
coincidence were ELIZABETH and
MARY; but the coincidence stopped
there, for ELIZABETH was married,
and MARY was ancemic. (Roars of
laughter.) In such spirits did the
evening proceed.

D1SCURSIONS.
THE STORY THAT NEVER GOT TOLD.
BOTH wore ladies of some expanse of form, and of
years which, though they could not be termed "ad-
vancing" in the full sense of that word, might yet be
said to have made a certain amount of progress. They
were sitting on the shingly beach next to one another,
with a little space of pebbles interposed so as to preclude
the notion of any long previous friendship. Across this
space they talked. Both were sewing nondescript
articles of children's dress. There were indications that
each was the owner of at least two children, presumably
scattered abroad upon the beach with spades and pails.
Absent husbands might be inferred from their conversa-
tion—men with whose frailties they dealt faithfully,
but for whose masterful qualities of temper and bearing
they sometimes evinced a wondering respect heigh-
tened by pride in the possession of an acknowledged
paragon. One of the ladies wore a Spanish mantilla;
the other was chiefly remarkable for a dark-blue blouse.
When I became aware of them, the mantilla was en-
deavouring in a desultory manner to tell the blouse a
story—seemingly of strong domestic interest, but liable
to frequent interruptions.
The Mantilla. When it struck ten it woke me up
all in a cold shiver, and I knew something was going
to happen. If he 'd meant coming home he ought to
have been there at nine; but his supper
The Blouse. Whose supper?
The Mantilla. Mr. PINCHIN'S supper. It's a funny
thing your name should be PINKER and mine PINCHIN.
The very first time I see you here I said to myself,
"Lor, if that isn't Mrs. NEVILLE. \Vhatever is Mrs.
NEVILLE doing here? She said she was going to Mar-
gate for a fortnight, and she 's come here after all."
But when I looked again I could see it wasn't Mrs.
NEVILLE. Still, it's a queer thing the names should be
so close.
The Blouse. I knew your name before I spoke to you.
The Mantilla. Lor!
The Blouse. Yes; I saw your little boy scratch his
name on the sand at low tide yesterday with his spade.
He did it quite plain.
The Mantilla. Did he, the young rascal? I wonder
wherever those children have got to. (She calls dis-
tractedly.) TOMMY! MELIA!
The Blouse (also calling). HENERY! JANE!
The Mantilla. Oh, there they are, all four of 'em,
rolling in the wet sand. Well, I was telling you about
that night I had with the horrors. Mr. PINCHIN isn't one to
be late for his supper, and he likes it ready for him
when he comes in. You can always get him in a good
temper by having it ready, but if he 's kept waiting half
a minute he lets you know it.
The Blouse. Mr. PINKER 's just such another. You
could wind him round your little finger with a tasty
bit of hashed mutton, but he can't bear pigeon pie.
The Mantilla (resuming the thread of her narrative).
I sat still in my chair for about a minute, and then I
gave myself a shake and I got up to have a look round.
I knew I 'd shut the door when I 'd come into the room,
but there it was wide open, and not a sign of Mr.
PINCHIN. I said to myself, "He 's been in and gone
out again"; but there was his supper just as I put it
on the table. If he 'd come in, he 'd never have gone
out again without taking his food Don't say a
word. Here 's the nigger minstrels again.
The Blouse. Impident fellows, especially that one
with the white eyes. Don't notice them.
[Both the ladies absorb themselves in their sewing as
the three minstrels approach.
A Minstrel. Ha! What do I see? Do my ears
deceive me? They are my long-lost mothers-in-law.
ARAMINTA, listen to the voice of nature. (To his part-
ners) No good 'ere; let 's try that pitch over there.
(They pass on.)
The Mantilla. It 's never any use encouraging them.
The Blouse. Mr. PINKER once blacked his face for a
party and carried on like a mad thing. I thought I
should have died of laughing.
The Mantilla. Mr. PINCHIN'S got no voice to speak of,
but he used to play the concertina on Sundays. (She
again resumes.) Well, that night, when I 'd done look-
hag round, I thought I heard something coughing in
the kitchen. It gave me such a turn I didn't rightly
know where I was. So I went to pick up the poker
(She breaks off.) Oh, do look at the children. MELIA'S
got knocked over by a wave, and TOMMY 's fallen atop
of her. I must fetch them.
[She proceeds to do so. The Blouse also collects her
tribe, and the two parties leave the beach separately.
MEMORIES.
Now 's the time when the August weather
Makes a magic to haunt my desk,
Coveys calling across the heather,
Salmon running the winding Esk,
Wind and sunshine that tan to leather
Features sunburnt and picturesque!
Now 's the time when Memory bridges
The locusts' years and their woeful track,
Bringing the dajs when we faced the ridge..
Light of footstep and lithe of back,
Where the versatile Highland midges
Lapped the blood of the Sassenach.
Days of boyhood that sought to jeopard
Uncle JOHN of the pompous strut;
(I '11 admit he was slightly peppered,
But deny that the skin was cut,
Though he roared like a wounded leopard
Writhing about in the left-hand butt!)
As the bees o'er the meadows hover,
Storing their sweets for Autumn's chill,
So I also from Memory's clover
Take the visions her blooms distil;
They will stay when our last drive 's over,
Pipes are lit, and we 've turned down-hill.
Down the hill, for the mists are crawling •
Up the conies in ghostly wrack;
Down the hill, for the dusk is falling,
Lodge-lights gleam where the pines mass black,
And the grouse on the tops are calling
Faintly, mockingly, "Back—go back!"
"Recently, taking a short cut along moorland ground, I observed
a white thistle: not of the species of the national symbol, but of
the English or donkey kind. On a hasty examination it did not
appear to be injured in any way."--2Y(e Scotsman.
This seems to be a very hardy plant.

"CARETAKER WITHIN."
CHI DU C(EUB.
UNTIL I lost him I never knew
how precious ho was to me; I never
realised how much he was a very
part of myself until he was gone,
and his place knew him no more.
His brothers, who were standing
one on each side of him when I saw
him last, are here still, but he—he
is gone; I shall never see him again.
Was I hard on him? Was I un-
feeling? Was I heartless, callous?
Now that he is mine no longer, I
heap a thousand reproaches on my-
self. With a little care, a little
tenderness I might have kept him.
And now His absence leaves a
blank which I am unable to fill.
In time, maybe, some other will
take his place; but in the first bitter
wrench of parting, the gaping void
stares uncompromisingly at me; and
do what I will, I cannot escape from
the consciousness of it.
The world must surely see it, too.
Were I some great magician, I might
perhaps hope to hide it from prying
eyes, but I am only a very human
woman in the throes of a very
human trouble; and things like this
are hard to conceal.
With arrogance and a Pharisaical
feeling of thankfulness that I was
not as they, I have often in the past
regarded those who were undergoing
what I am suffering now. I held
myself superior, deeming that no
such thing could ever touch me.
Yet my day, too, has come; and I
shuffle shrinkingly aside at the ap-
proach of any of my former com-
panions, hoping (but instinct tells
me, hoping vainly) that they will see
nothing amiss. We women have
sharp eyes to discern the short-
comings of our sisters.
Why did I never properly appre-
ciate him? I torture myself with
the question.
True, in station he was far below
me, and in appearance unattractive;
in figure ho was round, in complexion
dark, and often, it must be con-
fessed, shiny; but his silent devotion
to my service, the laying of his whole
heart and soul and the work of his
lifetime at my feet, ought to have
counteracted such disadvantages.
And each day he seemed to grow
less gauche, as if some of the polish
of the world to which he had been
raised had by continual contact com-
municated itself to him.
Yet day after day I tore at the
very root of his being with a hook
crueller than that of the fisherman.
And through it all he uttered no
word of reproach.
I treated his devotion as a matter
of course; and though we took long
walks together, and spent many,
many hours in each other's com-
pany, I never learnt to prize him at
his true worth—until it was too late.
And now Fate has flung him from
me—has sent him where I shall
never find him, and I can never hope.;
to see him again.
He was the second button on one
of my Sunday boots.

SIR,—The danger to automobilists

is a crying scandal which has long
called shrilly for legislation. But an
even more serious peril to swift
drivers comes from the indis-
criminate use of our high roads by
foot-passengers, and some such
scheme of regulations as the follow-
ing is earnestly recommended: —
1. No pedestrian shall be per-
mitted to cross a road or street with-
out winding a coach-horn, blowing a
few notes on a trombone, or beating
a dinner-gong to signalise his inten-
tion.
2. At night, red lamps must be car-
ried fore and aft, and fog-signals
attached to the boots.
3. Every pedestrian must wear a
printed placard with full name and
address on his or her hat, coat-tails,
bonnet or what-not, for purposes of
identification.
4. Any perambulist wilfully ob-
structing motor-traffic by impinging
upon a car, or inserting himself
between the wheels or in the gear
thereof, shall be liable to a fine of
5 guineas, over and above the cost of
repairs, removal of debris, or damage
sustained by loss of time or nervous
shock to the chauffeur.
5. To obviate the risk of punctured
tyres, no male in spiked shoes,
female with hatpins, or person of
either sex with acutely pointed fea-
tures shall be allowed to cross the
road under any pretext whatsoever.

was coining. But that merely shows that, when I do
foresee trouble, that trouble must be something very
serious indeed. And I foresee it now. Probably you
read the other day in your Daily Mail an announcement
to the effect that Captain S. MUSGRAYE, who was in
charge of Lord ROBKRTS'S armoured train during the
Boer War, had returned to England, after a twenty-
months' trip through Colombia, and had brought home
a live ant-eater. There is nothing of course at all
alarming about that—unless you happen to be- fond of
ants, which I am not. But did you read on? Because,
if so, you will remember that it continued as follows:
"Captain MUSGUAVE had, he said, discovered a speci-
men of o carnivorous plant, which had a brain, digestive
organs, and a nervous system, like a human being."
It may not have occurred to you that there was any-
thing particularly ominous in such a discovery—but
possibly you did not give yourself time to think out all
that it portended. I did—and I confess the prospect
fills me with the gravest concern for the future. You
see, in all probability Captain MUSGRAVE has not only
discovered, but actually imported one or two, if not
several, of these botanical monstrosities.
They arc here—in our midst. They are not only
carnivorous, but they possess a brain "like a human
being's" (I think the possessive must have been in-
tended). The precise degree of intellectual capacity is
not stated, .but I should put it myself at considerably
above the average. Because, while their digestive
organs and nervous system (on which the vigour of the
brain so largely depends) are also-.human, they will not,
thanks to the healthy open-air life which plants lead in
their natural state, have become shattered or enervated
by a decadent civilisation. These plants live plainly
and think highly. The chops or cutlets with which
Captain MUSGUAVE may seek to appease their car-
nivorous propensities will but serve to stimulate their
reflective faculties. They will observe what is going on
in this strange land to which they have been trans-
planted—they will draw their own conclusions. What
ian any plant with a human brain and nervous system
think or feel when it once realises the kind of existence
which countless millions of its fellow-vegetables are
condemned to lead by the Tyrant Man? When it hears,
for instance, of Hop vines treacherously encouraged to
climb poles for no other purpose than to be more con-
veniently picked in order to be dried in the neighbouring
oast, and brewed as a human beverage; of roots and
L-rops nourished by rich manure only to serve as fitter
food for Mankind? What will be its opinion of Covent
Cinrdt'ii—or of the Vegetarian Movement?
Inevitably these plants, with their marvellous human
brains, will seek some means of rescuing their oppressed
follows, of organising them in self-defence. It may be
less difficult to do so than you imagine. Men of Science
now admit that all members of the vegetable creation
possess intelligence—not, perhaps, -of a very high order
as yet. It will probably be a considerable time before
the ablest Mangold-wurzel attains the mental level of
the ordinary Man in the Street. But the mind is there,
however dormant, if only it can be awakened and de-
veloped. That ia the problem these Colombian strangers
will have to grapple with—and they will solve it. How
I don't pretend to say. They will manage to get into
touch with them somehow, possibly by thought trans-
ference, and the process of education will be carried on
slowly, secretly, but surely.
You will know nothing about it; probably even Captain
MUSGRAVE himself will never suspect that the plants,
seemingly so acclimatised, so placidly content in their
pots or tubs, are really engaged in stealthily propagating
the seeds of discontent and rebellion.
Even when one day you are surprised for the moment
by reading that an open scholarship at a minor college
in one of the Universities has been carried off by a
precocious Pumpkin educated "under private tuition,"
you will soon realise that there is nothing so very
extraordinary in the circumstance. A "leaderette"
in the same journal will be devoted to it, commenting
on the remarkable manner in which vegetables have
been coming forward of late, and pointing out that the
young student's success affords a gratifying instance of
the opportunities afforded, even to the humblest, by our
revised educational system.
Later on, perhaps, you may be startled by the head-
lines, "Unrest Among the Potatoes. Military Called
Out." But when you have ascertained that the dis-
turbance took place in Ireland, you will think no more
of it. Even should you read of a "Rising of the
Swedes" and "Appalling Slaughter of Sheep," your
equanimity will not be disturbed for long; you will con-
clude that the sheep must have behaved with regrettable
want of tact, and turn to the latest cricket or football
results.
Not till you hear that Mr. EUSTACE MILES'S
Restaurant has been wrecked by an excited mob of
Turnips, Carrots, Cucumbers, and Parsnips, which re-
fused to disperse after the Riot Act was read, and
hurled themselves at the Life Guards with such fury
and determination as to knock them off their horses—
not till then will you begin to suspect that the Vegetable
Orders have become a force to be reckoned with.
Though, of course, following the lead of your daily
papers, you will still treat the demand for "Votes for
Vegetables " with ridicule. You will refuse to recognise
that Beetroots, Lettuces, and Onions have reached a
stage of progress at which they decline any longer to
be butchered to make a British salad; that a Cauli-
flower has a head to think with, a Cabbage a heart to
feel with—even as you.
But you will assuredly be alarmed by the discovery
that their Colombian leaders have impregnated them with
their own- carnivorous practices. I have no wish to be
unduly pessimistic—it is quite probable that the most
voracious vegetable will not venture to attack human
beings, but rather confine itself to depredations on
domestic animals—at all events, for a considerable time
to come. Though that would be quite unpleasant
enough.
Even a Labour Cabinet will find itself compelled to
adopt some repressive measures. But a universal strike
of cereals, and a demonstration in Hyde Park by a
mass of turbulent Gourds and Scarlet-runners, which
will overflow into the streets and force their way by
the windows into the House of Commons itself, will
suffice to bring the Government to its knees. Universal
Vegetable Suffrage will be reluctantly conceded. And
the fate of the Empire will lie at the mercy of a bare
majority, composed perhaps of half-educated and wholly
irresponsible Radishes, incapable of seeing beyond their
native beds!
You may think this exaggerated—fantastic, even.

owe her downfall to an equally fatuous'confidence, in

About two-pennyworth, I should think, would be

Will not Captain MUSGRAVK be induced by this solemn
warning to nip these dangers while they are still in the
bud? I believe the nation would willingly recoup the
expense. Even the most thoroughgoing advocate of
economy in the estimates for our country's defence

[AUGUST 19, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SEA.
[Cut tliia out and give it to your little one at
the seaside. If you have no little one, wrap the
sandwiches up in it.]
A VERY small friend of mine, whose
parents had never taken her out of
London, once said to her sister:
"Thiththie, when you go to the thea-
thide, do you thee the thea?"
What reply her sister made I cannot
say for certain, but the correct
answer would have been " Yeth." It
is because the answer is "Yeth"
that I propose to tell
you all I know about
the sea.
The first thing you will
notice about the sea is
that there doesn't seem
to be so much of itonthe
second day as there was
on the first. If Miss
PKIXGLE hadn't gone
away for the holidays
she would have told you
that this was due to
evaporation, and she
would have been quite
wrong, as usual. The
truth is that there is
just as much sea as
before, only it is now in
a different place. The
less sea we have in
England the more they
have in France. My
own private opinion is
that it is also more
humped up in the
middle than it was
yesterday, but I may
be wrong. Anyhow, I
don't think I shall bathe
this morning.
Now you will want to
know why the sea
moves about in this
way. Why couldn't it
always stay right up
on one side and right
down on the other? The
answer is, Because it
know, it says, "Try Beauchamp's
Pills"; and on the French side,
"Try the pills of Milor Beauchamp,
if you please"; it adds "if you
please" because the French are
always so polite.
Now I have to tell you a very sad
thing about the sea. Like you and
me—I mean like some, lazy people—
it gets up later and later for break-
fast each morning. By the end of a
month it is a whole day late. Just
think how angry Miss PRINGLE would
be if that happened to you! A man

"On, SIR JAMES, I HEAR YOU DATS AN ACFTVLENE PLANT, AND i SIUPI.Y
ADOSB TROPICAL FLOWERS!"
wouldn't get enough to eat. The
sea lives on paper bags, orange peel,
spades and ginger-beer bottles; and
if you are a kind-hearted child and
love dumb creatures you will leave out
at least one ginger-beer bottle a day.
It comes up every morning to fetch
them, and when it has collected all
it can it hurries over to France to see
what the French children have been
putting down for it. Generally they
have been putting down the French
for ginger-beer bottles too.
By the way, I was not quite right
when I called the sea a dumb
creature. On this side, as you all
called KIPLING has calculated that we
have fed the sea for a thousand
years; so that, if it was really in time
for breakfast on the first day, it is
now twelve thousand days behind.
Fancy—more than twenty-three years
late for breakfast! This is so very
confusing that most scientists have
agreed to say nothing, about it. The
others put it on to the moon, which
is a long way away and doesn't
mind.
When you have got down to the
sea the first thing to do is to see that
Nurse has the new number of Home
Gossip. That will keep her good for
two hours at least; by the end of that
time you will want her again because
she has the sandwiches. Some chil-
dren dig a big hole in the sand and
hide her in that, so that she can't
see what is going on; but this isn't
really necessary so long as the serial
story is an exciting one. I daresay
you have often wondered why the
serial in Home Gossip ends so
abruptly every week. It is because
the Editor suddenly realises that the
sea is coming up and surrounding
Nurse; so he has to stop just as the
Earl is showing Veronica
his watch. If the story
were to go straight on
there would be no
nurses left on our coasts
at all! Of course in a
way that would be
rather jolly, but in other
ways it would be, a pity.
Even as it is, you may-
have noticed that just
underneath the "To be
continued" there is a
little paragraph called
"What to do with Wet
Feet." The Editor has
put that in on purpose.
I think the simplest
thing is to dry them on
somebody else's pocket-
handkerchief.
Now you are on the
sands you will probably
want to build a castle.
Those silly WILBRAHAM
children over there
think that all you have
to do is to pile up a
great mound of sand
and put a flag on the
top. That isn't my
idea of a castle at all.
To take two points only
—there is no lift and no
bath-room. Perhaps the
lift i-s a little difficult
to do; but without a
bath-room no modern
castle is complete. You
build this right in the very front,
facing the sea, and when the tide
is nearly up you all stand on
the castle walls together. Then you
say to TOMMY, "It 's eight o'clock.
Sir," and TOMMY says, " Thank you,"
in a very sleepy voice, and he rolls
over and adds, "The jersey and the
red bathing drawers this morning,
BENHAM, I think."
'Yessir," you say; "and would
you like a hot or cold bath, sir?"
If he says "Hot," you smack his
head and begin all over again witli
WILFRID—which is a pity, because
WILFRID is really too small to under-

stand. But if TOMMY is a true sports-
man he says:
"Cold, please; and briny, because
of my rheumatism."
And then the tide comes up; and
for one glorious moment there is The
Castle bathroom in working order . . .
and there are the WILBRAHAM kids still
pottering about on their rotten sand-
heap. The next moment Nurse has
finished her story and collared you
all; and you sit down to lunch a little
higher up the beach.
But I am afraid it happens some-
times that there is no sand on the
beach, only pebbles. I can't quite
explain why this is so. Scientists
say it is the fault of the sea for
not grinding the pebbles up small
enough; but it 's really the fault of
your parents for not choosing a more
sensible place. Still, as they arc here
now, and have probably broken the
best teapot already, you 've got to
stay and make the most of it. The
jolliest game is with father's walking-
stick. You shove it into the beach
and throw pebbles at it. If you hit
the silver band it counts two, and if
you hit TOMMY it 's his own fault for
standing behind you when you were
drawing your hand back. An even
better game is with father's panama:
you put it a few yards awny and
drop big stones into it. If you fill it
with water first you get the splash,
which is jolly
Yes, ETHKL, I was just coming to
that. It is a curious fact, which has
puzzled many scientists, that with
an uncle's panama you don't get the
splash properly at all. . . . Besides,
I 'm just going off to bathe.

THE MOTOR AS INSECTICIDE.
A WRITER in a German paper
(quoted by The Motor Cycle) says
that every caterpillar and slug has
disappeared from his garden since he
allowed his boy to ride a motor-
bicycle round its walks. He is
convinced that the exhaust fumes
from the engine acted as a cater-
pillar destroyer, and he has never
seen his garden with such a show of
fruit and llovvers.
Here is more work for the Royal
Automobile Club, with their sporting
system of holding examinations,
every Wednesday morning, of
motor-car owners and prospective
chauffeurs in driving and technical
proficiency. A Horticultural (or
Autocultural) Certificate should now
be granted to the purveyor of suffi-
ciently noisome exhalations, and this
would go far to endear motorists to

will be promptly invited to "come
inside" where the break - down
occurs, and back-fire a bit among
the begonias or distribute a distillate
of crude petroleum over the mangohl-
wurzels, in view of the approaching
autumn shows. Great and deserved
indeed will bo the popularity of the
novice who shall steer his "stink-

A class of beginners should be
promptly started, with every en-
couragement from the L.C.C. or the

Hyde Park and Kew Gardens. We
feel sure that the increased floral
output would soon move the flower-
girls of Piccadilly to call the scorcher
blessed, and the duly-certificated
"road-hog" will earn the market-
gardeners' undying gratitude. This
larvicidal discovery has just come in
time to stop the unreasoning outcry
against the real (if over-rapid) friends
of the country-side.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Mr. Punch has received for review a book purporting
to be Mr. HUBERT WALES' " new " novel, entitled The Old
Allegiance (JoiiN LONG). This work, however the author
and publisher may endeavour to conceal the fact, is
merely a reprint of a novel entitled In Royal Purple,
by WILLIAM PIGOTT, published in 1899 by Messrs.
CASSELL. Mr. Punch is not interested in the task of
examining the merits or demerits of rechauffe fiction.
He is, however, concerned to remark that publishers
and authors probably lose nothing in the long run by
being straightforward and candid.
It would be a kindly thought to describe Mr. E. F.
BENSON'S latest production, The Blotting-Book (HEINE-
MANN), as a half-crown parody of the shilling shocker.
But honesty compels me to
accuse him of having written
it as a serious experiment in
melodrama, if the phrase may
be used of a story so common-
place in style and so slipshod
in construction. The evidence
in a murder-trial turns on the
question of the date of an im-
pression in a new blottiug-
book, but Mr. BENSON ha? not
taken the trouble tc get his
dates right. Thus the threaten-
ing letter which is accepted as
evidence against the prisoner
is dated June 21st, while at
the same time it is proved to
the satisfaction of the court
that not till June 22nd did the
facts which alone could furnish
the motive for this letter come
to the prisoner's knowledge at
all. This is a typical instance
of the carelessness with which
Mr. BENSON handles the
threads of his plot. As for
the literary quality of his
book, it scarcely ever rises to any distinction, and
occasionally lapses into the best manner of the half-
penny evening fcuilleton. Here is a gem:—"He
had but to be able to exercise his option at that
price to be quit of that dreadful incubus of anxiety
which for the last two years had been a mill-stone
round his neck that had grown mushroom like."
And here is another jewel:—"Mr. Godfrey Mills had
wantonly slandered him to Sir Kichard Templeton, a
marriage with the daughter of whom was projected in
the prisoner's mind, whicli there ivas reason to suppose,
might have taken place." The italics are my own, but
everything else, including the punctuation, is Mr.
BENSON'S. The author is presumably satisfied with this
kind of stuff, or he would not have published it; but
it is extraordinarily unsatisfactory for the people who
buy his new book on the strength of its author's estab-
lished reputation.
The British public is frequently credited, rightly
or not, with no very great amount of intelligence, but I
think that Mr. J. E. PATTERSON has altogether too low
an opinion of it. Throughout his book Fishers of the

Mr. Townley (irlio lias just agreed to take a country
cottage). "OF oocnsE YOU 'LL HAVE THOSE TREES STRAIGHTENED
UP A BIT? THEY'VE GOT HORRIBLY WARPED!"
Sea (MURRAY) he seems to be obsessed with a fear that
his readers will fail to take his points, and he is for
ever explaining himself in parentheses. Quite often he
employs these when he is net in the least degree
ambiguous, and forgets all about them when he is.
Examples are singly too trivial to quote, but, taken
together, such signs of a lack of skill in the telling of a
story generate a sense of irritation that tends to spoil
one's satisfaction at the author's intimate knowledge of
fisher-folk in the North Sea. I am rather sorry for this,
because it 's a fascinating subject.
David Lepstcin was a waif of the New York Ghetto,
and his intimate friends called him Dovid'l—for short,
I suppose. When he left school a kind of Judgment of
Paris was put before him, the choice between Learning.
Art, and Riches, and selecting the last of these, he
became in a marvellously short time what I believe is
called a lumber-king. That, briefly, is the story of
Dominy's Dollars, by Mr. B.
PAUL NEUMAN (MURRAY), a
very remarkable book. The
moral, of course, is Uiat
Money, considered as a
goddess, is no better than
she should be; but there is
nothing of the cheaply »nelo-
dramatic about Mr. NEUMAN'S
presentation of this common-
place. For Dominy (that was
David's adopted name) was a
very likeable young man, with
all kinds of good qualities, and
it is only very gradually that
ho becomes so ravenous with
the gold-hunger as to ruin a
nature that we feel compelled
to admire. The second crisis
in David's life comes when he
is asked to renounce his whole
career by Sadie Walder, &
compatriot and prima donna
(what a lot of these divas
there are!), who has entered
the Romish Church. After his
refusal to do this, in spite
of his love for her, there is a slackening of interest,
for the end is inevitable; but the progress of the
hero's obsession is traced with a wonderfully fine and
certain touch, and Mr. NEUMAN is to be heartily congratu-
lated on the study.
TO THE OLDEST INHABITANT.
UNDER what weight of years you have to bend
I do not know; your name I did not catch,
Nor from your toothless converse could I snatch
One word from the beginning to the end.
But yet what brightness to the beach you lend,
Your nether garments gleam with many a patch
Of alien stuff which never claimed to match
The parent fabric it aspired to mend.
I 've read of you in fiction, now in fact
It is my privilege to get a glimpse
Of that reality my visions lacked,
And to behold your figure as it limps
Down to the sea from which you still extract
Unwilling, coy, yet marketable shrimps.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE UNGATHERED BIRD.
ALL day you tramped, on bloody business bent,
Knee-deep in heather, middle-deep in fern;
All day your weary perspiration went
To feed the local burn.
Far up the flanking hills from time to time
The keeper drew your notice to a " point,"
And thither you would dolorously climb,
Creaking in every joint;
And, having ultimately scaled the sky,
Stand puffing till the pointer (humorous dog)
Confessed that he had been deluded by
A latent lark, or frog;
Said " My mistake, Sir "; eased his rigid tail;
And, ranging wide without a sign of stitch,
Put up a covey well across the vale
On to the nest-door pitch.
And if, for once, he gave a true alarm,
And made a guide-post of his quivering nose,
Your spray of pellets did no deadlier harm
Than water from a hose.
During the luncheon-interval they told
The heavy tale of corpses, two by two;
But there was not a single ghost that rolled
Accusing eyes at you.
The thought encouraged so profound a pique
That not the cherry-whisky's luscious fume,
Nor many midges browsing on your cheek
Could chase your settled gloom. i
It lingered through that lamentable day.
Round you the air still rang with chortling cries
Uttered by scaihless birds that chose this way
To vent their glad surprise.
And here and there some old and seasoned cock
Turned in his flight to throw a backward glance,
Anxious to see what you were like—the crock
That missed so soft a chance.
At length, as evening's shade began to fall,
The whole of Inverness-shire might have heard,
Clear as a thunderclap, your shattering call: —
"MARK DOWN THAT WOUNDED BIRD!"
No one but you so much as saw him flinch.
We searched in vain; while you protested still
That surely somewhere, dying inch by inch,
He cursed your fatal skill.
It 's my belief the bird 's alive and fit;
Yet, if you like to think he really dropped,
Why then, to save your feelings, I ']! admit
The theory you adopt—
That, dead within some moist and hollow " hag,"
Beyond the power of dogs or men to trace,
Lies, unembodied in the general bag,
Your lonely half-a-brace. O. S.
"The Cologne Accident Insurance Company has decided to grant
insurance policies to those who take part in aerial journeys in balloons.
The insurance commences on the persons entering the balloon-basket
nr car, and will cease as soon as the insured have left the basket or
:ar."—The Financier.
Unfortunately that is often just the moment when the
insurance is really needed.
"RABBITS."
WHAT thoughts that simple word conjures up! Rab-
bits! To this one it suggests the old home-field where
the bunnies used to play, where the little brooklet in the
left-hand bottom corner used to be, now trickling down
to join the main stream, now stopping to ask the way
of a kindly yokel. To that one it suggests the gun; the
rustle as the furry fellow trots from his hole; the bang
of two barrels; and another rustle as the furry fellow
trots into another hole. To a third it suggests a steam-
ing dish with too much pepper and not enough salt. This
one and that one and the other one are all wrong, for
"Rabbits " is a game.
Mr. " Z.," a gentleman who has his own private page
in one of our great illustrated monthlies, told me all
about it. "If," he said, "you are at a party and find
that the company needs enlivening, the following little
catch is bound to prove amusing. You wait till the con-
versation turns upon rabbits " (as, I take it, it is bound
to do^sooner or later), "and seizing your opportunity
you ask casually if anyone would care for a game of
'Rabbits.'" He then tells you how to proceed. I cut
this part out, sold the rest of the magazine to my cousin
(he not knowing that it was the rest), and waited my
opportunity.
Not only am I an amateur humourist, but I am also
such an expert cyclist as to justify my being asked to a
bicycle picnic. It was at one of these great social
events that my opportunity arrived. It had been driz-
zling all the afternoon, there had been five punctures
and a collision, and the best part of the tea had lost its
way. I thought well to cheer and amuse the party
according to Mr. "Z.'s " prescription.
At the outset there was a curious lack of enthusiasm.
The ladies were only prevailed upon to play by the
natural politeness and curiosity of the sex; the children
joined in the fun under duress; and of all the men, one
only was willing, and he merely because he had thought
I said " Bridge." A man, even if a major, who thinks
you said "Bridge" when you really said "Rabbits,"
ought to have his bicycle taken away from him.
I am not the one to let little things stand in my way,
and soon had the company upon its knees in a circle,
round which (for reasons not at once apparent to the
lay mind) the question is passed: "Do you know how
to play ' Rabbits '?" I explained that all one had to
do was to answer the question and ask one's neighbour.
I begged them, in the words of BURKE, "to admire
where they could not presently understand," and ex-
plained again. I should have explained a third time
had it not been for the Major. I then started the ball
rolling and put the question to my neighbour. "No,"
she said. "Then ask your neighbour," I said. "Why?"
she asked. "You '11 know in a moment," I told her.
and she asked him. "No," he said. "Then ask your
neighbour," I said. "Why?" he asked. "You'll
know in a moment," I told him, and he asked her.
"No," she said. "Then ask your neighbour," I said.
"Why? " she asked. "You '11 know in a moment," I
told her, and she asked him.
Eventually I got as far as the Major, the last but one
of the circle. He said, "I have had enough of this
damned folly," and got up and walked away. "What
a silly man the Major is! "I said. "It is not the Major
who is silly," the chorus replied. "We think "I
told them to let that pass and go on with the game.
"Do you know how to play ' Rabbits '? " someone said
to Mrs. WALKER. "No," said Mrs. WALKER, " and •"

FASHION FAVOURS THE FRAIL.
Bored Sportsman (tolas brotlier-i n-la w and boat). "I SUPPOSE TOD KNOW THIS 'WiUUNO-TJP' BUSINESS HAS GONE CLEAN OUT? You CAN
TAKE IT FROM ME, THE DEST PEOPLE SIMPLY DO.V'r DO IT."
"Reserve your defence," I said hurriedly, "and ask
me." "Why? " asked Mrs. WALKKR. "You '11 see in a
moment," I told her, and she asked me, as one humours
a restless child: "Do i/ou know how to play 'Rab-
bits '?" "No," I said slowly, relying more upon Mr.
"Z.'s" dicta than upon my own observations for my
denouement, "so I am afraid we shall not be able to
play."
Now Mr. "Z." had led me to suppose that this was
a moment when manly guffaws and girlish laughter rent
the air. I had gathered that at this point the suggester
of the game was patted upon the back for a merry fellow
with a pretty wit and carried shoulder high by the
laughing throng. Picture to yourself, rather, a funereal
crowd kneeling upon the damp grass in a ridiculous circle
and regarding me more in anger than in sorrow amid the
most silent silence conceivable. What appeared to be a
joke to Mr. " Z." turned out, in fact, to be the saddest
and most tragic effect ever conceived by the mind of
man. Realising this I left them to their wrath, and
crept away in shame to the bicycles. There, choosing
a new one with three good speeds and a little oil bath, 1
rode away lonely and depressed into the outer darkness.
********
I am a broken man now and a social pariah, but I
still have one hope left. It is that I shall in the latter
days meet Mr. "Z" face to face. I shall come very
close to him and look him straight in the eye, and then,
without seeing his hand or feeling the bumps of his
head, shall tell him his character with a candour and a
thoroughness which will take his last breath away.
Answer to Correspondent.
"ANXIOUS ONE."—Our attention has already been
called to Mr. HAROLD SPENDER'S utterances on the mis-
sion of himself and Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE (" our mission
to Germany," as he is reported to have described it to
a Daily Mail correspondent); and we agree with you that
it would not be advisable to disband our Navy until wo
have the mission's guarantee that such action would bo
approved in Germany as likely to strengthen the idea of
friendly relations between the two countries.
In M.A.P. Mr. HALL CAINE describes Mr. WILKIE
COLLINS' forehead as one that "belonged to Collins
alone." So different from Mr. CAINE'S own forehead,
which we have come to regard as the property of the
nation.
"The gardens are well supplied with seats, and there are umbra-
geous walks in various directions, where the old, but never new,
tale is told."—Liverpool Echo.
That 's the worst of chestnuts: they 're never really fresh.
It is proposed to hold a conference, when the London
borough councils resume their meetings, to discuss the
question of the damage done to lamp-posts by motor
vehicles in the streets of London. Personally, we hope
it will be possible to arrive at some sort of compromise
whereby the motor vehicles may knock down as many
lamp-posts as they like if they will leave pedestrians
alone.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
ABOUT FIRE AND WATER.
Broadlands,
August.
DEAREST DAPHN E,—The ST.
ADRIANS' has always been counted a
nice house to stay at, and now they 've
surpassed themselves! Their last
house-party was indeed in luck to
have the week wind up with such a
glorious blaze. You 've read about
it, of course, in the dailies; but you
don't know how simply lovely it was
to be there. My dear, for real fun
and thrills of the first magnitude,
nothing comes up to a fire, so long
as it's at someone else's place, and
you 're young and real, with lots of
pretty, naturally wavy hair. For
then, you know, it's such awful fun
to be saved! Of course, if I were
like some people, I 'd rather be left
to my fate. Not that there was any
leaving people to their fates in this
case. There was no life lost, and not
the least danger of such a thing.
NORTY happened to be staying
there, and he saved my life most
heroically. Then I flew about saving
others, and giving help wherever it
was needed. If you look in The
Sideglancer and West-End Whispers
you will see a full account of it all,
headed, "Heroic Conduct of a Popu-
lar Society Leader. Mrs. MULTIMILL
Saves Many Lives!'' and photos of
me in a sweet Etruscan dressing-
robe, sandals on my bare feet, and
my hair streaming in the wind. In
one I 'm flying along crying, '' Fire!
Fire!" In another I 'm carrying a
jug of water to the hottest part of the
blaze.
BERYL CLARGES is icild that she
didn't happen to be staying there
at the time. Indeed, she 's so set
upon being even with me and dis-
tinguishing herself in a fire, and be-
ing saved and all that, that it really
wouldn't be safe to have her to stay
anywhere just now.
Lord ST. ADRIAN and his six sons
long ago formed themselves into a
fire brigade, and have practised and
drilled till they 're quite perfect. It
was wonderful to see how cool and
skilful they were, and how they fell
into line and all that sort of thing,
and went through quite professiona'
evolutions. But, unfortunately, there
was no water to be had ; and however
cool and skilful and well drilled an
amateur fire-brigade may be, anc
however many evolutions they may
go through with the hose, they can'
do very much without water. Anc
so the whole west wing, with the
jicture-gallery and library, was burnt
jefore help came.
There were some juvenile-antiques
n the party — POPSY, Lady RAMS-
GATE, for one. My dear, the less
said about them the better, when
>rought hurriedly out of danger, quite
au naturcl as to hair and complexion!
t am pretty sure that, when the
Prophet said '' Truest truth is fairest
Deauty," he had never stayed with
a large party in a house where fire
aroke out in the early hours of a
summer's morning, and people ran
out into the grounds in spur-of-the-
moment toilettes.
The men are telling a simply
odious story about dear Professor
DIMSDALE. He was one of those
staying there (it was a particularly
clever party), and, only the evening
Defore the fire, a number of us who
ised to be at his mental philosophy
lecture-chats.last spring were sitting
at his feet while he talked in the
most lovely way, occasionally dash-
ing back with his hand the curls that
will fall over that wondrous philo-
sophic brow. (People can't help
having curly hair, can they? even if
they are profound thinkers.) Among
other memorable things, he told us
never to use "that foolish expres-
sion 'I must believe my senses,'
because our senses were given us ex-
pressly to conceal the truth from
us!" Isn't that a delicious idea?
He told us, too, that, like some old
Greek or Latin, he could say that life
and death were all one to him and
he was perfectly indifferent about
them. And yet NORTY says the Pro-
fessor was one of the first out of the
house after the alarm was given, that
he ran faster than any of them, and
didn't try to save anyone, and that—
oh, it's an abominable libel!—above
that brow that's always occupied
with the Noumenon, and the Macro-
cosm, and the Microcosm, and the
nothingness of everything—there was
a row of curling-pins!
As BERYL hadn't the luck to dis-
tinguish herself at a fire, she 's
turned her attention to the other
element, and, with my help, has
brought off a very good thing.
Clarges Park, you know, is only two
or three miles from Paradeville-on-
Sea, and, the Olympic Games being
still rather in the air, BERYL wrote
to the Mayor or the Town Council or
something to say she was willing to
give a Diving and Swimming Display
off the East Pier for the benefit oi
the local life-boat fund. They thankee
her very much, but said they 'd quite
a new life-boat which had been paid
for—(Pigs !). So BERYL said that
she dared say they could do with a
:ew more, and anyhow she meant to
jive the show, and they could use
;he pier admission money for any-
thing they liked.
As soon as I got wind of it, I
offered my services, for I 've always
;aken an immense interest in life-
Doats. And then heaps of people
wrote and wired and 'phoned to say
they 'd help—some, my dear, who
not only can't dive, but can't swim!
We had to tell them it was to be a
diving not a drowning exhibition.
The pier was a struggling mass at
nalf-a-crown each (you know, my
dearest, how ces autres will always
pay and elbow to see us do anything),
ind it all went with a yell. Oh, my
kittle, darling, ducky diving-dress!
But you '11 see me in it in the pic-
ture-weeklies.
I don't say that BERYL and BABS
didn't dive perhaps the weeniest bit
better than I did, but I "peeled"
best of the three, and was quite the
favourite of the crowd.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
P.S.—When JOSIAH heard about
it, he disapproved in his very best
style. He has put his foot down,
my dear, and that 's flat! He says
if I want to go in for diving
and swimming he '11 have a place
specially made for it here. Here, you
know! The very idea! As if people
wanted to dive and swim in the
depths of the country, with not a
creature near to see them.
NEUROTIC MOTOR-CARS.
EXTRAORDINARY ALLEGATIONS.
THE recent distressing accident to
Mr. HALL CAINE, due to the run-
ning away of his motor-car, though
happily unattended by any serious
consequences to the talented fic-
frionist, has caused a painful impres-
sion in motoring circles, as tending
to create misgivings in the minds of
litterateurs who may have purchased
cars, or may be intending to pur-
chase them. In these circum-
stances the information which a
representative of Mr. Punch has
gleaned from Dr. C. W. SYLLABUB,
F.R.S. (Edin.), will be peculiarly
welcome, as that eminent man of
science is himself an expert motorist
as well as musical and dramatic critic
for sixteen daily and ten weekly
papers.
"Yes," said Dr. SYLLABUB, who
was toying with the metatarsal fin
of an extinct ichneumon when we
found him, "there is no doubt that
motor-cars are extraordinarily sensi-
tive and susceptible machines. You

remember KIPLING'S story of an
animated fugitive locomotive. Well,
the novelist wrote better than he
knew. There is no doubt whatever
that what was merely an ingenious
speculation in the case of the steam
engine is an absolute fact in regard
to the motor.
"Take this accident of Mr. HALL
CAINE. Ho speaks of his nerves
being utterly broken. I don't wonder
at it. You note that he says his
motor-car ran down the drive. Now
I have not the slightest doubt
that this was a case of deliber-
ate evasion on the part of the
machine. The motor-car ran away
of itself. From whom, then, did it
run? The answer is obvious—from
Mr. HALL CAINE. All of us have
experienced the desire, when brought
into the presence of a great or awful
personage, to seek safety or seclu-
sion in flight, and this is clearly what
happened in the present case. The
car, probably a high-mettled neuro-
tic 100-h.p. Mercddes, was so terri-
fied by the proximity of daemonic
genius m goggles that it fled in an
ecstasy of fright down the intermin-
able avenue that winds up to the
stately portals of Greeba Castle.
"But you must not think that
this is an isolated case of what is
professionally known as stampedo-
mania amongst motors. Many
similar cases have come within the
range of my own experience. I had
once a little Baby Peugeot, which
was so nervous that I had actually to
sing it asleep before it would consent
to let me take the wheel. Mr. MAX
PEMHERTON'S great Cronstadt is an
extraordinarily affectionate car. In-
deed, he has told me that an un-
favourable review of one of his
novels will make it cry like a child.
Mr. CLEMENT SHORTER'S car quickens
its pace when he calls it ' Charlotte.'
Mr. J. M. BARRIE drives a PETER
PANHARD, and converses with it in
the Wendish tongue. The SID-LEE
cars are all accomplished SHAK-
SPEAREAN scholars, and when Sir
ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE was writing
The Hound of the Baskervilles one
of his motor bicycles evinced its in-
terest by frequently remarking ' Pup!
pup!'
"Again, there is a famous lady
novelist—I will not mention her by
name, as she is notoriously averse
from any form of publicity — who
owns a very sensitive Itala car. She
was recently reading aloud some of
the most moving scenes in her forth-
coming novel to a few friends when
an agonising cry was heard from her
garage. Her third footman burst

START?"

BAD!"
open the door, and a poignant voice
issued from the exhaust pipe exclaim-
ing that this was really too exhaust-
ing.
"Mrs. ELINOR GLYN,-again, has a
very fast car which exceeds the limit
on the slightest provocation. And
Lord AVEBURY told me the other day
that the only way he could account
for the behaviour of his car was that
it must have a bee in its bonnet.
"Another point. It is impossible
to expect to get satisfactory results
out of a car unless you speak to it
in the language of the country in
which it was manufactured. For my
own part I always make a point of
conversing in the lingua Toscana
when I am driving a F.I.A.T. In a
Spyker I speak French with a Belgian
accent. In an Argyll I talk Gaelic.
If drivers would only show a little
more consideration to these highly
organised creatures, there would be
far fewer accidents. I cannot help
thinking that the accident to Mr.
HALL CAINE'S car was due to his
having inadvertently confused it by
lapsing into his native Manx.
"By the way, I forgot to mention
just now that Mr. TREE'S new
'trolly,' as he humorously calls it,
the Comyns Car, is more than
usually faust."
This remark, we need hardly say,
terminated the interview.

THE MAGIC CARAVAN.
["The caravan of the inventive genius is not very safe to live in.
Everything collapses, and one is surrounded by unsuspected pit-
falls."— The Field.']
SAID I to myself, let care be blowed
Whilst I go wandering free
Afar from trains
Through the long green lanes
That lead to the voiceful sea.
Sing hoy! said I, for the open road
And the open camp beside it 1
Sing ho! for the man
With the caravan—
But that was before I tried it.
I was filled with delight when I first caught sight of
the gipsy-like home that awaited me,
For the paint was as gay as the hedges in May, and the
dimity curtains elated me;
A queer little step upholstered in rep led up to a door in
the centre,
It was open a bit, and the view through the slit made
me feel that I simply must enter.
The fittings inside filled my bosom with pride, for the
brass was as bright as it could be,
And the woodwork was smart with the polisher's art,
and everything just as it should be.
These fittings, again, were a feast for the brain just as
much as the eyes that were daft on 'em,
For they all were designed by a masterly mind who had
lavished the best of his craft on 'em.
What wonderful tricks he had managed to fix! What
ingenious dodges he 'd hit upon
For the saving of space in that rum little place! What
curious things you 'd to sit upon!
You seated yourself on a sort of a shelf, but as soon as
you let yourself down on it
It suffered a change and became a small range with
some sausages bursting and brown on it.
You felt a wild wish for this savoury dish, but before
you had time to lay hand on it
The range disappeared in a manner most weird, and you
were compelled to abandon it.
At first it was fun just to see what was done—the furni-
ture had such agility!
But when everything grew into something quite new
you longed for a little stability.
At a quarter to five the bed came alive; it revolved, and
in less than a minute
'Twas no longer a bed but a sitz bath instead with you
sitting shivering in it.
You looked all about for a cloth or a clout or for any-
thing likely to dry you,
And your frowns disappeared when a towel-horse reared
all covered with towels close by you.
You stretched out to clasp what had seemed in your
grasp, but the moment before you were able
To clutch it you learned that the towels had turned to
a cloth which was spread on the table.
All dripping and wet you sprang out in a pet and looked
for your garments to don 'em,
But the hooks had turned round; they were not to be
found any more than the clothes which were
on 'em.
Through all the day long things would keep going
wrong, through breakfast and luncheon and dinner,
Till my hair became grey and my flesh fell away, and
my figure grew thinnnr and thinner.
At length in despair I resolved to repair to the nearest
hotel I could light on;
I 've sent the van back, and the rest of the vac. my
address is the Metropole, Brighton.
DISCURSIONS.
WHY JIMMIE SopwiTii MAUKIED HER.
WHEN JIMMIE SOPWITII announced his engagement to
Miss ADELAIDE HAUBOTTLF; there was a universal shout of
amazement from all his friends. Certainly, JIMMIE was
of the philandering sort; no man of forty, which was
JIMMIE'S age, had philandered with greater vigour. Still,
he always played for safety, and generally secured it.
Married ladies had a special attraction for him, but he
never went too far or caused a single flutter of agitation
in the breast of any Othello of his acquaintance. He
had an assured income of about £3,000 a year, and his
bachelor parties had acquired a great reputation. With
unmarried girls he had a certain timidity of manner,
but when he knew them well he became fatherly. No
man, indeed, was considered to be more secure against
the attractions of matrimony.
ADELAIDE HARBOTTLE varied in her age. I have known
her to figure as a kitten of 28, and to pass primly in a
single day to the age of 37. In the dim light of a discreet
drawing-room she was young; in the blaze of a Foreign
Ofiice Reception the years came flocking to her as by
magic. As a matter of fact, she was at least as old as
JIMMIE. She was not exactly gaunt, but a strongly-
marked nose of the Wellingtonian order gave her face a
formidable and bony appearance. She was said to be
"a good sort," and though she had, of course, never
openly scratched for the matrimonial stakes, she was
popularly supposed to have dropped out of the running.
She and JIMMIE had been good friends for many years.
This was the lady, then, to whom JIMMIE, that con-
firmed bachelor, not only became engaged, but whom
he married in due course. Nobody has yet been able to
ascertain why it happened, but there is no reason now
why the mystery should not be revealed. JIMMIE, as all
the world knows, disappeared mysteriously two years
ago. His disconsolate relict was last heard of as con-
ducting a search party for him in the remoter wilds of
Patagonia, and, so far as I am aware, there are no
surviving relatives of either side who will be affected in
any way by the disclosure I am about to make. Before
JIMMIE vanished into the inane he posted a letter to me,
and it is from this document that I propose to quote.
"By the time you receive this," it began, "I shall
have disappeared. It will be quite useless to search for
me. All my measures are taken, and the secret of my
whereabouts will never be known. I have made a
proper provision for my wife, who will want for nothing.
We have had four years of married life, and that is quite
enough for either of us. You have been a very good
friend to me, and I don't like to go without telling you
why I got married. In fact, you were the only one of
my friends who never showed the least curiosity on the
point, and you are, therefore, the one man who ought
to know. After two years have passed, you can use
your discretion about telling anyone else.
"I don't want to boro you with a long story, so I '11
tell you at once that the whole business was due to that
detestable invention, the electric light. I always felt
that there was something baleful about its uncompro-
mising glitter, but I little knew what awful catastrophe
it would bring upon me. Some men may say that my
own sentimental weakness helped on the misfortune,

but I disagree with them. Gas or candles or oil would
never have lured me on and lulled me and then crushed
me with the same terrible completeness.
"It happened at Barrowdean, on the Sussex coast, in
a bungalow which JACK TOKRKY, the parson, had taken
for the summer. JACK, as you know, was married to
ADELAIDE'S youngest sister, LUCY, and ADELAIDE was
staying with them. I was asked for a week-end, and,
unconscious of my doom, I accepted. LUCY was a
charming woman, plump and pink and cheerful, for
whom I had always felt an extreme liking; her husband
was a good chap, and ADELAIDE, of course, was an old
shoe for comfort. Friday night and Saturday passed
off well enough. Sunday was to be the fatal day.
"On Sunday evening we had cold supper to save the
servants trouble, and two friends of JACK came in and
shared it with us. We were, therefore, a party of six.
Now, there was only one thing peculiar to this infernal
bungalow. It was fitted with electric light, which
worked on a shilling-in-the-slot arrangement. It ran all
right for a certain time, and then, unless you popped a
shilling into a kind of iron money-box and turned a
handle, it went out. I don't know when the last
shilling had been put in, but on this particular Sunday
evening the machine had apparently arrived at its last
half penny-worth.
"The dinner began all right. I had LUCY (who
looked bewitching in light blue) on my left, and
ADELAIDE, who was silent and distraite, on my right.
JACK said grace in his best form, and we had just had
cold soup out of tea-cups when, without a word of
warning, the blessed light went out. 'I '11 put that right
in .a jiffy,' said JACK. 'Has anybody got a shilling?'
Nobody had. There was a plethora of half-crowns,
florins, and sixpences, but there wasn't a single shilling
in the room. 'No matter,' said JACK, 'I know there 's
one on the mantelpiece in my bedroom,' and he
stumbled out of the room to find it.
"Now darkness always hud a curious effect upon me.
I can't describe it better than by saying that it made me
both affectionate and absent-minded. LUCY and I were
old friends. Why shouldn't I give her a mark of my
paternal devotion'.' I decided that there would be no
harm in kissing her hand. I groped along the table for
it, found it, grasped it (it made no resistance) and
carried it to my lips. At this moment the shilling must
have dropped into its receptacle, for the light went up
with a dazzling flash, and I discovered to my horror and
amazement that I had mistaken the side on which
LUCY was sitting. I had let my hand stray to the right
instead of to the left, and there I was with the back of
ADELAIDE'S hand planted on my mouth!
"' Congratulate us, LUCY,' said ADELAIDE with a
fiendish readiness, 'we have been engaged for a month,
and we 're to be married before the end of the year.' At
this moment JACK came back, and insisted, in spite of
Sunday, on drinking our healths :—' JIMMIE, my boy,' he
said, 'you 've got a jewel, but I can't say you don't
deserve her.' I sat like a dumb fool, and never said a
word, and in three months ADELAIDE married me."

THE FELLOW-PASSENGER.
WHEN, about nightfall, the train
stopped at the end of the branch,
nearly all the travellers made for the
lumbering omnibus that links up the
railway with Brinehaven six miles fur-
ther on. The rush had evidently been
anticipated, for the omnibus had
brought with it an ancient victoria
capable of taking the overflow to the
extent of two passengers. A young
man of meek appearance and a large
gladstone bag already occupied much
of the interior of "the latter vehicle.
I hurried to take possession of the
remainder.
"I hope," I said, after apologising
for placing rny luggage on the top of
his, "that there will be room in the
hotel." Nothing depresses me so
much as the prospect of wandering
stranded and homeless about a
strange place, like a common player
on a Sunday afternoon. It is not
Sybaritism; it is merely the unfortu-
nate result of a respectable bringing-
up.
"I don't know," said the young
man callously.
"I understand there is only one
hotel," I went on. "It would be
very awkward to be turned away—
six miles from anywhere."
"Not at all nice," he observed
without showing the slightest con-
cern.
The young man was clearly either
a disreputable Bohemian—perchance
a hardened sleeper-out — or was
brutally indifferent to the anxieties
of his fellow-creatures.
"You have a bed to go to, per-
haps?" I ventured with some acer-
bity.
"I am going to the hotel," he
said.
"But you said you didn't know.
Ah, you have written for a room!
Wise man!"
"No, I can't say I did that,"
he answered, looking away at the last
remnants of the sunset.
"Then they know you — you've
been here before," I said.
"Oh no — never," he replied
quietly.
Nothing annoys me so much as to
find people sanguine and cheerful in
a situation that fills me with qualms
and misgiving. And so I did not
speak to the young man again during
the whole of the six miles' drive.
What struck me as rather remarkable
was that he made no attempt to
speak to me—not, indeed, until the
next morning, when I had taken a
seat in the coffee-room for breakfast.
Then he said, " Tea or coffee, Sir?"
Homespun.
OUR leading journals and maga-
zines are being compelled to adapt
themselves to modern requirements
in the way of " home " interest, and
we are therefore looking forward to
the new combination entitled The
Spectator and Girls' Home Journal,
with its " Chats with the Chicks, by
UNCLE JOE"; and to a symposium
about to appear in The Nineteenth
Century and Afternoon Tea on the

FEEDING WITH FISHERS.
READING his work, I cannot sur-
mise Mr. ISAAC WALTON (who is now
some time deceased, poor chap !) was
a very miserable person at all, but I
am sure ho is not so jolly as a club of
angling gentlemen with which I have
recently taken some food. This
fishers' society is entitled The Chelsea
Park and Sands End Piscatorial
Club.
Strangely, for chaps so connected
with aqua pura, their place of tryst
is a public-house called the Blue
Boar. I perceived from summit of
an omnibus next day from the strange
device on its facade that the blue
boar is a species of extinct pig of a
dark Cambridge boat-race hue.
Having performed the deglutition
of a split-soda-mineral, I followed my
consort aloft, coming to roost in a
large room in most festal array. On
all bounds were tables dressed in fine
napery of great snowishness, fitted
out with quite the usual number of
forks and other lunching-tools. At
twenty-seven minutes after the ap-
pointed pistol-fire Hon. Chairman
said grace before soup. The lading-
bill I quote, to show you that
fishers are not confined to asceticism

I succeeded in polishing up some of
each, despite a meat lunch in an
A.B.C. store, and was pleased to
note the absence of pedanticry with
which my confederates ate meat.
Here I saw no slavish imitation as to
mcum and tuum between knife and
fork. One fisher certainly asked a
waiter to change his meat knife, pro-
testing that its blade, not wide
enough to act efficiently as a pea-
transporter, was yet so keen an
edged-tool as twice to have made in-
cision in his right cheek or jowl. The
waiter readily obliged him, remarking

VOULEZ-VOUS CUERCHER POUR HOI L'lIOlIME AVEU LE MOT 'CUISINIER' AUTOUR DE LA COURONNE

that the caterer really ought to pro-
vide wooden spoons.
But I forgot. Mister Chairman, a
very waggish gentleman in a robin
redbreast vest-coat with brass but-
tons, rose to his legs, and said:
'' Mister Vice and gentlemen! It is
my pleasant task to propose a hearty
vote of—I mean the health of our
most gracious King, EDWARD THE
SEVENTH."
Each fisher arose as one man, his
glass in hand, nodded to his neigh-
bours, and said " The King," as at a
game of napcards. Then all drank
their tipples off at one bound, while a
concealed player upon the pianoforte
played God Save the King. Each
man sang lustily, I of course joining.
This interlude gave me a blow for the
roasted beef, I am thankful to re-
mark. After the sweetmeats, the
Chairman's opponent, near rny end
of the table, arose upstanding, and
said it was his pleasant allotment to
propose the health and posterity of
the Chelsea Park and Sands End
Piscatorial Club, which he did with
great heartfulness.
Then each gentleman reduced the
restriction of his nether vest-coat
buttons, and most lit large pale-
swarthy cigars. I politely but tena-
ciously refused a cigar, and lit a
virgin cigarette.
"I call upon Mr. R. TERRY for the

first song," said the Chairman.
Whereupon up rose a slim young boy,
with hair of great oleaginity, making
his way nimbly to the most distant
pole of the room, where was a
Grand & Co. pianoforte, denuded of
its bookcase timber.
Mr. TERRY treated us to a rending
of a ballad of some quaintness, early
in which he took us into his confi-
dence concerning the sweetness of a
lady known as Nora, the Bride of
Kill Dare.
Some of the singing was most
agreeable, but I was pleasantly
chilled by the Vice-Chairman an-
nouncing that he would now call upon
the Chairman to present the prizes to
the fishers who had .created the most
remarkable draughts of five thousand.
The Chairman smiled, and com-
menced to say the Club had had a
most successful season. "Hear,
hear," said many. I took the cue,
saw my chunce, and whenever he
paused said "Hear, hear!" man-
fully enough. But unfortunately I
was too pre-occupied on my vocalising
to follow the trends of his oratory,
and happened to give tongue to a
most sounding interjection when,
alack for vanity! he had just an-
nounced that, by force of the prema-
ture bankrupting of Mr. ROBERTSON,
the prize for a large Jack-fish would
not be forthcoming!
Presently I saw much laughter
holding both its sides, and my right
hand vis-a-vis handed me a small
correspondence, requesting me kindly
to pass it to Mr. Vice.
Tliis I did, upon which Mr. Vice-
Chairman stood up again and pro-
posed the health of the Visitors. We
all stood up and slaked our thirst
once again, and then Mr. Chairman
froze my hair by announcing that he
really " must call upon Mr. , the
Japanese gent, to respond for the
visitors."
I rose, bowed, and said:
"Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice, Mr.
GEORGE " (my companion) " and gen-
tle-men! I came to bury CAESAR, not
to respond to visitors, but this being
the first occasion of my being asked to
speak I am in for it. I am a stranger
among you ("Hear! hear! "). But
I am enough of a fisher to know
anchovies from bloater's paste!
(Much cackling.) But let us look
round on fish apart from food, gentle-
men. How useful an article is a fish.
Think of the castor-oil, lamprey'B
piratic saline, fish-glue, and pauper's
hide boot-strings we should never
have had but for fishes and fishers!
Let us regard the enormous waste of
food if there were no finny monsters
to follow the wake of the exhumed
hot-luncheons served on pleasure-
steam-vessels at 2s. 6d., even 3«. 6d.
per head, gentlemen! Let us be
thankful to HANDEL'S creation of
fishes, gentlemen, for manifold beati-
tudes.
"As a visitor in your middle to-
night, gentlemen, let me say I am
glad to be a visitor. I am sure we
are all glad to be visitors, and all
made rosy with sheepishness of grati-
fication at the way in which you have
toasted our shins. Gentlemen, in the
name of others in my predicament, I
think you very hearty chaps. Much
obliged, and the same to each indi-
vidual. Thank you! I am a fisher
from to-night, though I fear I shall
not take prizes except as a diminisher
of boiled-cods! Once more, gentle-
men, in the name of my colleagues,
thanks very much, old chaps!"
Then came more singing, a solo
upon three mandolins and the piano-
forte, and many diverting incidents
by flodden field. I fear GEORGE must
have become jokingly practical later,
for I found myself inbibing the
courage of a Belgian-hare at each
glass—laying the treason to my soul
that GEORGE had added a flow of
reason to my mineral-drink. I
showed many feats of agility with
paper-folding (inadvertently immo-
lating a postal order for one shilling
and sixpence, sterling, in my eager-
ness to be up and doing tricks; but
who . cares ?) and altogether quite
cocked my walk.
On the whole it has been quite a
change, but I was very surprised to
find that the boniface of the Blue
Boar was not at 12.30 after midnight
such a cheery lad, yoho, as lie proved
himself while he overlooked the
ordering of flasks of J. Barleycorn
and drinks of bitterbeer and smallbass
earlier in the evening. E. N. D.
An Army Order which has just
been issued gives the following as
the occasions on which the Union
Jack is to be flown: —
"(a) On anniversaries only, or when specially
required for saluting purposes, (b) On Sundays
nnd anniversaries, (r) Daily."
A doctor writing on the "Uses of
Oxygen " in The Daily Mirror says:
"I have often to run five minutes to a station
and up a flight of stairs, across a bridge, and
then across a siding. After breathing oxygen
for six minutes I can do it easily."
Perhaps he could manage it still more
comfortably if he spent the whole
eleven minutes in walking quite
slowly to the station.
THE SOUVENIR-HUNTERS.
"YES," said la belle Americaine,
"there is no doubt that I have the
finest collection of souvenirs on this
side at the present moment. Would
you like to see them?"
I said that nothing would give me
greater pleasure; but of course many
things would. Still, it is a useful
phrase.
"You 're just in time," she said.
"They 're all spread out on the
tables: we pack up to-night. We sail
on Saturday."
I followed her to her suite of
sitting-rooms overlooking the Thames,
ami entered what appeared to be a
marine store. "There!" she said
triumphantly, indicating the debris.
Every inch of table, sofa, chair and
mantelpiece space was covered with
litter: pebbles, faded flowers, nap-
kin rings, cigar stumps, cherry stones,
bits of rock, spoons, forks, bed-knobs,
railway straps, candle-ends, cakes of
soap, billiard balls, menus, lumps of
sugar, and a thousand other things.
On looking more closely I saw that
to each was affixed a card bearing a
name and a date.
I picked one up and read it: "The
Dover Pageant, July 28," it ran;
"Louis N. PARKER'S cigar stump."
"Ah! " she said, "that 's one of
my bullicst souvenirs. Wasn't it
lucky to get that? Won't it make
some of the others just mad with
jealousy?"
I picked up another: a spoon,
with the name of a well-known Dee-
side hotel on it.
"That 's a Scotch one," she said.
"You have to be spry to get those,
I can tell you; the waiters are all up
to it now. Mamma was caught
pocketing hers, but I got mine all
right. Poor mamma, she 's so un-
lucky. It cost her several dollars to
square a horrid landlord at Stratford-
on-Avon just because she was pocket-
ing a napkin ring. I got mine,
though—there it .is!"
"I "m most particular," she con-
tinued, "to get them all myself;
there 's no fun in getting others to do
it for you. Why, there 's some girls
mean enough to sit down at home,
after they get back, and make sou-
venirs out of things they find there,
and fix up labels for them just as
if they were real. But all mine are
genuine. And the trouble! Look at
that plum stone there—that was left
on Mr. THOMAS HARDY'S plate the
day we called at Max Gate, Dorches-
ter. He 'd had plum pic for lunch.
It cost me a quarter to get that from
the parlourmaid. I had to be sure

HE slipped smiling into the vacant
seat beside mine on the top of the
omnibus — a rusty, unprepossessing
little man, somewhat frayed at the
edges, and with a general air upon
him that suggested a combination of
Drink and the British Museum.
"I see," he began without apology,
"that you are perusing one of my
latest. I shall be glad to hear how
it strikes you."
I glanced from him to my half-
penny newspaper in surprise. "As

tone of corrective hauteur, " I am at

apparently not ill

on the dietetic properties of sea-

could have been written by the indi-
vidual beside me? I glanced at him
again dubfeusly.
"All of it," he said, as though in

"There is one 'other thing," I
ventured, not without hesitation, for
I was beginning to revise my first
estimate of him; " the style. I seem
to catch an echo — other articles
which arc somehow familiar, but
which I cannot definitely place."
This time he beamed in absolute
triumph. "I congratulate you," he
exclaimed warmly; "you have the
perception of the connoisseur. Of
course, many of my works are
doubtless familiar to you. My
monograph on the restorative pro-
perties of strawberries - and - cream

then perplexed me. Appearances

leaned forward, extending the news-
paper and mutely calling his atten-
tion to the description with a look of
enquiry.
He did not seem at all em-
barrassed. "Aha! " he said smiling,
and might have been about to add
more; but perceiving that we were
now in Bloomsbury he substituted
a hasty "Good morning" and de-
scended briskly from the omnibus.
I had a last glimpse of him standing
before a small newspaper shop re-
garding proudly a contents-bill that
displayed in letters of crimson and
black the words "Are Holidays

THE CONTROVERSIAL DRAMA.
TIIK action of Messrs. HALL CAINK and Louis NAPO-
LEON PAUKER in basing their new play upon an aspect of
the Ideals of Marriage now being so ably discussed in
The Daily Telegraph, has drawn a warm eulogy from
that journal. In a recent leading article The Telegraph
observes, not without complaisance, that nowadays the
drama "fortifies its customary appeal by distinct and
immediate reference to the burning topics that occupy
our newspapers." Envious of earning a similar en-
couragement, several other managers are, we understand,
taking stops to bring their respective entertainments into
line with the correspondence columns of the daily press.
Thus it is (incredibly) rumoured that, in view of the
interest aroused by the Silly Season discussion of " The
Curate's Lot," Mr. BEERBOHM TREE contemplates an
immediate revival of The Private Secretary. Obviously
the spectacle of the Rev. Robert Spaldiny in the oak-
chest cannot fail to have a powerful effect on the
apologists for the present position of our Assistant Clergy.
In this connection also a protest reaches us from
Daly's to the effect that the Lyceum is by no means the
only theatre whose production may be said to bear upon
the vexed question of matrimony and its consolations.
Undoubtedly The Merry Widow presents an aspect of
the same problem that should not be overlooked.
Finally, with regard to another topic which at present
occupies popular attention — The Treatment of the
Feeble-Minded—we need only mention that at least four
West-End houses are nightly presenting some form of
Musical Comedy.
Black Sheep in the Fold.
"During the last twelve months more than one hundred bicycles
have been reported to the Surrey constabulary as having been stolen

"Two days after Browning's birthday. May 9th, 1899, the National
Committee of Organised Labour was formed."
It did look rather suspicious at first sight, but we gladly
absolve the poet from the charge of complicity.
The schedule issued from the Board of Trade in its
search for information regarding the Bleaching and Dye-
ing Industries contains a question as to the number of
working days in the year. There is a note for the reply:
"If the answer to this question is 'None,' the proper entry is
'None.' Blanks are misleading."
We hope the gentleman who drew up the form was not
influenced by his experience at his own office.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
"I LOVE my love with an H because he is handsome,
and his name is Hardy, and he lives on a hill," was no
doubt what Miss Leslie used to say to herself, though 1
don't think M. E. FRANCIS, the author of Hardy-on-
tlie-HUl (METIIUEN), has mentioned it; but, anyhow, the
heroine's aspirations could not be realized at once, be-
cause Mr. Hardy stood on a much lower level socially
than territorially, being, in fact, a yeoman farmer of
Dorset, while she was the daughter of an Oxford don.
Besides there was a polished villain who attempted to
entangle her; and Hardy very foolishly engaged himself
to a girl of his own class. After
being saved, however, from
flood and fire through the
hero's athletic resourcefulness
Miss Leslie very properly
decided (calculating, perhaps,
on the chances of an earth-
quake) to overlook class dis-
tinctions; and, other complica-
tions being removed, is now, I
believe, Mrs. Hardy. The tale
is pleasantly and skilfully told
and indulges the reader with
one of those glimpses of farm-
life which he resolutely deter-
mines to believe in. But is
not the title that Mrs. BLUN-
DELL has chosen rather daring
for a Wessex romance? What
if the publishers were to
startle us some fine morning
with " Phillpoits-on-the-Dart, a
Devonshire, idyll "; or " Corelli-
fupcr-mare, a simple talc of
the sea "!
legally become man and wife, she did not altogether
have a very lively time. But she has at least the con-
solation of feeling that her biography has been written
by a peer.
If there is any author whom I would have backed to
clear up with a triumphant surprise the most bewil-
dering tangle, that author is Mr. RICHARD MARSH, and
he has disappointed me. The Surprising Husband
NV— the title beckons you — deals with certain
social difficulties connected with the coloured race
question, and what with obeahs and voodoos, prejudices
and conventions, Mr. MARSH knots together as pretty
a piece of puzzlement as even he could conceive. He
works it up cleverly.

Mr. JOHN LONG has recently
published a book called The
Hard Way, which, according to
the title-page, is written bv A
PEER. Think of that! A real
live peer. If the otherwise
anonymous author had been a
mere commoner, I cannot help
suspecting that Mr. LONG
would have sent him and his MS. back to school to
learn many things, amongst others that the German
for " why " is u-arnm and not warim, and that " dear"
is licbc and not leibc. After all, noblesse oblige even
in such trifling matters as spelling and grammar and
style; and personally I should think a good many times
before I wrote "jc Ifs ai comptes," or said that " the
irrepressible crumples of her nature rose to a quick
thought," or called a plebeian pocket handkerchief "a
hemmed inornate square." But then I am not a peer.
The moral of The Hard Way is that young ladies who
propose to commit bigamy ought to be quite sure that
no one knows about marriage number one before they
venture to go through the ceremony of number two.
Poor Deljlali Chertscy omitted that precaution and paid
the penalty in the shape of blackmail and much distress
of mind. As her first husband was locked up in a
lunatic asylum for all but three days of their married
life, and her second died almost as soon as they had
Poet (to B/oc/ifcii'd). "Foii GOODNESS' SAKE BE
QUIET! I'M THYING TO WRITE ABOUT A SKYLARK!"
The various players in the game
are distinct and convincing, if
one or two of them arc a
thought bizarre, and you read
on wondering how on earth
matters will get straight—for of
course they will. There is one
way out which you will think of
at once, but, knowing Mr.
MARSH, you will reject it, for
anybody could put his harassed
hero alone into an open boat
at sea and make it turn turtle.
Mr. MAKSH, you say, will surely
never do anything so obvious as
that. Yet—— But perhaps
that is the surprise.

be read with advantage at th>>

Rhodesian life the author has
shown impartially both the sun-
shine and the shadows of that
laud of charm and mystery.
At first I thought that Joyce
Grant was going to be the
heroine, but I was wrong.
Rhodesia soon asserted a better
claim to that distinction. The
fortunes of Mrs. Grant left me
apathetic, but Rhodesia is a
Circe with magic to paralyse
the critical faculties of her suitors. Yet she has her
practical side. "If you don't happen to have private
means, or, at any rate, not less than £'800 capital, you '11
probably go under." This, to the idealist, may be a
little disappointing; but, after all, many heroines with
less to give have asked for more.

THE NORTH-GERMAN-LLOYD-GEORGE.
AS OTHERS SEE HIM.
[N'oTE.—Among the many enquiries and confidences exchanged in
the course of Mr. Lt.ovD-CrEouoF.'s visit to Germany, it wns to be
jomarked that no curiosity was shown on the one side, and no informa-
tion volunteered on the other, as to the actual object of the violently
rapid advance in German naval construction.]
Krlrart from a letter addressed 1>y a hading German politician to a
comfxitrio' abroad:—
"THE Angel of Peace (unofficial), whose wings we have
been stroking for the last month or so, has by now
alighted on his native shore, and we are pushing forward
our Dreadnought programme with renewed encourage-
ment. It has transpired during his tour that the British
fleet is only twice the size of ours and not three times,
as was popularly supposed; so that we have a softer job
than we thought.
The facilities offered to Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE in his
investigation into our contributory system of Old Age
Pensions may have astonished you, familiar as you are
with our habit of arresting any foreigner who is found
with a camera in the neighbourhood of such things.
But we knew our man—we knew that he would never
go back on his own scheme; and our confidence has not
been misplaced. The first of his prolific utterances
after his return shows that he is confirmed in his opinion
that the non-contributory system adopted by the Radical
Party—a system which is to absorb all those millions
needed for their fleet—is the most satisfactory for
veterans over 70. All of us here very heartily endorse
this view.
Meanwhile these harmless facilities have greatly flat-
tered his belief in our devotion to Great Britain. Here
is a typical specimen of our conversations with him :—
German Merchant. We greet in you, Sir, the emissary
of a nation with whom we have ever been on terms of
the most intimate affection, and never more so than
to-day.
Mr. Lloyd-George. I reciprocate .your language of
endearment. But you must not suppose that I have an
official mission. I have no direct authority to arrange
an alliance between our two cousinly nations. At the
same time, as mere private individuals, Mr. HAROLD
SPENDER and I will be happy to meet any or all of
your leading statesmen who may care to discuss with us
the topic of disarmament. Bv the way, how is your
fleet?
German Merchant. Thank you, it may hardly be said
to exist; certaiuly not in comparison with yours, which
must ever remain unapproachable in its magnificence.
Mr. Lloyd-George. I knew I was right. 1 always said
that an irresponsible Press had fabricated those stories
about the ambitious character of your Naval Programme.
German Merchant. If there is any such Programme—
and I have not heard of it—yours would be the. very
last country against which its aim would be directed.
Mr. Lloyd-George. I have always said so; and my
opinions have been shared by every well - informed
Englishman. As for the others, 1 attribute their
suspicions purely to ignorance, which would be dis-
sipated by a closer familiarity with your amiable race.
German Merchant. In every island there must always
be a certain measure of insularity.
Mr. Moyd-Gciiryc. Very true, and admirably expressed.
I could wish that more of my fellow-countrymen were
as widely-travelled as Mr. HAROLD SPENDER and myself.
Still, even for the unenlightened masses of Great Britain,
the presence of so many German waiters in our midst
ought to constitute a very strong bond. And now I shall
return with a new song of hope in my mouth and
pursue with fresh confidence the ideal of my maturer
manhood, namely, the reduction of the, British Fleet.
In this noble work I shall enjoy the enthusiastic colla-
boration of my honourable friend, Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL.
German Mercliant. Ah! There you have a great
statesman. If Mr. CHURCHILL would only patronise our
poor country for his honeymoon, what a reception he
would have!
Mr. Lloyd-George. I will convey to him the assurance
of your profound admiration. And now, since I have
the happy prospect of other conversations of a similar
character with innumerable gentlemen equally con-
cerned to secure a better understanding between our two
nations
And so forth, for weeks on end.
You will naturally ask, how is it that our adored
KAISER has not had a hand in all this? My dear, the
strongest restraint had to be put upon him in official
quarters to prevent his summoning Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE
and saying the wrong thing; or at least spoiling the
general air of spontaneity by overdoing the Hoch! busi-
ness. He might even, in a spasm of tactlessness, have
invited his visitor to a review of our North Sea Battle
Fleet. And it takes a cleverer man than the KAISER
to explain away the objective of a thing like that.
By the way, I heard a rumour that when LLOYD-
GEORGE came here he was a secret Tariff Reformer at
heart. Well, we have corrected all that. We have
shown him that our finances are in a parlous condition,
that everything is costing us more, that the land is
groaning under a tyrannous system of tariffs. He
returns with his old faith in Free Trade restored
tenfold.
So altogether we have done some fairly good strokes
of work for the Fatherland. Yours,
O. VON S.

"Shall not be back. So sorry. Am married."
Such, according to a general consensus of the Press, was
the wording of the epoch-making telegram sent by Mis:;
ELSIE KAY of the Gay Gordons' Company to Mr.
SEYMOUR HICKS. The Daily Mail, however, possibly
enjoying exceptional information, arranges the breathless
sentences in a more piquant order, as follows:
"Shall not be back. Am married. So sorry."
As an advertisement for Mr. HICKS's Company, the one
is, of course, just as useful as the other; but, oh, the

It is too bad, when your average is really 0'66666 for as

incorrectly as 0'20. It gives onlookers a completely
erroneous idea of your form, and more than justifies an
action for libel.

"HURRAY, UNCLE! COME AI.OXC! HEBE'S ANOTHER CIRCUS!"
THE LAST MATCH.
"So Yorkshire 's top again," said
CHARLES. "Well, somebody had to
be, as it couldn't be Surrey."
"It certainly couldn't be Surrey,"
I agreed.
"More likely Surrey than Kent,
anyhow."
"There was once a county," I
said, "which went all the way down
to the West of England to play a
weak side called Gloucestershire.
The county I am speaking of went
in first and made slightly more than
a hundred. The very weak side
replied with nearly three hundred,
whereupon the county we have in
mind made a great effort, and (if
you will believe me) approximated to
the second century. And on the
third day the stop press news said:
'Bank rate unchanged.' The moral
»>
"I seem to remember a match at
the Oval against Kent," said
CHARLES.
"I seem to remember," I said,
"a dog-faced man at BARNUM'S.
We all felt sorry, but nobody
deduced anything from it. By the
way, an old county player, who saw
that match, told me"
"What was his county? Rutland?"
"No, the Isle of Man. They
play a lot of cricket there, but of
course the great match used to be
against Sodor. They had to stop it
at last, because the crowd at
Douglas barracked them so. Yes,
mostly trippers .... from Cam-
bridgeshire and Australia . . . quali-
fying for Surrey . . . Oh, hush!"
I dodged behind the sofa and
waved a handkerchief.
Peace," I said, '' and we will
curse Yorkshire together."
\Ve sat down and did so.
"It 's their fielding that docs it,"
said CHARLES at last. "The papers
don't buck fielding up enough. They
think of nothing but centuries."
"There ought to be catching
averages in the papers," I agreed.
"Catches given: 38. Times not
out: 36. Caught bending: 2. Some-
thing like that. And then you
might go on: Sitters : 18. Sim m the
eyes: 5. Much more difficult than
they looked: 27. Didn't start soon
enough: 9. Started too soon: 9, and
Wan talking to friend on boundary: 1.
I don't quite know how you 'd work
out the average from that, but how-
ever it was arranged you could
always write to the papers after-
wards and show that it was the
wrong way. Which I take to be the
main thing."
"Anyhow," said CHARLES, "the
championship order is worked out on
the wrong system."
"I know it is; but the sickening
thing is that Yorkshire comes top
under any system. I 've tried.
Except one, where you divide the
losses by the wins, and multiply by
the number of letters in the county's
name. When that is adopted, keep
your eye on Northamptonshire.
That 's my tip."
"It 's the ignoring drawn games
which is so absurd. Why shouldn't
they have the vote just as much as
wins and lossos? And it isn't as if
they really did ignore them alto-
gether. The runs made in them
count in the averages."
"And you never get your six-
pence back."
'Sacred to the Memory of York-
shire v. Gloucestershire. Drawn Aug.
26, 1908. N.B.—He was ignored.''
I wiped away a tear.
"But, of course," I said, "there
are some matches which ought to
be ignored. There was one between
Kent and Surrey at the Oval, for
instance."
"I don't thir.k that ought to have
been ignored," said CHARLES,
"though I agree with you that the
public should have had their money
back. They were led to expect a
match."

"There was nothing in the last
twenty meetings of Kent and Surrey
to lead them to expect that."
"Talking of Northamptonshire,"
said CHARLES, hastily, "did you see
that one of them made a century
the other day? They gave him a
bat, I expect. Probably with a
splice. Do you think they had a
half-holiday in the villages?"
"They didn't give him a bat. He
had a crest worked on the pocket of
his shirt. Why do you rag North-
amptonshire? It isn't the bottom
county."
"Which is? Somerset?"
"I think so. Who is that very
good professional who plays for
Somerset? He was born in some
other county, but they thought they
could do without him. I don't
mean FRY. Begins with a B., I
fancy ?''
"You don't mean HUTCHINGs?
Oh, but you said 'good.'"
"No, this man played several
times for Surrey, but they kicked
him out at last, because they had a
man coming oyer from Tasmania.
When I say coming over from
Tasmania, I mean that his petiole
were all born in Cambridgeshire."
CHARLES lit a cigarette calmly.
"Had a good season yourself?"
he asked.
"That 's right," I said. "Let 's
bury the hatchet again. Yes, I had
one very jolly week's cricket in
Dorset. Didn't I tell you?"
"Dorset? By Jove, of course I
read about it in The Times. Let's
see, you all came from Kent, more
or less, didn't you? Kent Wan-
derers or something, you called your-
selves."
"That 's it. Was it really in The
Times? I didn't know they went in
for cricket like that. Did they give
the full scores ?''
"Oh, no. No, it was quite a
small paragraph. Something like
this. 'The farmers '—yes, that was
it—' the Dorset farmers complain
of the unusually large number of
rabbits about this summer. Steps
are to bo taken to exterminate
them." . . . Er—if it isn't a rude
question, what did they do?"
"Well," said CHARLES, "it's all
over. We can bo friends in the
winter, anyhow."
"Quite," I said. "And you
mustn't mind what I said about
Surrey. Because as a matter of
fact nobody has a greater admiration
for Surrey than I.
"Really?" said CHARLES, and he
looked quite pleased.
"Yes. It 's a fine county. I am
not referring to its cricket now, but
to its scenery. A fine county. Leith
Hill, and so on. Well, I shall see
you at Blackheath next season, I
suppose. You must come up for
that. All three days, if you can."
"There won't be a third day,"
said CHARLES with a grin. ..,.••
"No," I agreed calmly.

THE PROFESSIONAL CLASSES.
LETTER FROM A BALHAM RESIDENT.
Summer Grove,
374, Railway Terrace,
Balham, S.W.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I write to ask
your advice on the subject of the
Professional Classes, as I bought a
second-hand copy of one of your
volumes for my little girl to colour
the prints, and no doubt you will
agree with me that business is busi-
ness. I will confine myself to an
exact statement of my experiences.
I lately bought the house I now
live in (having moved from another
in the same terrace for this purpose);
that is to say, I paid £70 down, and
I pay £17 8s. a year interest on the
mortgage, which is like paying rent;
but the house is my own property
and I can sell it at any time. In
short, I am my own Landlord. When
we got the deed from the Lawyer
(who had stupidly called it a Con-
veyance," causing us a cruel dis-
appointment, as my dear wife has
always wanted to have a pony and
trap when we can afford it; but I
will not go into that)—I say, when
we read the deed, Mr. Punch, we
found that the previous owner had
had a seizure and died in the house.
My dear wife could not rest iintil she
knew whether it was an infectious
disease, and it was only right that we
should be informed on this point.
Accordingly I wrote to the Lawyer
and asked him, "Can you tell me
whether the complaint of which the
last- owner died was infectious or
not?" He replied, "We are not in
a position to answer your question,
but would suggest that you consult
his medical adviser on the subject."
As I did not know who this medical
adviser was, I went to my doctor.
He charges two shillings in the morn-
ing and sixpence after seven o'clock,
which I think is most unreasonable;
and he will not give you a bottle with
the medicine, but only a cork. I
asked him whether fits were catching.
He said "No, not usually," and
asked what sort of fits I meant.
"Hearditaments," I told him.
"What?" he said, as if I had not
spoken clearly. I told him again,
louder. He frowned and said,
"There 's no such disease."
"In the fee simple," I explained,
for it said so in the deed.
"What do you mean?" he cried
testily.
I explained. I said, "It 's where
they have them, of course."
He got quite red, and asked in a
most disrespectful manner, "Where
who have what 1 ''
"Hearditaments," I answered;
"I 've told you three times."
He sighed in a silly despairing sort
of way and said, "My dear Sir, I
assure you there is no such disease.
Good day. I have patients waiting
to see me."
Promptness I always hold to be the
soul of business, and I went on
straight to the Lawyer to tell him of
the absurd mistake he had made.
When I was shown into the office he
said, "How de do? Sit down.
You 've brought the deeds?" I told
him I had not. "I 've come," I said,
"to tell you that I 've just been to
see my doctor." He pretended to be
puzzled. "You told me to see the
late owner's medical adviser," I ex-
plained, "but I did not know who
he was, so I went to ask my doctor."
"Oh, ah, yes," he said; "I remem-
ber. Well?"
"Well," I said, "there is no such
disease."
"As what?"
"As what you said."
"/said?"
"Yes; in the deed."
He frowned a little, and then said
in a foolish mincing manner, " Pray,
Mr. PABSLIP, endeavour to make
yourself clear. Here is a copy of the
Conveyance. Will you kindly point
out the passage you refer to?" So I
let him see it with his own eyes:
"And whereas the said Tobias Spink-
well Woosnap who died the, etc., etc.,
was sei2ed with hearditaments in the
fee simple," &c. He still pretended
to be puzzled. "Well, what is your
question?" he asked.
"Why," I said, "the doctor says
there is no such disease; that 's all."
"No such disease as ichat?"
"Hearditaments, of course."
"What?"
"Hearditaments." I admit that
I raised my voice, as I was naturally
annoyed at the man's extraordinary
dulness.
He looked again at the paper, and
then fell back in his chair twitching,
so that I thought it was a stroke.

Then I saw he was laughing. He
behaved in a most extraordinary way,
Mr. Punch. He yelped once like a
dog, called mo a wag, and tried to
poke me with a ruler, but 1 drew
back in time. Then he suddenly be-
came very stern, and spoke to me
in a low voice, shuffling the papers
about on his desk and not looking at
me. He said such conduct was in-
decorous, and that I was wasting his
time; and he went and held the door
opon for me as if / had yelped or
tried to poke him with the ruler.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOK-PLANTER.
WHAT you want is a good Digest,
and a new Digest has just been pub-
lished. Many of us have good diges-
tions, but few (alas, how few!) have
a good Digest. Most of us have no
Digest at all. You even do not know
what a Digest is. If you knew what
a Digest was, you would see how
much you stand in need of one. The
more I think of it, the more I am
persuaded that you want a Digest
more than anything else in the world.
Oh, how glad I am that you are
going to have (as you will shortly
see) a Digest at last!
This Digest, my dear boy, is a thing
of countless pages and multitudinous
print. Sometimes it is in a blue
cover, sometimes in a brown; but
even when its cover has been torn
ruthlessly off its back in order to
support the shorter leg of the table
what remains is still a Digest. It is
a Law-Book, full to the brim of
cases. There are cases on page 29;
there are cases on page 403; there
are cases on page 1217. The Author
wanted to have a case or two on
the cover, but the Publisher, know-
ing that you would eventually use
that part at any rate as a table-leg
equalizer, refrained.
Thoughtful for others he is, this
Publisher who sits in his office order-
ing copies to be printed as fast as
he can order, and sending out his
agent to thrust them into the hands
of the public, however little they
may like it.
Though I cannot hope to be as
thoughtful as he is, 1 do my best
for you. After long and anxious
consideration, I have decided that
you ought to have a Digest. You
are going therefore to have a
copy of this Digest to yourself;
indeed, you are going to have
my own, my only copy, at a slight,
a very slight, reduction from the pub-
lished price. Do not apologise for
robbing me: do not waste words.
The sooner you clear a space for it
on your shelf, the shorter time it will
lie about on your dining-room table.
Mark you, 1 have not bought it
myself yet, and I wish heartily that
I was not going to. But I am.
GRAY thought that he was not going
to buy one, but he did. The Man
came to Chambers and insisted on
seeing him. He smiled at GRAY,
and GRAY mistakenly smiled back.
In ten minutes he had given the
Man an irrevocable order for a Digest
which he did not want. When he
gets down to the "P's," the Man
will look me up. "Are you Mr.
PERCIVAL?" he will ask, and when
I tell him that I have been brought
up in that belief he will smile at me.
I shall make up my mind not to
smile back, and shall smile back.
In ten minutes I shall have given an
order for a Digest which I do not
want and am going to sell to you.
When GRAY told me what had
happened to him and was going to
happen to me, I was at first grieved
and worried. "Am I worthy?"
I thought; '' for who am I that
I should possess this stupendous
tome.'.'" I pondered over it, and
suffered in my appetite and had
sleepless nights until I remembered
you and your needs. Then I was
comforted and happy to think that
you were going to buy it from me
when I got it.
Of course you hate Digests
(we all do); but I take it that
you are prepared to buy? . . .
Come now, you had better agree
quietly. There are only four volumes,
and no one wants you to read them.
You need not pay till Monday. . . .
Come, come, would you sooner have
my copy, or risk an interview with
the Man? If you are naughty and
obstinate I shall certainly give him
your address. Remember that while
I only want you to take my one copy,
the. Man himself has no foolish and
hidebound ideas about "One Man,
One Digest." Another word, and
your address is his.
I am glad to see that you are
silent, and hope that your silence
means consent. Let me warn you1
against the folly of hoping to escape
by bribing the man who works the
Flip-Flap at the Franco-British Ex-
hibition, and procuring him to stop
the engines and leave you suspended
in mid-air. You will have been up
there less than an hour and a quarter
when the head of the Digest-man
will appear over the edge of the cage.
I cannot think how he will get there,
but he will get there. He is not the
man to stand any nonsense. I know
a man who swore at him, and in two
minutes that rash fellow had ordered
not only a copy for himself, but a
copy for his wife and one for his
children. There is a limited edition
de luxe in an unlimited number of
\olumes, bound in vellum, printed
on India-paper, surrounded by the
widest conceivable margins, contain-
ing signed portraits of all the
dramatis personce, and costing hun-
dreds of pounds. The Man keeps
this for refractory customers.
Come now, you had better agree
like a sensible person to take my
copy.
THE GOOD MAN AND CUPID.
(A Fable for the Silly Season.)
THERE was once a good and worthy
man, a minister of the gospel and an
altruist of intense activity, who was
grievously distressed by the unhappy
marriages in his neighbourhood. He
saw young men who ought (as he
thought) to marry JANE and ELIZA
leading to the altar VIOLET and
ERMINTRUDE; and young women
fitted to be wise helpmates to JOHN
and HICHARD setting their caps at
REGINALD and HUGHIE; the result
being the usual bickerings and dis-
satisfactions of the ill-matched.
The matter troubled him so
seriously that he joined a toxophilite
club and took lessons in archery until
he could hit the gold at five hundred
yards twenty times in succession;
and having reached this state of pro-
ficiency he called on Dan Cupid
and expressed to that mischievous
and uncovered boy his disapproval of
the happy-go-lucky way in which he
pulled his bow-string and directed his
arrows, almost without looking. He
offered himself to shoot in his stead.
"There may be something in what
you say," Cupid replied; "at any
rate you seem to be older and graver
and possibly wiser than I, and you
certainly wear more clothes. Take
the bow and try for yourself."
The good man did so, and the next
day or so he was very busy conscien-
tiously transfixing the hearts of his
parishioners. Such was the accuracy
of his aim that he made only one
slip, and that was when, in his
endeavours to unite by puncture the
cardiac penumbras of pretty little
LIZZIE PORTER and Mr. GODFREY
BLOOM, his eye faltered, and instead
Mr. GODFREY BLOOM was paired
with the exceedingly unprepossessing
DOROTHEA ATKINS, who happened to
be standing close by.
The good man did all that was
possible to repair the mischief which
he felt his lapse had caused; but it
was in vain, and Miss LIZZIE PORTER
never regained her chance.
"Well," said Cupid, as he strolled
into the good man's garden a few
years after, "how has your shooting
turned out? Perfectly, I suppose."
"No," the good man replied with
a sigh, "I am afraid not. As a
matter of fact the only happy brace
in the whole bag are GODFREY and
DOROTHEA."
"Quite so," said the little fellow.
"I expected it. I always felt those
archery lessons were a mistake."
"Then what is to be done?"
asked the good man. "What is to

be done if neither taking aim nor
shooting at random avails?"
"Nothing," said Cupid as he fitted
an arrow to the string. "Nothing.
I must just go on shooting and
hope for the best."
"MUCH CONSIDERATION."
[After much consideration Mr. Arthur
Collins and Messrs. Cecil Raleigh and Henry
Hamilton, the authors, have decided that the
title of the autumn production at Unity Lane

H. H. Ah, yes, the title. We

A. C. I should like marriage or the

The public always rise to that. But
I hear that that confounded Lyceum

C. R. Yes, you 're quite right.
Marriage is always a draw.

A. C. Not bad; but not quite right.

H. H. Ha! ha! very good.

A. C. Yes, for something else. Not
for this. No, let 's see what we can

THE DANGER ZONE.
Head Beater. "Hour, SASDY MOM, KEEP BACK THERE! OR MAYBE TE'LL GET A PELLET is THE SEE!"
KROUGLIK, UNLIMITED.
AN interesting development of the
momentous discovery of Co!<">nol
OSHCHEVSKY KROUGLIK, recordo'i in
The Times of the 25th ult., has been
brought to our notice.
Colonel KROUGLIK, it will be re-
membered, has invented a flying
machine, propelled by tin wings, and
capable of attaining a speed of over
200 miles an hour. A certain amount
of scepticism having been expressed
in some quarters as to the genuine-
ness of the invention, we are glad
to be able to announce that a
company has been formed for its
manufacture and development, the
constitution of which establishes the
bona fides of the concern.
The chairman is, of course, Colonel
KHOUGLIK, who will also be managing
director and chief aviator. But the
board will be immensely strengthened
by the accession of Captain von
KOEPENICK, the famous German
soldier, of KUBELIK, the illustrious
violinist, of Mr. BENJAMIN KIDD, and
last, but not least, Mr. PETER KEARY.
It is also hoped that Lord KITCHENER
OF KHARTOUM will join the board on
allotment, as the inventor attaches
the greatest possible importance to
'.-'curing directors whose names begin
with a K. Like Sir HIHAM MAXIM'S
new gun, the KROUGLIK flying
machine is practically noiseless, ex-
cept for a slight tintinnabulation
caused by the rotation of the
metal pinions, and Herr KUBELIK
looks forward to being able to
give flying recitals which will
bring a far larger audience within the
range of his instrument than hereto-
fore. The apparatus is also capable
of being attached to pianos, and
Colonel KROUGLIK declares that it
will enable athletic virtuosi, with
their wives and press-agents, to pro-
ceed from capital to capital at a
speed exceeding 150 miles an hour.
At an experimental demonstration
recently held at St. Petersburg
Mr. BORIS BAMBERGER, the famous
pianist, flew to Moscow on an over-
strung Bliithsteimvay, with his in-
fant son lashed to the soft pedal,
and alighted at the Kremlin amid
the cheers of the populace, wittily
remarking chi va piano, va lontano.
The flying machine itself closely
resembles a Muscovy duck, and the
motive power is supplied, not by a
petrol engine, but by the muscular
power of the aviator. The great ad-
vantage of this system over petrol-
driven aeroplanes and dirigible bal-
loons is that it combines exercise, with
excitement. As Mr. PETER KEARY
observed the other day to Prince
KKOPOTKIN, Colonel KROUGLIK'S
machine is a perfect example of the
ethics of the Higher Hustle. "You
must work to get on, otherwise you
will have to get out."
The KROUGLIK machine, again, is
not only attachable to steamers and
pianos. In a miniature form it can
be used to assist the flight of golf-
balls and other projectiles, to promote
the rapid departure of unwelcome
guests, or to accelerate the move-
ment of tardy beasts of burden. In
fine, from whatever point of view we
contemplate this invention, it bids
fair to become an exhilarating acces-
sion to the amenities of civilisation.

HELP FOE AMATEUR ACTORS.
Gagging.-r- -Should any improve-
ment in your part occur to you
during the performance, do not
selfishly keep the discovery to your-
self. Wait till the other actor has
finished his love-passage and then
bring out your witticism. But first
wink to the prompter by way of
warning, otherwise he may spoil
everything.
False Beards.—These should be
worn with due regard to the colour
of wig affected by tho amateur.
Auburn beards are seen to the
greatest advantage with grey hair.
If you have the time and pluck you
may add a touch of realism to your
performance by growing a beard for
yourself, then dyeing it the requisite
shade. In this way you will score
over the slovenly professional who
invariably has recourse to artificial
hair.
Eyebrows.—These should only be
worn in extreme cases, or pantomime.
Where the management has not pro-
vided a set, se'e the stage-carpenter
about them. If there is no stage-
carpenter, improvise a pair yourself.
One false moustache cuts into four.
Trap-doors.—By L.C.C. ordinance,
all trap-doors must open outwards,
and be lowered once during every
performance. Stage tradition allows
these emergency exits to be used
only by principals. Supers must all
leave the stage by the wings.
Cues.—Instead of waiting for
your cue at the wings, advance
boldly on to the stage two or three
minutes before you are expected.
Your appearance will relieve the
tension of the other actors, who are
just growing anxious. The odd
moments you have gained may be
profitably spent in perfecting your
part.
Taking Calls.—If the audience in-
sists upon your reappearance before
the curtain, step forward modestly,
leading one of the principals by the
hand. This piece of gracious con-
descension is bound to make you
popular.
Stage-Managers.—Should the con-
tinued corrections of the stage-
manager annoy you, do not (unless
you have no understudy) offer to
throw up your part. Instead, treat
his impertinences with calm indiffer-
ence. On the night of the perform-
ance you can show the public what
you think of his ability by leaving
out all these alterations.
Grease-paint.—To remove, boil the
part affected in strong soda-and-
water.

SEA BREEZES.
THE lady of the Mantilla (Mrs. PINCHIN) and the lady
of the Blouse (Mrs. PINKER), whose conversation I
reported a fortnight ago, are still staying in the seaside
resort where I first observed them. Their friendship,
as 1 noticed, made a rapid start; but since then it has
advanced but little, for when they sit on the beach they
are still, if 1 may say so, inseparably divided by a little
space of pebbles across which they confide to "one
another, in an aimless dribble of disconnected details,
the characteristics of their husbands and many mild
domesticities. These they match, as it were, against
one another, for Mrs. PINCHIN would apparently
hold herself to be disgraced if she could not produce an
indigestion on the part of Mr. PINCHIN to rival the
sufferings of Mr. PINKER from bilious headache. TOMMY
and MELIA PINCHIN, in combination with HKNERY and
JANE PINKER, _ are still scattered about the beach with
spades and pails, and provide the usual interludes of
panic and reproof.
The Mantilla. The old fisherman brought them up all
alive the day Mr. PINCHIN was down here last week—-
quite a lot of them in an old bit of sack. Mr. PINCHIN
wouldn't believe they were prawns. He said that sort of
greenery colour wasn't right for prawns. All the
prawns he 'd ever seen were pink, he said, and these
were more like dragons than prawns. It gave him
quite a turn when they all came out pink after the girl
had boiled them. But then, men don't know every-
thing.
The Blouse. Ah, you may well say that. I often tell
Mr. PINKER a pound 's a pound, and not thirty shillings.
Men seem to think money 's to last for ever. Take only
boots and shoes for the children, and you run into a
lot in no time. (She looks out over tlie beach.) Why,
I do declare if that young ragamuffin hasn't gone out
in the sea up to his middle, and JANE 's gone after him.
(She calls.) HENERY! JANE! (No result follows.) I'll
dust his jacket when I catch him.
The Mantilla. There 's MELIA splashing water all over
TOMMY. (She calls.) TOMMY! MELIA! (No notice is
taken.) They 're more of a nuisance every day. I
can't keep a dry stitch on 'em. I often say to Mr.
PIXCHIN, if you won't exert your authority, I say, you
mustn't be surprised if they go on anyhow; but he only
laughs and says you 're not young more 'n once.
The Blouse. Mr. PINKER spoils 'em with sweets, and
then he 's surprised their clothes want mending.
[A steamer heavily loaded with passengers appears
about lialf a mile out. There is considerable excite-
ment on the beach.
The Mantilla. Look, there 's the steamer.
The Blouse. Lor, so it is. Isn't there a lot of people
aboard of her'?
The Mantilla. I warrant there 's plenty of them sea-
sick.
The Blouse. Ah.
The Mantilla. I don't hold with steamers. We went
to Margate once on one of their steamers, but never
again, I said. Mr. PINCHIN'S face went the colour of a
pocket-handkerchief.
The Blouse (playing a trump card). Ah! It 's a sad
trial for those that are took that way. Mr. PINKER 's
been over to Bullong on one of those ongtont visits.
The Mantilla (innocently). Didn't he take you with
him?
The Blouse (magnificently). Not that time.
The Mantilla. Lor!
(A pause.)
The Blouse. I wonder where that steamer 's going.
The Mantilla. We shall see her coming back p'raps
this evening. They mostly come back this way.
[A soaked dog approaches barking, and shakes himself
violently over both ladies.
The Blouse and the Mantilla (together). Ow! Ow!
Take him away! Oh, you naughty dog. There, if he
hasn't spoilt my dress.
The Blouse. That 's the worst of dogs. They 're
always shaking themselves over you.
The Mantilla. There 's a cat in our lodgings has just
had five kittens.
[At this moment the behaviour of the children becomes
intolerable. They are slowly collected after much
distracted sJiouting, and arc carried off inland by
means of the maternal tug, wliich consists in seiz-
ing a child by the wrist, pushing it fiercely away
from you, and then suddenly pulling it back again.
Thus the two parties proceed to their homes.

And we shall no longer accord 'em
A place in our novel regime.
For everyone who can afford 'em
Will purchase these oxygen kits—
What heights we shall grow to
\Vhen fed upon O2,
What poets, what thinkers, what wits!
WThen your chief is more stupid than ever,
When he thinks you are wrong in your view,
And he tries with persistent endeavour
To prove that the fault lies with you;
Don't argue—don't try to be clever,
But give him a dose of the gas,
And in less than a second
Your chief may be reckoned
Not half such a silly old ass.
When gloom overtakes your house-party,
When no one will smile at your jests,
And you 're feeling that, out vi ant arte,
You simply must stir up your guests:
Once more will the laughter grow hearty,'
Once more will your table be gay,
If you 're up to a wrinkle
And carefully sprinkle
The party with oxygen spray.
When you can't find a subject to write on,
When the papers are dismally blank,
Don't worry! you 've only to brighten
Your wits at the oxygen tank.
Ah, had I been able to light on
A draught of this excellent brew,
What a gay, what a witty
And wonderful ditty

if difficult) would run something
like this: —
Question. "You know the BLANKS,
don't you?"
Answer. "Yes. I meet them now
and then."
Q. "Only now and then? Why, I
thought that you were intimate
there."
A. "No."
Q. "But you dined there last
week."
A. "I did. One cannot go on
saying ' No ' for ever."
Q. "Don't you think she 's very
charming?"
A. "1 can quite understand her
being thought so."
Q. "I like her very much. She
is one of my closest friends. I
always understood that she admires
you immensely."
A. "Very possibly she does. It is
one of the tragedies of life that we
cannot like every one that likes us."
Q. "Why don't you like her?"
A. "Oh, I don't know. Dr. Fell,
I suppose. I wish it was otherwise:
but there it is."
That is perhaps quite frank enough;
but you could if you liked (but it is
a great mistake) be franker still.
Thus: —
COURSE II.
Question. "You know the BLANKS,
don't you?"
Answer. "I know them, yes."
Q. "You don't like them, then?"
A. "No; I'm sorry to say I
don't."
Q. "Why ever not? How very
strange! I thought everyone liked
them. Don't you like her?"
A. "No. She strikes me as a bore
and a tuft-hunter."
This ought to settle it; but you
must be prepared for the whole
conversation getting round to the
BLANKS very shortly, with the usual
complications.
COURSE III.
The third course is to preserve
your conscience by diplomacy.
Thus: —
Question. "You know the BLANKS,
don't you?"
THE LANGUAGE OF POSTURE.
1 he recent cult of classical dances has developed a tendency loirard expressire
and beautiful mocemcnt as a means of communicating ideas.

Jones expressing to Brown (on another bus) that he expects to see him next
Monday at 7'15 in Charing Cross Station (District Railway). Brown replies (by
posture) that be may possibly be late; but don't wait more than ten minutes.

Sportsman telling an inquiring stranger
that he certainly has some matches, but
they strike only on the box—which he
has lost.
Alpine hero informing his friends that
it will be impossible for him to join them

Answer. "The BLANKS? Oh, yes.
It was there that I met that strange
Madame BORTSCH, the Russian exile.
I wonder if you ever saw her. I
never was so impressed by a per-
sonality. By the way, she told me
a very curious story of dual per-
sonality—quite a Jeltyll and Hyde in
real life, only, if possible, more
sinister."
Here you tell the story, and by the
time it is over the BLANKS will have
receded into the background.
COURSE IV.
This is the simplest of all, and the
persons would
one which all wise
follow. It is, briefly, the easy and'
dishonest.
Question. "You know the BLANKS,
don't you?"
Answer. "Oh, yes; delightful
people."
Q. "Mrs. BLANK is a great friend
of mine, and she so often talks of
you. You go there a great deal?"
A. "Yes, as often as I can. She
is very charming and clever."
Q. "I am glad you like her. One
likes one's friends to like one's
friends, doesn't one?"
A. "Oh, yes. At least nice people
do."
And so on.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"THE GREY UNDERWORLD."
I.—WILLIAM'S OLD DOG.
PONKER'S name is not yet among
those of the elect in the pages of
Who 's Who, but it will be shortly,
because he is collecting material for
a really big book—a series of " human
documents " dealing with what he is
pleased to call "The Grey Under-
world" of London. "The Grey
Underworld," so far as I can gather,
consists of rather saddening residen-
tial streets, where people subsist, if
brass plates are anything to go
by, chiefly by persuading one
another to take out life and fire
policies, and where commerce,
represented by the oilman, is
restricted to corner sites. PON-
KER says that such places are
full of unexploited drama, and
I dare say he is right; but the
difficulty is to get at it. His
methods of research, however,
are various and enterprising,
but I don't think they are
always quite kind to the under-
worldlings themselves.
There was the case of WIL-
LIAM B., for example. We first
knew of WILLIAM B. through
an advertisement in an even-
ing paper.
"Fine dog; genuine Sussex;
very old; what offers? Or
would exchange for treadle fret-
saw.—Apply WILLIAM B.," etc.
PONKKR worried all one even-
ing about WILLIAM B.'s very old
sheep-dog. There was a story,
and a sad one, he said, behind
this advertisement.
I suggested that perhaps the
dog had bitten a postman; but
PONKER would not be put off
with anything so probable
as that. And, over the last
pipe, he told me the story of
WILLIAM B. as it shaped itself in his
own mind.
WILLIAM'S father, it appeared, had
fallen a victim to agricultural depres-
sion. (No, I don't know if even
Tariff Reform could have saved him.
Perhaps he was a bad farmer.
PONKER didn't say.)
After the sale was over, WILLIAM
B. made a manly vow to go to
London, work in an office, and, as a
natural sequel, save enough to buy
back the old homestead and pay the
creditors in full.
So one fine afternoon he shook
hands with the station-master, also
with an aged retainer of his father's
who had come to see him off, and
disappeared into the Maelstrom of
London; while the aged retainer
hobbled sadly .back to the village,
telling all he met that "t'yoong
measter be a-goiin to Lunnon, he be,
sewerloi "—for PONKER, I must re-
mark, like many novelists and all
playwrights, is fully convinced that
that is how people in the country
talk.
So a new life began for WILLIAM B.
You will guess, as easily as I did,
that there was a scratching at the
door of his lodgings a few days later.
'The old sheep-dog, the faithful friend
of his childhood, had followed him
to London. (How? Ah, well! We

Uneasy Tlatter. "I wisn THAT PERSON WOULD MOVE ON
HE'LL SPOIL ALL MY TKAUE!"
know these things do happen. Surely
you read The Spectator sometimes?)
Of course WILLIAM B. vowed he
would share his last crust- with the
dog; but it had not come to that
as yet, for he had chops for supper,
and the dog had the bones; and on
Sundays he would take the fine old
fellow to suburban commons, where
it barked at the swans on the ponds,
and was the terror of all pugs.
But then the story shifted into a
minor key. The Maelstrom was too
much for WILLIAM. He lost his job,
and one by one his possessions had to
go to buy food for him and the dog.
At last there was only one hope left.
WILLIAM B., always clever with his
hands, thought to earn a pittance by
making pipe-racks and things. But
how to procure the necessary imple-
ments? His eyes fell on the dog,
stretched by the fireless hearth . . .
"Grand old dog!" said PONKER
huskily at this point. "Fine old
fellow! To-morrow I shall go and
offer WILLIAM B. my "fret-saw."
"But have you got one? " I asked.
"Heavens! No!" said PONKER
drowsily.
"And where will you keep the
dog?"
"I shan't have the dog. But
there 's 'copy' to be made out of
WILLIAM B.," explained PONKEB.
He went the following day;
but it was some time before I
could persuade him to reveal
what had passed between him-
self and WILLIAM B.
He found, he eventually told
me, a young man at the given
address playing a pianola. He
thought this looked like beastly
extravagance on WILLIAM B.'s
part, until he reflected that
the pianola might, after all,
belong to the rooms. WIL-
LIAM B. was a grave, square-
headed, spectacled young man
—the sort of young man who
would be fond of fret-work—
and he rose and eyed PONKEK
attentively as he entered.
"I think," said PONKER,
"you want a fret-saw—a really
good one; ball-bearings and all
that sort of thing."
"Oh, yes," said WILLIAM B.
with ill-concealed eagerness.
"Well, now, about the dog,"
said PONKER; "have you had it
long?"
WILLIAM B. replied that it
had been in his family for
hundreds of years; but POXKER
supposed that was only his
nonsense—the jest of an aching
heart.
"I should like to see it before I
decide anything," continued PONKER,
making a careful study of WTILLIAM
B.'s face. He thought WILLIAM B.
was masking his emotions bravely.
WILLIAM B., whatever his emotions
may have been, merely pointed to
the fender.
Of course, as I had guessed during
PONKER'S recital of the young man's
story, it was a fire dog, but a
printer's error had made a "fine
dog" of it.
PONKER says that he gaped at the
beastly thing, and, muttering some-
thing about writing in the morning,
hurried away.
I am afraid WILLIAM B. is still
waiting to hear about that fret-
saw. PONKER says, "Let him wait.

WILLIAM B. is a ghastly fraud."
And it is certain that he will never
figure among PONKEH'S human docu-
ments of "The Grey Underworld."
THE FINAL PHASE.
THERE is a particular kind of rain
which never gets harder but never
stops—which penetrates all known
forms of waterproof and depresses
the most cheerful spirit extant.
There is a particular kind of spot
on a muddy road crossing a bleak
common where is afforded shelter
insufficient even for a gnat, to which
no station is nearer than 7J miles.
There is a particular kind of motor
which may or may not break down
anywhere else, but is certain to
break down at this particular spot
in this particular kind of weather.
As I came up to him I saw him
standing by his car and regarding
it with a gaze from which expression
of any sort was entirely absent.
Where he was not soaked with water,
be was soaked with oil. His was a face
over which all the human emotions
and passions had passed and left
their several marks. Even the new
stream of water which now found its
way from the rim of his cap to the
most private part of his neck did not
divert his gaze or seem to affect his
feeling. As for the car, it stood
there open at the bonnet, beaten
upon monotonously by the rain, and
appearing to be more stationary than
the most established of the world's
most ancient hills.
I slowed down my own car and
offered him assistance. "No, thank
you," he said, in a cold and even
voice; " I think not, unless, perhaps,
you could spare me a little petrol."
"Yes," I said, "I can spare you
some petrol."
"Can you," he said, "spare me
rather a lot of petrol?"
"Yes," I said. "I think I could
even do that."
"I should like," he continued, " a
very great deal of petrol; evQ.ry drop
of petrol, in fact, that you can pos-
sibly let me have."
I showed him what petrol I had,
and he seemed satisfied.
"And now," he said, and his voice
seemed to me to become more cold
and more even, "would you be so
good as to help me pour all that
petrol over my car and then lend me
a match'.'"

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT always seems to me a strange thing that female
relations, especially aunts, who have an incurable
habit of telling children not to play with matcher,,
should themselves be so blind to the perils of the
grown-up game of match-making. Aunt Maud (GRANT
KICIIAKDS) is a case in point. Having made up her mind
that her young cousin Richard and her pet niece Irene
were made for each other, she asked them down to her
little place in the country, and then actually proceeded
to let Irene into the secret of her darling project.
Naturally the girl jumped to the conclusion that her
proposed husband was also in
the plot, and Aunt Maud's
plan nearly came to grief at
the very start. But of course
the author, Mr. ERNEST OLD-
MEADOW, wasn't going to stand
any nonsense of that sort. So
he made Irene suggest to
Richard a sort of experimental
and strictly platonic engage-
ment, which either party could
terminate at will at the end of
a month. Eventually it worked
all right, though not before
Irene had told Richard that
she couldn't possibly be his
wife, thinking that the senti-
ment, which in her case was
real love, in his was only pity.
I think that Mr. OLDMEADOW
ought to be careful. In another
book, Susan, he played with a
fancifully elaborate plot with
some success. This time he
has invented a new and equally
complicated motif without
taking the trouble to do more
than re-christen his two chief
characters. And that seems
to me to be a waste of his
graceful style and real sense
of humour. I should recom-
mend him to change his flies
next time he goes a-fishing.

undergo some kind of vaccination (whence possibly the
phrase " calf-love ") in early youth. That seems to be the
moral of Mr. Saffery's Disciple (\VKUSEK LAURIE). For
Mr. Safjcry was, before all things, a man of method
and purpose, a vegetarian excessively particular about
his patent breakfast foods, a schoolmaster, and an en-
thusiast for culture. He attempted to educate Bob
Pottle, the boy-of-all-work, who "did" for him as a
lodger (Mrs. Pottle being too refined to work), and since
Mrs. PARRY TRUSCOTT, who tells us all about them, has
the delightful gift of elevating a pedestrian theme we
follow the process with a zeal entirely oblivious of the
flight of chapter a,nd page. By-and-by, of course, Bob
fell in love and as Mr. Saffery did not approve of the
young person he adopted the heroic device of rescuing
his pupil by a cutting-out expe-
dition. Naturally enough he lost
his own anchor, and wa leave
him at the end of the book
hopelessly at sea, in the depths
of an unreciprocated passion.
I am heartily sorry for Mr.
Saffcry, and until Mrs. THUS-
COTT writes a sequel to say
what happened to him (whether
he took up golf, for instance,
or started collecting butter-
flies) I shall not feel really
contented again.

I have often wondered (I can't
quite explain why) whether a
man called Alfred Milne would
have any chance of turning out
decently. Mr. FORD MADOX
HUEFFER thinks he would, to
judge from his book, Mr. Apollo
(METIIUEN). Mjlnc is a very
good sort indeed; no showy
graces, you understand, but
thoroughly sound, and an ex-
cellent host. In this capacity
you will agree that he was
severely tried when I mention
that for three weeks he enter-
tained Phoebus Apollo. Apollo
had turned his last host, Todd
the missionary, into a small
bay tree, and though this looked
nice in the window between
the lace curtains, still it wasn't
quite the same, you know. Any-
how Mr. and Mrs. Milne might well have felt nervous.
They were both such dears, however (particularly
Frances), that Apollo loved them, and he left them
with the promise that when the time came they should
die together. Well, I doubt if he could have
thought of a better gift. Mr. Apollo is not a farce. It
is a comedy, full of knowledge and sympathy, and
written with a quiet humour which the many will miss,
and the few appreciate the more for that reason. And if
I add that it reminds me a little of The Wonderful Visit
Mr. HUEFFER must take that also to his credit.

[SEPTEMBER 9, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM PERCY'S POINT OF VIEW.
I KNEW nobody in the quiot rural retreat where I had
taken rooms for the summer—nobody, that is, except
PERCY. He was my only caller. He came in after
breakfast one morning, through the window. It was
rather a casual way of making a first visit—but that was
not the reason why I abstained from asking him to sit
down. In any circumstances one would not think of
offering a chair to a Bee—which is what PERCY was.
He began buzzing in my ear, as bees commonly do,
but rather to my surprise, I discovered for the first time
in my life that I was perfectly familiar with Bee-
language.
I can't explain how it was, except by the fact that I
had just been reading Mr. TICKNER EDWARDES' fascina-
ting book, The Lore of the Honey-Bcc. And even that
does not fully account for my being able—as I was—
to make myself intelligible to PERCY. You must accept
this to begin with—or else we shall never get on.
PERCY—I should explain here that this is not the
precise name he gave me, but the nearest I can get to
it—PERCY was at first pardonably anxious to impress me
with the honour he was conferring upon me by his
visit. "You needn't rise," he said, after introducing
himself. "We '11 waive ceremony. Can't spare you
more than a minute or two. Must be getting back to
that Kingdom of mine. Any number of important State
affairs requiring attention. Tremendous amount of
work a Monarch in my position has to get through.
You 'd hardly believe it!"
"I don't," I said, deciding that it was necessary to put
him in his proper place at once. "It won't do, PERCY.
You 're no monarch—and you 've no more to do with
State affairs than I have!" For I needn't say that my
recently acquired knowledge had enabled me to recog-
nise him at once as a Drone.
He tried to bluster it out. "Well, if I 'm not exactly
a Monarch," he said, "I 've got Royal blood in me.
I 'm the son of a Queen. And that 's more than
you are."
"You know perfectly well, PERCY," I said, "that
every one of the—(how many are there?—forty or fifty
thousand?)—other members of your community can
claim precisely the same parentage. It 's quite useless
to put on side with me."
He tried to give himself a countenance by stroking his
thorax with his middle legs, but his big eyes could not
meet mine. If a bee is capable of blushing, I should say
that PERCY'S colour distinctly deepened. But all he
said was: "How the doocc did you know that?"
"Never you mind," I said, not feeling called upon
to mention my authority. "I happen to know, too,
that in your kingdom it 's the Bee-u-owen who do all
the work, and have all the power."
"Dash it all!" PERCY exclaimed, with a sudden
pettishness that was perhaps due to his chancing to
slip np just then on the butter-pat. "I set how it is.
Old CAROLINE or LOUISA" (I must again remark that
these may not have been the actual names he men-
tioned, but the sound was very similar) "must have
been here and given the show away!"
I assured him that I was unacquainted with either
lady. "Who are CAROLINE and LOUISA, PERCY?" I
enquired.
"Oh, a pair of old frumps who looked after me when
I was a larva—fed rne and that. Uncommon well they
did me, too. I it-ill say that for them. Though they
needn't have been so shirty over it." (The peculiar
Drone-slang which PERCY affected can only, I fear, be
approximately rendered.) "Groomed me, too, when I
first came out of the cell. Nasty way CAROLINE had of
fetching me a wipe with her great thick antennae if I
didn't 'come over' soon enough to please her; while
LOUISA had a doosid heavy hind-leg with the currycomb.
1 like to be well turned out—but there 's a limit, don't
you know! Always on the go, they were, feedin' the
grubs, sealin' 'em up, lettin' 'em out, and cleanin' up
after 'em, never kuockin' off for a moment. But
they 're all like that. CAROLINE and LOUISA went into
business afterwards—what they call '.Higher Work for
Women.' In the Pollen-trade, CAROLINE is. And how
that old girl does work! Makes me tired only to look
at her. No sooner has she staggered in and let LIZZIE
and SARAH empty her leg-baskets than she 's off again
for another load, and goes on at it all day till she 's
ready to drop. I often say to 'em: 'My good girls,
where 's the sense in it all?' I say. 'What do you get
by it? It's ruinin' your looks' (they never had
much to boast of—but of course 1 don't tell 'em
that), ' it 's upsettin' your nerves and spoilin' your tem-
pers. Look at JANE,' I say, ' forewoman of No. 5 Comb
before she 'd been born a fortnight, and an old woman
already, by gad! And MARY—there 's a fearful ex-
ample of the effects of overstudy for you. Passed out
first into the Architectural Department, when she was
a mere flapper just out of the chrysalis. Look at her
now! Can't calculate a single strain properly and gets
her hexagons all cock-eyed! She '11 have nervous break-
down next, MARY will! It 's a funny thing, but none
of you seem to me to be able to do anythin' without
ouer-doin' it, if you know what I mean!' But it 's DO
use my arguing with them. The whole lot of 'em are
as neurotic as be-blowed! Why, only yesterday, MARIA
—who 's got Italian blood in her, if that 's any excuse—
actually drew her sting on me simply because I com-
plained that I couldn't get a wink of sleep owin' to the
confounded row her gang made fanning all night!"
"But, my good PERCY," I said, "the hive must be
ventilated, you know. They have to fan their wings
so as to carry off all the vitiated air"—a piece of in-
formation for which I was indebted to The Lore of the
Honey-Bee.
"I dessay," he said, " I dessay; but it makes a most
infernal draught. I 'd a good deal sooner put up with a
little stuffiness than a stiff neck!"
"At all events, PERCY, I gather that yon can't com-
plain of being overworked," I remarked.
"Me?" he said. "Not much! Never did a stroke
of work in my life, and never shall. Not in my line,
dear boy !''
"But don't you ever feel a little ashamed," I said
(it was such a new experience to find myself giving a
moral lesson to a bee that I really couldn't resist it) "to
stand by and let those poor Bee-women do all the work
for you?"
"Why should I, dear old chap? " suid the impenitent
PERCY. "It 's their own choice. Besides, they 've got
all the tools. You won't find any combs or pliers or
pollen-baskets on my legs. And if I wanted to make
wax—which I don't—I haven't got the proper apparatus
for it. So what 's the point of pitching into me?"

And he was gone. T was not sure, even then, whether

but it was certainly in his favour that much that he
told me should be corroborated by a work he was hardly

AT THE PLAY.
I.—THE PASSING OF THE THIRD
FLOOR BACK.
I HAVE a very sincere sympathy
for the professional humorist who
wants to enjoy the Jester's privilege
of being taken seriously at times.
And if the author of Three Men in a
Boat felt inspired to make a stage
phantasy on the theme, "If Christ
came to Bloomsbury," I should be
the last to let his previous record
stand in his way; only I doubt if Mr.
JEROME K. JEROME'S hand has quite
the right subtlety for so perilous a
task. It is one to which the finer
intelligences must often have been
attracted, yet they seem to have
shrunk from its many pitfalls, and

hitherto generally left it to the
SIGISMUND GOKTXKS to rush in with
elephantine foot where angels feared
to tread.
Not that Mr. JEROME'S work has
been tactlessly done. It has its nice
touches, and it has its great moment
when the slatternly maid—and here
Miss GERTRUDE ELLIOTT acted with
a very noble intuition — tries in
vain to describe the aspect of the
Stranger who waits at the door.
The author has shown great courage
in choosing, for the scene of the
mystic "passing," a milieu that
is not only mean and sordid, but
abounding in ludicrous possibilities.
Indeed, it was only the infinite charm
and persuasiveness of Mr. FORBES
BOBERTSON (and no other living actor
could have even begun to play his
part) that carried the play success-
fully through situations which offered
themselves with a terrible nakedness
as a target for the humour of con-
trasts. Yet even so it was almost
impossible not to trace a note of irony
in the nattering appeals made by the
"Passer-by" to the beauty and
goodness that he found latent in each
nature.
Constructively the play lacked
variety. The types were sufficiently
numerous and distinct, but there was
a certain monotony in the Stranger's
method of treating, and disposing
of, each individual case in turn; a
certain sameness, too, in the form
of his appeal to their potentialities
for good.
I thought the author did not get
all the fun he might have got out of
his boarding-house in the First Act.
Possibly he found his sense of
humour a little restrained by the
seriousness of what was to come;
if so, he will perhaps kindly appre-
ciate the similar embarrassment
experienced by the more light-
hearted among his critics. Miss
AGNES THOMAS as the Landlady
played intelligently, and no great
fault was to be found with her
boarders, though Mr. MARSH ALLEN
never for a moment deceived me
into the belief that he bore any resem-
blance to an artist; and Miss ALICE
CRAWFORD hardly justified her de-
cription as a "Hussy," but was
content to pretend that she was
Miss CONSTANCE COLLIER, a very
different thing. My heart went out
with most sympathy to Mr. ERNEST
HENDRIE. Like the others he under-
went reform; but his face was never
strictly that of a saint, and his moral
improvement did not include the
restoration of a voice irrecoverably
lost during his experience as a book-
maker.
It was a pleasant idea to utilise
the foot-lights as a fire-place, and
have a fender inside - out against
them, and armchairs. But it was
very trying for the pe-son who had
been "a Painted Lady" to occupy
this exposed position, after removing
her rouge, and her yellow wig, thus
exchanging a material "transforma-
tion " for a spiritual one.
II.—WHAT EVERY WOMAN KNOWS.
THERE is something almost wor-
shipful about the man who has the
birthright of unconscious humour.
He is a type of Beneficence, flinging
its bounties broadcast, unaware of
its own generosity, its left hand
not knowing what its right is at.
He is not strictly an Olympian, for
Olympus laughed at its own jokes;
he is nevertheless god-like, and pro-
vokes in one a kind of respectful awe.
In Mr. BARRIE'S new play every
Scotsman has this splendid, this in-
human gift. Not one of them could
open his mouth without convulsing
his votaries in the audience; yet
they themselves remained stolidly
unmoved by their own scintillations.
(I bow to Mr. BARRIE'S special know-
ledge of his own countrymen. No
one else could persuade me that there
is such a thing as a Scotsman with-
out a sense of humour.) Up to the
final curtain there was only one
character that either laughed or
tried to be the cause of laughter in
other characters, and she was the
Comtesse de la Brie re, palpably an
exotic. It is true that Maggie Shand,
though a Scot, had a sense of humour

concealed about her, but the admis-
sion of it was only wrung from her
at the very end, when she wrongly
imagined that her whole future hap-
piness depended on her husband's
ability to see through the most trans-
parent joke that was ever made. It
was her first success.
Yet when I conjecture of the
sequel I am filled with forebodings.
In one tragic moment John Shand
had not only had his profound belief
in himself irreparably damaged, but
had tarnished his hitherto unspotted
incapacity for seeing a joke. These
were the two superb qualities which
had supplied his faithful wife with
her best reason for existence. And
now her occupation was gone. If he
could only have eloped with the lady
who never rightly appreciated him,
his unconquerable denseness and self-
conceit might have been a lovely

memory for Maggie's declining years.
But it was not to be.
The First Act, with its purely
Scots interest, was a very perfect
ihing. Here Mr. BARRIE was seen
in his most characteristic mood of
freshness and temerity. Afterwards
the play, though never dropping
into mere conventionality, introduced
certain social elements in which Mr.
BAKKIE is seldom quite at his best.
Apart from the Scots characters,
there was scarcely one that seemed
altogether probable. Yet the scheme
throughout was handled with a very
subtle finesse, and the alternations
of sentiment and humour jarred less
than usual. For when once Maggie
had promised that in the event of
her husband's preference for a more
attractive woman she would behave
differently from other wives one was
prepared for anything.
The interpretation was of the most
sympathetic; though perhaps Mr.
NORMAN FORBES, as the Cabinet
Minister, lacked assurance, and Mrs.
TREE'S performance was a little
wanting in that repose which is
proper to a Comtesse. Mr. EDMUND
GWEN.V, as the younger of the
brothers Wylic, showed with admir-
able force that even among those
who are impervious to humour there
may be degrees of opaqueness.
The enthusiasm with which the
great performances of Miss HILDA
TREYELYAN and Mr. GERALD DU
MAURIER were received was sincere
and universal. Miss TKEVELYAN, it
seemed, had much tho harder task,

the art of making the most difficult
things seem ridiculously easy.

one of them will very kindly tell me.

CRUELTY TO VEGETABLES.
REMARKABLE MEETING OF PROTEST.
A GREAT meeting was held on
Friday last in the grill-room of the
Cannon Street Hotel to protest
against the excesses committed by
extreme vegetarians. Amongst those
present were Sir JAMES CRICHTON-
BROWNE, who presided, Sir CECIL
SPRING-RICE, Mr. PEARS, Mr. FITTER,
Mr. HARRIS (the Sausage King), Sir
ALFRED JONES (the Banana King),
Mr. BEERBOIIM TREE, Miss MAUD
ALLAN, Mr. BERNARD SHAW, LA LOIE
FULLER, Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON, Miss
ISADORA DUNCAN, Mr. ALFRED NUTT,
and the JAM SAHIB.
Sir JAMES CRICHTON-BROWNE said
that they were met together to dis-
charge a public duty imposed on
them by the momentous utterance
of Mr. FRANCIS DARWIN, the Presi-
dent of the British Association.
The evidences which that illustrious
botanist had been able to furnish
which pointed to the existence of
consciousness in plants—their intelli-
gent habits, irritability, powers of
sleep, and so on — had suddenly
awakened the national conscience to
the horrible iniquities of vegetarians,
and above all fruitarians. Let
them clear their minds of cant.
He was, as they all knew, a con-
vinced carnivore, and he had no
intention of giving up chops whether
with or without the accompaniment
of tomato sauce. But between the
consumption, on the one hand, of
meat or vegetables which had been
humanely slaughtered and, on the
other, the barbarous habit of eating
the raw Hesh of live fruit, there was
ail impassable gulf. The latter prac-
tice was no better than cannibalism
in its worst form. In conclusion, he
moved a resolution in favour of the
establishment of a Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Vegetables.
Mr. FITTER, who seconded the re-
solution, said that he had been pro-
foundly moved by Mr. DARWIN'S
address. In his thoughtless youth,
he owned it with remorse and con-
trition, he had often eaten raw
turnips, but never again would he be
guilty of such savagery. As an in-
stance of the extraordinary inconsist-
ency of which people were capable,
he mentioned that he had good
reason to believe that Mr. STEPHEN
COLERIDGE, the arch - anti - vivisec-
tionist, was in the habit of mash-
ing potatoes before he ate them.
(Groans.)
Mr. HARRIS, the Sausage King,
rose to protest. With the principles
advocated by the chairman he was
in complete accord. But in no pro-
perly-conducted kitchen that he knew
of were potatoes mashed while they
were alive. In his own, for instance,
there was a special lethal chamber
where they passed away painlessly
to the sound of slow music. (Ap-
plause.) He took no credit to him-
self for this arrangement, but could
not help contrasting it with the prac-
tice of Mr. EUSTACE MILES, who
openly boasted of devouring live
gooseberries-—a notoriously sensitive
and intelligent fruit. Personally, he
thought a greengrocer's shop-front
far more revolting than a butcher's.
Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON here inter-
posed and asked the Chairman
whether it was a fact that vegetables
could commit suicide; but his ques-
tion was ruled out of order.
Miss MAUD ALLAN pronounced her-
self in sympathy with the movement.
She added that when she lunched
at the PRIME MINISTER'S house she
especially noticed that the salad was
not dressed and the potatoes were
denuded of their jackets. (Cries of
"Question!" from Miss ISADORA
DUNCAN and Miss LOIE FULLER.)
Mr. BERNARD SHAW, rising from
the body of the hall amid a storm
of hisses, said he wished to make a
personal explanation. It was true
that he was a vegetarian. (Groans.)
It was not true, as some people
thought, that the Fabian Society was
derived from the Latin word faba—
a bean. Personally he never took
beans: he only gave them to his
friends. (Applause.) But the object
of his intervention was to state that
for some time past he had lived ex-
clusively on macaroni, and that the
method of reaping the wheat from
which it was made was as painless
a mode of extinguishing life as that
of the guillotine. (Interruption.)
As the tumult did not cease on
Mr. SHAW'S resuming his seat, Mr.
A. C. BF.NSON appealed to the audi-
ence to be reasonable. He was sure,
he added, that they would be glad
to learn that two out of the eleven
volumes from his pen which would
appear this autumn were in harmony
with the aims of this movement,
viz., The Private Diary of a Parsnip
and The Musings of an Introspective
Vegetable Marrow. (Great enthu-
siasm.)
Mr. BEERBOIIM TREE said that both
by temperament and nomenclature
he sympathised deeply with all sen-
sitive plants. There was a story
of a bad actor who had so many
vegetables thrown at him that he
left the stage and set up as a green-
grocer; but personally he had never

suffered in this way. At the same
time he found that the spectacle of
people eating oranges in the gallery
affected him so painfully that he had
forbidden the practice in his theatre.
(Loud cheers.)
Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON, again inter-
posing, asked the chairman whether
any cruelty was involved in eating
Welsh rabbit; but this question was
ruled out of order.
Miss ISADORA DUNCAN having given
a short but masterly account of the
indebtedness of the true school of
classical dancing to the jumping
bean, Sir JAMES CRICHTON-BROWNE
put the resolution to the vote, and it
was carried with only one dissentient.
Most of those present then formed a
procession, marched westward, and
made a hostile demonstration outside
.the Eustace Miles Restaurant, but
happily no lives were lost.

"THE GREY UNDERWORLD."
II.—THE WOMAN WHO HAD DONE
WITH SMILES.
HER name was Mrs. GRUMBY, and
she lived opposite a pickle factory,
and had a bed-sitting room to let.
PONKER had been trying to improve
his acquaintance with the "under-
world" of London by going about
and beguiling harmless landladies
into the belief that he wanted lodg-
ings, tempting them, in this way, to
gossip about themselves and their
lodgers in a manner that would fur-
nish copy for the all-important book.
He liked Mrs. GRUMBY'S face at once,
because she looked as though the
iron had entered into her soul; and
he particularly wished to study
someone whose soul had been
entered by the iron.
Mrs. GRCMBY showed PONKER her
"bed-sit" (as, I believe, the news-
paper advertisements have it), and
POXKER looked from the "bed-sit"
to her, and felt more certain than
over that the iron had entered into
her soul. But of that she said no-
thing, merely asking him if he would
want hot dishes for breakfast, be-
cause, if so, that would be an extra;
but most of her gentlemen had been
content with sardines.
Not wishing to make life seem
darker for one in her melancholy
state, PONKEH said that he too
always ate sardines for breakfast; he
was, in fact, a whale for sardines.
Of course, he doesn't generally
permit himself to make jokes of this
elementary character; it was simply
intended as a test; and Mrs. GRUMBY
passed the test triumphantly, emerg-
ing, in PONKER'S estimation, as " the
Woman who had Done with Smiles."
After that, PONKER sat down in the
"bed-sit's" easiest chair, to talk.
Mrs. GRUMBY might possibly be worth
a chapter all to herself.
POXKEK admitted to me later that
she was not very communicative, and
he had to fill in a good deal of her
story himself. Her face told him
more than her lips, he said. It must
have been a very speaking face, in-
deed, because it told him, amongst
other things, how she had once been
a light-hearted girl in the West
Country, breaking the hearts of all
the young farmers in her neighbour-
hood, until handsome JACK GRUMBY
had come a-wooing — GRUMBY, the
smart commercial who put up at the
King's Head. (How could her face
give such positive information as to
the name of the inn? Frankly, I
don't know. You must ask PONKER.)
She had made a runaway match of
it with JACK, without her father's
blessing, and before she realised that
JACK GRUMBY'S heart was very much
at the service of any pretty, come-by -
charice acquaintance. Ah! she knew
that later, when he fled to America
with " the other woman," leaving her
stranded opposite a pickle factory,
to do the best she could for herself
and her child. No wonder she had
forgotten how to smile!
When Mrs. GRUMBY'S face had got
thus far with her story, PONKER rose,
and said that he'\tould write in the
morning; which meant, of course,
that the room wouldn't suit him.
He was about halfway down the
stairs, preceding Mrs. GRUMBY, when

he heard, he tolls me, a sound behind'
him, as if Mrs. GRUMBY had tried to
speak, but had been choked by
sudden mirth.
He looked round sharply, but her
face was in shadow.
"I beg your pardon. Did you
speak?" he asked.
Mrs. GRUMBY made no reply, and,
thinking it was not laughter but tears
that checked her utterance—perhaps
something about his back had sud-
denly reminded her of JACK GRUMBY
—he delicately hastened from the
house—as soon, at least, as he had
mastered the very complicated front-
door latch.
But that stifled sound that he had
heard on the staircase haunted him.
Had Mrs. GRUMBY, in spite of all her
face had told him, laughed? If so,
the mystery of it was great. What
was there, for example, to laugh at?
He had not walked very far from
the house when a perfect frenzy of
curiosity impelled him to return to
its doorstep. It would be easy to
make some excuse for seeing Mrs.
GRVMBY again, and then perhaps he
might be able to deduce from her!
manner why she had snorted on the
staircase—whether in sorrow or in
mirth.
As he raised the knocker he heard
a muffled sound of laughter within.
It rose—it increased in volume-^-it
was a duet! The raised knocker fell
from his nerveless hand, and instantly
there was silence. After the lapse of
a minute the door was opened, not by
Mrs. GRUMBY, but by her daughter.
She was a presentable girl so far as
PONKER could judge, but she had a
handkerchief pressed tightly against
her mouth, hiding half her face.
"I forgot to ask your mother,"
said PONKER severely, " whether you
have a bath—hot and cold?"
She swayed, like standing corn in
tempest; and then she made three
attempts to answer him :—
"Oh yes, we have We have
a We have a—ba-ha-ha-ha-
hath!"
PONKER left the door sadly. He
had lost an illusion. No "Woman
who had Done with Smiles" could
have had a daughter like that.
After reaching home in a cab, he
detached from the back buttons of
his coat, to which it had affixed itself
as he sat in Mrs. GRUMBY's chair, an
antimacassar of such revolting hide-
ousness that he stared at it aghast—•
a thing compact of crochet-work
oyster-shells, and with the hues of
some portentous sunset. (Some day,
when the church at the end of the
street has a sale of work, PONKER is
going to send it in as his contribu-
tion; and then, he says, the church-
wardens or other responsible autho-
rities will bitterly repent of having
rung the bells whenever he sat down
to write.)
As for Mrs. GRUMBY, PONKER says
he is beginning to wonder if the
people of the "Grey Underworld"
differ very much from the shallowest
of the Smart Set in their notions of

AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
IT is announced that Mr. JOHN D.
ROCKEFELLER'S autobiography will be
published in twelve languages simul-
taneously this month. Will it be
anything like this?—
CHAPTER I.
BIRTH.
I WAS born with a silver spoon
in my mouth. One of my earliest
toys was a golden calf. I still have
it.
CHAPTER II.
PARENTAGE.
I AM descended on one side from
a thrifty and industrious Scotch
stock; on the other, from the famous
KILMANSEGO family.
My instructors never ceased to
instil in me the importance of eco-
nomy and vigilance.
"Many a mickle," they used to
say, "makes a muckle."
"Money," they used to say,
"begets money."
"Money," they said, " is the only
monarch."
"Money," they said, "is wel-
come, though it comes in a dirty
clout."
I never forgot those remarks.
They sank into my system and bore
fruit. I am now the richest man
in the world. The only thing I
regret is that those old counsellors
did not tell me how to keep my
digestion and my hair. Both have
gone. The hair trouble one can
remedy with a wig; but there is no
substitute for a missing digestion.
CHAPTER III.
BOYHOOD.
MY boyhood was happy. Most of
the technique of business may be
learned when at school by an ob-
servant lad; and I was observant.
I did a successful trade in marbles
and sweets. I lent money to other
boys at a good rate of interest, and
rarely returned home in the evening
without having added to my pro-
perty. In this way by the time that
ordinary boys are still doing foolish
things I was in possession of a
capital of two hundred dollars, and
held I.O.U.s from most of my
schoolfellows.
CHAPTER IV.
PETROLEUM.
THE most eventful moment of my
life was that in which I chanced
upon rock oil.
I was walking one day in the
neighbourhood of my home in moody
silence. Everything was going wrong
with me. My business was yielding
only 98 per cent, instead of the
100 on which I had set my heart,
and I was in despair. Ruin stared
me in the face. Passing through a
field I happened to see a spring
bubbling from the ground, but I
thought nothing of it (as it was not
large enough to drown myself in),
until a little later a poor old woman
stopped me and begged an alms. I
obviously had no money to give her,
as I made clear; but wishing to do
what I could I offered to get her a
cup of cold water, it being my steady
practice to do what I can for my
fellow - creatures. She was very
grateful, and I ran to the stream and
dipped into it a pocket drinking-cup.
Judge of my surprise when I found
that instead of water it was oil! In
an instant I realised the situation,
and returning swiftly to town I found
the owner of the property, and, suc-
cessfully disguising my motives, pur-
chased not only this particular field
but all those around it. My fortune
was made.
CHAPTER V.
THE STANDARD OIL TRUST.
AFTER the discovery of the rock-oil
spring, perhaps the most eventful
and wonderful moment of my life
was that in which I first hit upon
the idea of a Trust. It is a beautiful
word, Trust, and I have often taken
it as a text in my Sunday - school
addresses. Trust. We must all trust
in something or someone. What
could be more desirable in a world
of darkness, disappointment and flux
than that there should be one man
to be relied upon for light? Relied
upon. Many men have offered light
to their groping fellows and have not
given it: this man would be trust-
worthy.
Coming down to a material plane
from these symbolical heights, what
does light proceed from? From oil.
The man, then, who could so mani-
pulate things that he owned all the
oil would automatically be the one
person who could give the light. Do
you see? He would form an Oil
Trust, as we say in America, and
illuminate the world.
I, I decided, would be that man;
not because I wanted the power or
wealth that such a position would
carry with it, but because if I, a
chapel-going, reputable citizen and
Sunday - school superintendent, re-
nowned for his simple and frugal life,
filled the place, I should prevent its
being filled by anyone who was un
scrupulous or rapacious.
Having made this decision, I at
once began to lay my plans, and the
Standard Oil Trust was the result.
CHAPTER VI.
MY AMUSEMENTS.
I AM very fond of reading the
papers, particularly the finance
columns.
CHAPTER VII.
MY ENEMIES.
I HAVE, of course, had my enemies,
as every successful and determined
man must. But where are they
now? I, however, am here, and
worth sixty millions sterling.
Chief among them was President
ROOSEVELT; and what is he to-day?
A figure pour rirc, at the end of his
term of office; a hunter of bears;
the nation's "TEDDY." No one ever
called me " TEDDY," or even " JACK."
CHAPTER VIII.
MY AMBITION.
I COULD, if I liked, buy England;
but I don't want it. All I want is a
cosy little house and a nice uncom-
fortable pew in the Baptist chapel,
and the knowledge that no one can
light a paraffin lamp without putting
something into my pocket. And of
course I want also some substantial
royalties on this book.

DISCURSIONS,
JOE BULLER'S GHOST.
"YES," said the pale young Stor-kjobber, " if, "a a funny
thing about JOE BULLEK. Not knovr bin? Why, you
must have seen him any day these last ten years going
up by the nine o'clock, and coming back by the 5.30.
A great big chap with a red face and a heavy moustache;
a scar on his right cheek. Used to wear heavy over-
coats in winter with huge saucer buttons, and always
had his top-hat on one side. When he met a chap he
knew, he always gave him a bang on the back and called
out, 'What price that?' That's how he got his
name, 'WHAT PKICE JOE.' Ah, I thought you 'd have
heard of him even if you hadn't seen him.
"Well, it 's a funny thing about him. Ho 's doing a
rest cure or something, because he 's got in a way of
being haunted by a ghost. Fancy JOE seeing a ghost!
What made it pick old 'WHAT PRICE' is what I can't
make out—a good shot and not a bad man after hounds
either — he used to go
with the stag when he
was a bit lighter—and
a thumping voice for a
song. It wasn't as if
he 'd been a bad lot
either. I daresay he
didn't go to church too
much, you know, but he
was jolly free with his
money. He 's got a
yacht lying at South-
ampton now, but he
hasn't been aboard of her
this season. Too much
of the ghost business
for that.
I mean, bits about the Law and the Blood, and one
topper about a banjo that fairly made your hair curl.
It used to go right through me, and made everybody sit
up no end when JOE spouted it.
"JOE was the very devil in the House. The Kaffir
market was his lay, and when the boom was on he
roared and bellowed so that you couldn't hear anybody
else—and, mind you, they were all pretty good at
making a row, but JOE beat the lot. That 's where he
made his pile. Later on, of course, he dropped a bit,
but nothing to matter. He could always keep going by
pinning slips of paper on old gentlemen's coat-tails and
getting them alight, or dancing round some fellow who 'd
got engaged to be married, and singing, Listen to the
Voice of Love with half-a-dozen other mad chaps. It
was enough to make a cat laugh.
*;•-
"JOE was the chap
who knocked my hat off
on Mafeking night. I
was singing and shout-
ing with the rest when
I saw a big fellow with
a false nose and a
coster-girl's hat on his head come rolling across the
street at me. He 'd got a tin trumpet to his mouth and
he was making it hum all it was worth, I tell you. I
tried to get out of his way, but he wouldn't have it. He
roared out, ' What price that? ' and away went my hat.
I knew who it was then. He knocked off thirty-five hats
that night and thirty-two on Ladysmith night. He was
the most patriotic chap I over knew. He founded the
Imperial All Red League. They used to meet once a
month and had a gold badge with a lion on it. It-
was dinners mostly, not ordinary meetings, dinners with
any amount of buzz—wine and red-hot patriotic songs.
JOE used to sing, Give the Foreign Beggars Brans. It
was one of his best songs.

"I think the beginning of the whole thing was about
six months ago, when JOE found a Frenchman bigger
and stronger than himself. This Frenchman's name
was JOOLS something or
other, but JOE always
called him Mossco or
ALPHONSE, with ALF for
short sometimes. He
was over here learning
the language, and he
wasn't a bad chap for a
foreigner. JOE used to
have no end of larks
with him, joking about
frogs and snails and that
sort of thing, till one day
they got to matching one
another at wrestling,
and before you could say
'Knife' JOOLS had put
JOE on his back twice.
Lady Amateur Artist (to eminent, Royal Academician, irjmm she lias
discovered sketching). "I SAY, I SHOULDN'T PAINT THAT SUBJECT IF I
WEKE YOB. I DID ONE OF IT LAST YEAR, AND HAD IT CHUCKED AT
THK 'R. A.'"
"JOE always said he couldn't stand poetry and slop
of that sort, but he was dead nuts on KIPLING. Ho 'd
got an tdition-dc-luxc of KIPLING in his library and the
Encyclopedia Britannica and the hack volumes of Ruff's
Guide and The Sportsman for the last fifteen years. You
couldn't beat him about a poem of KIPLING'S or a horse's
handicap. He knew 'em all, arid sometimes he used to
recite 'em—no, not the weights—KIPLING'S poems,
"It gave me quite a
turn to see it, the
beggar did it so neatly.
'Aha, my JOHN BTLL,'
he said, 'you have
enough? Or shall I
reverse you again?' I remember his lingo, and how
queer it sounded while JOE was picking himself up. JOE
took it very well. He said JOOLS was the pluckiest
Frenchman he 'd ever met, and he gave him a rouning
good dinner at the Savoy. I was there; arid I noticed
JOE wasn't himself—sort of quiet and under the
weather. He tried to sing a bit of the Marseillaise
afterwards, But it was no go. He broke down and
dropped his head on the table and began to sob like a
baby. We covered it up as much as we could by singing
Rule Britannia, but it didn't amount to much. I never
thought JOE would have felt it so much, but of course
it must have been pretty riling for him to be turned
over before a lot of his pals by a Parlyvoo.
"Well, soon after that JOE came up to me one
morning and didn't bang me on the back or play any
of his jokes. He looked pale and he hadn't shaved.
First he talked about the weather, and then at last it
all came out. He told me he hadn't slept the last four
nights on account of seeing a ghost—no, not the
GERMAN EMPEROR or anything of that sort, but a little
thin old woman with long grey hair and a white dress.

He said she 'd been coming regularly at two o'clock in
the morning. Last night he 'd tried not going to bed,
but she came just the same to his smoking-room. He
said he knew she was a ghost because he could see
things through her. She hadn't spoken yet, he said,
but if she did he thought it would finish him. After a
week or two more he chucked going up to London, and
then he had to have the doctors in. They tell me he 's
a bit better now. P'raps the old woman 's taking a
holiday. Anyhow it 's a deuced queer thing for a chap
like JOE to get haunted. Ah, well, here we are at

AN AUTUMN REVERIE.
WHEN the Spring is diffusing her sprightly
New spirit on all that 's alive;
When the song of the sparrow turns lightly
To love—about five;
When the charms these emotions induce urge
The young man of parts to resume
Like a robe, with his flannels and blue serge,
Love's annual bloom;
Then, beginning in May as a rule, I
Myself would awake to the call,
And in June, or at latest in July,
Love held me in thrall.
Ah, thos? halcyon summers! How fleetly
The year galloped on to its prime!
What a handful is Love! How completely
It filled up one's time!
Not a year but I poured my devotion,
Like wine, on the fair and the young,
From a heart that with lively emotion
Was full to the bung.
And though, doomed as they were to disaster,
My spirits were apt to rebel,
They recovered, if anything, faster
Than ever they fell;
And the time would go 011 till again Spring
Hose up and—I never knew how,
But it started me off like a mainspring;
It never does now!
For—alas, for the sombre confession—•
Whore, where is the magic of yore?
It has failed for three years in succession,
And this '11 make four.
'Tis in vain that I meditate numbly
On where the hiatus can be;
If the ladies are growing uncomely,
Or if it 's in me.
Can the taste have diminished, the nutty
Old feelings be lost to a heart
That was dough to receive, putting putty
Entirely apart?
'Tis a dark and Insoluble mystery;
It throws my wholp year out of joint;
It 's opposed to the teachings of history
(Though that 's not the point),
And my days are perceptibly duller;
My being grows vnpicl and slack;
And I 'm rapidly getting pff colour.
And losing the knack, DuM-DuM.

(By Mr- PwicVs Staff qf Learned
THE mi-nage i b<(&s "" tup to*" Msayy Cot (I think I
have that right} consisted of David Boicden, his sister
Rlioda (a cold and beautiful mrsoganust), and his wife
Margaret. David was one of those solid, stolid people who
are always trying to get on, and as his sister was the one
better able to help him on his farm it was his wife who
got out of it rather. The fourth principal was Hartley
Crocker, a brighter lighter-minded man than David;
and of course you guess that he and Margaret . . . But
there you are wrong; Hartley w?as in love with Rhoda.
Margaret (the dear) did her best to help him—partly
because she could not resist a romance, partly because
the home would have been happier with Rlioda away.
But Rhoda would have none of any man. Worse—after
refusing Hartley twice she began to suspect (just as you
did) that there was something bet\veen him and
Margaret; not know-
ing that the con-
versation at their
many meetings was
entirely about her-
self. In the end
she denounces her
sister - in - law, and
Margaret, fearing
that David will not
believe in her in-
nocence, drowns her-
self, lihoda, learn-
ing that she is
missing, suggests to
her brother (who
has just found the
body) that she has
run away with Bart-
ley; and then at
last David turns
upon her and calls

been longing to call her all through the book. The
Virgin in Judgment (CASSELL) is Mr. EDEN PIIILLPOTTS
at his very best. He has told a fine story, and has not
overweighted it with descriptions of Dartmoor scenery.
In the earlier chapters there is a great account of the
prize-fight between Hartley and David. 1 wanted
Hartley to win, but I knew he wouldn't; so that even
in this Mr. PHILLPOTTS did not disappoint me.
EILEEN FITZGERALD, if I may guess,
Is very earnest, and rather young,
And she bus heard of the emptiness
Of life on the topmost rung;
And so, with many an unshed tear,
And many a stifled sigh,
She has stripped it bare of its gay veneer
In The Heart of a Butterfly.
The " Butterfly "—one of the Upper Ten-
Behaves as no well-bred insect ought;
She tramples about on the hearts of men
Like a regular Juggernaut;
And though her troublesome sister Kale

A harvest of dull remorse.
One of the characters in Patsy (FISHER UNWIN)
declares that the Irish gossoon to whom the book owes
its name is a compound of MACHIAVELLI, BISMARCK, Puck
and one of SHAKSPEARE'S fools, all compressed into a
page-boy in buttons. This is pretty well for a beginning.
But anyone who possesses as extensive a knowledge of
men and of books as Mr. H. DE VERB STACPOOLE,
Patsy's creator, could easily add several'more names to
the list, including Handy Andy, Oliver Twist (in the
burglary episode at Mrs. Maylic's), Flurry Knox, the
page - boy in the
play of Sherlock
Holmes, and Mr.
WINSTON CIIUBCHILL.
Patsy is always
putting his finger
into other people's
pies. If they are
nice people he gives
them the plums. If
they are not he gives
them beans. Artisti-
cally he is a com-
posite photograph
rather than a por-
trait painted from
life. I see that some
of the critics find in
this dish of Irish
stew an aldermanic
feast of humour. I

jokes, such, for instance, as sticking corks into old
ladies' ear-trumpets, are funny, of course; otherwise
they would not be called jokes. But they are funnier,
as a rule, to play or see played than to read about,
unless one has had a particularly good night. So for my
part I find the love-story in which Patsy officiates as pro-
vidence more to my taste than his Handy Andy pranks.
I don't think any outsider could possibly hope to keep
track of all the ramifications of gossip and scandal in an
English village, so I take no blame to myself that at
times I was a little bit bewildered by the maze of petty
schemes which are afoot in the piece of Thames valley
charmingly drawn in The Easy-Go-Luckies (MBTHOKH).
Nor do I blame Mrs. STEPNEY RAW SON either, for I take
it that, though she herself keeps a marvellously clear
head throughout, a sense of mild bewilderment in the
side issues is exactly what she aims at producing. The
main idea—Hazel Luck's love affairs—is clear enough,
and Hazel is a dear. She and her family are as large as
life, and the many local intriguers are as small. The
tale is, in fact, a chronicle of small beer, but Mrs.
RAW SON pours out the liquor with so much laughter that
it seems to have more body and head than many drinks
i which are ostensibly more exhilarating.

HOW PERCY PROPOSED.
LITTLE as I expected to see any more of FEKCY, he
flew in again the very next day while I was at lunch.
I guessed at once from the flurried indecision with which
he circled about my table, that something of an un-
pleasant nature must have happened to him.
"Don't mind me, dear boy," he said; "I'm a bit
upset. Tell you all about it presently, when I 've calmed
down."
I waited until he became sufficiently collected on the
breast of a cold chicken to redeem his promise.
"First thing this morning," he began, "those old
vinegar-bottles of mine" (which, I regret to say, was
PERCY'S disrespectful term for the austere but estimable
Bee-spinsters who attended on him) "routed me out,
before I was half awake, and as soon as I 'd done break-
fast, began givin' me no end of a wash and brush up.
Said I 'd got to be made as presentable as possible,
because I was to start off for a neighbourin' State, that
very mornin' to propose to one of the young Princesses!
'Won't it do some other mornin"?' I said, for I was
feelin' rather slack. 'No, it ti-on't, so there!' snaps
EMILY. 'Sooner you 're married and done for the
better,' puts in MAKTHA. 'But why are you all so jolly
keen on my marry in".' ' I asked 'cm. 'For the good of
the State, of course,' says EMILY. 'If you and your
brother Drones don't marry, how do you suppose the
population of this hive is goiu' to be kept up?' Plain-
spoken party, EMILY. 'I see,' said I. 'Then, when
I marry my Princess, I bring her home here, and we
sot up house together. What?' 'Nothing of the sort,'
says EMILY. 'As if any foreign Princess would be ad-
mitted here! She'd be stabbed to death. After the
ceremony, she goes back to her own people, naturally.'
But, my dear girl,' I said, ' if that 's so, p'raps you '11
kindly explain how, supposin' there xliould happen to be
any little hostages to fortune, they 're going to increase
the birth-rate in f/u'« particular hive?'
"And what did EMILY say to that?" I asked with
some curiosity; for, oddly enough, this very difficulty
had occurred to me in reading Mr. TICKNF.R EIJWAHDES"
explanation of the Worker-bees' motives for tolerating
Drones.
"Oh, only somethin' about its being like my impu-
dence to question the wisdom of laws that had been
settled ages before I was born or thought of," said
PERCY. "Catch them admittin' themselves in the
wrong! But, when you leave these things to be man-
aged by a pack of eld maids, they "re bound to make
name silly mistake. Well, they bundled me out through
the gates on to the terrace, and there 1 found Gus, and
REGGIE, and BERTIE, and a few more of my pals, all of
'em groomed up to the nines, and no more inclined to
tjo courtin' foreign Princesses than I was. Still, as all
our old sour-faces seemed to make such a point of it, we
agreed it was best to humour 'em. In fact, we jolly
well couldn't help ourselves, for they 'd given us a
shove-off before we knew where we were.
We got to the neighbourin' Bee-state right enough,
nn.l introduced ourselves and that, and then we were
presented to the Princesses. A regular be.vy they were!
And I don't mind tellin' you it was a revelation to me.
You see, brought up ns I 've been, 1 'd never seen what I
call a really decent-looking bee—except of course my
Lady - Mother, who 's a fine figure of a bee still, but
gettin' on, you know. I 'd expected they 'd be some-
thing like old LOUISA. And I found they were simply
rippers! But there was one in particular that bowled
me over at first sight. The Princess SACCIIAUISSA, iter
name was, and the minute I saw her I felt myself goin'
at every one of my knees. And without wishin' to seem
conceited, old fellow," said PERCY, stroking what I
imagine he regarded as his moustache, " I could tell by
her eyes that she 'd noticed me, don't you know. Per-
haps you mayn't have heard how these weddin' cere-
monies are managed? It 's like this . . . ."
PERCY'S description of these State functions did not
differ materially from that given by Mr. EDWARDES.
That is, there is a kind of aerial Atalanta race, in which
the suitor swift enough to overtake the flying Princess
is officially recognised as her Prince Consort.
"REGGIE, and BERTIE, and Gus, and several fellows
I didn't know," he proceeded, " all decided, like me, to
go in for SACCHARISSA; and, as soon as she 'd had a fair
start, the word was given and off we all went. She was
a flier, and no mistake! High up in the air, and out of
sight in no time! The pace was too hot for most of the
crowd; they tailed off one after another, till there was
no one really in the flyin' but Gus, and REGGIE, and
BERTIE, and me.. I didn't feel much afraid of any of
'em. I knew I was goin' fairly strong, and presently
REGGIE sprained his under-wing, and Gus tripped up
over a floating cobweb and had to retire, and there was
only old BERTIE poundin' on alongside, and I could see he
was gettin' blown. And at last he had to give up and
go home, after wishin' me luck, like the sportsman
he is.
"I was gainin' on SACCHARISSA with every wing-drive,
and she knew it, too. But she meant givin' me all the
trouble she could before she gave in—downright little
coquette, she was! I didn't worry; somehow I knew it
was goin' to be all right. So it irould have been, if she
hadn't dodged just at the moment when I thought I was
going to catch her up. That wouldn't have signified, only
she was looking back over her shoulder at me, and
didn't see where she was goin', I suppose. Anyhow,
she dodged right into the open bill of a great beast of a
bird. . . . And that was the end of her!"
Condoling with a bereaved lover who has just lost his
intended bride in the inside of a bird is necessarily a
delicate business; but I said all that could be said.
"Yes," said PERCY, " it was pretty sickenin'. W'hat?
Though, come to think of it, it might have been worse.
It might have been me!"
I was a little disappointed in him, though I admitted
that of course there was that way of looking at the
matter.
"You sec," he continued, "knowin' all I do now
has sot me thinkin'. Chances are, if I had married her,
she 'd have been a merry widow by this time! Be-
cause, it 's rather a rum thing, but there were several of
these State weddin's this mornin', and from all I make
out, not a blessed bridegroom has got home alive! If
that 's matrimony, old EMILY and MARTHA might have
given me the tip beforehand! I assure you, old fellow,
it 's quite shaken my nerve. Most awful narrow escape
I 've had!
I recollected that in The T^ore of the Honey-Bce the
inevitable death of the accepted suitor appeared to be
the one cloud upon the complete felicity of the honey-
moon.
"You '11 find some honey on the table, PERCY," I
said. "Try a drop of that."
He clambered on to the edge of the neat wooden case,
and inspected its contents with the eye of an expert.
"If they 've told you that 's honey," he said, " they 've
taken you in, dear old chap. It 's Aphis syrup—if it

in common decency they ought to give me time to get

Princesses. What ?''
"But when they do, PERCY," I asked, " what then?"
He made a movement, with one of his eye-facets that
seemed to be intended as a wink.
"Well," he said, "if I ever do go after a Princess
again, I shouldn't wonder if some other fellow got ahead
of me. But I shall put in most of the time with you,
old boy, if you don't mind havin' me."
I assured him he would always find a welcome.

THROUGH A DRAMA FACTORY.
"I WILL show you over our works
with pleasure," said the Manager of
the Melodrama Trading and Manu-
facturing Co., Ltd. "We are excep-
tionally busy just now, as the hurri-
cnne success of Pete at the Lyceum
has brought us in a number of rush
orders for rechauffes. In particular,
our staff are working overtime on a
new version of The Rubber King."
"The Rubber King? " I queried.
"Formerly known as The Silver
Kitty, but it has, of course, to be
brought out under a new title. If
our men keep up to schedule time"
—the Manager fingered a time-sheet
thoughtfully—" same will be finished
inside of four days. Would you care
to hear how we put a rush job
through?"
"Certainly."
"The scenario is planned out by
myself in consultation with our chief
carpenter, chief electrician and pro-
perty manager. Then the scenes are
divided up, each being marked with
the proper job number to prevent any
mistake in the assembling room, and
given out to the head of our com-
posing department for distribution
amongst his staff. If you will step
this way you will see the department
at work."
A deafening click and whirr of
typewriters swept in through the
opened door. Rows of shirt-sleeved
young men were tap-tapping fever-
ishly on their machines, deep in the
throes of composing dialogue to suit
the brief directions handed out to
them. I read over the shoulders of
one: "Heroine implores husband to
quit drinking. He curses. Pile it
on thick." Small boys were scurry-
ing about collecting sheets of type-
written matter and handing them
through a wire grating to other young
men wielding formidable blue pencils
and paste-brushes.
"These," said the Manager, point-
ing to the young men behind the
grating, "are the retouchers. The
gentleman on the right is our topical
specialist. His business is to see
that all questions of the moment
receive due mention in the play.
You will remember that in the first
scene of Tltc Rubber King the hero
is discovered in a drinking and gamb-
ling den. This gives an opportunity
for some observations on the Licen-
sing Bill. Hand mo section U.K. IA,
Mr. TOMPKINSON. Yes, here we are.
The hero raises his glass of beer and
cries, 'A toast, gentlemen! Here '«
jimspr.rUij to us all, and hands off
tlic People's beer!' That will go
down well. Again, in the third
scene leading up to the great motor-
car accident ..."
"I don't, remember a motor-car
accident in the play," I put in.
"That 's right. In the original
the hero escapes after the murder in
a railway train which is smashed up
in a collision. But of course we have
brought all that up to date. In the
:.Treat motor-car scene—a magnificent
spectacle this will be—we get some
observations on the speed limit. Mr.

Ah, this is it:—

For us there is no speed limit. Death

night!
"How they will hiss that! Then
the gentleman on his left is our
sentiment specialist. It is his busi-
ness to see that the sentimental
speeches are put in with a broad
brush. In the scene where the
deserted wife is turned out into the
snow with the twins in her arms. . ."
"Twins? " I asked.
"Yes. Clearly it is up to me to
go one better than the popular baby
in Pete, so I have made it twins.
Bright idea that, isn't it? Hand me
section R.K. SB, Mr. MUGGIUDGE. . . .
Here we are :—
Heroine. Monster, would you turn
my children out to die in yonder
snow? Is this the justice of Eng-
land, the land of the free?
Bailiff. It is the law.
Heroine. Then so much the worse
for the law! If it is the law to
oppress a weak woman and murder
her innocent babes, then I say again,
so much worse for the law!!"
"Is that quite logical?" I
hazarded.
"It doesn't really matter," re-
plied the Manager carelessly. "The
People, like it, and that 's all we have
to look to. The great heart of the
People is the only standard of criti-
cism, whatever the bitter-hearted
blatherskites who write rubbish in
the papers may say. . . . But per-
haps you would like to pass on to
some of our other departments—the
assembling room, where the different
parts of the play are joined up in
proper order (highly important, this,
as mistakes have occurred); or the
liming room, where we rehearse the
play with gramophone dummies and
prepare time-sheets for the actors; or
i.he stock-room, where we house our
raw material."
"I should like to see over the
last," I replied.
It proved to be a large room
stocked with highly-varnished filing
cabinets prominently marked with
the headings of their contents.
"Law " occupied one entire wall of
the room, and was subdivided into
"Unwritten," "Divorce," "Mar-
riage—Foreign," "Breach of Pro-
mise," "Murder," "Wills," and
many others. A cabinet marked
"Epigrams " caught my eye, and I
asked to be allowed to look into its
contents. Receiving permission, I
read out at random some of the type-
written slips it contained: —
"The man that raises his hand
against a woman is unworthy of the
mime of man.
London is a wicked city.
What is home without a baby?
When I die your name will be
found engraven on my heart.
Yours until death do us part.
On mv head let the punishment
fall.
My life shall be consecrated to
atonement.
Love is a wonderful thing."
"We keep a man entirely on the
job of composing these," said tbe
Manager complacently.
I looked at the cabinet-heading
again. "Are they in the right
cabinet?" I asked somewhat diffi-
dently.
"Why, yes! What else would
you call them?"
I passed on hastily to another
topic. "Is your business confined to
melodrama?"
"We do pantos as a side line,"
replied the Manager, " but prices are
being cut too fine nowadays to show
much profit. Our poetry department
is mainly responsible for the panto
wording, and in the slack season we
turn them oil to Christmas crackers.
Then we are starting an election
speech department—it will be in good
running order soon."
"Any particular political side? " I
asked.
The Manager seemed amused.
The side that 's most popular is
the side that represents the People's
will, and that 's our side, you bet, all
the time."

THE LIFE SPHERICAL.
IT was a beautiful September day,
and we floated softly over green
Surrey.
'' And tliis is England!'' said my
friend. "I am indeed glad to be
here at last, and to come in such a
-way."
"You could not," I said, "have
chosen a more novel or entertaining
means of seeing the country for the
first time."
We leaned over the edge of the
basket and looked down. The earth
was spread out like a map: we could
see the shape of every meadow, pene-
trate every chimney.
"How beautiful," said my .friend.
"How orderly and precise. No
wonder you conquered the world, you
English. How unresting you must
be! But what," he went on, "is
the employment of those men there,
on that great space? Are they prac-
tising warfare'' See how they walk
in couples, followed by small boys.
One stops. The boy gives him a
\vrapon. He seems to be addressing
himself to the performance of a
delicate rite. See how he waves his
hands. He has struck something.
See how they all move on together;
what purpose in their stride! It is
the same all over the place—men in
pairs, pursuing or striking, and boys
following. Tell me what they are
doing. Are they tacticians?"
"No," I said, "they are merely
playing golf. That plain is called a
golf links. There are hundreds like
that in England. It is a game, a
recreation. These men are resting,
recreating. You cannot see it be-
cause it is so small, but there is a
little white ball which they hit."
"The pursuit has no other pur-
pose?" asked my friend. "It
teaches nothing? It does not lead
to military skill?"
"No," I said.
He was silent for a while and then
he pointed again. "See," he said,
"that field with the white figures.
I have noticed so many. What are
they doing? One man runs to a spot
and waves his arm; another, some
distance away, waves a club at some-
thing. Then he runs and another
runs. They cross. They cross again.
Some of the other figures run too.
What does that mean? That surely
is practice for warfare?"
"No," I said, "that is cricket.
Cricket is also a game. There are
thousands of fields like that all over
England. They are merely playing
for amusement. The man who
wtived his arm bowled a ball; the

man who waved his club hit it. You
cannot see the ball, but it is there."
He was silent again. A little later
he drew my attention to another
field. "What is that?" he said.
"There are men and girls with clubs
all running among each other. Surely
that is war. See how they smite!
What Amazons! No wonder Eng-
land leads the way!"
"No," I said, "that is hockey.
Another game."
"And is there a ball there too?"
he asked.
"Yes," I said, " a ball."
"But see the garden of that
house," he remarked; "that is not
hockey. There are only four, but
two are women. They also leap
about and run and wave their arms.
Is there a ball there?"
"Yes," I said, "there is a ball
there. That is lawn tennis."
"But the white lines," he said.
"Is not that, perhaps, out-door
mathematics? That surely may help
to serious things?"
"No," I said; "another game.
There are millions of such gardens in
England with similar lines."
"Yes," he said, for we were now
over Surbiton, "I see them at this
moment by the score."
We passed on to London. It was
at that time of September wheu foot-
ball and cricket overlap, and there
was not only a crowded cricket match
at the Oval but an even more
crowded football match at Black-
heath. I foresaw trouble.
My friend caught sight of the Oval
first. "Ah," he said, " you deceived
me. For here is your cricket again,
played amid a vast concourse. How
can you call it a game? These

played, but would play one them-
selves. It must be more than you
said; it must be a form of tactics
that can help to retain England's
supremacy, and these men are here
to learn."
"No," I said, "no. It is just a
game. In England we not only like
to play games but to see them
played."
It was then that he noticed Black-
heath. "Ah, now I have you!" he
cried. "Here is another field and
another crowd; but this is surely a
battle. See how they dash at each
other. And yes, look, one of them
has had his head cut off and the
others kick it. Splendid!"
"No," I said, "that is no head,
that is a ball. Just a ball. It is a
game, like the others."
He groaned. "Then I cannot
see," he said at last, " how England
won her victories and became
supreme."
"Ah," said I, "at the time that
England was winning her victories
and climbing into supremacy few or
no games were played. The ball had
not then conquered us."
"THE GREY UNDERWORLD."
III.—SETU LATIMEK'S WIFE.
PONKER tells me that quite a lot
of people in the Grey Underworld—
nice, intellectual - looking people —
spend hours and hours sitting about
in public gardens doing nothing (7
think they are composing answers to
acrostics; but that by the way), and
it occurred to him that if he could
get some of them to tell their life
histories it might help them to pass
the leaden hours, and would, inci-
dentally, greatly benefit his book.
So he took to haunting disused
burial-grounds and other pleasaunces,
but found that most of the people
there preferred to pass the leaden
hours in silent meditation, with occa-
sional intervals for light refreshment;
and he was getting very much dis
couraged when SETH LATIMER filled
him with hopes of " copy."
POXKER came across SETH in the
garden belonging to a dingy square.
This garden, he tells me, is governed
by a prison warder administering a
code of 149 by-laws. (Well, per-
haps not a prison warder really; but
a bad - tempered person with post-
man's trousers.) It is hemmed in
by vicious-looking spears, and con-
tains a fountain basin—too shallow
to serve the turn of the dejected
people whom it fills with thoughts oi
suicide—and a statue of an alderman
by some anonymous miscreant.
Into this elysium stepped SETH
LATIMEU one afternoon as the clock
over the mausoleum on the north side
of the square (a church, I suspect,
though PONKER thinks not) struck
the hour of one. He came out of a
house in the square, carrying a black
band-bag, and he walked with an
air of angry determination to a seat
beside the fountain basin, opened the
bag, and ate about a pound of ham
sandwiches. Then he went back to
the house again.
PONKEK was only mildly interested
at first. He thought it a pity that
class feeling should be strong enough,
ven in such a dingy square, to pre-
vent people from inviting the piano-
tuner to share their midday meal
with them—especially as SETH, who
was a refined - looking old fellow,
seemed to take it to heart so much.
But when SETH LATIMER (of course
the name was merely coined for him
by PONKER)—when SETH LATIMER
(PONKER says the name fitted him
to a T) repeated the same perform-
ance at one next day, it became
evident that he lived in the square,
and was not a piano-tuner at all.
Of course, thought PONKER, it might
be some new kind of open-air cure;
but the chances were against it, be-
cause fads are generally confined to
the idle rich.
It was not until a little later, when
PONKER was contemplating the gold-
fish in the basin, that the explanation
of it flashed across his mind, and he
saw that SETH LATIMER was the hero
of a delightfully sordid little domestic
drama.
His shiny frock-coat was sufficient
evidence that life had not gone too
well with him, and things had, per-
haps, been at their very worst when
his wife came unexpectedly into a
little money. Being a woman of
coarse fibre she had taunted him
from that time forth with his de-
pendence upon herself, till at last his
proud, sensitive nature was goaded
beyond endurance, and he cried out
in his bitterness of spirit: "Woman,
never more will I take bite or sup
beneath your roof."
PONKER was so pleased with his
discovery that he began prodding at
the gold-fish, in an absent-minded
way, with the point of his umbrella;
and the prison warder came and told
him that he had made himself liable,
under By-law 110, to forty shillings
or a month. (I *m not quite sure,
but I rather think there was even
some hint of corporal punishment.)
But PONKER was not going to be
put off the trail of "copy" by a
man in postman's trousers; and on
the third day he found himself sitting
side by side with SETH LATIMER, on
a seat upon which they were both
forbidden to carve their names under
a penalty of £5. (This, however, was
no hardship, as PONKEH designed to
send his name and SETII'S down to
posterity in a far more enduring
fashion. The whole world should
weep over that attenuated figure
with the pathetic black bag.)
SETH opened his bag wearily, ate a
mouthful of sandwich, and then—
and then such a look of dumb agony
came over his face that PONKER'S
heart ached for him. Suddenly it
must have been borne in upon SETH
that, though he might eat in the
garden, his food was none the less of
his wife's providing. (Why hadn't
he thought of this before? I don't
know; one can't think of everything,
I suppose.)
He could not eat it. It choked
him. With deft aim he flung the
ham sandwiches of dependence in
among the gold-fish, infringing I
know not how many by-laws.
Then his eye met PONKER'S.
"Young man," he said, "if ever
you marry, you put your foot down,
and don't you allow any spring-
cleaning. There 's my house, now-,
so poisoned with the smell of varnish
that I can't eat in it. But when it
comes to putting French polish on
ham sandwiches !''
PONKER expressed his sympathy,
and I know he would do it in a nice
and gentlemanlike way; but he was
a little low that evening. Why, oh,
why would not people rise to that
pitch of misery which home and
foreign realists had taught him to
believe was the common inheritance
of dwellers in mean streets?
The Danger of a Little Learning'.
"Hannibal is a new name for Mr. Geo.
Rcmvick. This suggestion will probably stick
to tlie Tariff Reform candidate. It makes such
an interesting picture, full of subtle suggestion
for the cartoonist. Mr. George Renwick in
toga viritis—we will give him the full adult
privilege—assaulting the gates of Newcastle
or attempting to squeeze his Tariff Reform
wooden horse inside the citadel."
Northern Echo.
None of Mr. Punch's cartoonists is
prepared to avail himself of this
"subtle suggestion."
The KAISER is reported to be
annoyed because none of the German
aristocracy has at present married
any of the girls in His Imperial
Majesty's Sardanaptihis ballet. He
does not care for the Fatherland to
be shown up as inferior to Great
Britain in this or any other matter.

[" It may perhaps bo difficult after so much laxity to pull ourselves
together, but it is not at all impossible. At any rate, let us save our
children from a similar unsatisiied and restless kind of existence by
teaching them from babyhood the true joy of self-mastery, of discipline,
and of thought for others, lessons to be enforced, if necessary, by
wholesome ami just chastisement."—"Privy Councillor" in " The Daily
Mail" on " The Sense of Dutt/."]
I ADMIT the accusation that, regarded as a nation,
We 're developing a tendency to go it;
We 've been given up as hopeless, and, as years elapse,
we cope less
With our vices—we are decadent, and know it!
But it 's still within our power, if we really try, to dower
All our children with the virtues that we 're lacking—-
Both by dint of moral suasion, and, of course, on due
occasion,
By judicious, wholesome, necessary whacking!
If my wife and I are seedy (the result of being greedy)
When we 've supped at costly cafes two or three times
In a style we didn't oughter, then LOUISE, our little
daughter,
Is deprived of jam at just as many tea-times;
And our manners may be boorish, and our taste in
dressing poorish,
Still, if Baby DERRICK doesn't wear his bib aright,
Then the naughty little binner gets no pudding with his
dinner—
For no child of ours shall ever be a sybarite!
Though I 'rn getting on for fifty, I am anything but
thrifty—
I am prodigal and reckless, to be truthful;
But I often stop remittance of my son's half-termly
pittance,
Just to teach him careful habits while he 's youthful;
And whenever dissipation brings a harsh communication
From the company with whom I do my banking,
Then, in tones austere and gloomy, do I call my
children to me
And proceed to give them each a thorough spanking!
Though a course of bread-and-butter may constrain
LOUISE to utter
Protestations set to weird, chromatic wailings,
And though PAUL and BABS, in corners, howl like
Oriental mourners,
Still, you must correct hereditary failings;
And, in moments of distraction, it 's a source of satis-
faction
Thus to visit your offences on a nipper;
When you know your duty clearly is to kick yourself
severely,
You can take it out of COSMO with a slipper!
Though your task may seem appalling, not to say
distinctly galling,
For I find that, having been discreetly smitten,
PAUL and BABS are in the habit of belabouring their
rabbit,
While LOUISE proceeds to bash the Persian kitten.
Still, by strenuous endeavour, we may teach our children
never
To be like their naughty sires and silly mothers;
Using means at once preventive of that issue, and
incentive
To a life of self-control and thought for others!

DISCURSIONS.
DIVINE PHILOSOPHY.
I MET my friend, the pale young stockjobber, again
yesterday, and found him, as usual, very communica-
tive. He had complained of the weather, and I had
ventured some commonplace about philosophers being
independent of weather conditions. He looked at me
with some alarm, as though he had suddenly met a
ferocious animal, and began: "No larks," he said.
"You 're not one of those philosopher chaps, are you?
No, I thought not. Fact is I don't want to meet any-
more of them. I only knew one, and that was enough.
He just about fed me up with philosophers for the rest
of my life. Since then 1 've done with them. If I hear
:i fellow talking about philosophers I tell him I 'm not
taking any.
"How did it happen'> I '11 tell you. There was
a chap used to travel on this line, a skinny fellow with
a pasty face and a queer sort of nose. It started with
a hook and then finished with a snub—funniest sight
you ever saw. He hadn't got a hair on his face—never
had had—and he wore a wig. It was a ripping wig, all
brown and wavy, but it didn't fit very well at the back,
so you could spot it directly. He didn't smoke and he
didn't talk much, and I never saw him with a news-
paper. When a chap said, 'That 's a tasty bit about
Lady GWENDOLEN'S divorce,' or, 'This is all rot about
the drinking habits of marquises,' he just looked up in
a sniffy kind of way, as if he didn't want to be bothered,
and then got to work at his book again. He was always
reading some book or other covered up in brown paper.
"I fancy he was something in the banking line, but
I 'm not sure. Anyhow he looked like a banker—pom-
pous, you know, and very high and mighty, as if fellows
on the Stock Exchange were mere worms to him. I
didn't cotton to the beggar—none of us did—but after a
time nobody took much notice of him when he got into
our carriage, -and we just went on with our talk and
jokes as if lie wasn't there. Even old ' WHAT PRICE JOK'
couldn't draw him out, and it was no good any of us
trying if JOE BULLER couldn't bring it off. Generally it
was the Bank of England to a blue monkey on JOE in a
game of that kind, but I suppose we all have our
failures.
"Well, one day I was coming home early by a
different train. I was alone in the carriage, and just as
the train had started I saw this banker fellow legging
it along the platform as if he wanted to burst the world's
record. He chucked himself against my carriage, tore
open the door and got himself half in, when he slipped.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I had him by the collar in no time and dragged him in
on the floor just as all the guards and porters were on
to him. It was a near thing, and I wasn't sure at first
he hadn't left a leg or two behind him. He wasn't
too sure of it himself either, but after he 'd taken stock
of himself and got his breath and pulled his wig straight
he began to thank me twenty-four to the dozen and call
me his preserver and tommy-rot of that kind.
"One thing led to another, and before we 'd finished
that trip I found out he was a philosopher. He 'd
written a book: First Principles of Ethics, by HENRY
LAZENBY, was its name. I 've got it at home some-
where—he gave it to me—but I couldn't get through a
page of it. It was all stuff I 'd never heard of before
and never want to hear of again—systems and codes and
things—and the lingo made you red in the face with not
understanding it. LAZENRY was very hard on some of
the other philosophers-—' poisonous reptiles' he called
them. He said he belonged to a school that was bound
to beat all the rest. 1 thought he meant Eton or
Harrow, but he told me it was a school of philosophy.
They call themselves schools when two or three of them
get together and find out that all the other chaps
who 've been at it before have got hold of the muddy
end of the stick.
Of course 1 didn't get this out of him all at one go.
After 1 'd saved his bally life I took a sort of fancy to
the beggar and used to see a good deal of him one way
or another. It made me feel a bit superior, you know,
to talk to him before the other fellows and see them
open their mouths when he gave old ARISTOTLE beans.
He was a Greek chap or something of that sort, but
LAZENBY said his day was past. At last one day he said
he 'd like to get me interested in a meta-something or
other—yes, that 's the word, metaphysics—and would
I dine with him and spend the night? I was a young
fool in those days, and I accepted.
"You never saw such a place as he lived in—a great
ramshackle kind of barn with books all over it. His
wife was worse than LAZENBY. She was the boniest
old scarecrow I ever met outside a political meeting, and
she 'd got an eye on her that looked right through you
and dried you up. And what do you think we had for
dinner? Nuts, great Scott! Nuts and vegetable
omelets and bean cutlets and mess of that sort; and
there they were, both of 'em, quarrelling like cats over
some blessed philosopher while I was starving and
pretending to like their home-brewed ginger-beer. It
made me so ill I couldn't go to London next day, and I
made out I lost a thou. through not being in the market.
That settled me, and I didn't go on with his philosophy
after that. Ho shifted his quarters to Kent a month
later, and I haven't met him for years, I "in glad to
say.""
Some Modern Re-inventions.
The Daily Express, after reporting the up-to-date
features of the German Army Manoeuvres—the motor
cycles and the portable wireless apparatus—sums up the
picture with the following historical reflection: —
"Tn the background were groups of bhie-bloused, halt-French
|x\isantft, some of whom, perhaps, had witnessed similar scenes, under
sterner conditions, thirty-eight years Ego."
It is an awful thought that these useful devices may
once more perish in the next European war and have
to be invented all over again.
HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
[Strangely divergent views upon the duties of wives towards their
husbands emerge from the correspondence ou " Sport and Husbands"
which lias been appearing in The Daily Mirror.]
. I.
WHEN JENNY was wedded to WILL, said she:
"A dutiful wife I mean to be;
His every thought, his every care,
His every sorrow I hope to share.
No thought shall WILLIAM entertain
That is not known to his loving JANE.
His sport shall be my sport and he
Shall never want anyone else but me."
Now WILL had no thought in the world but one—
To kill and slay with his deadly gun;
He tramped the stubbles, he tramped the heather
Ruthlessly slaughtering fur and feather.
So JENNY, though little addicted to sport,
Like a dutiful wife, had her skirts cut short,
And all day long over holt and hill
Wearily toiled at the heels of WILL.
Itain and sun and sun and rain
Beat on the face of the dutiful JANE
Till her skin grew leathery, coarse and black,
Her coat hung down like a shapeless sack.
Her hands were knotted, her fingers twisted
And her feet the hugest that ever existed.
With aching limbs she trudges still
Wearily, wearily after WILL,
\Vhile he, depressed by the terrible blight of her,
Shudders whenever he catches a sight of her.
II.
When KITTY was wedded to TOM, said she:
"A spoilt little wife I mean to be;
I don't care a rap what the world may say,
I mean to make sure of my own sweet way,
And instead of my slaving for TOM I '11 see
That he is the veriest slave to me."
Scarce had the wedding-bell chimes grown fuiut
When KITTY contracted a new complaint,
A sort of a kind of a curious feeling
That seemed to defy all hopes of healing;
It baffled the doctors' diagnosis
And called for sofas and restful poses.
What it might be no man could say;
It came and went in a curious way.
If dinners and dances were on the fa pi's
KITTY grew suddenly well and happy.
But if household cares began to worry
KITTY relapsed in the greatest hurry,
Sank on a sofa and closed her eyes
And wrung TOM'S heart with her deep-drawn sighs.
At first TOM sometimes felt a wish
To gallop or golf or shoot or fish,
But if he indulged such a selfish whim
KITTY was sure to be even with him,
For when he returned he would find her lying,
Stretched on the sofa and all but dying,
Eobed in a peignoir that fitted nattily,
Crying for brandy and sn? volatile.
So it continued for several days
Till TOM was weaned from his wicked ways.
And now in his holidays he is tied
To his darling KITTIKIN'S sofa-side
Feeding her up with chicken and jelly,
And reading aloud from Miss COHELLI.

OUK STEBNUOUS STATESMEN.
IN welcome contrast to all the talk
of decadence and physical deteriora-
tion by which we are daily beset
are the evidences of courage, stamina
and agility recently furnished by
loading Liberal politicians.
Only the other day we read in the
papers of Mr. JOHN BURNS running
all the way from Putney to Hammer-
smith Bridge with an Australian
sculler, and The Daily Chronicle of
the 9th iust. related how Mr. LLOYD-
GEORGK, while fishing, killed a snake
a yard long on the river bank.
These, however, are by no means
isolated instances of the exhibition
of the manly virtues by our rulers, as
the following interesting information,
supplied at enormous cost by our
Special Correspondents, will abund-
antly show.
Thus on Friday last, at Slains
Castle, Mr. ASQUITH was serenaded
by four pipers for the space of half
an hour without uttering a single
murmur.
Quito recently, while bathing at a
well-known watering-place, Mr. HAL-
j DANE was attacked by a porpoise, but
beat off his finny foe with several
well-planted trudgeon strokes and
swam to shore uninjured.
Dr. MACNAMARA, M.P., whose de-
votion to golf is notorious, while
playing a round last Tuesday on a
well-known provincial course, hooked
his drive badly into a spinney and
stunned a young luminous owl so
badly that the bird had to be revived
with a strong jorum of sloe gin.
Lord CARUINGTON, who was the
principal speaker at a great Radical
jamboree at High Wycombc on
Wednesday last, took part in the
athletic sports which preceded the
speeches and came in eleventh in tho
sack-race.
Mr. MASTKRMAN, M.P., while play-
ing croquet a few days ago, was
stung in the hand by a wasp, but
after a hasty application of ammoni-
ated quinine pluckily continued the
game.
While fishing on Tuesday last
Mr. McKENNA killed a trout nearly
six inches long without any assist-
ance.
Mr. BlRRELL, during n recent visit
to Norfolk, ran from his house to the
golf links, a distance of nearly a
quarter of a mile, in 7 mins. 40 sees.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
A BROCKEN BENEFIT.
IT is easy enough to guess the
reasons that induced Mr. TREE to
give us a rechauffe of "Faust," if
rechauffe is quite the right word for
a version that lets the hero end in a
much cooler place than GOETHE
assigned to him. First of all, the
part of Mephintophclcs affords u fine
test of versatility, with lots of isolat-
ing limelight, for a leading actor;
secondly, the subject offers great
chances for scenic transformations
and pyrotechnics; thirdly, Mr. TREE
had his two faithful henchmen at call,
Mr. COMYNS CARR and Mr. STEPHEN
PHILLIPS, to rejuvenate the hoary
legend. In the result he was justi-
fied, though I am not sure that the
human element of the play was not
n little, overweighted by the super-
natural. I could easily have done
with fewer angels on clouds and fly-
ing bogies on the Brocken and
"living pictures " of dead women, if
Faust could only have been a little
less hustled over his capture of
Margaret's heart. But then, of
course, Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPS—to
say nothing of the stage-machinist—
had to be given his chances. And, ns
far as I could follow him, with so
much to distract the eye and so
many noises going on in the orchestra
and the bowels of the earth, he
seemed to have used them with dis-
cretion. One passage, however, ex-
cellent in itself, was damaged by the
circumstances attending its
utterance. It was the pero-
ration of Faust, where he an-
nounces his intention of de-
voting himself, purgatorially,
to tho good of his fellow-
men :—
"May it be mine . . .
To drain the marshland,
circumscribe the sea,
To build and shelter from
the tyrannous sky ..."
Admirable resolutions, which
would have done high credit
to a conscientious County
Councillor, but sounding
rather priggish when you
thought of the poor girl whom
he had ruined lying dead be-
side him. in her prison cell.
I recommend that in future
he should utilize the "deso-
late place" already painted
for Act II., Sc. 5, and throw
off his speech in decent soli-
tude.
Of the new features and
motives imposed upon the old
scheme, one at least should
be popular—the redemption

Aitiley). "My heart's the right size, but
my head seems so much smaller than yours."
of Faust through the magnetic
force of the "woman-soul." This
brought us to a terminal tableau
which is practically a replica of the
happy ending in The Darling'of the
Gods. Less satisfactory was the
fatal effect of the soporific on Mar-
garet's mother. One easily recog-

J
Slcphis'.optieles (Mr. Tree) to Faux1 in the Urockcn Gallery.
"Take your choice! All a-moving!"
nises the dramatic utility of this new
device. It gets Margaret to prison
several months earlier, and her arrest-
makes a very effective culmination to
the scene of Valentine's death. But
it introduces an alien note into a
tragedy of human passion whose
appeal lies in its apparent inevita-
bility. It confuses the issues, since
the murder is in effect the direct
handiwork of the devil, and the lovers
had only an innocent part in it.
I did not care very much for the
interpolation of that scene in "a
desolate place," where Faust is made
to lie beside a gloomy pool (at a com-
fortable angle on an artificial couch)
racked with an anticipatory pain in
his conscience. I should have pre-
ferred him to go blindly to his fault;
it would have left him fresher for his
subsequent repentance.
Mr. AINLEY was at his best as old
man Faust. As the lover, for all his
natural grace, he seemed less sincere
than usual. Miss MARIE Lorn acted
with astonishing courage in the
scenes that put most strain upon her
youth and inexperience; yet I wish
she had never been persuaded to
appear as Margaret. I hope I am
not too sensitive, but, frankly, I think
it a pity that, just for the sake of
a little more naturalism, so young a
girl should have been put through
the ordeal of playing the victim's
part in a story of seduction.
Miss ROSINA FILIPPI was the best
possible Martha, and Mr. GODFREY
TEARLE made a soldierly
Valentine, It must have been
very exasperating for him to
hear the dreadful news from
the bibulous lips of the most
accomplished toper in the
crowd; and I can't imagine
why this gentleman was
chosen for the task.
Finally, Mr. TKEE was a
most attractive and capable
fiend, especially in his lighter
and more satiric vein. A
weaker devil might well have
been unnerved by his own
diabolical fireworks; but not
he.
I noticed, by the way, that
Mephistopheles informed us
that he took no interest in
the Law. As an ex-private of
the Inns of Court (" Devil's
Own ") this meant for me
the loss of a very dear illu-
sion. But perhaps he has
only given up recognising that
distinguished corps since it
was embodied in the Terri-
torials. Another nasty blow
for Mr. HALDANE! O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LIFE OF LETTERS.
IT is only in response to the count-
less petitions of admiring relatives
and curious friends that (though
personally holding strongly the view-
that, in the ease of every consider-
able Writer, it is with the message
rather than the man that the public
is concerned) I have at last consented
to issue the following brief memoir
upon my own literary career.
It may be premised as a some-
what remarkable fact, that, although
no previous member of my family
has actually wielded other than a
commercial pen, I have myself been
brought variously into contact with
literary associations since childhood.
Thus my father, a man of secure
but not dazzling position in the
Leicester boot - and - shoe industry,
occupied during the first years of his
married life a residence (still, I be-
lieve, standing) in that town next-
door to the local circulating library,
subsequently moving to one slightly
larger at Stratford (Bow). How far
after-events may be traced to the
unconscious influence of these early
surroundings might, I dare say, form
for the curious in such matters a
fascinating subject of speculation.
To resume, however. The inspira-
tion of my first literary effort came
to me, I recollect, exactly a decade
ngo this month, while spending my
customary vacation at Smellsea-on-
Solent. Since then it has become
my habit to confine the practice of
composition exclusively to the pre-
sent season of the year; and from
burning Bournemouth to wintry
Whitby there are but few of the most
select holiday resorts in this island
kingdom that have not seen me at
my self-imposed labour. It has
truly been one of love. I am natur-
ally a quick worker, and, once con-
ceived, the entire MS. was completed
practically at a sitting, as indeed has
been the case with each one of its
successors. It was then submitted,
not without some natural diffidence,
to the same eminent firm through
whom the whole of my subsequent
publishing business has been trans-
acted. Its success is perhaps not a
theme for me to dwell upon. With-
out exact information, I believe I am
justified in saying that the circulation
ran into several hundred thousand
copies (including six copies which
were purchased by myself for dis-
tribution among my wife's family).
In the case of later compositions I
have had the gratification of seeing
these figures far exceeded.
That, indeed, was a memorable

Small Ctrl. "MUM MY!
MOTORITIS.
Ml'MUY! Is THAT THE SWAX'.S SPARE LEG?"
day! How well do 1 recall the
delicious thrill with which on the
morning of its publication I dis-
covered a complete stranger asleep
with my own words upon his knee,
and my wife's emotion when at
dinner a fellow-guest at the same
boarding-house actually quoted (of
course in ignorance of its author's
identity) a passage from my work.
These are incidents to the influence
of which I am even now not wholly
insensible, for it is in such apparent
trifles that intellectual effort reaps a
reward richer than mere pecuniary
recompense. The comparison reminds
me to mention that I have through-
out consistently refused to accept
any form of payment for my writings,
or rather (to clothe the same state-
ment in language of more pedantic
accuracy) should certainly so refuse
did the occasion arise. My own
literary work, therefore, whatever
may be the case with that of others,
is dictated by no aims more ignoble
than the education and advancement
of my fellow-men. It is better so.
Only free from the sordid trammels
of finance can the artist hope to
achieve his highest level. Thus and
thus only can he maintain the dis-
tinction of purpose, the fine uncon-
scious altruism, that (I am proud to
believe) animates every word that I
have written in my annual letter to
The Dally Telegraph.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT was the ambition of Estlicr Moor to hear the
vox Dei with her outward ears so that through her
agency it might become the vox populi in the little
country town of Lowport and the surrounding villages.
.Mr. J. E. BUCKHOSE'S pleasantly written Voices (Hur-
CIIINSON) describes the success and the failure of her
venture. At first her hearing of the divine voices—
lather unkindly compared to the cry of a bat, which
most people find inaudible—was only a pretence. After
a time she persuaded herself, as well as the weak-kneed
folk whom she cured of hysterical diseases for the
moderate fee of half-a-sovereign, that it was a reality,
and much hearing would have made her mad if she had
not, to test the good faith of her affianced husband,
publicly declared that the voices were a delusion.
Whereupon that gentleman, who, I regret to say, was
a journalist, seeing that the geese who laid the golden
coins on which he had pro —
posed to live a life of genteel
unemployment were for all
practical purposes dead, de-
cided, happily for Estlicr, to
remain a bachelor.
If Mrs. MARY BAKER G.
EDDY should happen to light

good reason for thinking that
it constitutes an infringement
of her own patent religion.
The two cults are practically
identical, though Mr. BUCK-
HOSE makes no mention of
the American seer. But that
is only his artfulness. His
book is obviously meant to be
a satire on the weak points of
her popular nostrum. But
I am afraid it is a case of
Criticism's labour lost. These
happy people are convinced
that they have no weak points.
The voice of the satirist is as inaudible to them as the cry
of a bat or a turnip to you or me. Stlil, they might do
worse than see themselves, as in a looking-glass, in Mr.
BucKKosii's book.

Ten years ago we were taught to believe that there
was no fun left in Ireland, and that women were defi-
cient in the sense of humour. Then eame Miss SOMER-
VILLE and " MARTIN Ross " and demolished both asser-
tions in iS'omc Experiences of an Irish li.M. With its
treble appeal to lovers of Hibernia, hilarity and horses,
the book achieved an immediate success, and has long
been regarded as a classic by those best capable of test-
ing its fidelity to life. Of the sequel now issued under the
title of Further Experiences of an Irish R.M. (LONGMANS),
it would be flattery to say that it equals its predecessor.
But from any other ordeal of comparison the new
R.M. would emerge triumphant. Some of the char-
acters have sobered a little since we met them last,
but Philippa can still shriek
like a peacock; Flurry Knox,
though a married man and a
magistrate, still presumes suc-
cessfully on his delusive
youthfulness of aspect; that
venerable buccaneer, his
grandmother, dingy yet be-dia-
monded, still combines the
manners of a grandc dame
with the morals of a poacher;
and Maria, that ineomparab/e
spaniel, "elderly but unim-
paired in figure," has on\y
been " fortified in guile by the
castigations of seven winters."
Happy are those who are
prompted by perusal of the
new volume to refresh their
recollections of the old: still
happier those who make their
first acquaintance with the
R.M. in his latter phase,
and have still before them

the uutasted joys of his golden youth.
Mr. GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM has inscribed his novel
Suanisli Gold (METHUEN) "To Theodosia and Althea
who asked me to write a story about treasure buried on
an island," and in a sense he has carried out their wish.
But if THEODOSIA and ALTHEA are really children (in
spite of their portentous names) they will have to wait
a little before they can fully appreciate the author's vein
of comedy. Pragmatism, for instance, provides the sub-
ject of one of the most delightful conversations in the
book, but every child I know would shy at it. Mr.
Mcldon, the clergyman who took charge of this treasure-
hunt and of all the curious people engaged upon it, was
not a very perfect moralist, but he was "out" to get
the doubloons, and no trifles were going to stop him.
If he had not been a clergyman he would have made a
most successful company-promoter, for he was never at
;i loss for words or excuses. In fact, he talked and
talked until he found the doubloons. Perhaps TIIEODOSIA
and ALTHEA talked und talked until they got the book,
and, if so, I should like to include them (always
supposing that they are children) in my vote of thanks
to Mr. BIRMINGHAM.

PIGS AND THE FUTURE STATE.
[In a paper rend Iwfore the Congress of Religions at Oxford last
week, Mr. MAIIKTT quoted the views of a native of Polynesia, who
professed himself unable to " imagine the ghost of a pig."]
PIG of the small suspicious eye,
And nasal organ so expert
At poking round your putrid sty
For dainty bits of offal dirt;
I come to break a piece of news,
Not humorous, not designed for laughter,
Since it concerns the latest views
That bear upon a pig's Hereafter.
Nature denies you many things
Which you regard as hopes deferred—
Such as the joy of wearing wings
And so behaving like a bird;
Calmly you wait the blessed time
When spirits, freed from earth's infections,
Attain a larger, happier clime
Where pigs will rly in all directions.
But now the Polynesian black
Asserts that, when he 's had you roast,
No Huff will sprout upon your back,
You cannot even be a ghost;
So far from sailing up the air
Where mortal vision may not follow,
You won't so much as haunt the lair
In which your habit was to wallow!
This thought should prove a fatal blow
To those sublime and soaring dreams
That cheered your piggish life below,
Gilding its muck with ghostly gleams;
If Paradise is barred to swine,
As hinted by the negro mystic,
You must infallibly decline
On courses purely Hedonistic.
Am I indifferent to the pain
This news occasions'.' Yes, I am.
I would not wish you back again
Except as bacon or as ham:
I trow I should be dead of fright
(At the mere thought my reason totters)
Were I to hear at dead of night
The tramp of your unearthly trotters.
Yet would I soothe your gaping sore
With comfort drawn from logic's well:
If you 've no future bliss in store—
If Heaven is sealed, why so is Hell;
And, though your past were bad to beat,
And might not bear investigation,
At least you '11 not be asked to meet
The Road-hog, vour accurst relation!
"' O. S.
The Journalistic Touch.
"Nursed by Miss Florence Nightingale after being wounded at the
Battle of Alma, a veteran has died in his seventy-eighth year."
We think the imputation is unfair to Miss NIGHTINGALE,
and anyhow we feel certain that after this lapse of time
no jury would convict.
Several of our contemporaries are devoting their
columns to an explanation of the best way to obtain an
Old-Age Pension. Mr. Punch's advice is": Don't save.
PERCY'S VIEWS ON "SWARMING."
I HAD heard nothing from PERCY since the day he had
informed me of the tragic conclusion to his first essay
in courtship. So I was the more surprised, on looking
up from my writing one afternoon, to see him perched
on the top of my travelling inkstand, obviously con-
vulsed with an agony of imperfectly suppressed laughter.
If you ask me how I was able to detect this expression
on the' countenance of a drone, I don't know that I can
explain. Mr. TICKNF.K EDWARDES observes somewhere
in Tlic Lore of the Honey-bee that the great gulf
between the Bee-world and ourselves is conceivably not
unbridgable, and PERCY and I, as has been sufficiently
shown, had met each other more than halfway from the
first.
Something seems to have amused you, PERCY," I
said rather stiffly, for I had a suspicion—unfounded, as
it turned out—that he was indulging his sense of humour
at my expense.
"Amused, dear fellow! " he gasped. "I 've nearly
laughed my head off! What do you think our Virgin
Tartars have been up to now'.'" And he was again
overcome by a paroxysm of mirth.
"I 've no idea," I replied: "and I 'in not likely to
have, unless you can recover enough self-control to
enlighten me."
"Give me time, old boy! " he said, as he wiped his
eyes with his forelegs. "Well," he began at length,
"the old girls have been gettin' more and more tittuppy
for the last day or two. Bargin' into you at every
comb-corner, and side-snappin' 'my dears' at one
another, the way they do when their temper 's more
than usually short. And slack over their work into the
bargain. 7 noticed it, and HF.GGIK and ARCHIE noticed
it too. Even old Gus did—after he 'd had to wait once
or twice for his bee-milk. And this mornin', on comin'
in merry and bright from a turn round the garden, we
found there was no work goin" on at all!
'Now, girls, girls! I said to 'em, 'this'11 never
do. If you start slackin', how 's the show goin' to be
run'.'' Old EMILY turned on me with a queer sort of
glare in her indoor eyes. 'What do ire care'' ' she says.
'We 're sick and tired of running the show, as you call
it!' Just then in bounces CAROLINE and bangs down
her bundle of pollen. 'There,' she says, 'that 's the
last load / mean to carry! Why should we go on
slaving like this for a Posterity we '11 never see'.''
'Hear, hear! ' cries PRISCILLA, who's on the Housing
Committee. 'Blow Posterity!' 'We 've as much
right to be jolly as other persons!' says URSULA, our
Head Undertaker. 'More! ' chimes in MATILDA (she 's
Inspector of Noosancos); 'we've done with work for
ever!'
"Of course I 'd told 'em often enough what tommy-rot
I thought it was toilin' and sweatin' like they did—but
I never supposed they 'd act on anything / said, or I
shouldn't have spoken. 'I think you 're behavin' jolly
selfishly,' I said: 'and let me ask you this: If you I
ain't goin' to work, what arc you goin' to do with your-
selves'.''
Do'.' says MAHTIIA. 'Live our own lives! Be
free and happy and heedless of the morrow! Laugh,
quaff and be merry!'
'Oh,' says I, ' is that the idea?'
Yes,' says EMILY; 'we 're all going out to dance
and sing and frolic in the sunshine. And you and the
other boys must come too!'

I '11 trouble you! I said I was no end sorry, but I 'd
got a most important engagement at home; and Gus and
HEGGIE and the rest said the same. Not good enough,
don't you know!
"'Then stay behind!' says EMILY. 'We can get
along without you. The Queen 's coming, anyway.
She 's promised faithfully to join us presently. Come
along, girls!
"And out the wholo pack of 'em swarmed, singin'
and screamin', and walt/.in' like a lot of lunatic midges.
There were only two or three steady old stagers left. I
shouldn't have known the city, it was so quiet and
peaceful.
"I didn't much believe what EMILY had said about
the Queen joinin' 'em. She might have given 'em to
understand so, to pacify 'em—but, little as I knew
about my Lady-Mother, I didn't think it likely that
she 'd take to larkin' about at her time of life. And I
was right, for she stayed at home, like a sensible
sovereign.
"BERTIE and REGGIE and ALGIE and I went out on
the terrace and watched the proceedin's, just to see
what sort of notion the old girls had of a right-down
regular rollick. Whether they 'd expected some of the
other drones to put in an appearance is more than I can
tell you. Any way, they didn't—weren't takin'any. You
see, these bustlin' managin' Bee-women of ours are pretty
awful when they 're serious; but when they go in for
bein' skittish—well, they're simply holy terrors!
"So, bein' left to themselves, all they could do was
to frisk about with one another, and, never having had
any practice, naturally they were a bit awkward. REGGIE
and ALGIE and I nearly rolled off the terrace with
laughin'. You never saw anvthing so dash ridic'lous
as those prim old things conscientiously tryin' to frivol
and pretendin* what toppin' fun it was, and how they
were havin' the time of their lives!
"They were gottin' more sick of it every minute, but
they wouldn't give in. If the Queen had only been
with 'em, there was some idea of goin' off somewhere
and startin' a new State on the go-as-you-please prin-
ciple. But they couldn't do anything without her, and
they were beginnin' to see that she didn't mean turnin'
out. How much longer they 'd have kept goin' I don't
know, if it hadn't been for a shower luckily comin' on
and givin' 'em an excuse for breakin' off the revelry.
Doosid foolish they looked, too, sneakin' in one after
another, and goin' on with their jobs as if they 'd only
been away for a minute or two on business!"
I hope I need not say that I felt r.o inclination to
share in PERCY'S ribald mirth at such a fiasco. To me the
futility of this attempt of the Worker-Bees to throw their
bonnets over the mills, so to speak, was pathetic rather
than ludicrous. But PERCY could not be induced to see it
in that light. I suppose it was hardly to be expected.
"At least, PERCY," I said, "I hope you were drone
enough to refrain from taunting them?
"I didn't rag 'ern, of course, old man," he replied.
"All / said was, 'Well, girls, now you 've found what
enjoyin' yourselves is like, p'raps yon '11 understand
that it 's us fellows, after all, who 've got the hardest
work to do!' And then I came on to you, to have my
laugh out.
"But they 'II be waspier than ever after this little
outin'," concluded PERCY; " and, between yon and me,
my bojr, I shouldn't be surprised if my poor old Mother
isn't havin' a rotten time with 'em at this very minute."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[SEPTEMBER 23, 1908.
"THE GREY DNDERWOELD."
IV.—" THE PLANTS OF ASIA."
WE had been reading in a superior
weekly how a certain young novelist,
after being dined hy the New
Reclame Club, had gone forth alone
into the slum*, "to toil and sorrow
and suffer with the people," for six
mortal weeks—by way of prepara-
tion, of course, for his autumn novel.
This made PONKER jealous, for he
wanted to do something equally great
for English literature. "Then why
don't you toil and sorrow and suffer
with the people you want to make
'copy ' out of'.' " suggested PONKER'S
best adviser.
POXKEK said he was quite sure that
they wouldn't let him do anything of
the kind. One of the most tragic
things about the Grey Underworld ol
London was the fact that you might
live all your life next-door to a man,
and never even learn his name until
the black plumed horses came for
him—when the charlady would tell
you it.
And then the same patient adviser
had a masterly idea. Why shouldn't
POXKEU go from door to door all
through the Grey Underworld dis-
guised as a book-canvasser, and so
compel these, retiring folk to their
doorsteps'? They might not be very
chatty, but PONKER would at any
rate see a little way into their houses,
and intuition would do the rest.
POXKEK brightened at the sug-
gestion; and a few days later a
monumental work in forty parts,
entitled The Plants of Asia, was
made, by arrangement with a friendly
publisher, his justification for a house-
to-house visit.
No photographic weekly told of his
exploit; 110 club feted him as the
guest of the evening. He simply
had an egg for breakfast, and set out
one morning, dressed in a rusty
morning coat that he thought proper
to his part, and heavily weighted
with copies of the monumental work.
And in the evening he came home
lootsore and weary, and said that the
whole plan was rotten. He had only
learnt that some people had muttor
for dinner, and some had fish; some
people kept more umbrellas in their
hall than any Christian family could
possibly have come by honestly, and
some people had no umbrellas at all;
and there were dark moments, so he
told me, when he felt inclined to
pitch The Plants of Asia into some
yawning area, and come home in a
hansom.
Nevertheless the next day he set
out again—but only to return an hour
later, with no Plants under his arm,
and possessed by u mysterious fit of
silence.
It was not until the genial hour of
after-dinner that the secret came out.
It appeared that he had selected
that morning the dullest, greyest
street he could possibly find—Mafe-
king Street, S.E.—a street in which,
he felt sure, nobody could ever be
happy by any effort whatever—and
had knocked at the door of the first
of an endless row of brick boxes, all
exactly alike. After waiting for a
minute or two he thought he might
as well knock again, to find out
whether all the inmates of the, house
had made away with themselves in
a fit of depression.
Well, one hadn't; she came to the
door jingling a little bunch of keys,
rathe)' breathless, and wearing a kind
of large pink pinafore over her dress.
(" Pretty? " said POXKEK'S audience,
in parenthesis. "Yes," said PON-
KER, "nirfnllij;" and smoked in
silence for two minutes and a-half.)
The door being opened, it seemed
that POXKER had given The Plants of
Asia a slap, cleared his throat, and
enlarged upon the advantages of Art
in the home.
"Oh, yes," she said, "I should
like to see"
So POXKER showed .her the first
coloured plate — a pine - apple in
bloom, or something of the sort.
(Pine - apples do burst into flower
sometimes, don't they? In the
spring, you know.) She looked at it
with evident admiration, and PONKKR
took the opportunity of explaining
that it was done in fourteen colours
by a new process, and was simply
being given away at a loss to every-
one concerned—except the purchaser.
'It 's beautiful," she said.
"Only sevenpence for each part?"
Then, with u little flutter of self-
consequence, she produced a new
purse and took out some money.
"CIIARL— I mean, my husband,
is so fond of flowers," she explained
rather shyly.
Now PONKER, relying upon the idea
that no one would give him an order
for the preposterous work, and having
found that carrying a dead weight
was no joke the previous day, had
only brought out with him one num-
ber of the thing; and this recklessly
extravagant young person proposed to
clear out his whole stock-in-trade at
once, and upset his plans for the day.
He felt he couldn'.t spare the copy.
"I say, have you thought that it
goes on for forty months?" he said
anxiously—" nearly for ever?"
"But that will be delightful," she
observed, looking actually happy at
the idea. (The absurd creature.
Forty pleasant surprises for CHARLEY!
What?)
Then PONKER seems to have fallen
away from his role altogether. "De-
lightful? Do you mean it?" he
said. "It would bore me awfully,
do you know, to have a thing like
that happening every month."
She smiled—(I should think a cat
would have laughed at PONKER'S
notion of doing business) — she
smiled; and PONKEH gave up The
Plants of Asia at once, ungrudgingly.
"I 'm sure CIIAHL I mean,
your husband, will be pleased," he
said. "Good-bye."
"Good-bye," she nodded; and the
door closed, but the glamour re-
mained.
As POXKEK'S occupation was gone,
he turned homewards for more copies
of the monumental work. But when
he got home he changed his mind
and stayed there.
And there is a sequel to this.
Yesterday, I saw on PONKER'S .desk
a sheet of paper headed " Chap. I.,"
and " Chap. I." opened like this: —
"Although, Heaven wots, my fin-
gers are apter with the sword-haft
than with the goose-quill, yet am I
minded, now while the matter i«
fresh in my memory, to set, down
what wondrous chances have befallen
nif since I rode from the field of

POINTS FOR PENSIONERS.
"Too Youxo AT SEVENTY."—You
say that in spite of all your efforts
you cannot induce your hair to be-
come thin or turn grey, and so the
pension 'officers won't believe your
age. We can only advise the daily
use of a hair restorer; you will find
the advertisements of them in the
papers.
"ANXIOUS." -There is nothing
technically criminal in having onco
run a bazaar, but we should strongly
advise you to conceal it from the
authorities.
"FATHER OF TWEXTY-TJIRKE."—No,
the pension will only be given to your-
self—your grandchildren will have to
wait a little. .Meanwhile let them
begin a course of study on how to
fill up a pension form.
"COQUETTE." — Sorry; you jrifl
have to fill in your age. But the
pension oflieers are very discreet.

THE BROWN BAG.
JOHN walked eight miles over the
cliffs to the nearest town in order to
buy tobacco. He came back to the
farmhouse with no tobacco, and the
news that lie had met some friends
in the town who had invited us to
dinner and Bridge the next evening.
"But that 's no reason why you
should have forgotten the tobacco,"
I said.
"One can't remember everything.
I accepted for both of us. We
needn't dress. Put on that nice blue
tiannel suit of yours"
"And that nice pair of climbing
boots with the nails"
"Is that all you 've got?"
"All I 'm going to walk eight miles
in on a muddy path."
"Then we shall have to take a
bag with us. And we can put in
pyjamas and stay the night at an
hotel; it will save us walking back in
the dark. We don't want to lose
you over the cliff."
I took out a cigar.
'This is the last," I said. "If,
instead of wandering about and col-
lecting invitations, you had only
remembered Shall we cut it up
or smoke half each?"
"Call," said JOHN, bringing out a
penny. "Heads it is. You begin."
I struck a match and began.
Next day, after lunch, JOHN
brought out his little brown bag.
"It won't be very heavy," he
said, " and we can carry it in tuniB.
An hour each."
I don't think that 's quite fair,"
I said. "After all, it 's your bag.
If you take it for an hour and a half,
1 don't mind taking the other half."
"Your shoes are heavier than
mine, anyhow."
"-My pyjamas weigh less. Such
a light blue as they are."
Ah, but my toothbrush has lost
seven bristles. That makes a differ-
ence."
"What I say is, let every man
carry his own bag. This is a rotten
business, JOHN. I don't wish to be
anything but polite, but for a silly
ass commend me to the owner of
that brown thing."
JOHN took no notice and went on
packing.
"I shall buy a collar in the
town," he said.
"Better let me do it for you.
You would only go getting an invita-
tion to a garden-party from the
haberdasher. And that would mean
another eight miles with a port-
manteau."
"There we are," said JOHN as he
;losed the. bag, "quite small and light.
Mow who '11 take the first hour?"
"We 'd better toss, if you 're quite
.sure you won't carry it all the way.
Tails. Just my luck."
JOHN looked out of the window
and then at his watch.
They say two to three is the
hottest hour of the day," he said.
"It will be cooler Inter on. I shall
put you in."
*****
I led the way up the cliffs with
that wretched bag. I insisted upon
that condition anyhow—that the
man with the bag should lead the
way. I wasn't going to have JOHN
dashing off at six miles an hour, and
leaving himself only two miles at the
end.
But you can come and talk to
me," 1 said to him after ten
minutes of it. "I only meant that
I was going to set the pace."
No, no, I like watching you.
You do it so gracefully. This is
my man," he explained to some
children who' were blackberrying.
"He is just carrying my bag over
the cliffs for me. No, he is not very
strong."
"You wait," I growled.
JOHN laughed. "Fifty minutes
more," he said. And then after a
little silence, "I think the bag-
carrying profession is over-rated.
What made you take it up, my lad?
The drink? Ah, just so. Dear,
dear, what a lesson to all of us."
Wait till his turn comes," I mur-
mured to myself, and changed hands
for the eighth time.
I don't care what people say,"
said JOHN argumentatively; "brown
and blue do go together. If you
wouldn't mind"
For the tenth time I rammed the
sharp corner of the bag into the back
of my knee.
"There, that 's what I mean.
You see it perfectly like that—the
brown against the blue of the flannel.
Thank you very much."
I stumbled up a steep little bit 'of
slippery grass, and told myself that
in three-quarters of an hour I would
get some of my own back again. He
little knew how heavy that bag could
become.
"They say," said JOHN to the
heavens, "that if you have weights
in your hands you can jump the
little eminences much more easily. I
suppose one hand alone, doesn't do.
What a pity ho didn't tell me before.
—I would have lent him another bag
with pleasure."
"Nobody likes blackberries more
than I do," said JOHN. "But even
I would hesitate to come out here on
a hot afternoon and fill a great brown
aag with blackberries, and then carry
them eight miles home. Besides, it
ooks rather greedy. ... I beg your
pardon, my lad, 1 didn't'understand.
You are taking them home to your
aged mother? Of course, of course.
Very commendable. If I had a penny,
I would lend it to you. No, I only
taave a sixpence on me, and I have
to give that to the little fellow who
is carrying my bag over the cliffs for
me. . . . Yes, I picked him up about
a couple of miles back. He has mud
all up his trousers, I know."
I began to think of some of the
things I would say to him in half-an-
hour's time. It would be rather fun
to pretend
"Dear, dear," he said solicitously,
"did you knock your knee? I am
sorry. If I had seen where you were
going to, I would have warned you.
I do hope you won't do it again. A
man once told me that they fill the
corners of those bags with lead, BO
as to keep the moths out. Was it
lead? Oh, well, I suppose you
couldn't tell exactly. It 's rather an
art, telling things by the feel."
He wras silent for ten minutes, and
then broke out rapturously ontv
more.
"What a heavenly day! I am
glad we didn't bring a bag—it would
have spoilt it altogether. We can
easily borrow some slippers, and it
will be jolly walking back by moon-
light. Now, if you had had your
wav"
*****
"One minute more," I said joy-
fully; "and oh, my boy, how glad
I am we brought u bug. What a
splendid idea of yours! By the way,
you haven't said much lately. A
little tired by the walk?"
"I make it two minutes," said
JOHN.
"Half a minute now. . . . There!
And may I never carry the con
founded thing another yard."
I threw the bag down and fell
upon the grass. The bag rolled a
yard or two away. Then it rolled
another yard, slipped over the edge,
and started bouncing down the cliff.
Finally it leapt away from the earth
altogether, and dropped two hundred
feet into the sea.
"My bag," said JOHN stupidly.
And that did for me altogether.
"I don't care a hang about your
bag," I cried. "And I don't care a
hang if I 've lost my pyjamas and
my best shoes and my only razor.

LADY DOROTHY BOODLE, whose
pianoforte solo was the piece de
resistance at the Penny Heading held
in the Parish Room at Tuftonville
on Thursday last, is a performer of
no mean accomplishments. Though
her left hand is somewhat lacking in
the robustness necessary for the in-
terpretation of such momentous com-
posers as BOBRINSKY and MANDY-
CZKWSKY, she plays with an clan, not
to say a verve and an abandon, that
is highly impressive. Such talents,
in short, would be an acquisition to
the musical profession, but Lady
DOROTHY BOODLE has so far steadily
declined the tempting offers of lucra-
tive engagements showered upon her
by the leading impresarios of the
metropolis.
Lord BERTIE PANGHOURNE, who
sang at the Band of Hope Charity
Bazaar at Yattendon on Saturday
night, is undoubtedly one of the finest
teetotal tenors in the United King-
dom. The timbre of his voice is
undoubtedly of a more delicate
quality than that of TAMAGNO in his
prime, but his tones easily penetrated
every corner of the Workman's Insti-
tute, and, with practice and experi-
ence, would probably prove equally
efficacious in a more extensive audi-
torium. Both of his efforts were
rewarded by encores, and though
neither of the vocal items selected
imposed a serious demand on the
dramatic qualifications of the
vocalist they nevertheless sufficed to
display some of the most engaging
features of the tenor voice. A touch-
ing incident marked the conclusion
of LORD BERTIE'S last contribution,
when Mr. JOSHUA NOBBS, the oldest
farmer in the neighbourhood, by way
of testifying his appreciation of the
noble vocalist's efforts, threw on to
the platform a splendid vegetable
marrow, which he had been saving
up for the Harvest Festival.
"A wonderful child was Lady
ARABELLA MULLION, now COUNTESS
OF HELSTON," writes Musical Home
Chat. "While she was still a
prattling infant, she used to accom-
pany her mother to the Ballad Con-
certs, and before she had completed
her eighth year she could play several
tunes with one finger on the piano.
Her father, an accomplished per-
former on the flageolet, knew too
much of the seamy side of the
musical profession willingly to let his
daughter follow it, but the ruling
passion was too strong. At the age
of fifteen she insisted on learning the
banjo, with results only too well
known in the most recherche draw-
ing rooms of Mayfair."
The Marquis of KINGUSSIE, who
made his debut at the Annual
Smoking Concert of the Cairngorm
Golf Club at Aviemore last Monday,
possesses a baritone voice of remark-
able flexibility and charm. Some of
his high notes have a shrillness which
is certainly rather disconcerting to
the naked ear; but this defect, if it
is a defect, will rapidly yield to the
training which the Marquis is under-
going in the studio of Professor
CODY GLOTT, the famous American
"voice-builder." The handling of his
solos throughout evinced the enthusi-
astic artiste, who was perfectly in
sympathy with his voluntarily
assumed task, and we can only say
that such a voice, apart from the
exalted rank of its possessor, would
enormously strengthen the ranks oi
the musical profession.

DISCU RSIONS.
A CHINESE RAILWAY.
THE young man with the square shoulders and the
clean-cut regular features had hitherto been a silent
listener to our conversation, but he now looked up—I
think somebody had mentioned Chinese railways and the
reform movement in China—and began to speak. The
crispness of his voice and the intonation of his sentences
confirmed the impression made by his intelligent, deter-
mined face, and declared him to be, as in fact he was,
an American. He spoke with no semblance of swagger,
but cheerfully and meditatively, with a suggestion of
finding in his own doings an amusing subject of study.
1 will try to set down his story, but I cannot undertake
to guarantee the proper names.
"Yes," he said, "the Chinese are going ahead.
Their railroad system isn't so bad, and they 're making
it better all the time. Still, there are some things they
might learn from you. I had a queer experience not
long ago when I was Acting Consul-General at Haifoo.
It was one on me at the finish, but while it lasted I was
no end- of a fellow, quite the death-dealing white man
taking up his burden—you know the sort. I '11 tell you
how it happened.
"I 'd had information that there was a bright sort of
rascal at Haifoo, a man named OTlANLON, who 'd
cleared out of the United States at the time of the
Dakota land frauds. He 'd got any amount of rich
friends who were interested in getting him away, and
keeping him away for fear he might save his skin by
going on the witness-stand and getting them convicted.
Anyway he quit, and the United States Government
wanted him back in the land of the free, and they
instructed me to lay hands on him, secure his extra-
dition from the Chinese authorities, and bring him down
to Chien-lin, where somebody else was to take him over
and ship him off to America to stand his trial.
"Well, I got the chap easily enough, and the Chinese
made no difficulty about the extradition. That was all
plain sailing, but the rest didn't seem quite so smooth.
O'HAXLOS himself didn't look up to much. Pretty poor
wreck of a man he was when I got him. Been
wandering over China for months and didn't look as if
he 'd got any kick left in him. Seemed kind of happy
to get caught and have the American Eagle flapping
over him. Still, I 'd heard he could command any
amount of money, and 1 thought surely some of his
friends would feel like risking a dollar or so to keep him
out of America. I tell you it made me mighty careful,
and whenever I saw any rough fellow slouching about I
made sure it was one of O'HAXLON'S gang looking for a
chance of rescuing him.
'The Chinese gave me a guard of three soldiers, great
big fellows, but no grit in them, about as fierce as a
ten-year-old cow in a pasture, and on the appointed day I
marched O'HAXLOX to the station at Haifoo and packed
him into the train. I had a whole car reserved for
me, and I fixed him up somewhere in the middle of it.
I put two soldiers at one end of the car and one at the
other, and I told them if they let anyone in, 110 matter
who it might be, they 'd have to do without their heads
for the rest of their lives. Then I went off to finish up
the last extradition formalities with the Chinese officer
who 'd come to the station with me, and when I 'd got
all the papers signed it was starting time and I went
back to my prisoner. You may judge my feelings when
I found three Chinese toughs sitting with him and
talking to him.
"O-ho, thought I, the game 's begun." By this time
we were started and the train had got some way on. I 'd
got a six-shooter, but I guessed I 'd try persuasion first,
and not being much on the Chinese language I let go in
English. I told 'em politely they 'd got to quit, and
I 've no doubt I looked pretty angry. Two of them
moved off sharp and didn't trouble me, but the third
wouldn't budge. "Me no go," he said. "Out you
go," said I, " or I '11 shift you." "Me no can go. Me
belong this side," was all his answer. Well, there was
nothing for it. I got a good hold of him, lifted him up,
shoved him along the car and threw him out at the rear
end into the brake-van. He didn't fight much, just
resisted passively and clawed hold of things. He made
an almighty crash when I threw him, but my blood \vas
up and I didn't care if I broke his neck. "Next station
out you go," I called to his remains, and with that
and a quiet word to inv soldier I went back to
O'HAXLON.
"When the train stopped at the next station I vac-ed
along to the brake-van. There was O'HANLOX'S friend,
right enough. He was writing on a bit of paper, but 1
didn't wait for him to finish—just grabbed him, and away
he went on to the track. Back he came, and I tell you
we had a high old time in that brake-van, back and
forth. The train was moving, but I didn't care; I was
bound to throw him out, and at last I did it. He fell
like thunder, but he was up directly, racing after the
train. They must have paid him pretty well, I thought,
to show such nerve. As he ran he passed his bit oi
writing to a fellow standing by—a confederate, of course
—and went on a hundred miles an hour till he got to the
front part of the train. There by some miracle he
hitched on and got in.
"When we arrived at the second station I was on
the look-out, but nothing happened except that
they brought me a telegram from the authorities of the
railroad company. It asked me to allow their officials
to inspect the train, or something of that sort. I didn't
quite understand it, but it didn't worry me. They
might inspect all they pleased so long as they left
O'HANLON with me. However, nothing more happened,
and I delivered up the prisoner tight and comfortable at
Chien-lin. So that 's how I bested the O'HAXLOX
gang." There was a pause after the ex-Consul-Genoral
had finished his story. Then someone asked him If he
had ever found out anything more about the Chinaman
whom he had thrown out. "That fellow? " he laughed.
'You bet I did. He was the conductor of the train.
That bit of writing he passed on the platform was the
cause of the telegram I got. Plenty of sand he had
but it all came of their conductors not wearing uniforms.
I guess he's had about enough of mad Americans."
"Patrick Reynolds," says a correspondent in a con-
temporary, " has been a smoker of tobacco for 96 years.
He took to the use of the weed at the age of thirteen
and is therefore now 109 years old." This shows the
mistake of beginning too early. If he had only waiter
till he was twenty-five before he began smoking hi
would have been certain of living till he was 121.

WHISTLES: A WARNING.
DEAR MK. PUNCH,—In yours ol
August 5th there appeared an article
dealing with "The Use of the
Whistle." The. truth of the asser-
tions therein contained is incontest-
able, and the style in which they arc
set forth is unimpeachable, as I of all
the people in the world am most com-
petent to declare, being myself the
writer thereof. 15y that simple but
elegant monograph I have doubtless
gained for myself a world-wide repu-
tation as the final authority upon
Whistles, and I conceive you, Sir,
sitting at your desk in your shirt-
sleeves (with reversible cuffs) waiting
and waiting for another contribution
from my pen upon the same all-
important topic. The desire of your
heart is now about to be gratified.
Our chauffeur is a man of inven-
tion and not without ambition. In
the latter part of August he turned
his hand to the manufacture of an
instrument for the further oppression
of pedestrians. In short lie created
and fixed to the car a whistle, to 1;

thorn. When we came homo again
the family were keen to hear this
whistle, of which even I had ap-
proved. "Blow it," I said to tiie
inventor (without offence). "It will
not be blown when the car is at a
standstill," said he, dismissing my
exclamation of surprise with con-
tempt. "This is a racing car and
not a movable orchestra."
On the following day we set
forth to broak all records. We had
covered but ten miles of country
(with dust), whistling most of the
way, when a sharp turn brought us
to a level crossing, the gates of which
were being hurriedly shut as we
approached. We waited for ten
minutes lint no train eame. "This,"
s;iid I, "is not the way records are
broken," and I enquired of the
Shutter of Gates whether trains upon
that line were usually so late. "On
Hie contrary," said the S.-G., " this
train is an hour and a half before its
scheduled time." "But there is no
train to be seen," we shouted.
"Maybe," he answered, " but there
is one to be heard, for I heard it
whistling myself."
What a situation! To be pre-
vented by our whistle, devised for
the harassing and incommoding of
others only! We laughed our fill
and mounted to proceed, explaining
to the S.-G. the true state of affairs.
But we were not to proceed, for that
official combined with a loathsome
appearance an obstinate nature. He
would not believe us. We argued,
cursed, wept, swore, preached,
pointed out, abused, bribed, ridi-
culed, lectured, laughed, raved and
mentioned great names in vain. A
crowd of cattle and pedestrians,
1 icycles and carts, gathered there for
the same purpose as ourselves, made
ominous noises, but the S.-G. re-
mained unmoved. "If that was
your whistle," he said, "blow it"
(moaning nothing wicked), "and I
can judge for myself." Need I re-
mind you that, being unable to move
forward or backwards, we could not
gratify his lust for music?
How and when (if ever) the car
got away another must trll you, for
mine is not the nature to remain
upon a sinking ship when there is a
way out. All I know is that there
were no records, but only hearts,
broken that day. For the rest, if
e\er I have anything further to write
upon the subject of Whistles which is
fit for women and children to read,
\i'ii. Lucky Sir, shall have it.

MR. WALLER AND OTHERS.
AFTER Fuiisf, I indulged in what I
may perhaps venture to call a Waller-
purgis Night at the Lyric. 'flic
Duke'* Molfo ("I am here!") re-
minded me by its simplicity of the
motto of my College—founded by
ELIZAHETH DF. CLAUE of blessed
memory — which runs as follows:
Cave, adsiini! (I have always sup-
posed that these two words con-
stituted the entire stock of schoolboy
Latin known to the original Earl o'f
CLARE). Neither in form nor senti-

err on the side of subtlety; and in
this respect it was admirably re-

flective of a play that went straight
home to the primitive bosoms of a
September audience, out for blood.
The actual owner of the motto
expired almost as soon as he ap-
peared; but Hi'iiri di' Lagarderc
(Mr. WALLER) very generously took
it on, out of respect for a friend-
ship of two minutes' standing.
And it suited him well, for he gener-
ally (/vis there or thereabouts. And
this was fortunate, since he was the
whole play. The intervals during his
temporary absence were filled with
people in costumes — brigands, of
whom two persuaded themselves and
some of the audience, but not me,
that they were funny dogs; a colour-
less King who did little beside touch-
ing his hat; and courtiers who kept
on bowing and curtseying, but be-
tween times were largely negligible,
with the exception of Mr. SHIEL
BARRY, a gallant with a pretty
humour, and Miss SYBIL CARLISLE
who looked sweet and gentle.
There was also an interlude, in
which Miss DOROTHY MINTO gave
what is popularly supposed to be a
Spanish gipsy dance. Someone who
knows his Seville should tell her to
dance more from her hips and keep
her feet down.
I confess that I was a little disap-
pointed in the number of corpses
allotted to Mr.' WALLER'S sword. I
made out that his total bag was actu-
ally not more than a couple of brace;
and his best individual piece of work,
the killing of .7Vso/», was done off the
stage, and we had to take his word
for it.
A horn conqueror, I understand
that he is peculiarly irresistible at
matinees, for then the ladies are in
a strong majority. O. S.
DANGEROUS DRAMAS.
POIGNANT APPEAL.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I learn with
deep concern and indignation that at
only fourteen out of the nineteen
theatres now open in London is in-
terest directly focussed on the
wealthy classes. As England is the
richest country in the world, this
unpatriotic behaviour on the part of
these five theatres deserves to be
held up to the strongest reprobation.
The best teaching of proverbial philo-
sophy points to the paramount im-
portance of money. What are this
sinews of war but money'.' What is
it that makes the mare to go? And
again, in the racy phrase of a North-
country philosopher, "Them as "as
brass don't care a d what them
as 'asn't thinks on 'em." Yet in
spite of this overwhelming testimony
to the paramount value of the cult of
the Golden Calf, we find a play at
the Queen's Theatre in which the
interest centres on a poor inventor,
while Mr. FoRBKS-RoBERTSOK, at the
St. James's, devotee his great abili
ties to the impersonation of a super-
natural character. Worse still, at the
Duke of York's and the Aldwych the
central figures are a railway porter
and a poor clerk respectively! For
Heaven's sake, Mr. Punch, exert your
powerful influence to awaken the
public to the disastrous consequences
of neglecting to worship success and
bow the knee to Boodle. Trade is
bad, as the latest returns show. If
we cannot be rich, let us at least
reverence riches and banish from our
midst this most pestilent and per-
nicious of all miseries—the worship
of humility, frugality and failure.
Yours in great distress,
CRCKSUS JUNIOR.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
TIIK woman whom ROBERT ELSON would have us adore
is a minx (his own pet name for her) who suffers from
the illusion that her body is much cleaner than any-
body else's. To escape from a sordid situation as
mother's help in a third-rate Manchester villa, she makes
a marriage that is loveless on her side, and limited by
strictly Platonic conditions. The man whom the author,
with your true North-countryman's reverence for wealth,
wants us to delight in is a multi-millionaire made in
Sheffield. He picks up the lady without introduction
on the sands at Ilfnicombe; bribes her to become hie
wife in name; loads her vainly with dresses and jewels
and luxuries—all duly set out as in a shop-window;
leads a dog's life while she makes him ridiculous by her
stupid flirtations; and goes on hoping for the one thing
which his beastly money cannot buy. There is an
almost suburban naivete about the methods of the
author of The Magnate (HEINEMANN). He locates the
honeymoon in the
Riviera because he
has been there and
thinks that we should
all like to be told
something about the
neighbourhood and
hew the novel game,
ot roulette is played
at Monte Carlo.
Cannes, Nice and
Monte are called by
their real names, but
Mcntone is childishly
disguised as Torreiito,
Cap Martin as Cap
Montlerrat, La Mor-
tola as La Tombola.
There was a moment
in the early part of
the book when I felt
ashamed of perse-
vering, and wondered

SPECTATOR.
what the critics had found in it to flatter so loudly. I
never to the end discovered this, though the second half
is very good reading. I trust Mr. ELSON will not allow his
head to be turned by these reviewers. For a first effort
his book is well enough: it shows promise above the
average, and his study of the millionaire has many
merits. But let him in future concentrate his powers,
avoid catalogues and other unessentials, and use one
word where now he uses ten. And 1 hope he will grow
ont of the irritating habit of claiming for himself a
special erudition in the lore of Woman's ways; and also
not allow the lady who helps him in the millinery depart-
ment to have quite so free a hand.
My! Hully Mike! Gee! Gee Wiz! I swan!;
Mercy sakes! My Su/! It beats the Dutch! And'
really, you know, I think it does. But, according to Mr.
GEORGE NORMAN, and Mr. T. FISHER UNWIN, not for-
getting the Westminster Gazette, in which smartest
of smart Society journals Sylvia in Society first made
her curtsey to the polite, world, this is how Sylvia used
to talk at Dieppe when she was in one of her exclam-
atory moods. Who in Sam Hill, you naturally ask, is
Sylvia' I don't care a dite whether I tell you, but I 'd
as lief as not if you want I should. Mercy sakes! I 'm
crazed to have you know. I don't want to make a
towse about her, but you '11 be plumb-crazy and hoppin'
iiiad when I tell you she was less than a yard high, and
therefore, I suppose, not more than six years old. Most
like you 've been thinking she was the most poisonous
ole cockroach unbusted. Now haven't you? That only
shows you "re not worth a hooter. You 'vc been flying
right off the handle all the time, you everlasting poppy-
cock. But don't fret, honey. You needn't worry any. I 'in
about tuckered out quoting Sylvia, and bimeby I shall
hand in my checks and quit. Guess you think I 'in
puttin' on frills right from the jump. That only shows
what you know about li'l Sylvia and the American
language doesn't amount to a pile of beans. She wasn't
any hayseed, wasn't Sylvia, and she 'd gotten the
daisiest English aunt, as good as candy, and that 's a
cinch. Say, honey, aren't you tickled to death? Or
are you as mad as a pin? Stars and Stripes! I'm
through. Gee Willikins!
If industry were the principal quality demanded of a
novelist, Arnold the
Englishman (METH-
UKS) would bring im-
mediate fame to Mr.
FRANCIS AVELINHI.
The author has evi-
dently studied many
contemporary docu-
ments for the pur-
pose of making his
romance of the thir-
teenth century a
faithful picture, but
as he is entirely with-
out the power oi
selection I soon found
myself wishing that
his researches had not
been so thorough. He
seems to me to
have axes to grind,
and in the process
his poor hero is
elbowed into corners by a crowd of Cistercians,
Carmelites, Premonstratensians, Bernardines, biblici
sentcntiarii—and others. I felt at last as if I were
playing a game of hide-and-seek, in which Mr. AVELISG
was trying to conceal Arnoul and I was endeavouring to
find him. I did not care twopence whether .4moti
became a secular or a religious, but I did want him to
do something worthy of a hero of romance, and nothing
of the kind occurred till the tale was nearly told. Mr
AVELING has, in fact, failed to combine Ar no id's love
story with the bitter struggle of creeds, and in spite o:
some strong descriptive writing his book requires almosi
as much industry to read as it must have taken to write

The following notice appears in a Gloucester hotel: —

The method suggested certainly relieves one's boot-tree?
of a great deal of labour and responsibility, but is
acting quite fairly towards one's trousers to leave them
out of the treatment?

well through the brown with
his first, going to pieces—or
rather one of his teeth did—
on a stone in the third bite.
Having the honour, I now
negotiated a bath-bun, the
bogey for which is, I be-
lieve, 3. I got into diffi-
cult stuff with my second,
and could only manage a
nibble, and in the end SMITH
won. The- third, the rasp-
berry sandwich, I won in 4,
while SMITH was victorious
at the cheese cake and
chocolate eclair. We halved
the crumpet in two, and 1
won the muffin, SMITH get-
ting into casual butter. He,
however, took the meringue
and the apple dumpling, and
at the turn was two up.

on the strawberry ice. SMITH drove
on to the cup-brim with a good
swallow. I got off slightly better,

second, SMITH lifted the melted
remains. I saw I had only one
chance unless we were to play

grip, and playing well throng!), ran
the rest of it down with my second.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW A SISTER OF PERCY'S BECAME QUEEN.
"So you 're still a bachelor, eh, PERCY? " I remarked
as he flew in. "All right up to now," he said; but I
noticed at once that he was not in such high spirits as
on his previous visit. "My old termagants have had
other things to think about than marryin' me off. Been
havin' rid end of a ruction—a revolution and that. My
Mother ain't Queen now. One of my Sisters is. I call it
playin' it rather low down, if you ask me."
I asked for particulars.
"It 's a long story," he said, "and I daresay I
haven't got to the bottom of it. They don't tell us
more than they can help. But you '11 remember me
tellin' you I expected my poor old Mother would find
herself unpopular after loavin' 'em all up the pole as
she did over that silly swarmin' business? Well, she
did, and no mistake. They 've had a down on her ever
since. Went about bu/.zin' that she was past her work,
and it was time to think of lettin' out one of the young
Princesses to take her place. They always keep a few
handy, you know, in case of a vacancy on the throne.
Well, when my Lady-Mother got wind of what was
up she was awful wild. Got her scimitar out and made
a rush for the cells where the Princesses were, to settle
the whole lot of 'em. Only they were so well
guarded that she couldn't—which made her simply
frantic. Mind you, I 'm not excusin' her—but it was
only natural that, after having reigned such a dooce of a
time as four years she should cut up rather rusty at the
idea of abdicatin'.
"Next thing I heard was that they called a-meetin'
of the Cabinet to decide what was to be done with her.
/ wasn't there, of course, but, from what I picked up,
they voted for packin' her off to start a Colony some-
where on her own. She wouldn't hear of it—said she 'd
jolly well stick where she was and be hanged to 'em.
So they were in a bit of a fix.
"It was old CAROLINE that pulled 'em through by
coniin' forward with a confession. She 'd been gettin'
shaky for a long time, but it was the swarmin' that
broke Itcr up. Never the same bee afterwards. Now,
she said, she felt* she was nearin' her end, but she
couldn't fly off with a quiet conscience to the usual
dyin' place until she 'd unburdened herself of a State
Secret that had been weighin' on her mind ever since
it had been revealed to her by her aunt, who 'd had it
from her aunt, who 'd been told it by hers. So the
Council invited her to get it off her chest.
"Accordin' to CAROLINE, several generations ago the
Queen they had then was missin', and there wasn't a
single Princess ready to succeed her, and CAROLINE'S
great-great-aunt, bein' Prime Minister, saw something
had got to be done. Her first idea was to get hofd of a
worker-larva, slip it into a royal cell, and feed it up into
a Sovereign of sorts. But there didn't happen to be a
larva about who was young enough to fill the bill. So
what did CAROLINE'S unscrupulous great-great-aunt do
but go off on the quiet to a neighbourin' State, sneak a
common larva of theirs, bring it home, and pass it oft
as the rightful heiress. 'That larva,' said old CAROLINE,
with quavering antennse, ' is her present Majesty!'
"I call it a jolly thin story myself," was PERCY'S
comment, " and it 's my belief that either old CAROLINE
was dotty or else she 'd been put up to tellin' it. If her
great-greaf aunt ever had managed to get into a foreign
city, she 'd have been stung to death long before she
could have boned a larva. What?"
But I could not help remembering that in The Lore of
the Honey-Bee it was stated that in certain emergencies
worker-bees have been known to resort to such unprin-
cipled expedients. I feared that the scandal was only
too well founded, though, of course, I did not mention
this impression to PERCY.
"Well, when the old girls heard CAROLINE'S rigmarole
they declared they 'd suspected something all along—
there were lots of little things they 'd noticed in the
Quoen (so they said) that showed bad breedin'—though
they 'd never belreved till then she was actually a low-
born foreigner. Anyway, it gave 'em the excuse they
wanted for gettin' rid of her.
"It may have been necessary, but what I barred was
the way they went about it. It isn't etiquette, it seems,
to use violence to the Queen, so—you mayn't believe
it — those confounded humbuggin' jades all closed
round and kept on cuddlin' her till they 'd cuddled the
life out of her! I saw them at it, and though I only
knew my Lady-Mother by sight and she wouldn't have
known me from a bluebottle if she 'd ever noticed me on
the comb, still, after all, family ties do go for something,
and I did think it was a bit loo thick. So did ALGIE
and REGGIE and poor old Gi's. We shouted ' Sharne!'
round the corner, but we might have been so many
maggots for all the effect it had I
No sooner was she no more than they proclaimed
one of my Sisters. She 'd been out and crawlin' about
for some time, but none of us had noticed her. But I
will say she made a rippin' Queen. I felt quite proud of
her at the Coronation. Top-hole, she looked! Then she
sailed off on her weddin' journey with some poor devil
of a drone from the next State, and when she arrived
home alone I can tell you she had something Jike a
reception. The old girla went almost off their heads
with excitement. Though the.y kept its out ot it—
we weren't even allowed-to come and offer our con-
gratters to our own Sister! Humiliatia', I call it.
What?
But I must say her next proceediu' rather put me
off; for she went straight to the other Eoyal cells, which
had been left unguarded on purpose, and polished off all
the Princesses, one by one, with her scimitar. Seemed
to be enjoyin' it, too! Girls will be girls, I suppose, and
she had her position to think of; but, all the same, a
fellow don't like to see any sister of his goin' on like
that, and it 's given me a fit of the blues.
"One good thing about all this," he continued more
cheerfully, "it 's put all that matchmakin' nonsense
out of their heads so far as / 'm concerned, as I said
when I came in. I 'm begiunin' to hope they 've given
up ARCHIE and ALGIE and Gus and me as hopeless bad
jobs by this time."
"But mayn't they get tired of keeping you some day,
PERCY?" I ventured to hint.
"They may get as tired as they like, dear old chap,"
was his reply, " but they 've jolly well got to keep me!"
I said nothing. After he had flown away I wondered
whether I ought not to have warned him, as I might
have by the knowledge I had gained from Mr. TICKNER
EDWARDES' volume, of the fate that awaited him,
whether he married or remained single.
But no warning of mine could avert it, even if it
succeeded in shaking an optimism which was probably
incorrigible. I thought—and still think—that silence was
the truest kindness. F. A.

Mr. W. Yes, at Bentwood.
Mrs. De F. He was not grey then,

Mr. W. No, he 's greyer than his

Mrs. De F. Let me see, how old
would you say he is?
Mr. W. Forty-seven, I should
guess, or perhaps forty-eight.
Mrs. De F. Oh, do you think so?
I should have said forty-six at the
most. But how very young he

Mr. W. Yes. This is a nice gar-

SCENE—The Library of u Country House. He is
writing at a table near the window, with his bade
turned to Her. She is standing irresolutely in the
middle of tlie room behind an armchair, which she
has just dragged and pushed laboriously from its
usual place. The time is 3 p.m.
He (turning round upon her suddenly), I wish to
heaven you wouldn't make such a frightful racket in the
room! I can't get a thing written, and I counted ou an
hour or two of quiet.
.S/ie. Oh, don't bother about your writing now. You '11
have to give it up anyhow in about twenty minutes, so
you may as well get up at once and help me with these
chairs.
He (pcttislily). Bother the chairs! Why can't you
leave them as they are'' But you 're never happy unlestt
you 're moving gigantic pieces of furniture fitom erne
place to another. My wardrobe, for instance. -Where 's
that gone? It was in my dressing-room two days ago,
and now
She (appealing to the universe). There—he grudges
me the wardrobe, the only place where I can really put
anything comfortably. He wants it for his coats and
his trousers and his overgrown riding-lx>ots. And I 'm
not to have even a tiny corner to hang a dress in.
CHARLES, how can you be so selfish and so heartless?
He (desperately). Oh, take the wardrobe
She. I have.
He. Take everything. I never met a woman yet who
didn't consider a man selfish for wanting to keep what
belongs to me.
She. Him, CHARLES, him. You "re getting your pro-
nouns mixed. However, if you '11 help me with these
chairs, I '11 forgive you even that.
He. But what on earth do you want to move the
chairs for? Why can't you leave them where they are?
«S'/ic (again to the universe). He 's forgotten again.
Didn't I see an advertisement of Memory Powders some-
where the other day? CHARLES, you must take one in

help your writing, too, you know. You 're. always for-
getting where the quotations come from
He (jumping from his chair). Will you or will you not
tell me what game you 're up to?
She (placidly). I 'm not sure I like that expression,
CHARLES. It doesn't seem to be quite in your best "four-
guineas-a-thousand" style. "What game you 're up
to"! No.no. "What design you are contemplating,
or "What project you have aet your hand'to." I'm
sure something of that sort
He. If I were a weaker and a more brutal man, I 'd
throw you out of the room
• She. Don't be unjust to yourself, CHARLES.
He. Once more; what are you up to?
She (cheerfully). Now honestly, CHARLES, do you
really mean to say you 've forgotten that the S.P.A. are
to meet here at 3.30 to-day?
He (passing his hand over his forehead). The S.P.A.?
What *8 that? Senatus Populus—-no, that won't do.
What is it?
She. Don't be absurd, CHARLES. You know well
enough it 's the Stocking and Petticoat Association.
He (blankly). Never heard of it.
She. My dear! It 's had two meetings here already.
He. No. That was the Tea and Coal Club.
She. Same thing. It 's changed its name. Instead
of giving tea and coal to the parents, we 're going to
give stockings and petticoats to the children.
He. Oh, that 's it, is it? But why is it to meet in
this room? We had it in the dining-room last time.

all sitting round the dining-room table. \Ve shall be

to be said. / know that well enough.
She. Thai 's a good sensible boy. Now

thing to do?

could I know you meant that? Listen. (She takes up
the minute-book from a chair and reads): "Monday,

A SERVANT OF THE PUBLIC.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I have read with profound admira-
tion the letter that Mr. S. F. EDGE has addressed to The
Times. He promises, in deference to public feeling, to
abstain in future from entering his motor cars (he men-
tions their name) for dangerous and abnormal competi-
tions; with the proviso that, if this abstention is found
to affect his business unfavourably, he will conclude
that he has " mistaken the trend of public feeling" and
will again "lead the way," as he modestly says, in
these, unnatural contests. I like Mr. EDGE'S hedging,
and I am going to imitate it. I am a female writer oi
disgusting and nauseous novels: but in deference to
public protests I shall in future abstain from this kind
of thing and take to clean writing. If, however, my
sales fall off, I shall conclude that I have " mistaken the
trend of public feeling*;" and shall revert to my wallow-
ing in the mud. Yours faithfully,
ANOTHER HEDGER.

AT WILLIAM'S WEDDING FEAST.
I ENVIED not the novel bliss
That glittered, WILLIAM, in your
eyes;
I should have held it much remiss
Had you looked otherwise,
And your hilarious moods did not
Cast shadows on my single lot.
Your blushing bride (who won all
hearts)
I gazed upon without annoy;
She seems a thing of pleasing parts,
What about dross, dear boy?
But all her charms did not abate
The comfort of my lonely state.
No, WILLIAM, no. Howc'er divine
Your fortune (and the girl's) may
be,
I yet remained convinced that mine
Was good enough for me;
And I had been contented still
But for those lovely presents, BILL!
Silver on silver, new and old,
Rich furnitures for either sex,
The jewels, WILLIAM, and the gold,
The cheques, ah gods, the
cheques!—
Oh, WILLIAM, WILLIAM, these to scan
Was painful to a single man.
And ever as I gazed, my breast
Grew heavy with a growing doubt;
What had you done to be so blest?
Why should I go without?
Nay, to upset my simple mind
Was bad, but worse remains behind.
I could condone the jealous fire
You kindled in a lonely bard;
But, WILLIAM, was it well to hire
A sleuth from Scotland Yard
And put him there as sentinel?
That was not well. It was not well.
DUM-DUM.
THE CITY OF DREADFUL
WHITE.
AT a mass meeting held on the
Flip Flap last week, to decide as to
whether or no the White City should
be an Eternal City, there were
present H.R.H. the PRINCE OF
WALES, Sir GEORGE WHITE (in
the Chair), Mr. RICHARD WHITEING,
Messrs. A. and C. BLACK, Sir JAMES
CRICHTON-BROWNE, Messrs. GREEN-
ING, Mr. J. B. PINKER, the Mayor of
READING, Sir EDWARD GHEY, various
representatives of the Yellow Jour-
nalism, and a variety of coloured
gentlemen.
On the opening of proceedings
letters were read from various foreign
Powers that wished for an entente
with Great Britain, and thought that
Shepherd's Bush might help to
cement such a bond. The. Prince of
MONACO suggested a Monaco-British
Exhibition, and offered a handsome
subsidy towards it and the loan of a
royal bodyguard of croupiers. "In
this case," he wrote, " the colloquial
name might be the Rouge et Noir
City, and the Earl of ROSSLYN would
perhaps take the place of Mr. IMRE
K i HALEY."
President CASTRO also wrote asking
that a Venezuelo-British Exhibition
might be arranged, with the substitu-
tion of a Great Wheel (at several
Revolutions a minute) for the Flip
Flap.
The Chairman then called upon
the meeting to offer suggestions as to
(1) the desirability of opening the
Exhibition again next year, and (2)
the nature of the Exhibition to be
held.
, His Royal Highness the PKIXCK OF
WALES suggested that next year a
quite new kind of Exhibition should
be held—an Exhibition that was
really ready for the public on the
day it was opened. That, he said,
would be a novelty worth visiting.
(Loud cheers, during which H.R.H.
returned to Marlborough House.)
Sir JAMES CRICHTON-BROWNE said
he was in favour of continuing the
Exhibition, but he failed to see why
they should continue to show such
exclusive preference to one colour—
if, indeed, it was a colour at all.
The only advantage about a White
City was that it was the easiest to
paint red. (Sensation.) Sympa-
thising as he did with his friend
CARLYLE in his estimate of human
folly, he thought the best thing to do
with it was to convert it into a resi-
dential estate for vegetarians, and re-
christen it the Green City.
Sir THOMAS MOUNTAIN DEWAR sug-
gested that the Exhibition should be
continued under the title of the
Black and White City. The Editors
of The Graphic, The Sphere, and
The Illustrated London News strongly
protested.
Mr. GEORGE R. SIMS pointed out
that London was singularly deficient
in an adequate museum of crimin-
ology. Madame TUSSAUD did what
she could, poor old lady, but her
space was limited, and Scotland Yard
showed a curious and old-fashioned
reluctance to admit the public to view
its treasury of turpitude. The Shep-
herd's Bush buildings were admir-
ably suited for the display of morbid
relics, reconstructed crimes and so
forth. His suggestion was to hold a
Murder Exhibition next year and call
it the Black City.
Mr. JOSEPH LYONS said that his
idea of an Exhibition was an Exhibi-
tion where people got hungry. It
did not in the least matter what they
saw. All that was needed was
plenty to sec and plenty to cat. If
he had his way the present Exhibi-
tion would remain untouched, but
the title would be changed—say to
Russo-British or Gneco-Roman, or
anything catchy.
M. PAILLARD, the famous Parisian
restaurateur, supported Mr. LYONS.
The great thing, he said, was to
choose a good name. Nothing mat-
tered after that. The people came
and asked no questions.
Mr. TOM B. DAVIS, the manager of
the Lyric Theatre, said that as
Honorary President of the K.O.W.
League he had no hesitation in ex-
pressing his opinion that the White
City ought to be the permanent and
abiding home of the \Vhitest of
White Men—need he say that he
referred to their idolised friend Mr.
LEWIS WALLER?
Mr. CHIRGWIN, who addressed the
meeting through the spout of a
patent coffee-pot of his own inven-
tion, was understood to say that if
the Exhibition was going to be re-
served for Albinos he would have to
reorganize his entire complexion.
General ROGER POCOCK, command-
ing the Legion of Frontiersmen,
pleaded eloquently for the conver-
sion of the Exhibition buildings into
a permanent barracks for his famous
corps. Camping out in the open was
all very well in a tropical or sub-
tropical climate, but there were
moments when even his hard-bitten
veterans hankered after a roof. For
himself he would be content with the
Court of Honour if the Stadium were
covered in for the gallant fellows
who had escorted LA MILO in her
perilous ride through the streets of
Coventry, and who were all ready to
do the same service for the biblical
hornpipist of the Palace. (Cheers.)
Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON said that it
gave him great pleasure to sustain
>the role of skeleton at the feast.
They could not all hope to live for
ever. (Applause.) What better use
could they make of the White City
than paint it black and turn it into
a standing reminder of their mor-
tality? It might then be utilised for
a great Exhibition of mausoleums,
cenotaphs, sarcophagi, cinerary urns,
tombs, vaults, epitaphs and other
funereal adjuncts. Music would natu-
rally form an important feature at
such a show, and he had already
composed one-hundred-and-fifty vari-
ations on "Down Among the Dead
Men " for the opening concert.

A novelist and dramatist, who pre-
ferred to remain incognito, and who
had red hair, a Shakspearean brow,
three legs and no tail, suggested that
the Exhibition should be transformed
into a permanent wax-work repre-
sentation of the characters in his

A similar suggestion was made by
a, retiring lady from Stratford-on-
Avon with regard to the romances
from her- pen. (No offers.)
The meeting then dispersed with-
out coming to any definite conclu-

Exhibition there is every reason to

ance of Faust, in which, as everyone

on fren/.y. "Pardon my intrusion,"
he observed in soul-shaking accents,

THE COMPLETE KITCHEN.
I SAT in the drawing-room afti-r
dinner with my knees together and
my hands in my lap, and waited
for the game to be explained to me.
"There 's a pencil for you," said
somebody.
"Thank you very much," I said,
and put it carefully away. Evidently
I had won a forfeit already. It
wasn't a very good pencil, though.
"Now, has everybody got pen-
cils?" asked somebody else. "The
game is called 'Furnishing a
Kitchen.' It 's quite easy. Will
somebody think of a letter?" She
turned to me. "Perhaps you 'd
better."
"Certainly," I said, and I immedi-
ately thought very hard of N. These
thought-reading games are called
different things, but they are all the
same really, and I don't believe in
any of them.
"Well?" said everybody.
"What? . . . Yes, I have. Go
on. . . Oh, I beg your pardon," I
said in confusion. I thought you
N is the letter."
"N or M?"
I smiled knowingly to myself.
"My godfather and my god-
mother," I went on cautiously
"It was N," interrupted some-
body. "Now then, you 've got five
minutes in which to write down
everything you can beginning with
N. Go." And they all started to
write like anything.
I took my pencil out and began to
think. I know it sounds an easy
game to you now, as you sit at your
dfesk surrounded by dictionaries; but
when you are squeezed on to the
edge of a sofa, given a very blunt
pencil and a thin piece of paper, and
challenged to write in five minutes
(on your knees) all the words you
can think of beginning with a certain
letter—well, it is another matter
altogether. I thought of no end of

AMONG THE DUKERIES.
THE way in which marriages are
made in Mayfair has long been an
unwritten scandal. You start by
being already married and sick of
your old wife; then you get a divorce
in some obscure country, such as
Switzerland, by a process which
doesn't count in England; then you
marry again and are still received in
a Society that is rotten to the
marrow. It was high time that the
whole ugly system was exposed; and
Mr. CECIL RALEIGH, like the ardent
reformer he is, has undertaken to do
so, with Mr. HAMILTON'S assistance,
at Drury Lane. It is true that in his
drama, The Marriages of
Mayfair, there is only one
Mayfuir marriage, and that
a perfectly sound one; so
that the moralist's design
might have escaped our
notice but for a long pre-
monitory interview in the
Press, in which he clearly
defined his lofty motive.
Yet I half fear that the
pulpit homilies of Father
BERNARD RALEIGH are like to
be overwhelmed by the gor-
geous pomp and ritual sup-
plied by Lay-brother COL-
LINS; and that many an err-
ing Mayfair sheep, that
should have left the sacred
edifice resolved to make
cleaner marriages in future,
will retain nothing but vivid
pictures of RIJMPELMAYER'S,
of the theft of the Tower
jewels, of a warm corner in
the Dulte of Ermoort coverts,
with a cock-pheasant stuck
fast in mid air, and of a
villain and a pony precipitated
down an Alpine snow-shoot.
before Lord Alaric's second marriage.
Unfortunately there is but one person
who can witness to the date of her
death, and ho is a gentleman of so
obscure a life that he is only trace-
able once a year in a hospice on the
top of a snow-bound Alpine pass.
However, he is run to earth, and
admits that the deceased lady, of
whom he has many kind things to
say, perished in a neighbouring drift
two years before Lord Alaric's second
marriage. This contented everybody
but mjasclf, I being left wondering
how-8110 contrived to die a whole year
before her own divorce.
Another thing that troubled me
was the stupidity of the Tower guard.

performance at which we jointly
assisted—namely, a knock-out fight
at a Calcutta circus—and in defer-
ence to his dignity I refrained.
The cast included several very
capable performers, to whose credit
it must be laid that they never let
you see their cheeks bulging with
their tongues. Mr. LYN HARDING
seemed really to enjoy himself as the
villain. His presence on the stage
always inspires me with confidence,
so sound are his methods; and he
doesn't mind what he plays in, from
SHAKSPEARE to RALEIGH. Miss EVA
Moo HE was very graceful and natural,
although she suffered dreadfully from
second-sight. This infirmity was
shared by Mr. CHEVALIER,
who shot a beater in the
middle of the thigh and ex-
cused himself on the ground
that he mistook the fellow's
feet for a rabbit. It was
very difficult after this buf
foonery, and his previous
comic vagaries, to take seri-
ously the .many noble sent
merits which he threw (ff

which greatly impressed the

People who sacrifice their
dinner so as to be in time for
the First Act should be
warned to bring matches and

shrouds the intervals between
the scenes (rendered more
appalling by a pitiless orches-
tra) they will be unable to
consult the chart and get
their bearings in a -nost be-
wildering sea of characters.
A final tribute of praise is

I am certain that the intelligence
of a Drury Lane audience is higher
than mine: for nobody else seemed
to be worried about the plot, which,
as I gathered, runs as follows: —

himself divorced in Switzerland from
his first wife, and irithin a year mar-
ries Lady. Margaret Constable. Hiq
son by this second marriage eventu-
ally inherits the Marquisate of Deer-
minster. It is then shown that the
Swiss divorce was invalid in our
courts, and that therefore the new
Marquis was not born in good British
wedlock. He is accordingly ousted
from his title. But there is still a
chance left of restoring his poor
mother's honour. The first wife is
known to be .dead; it is merely a
question of proving that she died tempted to remind him of another j as Duke of Tadcastcr, Lord Stryne

etc. "The Worm" is a term of
boyish endearment applied to
Allan Marchmont, a delightful out-
sider; but I never discovered that he
did anything to deserve the attribute
of "early." The epithet must
have been thrown in just for joy.
Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH played the
part with infinite relish. Miss FANN\
BROUGH, as Lady Steyne, lightly
ignored the nominal dignity of her
Asocial status, and made a really
admirable domestic shrew; and Mr.
ALFRED BISHOP, as her en-ant lord
preserved, with great decorum, the
traditional demeanour of the weaker
vessel. It was impossible to mis-
take Mr. MATTHEWS for a Duke, and
to do him justice he made no attempt
to impose upon us. Indeed,
thought he carried to greater length:
than usual his charming air of indif-
ference, as if he found the whole
thing too absurd. Miss MURIEL
BEAUMONT was very attractive, and
Mr. BASKCOMB a really humorous
figure as a yacht-steward, whom the
rival lovers bribe to fall overboard
that they may rescue him and so
establish a claim to valour in their
lady's eyes.

FOR THE CHAUFFEUR.
1. DON'T in busy places run over
sixty miles an hour, or, in fact, over
anything that is likely to injure your
reputation or the car.
2. Don't take up a lot of room in
turning street corners. All self-
respecting chauffeurs do this on the
two outside wheels.
3. Don't creep under the ear at
every little dislocation. This, be-
sides suggesting the comic postcard,
looks cowardly. If the fault be actu-
ally underneath, wait until the car
turns over of itself, then operate
before righting it.
N.B.—An exception to this rule is
where a constable is seen approach-
ing with his notebook, in which case
both owner and chauffeur may do
well to crawl beneath the chassis
for a space.
4. Save with an upward lift of the
eyebrows or a downward turn of the
mouth, never deign to notice other

2. Cultivate the motor bow. It
is less formal than the carriage bow,
and is sometimes accompanied by a
flutter of the left hand.
3. Back up your husband's protest
at a " hold-up " by the police with a
look of haughty astonishment, as if
to say, "But surely this is absurd!
We were only doing seventy miles
an hour."
4. In town, if the car is a showy
one, leave it palpitating at the shop
door while you purchase your pins
or tape. The sound of it may

ONE of the critics of Diana Mallory (SMITH, ELDER)
observes that in reading it " we soon feel as if we had
been at A reception by a highly popular hostess with a
wide circle of political friends." I 'm not so sure that
I do feel this. I suppose I ought to appreciate more
than I do the high privilege of reading the minds of the
eminent politicians, from the PRIME MINISTER down-
wards, whom Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD brings into relation
with her latest heroine. But, except that I enjoy the
shrewd knocks which she deals to such people as plat-
form women of the baser sort and wealthy democrats
who must have the best of everything, the political part
of the book leaves me cold. It seems to me more
artificial than the work which one naturally expects from
the creator of Robert Elsincrc and Sir George Trcssady.
study in character-drawing Marsham is a masterly
achievement. But as a fit mate for Diana he is
impossibte. And I think Mrs. WARD asks too much it
she expects us all to be as forgiving as Diana.

It is like a picture-frame, carefully squared and neatly
dovetailed, but composed of machine-made moulding
which can be turned out by the yard. On the other
hand the portrait of Diana herself is in all respects
natural and charming; and Fcrrier, the Opposition
leader, .S'i'r James Chide, the eminent lawyer, and one
or two other of the most prominent characters are well
and truly drawn. But when we come to the figure of
Oliver Marsh am, the weak, vacillating, insincere member
of the Radical Party, who is throughout the object of
Diana'* love, the general harmony of the picture is to my
mind spoilt. At his mother's instigation he feebly con-
sents to break off his engagement to Diana, on dis-
covering that her mother had been condemned to death
for a murder which was in reality only an act of self-
defence, and he is basely disloyal to Ferrier, his party-
leader. Yet in spite of these two acts of treachery, both
of them the natural outcome of his character, Diana
continues to love him, and eventually marries him on
what is wrongly supposed to be. his death-bed. As a
ELLIS in conversation. But the theme is so attractive
that, having turned back in vain attempt to see where
odd sentences lead to, one can pass on to be reminded
of SYDNEY SMITH'S sparkling wit or Lady HOLLAND'
studied rudeness. The value of the book, which is
great, is increased by the reproduction of portraits oi
most of the. men whose names are associated with
Holland House. A company that included SAMUEL
ROGERS, SYDNEY SMITH, BYRON, GUIZOT, SHERIDAN

drawn together, and its equal has not since fore-
gathered.

"THE ARGONAUT."
[D'mje on tlie lose of Dr. Lining famous Steam Yaclit, Mored ly
TOLL for the gallant ship just gone below,
And with your salt tears swell the briny main;
Yea, let the universal chest heave-ho
To think that she will never float again;
Never., in charge of her respected skipper,
Carry to Isles of Greece the cultured tripper.
.What high and hallowed memories haunt her sleep 1
Visions of poets rampant on the poop,
Rehearsing HOMER'S views about the deep,
Or flinging off at some enchanted group
A lyric wail inspired by southern waters,
Yet not unfit for clerics' wives and daughters;—
Visions of scholars, steeped in antic lore,
Who, in return for food and passage free,
Played showman to the panoramic shore
Or else located legends of the sea—
The spot where Bacchus found the lady stranded,
Or Aphrodite left the foam and landed;--
Visions of spinsters, dumped in Greekish ports,
Consulting guide-books on the glorious age
When good old PINDAK boomed the Olympian sports
And SoPHOCLES repaired the Attic stage;
While ushers pointed out that trams and steamers
Were still unknown to these delightful dreamers.
Yet, though we mourn the fair ship's dolorous fate,
She might have ended worse; she might have sunk,
Some night of winter, with her homing freight
Of pedagogues, wrapt each within bis bunk,
Wasting the local tips that they 'd collected
And leaving many a schoolboy much dejected.
Nor you, O Doctor, count yourself undone:
She was insured, I hear; and soon you Ml build
A second Argonaut to sally, LUNN,
On the old trail with all her cabins filled,
And, ere her educative- mission ceases,
Carpet your nest with further Golden Fleeces.

A PUNCH EXHIBITION.
THIS is to give notice that Mr. Punch proposes, early
in next year, to make an unparalleled Exhibition of
himself. He therefore begs to invite all his friends who
possess any desirable memorials of his career—from its
inception in 1841 to the present day—to be kind enough
to make him a temporary loan of them.
This is the class of thing he wants :—
(1) Original drawings by Mr. Punch's artists, especially
those whose work is over.
(2) Prints, lithographs, coloured plates, etc., from
pictures by Mr. Puncli'x artists.
(3) Documents and autograph letters relating to Mr.
Puiicli.
(4) Manuscripts of Mr. Punch's articles.
(5) Objects of interest that have been in the possession
of Mr. Punch'ft men.
The above will be very gratefully received, cared for,
and eventually returned by MESSRS. BRADIU'RY. AGNEW &
Co., Punch Office, 10, Bouverie Street, Whitefriars, E.C.
PERCY'S LAST VISIT.
ABOUT the middle of July the weather suddenly turnec
wet and chilly. I had not seen PERCY for some days
and was feeling considerable anxiety about him, when hi
suddenly appeared one morning at my window, whiel
was fortunately open. But on this occasion he did no
fly in—he crawled over' the sill, and had to wait ther
some time before he could muster up sufficient strengtl
to wing h'is way on to my breakfast-table. I was greatl;
shocked by the change in him; it was difficult to recog
nise the trim and debonair drone he had once been ii
the abject dishevelled creature that clung trembling ti
the toast-rack. "I 'm done for, dear boy," he said
with a pitiable effort to preserve his former jauntiness
"These infernal old judies have put me in the cnrt thi
time! Only looked in to say good-bye and that."
I said I hoped things weren't so bad as he seemed t<
think, that " while there was life," etc.; but even as '.
said the words I felt how horribly banal they mus
sound.
"Wait till you "ve hoard! " he said; he was too un
nerved to say more just then. "There 's been a goo(
deal goin' on lately," he began at last, "which struct
me as rum, though I didn't think much of it at th<
time. They 've been doosid stingy with the bee-mill
for one thing, and cut me off my nectar altogether. ]

Then, the other day I found MATILDA and URSULA r.nc
some others haulin' the little nipper-drones out of theii
cells before they were half hatched, and pitchin' 'em
over the terrace!' Why the dooce can't you let the
poor little beggars alone'.1' I said. 'What harm have
they ever done you'?
'There 's hard times comin',' said MATILDA, ' and
the fewer mouths to feed the better.'
Well, I saw there was some sense in thai—but it
was the sort of way she said it that gave ine cold chills.
However, that soon passed off. But this mornin' "—
(he could not continue for a moment)—" this mornin
I was snoozin' comfortably in a corner when I was
awoke by a most fearful shindy. So I tumbled out t<
see what was happenin'. And a pleasant sight it wai

makin' for me. I didn't wait for her. Over and unde
the combs we went, and round and round—till by goo
luck I saw a heap of late pollen they 'd forgotten t
store, and dodged behind it. RHODA ran on, thinkin'
was ahead, and as soon as she 'd turned the corner
made a bolt for the gates. It wasn't much of a chance
for I knew it was old EMILY'S turn to be on guard, an
she 'd be safe to spot me before I could slip througl
She did right enough—but she let me pass, only tellir

wings close to the root, so that they '11 never fly any
more, and bundled 'em all over, neck and crop, to
starve! Last thing I saw was old Gus flounderin' on
his back in the grass, tryin' to make out what it was all
about. Poor dear old Gus—he wasn't over bright—but
one of the best! And by this time I expect they 've
served every blessed drone in the city the same way.
After all their talk about 'the good of the State,' too!
Perfectly rotten, / call it. I tell you what it is, my boy,
if we 'd only kept these Bee-women in their place,
instead of' lettin' 'em have everything their own way,
they 'd never have got above 'emselves as they have!
But there," he concluded dismally, "it's too late to
think of that now. The question is, What 's goin' to
become of Me ?''
"Why not stay here, PERCY? " I suggested. "I can
put you up. There ought to be enough for both of us."
He turned u lack-lustre f.ye on me. "What 's the
good of talkin' rot like that, dear fellow? " he said. "I
can't eat the sort of stuff you do. I want bee-milk, and
chyle, and lots of it, if I 'm to keep fit. Besides, as
I 've told you already, I 've never been taught to feed
myself. I 'm entirely dependent on those confounded
girls. Which reminds me I came away without my
breakfast this inornin', and I 'in feelin' uncommon
peckish. I shall liave to be gettin' back to 'em soon.
And yet if I do, they '11 nip my wing off and kick me
out as soon as look at me. It 's the dooce and all of
a hat to be in!"
It did seem to be a particularly unpleasant kind of
hat. I could only express my profoundest sympathy.
But gradually he trimmed and pulled himself into a
somewhat less despondent state. "I '11 go home and
chance it," he said. "I might manage to get round old
EMILY. If I could only get 'em to give me one last
blow-out of bee-milk before they gnawed my wing off, it
would be something to go on with. Well, old fellow,
I 'm afraid I 'm not very likely to run up against you
again, so I'll say 'Good-bye.'' And he flew out,
humming with a light-heartedness that was too ob-
viously assumed.
I saw him off, with a sad foreboding that it would be
his very last flight in this world.
# * * * * *.* *
"My foreboding proved, I am happy to say, to be
unfounded. Two or three mornings later I was equally
surprised and delighted on coming down to breakfast
to find PERCY waiting for me on the top of a loaf.
"Came round to tell you I was in clover again," he
said. "Thought you might like to know." And after
my landlady had brought in my bacon and eggs, he pro-
ceeded to relate his experiences. "I got back to the
hive the other mornin'," he said, " feeliu' as limp as a
last year's cocoon—didn't think I had an earthly! But
instead of tearing off my wing and givin' me the chuck,
they all came rushin' out to welcome me! 'It's
PERCY !' they cried. 'Oh, PKHCY, we were afraid you 'd
deserted us for ever!' And I'm blest if RHODA
didn't fling her forelegs round my neck! 'When I
left,' I said, 'I didn't notice that any of you were
exactly pressin' me to stay.' At that they all started
apologisin' and explainin'. It appears they 'd sacked
all of us they could get hold of because they 'd got
nervous about then? not bein' enough stores to go round.

Then they 'd found they 'd miscalculated somehow;
there was plenty of food for everybody, and later on
the State might come to grief for want of the very
drones they 'd been in such a hurry to get rid of!
Another of their confounded silly mistakes! But it
gave me my chance. 'All I came back for,' I said,
'was to tell you girls that, after the disgustin' ingrati-
tude you 've treated me with, I 've made up my mind
to cut the whole concern, and share, diggin's with a
Human Man pal of mine who knows how to appreciate
me!
"They said if I 'd only stay, they 'd agree to any
conditions I liked. First thing I insisted on was that
old Gi:s and the others should receive put-door
relief for the rest of their lives. It was the best' I could
do for the poor dear chaps. And the old girls are all
as meek as maggots noic—do everything I tell 'em to.

PERCY never came to see me again after that, so possi-
bly he really was made Prime Minister. In any case I
feel no further anxiety about him, as he is clearly able to
take extremely good care of himself. F. A.

He. But what 's the point of having a dinner? Why
have we got to give one? What 's the use
She (scornfully). Don't be a base utilitarian. There 's
no use in a cigarette, but you 're going to have one.
He. I am, if I can make one of your matches burn.
[He ttrilics a tcax match viciously. The top drops off
aliglit and settles on liis thumb.
He (nhaking the injured part violently). Ow! Ow!
Why will you have these rotten matches? I haven't
got a limb on my body which isn't burnt to a cinder
through this new mania of yours for cheap matches.
(He sucks his thumb vigorously.)
She (laughing heartily). Oh, my dear CHARLES, if
you could see yourself now 1
He. That's right; laugh away. I suppose if you
saw me blazing all over you 'd think it the best joke
in the world. (Continues sucking.)
She (seriously). Certainly not, CHARLES. I should
be very, very sorry. I should run very fast for the
extinguisher, and 1 should do my best—yes, CHARLES,
my very best—to put you out. How can you be so
cruel as to doubt me? (Turns her head away, sniffs,
and dabs her eyes with a handkerchief.)
He (laughing unra'sily). Oh, don't let 's have any more
nonsense. About this dinner, now. What day did
you
She. Nevermind about the dinner. I see it worries you,
mid I 'm not sure it doesn't worry me. Let 's give it up.
He. 1 don't see why
She. No, CHARLES, we '11 give it up. I wanted to
tell you about baby. He was so sweet just now. He
had got his feet entangled in his frock, and nurse was
trying to arrange him, and he turned quite red with
rage and hit her on the head
He (admiringly). The little rascal!
She (continuing). And then he opened his little arms
to her and smiled like an angel, and wouldn't be satis-
fied until she 'd kissed him. I often wonder where that
child gets his sweet disposition from.
He (gallantly). I don't.
She. Well, perhaps it is so. Your mother told me
you had charming ways as a child.
He. But about this dinner. I daresay we 'd bettei
get it over.
She. Just as you like, of course. There 's really no
absolute necessity, but perhaps (She pauses,)
He. What were you going to say?
She. I thought perhaps a little hospitality of thai
sort might be expected of us.
He. I daresay you 're right. Let 's
She. But mind, CHARLES, I don't want the dinner.
In fact, I shall be happier without it, but if you think
we ought to, of course I '11 do my best.
He (cheerfully). All right. You can put it on me.
I '11 carry the burden. What date?
She (with alacrity). Tuesday the 20th.
He. Right. (Enters it in a little red pocket-book.)
Whom shall we ask?
She (diffidently). We. ought to have the LAMPETKRS,
I suppose, and the BowLES-DicKSONS, and the COL-
L1XGWOODS.
He (airily). Why not the DORLEYS?
Slic. The DORLEYS! Of course, if yon want paint
and powder, Mrs. DORLEY 's the one.
He. Oh, come, she 's not as bad as all that" 1
thought she 'd cheer it up a bit, that 's all.
She. Yes, she 's just the sort of woman that twists
all you men round her little finger. You 're all as
blind as a bat, and you 're the battiest of the lot.
He (witli a suspicion of jaunty devilry). Didst think
me blind, when
She. A lucid interval. No, CHARLES, / was the blind
one then. However, have your DORLEYS. Only, il
you do, I '11 have Captain OKKS and his sister.
He (loudly). No, no.
Site (insistently). Yes, yes. Captain OKES has a
bold, free, irresistible way with him, and even if MAR\
OKES has turned forty she 's a pattern of all the girlish
virtues.
He. Let's toss.

She. Ueads!

She (loudly aside). He has a noble heart after all

He. I don't want the DORLEYS now.

He (resignedly). Let 's have the lot.
She. All right. That makes twelve with ourselves
Now come up and see baby.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WILLIAM'S WORD.
I DON'T go in for Anagrams myself,
but WILLIAM did once, and he has
told me all about it, and what very
hard luck he had not to win a prize.
WILLIAM'S word was Anti-bilioua;
and the anagram he made from it
was "Better, Oswald? — Much,
Sadie," or something like that. I
don't say that that was the actual sen-
tence, but it was certainly the idea.
There were a Iqt of Christian names
in it which nobody is ever called,
and a distinct impression that you
were getting too many letters for
your money. Of course the word
may not have been anti-bilious after
all—in fact, I am pretty sure now
that it wasn't—but it was quite that
sort of word and that is as near as
w" can go. Anyhow we may be cer-
tain that the whole thing was
extremely clever of WILLIAM, and
that he had the two hundred pounds
absolutely safe.
Tactics was the name of the paper,
and WILLIAM bought a copy next clay.
When 1>3 had signed his name and
written down his anagram, he made
an unfortunate discovery. The, word
had to be taken from pages '203, 20-1,
203, 206, and 207 of that number.
WILLIAM, rather anxious now, turned
to page 203, and found that it was
the beginning of an exciting story of
Spanish life. With an eagerness
which would have made the author
blush with pride could lie have seen
it, WILLIAM read that story through.
He paid particular attention to the
doings of the heroine, because (as he
said) you never know what a Spanish
lady is going to do next. But though
the Keiiorita was sometimes fierce as
a tiger, sometimes caressing as a
dove, and sometimes one of the ani-
mals in between, she was never once
anti-bilious as anything.
The story went on to page 207, at
the bottom of which, to his extreme
disgust, WILLIAM read the words
"Another of tliis scries next wcclc."
Next week, as he had feared, the same
pages were chosen (the editor was
evidently determined that his stones
should be read somehow), and WIL-
LIAM once again chased the Senorita
through five pages. There was a
moment on the fourth page when she
staggered back, put her hand to her
brow, and wailed in a voice of inde-
scribable emotion, " My head,TERESA,
ah! my poor head." WILLIAM was
longing to jump forward and say,
Excuse me, madam, but have you
tried these anti ," only TERESA
was too quick for him. "Maiiana,
sancho pansa; bucnos ayres," she
said, and led her mistress into the
fresh air.
This went on for a month. At the
end of that time WILLIAM was in a
desperate state. He calculated that
the author had used every word in the
English language except "anti-bili-
ous" (w7hich would be held by any-
decent editor to give it the required
standing for an Anagram), and con-
fessed reluctantly that Spanish life
wan more healthy than people
thought. And he came to the con-
clusion that the only thing to do was
to write the next Tactics story himself.
Author:; will tell you that the
beginning of a story is the most diffi-
cult part; there are, moreover, pro-
verbs in several languages to that
effect. WILLIAM'S trouble was quite
otherwise. He began easily and at
once:
"Anti-bilious," said the Colonel as
he leant bud; in his chair and puffed-
at his cigar. There was silence for a
moment.
That was his opening, for he was
taking no risks; the difficulty was to
go on. WILLIAM was, and indeed is,
a stockbroker; fiction—save for one
slight effort about OSWALD and
SADIE—had never been in his line. A
strenuous week at it now made him
more sure than ever that he was right
to have become a stockbroker.
Now WILLIAM was a man of re-
source—as I gather stockbrokers have
to be. One chance was left to him.
Recalled upon a journalist friend of his.
Hallo," he. said, "I "ve come
on business. An editor man I know
wants a short story from you. Have
you got one'.' I said I 'd see you
about it."
"How much ?" said the journalist.
"' Twenty pounds," said WILLIAM
hurriedly, " and I '11 pay you now."
"Done," said his friend, and got
up to rummage in his desk. "There,
take it away. I 'm sick of it."
It isn't about Spanish life by any
chance?" asked WILLIAM nervously.
"No. Why?"
"Er—well, it 's Fact is, I
don't think the editor 's very keen
about Spanish life. Can't say why.
Just a fancy of his. Hallo, this
looks a bit short—just about five
lines short, I should say. Well, we
can easily stick five lines in some-
where. Here 's your cheque. Many
thanks."
\ViLLiAM went back to his office and
wrote in five lines at the beginning :—
"Anti-bilious," said the Colonel, as
lie leant back in his chair and puffed
at his cigar. Tlicre was silence for a
moment. Then he told me the fol-
lowing story.
He had it typed, and forwarded it
to the editor of Tactics, pointing out
that he (WILLIAM) owned the copy-
right and would take the brass.
I must bring this sad history to a
close as quickly as I can. There
came a day when the Colonel's story
appeared. (There was another day
later on when WILLIAM only received
three guineas for it, but we cannot
bother about that now.) Of course
the Spanish stones had been read
to the end by this time, and ap-
parently that was all the editor cared
about. This week the Anagram word
had to be chosen from the City Notes.
In a way it was a compliment to
WILLIAM'S judgment in selecting
stories; as much as to say that any-
one would read a tale submitted by
him, without the incitement of an
anagram; but he wouldn't see it in
this light. He was quite angry; and
he went out at once to try aixl per-
suade his journalist friend to return
some of the twenty pounds. On the
way he noticed a poster of Imitations
which called attention to the fact
that an Anagram competition was
proceeding within. In the faint hope
that "anti-bilious" might have
strayed into their story too he bought
a cop}'
He was really very angry. It
seems that for the Imitations com-
petition you are not limited to certain
pages. You may select any word in
the language that you like. Of
course, then, any time the last six
weeks ho might have sent up his
anti-bil
As I say, I can quite understand
his being angry. For a word in the
list of winning Anagrams of the week
before caught his eye. It would have
caught his eye anywhere by now: —
Anti-bilious: "Better, Osu-ald?—
Much, Sadie" (or whatever the
wretched thing was).
The word WILLIAM used when he
read this was useless for Anagram
purposes. On the other hand I can-
not help feeling that it would havo
come quite easily into a story of
Spanish life. A. A. M.
A writer on Hockey begins an
article in a contemporary as follows:
"It is a fact, but Nevertheless essentially
true"
We forbear to give the name of the

ROBERT, I envy not
Thy lot!
When chill the night and polar,
And thou art whistled to thy work
To probe my garden's inky murk
Lest haply some slim burglar lurk
Behind the ghost-like roller;
And when thou rustiest in where I
Tremble to tread lest bullets fly,
Then, Robert, as I watch thee go
I marvel? Yes!—I envy? No!
Nor, Robert, would I choose
Thy shoes
When Suffragettes will fight theo,
And thy coercive arm must quell
The lawless wrath of CHRISTABEL
And all those Amazons who swell
The swarms that scratch and bite
thee.
Yet though, when all is said and
done,
Thy lot is not a happy one.
Believe me, thou art blest beyond
Thy luckless peers across the Pond.
If oak and brass be bound
Around
The length of thy equator,
What adamant canst thou suggest
Must gird the hero's dauntless breast
Who may be summoned to arrest
A scaly alligator?
No Suffragette has such a jaw
To scare the guardians of the law,
Nor such a long and moving tale
To make them tremble and turn pale.
It makes my heart grow queer
To hear
The tasks they may be brought to,
If they must seize each fearsome
beast
That hunts, with fury still increased,
Convivial gentlemen who feast
More freely than they ought to.
Ah! if 'tis difficult to snare
An alligator which is there.
How much more hard his hapless lot
Who has to capture one that 's not!

PROBLEMS OF THE ROAD: A STUDY FROM LIFE.
•MOTORISTS MUST LEARN THAT OTHER PEOPLE BESIDE THEMSELVES HAVE A RIOUT TO THE KOAD."—Anlimotoring Press.
STRANGE INNOVATION.
HEAVILY DRESSED ETHICAL DANCER.
YET another intellectual dancer of
world-wide repute is to make her
appearance in London shortly in the
person of Miss VASHTI ST. Virus, a
young American of Semitic origin
and extraordinary command of the
moralising influences of corybantic
undulation.
It should be noted at once that
there is a vast difference between
Miss ST. Virus's method and that
of Miss MAUD CUNARD or Miss
MrsiDuRA BUNCOMBE. As might be
expected from her name, it is at once
more strenuous and more saintly—
more in keeping with the best Bol-
landist traditions. Miss ST. Virus
never wears less than three skirts,
five petticoats, and four pairs of
stockings; and she usually dons
goloshes over her shoes. There is
naturally very little play of the feet
about her dancing, but especial em-
phasis is laid upon facial expression,
frou-frou, and vortical convolution of
the drapery in accordance with the
theory of the late Lord KELVIN. The
main aim of her performance, it can-
not be too insistently asserted, is to
inculcate ascetic Altruism on the
lines of the strictest Pragmatism.
Miss ST. Virus—who, in the
chaste phrase of The Daily Chronicle,
is a most charmingly-lissom, fresh,
lively, practical and thoroughly
American young person — contends
that it was she who first invented
the vermiform arm-wriggle which is
one of Miss MAUD CUNARD'S most
applauded achievements. "I intro-
duced it at Boston," she said, " long
before even Miss MUSIDORA BUN-
COMBE came out. As a matter of
fact, I started my ethical and prag-
matical dancing—in a previous in-
carnation, of course—just about the
time that TAGLIONI first made her
appearance in London." This settles
the question of priority once and
for all.
"There's just one thing," said
Miss ST. Virus in an interview with
the Archbishop of CANTERBURY,
"that I wit'nt to say slick out. My
dances are in no way connected with
the prevalent cult of Apolaustic
Hedonism. They are just the real
expressions of the soul, and a white
soul at that. Other dancers may
appeal to Cabinet Ministers and the
Smart Set, but I aim at doing a stunt
on the great Puritan Heart of the
British public. No dancer since the
world began ever wore so many
clothes as I do. Why, one of my
dances is called 'The Dunce of the
Nineteen Petticoats '!
"Then I 'm a Theosophist as well;
and that of course gives me a far
wider spiritual outlook. At the Con-
gress at Oxford the other day I gave
illustrations to one of the lectures
representing a Hindoo saint prac-
tising emotional exercises in the soli-
tude of the jungle. I tell you Oxford
is still humming with it, and the
Headmaster of Eton has invited me
to cavort on the ethical platform
before the school twice a week for
the rest of the term. To-morrow I
give thorn the Stoical Sand-dance,
and next Tuesday, with ten of my
best pupils, I am going to show
them the Angel Cake-walk and the
Self-denying Tarantella, which typi-
fies the liberation of the soul from a
sordid craving for jam-puffs."

UNCLE TOM (so called by the

straight in the face. "Trus' me,

'Yes, Missee, goin' South."

tears. "We 're jiggered for the Cup

OUR Special Correspondent in the South-Eust wires:—
A daring burglary took place the night before last in
Pickle Alley, off the New Cut, at the residence of Mr.
WILLIAM SIKKS, a well-known inhabitant of that quarter.
Mr. SIKKS occupies the front room on the second floor
of No. 6. His profession keeps him employed until the
early hours of the morning, and, oil his arrival home
about 3.15 a.m. yesterday, he was amazed to find that
his room had been entered and rifled of the most valuable
contents, including a very pretty set of tools which Mr.
SIRES uses in his work. Mr. SIKES, with great presence
of mind, rushed to the window and blew a police whistle,
and a number of members of the force quickly
assembled. But the burglar had got clean away with the
swag. The only clue to his identity was a poekethand-
kerchief, with a monogram surmounted by a coronet.
WE understand that the next number of the Art
Journal will contain a criticism, by the President of the
lloyal Academy, of the pictures in The Tailor and Cutter.
Ox Friday last a pretty incident was witnessed in
Whitehall. As a short, sturdily-built gentleman with a
bowler hat and a grey beard was cautiously picking his
way across the wide thoroughfare, a little golden-headed
child rushed out from the throng of people, and, snatch-
ing him from beneath the front hoofs of a pair of dray
horses, carried him in safety to the pavement. There,
patting his head with a kindly smile, she went on her
way as if nothing had happened. The gentleman was
none, other than Mr. JOHN BCKXS, M.P., President of

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
THE BAZAAR SEASON.
Main waring Holt.
DEAREST DAPHNE,—The Bazaar
season has set in with unusual
severity. Every house I 've stayed
in lately has been suffering from it.
First, there was Clackmannan Castle,
where STELLA CLACKMANNAN made
me help with her big annual bazaar
for Keeping the Crofters Where, They
Are, or something of that
sort. Oh, my dear! such
a stodgy business! I do
believe that everything of
every kind sold at that
bazaar, from warm gowns
and mauds to bonbon-
nitres and powder-boxes,
was made of Scotch plaid.
The Scptch are certainly
the most monotonous
people on the face of the
earth. That 's what 's the
matter with them. And
they 're something else too.
They all wanted their
proper change, if you
please, even when 1 was
selling!
I offered to put n little
life into the affair by get-
ting up some side-shows
and a cafc-chantunt, and
was quite willing to sing
some coon songs or do a
clog-dance, or "anything
to oblige," but STELLA said
they wouldn't understand
or approve of it. She was
quite sure, however, that if
I would give a recitation
from BURNS it would be
very much liked! Fancy,
you know! Why, I only
know one line of BURNS,
"My name 's MAC SOME-
THING. On the Grampian

done so successfully, but

threw in a laugh and "That was

opened it. It was in aid of one of

trying to ^ get over the

had an offer from the Syn-

come out at the Magnifi-

ran up to town for her first
appearance. The place
was crammed—and all to

little white baby frock and big white
baby bonnet, and sang, "Would oo

really stid, for she was beginning to
make a bit of a name socially.

she went on making plans about

go into Parliament and make a great

I told her. "By the time that small

HATINfiE MACHINERY.
ON the prickly subject of the
matinee hat Sir CHARLES WYNDHAM
has said to an evening paper, " I ex-
pect an automatic solution." He
need not be disappointed; he has
only to come to terms with our pet
inventor, and his theatre can be
fitted to-morrow with either of the
following patents: —
1. The Automatic Seat-Kaiser. The
invention is attached to each stall.
A shilling in the slot will shoot the
stall high above all obstructions—too
high to interfere with the view from
the pit, not high enough to bother
the dress-circle. A second fitting
will be supplied to meet any cussed-
ness on the part of an obstructionist.
I If a lady who is no lady insists on
following the obstructed up towards
the ceiling by placing a shilling in the
slot of her stall, the obstructed can,
by inserting yet another shilling in a
j secret slot at the back of her stall,
j send her down to earth again, where
she must remain, for the stall could
not again be raised until an expert
had "set " it for the next perform-
ance.
2. The Automatic Seat-Sinker. A
second invention, again on the shil-
ling-in-the-slot principle, is one by
which the stall of an obstructionist
can be suddenly dropped through a
trap-door well below the floor of the
theatre. The opening will be largo
enough to let any wearer through:
the hat will remain above the floor,
however, for the obstructed to put
his feet on.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By ,Vr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MK. ANTHONY HOPE'S new book, The Great Miss
Driver (METHCEN), shows the sound, solid craftsman-
ship which one has long learned to associate with his
best work. But I have one or two grounds of quarrel
with him. He builds up for us, with very conscientious
pains, the character of a young girl, suddenly called to
the absolute ownership of a large estate, who lias a cool
head for business, and can make a very clear map of
her projected progress as a social figure in the county;
who is described as acting at times on what appears to
be sudden impulse but is really the considered result of
an elaborate plan of attack in
which she has kept open a way of
escape; and then, when the great
crisis comes which is to test her
character, she behaves like the most
foolish and flighty and irresponsible
of women. Again we are never
allowed to recognise for ourselves
the attractions of the man whose
mistress she becomes. That he
must have had a compelling
chann wo father from the almost
hypnotic influence he exerted over
her. But the author permits us
to see very little of his nature,
except the brutal, overbearing
side of it; and this makes her
escapade the more inexplicable.
For the rest, the story is told
with great distinction, though
the interest suffers from a severe
hiatus in the middle durin the
long retirement, of tlic pro-
tagonist into obscurity; and the
fresh start which she makes on
her return is not without a sus-
picion of anticlimax.
Mr. HOPE'S style is here, as
ulways, marked by a nice gift
for analytic reasoning, as clear as
it is subtle; but this virtue has
its own defect, which shows in a
tendency to arrest the rhythm of
a period for the sake of a paren-
thetic phrase introduced to modify
the argument. The title of the

If you were to mention the name of CHESTERTON to an
ordinary person he would reply, "Oh, you mean that
paradox fellow. I can't stand a man who spends all his
time trying to prove that black is white." You would
know from this that he had never read a line of Mr.
CHESTERTON'S; you would explain gently that Mr.
CHESTERTON had never said black was white, only that
one man's black was often another man's white—a very
different thing; and you would start him on some
of the lighter essays of G. K. C. In a little while
he would begin to like the author,
and he would want to read more.
He would read more, and then he
would discover Mr. CHESTERTON'S
weaknesses — as, for example,
that he could never resist the
elementary verbal joke ; moreover,
he would be annoyed with a man
who seemed so ready with his
opinion on every topic under, or
even above, the sun. He would
probably hate Mr. CHESTERTON.

an interplay apparently is a kind
of drama that doesn't need any

the piece is an uncommonly good
one, and the characters are interesting and likable
enough to compensate for the lack of stirring adventure.
There is a lady steeped in sham culture; another who is
entirely genuine; a doctor who gives up half his practice
because the patients are not really ill; a half-witted
maker of violins; and a sea-captain who calls his fiancee
shipmate," and has only missed finding the North
Pole, I gather, because the signposts in Arctic circles are
so disgracefully misleading. What more can one want?
And nil these people react on each other in a pleasant
good-natured way, and manage to point the moral that
one must live one's life heartily and avoid shams. The
only fault I have to find is the author's habit of
giving gratuitous advertisements to things that don't
really need them; for instance, the Hampstead Tube,
taximeter cabs, and St. James's Park. I think one
ought to be allowed to take, one's chance of finding these
fascinating places and objects without undue influence.

returned.

found you there safe and sound I was too agitated to
guess the other half, and I just asked you so as to make
sure. See? And there 's one more thing I 'm going
to say—CHARLES, I will say it; you can't stop me—and
it 's this: it isn't at all nice of you to lay really clever

WILLIAM'S WIFE.
My friend WILLIAM has just been in to
see me. It seems that he has had a very
bad day in the City owing to tea being
extremely depressed. I think it was
tea. WILLIAM expected it to remain firm
with a slight upward tendency, and
consequently became a bull about tea.
Or is it a bear? Anyhow a silly ass,
apparently.
"But I thought you didn't like tea,"
I said, when he had explained it all.
"Why did you get such a lot?"
"Look here," said WILLIAM, "if you
say the word 'tea' to me again, I'll"
"But I want to help. I don't mind
taking one pound, if Oh, all right.
I 'm sorry. Is that the evening paper?
May I look at it?"
WILLIAM handed me the confounded
thing, and got up to go.
"There 's nothing in the Stop-Press
news about—er—coffee," I said. "Oh,
I say, this is rather interesting. WILLIAM,
how did you first meet your wife? Oh,
but I forgot, you aren't married. Well,
how would you—•—"
He slammed the door and went out.
And now I am left with The Evening
News in my hand to wonder about
WILLIAM'S wife.
It is like this. The Evening ~Scws is
inviting everybody to write up and say
how he met his wife (or if a woman,
husband); and there is a prize of five
guineas for the best letter. I have been
reading some of the letters, and envying
the dears who wrote them. The romance
of that first encounter! I wonder if I—
I mean WILLIAM
This was how JAMES SPARROW first
met his wife:
lie was cycling along a country lane
in Herefordshire when he overtook a
lady who had just had a puncture. He
dismounted, raised his hat, and asked if
he might be of any assistance. lu a
little while they were both leaning over
a little stream which rippled by the
wayside, looking for bubbles in the
inner tube; and when JAMES saw her
pretty arms (bare to the elbow) gleaming
through the water, he swore that
As JAMES points out, the fact that
they both had the same make of machine
was another bond between them. I do
hope he gets the five guineas.
This was how MICHAEL PCPP first met
his wife:
Every evening he got in at Cannon
iStreet and got out at Wimbledon; and
every evening she got in at Sloane
Square and got out at Putney. MICHAEL
used to take the seat nearest the door,
and at Sloane Square he would jump
up and say, " Won't yon sit down here?
1 VI much rather stand." After a month
they used to smile when he said this (I
love her for her backwardness—twenty-
four times!); and after two months he told
her that the carriages on that line were
rather crowded in the evening. One night
a woman with a. baby got in at Sloane
Square too, and MICHAEL gave his seat
up to her instead. JESSIE was so touched
by this that she went down to Wimble-
don by mistake, and was introduced to
his mother at the station. . . .
They were married a year later. The
dears—I hope they get the five guineas.
This is how HORATIO AXXESLEY met
his first wife:
He went to a garden-party, and his
hostess said, "May I introduce vou to
Miss MUMM?"
I don't think much of that.
I wonder how I—that is to say, I
wonder how WILLIAM will meet his wife.
Romantically, I hope. He mustn't spend
all his time with the groceries; let us
give him one breathless encounter, at
any rate. I have meditated several
openings for him.
"Dear Sir,—I was walking along
Brighton Pier after a heavy tea one day,
during the recent gale, when I heard a
sudden shriek. Hastening to the side I
observed the most beautiful girl I had
ever seen struggling in the water. With-
out a moment's hesitation I threw off my
coat and dived to the rescue. . ."
That's all right, you know, because
stockbrokers are always walking to
Brighton.
Or this:
"Sir,—A year ago I had one night a
curious vision. Two or three cups of
strong tea had kept me awake for some
hours, but at last I dropped off to sleep,
and immediately began to dream. In
my dream I saw a cathedral beautifully
decorated. It was full of people, but
one man, who stood up in the front and
kept moving restlessly about, attracted
my attention particularly. Suddenly he
turned round, and to my astonishment I
recognised myself. Just then the organ
pealed out, and I noticed a procession
coming up the aisle. Following the
choir and clergy came one whom I
can only descril)e as the most beautiful
girl I had ever seen. Six months
later. ..."
I am sure that would get a prize.
Why I want WILLIAM to go in for this
competition (even though he is not
married) is because he has had such a
rotten time lately in the tea depart-
ment, and I think the five guineas would
help him. I don't know how many tons
of tea he has got on his hands, but
you could get several stone for five
guineas, and that would be something
towards it.
But if WILLIAM does go in for it (and
I expect he will, now that he has given
up anagrams) he will do it in his own
way. I can see his letter as plainly as I
can, see anything :—
"To the Editor of 'The Evening News.'
Dear Sir,—I first met my wife in
church. Of course I had met her
several times before that, but she wasn't
my wife then."
Or even this:
"Dear Sir,—I was introduced to my
wife by a man who was a great friend of
mine. Who teas a great friend of mine.
P.S.—Send the five guineas to my office
address."
And I am bound to admit that that
sort of thing will probably get the prize.
Well, I don't think I shall go in for
it myself. Of course I couldn't, truth-
fully. But all the same, I have been
wondering to-day how . . .
I haven't got a bicycle, you know .. .
and I never go down to Wimbledon.
Of course it might be quite unro-
mantic, just like HORATIO; only . . .
By the way, I forgot to mention that the
writer of every printed letter is presented
with a pound of tea. I am afraid that
will annoy WILLIAM rather. A. A. M.
COUNTRY HOUSE HINTS.
BY LADY WEE KENDER
(Contributor to The World and his Wife).
I AM sure that all you dear folk
who read The World and hi* Wife
will like to know how we smart
people behave in country houses. It
is not likely that you will ever be
asked yourselves; but there is no
reading so alluring as that about the
habits of persons of a higher social
grade than one's own. Listen, then.
For one thing you must be a good
shot. Most of us can now bring
down our partridges and pheasants
every time. The men do not like it if
we miss, and, as you perhaps know,
everything is now done to please
the men. A woman who is not a
dead shot had better stay at home;
she will get no mercy from the men.
But a woman who is a dead shot
does not ask mercy. She takes her
lot with the rest just as it comes.
The smartest women all shoot well.
You must take three times as
many frocks as the number of days
for which you stay. Thus if you are
there a week, you will want twenty-
one in all, since the men do not like
the women to wear the same thing
again. You will want seven shoot-
ing costumes, or, if you don't shoot,
seven tailor - mades for shooting-
lunches, seven tea-gowns, and seven
evening gowns. Throw in a few
more in case of anything special.
It has become the custom with
many hosts and hostesses to invite

their own," and not in each other's
company; indeed, an up-to-date
couple often play the part of Box
and Cox as regards their country-
house visits. Then, if a married
man is both a good shot and a
"good fellow," he is safe to be
passed on from house to house
through the entire season. And his
wife, if pretty and popular, will get
her own share of amusing invita-
tions. Girls, with one or two excep-
tions, are at a discount in smart
country houses. They are not rich
enough for Bridge, and they put a
restriction on funny stories. The
best guests are the most seasoned
ones.
As to tips. The rule is a fiver to
the head-keeper if you stay a week.
For a good day over partridges, a
sovereign; for a good day with
pheasants, £2. If you don't shoot
it is not necessary to tip the keeper;
but an open hand is no loser in
one's friends' houses. Bemember
you are rarely there out of friend-
ship, but because you have certain
desirable qualities. Butlers expect
gold or paper. Never ask a menial
for change. It is unusual to send for
the cook: the best way is to leave a
sovereign at the bottom of the soup-
plate. You may tip your host if you
are very flush. It is not expected,
but will not be resented.

JOSEPH CARTER.
I HAD come to years of discretion
before I ever heard of JOSEPH CARTER.
In fact I can imagine that I—like
many others—might have placidly
passed the whole of my days in ignor-
ance of his very existence had not
chance willed it otherwise. It was in a
moment of heat that I first had cause
to know and bless his name. 1 had
—incautiously, I will admit—stepped
into the bath without first trying its
temperature. I raised a parboiled
foot with an agonized groan, turned
on the cold water and breathed a
sigh of relief. I looked gratefully at
the tap that had come so quickly to
my aid and read the simple inscrip-
tion :—
"Joseph Carter, Plumber."
What modesty is expressed in
those few words! Not
"Joseph Carter,
20—200, High Street, Kensington,
Plumber."
Not
"Joseph Carter,
England's Greatest Plumber."
No motto such as
"If you are wise you will go to
Joseph Carter."
Not even
"Families waited on daily."
Simply and solely
"Joseph Carter, Plumber."
During the day my thoughts ran
much on JOSEPH. I pictured him a
plain, blunt man, probably one who
had raised himself from the rank of
a plumber's assistant. 1 thought of
him in his family circle on the great
day, for instance, when he first rose
to the height of having his name
engraven on the little porcelain discs
that were to adorn so many taps, and
stamp them as the work of his hand.
I pictured his wife's pardonable
pride; how she might beg a dozen or
BO to use as buttons on her neat
though homely gowns; how the chil-
dren might play at shops with them
and the baby chew them when cut-
ting his teeth.
On entering the bathroom next
morning my thoughts reverted to
JOSEPH, and I hastened to read the
inscription again. My eyes hap-
pened to light first on the hot-water
tap—one of a more recent date than
the cold—and I read the words: —
"Joseph Carter's Improved."
I gazed spellbound. For a
moment, for the fraction of a
moment, I felt bitterly disappointed
in JOSEPH. Then my anger rose.
In all probability he had improved,
but why mention it himself in that
blatant manner? Who would wish
to begin his day thinking of the prob-
able improvement in JOSEPH CARTER?
What a propensity the fellow had for
monopolising one's thoughts with his
insufferable conceit. Imagine the
bitter amazement of a young wife
who, on asking her husband at break-
fast, " Is your omelette nice, dear?"
might receive the darkly mysterious
answer,
"Joseph Carter has improved."
Yet, after all, he may still be a
modest man as of yore. Perhaps it
is all the fault of Mrs. JOSEPH
CARTER. May she not, as prosperity
came to him, liave urged him to
alter his simple legend, and may
not the model husband (a man
with a name like that could not
be other than a model husband) have
answered as follows ?—
"My love, far be it from me to
indulge in any ostentations display,
but since you wish it I will in future
gratefully acknowledge on my work
that
Joseph Carter has improved."
CLOTHES.
ARTICLE I.
GOOD clothes are bought, and not
made at home. Some men are
soldiers, some men are sailors, and
others, again, are tinkers. Fortu-
nately there are enough men in the
world to fill these three great pro-
fessions and leave a few over. These
few—these glorious few—are tailors.
Suppose there were no tailors.
Soldiers and sailors could do nothing
lor us, and we should be left in the
hands of the tinkers. 0 my mas-
ters, think of the discomfort of it!
Think of the rattle! Conceive your-
selves buttoning up a frayed suit of
tin on a cold morning, and cease to
grumble maliciously of tailors, their
bills, duns -and overcharges.
Good fellows though they be, I
have never yet met a tailor who
could supply me with a linen collar.
Collars, Sirs, are still worn, some to
such an extent that they irritate and
inflame the neck wherever they touch
it. Get your tweed suit from the
tailor by all means, and wear your
brother's cap if you wish it, but for
your collars and ties you must turn
to the haberdasher. What a glorious,
title—Haberdasher! Is it possible,
that the expression " to cut a dash"
is merely a shortened form of "to
cut a haberdash"? Perhaps, per-
haps not.
ARTICLE II.
So we come to ties. Let your tie
be black. To the good you shall
seem good; to the bad, bad; to the
artistic, artistic; to the fashionable,
ultra. Besides, your black tie is the
only tie that your sister will not
steal. What good is there in this
sister of yours? What shall we say
of her? She steals your ties, she
does abominable things with your
razor, none of her raiment is worth
confiscating, and the tie that she
knits she knits for another. Young
man, cease imagining that you shall
get the better of this sister, but take
it rather out of that Other. Smoke
his cigarettes and ride his bicycle;
and if he knows his business and
means it he will not say a word.
If he shows fight, play the Christian
and befriend him. Be incessantly
intimate with him; put your arm
through his and keep it there with
inseparable affection. After a day
and an evening (especially an even-
ing) of this treatment he will be
yours to command, so that you leave
him a little. Even your sister may
become towards you very nearly
polite.
ARTICLE III.
Let us put away frivolity and turn
our thoughts to boots and shoes.
Shoes are boots with the tops cut
off. Boots are boots with the tops
left on. Enough, then, of boots and
shoes.
ARTICLE IV.
Of socks I say nothing. The part
which appears above the shoe is ob-
vious in all its merits and demerits
to the public eye. Of that which is
inside the shoe there is little to be
seen, and that little is of a foreign
substance and hue, uncomfortable
to the foot and short-lived. Strange
men have told me that there exist
socks with whole and holeless heels;
but I have never seen such and do
not believe.
ARTICLE V.
Thus lastly we come to the stud.
Though I do not know you and
could never love you if I did, you
have my sympathy in this. I have
composed a curse horrific in style and
four hundred words in length, but
not fit to be printed here. This I
will present to you gratis for the
common hate all men bear to this
loathsome creature. There is more
virtue in two inches of string than in
10,000 studs, and I ever regret that
fashion will not recognise this advan-
tage.
CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.

the end of this exhaustive nnd ex-
hausting treatise. There are items
of a man's clothing with which I

Time presses, and there are others
waiting to expose themselves in these
pages. I can only say generally on
these and kindred points omitted to
be considered here:—Be regular,
punctual, speaking no scandal, no,
nor listening to it. Let loyalty and
self-abnegation be your guiding prin-
ciples, and your Mother Country
shall foster you with ever-increasing
pride and taxation.
The "Protectograph" is adver-
tised as "an absolute safeguard
against cheque frauds." The Bank
of British West Africa writes:—
"We have thought so highly of the value of
your I'rotectograph that we have got one for
each of our branches and agencies, which we
think is quite sufficient to say what we think
about them."
As an opinion on its branches and
agencies this is certainly enough.
We understand that a special
supplement for veteran paupers will
shortly be published by M.A.P. It
will be Mainly About Pensions.
THE LANGUAGE OF
DIPLOMACY.
THK diplomatist waved his Turkish
cigarette with a gesture of expostu-
lation. "You use too crude a word!
'Expropriation,' my dear sir, ' expro-
priation ' is the term I should myself
apply to the—er—arrangement we
have concluded regarding the pro-
vince of Balkania."
The interviewer made a careful
note of it. "And if the Balkanians
themselves object to their native land
being expropriated'.' Did not the
Treaty of 1878 guarantee them their
independence'.'''
"My dear sir," was the suave
reply, " I think you are hardly using
the correct diplomatic term in speak-
ing of a ' treaty.' 'Semi-provisional
arrangement' would perhaps express
it less abruptly."
"It is stated that the Balkanians
are calling out their reserves and
hurrying them to the frontier. What
do'you intend to do—fight them?"
The diplomatist shrugged his
shoulders deprecatingly. "Oh, no,
we should not 'fight them.' Possi-
bly it will be necessary to bring
diplomatic pressure to bear on the
frontier, and of course, if they were
inclined to resist a peaceful settle-
ment of the question, we should
hardly be prepared to view the
matter with indifference, but 'fight
them,' my dear sir, no! We should
merely press for a peaceful recogni-
tion of our rights."
"And after Balkania, what will be
the next 'expropriation '?"
"Who can foresee'.1 These things
lie on the knees of the gods. Re-
adjustments of territory are always
liable to deflect the balance of power
in any given region . . . ."
"WAR DECLARED!" shouted
a newsboy in the street below.
"Tut, tut! " said the diplomatist.
'' How coarsely expressed!''
Advice by The Lady to another
(" Goo-goo ") who is just going out
to India to be married:
"Certainly kiss your fiance when he meets
you on arrival. 1 think yon would be very
hard-hearted if you did not."
What an agonising voyage it would
have been for the poor girl with this
knotty point unsettled.

EDITORIAL CHANGES.
CONVINCING GUARANTEES.
THE proprietors of The New Age
have issued a statement to the effect i
that they have much pleasure in |
announcing that in future the editor-'
ship of that journal will be in the
joint hands of Mr. A. R. ORAGK and
Mr. VICTOR QRAYSUN, M.P. "The
association of Mr. GRAYSON with the
political editorship of The Ncir
Age," so the official communique
continues, "is an additional guar-
antee that the paper will continue
to be conducted on the same fearless
and independent lines as have made
its name respected by all classes of
the community."
We are delighted to be able
to supplement this gratifying and
convincing statement with the an-
nouncement of a number of changes
impending in the control of other
journals.
Thus, it is semiofficially stated
that henceforth the editorship of
The Spectator will be in the joint
hands of Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON and
Mr. LEO MAXSE. The association of
Mr. LEO MAXSE in the political
editorship of The Spectator is au
absolute guarantee that the paper
will continue to be conducted with
the same sobriety of utterance, affec-
tion for animals, and loyalty to the
principles of Cobdenism which have
commended this journal to the think-
ing classes of the community.
It gives us intense pleasure to be
able to announce that on and after
November 1st the editorship of The
National Review will be in the cap-
able hands of Mr. CHIOZZA MONEY
and Mr. J. M. ROBERTSON, M.P. The
co-operation of Mr. ROBERTSON,
M.P., is an additional guarantee,
if any were required, that the review
will in the future be conducted with
the same burning zeal for Imperial
interests and the maintenance, in
our naval defences, of the four-Power
standard which characterised it under
its previous editor.
We have good reason to believe
that on New Year's Day Sir ERNEST
CASSEL will assume the post of
editor of The Star. Sir ERNEST'S
assumption of the reins of office in
Stonecutter Street is equivalent to
saying that the paper will continue
to expose the horrible iniquities of
plutocracy with the same fearless
candour which has won for it the
affection of the unemployed in the
past.
Great satisfaction has been caused
in the City by the welcome an-
nouncement that The Economist will
pass, on the 1st of April, under the
complete editorial control of Lord
ROSSLYN. The name of this incom-
parable nobleman makes it as clear
as mud that from that date the
paper will lend the same sagacious
support to sound finance as marked
the editorship of the late Mr.
WALTER BAGEHOT.
Sir A. K. ROLLIT, as reported in
The Birmingham Express:—
"It was said of Rome that Augustus found
a brick and left it an empire."
Or " threw it at an umpire"? That
would make more sense, but any-
how we are afraid Sir ALBERT has
got the story wrong.
"The new hotel on Mount Vesuvius is now
open. Kirst-olass health resort for nervous
complaints. Steam heating."
We can well believe about the steam
heating.

BURIED GENIUS.
THE UNEARTHING OF PRODIGIES.
A WRITER in The Philadelphia In-
quirer has recently dwelt on the
remarkable number of dramatic dis-
coveries of musical genius which have
lent a peculiar lustre to the last
decade. This is a democratic age,
and the maxim Za carricre ouverte
aux talents has never been more
signally illustrated than in the rapid
leaps from obscurity to fame made by
barbers, maids-of-all-work, bakers'
assistants and tram-conductors. We
have only one fault to find with our
esteemed contemporary. It has not
nearly exhausted the subject, and we
propose to add to its list a few more
well-authenticated instances of the
romance of musical lion-hunting.
Among the singers who are ex-
pected shortly to stagger humanity
with their vocal gifts a foremost place
must be assigned to Mr. ROLAND
SLAGG, the Chowbent sausage-skin
manufacturer, and the owner of an
organ such as is the dower of very
few men in hundreds of centuries.
Yet only ten short weeks ago Mr.
SLAGG was innocent of his Pactolian
prospects. It chanced, however, one
day that Lady DELICIA BURBLE
attended a small concert in Chowbent
at which Mr. SLAGG was billed to
sing and did sing. The gorgeous
opulence of his very first phrase pet-
rified Lady DELICIA with wonder and
delight. In her own racy phrase—
for Lady DELICIA hails from Pitts-
burg—" I was simply plum tuckered
out." With her to hear was to act,
and promptly indemnifying his em-
ployers she swept him off next day
in her motor car to London, when the
verdict of Signer MEZZAGOTIA more
than confirmed her favourable diag-
nosis. As the famous expert tersely
expressed it, "His voice is one in a
million, and there is a million in
his voice." Mr. SLAGG, or Signer
POLOKIO, as he prefers to be called
with a graceful reference to his
original calling, has now commenced
a course of training which will one
day enthrone him high amid the
kings of song.
Two years ago three Mexican mil-
lionairesses were passing a green-
grocer's shop in Criccieth, when their
steps were arrested by a voice
of extraordinary fruitiiiess. They
entered the shop, and interviewed the
unconscious nightingale, in whom
they discovered a budding ALBANI.
Thanks to the munificence of her dis-
coverers she was despatched to Milan
to study for the operatic stage, and
has already made such astounding

progress that it is dangerous to
mention her name—Miss GWALIA
IDRIS — in the presence of Mme.
TETRAZZINI.
Not less miraculous are the stories
credibly narrated of several of the
violin and piano prodigies who have
recently swum into our ken.
. Less than ten years ago Mr. BORIS
BAMBERGER was a wine merchant at
Tiflis", with an income of not more
than £7,000 or £8,000 a year.
Captured by Georgian bandits, and
carried off to their lair on the lower
slopes of Mount Ararat, he was held
to ransom for six months, during
which time he was forced night and
day to make music for his gaolers on
a captive grand piano. Before that
time he did not know a note of
music. But the latent talent
brought to light during his in-
carceration developed with such
astonishing rapidity that on his
release he at once resigned com-
merce for art, and now earns an in-
come of £25,000 a year.
"A ln-initiful Indian summer day has this
been— a strong sun, a cool breeze, a blue sky,
and black-coated ministers warm under wide-
awakes and with heavy clothing, wishing they
had not fancied when they came north that
Yorkshire dales must be cold and rainy."—
British Weekly.
Many thanks. We had always
admired an Indian summer day, but
never knew that it meant all this.
"Required, respectable, steady man for
private milk walk with pony, look after toy
dogs, pump, and fill up time in garden. Church

Of course it would never do for the
pony to take his private milk walk
with a Nonconformist, but a certain
latitude might be allowed to the man
when he was merely filling up time
in the garden.

IN ITS 5oTn THOUSAND.
FEW things arc more interesting
than the genesis of successful books.
It is not so much the writing of the
hook as the thinking of the idea that
is the difficulty. A good idea is
everything. Take my popular work
on packing and mnemonics, for ex-
ample (now in its fifty-fifth thou-
sand). Anyone could have written
it; but who had thought of it all
these years since packing first
liegan—since, in fact, NOAH prepared
for his voyage in the Ark? It was
left, for me.
The whole thing (it brings me in
a steady £200 a year) grew from a
mislaid strop.
Three or four times I had found
myself in strange houses or hotels
without my strop. I therefore in-
vented n private system, proof
against even Sir HIRAM MAXIM, for
preventing any such misfortune in
the future.
Like this. First I sat down and
wrote on a piece of paper the names
of everything that one can want on
a week-end visit anywhere, particu-
larly strops. I did it alphabetically.
Then I showed it to various people,
who made suggestions. Then I
looked through all my wardrobe and
the chest-of-drawers and shelves and
cupboards to see if anything was
omitted.
It began like this: —
Boots.
Brushes (Hnir).
do (Clothes).
do (Hat).
Is the Strop in?
Coats.
fold C'ream.
Collars,
llon't forget the Strop.
Then I procured a large sheet of
cardboard and printed the list legibly
on it and hung it up in my room.
Afler each item was a row of
squares, in one of which I put a tick
as the article was placed in the bag.
In this way, after several hours' ex-
haustive work, I got my strop in,
so to speak, for evermore.
There I left the matter so far as I
was concerned; but a friend of mine
who earns a precarious living by
reading MSS. for publishers and re
commending projects to them, saw
my list and was in an ecstasy.
"My dear old fellow," he said,
"there '& a gold mine in that. Make
a book of it. Give it a crisp title,
such as Have I Left Anything Out!
and there you are."
"But it 's too small," I said.
'There 's not enough to make more
than a few pages."
"Then pad," he said. "Every-
one does that. Specialise. Not only
give a list for yourself for week-ends,
but give a list for all kinds of other
travellers. An Arctic explorer, for
example. Give a list for him. A
big-game hunter; a candidate paying
his first visit to his new constitu-
ency; a competitor in a Marathon
race; a bishop on a visitation; a
society actress who is to stay in a
country house for three days—(but
that will want a separate volume);
a fiance's first dine - and - sleep at
his lady's parental home. Cover the
whole ground."
I did so; and now no wise person
stirs from the house without first
consulting the pages of Have I Left
Anything Out?

MOST HONORED SIR,— Understanding
there are several hands wanted in your
Honor's Department, I beg to offer my
hand as to adjustment. I appeared for
the mntriculation examination, but,
failed, the reason for which I shall
describe to begin with. My writing
was illegible: this was due to climatic
reason, J'or having come from a warm to
a cold climate found my fingers stiff, and
very disobedient to my wishes. Further,
I had received1 great shock to my mental
system in the shape of death of my only
fond brother; besides, most Honored
Sir, I beg to state that I am in very un-
comfortable circumstances, being the
soul support of my fond brother's seven
issues, consisting of three adults, and
four adultresses, the latter being bain of
my existance, owing to my having to
support my own two wives, as well as
their issues, of which by God's mis-
fortune the feminine gender pre-
dominates.
If these humble lines meet with your
benign kindness and favorable turn of
mind, I, the poor menial, shall pray for
the long life and prosperity of yourself,
as well as your Honour's posthumous
olive brunches.

DOMESTIC QUERIES.
Can I keep stout in a Itot pantry?
•—LORN A.
This ought to be easy enough as
long as there is plenty of food in the
pantry. The loss of flesh due to the
excessive heat will be trifling, especi-
ally if all forms of violent exercise
are eschewed.
How can 1 make a cheap wooden
cycle stand ?—HANDYMAN.
In these days of steel this question
reads rather curiously! However,
"Handyman " will find that even a
cheap wooden bicycle will stand all
by itself if he leans it carefully up
against a wall.
How can I tell a bad egg ?—
WIFIE.
Poor little "Wifie"! This is a
lion-id tiling to have to do and you
have my sincere sympathy. If you
really feel you must tell it, do not
be abrupt; break it gently.
Is there' anything I can use instead
of white of egg when preparing fish
for frying ?—BROWN MOUSE.
I 'in afraid I have no room in this
column to print all the things you
could use as an alternative. Would
you care to try turps, black-currant
jelly, brown-boot polish, oil of cloves,
or camphorated chalk? It is, you
see, all a question of taste.
Hoir can I inal;c a trifle ?—WOR-
RIED.
I believe there is still an opening
for clever needlewomen, but I must
warn "Worried" against advertise-
ments like "Home Employment
(Either Sex), 2s. 3d. Weekly Guar-
anteed." Addressing envelopes at

BEL-AMI.
I DON'T think I quite like an "Extra-
vaganza" to end with, a suicide. Death
is never a really good joke; and if you
take it seriously (as you might be inclined
to take your own), it is apt to jar witli the
general gaiety of things. In Bellamy
the Magnificent, however, you cannot
take it seriously, if .you try, because
it is obviously thrown in just for
joy, without any other sort'Of warrant
for it.
Here are the facts. Lord Bellamy,
ancient squire of dames, has an intrigue
with a milliner. He is not aware that
she happens to be the wife of his valet,
who is worth more to him than any
dozen women. The valet discovers the
facts, and in revenge he deals his master
the deadliest blow he can think of: he
gives him a month's notice. Anxious
to get him to reconsider this frightful
threat, Lord Bellamy allows a private
detective to insert (so I gathered) some
of her ladyship's jewels in the valet's
bag and charge him with the theft of
them. In retaliation the valet cooks a
pack of cards, inserts the king of clubs
up his master's sleeve while he is being
dressed, and by aid of an anonymous
letter gets him openly convicted of
cheating before a houseful of guests in
his own country place.
To Bellamy's request that confession
should be made of the trick played on
him, the valet gives a smiling refusal.
Nothing would have been easier than to
arrange for the private de'ective (a
guest in the house) to overhear this
conversation, or anyhow invent a con-
fession. But Bellamy prefers not to
disappoint the house-party, who are
waiting behind their bedroom doors for
a tragic solution; and so he goes and
shoots himself "off." What annoyed
me most was his final request to the
servant to announce that his master had
died like a gentleman. Of course he
really didn't die, any more than he had
lived, like a gentleman. "If you waive
his numerous infidelities, there still
remains the ugly fact of his connivance
in the false charge of theft against his
valet. This was not exactly the conduct
of a gentleman. And his suicide, by
which he wantonlyand deliberately leaves
his family under a permanent stigma,
was frankly the act of a cad.
I do dislike being told of a character
on the stage, on his own authority or
that of his fellow-characters, that he is
something which my naked eye assures
me he is not. Thus, again. Mr. Rjwttit,
the private detective, was described by a
grown-up member of the aristocracy as
being "ripping good form," and had
his charms held up to constant admira-
tion; yet his manners were transparently
those of a bounder.
Sir CHARLES WYNDHIM, though he
might have made a more perfect beau
of himself, was otherwise admirably
suited with his part. Mr. ROIIERT
LOIJAINE, in the part of the valet, was asked
to do some difficult melodramatic feats
in an atmosphere charged with cynical
humour, and it is small blame to him
if they made him (and the audience)
feel a little uncomfortable. In his
smoother passages he maintained a
really excellent demeanour. Miss FOR-
TESCUE, as Lady Bellamy, showed a
pleasantly restrained sense of fun; and
Miss KATE CITI.KR was delightful as the

Bellamy (8ir Charles Wyndham), thus perfect-
ing the contrast between his lordship's physical
immaculacy and moral depravity.
erring milliner. Finally Miss SARAH
BHOOKE, as Mrs. Challoner, another of
Bellamy's flames, spoke her words and
•wore her dresses in a very workmanlike
way.
The author's humour, if it did
not always contrive to spread itself over
the scenes that were laid out for it, has
a charm lieyond the common. It did
not so much scintillate in detached
epigrams; rather'it diffused itself natu-
rally over the dialogue. There was one
very attractive touch that totally escaped
notice. "Women,** said Mrs. Challoner,
who had just made herself ridiculous
through lending a hand in someone else's
plot, "women should never look
beyond their own noses."
"A. charming limitation," replied
Bellamy.
I welcome Mr. ROT HORXIMAM'S acces-
sion to the select body of playwrights
who have something fresh to say. Per-
haps in this play lie tries to do too
many things at once, and I have already
hinted that the tragic conclusion is on a
false note. True, it may be traceable to
an heroic endeavour to avoid convention;
but I think that, if he had had the
perfect courage of his cynicism, he would
liave chosen a happy ending.
By the way, if Mr. HOKSIMAN will look
out the word "lurid" in the dictionary
lie will find that it means " ghastly pale,
wan, gloomy," and will see that a
scarlet geranium is therefore not the
most appropriate emblem of a "lurid"
past. O. 8.
The Last Heir, presented by Mr.
MARTIN HARVEY at the Adelphi, is
an adaptation by Mr. STEPHEN
PHILLIPS of The Bride of Lammer-
moor. I have not seen any other
acting version of SCOTT'S novel, but
Mr. PHILLIPS seems to me to have
dramatised his book in the only
possible way; which is to say that
he has done it well. He has, how-
ever, put three ideas of his own into
it, and for these he may be criticised.
First, when »S'i'r William Ashton and
Lucy are storm-bound and spend
the night at Wolf's Crag, Caleb
Baldcrstonc (who evidently had
never read The Bride of Lannner-
moor) incites the Master to murder
them. Secondly, three witches come
in on every possible and impossible
occasion, and utter dark prophecies
of what is going to happen in the
next Act. Thirdly, Captain Craigcn-
gelt is given a fat low-comedy part,
which rightly belonged to Caleb.
Now, I do not hold Lanimrrmoor
so sacred that I should object to
any sub-editing which Mr. PHILLIPS
thought necessary; and I admit
gladly that Craigcngclt's promotion
was sound stagecraft. But Ravens-
wood's meditated treachery was an
incredible business, and the forced
appearances of the three witches
were certainly not justified by Mr.
PHILLIPS'S evident desire to impress
us with the inevitability of Fate.
Mr. MARTIN HARVEY isn't quite
my idea of the Master, for I could
conceive a more spirited figure,
but ho played finely nevertheless.
Some of his mannerisms surprised
me at first; there is one which would
have suited better a play entitled
The Last Hair. Miss DE SILVA
adopted a high monotone for most
of her speeches which depressed me
a good deal. Much of the other
acting was quite good, particularly
that of Mr. CREMLIN as Caleb; but
his "Maister, Maister" got on rr.y
nerves towards the end. M.

THE BABY AND THE
BACHELOR.
A CONTEMPORARY tells of an un-
kissed baby, whoso parents enforce
on visitors to their house the fol-
lowing rules among others: —
Don't kiss the baby.
Don't handle buby unless your hands are
very, very clean.
Don'l bring baby's face close to your own or
to your hair.
We do not like to accuse this
worthy young Bradford couple of
perverting another person's ideas,
but it is n very curious thing that
we were about to publish and put
on the market, a handy little card for
the use of bachelors. It was to be
something like a cabdriver's number
plate, easily slipped within the coat
or waistcoat, and attached by a
cord to the button. It was intended
for display on entering any house
with a baby in it, and among its in-
junctions were the following: —
Don't ask me to kiss the baby.
Don't ask me to talk to the baby,
in any known or unknown language.
Don't ask me who it is that the
baby most resembles.
Don't talk to me about the in-
telligence and cleverness of the baby.
Don't ask me to hold the baby
just to see what I look like.
Don't bring the baby any nearer
to me than the top of the stairs.
Don't object to my calling the
baby " it." I didn't know he was a
girl.

The people of Iceland, while out-

will induce them to tolerate the suze-

on the frontier, and geysers are hurriedly
being got ready. The Islanders are
much touched at the sympathy of Great
Britain.
DOUGLAS, Friday.
The Declaration of Independence
made by the Isle of Man is looked upon
as a natural sequence to the events of
the last few days. The rumour that
troops are massing at Greeba Castle is
quite unfounded. The roads are merely
being patrolled by four-inch gunners.
SARK, Saturday.
Despite all rumours to the contrary, it
is now certain that Sark will remain an
integral portion of the British Empire.
Independence is not desired by the people,
and the idea of a French occupation is
abhorrent to the majority of the islanders.
There are no troops being massed on the
frontier, and perfect order prevails.

ELLEN TERRY was not actually born in a theatre, but
her father and mother were strolling players, and when
the babies born to them were too Small to be left
alone in lodgings, they were wrapped up in a shawl
and put to sleep in their mother's dressing-room at the
theatre. The great actress obtained her first view of
an audience from the vantage-ground of the property

in a pantomime in Glasgow, and little ELLEN, whose
yellow hair made her seem born for the part, had it
assigned to her. Reviewing a long career spent for the
most part in the glare of the footlights, ELLEN TERRY
is as simply herself as she is in her best parts on the
stage. The book is, in its main characteristics, viva-
cious, tender, humorous, occasionally tearful. There
is not throughout a shade of that jealousy alleged to be
prevalent in the profession
she adorns. She has a kind
word to say for everyone, its
value increased by its dis-
crimination. The keenest,
most searching, and most
original criticism ever written
of HENRY IRVING will be found
in the pages of Tlic Story «f
My Life (HuTcniNSON). The
Ordinary critic sits in the stalls
and watches the player from

TERRY, analysing the acting
of several great actors and
actresses, regards them from
the level of the stage, watch-
ing them with the eyes of an
expert. A book of rare in-
terest, which has the charm
of the spontaneous talk of a
wise and witty woman, is
enriched by many photo-
graphs, showing the authoress
and her contemporaries in
divers characters assumed
at various stages of their career.
Arthur's (LANE) is not the famous old club in St.
James's Street, S.W., but is situated somewhere be-
tween Kennington and Brixtou—where the bricks and
mortar go to. It is called by the name of its proprietor;
there is no entrance-fee and no subscription; and ladies
are admitted, with cr without male escort, at all hours
of the night. Also soldiers, sailors, draymen, printers,
tramps and journalists—in fact, anyone and everyone
whose work or pleasure takes him abroad at night, and
therefore induces in him a desire to drink coffee and eat
Swiss roll at three o'clock in the morning. Personally,
I have always fought shy of coffee-stalls, though once, in
the days of old-fashioned winters, I was driven by the frost
to eat a hot potato off a barrow on Addisou Road bridge,
and twice, after closing time at my club, I have con-
sumed thick rashers of bacon and scalding tea in a
cabman's shelter near Hyde Park Corner. Happily, Mr.
A. NEIL LYONS is made of sterner stuff. Night after
night he has eaten and drunk with the night-wanderers
of the pavement on his way home from Fleet
Street, and has learnt to understand the pathos
GETTING OVER THE DIFFIC'ULTY.
and the tragedy and the humour of their lives.
Sometimes I seem to detect in his history of Arthur's
the artificiality which is apt to dog the steps of
the journalist in search of copy. But in the main—and
especially when he is writing of the mother-feeling and
the sense of modesty which perhaps never quite desert
the breasts of those unhappy women whose very woman-
liness and beauty have been often their curse—he seems
to get right at the heart of things; and I confess to a
real admiration for this philosopher of the coffee-stall.
I am without sixteen pages of Maurice. Guest (HEINE-
MANN), owing to an error in binding, but have a duplicate
copy of pp. 145-160, so that, if there is any other col-
lector in a complementary position, we might exchange.
As, however, the full allowance is 562 pages, and
closely printed at that, the part which I got was suffi-
cient to enable me to gather the drift of the plot and
to discover that it is by no means a pleasant one. I
take it that this is HENRY HANDEL RICHARDSON'S first
novel, and, though he is both
eloquent and earnest, and has
a power of describing gusts
of emotion and passionate
crises with a vividness that
belongs properly to the Rus-
sian school, 1 do wish he
could have told us more about
the nice people (there arc
several in the story) and less
about the utterly bad.
Maurice Guest goes out to
Leipzig with the intention of
carving out a career for him-
self as a musician, but instead
of performing this operation
he becomes hopelessly 'iifatu-
ated with the cast-off » -{stress
of Schilsky, a violinist whose
genius entirely fails to con-
done a multitude of most
abominable faults. But
Louise is not much better, and
her neurotic aberrations begin
to pall on the reader long be-
fore the end comes, when
Maurice, having seen her return to her former
lover, blows out his own brains. Musicians, of
course, are supposed to be " bundles of nerves," and a
little careless about the moral code; but the treatment
of certain incidents in this book makes me think that
gaps of sixteen pages or so might with great advantage
have been strewn more thickly over it.

I am exceedingly sorry for Mr. MARMADUKE PICKTHALL,
and truly his case is hard. Several years ago he wrote
a book about the Near East, called Said the Fisherman,
and it was hailed by the select few as a work of genius,
as I also think it. But, mark, he has been writing
books steadily ever since, only to be greeted each time
with the comment, " Oh, yes, very good, but by no means
another Said." 1 won't say it again; I will merely say
that I have enjoyed his latest, The Children of the Nile
] (MURRAY), but I don't consider it so good as one of his
earlier works. The moral is that when an author begins
his work with a superlative effort he should lock it
up until he is old and tired and then publish it. To
put it forth first is merely to provide a cruel world
with a weapon against himself.

Did you not notice in your newsy rag
How your affairs had reached an awful crisis
Pregnant with menace to your farthing fag?
It must have shocked those tissues where the heady
Fumes of the weed had got an early start;
Must have unnerved a system which already
Betrayed the ravages of " smoker's heart."
Yet you are not to think that no one heeded
Your claim to live your own life how you please;
Stout spokesmen for the little puffer pleaded,
And FREDERICK BANBURY (Bart.) was one of these.
Almost he might have been your very mother,
So movingly, in accents soft and mild,
He urged the nation not to go and smother
The spark of freedom blown on by a child.

DEAREST DAPHNE, — Of the houseful

charming, so devoted; and how

always a Crisis and the women wear
ever so many necklaces and no cor-
staying hero too, doesn't like
BLORYN, and warns me that, if I
got mixed up in international in-
trigues, T may get put in the Tower.
As if that would choke me off!
Why, it 's simply a dilly idea. I
of. I 've all sorts of lovely schemes.
I 'm going to have a Kowdiarian band
in national dress to play at all my
parties. Next time I 'm in town I
shall have the Kowdiarian Minister
to dinner, and shall make a point of
looking up the Kowdiarian cojony in
London, and being At Home to
them. And oh, my dearest, I have
such a splenny idea for making the
next Earl's Court show a Kowdiarian
one—all their native arts and indus-
sets. The Prince is simply quite; really think if I were put in the' tries, you know. (NORTY says they

makes himself a King, and mean to
use every ounce of influence I have
in a quarter that I daresay you know

I don't listen to him.)
I 've set my heart on
having "Kowdiaria in

(who '11 bo a King then)
coming over to open it.
Would you like to know
what is the newest game,
now the nights have got
so dark? Burgling, my
dear, no less! The
other night we were a bit
hard up for some fun, so
a lot of us masked our-
selves and muffled up and
motored over to BOSH and
WEE-WEE'S, five miles
off, and broke in. Every-
thing was dark and quiet,
we knew the place by
heart, and did things in
quite professional style.
We made a grand haul;
two of WEE-WEE'S jewel-
cases, a lot of clocks, in
fact more things than I
can remember—oh, yes,
NORTY took all BOSH'S
rowing cups and things
he won in his old athletic
days. We 'd so much
spoil we could hardly
cram it and ourselves
into the motors. And
then, when we 'd got to a
safe distance, we began
to laugh, and laughed all
the way back here. We
left off then, however—at least 7
did, for we found that, while we were
away, this place had been burgled!
My black pearls were gone, and my
new key-pattern diamond tiara, and
all the umbrellas, and, worst of all,
my darling Pompon in his little bye-
bye basket! I was almost distracted.
Next day was pouring wet, and, as
there were no umbrellas, our walk-
ing people had to do without their
favourite exercise. BOSH and WEE-
WEE turned up early. "We were
burgled last night," said BOSH.
"So were we," said I. And then,

before another word was spoken,
WEE-WEE gave them away by burst-
ing out triumphantly, "You lost
more than we did." "You ridicu-
lous little person!" said BOSH.
"Couldn't you have held your
tongue for five minutes?" Funny,
wasn't it, that the very night we
broke in there they should break in
hero? There was a mutual restora-
tion of property; but things aren't
quite as they were before. BOSH
says some of his rowing cups and
things have got dinted; JOSIAH com-
plains that his favourite umbrella
hasn't come back with the others;
and my darling Pompon has suffered
in health through having his night's
rest broken up and not getting quite
the sort of brekky he 's used to. So
there are what politicians call
"strained relations" between us.
BADS has started a Society Weekly
called People Who Count, and it 's
caught on like anything, having
more "authority," you see, than
other things of that kind. She does
the parties and gossip herself, and a
column of mysterious hints and ques-
tions called "Innuendoes for the
Initiated." (I '11 let you into a little
secret, cherie. She invents half of
them herself, and generally the half
that most "tickles the cars of the
outsiders," as MILTON says.) POPSY,
Lady EAMSGATE, has been writing
her Reminiscences in P.W.C., and
they were an immensely popular
feature, till the Press Censor, or
whatever he 's called, put a stop to
them. BABS doesn't know what to
get instead.
Aunt GOLDIE left here in a huff
yesterday. And over what, I '11 ask
you. She 'd been complaining of
something or other, and wound up
with the original remark, "It 's a
strange world! " I merely said inno-
cently, "Haven't you got used to
it yet, Aunt? " and she asked NORTY
if he "liked to hear his wife in-
sulted," had all her juvenile adorn-
ments packed up, and was off.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.

THE IDEAL HOME.
ABOUT three years ago I was some-
thing of a cook. I used to take a
piece of butter the size of a walnut,
shred slightly, stir and bring slowly
to the boil. Then garnish with fresh
parsley, and serve hot. That was
cn.lled Aloi/au dc bombc glacce a la
bonne fcnimc, so far as I remember.
Sometimes 1 would forget to garnish,
and drop a piece of coke in by mis-
take. Then it was called Soup for
Charitable Purposes, and we had to
put it aside to cool.
I fancy I was even better with the
pastry. The atmosphere I used to
get into a Swiss roll! The—the
o/one. (It must have been the oven).
What a touch, too, with the blanc-
mange—what a polish ou its pink
outside!
But perhaps the feat I am proudest
of is this: that I alone of living men
have seen a rabbit dressed for cook-
ing and remained a follower of the
Higher Life. "Dressed," you know
—well, really!
I mention these facts not in any
spirit of boastfulness, but simply to
explain my interest in the Ideal
Home Exhibition. 1 had gone there
expecting to see the whole building
full of men cooking and women darn-
ing stockings; of large men taking a
piece of butter the size of a cocoannt,
and active women doing the Potato
Stitch and the Jacob's Ladder
Stitch. Of course, as soon as I had
pr.id my shilling I saw that I was ir
for something quite different, but
none the less I was prepared for a
pleasant and instructive afternoon.
"And," I said to myself, " since this
really is the ideal home, I need have
no qualms about lighting a pipe."
The fact that 1 had no matches
did not worry me; the ideal home
would have a dozen boxes in each
room. I went up to the gentleman
at the nearest stall.
"Can you let me have a match?'
I said politely.
He turned a curious red colour.
"A lueifer," I explained. "A
pine vesta. Something of that sort.'
He got quite scarlet, so I decidec
to explain further. "Er—why I waul
a match is because I wish to ignitt
this tobacco. I may say that I have
paid my shilling at the gate
and—
By this time he was purple.
"If your hesitation," I triec
desperately, " is due to the fact thai
you only have the sort that strike or
the box, 1 may say that I always
carry a small portion of the preparei
surface with me."
He turned away abruptly, and
went off to speak to somebody else.
'.n resignation I raised my eyes . . .
md came upon this notice :—
THE ELECTRIC COOKEU.
A BOON FOII EVEIIY HOME.
No MATCHES REQUIRED.
Well, really, it wasn't my fault.
Of course I was more careful
.iftcr that. I passed the " Quicklit"
uul the " Yuseitt " departments, and
the stall of the " Brytenup Polisher"
[I '11 give you three guesses why it's
called that); and so I came to Number
2901 or thereabouts. My pipe was
still unlit.
"I beg your pardon," I said,
but what is your I 'm just
setting up house, and so I am very
much interested in all these scientific
methods of cooking. Is this"
"The Hypograph," he explained.
"Ah yes, I "vc always felt that
How exactly"
"It is a simple instrument for
drawing two classes of curves, with
the aid of which numerous beautiful
and complicated patterns can be
made."
I took out my watch and felt my
wrist anxiously.
"My pulse has stopped," I said.
"This is Olympia, isn't it'?"
"Yes."
"Then I "ve como on the wrong
day."
"The wrestling was last year," he
said sarcastically. "This is the
Ideal Home Exhibition."
"It is? Oh, I beg your pardon.
And yon draw those delightful
curves? How jolly. That 's really
all it does?"
"Oh, no," he said, getting quite
pleased again. "Yon can make any
pattern you like. Now, this way"
"Yes, yes. But I mean you can't
light the oven with it or do the heat-
ing or anything like that? No?
You 're sure? Then—yon won't
mind my asking you for a match?"
It turned out, when he understood
properly, that he did mind. As h<
seemed to mind a good deal I hurried
off and went up to the gallery. Anc
in the gallery I met the Potted Meat
Frill.
When I am married (which may
never be) I shall have a potted meat
frill in every room. I picture to my-
self a delightful domestic scene. My
wife in one corner of the drawing-
room putting the frills on the potted
moat; myself in the, other with the

out any matches, our children
But I am a bit premature. We
lon't get to the children till Stall

The Potted Meat Frill can be ob-
;ained for two shillings. (Some
people would bo content with a mere
Ham and Tongue Net Frill for one-
and-ninepence, but I am a bit above
that. Though it is so useful in the
liome, it is not often given as a
wedding present, most brides pre-
ferring tho Sardine Dish Frill fit

a thing which every householder
should have, even though he has to
go without his stamp album from
Stall 207.
But of course the crown of the
Ideal Home Exhibition is the Baby-
and Section. There may be houses
(though I cannot imagine them)
where the. inmates drag out an exis-
tence without ever feeling the want
of a Hypograph; but there will never
bo palace or cottage which would not
be glad of an exhibit from Stall 108.

six months) was crying a little, but
BOBBY and JANE were happy enough.

up
there for. Whereupon I went to
the place where- they sell the baby

gentleman there: "You sell baby-

He said " Yes."

He admitted he was.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN SEARCH OF A KING.
IT may not bo generally known
that for some days past a small but
determined group of Servian patriots
has been in England busily engaged
in attempting to find a new ruler for
their agitated country, in place of
the discredited PETER.
In the ordinary way it is custo-
mary to approach the possessors of
royal blood; and that, indeed, has
been done by certain of the more
traditional patriots. But the group
now in this country, believing as it
does in the need of a totally fresh
regime and the importation of wholly
novel blood, has displayed singularly
unconstitutional energies.
Replying to the deputation, which
awaited him in the Court of Honour
of Greeba Castle, Mr. HALL CAINE
said that nothing could give him
greater satisfaction than to receive
such a tribute to his success as an
influencer of men; and there was,
he agreed, some fitness in the invi-
tation to himself, the author of
Pete, to succeed PETER. If after
abdicating the Servian throne he
should choose (as he certainly might,
being the author of The Eternal City)
to become Pope, his case might be
summed up in the words: Pete,
Peter, Petest. But he must say
"No." (Servian panic.) Manxland,
he felt, had need of him; and one must
not abandon one's own country. He
would rather continue the uncrowned
king of his little island than wear
the most gorgeous of Servian purple.
On the spokesman of the party
pointing out that he would still be
allowed to wear his knickerbockers
and look more or less like SHAK-
SPEAUE, Mr. HALL CAINE said that
that certainly made a difference, but
he must repeat his negative.
Mr. ANDREW CARNEGIE, who was
waited upon in one of the libraries
of Skibo, made a similar reply. He
was proud, he said, to be thus sup-
plicated, but the throne was not for
him. Perhaps they were unaware of
his work on Democracy? He could
not go back on that O/>HS. Moreover,
he had still much to do in his own
sphere—there were still some mil-
lions of pounds to bo got rid of,
either to heroes or free readers. The
most ho could do would bo to offer
all Servian adults a library apiece.
The spokesman having declined
this embarrassment with much tact,
the deputation withdrew.
Sir OLIVER LODGE, who received
the patriots in the sanctum of his
charming residence at Edgbaston,
stated that ho was prepared to accept

First Anti-Su/rnfjist. "TiiE IDEA OF THEIR WANTIN' TO BE LIKE us!"
Sernnd .4.-.S'. "YES, MAKIN' THEMSELVES UTTERLY RIDICULOUS!"
the Crown on two conditions—(1)
that ho should be allowed to reside
in Birmingham and conduct the
affairs of state tolcpathically, and ('2)
that Mr. HAROLD BKGBIK should bo
appointed Prime Minister. The depu-
tation withdrew hurriedly.
Miss CIIKISTAHEL PANKILURST agreed
that it would be very delightful to
be a queen and niako laws and sec
that they were obeyed; but what
about the Movement in England to
which she had consecrated her life,
if she became tho Servian ruler?
Having put her hand to the plough,
she would not look back—not while
a Liberal Member remained in
Parliament.
Tho deputation fared equally
badly with Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL,
Lord ROSSLYN, and Miss RUTH ST.
DENIS, who said it would be sweet
to reign, but her art demanded all
her thought and time.
The Editor of The Sphere was then
visited, chiefly on tho favourable
promise hold forth by his name, it
being felt that if there was one thing
that Serviii needed after tho tortu-
ous ways of tho inclement KING
PETKR, it was the beneficial sway of
a CLEMENT KING SHORTER. The
modern CATO of literature, however,
said "No," not without a tear of
regret, and once again the patriots
withdrew.

WANDERING MINSTRELS.
WE arc rejoiced to learn that the
lesson of the visit of the Leeds Choir
to Paris is not to he thrown away;
indeed, it is already an open secret
that the famous Sheffield Festival
Choir will shortly take a trip to
Canada for the purpose of
taking part in several
oratorio performances and
promoting Imperial solid-
arity in the domain of
music.
These examples, it is
pleasant to think, arc likely
to prove fruitful in a num-
ber of unexpected ways.
The less important objects
of M. ISVOLSKY'S visit to
London are well known.
It is not so well known
that his paramount anxiety
was to persuade Sir
EmvAitn GKKV to induce
Mr. HENRY .T. WOOD and
Ills orchestra to tinder-
take a tour in Persia for the
purpose of harmonising the
conflicting parties in that
distracted kingdom. The
negotiations were p r o-
tracted, but we under-
stand that in the end M.
ISVOLSKY carried his point,
and that Mr. WOOD and
his band will start for
Tabriz in about, a fort-
night's time, to replace
the Cossacks who have
hitherto entirely failed to
suppress or conciliate the
Nationalist:-!. The band,
which will bo materially
strengthened in the per-
cussion department, will
number one hundred and
fifty performers, and Mr.
WOOD will be accom-
panied by four analytical
programme writers, two
butterfly - tie makers,
fourteen flashlight photo-
graphers, a staff of ton-
sorial artists, and three ad-
ditional biographers.
Almost simultaneously
with Mr. WOOD'S depar-
ture for the Middle East,
Mr. THOMAS BEECIIAM, the con-
ductor of the New Symphony
Orchestra, accompanied by the Hol-
loway Choir and Mr. WILLIAM
CARTER, will set out for South Africa
to promote the cause of unification
at the Durban Conference. It is felt
that nothing could more powerfully
reinforce the arguments of the dele-
gates in favour of unity than the con-
cord of sweet and healing sounds for
which the foregoing names arc the
best possible guarantee. The. New
Symphony Orchestra, who look for-
ward to the trip with the utmost
enthusiasm, have gone into strict
training on biltong, mealie pap and
Cape smoke; and Mr. BEECIIAM, with

matic pontoons to the great lakes,
where Sir FREDERICK 'BRIDGE intends
to instruct them in the gentle art of
hippo fishing with the dry fly, at
which he is exceptionally proficient.
Mr. MAX HUMBERGEH, the famous
violinist, accompanied by
Mrs. HUMHERGER and their
infant son PAGANINI HUM-
BEKGKR, will shortly start
on a tour in the Arctic
Circle. The degraded con-
dition of the Eskimo has
long given Mr. HUMBERGER
deep concern, and he has
conceived the noble plan of
raising them to a higher
plane of humanity and
citizenship by the purifying
influence of his unequalled
virtuosity. The announce-
ment of his prolonged and
heroic absence from Lon-
don has been greeted with
immense enthusiasm by his
brother artists. An ex-
hibition of the furs to be
worn by the party during
their sojourn in the Far
North will be open for a

its origin and scope is the
mission shortly to be under-
taken to China by the Earl

pose of converting the Dow-
ager Empress to an appre-

Lord TANKKUVILLK, as The
Daily Chronicle has fre-
quently reminded us, is a
singer of extraordinary
charm and persuasiveness,
and it is anticipated that

of his wonderful voice will

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TODY, M.P.
House of Commons, Mnndny,
October 12th.—Back to school after
the autumn holidays. Quite a full
muster in Lords and Commons.
Note two absentees from latter place.
Head Boy of Opposition has given
himself extra day's holiday. EDWARD
GREY remains in seclusion of Foreign
Office. This disappointing to Mem-
bers on both sides prepared to give
FOREIGN SECRETARY something in
way of ovation. Slightest apprehen-
sion of such a thing sufficient to warn
off E. G.
"Public life, TOBY, dear boy," he
said the other day, "would be
possible but for its public appear-
ances. If I were permitted to do all
my work in this room" (wo were
talking in the F.O. about the rare
silence of Emperor WILLIAM at a
grave European crisis) " I should be
content."
To do him justice, E. G. make:;
the most of his opportunities of with-
drawing himself from public gaze.
During the Session comes down to
House twice a week, answers string
of questions addressed to him by
eminent authorities on Foreign
Affairs seated below gangway, and
incontinently bolts.
In his absence, PREMIER read care-
fully drafted statement on Balkan
Crisis. In political area situation has
developed an attitude creditable to
the highest traditions of Party
system. Opposition corne back more
than ever disgusted with Govern-
ment. Licensing Bill remains all
their fancy painted it. Education
Bill, Labour in Mines Bill, just as
bad. Faced by crisis in Foreign
Politics, political partisanship is
obliterated. Just now is realised ideal
condition of affairs " when none were
for a Party but all were for the State."
In the Lords, LANSDOWNK seized
opportunity to pay tribute to the
statement made by FOREIGN SECRE-
TARY last week. "Nothing," he said
amid general cheering, "could be
more dignified in tone or more ap-
propriate in substance."
This the sort of thing that occa-
sionally refreshes and ennobles
British Party politics.
Commons spent quiet, useful
evening discussing the Children's
Charter; comes on for consideration
after treatment by Grand Com-
mittee. In absence of PRINCE
ARTHUR; COUSIN BOB, K.C., took
the floor. Obliged with several
speeches. Old hatred, common to
the CECILS, of anything approaching

interference with perfect freedom of
the people displayed itself in resist-
ance to stringent provisions of the
Bill. One makes it criminal offence
for boy or girl under sixteen to buy
cigarettes or cigarette-papers, much
more to be seen smoking in public
places.
From this petty tyranny COUSIN
BOB'S soul revolted. It was said
that cigarette smoking wrought much
evil among the children and there-
fore it must be put down with strong
hand of the Law. Over-eating of
sweets or sitting up late at night was
harmful to the infant body. Yet the
Bill has no penal prohibition of these
practices.
Then there was smoking brown
paper. (Here he paused, and his
mind seemed to travel back to days
when, personally, he could not de-
termine which made the more delect-
able smoke, cane or brown paper.)
Yet the Bill submitted by His
MAJESTY'S Government with demand
for enactment did not penalise the
sybarite under sixteen whom prac-
tice had made a connoisseur of the
varying qualities of brown paper used
in preference to, or in default of,
tobacco.
Thus, assisted by carefully-pre-
pared brief and animated gestures,
did a lofty mind, skilled in legal lore,
trained at the Bar, prattle on by the
half-hour.
Business done.—House resumes
sittings. Children's Charter con-
sidered on Report stage.

ffered in course of debate on the
Children's Charter. Went straight

"Drop your talk about the Chil-
dren's Bill," she shrieked, " and give

That was all. True that at this
iioment the closure was put into
iperation. The arms of a gallant
nessenger standing by the doorway
;ently but firmly closed round the
raist of the lady on her legs addrcss-
ng the Chair, and she was borne

All very well for her. But what

Sympathy of the House goes forth
o him with generous rush. Has

haltered. All happened so rapidly,
oo. Mr. IDKIS was seated at table

ippiiig glass of mineral water with

vhat much better quality was turned

water flat. A lady's behest com-
mands instant obedience.
Mr. IDRIS hastened to find the
dame. Conducted her through the
lines of unsuspecting police in the
lobbies, past the guardians at the
doorway, up to the very glass door
opening on the sacred precincts
forbidden to foot of female when the
SPEAKEK is in the Chair. On the
left hand is a step giving access to a
window-pane through which woman,
herself unseen, has often gazed on

stepped down, again assiduously
helped by the hon. Member. He

outer Lobby to the Gallery upstairs

round, and In! the lady was not.
She had dashed through the swinging
glass doors.
"Like a cork out of a soda-water
bottle," as Mr. IDRIS put it, his mind
in excitement of moment reverting
to familiar associations.
To his horror he realised that she
was addressing the House. Next
thing he saw was the lady in the
arms of the attendant. A man of
business, Mr. IDRIS immediately
realised the situation. Ho was
relieved from attendance on the
dame. The police would look after
her. So he wended his way back to
the dinner table to find the joint cold

bers." How is that to be done? At
school, as some of us remember, a
boy was " endorsed " on the back by
irate master as if he were a Bill;
which, indeed, he might chance to
have been. Would have made no
difference had he been TOM, DICK or
HARRY. Evidently that's not what
GREENWOOD means. Explanation
doubtless is that, owing to profound
emotion, even an ex-Lieutenant o
Canadian Militia with eight years
service to his credit, stumbled upon
elliptical sentence.
Till one heard GREENWOOD pro
nounce the word " WOMEN," pre
faced by the comprehensive " ALL,'
one never imagined what possibilities
of infamy the sex barely conceals.
The tone of tragic denunciation with
which the dissyllable was invested
was varied by bitter scorn when in
subsequent sentence he spoke of
"TiiE VISITING WOMAN." Final
reference to " pagan tribes in remote
parts of the world," contrasted to
detriment of the home-grown female
article, though effective, was trifling
compared with the blood-curdling
effect of his enunciation of a familiar
word.

AT THE PLAY.
I.—"L.Anv EPPINT.'S LAWSUIT."
WHEN I suw Mr. HURERT DAVIES'S
new "Satiricul Comedy," before a
curtain-raiser had been affixed to it,
the whole evening's performance only
lasted a couple of hours. Even so, I
should have been better pleased with
myself if I had arrived an hour late.
The First Act was strangely ineffec-
tive. Yefc there was plenty of good
material in it to be set off against
some rather thin stuff; but nearly all
the cast seemed anxious to rush it
through, as if they were afraid that
people's patience wouldn't last out
till they got to the really funny things
a little further on. Apart from the
pleasant episode of the lady inter-
viewer and the photographer, which
started too suddenly and proceeded
al>ovc the speed limit, there was
little enough diversion in the way of
side-shows, and the task of keeping
things going fell with almost
monotonous insistence upon the
gentle shoulders of Miss MARY
MOORE as Lady K^ping. She tackled
it bravely and cleverly, but got very
little active help from the only other
character of any importance, the
successful playwright. Mr. SAM
SOTHERN, who takes this part, has
all the negative virtues, in particular
the rare and priceless gift of being
able to keep still; but no one could
well have looked, or acted, much
less like a young dramatist just
arrived and busy climbing into smart
society.
Then there was the boudoir-stage,
which seemed to cramp the activities
of my lady's week-end party—a
whole Epping Forest of strange
botanical specimens, including a
cedar of Lebanon (Scotch variety),
which showed so little sign of being
acclimatised that I heartily wished it
back in its own soil.
However, the Third Act made
amends. Here Mr. DAVIES used to
excellent purpose his chance of satiriz-
ing the lighter side of our administra-
tion of justice. The good things, and
they were many, were more equally
spread about, Bench, Counsel, Plain-
tiff and ]Defendant all securing a
reasonable proportion, though Mist?
MARY MOORE still took the lioness's
share. Her casual disregard for the
sanctity of the Court, and her treat-
ment of the whole thing as a social
function run for her benefit, com-
pletely charmed the audience into
forgotfulness of their earlier discon-
tent, and sent them away, if not
replete, yet with appetite modestly
appeased.
II.—" FANNY AND THE SERVANT
PROBLEM."
The tyranny of the man-servant
has become the dominant note of
modern British drama. Mr. J. K.
JEROME'S new variety is an advance,
in the matter of complication, both
on Crichton, and the valet of Bel-
lamy tlic Magnificent. Not only is
he the unquestioned master of Ban-
tock Hall, with no fewer than
twenty-two family connections in
what is practically his employ, but
the new Lady Bantock, who had
been married from the Paris music-
halls (whore she seems to have
picked up a powerful American
accent) turns out, to the pained
surprise of both, to be a runaway
niece of his. Out of cither of these

conditions a reasonable comedy
might have been made, but the com-
bination of them offers an irresistible
incentive to farce. The author calls
his work "a quite possible play."
Most things, of course, are possible;
the trouble is that so few of them are,
probable.
All through the, play it is a battle
royal between mistress and man, and
ir. the end she ha=i t:) stoop lo con-
quer. Miss I-'ANNIE WARD, as her
namesake, though perhaps she could
not fully command the pathetic, mood,
showed a very mobile intelligence,
particularly in the Second Act, where
she made a most piquant appearance
in a mid-Victorian gown which had
been pressed upon her by a maid
who had strong views about, the pro-
prieties. To the ladies of the audi-
ence, the humour of this spectacle
(easily grasped) was a source of huge
delight. Mr. CARTWRIOHT, as the
Butler, played conscientiously, but
took up too much of our time. Miss
CARLOTTA ADDISOM and Miss MEASOR
were a pair of indistinguishably
charming maiden aunts, who, like
their nephew, the rather invertebrate
Lord Bantock (Mr. LESLIE FABER),
were hopelessly under the dominion
of their meiny.
I don't know if Mr. JEROME is
anxious to dissipate the personal im-
pressions that his other play, The
Passing of the Third Floor Back,
may have left upon its audiences.
Certainly, in Fanny and the Servant
Problem he throws off his reverential
attitude and invites us to laugh at
sanctity and its symbols. He would
probably say that his new people are
hypocrites: but the ridicule in these
cases nearly always falls in effect on
the thing abused, rather than on the
abuse of it. O. S.

A TECHNICAL illustrated monthly, "The Airship and

the progress of the world in all that appertains to

supererogation we have heard of, but what is this latest
claimant to the attention of Dr. Mi'KUAV? Truly the
language of the upper strata, if this specimen gains
currency, is passing beyond our ken and becoming too
rarefied altogether. "To aviate" is nauseous enough,
and "planing," in the atmospheric slang of country-
house parties, is pretty bad; but we do draw the line at
"aerogation." The purveyors of ethereal " shop " will
shortly be weighing in with asrobats and airgincers,
atmobuses and other horrific hybrids. The great tailor-
ing firms are already designing aeroplane costumes, and
soon it will be too late to protest. When the trade gets
hold of the classical lexicons, beware of the con-
sequences.

A MUTUAL DISAPPOINTMENT.
(Jle'nifi tin unrecorded incident of llm Arjc of Chivalry.)
It is customary for dramatic critics to inform the
luckless author that his plot would make a better
novel than it does a play; but Mr. FRANKFORT MOORK
has reversed the situation, for his novel, Love and
Uic Interloper (lIuTciiiNSoN) would be more suc-
cessful on boards theatrical than within those pro-
vided by the bookbinder. It is, indeed, pure melo-
drama, even to the hasty father, who exclaims, "I
see it all now. Oh, but you were easily duped!" But
the beautiful Irish heroine, as was right and proper,
was not duped after all when she fell in love with the
gamekeeper, who actually, of course, was not a game-
keeper at all, but a real English Major who had been
in real wars. There is also the heavy villain, a bogus
Captain, who is naturally put to flight and shame in
the last chapter—or is it the Fifth Act?—when all ends
happily, and virtue triumphs. Though the scene is
laid in Ireland, with the necessary machinery of ban-
Plenty to puzzle, though nothing to trouble you,
Everything kindly and most of it gay,

Seagoing worthies, and longshoremen various,
Humorous schemers for numerous ends,
Lovemakers turbulent, placid, hilarious—
Those are his friends.

Such are a few of the folk at his call;

Mixed with two others tied up in a knot;

Till it 's made up with the hand of the chef in it;

Boy. "'E's GOT MT KTE!"
THE MODEL HOME.
Ou, LOVE IN A COTTAGE.
TIME was (when charming bungalows were scanty
And bijou villas had not flecked the plains)
I dreamed of married bliss inside a shanty,
For love is more thari drains.
I wooed a maiden then, the queen of mortals,
But less inclined than I to laugh at gold;
So, since it did not run to marble portals,
The banns were never told.
But now on every side I note upspringing
Delightful cottages, like dwarf hotels,
Where Amaryllis and her spouse are ringing
Their own electric bells.
Where luxury and cheapness go together,
And up-to-date improvements blossom free;
The walls are built to stand our island weather,
The baths are h. and c.
I note, I say, these nutshell Paradises,
And, noting, muse upon my faithless love;
These little Edens might have solved the crisis
Referred to up above.
In some such home she might have lived contented
To share (on gravel soil) a pauper's lot;
But as the pleasing type was not invented
Our idyll went to pot.
Nor am I certain, I who used to grovel,
Licking her fairy footstepd like a cur,
And picture heaven in a hut or hovel,
Or anywhere with her—
That I should find the prospect now so rosy,
Not even if the maid were free to come
And shrine her graceful presence in a cosy
Detached Elysium.
One grows more careful; and these glorious mixtures
Of cot and palace with their ten-foot drives—
They have no charm included in the fixtures
For making model wives.
FokLOWiNG on the action of The Daily Mail, which has
recently cabled to Constantinople, guaranteeing on
behalf of the British people that not a hair of Young
Turkey's head shall bo plucked, and has received in
answer the enthusiastic gratitude of the Ottoman
Empire, it is reported that The Tooting Advertiser has
sent a message in the following terms to the Grand
Slamjack of Novi-Bazar:—"Tooting Advertiser, an
mouthpiece of great British Nation, bids you feui
nothing"; and that a correspondent has cabled to this
effect: "A great demonstration of Novi-Bazarians hitv
been held outside the house of a British resident who it-
known to have once contributed a paragraph to Tin
Tooting Advertiser; and for three hours the air was renl
with rockets and cheers for Great Britain."

THE POLICE-COURT DICTIONARY.
[The following scene, based on Miss PANKHURST'S examination of
Mr. LI.OVD-OEOBKE as to the meaning of the phrase " to rush the House
of Commons,v is liable to occur at nny time.]
Suffragette (acting as Counsel for her'own defence).
Is your name HERBERT HKXKY ASQUITH?'
Witness. Yes, please.
You are, I think, at present the so-called Prime
Minister of England?—Yrcs, thank you.
Very well, then. Be so good as to answer my ques-
tions briefly and orally. Have you read our latest
handbill;'—I have glanced at it, but did not commit its
contents to memory.
Then I will read it to you. (Heads.) "Men and
brothers, come in your myriads to Parliament Square
to-morrow evening after dark and help us to stamp on
the police, overthrow the Liberal Party, make a clean
sweep of ASQUITH, annihilate- the Cabinet, and blow up
the House of Commons." Now, how does that strike
you?—Rather forcibly. (Laughter.)
Now let us take these phrases seriatim. First, "to
stamp on the police." Do you keep a dictionary at
home?
Witness (to Magistrate). Need I answer that question?
Magistrate. 1 think you had better be quite, frank.
Witness. Well, then, I keep two: a Webster for the
meaning of words, and a small handy one for spelling.
Nuffragctto. If you consult your Webster you will
find that the word "stamp " means " a mark set upon
things chargeable with duty to Government." May not
the police be described as " things chargeable with duty
to Government"?—Possibly; bi\t that doesn't make
the process of stamping less painful.
Kindly confine yourself to plain answers to my
questions. I find that " to stamp " means " to imprint;
us, /o stamp virtuous principles on the heart." Now,
taking the words "virtuous principles" as understood
in our phrase " to stamp on the police," can you detect
anything riotous in the invitation to como and stamp
virtuous principles on the police?—I should resent it if
anyone tried the operation on me.
I can well believe it would be a novel and shocking
experience to you. (Laughter.) Now pass to the next
phrase—"overthrow the Liberal Party." Havo you
ever plaved cricket?—Not of recent vears. I have taken
to golf. *
Still you will not have forgotten that the word " over-
throw" means an action on the part of a fielder
which causes extra runs to accrue to the side that is in.
Would your Party, who are at present in, object to any
;iction which increased their score through no merit of
their own?—On the contrary we want all the runs we
can get. But wasn't your " overthrow " more of a verb
than a noun?. ,
Don't quibble. Now look at the next phrase—" make
a clean sweep of ASO.UITH." Arc you prepared to deny
that a "sweep" is one who brushes the chimney
and so purifies the hearth?—No, but I only speak from
hearsay.
And is it not among .your duties as Prime Minister to
help to purify the national hearth?—That is, I believe,
the idea.
Then, morally speaking, you are a sweep? (Laugltter.)
—Not so black, I hope, as I am painted. (Renewed
laughter.)
"But if we made a clean sweep of you this would
remove, the chief blemish in your calling as a sweep?—
Yes; but I should want soft-soap, and you mustn't scrub
too hard. (Laughter, accompanied by clicks from news-
paper cameras.)
• Very well, then. I now come to the phrase—" anni-
hilate the Cabinet." What do you understand by the
word " annihilate "?—To reduce-to nothing.
Right first time. Bufr suppose- we are dealing with
nonentities? Is it possible to reduce nothing to nothing?
—It is certainly unusual.
I must trouble you to say Yes or No.—No.
Then to invite the public to "annihilate the
Cabinet " was to ask an impossibility—always a harm-
loss thing to do. And so we come to the final phrase—
"blow up the Houses of Commons." Now I find in my
lexicon that " to blow up " means " to scold violently."
Is it your experience that hard words ever broke any
bones?—I have never personally had any success
that way.
Very well, then. A second meaning is "to fill
with air.'' Would it in your opinion be likely to lead to
a- disturbance of the peace if an attempt were made to
give the House of Commons a better ventilation ?—Some
of the more, elderly Members might complain of the
draught.
We could give them shawls in exchange for votes.
(Loud laughter.) A third meaning is "to inflate, to
puff up; as, to blow up one with flattery." Have you
never heard of this being done by Members of Parlia-
ment to one another, or even to themselves?—I must
have notice of that question.
I will trouble you, finally, with one more dictionary
interpretation of the words " to blow up." They may
mean " to raise into the air," that is, to lift above the
level of earth into a purer atmosphere. In the case
of the Commons would this require violence?—I am of
that opinion.
But not necessarily physical violence?—No, spiritual
pressure might do it; but it would have to be violent.
Thank you, Mr. ASQUITH, that will do. You may
stand down. O. S.

Street proceedings, by a Correspondent who was unable
to be present, appears on page 322.]
MY WOODCOCK.
I STOOD in the ride, and the glamour
Of Autumn was gold on the trees,
While the far-away beaters' faint clamour
Was borne on the whispering breeze,
When* the voices that came through the cover
With the tapping of stick upon stock
Rang out with a roar—" Woodcock over!
Cock forward! Mark cock!"'
Like a weather-stained leaf that is lifted
When March is in maddest of moods,
Through the tops of the beeches he drifted,
A little brown ghost of the woods;
Bombarded witli passionate vigour.
He lazily dodged down the line,
And I knew, as. I pressed on the trigger,
I knew he was mine!
My bright locks may fade and grow duller,
My keen glance may weaken, but still
I shall see the soft pinion's warm colour,
The length of that insolent bill;
And, till Age leaves me withered and one-eyed
At the ultimate end of my road,
I shall hear the click-click of the gun I 'd
Omitted to load!

T'.C. "OH, I DCNKO. FULI.IN' SOME SILLY KOTTEII OUT OF A UOLK."
THE WASTERS.
PERHAPS I am over-thrifty—I can't
say. But there are times when I
cannot bear the* prodigality of our
authors.
Take this case. Thousands, per-
haps, might pass it unmoved, withers
unwrung; but wherever it crops up I
find myself in affliction over it. You
know the incident. It is where the
heroine, being in possession of cer-
tain gold that has a curse attached
to it, or somo rare jewels that have
apparently brought ill-luck, flings it
or them into the deep lake or river to
moonlight effects and a paean of
approbation on the part of the lover.
As thus:
She took the sparkling gems in
her hand, regarding curiously their
beauty and seeming innocence; then
she leaned over the high parapet and
dropped them through her fingers
into the silent waters beneath."
After which the pair of them go
home with a load off their minds.
They are also rather puffed up at
having done a courageous thing.
But would not a better way have
been to sell those jewels and devote
their value to some charitable use?
convert thorn—literally, the evil
things!—and get them into the way
of doing good? I hate to think of
all that treasure lying idle in the lake
or river; and there will perhaps come
a day when they will both regret
their sacrifice—a day when they
would be rather, glad of the stuff for
themselves, and when their minds
are not in quite such accord over the
disposal of it. He will recollect that
it was her light-hearted idea chucking
good money away, while she will
remind him that he, and ho alone,
suggested the very manner of its dis-
position.
There is, however, a more trifling
matter than this which yet disturbs
my equipoise to an even greater
degree. As a boy I was still more
strongly affected* by it than I am
to-day. It is where, after the receipt
of ill news, or the frustration of some
high hope, the heroine leaves a meal
untouched—tea, of all things! I
can see the tray temptingly set
forth—hot buttered toast, bread-and-
butter, clean, cheerful crockery, and
fragrant tea; but my lady has no
appetite, and either struggles with
half a slice of thin bread-and-butter,
or pushes away the whole thing in-
tact. The reader has to sit there
helpless and see it all spoiling. Hot
buttered toast! What calamity on
oarth can justify the rejection of hot
buttered toast? Meat, vegetables—
ah, that's another matter. There
are many times when the sight, or
even the thought, of such isabhorrent.
I could see a dinner-tray being left
untouched and not turn a hair. But
tea—refreshing tea. And thin bread-
and-butter. And toast—hot buttered
toast. I lose sympathy at once.
The next page—nay, the very next
paragraph—may palpitate with mys-
tery and emotion, but only with diffi-
culty can I force my eyes to pursue
the printed words. In spirit I am
dallying with the despised toast and
the thin bread-and-butter; mentally

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKI
I am stirring the hot, fragrant lea or
fondling the teapot.
I hear the villain creeping up the
si air; iu a vaguer sense I hear the
awful onward march of Fate; but 1
am unshaken. I am thinking of that
toast. What are the footsteps of
Fate to mo? I want to hear the
footsteps of MARY ANN corning to
save the ruins. If I cannot havo the
repast inynp.lt', at least MARY ANN
mrght 1)0 allowed to come and fetch
it before it is all cold and hopelessly
indigestible.
Can it be that authors themselves
are indifferent to the claims of tea
and toast'.' Or are they particularly
sensitive to them, and does a canker-
ing self-interest lie at the root of their
behaviour in this matter:' Do they,
for instance, hazily imagine, that in
some future life all the delectable
platefuls and cupfuls that havo been
spurned in their pages will fall to
their lot as author's perquisites'.'
But I can hardly credit them with
so fanciful a folly as that; and in
any case tea should not be allowed to
stand, and buttered toast wants
eating hot.
HOW TO EMPLOY THE
UNEMPLOYABLES.
INTKRKSTIXG SUGGESTIONS.
8m WILLIAM GRANTHAM'S proposal
that vork should be found for the
unemployed by planting the useless
land belonging to the Government
near Broadmoor with fir trees, to
be made into railway sleepers when
big enough, lias prompted a host
of correspondents to favour us with
similar suggestions for the relief and
employment of the unemployables.
A selection from their letters is now
placed before our readers :—
A BOON TO THEATRICAL MANAGERS.
DEAR SIR,—I believe there is no
doubt that, with some exceptions, the
theatres are not doing as well as their
lessees and managers would like.
Surely this state of affairs affords
fruitful scope for dealing with the.
unemployable element 'by utilizing
this class of " out-of-works " as dead-
beads on a large scale. I am em-
boldened to put forward this sugges-
tion by the facts that Mr. SNOWDKN,
M.P., in commenting on Mr. VICTOR
(IHAYSON'S conduct in the House of
Commons, laid special stress on its
theatricality, and that Mr. G. B.
SHAW has boldly taken his stand on
Mr. GRAYSON'S side. Would it not
be possible for Mr> SHAW to give a
series of performances of his plays in
which the leading parts were assigned
to Mr. GRAY SON, Mr. GRAY and other
prominent leaders, while the rank
and file were admitted to the stalls
and boxes'.; Yours faithfully,
COMMON SEN si;.
Tlic Arcade, Peebles, N.B.
ROAD HOGS AND THE UNEMPLOYABLES.
DEAR SIR,—As the number of
motor accidents is steadily increas-
ing, it seems to me that the leading
automobile organizations would be
doing a great public service if they
utilised the services of the uiieniploy-
ubles to remove or render first aid
to the victims along the most fre-
quented thoroughfares, such as the
Brighton and Portsmouth roads. If
they were stationed at intervals of
ten yards along the first-named road,
occupation would be found for no
fewer than 8,800 persons.
Yours faithfully,
EXPKRTO CREDE.
Moke Grange, Horlcy.
How TO SAVK ETON.
DEAR SIR,—There are, in round
numbers, some 1,100 boys at Eton,
our premier public school, but, un-
less I am greatly mistaken, there are
not more than seventy masters to
instruct the pick, the flower, the
crenic-de-la-cremc of British and
•Iuda-o-British youth. This is not us
it should be. The science of paeda-
gogics teaches us that individual
attention is of paramount importance
in higher education. The true ideal
should be one boy one master. I
therefore suggest that the teaching
staff of Eton should be at once sup-
plemented by one thousand of the
unemployables, whose special func-
tion should be to instruct their young
charges in the beauties of the simple
life, of strenuous thinking and con-
templative quietism. England is
being ruined by the. nervous ex-
haustion produced by the cult of
hustle. What we need to restore the
balance is a little more of the sweet
reasonableness of the Weary Willie.
Yours faithfully,
UTIIER PUPK.
Pimpernel Lodge, Mutton.
A HINT TO EDITORS.
DEAR SIR,-—The problem of the
unemployables is serious but not des-
perate. Personally I am convince 1
that it can be solved on the following
lines. The output of novels during
the last week has been so enormous
that a newspaper friend of mine tells
me that the floor of his editor's
sanctum has given way beneath their
superincumbent bulk, while his
literary staff is totally inadequate to
cope with their numbers. I suggest,
therefore, that all the leading papers
during the winter publishing season
should give at least temporary work
as novel-reviewers to those members
of the lion-working classes who are
incapable of sustained manual labour.
Faithfully yours,
TARI.EY BIN DELLS, M.A.
The tikelligs, Maida Vale.
MORE EDITORIAL CHANGES.
THE announcement that Mr.
ROOSEVELT, on leaving the White
House, will undertake the editorship
of Tlir Outlook (U.S.A.), at a salary
of £6,000 a year, has, naturally
enough, excited considerable envy
amongst other potentates and princes.
Thus we understand that King
PETKR of Servia has communicated
with bis distinguished namesake, Mr.
PETER KEARY, with a view to ascer-
tain whether, in the event of his
abdication, there would be any room
for him on the staff of Pearson's
Weekly.
The TSAR OF RUSSIA, so we are
credibly informed, has offered to
act as Russian correspondent for The
Skibbereen Eagle, at the modest
salary- of £250 a month, a request
which is receiving the attention of
the executive of the National
Directory in Dublin.
The SULTAN or TURKEY, whose
anxiety as to his future is by no
means reassured, has, we are told on
good authority, approached the pro-
prietors of The Poulterers' Gazcitc in
the hope of securing a remunerative
appointment 011 the staff of that well-
known and influential journal, should
his position at Yildiz Kiosk become
untenable.
The SULTAN or MOROCCO has, ac-
cording to trustworthy accounts, ap-
plied for the post of dramatic critic
to Tlte Lcathcniellem' Journal, at a
purely nominal salary.
In this context we may note that
Mr. GRAYSON, M.P., who has
recently been appointed joint editor
cf The Neii- Age, declines to corro-
borate the report that, on his leaving
the Board of Trade, Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL will join the staff as leader-
writer with a salary of £200 a week.
The nomination of Miss DOVE for
the Mayoralty of High Wycombe is
to be signalised by a new grand serial
in one of our leading halfpennies, en-
titled The Dove in the Marc's Nest.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOK OF THE MOMENT.*
I FOUND it, on my return from
holiday-making, amongst a score of
others, review copies mostly, that
awaited me upon my study table:
If, then, I select this modest and
slender little volume from among its
companions for detailed notice, it is
a proof that its appeal, to me cer-
tainly, was more direct and immedi-
ate than theirs. And this very
quality ia surely one of the primary
tests of literature.
In format it was, as I have hinted,
unpretentious. Small octavo would,
I believe, be the technical descrip-
tion, simply yet tastefully bound in
cream parchment (or is it buckram'.')
without lettering. These, however,
after all, are mere externals. It was
that within which claimed my atten-
tion, and of which I wish to speak
now. The record of little more than
a year (though this in itself is nothing,
since an entire novel can be written
about Three Weeks), in a style re-
strained and austere to the verge of
curtness, it unfolds a history of con-
temporary life such as I have seldom
known to be equalled, either for i'.v
firm grasp of essential facts, or cor-
responding disregard of mere acces-
sories. Not a line of description is
to be found from beginning to end of
the book; weather and scenery are
alike ignored; yet by a single touch
—a mere word, perhaps, or a name,
even the title of_a commercial firm—
the anonymous writer can bring be-
fore me the seasons and their chang-
ing attributes with r. vivid realism
for which HARDY or MEREDITH might
strive in vain.
One is tempted to quote. That
fine passage, for example, beginning
—" March 12th. Motor Co., £350"
—there is all the spring in this,
cleansing winds, and the call of the
open road. And then, almost imme-
diately below, comes a name that I
recall as that of the chairman of a
bench of rustic Kltallou'n, and at-
tached to it the significant figures
£•"> 6s. 8d. A whole tragedy in
two lines. What reticence, yet
what superb mastery of medium!
And these are only two instances out
of many.
Of the ethical value of the book it
would be almost impossible to speak
too highly. Though, in common
with other genre studies of a similar
type, it contains little actual plot, the
motive of the wrhole I take to be
expressed, clearly enough, in the form
of a tremendous contrast or parallel
between the two great attributes of
human existence — receptivity and

"j\Iv IIOOI) Gini,, TAKE THE CHILD OIT!"
"THAT'S ALL mciiiT, >Su;. WE ALWAYS DOES IT THIS WAY!"
distributiveness, the capacities, in-
herent in every one of us, of taking
in and giving out. It is in this con-
trast that the great interest of the
work lies. Thus, on the one side we
have the radiant, opening, due in part
to the influence of heredity, by which
a man may start with all the possi-
bilities of future greatness already,
so to. speak, in hand; on the other,
the corroding influences of everyday
life, the output of energy wastefully
exhausted in the combat with the
crowd.
Nor is this the only message of the
book. Not even in IBSEN'S Peer
(iynt does the idea of Self assume
greater prominence. It is indeed this
theme, again and again repeated, that
forms the burden of one side—the
least pleasant—of the parallel, am
is responsible in great measure fo
that final want of balance that bring
about the tragic denouement. Thi
last, however unexpected (and, fo
my own part, up to within a fe\
lines of it I had been confident of
happy ending), is indicated with
pitiless logic that constrains th
reader's unwilling belief. Sorn
might call the climax overdrawn; i
is at least seen, on retrospection, t
have been inevitable. In short,
powerful and undeniably intere-stin
little book, a copy of which woul
form an ideal Christmas or weddin
present. I should mention that i
came to me enclosed in a bin
envelope, with my banker's compl
ments.

DISCU RSIONS.
MR. MOBEKLY'S AMAZEMENT.
"I MET old MOBEHLY the other day "—it was the pale
young stockjobber who spoke—" ami he gave mo a fair
eye-opener. You know the man I mean, a pompous old
chap with a reddish face and a shiny bald head, anv
amount of eorporation and heavy gold watch-chain laid
across it. Uses long words and gets his sentences
finished. He 's no end of a terror on this line—always
keeps the guards and porters in order and writes to the
papers if the train 's late. He 's awfully down on the
youngsters, too—seems to think they 've no business to
be young, you know, and all that. He 's the fellow who
said the young men of the present day had lost all
capacity for veneration and were rapidly becoming
public dangers owing to their slang.and their habits of
extravagant dissipation. He said it at a big public
dinner, and, I tell you, it made 'em all sit up.
"Well, I saw him the other day, and I got a regular
shock. He looked as if he 'd had a puncture, all loose
and flabby, and the colour gone out of him. I saw he
wanted to tefl me something, so I made it easy for him;
looked kind and comforting and drew Kirn out. 'Look
here, MOBBRLY,' I said, 'there 's 110 one else in the
carriage. You make a clean breast of it, my boy. I
don't care how bad it is; mum 's the word with me
when a pal 's up the spout. It '11 do you good to talk a
bit; any one can see that. Murder or forgery or bigamy,
it 's all one to me. I shouldn't mind if you 'd been
carrying a banner in a Suffragette procession or spouting
against the police in Trafalgar Square.'
"What with one joke or another I got him to talk at
last, but it took a long time. At first he just stared over
my head and kept saying 'They took me away.' He
said it over and over again in a very indignant way till
I couldn't stand it any more. I told him I 'd stop the
train and have the guard in if he didn't get on with it.
'Who took you away? ' I said, 'and why did they take
you? Why should anybody want to take a harmless old
buffer like you?' This sort of stirred him up and he
gave me the story.
"He said it all happened when he was in his smoking-
room after dinner one day a week or so back. He was
just thinking of lighting up one of his best Cabanas
when somebody got hold of his hair—he hasn't got any
on top, you know; only tufts and fringes at the sides
and back—and pulled like winking, and when he tried
to shout he couldn't. Then he looked round and found
he wasn't in his smoking-room at all, but in a garden
behind a clump of trees with a couple of little boys in
knickerbockers. One of the nippers had got a bit of
cane, and the other had rolled up a piece of brown paper'
find they VI set 'em alight, and there they were puffing
away like niad. They didn't seem to see MOHKRLY,
which was lucky, for he 's a tiger on boys smoking—gave
his own youngster an awful gruelling a short time back
for bagging cigarettes—and he couldn't call out or do
anything: just had to look on and see the little beggars
blowing it out like chimneys. They grinned at first,
and seemed to like it, but soon they got green, and—
well, you know how that sort of thing always ends.
"But the worst of it was, MOBERLY said, that he was
sure he VI ssen those two boys before, but he couldn't
make out where. They were ordinary boys, with dirty
hands and all that, but he knew he 'd met 'em some-
where. Then one of the boys turned round and
MOBERLY saw a patch on the seat of his knickers and he
remembered he 'd once had a patch like that himself,
and then he got another tug on the hair and they took
him away again.
"This time, he said, they took him to a funny
old ramshackle room, and he recognised it as his
own room in All Saints' College, Cambridge. But
it couldn't really be that, he said, because it 's been
pulled down. Anyhow, there were a lot of under-
graduates there, sitting round a table, and they were
going at one another to drink bumpers about something.
One of 'em was a tidy young chap with any amount of
crispy curls on his head, and ho was standing up and
making a speech, and chucking nuts at the other chaps
and laughing; and at last lie upped with a tumbler of
fizz and tossed the whole of it off. MOBEULY said it was
the most shameful thing he ever saw. It wasn't their
own money, ho said, but that of their poor parent:;.
Then they got noisier and noisier, and at last a queer
old woman wilh a bonnet on her head came rushing in
and said the Junior Dean, or something of that sort,
was outside, and then the whole thing just faded away,
and they gave him another tug and he was back >"n his
own smoking-room.
"It didn't seem much of a story, did it? But it had
given him the knock and no mistake. The trouble was
that he VI once had a patch on his knickers like the
little boy's patch; and when he was at Cambridge, lie
was always called 'Curls.' Still, I can't believe old
MOBERLY ever smoked a bit of brown paper or drank a
bumper of fizz. Anyhow, it 's a queer world, and it 's
a. good thing we 're not all like MOHERLY."
IN A TRANSITIVE SENSE.
SCORNING the savour of my humble grill,
I entered where the flower of London dines,
And ordered sumptuous meats and luscious wines,
And swallowed, like a duke, my lordly fill:
So did I purr contentedly, but still
Found room to taste the peaches and the pines,
And then, reflecting that I VI cast my lines
In pleasant places, waited .for the bill.
It was the chiefest waiter of the lot
Who deigned to hand it me without a blush;
I read it, gasped, and counted out the cash,
Then swiftly in one agonising flash
I realised what CIIIUSTABEL does not—

BARON MARSCHALL vox BIERER-
STKIN, the German Ambassador at
Constantinople, has complained to
the Porte of an article in the Kalrm,
the Turkish Punch, disparaging the
German Emperor, and has demanded
that legal proceedings be instituted
against the editor. How fortunate
that the, English Kalctn has been uni-
formly respectful to His Imperial
Majesty!
* *
The natives, we read, observed the
third anniversary of the partition of
Bengal as a day of mourning, discard-
ing their clothes. The dusky races
have, of course, a peculiar advantage
in the matter of mourning, which
is so expensive over here. They
simply doff their clothes, and there
they are.
V
Mr. GRAYSON has made it clear
that he does not intend to apologise,
and this means that the House of
Commons will be deprived of his ser-
vices for the rest of the Session.
Mr. GBAYSOX considers, however,
that the punishment is no more
severe than the House deserves.
The latest rumour about the
ELKINS-ABRUZZI affair is that the
lady's father has consented to the
match subject to the royal bride-
groom's agreeing to change his name
to the Duke of ELKINS.
* *
A curious feature of the Statistics
as to Old Age Pensions issued last
week is the enormous number of
applicants from Ireland. This is said
to be due to the fact that in the
Distressful Country one becomes old
more-quickly than in other parts of
the British Isles.
* *
*
Mention of Old Age Pensions re-
minds us that the kindly editor of
a certain comic paper is said to have
returned an ancient and much re-
spected joke to a contributor the
other day with a polite note and a
P.O. for five shillings.
V
Mr. HALDANE has stated that the
average annual cost of a cavalryman is
£61 17s. 2(7., and of an infantryman
£57 Gs. 4d. Now that the capitalised
value of our soldiers can be- reckoned,
many little servant-girls have already
started saving up to buy one as a
keep-sake.
"I do not want the public tc
think that the British Army is goinj3
down," said our War Minister at
Caterham. It certainly seems to ex-
perience some difficulty in keeping
up, to judge by what happened tc
our Airship and our Aeroplane.
The directors of the Theatre Royal,
Drury Lane, announce in theii
annual report a profit of £20,651 ioi
the past year. £10,000 of this has
been put to reserve, and it is hoped
that they will be able with this sum
to lay down a better lot of pheasants
for next year's warm corner.
* *
The managers of the Waldorf-
| Astoria Hotel, New York, have set
! apart a suite of rooms for use as an
i emergency hospital. It is thought
that this will attract many wealthy
diners who have hitherto been afraid
to eat too much.
* *
Last week an accused man boasted
tn the magistrate that when he was
in prison he wrote 158 poems. A
saddening feature of our police courts
is the number of individuals they
reveal who appear to be dead to all
sense of shame.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
E.VTB1CTED FROM THE DlARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday,
October' 19th.—One hundred and
fifteen questions on the printed paper.
Of the first fourteen exactly one-half
stand in name of "MAGXALL'S
QUESTIONS " ASHLEY. That only half
the story. In no conceivable circum-
stances touching any topic under the
sun does M. Q. accept Minister's
reply as payment in full. Always
puts supplementary interrogation,
sometimes two or more.
During Mr. GULLY'S Speakership
this little diversion would have
boen impossible. Amiable in itself
it is a little disheartening to the rest
of six hundred and seventy Mem-
bers who also want to know a thing
or two, and, coming low down on the
list; find Question time is over before
their name is called on. Mr. Low-
THEW'S predecessor in the chair took
the view that, in accordance with
Standing Orders, a Member desiring to
cross-examine a Minister must give
due notice. Of course occasion may
arise when supplementary question is
necessary, at least excusable. Con-
stant habit of putting such questions
is an evasion of the Standing Order,
which occasionally leads to heated
discussion and angry scenes.
This afternoon, for example, de-
bate extending over several minutes
was permitted consequent on ques-
tion addressed to Postmaster-General
relative to telephone service. At a
quarter to four, when process of
enquiry was cut short by what in
debate on Licensing Dill is known as
the time limit, whilst at least one
hundred and fifteen questions had
been put and answered, nearly one-
half of those framed in accordance
with Standing Orders and printed on
paper wore not reached.
Effect of this irregularity on elderly
gentleman in Strangers' Gallery de-
plorable. Sat mute during opening
stage of Committee on Children's
Charter, deliberating over the Mother
of Parliament's methods of doing
business. House cleared for division.
Members strolling back to places.
Could bear the strain no longer.
"Gentlemen," he observed, rising
to his feet, flinging back a mane of
unkempt hair, and gently waving a
bundle of paper held in his hand,'
"I have here a petition which I have
presented to the PKIME MINISTER,
and," he continued, beaming geni-
ally on the crowd of upturned faces,
"I should like you to read it."

ised to be a long and interesting

continue, the attendant seated at
top of gangway stairs was upon
him. SAKK tells me that recent
incidents in the House have led to
institution of now exercise for the
Messengers. It is known as the
hop-step-skip movement. Prizes are
given to the Messenger who from
any given quarter, whether at the
doorway or in Strangers' Gallery,
can with greatest swiftness and surest
precision execute the movement so
as to descend exactly within grasp of
any stranger, male or female, pre-
suming to usurp privileges of Mem-
bers who have exclusive right to
address the Chair.

was collared simultaneously with

purchase of land thereabout, and the
erection of costly buildings for War
Office purposes were taboo. In ST.
JOHN BRODRICK'S day, with ST.
MICFIAEL AND ALL AXGELS Chan-
cellor of Exchequer, it was the
Liberals who wanted to know all
about expenditure of public money
in this quarter. A great deal hap-
pened since then. Incidents remem-
bered only by old Members, of whom
few leaven present House. So
WALTER LONO comes up fresh and
early with mitrailleuse discharge of
Questions.
"Hit high or hit low, I cannot
please you," moaned NAPOLEON
BONAPARTE HALDANE, giving impa-
tient touch to Imperial curl on his
massive brow. "I am blamed at
one moment for not going fast
enough to complete efficient training
of Territorial forces, and when I
move I am pulled up."
It was here GOULDIXG interposed.
"Is the right lion, gentleman
aware," he asked in voice that only
half controlled a sob, "that great
distress exists among aged agricul-
tural labourers who have lost their
avocation by reason of this purchase
and are. at the present time in
want?"
Here was X. B. HALDANE'S oppor-
tunity. Dashed in with the quick-
ness and force that flashed under the
sun at Austerlitz.
"The hon. Member," he said, " is
a little mixed. The project has not
yet been carried out."
This rather a nasty one for the
gushing Goi'LniNG. Members sitting
near him, moved by his lightly-
touched but vivid picture of aged
agriculturists in smock-frocks (prob-
ably carrying crooks), seated by the
roadside looking with dimmed eyes
on their cottages levelled, their
holdings seized by a ruthless War
Minister, were led into backing him
up with angry cheer directed at
Treasury Bench. Now it turned out
that War Office was not yet in pos-
session of land, and that GOULDING'S
touching picture was a work of fancy.
Incident led to marked coolness be-
tween hon. Member and his friends,
which lias not yet thawed.

Of course the Labour Members

at Sandringham, and really isn't a
bit better than they. Taken'together,
these constitute an unpardonable sin.
House generally recognises in pro-
posals a level-headed businesslike
scheme, in which the tax-payer
suffers minimum of exaction, and
the honest workman is freed from
degradation of eleemosynary aid. He
gives a day's labour and receives a

THE NATION'S HONGS.
The Evening News gives the fol-
lowing extract from a coming panto-
mime-song, which, according to a
Mr. LESTER BARRETT, will be the par-
ticular rage of the coming season :—
"Oli! Oh! Antonio. He's gone away,
Left me aloni'-i-o, all on my own-i-o.
I want to meet him and his new sweetheart,
Then up will go Antonio and his ice-cream
cart."
Mr. LESTER BARRETT is described
as "an expert in the popular song,
and himself responsible for more
verses of the Antonio description than
he cares to recall."
A very proper reticence.
What a high part in our literary
education is played by such national
songs is made clear by a publisher's
announcement of Mr. CLARENCE
HOOK'S London Hide-Lights. Mr.
EDWARD ARNOLD puts forth his
author's claims as follows: "He ha:;
found secrets of London hotels, he has
pierced the problem of London traffic,
lie has been to queer boxing-contests,
and he has been present at the birth
of popular song."
In view of the brilliant promise
held out by Oh ! oh ! Antonio, we con-
gratulate Mr. CLARENCE ROOK very
heartily on his obstetrical experi-
ences.

similar to that of Miss FLossIE

a few of those present in court were
beginning to lose interest, a sensa-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
The rest of Miss MARCHPANE'S
evidence was in the nature of an
anti-climax, but PORTIA elicited the
facts that she hadn't been in
Trafalgar Square the week before,
but was coming to the Albert Hall
next Thursday. Also that her

Portia's mother. Well—but I

*****
When the Court adjourned two
facts had become abundantly clear.
One, that women ought to have the.
vote; and the other, that their exclu-
sion from the Bar was an incalculable
loss to that profession. A. A. M.
THE BOY AND HIS PARENTS.
A BOY'S manner towards his
parents should be condescending and
even friendly; but it is a mistaken
kindness to admit them to too much
familiarity.
He should, as far as convenient,
adopt approximately the hours ap-
pointed by his parents for meals.
He will easily realise the advan-
tage of having a parent at table, ns
a butt or foil.
He may always safely assume that
his parents' views are out of date.
In any case he should guard
against allowing it to be imagined
that any intelligent idea, accidentally
propounded by them, had not pre-
viously occurred to him.
He is not called upon to notice anv
attempts at humour ventured upon
by either of them.
t It should always be borne in
mind that they are subject to the
disadvantage of having spent their
early years without his guidance and
example.
It may be safely asserted that in
no case can a boy's good qualities be
attributable to his parents or other-
wise than to himself.
At the same time he should give
them the credit of having originally
contributed, in a modest degree, to
the fortunate circumstance of his
having come into existence.
A parent's errors may proceed from
the head, from the heart, or from
both, while a boy is not liable to
error; and allowance should be made
accordingly.
Parents must not wonder if their
boy feels unable to recognise them at
school or at college.

He. "JUST GOING OUT FOR A I.1TTI.E FRESH All!, 11V UK Ml."
,S/(C. "A SI.UIIIT DRAUGHT, YOf MF.AN, I SUPPOSE?"
A boy should never despair of im-
proving his parents.
He should permit them to express an

PUNCH,' OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
[OCTOBER 28, 1908.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
JAMES McNEiLL WHISTLER'S capricious and gusty life
has a perfectly ordered and fitting celebration in the
two distinguished volumes which Mr. and Mrs. PENNELL
have prepared, and Mr. HEINEMANN, so long one
of the Master's friends, has just published. One is
reminded by them of the final and serene mooring in
a quiet haven of a delicate and exuberant racing
schooner after a stormy voyage. All WHISTLER is here,
save his colour, but it is like WORDSWORTH'S definition
of poetry—emotion recollected in tranquillity.
For the moment I can think of no artist who by his
biographer has been so honoured; everything is sump-
tuous about the work, and though possibly the verdict
of posterity may be a little less kind than that of
Mr. and Mrs. PENNELL and other
contributors to The Life of
James 'McNcill Whistler, who
were under the Master's per-
sonal spell and arc disinclined
to admit sun-spots, without the
data supplied by this book no
verdict of posterity will have
any value. I could personally
have wished that some of the
more heated passages in the life
of this great artist and not so
great man had been recorded
more impartially, for I think
that the history would have
gained thereby; but Mr. PEN-
KELL is himself hardly less a
fighter than his hero, and one
cannot have everything. More-
over, considering how heinous
the biographers must think the
Philistine attitude of Punch to
the Butterfly now and again, and
of Punch's editor, TOM TAVLOK,
during and after the famous
farthing libel suit, Whistler v.
Euskin, it must be admitted
that they are not unkind. Of
Du MATJRIKH there are pleasant
glimpses in the work, until the
incident of Joe Siblcy in the
first draft of Trilby put an end to them. The book is
unambiguously written, but the style is not the style of
the Master himself, and there is a certain recklessness
with regard to the comma which gets upon the nerves.
The illustrations have been chosen with perfect taste
and a fine generosity.
There is a breezy promise about The Reminiscences
of J,ady liandolpli Churchill (ARNOLD) conveyed in the
Preface. Under Providence, as she devoutly acknow-
ledges, she has met many of the most distinguished people
of her generation. "Why should I not," she asks,
"record all that I can about them?" "I have done so,"
she answers; "but there may be some to whom these
reminiscences will be interesting chiefly in virtue of what
is left unsaid." It cannot be denied that in her resolu-
tion to tell all that she can, Lady RANDOLPH is led into
the mistake of loading her book with some blocks of
trivial passages. One or two might have been left out
under more serious ground of objection.. There is, for

Slie. "You 'LL CATCH IT, YOU DWEFFUL uov!"
lie. "THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW, Miss CI.EVKB. MA'S OUT

COMMONS."
example, the story of the bustle supposed to play " God
Save the Queen." Its humour and taste smack a little
of the servants' hall. But these are casual blemishes.
A keenly-observant eye, a retentive memory and a
lively pen combine to make a volume that will be
popular at the libraries. Wherever the narrative
touches the fascinating personality of Lord RANDOLPH—•
a proportion of the whole disappointingly small—it
instantly becomes interesting. Among the many welK
known people who figure in her pages, Lady RANDOLPH
herself is unconsciously revealed.
The Man Who Lived (HEINEMANN), by BERYL TUCKER,
has not been happily named, for it is as a study of a
woman—and of her only—that the book is noteworthy.
The hero, Sidney Hawe, in spite of a consciousness of
intense vitality, wasted most of his time with common-
place people, and is really neither a lively nor a lovable
: .creature. When, however, Miss
Courtfield, during a strenuous
denouncement of his past,
allowed her complexion to be-
come in turn sallow, dull red,
almost purple, greenish and
grey, I felt sincerely sorry for
him. Face to face with this
curious colour - scheme, Have
could only contrive to loot-
bluish, mottled and livid, so lie
was—if I may express it thus—-
two down at the turn. In
the circumstances he can
scarcely be blamed for biting
his knuckles, although to have
shut his eyes would have been
a simpler and less painful way
of acknowledging defeat. The
book would indeed be weari-
some if it were not redeemed
from insignificance by one very
well - drawn character. P/o
Hamlyn's struggle to win love
and to get away from, the
vacuous life which she could
not delude herself into thinking
satisfactory is so finely told that
I wish the man whom ehe
eventually won had been more
worth the winning.
In The Borderland (CONSTABLE) ROBERT HALIFAX
takes us back among those draggled fringes of the Near
East (London) with which he has already proved him-
self familiar in The Drums of Fate. His dialogue is apt
to be elliptical, and there are traces of affectation in his
narrative style. But we grow simpler as we grow older—
according to THACKERAY—and meanwhile there is the
right stuff in his work. He comes very near to the heart
of things in his treatment of the sordid life of our mean
streets in the mass, and in one individual case, that of
Amber /^ou.he paints with fine economy of line and colour
a portrait which makes a curiously moving appeal. From
influences that threaten to brutalise her the girl is saved
by a great passion, on which the seal of sacrifice is set.
He is less successful with the lady who wanted the
Hoxton missioner for herself. But much is to be for-
given the author for the sake of the true romance he
creates from material that promises so little of
glamour.

IT is apparently still uncertain

A Bill has been introduced into the
French Chamber of Deputies to
abrogate the clause of the Civil Code

In the debate on Unem-

that the Government had
given permission for 10,000
reservists to go to the Col-

plained that this would not add to
the difficulties of mobilisation in the
event of war. In fact the fewer the
reservists the easier they will be to
mobilise, of course.
As it has been found that work-
men's tickets were being used by all

Company has determined in future
to issue such tickets to bond-fide

[NOVEMBER 4, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVAJtf.
THE GREAT MISUNDERSTOOD.
ANOTHER OPEN LETTER TO H.I.M. THE GERMAN KAISER.
DEAR SIRE,—We 've all been reading that little brochure
about you called The Indiscretion of William. All of
us, that is, except the Under-Secretary for Foreign
Affairs. EDWARD GREY told the clerks he wasn't to be
allowed to see it; he 's too new to his work. That 's
why he couldn't answer a question on the subject in the
House last Wednesday.
You've heard about it, of course? It was in The
Daily Telegraph. The author chose The Daily Tele-
graph because he knew how you love sending wires to
everybody. If there 'd been an Hourly Telegraph, he "d
have put it in that.
They say it 's really and truly founded on fact. If
they hadn't said so, I should never have believed that
part where you complain that the mass of the German
nation doesn't approve of your being BO fond of us.
Do you know, I always thought of you quite differently.
I thought that you only had to lift your finger and
every German fell flat on his face and said " Hochl ";
and if they didn't, especially if they were editors, they
went straight off to jail.
I can't think where I picked up this idea of your
omnipotence, unless it was from yourself. You see,
you so often talk about the Almighty as agreeing with
what you do and say and think, that I suppose I must
have got confused.
And now it turns out that you 're just a leader of a
small minority, like our Mr. BALFOVH. And no House
of Lords at your back!
In the circumstances, do you think you were quite
wise to talk so freely about the object of all these
Dreadnoughts that you 're pushing on with so fast?
1'oit may think that they 're designed for the protection
of German mercantile "horizons"; but the greal
majority of your people is under the impression thai
they 're meant for us. You don't suppose that all these
poor devils would let themselves be bled to pay for a
ridiculously fat fleet if they thought it was just intended
to look after the interests of German merchants abroad
Everyone knows these gentlemen are safe enough anc
doing nicely under the flag of Britain or America or any
other country but their own. If you go on drumming
it into our heads that your superb fleet isn't meant to
down ours, one of these days your people will see thai
they 've been fooled, and refuse to build any more
Navy.
There 's one of your own pet Pan-German papers
The Daily Round-vieir, already saying some appallingly
frank things about you. As soon as it read The India
crction of William, it went and wrote the following plaii
words: "Away with all hope of final stability in ou
policy." I wonder you let the Editor go on living
But I forgot: you're in a minority; and minorities
don't count.
By the way, there was one of your perorations which
broke down very badly. It began all right, but tailec
off just anyhow. It was where you were showing hov
nobly you behaved to us during our bad time in th
Boer War, when the others came and asked you to take
a hand in their game of " humiliating us in the dust.'
This is how it went: "What was my reply'.' I sak
that, so far from Germany joining in any concerto
European action to bring about England's downfall,"—
here, of course, I thought you were going on to sa;
that you were ready to defend our poor desolate islanc
with your last drop of blood; that only over your lifeles
>ody, damaged beyond recognition, should they, etc.
And this is what you are made to say instead:—
'Germany would always keep aloof from politics that
would bring her into complications with a Sea-power like
England." It rather looks as if you didn't think the
;ame quite good enough. If I were you, I should have
his put right in the Second Edition.
I think it was most awfully sweet of you making that
A-ar-map for Lord ROBERTS. If we had only teen told
about it earlier! But, you see, we got your KRUOEE
elegram (which we didn't care for) fixed in our minds,
and we never heard of the map until the other day
and I 'm afraid we shall always remember the telegram
>est. On the other hand, your own people were very
jleased with the telegram, and now they 're quite cross
about the map. And I expect they '11 remember the
map best. Anyhow, it makes it very difficult foi
posterity to discover which side you were really on
and I 'm very glad that I shall not be asked to have
anything to do with delivering "the serenely impartia
verdict of history.''
Still, you mustn't "lose patience." I want you to
»o steadily on saying just what occurs to you. Life
is not so amusing, even with Suffragettes trailing
chunks of grille behind them, that we could afford to
miss the diversions you provide. And we don't really
dislike you any more than we dislike these other
humorists. Only of course we have to take them
seriously when they begin playing about with the
Unemployed. And so with you. You see, both your
Army and your old friend FRANZ-JOSEF'S have been oul
of employment for thirty or forty years, and I can'i
remember that your Navy has ever had a real job to do
And here 's the winter coming on, and hard weather
foretold in the Balkans.
I trust you will take this letter in the genial spirit in
which it is composed. I 'm sure your heart is in the
right place. It 's simply your head that causes me
anxiety.
Accept, in conclusion, my affectionate regards, and
believe me, dear Sire, to be
Very respectfully your

HOME-MADE STATISTICS.
OUR imaginative arithmetician — in short, our
statistician—has again been at work, and sends us the
following interesting figures about the great Franco-
British Exhibition which closed on Saturday last: —
9,725,862 people have said " It would take more than
a week to see it properly."
It was the expressed opinion of ."),227,043 visitors that
LYONS must be making a pot of money out of it.
100,000 miles have been covered by the bath-chairs,
and they have carried 1,401,617 stone, or 8,760 tons 17
stone. The man who wheeled the odd 17 stone about is
still in the hospital.
Parley voo frongcy '' has been said in jest by
3,942,113 persons, from Oldham, East Ham, Tooting,
Cincinnati and other places.
An aggregate of 54,750 working days has been wasted
in waiting for admission to tea, the Scenic llailway, the
Flip-flap, and other duties and amusements.
"But you should see it lit up at night!" has been
said by 4,622,187 people.
"Has this all got to be pulled down again, then?"
has been asked by 2,432,982 females and 1,922,707
males. Of the former 300,221, and of the latter, 26,440
have added, " What a shame!"
7,443,264 people called it the Exhibition.
2,324,166 people called it the Franco-British Ex-
hibition.
1,248 people called it the White City.
The straps in the Twopenny Tube had to be renewed
every six weeks. Thirty-four miles of leather strap were
thus consumed, for which the skins of 600 horses of the
London General Omnibus and the Road Car Companies
were required.
The Flip-flap has absorbed 1,900 gallons of oil, a quan-
tity equal to the amount of beer drunk in the same
period by 13 average British working-men, according to
the latest Local Government Board figures.
The Golden Dome has been mentioned 243,275 times
in The Daily Mail and its allied publications and 7
times in other papers. These latter went to press before
the mishap could be rectified.

GRATITUDE.
ONE morning Mr. Postman stopped;
He gave two sounding knocks
And automatically dropped
A letter in my box.
It bore a whiff of prime cigars
Within my humble attic;
Twas from the god who rules the
stars—•
The stars that are dramatic.
My heart beat fast. The god had
read
Some lines of mine in Punch;
He wanted some new songs, he said,
So would I come to lunch?
With eager pen I inked the seams
That glistened white and shabby,
And, filled with fond ecstatic dreams,
I cried, "ROMANO'S, cabby!"
The ^od, for all his awful might,
W/as gentle as a dove;
He smiled on mo and bade me write
A- verse for LOTTIE LOVE.
I wrote it. 'Twas an extra verse
For LOTTIE'S favourite ditty.
It struck me as extremely terse,
Intensely sly and witty.
Within my darkened box I sat,
My throat one choking lump,
My pulses going pit-a-pat,
My stifled heart thump-thump.
Each nerve was strained, each muscle
tense—
I thought I should go dotty
The while I waited in suspense
The coming on of LOTTIE.
At length she came. Gods! who can
tell
The turmoil that was mine
When LOTTIE'S voice began to swell
Upon my foremost line?
I closed my eyes; my brain whizzed
round;
I listened, white and quaking,
But 1 could scarcely hear a sound
My organs were not making.
It was the crisis of my fate.
I wildly dared to hope
If this goes down, the golden gate
Of Paradise will ope.
I shall be numbered with the stare,
Lunch daily at ROMANO'S,
And drive about in motor-cars
With ravishing sopranos.
LOTTIE had ceased. I held my
breath
Awaiting what might fall.
A silence, as it were, of death
Descended over all.
Still silence—still! Each nerve felt
raw,
I listened half hysteric;
And then I heard a loud guffaw,
Hilarious, Homeric.
One man had seen my point, one
soul
Had fathomed my intent,
And in his stall was fain to roll
Convulsed with merriment.
His face, alas, I never saw;
I cannot hope to know him;
But when I think of that guffaw
My frozen heart begins to thaw,
[ long to follow Nature's law
And pay the debt I owe him.
LARGE TYPE FOR ALL.
A HUGE demonstration, convened
by Sir H. H. Ho WORTH and Mr.
ALGERNON ASIITON, assembled in the
Albert Hall on Saturday last to pro-
test .against the arbitrary and capri-
cious manner in which the distinc-
tion of big type is conferred on those
who write letters to Tlic Times. The
boxes were occupied entirely by peers
and bishops; the amphitheatre and
area by M.P.'s, baronets, knights
and members of the Victorian.Order,
while the upper tiers were filled by
hundreds of "Constant Readers,"
"Old Subscribers," "Members of
The Times Book Club," "Verb.
Saps.," "Experto Credes," "Audi
Alteram Partems," and "Pater-
familiasses," all in their best clothes.
Sir H. H. Ho WORTH, opening the
proceedings in a mammoth speech
of which we can give only the barest
skeleton, said that he could not
remember the time when he did not
want to write to the premier daily
paper of the metropolis. Modestly
disclaiming his right to preside over
so vast a meeting, he pointed out
that in the last forty years he
had contributed several thousand
columns to the correspondence
columns of The Times, which, if paid
for at the rate of a penny a line,
would have brought him in enough
to have enabled him to have come
to the rescue during the paper's
recent crisis. In the old days, he
went on, all correspondents were
placed on a typographical equality.
Then the practice 'of preferential
treatment crept in, at first only to a
very small extent, and in the case of
distinguished pseudonyms, but now it
had become so general and at the
same time so neglectful of intrinsic
merit as to call for public protest. His
motto was, " Large type for ever."
Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER said that the
size of the type was immaterial.
What they really wanted was Simpli-
fied Spelling. (Cries of " Order.")
Mr. BERNARD SHAW, who was
greeted with faint hoots, said that
as a Socialist he was all in favour of
uniformity. But pending the advent
of the Millennium he could not see
why The Times should depart from
its present practice, which sought to
establish a harmony between the
type and the momentary importance
of the writer. Some people thought
in capitals—his friend Mr. HALL
CAINE, for example — and it was
obvious that small "caps" would
not fit swelled heads. On the other
aand, if Sir H. H. HOWORTH'S letters
bad always been set up in long
primer, the paper would have had to
oe permanently enlarged, and good-
ness knew it was big enough now.
Lord ROBERT CECIL said that the
question was one which touched him
nearly. His younger brother, Lord
HUGH CECIL, so long as he sat in the
House, was printed in small type.
But since he had lost his seat he was
printed in large type, while he (Lord
ROBERT), though an M.P. and aK.C.,
had not yet emerged from the obscu-
rity of small type. Was this fair?
he asked.
At this stage in the proceedings
Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON sat down to
the piano and gave a masterly ren-
dering of his " Long Primer Polka,"
composed expressly for the occasion.
Sir W. S. GILBERT protested
against his letters being put into
smaller type than a rhapsody on a
new dance. Only last week he sent
The Times a carefully-reasoned pro-
test against the Hertfordshire police,
and to his amazement he had to
take a microscope to read it. No
type, he held, was too large for the
letter.
Mr. A. KIPLING COMMON and Mr. J.
LANDFEAR LUCAS, speaking in unison,
agreed with the last speaker that
serious letters deserved more atten-
tion than reports of the gambols of a
Canadian gymnosophist.
At this point the Chairman put to
the meeting the resolution that all
correspondents of The Times whose
letters w'ere worth printing deserved
equal typographical treatment. With
only two or three dissentients this was
carried.
On Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER again
rising to press the claims of Simpli-
fied Spelling the meeting broke up in
some disorder.
"Their gallant opponents made a fierce
onslaught on the Fort William uprights, which
fell by a piece of really good work, half time
finding both sides equal."—Oban Times.
As the gallant opponents were
handymen from H.M.S. Diamond,
no doubt they put the uprights ship-
shape during the interval.

SCANDALOUS ELECTIONEERING INCIDENT.
BASE THICK PLAYED OS A TEMPERANCE ORATOR BY A LICENSED VICTUALLER.
THE PURPLE PROVINCES.
BEING eager to test, the truth of
the remarkable statements in The
Daily Mail as to the refinement and
luxury which have lately come upon
certain of the English provincial
towns, Mr. Punch despatched one of
his myrmidons on a mission of in-
vestigation. His report is extremely
interesting, bearing out the testimony
of The Daily Moil's discoverer and
establishing for ever the right of the
provinces no longer to be stigmatised
by the word " provincial."
London of course remains the
ideal of comfortable civilization, with
its many hotels—one for every in-
habitant—its clean streets, its refined
music-halls, its intellectual drama,
its orderly system of traffic, and its
pure, sweet atmosphere; but the
provinces must no longer be sneezed
at, the reason being very largely, no
doubt, the new gospel of recreation
and comfort as taught by the Demo-
cratic Press and the humanising work
of the rnotor-car, carrying hungry and
refined Londoners to distant places,
intent upon good food and plenty of
it and a little amusement at night.
The result is a complete renovation
of the hotels and music-halls, which
are now little temples of ease, in-
viting the provincials, who hitherto
amassed their money without
thought of culture, to spend it freely
on pleasure.
In Manchester, he writes, I found
not only electric light but the tele-
phone. There is at least one theatre,
for I went to it, and saw a perform-
ance not inferior in intelligence to
that which I witnessed only last week
in our own Gaiety. It was one of
SHAW'S plays, and the audience
seemed to take the points very much
as the author intended. I went also
to a music-hall, which compared
favourably with our own Middle-
sex. The shops are quite good, but
there is a hopeless provincialism in
the accent of the people. The cotton
mills in the neighbourhood are far
superior to any I have seen in or
about London. The local news-
sheets seemed to me to have enter-
prise; but I was pained to learn that
none of them had assured Turkey of
their friendship and support.
Birmingham, he writes, is by nc
means devoid of the machinery o
civilization; but I must confess tc
acute disappointment now and then
It has, for example, no Twopenny
Tube; and, asking at a chop-house
for some caviare, I was met wit!

A PRESENT FOR THE CHILDREN.
SCENE—The Library. Time, 6.45 P.M. He is smoking
and reading a paper. She is examining a cardboard
box about four indies square by six inches in
height. Everything is quiet and peaceful.
He (looking iip). What 's that you 've got hold of?
Slic. It 's a box.
He. Anything else?
She. No, just a box. But of course there 's some-
thing inside it.
He. Why "of course"?
She. Well, boxes usually have things in them. This
one came 'from Boston this morning from MARY HALE.
She writes (takes up letter and reads): "I am sending
the children a Japanese puzzle which is all the rage
here. Everybody has gone mad about it, and you can't
go anywhere without finding it. I hope it will amuse
the children during the long evenings. What do you

here. Things get so dreadfully spoilt in the nursery.
He. What is it? Let's have a look at it. (She
hands over the box, which he examines.) What's this?
(Reads.) "The Putmewright Puzzle. One hundred-
and-twenty-five pieces. The Musicians. Kobayashi."
(Reflectively) Yes, it sounds Japanese right enough.

8he. But, of course, you were a very brilliant boy.
He. I was. Let's turn it out and have a go at it.
[They clear a table and turn the contents of the box
out in a confused heap of little wboden slabs,
of irregular conformation, and having one side plain
and the other coloured.
She. Looks easy enough, doesn't it?
He (doubtfully). Well, they all fit together, you know,
and make a picture. (He spreads the heap out.)
There 's no difficulty. (He picks up a piece.) There 's
i bit of a foot on this one. You 've only got to find the
)ther bit. (He begins to search.)
She. You 've got a hundred-and-twenty-four pieces to
;hoose from. Take time; go steady. Here's another
;oot. No, it 's a hand, or (inspecting carefully) it might
)e a piece of face. You never know with the Japanese.
Here, I 've got a bit of sky; it 's light blue. That must
;o on the top.
He. The foot must go at the bottom.
She. Don't you be too sure. These Japanese musi-
ians often stand on their heads when they play. (Takes
mother piece.) Here 's the top of a roof. That's in
he middle anyhow, somewhere between the sky and the
oot, whichever way up he 's standing. There—now
ve 've got three pieces in their proper place.
[They become more and more absorbed in their work.
He. You 're always taking the piece I want. I 've
;ot a head and a big straw hat all but finished and
rou 've done nothing yet.
She. If you 'd only leave me alone for a minute I *d

He. How do you know it's a background?
She. Well, it looks like a background; can't be any-
thing else.
He. I think it 's a dress.
She. And I No, that won't fit. (She rattles
feverishly through the loose pieces.) Give me your
straw hat. (Seizes it.) Now, do you see? It's not a
straw hat; it's an umbrella.
He. Sold again. It doesn't fit. Hand it back. (He
seises it.) I '11 lay a thousand it 'B a hat.
[A knock is heard at tlte door, and two little girls conic
dancing into the room.
He. Now children, don't make a noise. Your mother
and I are very busy. (To Her.) That 's no good.
You 're trying to put a hand into the top of a tree.
She. It isn't a hand; it 's a bird sitting on a branch.
(To the little girls.) Don't crowd round the table, dears;
go and sit on the sofa and read.
1st Little Girl. But we want to play with Aunt
MARY'S game. You said we might.
She. Yes, darling, some other day. To-morrow, per-
haps. Daddy and I are trying to put it right for you
now.
2nd Little Girl. But why shouldn't we play with it?
It's our game. Aunt MARY gived it to us.
He (stonily). If this sort of thing goes on we shall
never finish.
She (to the children). Hun away now, darlings. You
shall have your game to-morrow.
The Little Girls (together). You 're both very cross
and cruel.
[They leave the room indignantly in tears.
He (looking guiltily at Her). Let 's call them back and
give them the blessed thing.
She (determined). Never. I 've just got his sash
fixed in, and I simply couldn't bear to give it up now.
[They proceed u-ith varying success. Suddenly a gong
sounds.
He. Good heavens! That's dinner and we haven't
even washed our hands.
She. Only a minute more. I 've got his nose, but
the top of his head 's gone. It must have dropped on
the floor.
[They both go down on their hands and knees to look
for it, and in this position the butler, entering to
announce dinner, finds them a moment later.
The Butler. Dinner is quite ready, Ma'am.
He. Yes, yes. Go away; we shall be in in a minute.
[Left struggling.]
Mr. HUBERT MORGAN-BROWNE, instinctively hitting
upon the delicate and tactful thing to do, writes to
Mrs. HERBERT GLADSTONE as follows: "... I make
bold to ask you two questions:
(1) How would you like to be stripped and searched
by prison wardresses? and
(2) What would you think of some other woman's
husband, who, having it in his power to prevent, per-
mitted you to undergo this indignity, although he knew
you to be a prisoner, not for a crime committed, but at
the bidding of intense political convictions?"
In case Mr. HUBERT MORGAN-BROWNE forgot to en-
close the usual stamped addressed envelope, Mr. Punch
makes bold to answer these questions for Mrs. GLAD-
STONE.
(1) Not at all. (2) Nothing.

MIGHTY ATOMS.
LITTLE ALMA GOGOL, aged eight,
made her London debut at the Em-
press Hall last Friday afternoon, and
proved by her singing of Caro name,
Una vocc and Di dnnti palpiti, as
well as other selections in Russian,
Czech, and the Sandjak dialect of
Novi-Bazar, that she is fully entitled
to her proud appellation of "The
Miniature MKLBA." Her voice is
by no means altogether unpleasant,
though somewhat weedy in the upper
register, but her frocks and her self-
possession are quite unique, and
when, at the conclusion of her most
ambitious effort, an indiscreet ad-
mirer presented her with a life-sized
doll she declined the offering with a
gravity that was truly impressive.
The wonderful infant Welsh con-
tialto, GLADYS AP-JENKINS, created
a furore at Steinhammer Hall last
Saturday evening. Her most re-
markable effort was in the famous
song In Cellar Cool, in which she
more than once descended to the
low E, thereby fully justifying her
sobriquet of " The Buttlet," given in
graceful acknowledgment of the pro-
found talent of our foremost British
contralto. "The Buttlet " is at pre-
sent only nine and a half, but she
is nearly five feet high, and at her
present rate of growth there is a
very reasonable prospect of her
attaining to, if not eclipsing, the
stature of her exalted exemplar and
namesake. The quality of her voice
can honestly be declared to be not
absolutely repulsive, and, if protected
from overstrain in the next ten
years, may quite possibly remain en-
durable by amateurs who judge of
the merits of a performance solely by
the vigour of the puff preliminary.
A charming effect was produced
by little GEMMA SPAGHETTI—the in-
fant TETRAZZINI—at the recital given
by her at St. James's Hall on Wed-
nesday last. This wonderful child,
whose voice is of quite astonishing
shrillness, sang a number of Wiegcn-
lieder while lying in her own cradle,
and at the close of the concert was
wheeled off the platform in an alu
minium perincubator.
The latest Wunjcrkind of the
pianistic world, little BENXO SCHLUM
BERGER, or "The Pocket PADER-
F.WSKI," as he is called by his
enthusiastic admirers, presented
bewitching appearance at the Albert
Hall last Friday afternoon, when
the whole of the vast auditorium
was crowded with a most fashion-
able and infatuated audience.

kniokerbocker suit, with a huge
Limerick lace collar and lavender

sinian archimandrite. Although his
touch and execution are not yet
equal to those of M. PADEREWSKI, in
capillary attraction he is already far
superior to that eminent virtuoso,
and, unless his scalp is subjected to
undue strain by the somewhat exact-
ing method of coiffure which he has
adopted, his artistic future should
be both bright and prosperous.
A pleasant variety was introduced
into the programme by songs from his
sister MIRIAM, a charming child whose
expressive minandcries more than
compensate for her faulty intonation
and incapacity to keep time.

House of Commons, Monday,
October 26th.—It is not for nothing
Captain CRAIG figures in the Parlia-
mentary record as representing Down-
East. In the United States, to speak
of a man as a Down-Easter is to
intimate opinion that, if you want
to get the better of him, you will
have to be up very early in the
morning. The Captain to-day justi-
fied his topographical association.
Has entered into competition with
MAGNALL'S QUESTIONS ASHLEY for
the prize of champion querist. A
neck - and - neck race. Sometimes
M. Q. is two or three ahead; next
night the defeated but undaunted
Captain makes a spurt, equalling,
oven exceeding, his rival's record.
This afternoon MAGNALL'S QUES-
TIONS did one of those little things
which show how the passion for
racing on any field loosens the moral
fibre. Wanted to know about some
small detail of Army administration;
really forget what it was. Instead
of submitting hi? point in form of
single enquiry, he split it up, placing
two questions on printed paper. This
would give him opportunity of put-
ting a couple of supplementary ques-
tions, running up his night's score
by four. That old soldier N. B.
HALDANE not easily taken in.
"I will," he blandly said when
M. Q. put forward the right leg (so
to speak) of his enquiry, "answer
both the hon. gentleman's questions
at the same time."
Thus M. Q. was able to put only
one supplementary question, losing
a unit from the total on which he
had confidently counted.
During momentary subsidence of
M. Q. the captious CKAIG, roughly
dragging the gentle LULU to the front,
gave him—in a Parliamentary sense
of course—a preliminary box on the
ear and sternly enquired "If he
could state why the national flag was
not flown over the National Portrait
Gallery on Trafalgar Day?"
It turned out that the written
question was handed in at the table
Q day before the anniversary. This
made matters a little mixed. The
tense was all wrong.
"Intelligent anticipation," the
wise LULU called it.
MAGNALL'S QUESTIONS has entered
a protest against the query being
credited to CRAIG when at end of the
week the score between them is
made up. CRAIG means to insist on
profiting by the advantage gained by
shrewd prevision.

long for discussion. PREMIER meets
objection by moving to suspend
eleven o'clock rule. That would add
some hours to opportunity. Opposi-
tion object. Challenge division,
which, being taken, diminishes by a
quarter of an hour the time whose
undue brevity is lamented.
House of Lords, Tuesday.—Lord
LAMINGTON has dreamed a dream.
Interpretation thereof he expounded
to-night in ear of listening lords.
Has been considering vexed question
of public-house licensing now occupy-
ing attention of Commons. Believes
difficulty may be met by radical alter-
ation of the British system. At pre-
sent public-houses are places where
men go to drink. But man cannot
(or should not) live by drink alone.
Why not munch a mouthful with
his glass of "something short" or
long?
When visiting United States
LAMINGTON made himself familiar
with hospitality of the New York
liquor saloon proprietor. Well he
knows that table at end of spa-
cious bar, whereon is set the big
bowl of clam soup, flanked by the
round of cold beef warranted to turn
the edge of any knife; on the other
side, the highly-xsoloured cheese with
the chisel and hammer conveniently
contingent, instruments old practi-
tioners recognise as most efficient
for quarry-work. On payment being
made for a glass of foaming beer,
five cents, participation in this whole-
some meal is free to the hungry
customer.
LAMINGTON does not go so far ns to
recommend introduction to London
of the American institution known
as the Free Lunch. But he thinks
we might well lighten the darkness
of the British public - house by
adaptation of Continental customs
In his mind's eye, Horatio, he sees
transformed the Coach and Horses
that desirable Woolwich property
recently, at the psychological mo
ment, transferred from War Office
proprietorship to the hands of a pri
vate trader. Beer shall be freely
sold as heretofore, nor shall whiskey
nor gin be banned. But in convc
nient contiguity shall be rangec
plates of seductive sandwiches, pyra
mids of mutton pies, odorous friec
fish, bread and cheese galore. Whei
the customer has not only drunk bu
eaten, he shall be led forth by trin
maiden or white-aproned garcon —
these- are mere details to be settlec
in Committee — on to a grass-plot
where he will find bowls and skittle
at his disposal.
Lord LAMINGTON stands firm to
he principle that underlies his Bill.
One pot one pie. If the customer
[esires more drink, he must pur-
chase another mutton - pie or its
equivalent.
Beer inevitably associated with
skittles. But the grass-plot is of
;ourse for summertime. In wet or
oggy weather, not wholly unfamiliar
n England, there will be a snug par-
cur where the customer, sated with
wholesomely mixed refreshment, may
ninister to the intellectual side of
lis nature by indulgence in a game
of dominoes or draughts.

the land the genial glow of public

facilities?"
CARLISLE, looking into the matter
declared that the facilities were al
for the publican, who would be able
unhampered by magisterial supervi
sion, to make unlimited extension o
his premises. FITZMAURICE'S military
eye, trained at the Foreign Office
ecognised in the movement "a
econnaissance in force designed to
amper the Government Licensing
Bill." After long debate the cau-
ious LANSDOWNE recommended with-
[rawal of the motion, and so the
.ream dissolved.

Compensation was provided by levy

bute towards the expenses."
"Nor did I know that he con-
tributed, to any large extent, to the
revenue derived from it," continued
CARSON with increased deference.
Though Chairman of the Rotary
Machine Company, WHITE could not
turn round quickly enough to parry
this unexpected thrust. He sat
dumb, and carries with him into the
void of the week-end the mystery of
his meaning.

them with a little excitement, so I
ran up a tree after a bird. Just as I
had managed to catch it my mistress
came out of the house, took away
the bird, and whipped me for my
"dreadful cruelty." I didn't mind
the whipping, but I. had no breakfast
that day, which was terrible.
That afternoon I was sitting with
my mistress when a box was brought
in addressed to her. Out of the box
came a hat, and then I understood
why I wasn't to catch the birds. All
round the hat were dead birds! Of-
course she wanted the birds in the
garden for herself. She kept on say-
ing, "Isn't it sweet 1" but don't
you think it 's rather greedy of her
to w-ant to keep them all to herself?
Don't you think we ought to go
shares? Yours, etc.,
PERSIAN.
P.S.—I have just been to sleep
and had the most awful nightmare.
I dreamed that my mistress was
wearing me on her hat! I am so
frightened I don't know what to do.
I heard my mistress say only yester-
day that white hats were to be worn
this winter! Would you put in a
paragraph saying if you have ever
seen ladies with white Persian kit-
tens on their hats?
P.S. 2.—Do you want a kitten in
Bouverie Street? I could sit under
the cartoon-table and pick up a few
unconsidered trifles. Fond of dogs.
The latest cigarette put upon the
market by a Manchester firm is
called "The Swan-Song." An
ominous name! Does nobody ever
come back for more?

UNEMPLOYEDS.
DURING the collation of cold snaps
provided by bleak October's chilly
blast the chamber window sweet of
my bed-sitting room having become
too infernally round a peg in its
square hole, a 'carpenter was in-
veigled to attend and cir-
cumvent the draughts. He
was distinguished from his
fellows by a cravat of the
poppy's glowing hue and
cry, and his hat, which lay-
in desuetude upon the stairs
when I eased my descent to
breakfast, was of unan-
nealed felt, of the form
called by the vulgar a Trilby,
alternatively an Elpine.
As I met him, after grub-
bing my inwards, I said
"Good morning,", with my
customary hail-fellow-neck-
and-neck affability. He
replied "Banzai!" Here,
I thought, is a hind of no
common herd. Remember-
ing that soft soap facilitates
revolutions per minute of the
sorriest mare, I told him
that I had seldom heard such
good Japanese since I arrived
in English soil, salving my
face with the reflection that,
as I had heard none other
attempt on our language, this
was a pretty safe miss in
the balky harbour of shep-
herd's-pltiid tarradiddles.
This man told me he had
studied Japan, just as he had
studied ancient Greece, and
believed that a black man—
or a tan, for that matter—
was as good as a white, and
better. This seemed fairly
fcur- halves and shove - halfpence."
I assured him of my pleasure to be
a party in mind, body and estate to
his pearly drops, and he gave me a
card, upon which (most ingeniously
with a small piece of soldering-lead)
he inscribed the name and address
of the Refreshing Rooms under
whose spreading threshold his Society
met.

reasonable amount of tin, he said,
that JOHN BURNS had not put hand
to vice for nigh on twenty years of
grace. No man could be a friend of
the working-man who was not him-
self a working-man—toiling, rejoic-
ing, and occasionally piping the optic
of compassion with other working-
men.
There were at the present moment,
P.M., he continued, a most uncom-
fortable number of labourers in
London who had no work to whet
their whistles upon. If the
great JOHN BURNS was the
iriend of the working-man,
why could not he give them
something better than work
on new asylums? Putting
a premium on balmy-crump-
ettedness, he called it. In
his opinion BURNS might
talk for ten years, with his
two thousand, and his
library, and his what-not,
but what he found when he
looked around his points of
the compass was hundreds
of thousands of men out ot
work—North,. South, East,
and West, as the crow flies.
Here he sat down, amid the
rented shouts of the auditors.
At this junction I begged
to be allowed to declaim a
few periods. Making an
actuarial allowance for mne-
monic side-slips, I spoke as
follows:
"My dear Sirs! I came
to listen to your words and
drink a non - combatant
'small black,' not to ad-
dress you. But I feel
obliged to tilt a lancet-point

handed largesse, and I responded
that he was a man of heart and oak,
which seemed to please his nibs,
adding that I could see he had an eye
on things.
Yes, he admitted, he knew a hole
in a pair of steps—in fact, some of
his associates dubbined his vanity
by calling him the Socrates of
Stockwell. If I took any interest
in "tho things what matter," he
added, I should come down and hear
him hold the fort that evening at a
concourse of brother working-men
whom he had impanelled "in the
hopes of giving them a soul above

hat-in-mouth apology for recounting

we ordered "small blacks." These
proved to be little mugs of a liquid

gested respectively coffee and the
waters of Lethia.

are so many labourers unable to

degrees of Fahrenheit.

having achieved the erectitude of
his own piles of rhinos, Mr. CAR-
NEGIE never tells us how he per-
formed such working-bee prodigies
of value for money. He has lectured
and told his hearers how to save
money, but not how to beget it.
To save is humanly a bit of a job;
to create cash is a devil of a deep-sea
undertaking. To my eagle eyrie the
desideratum is that we should have
issue of an invitation to all mil-
lionaires to attend a central spot.
Then round-off and collar-up (to use
a N.-W. Territorialism) the labourers
and let them enjoy a few hours of

speaking to them as working-men in

would tip us a few staves on such a
vexed question, and tell us the
favourite for the big event.
"Mr. BURNS, whose ethics have
been so ably eviscerated by the first
speaker, is not up to much. It is
obvious as a pike-shaft that if we all
adopted the course of the sweet singer
of Battersea we should finish up
as feathered habitues of the privet-
hedge of P.C.-ishness. Counting
noses, on this hypotenuse, I can see
at one blow forty-odd working-men
each drawing from the well two
thousand quids per annum as easy
as tiddledy-winking!
"One of the brightest minds of
the century has handed out the
remark that to be truly happy, and
let who will be dyspeptic, man must
live on sixpence per diem, having
previously observed the formality of
earning said tanner.
"Supt. WELLS, of Scotland Yard,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Stuff of Learned Clerks.)
IN his latest (but surely not his last) book of dis-
tilled-water essays, At Large (SMITH, ELDER), Mr. A. C.
BENSON complains of the critics who accused him of
writing platitudes. "If they arc platitudes," he says,
"why do we not find more people practising them?
What I mean by a platitude is a truth so obvious that
it is devoid of inspiration, and has become one of the
things that everyone does so instinctively that' no
reminder of them is necessary." Well, I am afraid my
definition of the word is different from Mr. BENSON'S.
If at the end of a long discourse he were to say: "And
perhaps the essence of the whole matter is this—that to
be good is to be happy," I should remark that he was
talking platitude. Yet I have friends who are quite good
without being really very happy.
Again, I go to bed late and I get up
late, and frequently I remind myself
of the folly of it, but I should rightly
be irritated with a man who observed
solemnly: "I sometimes think that
the secret of the matter is this: that
only they are truly healthy who
retire to rest early at night and rise
again early on the morrow; and it
may even be that only thus shall
they acquire honourable wealth and
wisdom also." These things are
platitudes because they repeat (with
an air of wisdom) what everybody
has already thought for himself;
not necessarily what he has already
practised. Writing of his life at
the country cottage which inspired
these essays, Mr. BENSON says:
"There is no stir, no eagerness, no
brisk interchange of thought about
it." Well, that describes his book
exactly; and as it is now my turn to
relate the obvious to Mr. BENSON
let me assure him that the intellec-
tual masses do not like interchange
of thought—but that they do like
reading in beautiful language (and
print) actually the very things that
they have always felt for themselves.

was a boarder in a Bloomsbury pension his life was no:
exactly saturated with the joic dc vivrc, but it was jus1
endurable. He thought, poor innocent, that he knew
the worst. But Fate and Mr. THURSTON had their eye
on him. First they pretended to be dreadfully sorry
for him, and took him away from Bloomsbury to a
sweet little cottage in Berkshire. Then they let hin
fall in love with the daughter of the girl who had been
his sweetheart in the days of long ago, and then, hav
ing bamboozled him into thinking that he was short h
going to be left a large fortune, they allowed him to

him with love, ihey proceeded to chastise him with
scorpions. The promised legacy was snatched from his
expectant grasp, and, on discovering
that his affianced bride had only
accepted him out of womanly pity,
he resigned her to a contemporary oi
her own, and took the next train
back to Bloomsbury. It is all very
simple and pretty and depressing,

graceful and pleasant style, it doesn't

many novels, too, your Puritan is a
spiritless sort of fellow who has a
poor time both on the battle-field

C. BAILEY, however, is much less
conventional in Colonel Stoic
(HUTCHINSON). Though his hero
does fight for KING CHARLES, he is
really a free-lance with leanings to
the other side, and only espouses the
loyalist cause for the sake of his lacly, who, as a matter
of fact, turns out to be a hussy and runs away with his
friend Colonel lioyston. That puts the plot of the story
(including both Colonels) into a nutshell. For the rest
the book goes at a rare canter, and there is never a
moment of boredom while Mr. BAILEY is in the saddle,
in spite of the dead-weight of solid history he is carrying.
His verbal activity, too, is amazing, and the dazzling
thrusts and parries of his well-assorted characters extend
right away down to the conversation of cooks and
lackeys. "Marriage is a sacrament: you may also
consider it a sauce"; and again, "I fear nothing but

DISCU RSIONS.
SANDV BILL.
I DID not meet Sandy Bill until long afterwards, and
then I had no genuine assurance that what I saw was
really Sandy Bill. You shall hear about that later.
In the meantime I may say that he was supposed to
be a cat, not of the sub-fuse hue generally associated
with the dress proper to be worn in the Cambridge
Senate House, but of a super-fuse or bright ginger
colour. He was alleged to be of gigantic size and
immitigable ferocity, with a strange exotic taste for
buttered eggs. All this we gathered from Mrs. Huo-
GIXS, the bedmaker. Nobody else had seen him, and
even Mrs. HUGGINS had only—if I may use her own
words—" ketcht u flash of 'iin" as he flew past her
or over her head.
Sandy Bill was one of Mrs. HUGGINS'S favourite
legends. According to her he inhabited by preference
the roof covering that special part of Trinity College,
Cambridge, in which lay the scene of her duties and
labours. She had never known him, she said, as a
kitten, and we were permitted to infer that such heroic
cats never had a kittenhood, but sprang fully clawed
and toothed from the head of Pasht. To be sure it was
not Mrs. HUGGINS who suggested Pasht. The name of
that goddess was mentioned to her by NOKMAN, the
classical scholar, who had dabbled in Egyptian mytho-
logy. All that Mrs. HUGGINS observed in reply was
this:—"I dessay there may 'ave bin a cat called by
that name, but I never 'card of 'er, and if there 'd been
a Pash about the College I should have known it."
NORMAN thereupon apologised and withdrew Pasht.
I ought to add that, except in regard to buttered eggs.
Sandy Bill was no marauder. So ferocious an animal
would have scorned the proverbial pilferings of the con-
venient cat of lodging-houses. He drank no milk, he
abstracted no butter. Alone, or in the company of a
decreasing number of rats and mice, his daily sustenance,
he inhabited the roof. According to the fond memory
of Mrs. HUGGINS he was noted for a strong dislike of
Junior Deans and Tutors. On the arrival of any speci-
men of this terrible and detested tribe within the range
of his eye or his nose he mewed, so Mrs. HUGGINS told
us, with a pathetic persistence; but, as NORMAN said,
we didn't run to Junior Deans on our staircase, and
thus we never had an opportunity of putting Sandy
Bill to the test. In Mrs. HUGGINS'S presence, how-
ever, we did not dare to express any violent disbelief
in his existence. Could any Greek have taxed HOMER
with mendacity when Agamemnon was mentioned?
Mrs. HUGGIXS was the HOMER of Sandy Bill.
Certainly she had her moments of triumph. Once,
on a morning when she was stirring a preparation of
buttered eggs over the fire in ASKEW'S rooms, there had
been a roar and a scurry as some monstrous beast came
down the chimney with a bang, seized the luscious
yellow mixture and vanished away, leaving Mrs. HUG-
GINS prostrate and eggless on the hearthrug, where
ASKEW found her still tightly grasping her spoon. There
had been buttered eggs; there were none when ASKEW
came in. The obvious and only inference was Sandy
Bill. Again on a certain evening when she was look-
ing for a threepenny-bit at the bottom of the staircase
by the aid of a tallow candle, she had seen two eyes
glaring down at her from the top stair, had fainted with
her candle in her hand, and had found neither candle
nor candlestick when she came to herself. Sandy Bill,
of course. I nmember the evening, because the new
waiter in hall had, in offering the soups, asked NORMAN
if he preferred "thick 'are or garden 'are "—plainly a
much better expression than your silly Frenchified
jardiniere.
The greatest triumph, however, happened in connec-
tion with the black Persian cat which ASKEW had
brought from home in his third October term. A gentlo
amiable animal she was, but addicted to nocturnal
wandering. One night she went to bed amongst
ASKEW'S underwear in the bottom drawer of his chest -
of-drawers, and in the morning she had taken power
(and used it) to add five ginger-coloured kittens to the
population. This was conclusive. Mrs. HUGGINS did

pleasure as she led us to the drawer and showed us
Sandy Bill's kittens.
Many years afterwards, when I brought my wife to
Cambridge, we called on Mrs. Huggins at her private
residence and had a cup of tea. I talked of old days
and of Sandy Bill. “You’re settin' on 'im, Sir,” said
Mrs. Huggins. I rose with some alacrity from my
arm-chair and saw that its seat was spread with an
ancient yellow skin. Mrs. HuggiNs explained that she
had found him after his lamented death, and had at first
intended to have her hero stuffed. She had, however,
decided eventually, in favour of skinning him, and there
he was. This was all I ever saw of Sandy Bill.
THE IMPULSE.
[“The Poet' must make his readers believe that he writes from an
irresistible inward impulse.”—-The Times.]
WHEN you're sitting in the twilight and there comes an ||
inclination
To commence a sheet of foolscap with the magic
words “To Jane,”
May we view the lines that follow as the natural
emanation
Of an all-compelling moment flushed with Passion and
with Pain?
And arrive at the conclusion
That your amorous effusion
Represents a fervid impulse of the Heart and of the
Brain?
Was it, then, some ardent whisper full of Springtime
and of Courting -
That in sudden inspiration drew your stylo from its
sheath 2
And when Pegasus was mounted—did he canter off
cavorting -
Up the slopes of steep Parnassus with the bit between
his teeth? -
Was—in short—your lyric burden
- - Born of moonrise, and its guerdon
Just your gentle JANE's approval, and a fair-sized
laurel wreath 2
It is yours, my young Apollo, to uphold this pleasant
fancy,
For we mustn't know the sonnet cost you several
hours of stress,
And might just as well have gone to either LILIAN or
NANCY
Had they shown the same facilities for rhythmical
address;
Mustn't know the ode to JINNY
Was inspired by—say—a guinea
To be wrung with tribulation from a stony-hearted

“Staff-Captain N. was the hero of a night adventure during the week.
On his way to the Christopher Street ferry he witnessed the horrible
sight of a woman being felled with a blackjack. The usual crowd
gathered, but seemed paralyzed with fear. The Staff-Captain, for-
getting everything but that a precious life was in danger, ran to the
Charles Street Police Station.”—The War Cry (New York).
We can picture the heroic scene—with the staff-captain
in the foreground fairly sprinting. . .

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHAKIVAKI.
THE PINK SMOKING-ROOM.
0.15 P.M.—"Yes, it's'a beautiful
day," I said, "and I think the KAISEK
made a mistake, but what do you
mean by 'disabilities of sex':' On
Hie other hand, I should bo inclined
to hack DUNCAN and MAYO."
"I didn't say anything,"- said
Miss MIDDLETON, looking up from her
book.
"I beg your pardon. I thought
you coughed.1'
Miss MlBDLETON returned to her
book, and there was a breathless
silence for a quarter of an hour.
"If you would only let me, get a
word in," I said, "I would point
out y«nr mistake. \Vhen you argue
that"
"I didn't say anything," said Miss
MIDDLETON, looking up from her book.
"I 'in sony. I could have sworn
you sighed."
Miss MIDDLETON returned to her
book, and there was another breath-
less silence for a quarter of an hour.
Then I could bear it no longer. I
stood up mid shouted "Help!" at
the top of my voice.
Miss MIDDLETON gave a loud
scream.
"It's all right," I said sooth-
ingly. "There 's no danger. Please
keep your seat. The captain"
"Oh, what did you I quite
felt You did frighten me."
"I thought you 'd be wanting
assistance. You 've just found the
body, haven't you?"
She picked up the book, and read
the title with a smile.
"I 'm very sorry," she said.
"I have been awfully rude, haven't
I'! But it 's so exciting. Let 's
read it together, if you like. I '11
just explain where I 've got to."
10.0.—It is called The Mystcrtj of
the. Pink Smoking-room, Wakened
by loud cries at midnight, James the
butler rushed to the door of Miss
Primrose's room, where a terrible
struggle was proceeding, and rattled
at tho handle. He was quickly fol-
lowed by Professor Matthews (the
father), George, who was staying in
the house, and Eliza the cook.
There were no other servants. When
at last they broke the door down,
they found Miss Primrose on the
floor with a bullet-wound in the fore-
head, and no sign of the assassin.
"That 's where I 'm up to now,"
said Miss MIDDLETON. "Come on.
Who do you suspect?"
"I suspect James. He was there
first. It's always a good rule to sus-
pect tho man who wns there first."
But the detective proved—•—"
"Is there a detective?"
"Yes, he 's just arrived. I 'm go-
ing to suspect liim. He 's the last
person you would suspect naturally,
isn't Jie? so.he 's bound to be the
one. That's the best way to do it."
"That 's all right so far as it goes,
but it doesn't go fur enough. Jame:
is the first person you 'd suspect:
therefore he 's the last person to have
done it. Therefore he probably did
it,"
"Hadn't we better read a bit
more? Perhaps James has an alibi.''
"If James is the man I take him
for, he has at least two alibis; but
lie probably did it all the same.
Come on."
10.15.—We don't know what to
make of it. James hasn't had an
alibi yet, but he has been arrested,
which is just as good.
"They 'd never arrest the' real
assassin on page 58," I explained to
Miss MIDDLETON. "If they did I
should insist on having my money
back—I mean your money back."
"What about my detective? He
hasn't arrested himself yet."
"Don't be so absurd. I know it
isn't him."
"So do I. That 's what makes me
think it is."
"But I can tell you why it can't
be. The detective never knows at
the very beginning who did it, does
he?"'
"Of course not, or there wouldn't
be a story."
"Well, then, if he 'd done it him-
self he would have known."
10.30.—James is still under arrest.
Primrose's injury is not mortal,
and she has been sent to a hospital
at Cromer. But her mind is a
blank. A new man, liogers, has
just arrived from Australia. Miss
MIDDLKTON and I suspected him at
once, but I said it first. At least a
do/en witnesses can prove that he
was on board at the time, which looks
rather suspicious. I don't quite see
how he 's going to explain that away.
10.45.—We have decided to tabu-
late our theories. Here they are.: —
(a) Primrose was shot through the
keyhole by liogers. (My contribu-
tion.)
(b) Primrose was a Christian
Scientist, and only thought she 'd
been shot. (Miss MIDDLETON'S con-
tribution.)
(c) Primrose shot herself. (My
contribution.} .
(d) And then swallowed the re-
volver—don't be so ridiculous. (Miss
MIDDLETON'S contribution.)
(e) Primrose fell out of bed on to
.a bullet. (Mian MIDDLETON'S contri-
bution. She says she lias often th'iie
this lieiself.)
11.0.—We are going to work on a
new line. The author has promised
that somebody we know is going to
confess on the last page, so we have
made a list of all the-people who have
been mentioned so far. In addition to
those I have named already (most of
whom have been arrested), we have:
Daphne (Primrose's twin sister.
But the author has practically sworn
that Daphne didn't do it.) . •/"
John (her brother, who died in
India).
CLINTON FYLES (the author of the
book).
E. N. H. (to whom he has dedi-
cated it); and
SHAKSPEARE (" As Shakspeare
says "—p. 37).
"It 's simply got to be one of
those, according to FYLES," I told
Miss MlDDLETON.
"He doesn't actually say so. All
he says is that little did one of them
know that their terrible secret was
about to be revealed. Of course if it
wasn't they wouldn't. I believe it's
hypnotism or spiritualism or some-
thing like that. That will be abso-
lutely rotten."
"He 's simply having us on, j'ou
know, that's what it is."
"Well, anyhow," said Miss MID-
DLETON, "we 've suspected every-
body once, so we 're bound to be
right. Turn over, quick."
11.10.—Primrose's body has just
been found in the pink smoking-
room. She has been shot again, I
suppose. This is very unsettling.
Particularly as we all thought she
was at Cromer.
11.21.—Primrose is alive! But
very weak. She is going to tell us
what happened. Quick!
11.30.—She has told us!
*****
'' Scored off! " said Miss MIDDLE-
TON. "Just fancy! I should like
to pretend that I suspected this all
along, but I didn't really."
"You told me," I said coldly,
"that Primrose was shot and went
to Cromer. Now it turns out to have
been Daphne all the time."
"Don't be angry," pleaded Miss
MIDDLETON. "James thought so too
and he has known them much longer
than I have. All the same I don't
think twins are quite fair."
"And even then Primrose only shot
her by accident. No, I 'm not angry
but if ever I meet CLINTON FY&ES
face to face,. I '11"
"Do!" said Miss MIDDLETON.
"And 1 '11 promise to suspect you
last." A. A. M.

MARJORIK AND MURIEL. — Few
people know, dear Mu and MARJIE,
how easily the humble mutton-chop
may be transformed into a dainty
dish fit to " set before a king." The
following is one wuy, specially suit-
able for girls like yourselves who
occupy a small flat. Having re-
moved all the feathers, hold the
chop with a pair of pincers in the
flame of a spirit-lamp for a quarter
of an hour. (If the pincers get hot
take your curling-tongs.) Have your
wash-basin handy, and should the
chop catch alight dash it smartly
into the water, remove it, and let it
drip on a piece of toast, then frizzle

tfUrnt bits and ci'unlfele them Be-
tween thumb and finger on to the
wet toast. Catch hold of chop bone
firmly in one hand, grasp toast in
other, and take alternate bites. I
feel sure you will enjoy this.
SADIE.—You were in too much
hurry over the shrimp cake; you
ought to fry the shrimps before you
put them in, not fry the whole thing.
As this is a little difficult perhaps for
a beginner, try your hand at making
a mushroom custard. For the motif,
take a quart of freshly-caught mush-
rcoms. The best are always found
in the shallow pools when the tidej
is out, and as you live at the seaside;
you should have good fun getting
them yourself. You can easily dis-
tinguish them from toadstools — the
latter have no back fins. Pull off
their heads and tails and wait till
they stop jumping; then shell and
core them, dust a little violet-powder
over them, and fry till they pop.
Take each one separately and bnioh
it carefully with a clean toothbrush,
bold under tap, and mash. Serve
hot with apple-sauce and chloroform.
Some people prefer the latter fir^

is a most appetising summer drink,

juice of four potatoes, and add a
gallon of water; stir for nn hour with
a large frayed cabbage-stump (this
gives its characteristic satisfying
flavour). If your arm aches, change
hands. Shred half a Spanish onion
into the liquid and let it hum over u
slow fire until the neighbours come
in to ask if the gas is escaping; this
usually happens in twenty minutes.
Keussure them, remove from fire, put

MARGARITA.—Next time you try
making the cheese patties you should
hem the edges with fine thread.
This keeps the cheese from escaping.

HOW TO GET FED.
"CHARLES," I said, "I am in
trouble. You know always what to
do and how to do it. Advise inc."
"JAMES," ho answered briefly, " I
will."
"I am not properly fed," I said.
"For seventeen years I have seen
around mo at restaurants the
choicest food, and have never been
able to eat it."
"Teeth?" said CHARLES.
"Waiters," 1 said. "Everywhere
I go there are crowds of hateful little
men with morbid eyes, and nasty big
men with red faces and far too many
chins, feeding on the fat of the land
and their every want anticipated. I
get served with the worst and after
the longest delay."
"That should not be. It is the
waiters' duty and not the consumers'
privilege to wait."
"I have tried till remedies. 1 have
appealed to the waiter's sense of
decency, and have been treated with
unction to my face and with laughter
behind my buck, and the service has
become, if possible, worse. 1 have,
appealed to his religion, his sense of
humour, his humanity, his pocket.
Every method of defence has been in
vain.'"
"Never be defensive," said
CHARLES. "Be offensive. Come
with me and see how it is done."
*****
"Waiter! " said CHARLES; and the
waiter rushed to his i.-all who had
ambled to mine. "Why in thunder
don't you come when I call?"
"I did, Sir," said the waiter.
"Silence! " said CHARLKS. "The
heat is unbearable. Turn on the
fans and open the windows."
"But the other customers, Sir,"
said the waiter.
"Turn on all the fans and open
all the windows," interrupted
CH\RLKS; " and bo quick about it."
"I didn't find it particularly hot,"
said I to CHARLKS.
"No more did I," said CHARLES.
"But to make an impression one
must begin at th'i beginning."
"In fact/' I continued, "1
i thought it nicer aa it was at first."
"Waiter!" called CHARLES, ami
that waiter positively galloped.
"Hurry up. This draught is diR-
graceful. Turji *>B hit the fans and
^"^Suie windows."
"But, Sir, you told mo ..."
"Do as I tell you," said CHAHLKS
fiercely; and the waiter did it.
"We have reduced his proud
spirit; and now for the manager.
Let us complain of the salt."
"The salt is dry enough," said I.
"Then wet it," said CHARLES,
and dropped a little water on to it.
He made the waiter have a good
look at it, arid, the salt remaining
wet in spite of the look, sent for the
manager. After a little while a man
appeared with slightly tetter dress
clothes and a black tie;
"Go away," said CHARLES. "I
sent for the manager."
"I am the manager," said the
person.
"You are not," said CHARLES.
"You are the head waiter, and a
grossly incompetent head waiter at
that. Send me the manager." And
after a little longer interval thart
official came. His frockeoat proved
his managership.
"Are you the manager?" said
CHARLES.
"I am, Sir."
"Then you are the worst manager
in the whole wide world. Look at
this salt—the dampest, the wettest,
the soppiest mess 1 have ever seen."
"I will speak to the waiter, Sir,"
said he, and ho was on the point of
abusing that luckless man.
"What?" said CHARLKS. "You
dare to provide us with the worst
possible food in the most uncomfort-
able room in London and then try
to put me off by abusing a helpless
waiter? If it had not been for him,
I do not believe we should ever have
had any salt at all."
"Sir ..." said the manager, with
some show of fight.
"Silence!" snapped CHARLES.
"Am I to be shouted down like
this? Take this stuff away and
bring us some more, and see that
our dinner is served with some
Approach to decency and prompti-
tude."
* * * * *
"CHARLES," I said, over the most
delicious and best served dinner T
have ever known, "yon are positively
brutal."
"Not brutal," said he, " but wise.
I think the food is excellent, the
place comfortable, and the attention
faultless. llestaurants, rny dear
friend, arc run on commercial and
~-»*. nil humane considerations. It is
the business 01* &" C"t"rrr ^ *alistv
the customer, and, if the customer
starts off by being satisfied, the
caterer will take no more trouble.
In private life our waiter would be
more friendly disposed to you than
to me. But this is not private life—
this is business. To him and his
manager you are not a man to be
loved, but a number to be fed and
kept quiet and got rid of as quickly
as possible."
"But the tip? Surely that has
some weight?"
"Oh, JAMES," he said, "you
liave much to learn. The waiter
knows, as you do not, that you tip
entirely upon principles of fashion
and not upon principles of justice.
However ho treats you, he knows
you will give him as little as you
dare. Possibly you will be frightened
into increasing your tip by a proud
demeanour and a bullying manner.
Confess that you have never left a
restaurant without giving the usual
tip to a waiter who has neglected
you and very nearly insulted you all
the meal."
When we rose to go the waiter
helped us on with our coats, the
head waiter handed us our hats,
and the manager was there to wish
us good-night.
THE FLIERS.
(From our Special Correspondent at
Le Mans.)
MR. WILBUR WRIGHT yesterday
made several ascents, each time with
a passenger. Among those fortunate
gentlemen were the Bev. 11. J.
CAMPBELL, Mr. HENRY JAMES, Mr.
SIDNEY LEE, Mr. G. K. CHESTKRTOX,
Mines. MELBA and TETRAZZINI, Mr.
HENRY FARMAN and Mr. WILLIAM
ARCHER.
The llev. 11. J. CAMPUELL, who was
one of Mr. WILBUR WRIGHT'S
passengers, being in the air for some
ten minutes, remarked on descending
that he had never known anything
like it. It was superior even to his
own flights of rhetoric. The sensa-
tion could be compared with nothing
that he had ever experienced: it was
as though he, soared over the earth
without past or future—almost
without present. The only drawback
was perhaps that there was no one
to talk to, for Mr. WRIGHT dis-
couraged conversation. Asked if ho
were cold, the reverend gentleman
replied that he would no doubt ha-ve
been had he not been wearing
MINTO'S clothes to measure.
Mr. HEN^V JXMES alighted ujiofi
the earth again (terra firma, as he
expressed it) with obvious pleasure.
For a long time he remained inarltcu-
late, but was then, by those in the
immediate vicinity, understood to
say that if, by any possibility, under
whatever conditions, there should be,
however faintly adumbrated, an
invitation, nay appeal, or even if it
\\ere an entreaty, to, so to speak,
induce him once again to entrust, in a

manner of speaking, his limbs, not
to mention his other organs, to such
an infernal contrivance . . . . " and
so on.
Mr. SIDNEY LEE, who was next
honoured with an invitation to ac-
company Mr. WEIGHT, described his
experience as exhilarating in the
extreme. He said that it was like
riding on a Theban eagle, or a swan.
Hiding a turtle was nothing to it.
In an eloquent peroration Mr. LEE
vindicated the use of a high-flown
style as suitable to aviators.
Mr. CHESTERTON'S experiences
were less fortunate than those of
his friends. For a long time the
aeroplane refused to leave the
ground; and it was not until the
great critic had emptied his pockets
of books and other impedimenta that
it rose at all. It then flew slowly
round the parade ground twice and
came to earth again with a groan.
On Mr. CHESTERTON'S slipping from
it, however, it sprang into the zenith
like an indiarubber ball. Mr. CHES-
TERTON described his sensations with
vigour and vividness. It reminded
him, he said, of being in a heavenly
hansom with the blessed conscious-
ness continually present that one
would not have to pay the fare. He
looked forward to the day when he-
would be able at Haltersea to whistle
down from the skies an aeroplane to
carry him to Fleet Street, and vice
versa.
Madame MELBA and Madame
TETRAZZIM, who made successive
ascents, were equally enthusiastic in
expressing their delight. As Madame
MELBA wittily put it, "I have long
been a star, but I have never been so
near the other stars before.'' Madame
TETKAZZINI declared that the aero-
plane soared higher in altissimo when
she was on board than when Madame
MELBA was the passenger; but when
asked to adjudicate on this point
Mr. WRIGHT preserved a discreet
reticence.
Mr. HENRY FAKMAN, who obtained
his seat on the aeroplane only by dis-
guising himself as an ecstatic French
journalist and kissing Mr. WHIG:IT
very vigorously, said that he did not
think much of his experiences. In
fact he did not feel .safe for a moment.
If Mr. WRIGHT cared at any time to
come to him, he would show him
what flying really was.
Mr. WILLIAM AIU-IIKR on alighting
said that he had never spent a more
wonderful ten minutes. As he passed
swiftly and steadily through the air
he had felt like nothing so much as a
great strong bird—yet with the brain
of a man and dramatic critic. It was
that which made it so interesting.
The spelling of aeroplane might, how-
ever, lie thought, be much simplified.
The Rule 10 (d) for deciding who
wins the prize of the Dublin Univer-
sity Engineering Students' Society is
as follows:—
"They shall then lake the number of atten-
dances sit ordinary General Meetings of eacli
such speaker, multiply liy one hundred, and
divide by three times the total number of
ordinary General Meetings held during the
session, and add to the number thus obtained
his average mark for speaking multiplied bv
ten."
We have not seen Rule 10 (e), but it
probably runs: "The Chairman shall
then guess the number which the
speaker originally thought of."

LISTEN, O yc mothers, to my tale:
I am one who never had a chance,
Horn or ever science could prevail
Over pestilential ignorance.
Silent in rny cot I used to lie,
Very, very limp about the spine,
Very, very vacant in the eye,
Waiting for the touch of the divine.

Elemental impulses arose,
Troubled tho grey matter of my

Quivered to a twiddle in my toes.

Did none understand what it must

Was there no physician near to

Had they any grasp of hygiene?

For my nurses started to my side,
Wrapped me but the tighter in a

Slain by inability to sprawl.
So, by mental atrophy, I gat
Capable of penning ihis poor thing.

I MET him in a field near Sandring-

my opportunity.
"And now it hus stopped bleeding,

"If you are one of the;people .that
write for the papers I am very glad

seems all right, you know; but there
is something wrong with the papers.
Don't you think the views of some

Houses of Europe ought to be accept-
able just now, when European poli-
tics arc so much to the front?"
"Tell me what you think of Bul-

"Oh, Bulgaria is horrid to fit into

"You see," he resumed, " it isn't

I am a Crown Prince, and I shall be

take more notice of me, even if I
have grown serious. The other day
a dear old gentleman, who, Mumma
told me, was a retired diplomatist,
came to see me. So I got him away
from the others into a corner, and

sonal experiences. To hear Colonel
HALL WALKER descant on " the long
pull " was a liberal education. One
never realised before how much emo-
tion can be evoked by watching the
process. The barman takes your jug
across the counter, fills it, as nearly
as possible, precisely to limit of mea-
surement you stipulate for. Then,
breathlessly watched by you, back
goes his hand, and with supple-
mentary pull " fills up the oup," as
Mr. ASQUITII used to say before he
was Premier.
One gathers from the gallant
Colonel that there is rich opportunity,
for study of human nature in the
procedure. A shrewd observer will
as he carries away his jug, be able
to form an accurate.judgment of the
natural generosity or inborn niggard-
Hness of -the barman.'
Then th'ere was Mr. LOFTON in his
moment of confidence.
"I have been in hundreds of
public-houses in the country," he
said, instinctively wiping his lips
with a glow of pleased reminiscence,
"and have met with a very good
reception."
Whilst these flashes of human
nature are refreshing in the arid

Licensing Bill through in convenient
time for the waiting Lords. There-
fore, though for a moment the Com-
mittee regretted the interposition, it
is generally admitted the CHAIRMAN
was justified in pulling up Mr. G. A.
HARDY us he was reaching the most
thrilling-part of his narrative.
It was BAXBURY who led up to the
incident. (Question arising on pro-
posal to close pul>iic-!:":!5<-s on poll-
ing days, he testified that at recent
election at Peokham proceedings
were almost dolefully respectable.
"There were," he said, " only two
convictions for drunkenness on poll-
ing day, and the parties were two
women who did not live in the
borough." Were probably brought
in on tramear by the Liberal Agent.
It was this that called G. A.
HARDY to the front. He had, he told
the entranced Committee, visited
Peckham on polling day and found-
it "a perfect pandemonium of
drunkenness." HARDY himself seems
to have been in state of some per-
plexity, for, as he said, "in the
evening I asked five people to direct
me to a certain place." Of these
"four were drunk; the fifth, a post-
in an, di rected me."
Even the postman not above sus-
picion. In ordinary way of business

"Yes, the country is not only Bate, but, if I may use the expression, it is overwhelmingly

Business done.—Fourteenth day
in Committee on Licensing Bill.
Tuesday.—Indefinable air of un-
rest broods over House. Everyone
conscious of it; none can explain it.
Began, I think, with HICKS-BEACH'S
disclosure of things going on in the
Isle of Wight. According to him, a
party of officers from Naval War Col-
lege went the other day for a recon-
naissance of the Isle, and whom
should they find on the spot but a
number of Gorman officers engaged
in selecting a suitable place for
landing troops!
SAKK says the story reminds him
of one told by CHARLES LAMB about

tributor to The Oracle. Was paid

each. Half-a-dozen or less provided
him with n i'mner. On a particular
^inv, incidents being scarce and
dinner necessary, he sent in the
following: "Walking yesterday
morning casually down Snow Hill,
whom should we meet but Deputy
Humphreys!"
This was the end of his connection
with the paper.
About HICKS-BEACH'S story there
certainly is something of the unex-
pected turn that marks Bob Allen's
last contribution to The Oracle.
MclvKNNA says the whole thing is a
mare's-nest, a narrative of the kind
suitable for circulation among the
marines. That all very well. But
House recalls how last summer MAHK
LOCKWOOD, scouting in Epping
forest, attracted by smell of Ger-
man sausage, cleverly followed a
trail that brought him upon three
Germans lunching behind a haycock.
They said they were commercial
travellers.
MARK too old a soldier to be taken
in by stories of that kind. Seized
early opportunity of bringing matter
under notice of House, arid a few
months j^tcr chore were published
noT?S of the famous interview with
tiie KAISEK, in which his Majesty en-
deavoured to show that, so far from
harbouring evil designs against this
country, he even supplies the British
Army in the field with plans of
campaign.
Thus putting two and two to-
gether, we get a more or less con-
nected story. A.t best it does not
uplift the cloud of uneasiness alluded
to, nor does it convince HicKS-BKAcn
that all is well in the Isle of Wight.
Business done.—Clauses 21 to 35
of Licensing Bill declared carried in
Committee as fast as CHAIRMAN could
put the question.
House of Lords, Wednesday.—
"Such larks!" as, before "Great
Expectations " dawned, Pip used to
say to Joe Gargery.
Noble lords aweary of coming down
every day and finding no work to do.
This afternoon one from back bench
proposed a game. Something with a
bit of chance running through it, on
which, if any were so minded, a sov.
might be put. Bridge out of the
question; roulette needed a table;
pitch-and-toss would never do, see-
ing that in Committee on Children's
Bill it was proposed to pass clause
limiting pastime of street urchins
by prohibiting smoking cigarettes.
Happy thought. Draw lots for some-
thing. Same fun; full maximum of
chance with minimum of undesirable
detail. Cries of " Content!"
"The Contents have it," said the
LOUD CHANCELLOR.
Thereupon BLACK ROD brought in
CLERK OF THE CROWN and HANAPEB,
fortuitously in attendance without.
Reported that in the election for an
Irish Representative Peer in room ol
Lord ROSSE, deceased, Lords ASH-
TOWN and FARNHAM had received
equal number of votes.
"Bring in a glass bowl," said the
LORD CHANCELLOR, re-adjusting his
wig.
Odd how it fell out that everything
was ready. The CLERK OF THE
HOUSE produced from folds of his
gown a finger-bowl.
"Now," said the LORD CHAN-
CELLOR, entering thoroughly into
spirit of the game, "take two slips
of paper. Write Lord ASHTOWN on
one, Lord FARNHAM on tother. Twist
them so that names are hidden, and
drop 'em into bowl."
The CLERK bowed low to the Wool-
sack and followed instructions.
'' Got 'em in?" asked the LORD
CHANCELLOR., his wig awry with ex-
citsinenf. "Very well; now wait til"
I count twenty-five."
Amid hushed silence the Peers o:
Great Britain and Ireland in Parlia
ment assembled followed the slow
enumeration.

in another place. "Shn^

WILLIAM THE GREAT.
A STUDY IN THE IMMENSE.
IT is essential that the English-
speaking world as well as America
should know something of the per-
sonality of the new PRESIDENT; for he
has come, as we say, to stay, and
he may make history during office.
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT is, it is
computed, the biggest thing that
Columbus did. America is a great
country, but not even America is
too great for BIG BILL TAFT. He
overlaps it here and there: outlying
portions of his person sag into the
sea on either coast. BIG BILL TAFT
is immense. He has been gigantic
all his life. As a baby he required a
syndicate of nurses; as a boy his
gambols shook Cincinnati; as a
Sophomore he made it necessary for
new steel girders to be built into
Yale. Since then he has grown
steadily. Like all great men ho has
never stopped growing; and now the
plans of a completely new and really
commodious White House are being
drawn up, and until it is ready
the PRESIDENT-ELECT, will live in the
dome of the neighbouring Capitol.
The Americans love a personality
which lends itself to familiarity, and
BIG BILL TAFT is and will be very
popular. The very style BIG BILL is
of the essence of intimacy. BIG BILL
TAFT—could GEORGE WASHINGTON
and ABRAHAM LINCOLN have a more
desirably-named successor'.' Certain
is one thing, and that is that he will
be himself. No man will ever carry
him.
But bulk is not BIG BILL'S only
merit. He has a smile, too. TAFT'S
smile is like an aurora borealis;
TAFT'S laugh is like the gayest music
of the spheres. He has smiled and
laughed his way into the Presiden-
tial Chair. Speeches he made, it
is true, until his voice was gone—
that mighty organ dwindled to a
whisper—but he need never have said
a word. All he had to do was to
stand before the millions in Pa. and
la., Wis. and Da., and expand into
risibility.
It is a great power, this power of
genial mirth, and no one ever had
more of it than BIG BILL TAFT.
Although jovial and huge, BIG
BILL is not lethargic. On the con-
trary, lie is energetic, and the
Americans, who arc nothing if not
witty, call him "a steam-engine in
trousers." It is a long nickname
for a snappy, hustling race; but there
it is. "Under the crown of his
hat," it is written, "he carries a
little American flag "—as a talisman
and as a reminder of country and
duty.
His rise has been steady and sure;
but it was not until he led the Prin-
cess ALICE round the world that his
name became a household word. Of
that historic progress who can tell'?
Not Mr. TAFT, for he disdains author-
ship. Never since Una fared forth
with her lion have there been such
travels. The Great Pyramid has

never been quite the same since Mr.
TAFT ascended its summit; and
Egyptologists have noted a far more
genial expression on the face of the
Sphinx since that mysterious mon-
ster was saluted by his overwhelming
smile. On his landing in Cuba he
won all hearts by observing that,
though born in America, his feet
were Cubic.
His interview with the POPE is
history also. The Vatican still shows
signs of the meeting in a number of
fissures and subsidences. The HOLY
FATHER, after some hours' hard work,
succeeded in blessing the greater
portion of his visito -.
Like many other men of majestic
stature, Mr. TAFT has an infinitesi-
mal appetite. But to make up for
this abstinence he is a voracious
render. His favourite novelist, it
need hardly be added, is SARAH
GRAND; his favourite essayist is Mr.
A. C. BENSON, the author of At
Lnrne; his favourite short story. The
Dm HIS of the Fore and Taft. In
conclusion, it should be noted that,
though he occasionally plays golf,
he has an hereditary passion foi the
sport of Big-sticking.

MR. JONES'S GREAT DISCOVERY.
MR. HENRY ARTHUR JONES, in the
course of probing Life to the core,
has discovered a new World-Truth;
nnd, like a good fellow, he wouldn't
hear of keeping it to himself. He
has discovered the fact, hitherto un-
suspected, that it is -a foible of
Human Nature to make futile resolu-
tions every New Year's Day; and, in
Dolly Reforming Herself at the Hay-
rnarket, he is letting all London into
his secret. But here his generosity
stops. He might easily, in five Acts,
with two scenes apiece, have illus-
trated his point with ten similar and
consecutive New Year's Days. But
ho has only given us a couple of these
anniversaries. Still, even so, we get

as much repetition as we can do with;
and Four Acts without a change of
scene help to keep our minds from
wandering from the one idea.
The play is a slight thing, which
threatens to be tedious at times, but
is carried off by really admirable all-
round acting. It is also relieved by
some nice quiet humour in the
Second Act, and a lot of noisy fun in
the Third. The audience, when 1
was there, preferred the noisy fun, in
part because it was noisy, and in
[•art because Mr. JONES was here
dealing recognisably with the ele-
mental features of a conjugal quarrel
over milliners' bills. In this scene
Miss ETHEL IRVING played with an
almost incredible fury and abandon.
Every moment T thought that some-
thing must crack in her fragile frame-
work. Yet I had to side with the
husband; for her bills were too pre-
posterously out of proportion with a
country menage so limited that its
mistress always talked about "the
I'.pare room "; while the accommoda-
tion for beasts was smaller still, the
horse of a solitary caller having to be
sent away to the local inn to In-
put up.
The low-comedy tone of Mi:;s
ETHKL IKVINCJ'S voice and methods
was possibly no part of the author's
design, but I think it helped. She
was very clever indeed, except with
her hands when she had no particular
use for them. Miss MARGARET HAI,-
STAX was excellent as a married
woman with n taste for hysteria and
Platonics; and the author must nlone
be responsible for any farcical fen-
titres in this character which were
brought out by the fidelity of her in-
terpretation. While all the others
acted very soundly, it was the admir-
ably restrained performance of Mr.
LOWSK which, more, than anything
else, held (he play together on the
right side of the doubtful borderland
between comedy and farce.
I could wish for it a decent run,
but its attractions are not varied
enough—a bad fault in these days of
severe competition with the Halls of
Variety.
By the way, if Mr. JOXES had ever
visited a Hospital for Incurables I am
sure he would have spared us that
small joke at the expense of this class
of hopeless sufferers. Age and cus-
tom have done nothing to modify its
1'iikindliness. O. S.
MY OXYGEN TUBE.
I HAD it recharged on my way to
The 1'eeii'it office, having inhaled its
original contents as an experiment
before interviewing my landlady on
the ticklish subject of missing col-
lars. That experiment had been nn
overwhelming success, for the large-
boned and redoubtable woman who
had bullied me for the last two years
left my presence weeping silently.
I looked forward, therefore, with
calm confidence to the task before
me of making the editor of The
Pccit'it change his views about the
ultimate destination of a series of
articles I had written for his paper;
for he was a much easier person to
deal with, being, in fact, second only
to myself in irresolution of character
and moral cowardice. Bitterly in-
deed, in my previous dealings with
him, had I realized that one fiery and
menacing glance from my eye would
have made him flinch evasively, and
just one more ounce of bluff than I

was capable of would have turned
the scale of terms in my favour. It
had, in fact, always been a toss up
which of us was going to score, and
so far I had lost the toss. But the
tube of concentrated valour I carried
in my pocket would change all that,
and during the few moments in the
waiting-room I emptied the charge
and filled myself with such dogged
pluck that 1 floated on a cloud of
courage to his room.
He was seated at his desk as I
entered, and turning his flabby in-
effective face in my direction was
about to utter his usual "Good
morning, just one minute, please
—and keep me waiting while he
rang up a box office, when he
caught my eye and positively
dwindled before it.
"With reference to those articles,"
I began in cold, menacing tones;
"you say in your letter of yester-
day's date you find they are hardly
the style of thing to suit your paper.
You will, however, remember that
when I showed you the first of the
series and we discussed the lines of
the others, you distinctly commis-
sioned me to write them, and I shall
certainly hold you to that engage-
ment.""
When I began to speak I saw him
try with a pitiful effort to pull him-
self together and meet me on my own
ground, but he was not man enough.
He cowered back in his chair, his
fingers fumbled with his blue pencil,
his mouth twitched nervously, but
he elongated it into a conciliatory
smile and stammered soothingly:
"Oh, yes, yes—to be sure. Very
glad you called to talk the matter
over Now let me see Yes,
Miss BLAKE "(this, apparently,
to his lady secretary, whose voice,
however, I had not heard). "Excuse
me one moment," he said hurriedly
and disappeared in the adjoining
office. I smiled a sardonic smile,
my triumph was assured, and I had
just determined to make it guineas
instead of pounds when he returned,
looking queer and puffy and gasping
a little.
"Now about these articles," he
exclaimed harshly, with the air of a
man who has no time to waste over
trifles. "You suggested the series.
/ merely agreed they sounded prom-
ising on the lines you sketched, and
assured you they should have careful
consideration. That has been given
them, with the result that I find
they are very poor stuff indeed, not
even up to your usual standard.
Besides which they showed me that

depth of your subject, but lacked the
knowledge and insight to deal with
it. Under those circumstances, and
as there was no written agreement
between us, I have no other course
but to return them to you, and hope
you may be able to place them
elsewhere. Meanwhile," he added,
dropping his aggressive tone for one
of patronising superiority, '' you
must try and think of something
else. Always glad of ideas, you
know."
His first onslaught nonplussed me
—then as he continued, with a pang
of despair, I saw something sticking
out of his breast-pocket which ac-
counted for his momentary absence
and subsequent access of ferocity.
It was a tube of oxygen.
"Will you take these with you—
or shall I send them'.'" he said,
pointing to my articles on the desk.
I rose, all the gas gone out of me.
"I '11 take them," I said cringingly,
and slunk out of the door, leaving
him an easy winner with three inches
of oxygen to spare.
From a bookseller's catalogue: —

nition ngninst the Replie of Thomas Cart-

It looks like THOMAS'S opponent's
turn now.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. BERNARD CAPES exhibits such an animus against
the ordinary critic in The Green Parrot (SMITH, ELDKR)
that for u long time I thought the title was partly sym-
bolical, and kept wondering where they had put the
bird-seed. John Wisdom is a novelist whose imagina-
tive methods and delicacy of style have made him
unpopular with the good-for-nothing chorus of reviewer:;:
so he takes umbrage and a knapsack and flees into
North Wales together with another fugitive from oppres-
sion—a precociously intellectual boy who has run away
from his cruel step-father with 'no other luggage than
presenting copies of her book to the vampire-mothers oi

next time their birthdavs come round.
It is a very long time since Mr. KENNETH GRAUAMK
gave us a book, and now that he has done so in The
Wind in the Willotcs (METHUEN) it proves to be on
entirely different lines from those of Dream Days and
The Golden Age, though it has many pages which could
have been written only by their author. I should
describe it myself as a sort of irresponsible holiday
story in which the chief characters are woodland
animals, who are represented as enjoying most of the
advantages of civilisation -— shopping, caravanning
motoring, travelling by train, and so on—apparently 011
the titular macaw. They are discovered by a most (terms of more or less equality with the human world,

indeed. This is a great pity,
because the author is quite
at his worst, I think, in
militant dialectics, whereas
lie does the romantic busi-
ness exceedingly well, de-
scribes his scone most
attractively, and is a master
of the vivid epithet. I should
like to suggest to Mr. CAPES
that next time he feels
worried about anything lie
should take a leaf from the
book of another BERNARD and
write, a voluminous preface,
and then weigh in with his

Perhaps it is because 1 have grown old, like

people in the. book—neither Mamma, nor her three mar-

comes his wife after Mamma is dead and gone. Miss
BRODOHTON has given us, instead of a story, a clever
study in selfishness, elaborated by many of those deli-
cat-e touches of comedy-satire in which she excels. From
this point of view her book is a go<xl piece of work. For

flies at high game. The prin-

strut on the political platform
with the House of Commons
in the background. Even for
a great artist familiar with
them these are difficult con-
ditions to work into a novel.
Mr. MAXWELL is not a great
artist, and whilst his know-
ledge of the House of Com-
mons is obviously acquired
from the Strangers' Gallery.
his intimacy with political
personages and problems i-
gained from study of the
newspapers. A chapter or
two is more or less agreeably devoted to the record of a
day's doings in a madhouse, with lengthy reports of the
conversation of several patients suffering from divers
illusions.
The reproduction, at the price of six shillings, of thv
costly volumes of Tlie Letters of Queen Victoria, is
an achievement sufficient to make the year a red-letter
date in literature. There is not an event of public
interest happening within the twenty-four yean? that
form the limits of the story that is not here touched and
illuminated. The illustrations, some rare, which adorned
the first edition are reproduced. Mr. MURRAY is again the

with Tlie Time* Book Club; of itself, to those who
remember recent events, a pleasing and picturesque

MORE MAXIMS OF A MILLIONAIRE.
A PLEASANT plutocrat of Mr. Punch's acquaintance,
after perusing some of the aphorisms in Mr. CARNEGIE'S
new opus—Problems of To-day—lias been tempted
to submit a few of his own. Closely questioned as to
their originality, he writes, with his near hand on his
heart, to say that he has had no assistance in their con-
struction, not even from Lord AVEBURY or Miss MARIE
CORELLI, though he recognises that his work bears some
impress of the epigrammatic style of these two authors.
To die rich is the mark of a fool or a rogue. He that
is wise or virtuous takes care to die poor, thus eluding
the Death Duties.
Money (in the hands of others) is the root of all evil.
For their sakes, then, you will do your best to pluck it
from them.
Great riches do not necessarily confer great happiness.
It has been well said that a man with only three or four
hundred thousand a year can enjoy all the simpler Plea-
sures of Life just as well as a multi-billionaire.
Severe labour is not a punishment; it is a blessing in
disguise. That is why it is so difficult to keep people out
of prison when they have once been there.
The man who thinks of others before himself, while he
is still poor and struggling, will never grow to be a
millionaire. If, therefore, in the early stages, you are
tempted to be generous and charitable, thrust the temp-
tation from you. Once you have become rich you can
be an altruist on as large a scale as you like.
Men who have risen from extreme poverty to extreme
wealth will sometimes tell you that their hours of purest
happiness were those when they had no idea where their
next meal was to come from. Don't you believe
them.
A famous aphorist and millionaire of olden-time said
that of the making of many books there is no end.
Another famous aphorist and millionaire of our day has
said the same of libraries.
The virtuous plutocrat is proof against the shafts of
envy and malice. His breast is overlaid with a triple
coating of steel. The best kind comes from Pittsburg,
Penn.
Profit-sharing is the key to the gates of Millennium.
If you employ '25,000 workmen and are making £500,000
a year, distribute half of this among your em-
ployees. Each of them would then pocket '004 per
cent, of the profits which you yourself secure, and we
should hear no more of Socialism.
Next to profit-sharing, nothing so much encourages a
workman as to know that the money which lie is helping
his employer to amass will be spent judiciously, even
though the benefit should fall upon the inhabitants of a
hemisphere with which the workman is unacquainted.
To get wealth is still harder than to get rid of it.
Herein it differs widely from the fumes of alcohol. For
a professional inebriate has discovered the truth that it
is not the getting drunk, but the getting sober, that
causes all the inconvenience. O. S.

AND Spring came o'er the mountains, and the larch
Stood diffident in faintest green of March;
While, blood congealed beside that storm-swept stream,
You sped the " Durham Ranger," saw the gleam
Of silver 'mid the amber and the foam
Of racing waters, felt the hook strike home,
And heard above the hail-squall's furious pelt
The gillie's comment—" She wull be a kelt!"
Then Summer raised her oriflamme on high,
And through your blazing fortnight in July
You waited for the rain, where faint and thin
The river threaded seaward, clear as gin;
Deep in the red rock's gloom the salmon lay
Huddled and sullen, through each blinding day,
While you were working, still without a rise,
Through several tomes of ineffectual flies.
Came Autumn; and from off the sea the rain
Crept in to bid you welcome North again;
The mists closed down, and the beshrouded hills
Bang with the clamour of a thousand rills;
Unfishable, the turgid torrent sped
O 'er Highland cornfields still unharvested,
And day by day you watched the spate roar down
Till the last hour that took you back to Town.
And yet on Winter evenings, when you sit
In dream-fraught firelight ere the lamps are lit,
At times the. faint-heard traffic in the road

Then old wounds heal, and as the magic thrills
Your heart flies back to rivers and to hills;

D ISCU RSIONS.
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
I SEE that during the discussion of a Scotch Education
Bill in the House of Commons the other day one ol
the Members proposed that little Lowlanders and little
Highlanders should be compelled at certain times to sing
the National Anthem. This was to be a part of what, I
believe, is called the curriculum; it was to have its fixed
place in the time-table. I pause to note that the gen
tleman who suggested this innovation is an Irishman
and ti captain. Why an Irishman should have wished to
involve himself in the mazes of Scottish education I
don't quite understand. At any rate, the House
rejected the proposal and passed on quite calmly to
other matters.
With all respect to the honourable and gallant Mem-
ber, I am disposed to think that the House acted wisely.
There is a suggestion of mechanical pressure about the
plan, and I doubt if you can make children loyal (for
that, I presume, was the idea) by mechanical pressure.
You can teach them to read and write; you can even
worry them through the rule of three and similar abomi-
nations; but loyalty is a different thing, an atmosphere,
a habit of mind, a breath of nature—call it what you
will. There are no fixed rules or concise formulae. You
assume that a child's blood circulates and that his lung;;
perform their proper functions. Why not assume that
he (or she) will rejoice by nature in being English or
Scotch or Irish, and be proud of the glories of his birth
and state, taking th/>m into the substance of his being
as he takes air into his lungs V

I have, however, a greater objection to this particular
system of loyalty-study, and it is this. The child will
liave to know the words of the Anthem by heart. That
seems to me to be fatal. I don't suppose there is on
• lie face of the earth a more genuinely loyal people than
our own; but how many of us know all the words of the
National Anthem? Not one in a thousand. A few con-
cert-singers have necessarily learnt them for festal occa-
sions. Are concert-singers, then, more loyal than the
rest of us who battle our way triumphantly through the
song and make our devotion manifest without knowing
more than some twenty words or so of the whole? Cer-
tainly I don't suggest that concert-singers are, as a race,
disloyal, but their loyalty, I think, maintains itself in
spite of, not because of, their mysterious and tremen-
dous knowledge of the words of our National Anthem.
We, at any rate, who are ignorant, retain our sense of
exaltation and splendid incalculable greatness when we
sing our Anthem mostly without words. Our hearts are
filled with a glorious feeling of devotion and vague but
overmastering courage. That is because we haven't
been drilled to the business. If we had been drilled
we should have begun to dislike and to criticise; and the
truth is that both the sentiments and the literary work-
manship of the National Anthem are terribly open to
criticism.
How, for instance, is a teacher to explain to a Scotch
child the occurrence of " over us " as a rhyme for " vic-
torious"? When once you have questioned, you will be
bound to sing the words in this form :—
Send him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long In reign orious:
God save the King.
Until you can recover from this dreadful aberration, 1
defy you to mix a due proportion of reverence in your
singing of the Anthem. No, shout the music at the
top of your voice; imagine yourself girt for the moment
with all the virtues and self-sacrifices and noble tradi-
tions and spiritual yearnings of your fatherland, but
don't trouble yourself about the words. The words are
nothing, but the spirit counts.
And, by the way, we may as well remember that
while we are exalting ourselves with "God Save the
King," millions of Germans are shouting " Hcil dir im
Siegcskranx," and millions of Americans are roaring
"My country, 'tis of thee," to precisely the same tun;1.
I am content to leave the question of the origin of that
soul-stirring and grandly simple music. It seems to suit
the Germans; it certainly suits us; and the Americans
unblushingly captured it by the hands of one SMITH, and
converted it to their own national use. In the mean-
time I congratulate my little Scotch friends that they
are not to be forced to sing it, with the words, as part
of their daily lessons.

LIFE AND LETTERS.
[/H the manner oj " The Academy."]
THE literary world has been com-
paratively dull this week. The egre-
gious ASO.UITH has persevered with
his sickening and hypocritical Li-
censing Bill, in spite of what we
said lust week; and has proved
himself to be entirely in the power
of the nauseating Nonconformists,
of whom "Dr." CLIFFORD is the
dictator. "Dr." CLIFFORD, mean-
while, has been distinguishing him-
self by offering the olive - branch
(forsooth!) to the ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY, in the hope of bringing
about a compromise on the Educa-
tion question. We tell " Dr." CLIF-
FORD plainly, once and for all, that
we desire no compromise with such
as he; and, speaking for the Catholic
Church, we say unhesitatingly
that we prefer men of his kidney
as open enemies. For the rest, that
pillar of Welsh Nonconformity, the
fatuous LLOYD-GEORGE, continues to
sink in the estimation of his fellow-
men; the miserable WINSTON
CHURCHILL, whom we finally crushed
a mouth ago by references to his
American mother, is a back number;
and the unspeakable PANKHURST
troupe, being safely lodged in gaol, has
been unable to indulge in its usual
antics. The result of all this is, as we
said before, that there has not been
much doing in tho world of letters.
The Spectator, Nation, Westmin-
ster Gazette, Pall Mall Gazette,,
Daily News, Cornhill, and Fort-
nightlij Review continue, in spite of
our warnings, to print despicable
verse, and it is evident that there
is nobody on the staff of these papers
with tho remotest glimmering of
what constitutes a good poem. We
are glad to note, however, that The
Saturday Review has taken our re-
cent castigation of its poetry to
heart, and has turned over a new
leaf in this respect. We should like
to call special attention to the beau-
tiful lines entitled Autumn in its
last number. These lines were sent
first to this paper; but, though they
were of great merit, wo were coin-
polled to reject them, as they did
not come up to our standard. By
the way, a poem on a similar sub-
ject by ourself appears on the next
page.
Mr. MAX BEERBOHM (wittily called
Mr. n. M. BEERBOHM in our last
issue) has not yet apologised to us
for having dared to speak well oi
tho unspeakable PANKHURST. As a
ousequcnce, we told him last week
what we thought of his dramatic
:riticisms; and, unless his apology
s forthcoming within the next three
days, we shall be forced to tell him,
with the calm and unbiassed judg-
ment which wo have announced to
be a feature of this paper, what we
ihink of his caricatures.
An anonymous correspondent,
writing from Upper Norwood, has
pointed out that Mr. G. MEREDITH also
.8 in favour of Women's Suffrage.
Mr. G. MEREDITH cannot have been
aware that the Suffragettes have
come under our lash, at regular in-
tervals of seven days, for the last
six months. We have accordingly
written to Mr. G. MEREDITU to in-
form him of this, and are sending
copies of the letter to the head of
Mr. G. MEREDITH'S Church, the
Member for the Beigate Division,
and an impartial adviser whom we
have asked Mr. BALFOUR and the
Duke of NORFOLK to select. We shall
await Mr. G. .MEREDITH'S reply with
interest; and in the meantime we
hold over a masterly analysis of his
works by our correspondent.
Some time ago we hinted that
Mr. SPENDER was about to retire
from tho editorship of The Westmin-
ster Gazette. Once again we have
proved to be in the right; but
then we always are—as the entire
Press, all Liberals, everybody outside
the Catholic Church, Miss ALvuo
ALLAN, and Messrs. WELLS, SHAW,
CHESTERTON, BELLOC, DOBSON, and
BEERBOHM have already found to
their cost. By the way—we ask the
question as a well-informed literary
paper—who is HILAIRE BELLOC?
A correspondent from Edmonton
writes to ask us if wo object to
criticism of ourselves. Certainly
not. We give hard blows; we
frequently find it necessary to casti-
gate our fellow-journalists; and we
expect to receive hard blows in re-
turn. We welcome candid criticism,
though wo should never expect to
have any difficulty in pulping the
critics who ventured to give it. But
tho truth is that we are rarely, if
ever, made the subject of attack.
This may be because our readers
consist mainly of aspiring journalists
who have had all their contributions
rejected by that Press which we find
it necessary to castigate; but it is
much more likely to be because we
are absolutely beyond criticism.
Though, however, it is impossible
;hat we could be the subject of fair
attack, it sometl.nes happens that
we are misjudged. Only this week
we have received a letter from a
orrespoudent at Hendon who hns
entirely failed to understand us.
Fie writes: "I cannot tell you how
much I like your journal, by far
.he best paper in England to-day.
It makes me chuckle to read your
slashing thrusts at your contem-
poraries. Go on—do it again. They
want stirring up." Now we wish to
state emphatically that we do not
reprove our contemporaries with the
dea of making correspondents at
Heiidon chuckle. We do it soberly,
jceause it is our duty, and a very
painful duty. And we \vould an-
nounce here to the whole country
that, when our castigations have had
their effect, when we see a paper
genuinely trying, when we observe
a statesman or divine honestly en-
deavouring to please us, then we
shall be the first to hold out an
encouraging hand.

To revel in vicarious sport.

Tho cripples on the other side.
I tiptoe in the swaying throng
When forwards bring the ball along
And my anathemas fly thick
When hats obscure the corner-kick.
If we lay out their centre-half,
With what abandonment I laugh;
But when they serve our mail the

I bellow "FUUL!" and "PLAY THE

If toward our goal the others press,
I snarl in venomous distress;
But, hat in air, I pirouette
When our performers find the net.

And all for sixpence at the gate.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE REFORM OF OXFORD.
GREAT DEMONSTRATION.
THE recent proposals to reorganise
the system of terms at Oxford
led to the convening of a great public
meeting at the Cannon Street Hotel
last Saturday with a view to discuss
the best means of placing the Uni-
versity on a satisfactory basis. The
Editor of Tlic Daily A7cirs presided,
and amongst those present were Mr.
CHESTERTON, Mr. BELLOC, M.P., Mr.
EUSTACE MILES, Mr. PETEK KEARY,
Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER, Mr. VICTOR
GRAYSOX, and the Rev. Lord WILLIAM
CECIL.
The Editor of The Daily News in
a striking speech deplored the mis-
directed efforts of modern edu-
cationists. He noted that an
ingenious person had recently suc-
ceeded in training blue-bottles to lie
on their backs and twirl miniature
dumb-bells. What would really
interest us would be to hear the com-
ments of the blue-bottle on the whole
proceeding. (Cries of " Question! ")
All that Oxford did was to train her
"blues," who were no better than
blue-bottles. What they wanted
was to de-athleticise the Universi-
ties, to overthrow the cult of the
golden calf and the gilded youth—in
a word, to eliminate the blues and
the bloods—and the blue-bloods—
and to restore the spiritual ideals of a
strenuous humanitarianisni.
Mr. VICTOR GRAYSON, M.P., said
that the merciless and soulless
tyranny of the Oxford dons surpassed
that exercised by the Liberal majority
in the House of Commons. He
thought that something could be done
with blue and other bottles, but they
must not merely be educated, they
must be thoroughly broken-in.
Mr. CHESTERTON said he had not
been educated at Oxford. It was the
homo of lost causes, and he was an
inveterate optimist. Still he had no
wish to see so interesting a survival
of medievalism pass into the limbo
of forgotten things. The Oxford
manner deserved perpetuation, if only
as a means of exasperating the advo-
cates of hustle. There was some-
thing peculiarly attractive to him in
a College which called itself All
Souls. It sounded as if the mem-
bers were Nobodies.
Mr. PETER KEARY said there was
only one way of improving Oxford,
and that was to improve it off the
face of the earth. It was a musty
anachronism. Instead of young men
starting the battle of life at sixteen
or seventeen, they went to Oxford or
Cambridge and dallied with classics
and mathematics until they were
twenty-two or twenty-three. He
shuddered to think what would have
become of him and Mr. C. ARTHUR
PEARSON if they had gone to Oxford.
Mr. EUSTACE MILES said that what
was wrong with Oxford was her diet.
Her undergraduates were overfed,
while her professors were far too fond
of the flowing bowl. Oxford was the
only university in the world which
boasted a Port Meadow. (Sensation.)
Mr. BELLOC, dissenting vehemently
from the last speaker, attributed the
decadence of Oxford to the lament-
able spread of the barleywater habit.
In his day, beer was. tlie favourite
tipple, and it bred a race of heroic
Britons, including himself.
Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER" said that
Oxford's crying need was for simpli-
fied spelling. Such names as Mag-
dalen were a terrible stumbling-block
in the path of culture, and he seri-
ously contemplated leading a proces-
sion of WILLIAM MARCHERS to
demand justice from the Hebdomadal
Council. The nomenclature of the
Colleges, again, clamoured for revi-
sion. To take only one example,
Merton College, in view of the
proximity of Sandford, might be re-
named Sandford and Merton College.
The Editor of The 'Sketch con-
curred with the last suggestion, and
hoped that the principle might be
extended. The popularity of Keble
and Lincoln would be vastly en-
hanced if they were known as Keble-
Howard and LincoIn-aud-Bennett
Colleges.
The Rev. Lord WILLIAM CECIL said
that he had already expressed his
views on Oxford discipline in The
Times, but would repeat that the
interference of the police in "town
and gowji" rows was wholly to be
deprecated. In his own day the
police never interfered with the
undergraduates on November the
5th, with the result that the noisy
freshman matured into the sensible
senior man, with a refined manner
and a high tone of thought.
Mr. WILL THORNE, M.P., said that
the only way in which the continued
existence of Oxford could be justified
would be by converting it into a
week-end University for the working
classes. It was, he added, a strange
reflection on the intellect of the
present regime that, while the colour
of Oxford was dark blue, the great
hero of the University was, he be-
lieved, Verdant Green.
The CHAIRMAN, here interposing,
said that it was obvious that the
sense of the meeting was in favour of
mending, and not ending, or, at any
rate, only week-ending, Oxford. He
accordingly put to the meeting an
omnibus resolution declaring that, in
the view of the assembled representa-
tives of higher thought, it was held
desirable (1) to abolish the post of
Chancellor; (2) to rename and re-
spell the Colleges; (3) to eliminate
amateur athletics; (4) to render
vegetarian diet compulsory on all
undergraduates. The resolution hav-
ing beon passed by a great majority,
the meeting dispersed to the strains
of the Marseillaise sung as a duet in
Esperanto by Mr. BELLOC and Mr.
WILLIAM ARCHER.
ANOTHER OF OUR CONQUERORS.
I USED to think that the office-boy
did those things. But no; it seems
that it is an industry, and a very
important one.
I made the discovery at a station,
where the horrible and irritating
word "Phast-phix" on the picture
of a gum bottle held the reluctant
eye.
A sleek little man in a frock-coat
and a tall hat, who had evidently
breakfasted on cloves, paused beside
me.
"You might not think it," he
said, "to look at me; but that word
originated with me. I invented it."
"Why?" I asked. "Surely there
are other things to do."
He seemed pained and perplexed.
"That is my business," he said.
That 's what I do. I have an office;
I am well known. All the best
firms apply to me. For example,"
he went on, "suppose you were to
bring out a fluid mutton"
"Heaven forbid! " I cried.
"Yes, but suppose you were to,"
he continued, "and you wanted a
name for it, you would come to
me."
"Why shouldn't I think of one
myself? " I asked.
"You!" he cried. "How could
you? It 's a special line; it 's a
gift. Just try and you '11 see.
What would you call it?"
"Well," I said after a moment's
thought, "I might call it—I might
call it Hang it, I wouldn't do
such a thing, anyway."
"There," he cried triumphantly,
"I knew it. You would be lost.
You would therefore come to me. I
should charge you ten guineas, but
in return you would have a name
that would make your fortune."
"What would that be?" I ven-
tured to ask.
"Oh, I don't know," he said, " for
certain. 'Sheep-O,' perhaps. But

seconds (my regular habit) and sud-
denly 'Phast-phix' flashed into it.
They were enchanted."
"I notice," I said, "a tendency
among advertisers to transform 'f'
into 'ph.''
"Yes," he said, " they got it from
me. I was the first. It is far more
striking, don't you think'? To spell
'fasth'x ' correctly would not be witty
at all."
I agreed with him.
Tell me some mo7'e of your
special inspirations," I said. "Have
you done anything lately as good as
'phast-phix ''? But no, how could
you?"
"Let me see," he remarked.
"Yes, there is the name for the new
pen. They came to me in a great
hurry for that, too. But as it hap-
pened I had that carefully pigeon-
holed, for I am always inventing
names against a rainy day. I gave it
to them at once—the ' Ki-teezi.' You
have no doubt seen it advertised."
(Haven't I?)
"That has been an immense suc-
cess," ho went on. "It 's not a
bad pen, either; but the name ! Ah!"
"Anything else out of the way?
I asked.
"Yes," he said. "I was just going
to tell you. I was approached by c
firm with a new blacking. All il
•required was an absolutely knock-oul
name. I gave them one, and onlj
yesterday I had a visit from the
Secretary of the Company, who was
present at the Board meeting when
my letter was read out. He says
that the thrill that ran through the
directors—sober business-men, mind
you—was an epoch in the history ol
commerce."
"Indeed," I remarked; "and
what was the name?"
"The name?" he said. "Ah,
yes. It was one of my best efforts,
I think. Simple, forcible, instan-
taneous in its message, and unfor-
gettable in form—' Sliinc-O.'
"Yes," I said, "that should be
hard to beat. I congratulate you."
And so we parted.
I wonder if there 's really any
money in that fluid-mutton idea.

Speaking of myself," he said at
length, "there is one thing quite
certain, and that is, I am not likely
to have much of a following so long
as I remain in the Commons."
"But whatever makes you think

And blushed like any rose,
As, smitten lightly on the cheek,
The ball rolled to her toes;
Small wonder, when I tell you

Pinned on her light brown hair
She wore a charming picture hat,
A garden in the air!
I held her hands, to put them right,
Showed where her feet should go,
And told how drives went out of
sight
And puts ran to and fro;
Though she could make bewitching
eyes,
She could not form her tees,
And these I made of ample size
Upon my humble knees.
She missed, with many a smiling
look.
And blamed mo for it all,
Because my woeful visage took
Her eye clean off the ball;
Golf was the sport, but I 'in afraid
We trifled with the name;
Observing friends declared we
played
A much more ancient game!

ASQUITH moved the suspension of
the Eleven o'clock Kule, thereby
throwing open for Government use
those cheerless hours which rational
citizens devote to sleep, but which
are rich in possibilities to a Ministry

"the Government were verv anxious

for ever of the surreptitious
peep-hole alongside the
glass swing-doors. Up to
then, lady visitors had been
permitted the frenzied joy
of getting, through its small
Gothic panes, the most in-
timate obtainable view of
the innermost sanctuary of
the Empire. Per contra,
watchful, self - conscious,
senatorial drones had caught
a fleeting vision of a dis-
turbing sex, and had
preened their agitated wings
accordingly to make the
best impression possible at
short notice. Pretending
to be interested in ASQUITII,
LLOVD-GEOUGE, MCKENXA,
and in that flaunting
bachelor who leads the
Opposition, the ladies' eyes
had been fixed with reveren-
tial awe on the beaming
face and comfortable per-
sonality of JOHN BARKER
(now Bart.), chairman of
a few hardy maids, who had " heard
voices " (in Caxton Hall), were found
moored and shrieking in th,c Ladies'
gallery (so-called), lashed like vir-
ginia-creeper to the gilded trellis
above the heads of horror-stricken
journalists, only to bo removed from
the sacrificial grille by main force,
taking their " moorings," substantial
pieces of the Palace of Westminster,
with them.
This performance, and a pale imi-
tation of it in the other Strangers'
quarter, brought down the SPEAKER'S
never a face to whom to turn a
triumphant glance or a moist, ap-
pealing eye. Perorations instinct
with a noble fire hurled into

kcit; the SPEAKER'S fiat went
forth; his foot, in silver-buckled
shoe, was put down, and the price
of the raid was paid; and a small
price, too, considering the "moral
and intellectual damage " done to an
ancient assembly.
Then a few days later came the
evening of staggering sensation when
majesty upon them and all their
kind, and a clear and comprehensive
sweep was made of all the galleries.
Since then one has looked down,
day after day, on the pathetic, har-
rowing scene—an assembly of self-
immolated heroes who, in the cause
of sex and in the name of order, have
deprived themselves of the very
breath of life; six hundred and fifty
oratorical athletes with a positive
yearning for recognition doing battle
in an empty stadium; a mighty com-
pany of potential GARRICKS playing

the limit of human endurance and

conies and green leather was frankly
insupportable. Who would
be the first to succumb,
and say, on trembling

[NOVEMBER 18, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
THE HAT TRICK AT THE
ST. JAMES'S.
FOR the third successive time (not
of asking, Heuven knows, but of
spontaneous giving) Mr. GEORGE
ALEXANDER 1ms produced a Thief-
play. To do Mr. SUTRO justice- lie
has invented a fairly novel variation
on the old-established scheme; and
all went well enough till wo got to
that point in the Third Act where
the first " dramatic " episode occurs.
Up to then Mr. ALEXANDER, as " The
Builder of Bridges," had been inter-
preting (in admirable style, and with a
marked improvement in the manipu-
lation of his smile) the character of
a simple, well-mannered gentleman,
modest but strong with the quiet
assurance of a man who has done
big things in fight with the forces of
Nature, and learned self-control in
the process. Suddenly, through the
inconceivable fatuity of a young man
who blurts out a secret of extreme
delicacy before a whole tea-party,
which includes a perfect stranger,
ho finds himself disillusioned in the
matter of his lady's good faith. His
only decent course, when matters
became clear, was to walk straight
out of the room. Instead, he is
asked to behave like an intolerable
prig, and let the poor broken girl
stand shivering there while he de-
livers a virtuously indignant lecture
on the theme of her moral delin-
quency. Compared with this, the
attitude of King Arthur to Guine-
vere in the nunnery stamps him as
the fine gentleman that TENNYSON
made him out to be.
Till now Mr. SUTRO had held a
possible mirror up to human nature.
But here he is tempted to paint upon
its surface those insufferable flowers
which are the glory of looking-glasses
in a Philistine household. One
wonders a little that so clever a
writer should find it necessary to
sucrifice his credit to the supposed
exigencies of popular drama. Per-
haps he wanted to give the actor-
manager a chance. In that case
one wonders that so intelligent a
player as Mr. ALEXANDER should fail
to see how sorry a figure he was
cutting as he threw off this tirade
against a woman with no one to de-
fend her. And I doubt whether
even from a practical point pf view
the author will find the episode re-
n.unerative. For his play, otherwise
excellent, never quite recovered from
it, and the obvious and perfunctory
reconciliation at the close made poor
amends for this miserable display of
ungenerosity in a nature which else-
where had been freely labelled as
magnanimous.
1 wish Mr. SUTRO would give Miss
IRENE VANBUUGII a change of air.
But if she must be either a thief, or
the sister and accomplice of a thief,
she still has no rival for delicacy cf
craft. Mr. DAW SON MILWARD had
his moments, but he is only a self-
made embezzler—not born that way.
Miss FLORENCE HAVDON, in the part
of a dear old thing who "ajwnys
thought bridges were made by ma-
chinery," was, as ever, a pure de-
light. If she could only have been
on the stage, all the time, prattling
in a corner, I could have been well

content. Mr. WILLIAM FARREN was
very engaging as the head partner of
an engineering firm, who wras all in
favour of perfidy in women, because
it set their victims free to go and
build bridges for him in outlandish
regions. Ho was as welcome as a
roaring gale in a land of mists. By
sheer force of naturalness Mr.
VIVIAN REYNOLDS gave great dis-
tinction to the unobtrusive character
of a head clerk. There was no
better performance than his. Mr.
HARCOURT WILLIAMS did creditable,
but rather ineffective, work in the
most difficult part of all, that of the
supplanted lover. Few people play
it really satisfactorily in actual life.
I must not forget the great moral
pur|K>so of the play. Its name, The
Builder of Bridges, ought to be
changed to The Blaster of Buckct-
«//o/>s. Mr. SUTRO was very severe
and insistent in his attacks upon out-
side brokers. I do hope he hasn't
been badly hit by one of these
monsters of iniquity. 0. S.
CORRECT LIVING AND DYING.
[See eertain recent w-orfca on Etiquette.]
At a Dinner-Party.
Do not partake of any dishes that
are new to you and that you do not
quite know how to negotiate. You
can simply say, "No, thank you."
It would be very gauche to ask your
neighbours at table or the person
opposite, "What am I supposed to
do with this?" Or to say to the
servant, " Bring me something easier
to eat, please."
With regard to pip-fruit at dessert,
it will bo wisest (more especially for
young girls who are looking for an
establishment in life) to avoid it
altogether, as it is difficult to manage
pip-fruit gracefully and pleasantly.
Some people, it is true, blow their
pips on to the floor or into the
middle of the table; but these are
persons of assured position, and make
their own rules.
Never insert your whole hand into
a finger-bowl, or ask for soap.
Weddings.
When a guest at a wedding recep-
tion, your behaviour should be cheer-
ful but quiet. It is not your show,
remember; and the chief mourners—
the chief figures—rightly monopolise
all the attention.
Introductions.
Always introduce the lower in rank
to tho higher. If you are not sure
which would take precedence, make
some little gracious excuse and keep
them waiting while you consult De-
brett. If they are both gone before
you have decided, that settles the
difficulty. The rule of introducing
the single to the married obtains only
among women. With men you would
proceed in the reverse way, the posi-
tion of a single man in society being
the more distinguished.
Last Illness and Death.
When friends come to see you
during your last illness, you will, if
able, receive them courteously. It
would not be in good taste to
reproach them with never having
appreciated you, or to imply that
their conduct has helped to break-
down your constitution. It would

also be incorrect to try to " improve
the occasion." People do not want
to be improved, except in their
worldly circumstances.
When all the last illness visits have
been paid, you will proceed to die.
It is not considered smart to get
better and give your friends the
shock of seeing you about again.
Funerals.
When attending one of these sad
functions, you will, of course, regu-
late the amount of grief shown by
your relationship to the deceased.
Signs of extreme grief are considered
middle-class, and are only excusable
in quite near relatives. If you are a
comparatively distant relative or only
a friend, it is sufficient to pass a
plain white handkerchief (without
lace or embroidery) across your face
once or twice. At no function, un-
fortunately, is etiquette so apt to be
forgotten or neglected; indeed, it has
been said that the only funeral at
which one is confident of behaving
with absolute correctness ia one's
own.
A USEFUL LESSON.
TIIKUE was once a rather passionate
man who put his trust in a new and
rather foolish barometer. Passion-
ate men often want to be out in the
open air, but never more so than
when rain prevents them. So this
man upon a certain Saturday morning
had an engagement in the country,
which, had the weather been fine,
he would probably have regarded
with indifference. But in the morn-
ing, because it looked like rain, he
thought ho would like to go, und,
when it did rain, he set his heart
upon going.
He tapped the glass of the baro-
meter, and the finger moved slowly
but firmly to " Set Fair." The rain
meanwhile rained a little harder than
before. Being still credulous, lie
went and spent an hour in getting
his bicycle ready. Then he tapped
again, and so at the end of every
hour during the day he tapped. As
the barometer's opinion of the
weather rose to the highest degree,
the man's opinion of the barometer
sank to the lowest degree, until
finally at three o'clock he left it in
disgust and decided that he could
not go.
At half-past four, when it was
now too late for anything, the rain
stopped, the sun shone, and every-
thing was indeed set fair. The
passionate man, regarding this late
development bitterly, tapped the
glass of the barometer once more,
and the finger leapt without hesita-
tion to " Stormy." Now that man
was not only passionate by nature,
but he had also been sorely tried that
day. So he took the barometer from
its peg upon the wall of his house
and east it forth from the front door',
siiying: "Go outside, you ignorant
fool, and look for yourself."
"The c.lnb itself [i.e. the Deal and Wahner
Angling Association] has over 400 members,

With over 400 members they might
well have risked it.

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE often reproached the woman who turned to the
last page of her novel first, in order to see whether they
really did get married; and I have told her that she was
both spoiling her present; enjoyment and, by giving way
to her curiosity, laying up a store of troubles for herself
in the future; to which she could only reply that her
enjoyment was her own affair, and why did all men smoke
too much? Well, after reading The Diva's Ruby (MAC-
MILLAN) I find myself now in her position; for Mr. MARION
CRAWFORD'S latest story is the third of a trilogy, being a
sequel to Soprano and The- Prima Donna—two books
which I was unfortunate enough to miss. So I am
wondering whether my enjoyment of them would indeed
be spoilt now that I know who
married Cordova; or whether I
should find them as delightful as
I found this one. The Diva's
Ruby is flavoured (I repudiate the
metaphor) with a reticent humour
which I like, and it deals with
millionaires and carnations out of
season and quails, which I adore.
But chiefly it is a masterpiece of
stage management, and a monu-
ment to Mr. CRAWFORD'S wide-
knowledge of men and things. All
the same I don't think he need
have bothered to tell me that, if a
ship which is capable of steaming,
sixteen knots an hour has a current
of six knots against her, her speed
is only ten knots—even though I
reckon myself among the " lands-
men" for whose benefit he
thought it "as well to explain."
that is interesting about the former, and mercifully
spares us the latter.
Mr. PERCIVAL GIBBON is one of the best living writers
of short stories, but his new novel, Salvator (BLACK-
WOOD), is disappointing. I am for the most part not
in favour of long books, but Salvator for its proving
needed many more pages. It was a case really for
collaboration. Mr. GIBBON can manage Charters and
Pumphrey well enough, but when it came to Salvator
himself, the revolutionist who tried to regenerate
Mozambique and died in that forlorn effort, he needed
the analytical and romantic pen of Mr. CONRAD. As
it is, Salvator is the indifferent novel of a very clever
man. It is dedicated to an industrious fellow-writer,
'' patient in his stall ''; which means—what'.'
With an ignorance too common
in these degenerate times, I had
always associated the laudator
temporis acti with the nonagen-
arian, the lean and slippered pan-
taloon, the teller of old wives'
tales, or the toothless remem-
brancer of past delights. It was,
therefore, with something of a shock that I discovered
Mr. COMYNS CARR assuming this role, openly, and with
malice prepense declaring himself "an impenitent
Victorian." In his reminiscences of Sotnc Eminent
Victorians (DUCKWORTH), he looks down upon the mortals
of this puny age, and boldly tolls them he has known
better men than they. So be it. Mr CARR'S
grandfather very likely told him that England in
the sixties was no longer what it had been in the days of
Waterloo; possibly even in the Stone Age there were folk
who lamented the superior culture of the glacial epoch.
Is it perhaps a sign of the decadence which Mr. CARH
laments that he is himself not quite, sure what to call
his own book? On the cover it stands as Some Eminent
Victorian*, but the pages are headed " Reminiscences"
tout court. For all that, as an additional handful of
scattered leaves thrown into that pot-pourri vase of
literature and art which is labelled " Personal Recollec-
tions of the Great," the book is welcome and enter-
taining. Mr. CAUR has known most people worth
knowing, and a good many who wore not; he tells much

I am not going to flatter the
anonymous author of Marcia in
Germany (HEINEMANN) by sug-
gesting that her book is likely to
breed enmity between Great
Britain and the Fatherland, but I
will say for it that anyone desir-
ous and capable of writing a book-
to that end might do well to write
it in the spirit in which this book
is written. Some years ago Dr.
JOHNSON remarked jestingly that
"after all, foreigners are mostly
fools." The author of Marcia
echoes this sentiment in other
words, seriously and with a mental
reservation. Marcia's idea of Ger-
mans seems to be that they are
mostly conceited, petty-minded
boors, unless they happen to be
members of a royal house. Which,
of course, is absolute nonsense.
The book gives a picture of society
in the garrisoned capital of a small
German state, and it is full of
interesting scraps of information.
The trouble is that they are pre-
sented with little sympathy and

She. Well, what about it'? It isn't much.

letters. No, no, you 've got to help.
He. But
She. Not another word. You can begin with your
bill-tiling box.
He. But I haven't put a bill there for years. It 's
full of children's books and toys and things.

there 'a no knowing that this particular bill hasn't got

the drawers under the book-shelves.
He. But 1 tell you it's perfect foolishness to look for

He. You really do talk more nonsense than any other

lot.
She. Not as much as you think it says, CHARLES.
Now, then. One, two, three, off! I bet I find it first.

rummage through it. He proceeds to the bill-box
and reluctantly opens it.)

so on. What wicked extravagance! CHARLES, you

THE NEW WESTMINSTER.
Tlie Westminster Gazette, which has lately
been enlarged and newly constituted, has
recently printed a story recommending the
charms of a certain restaurant, without giving
the reader any warning that what appeared
to be art was as a matter of hard fact adver-
tisement. It is felt that if this kind of thing
spreads die paper may come to read some-
what as follows:—
NOTES BY TUB WAY.
There arc a good many letters on
the Education question in The Times
this morning, and they are all pretty
much what might be expected at
this stage of the negotiations. The
extremists on either side arc
extremists still, but in between
there is a great body of opinion
which is ready and eager for an
honourable compromise, in which (if
we may be forgiven for explaining
the obvious) each side would have
to make concessions. Has not the
time coine for that great solvent of
difficulties, a good dinner? We ven-
ture to recommend this meeting
ground (we hud almost written
moating ground) and should be very
happy to undertake the arrange-
ments. The locale is obvious to
anyone who read in our issue of
Saturday, the 14th, the story about
Amaryllis and the Now Payity.
SllAFTESBURY THEATRE.
Mr. H. B. IRVING IN "THE LYONS
MAIL."
As I watched The Lyons Mail
through my monocle last night 1
could not help thinking what ex-
cellent opportunities it offered to the
reviser. Suppose, I thought, that
some clever man took it in hand and
made it a new and topical thing. In
the old play Mr. H. B. IRVING takes
the part of the double; in the modern
version he might begin as a single
gentleman, but by dint of excellent
feeding at the New Payity Restaurant,
say, where he lunches, dines and
sups, he ends, with the assistance of
pillows, as a most convincing double
gentleman. The new title might be
The Lyons Meal, and all the scenes
would be laid in one or other of the
sumptuous rooms of this delightful
resort.
REVIEWS.
RECENT ARCHITECTURE IN LONDON.
Mr. SEPTIMUS BOALE'S new work
on Tlic Facades of the Metropolis
brings a tinge of pleasure to the
cheeks of the jaded reviewer such as
seldom finds its way there. It is
both authoritative and attractive, and
it needs no special knowledge to
discover its merits. Mr. BOALE'S
taste and our own coincide almost
invariably, and more particularly
are we at one with him in his eulogy
of the New Payity Restaurant, which
we, too, regard as a model of
the latter-day architect's skill and
adaptability. It rises from the
pavement with such courage and ad-
dress; its walls are so perpendicular;
its door is so invitingly placed; its
windows are set absolutely where
they should be; and the roof com-
pletes all—finis coronat opus.
SOUFFLES.
In Paris they have been eating
camel steak. We hear that Mrs.
LEO HUNTER, dining last evening at
the New Payity, confidently ordered
Lyon's chops. What next?

one must sleep to compass as good

COMPETITION'.
This week we offer a prize of two
guineas for the best Greek hexameter
describing, in the manner of HOMER'S
catalogue of ships, the courses at a
Sunday evening dinner at the New
Payity.
Last week's competition was
again won by Mr. G. K. CIIKSTERTON,
who should, wo think, have a good
chance for this also.
THE LATEST NEWS.
An alarm of fire called
several engines to the New
Payity Restaurant this
morning, but it proved to
be groundless, having been
occasioned by a waiter's
misunderstanding of a
delighted guest's remarks
on the heat of the curry.
HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE.
THE WINE AND THE BUSH.
It may not be generally known
how the three brass balls, the sign
of the pawnbroker, originated; but
everyone is acquainted with the
meaning of the bush outside a wine-
shop. Just as a striped pole signi-
fies that a barber dwells below, so
did the bush indicate the vintner.
Good wine, however, as the proverb
says, needs no bush, and that doubt-
less explains the absence of a bush
over the door of the New Payity.
"GRAFT."
The curious word " Graft," which
now crops up so often in American
papers, has yet hardly reached this
country, at any rate as a neologism,
although the processes which it
describes are probably firmly enough
established. The derivation is a
mystery, nor can wo see how it has
been drawn from arboriculture, unless
i meaning that the wealthy man
whose subsidies the grafter takes is
the parent stock, and the grafter,
or he who receives any'secret com-
mission, is the parasitical growth
fastened to that stock.
BOOMSTERS AT THEIR REVELS.
GUSHING GENEROSITY.
Miss SALLY WOKPLE, the flower-
girl who, as Mr. MAX BAMBKHGER
was driving through Piccadilly
Circus the other day in his motor-
car, threw a bunch of violets into
the vehicle, has received the follow-
ing soul-shaking letter from the
famous pianist: —
"Maridge's Hotel, Mayjuir.
DEAKEST GIKL,—I was immensely
touched by your graceful thought of

long as I live. It gives me great

of the news investigator of The Duilij
Slopboivl, that you are the only
support of your parents and sixteen
small brothers and sisters, and I am
convinced that you will grow up
into a great, brave, high-minded
woman, for you have already given
evidence of the possession of alto-
gether exceptional nobility of cha-
racter. As a humble and altogether
inadequate recompense for your
generosity, I enclose a cheque for
£25 to buy .you some suitable gift-
preferably a little toque—to-reminc
you how deeply I appreciate your

It is gratifying to bo able to add
that Mr. BAMBERGER'S splendidly
public-spirited act is not to go with-

quent appeal of The Daily tilopbowl

magnificent response, and on enquiry
at the offices last night it was
ascertained that the special BAM-
BERGER Reward Fund has reached
the impressive aggregate of £7,412.

should reach £10,000, it is proposed

y'are, guv'nor, just get behind my
board," and promptly enabled the
illustrious baritone to achieve his
purpose without further mishap.
The name of this modern Bayard,
we now learn, is JONAH SWOGGLE,
and he has been the recipient of the
following letter from Madame ELLIE
YELBA:—
"My very dear Friend,—Your
extraordinarily chivalrous behaviour
to my husband under exceptionally
trying circumstances has touched me
to the quick, and I sincerely trust
that before long I shall be able to
induce some great poet and equally
great musician to embody the inci-
dent in a ballad, to which I may be
able to render full-throated justice.
In the meantime you will, 1 hope,
accept the accompanying cheque for
£50 as a token of my regard and in
partial recognition of your splendidly
heroic act of generosity to a total
stranger.
Yours,
With sincere admiration,
ELLIE YELBA-POLMONI DI PELLE."
On calling upon Mr. SWOGGLE at
his private residence in Whitechapel
yesterday, our representative had a
long and interesting interview with
this great-hearted gentleman. Mr.
SWOGGLE declared that he was never
so surprised in his life as when he
received Madame ELLIE YELHA'S
letter, which, he added, had entirely
changed the course of his life. He
has already been photographed by
the camera experts of sixteen daily
papers, and received thirty-nine
offers of engagements from music-
hall managers, as well as an invita-
tion from the manager of The Times
to write, a new Life of Sir PlnUp
Kidney for Mr. JOHN MURRAY, in col-
laboration with Ladv GROVE.
"To Mr. and Mrs. Smith—a daughter. Both

We should be glad to hear how the
little girl is going on.

VOTES FOR ACTRESSES.
MOST-FAVOUBED-BEAUTY
COMPETITION.
[Oil the principle of the plebiscites started
by some of our contemporaries for choosing
actresses for engagements.]
Tins competition has been started
at the instance of readers goaded to
desperation by the increase of picture
post-cards, portraits in illustrated
papers, carriage accidents and other
industries created by the modern
actress. The six most popular
comediennes, as determined by our
ballot, will receive an offer to stop
acting and retire absolutely from
public life, with compensation cal-
culated at fourteen years' purchase.
Old-age peusious will in addition be
provided for the six walking ladies
uiul operatic choristers selected by
our readers.
For the purpose of this competition
alone, "musical comedy" will be
considered to be drama, and any
lady who utters more than one
line or.1 the stage, or -even- joins in a
shout of joy or execration, will be
held to be an actress within the
meaning of the Act.
In connection with this-contest
will be a Grand Tour scheme for
despatching popular favourites who
have passed 59 to Central Africa,
Further Siberia, aud other distant
localities for a prolonged period, all
those passing through New York
being forbidden to announce to the
Press that they are receiving record
salaries.
Successful actresses will be re-
quired to refrain from appearing on
Christmas cards, writing face-wash or
tooth-powder advertisements, open-
ing bazaars or losing their jewellery.
Meanwhile, candidates' photo-
graphs should show the teeth freely,
and represent the sitter in a motor-
car or swinging in a garden ham-
mock.
It is hoped to follow this competi-
tion with others for amateur reciters,
aged comedians, etc., and a Marathon
Race to Kamschatka for the com-
posers of the plots of musical comedy.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
SOME HUNTING PEOPLE.
Tallij-Iio Lodge, Melton.
DEAREST DAPHNE,—I stayed at
BOB AISLABIE'S for the opening of the
season with the Hurry-up, of which
she 's the new " Master." Youdon't
know BOB, do you? She dropped
into the big Aislabie estates when
she came of age a few years ago, and
is quite one of the latest things in
women. Talk of "hunting com-
plexions I" BOB'S is long past pray-
ing for. She couldn't wear a white
or light-coloured gown for nuts I
Her hair is cropped short, she always
rides in the new way, and her voice
is like a motor-hooter. You should
see her striding about in the morning,
in riding boots and a covert coat with
a cigar in her face, giving her orders!
She 'd pass anywhere for a man, only
she 's too . obtrusively masculine.
She 's a good sort, however, and even
her mannislmess had its rise in filial
virtue: her father was horribly dis-
appointed that she wasn't a boy, so
she did her level to be one. I 've
tried to soften her down a bit,
but "It 's no use, BLANCHE,"
she shouted; "I couldn't be a lace-
and-chiffon woman however hard I
tried. You can't make a what-d'-
you-call-it out of a thingummy.
I 've a stand-up fight with MITCHELL
every evening when she tries to put
a coil and some pin-curls on this
cropped noddle of mine for dinner.
I 'in just what I was when father
gave me a pearl necklet on my four-
teenth birthday, and I was so horribly
disappointed it wasn't a new huutin'-
crop that I chucked it out of the
window. Poet chaps write a lot of
rot about flowery May and leafy
Juno; give me November, when
wire 's down and the country 's
stripped for business, a bit of blood
to carry me, and hounds throwing
their tongues, and I '11 ask nothing
better of life!"
And d' you know, it 's the funniest
thing! Lord NINIAN FFOLLYOTT is
simply cracked on BOB (" TWEETIE,"
as he calls her), and has taken Yoieks
Cottage for the season. LOUD NINNY,
who hates exercise and takes care of
his complexion and likes needlework
better than anything else! (All the
cushions and comfies and cosies at
his little flat in Pont' Street are
covered with his own w;ork.)
"I loathe huntin'," he said to me
miserably at the meet yesterday;
"the gettiu' up early and the cold
wind, and bein' thrown so often ; but,
if I 'm to see anything of TWKETIE I
must hunt, lor TWEETIE'S huntin' all
the winter." "Of course she is!"
shouted BOB, riding up and nicking
him with her crop. "Buck up,
sonny! I '11 put you in my pocket
aud you sha'n't come to any harm."
"TWUETIE 's very cruel to me,
BLANCHE," he said; "I propose to
her every day, and she only laughs
and says she can't be plagued with
that rubbish; and I 've bought a
lovely engagement ring, and she says
she hates rings and won't wear it,
and she makes me wear it; and I
think it's very hard that, though
/ 'm engaged to TWEETIE, TWEETIE 's
not engaged to met"
I wonder how they '11 get on if
they ever do marry. NORTY thinks
they '11 be all right, because BOB,
being an outdoor woman and NINNY
an indoors man, they won't see much
of each other, and that 's the chief
thing in marriage. We 'd a lovely
run yesterday, but after the second
fox was accounted for I dropped out,
and so did SIDDY DANGLETON, and we
rode round by Seven Spires and
Mudberry, and had tea at the queerest
little wayside inn—great fun! BOB
attacked mo about it after dinner,
when we were smoking. "You lost
the best of the day, BLANCHE MULTI-
MILL," she bawled. "Hounds routed
out a nailing good fox from Mudberry
Wood, a glorious old fellow who gave
us a clinkin' good fifty minutes' run
till he tired, and then they banged him
about, aud rolled him over at Milby.
There was plenty of grief. The old
Duke of DUNSTABLE got a jolly good

sousing in Milby Brook; and serve
him jolly well right! He 'd the
cheek to give WILSON some advice
about the pack this morning. As if
WILSON and I don't know what
we 're about! But about this drop-
ping out when hounds are running,
and sneaking off to tcte-a-tctc teas
at wayside pubs—there 'a a lot too
much of it, and I tell you straight,
you people who do it, you don't de-
serve to hunt with the Hurry-up, and
now I 'm Master I '11 stop it if I
call." "Don't get on your hind-legs
about it, BOB," I said. "If we 're
such bad children you must enlarge
the powers of your whipper-in, that 's
all! But it 's no use bestowing a
little {duisanteric on BOB. She inter-
rupted me with, "I say, people!
Congrats.! I believe, after all, I shall
get my licence to rido under N.H.
rules. And then, hip! hip! for the
Grand National!" "Oh, TWEETIE,
you cruel girl !" bleated Lord NINNY.
"I hope you won't get the rotten old
licence. I should have to come to
Aintroe if you rode in the Grand
National, and I should die of fright
for fear you got killed!" She
laughed, and called him a silly little
thing.
BOB AISLABIE is only one more
example of a fault I find with our
sex, my dearest. 1 'm afraid we 're
a bit one-idea'd. (/ 'm an exception,
of course, and so arc you, and so 's
any woman one happens to be talking
to at the moment.) We ought to
remember that we 're " not for a day
but for all the time," as SIIAKSPEAKE
said of himself. There 's your booky
woman, who runs all to brains; your
emancipated woman, who runs all to
votes; and your outdoor woman, who
runs all to hands and feet and
shout. We ought all to try, as I
do, to be many-sided—" all things
to all men," and all that sort of
thing. Look at me; I 'm not too
busy with fun and frocks and frills
to have my opinions about the prob-
lems of the day, though I' ve no
intention of chaining myself to the
Speaker's chair and giving the House
tho benefit of them. The Unem-
ployed, for instance. I 've a splendid
scheme for setting them to make a
great big road right through England,
for motors only. Then there need be
no speed limit; the police could leave
off setting traps for motorists, and
turn all their attention to murders
and things; and no people or doggies
would got run over. Talking of
doggies, those dreadful Socialists, not
content with abusing ua, are attack-
ing our darlings—" pampered pets,"
as they call them. . What do they
mean by it? Do they want to take
my sweet Pompom out of his little
bye-bye basket and put in one of the
Unemployed instead?
I 've told NOKTY (who 's hunting
with the Lotsmore, but has twice
been over for a day with the Hurry-
up) that he 's quite welcome to use
my idea about the Unemployed in
Parliament; for I hold that a
woman's influence in these matters
should be indirect. He only laughs.
But I daresay he will use it.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.

ALICE-SIT-ON-THE-FLOOR.
CAN anyone ask whether London is dull or likely to
continue so this winter, after reading in a contemporary
about the brilliant idea of a lady resident of South Lon
don who is well known in the theatrical world? The
reply is in the negative, as this transpontine novelty
takes the form of a sit-on-the-floor tea. We learn, at
first hand, that the most astonishing effect of this curious
tea-party was that every man and woman presem
seemed to be far more bright and willing to talk thai
usual, while one quiet, shy man was full of jokes am
anecdotes. It is, however, not quite without precedent
The Georgian participants in the feasts of reason am
flow of soul not infrequently finished the evening unde
the table. There are differences, of course, in progres
sive Peckham and up-to-dnte Tooting. Our late
roysterers now enter the room on all-fours, while th
ladies bring their own sweeping-machines and dusters
with them. The application of these household neccs
saries to the shins and backs of the gentlemen acts as an
unfailing conversational gambit, and draws out the mos
retiring visitor. Unending fun, too, is caused by trippin
over a row of toes with tea-cups, varied with a cascade o
sally-lunns. The ice, and other things, are broken a
once. Altogether, we note a distinct advance on th
celebrated entertainment given in Alice in Wonderland.

I
House of Commons, Tuesday,
November 17th.—According to the
orators who constitute the firing-
line of the Opposition when
Licensing Bills are around—and,
by the way, it is interesting to note
how short of sharp-shooters their
advanced trenches really are, how
quickly the rota is worked through,
and the same speakers pop up again
with the brazen regularity of re-
curring decimals—LEIF JONES, pallid
and convinced, is the master-mind
that controls the tactics of the
Treasury Bench.
With grey lock pendent on his fore-
head like a wintry Atlantic roller
tumbling in on the shores of
some unpronounceable bay in hfs
native Wales, his pale, ascetic
face illumined \?iVn the joy of
seeing all bis pet theories and his
wilde^e dreams compacted into a
Government Bill, he sits directly be-
hind Ministers, marking each move
of the enemy. Every now and then
he leans quickly forward to point out
some weak spot in the "parallels"
of the brewer and the publican, some
point where they have over-reached
themselves. He lends some colour
to the suggestion that he is the
veritable MOLTKE who directs, by
frequent use of the regal, compre-
hensive "We," the authoritative
"Us." But surely such an assump-
tion does less than justice to the
three bold, skilful '' Musketeers ''
below him, cloaked, plumed and
booted, on the Treasury Bench, all
daring spirits out for blood..
The jaunty McKENSA of the
fighting-top and careful curl, the
D'Artagnan of the Admiralty, who
has looked in to lend a hand—in
what moment of weakness can one
conceive his deadly thrust directed
or restrained by the lifelong advo-
cate of temperance behind him?
Never a gauntlet yet was hurled to
the ground in /it's district but blue
steel flashed from the scabbard, and
quick, responsive stump of eager
heel, clink of spur, and cloak
dashed quickly clear of wrist and
shoulder of his sword-arm, told of
our REGINALD afire and darkness
about to be illumined b'y the shower-
ing sparks of steel on steel.
How can one think of SAM
(PoRTiios) EVANS, with beetle-brow
and shaven chin and Alpine sconce
agleani, yielding his knightly judg-
ment, staying his lightning wrist-
play, thrusting here or there at the
bidding of any unscarred thumper of
the peaceful tub? Who so blind as
not to see the stark impossibility of
swarthy, sinewy ARAMIS-SAMUEL,
waiting for directions'? Why, his
steady, searching eagle-eye would be
sadly out were it not the first to

SOLIDIFIED ATK.
"Sir, 1 never wince." (Mr. G-r<?- Y-ng-r.)
detect an opening for deadly lunge;
his blade would be wet with the
forensic gore of CAVK or F. E. SMITH
seconds ahead of any whispered hint
from JONES.
There was a thrilling moment once
when in the course of the evening
LEIF JONES fancied he saw signs of
weakness and emotion across
way. Glancing searchingly
GEORGE YOUNGER, rosy, pros-
perous, he said delightedly,
"The Hon. Member for
Ayr Boroughs winced !''
To the uninstructed the
thing seemed doubtful, not
to say impossible. The
glow of the combined
health - giving breezes of
Ayr, Campbeltown, In-
verarv, Irvine and Oban
seemed to have made
YOUNGER proof against any
such human frailty.
Up with all speed per-
missible to nascent embon-
point he sprang. "Sir!"
said he, "/ never u'ince!"
Plainly our LEIF had mis-
read some fleeting outward
vibration of exuberant pros-
perity, but there is a
rooted dislike in all of us
to admit mistake, and he
contented himself with the
mild evasion, "Well, all I
can say is that the Hon.
Member showed some of
those symptoms which the
other Hon. Members show
when they wince."
This later suggested to
ARTHUR BALFOUR that he
also saw wincing going on
in other and more distin-
guished quarters (these
the
at
things are so infectious); but possi-
bly again- the wish was father to the
thought.'
ARTHUR made great play with a
touching phrase of SAM EVANS'. He
had spoken of the (extra) seven
years passive waiting of the hapless
licence-holder, cowering beneath the
shadow of impending doom, as "a
period of rest."
There was much to be said for the
truth of this when one compared
this season of immunity from " com-
pensation-levy " and from "charges
in respect of monopoly value" with
more boisterous times of stress; hut
it tickled BALFOUR'S fancy and he
blew with a humour of his own a
fascinating bubble of shifting iri-
descent colours, and kept it there,
swelling it with gentle breath till it
floated, absolutely gorgeous, about
the House. Later, at a touch from
McKEXNA, -it was gone.
Take it all round ARTHUR en-
joyed himself. He had started out
with a deliciously pathetic profession
of jealousy at the fact that, while
the speeches of nearly all his old col-
leagues in the Ministry responsible
for the 1904 Bill had been assidu-
ously hunted up and quoted from, in
order that the intentions of its pro-

feq IT^tf;

motors might be got at, he alone had
been spitefully ignored, omitted
maliciously, treated as of no ac-
count 1
"Yet, after all, Mr. SPEAKER, I was
Prime Minister at the time and the
author of the Bill, and I do think it
is very hard that the Hon.
Member should think me
beneath his notice!"
Since Do MAURIER'S pic-
ture of the poor famished
host at an evening " crush"
pleading for some slight re-
freshment on the plaintive
ground that he was "only
the master of the house,"
no such moving scene 1
been recorded.
The explanation of this
malignant ostracism came
later, when it turned out
that minute and careful
search revealed the fact
that, in all the long debates
of 1904, ARTHUR had made
no single pronouncement,
spoken no solitary word on
the point under discussion,
leaving it with a fine
generosity and characteristic
self-abnegation to others to
commit themselves and give
hostages to posterity.
In a burst of picturesque
and graphic inspiration to-
wards the close of his
speech he "knocked-in"

dexterity of a FRANZ HALS

TAVCER elsewhere—seem to have acted
on the sound principle enunciated at
the music-halls, that
"E-very little hit, added to what you "ve got,
Makes just a little bit rao-re!!"
Simple in form, incontrovertible in
argument, one has realised at once
as it was jerked over the footlights,
between the wheezes, by that peri-
patetic philosopher, 11. G. KNOWLES,
that here, trippingly stated, was an
eternal truth. It will stand the test
of minutest examination, and he
would be a bold man who would
undertake to expose its fallacy.
To the temperance reformer, with
his lifelong antagonists, the brewer
and the publican, in the hollow of
his legislative hand, the formula was
no doubt irresistible; in practice it's
a weariness to the flesh. Still,
everyone who knows the horrors of
the drink trade, even to-day, will
wish that when, gathering its clauses
and schedules about it, the Bill
sweeps presently into the "gas-
chamber " of the Lords, the good in
it at all events may escape asphyxia-
tion. E. T. R.
THE YANKEE PERIL.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—On Monday
last a newspaper contents bill dis-
played in large letters these ominous
words: —
ENORMOUS AMERICAN
TRADE DEVELOPMENT
NEW ARCHBISHOP.
Is the Government alive to this
new menace? Is England's proud
title of '' Mistress of the Sees '' to
be wrested from her at last? I trust,
Sir, that you will use your influence
and impress upon the authorities the
necessity of laying down at once two
new Archbishops of the Cantuar class
as an answer to this undoubted chal-
lenge. We are also lamentably weak
in ordinary Bishops. Of the thirty-
three Diocesan Bishops of {he Wor-
cester class, the majority are of
ancient date, and seventeen are
classed as Suffragan 1 Opposed to
these, America has some eighty fairly
modern Bishops, the oldest dating
from 1784. True, we have about
ninety first-class Colonial Bishops,
who, however, are acting too far from
their base to be of any practical value
to the Mother Country.
To keep abreast of the Two-Power
Standard, at least six Archdeacons
should be provided for in next year's
programme, though seven would per-
haps be better. In Rural Deans (of
which we have at present 810, in-
cluding two temporarily laid-up) we,
are not satisfactorily strong, but on
the subject of Deans I cannot touch
in this letter; they would require a
chapter to themselves. In the
smaller craft, such as Curates, we are
well represented, although even hero
a little more money might well be ex-
pended. Above all, we need more
Canons. I am no pessimist, but I
love my country, and that is why I
confidently appeal to you, Mr. Punch,
knowing there is nothing you have
more at heart than the welfare and
glory of the British Aisles. I enclose
my card and remain,
Yours, etc.,
THE MAN IN THE PEW.

QUICK-HAND MEMENTOES OF AN
AUTOMOBILE EXHIBITION.
THK gentleman who presides up
the mahogany tree of Punch points
the finger of a nod to me that I am
not to deal so fulsomely with the
"automobile" as with the "exhibi-
tion" side of the question. While
on the tent-pegs of dubiety whether
automobile engineering practice, as
seen through Japanese pince-nez (or
folders), would not be more
interesting than mere crack-
lings about men and man-
ners, I must hop the twig
of alacrity to fulfil his be-
hests.
If the proper study of mail
is mankind, one could select
few better studios than that
laid out at the feet by dis-
gorging one bob at the turn-
stiles of Olympia the Golden.

affairs, I had never tumbled

motorists; yet each second or

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE never read any book by MARY JOHNSTON that
missed distinction, and her last, Lewis Rand (CON-
STABLE) is as good as her best; perhaps even a little
better still, by virtue of the firmness of hand which she
here shows in the drawing of character. Yet I must
harbour a little mild resentment against her for having
led my judgment astray. Her title and her earlier
[Chapters gave one to suppose that Lewis Rand was going
to be a hero. True, he is in a sense a man of heroic
build and has a certain greatness of nature, but it is
warped by an ambitious egoism that brings him to
a wretched end. Meanwhile—a far more regrettable
srror-—one has acquired an unfounded prejudice against
a very perfect gentleman, Liuhrcll Cary, chiefly because
lie happens to be the rival of Hand in politics and love,
and has the advantage of him in birth, breeding, and
natural charm. Miss JOHNSTON might have spared him
to survive his enemy, but she has pitilessly chosen to have
the courage of her own ideas. Whether the popularity
af her book will suffer or
not, she has justified her-
self as an artist. The
part that women play in
this romance is not so
prominent as it might be.
Unity is a slight, frivol-
ous thing; and Jacqueline
:i hazy figure, half lost in
the shadow thrown by the
man she adores through
honourand shame. One is
jarred at times by a touch
}f unintended affectation
in her speech; but this is
forgotten in the tragic and
loble reserve of hermisery
ittheclose. If a fault has
to be found with Miss
JOHNSTON'S charming style, it is that she is rather lax
in the selection of her details. Botany is her weak point.
I counted over three do/.en trees and plants in her first
chapter. She should try to paint more broadly with
Eewer strokes of the brush. Yet everyone has his own
way of creating atmosphere, and anyhow there are few
writers who can be so lavish of their descriptive powers,
and vet never cause a moment's sense of tedium.
worth preserving as that of GIBBON'S bibulous dons, who
blush in nebulous regions at an unwilling immortality.
By the way, is it because MILTON was a Cambridge
man that the old misquotation is again allowed to crop
up in these pages—" fresh fields and pastures new"'!
A poet should have remembered that his Puritan pre-
decessor wrote of woods, not fields.
Mr. EDWARD H. COOPER is well known as a man oi
two hobbies. Children and thoroughbreds, Newmarket
and the nursery, are the twin passions of his life; and
I suppose that there is very little about Puss in the
(Tattenham) Corner and Kiss in the (Doncaster) Ring
which he does nol know. The amiable nature which is,
the secret of this twofold power is abundantly reflei-teci
in his new book, The End of the Journey (HURST AND
BLACKETT), though the children and horses which figure
in its pages are merely excellent side-shows. In the
circus proper the performers are all grown-ups. The
leading lady and gentleman had loved and married—
but not each other, since poverty forbade the banns—

COOPER stands in the

whip, the pace gets taster

performers and the spec-
tators hold their breath,
wondering how soon their

each other. But just when
the chief actors threaten
to get out of hand, the

Memories of SAUL among the prophets flit vaguely
icross the mind on discovering that the author of Lyra
Frivola and Verses to Order has written a history.
Poets certainly have turned historians before now, and
3\ren historians in less serious moments have tried to
write poetry; but both, truth to tell, have generally
made a sorry mess of the other fellows' business.
\11 the more honour, then, to Mr. A. D. GODLEY that
n Oxford in the Eighteenth Century (METHUEX) he has
jiven us an excellent history. Pie apologises in the pre-
face for producing a dull book: would that other authors
were able to produce chronicles at once so scholarly
md witty! Like good wine in the old catch, Mr.
JTODLEY makes dull dogs delightful; and there were some
i-ery dull dogs indeed in eighteenth-century Oxford.
But the least brilliant of academic periods produces its
worthies, such as the oarsmen of the green leather caps
ind nankeen jackets. And their memory is as well
special train, and saves the situation in the nick of time.
So that when, hand in hand with their lawful spouses,
they bow their thanks for your applause, you feel that
none is a penny the worse1. And that is much mor.1 than
can usually be said about books dealing with the difficult
question which is the subject of Mr. COOPER'S graphic
story.

DINTS ON SHOPPING.
BY LADY GRAFT.
WE are now at the season of the year
•when (he windows begin to be very
alluring aud presents are in the air,
when, in fact,
"they shop who never shopped l)efore,
And they who always shopped now shop the
more."
As to whether the word " shop" should
be permitted to do double duty as a
substantive and verb I have not made
up my mind. I must ask Mr. ARCHER,
of the Simplified Spelling Society, when
next I see him in the stalls on a first
night; and I want also to tell him that,
if he is in want of a Lady Vice-President,
surely MAUDI DAIUIEI.L is marked out for
the honours by every right. That self-
sacrificing clipping of the final e is so
very much what our dear Scotch WILLIE
and ANDY of Skibo are desiring.
But to come to shopping—the season
already gives signs of being a very
remarkable one. Furs, for example,
were never so fashionable or so much
•written about in the Press. Personally
I favour sable; but that, of course, is not
within the reach of everyone. You must
be either a millionairess or a very in-
fluential lady-journalist to get that par-
ticular fur. My own set, which is per-
fectly new, could not be finer, and I
have every reason to recommend the
wonderful stock, at very reasonable
prices, of the Lapland & Ilairipuss Co.,
999, Regent Street. For those who
cannot afford sable there are minks and
squirrel, and even the smaller domestic
felida?.
It is safe to say that never was a
season with a better supply of novelties
in dress than the present - a circum-
stance attributable to the dispersion of
the amassing exhibits at Shepherd's
Bush; but it has been computed by a
statistician, none the less, that if every
inch of the White City had been given
to modistes, to the total exclusion of
pictures, Canadian produce, flip-flaps
and what not, it would not have been
sufficient to contain half the Franco-
British models which have been acquired
by the millinery trade since the closing
of the Exhibition. Be that as it may,
London is fortunate in possessing an
unprecedented stock of frocks and
blousts, and no woman any longer has
anjr excuse for ever wearing the same
clothes twice. In this embarrassment of
riches the choice is a difficulty; but, if
I may be permitted to offer an opinion, I
would say that no shop is likely to treat
you better than Messrs. B. Co .MING & Co.,
of 2403, Oxford Street, whose Salome
tea-gowns are the rage of the moment,
causing countless young men to lose their
heads daily. I have one, and I know.

Tramp. "WILL TER GIVE HE SOMETHIN' TO EAT, Missus?
WHERE TO SLEEP TO-NIQHT!"
THAT THIRSTY I DON'T KXOW
And the dear chicks—it is to be a
great Christinas for them. Uncontrol-
lable peals of laughter I already seem to
hear (with my mind's ear, Horatio!) as
they unpack one after another of the
delightfully droll toys that are now
being displayed for them, the happy
lucky mites! At Messrs. JOAKES, for
example, are the most fascinating
mechanical toys, including a Suffragette
who waves a banner, with " Votes for
Women" on it, with incredible realism;
and there are, of course, any number
of living machines and Teddy bears.
Merely to sea them sets one longing to
be young ng:iin in the dear old nursery
days. Many will be the anxious appeals
outside Messrs. JOAKES'S fascinating
window this month, of "Mummy, do
let us go in here!" Ah, the modern
Mummies—what a wonderful age to be
born into, with Messrs. JOAKES stocking
every shelf and corner for them, and
the papers open to receive unprejudiced
advice as to where to shop! This is
indeed the millennium.

THE ORDEAL BY DISSOLUTION.
[To (he PRIME MINISTER; recalling his declaration at Manchester in
regard to the Licensing Bill: "On the result of the fight we have staked
our political existence."]
So, Sir, the Peers in their Palace of Leisure,
Which the occasion had painfully packtd,
Seem, by report, to have tak«m your measure
(Pardon the phrase) and returned it intact.
Yon and your honour were staked on the issue;
You were to stand or to fall wilh your Bill;
Now is the test, and we all of us wish you
Joy of asserting the weight of your will.
See, they have flung you the challenging gauntlet,
Plush on the surface and iron inside;
Here is your chance of redeeming your vauntlet,
Also the option of eating your pride.
Meanwhile, in view of the time and exertion
Spent on the holiday task of your House —
Useless, except that it caused a diversion
Grateful to numbers of pheasants and grouse—
If (and the Radical papers have said it)—
If the conclusion was really fore-known,
Shall I be wrong when I say that the credit
Oughtn't to lie with the Peerage alone?
Then as to Temperance — even a Tory,
Even the worst of us, even a Peer,
Doesn't (believe me) instinctively glory
In the excessive consumption of beer.
Some of us wish that the snares might be fewer
Luring to misery, squalid and lean,
Only, we argue, in bleeding the brewer,
See that the blade of your tceapon is clean.
But, to recur to the question of daggers
Drawn for the fray, I am anxious to see
Whether the People, the pendulum-waggers,
Stick to their choice in the duel to be.
Here's to your nerve! may it never grow flabby,
Flinching before an inferior hoet;
Victory or the alternative Abbey!
Surely you cannot go back on your boast!
Yet, it appears, in the Palace of Leisure
Doubts are expressed of your courage and grit;
You were to stand or to fall with your measure;
Surely you cannot be meaning to sit! 0. S.

DISCU RSIONS.
MRS. BOBRINSKY AGAIN.
MY housekeeper, Mrs. BOBRINSKY, has strong views on many
subjects, the lift-boy being, as I have said on a previous
occasion, one of them. She has no belief in lift-boys as it
class, and she considers that the particular boy who works
he lift in the mansions in which I occupy a flat is the most
incompetent and desperate specimen that ever got stuck half-
way to the top-floor. This happened to him the day before
yesterday, and Mrs. BOBUINSKY, taking advantage of his
discomfiture, did not fail to tell him that she had told him
so. The lift-boy, having answered her by one of his most
piercing cat-calls, paid no further attention to her compli-
ments.
Mrs. BOBRHHSKY has, however, now added to her gallery ol
aversions the.girl who, till yeslerday, had helped her in the
service of my-flat. This girl, I may say, was kept rigorously
in the background of the kitchen.and thoughl wasencouraged
to assume her existence I was never permitted to set eyes on
her. , Her Departure, therefore, has left no void in me.
Up to yesterday the was; to-day she is not. "I sent 'er
about 'er business," said Mrs. BOBRINSKY, adding subsequently
that ambition (in the direction of becoming a cook) had mined
every, prospect of happiness in their relations. I was a/fo
asked to mark Mrs. BOBRIKSKY'S words that the girl would
comevtp no good.
^-.jin •
'"'I never could get 'er to fetch no errands," continued
Mrs. BOBRINSKY, "she was that flighty. And she's left the
prints of 'er 'ands on the walls and the furniture. It '11 he
difficult to wash 'em off for fear of the paper and paint.
She'd bin a between, 'alf up 'alf down, to a lady at
Maiden'ead. It was a funny ouse by 'er account of it.
The lady 'ad one set o' friends and 'er 'usband 'ad another
set, and they both lived in two different'ouses." "Sepaiated?''
I asked. "Well, not exactly what you might call separated,'
said Mrs. BOBRINSKY, "but not livin' together. This girl
got ten shillings a week there, which is ;i wicked price to
pay a girl like that, and now and then the lady give 'ei
servants presents. The cook got a gold watch and the gir
got a silver chain with a medallion. 'Owever it all come to

lands will be occupied by a race of small agriculturists with mixed
farms partly tilled and partly arable."—The Daily Teleyraph.
Something else besides the farms seems mixed here.
"When the girl come 'ere I could see directly she wasn'
one o' my sort. She 'd set there dreamin' when she ough
to 'ave bin up and workin', and she 'd sing bits o' songs t
me in the kitchen—things she'd picked up from the barril
orgins, all of 'em. very slow and sorrowful. She said sh

LOVE, IN AND OUT OF.
THERE are three degrees of intimacy—acquaintance, friend-
ship and love. Thus the Young Man becomes acquainted
with the parent, feigns friendship for the son, but really loves
the daughter.
V
I am one of the son class. When love comes in at the
door, I go out by the window.
* *
I do not, however, remain outside on the damp, cold
grass. I go elsewhere, if only for the satisfaction of causing
to other sons that discomfort which I myself suffer.
* *
Proposals may be oral or written. If oral, the voice
sliould be slightly raised and each word clearly enunciated.
If written, only one side of the paper must be used, and the
name and address of the proposer on no account omitted.
Printed forms of proposal are much useJ, but almost
exclusiyely by Insurance Companies.
You may be asked during the proceedings to "name the
happy day." The day referred to is your wedding day.
Every man should remember that, in the ordinary way, if
he has reached 3 P.M. without getting manied, he is, by a
merciful dispensation of ecclesiastical law, safe for that day
at anv rate.
* *
Make a point of never rising before lunch and never
lunching before 2'30 P.M. and you may escape matrimony
altogether.
The best man is so called because he has the worst job.
It is for him to kiss the bride, and that without option of
a fine.
* *
Even for the looker-on the wedding function is not all
beer and skittles. It is more frequently a warmish, glass
of rather bad champagne.
*
It is quite right to suppose that Settlements are made at
the earliest stage. The name is misleading, for the trouble
is onlv just beginning.
* *
When booking tickets for the honeymoon, the husband
may just as well book right through for both. He will
not be allowed to get out at the first stop and come home
by himself.

"Lv conversation," said somebody (I
think it was my grandfather), "there
should always be a give and take. The
ball must be kept rolling." If he had
ever had a niece two years old, I don't
think he would have bothered.
"What's that?" said MAEGEBY, point-
ing suddenly.
"That," I said, stroking it, "is dear
uncle's nose."
"What's that?"
"Take your finger away. Ah, yes,
that is dear uncle's eye. The left one."
"Dear uncle's left one," said MAHGEBY
thoughtfully. "What's it doing?"
"Thinking."
"What's'thinking'?"
"What dear uncle does every after-
noon after lunch."
"What's lunch?"
"Eggs, sardines, macaroons—every-
thing."
With a great effort MARGERY resisted
the temptation to ask what "every-
thing" was (a difficult question), or trial
everything was doing (a still more diffi-
cult one), and made a statement of her
own.
"Santa Claus bring Margie a balloon
from Daddy," she announced.
"A balloon! How jolly!" I s
with interest. "What sort are you
having? One of those seuii-detaclied
cues with the gas laid on, or the pink
ones with a velvet collar?"
"Potvn chimney," said MARGERY.
"Oh, that kind. Do you think-I
mean, isn't it rather"
"Tell MARGIE a story about a balloon."
"Bother," I murmured.
"What's'bother'?"
"' Bother' is what you say when rela-
tions ask you to tell them a story abou:
a balloon. It means, 'But for the fact
that we both have the MoxTMmiEsn

being stiff 'uns.' It also means,' Insteat

"Nope," said MARGERY.
"Bother, she's forgotten her music."

I sighed and began.

"Well, I don't know, MARGIE. It

no, it isn't a bead .... And it isn't a

I gave the sort of war-whoop with
which one announces these discoveries,
and MARGERY whooped too.
"A button!" she cried. "A dear
little button!" She thought for a
moment. "What's a button?"
This was ridiculous.
"Yon don't mean to say," I re-
proached her, "that I 've got to tell
you now what a button is. That," I
added severely, pointing to the top of
my waistcoat, "is a button."
"What's that?" said MARGERY, point-
ing to the next one.
I looked at her in horror. Then I
began to talk very quickly.
"There was once a balloon," I said
rapidly, "a dear little boy balloon—I
mean toy balloon, and this balloon was
a jolly little balloon just two minutes
old, and he wasn't always asking silly
questions, and when he fell down and
exploded himself they used to wring him
out and say, 'Come come now, be a
brave little balloon about it,' and so"
"What's that?" asked MARGERY,
pointing to the top button.
There was only one way out of it. I
began to sing a carol in a very shrill voice.
All the artist rose in MARGERY.
"Don't sing," she said hurriedly;
"MARGIE sing. What shall MARGIE sing,
uncle?"
Before I could suggest anything she
was off. It was a scandalous song. She
began by announcing that she wanted
to be among the boys, and (anticipating
my startled protests) assur. d me that
it was no good kicking up a noise,
because it was no fun going out when
there weren 't any boys about, you were
so lonely-onely-onely ....
Here the tune became undecided;
and, a chance word recalling another
context to her mind, she drifted sud-
denly into a hymn, and sang it with
the same religious fervour as she had
sung the other, her fair head flung back
and her ha/el eyes gazing into Heaven. . .
I listened carefully. This was a bit
I didn't recognise. . . The tune wavered
for a moment .... and out of it these
words emerged triumphant—
"Talk of me to the boys you meet,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MANY MORE INVENTIONS.
ENGLAND STILL IN TIIE VA.NT.
THE remarkable account which recently
appeared in The Times of Mr. EDISON'S
new projects and ideas has • led some
unthinking and unpatriotic persons to
suppose that inventive genins is the
monopoly of America. Mr. Punch is
therefore unfeignedly glad to inform his
renders, as the result of careful inquiries
in various quarters, that the Old Country
is not merely holding her own, but
evincing a marked superiority over all
competitors in the enlargement of the
domains of applied science.
Sir OLIVER LODCE, as we learned on
inquiry at the University of Birmingham,
is actively engaged on a series of elabo-
rate experiments with a view to perfect-
ing his new self-interviewing machine.
The great objection to the employment
of the ordinary interviewer — talented
and stimulating though he often is—is
that he only succeeds in eliciting from
his subject those views which represent
his normal .consciousness. The peculiar
feature of Sir OLIVER'S machine, which
may roughly be described as a radio-
active planchette operated! by a small
gas-engine, is that it enables the self-
interviewer to reveal in "automatic script
the workings of the subliminal conscious-
ness. The results already achieved by
the inventor have been most encouraging,
and bid fair to supply enterprising
editors with " copy " of a character and
quality entirely transcending anything
which has yet appeared in The Daily
Telegraph. Without going into details
•we may content ourselves with stating
that Sir OLIVER LODGE lias discovered
that his own personality is quite excep-
tionally multiple in its composition,
including, amongst others, (1) an arch-
bishop of high Anglican tendencies, (2)
an acrobat with a speciality for perform-
ance on the wireless trapeze, (3) a
Mexican cow-puncher with an extra-
ordinary command of picturesque exple-
tives, (4) a professional singer with a
voice of abnormal profundity, (5) a Welsh
rabbit with strong views on the subject
of disestablishment.
Mr. ALGERNON ASHTON has been
obliged to abandon all correspondence
with the Press owing to the demands
made on his leisure by his epoch-
making experiments in hat-architecture.
Realising that the gigantic headgear
adopted by women of fashion has come
to stay, Mr. ASHTON has concentrated
his energies on devising a hat which
shall combine the useful with the
ornamental. Taking for his model the
American "skyscraper," Mr. ASHTON
has patented a hat which with a cir-
cumference of ten feet supports :i super-
structure of ten storeys, each of which
forms a small apartment suitable for
accommodating provisions, pet animals,
small children or musical instruments.
The framework being of aluminium, it
is possible to unite strength and light-
ness to an extraordinary degree, and
by modelling the outlines now on those
of a cinerary urn, now on those of a
Tower of Silence or a Burmese Mortuary
Pagoda, the patentee reconciles the
claims of beauty with the demands of
common sense. In conclusion Mr. ASH-
TON maintains that his invention has
triumphantly solved the matinee pro-
blem, since as it would be absolutely
impossible for ladies to wear his hats
indoors, their universal adoption will
render the removal of feminine head-
gear in the theatre compulsory.
Professor Sir HUIIEKT VON HERKOMER,
R.A., after several failures, has at .last
succeeded- in overcoming the difficulties
in the way of carrying out his plan of a
motor painting-machine, which enables
an artist, using the wheels of his car as
a brush, to decorate the landscape with
suitable designs. The tyres of the
wheels are composed of compressed
camel's hair; an ingenious apparatus
makes it possible for the artist to squirt
van-ing colours on to their BUI face as
he goes along; while finally an auto-
levitator enables him to surmount all
obstacles, and travel across country,
painting everything in his course. Pro-
fessor Sir HUBERT VON HERKOMER has
already completed a gigantic group of
portraits covering an area of twenty
square miles in Bavaria, and is conduct-
ing negotiations with the United States
Government with a view to decorating
the whole of the Yellowstone Park with
cartoons representing hisioric incidents
in the growth of the great Republic.
Lord itossLYN, by no means discouraged
by his recent bout with Sir HIRAM GORKI
— we should say, MAXIM—has just com-
pleted a new system which is calculated
not only to beat the Bank but to beat
Banngher too. So deadly are its work-
ings that it is understood on the Riviera
that M. BLANC has given an order for a
wrought steel zareba on the very lalest
pattern with which to surround the
Casino in the hope of keeping his Lord-
ship out. Meanwhile his Lordship is
said to be on the point of visiting Le
Mans to arrange with Mr. WILBUR WRIGHT
for some aerial means of approaching
the Casino and entering with his COH-
quering system by the roof.
Sir HIRAM MAXIM meanwhile has not
been idle. Turning for the moment
from lethal weapons, he has been bend-
ing his mighty brain upon the more
pressing needs of peace—or, at any
rate, of domestic politics. Among his
recent inventions are the " Anti-Thome
Shutter" for bakers, being an easily
fixed and impregnable shield against
the attentions of any party of unem-
ployed or Graysonitos who may call on
I the harmless purveyors of daily bread.
Sir HIRAM has also perfected a new
Suffragette chain, warranted unbreakable
and proof against ihe file, which will keep
a Suffragette in her place against rail-
ing or grille for ever if she like?. To
ihis the"name " The Zangwill " has been
given, but a strong party is in favour of
calling it " The Suffraghetto."
THE ARTICULATE APE.
A Punch representative, who is a
student of the new monkey language
which Professor RICHARD L. GARNEK
claims to have • interpreted in the
course of a long residence in
the French Congo, was recently
received at the monkey-house of
the Zoo.
"Sam, the Guinea baboon," Le
writes, " sat pensively at the edge of
the cage playing Patience with pieces
of straw when I entered the monkey-
house with a copy of Professor
GARNER'S newly-compiled dictionary
of Monkeyish intone hand and a bag
of nuts in the other.
'' Sam paused in the playing with
fiis straws, and' stuck one in the
corner of his mouth, like a racing
tout. My idea was to try him
with simple words first, so with a
'Khi-iu' I threw a monkey-nut at
him. 'Khi-iu,' according to Pro-
fessor GARNER, means 'Look out,'
and Sam easily grasped my meaning.
As the monkey-nut hit him on the
nose he bounded out of reach. An
excellent beginning.
"Then, because an adventurous
green Macaque dropped from a
swinging rope with a soft thud on
Sam's head, the baboon fetched him
a smack with his open palm, bared
his teeth, and started to talk in
undoubted Monkeyish.
"He said quite a lot in a long
chitter-chatter that was as noisy as
a burglar's rattle. It was chiefly
idiorn, with the strong provincial
accent of New Guinea, and therefore
diflicult to follow. But I distinctly
heard Sam mutter ' Qhui,' which in
their phonetic language, according to
Professor GARNER, means, 'Well,
wait there a moment, I want to get
at you.'
"' A-ou-hou!' screamed the greeu
Macaque, followed by a phrase
which a hasty glance at the dic-
tionary told me was equivalent to
'Chase me, blue-face!
"The chief fault in Professor
GARNER'S dictionary is that it con-
tains no handy conversational
phrases in the manner of OLLENDORFF.
It would have been pleasant, for in-

stance, to have asked the Congo
blue-moustaehed monkey, the one
with the face like a carved Japanese
idol, who was dangling from a rope
and fondling his pale yellow whiskers
with his disengaged hand, 'Good
day, Sir. Have you the monkey-nut
of your father's cousin?'
"It would have been nice to say
to the Mona monkey—him with the
pink nose and the white chest-pro-
tector—' No, but my brother has the
blue feathers of the gardener's wife's
hat.'
"The best opening that Professor
GARNER provides is 'Our'h' (pro-
nounced as if someone had just
punched you in a vital part), mean-
i»g, 'Hello, there, my friend, where
are you?'
"So I stood opposite the Amber
Baboon—William, I think his name
is—as he sat like a philosopher doing
arithmetical fiunis on his fingers and
toes, raised my hat and remarked,
'Our'h,' with a friendly nod. The
effect was instantaneous.
"William bounded a yard into the
air, went round thrice on a revolving
wheel, tore down a festoon of little
sleeping monkeys, and finally came
at me hand-over-foot down the wire
netting. Something seemed to have
upset him. A bar of hairy steel shot
out at me and snatched my precious
dictionary from my hand.
"It was plain that William was
not a nice-tempered monkey. He
sat on his hunkers and said things
which were not in the dictionary. I
transcribed in shorthand as follows:
'A-grr-rr-wow-yah-bah-PHUT !!' His
language would have shocked Pro-
fessor GARNER. Then lie ate my
dictionary.
"After that I lost heart. Jam-
rach's Mangabey, whom I ap-
proached with a cordial 'En-uh,'
which means 'Here I am, old fel-
low,' declined to be drawn into con-
versation, and sat like a little grey
old man with mournful eyes as if he
pitied me.
"The Mozambique monkey rolled
up his eyes when I ventured on
'Chu-h,' which means 'Permit me
to offer you a nut. Eh, what?
what?' and a brown thing whose
face was like a smudged three-
colour-process print shrugged its
shoulders and spread out its palms
as who should say, 'I do not follow
you.'
"It may be that my accent was
wrong, or it may be that the
monkeys, through long absence,
have forgotten their own language.
But, frankly, it was a disappointing
day, and next time I shall simply go
and make a noise like a monkey-
nut."
"There was a pathetic scene at the Corn-
hunker training table after the game last night
Couch Cole accompanied his pupils to nuppei
and aflt'i1 the meal was finished gave them a
little talk. With tears streaming down hif
cheeks and with all the players crying, he told
them what he expected to do with the team this
year, and how he had hanked on capturing the
Missouri valley championship."—The Omaha
Daily liee.
Of course, when the Americans play each
other, one American side has to lose, and
then these pathetic scenes occur.

Axquith. Very well, we '11 get along

After this, appropriately enough as
showing that Scotland stands where it
did. House took up consideration of the
Scotch Education Bill. GTLLASD moved
amendment designed to substitute title
"Scottish" Education Department for
"Scotch." . Pledged his authority as
Member of Edinburgh Dialectical Society
that the word "Scotch" is hero out of
place. In the Edinburgh Directory
there are 123 Scottish societies, only
three Scotch. In Glasgow the propor-
tion is almost precisely the same.
Scotch Members—or is it Scottish ?—

"Suppose," he said, "the Hon. Member,
feeling atliirst after this discussion, were
to go to the bar off the Inner Lobby and
ask for 'Four of Scottish,' would he get
what he wanted?"
That settled the matter. The Scottish
— I mean the Scotch — are above all
things a nation amenable to reason. Not
only was Report stage of Bill forthwith
passed, but the third reading was by
permission taken.
House of Lords, Friday. — YOUNG
WEMYSS seated at the Table with hand
to ear is not really trying to catch the
words falling from the lips of the noble
lord on his legs. He is dwelling with
satisfaction on the prospect of the long
j arm of Justice presently reaching a
Government who, the other night, re-
sisted a resolution jointly composed by
BOIJS and himself insisting on the creation
of an Army capable of meeting the
enemy in the gate. A fair-minded man,
with a soul above Party politics, he
admits that the present Government is
j not alone in its guilt. A little more than
three years ago, PKINOE ARTHUR being
then Premier, backed by a hast in Lords
and Commons, he had submitted a reso-
lution identical in spirit with that moved
on Monday by Bous. What happened?
At instance of LANSDOWNE, then leader
of House, it was unanimously adopted.
What followed in way of practical result?
Why, nothing.
Still I he late Government had politely
accepted what the present one rudely
refused. And now they were about to be
hammered out on the anvil of their
principal measure, for' which the Com
mons had made the great sacrifice of an
Autumn Session.
Anyhow YOUKG WEMYSS had done his
duty, had stood manfully by the sidf
of comrade Boas, reinforcing his Resolu-
tion with a detachment of his own
passed in July 1905. The friendship
between these veteran warriors is touch
ing.
Many-medalled Boas sometimes affects
to envy YOUNG WEMYSS one of his
medals. It is certainly unique, not onlj
in its history, but, when we remember
War Office custom in these matters, by
the promptness of its distribution. Ii

JOTTINGS OF A SMALL HOLDER.
APRIL.
OPERATIOHS commenced on the first of
this month.. I am not superstitious, but
•wish I had put the inaugural occasion off
to the first of any other month instead.
Have at once received cause for disap-
pointment, not to eay chagrin. The
Agent from whom I purchased the place
in the first spasm of Land Hunger,
assured me it was light lo:im. It turns
out to be heavy clay. Perlnips not quite
so much will be said in future about the
swindling of countrymen who come up
to Town.
Have had hard work this
month, the labour being quite
strange to me. Have stocked the
Holding with three cows, some
pigs, a horse, a dog, some fowls,
&c., but it all appears as strange
to them as to me, and we seem to
pass a lot of time staring at each
other, as if we don't know where
we are. I suppose we shall settle
down in time. At any rate, I
must remember that I am a
Pioneer.
I understand that a revenue of
£600 per acre can he obtained by
the French Intensive system of
cultivation, and I have purchased
the chassis and cloches necessary
for one acre of land. Old-
fashioned inhabitants of the dis-
trict are much amused at this
brancli of my undertaking, but
"he laughs best who laughs
last." The profits from this acre
alone will more than cover the
expenses of the entire Holding.
MAY.
Have been much impeded in
my operations this month, the
weather not being ideal. It
should have rained in April, but
remained dry. The land is now
saturated with daily downpours
of rain, and great clods of clay
laughs last." I have just read of a case ] MILLER gets plenty of milk from the
where an acre of hitherto unproductive
land has returned no less than £800 in
one season worked on this remarkable
system. On this basis, I already see my
Small Holding grown to a proud Estate
of many acres, with noble mansion,
hunting and fishing; and myself a J.P.
of the county.
JUNE.
I lost my horse this month. A big
thunder-storm at night did some serious
damage to the stable roof. I found poor
cows, but unfortunately I have been
unsuccessful in obtaining a market for
it, and have been obliged to ask the
Cottage Hospital to accept the surplus—
which is the bulk. However, I hardly
think it fair of them to make me deliver
it, and have more than once been on the
brink of pointing this out to them.
JULY.
A craze has set in throughout this
district for the French Intensive method
of cultivation, and quite a number
old Tom next morning standing in about! of cloches have disappeared from niy
three or four inches of water, and I don't i Holding. I did not doubt that my
example would be followed in
course of time, but all this en-
thusiasm will certainly have the
effect of ruining me morally
or materially, for I must either
lose what I have spent on the
cloches, or resteal tbese articles
where I can find them.
Have had to turn to hay-
making. Had fiiends down to
ass'st in this health-giving labour.
I saved nothing by this plan,
however, as entertaining these
friends has come a good deal
more expensive thau hiring
hands. However, we have had
a rather good time this month.
Pioneering can be deadly dull
unless you bring a few friends
along now and again.
I hope there is nothing the
matter with the pigs. They don'l
seem over well. It will iiideet
be disappointing if anything is
wrong, as they are just gettins
ripe for turning into pork ant
bacon.

I must take to wearing heavy boots, al-
though I detest them: light ones, though
covered by goloshes, are unsuitable.
A man named MILLER from the village
offered to milk the cows for me, but I
declined, desiring, as a true Pioneer, to
carry out all the work myself. My
success with the cows has been small,
however, as I find they have an inex-
plicable antipathy to me, and make the
task quite a dangerous one. I think I
shall take on MILLER, after all.
I understand that the French Inten-

being discussed seriously in the village.

SEFFEMBER.
A new enemy has appeared this month
in the shape of foxes. My fowls have
been decimated, and MILLER says it is
the work of foxes. But what I cannot
comprehend is how the foxes succeeded
in forcing the padlocks. MILLER,-dilating
on the cunning of foxes, says that they
have been known to be capable of feats
that would be marvellous even for human
beings. This may be true, but it would
not be so marvellous for a human being
to pick a lock.
Did some rabbit shooting this month,
but the creatures in this part seem to be
specially trained to avoid guns. I
thought I had killed a fine one—a hare,
perhaps—but it turned out to be my
neighbour's dog. I quietly buried it;
and my neighbour made a tremendous
hullaballoo all over the place. I have
kept discreetly quiet. And now, with-
out any proof, or, for that matter, with-
out any expressed suspicion, he has
deliberately shot my dog, and I am
obliged to keep quiet about that too.
The potatoes have come up, and turn
out to be mangels. I felt there was
something vague about the arrange-
ment when I purchased the seed.
OCTOBER.
The milk has given out, and I have
decided to give up cows. I have
received a proposition from the Cottage
Hospital which I regard as somewhat
one-sided. They ask for a substantial
monetary subscription in lieu of the
milk.
MILLER also is looking to me for some-
thing to take the place of his milking
job: he says he took it on to accom-
modate' me, and lost other employment
of a lucrative nature in consequence.
This is hardly credible, seeing that
during the first month he would lean
over my fence watching me at work
all day, doing nothing himself. He
has further stated that the law in the
country parts, under some Wild Birds
and Gamekeepers Act, is that if you
employ a man for the summer months
you must continue to employ him
during the winter. I don't believe
this, but suppose I cannot escape the
responsibility implied.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
. OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Mn. MAURICE HEWLETT has been challenged, on this page
and elsewhere, to write a modern novel, and now, in Halfway
House (CHAPMAN AND HALL), he has picked up the glove. We
all wanted to know what Mercutio would look like off the
boards, and here we have him in homespun tweeds. Well,
let it be said at once that he retains a considerable air of
distinction, but it must be added that the artificial atmosphere
of the costume-play still hangs about him. Some of the
minor characters, it is true, smack of reality—a pleasant
Rector, his not so pleasant wife, and, most of all, the young
man Duplessis, who exercises a sinister mesmerism over the
very plastic and susceptible heroine. But neither she herself,
nor her husband, seems to correspond to any recognisable type.
A little minx of a governess, commonplace and provincial,
we meet her first at a parish treat catching prisoners in the
game of " Oranges and Lemons." "It is the strife of love in
a dream .... for what cuddling girl but mimics there the
transports she is to know one day?" (How Hewlettian a
touch !) After a course of innocent spooning (I can think of
no other word sufficiently
banal) with just any youth
who happens to be handy,
she marries, for no particu-
lar reason on either side, an
elderly gentleman of pon-
derous habit and rich estate,
and at once develops, as to
the manner born, into the
assured chatelaine of a great
country house. With equal
suddenness she becomes
enamoured of Nature and
the Open Road, and throws
in her lot with an amateur
Romany, itinerant in a cara-
van. The influence of Mr.
THOMAS HARDY is traceable
here, just as the literary -

in the time which the author allows it. But the process
and the effect are very pleasant.
Approaching the task of depicting the story of NADIR
SHAH, the Turkoman soldier of fortune who, r.:oun;ing
the throne of Persia as recently as the eighteenth ttntury
almost rivalled the conquering marches of KINO Overs,
Sir MORTIMER DUIIAND halts between two opinions-. Shall
he treat the subject in the ordinary form of biography, or
shall he write a romance, with the ruthless soldier for
hero? He chooses the latter, more difficult, way, and has
admirably succeeded. In Nadir Shah (CONSTABLE),' whilst
presenting a full, informing account of the marvellous
campaign that at one time promised to throne the Persian
on the Bosphorus, he permits himself, unfettered hy the
shackles of historic fact, to introduce a love episode.
Furthermore, there are sketches of Persian scenes and
characters which, out of place in a historical record, lend
charm to the pages of romance. One finds in NADIR Sinn
a prototype of NAPOLEON, who was born a few years after
the Turkoman's tumultuous career was closed by the
assassin's dagger. There was the same military capacity,
the same painstaking preparation, the same swiftness and
concentration when at the
appointed moment the blow
fell. In personal character
there was the same irajeri-
ousness, the same thorough
selfishness, the same relent-
less cruelty where private
or public ends were to be
served. It does not form
a pleasant chapter in "the
proper study of mankind.'
But it is fascinating.

nice to be Mr. EDMCXD

when it brings us in touch with the delightful methods of
the gentleman-gipsy; but it would scarce have served to
make the reputation which Mr. HEWLETT has long ago won in
the field of archaic romance.
In CO, Birnam Road (HODDER AND STOUGHTOV), Mr. PEFT
RIDGE tells the story of a simple suburban circle. It
embraces Ella and Fred Hartley (who is known at the office
as "Pants-the-Heart"), their memujc, their relations, their
friends; but one need hardly say that there is much more
in the manner than in the matter. Mr. PETT RIDGE has
tainment from its perusal. How splendid to have friends
like that! Did they actually laugh, one wonders, at the
crocodile mistaken for a prehistoric monster, or at the
habit, common, apparently, to all the author's personages
of tumbling down upon the very slightest provocation?
Enviously, and with the best will in the world, I must
confess my inability to follow them. Indeed, to speak by
the book (a sufficiently weighty fashion in this instance!
the attempt to inake a Scots Cninford of the village
chronicles of Glentyre seems to have been doomed to failure
from the outset. Honestly, Mr. SELLAR has not quite the
two ways of relating occurrences, and either way you feel touch for this kind of thing; and though, to do him justice
that they really are occurrences, lie reports the actual here aud there traces of a genuinely comic idea are clis-

seriously ill, "a curate called and left word with Florrie.

PETT RIDGE'S comment, and its brief presentment of the
curate's business-like smugness is typical. The family gets

MY DEAII SIK,—We have been very
anxious at not having heard from you
for nearly a year. We trust that you
are in good health and that no illness
or bereavement has kept you from
writing to us. Asyouknow, itisourone
ambition to satisfy you in the matter
of cigars, and your long silence en
this subject has naturally made us
apprehensive. Until we hear from
you, however, we shall refuse to
believe that the last lot you had from
us were fatal.
Write to us frankly on the subject.
How did you like the cigars we sent
you last Christmas? Were they
brown enough? Did they smoke to
a finish strongly? Our 'third ship-
per, who went to Havana especially
to select this lot for you, writes us.
that in this respect they were fit for
an Ambassador or (we may add) an
Actor Manager. . What is it, then,
that you are keeping back from .us?
Perhaps you could not light them?
If this was the case you should l.ave
written to us before, and wo would
either have sent you others of a more
porous quality or forwarded you our
special gimlet, with which you could
have brought about the necessary
draught. Lay bare your heart to us
about these cigars. Do you mind
the green spots?
A connoisseur like yourself will of
course understand that, though we
guarantee that all the cigars sent out
by us ran be smoked, yet the quality
of the cigar must necessarily vary
with the price. This being so, per-
haps you would care to try a slightly
higher-priced cigar this time. We
have referred to our books and we
see that last year we had the pleasure
of sending you a box of our famous
Flor di Cabujo at 8s. 6d. the hundred.
A nicer-coloured cigar is the Blanco
Cd/tcllo at 9s. 6d.; but we are hoping
this Christmas that you will see your
way to giving our celebrated Ponipii-
duros, at €5 the hundred, a trial.
They have all the features of the
Ctilxijo which you approved, together
with a breadth and charm of flavour
of their own. May we send you a
box of these?
Our other special lines are: —
The 7 am Coming—a spirited
young cigar at 7s. 6d. the hundred,
of which we enclose a sample.
The A/«fi«Hrt—prompt and impres-
sive— 10s. the hundred. (NoTE.—
This cigar has a band.)
The There- and Back — a good
steady cigar. Only 10s. 6d. Never
comes undone.
However, we are quite sure that
none of these will appeal to such a
fastidious palate as yours must l-e
now, and that we may confidently
rely on your order for a box cf
Pompadoros.
We may say that if you should un-
fortunately have completely lost your
taste for cigars we shall be happy (o
send a box to any friend of yours.
Nothing could make a more accept-
able present, and nothing would en-
dear your friend to you ,so completely.
Now please write to us an.d tell us
what you feel about it. We desire,
to make friends of our customers;
we do not wish our business to be
a mere commercial undertaking.
Talk to us as freely as you would to
your old college chum or fellow-club-
man. Wo insist on being of service
to you.
. Hoping to hear from you within a
day or two, We are, etc.,
FiOlil.NSON & Co.
MEMO. FROM ME.
DEAR OLD FRIEND,—A thousand
thanks for your dear letter and "the
book with the pictures. Upon my
word, 1 don't know which of the
cigars I like best;- they all look ro
jelly. Are they photographs or
water-colours? 1 mean, are they
really as brown as that? I like the
tall one on page 7. I see you say
that it smokes strongly to a finish.
This is all very well, old friend, but
what I want to know is, Does it hang
at the beginning at all? Some of
these cigars with a strong finish are
very slow forward, you know.
Many thanks for the sample. Bless
you, old pet, 1 don't mind the green
spots: What do they mean? That
the cigar isn't quite ripe yet, I sup-
pose. But I think you overdo the
light - brown spots. Or are they
lucky, like those little strangers in
the tea?
Yes, I think I must have some of
jour Pompadoros. Send a box ,it
Christmas to Mr. SMITIISON, of 199,
Cornhill, with our love—yours and
mine and the third shipper's. 1 '11
pay. Not at all, old chap; it's a
pleasure. He sent me some last
Christmas; as it happened, I left "em
in the train before I had smoked one;
but that wasn't his fault, was it?
1 '11 get some for myself later on, if I
may. You won't mind waiting?
Dear old soul, you make a mistake
when you say I hnd some cigars from
you last year. 1 assure you I 've
never heard of your name till to-day.
That was why I didn't write on your
birthdav. You '11 forgive me, won't
you?
Now it is your turn to write. Tell
me all about yourself, and your
children, and the third shipper, and
the light-brown spots and everything.
Cheero! Your very loving friend.
.-. 3.
DEAR SIR,—We have received your
esteemed order, which shall be
promptly executed. Though the
Pompadoros will not be despatched to
your friend till Christmas they arc
now being selected and will be put
aside to mature. -
We have referred again to our
books and find that a box of our
celebrated young Cabajos was indeed
despatched to your address last year,
on the advice of Mr. SMITHSON, of
199, Cornhill. This was why we
were so anxious at your long silence.
We are, etc., ROBINSON & Co.
4.
DEAR OLD SPORT,—I am afraid you
misunderstood my last letter. The
Pompadoros are for myself; it wan a
hundred / am Comings which 1
wanted for my friend Mr. SMITHSOX.
I must toll you a funny thing about
him; as a pal of both of us you
will be' interested. He collects cigar
bands! I have no use for them my-
self; so, if it isn't troubling you,
would you send the Pompadon
bands to him, as the 7 am Comings
haven't any of their own? You might
put them on the cigars to save
packing. Ever your devoted,
A. A.M.

QUESTIONS OF THE DAY.
As I tossed my paper aside the
shabby little man opposite looked at
me over his black-rimmed pince-nez.
"Pardon me, sir," he said, "but
have you finished with your paper?"
I passed it to him.
"I thank you," he said, with pre-
cise courtesy, and replacing the
glasses on the tip of his nose he
took out his pencil and began to look
diligently through my Daily Mail.
"I take a keen interest in the
questions of the day," he explained,
"and nowhere, I find, are they so
.plentiful as in the halfpenny Press-."
Here he made a careful score against
u headline on the third page. "I
answer them all," he added, and,
turning over the sheet, he marked
the leading article also.
. "Indeed!" I said, wondering a
little.
"Yes. I feel I can do no other.
It is but common courtesy to make
some polite reply to-questions that
one may be asked, even by strangers,
and especially to those asked by
friends. Now take The Daily
Chronicle, for instance. I used to
read The Chronicle ..long before it
formed the habit—the halfpenny
habit, I call it—of asking questions.
Well, The Chronicle is quite an old
friend. You understand? So are
The Mail and The Express, and the
t rest. Therefore, when one of these
old friends asks a question, I am
bound, as. a gentleman, to answer it.
'' Do you know that it was I who
foretold-'"the' Boer War?" He
waited for me to exclaim, which I
promptly did. "Yes, sir; two days
before hostilities began The Mail
asked, ' Will there be war?' and by
return of post I sent a post-card
saying ' Yes.' And'there was war!"
I congratulated him.
Another of my successes was the
break-up of the frost last winter.
'/'(C Chronicle inquired on its poster
ono bitterly cold morning, ' Will the
Frost hold?' -1 replied 'No '—
written on an ordinary post-card,
dashed off in a moment, no display
or fuss, you understand—and within
ten days, believe me or not as you
please, the thaw came.
"I am generally right. I was
particularly successful— I trust I
am not boring you, sir? Well, I
was particularly successful with the
question, 'Will the Government re-
sign?' During a period of two years
I gave nineteen accurate replies out
of a possible, twenty-one. Of course
I have my little joke sometimes. I
well remember one of the. papers
asking (years ago, this was), 'Has
the motor-ear corne to stop?' Like
a shot I replied, ' Yes.' D* you see
it? I think I can claim to be the
first to make that joke to a leading
London daily. And when The Ex-
press once asked, 'Do we cat too
much?' I wrote, 'How should I
know when you have never asked me
to dinner?' But they didn't take
the hint.
"Time alone will show whether
I made an accurate forecast with
my emphatic reply to ' Will Women
get the Vote?' Only a fortnight
ago I saw in one of the penny
weeklies, ' Can a Man Live in London
on a Thousand a Year?' A thousand
a year, sir; not seven-and-sixpcnce
a week. Well, I 've had no experi-
ence personally, but I made nn
intelligent guess, and replied,' Yes.'"
I hope the papers appreciate
your information," I said.
"Lord bless you, 7 don't mind!"
he exclaimed. "I don't want any
thanks. Helping lame dogs over
stiles, you know. Still, I gather
that my replies give general satisfac-
tion, for the questions as a rule are
not asked again. I answered 524 last
year, and up to date I have sent
this year 402 replies."
The itrain stopped, and with a
genial " Good day," he disappeared,
without giving me a chance to ask
if he happened to have among his
relations anybody of the name of
ASHTON.
CHICK-FOOD.
BY AUNT KINDLY.
ONCE again it is my pleasure to
offer advice as to the best children's
books of the year and point the way
to happiness in the nurseries and
play-rooms of England, and once
again I have called in the expert
assistance of a youthful reader, my
little daughter CISSIE, who, though
only a mite of seven, knows a good
story and a good picture when she
sees them as well as most.
To begin with, I may say again,
as I always do, that never was there
such a season for children's books—
so witty and charming; never was
there a time when it was so delight-
ful to be a child.
Here, for example, is Willy and
the Wumps, one of the drollest and
most fanciful works I remember to
have read. The satire is delightful,
especially in the scene where, the
hostess twits the King of Lollipop
Land with his second divorce.
We come to exquisite satire again
in Tlie Motoring Mice, one of those
charming grotesque animal books of
which the chicks never tire. The
versos by Mr. DEWITT EASLIE are
quite Carrollcsque in their humour
and finish, as this extract will show:
Mousie, license all endorsed,
Wishes ho again were horsed.
How true that is! How many a
motorist (myself among them) has
wished that after a visit to the
Bench. The pictures are delight-
fully droll.
There lie also on my table the
latest volumes in the darling Podgy
Books, the always fascinating Phat
Pholios and the Pretty Pilules. The
best of the new Podgies is, I think,
The Wiffy Wunkses; the best Phat
Pho'.io is Boo-Boo and the Larynx
Bird, and the best Pretty Pilule is
The Story of Mr. Sammy Serpent,
the illustrations to which, showing
the merry little snake in his new
trousers and tall hat smoking his
first cigarette, and so forth, are
irresistible.
Of the stories for children, the
best I have read this year is The
young Millionaire, a diverting narra-
tive of the children of an American
finance king who are sent to Europe
alone with a million pounds each to
spend. This is mor«t interestingly
and convincingly worked out, i iid
should be very popular in e\eiy
English home this Christmas, which
it is my hope will be spent happily
by everyone, great and small!
I now make room for little CISSIE,
who writes: " I have read The Toffee
Tree. It is ripping. It is about a
little boy who plants a piece of toffee
and it grows into a ripping tree, and
all kinds of things like that. It is
ripping. There are some most beauti-
ful picture:-. I have read a ripping
story called Long Hair and Short
Frock. It is about a little girl and
her adventures, and how the gipsies
ran away with her, and how she was
tracked by her fox-terrier Pimpo and
brought back. It is all very nice
and ripping. Another ripping book
is The \Viggley Pigs, the history of
a family of pigs who go to the panto-
mime, and have a conjuror in their
own sty, and delightful things like
that, with the most beautiful pic-
tures. I have read lots more
books, in fact I don't do anything
else, but these are the best, although
all the others are ripping in places."
"MEAT WARRANTY.
Important Joint Conference."
Manchester Evening Neics.
This was a passable joke once, but
it won't do now.

1 BEHEMBEK the building of the
present Houses of Parliament quite
distinctly. I used to pass there
every morning, and one -day I recol-
lect seeing a cartload of stone slowly
making its way to the site. There
were two or three fairly large pieces
of stone, on the cart. No, I don't
think I could identify them to-day,
but my brother, who had a job there
as labourer for three weeks, might
be able to tell you. The cart was
drawn by horses, but these 1 expect
have been dead some time, leastwise
I haven't seen them since that day.
The arrival of the news of WEL-
LINGTON'S .victory at Trafalgar came
when we had my wife's sister's little
girl staying with us. She had fallen
downstairs the day before, having
tripped over a bit of loose carpet, and
was laying up on the sofa, and when
I told her the news it would 'a' done
your heart good to hear her laugh!
Poor little thing, she 's married now,
and lias a son who went to the bad
and turned journalist. Paddington,
where we lived then, was right in the
country, and to get to London we
used to have to cross a little stile
close to where the left-luggage office
on the G.W.R. departure platform
now is. I think they must have
moved the stile when they built the
station.
There was no Daily Mail in those
days. We just had to form our own
opinions" on everything and get along
as best we could.
The Hampstead Murder made a
great sensation w-hen I was a lad of
fourteen. The murderer was hanged
on my birthday—a Wednesday.
They seem to have lost the knack of
catching 'em nowadays.
No, 1 can't say that I remember
Buckingham Palace without that
circular green hoarding in front of
it; that must have been there a
very long time. "QUEEN ELIZABETH
Memorial," or something like that,
isn't it'.'
My father took me to the " White
City " of 1851, but I rather think we
called it the Exhibition in • those
days.
Taxicabs were quite unheard of,
and 1 remember as if it was yester-

how, it shows the futility of com-

DAPHNE.
HEIU-; 's a tale from times called olden, further qualified
as golden, ,»-"•?•• •?'
When the gods on high Olympus smacked of earth
and sunburnt tan, - _;- "••--..
With their far from formal Dryads, and their Oreads
and Naiads,
And the questionable doings of the forest Courts of
Pan.
At the era that I write on, in the whole of Greece no
chiton
Hid a contour more alluring or revealed so fair a
cheek .. v.
As the one which draped the figure, in its folded classic
rigour,
Of a charming girl called Daphne, of a type divinely
Greek.
I perhaps may also mention that her eyes were bluest
gentian,
While her hair was like the sunshine on the rippling
waves of wheat,
And her face supplied a thesis for the shepherds' pas-
toral pieces,
And they laid their choicest garlands at lier little
sandalled feet.
But, in spite of rustic sheep's eyes and bucolic winks
and divp sighs,
Daphne shunned alike the pastorals and posies of the
herds
For the lonely woodland places or for high and windy
spaces,
For the music of the mountains or the singing of the
birds.
And if Bacchus and his leopards roused the neighbour-
ing nymphs and shepherds,
When the Bassarid and Maenad made the Vale of
Tempo ring
With their light and larky revels on the misty moonlit
levels,
Well, I rather fancy Daphne would avoid that kind
of thing.
So the empty weeks that passed her left her cold as
alabaster,
Till one day by dark Peneus where the laurel thickets
are,
With a certain shy ignition, Daphne met a tall musician
Who in fact was young Apollo who had loved her
from afar.
Now, although his reputation gave some cause for con-
versation,
Still I think that had she waited he 'd have won her
at his ease,
But, when he declared his title, in alarm at its recital
She forsook his further wooing for the butterflies and
bees.
Like the summer wind that passes, Daphne fled o'er
flowers and grasses,
For she heard the rushing footsteps race across the
scented thyme,
And in sudden panic ardour she implored the gods to
guard her
From the words she vowed were nonsense and the kiss
she called a crime!
And at once her lithe form faltered and grew rigid, and
- she altered
To a bush of gleaming laurel in its dark perennial
green;
And she grows beside the river where the rushes thrill
and shiver
With an everlasting murmur of the things which
might have been I
And when Autumn days are dying and the wood is full
of sighing,
When there 's sobbing in the pine tops and a murmur
in the firs,
Do we tax imagination if we say its lamentation
Is our little Daphne crying for the love that was not
hers?
* * * * *
Should we want to pin a moral to this legend of the
: laurel
'For the use of any debutante on reaching seventeen,
It is: Don't be too unbending, or you '11 run the risk of
ending
Not a laurel, but a wall-flower—which is not an ever-
green!
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
"VACUUM CLKANEK."—You are wrong in your con-
jecture that the Select Committee on the mending of the
House of Lords has had the advantage of expert assis-
tance from Mr. HKNRY ARTHUR-JONES, author of Dolly
Reforming Herself, a play that- also turns upon the
subject of Bills. He was not consulted, and as the
Committee, had under consideration the question of im-
proving^ the quality of the Upper Chamber by the
creation of Life Peers from the ranks of distinguished
Commoners a nice sense of delicacy precluded him from
volunteering his advice.
"A LOVKR OF TERCENTENARIES."—We are surprised
and pained that you should only just have heard of
"The British Academy," which is conducting certain
commemorations in honour of the Tercentenary of
MILTON. It is not, of course, the same as the Royal
Academy, though that, too, is very British. "The
British Academy" is a body of gentlemen representa-
tive of those departments of literature—historic, philo-
sophic and scientific—which have least to do with litera-
ture proper, their only connection being that they are
compelled to express themselves through the medium of
words. If MILTON were living to-day they wouldn't look
at him. Sec lines on this topic p. 431.
"THROUGH A MASK DARKLY.".—Many thanks for your
suggestion for a cartoon-—Com us, as a Peer, pressing the
cup of Dissolution upon The Lady (Liberal Party), who
declines it with great dignity. We are using another
MILTON subject this time, and must postpone yours till
next tercentenary.
"War between Turkey anil Belgravin seems almost inevitable."
The Rhodesia llcralil.
Of course, things have improved a good deal since our
spirited young contemporary got hold of this piece of
news, and there seems every hope now of a quiet Christ-
mas in Pimlico.
"Tbere arc always a certain number of soakers whose potations are
probably greater if tbey pass five publicbouses than if they pass only
one."—The Times.
It isn't the number they pass that matters, but the
number they can't get past.

STREET THRILLS.
!
HAS it ever occurred to you that
celebrities no less than yourself walk
across roads, buy papers, hail cabs,
and have their being1.' You may not
have thought of it; but once you do
think of it life is changed for you,
and London becomes a new and
wonderful city. I had not thought
of it myself until this very lust week,
when 1 chanced upon an article in
The Chronicle, in which occurred
these stimulating sentences: "This
ignorance of the presence of cele-
brated people in their very midst is
so characteristic of Londoners that it
can be illustrated by scores of cases
from one's personal experience.
Only last year, when MARK TWAIN
was the central figure in England,
the greatest of living Americans
drove down Fleet Street — Fleet
Street.'—in a curious little pony-
trap, and though his big white head
challenged attention, nobody realised
who he was." Isn't that extraor-
dinary'.' But the worst of it is, The
Chronicle doesn't say what the
passers-by ought to have done had
they recognised MARK. Something
genial and offensive, no doubt, to
make him sorry that lie had come.
Perhaps they ought to have taken
the pony from the shafts and drawn
him instead, or merely have stared
him into discomfort.
Again: "Even playgoers, enthu-
siastic celebrity hunters though they
are, rarely identify this or that star
of the stage in their habits as they
walk or drive about the streets.
One would think that Miss EDNA
MAY, as a passenger on the Under-
ground, would have been—to use a
fine, old, fruity phrase—the cynosure
of all eyes, but it is doubtful whether
two passengers in the long car real-
ised that the charming lady in the
corner seat was the first queen of
musical comedy." There is, of
course, no excuse for playgoers not
to recognise their gods and god-
desses, considering the number of

likely to do it again. These Chronicle
gentlemen are too active and
observant.
The moral of the whole thing is
that one should be prepared for the
worst—or best—and stare all the
time at everyone, raising one's hat
deferentially all the while. One will
run the risk of paying undue attention
to a few nonentities, but the satisfac-
tion of having conveyed the illusion
of recognition and homage to the
others will be sufficient repayment.

EASY CHARITY FOR CHILDREN.
DKAU MR. Pi'NCH,—I am only a little girl of nine years old,
but I thought I would like to tell you all about my Christmas
charities. They are such fun. something like competitions,
but ever so much more interesting than the LifflBricks Daddy
used to grt so cross over. First of all I have to write a
letter to Santa Glaus—that means one of the Stores, really —
and enclose a sixpenny postal order for a Children's Hospital,
and as they are giving a thousand beautiful prizes for the
best letters I am hoping to win one, as I think I write very
nicely for my age—don't you? And even if I don't, every
single child who sends a postal order will get a pretty sou-
venir, which, Mummy says, will very likely be worth more
than sixpence.
Then I am collecting threepenny-bits for the Charity
competition in Mummy's fashion paper. They are giving
dolls' perambulators /or prizes to the children who collect
most; and I 'in nearly sure to get one, as I bother all
Mummy's and Daddy's friends dreadfully. Then I am paint-
ing a picture post-card and sending stamps for the Poor
Children's Warm Stockings Charity; but I am only trying
for a third prize in that, because the third prize is a paint-
box and I want a new one. A lady from our own church
asked me if I could make cuffs for the poor children round
here. Of course I can make cuffs, but they are giving no
prizes, and I don't expect I shall have time.
I thought, dear Mr. Punch, you might like to get up a
Children's Charity Competition for us. We would send
postal orders. And would you mind giving fountain pens
for prizes, because I do want to have onr>, and Daddy won't let
incuse his? Your affectionate little Friend, Horn'.
TO MILTON.
[\Villi x'niccre apologies to H'ord*rrort/i.]
"Milton, if he were alive now, would be in favour of every advanrd
movement except women's suffrage."— Prof, llanley, of Chicago.
MILTON! thou shouldst be living with us now:
England hath need of t.hec: she is a den
Of roaringjipns—women versus men;
Women, who used to be content to bow
To man's authority, have lost somehow
The knack of doing so. Hence I take my pen
To say how much I wish thee back again,
To teach them manners. People say that thou
Didst own the very attribute we need,
Namely, " a voice whose sound was like the sea;"
Imagine what an asset that would be
At meetings where the Suffragette holds sway
With frequent interruptions, and indeed
The speaker's duty on herself doth lay!
"Canon Pall occupied the pulpit in the morning, and the Hector in
the evening. Both at the morning and evening services the anthem
was 'Sleepers, awake !' "—The Peterborough Erj>ress<.
But surely this anthem cannot have been necessary in
the morning.

close by. Who's GEORCJE WVND-
HAM'S "right lion. Question's

This anonymous person introduced
to Committee after it had been
engaged for three hours in discussing
Education Bill. G. W. had worked
himself up to state of glowing indig-
nation. PRINCE ARTHUR, earlier inter-
posing, asked for particulars about
grants to be made to contracting-out j
schools. RUNCIMAN promised to give
later on information as to what he
airily alluded to as "the item." It
was thereupon G. W. drugged in his
"right hon. Question's friend,"
whose appearance on scene was
greeted with grateful burst of
laughter.

"Why," he cried aloud, "we are

nominally exist two Chambers. But
wo/k of legislation is done outside.
Last week we had the Peers meeting
at Lansdowne House to arrange fate
of Licensing Bill. Decided to chuck
it on Second Reading. And chucked
it was. In respect of Education
Bill analogous course adopted in

write letters to each other discussing
moot points. RUNCIMAN comes and
goes between, and, when everything
is settled in the bc.ek parlour, House
of Commons is invited to append to
arrangement the seal of its approval.

weighted. If the principal Bills of
the Session are to be settled, whether
at Lansdowne House or Lambeth
Palace, what's the use of noble Lords
and hon. Members coming down to
Westminster and making-believe to
legislate? Of diverse processes the
Lords hit upon the happier. With
that delightful disregard of conven-
tionality that distinguishes them,
they, having deliberately, by over-
whelming majority, declared in the
semi-privacy of Lansdowne House
that thev would throw out the
demand a settlement and must at an
early date receive that settlement
from the highest authority."
Fifteen years have sped since this
solemn warning was littered amid

the
ancient adversary who has flouted
them afresh. C.-B., constitutionally
a man of peace, followed the custom
of 1893. When the Lords eontume-
liously threw out his Scottish Bills,
Licensing Bill on the Second Read- ho, in manner reminiscent of Tin'
ing, gave up three whole sittings to Private Secretary in moment of
appearance of solemnly debating' extreme exasperation, warned them
whether it should or should
not be permitted to pass
that stage.
In respect of the Educa-
tion Bill the Commons do
not even have a look in.
Clauses, sections and sub-
sections having been settled
between the Archbishop and
the Minister, its function is
limited to voting when ques-
tion is put. This may he
defensible on the score that
it is the only way of con-
cluding the business. But
the process is crude, so little
to the taste of a loyal ma-
jority that once to-night the
number fell to sixty-seven.
No wonder GF.OROE Wvxn-
HAM, groping his way in the
darkness of the Middle
Ages, indignantly declared
that "The PRIME MINISTER
has not given a proper an-
swer to my right hon.
Question's friend."
BusinetB done.—Clause 1
of Education Bill carried by
closure.
Tuesday.—Some expecta-
tion yesterday that the PRRMIKK would
seize opportunity to" say a few words"
about the Lords and the Licensing
Bill. Occasion tempting; practice
in analogous circumstances custom-
cry. GLADSTONE'S last speech from
the brass-bound box long familiar
with the influence of his clenched fist
contained a strong denunciation of
conduct of Lords in throwing out
Home Rule Bill, action closely fol-
lowed by half-strangling of Parish
Councils Bill.
"For me," said the veteran
knight, wearing his armour for the
last time, " my duty terminates with
calling the attention of the House to
the fact that we are considering t>
part, an essential and inseparable
part, of a question that has become
profoundly acute—a question that will

that if they did it again he "would
give them a good hard knock."
AsQriTH above all things a man of
business. Not in a position just now
to take the field against the Lords.
The trumpet will sound to battle by-
and-by. For the present he will stay
in Downing Street and endeavour to
get through as many Bills as can be
managed in the course of another
two, peradventure three, years. If
he is not prepared to bite, why waste
time in barking?
So yesterday came and went, and
never a word was said about fate of
Licensing Bill or iniquity of the
Lords. To-day chance came of firing
a shot without danger of ricochet.
The rifle instantly at his shoulder.
Gentlemen below Gangway on Minis-
terial side, competing with DON'T
KEIR HARDIE in intimate knowledge
of India, and in self-confidence of
their capacity to govern it, protested
against SECRETARY OF STATE'S annual
discourse being delivered in the 'other
House, whilst the Commons have no
opportunity of discussing questions
involved. Did the PREMIER think
the Commons were less capable tha;i
the Lords of dealing with Indian
affairs?
ASQUITH saw his opportunity and
seized it by. the hair.
"This House," he said,-" is-the
proper and natural place for discus-
sion of all affairs. I am most jealous
that it should not be put in preju-
dicial position compared
with the other branch of thf
Legislature in regard to this
or any other question."
Gathering revolt belo-.v
Gangway straightway sub
sided. Roar^of angry cheers
broke forth from Ministerial-
ists. It wasn't the rose,
but it lived near it. It
wasn't a herald of pitched
battle with the Lords, but it
was a neatly administered
dig in the ribs which for the
moment gratified good
Radicals.
Business done.—Clause 2
of Education Bill carried.
Wednesday.—Quite a long
time since we heard of our
old familiar friend, the Last
Ditch. In days of Home
Rule Bill it was as much a
part of House of Commons
as the Gangway or the Bar.
The Ulster Members, so to
speak, nightly slept in it.
Contemplation of it once led
GRANDOLPH to imitate Mr
Silas W egg's occasiona.
habit of dropping into poetry.
"Ulster will fight," said the
champion of Law and Order; "anc
Ulster will be right."
Colonel SAUNDERSON, ever-lamentet
among the old friends who leaven the
present House, saw to it that the
ditch was kept in good order, suitable
for Irish Landowners to die in when
ever loyalty suggested that the pro
cedure would be advantageous in th<
campaign against Home Rule.
Seemed as if the last ditch hat
disappeared with other Parliament
ary institutions of the final quarter o
the nineteenth century. One ha<
come to think of it as filled-up
grass-grown, with children playing
over a space in which gallant Ulster
men had several times died.

THE TRUE APPEAL.
[In the new Christmas play at His Majesty's
Theatre we are promised (by The Daily Ex-
press) “a subtlety and underlying philosophy
in the story and its treatment which will cause
it to appeal as strongly to grown-up people
as to the children themselves.”]
I've settled down in manhood's
groove;
My pockets are no longer sewn up;
I've got a latchkey, and I move
In circles most distinctly grown-
up.
I've quite abandoned booby-traps
And other rough-and-ready joking,
While—clearest sign of all, perhaps—
My father doesn't mind my smok-
ing.
Yet these are facts that I forget,
Confronted with a children's story;
I follow it enrapt—and let
Philosophising go to glory.
Take Peter Pan : I went to that,
Because I loved to see the flying,
To feel my heart go pit-a-pat
When Tinker Bell (I feared) was
dying;
To watch the nurse dressed likes a -
dog,
To hear the wolves and redskins
howling, -
To mark the pirates sipping grog
And tremble at their awful scowl-
Ing; -
To squirm before those ghastly jaws,
Which swallowed Hook and all his
rum wear— - *
That 's why I went; and not because
I thought to sniff a moral some-
where. - - - -
“The peeresses came in bevies, as did the
duchesses, marchionesses, countesses, and ladies
of lesser rank."—The Western Daily Press.
This shows that bevies are much
more satisfactory than motor-cars to
come in. Motor-cars tend to empha-
size social distinctions.
The Dream that didn't come true.

Which they ate with a RUNciMAN spoon,
And hand in hand on the edge of the sand
They danced by the light of the moon.”

AT THE PLAY.
I.—WYNDHAM'S.
FROM the general atmosphere of
snobhery which pervades his play,
.Sir Anthony, I am not sure that the
author himself escapes untainted.
Certainly he takes small pains to
conceal from us that the home life
of the suburbs is known to him only
by report. Whether the milieu is
Herne Hill or the r more., genteel
slopes of Bulham, it is always a stag-.?
Su-burbia that ho presents. This
kind of artificiality of'the footligh'.s
doesn't matter much in the case of
the two extremes of the social scale.
The traditional duke and the tradi-
tional burglar serve well enough, since
the playwright's probable unfamili-

Kec.'Wilk'ui IMmar . Mr. J. 1). Heveridge.
MI ity witli these types in ai'tual life is
sliared by most of his audience. But
witli the groat In-between it is dif-
ferent', and there must have been
many people, from the boxes to the
pit, who could have easily corrected
.Mr. HAIHHIN CHAMBERS' picture of
suburban manners. An exception
must l)c admitted in the character of
the Congregational Minister, played
by Mr. BEYERIDGE with an admirable
restraint in the matter of unctuous-
ness.
It seems a pity, if snobbery as the
vice of the age. was to be the authorV
theme, that he should have selected
for ridicule so harmless and ex-
cusable a case as this of the pork-
ciirer's clerk, who tries to make
capital out of a chance nssociation
with a baronet on board ship. Far
likelier objects of contempt in tins
kind were to be found at large, and
crying for castigation, in the out-
skirts, and even well within the
borders, of Mayfair itself. And here
he could more easily have confined
his satire to the actual vice, and not
been tempted to confuse it with the
unnecessary ridicule of a class. I
rather think, by the way, that Sir
'Anthony, whom' I should have liked
to see on the stage, was as bad a suoh
as any of them. His method of
snubbing the innocent advances of
the poor little clerk certainly did not
make him out to be much of a
thoroughbred.
The skeleton of the author's
schonic is fairly fresh, but it is only
a" skeleton with no flesh to it. Mr.
WEEDON GHOSSMITH did all that was
possible to give it life, playing like
the good craftsman he always is. It
was not his fault ' that he was
given things to say which were far
too clever fo.r the part. I do wish
that he might now and again be
offered a role in which he isn't ex-
pected to shoot his shirt-cuffs and
strut about with a crook in his
elbows. Miss NINA BOUCICAULT had
very little chance for her fine gifts
in the rather obvious part of. the
clerk's sister; but Mr. EVELYN BEEH-
BOIIM showed great .promise .as an
impossibly offensive counter-jumper.
Miss CHRISTINE SILVER made a-very
passable minx;, and -Miss. Sr/ANXi:
SHELDON, much too .good for her
opportunities, gave, in the person'of
the opulent Afrs. Bulger, a very
humorous picture of the higher vul-
garity.
II.—THE WALDORF.
I remember being taken once by a
gallant fellow in the Argylls to see
a popular Musical Comedy. Both of
us laughed but little; 1, because I
found it rather stupid; he, because
he knew it by heart. He admitted
to having seen it twenty-two times.
I hazarded the only conceivable
explanation: "You have," I said,
"a friend in the chorus'.'"
He denied it.
'' But what other thinkable attrac-
tion can there be'.'" I asked.
"Oh, well," he said, "one must
do something of an evening."
I never in my life heard a worse
excuse for anything.
Sometimes 1 think that the audi-
ences who take delight in assisting
.it British Musical Comedies must
be a class apart, and that I um
outside the pale. For one tiling,
this kind of entertainment seems to
need such a lot of creators—often
half-a-dozen, not counting the per-
formers with their private, gag—and
that makes it so hard to fix the
responsibility. Howover, the "New
Musical Comedy " at the Waldorf is
the work of two men only, Mr. HUGO
FELIX (sit nomen omen!), who, did
the pretty music, and Mr. ADRIAN
Koss, who made the "i'.ook and
Lyrics." I am not including the
original French authors, whose
names are omitted on the pro-
gramme, for after all they were
foreigners, and only invented the
thing, and so don't count.
The play is called The Antrlujtc.
I never nursed a young gazelle;
Hut 1 \vas given :in antelope.
The. name stands for a company
that insures you against your wife's
elopement. T don't suppose that a
pun like that—always a bad thing
in a title—reallv amused Mr. ADRIAN

Hi-nut-!/ I'mrlicr . . . Mr. Fred Wright, jun.
Koss himself; but long commerce
with the sort of humour that is de-
manded in the circles where his lot is
cast has left him sadly cynical. As
a maker of stage - lyrics, though
hardened by habit, he is incapable o
bad or slovenly work, and can stil
give.proof of his quality, as in the
song " Matches 1 have made." But
he bus not had a fair chance this
time, being compelled to make words
that would go to ready-made music
In these conditions he has done very
well not to be more mechanical.
In one respect he enjoys an un
usual advantage. As author of al
the words, spoken or sung, he has no
temptation to trespass on a rival's
preserves, and has given us his liook
and his Lyrics in right proportions
In effect, the movement of the farce
is not hampered by the intrusion o
soi "s out of season.

Mr. FARREN SOUTAU, who played

KUBELIK, on whose shoulders the
mantle of PAGANINI is admitted to
have fallen, is about to undertake an
extensive tour in Manchuria, Korea,
Sakhalin and Japan. The main aim
of his visit, however, is not so much
artistic as scientific. KUBELIK has
long been a profound student of
physics, and he is anxious to confirm
some of his remarkable theories on
the subject of capillary attraction by
experiments on the Hairy Ainos of
Japan, whose susceptibility to music
is little short of notorious.
Mr. McCoiiMACK, the famous Irish
tenor, will shortly start on a profes-
sional tour in North Africa. After
giving a series of concerts at Algiers,
Biskra, and Figuig, and other influ-
ential centres, he intends to strike
south for Lake Tchad and Timbuctoo,
in the hopes, first, of discovering
traces of the occupation of this
region by the pre-historic Milesians;
and, secondly, of studying the voice-
production of the gorilla, which, on
the authority of Du CHAILLU, is able
to emit H high 1) from the chest and

ployed a steel cage for his observa-
tion of the gorillas of this district, but

ACADEMIC INCONSISTENCY.
THE British Academy solely consists
Of scholars, historians, philologists;
And in framing the roll of its blessed

On poets it ruthlessly slams its
portals.
The British Academy, somewhat late
In the day, resolved to be up to date;
And set in motion its machinery
To organise a Tercentenary.
But strange to say, the man whom
it chose

one, knows,
Would not, if alive, be in a position
To be a British Academician.

Mr. Punch's titaff of Learned Clerks.)
IT is B. H. BENSON'S habit to make his work either
openly or covertly controversial, and renders of The
Conventionalists (HUTOIHNSON) have no surprise in store
tor them. The Banisters—an old Protestant family—
were, with the exception of Algy, martyrs to convention,
which means that they talked and thought of little but
sport, food, and the management of their estate. The
action of the first part of the book may be said to have
been carried on to the music of meals, and in this
atmosphere Algy was as out of place as a lady would be
at a prize-fight. So when he meets some Roman
Catholic priests and Christopher Dell (whom readers of
orgies in a ruined abbey), and I am glad to remember* ii
that his date (floruit et ftiruit) was 1800 or thereabouts,
and that he only kept tame wolves and not a motor-car.
Still, at a respectful distance the pageant of his deeds
excites sympathy, and one is glad when he at last wins
his long-married bride.
Lady Koggs is delightful. She is at her best whilst
still a child, her habit of setting her elders right being
fascinating. By a bold and happy device Mr. JEPSON
makes her a Peeress in her own right, niece and ward
of the PKIMK MINISTER. The effect was probably un-
intentional, but here and there in the intercourse of the

MESSRS. SHEFFE & SON beg to an-
nounce that arrangements for the
1918 season of excursions to the
United States are now complete. The
first boat will leave Southampton on
May let, and others, either from that
port or Liverpool, at regular intervals
of a few days throughout the summer
months until August 31st.
Since the end of the last season so
many more unique English treasures
have found their way to the United
States that Messrs. SHEFFE are antici-
pating an immense increase in the
number of tourists, since it has be-
come a habit of their countrymen to
value only that which they have to
travel abroad to see.
Among the special new objects of
interest in America which the 1918
circular tours will embrace are :—
SIIAKSPEARE'S cottage from Strat-
ford-on-Avon, now the property of
WILLIAM K. MuNOEB, the cart-grease
king, and recently successfully re-
erected at Mungersville, N".Y.
MILTON'S cottage from Chalfont St.
Giles, now the property of HIRAM J.
KINDERPOLL, of Chicago, recently suc-
cessfully re-erected in the grounds of
his mansion in that city.
A priceless collection of WHISTLER'S
etchings, first state, presented by the
Artist to Queen VICTORIA. Now in
the New York Museum.
Fifty-three first folios, all col-
lected by Mr. PIERPONT MORGAN and
exhibited through glass in the
wholesale folio department of that
virtuoso's famous library. Visitors
are allowed to file by, but no one
must stop.
The MS. of Magna Charta, now the
property of ANDREW CANNIMANN, the
proprietor of the famous rye whisky
which bears his name, to be seen in
the window of his chief office in
Detroit. It will be remembered that
this historic document, when it came
into the market last year, was made
an object of keen competition among
American collectors, the British
Museum not being in a position to
offer more than i'25.
Assorted samples of VELASQUEZ,
from twenty English collections, now
the property of ESAU W. SMITHSON,
the white-lead prince, whose mansion
on 87th Avenue is one of the wonders
of the world.
The MSS. of Mr. MEREDITH'S
Egoist, Mr. HARDY'S Far From the
Madding Crowd, Mr. SWINBURNE'S
Poems and Ballads, first series, J. R.
GREEN'S Short History of the English

and CARLVLE'S Past and Present,
which are now exhibited in the

[DECEMBER 16, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DETACHMENT OF PRENDERBY.
HE DISCUSSES THE REFORM OF TITE Lonns.
I FOUND him in one of his most judicial and ponderous
moods. "I have been studying," he said, " the full report
of Lord ROSKBERY'S Select Committee, and I come to
the conclusion that they have left the root of the evil
practically untouched. So far from killing the snake
that is spoiling his Paradise, the nohle Lowlander who
occupied the chair has not even scotched him, unless
the attempt to mollify him with soft airs upon the
bagpipes is to count as scotching.
"To hegin at the beginning—and it looks as if the
Select Committee had started further on, like the Irish-
man who was for omitting the first half-dozen lessons
in the French language because lie had heard that they
were the stiffesl—it is not a bad plan when you are
considering the reform of anything to ask yourself what
is the actual object of that thing's existence. Now
there are two possible arguments for the existence of
a Second Chamber:—(1) That it is wanted to carry
out the Will of the People; and therefore, if necessary,
to protect them against their own elected representa-
tives; (2) that it is wanted to guard the best interests
of the People, whether they wish it or not; and therefore,
if necessary, to protect them against themselves.
"As for No. 1, I have a profound contempt for the
so-called Will of the People"
(" Vox Dei! " I said, crossing myself.)
"and my contempt," continued PRF.XDF.RBY un-
moved, "is clearly shared by the Constitution, which
allows a Government, Tory or Radical, to keep in office
long after it has apparently ceased to represent popular
feeling. And, anyhow, even if the Will of the People
were worth respecting, instead of being a thing which
is alternately described as a Divine Utterance and a
Pendulum, a Lord of Parliament has no better power
of gauging the country's feelings at any given moment
than is enjoyed by the Man in the Street.
"Indeed, if it were the function of a Second Chamber
simply to discover, and automatically endorse, the Will
of the People, then the ideal Senate should consist of
nothing hut Election Agents. So I think we may dis-
pose of theory No. 1 as unfit for serious contemplation.
"Remains No. 2. And for the purposes of a
Chamber that has to look after the true interests of
the nation, populo volente nolcnte, you need the abso-
lutely best men that are to be found. Does an
hereditary Peerage, and it alone, produce this type?
It has, I grant, one great advantage: it is indepen-
dent of the shifting pressure of popular demands at
the polls. But a system of Chance—names taken at
random from a directory and drawn out of a hat—•
would equally assure this desirable independence. And it
is only one of many features required in a Second
Chamber; yet it is the sole one that is guaranteed (and
not always that) by the hereditary system.
'This system is admittedly rotten, and the Select
Committee don't deny it. But they make no attempt
to provide a decent alternative. The furthest they go
is to say: 'There are at present about r>!K) of us. Not
every Peer is the depository of the Higher Wisdom.
We can only be sure of 330 as answering to this descrip-
tion. The rest had better go.''
But," I put in, "you forget the generous inclusion
(if no fewer than four Life-Lords (exclusive of the
Bench) to be created annually, with a limit of forty."
'True," replied PBEKDERBY; "I had forgotten that
bold and revolutionary proposal. But what are four or
even forty amongst all that multitude? Is this their
notion of correcting poor blood, however blue, by an
infusion of good blood, however red?
"And, even so, the selection of three out of every
four of these is to be confined to the Services—naval
military, bureaucratic, diplomatic, colonial — and to
M.P.s of long sitting. So that, outside these official
and political spheres, from the vast resources of intelll
gence and experience which happen to be engaged in
other useful fields of activity (exclusive of Church am
Bench), only one Commoner (all told) is to be electee
per in/ii n ia to the Upper Chamber on the pure grounc
of efficiency—Lord ROSEBERY'S own word in the old days
And when their number reaches the overwhelming
figure 10 wo shall have, to wait for somebody to die.
"And you will please notice that any Peer who, by
distinction or perseverance or good conduct, has riser
to the higher ranks in these Services which I have
named — an Admiral or a Lieutenant-General, for
instance—is to become ipso facto a Lord of Parliament
There are to bo 130 of these in addition to the 3(
elevated commoners drawn from official or political
sources. Well, I have nothing but respect, as you
know, for the Public Service, though I am told that
there are also unofficial methods of serving one's
country; but I doubt if a dear old Admiral (God bless
'em all!), who has spent his life on the high seas,
would, even if born to the Peerage, be the best possible
authority on matters of domestic legislation—the on\j
kind that he would be expected to handle, since his own
department is catered for elsewhere."
I hesitated to dam the flow of my friend's pellucid
eloquence, but I felt constrained to enter a protest
somewhere. "I half fear," said I, "that you are con-
genitally lacking in veneration for Nobility of Birth."
"I entertain no rooted objection," he replied, "to
a Peer as such. Ijc snobismr. a rcbours is just as
contemptible as the more usual kind. 1 would nol
permit any man's birth, however exalted, to stand in
his way. And I consider that the best suggestion made
by the Select Committee was the proposal to allow
ordinary Peers who have never sat in the Upper House
to sit in the Commons, if they can get themselves
elected to it. A sprinkling of this element might have
a salutary and humanizing effect upon the Lowei
Chamber, and tend to keep young fellows like Lort
WIXTERTON in check. And I would even admit a few
of them into the Upper House, where, of course, a
higher standard of deliberative intelligence is de
manded."
"And have you any scheme of your own?"'
ventured.
"Ah," replied PREXDKRRY, on a note of extreme
modesty, "I have never specialised in creative, or
even re-creative, art. Nor have I given, like the Selec
Committee, the best part of a year and a-half to the
solution of this conundrum. But, speaking always as
a child, I should like to see the members of the Seeom
Chamber selected in the same way as the members o
the Privy Council. I have noticed that the best men
sooner or later drift into this Order. Or, better stil
perhaps, the Privy Council might itself be responsibl
for the selection, making it a point of honour to earn
out this high duty without fear or favour or polities
prejudice, and solely on the. ground of efficiency—Lor*
ROSEBERY'S own word once more."

THE "USE AND NEED" OF
RELATIONS.
"How do you write an anony-
mous letter? " I asked, as I chewed
my pencil.
"" ' Sir,'" said Miss MIDDLETON,
"' or Madam. Beware, before it is
too late. What have you done with
the canary's cage? I know all.'
And you sign it 'THREE-FINGERED

"I shall sign mine 'HAMSTRUNG

like that, though? It isn't a bit
what I wanted to say."
"What did you want to say, and
who 's it to?"
"My relations," I sighed. "And
it 's about Christmas presents."
"Oh, it-hat are you giving them?
Do tell me. Guess what I 'in giving
ANNE. Oh no, you mustn't—I 'vc
just remembered what it is."
"You don't understand," I said,
rather annoyed. "It isn't what
I 'm giving them, but what they
ought to give me."
"Relations never give the right
things, anyhow."
"Exactly. Hence the anonymous
letter. 'Dear Madam,—A friend
wishes to warn you that your
favourite nephew wants a'
And so on. That might fetch them."
"What does her favourite nephew
want?"
"I want—oh, everything. But
what I really want," I added with a
rush, " is a set of waistcoat buttons,
and a copper kettle, and a music-
cabinet for keeping boots in."
"That seems reasonable enough,"
said Miss MIDDLKTON, after a mo-
ment's reflection. "If I had been
your aunt, that is just what I should
have thought of. Probably."
"I don't really want the music-
cabinot," I explained. "But every-
body tells me I do; and I know that
if I had it I should get into the way
of keeping my boots there, and leav-
ing the rolls on the top of the pianola
as usual. So I mentioned it. What
I really want in that Hue, of course,
is a music-stool. You see, when I
finish playing a piece, I want to twirl
round and say, ' Isn't that jolly? ' to
the people who are listening. And
they say, 'Awfully.' With a great
high-backed chair you can't do that,
and sometimes they forget to say
anything."
"I always say, 'A charming note
that last one, yes.'"
"And then I like them to see my
hack when I 'm playing, because of
the expression. I don't mean that I
put the expression in with my back,
but that that is where it shows. '. . .
Well, then we come to the waistcoat
buttons."
"What sort of buttons do you
want?"
I don't mind a bit," I said.
"But here I am, getting most fright-
fully old, and nobody has ever given
me a set of waistcoat buttons in my
life. It 's scandalous."
"You should buy a bone set, with
a waistcoat stitched on."
"I have often. But that doesn't
count. You must have them given
to you. Who do you think ought to
give them to me? I thought a
cousin."
"It would come rather nicely from
a cousin. Have you any?"
I took out my pocket-book.
"Six first, twelve second, and
seventeen third cousins."
"That makes eighty-one alto-
gether," said Miss MIDDLETON, after
a short silence.
"I always make it come to thirty-
five. Are you sure you 're right?"
"Eighty-one. That would be
thirteen and a,half to a button. Why,
they could do you a set of diamond
ones easily."
"Some of them I have never
seen," I said. "They might stand
out for mother-of-pearl. But, as I
say, I shouldn't mind that."
"Well, I think it 's disgraceful of
them. It isn't as though they could
pretend that they didn't know your
size."
"The truth is, I think, that they
aren't quite in touch with each other.
There is a feeling among them that
something should be done, only they
want somebody to give them a lead.
.... That 's why I thought /
would," I added.
"Well," said Miss MIDDLETON,
"there, still remains the copper
kettle."
"The copper kettle. I want that
for keeping my breakfast warm. At
present the hot water always goes
out—gets cold, I mean—before I 'm
up. If I had one. of those kettles
with dents all round it and a wick
underneath it would be so much
pleasanter. Who do you think ought
to give me that?"
"That 's really what you 'd call a
useful present, isn't it?"
"It can be. made very pretty if
they do the. dents right. They call
them Yuletide gifts in the shops."
"But I mean it would be good for
your health to have one."
"Indirectly I suppose it would.
Though I 've never heard anything
against cold tea."
"Because useful presents which
arc good for the health are generally
given by aunts."
"I have some aunts," I said.
"It would come best from a great-
aunt," said Miss MIDDLETON doubt-
fully.
I referred to my pocket-book.
"I 'm very sorry," I said, "but
we are quite out of great-aunts. We
have a very good line in sisters-in-law.
They think a lot of your health."
"Haven't you an old nurse?"
"I haven't a nurse at all."
"Then it will have to be an ordin-
ary aunt. The one you gave the
nicest, present. *^ last year. How
many Lave you?"
i\v<j. loudly two."
"There you are, then; the other
can give you the music-stool. Now
then, what did you give them?"
I coughed uneasily.
"It's—it's a little difficult to tell
you," I said. "It's—er—I could ex-
plain to a man easily enough. I mean
—of course—well .... Well, there 's
Aunt MAGGIE up in Aberdeen."
"Yes?"
"Yes. Well, I gave her one oi
those—you know, oblong things, with
sparkling things on them."
"Sort of brilliants?"
"Sort of, yes. And there was
some lettering on it. It was, Wish-
ing you the old, old wish, A Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Something like a Christmas-card—
only . . . well, yes."
"I see," said Miss MIDDLETON
gravely. "And Aunt JANE?"
"Aunt JANE in Edinburgh. Well,
hers was the same sort of thing, only
it had on it, Wishing you the old, old
wish, A Happy Christmas—a Happy
Christmas—and a—and a Merry New
Year."'
"I see," said Miss MIDDLETOX
again.
Of course I quite see what she
sees, but I think she 's wrong. Who
ever heard of a nephew giving his
aunt a music-stool? She couldn't
twirl round properly on it to begin
with. All the same, I think I shall
leave out the aunts when I send the
anonymous letter round, and concen-
trate on the cousins. Eighty-one
cousins—they want pulling together

to have said. He is a dear boy.
We look forward with pleasure to
further news from the Pantomime of

Austria, according to the Vienna
correspondent of the Petit Parisicn,
is to give Servia and Montenegro " a
lesson in the Spring.'' What is taking
place at present, we suppose, then,
is the preliminary Crouch.

A general Arbitration Treaty be-
tween Brazil and Argentine has
been signed and exchanged. Such a
treaty, we understand, would have
been entered into long ago had it not
been that the Republics were under
the impression that it might prevent
their going to war with one another.
Referring to the treatment meted
out to certain Suffragettes at the
Albert Hall, one of their number
states: '' We will not suffer these
things in silence." We have some-
times wondered whether the notori-
ously quiet methods of the Suffra-
gettes are really advisable, and we
are interested to hear that there is
now to be a change of policy.
***
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has never
been found lacking in personal
courage, and now he has delivered
himself of the following message:
"I am not an enthusiastic advocate
of woman suffrage, because I do
not regard it as a very important
matter." Still, this is not so daring
as it sounds, for TEDDY knows that
he will soon be beyond the reach of
Suffragettes, and safe among the
wild beasts of Africa.

"However much they may be
entitled to consultation and to give
us such advice and assistance as they
can," said Mr. SYDNEY BUXTON,
speaking at Millwall of the House
of Lords, "they ought not to be
allowed to stand for good in the way
of Liberal measures." "Stand for
good " was surely a slip.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
SERAPHIC "SOUL-BODIES."
THE now theory of Life after Death, recently ex-
pounded by Mr. FOUKNIER D'ALBE, B.Se., Secretary of
the Dublin Society of Psychical Research, to an
audience of Spiritualists in Suffolk Street, has naturally
excited considerable interest in both worlds. Mr.
D'ALBE, if correctly reported by the Press, maintains
that disembodied souls, or "soul-bodies," inhabit a
realm of the earth-atmosphere extending upwards for two-
hundred miles, and, subsisting as they do entirely on
sun-rays, require and possess uo digestive organs, and
have no need to compete for existence. Consequently
he holds that they are all " engaged only in cultivating
the higher virtues of
Justice, Kindness, and
Sympathy."
Mr. Ptincli, feeling
that it would be rash to
accept these views—
even on such scientific
authority as Mr.
FOURNIER D'ALBE'S—
without some confirma-
tion, lias instructed his
own Psychic Medium to
place himself under the
control of any floating
soul-bodies within the
two-hundred-mile radius
that might desire to
express an opinion on
the subject.
As will appear from the
following notes, auto-
matically taken by the
Medium himself in the
trance condition, the
seance proved remarkably
successful:
The First Soul-body
would rather not give the
name by which it was
known in life, but fur-
nished some clue to its
identity by mentioning
that the colour of its
beard had been a good
deal exaggerated. Knew
about Mr. D'ALBE'S
lecture, but was not
actually present. Had tried to get in, but only float-
ing-room for about four million souls. Hoped he would
choose the Albert Hall next time. Was in the dome
there last Saturday week, and deeply interested—
though it pained him to see so many charming ladies
losing their heads. Yes, ever since he had first entered the
earth-atmosphere had been ardent sympathiser with the
Women's Cause. Would like to see some reform of the
Marriage laws, which at present placed a wife too much
at the mercy of her husband. Was decidedly of opinion
that no doors should be closed to women. Disapproved
of flats- as domestic dwellings—not a decent-sized cup-
board in any of them!
A Soul-body, describing itself as having formerly
belonged to the late JUDGE JEFFREYS, said it had read
an account of Mr. D'ALBE'S address in the local
films. Mr. D'ALBE was a most ingenious honest gentle-
man, and many of his statements were fairly correct.
Marvellous, indeed, that he should know so much as
he did! He was somewhat out, however, in his esti-
mate of the extent of the radius, which, precisely
reckoned, was not above 173 miles 3
that was a small matter. As to

furlongs. But
himself, was
treatment of
Criminals. Would have them reformed not by im-
prisonment, but kindness. Capital punishment ineffec-
tive and barbarous, and should be abolished forthwith.
Still hung about the Assize Courts occasionally, but
horrified at abuse of cross-examination by certain
counsellors, and by severity of sentences from the
Bench. Had more than once felt constrained to pro-
test—but took nothing by his motion, except that Judpe
complained of icy draught
in court, and ordered all
windows to be closed.
Had no digestive organs
—but heart larger than
ever it had been.
The Soul-body of the
MARQUISE DE BRINVIL-
LIEUS said it had been
present at the Suffolk
Street meeting. Thought
M. D'ALBE extreme}/
sympathetic, and hsj
been moved to tears by
some of his so eloquent
periods. All that, for
example, of the persecu-
tion endured by those
poor ghosts who, from
motives of purest benevo-
lence, ventured to be-
come visible to mortals.
How touching, and how-
true! She who was
speaking had, only the
other evening, undergone
an experience of the most
disagreeable! She had
conceived it her duty to
appear to a certain of her
descendants, now dwell
ing in the quarter oi
Soho, and warn him
solemnly that the patc de
Pcrigord he was about to
partake of had so deterior
ated as to have become
positively unwholesome. "Ptomaines'?" She knew no'
that word; but it was always possible. Well, she ap
peared, then. Figure that her ungrateful kinsman, so fai
from appreciating the attention, had permitted himsel
to fling a small jar of French mustard through her head
But if she no longer possessed organs of digestion sh<
could still feel for those who did. Was it not desolating
to reflect that it was becoming almost impossible fo
poor human beings to procure food or drink which ha«
not been adulterated? Believe her, so long as sucl
unprincipled practices went unpunished except by fines
Society would suffer! On being questioned as t
whether she agreed or not with Mr. D'ALBE that th
Soul-body might become visible in ultra-violet light
would only say that she trusted he was mistaken
as it could not but be unbecoming to the complexion
of any person of quality.

announced himself as GUY FAWKES. Admitted that
he had not followed the proceedings of Parliament very
closely of late, so could not say when it was likely to be
dissolved. Was much more interested in the preserva-
tion of ancient monuments. Thought it a grievous
scandal that so many of our historic buildings should be
permitted to vanish with scarce a trace left to show
where they had once stood! Had endeavoured to save
the Great Wheel at Earl's Court, and sundry stately
palaces on a spot called Shepherd's Bush; but his efforts
had failed. All his efforts did, somehow. Had been
shamefully entreated not a great while since by a
pestilent manufacturer in the Midlands. The vile dog
was bent on overthrowing a colossal chimney of brick
that had been a noted landmark for nigh upon a cen-
tury; actually undermining it at the base! He himself
had been at great pains to prevent so foul a deed—
but all his hauntings and rappings and groanings had
been to no purpose, for the fellow had got him
exorcised! An unconscionable freedom to take with
any gentleman's soul! But what, to him, was most
intolerable, it had been performed by a minister of some
Nonconformist sect!
In token of his concern for the safety of the public,
he earnestly desired that letters be dispatched to the
authorities in every city warning them to keep good
watch. For it was within his knowledge that sundry
mean traders had—and that no longer ago than the
beginning of last month !—collected vast store of com-
bustibles and explosives—ay, and masks withal! With
what fell purpose he, being wholly ignorant of their
secret bloody designs, would not take upon him so much
as to conjecture; but this he might say: on his con-
science he believed that some ill plot was toward!
It is hardly necessary to point out how entirely these
communications support Mr. FOURNIER D'ALBE'S
theories. Still less to assure him that the Medium in
question is a gentleman who is absolutely incapable of
such a liberty as pulling anybody's leg. At all events,
Mr. Punch hopes so. F. A.
MR. PUNCH'S PAGEANT.
His compliments to his friends, and Mr. Punch does
not mind saying again, for it is quite true, that ho is
going to hold an Exhibition of himself. He has now
decided to be in the movement and call it a Pageant.
It will be distinguished from ordinary pageants both in
other respects and by the fact that it is to keep still.
Nevertheless, in point of sentiment, it will be the most
moving of spectacles. It opens on Saturday, January
2nd, 1909, at the Leicester Galleries, Leicester Square,
and proposes to stay there all the month. Mr. Punch
takes this opportunity of expressing his sincere thanks
to many kind people for the loan of original drawings,
manuscripts, letters and other precious relics associated
with his career.

THOSE MECHANICAL TOYS.
Fond Mamma. "WHAT! BROKEN ALREADY? IF I'D GIVEN IT TO YOUB FATHER INSTEAD, IT
WOULD HAVE KBIT HIM QUIET FOR 110URS!"
CHRISTMAS COOKERY.
SOME SEASONABLE SUGGESTIONS.
I.—CARDS.
TIIKSE form a welcome and dainty
addition to the Christmas morning
breakfast. To prepare, take two
plump robins (boned, so as to stand
in impossible attitudes), a church-
tower with bells, and holly to taste.
Season the whole with a couple of
cheap rhymes, and sprinkle thickly
with frost. Serve in half-sheet of
notepuper, "With best wishes from
all at Homeleigh," enclose in en-
velope, and garnish with pink stamp.
A more economical version of the
above omits the Best Wishes, and
garnishes with green stamp.
II.—WAITS.
Fill four throaty baritones and a
bass with either beer or whisky, as
preferred. Add a conductor, two
choir-boys, and a hazy recollection ol
Good King Wenceslas. Mix well,
and set aside to simmer. As soon as
slight fizzling noise makes itsell
audible, cold water should be freely
poured over the whole till this
ceases.
III.—ANNUALS.
These, though conventionally asso-
iated with Christmas, most fre-
quently make their actual appearance
at table towards the beginning of
autumn. The chief ingredients are
advertisements ad lib., which may
36 rendered fairly palatable by a
udicious admixture of pretty well
any old stuff you have left over.
Add a seasoning of turkeys and hunt-
:>alls, and colour as attractively as
possible. Served with special Pre-
sentation Plates, this economical
;rifle will be readily swallowed.
IV.—HUMORISTS.
These are certain to be in great
demand by hostesses who require
some inexpensive little extra to set
aefore their guests at the Christmas
dinner. As a relish to plum-pudding
and mince-pies nothing is so popular
as a nicely turned-out humorist. The
most usual kind, more than sufficient
for a party of twenty persons, is
generally stuffed with chestnuts, and
moistened with sweet champagne or
a little fruity port. Great care should
be exercised in serving, as sonie
humorists are apt to fall flat when
brought to table, in which case the
entire effect is ruined.
V.—THEATRICALS.
The Maugham shape, very popular
just now, is usually made with a
flavour of diluted Hawtrey. For
smaller parties the Hubert-Henry is
recommended. The author's fee is
either added at the last moment or
left out altogether.
From a College of Preceptors'
Junior Examination Paper :—
'Describe in ten or twelve lines of French

From an advertisement of Black-

"THE FINEST SKA IN F.UROPE.

This is a modest understatement.

pean ocean perform twice daily.

ESSFNCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY or TOBY, M.T.
House of Commons, Monday, De-
cember 1.—No one looking round
House whilst Questions were going
forward would irrmgine we are in
throes of Ministerial crisis, that
presently the PREMIER will make a
statement affecting existence of one
of principal measures of the Session,
possibly involving fate of the Govern-
ment. Benches only half filled.
Gaps on those whereon across the
Table Ministers and ex-Ministers
bend upon each other affectionate
regard. Amongst absentees at the
moment were the PREMIER and
PRINCE ARTHUR. By time Questions
were over and Orders of Day reached,
the Benches filled up, and a sprink-
ling of Peers was seen in gallery over
the clock. Still there was room for
all comers.
When at length Education Bill was
called on and House resolved itself
into Committee, there was a hush of
expectancy; but nothing approaching
that intense, almost breathless attitude
of waiting and listening familiar in
ordinary crises. The method studi-
ously adopted of finally disposing of
the Bill contributed to absence of
excitement. Last Friday PKKMIKII

move that the order for Committee

stage should be read and discharged.
This u procedure into which it would
be possible to import some passion
evoking demonstrations and counter-
demonstrations. On reflection, PRE-
MIER perceived a better way, more
consonant with his desire to avoid
anything like a scene. When the
cheers that greeted his appearance at
the Table subsided, he, addressing
the CHAIRMAN, remarked in quiet
tones, "I rise, Sir, for the purpose
of moving that you do now leave the
Chair."
One of the most commonplace
procedures of a day's sitting. It
means that the business immediately
in hand shall be postponed for a day
or a week, according to the most con-
venient arrangement of business.
The PREMIER having made an end
of speaking, PRINCE ARTHUR following
in brief speech set in minor key
skilfully struck, Mr. EMMOTT left the
Chair. The SPEAKER came in and
the next business on the Orders was
called on.
Though no formal declaration was
made, everyone knew that with the
emptying of the Chair at the Table
the life went out of the Education
Bill—
A Bill which there were none to praise
And very few to love.
The Licensing Bill, done to death in
the House of Lords, had, as FITZ-
MAURK'E remarked, a fine funeral. The
Education Bill died by automatic pro-
cess. It was not permitted even to
give an audible last gasp. Nor did
friendly hand close its eyes. It
simply disappeared from the scene
as part of the working of an ordinary
business procedure. The PREMIER'S
formal motion "that the CHAIRMAN
do now leave the Chair " was agreed
to without debate or division, and
since Mr. EMMOTT will never come
back to preside over Committee on the
Education Bill the measure is dead.
No flowers, by request.
Business done. — Education Bill
smothered in its cradle.
Tuesday.—LOULU, who has given
us a new dining-room, has added a
phrase to the Parliamentary vocabu-
lary. Heckled this afternoon by
Brother BOB, who wanted to know
why a room should be allotted to the
private use of the Chairman of Weleh
Liberal Members whilst Scotland
had none, the First Commissioner
cautiously replied that he did not
know on what, "if any," principle
his predecessors acted when they
made the allotment. Here BOWLES
JUNIOR nipped in with enquiry on
what principle the allotment was con-
tinued?
"On the general principle of con-
tinuity of policy," LOULU answered,
with a glance at the FOREIGN
MINISTER who chanced to be in his
place.
Brother BOB lengthening the
catechism by two other questions,

better have family notice of any
further enquiry."
"Family notice " is good, implying
among other conveniences a saving
of public time. True, opportunity
for use of expedient is not so wide in
present House as it was in its prede-
cessor. The electoral earthquake of
1906 shattered many family connec-
tions. Still there are cases where
brothers, or father and son, have
been returned, and the practice of
giving notice across the family break-
fast-table of intention to put a ques-
tion would in several cases—the
brothers WASON for example
—be a convenience.

itself as illustrating the

ASHLEY turned up as usual
with his volume of Mang-
nall's Questions. They num-
bered seven, printed consecu-
tively on the paper, and
were addressed to NAPOLEOX
B. HALDANE. Actually, by
most liberal computation,
there were only three sub-
jects dealt with. But ASII-
LKY, though comparatively
young in years, was not born
yesterday. If he followed the
ordinary practice of arrang-
ing his interrogationson a par-
ticular point in form of a single
question his opportunities of
putting supplementary ones
would be limited. Accord-

a slice of good luck. Having ex-
hausted his own opportunities, he was
voluntarily supplied by the SPEAKER
with a sixteenth! Hadn't anything

question would emerge.

The MEMBER FOR SARK notes in the
incident a departure from earlier
habit. Formerly, when Mr. Lrp
TON'S premises were invaded with
felonious intent, he was accustomet
to seize the burglar by the wrist anc
re-vaccinate him. This proved im
mediately effective and did something
to shake the Hon. Member's well-
known rooted antipathy to vaccina
lion. He admits that he knows no
single instance where a burglar so
treated was seen again or
the premises. At the same
time he denies that lymph,
whether drawn directly from
the calf or otherwise, did,
or could, serve any useful
purpose.
To avert inconvenient con-
troversy he has, SARK says,
for some years given up his
midnight practice. Now, as
he announces, if the burglar
will only go quietly away, he
may take with him what
he wants.

CRAIG in the honourable competition
for the distinction of putting in a

SCIENCE NOTES.
ARE OUR HEADS GROWING BIGGER?
(By our Hydroccphalous Expert.)
THE remarkable letter contributed
by Dr. BERNARD HOLLANDER to a
recent number of The Westminster
Gazette on the growth of the brain
and concomitantly of the skull has
caused great excitement in influen-
tial circles.
Dr. BERNARD HOLLANDER, who
claims the support of two Fellows of
the Royal Society, maintains that
the skull increases with the growth
of the brain, and that the brain con-
tinues to grow so long as it is actively
exercised. In this tremendous belief
he is fortified by the well-authen-
ticated cases of Mr. GLADSTONE and
an August Personage. To these cases
may be added others which have
come within our personal observation.
(1) An illustrious and world-re-
nowned novelist, whose resemblance
to a famous Elizabethan dramatist
has long been notorious, when he first
came to London used to wear a
6j-inch hat. Now no stock size will
fit him, and he has to have a con-
stant succession of new and ever-
larger hats made for him by the firm
of MAGNIFICO POMPOSO in Rome, who
build for the POPE and most of the
Curia.
But the novelist's expansion has
not been confined to his cranium.
His finely developed nether man
has assumed so much more opulent
dimensions of late that he is ad-
mittedly too big for his boots of
yesteryear.
(2) The peculiar headgear, sugges-
tive of a retired bath-chair proprietor,
affected by the youngest member of
the Cabinet has caused no little sur-
prise amongst his old brother-officers.
But the square-crowned bowler in
question is rendered necessary by
the extraordinary supra - temporal
development of the statesman's head,
which presents a most extraordinary
re-semblance to that of PERICLES
(compared by classical writers to a
sea-squill), and, growing as it does
in direct ratio with his unbridled
mental activity, is already beginning
to cause lively concern to his devoted
and affectionate colleagues. Indeed,
we have good reason to believe that
Dr. BERNARD HOLLANDER has of his
own initiative volunteered to remove
this gigantic cranial dome and supply
its place with a low-crowned roof of
aluminium, jewelled in six holes.
The only other alternative, that the
owner of this wonderful osseous
envelope should cease entirely from
mental activity, is one which his
colleagues are quite unable to con-
template without transports of
melancholia.
"A woman who can act and think for herself
is a treasure indeed."—Madame.
That so few of our women can act
and can think
Is a truth which we would not
endeavour to blink;
But we hold that a far more regret-
table fact
Is the number of women who think
they can act.

And fairy scenes beguile;
Not to enthral the house with
breathless stupor
At gags and garments of an olden

Do you lament, perchance, the fame

LEGWEAR DE LUXE.
FAMOUS ACTOR-MANAGER'S PRICELESS
COLLECTION.
MARVELLOUS as is the Bookman's
Paradise of Mr. PIERPONT MORGAN,
recently described by the American
correspondent of The Times, it is
but a jejune and pinchbeck exhi-
bition compared with the Sar-
danapalian splendour of the great
Sartorial Pleasure Dome of Mr.
GEORGE ALEXANDER. Hitherto only a
few of Mr. ALEXANDER'S friends have
been admitted to inspect the ineffable
glories which lie enshrined within the
famous chryselephantine gates, and
this is positively the first account
that has ever appeared in print of
what is undoubtedly the finest collec-
tion of legwear in this or any other
world. Indeed it has been wittily
described as the "Nethermost
Heaven of Sartoriculture."
Entering the great gates already
alluded to, probably the finest extant
specimen of the work of PHEIDIAS, one
is struck by a magnificent porphny
cabinet containing a priceless collec-
tion of frock-coats dating back to the
Noachian epoch. In the centre oi
the hall, which is hung with green
Flemish tapestry, is a superb life-size
model of BEAU BRUMMEL. A chalce-
dony rack in an alcove on the right
contains one hundred and twelve
clouded canes, while a superb cabinet
with crystal doors is all ablaze with
scarves of every conceivable hue and
pattern.
But the outer hall gives only a
faint idea of the indescribable glories
of the inner treasure-house, which is
exclusively devoted to the choicest
specimens of nether integuments.
Passing through a lapis-lazuli door
one is confronted by a colossal statue
of ALEXANDER THE GREAT arrayed in
faultless vicuna trousers. A huge
wardrobe of ebony and gold illus-
trates the evolution of this indis
pensable garment from the primitive
braccae of the Roman provincial down
to the latest creation of Bond Street
arranged i:i thirty asbestos shelves.
Even more wonderful is the fabulou!
collection of trouser-stretchers, rang
ing from the rude stone slabs usei
by neolithic man to the Gutenberg
Trouser Press, the Wynken d<
Worde Trouser Press, the famous
Caxton Trouser Press, and culmin
ating in the marvellous hydrauli
press invented by Lord ALTHORP, am
capable of reducing the most amor
phous leg-wear to absolute symmetry
in ten seconds.

Hall is the inmost Sartorial sanctum

a bomb-proof chamber panelled in
platinum and containing the choicest
treasures of Mr. ALEXANDER'S soul-
shaking collection. These are nothing
less than a number of historic nether
garments worn by famous, notable
or notorious personages. To give a
complete list would tax our space too
severely; but it must be a source of
national satisfaction to know that
while so many other inestimable
relics have crossed the Atlantic it
has been the privilege of Mr. ALEX-
ANUEH to keep in this country—
1. The favourite pantaloons of
"Old Q."
2. A pair of kerseymere knee-
breeches worn by WILUERFORCE.
3. A pair of trousers in MARTIN
TUHPER'S earliest manner.
4. Pair of ditto, worn by the Poet
Laureate at the opening of the
Crystal Palace.
5. Pair of knickerbockers worn by
Mr. HALL CAINE on the occasion of
his first speech in the House of

6. Pair of nainsook pyjamas worn
by PORFIRIO DIAZ, the President of
Mexico.
7. Pair of check trousers, peg-top
pattern, formerly the property of the
late Mr. TRACY TUKNEHELLI.
8. Pair of running shorts worn by
DORANDO PIETRI in the Marathon
Race.
9. Pair of accordion - pleated
bloomers from the wardrobe of the
late Dowager-Empress of CHINA.
10. Pair of trews in which ROBERT
BURNS composed Scots irha hoc.
11. Pair of Scotch plaid trousers in
which CARLYLE wrote the greater part
of Sartor Resartus.
12. Pair of Carthaginian trouser-
loons in which HANNIBAL is believed
to have crossed the Alps.
And 13 is a special moth-proof
boudoir, which is in reality a steel
safe, with three hundred and thirty
pairs of trousers worn by Mr. ALEX-
ANDER himself as Aubrey Tanqueray
during the run of Mr. PIXERO'S
famous play.
We have said enough to show that
to be permitted the privilege of
entree to Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER'S
collection is a liberal education. Mr.
ALEXANDER, with the assistance of
the Rev. Dr. KINO, who acts as his
chief valet and is Keeper of the Pressed
Trousers, has, however, for some
time been busily engaged on a Cata-
logue raisonne of his possessions,
most sumptuously embellished with

HE is rather small for his age,
slim, and with an appearance that
one would call "nervy." He does
very little for me, but I keep him
partly because I have a genuine
affection for him, partly because
most men in the Temple enjoy the
services (such as they are) of one of
his class, but mostly because he
possesses in a marked degree those
two characteristics which go to make
the ideal servant—ubiquity find un-
oblrusivoness. He is always there
in case he is wanted, but never in
the way. He is perhaps too modest;
but it must also be said that he leads
the idlest of lives. His handwriting
is so abominable that T cannot entrust
my correspondence to him, and if I
ask him to do any odd jobs they
are usually badly done.
He has the annoying habit of
drumming his fingers on tables and
desks, a sure sign of the idler.
However, although he could hardly be
called my right hand in business, 1
should be genuinely sorry to lose him.
Perhaps I ought to have mentioned
at the outset that I am referring to
my left hand.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A DISMAL home; a situation that one would like to call
impossible; a woman with the long-suffering strength
only weak women possess; a man she has wronged
and been wronged by; and her son. These make up
the drama of ANNE SEDGWICK's new novel Amabel
Channicc (ARNOLD). The author of Valeric Upton
has not lost her cunning. Her characters, few
but convincing, are alive; though unpleasant, the}
are real. Yet one may perhaps doubt whether the
husband, a man of thirty-two, would have gone
about his courting in so paternal a fashion; and the
son would be better if he were less of a prig. A young
man who analyses the feelings of love by introspectioi
and backs his sentiments with quotations from HEGEL
may- be as clever
as he will, but he
is already far on
the road to be-
come u bore of

time to his
mother. Prob-
ably no other
woman whom he
came across
would think it
worth while to
disturb the idvll.
lives to hunting up trails. The latest and by no means
the least weighty contribution to the solution of flie
problem is from the pen of Monseigneur BARNES.
The title of the book, The Man of the Mash
(SMITH, ELDEK), is significant. Amongst other dis-
coveries, Monseigneur has come upon the fact that the
mask was not of iron, but of velvet. The wearing of it was
not an addition to punishment, but merely a means of
preventing recognition. Various persons have been
named by earlier explorers as being the masked prisoner.
That he was a twin-brother of Louis THE FOURTEENTH
was a dramatic fancy that long moved the world. A
better reasoned though less picturesque explanation
pointed to MATTHIOLI, agent of the Duke of MANTUA,
who got the better of Louis THE FOURTEENTH in a
secret treaty, for "the purchase of the fortress of Casale.
Monseigneur BARNES has a novel theory to advance.
Behind the velvet mask he sees the face of a son of
- CHARLES THE
SECOND, the issue
of a liaison with
a Jersey lady of
good family. The
theory is sup-
ported by the mar-
shalling of much
evidence and the ,
exercise of con-
siderable dialec-
tical ingenuity.

As Mr. A. S.
M. Hl'Tt'lllNSiiN
points out, <>nt:i:

L u g <j i' r, taken
from that dash-
i n g sentiment
"Once aboard

the girl is rnii 10,"
jiiigH be considered a generic title for all novels.
Certainly there is no specific mention of any lugger in
his book (ALSTON HIVERS), excepting in the "Author's
Advertisement." But there is specific mention of other
things equally good. There is Mr. Marrapit, who,
according to tiie eye which beheld him, was like " one of
the minor prophets—shaved," and had every inch of
his garden searched because a threepenny-piece had
been dropped. There is Mm. Major, his companion,
that masterly woman. There are George and his Mary,
the people of the story, and very nice people, too—
particularly Mnry. And many more, from Mr. David
Brungcr, detective, to The Eoife of Sharon, cat. They
are all cleverly drawn, and for the most part sufficiently
true to life to compel belief in them, however prepos-
terous the circumstances in which the author's very
pleasant humour lands them.
REPUTATIONS.-IV.
NlMROD.
The Story of the Man in the Iron Mask holds its
own among the, world's mysteries. Since VOLTAIRE'S
lime, it has been discussed by a shifting company of
writers who have devoted an appreciable portion of their possessors of The Modern Child.
To the thou-
sands whose
thoughts at this
season are busy
with children no
better service can
be done than to
commend to them
The Modern
Child (FouLis),
compiled by HER-
VEY ELWES. II
is an anthology o;
verse and prose
about children
but it is some
thing more, too, than a mere anthology. It is informed with
a definite purpose to present the innumerable, wayward
graceful, joyous, sorrowful, and even the mischievouslj
playful aspects of a child's nature. Thought and under
standing, and, what is even more important, a serious
and delightful tenderness, have, gone to the making o:
this pleasant half-crown's worth. Many writers have
been laid under contribution, and all of them, I may
say, are benefited by their inclusion in Mr. ELWE
list. Every extract has its place in the general scheme
as containing some thought that throws light upon
its subject. Mrs. ALLEN HARKER'S "Foreword
strikes exactly the right note — though by a venia
lapse she robs the late Mr. WAUGH of his true name
BENJAMIN, and presents him as the Reverend AHTHCB
WAUGH. I am sure the real Mr. ARTHUR WAUGH cannot
feel aggrieved at this added imputation of excellence
At any rate Mrs. HARKER makes no mistake in her
pretty reference to Mr. Punch. Mr. Punch loves chil
dren, and on his behalf 1 make bold to urge all other
lovers of children and students of their ways to become

[Tho PRIME MINISTER, having sounded from the National Liberal Club

mencement of hostilities not yet fixed), has declared his intention of
taking no cognisance of the Report of the Select Committee on the
Reform of the Upper House.]
Go home and pause a little while, O Peers;
Not to indulge in festal mirth that cheers
The innocent heart and eye;
But to review your vicious past, and heave,
Like sinful soldiers on the battle's eve,
A penitential sigh.
Penance you 've done already of a sort:
Worn sackcloth (vide ROSEBERY'S Report)
O'er vests of silken stuff;
Poured on your polls a thimbleful of ash,
And flicked your shoulders with a velvet lash
(Not on the actual buff);
But naught avails a purge so mild and bland,
Or that you volunteered to go and stand
In corners, face to wall,
Saying, " Though we have acted far from ill,
Yet at a pinch we might do better still;"
This is no use at all.
For there is one whose higher wisdom means
To smash you into little smithereens
When it shall please his whim;
Meanwhile, whatever private pains you take
To mend your naughty habits, it will make
No difference to him.
You may reform or not, let loose or curb
Your Titan passions—you will not disturb
His poised Olympian breast;
But in his own good time he '11 fix your fate,
Choosing, without consulting you, the date
That suits his book the best.
Forth from The Club his bugle-call has gone;
The charge itself will follow later on—
How soon, you mustn't know;
So to your prayers against that awful day
Whose whenabouts he can't himself foresay,
Not to a year or so. O. S.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE FOR CHRISTMAS.
IT is often a difficult matter to know what to give
one's friends in the way of presents at this season. It
occurred to us that it might help our readers to solve
the annual problem if we invited a number of well-known
people, to say what /7(fi/ personally would like to have.
Here are some of the replies which have not yet come

MR. AsguiTH.—" I should like above all things a
really good model of the House of Lords with all the
Unionist Peers in their places. With this and a coal-
hammer I think I could spend a very happy time."

DISCU RSIONS.
CASUAL CRANKS.
"IT 's a rum thing," said the pale young stockjobber,
what funny chaps you come across now and then in
a train. And, what 's more, you never see 'em again—
just get one talk with 'em and then they vanish away as
if they 'd never been there, and leave you wondering
what 's become of 'em. Some of 'em may be escaped
loonies, and I daresay the keepers catch 'em after a bit,
but I don't know. They look all right and they talk all
right most of the time, but then something starts "em
off, and you get left.
"Now last week there was a respectable old fellow
sitting where 3^011 're sitting. He 'd got on a frock-coat
which had seen some service—shiny, you know, in the
cuffs and elbows—but his hat wasn't so bad, and there
was a pearl pin in his black tie, and he 'd got grey
whiskers and a pair of spectacles—quite a benevolent-
looking old buffer. He had a whole lot of newspapers
with him, and he was reading them all through in double
quick time, galloping over the pages like a two-year-old.
He was finished with six of 'em before I 'd been through
half a page of my halfpenny rag. I guessed he must be
a literary gent or some genius of that sort by the war
he wont on. They all dash at it like that. I Ve
seen 'em.
"Well, the train hadn't been going more than five
minutes or so before he 'd done with his newspapers and
crumpled 'em up and chucked 'em out of the window.
Then he sat up very straight and beat his arms across
his chest like a cabman five or six times, and at last he
took his topper off his head, looked at it in a sorrowfu
kind of way, and before you could say ' Knife ' he 'd pul
his old fist through the crown with a bang like a pistol
I never got such a start in my life.
"I suppose he saw I was a bit alarmed, for he smilet
at me and said in a very solemn way, ' I apologise, Sir
I ought to have warned you. But you will admit tha
a man in my position must do something to show hit
quality.' I said I supposed he must, and it didn'i
matter so long as it was his hat and not mine. 'Ha
ha,' he laughed, ' very good, very good. Of course you
know that in our line of life we do that kind of thing
The GERMAN EMPEROR, for instance: he always polishes
off four hats a day, winter and summer, and the KING
OF SPAIN sometimes gets as high as six. Personally
never do more than three. It 's my Tartar ancestry,
fancy.'
"I didn't quite know what to say, but I thought i
best to keep joking him, so I asked him if three hats a
day wasn't a shade expensive even for a man who 'd go
a Tartar ancestry. 'Sir," he said, 'you are pleased t<
be facetious; but a Tsar can afford to be generous.' '/
Tsar?' I said. 'Yes,' he said, 'I am the TSAR OF ALL
THE RUSSIAS; but I tell you this only on condition tha

never forgive me. She can't bear Russians, so you 'i
easily understand why I don't want her to know.
shall have to break it to her, I suppose, when we go
back to the Winter Palace, but till then, mind, it 's a
dead secret.' Just then the train pulled up at Ealing
and he got out. A queer old scarecrow he looked in hi
crumpled hat, but he gave up his ticket just like any
one else.

I should have thought this was about enough, but I
got another startler on Saturday, when I wan going down
to stay with WKLSFORD for the week-end. At one of the
stations n chap came rushing up the platform and
tumbled himself into my carriage. He wore a brown
soft hut and a brown velveteen Knickerbocker suit with
yellow gaiters. In fact he looked as if he 'd got gaiters
all over him—you know the sort. There was a wild
look in his eye, and as soon as he 'd got his breath he
started talking about fifty to the dozen. I never heard
such rot in my life—all about the rights of humanity
and men being more valuable than pheasants, and what
were we ull going to do when the poor realised their
power and tried to get back a bit of their own, and
wouldn't it be a funny sight for us aristocrats to see our
heads tumbling into the guillotine-basket, and so on.
I never heard a chap in gaiters talk like that before, but
lie didn't seem to want me. to answer him, which was
lucky. He did his own answering, and took jolly good
care to make himself come out all right, you bet.
"At last ho seemed to run dry, and after he 'd
stopped a bit he looked at me and said, 'Do you know
whom you've been talking to?' 1 hadn't got a word
in, you know, but I didn't worry about tlmt. I said
No, I didn't know who he was. 'Ah,' he said, 'you
don't know, don't you? Well, I 'm not sure if I ought
to tell you. Better perhaps to leave you in ignorance.
You '11 simply hate me if 1 tell you who I am.' I said
I 'd risk it; but he wouldn't speak again for a long time,
and you 'd hardly believe it, he 'd got tears trickling
down his cheeks. 'It 's dreadful," he said,. ' to be hated

"I give you my sacred word of honour I 'd never

didn't mind a bit. He looked disappointed, but he
pulled himself together and said I was the first person
he 'd ever met in whom he hadn't inspired horror and
he 'd never forget it. It would make his path in life
much easier, he said. When I got out at Brinkley he
shook hands with me and asked me to keep a kind

games and sing their little songs, and
the birds roosted or sheltered in its
branches. Now and then the
squirrels frolicked there.
But the tree, although everything
was so happy in its surroundings,
was not satisfied. It longed to be
something else. It longed to be, as
it said, important in the world.
"Well," said the next tree to it,
"you will be important; we all
shall. Nothing is so important as
the mast of a ship."
But the tree would not have it.
"The mast of a ship!" he said.
"Pooh! I hope to he something
better than that."
Every year the surveyors came and
marked a number of the taller trees,
and then wood-cutters came and cut
them down and lopped off their
branches and dragged them away to
the shipbuilders. The tree watched
them go with disdain.
And then one day the surveyor
crime and made a mark on our tree.
"Ha! ha!" said a neighbour,
"now you 're done for."
But the tree laughed slyly. "I
know a better trick than that," he
said, and he induced a squirrel to
rub off the mark with his tail, so that
when the. wood-cutters came ho was
not felled after all.
"Oh," said the swallows when
they came back next year, "you
here still?"
"Surely," said the tree, con-
ceitedly. "They tried to get me.
but I was too clever for them."
"But don't you want to be a
mast," they said, " and hold up the
sails of a beautiful ship, and swim
grandly all about the seas of the
world, and lie in strange harbours,
and hear strange voices?"
"No," said the tree, " I don't. I
dislike the sea. It is monotonous.
I want to assist in influencing the
world. I want to be important."
"Don't be so silly," said the
swallows.
And then the tree had his wish,
for one day some more wood-cutters
came; but, instead of picking out the
tall trees, as they had been used to,
they cut down hundreds just as they
came to them.
"Look out," said the swallows.
"You '11 be cut down now whether
you want it or not."
"I want it," said the tree. "I
want to begin to influence the
world."
"Very well," said a wood-cutter,
"you shall," and he gave the trunk
a great blow with his axe, and then
another and another, until down it
fell.
"You won't be a. mast;-" he
added, "never fear. Nothing so
useful! You 're going to make
paper, my friend."
"What is paper? " asked the tree
of the swallows as they darted to
and fro over its branches.
"We don't know," they said,
"but we '11 ask the sparrows."
The sparrowo, who knew, came and
told the tree. "Paper," they said,
"is the white stuff that men read
from. It used to be made from
rags; but it "s made from trees now
because it 's cheaper."
"Then will people read me?"
asked the tree.
Yes," said the sparrows.
The tree nearly fainted with
rapture.
"But only for a few minutes,"
added the sparrows. "You 're going
to be newspaper paper, not book
paper."
"All the same," said the tree, " I
might have something worth reading
on me, mightn't I? Something
beautiful or grand."
"You might," said the sparrows,
"but it isn't very likely."
Then the men came to haul the
tree away. Poor tree, what a time
it had! It was sawed into logs, and
pushed, with thousands of others,
into a pulping machine, and the sap
oozed out of it, and it screamed with
agony; and then by a dozen different
processes, all extremely painful, it
was made into paper.
Oh, how it wished it was still grow-
ing on the hillside with the sun and
the rain, and the. children at its foot,
and the birds and squirrels in its
branches. "I never thought the
world would be like this," it said.
And the other trees in the paper all
around it agreed that the world was
an over-rated place.
And the tree went to sleep and
dreamed it was a mast, and woke up
crying.
Then it was rolled into a long roll
five miles long and put down into the
hold of a ship, and there it lay all
forlorn and sea-sick for a week. A
dreadful storm raged overhead—the
same wind that had once tried its
strength on the hillside—and as they
heard it all the trees in the paper
groaned as they thought of the life of
the forest and the brave days that
were gone.
The worst of it was the roll in
which our tree lay was close by the
foot of the mast, which came through
the hold just here, and he found that
they were old friends. The mast
said he could think of no life so
pleasant as that of a mast. "One
has the sun all day," he said, " and
the stars all night; one carries men
and merchandise about the world;
one lies in strange harbours and sees
strange and entertaining sights. One
is influencing the world all the time."
At these words the tree wept
again. But he made an effort to be
comforted. "You wouldn't sug-
gest," he inquired timidly, "that a
mast was as important, say, as a
newspaper?"
The mast laughed till he shook.
"Well, I like that," he said.
"Why, a newspaper—a newspaper
only lasts a day, and everything in
it has to be corrected on the day
after! A mast goes on for years.
And another thing," he added,
"which I forgot: sometimes the
captain leans against it. The cap-
tain! Think of that."
But the tree was too miserable.
In the harbour it was taken out of
the ship and flung on the wharf, and
then it was carried to the warehouse-
below a newspaper office in London.
What a difference from Newfound-
land, where there, was air and light.
Here it was dark and stuffy, and the
rolls talked to each other with tears
in their voices.
And then one night the roll in
which our poor tree found himself
was carried to the printing-rooms and
fixed in the press, and down came
the heavy, messy type on it, all black
and suffocating, and %vhen the tree
came to itself in the light again it
was covered with words.
But, alas! the sparrows were
right, for they were not beautiful
words or grand words, but such
words as, "Society Divorce Case,"
and "Double Suicide at Margate,"
and " Will it be fine at Christmas?"
and " Bankruptcy of Peer's Cousin,"
and "Burglary at Potter's Bar,"
and "Indian Sedition."
"Oh, dear," sighed the tree as it
realised what it was bearing on its
surface, "how I wish I had gone to
sea as I was meant to do! And he
vowed that if ever he got out of this

dreadful life he would never be head-
strong again. But alas!
Then, cut and folded, it was, with
others like it, carried away in the
cold, grey morning to a railway-
station, and put in the train and
rattled off to a bookstall in the West,
and a man bought it for a halfpenny
and read it all through, and said
there was nothing in it, and threw
it under the seat, and later another
man found it and read it, and blew
choking tobacco over it, and then
wrapped up some fish in it, and took
it home to his family. All that
night it lay scrunched up on the floor
of a squalid house, feeling very faint
from the smell of fish, and longing
for Newfoundland and the sun and
the rain, and the children and the
birds.

[DECEMBER 23, 1908.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UNGRATEFUL GUESTS.
PEKSONALLY, I aui all for keeping up old customs, and,
ever since our marriage some eight years ago, AGATHA
and I have made an annual practice of inviting our
nearest relations, a few old friends, and others who might
or might not come under that category, to assemble
round the board of our modest Hat in Fulham, and par-
take of our cheer on Christmas Day.
I will not pretend that these gatherings were ever
pervaded by the spirit of rollicking mirth that is tradi-
tionally associated with the Festive Season. But that
was no fault of ours. We invariably found that the sort
of people we should have liked to get—brilliant conver-
sationalists who could be relied upon to keep the table
in a continuous ripple, if not an absolute roar, of laughter
—were prevented from coming to us by some previous
engagement.
Consequently wo had to fall back upon those who
were unlikely to be in any social demand. And I give
you my word entertaining them was collar-work, and
no mistake, from start to finish! Nothing but a strong
sense of what was expected of us would have enabled me
to go en with it, year after year, as I did—and really,
after what occurred on the last occasion it is hardly
surprising that I have decided to abandon all such
hospitality for the future! Here is the list of the guests
AGGIE and I received on that memorable evening: My-
Uncle POLKINGHORN, who in the endeavour to reconcile
dyspeptic tendencies with the pleasures of the table has
embittered a temper which—so at least I have been
credibly informed—was originally genial, if not sunny;
AGGIE'S great-aunt GRIZEL, who, as she will tell you her-
self, has outlived all her happiness and whose thoughts
dwell chiefly on the dead past; a second cousin of mine,
BKASLKY SOWERBUTTS, about as unsociable and cantan-
kerous a beggar as you 'd come across in a day's inarch;
Miss AUSTERBURY, who was once AGGIE'S governess, and
still preserves traces of the terror she must have been
in her prime; old Mr. ADDLESIIAW, whom T can just
remember as a chirpy and well-preserved bachelor with
a never-failing flow of jest and repartee—though I can
never get AGATHA to believe it; MARIANA MOTE, who is
generally understood to be still brooding over a disap-
pointment sustained in early youth; and an old school-
fellow of mine, SHRIVENHAM PAI>P, who has been heavily
handicapped by his increasing liability to nervous
breakdown.
The above, together with the wife and self, little
FREDA and FHANKIE (our two twinnies), and MAMSELL
SCHLUMPFF, a young lady froin Zurich who is instructing
them on the mutual system in colloquial French, made
up our circle of twelve at dinner last Christmas Day.
And, now I have introduced them, I should like to
ask just one question: Do they strike you as the kind of
party whose conversational resources you could trust to
show no signs of exhaustion throughout a somewhat
lengthy repast? If they do, all I can say is that my
own previous experience of them had led me to a very
different conclusion. I knew that the removal of the
turkey was only too apt to plunge them into a general
torpor which the pudding would rather deepen than
dispel. So perhaps you may understand now how
eagerly I should welcome any expedient that might serve
to introduce a note of gaiety into the proceedings at this
critical stage.
It seemed to me one evening in the first week of
December that I had come across just the very thing
for the purpose. I had left the office earlier than usual,
as AGATHA had reminded me that morning to be sure to
be home in time to stir our Christmas pudding, for luck.
As I passed a fancy stationer's window on mj
way I caught sight of a card, to which was attached
a variety of small silver articles, half-a-dozen in all.
There were a miniature merrythought (an emblem ol
"good fortune "), a reduced facsimile of a threepenny-
bit (signifying "riches "), a fascinating little bell (a
symbol for something I have forgotten), a tiny ring,
which indicated marriage within the next twelvemonth
and a Lilliputian thimble and button, implying spinster-
or bachelorhood for a corresponding period.
These I found were intended for insertion in the
Christmas pudding, and would obviously, when dis
interred, furnish ample occasion for innocent amusemenl
and badinage. They were quite a novelty, and I was told
there had been an enormous sale for them. Being
greatly taken with the idea, I purchased a card which,
the complete set being only one-and-ninepence, I did
not regard as an unjustifiable extravagance under the
circumstances, though as I neared home it occurred to
me that AGGIE might very possibly do so. However, as
only Cook was present when I went into the kitchen to
perform my part in the ceremony, I was able to stir tin'
little symbols well into the rich mass of pudding without
interference. Cook is a sensible, elderly woman of few
words, and quite understood that there was no occasion
to mention the matter, as I intended it to be a surprise
on Christmas Day. And of course I knew that Aor.iv.
would be the first to approve if it turned out the success
I anticipated.
Well, when Christmas Day came round and we sat
down to dinner I congratulated myself more than ever
on my foresight, for our guests seemed in even lower
spirits than on previous occasions. Most of them prc
ferred lithia or barley-water to the champagne I had
provided, and I have noticed that tongues do not become
so readily loosened on non-alcoholic beverages. But I
am bound to say that when Aunt GRIZEL did become
more animated, sho kept the ball rolling at my own end
of the table by giving us a long description of the dis
graceful manner in which some local undertaker had
mismanaged her second husband's interment.
So, as she is given to resent being interrupted, it
happened that the pudding had not only been brought
in, but cut up and handed round before I got a chance ol
securing the ear of the table. And even then they
appeared to think I was joking when I inquired which
of them had found the merrythought—for there was r.o
response except from little FRANKIE, who informed me
that only chickens had merrythoughts, not puddings.
"This pudding has, though, my boy! " I said. "Ask
Uncle if ho 's found it yet "—(for Uncle POLKINGHORN
was consuming pudding with the same sombre indiffcr
cnce to consequences as the others). "I hope he has,
I 'm sure, for it will bring him luck through the whole
year!" I understood my Uncle to reply from the other
end that if he had discovered any such fragment in his
portion of pudding he would have taken care to mention
it at once.
At this of course I explained, describing each symbol
and its significance, so that they could be instaiith
recognised, and I saw that my words had produced an
effect which surprised even myself. Those guests who luul
not already consumed their slices began at once to search
for symbols among the fragments, and seemed really dis-
appointed at their want of success. Uncle. PoLKiNciiio
was keener than anybody, for he actually insisted thai
the remainder of the pudding should be distributed ami

subjected to a careful analysis, which was done accord-

with breathless suspense, I encouraging them to perse-
vere by assurances that the tokens were bound to turn
up, as I had stirred them well into the pudding with my
own hand. However, not a single one of them did turn
up, and I was just about to remark how odd it was, when
the solution of the mystery flashed suddenly upon me.
All these little silver souvenirs must have been
embedded in the first helpings, in which case—well, it
was only one more illustration of the disadvantages of
bolting one's food! Owing to their lack of ordinary self-
restraint they had missed all the opportunities for harm-
less fun which I had so carefully provided. The
trouble and expense I had gone to were simply thrown
away! Annoyed as I was, I was just debating with
myself whether it would not perhaps be in better taste
to say nothing more about it, when I became painfully

As ho has taken occasion already to observe, it is no
ordinary pageant at which Mr. Punch's friends will have
the opportunity of assisting on the opening day, Satur-
day, January 2nd, 1909, and throughout the month, at
the Leicester Galleries, Leicester Square. Those who
have not read his previous announcements on the sub-
ject will perhaps kindly read this one. Mr. Punch
would like to add that he is just as grateful as he was
last week to the many kind people who have lent him
original drawings, manuscripts, letters and other
precious relics of his past.
In its legal answers to correspondents The Yorkiltm
Post solves the great question as to what happens
"when a man dies intestate, his widow having pro-
deceased him." The answer is actually addressed to
"Harrogate," but in case there are others interested
in this obscure problem we recommend them to the
columns of our contemporary.

FICTION becoming so rapidly the
only form of literary nourishment
that many persons sit up to take, the
editors of London have realised that
they must either have feuilletons or
be lost. Arrangements have there-
fore been made by a number of what
might be called unlikely papers to
provide suitable novels for their
readers. A few specimen chapters
and synopses from these have been
sent to Air. Punch by way of adver-
tisement (although lie carefully
omits, in the new manner, any refer-
ence to that circumstance), and he
has pleasure in beginning with an
extract from the serial to he
expected in Tlic Spectator:—
THE DOOM OF THE STOMACH-

A FREE FOOD ROMANCK
BY
LORD GEORGE HAMILTON AND HAROLD
Cox.
Principal Characters:
Sir HUGO DUMPER, M.P. Free Trade
Unionist and owner of a private
menagerie of highly - cultured
animals.
YlLLlERS ColtDEN DUMPER, his SOD.
EASTIA DUMPER, his daughter.
BEETHOVEN, a Persian Cat.
Lord HENRY CIIAPPERUN, third son
of the Duke of DOLES, and Presi-
dent of the Tariff Reform
League.
LEONE MAXIXE, a Polish desperado
and President of the Con-
federates.
JOHN FLAMES, M.P., nn anti-Socialist
Radical.
SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.
Sir HUGO DUMPER, a high-minded
and prosperous Free Trade Unionist
and lover of animals, has recently
succeeded to a magnificent estate in
the neighbourhood of Slagville, the
borough for which Lord HENRY
CiiAPi'ERLiN is the Tariff Reform can-
didate. Lord HENRY is in love with
BASTIA DUMPER, who, however, de-
clines to encourage his addresses
unless and until (1) he abandons the
heresy of Protection; ('2) admits the
identity of Preference and Socialism;
(3) joins a rifle club; (4) declares
against woman suffrage; (5) promises
to communicate to Tlic Spectator all
instances of the sagacity of her
favourite Persian cat, Beethoven (so
called from his indulgence in moon-
light sonatas).
At this juncture Sir HUGH DUMPER
gives a great garden-party to all the
Free Fooders in the country, and at
the height of the festivity BASTIA
discovers the presence of a number
of the Confederates, a dangerous
Secret Society organised for the
assassination of the members of the
Cobden Club.
CHAPTER V.
Scarcely had BASTIA recovered
from the shock of this appalling dis-
covery when Lord HENRY, emerging
from the laurel bush with his accus-
tomed grace, exclaimed, "My dear
Miss BASTIA, this is indeed a fair
cop."
A happy thought occurred to the
dauntless girl. "Wouldn't you like
to see father's trained zebras'.' " she
asked with a winning smile.
"Delighted, I am sure," replied
the susceptible nobleman who suf-

-fered himself to be led to the pad-
dock in which the z.ebras were
incarcerated.
Entertaining him with witty anec-
dotes of the extraordinary sagacity
of these intelligent quadrupeds—one
of which had learned to go down on
its knees at the mention of the name
of BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH—BASTJA
engaged her formidable antagonist,
while her brother, single-handed, set
to work to unmask the Confederates
who, disguised as Free Trade tin-plate
manufacturers, were already marking
down their prey. Foremost in this
nefarious task was LEONE MAXIXE,
notorious even at the London School
of Economics for his sinister appear-
ance and atrocious opinions. With
blazing eyes, a raven moustache and
a stentorian baritone voice, LEONE
had long been the bete noire of the
DUMPER household, and the know-
ledge that he had penetrated into
the midst of their happy home filled
BASTIA with ineffable dread. But
the stars in their courses as well as
the stripes of the zebras were fight-
ing on her side. Scarcely had they
entered the paddock when the most
dangerous of these animals, over-
hearing Lord HENRY inadvertently
refer to Mr. BONAR LAW, broke loose
from its tether and, charging down
on the infatuated aristocrat, hurled
him senseless against the Gothic iron
railings which had been imported
from Belgium at great expense.
BASTIA was torn in two between the
generous instincts of humanity and
devotion to the great cause. But in
this supreme moment her noble
nature triumphed, and, beating off
the infuriated zebra with a costly
dog-whip made in Bavaria, she
hastened to render first-aid to the
prostrate nobleman.
(To be continued-.)
The Western Mail, in eulogising
the furs at a certain Cardiff
emporium, says: "A really interest-
ing study in natural history is
afforded by the tigers, leopards,
zebra, and monkeys, not to mention
the smaller animals, such as the
minx." We put these words into
italics because they prove that there
is something, after all, in the well-
known advertisement of the fur
trade: "Ladies' own skins made

FOOTBALL, LIMITED.
THE recent decree of the Football
Association forbidding the London
Caledonians F.C. any longer to share
a ground with that outcast club, The
Casuals, has again roused interest in
the autocratic body which from its
palace at High Holborn plays so
important a part in European affairs.
Mr. Punch has lately managed to
penetrate the royal residence and
obtain an interview with Marquis
WALL, the Foreign Secretary; and
he has much pleasure in giving to

A MERRY CHRISTMAS.
the public some details of the palatial
building and the great personages
who rule there.
The chief power appears to rest
in the hands of four persons.
Emperor CLEGG is at the head of
affairs, with Marquis WALL as his
right-hand Inan. In addition to
them, Lord Chief Justice BENTLEY
and Archbishop PICKFORR are always
resident in the palace, and no im-
portant step is taken without their
advice and approbation. The genial
Marquis was good enough to give us
some notes upon the personalities of
his colleagues; and we have taken
the liberty of supplementing them
with a word of appreciation of the
Marquis himself, specially written
for us by the Archbishop.
CLEGG, EMPEROR: In his day one
of the best inside-rights in the
country. Though he has lost much of
his pace, is even now a deadly shot
and a consummate tactician. He
remains as modest as ever, in spite
of the exalted position to which he
has attained, and the members of
his Ministry are still allowed to refer
to him as Comrade CLEGG. The
royal prerogative of pardon rests in
him, and on more than one occasion
he has exercised his clemency.
Details of his famous plan for de-
feating the Russians by suspending
KUHOPATKIN can be found in the
archives of the royal palace at Tokio.
PICKFORD, ARCHBISHOP: Is con-
sidered by some to be even now tin-
best goal-keeper in the United
Kingdom. Affiliated clubs which
want to tour on the Continent, play
a match for a local chanty, or pre-
sent their secretary with a cigarette-
case have to get a special licein-f
from his Grace. Erring members
who had rashly joined the A.F.A.
are welcomed by the Archbishop on
their return to the fold, and spem/
ten minutes alone with him in tiic
Palace Library.
BENTLEY, LORD CHIEF JUSTICK:
Probably the finest centre-half who
has ever played for England. Being
now Lord Chief Justice, it is he who
grants to clubs the necessary affilia-
tion orders. Some of his lordship's
decisions are historic—notably that
in which ho decreed that a member
of the Football Association might
turn the ends of his trousers up with-
out permission, but must not share
a flat with a member of the Amateur
Football Association.
WALL, Marquis, SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: The
best all-round player the world has
ever seen. Equally good in any posi-
tion. Has been a great success as
Foreign Secretary. Individual mem-
bers of the F. A. who wish to spend the
summer in Switzerland can always
obtain a passport from his lordship.
So much for the men themselves.
Now a word as to the building from
which so many royal decrees and
proclamations have been issued.
104, High Holborn, regarded from
outside, seems an unpretentious
structure—the last place in the world
one would have imagined as a royal
residence. But, once inside, all
one's doubts vanish, as the famous
marble hall and picture gallery are
spread before one's gaze. This least
known yet most precious of art col-
lections has never been thrown open
to the public, and I need make no
apology, therefore, for noting a few
of the principal treasures. Directly

opposite us, as we come in, is
RODIN'S masterpiece — a life-size
statue of the Emperor in his youth-
ful and International days—Comrade
Clcgg appealing for a foul. It is
flunked on either side by two superb
paintings; the one by SIGISMUND
GOETZE, representing the historic
meeting between Marquis WALL and
Lord Chief Justice BENTLEY; the
other a portrait by SARGENT, entitled
Archbishop Pickford irith his
Favourite Shin-guard. Turning round
as we enter the building we see over
the door itself an immense and
realistic picture, whose existence (so
little suspected by the public) has for
some time past been no secret to
every connoisseur and art dealer in
Europe. This is The Pursuit: and
the running figure in the foreground,
with starting eyeballs and dripping
brow, is Lord Chief Justice BKXT-
LEY, who has just given a penalty
against the home team. . . .
It is time, however, that we
recorded what was, after all, the
chief object of our visit, our inter-
view with Marquis WALL. We found
the Foreign Secretary in his private
suite on the first floor, and to our
extreme gratification the Emperor
also was pleased to be present. After
a few words of greeting, his Majesty
graciously begged us to be seated
and commanded Marquis WALL to
give us such information as we
desired.
"I have come, your lordship,"
began Mr. Punch, "to hear from
your lips the latest details of the
Balkan Crisis."
"Well," said the Foreign Secre-
tary, " the situation is at present an
extremely delicate one. Austria,
Turkey, Servia and Bulgaria became
affiliated to us some years ago, of
course; and though we had to
suspend Austria once for six months
still none of these countries has
ever questioned our authority, and
they have always unhesitatingly
taken their orders from headquarters.
About two years back Bosnia ex-
pressed a wish to be affiliated, and
this was carried out by the Lord
Chief Justice. Six months ago we
discovered that Bosnia was actually
sharing a boundary line with Herze-
govina, whom we had had to suspend
indefinitely in 1905. I at once wrote
to point this out to them, and—
well, that is how matters stand at
present."
"We must have implicit obedi-
ence," added the Emperor in a cold
voice.
"Quite so, your Honour—I mear
your Majesty," said Mr. Punch
nervously.
"If Bosnia persists in its defianl
attitude, the consequences will be
very serious."
"W-what would your Cleggship—
that is to say, your Grace—I mean,
quite so, Emperor, your Majesty,
er—how did you find out so soor
that they shared a boundary line?'
"It was due to Archbishop PICK
FOKD'S genius," said the Marquis,
"As the result of tireless enquiries,
lasting over two years, the discovery
was made."
"You will kindly make public t<:
the nation the present state oi
affairs," commanded the Emperor,
And then abruptly he added, "The
audience is closed."
We immediately bowed and with-
drew backwards, and were then con-
ducted down again to the hall. In-
advertently raising our hat to the
wonderful RODIN statue, we left the
Palace, and found ourselves once
more among the common people.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
HAD I been Shuri, the gipsy heroine of Episodes in
the Lives of a Shropshire Lass and Lad (SMITH, ELDER)
I think I should scarcely have taken it so to heart when
the hero jilted me for town-bred Jocosa, because I should
have felt perfectly confident that so kindly and sympa-
thetic a writer as Lady CATHERINE MILNKS-GASKELL
would manage to bring everything out all right in
the end. As it happens, however, I should have been
wrong, for though there are wedding-bells on the last
page they are not those which the susceptible reader
has been led to expect. This small matter apart, how-
ever, I have nothing but gratitude for a book of singular
• charm, and in any case it is a romance in which the
actual tale is of less importance than the setting. It is not
the first time that the author has turned her knowledge
and love of bygone Shropshire to delightful account,
but she has done nothing better than this. It is
, instinct with the atmosphere of old-time country life;
full of that quality
of fat and comfort-
able beauty peculiar
to rural England for
which the Scotch
STEVEN SON has coined
the word " skeltery."
There is plenty of
skeltery in Lady
CATHERINE'S land-
scape—bosky glades,
lush meadows, and
sparkling brooks;
merry - makings, too,
with nut-brown ale,
and fiddling on the
green of summer
evenings. Her word-
pictures have the
colouring of a Mor-
land. For my own
part, indeed, the lure
of them was such that I turned straight from Lass
and Lad to Bradshaw, and there, on page 98, I have
found a train from which, one day next Spring, I shall
alight to explore for myself all the delectable places that
are here described. Much Wenlock, Longville, Rush-
bury—what a walk that should be! And if it rains, as
it probably will, some modern representative of Mistress
Trevor shall stay me against chills with a draught of
"peppermint and rosemary," which, whatever Lady
CATHERINE may say, is, I am sure, as delicious as its name.

of his attack on the then Radical stronghold of
Birmingham Mr. WRIGHT devotes exceptional space,
reproducing a number of banal illustrations from
a local newspaper. BUHNABY was his own biographer,
telling in familiar books the principal story of his life.
The two best chapters in the volume are, oddly enough,
contributed by outsiders. One by Sir FRANK BURNAND
vividly pictures BURNABY in his social aspect, at a dinner
given by him at the Junior Carlton Club. The other is
a simply-told, thrilling account- of his death at Abou
Klea, written by Lord BINNING, who fought by his side.
"My name is Rudolph Schnaubelt. I threw the
bomb which killed eight policemen and wounded sixty
in Chicago in 1886." That is how Mr. HARRIS begins
his vivid story The Bomb (LONG); and when I had
finished it I turned back to the first page in order to
make sure that the beginning was not "My name is
FRANK HARRIS. I threw," etc. Anyhow it might well
be that the "honest reporter and eye-witness" of tin-
closing scenes, quoted on page 299, was the present
Mr. HARRIS is a great advocate. Ho carries
you away in a rush of
words; and, assistrc
by the fact that the
scene is America,
convinces you (for a
time at any rate) that
Anarchy is right and
the Law wrong. In
dedicating the book
to a Serenity the au-
thor calls it a novel
of revolt and passion.
It is really a novel of
revolt with the pas-
sion dragged in; but
it is a fine and a
moving story, which
(I keep telling my-
self) is none the
worse for its dedica-
tion, and the persis-
tent advertisement of
author.
FRED BURNABY, with
gentle manner of a
woman, was rather the theme of a poet than of a prose
writer, more especially one whoso style is exceedingly
prosaic. A man of action, seeking adventure wherever,
and in whatever form, it presented itself, he does not
seem to have left behind him material for a bio-
graphy. Certainly Mr. WRIGHT has not discovered it.
Superb in battle, dauntless in travel by untrodden
ways, BURNABY was at his worst when he meddled
in politics, of which he knew nothing. To the episode
it in the body of Mr. HARRIS'S own paper.
We have no chance of being bored by The House of
Ardcn (FisiiER UN WIN), for its author, Mrs. NESBIT,
whisks us down the ages with the rapidity of a cine-
matograph. She is assisted in her flight by magic, a
witch and The Mouldiwarp; and I heartily recommend
the book to young children and old children, includ-
ing all grown-ups who remember what childhood was
like, or having forgotten want to be reminded. Attrac-
tive as the heroine and hero are, The Mouldiwarp is the
character for me, and I prophesy a very long life for
this delightful creature. Even when called " Mouldie"
by the hero, The Mouldiwarp retained its dignity. If
1 have a complaint to make it is that the chapters are
rather too long, for I cannot imagine the child who,
having begun one of them, will not want to finish it;
and, after all, there is such a thing as bedtime. Aud
when the chapter is finished there are Mr. MILLAR'S
illustrations to be looked at "just for a minute." I
cannot pay a higher tribute to the combined skill of
author and illustrator than by saying that parents
who do not wish their children to read in bed had
better sleep with The House of Arden under their own
pillows.

HEADLINES AND HISTOKY.
THE following monograph has been sent in by JONES
Minor of the Lower Kemove, in answer to a question
asked in his General Paper: " What do you know of the
Hastings Marathon?"
(JONES is a good boy, an ardent lover of Greek and
English history, and a constant reader of The Daily
Mail.)
"The Hastings Marathon (which must be distin-
guished from the Marathon Hastings) happened when
WILLIAM THE PERSIAN CONQUEROR wished to invade
England and claim the throne for himself. The King of
England at the time was HAROLD. He was a very brave
man. His other name was LONGBOAT. When HAROLD
heard that the Great Armada was coming he was not
afraid. He was playing bowls with MILTIADES, the Earl
of Northumbria, and he said, "Shall we finish the
rubber?" And MILTIADES, who was called the Last of
the Barons, said, "Certainly." After that they hung
a white shield on the walls of London, and called out the
hoplites and crossbowmen, and all ran as fast as they
could iu full armour to the sea. And they arrived in this
order—
1. PnEIDIl'PlDES.
2. DORANDO.
3. HEREWARD THE WAKE.
But when HEKKWARD saw that he was beaten he stood
up and cried aloud, "I have only done my duty, as
England expects every man to do," and then plunged
headlong in the. tide, and was washed up drowned at the
feet of Hero. But DORANDO protested that PiiEinippiDES
had been helped in the last lap by the god Pan, who
gave him a Ixnvl of Samian wine. So DORANDO got the
prize, which may be seen at Battle Ahbey to this day.
Then WILLIAM THE PERSIAN tried to sail round into the
Thames and take London by surprise. But when he
heard that Tlir Daily Mail had sent men to interview
him ho preferred to lose his ship in the Wash. So
HAROLD won ami England was saved."

"Do you see what you have done by this idiotic
tomfoolery, Sir? " said Uncle POLKINGHORN, addressing
me with a quite uncalled-for asperity. "There can no
longer be a doubt that several sitting round this table
have been tricked into swallowing one, if not more, o:
these infernal tin trinkets of yours!''
I was deeply hurt by this, for, as I assured him, everj
article, was not only solid silver, but actually hall
marked! But this did not mollify him in the least
He proceeded to enlarge on the consequences of a
symbol's finding its way into anyone's appendix with an
unreserve which I consider out of place at a dinner
table, while it was evidently making most of his hearers
extremely uncomfortable. I tried to divert the con
versation to some happier channel, but he would noi
accept my lead. He declared that he could feel the
dashed merrythought sticking in the back of his throal
at that very moment, and more than suspected that the
threepenny-piece had already reached an even less
accessible part of his interior. Others might please
themselves, but he'd be hanged if he, for one, was going
to sit there enduring tortures both of body and mind any
longer! And, rising from the table, he announced bis
intention of driving at once to the nearest hospital, and
having whatever metal objects he had within him located
by the X-rays.
Following him out into the hall, I endeavoured to
persuade him to wait at least till the end of the
evening rather than cast a gloom over the whole
party by so abrupt a departure. He might be mistaken
about his symptoms, I urged, and at the worst I had
every hope that if he would only permit SOWERBUTTS
and myself to hold him upside down for a minute- or HJ
we should succeed in shaking the merrythought, and
probably the threepenny-bit, out of him. I mentioned
instances within my personal knowledge of even half-
pennies having been recovered by this simple process.
But at this his fury became so ungovernable that he
bounced into the lift without noticing my proffered
hand, so I returned ,to .the dining-room, fully ex-
pecting that our other guests would have sufficient
good breeding to ignore what had passed. I was
disappointed to find them apparently indisposed for
conversation on general topics. Most of them, from
their expressions, seemed too absorbed in silent specula-
tions as to which of the company was now the uncon-
scious receptacle of the ring or the thimble, and what
not, to ho amused -by the antics of our little FREDA and
FRANKIE, who, being both convinced that they had
borne off the bell, were jumping delightedly about,
declaring, with a child's vivid powers of imagination,
that they could hear it tinkling inside them. Only old
ADDLESHAW (whose deafness had prevented any clear
comprehension of what he had been looking for in his
pudding), and Mamsell SCHLUMPFF (who, in her
unfamiliarity with our language and customs, was under
an impression that Uncle POLKINGHORN had gone out to
dress up as Santa Claus) remained unperturbed.
I could see from AGGIE'S face that, for once, even lier
social tact was unequal to the occasion, and that the
party could only be saved from utter failure by my
own savoir fairc. I did all I could. I said we must
not allow trifles of this sort to interfere with our enjoy-
ment; Christmas, after all, only came once a year, so
why not be as jolly as we could? And I invited Aunt
GRIZEL to pull the first cracker with me. To my amaze-

nent she burst into tears; and AGGIE, unable any longer
;o repress her anxiety about the twinnies, hurried them
:>ff to the nursery howling dismally, poor little chicks,
it the prospect of concluding their merry Christmas
with a dose of mustard and warm water!
I would rather not dwell on the scene that followed.
Aunt GKIZEL said that, though she had long been pre-
pared to obey the summons when it came, the last thing
she had expected was that it would be served in the.
pudding at her great-niece's husband's table! SHRIVEN-
FIAM PAPP bitterly regretted that, solely to avoid dis-
appointing me, he'had put off going in for his rest cure till
Boxing Day, and asked what sort of rest I supposed he
would enjoy wow, with a confounded silver button
pervading his system? Miss MOTE said that she would
have been grateful to me for relieving her of the burden
of living, if only I had selected some less invidious
means than a thimble of ending her existence. She did
think that a little hard! Miss AUSTEKBURY reminded
me that she was there that evening in a semi-profes-
sional capacity, my wife having asked her to come early
in order to give her opinion of the children's French
accent, and she warned me that, should she experience
any ill-effects from the ring, which she now distinctly
remembered noticing when too late, she should certainly
take advantage of the Workmen's Compensation Act.
She advised Mamsell, who had by this time gathered
that the pudding had been somehow rendered unfit for
human food, to follow her example.
I told them they were jumping too hastily at con-
clusions. It was not possible that they could each have
swallowed a souvenir, because there were not nearly
enough to go round. For all they knew and all / knew
I might contain the entire collection myself. On which
that brute BEASLEY SOWERBUTTS remarked that that
was highly improbable, especially as he had observed I
had been careful to eat as little of the pudding as
possible. Which was unworthy even of him, for I had
scarcely had a chance of getting a mouthful! However,
on this they all pitched into me together. Did I imagine
they came to me year after year for any pleasure it
gave them? They had come out of sheer kindness,
to avoid hurting our feelings by a refusal, and this was
how they were repaid for their self-sacrifice! After
dealing them what I must have known would be so
many death-warrants, I had tried to turn it off with
callous flippancy! And more to the same effect.
Well, I was so disgusted by their ingratitude that it
was as much as I could do to remember that I was their
host, and even as it wras I told them a few home-truths.
I might have said more, only, perhaps fortunately, I was
interrupted by the entrance of our parlour-maid LOUISA,
who brought in all the six symbols, carefully cleaned
and neatly set out on a silver salver, with a message from
Cook to the effect that her conscience had compelled her
to remove them before boiling the pudding. I learnl
afterwards that, on the evening I had stirred it, she had
sat up till quite late extracting them one by one with a
pair of pincers. But just then I was in no humour to
resent what I still consider a piece of officious inter-
ference on her part.
"Now," I said with dignified forbearance to my
guests, who were looking uncommonly foolish, "nou
perhaps you will see how unnecessarily you have al
been alarming yourselves!" And, as AGGIE joined us
just then with the kiddies, who were rejoicing a
having been let off their mustard and water after all, '.
roally thought we should settle down and enjoy ourselves
at last. But however it was—whether remarks ha(
>een exchanged which could not be forgotten in a
noment, or whether they suspected me of having played
in elaborate practical joke upon them—the fact remains
hat there was a sort of constraint. I tried to get up a
jamo of forfeits in the drawing-room, but it fell through
somehow. The party broke up at a comparatively early
lour, and AGGIE and I both felt it had gone off with
considerably less than the usual eclat.
Whether Uncle POLKINGHORN spent a pleasanter
hristmas evening under the X-rays I don't know. I
sent him the complete set of symbols next day, with
xplanations and our love, but he never returned the
slightest acknowledgment. And, as I began by inti-
Tiating, we are sending out no invitations this year.
We shall follow a practice now, I understand, prevalent
n smart Society, and dine quietly en famille at the
learest Italian restaurant. F. A.
THE OLD GREY MARE.
THERE 's a line of rails on an upland green
With a good take-off and a landing sound,
Six fences grim as were ever seen,
And it 's there I would be with fox and hound.
Oh, that was a country free and fair
For the raking stride of my old grey mare!
With her raking stride, and her head borne high,
And her ears a-prick, and her heart a-flame,
And the steady look of her deep blue eye,
I warrant the grey mare knew the game:
It was " Up to it, lass," and before I knew
We were up and over, and on we flew.
The rooks from the grass got up, and so,
With a caw and flap, away they went;
When the grey mare made up her mind to go
At the tail of the hounds on a breast-high scent,
The best of the startled rooks might fail
To match her flight over post and rail.
While some of the thrusters grew unnerved,
And looked and longed for an open gate,
And one crashed down and another swerved,
She went for it always true and straight:
She pounded the lot, for she made it good
With never a touch of splintered wood.
Full many a year has come and gone
Since last she gathered her spring for me,
And lifted me up, and so flew on
Unchecked in a country fair and free.
I 've ridden a score since then, but ne'er
Crossed one that could live with the old grey mare.
HOME HINTS.
BY " ERMYNTHUDE."
To bleach linen thoroughly (in reply to "House-
wife "), take half a pint of strong sulphuric acid
(H2SO4), add a bucketful of cold water and boil gently
for fifteen minutes over a slow fire—about four miles an
hour will do—stirring in six ounces of pure lampblack
till no lumps are visible. Soak the linen in this as
desired. Any material bleached by this process can be
regarded as of good quality. Do not let the hands
remain in the solution too long or a slight discoloration of
the finger-nails may result; also, in dealing with sul-
phuric acid remember the rhyme of our schooldays :—
"Little Johnnie's dead and gone,
We '11 never see him more,
For what he took for H,O

In answer to "Gussie," who queries the correctness

caution we have not found it a great success as an
illuminant.
To preserve plums whole, "Angus," kill as many as
you require—the most merciful way is to stand them on
their heads until they get congestion—then bake each
plum separately for thirty minutes. When done they
turn bright pink with green spots. Bottle, cork, and
eat. The syrup may be strained into a pan and placed
on the fire; this is much the best way of putting it out.
"Jack" and "Jill" write to know if ERMYNTRUDE
can recommend a good lively parlour game for the
Christmas holidays. She can, dear J. and J. Ask the
company if they have ever heard of the amusement called
the Laundry Game; it will probably be new to them.
Blindfold all, except yourself; seat them round the fire;
enjoin silence; then take a big jug of water and walk
rapidly round, pouring a pint or so down everybody's
neck. On no account must the bandages be removed
from the eyes of those participating. I hope you will
find this quite a success. ERMYNTKUDE.

Is merely throaty, and completely lacking
The proper ring.
While mine, to their perceptible disgust, is
A hollow bark that tears me with a clank,
And, though I say it, should in common justice
Take highest rank.
But no, they seem to find my efforts wearing;
A sort of bluff to show what I can do;
But never mind: I 'm rapidly preparing
A final coup.
And, when they follow me in sad procession,
While into self-reproachful tears they burst,
My obsequies shall win me this confession—
Mine was the worst.

SYNOPSIS OF PRKVIOUS CHAPTERS.
IBRAIIMI SLIVINSKI, tho sou of a
Polish Jew and a Turkish mother,
has been deputed by the Egyptian
Nationalists to study the Woman
Suffrage question in England, and
on his arrival in that country takes a
prominent part in the campaign
against the House of Lords, and be-
comes engaged to PORTIA HAMPDEN,
the leader of the militant Suffragists.
While on his way to a great meeting
at tho Caxton Hall, he is assaulted
by Lord BOODLE, a profligate noble-
man, and challenges the aggressor to
a duel in Finsbury Park. Just as the
combatants are about to engage,
PORTIA rushes on to the scene and
shoots Lord BOODLE dead with a
dynamite pistol. PORTIA is arrested,
and while she is awaiting her trial in
Holloway the prison is " rushed " by
ten thousand members of the
Humanitarian Legion, mounted on
cream-coloured thoroughbreds. After
rescuing PORTIA, they proceed to West-
minster to exterminate the Peers.
CHAPTER IX.
Lady YORICK, closely followed by
SLIVINSKI and ASSID, was tho first to
burst into the Gilded Chamber. The
LORD CHANCELLOR was on his feet,
and the intrepid Countess was in the
act of hurling a bomb at him, when
BASHINGHAM, in anguished accents,
screamed out, "Spare him. It 's
LORKBURN, not HALSBURY."
The Ministerialists, warned of their
danger, fled to the lobbies, and then
tho grim work of slaughter began in
earnest. SLIVINSKI, armed with an
Abyssinian scimitar, decapitated
three viscounts with one blow. The
Duke of NORTHUMBERLAND was trans-
fixed by a poisoned boomerang,
hurled with unerring aim by BORIS
POLDOWSKI, the patriotic Member for
Houndsditch.
Round the Woolsack belted earls
fell in heaps before the onset of JOAN
IRONSIDE and her Amazons.
It was, indeed, a luscious spec-
tacle, and yet JOHN WORMWOODS-
WORTH, the tender-hearted pessimist,
could not restrain his tears as he
witnessed the extirpation of the
feudal magnates who had so often
served to-decorate his sombre chroni-
cles 6t the" countryside.
At last he could restrain himself
no longer. "Stop," he cried in a
voice of well-modulated but poignant
anguish. "They are oppressors and
reactionaries. But they are pic-
turesque and well-groomed types."
At that moment a blow from an eel-
skin stuffed with sand, wielded by au
infuriated Humanitarian, caught him
across his well-chiselled features,
and, with faultless deportment, he
sank heavily to the floor.

SYNOPSIS.
Lady MAUD CHAFFERS, a beautiful
girl of noble lineage, whose father,
tho Marquis of BOOLE, lost every-
thing in the great fire of 1903, deter-
mines bravely to turn to account her
knowledge of dogs as a means of
livelihood. She {therefore establishes
a, kennel in the back-garden of her
house at Netting Hill and breeds toy
poms. These she advertises in The
Exchange and Mart. It happens
that MORDAUNT VALDEMAR, wishing
to give a toy pom to MARY MEE,
the daughter of a rural dean, to
whom as a youth ho became engaged
and who will not release him,
answers one of Lady MAUD'S adver-
tisements, and correspondence fol-
lows, leading to a visit to Netting
Hill to choose a pup. MOUDAUNT at
ouco falls in love with Lady MAUD—
real love—and Lady MAUD with him.
Ho does not, however, say so, merely
contenting himself with a few burn-
ing glances and paying more than
was asked for the pom. In parting
with it Lady MAUD sheds such tears
that he resolves to give it back to her
by hook or by crook. She is, how-
ever, bound to sell it as the brokers
are in at Boole Hall, and the Marquis
threatens suicide unless he can raise
E12, the price of the pom.
MORDAUNT, whose sense of honour
compels him to give the pom to
MARY MEE, since he had promised it
to her, arranges with WIGGY BOAKF.S,
a son of one of his old butlers, to get
it back again, and this WIGGY has
just done.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
MARY MEE woke up with a start.
Something was wrong, she felt sure,
but what was it? She listened.
There was no sound! Ah, that -was
it. No sound. For no sound meant
that Darlikins, the toy pom which
MORDAUNT VALDEMAR had given her,
either was not there or was—dead!
His breathing was naturally so loud
—almost a snore, in fact. To hear
nothing was terrible.
MARY MEE'S heart stood stilJ.
Then she leapt from the b?d and
rushed into the next room, where
Darlikius' little wicker kennel, made
in the shape of St. Paul's Cathedral,
stood. It was empty! With a
shriek of dismay MARY MEE swooned.
A man passing by heard the shriek
and stopped. Wrhat was it? The
man was Baron POCUK, a tall, hand-
some, military type whose baroness
any woman might be proud to be.
He was on his way home after a
late night at his club. Ho had lost
all—as usual. He was always losing
all. What should he do? " Should
he break into the house whence, the
scream proceeded. It would be an
adventure, anyway.
As he pondered MARY MEE came
to the window and screamed
"Thieves!"
The Baron replied, "What have
you lost?"
"A pom/' she said. "I would
give ten thousand pounds rather than
lose it!"
Ah, thought the Baron, she is rich.
Perhaps it is what I have been look-
ing for?
"Madam," he said, "for a tenth
of that sum I will find it!"
"A bargain I " cried MARY MEE.
(To be continued.)
A Note on Eggs.
"Then Spain threw off the yolk of the Moors,
and once again relapsed." —Xunealon Obscrrer.
Spain should have pocketed the
white instead.

To Miss Pinkie,
o/o H. Beerlohm Tree, Esq.,

DEAREST PINKIE,—Have you read
my book, Peter Pan's Post Bag 1 My
friend, Miss PAULINE CHASE, wrote
the preface all in italics, and Mr.
HEINEMANN very kindly published it
for me. I expect you will soon be
having a Post Bag of your own, so I
send you this letter to make a
start with. I want to say
that I think you are simply
wonderful, and that if there
was any chance of my ever
growing up you would be the
woman for me. But Wendy
is looking over my shoulder as
I write, so I dare not say this.
I should also like to send you
several "thimbles," but am
prevented for the reason given
above.
'Your loving and devoted
PETER PAN.
DEAR MADAM,—I hear that
Peter has been writing to you;
so there is no need for me to
add anything, except that I
should be obliged rf you would
give my best love to Tommy
and say that I think him most
frightfully fascinating.
Yours faithfully,
WENDY DAKLING.
DEAR Miss PINKIE, — Not
bad. I sec that the people
who made your fairy-tale have
picked up several notions from
the Lane. But I still think
we manage these things on
more legitimate lines. You
didn't hustle enough; and the
scenery kept much too still.
And then the idea of having
an actual boy for the Prin-
cipal Boy! Yours kindly,
ARTHUR COLLINS.
MY DEAR PINKIE,—Do you
think you could get Mr. TREE to let me
understudy his Queen of the Fairies?
I know I have not got her self-assur-
ance and air of experience, but I
would do my best to acquire these
qualities. Yours hopefully,
ADELINE GENEE.
MY DARLING PINKIE,—I do wish I
could find some real children like you
and Tommy for my Peter Pan annual;
because poor Michael feels a little
lonely amongst all those grown-ups.
Are you doing anything in 1914? Be-
cause if net I should like you to play
Wendy. Of course you are just a
child of nature, so far; and you
would have to be taught some senti-
ment about mothers (1 notice that
you haven't got a mother—a grave
omission); but you would soon pick
'that up. Of course if Miss ELLEN
TERRY goes on getting younger /and
younger and younger every year, I
might want her for Wendy; and any-
how I shall try and get your Queen
of the Fairies to do my pillow dance.
I have a contract with my present

MB. THEE PRESENTS THE QCEEN OF THE FAIRIES.
Starkcy up till 1931; otherwise your
gardener should have the part; and I
am always Your best friend,
J. M. BARRIE.
MY DEAR Miss PINKIE,—This is
what is called an open letter, mean-
ing that you can show it to anybody
you like, except the part where I say
that I 'm older than Molly. You
may even show it to your old
gardener, though 1 think his fun
was a little out of the picture, as
they say. You see, one of the most
delightful things in your play was
the quiet way in which it parodied
the usual pantomime; and here was
a figure straight out of Drury Lane
Nearly all the rest was in such gentle
undertones of humour. (I am talk
ing as if you were grown-up, because
you seem to understand things.)
I thought you were splendid, ant
the only thing about you I didn't like
(and that wasn't your fault) was
when you had to say all those cleve
things about the donkey's long ears
just after you had got into the dark
wood. You would really have
been much too excited to
anything of the kind.
You were very fortunate in
having such charming friends
to play with—the elves especi
ally; and your Aunts an
Uncle were much more attrac
tive than you supposed. How
they managed not to see the
fairies I can't make out. /
saw them quite plainly, and I
am much older than Molly.
1 think your play was
almost as delightful for whsf
it left out as for what it had
in. -• I am very glad, lot
instance, that Cinderella's
Prince and Molly's young man
didn't put in an appearance.
I can just imagine how stuffy
they 'd have been. Anyhow,
they couldn't possibly have
been good enough for such
very attractive ladies. I am not
quite sure, by the way, that
Cinderella and The Sleeping
Beauty ought to have stepped
into real life in the Third Act.
People in Fairyland don't
quite do that, do they? Still,
• it was good to see them again,
and I wouldn't have missed a
moment of The Sleeping
Beauty, who was simply su
perb. And she could sing too;
,* her song in the wood was the
most yawny thing I have ever
heard outside the Laud of Nod.
Some people think that your
play was rather thin and slow
in parts. Well, I hope it won't get
any quicker or thicker. As it was
there were far more good things in ii
than the audience could take in on
the night I saw it. But then no
everybody has a voice as clear as
yours, my dear. And your theatre
is so dreadfully big for small voices.
My compliments to everybody
not forgetting Mr. TREE. I hope thi
Queen of the Fairies will bring him
on before the curtain every night.
Good-bye, and don't ever grow up
And please let me be, now an
always, Your adopted Uncle,
O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MUSICAL NOTES.
THOUGH no official announcement
has been made as to RICHARD
STRAUSS'S new opera, some inter-
esting details, communicated by the
composer's friend. Professor WANA-
MAKER, to the Journal of Neurology,
seem to make it clear that the sub-
ject is Medea, and that it will be
handled with all the restraint, deli-
cacy and geniality which have
marked his earlier contributions to
the lyric drama.
According to Professor WANA.MAKER
the libretto, for which STRAUSS him-
self is responsible, follows closely the
lines of the story as narrated by
the great LKMPRIKUK, and includes, as
outstanding features of the. drairwi,
the murder by dilaniation "of
Absijrtus; the hypodermic injection
of magical juices into the veins of
SEsan; the boiling alive of Pelias;
the destruction of Glauee and the
massacre of Ula ucc 'x family; and the
final slaughter of Medea'H own chil-
dren, after which Medea trium-
phantly escapes from the vengeance
of her infuriated consort in a chariot
drawn by winged dragons.
During the greater part of the
opera STRAUSS contents himself with
a small orchestra of four hundred
performers. But in certain scenes
the executive personnel is largely
augmented. Thus the orgies in the
Temple of Hecate will be accom-
panied by a group of twelve soprano
Schreckhorns, fourteen octoroons, and
a QoHardophone, a gigantic quadruple
bass tuba, which, fitted with a Par-
sons (uixetophone, will emit sten-
torian snorts every ten seconds. A
special feature in the third Act is the
employment of a superb steam siren
to simulate the hissing of the caul-
dron in which Pelius is boiled to
death, the shrieks of the victim being
represented \ty a group of twenty
piccolos reinforced by ten peacocks
and a live pig, who, according to
Professor WANAMAKER, will be killed
on the stage.
A charming effect occurs in the,
first Act, where Medea tears her
brother Absijrins limb from limb, the
rending asunder of the unfortunate
Colcluan nobleman — realistically
represented by a life-sized dummy
stuffed with sausage - meat — syn-
chronising with a terrific fanfare on
forty - eight long Bach trumpets,
while his death-rattle, is gracefully
suggested by a cadenza on the
xylophone.

Plumber (irlio, liaring Itad to cliast'ise lii» loij,lias used a half-inch iron rod). "Aso MAIIK
'KF., LAIHUK! IT'LL BE A 'THREE-QC.MITER-INCH ROD NEXT TIME!" ^__
Even more charming is the scene
in which Medea slays her children in
the presence of -Jason. Here the
psycho-pathological synthesis of the
orchestra reaches an altogether un-
precedented pitch. Each of the

The scene of the last Act is laid in
the Elysian Fields, where, according
to the traditions mentioned by
SIMONIDF.S. Mcdca was married to
Achilles and made him a model wife.
STRAUSS, however, witli hi.s usual
refreshing originality, represents the
illustrious pair as lending a life of
inordinate and stivpttant misery,
culminating in a diabolical Apache
dnnee in which each tears the other's
head off and puts it on to the wrong
body. This finale, according to Pro-
fessor WANAMAKKR, is not only the
most sublime but the most soul-
staggering achievement in the entire
history of the solar or any other
system.

DEAREST DAPHNE,—We all vote
Christinas a bore and a back-number,
and yet we 've given in to it once
more, sending presents and cards ad
nauseam, because none of us has the
courage to stop the absurd habit. I
do think that the person who could
c.t once and for ever abolish Christ-
mas cards and presents (I refer, of
course, to those one has to give!)
would deserve a front seat among the
very greatest benefactors of our
species; ho 'd be even greater than
that extraordinary creature, HARVEY,
who was the first person to have his
blood circulate.
People are simply most immensely
mean about Christmas cards. A
year ago Aunt GOLDIE sent me the
card / 'd sent her the Christmas be-
fore. C'est bicn ellc! I sent it to
her again this Christmas. This sort
of thing is imposs. if you get your
Christmas cards specially printed for
you; but I consider that to be encour-
aging Christmas, and so don't do it.
BADS always does; and has a little
verse of high-flown, home-made
"poetry " printed on them. I never
know what she means. This year's
is:—
"Glows the glowing yule-log bright,
Flings its glowing yule-tide light
On Friends afar and Friends nnear;
May its radiance shine on you,
May its radiance shine athrough
Th' abysmal depths o1 th' yet uutrod New
Year!"
Do you think it good? I don't.
And RAY HIMINGTON says it won't
scan, and that there 's no such word
as " athrough."
JOSIAH 's given me a most dilly
Christmas present. One of the
new motor-houses! You 've heard
of them, of course? Houses, you
know, with a motor foundation, so
that you can go where you like in
them. Mine 's one of the very first
to be built, and is a little darling
duck of a maisonette, furnished re-
gardless. Fancy being able to go
bye-bye at night among all your own
pretty-pretties, and to wake up in
the morning a couple of hundred
miles off! (BABS and BERYL and
WEE-WEE arc devoured with envy.
Their husbands couldn't spend
£30,000 on Christmas presents for
them, and wouldn't if they could.]
JOSIAII certainly has his merits, and,
as I 'm very far from being a con
scicncelcss woman, I consider thai
when your husband gives you sucli
really nice presents you ought occa-
sionally to do as he wishes. So ]

Altogether they had a much gaudier

people who were keeping it.
A little Christmas storiette about
the OLDPARKS is going round. He
was out in Texas, you know, as a
younger son, ranching and cowboy-
ing and all that
sort of thing, and
he married the
daughter of his
"boss." She was
pretty and dol-
larous, knew all
about "round-
ing up" cattle,
and rode about
wearing a lasso
and a rifle and
all the other
little et-ceteras
of a Texan toil-
ette. Since he
succeeded to the
title and brought
her home, how-
ever, she 's com-
pletely put away
Texan things,
goes in furiously
for pomp and cir-
cumstance, and,
in the language
of her former
state, never
comes off the
roof. (It 's said
that she 's been
heard to speak
of herself as
"my ladyship"
— isn't that
lovely?) Well,
and so the Texan
countess meant
to have a regular
pompous, patri-
archal Christmas
at Oldpark. There
was to be a kick-

ceited! They think they can give us
a stone and a beating over any dis-
tance, from the T.Y.C. to the Gold
Cup Course. Love has been quite
the topic among us who 've been to
the lectures. Discussion has simply
raged. BOSH and WEE-WEE gave a
Love Dinner; and I had a big Love
Tea. But a tete-a-tete love-argu-
ment is the best fun. NORTY and I
had a furious one when he called in
Park Lane the other day. In the
course of it I said the woman who
loved in vain was completely out,
and we 'd no use for her to-day; and
that, if I could come across a speci-
men of her, I 'd give it a good shak-
ing and say: "You donkey! What
d'you mean by loving in vain? Don't
you think the men are conceited
enough without that?" And NORTY
said, " Well, anyhow the woman who
loved in vain was better than the
woman who
couldn't love at
all!" And I
said, "Where
was the woman
who couldn't
love at all?"
And he said,
"Oh, in lots of
places." And I
said I 'd never
met the woman
who couldn't
love—and just as
the discussion
was getting enor-
mously amusing
JOSIAH came in
and began to
look for some-

so frightfully

MR. WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM must really take
care or he will out-William the greatest of all the Wil-
liams, with his versatile industry. Only the other day
his plays were performing a pan tie qiuitre, and now,
while I forget how many of them HIV still on the track,
comes The Magician (HEINEMANN), displaying Mr.
MAUOHAM'S talent in a novel and extremely lurid light.
"None of your society rib-ticklers this time," says
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. "I wants to make your
flesh creep. I will a tale unfold whose lightest word
will harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, make
each particular hair to staiid erect like quills upon the
fretful porcupine. Murder most foul, strange and un-
natural." Or, iu the language of the halfpenny news-
vendor—" Shockin' revelations! An Old Etonian
practises black magic. Creates homunculi with his
wife's life - blood. ^
Mysterious death of
the Murderer!" That
gives -you the skele-
ton, so to speak, of
Mr. MAUGHAM'sstory.
There is a human
interest in it as well
—the grizzly fascina-
tion by which this
monster - creating
monster attracts the
young girl, who,
loathing him like a
poisonous toad,
l>ody, soul, and spirit,
yet becomes his wife.
In its natural as well
as supernatural fea-
tures the story is
gruesomely clever.
But for my part I
don't care to sup my fill with such horrors,
me indigestion.

EXPLODED REPUTATIONS. VI.
THE RIRRHS.
In A Happy Half Century (GAY AND HANCOCK), which
gives the title to a little volume of essays, Miss
REPPLIER reviews the literary products of the last
twenty-five years of the eighteenth century and the first
quarter of the nineteenth. The period begins with MJ'KB
BURNEY and closes with Miss FKKRIER and Miss JANE
PORTER. Prominent among its stars are Mrs. BAR-
BAULD, HANNAH MORE, Mrs. CHAPONK, Mrs. MONTAGUE,
Mrs. Oi'iE, Mrs. HKMANS, and the authoress of The
Mysteries of Vdolpho. Miss HKPI-LIEU'S lament is that
she, and others among UK were l>orn a hundred years too
late. What a splash we might have made with these
amiable, persons as competitors! In succeeding chapters
the masterpieces of these and sister-writers arc dealt
with in detail, leaving on the mind of the reader n
feeling of surprise that one who has read them al"
through is still alive, and, as the book testifies, in liigl
spirits. When we come to think of it, it is amazing
that such dull commonplace should for half a centurj
have held the reading world in thrall. One who in a
morning newspaper is
occasionally alluded
to as "this present
writer" heard Mr.
GLADSTONE relate how
he had once been in
the sainted presence
of HANNAii'MoRE.and
how she gave him a
book —- probably one
of her own. He
spoke of the event as
if it filled one of the
proudest moments of
a not uneventful life.
Whilst Miss RF.PPLIER
laments her own
birth out of due sea-
son, she will recog-
nise what splendid
opportunity DICKENS
They give.
I do wish that authoresses would he more liumane.
In the House of the, Vrickels (.SMITH, ELDER), KATHARINE
TYNAN has completely wrecked a boat-train from Paris
in order to destroy an unfortunate young man who had
to be got out of the way, and incidentally, of course,
has brought suffering and distress into the homes of
hundreds of people who had nothing to do with the plot
at all. There were reasons why the heroine considered it
desirable that her first lover (whom she imagined to be
the betrayer of her sister) should he got out of the way;
still, I think that his elimination might have been
effected with less of general discomfort. For the rest,
the House of the Crick ft n (there were, none on the
hearth, I fancy) gives a well-drawn, pathetic picture of
life on an extremely distressful Irish farm, and whereas
I always believed before that the grig was a merry kind
of beast I shall never do so again. There is one
other point besides the railway smash that I feel
obliged to cavil at. On page '25*2 KATHERINE TYNAN says
of her heroine that " she had often thought how foolish
were the misunderstandings of the novelists, devised
just to keep the ball rolling." Of course, as a matter
of fact (if she had only known it), Huiittnli was in a
novel herself all the time.

A DIUECTOIRE FROCK.
LONG languid lines unbroken by a frill,
Superfluous festoons reduced to nil,
A figure like a seal reared up on end
And poking forward with a studied bend;

Skin-fitting sleeves that show a stint of stuff,
A waist promoted halfway up the back.
And not a shred that 's comfortably slock;
A multitude of buttons, row,on row,
Not there for business—merely made for show,
A skirt whose meagre gores necessitate
The waddle of a Chinese lady's gait;
A "busby" toque extinguishing the hair

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

.... As MR. PUNCH drew nearer he saw that a Christmas Dinner Party was in progress. It was the most
extraordinary Christmas Party he had ever seen, for everybody seemed to be quarrelling with everybody else.
When they observed him, which they did quite suddenly, they stopped arguing with each other, and all shouted
together:
"No room! No room!"
"There is always room for me," said MB. PUNCH modestly; and he sat down in a vacant chair. On his left side
was a Jarge bird which he recognised at once as the famous Doiible Eagle, but the chair on his right seemed at first sight
,o be unoccupied.
The Double Eagle looked doubtfully at him.
"Oh, it's you, is it?" he said at last. "Then consider yourself censored, boycotted and blackballed." Where-
upon he resumed his occupation of pushing a small furry animal into his pocket—only pausing occasionally to scowl
it his left-hand neighbour.
"Have some Turkey?" cried somebody to MR. PUNCH.
The Sage looked round the bible. "I don't see any," he said.
"There isn't any," laughed another of the company. "We 've taken it all."
"No, they haven't," whispered a very small voice on MR. PUNCH'S right. "There 's still a little of me left. But
'in not the bird I was. Not at all the bird I was," he repeated in a doleful voice.
Mu. PUNCH turned round hastily, and found that there was indeed a small bird on the apparently unoccupied chair.
"Dear me," he said, "I never noticed you. Now perhaps you can tell me who all these people are?"
"With pleasure," said the Turkey. "Of course you recognise the person on your left—the Double Eagle?"
"Yes," said MR. PUNCH; "but I don't quite^understand what he's doing. Who is that little animal he is pushing
into liis pocket?"
"That," said his neighbour in a melancholy voice, " is the Bosnigove. It used to be mine really, but that Double
Eagle took it away; and all I 'm going to get instead is one of those little woolly things called Sandjaks. Well, then,
further on you see the Serb. He's very angry with the Double Eagle about it all, being a great friend of the Bosnigove'a,
and .... I don't know, but there may be a fight one day."
"I see," said MR. PUNCH. "And who is the person beyond you with the paper cap on?"
"It isn't a cap, it's a crown—at least he thinks it is. That is the Bulgar Man. A very Bulgar Man," added the
Turkey with a sigh.
At this moment the Double Eagle turned round suddenly and gazed at MR. PUNCH.

- PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Are you fond of riddles?” he asked abruptly.
“Very,” said the Sage genially. “I always think that no Christmas dinner is complete without a few riddles
And I may say that I am considered rather good at them.”
“Then try this one. When is a Treaty not a Treaty 2 °
“When is a Treaty not a Treaty? I’m sure I shall guess that. When it's a —— When it's a ” he began
to murmur to himself; but the Double Eagle had already turned away, and was now flapping his wings violently under
the nose of the Serb. Mr. PUNCH was sure that there would really be a fight this time, and was about to jump up and
intervene, when the Bulgar Man leant over towards him.
“Will you,” he said, holding out a cracker, “pull this with me?”
“Certainly,” said MR. PUNcil. “Crackers—how delightful' "
“I do hope,” said the Bulgar Man, “I d) hope there's a real crown in this one. Would you,” he went on anxiously,
“would you call this one I've got on a cap or a crown 2. It's just like a crown, isn't it?”
º should call it a crap—I mean a cown -- that is to say, decidedly a-—”

“Bother ' " said the Bulgar Man. “A tin trumpet ! And I did want a real crown so | Here, you, catch,” and
he threw it at the Serb. . . . - - -
“I can tell you the answer to that riddle,” said a mild voice at MR. Pusch's elbow. “It’s “When it's broken.”
“Of course!” cried MR. PUNCH. “So it is. It wouldn't be a Treaty any longer when it was broken, and so—
"Heavens, what's that?” • . . . -
“It's only me,” said the Serb, as he took the trumpet from his mouth. He had left his chair and was now standing
just behind MR. PUNCII. “I’m a very warlike person, I am,” he went on. “Did you see what that Double Eagle did to
me? He flapped his wings in my face. I shall resent it—I shall certainly resent it most strongly. And I shan’t be
afraid to tell him so. I'm a Serb.” * - -
“They also Serb who only stand and wait,” murmured the Turkey. .
“You don't think I'm afraid, do you?” cried the Serb, turning to him indignantly. “Why, I’ve a good mind,
a very good mind, to blow this in his ear, just to show you.” º,
“Look here,” began the Double Eagle, turning round––
“Bang!” cried the Bulgar Man, as he pulled a cracker with himſelf. “This is a crown this time, I bet you
anything.” r" -. -
“Peace, peace,” said Mr. PUNCH, spreading out his lands, -
They quieted down, and waited for him to speak. - -
“Gentlemen,” he said cheerily, “this is the maddest dinner-party I have ever been at. (Applause.) Now one of
you asked me a riddle just now, which I have succeeded in guessing vicariously. (Ha! haſ) . In the ordinary way I should
expect to receive a prize for this; but in these special circumstances I can see that it is all of you who will expect to
receive a prize from me. (Muffled “Hear, hears' from the Bosnigore.) I have, therefore, much pleasure in presenting you
all with the first prize” (and here he placed a book upon the table), “in the hope that, whatever your differences
may be, you will at least have this in common—an appreciation of my

SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
Boy (at eound of horn). ""ERE BE THE 'UNTERS A-COOMIN'! 'ARK TO THE 'OOTER!"
A WEIGHT-FOR-YOUTH HANDICAP.
[Dedicated to a young lady with a sensitive nose who complains bitterly that the long-haired youth of to-day make the atmosphere of i
ball-room intolerable with the reek of their cosmetics.]
I STOOD and watched her as 8he stepped
In at the dance-room door;
The gaze of all the well-groomed "bloods,"
Conscious of perfect ties and studs,
Followed her where she bravely swept
Over the shining floor.
From brows on which no sign of toil
Had come from thinking hard
Their locks were trained in lengthy streaks
(It must have taken weeks and weeks)
And plastered down with care and oil
And slabs of potted lard.
But when, as those who bring a gift
No woman yet refused,
They kindly offered her a dance
She gave their heads a searching glance,
Threw up her pretty nose and sniffed,
And begged to be excused.
They bore their underrated charms
Into the buffet-room,
While she, who showed such want of taste,
Allowed her admirable waist
To be disposed within the arms
Of men of riper bloom.
Greatly intrigued that Age should snatch
A boon to boys denied,
I asked her: "Can you tell me why
'You cast a preferential eye
On older heads with thinner thatch?
Is it the brains inside?"
"I hardly care for brains a bit,
Not at a ball," said she;
"Give me a man with whom I seem
To float like seraphs in a dream,
And I Ml not ask for pearls of wit
Or plums of repartee.
"These boys may have the brains of mice;
/ look outside the head;
The thing that puts me ofi is just
Their greasy polls that catch the dust;.
Besides, my nose is rather nice—"
(" I see it is," I said).
******
There are who simply loathe to wear
A cranium smooth and blank;
But, as I joined the m&zy whirl
With that extremely pleasant girl,
To Fate that pinched my wealth of hair
I heaved a pious thank. 0. S.

MINCE-MEAT.
By Our Charivariety Artiste,
REALISING the fact that the cult of
the Christmas Card is on the wane,
an enterprising firm is advertising
pianolas as an admirable substitute.
* *
We wonder whether it is generally
known that, if the
plan of a famous
German strate-
gist be carried
out, the invasion
of this country,
when it takes
place, will happen
on the afternoon
of Christmas
Day, at an hour
when the entire
British nation is
rendered helpless
by a surfeit of
plum-pudding.
By the by, a
little boy writes
to ask whether it
is a fact, as his
mother tells him,
that, if he eats
too much plum-
pudding and too
many mince-pies,
the currants will
all come out on
his face as spots.
We are sorry,
but we must
really refuse to
make trouble be-
tween mother
and son.
* *
The experiment
tried in Panto-
mime last year of
having "principal
boys" of the
male sex is to
be abandoned.
"Girls will be
boys," as the
saying hasn't it.
* *
*
One of the fea-
tures of the
coming Panto-
mime Season, we are told, will be a
coon song of which the refrain is Sue,
Sue, Sue. This incitement to litiga-
tion will be welcomed by the entire
legal profession, which, through no
fault of its own, has for some time
past been suffering from lack of
employment.
* *
*
The Trustees of the Carnegie Hero
Fund have, we hear, decided that
their resources are not sufficiently
large to enable them to make grants
to policemen who have distinguished
themselves by gallantry to cooks.
Some recently-published statistics
show that old age, as a cause of
death, is more frequent among cen-
tenarians than any other class.

reported. A Mr. Jones of Upper
Tooting, who had never had a gun in
his hand before, shot a rabbit last
week.
* *
We would caution our readers
against a gentleman of philanthropic
appearance who goes about asserting
that he recently sent a cheque for
£1,000 to a certain
charitable insti-
tution. It seems
that, being of a
retiring disposi-
tion, he preferred
his gift to be
anonymous and
so didn't sign the
cheque.

The danger of
relying on trade
terms! A lady
writes to com-
plain that an in-
strument which
she bought at a
recent sale was
described as ao
upright piano,
but is now 1/e-
having most de-
ceptively.

'This is cut-
ting it rather
fine, isn't it,
guv'nor?" said
a cabby on re-
ceiving a shilling.
The fare looked
angry for a mo-
ment, then a
wave of generos-
ity passed over
him. "Very well,
I '11 make it
guineas," he said
as he handed
cabby a further
penny.
He was a
simple - looking
youth, and, as he
entered the con-
sulting-room, h'e
said, "Doctor,
my head always feels muzzy. What
do you recommend?" "Have you
tried a vacuum cleaner? " asked the
doctor.

We ought not to say it, for it
all go to church together in "it on' s]ound8 boastful, but we cannot resist
Sundays drawing attention to the fact that in
the foregoing paragraphs we have not

ACHES AND IVORIES.
MINE is a flat on the uppermost floor oi the mansion,
Far from the motor-bus, high above whistle and shout,
Here I could give my afflatus its needful expansion,
Ponder my numbers and patiently worry them out.
Calmly remote I pursued my professional labours,
Lived as a type of the homely industrious poor,
Sat in content with myself and at peace with my neigh-
bours,
Till they imported a beast of an infant next door.
Bagpipes and bo'suns, a bushel of average babbies,
Screams of despair from a steamer that "s run on a
shoal,
Pulleys and brakes that want greasing, noctambulate
tabbies,
Cries of the errant purveyor of cabbage or coal—
Start them together from all the four points of the compass;
Throw in a gramophone able to penetrate walls;—
Then you 've a dream of the pandemoniacal rumpus
.Wafted abroad when that blessed homunculus bawls.
First to the mother I entered a dignified protest:
Said that the music was hard on poetical ears.
Did it have any effect? Not the very remotest!
Save when we meet in the lift and she mockingly
sneers.
Foiled, I endured for a fortnight; but fiercer and fiercer
Daily the melody grew; then I turned to the sire: —
"Sorry to bother, but really—your baby—my dear sir,
Dammit, do something 1 " I wrote, " Yours in sorrow
(and ire)."
He, the good fellow, replied that he pitied me deeply;
My lot was bitter, but his was more desperate still;
Thought, on the whole, I got off, by comparison,
cheaply;
Begged that I'd give him my prayers I Poor devil,
I will.
As for the rest of the world, it is cold and unfeeling;
Even my housekeeper—one in whose arms I was
nursed—
Calls it a lamb! And whenever I yell to the ceiling
(" Cursed be the baby," I yell, "be the baby accursed ! ")
Tells me in triumph (and glares as if 7 were the
criminal)
I was a baby myself I It was ever the rule—
Give 'em a baby in range, and the soundest of women '11
Sacrifice logic to sentiment—silly old fool I
Daily I 'm in at the death of my best inspiration;
Nightly I find myself—roused by that infamous brat—
Sitting up straight in my bed in a cold perspiration,
Sighing for she-bears, or Herod, or something like that.
Ever the demon goes on, and despairing and hollow-«yed
Still (I am told) I must bear this preposterous din

HOW TO ACT A CHILDREN'S PLAY.
INTRODUCTION.
DEAR ETHEL,—Whenever I read a
book or an article beginning "How
to r" 7 always throw it in the
fire; and I expect you do the same.
My " How to'e " are generally called
"How to avoid paying rent" (but
of course you can't really), or, more
comprehensively, "How
to Succeed." Yours, I
suppose, would be " How
to knit a shawl for
Mother's birthday,"
which is a good thing
to know, but rather a
bother. Well, I just
thought I 'd tell you that
this "How to" of mine
is a different pair of bed-
room slippers altogether;
and as your Uncle George
has gone to a great deal
of—/ can't help feeling
—unnecessary trouble to
illustrate my meaning, I
do hope you will learn
the eldest sister to be the one who
marries the handsome Prince; and
at the same time you simply can't
let Muriel be the Queen of the Fairies
and wear the ornamental lampshade.
And so what are you to do?
Well, by an extraordinary bit of
luck I have a little play by me

a lot from what I have said.
By the way, this is really a dedica-
tion, and so should have been written
in the third person, because it is so
much more dignified. I did begin
like that, but the Editor stopped me;
he, said he couldn't help feeling that
what we were gaining in dignity we
were losing in grammar. I think
perhaps he was right, but I shall
insist on italics, anyhow.
UNCLE ARTHUR.
CHAPTER I.—CHOOSING THE PLAY.
OF course the first thing of all to
do is to select a suitable play. The

COAOHINO COUSIN Ton.
Wilbraham kids always do Dumb-
crambo, and there is a man in
London who does Hamlet; but
neither of these is much fun. And
the worst of the old fairy stories
is that, though they have a splendid
part for Harold and Wilfrid, there is
absolutely nothing in them that will
just suit yourself. I mean nothing
really made for you. Now it 's a dif-
ferent case altogether with Enid—
quite a small part would do for her.
But for yourself, you do expect as

which I wrote some I mean
which I have just written especially
for you. It is called
The Wolf;
or,
Prince Rupert and the Fairy Princess.
CHAPTER II.—READING THE PLAY.
THIS is the most exciting moment
of all, because of course everybody is
wondering what the play is about.
The clever author (that means me)
is surrounded by the cast (that
means the whole lot of you), and,
after a hearty tea, he declaims hia
work to them—to the accompaniment
of shouts of laughter, bursts of ap-
plause and the like. Something
in this style:
The Author. The—er—title of our
little play is The Wolf; or
Ethel (reproachfully). Oh, uncle I
The Author. What 's the matter
now?
Ethel. You said there was a fairy
princess in it, and I was going to be
it, and it was to be the chief part.
Muriel (loftily). I 'd much rather
be an ordinary human person.
Wouldn't you, Enie?
The Author. But you are, Ethel.
It is.
Ethel. Then oughtn't I to be in
the title?
The Author. You don't understand.
It 's called The Wolf; or, Prince
Rupert and the Fairy Princess. I
lave to put the wolf in there, but he
hardly comes into the play at all.
In fact he only has a growling part.
Dick and Harold (simultaneously)

it first, didn't I, uncle? Shut up
you didn't.

CHAPTER III.—THE STAGE.
As soon as possible you must come
to Some definite agreement with
Mother about the drawing-room. The
best way is to go into her room one
morning when she is very busy writ-
ing notes, and say quite anyhow (as
though you didn't care a bit): "I
suppose, mummy dear, you don't
mind our doing our play in the draw-

that of course

Ethel, live for
the first part of
your life—until,
in fact, Prince
Itupert comes
and kisses you
and turns you
into a mortal, which, between our-
selves, is a much better thing to
be. Uncle George has drawn a pic- i
ture of this enchanted cavern, and

of course, how it is done. There is
also, you notice, a wonderful magic
pool in the middle of your cavern.

And so on. In
another picture
you'll see how the
cascade 's done.'
CHAPTER V.
DRESSES AND
STAGE DIRECTIONS.
BEFORE I come to the acting, I
had better finish with what they call
"the properties "—which means the
things you make out of other things
ready for the night.
As is always the case, the girls'
things are much
easier to get
ready than the
boys'. An excel-
lent fairy-skirt,
for instance, can
be made from
Mother's best
lamp - shade
—the one with
the frilly things
hanging down;
then, again, a
tea - cosy makes
a good crown
for the Princess.
But I can't sug-
gest anything
that will do for
Prince Rupert's
costume. I really
think that Miss
Pringle will sim-
ply have to set
to and make
something for
Dick out of that piece of blue plush
that was left over.
There is just one tip I must give
you about stage directions. It is very
important to pay attention to the
author's directions to the actors, be-
cause, after all, he wrote the play and


## p. (#518) ################################################

ought to know best how it should be
acted. So when you read a note like
this: “During this speech of the
wicked Baron's, Sunnylocks has been
growing more and more frightened;
he turns deathly pale, beads of per-
spiration stand upon his brow, his
knees tremble more and more, until
at the last horrible threat his very
hair stands on end with terror ’’—
when you come across this you must
see that Harold really does carry out
the author's intentions. Most of it
should be fairly easy for him, but the
last direction does want a little
scheming. The best way is to have
a magnet suspended from the ceiling,
and ready to be let down when re-
quired. Then, just before he goes on,
Harold must dip his head into Wil-
frid's “Chemical Food '' (which, as
you know, has a lot of iron in it to
make him strong), and then at the
critical moment the magnet is let
gently down . . . . Whereupon an
extremely realistic scene ensues.
* Oh, by the way, don't forget the
moon. The best London people
always have them full. I can't say
why.
CHAPTER VI.-How To Act.
THE first thing to remember is that
it is necessary to cross the stage
every time you make a remark of
any importance. I have never quite
understood why this should be so, but
they always do it in London; and what
is good enough for them is
good enough for us. Thus,
if Prince Rupert is on the
right-hand side of the .
stage and you are on the
left, and he says, “I love
you!” you both cross over
before you reply “Ru-
pert ' " I fancy the reason
must be that the common
people who are stuck into
the sides of the gallery can
only see one-half of the
stage; and as they got a
bit tired of never seeing
more than half the charac-
ters in a night they com-
plained to the fireman. He
told the man at the door
who says “Stalls-to-the-
left - dress - circle - this - way," and
gradually it got up to the Manager
himself, who made the new rule.
Of course you have no gallery in the
drawing-room, but you may as well
follow the general custom. Anyhow,
it gives the audience a chance of
seeing both sides of you.
Uncle James will show you several
of the more important gestures, and
you must see that you get these
right. For instance, when the Prince
declares his love he has to put both
hands upon his heart as he leans
eagerly towards the lady. Of course
most of the audience will understand
what is happening, but Grannie, who
is deaf, may not hear the words, and
she will probably upset everything
The CASCADE.
by saying, “ There ! I told him not
to have a second help.”
Did I mention improvisation ? That
means putting in your words when
you have forgotten mine. It is possi-
ble that you may have to do this
sometimes when your memory goes,
as it does in History always; and
then the great thing is to do it as
naturally as possible. For example,
the Prince may be telling you the
story of his adventures in the search

for the magic ring. At the end of
them you have to say:
At such fierce deeds my maiden heart
doth quail;
And yet, fair sir, I thank you for your
tale.
Suppose, however, you have for-
gotten those lines for the moment.
Don't be nervous; and don't rely
entirely on the prompter, because
he may be busy. Just say with a
sweet smile, “What did you say ?” author.
and then, while he is telling his story
all over again (as most men would
be glad to) you can be thinking of
something nice to say afterwards.
CHAPTER VII.--THE NIGHT ITSELF.
So, finally, after all your rehears-
ing and dressmaking and scene
shifting you will come to the night
itself. Aunt Molly will be at the
piano playing The Waltz Dream,”
when you will discover that the
prompt-book has been lost; and at
the same time Cousin Tom will dis-
cover that the best pair of stalac-
tites is his, after all. While he is
expostulating with Uncle James, the
curtain will go up, and Uncle James
will say, “You fool, drop that cur-
tain Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss
Fellowes, I didn't see it was you.’’
Then Aunt Molly will play “The
Waltz Dream ” over again, and
Cousin Tom will come in properly
and begin to growl. Having per-
formed his part with immense vigour
he will retire into the wings and take
his head off, when he will learn that
the curtain has been down all the
time, because they can't start till
the prompt-book has been found.
Whereupon Harold will yell out he
can see through the hole in the cur-
tain, and Uncle Charles has it in
his hand; and Uncle Charles, who
has promised to prompt, but is now
turning over the music for Aunt
Molly, who is playing “The Waltz
Dream ” for the third
time, will be indignantly
sent for. Aunt Molly will
insist on coming behind
the scenes too, to see if
she can help, and Miss
Pringle, who has been
very busy in the green-
room stitching up Prince
Rupert, who had split at
the last moment, will take
her place and play “The
Walt z Dream.” Then
Uncle James will say,
“Now clear the stage
there, please. All behind
the scenes. Where is
everybody? Tom, come
on. Now Miss Fellowes,
we really are ready this
time. The other cord, I think.
On all-fours please, Tom. No, the
other cord. . . . . Now, before Miss
Pringle begins again.
Get behind, Harold.”
And then, all of a sudden, every-
thing will go perfectly smoothly. . . .
And when it is all over—
CHAPTER VIII.
THERE will be loud calls for the
