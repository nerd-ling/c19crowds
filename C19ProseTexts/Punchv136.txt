Mr. PUNCH's PAGEANT is Now on view AT THE LEICESTER GALLERIES, LEicestER SQUARE.
A LEAP-YEAR LAMENT.
So the Old Year is done,
And let me add
The fact that I, for one,
Am jolly glad.
This was the kind of year
I used to laud,
But it has proved, I fear,
A beastly fraud.
I'm disappointed; yes,
I find myself
In single cursedness
Upon the shelf.
0 ladies, why so coy
At such a time 2
I am no callow boy,
But in my prime;
Not beautiful ('tis true),
But kind and good,
|
Points which I fancied you
Quite understood.
Yet, though my charms have been
Fully disclosed,
As all of you have seen,
Not one's proposed.
Still, feeling (as I ought)
Extremely vexed,
There's comfort in the thought
It 's my turn neart.

[JANUARY 6, 1909.
A GUIDE TO POPULAR EMOTION.
[“Perspective is everything when it comes to a question of news; and
the newspaper takes the accurate view of the interest of its readers. . . .
If you count interest by space you will find that nearly every paper
divided its space equally between the seismic horror (which was in
Italy) and the snow sprinkle (which was at our door).”—“The Office
Window,” Daily Chronicle.
Ah! what it is to have a flair
For things that touch the vital part
To put your thumb (and hold it there)
Upon the people's pulsing heart!
To scent the truths that pay you best,
To plumb the common mind of men so
That this you know should be compressed
And that be printed in extenso.
Yonder, by Italy's lovely shores,
Nature takes on her ravening mood;
Earth rocks, and Ocean bursts his doors—
The strand with myriad deaths is strewed;
A world in mourning shares the blow,
Since grief like this draws hearts together;
And yet, it seems, our papers show
An equal interest in the weather.
From where “The Office Window " shines
We get these large perspective views,
That sense of values which assigns
Its native worth to local news;
There, flood and flame and ruining walls,
Horrors from which the numb brain ſlinches
Are balanced here by snow that falls
Reaching a depth of several inches!
Yet when I scan my daily sheet
I sometimes doubt if what one reads
Reflects in superficial feet
The average person's mental needs;
If area represents our taste,
What of the speeches, stupid, solemn,
That through the Session run to waste
In weary column after column 2
Nor does it move me much to hear
Just how a blizzard, blowing keen,
Dammed up a locomotive near
The environs of Aberdeen;
'Tis not demand controls supply;
Petty or poignant, grave or silly,
“This is the stuff you want,” they cry,
And one must take it, willy-nilly. O. S.
-
“Even the London County Council was remembered with gratitude,
is the electric, cars, crowded though they were, conveyed City people
homeward.” The Daily Telegraph.
The italics are ours—to emphasise the Great Thought em-
bedded in this paragraph. It is really wonderful how seldom
these electric cars stop to consider how many people they
have inside.
“Nearly the whole of England and Wales, if it could have been seen
from a balloon, would have been snow-covered.”
The 1)aily Telegraph.
Sven as it was, with nobody looking at it from a balloon,
quite a large part of the country was under snow.
Sir HENRY Corton has said in The New Age that the
partition of Bengal was “the greatest blunder that had
been committed in India since ('Live won Plassey.” If
Clive's victory at Plassey was not exactly a blunder we
can quite understand that SIR HENRY regards it as a very
unfortunate occurrence.
OUR CHRISTMAS PUDDING.
DEAR Mr. Punch,--I have been reading your tragi-
comedy about the charms in the plum pudding, and feel
particularly sympathetic because something of the same
kind very nearly wrecked my own happiness on Christ-
mas Day. Fortunately the issue was a triumph of mind
over matter—or perhaps I ought to say love over loath-
ing. It happened like this. We had just arrived at
the pudding stage, and I felt it was the moment of my
life, and Lizzie, our maid, felt it was the moment of
hers, as she bore it to the table in triumph, and I could
see she 'd been having a grim struggle in getting it out
of the saucepan, for her face was post-office red, and she
had forgotten to turn her sleeves down. Personally, I
had never made a Christmas pudding before, as I have
only just begun to keep house for my brother Harry,
and I could see he looked a bit anxious, for we had
already had one or two trifling failures.
Mr. and Mrs. Bostock and Dick Barry were dining
with us, not that I care for the Bostocks a bit, but I
wanted to please them because they can be useful to
Harry; but I do care for Dick, and I particularly wanted
him to see how domesticated I was, because—well,
every woman will know why. The pudding certainly
looked a picture, its rich brown complexion showing a
vivid contrast to the red holly berries that crowned it,
and in its firm yet spongy interior I had hidden the
usual mascots—a threepenny-bit for riches, a wedding
ring for marriage, and a thimble for spinsterhood. I
managed to give Mr. Bostock the slice with the three-
penny-bit in it, and he was delighted at the attainment of
more riches; but at the second mouthful I noticed a
queer expression cross his face, as he helped himself
again to brandy sauce and passed it significantly across
to his wife. An eloquent silence fell upon us, till Harry
began talking eagerly about the Budget; but even if I
had been interested I couldn't have joined in, for I was
too occupied with wondering what it could be that made
the pudding taste of camphor. The eggs were all right,
I knew, so was the fruit and the suet, and I had just
determined that Lizzie must have used a lump of
camphor instead of soda in washing the forks, when
Mrs. Bostock gave a startled ejaculation and stared at
something on her plate. Everybody stopped eating
with wonderful willingness.
“What is it, Mrs. Bostock 2 " I exclaimed.
“You ought to know that best,” said Harry, hooking
up the offending object on his fork. It was a soft,
whitish thing, and looked like a flabby capsule of sodden
paper.
“Why, it 's only the thimble,” I exclaimed, much
relieved.
“The thimble!” they all cried, incredulously.
“Yes,’’ I replied. “I couldn't find my silver one,
so I put in Lizzie's. It was made of celluloid, and I
expect the-the goodness has all boiled out of it.”
“Good Heavens ! We're poisoned,” groaned Mrs.
Bostock.
Harry turned on me with a face like a thunder-cloud.
“You must be mad,” he said. “I thought you had
more sense. No wonder the beastly stuff tasted of
camphor.”
'' ('amphor, indeed ''' exclaimed Mr. Bostock. “Do
you know, young lady, that celluloid contains nitric and
sulphuric acid and chloride of lime 2''
I shook my head. If I 'd tried to speak I should have
burst out crying. As it was, my eyes were full of tears.
“All excellent things for the system when taken in

And, in spite of all they could say to dissuade him,

6 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 6, 1909.
[908. -
LookING back on the past year I can
see that it has been (as usual) one of
noble endeavour; frequently frustrated,
but invariably well-meant. In accord-
ance with the custom of the newspapers
I have set down here its record of
achievement in the different provinces
of Art, Bicycling, and the like; and I
offer this to the public in full confidence
| of their sympathy and appreciation.
Art.
We have had our photograph taken
for the first time for many years, and if
the result isn't Art I don't know what
is. The photographer said: “Would
you like them en silhouette or straight-
fronted 2 " We said in French that we
had thought of cartes de visite. The
result is a sort of three-quarter face with
one wing forward, and the man insists
| that we must have looked like that once.
The only other achievement in the world
of Art is a moleskin waistcoat of some
distinction. I had no idea that moles
were that colour, but the man swore
that when you had taken the feathers
out of them you found quite a different
coloured skin underneath. As he has
been there and I haven't, I cannot argue
with him. Altogether a good year for
Art. -
Bicycling.
At the beginning of the year our eldest
brother sold our bicycle for a sovereign
and gave the sovereign to our second
brother. A bad year for Bicycling,
therefore.
Science.
(I thought for the moment, Science
began with a C, which is why it comes
in here.)
Several important discoveries have
been made in 1908. For instance, the
small white raspberries in tapioca pud-
ding are meant to be there; you always
thought that they had got in from some
other dish, when the cook wasn't look-
ing. And when your watch gains a
foot you don't put the regulator to A
because it is advancing, but to R because
you want to retard it. (Or else the other
way round—I have forgotten again.
Anyhow, I found out that I had been
doing it wrong.) Another discovery
made in the early part of the year was
the meaning of the phrase “Bank Rate
Unchanged,” but that is too technical
to explain here. A record year for
Science.
Education.
1908 has not been wholly barrem. We
have learnt where Bosnia is.
Finance.
The old system of keeping no accounts
and never filling in the counterfoils of
cheques again answered admirably.
Games.
The past year marks an epoch in the
history of Games. We have retired from
football and are not the cricketer we
were ; but, on the other hand, we have
made immense strides in croquet. We
improve slowly at billiards. In Novem-
ber we potted the red rather neatly, and
everybody said, “There's no getting
away from that—he must have meant
it.” As a matter of fact . . . . . but it
would spoil it to explain. In the early
part of the year we could have shown
you a trick or two in Diabolo. During
October we issued challenges to Gotch
and BURNs – “3:10,000 to the nearest
relative, win, lose or tie,” but luckily
they were not accepted. That is all,
except that I can no longer jump the
ancestral herbaceous border, as the gar-
dener keeps on discovering.
Hydrostatics.
ARchiveDEs’ Principle—that if a heavy
body gets into a cold bath quickly an
equal amount of water gets out on to
the mat quickly -- was demonstrated
daily, to the complete dissatisfaction of the
man on the floor below, who, however,
made a still more important discovery in
this interesting branch of Dynamics:
viz., that water does not find its own
level, but prefers something about ten
feet lower down. --
Indigo.
Indigo has maintained its status quo
throughout 1908. There have been
occasions during the year when we had
almost decided to be an Indigo planter
in Assam rather than stick it in this
beastly country. On each occasion the
weather cleared just before we had
packed the sandwiches.
Music.
Space and time alike fail us to tell of
our notable triumphs upon the pianola
in the year that has just elapsed. We
have played the Sonata Appassionata
and chiaroscuro. The fruitiness and
‘mutty flavour of our rendering of
Remorse–Valse Tzigane, No. L192,999,
kindly return by the end of the month
—will never be forgotten. In July one
of the black notes stuck down and re-
fused to budge for some time; but we
got it up at last with the potted-meat
opener. I say, I don't think much of
Liszt. He has pace and staying power
and is a good strider; quite a useful
man over timber he might be ; but he is
a little lacking in-what shall I say?
Adagio con molto espressione ma mon
troppo, if you know what I mean.
Pets.
Walter, the white mouse, perished in
May. The doctor said it was too much
exercise on an empty—well, he put it
and Shuffling Jasper with equal verre ||
rather crudely. You know what doctors
are. And you know how white mice
will exercise. The tailor said Walter
was too small to make up into a white
waistcoat, even an evening one, and that
he would be hopeless as a tie. I
advertised for a white mole, but they
seem to be rare. Altogether 1908 was
a sad year for pets.
Thought.
Perhaps the past year was above all a
year for Thought. To the pursuit of
Thought we devoted many afternoons in
many positions. Some people would
find it impossible to think properly in
one of those hard, wooden office chairs
with the corrugated backs, but 1908
proved that the impossible could be
achieved—that one could be as busy in
these as elsewhere.
Xylonite.
We did not do any of this.
Yolept.
We were yelept every morning punctu-
ally at 8 (and arose punctually at 9.30)
throughout the year. -
Zeugma. -
I suppose you thought I couldn't do
X. Y. Z. Well, this is just to show you.
In the ordinary way, of course, I should
have referred to the zeugma under
Music. We ordered a low-strung one
last month, but it has not yet been
delivered.
So much for my record of the past
year. Reading it over on this first early
morning of the New Year, I feel that I
have not spent the twelvemonth in vain.
At the end of it I can say truthfully that
I am, if not a year wiser, at least a year
older, a year fatter. And now, as it is
just two o'clock, I will start the New
Year well by carrying out my first reso-
lution—that of going to bed early.

SERIALS FOR ALL.
IV.
OUR next specimen is from The Athe-
maeum. Its title is
IRENE'S ERROR,
A STUDY IN REPARATION.
Principal Characters:
WELRED RUSSELL, a patient compiler.
IDA, his daughter.
MARTIN CUTTER, a reviewer.
IRENE PANKSNAY, a female novelist,
MostyN DASENT, a male novelist.
O'DECIMo, a publisher (known as the
Jew O'Decimo). -
SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERs. *
Welred Russell, having just completed
his magnum opus on the protective colour-
ing of postage stamps, goes off to Broad-
stairs for a week's rest before he begins
a new work. He takes the MS. with
him to number the pages. While he sits
on the esplanade with his daughter, she
attracts the attention of O'Decimo, who
also is staying there, and he determines
to marry her. He therefore contrives a
remcontre with her father, whose name he
knows, and by gross flattery wins his
way into Russell's heart. Russell im-
proves the occasion by tendering his MS.
for publication, and the Jew O’Decimo
is so enamoured that he not only takes
it, but offers £100 on account of a 15
per cent. royalty, thirteen to count as
twelve, which are better terms than
Russell had ever received before. The
only condition is that Miss Russell shall
bring the proofs every day as they are
read to the office. Miss Russell, who
meanwhile is secretly engaged to Martin
Cutter, a reviewer, temporarily agrees, as
she knows it is her father's only chance
of getting his book published.
O'Decimo therefore goes off with the
MS., and puts it in his safe. It happens
that he has there also the last new
novels by Miss Irene Panksnay, What
of the Night? and Mostyn Dasent, her
great rival, The Redness of the Rose.
It happens also that Miss Panksnay,
goaded to fury by the success of her
rival, and properly indignant at the
deplorable tone of some of his purpler
patches, has determined to break into
O'Decimo's premises and steal and de-
stroy Mostyn Dasent's new MS.
Armed with a skeleton key, she does
so, opens the safe, abstracts what she
thinks to be The Redness of the Rose,
and, hurrying with it to Waterloo
Bridge, drops it into the Thames. She
has now just discovered that it was not
The Redness of the Rose, but Mr. Russell's
treatise on the protective colouring of
postage stamps.
CHAPTER VII.
Irene staggered across the room in a
state bordering on mania.
She looked again at the paper, and
again read the fatal paragraph:–
Broken into by burglars last night, the safe
of Mr. O'Decimo, the well-known publisher,
was robbed of a valuable manuscript of that
rising author, Mr. Welred Russell. This work,
which had occupied Mr. Russell for many years,
dealt in the most exhaustive and fascinating
way with that alluring theme, the protective
colouring of postage stamps. That it should
have excited the cupidity of the thief is there-
fore not surprising; but that the world should
lose it is a matter of the gravest import.
Mr. O'Decimo has offered a reward of £100 to
anyone returning it to him and no questions
asked. -- -
Irene was in despair. What should
she do? She was a humane and just
woman, and her one idea, she repeated
to herself, had been to deprive the
reading public of a book which she
honestly believed to be a danger. And
in her foolish haste she had taken away
and destroyed the harmless work of a
deserving author.
Destroyed ?
But had she? How long would it
need for Thames water and Thames
mud to obliterate and ruin a closely-
packed manuscript 2 Some days surely.
There was time even now to dive or
dredge. -
She started impulsively for the bell,
but almost immediately checked herself.
Of what use to dive and dredge? It
could not be done in private, and to do
it publicly would be to brand her deed
—her jealousy 2
No, rather must she keep her secret,
and by all the means in her power make
reparation to the unfortunate Welred
Russell, the author.
Having thus decided, Irene pressed
the electric button.
It was answered by a page. (Accord-
ing to Mostyn Dasent’s quip, this was
the best page of all her many thousands.)
“Get me the Post Office Directory,”
she said in the beautiful silver tones
that had enchanted so many bazaar
audiences.
The boy returned almost in the twink-
ling of an eye.
Irene fluttered the pages breathlessly
till she came to Russell. She looked
down the list—
Russell, Charles
Russell, G. W. E.
Russell, T. W.
Russell, Welred
Ah, there it was. She hastily com-
mitted the address to her ivory tablet
and bade the page blow three times for
a taxi.
“It's only once now,” said the boy.
“Of course,” she said. “How foolish
of me! But I am all unstrung.”
In a few moments the taxi was at the
door and she was on her way to 131,
Bloomsbury Street, Welred's address;
only, however, to learn that the family
was at Broadstairs.
“To Broadstairs " " she cried to the
taxi driver.
“Impossible, madam,” said he. “I
have neither the petrol nor the pluck.”
“Then drive me to Charing Cross,”
she replied.

SYNopsis of PREVIOUS CHAPTERs.
Lord Selvage, a wealthy nobleman
of great goodness of heart but deplorable
taste in dress, has bet his friend, Sir
White Westcott, E10,000 that within
three months he will be the accepted
suitor of Lady Angola Lapel, the reign-
ing débutante of the season. Lady
Angola, on her side, has promised her
father, Lord Kerseymere, that she will
never wed a man who wears ready-
made clothes. But she is strangely
fascinated by Lord Selvage's personal
magnetism, and, torn in two between
love and duty, begs for a week in which
to consider his proposal, and promises
to give him an answer at Lord's on the
day of the 'Varsity Match, which happens
to be the last day of the three months
specified in the wager.
CHAPTER XI.
Lord's on the day of the University
Match — a brilliant summer day,
when the most recherché efforts of
Nature were equalled and eclipsed by
the triumphs of Sartorial art. On all
sides one saw the cream of England's
womanhood faultlessly gowned, and the
fine flower of England's youth tastefully
garbed in the height of fashion. It was
the luncheon interval, and brave men
and dainty women were refreshing them-
selves, after the strain of two hours'
attentive observation, with choice comes-
tibles and sparkling beverages.
Admirably placed, Lord Kerseymere's
drag, crowded with a bevy of Society
celebrities, attracted universal attention,
and Lady Angola Lapel, in a wonderful
tailor-made confection, was the cynosure
of every eye. But the proud beauty
wore a far-away, distraite air, and paid
but little heed to the gay badinage of
Lord Harris Tweedie and Prince Serge

de Vicuna. Nor was her anxiety un-
natural, for this was the day and the
hour on which she had promised to give
a decisive answer to the most opulent of
her myriad suitors—Lord Selvage of
Cashmere. His generosity was a by-
word, but so was his wardrobe. Dressed
at times in the height of fashion, he
would at others flout the decalogue of
Mode by appearing in ready-made suits
of the most deplorable cut and pattern.
Suddenly a tremor ran through the
vast assemblage. A strange figure was
seen approaching the drag. He wore
brown boots with black spats, blue
flannel trousers, a greyfrock coat tightly
buttoned across his chest, and -crown-
ing horror—an American grass straw
hat. Strong men fainted and delicate
women shrieked as he remorselessly
Fº his way towards the drag. Alone
dy Angolaretained herself-possession,
though her features were drawn with
agony; and as Lord Selvage—for it was
he—raised his infamous headgear and
gazed with fond inquiry full in the face
of his inamorata, she hissed out the
single word “No” in a thrilling whisper,
and Lºrd Selvage fell prostrate on the
emerald sward.
There was no more cricket at Lord's
that day. The news spread with light-
ning speed to the pavilion, and the rival
Blues, by a unanimous vote, resolved to
cancel a fixture which had been so
horribly desecrated.

Lastly, we may conclude with a
severely condensed extract from the re-
markable psychological serial which is
appearing exclusively in The Westmin-
ster Gazette:–
THE EGG DANCER.
By ALFRED JAMEs and HENRY BAGshot.
Principal Characters:
ARTHUR BELPER, a philosophical states-
Illall.
Mrs. SPANGLER, an American journalist.
HiLARY BoLLAND, an ex-diplomatist.
JonAli BRUMFIT, an Imperialist politician.
ANNICE WoRPLE, an Eurasian egg-dancer.
Lord HAITINGER, a Tory Democrat.
SYNoPsis of PREVIOUS CHAPTERs.
Arthur Belper, a Conservative states-
man deeply addicted to psychological
research, has developed a style so cryptic
and complicated that none of his sup-
porters are able to fathom his meaning
or intentions. After patiently enduring
his masterly ambiguities for several
years, they grow restive and resort to
the plan of employing Mrs. Spangler,
an American interviewer and accom-
plished hypnotist, to elicit a comprehen-
sible eirenicon from Belper which will
satisfy the conflicting demands of the
various sections of his Party. The pre-
liminary negotiations occupy Chapters

CHAPTER XXXIX.
The great fact, all the while, however,
admittedly, had been his incalculability,
since he had “supposed " himself, from
decade to decade, to be allowing, and in
the most liberal and intelligent manner,
for the exigencies of political evolution.

characteristically, admitting himself with

“I believe in the flower,” she broke
out. “I feel that it would have been

tremulously after a luminous pause;
“but he is grim and worn, and with
his great clumsy monocle, he does not

who
Desires to fill the stage to-day
Should write his plays like M. BRIEUx.
Denounce Peer, Plutocrat and Priest,
Iłich man and poor man, saint and
sinner,
Dives dyspeptic at his feast,
And Lazarus without his dinner;
Set up the pulpit on the stage—
The dramatist secure inside it
Thumping his cushion in a rage.
That is the modern mode. I tried it.
Untempted by the golden lure
Of popular appreciation,
I only lusted to secure
A small attentive congregation.
Later, I said, a larger throng
Will gather round me as a teacher.
I only need to pitch it strong,
Like Father WAUGHAN, that moving
preacher,
But he
Till finally my fame shall spread
So wide that, though my coat is shabby,
When I am comfortably dead,
They'll lay me snugly in the Abbey.
So, scorning critics' blame or praise
(Since critics always think it funny
That anybody writing plays
Should write for anything but money),
I set all thought of pelf aside,
And even, while I could, extracted
A certain melancholy pride
From ranking with the Great Unacted.
An audience fit but few, said I,
A leading man on half his salary,
Acting he knows not what or why
To a half-empty pit and gallery,
That is the most I hope at first,
One of those orgies on a Sunday
Where censored masterpieces burst
Like bombshells upon Mrs. Grundy.
I can't pretend to hope that I
Shall rouse the interest BARKER rouses
When even Mr. GALsworthy
Plays to such very empty houses,
But still the drama's vogue is far,
Yes, very far from being ended,
While Mr. SUTRo's motor-car
Costs such a lot and looks so splendid.
Such was my young ambition's dream.
But flee ambition, oh, my brothers!
Ignore her ignis fatuus gleam
And realise — with MAUGHAM and
others—
'Tis better far to win the bays,
The gilded bays, of popularity
Than spend your days in writing plays
For one performance at a charity.
So I will bow in Rimmon's House,
And with my fellows make obeisance,
And nothing any more shall rouse
My pursy soul from its complacence.
And if as I descend the aisle,
Grown rich at last and sadly fatter,
I catch the bland and mccking smile
Of G.B.S., what does it matter?
I shall have won my piece of earth,
My M.V.O., my wreath of laurel,
Have sold my soul for what it's worth.
They buy it. And we needn't quarrel.

so,' said Mr. Croker, “although I don't suppose

(2) “‘I would not be a Member of the British

make anything but an American out of me.’”

in the country of origin, and which are

IN SUMMER-TIME OR WINTER-
TIME.
IN Summer-time, in Summer time—
But that was years ago—
No day was ever long enough,
For mone was ever slow.
And those who romped and frolicked then
Through every flowery day
In cheerfulness and innocence
Were like the birds at play.
The birds they had a brighter note,
The flowers a deeper glow—
But that was in the Summer-time
A hundred years ago.
In Winter-time, in Winter-time
How cheerily went the hours
The holly then was all our joy;
We had no thought of flowers.
The holly-berries seemed to have
A brighter tint of red;
The lawn, so green in Summer days,
With whiter snow was spread;
And every cheek with health was flushed
From sporting in the snow—
But that was in the Winter-time
A hundred years ago.
In Winter-time or Summer-time
What merry songs were sung,
When every step was light as air
And every heart was young.
Then, whether robed in rustling green
Or cloaked in silent white,
The trees, the tall familiar trees,
Looked just supremely right.
But now the songs are weak and ſew,
And nothing seems to show
As in the old and happy days
A hundred years ago.
Too Young at Sixty-Nine.
“The Earl of Leicester, who has just cele-
brated his eighty-sixth birthday and who is the
“Father' of the House of Lords, is one of the
most remarkable living examples of family
longevity. The long period of 154 years has
elapsed since his father was born, and his
father was in his sixty-ninth year at the time of
his birth.”—Westminster Gazette.
But surely that cannot be regarded as
a fair start 2

THE OLD STYLE IN THE LANE.
Peter Pan and Pinkic between them
don't seem to have done much damage
to the old stock-pantomime, if one may
judge from the huge audi nce that sat
patiently through most of the Dick
Whittington show at Drury Lane on New
Year's Eve. I cannot say what may
have happened during the dinner-hour,
but a great deal of patience was needed
after that. The songs that I heard,
topical or other, were poor stuff, the
knockabout business rather tedious, and
|the humour of the dialogue pretty thin,
except when Mr. WILKIE BARD relieved it.
The HERO of The PANToMIME.
Mr. GEORGE ALI in his great smoking feat.
I can well believe that Mr. ARTHUR
CoLLINs has once more surpassed himself
in the splendour and costliness of his
scenery and dresses, for that is what
they always say; and, indeed, the alder-
manic ideal was very sumptuously illus-
trated in the Harbour of Gold; but I
would gladly have done with smaller
crowds and a little more real dancing,
in place of all that trotting and skipping
through a maze of stuffy, meaningless
Inlanoeul VI’es.
I have nothing to sayagainst Miss TRULY
SHATTUCK, for the courage with which
she carries off a name like that dis-
arms criticism, and, after all, she did
just what she was supposed to ; but one
longed to exchange her Prince of Phan-
tasia for just a moment of Pickle or the
Queen of the Fairies from His Majesty's.
Mr. Wilkie BARD found a godsend in
his catch-song, “She sells sea-shells on
the sea-shore,” which, with the assist-
ance of a confederate in the dress-circle,
he tried to make the audience learn by
heart. His quiet humour was very
pleasant indeed. So was that of Mr.
GEORGE ALI, as Mouser. Ignoring the
acrobatic traditions of the pantomime
cat, he gave a superb exhibition of
intelligent resºrve. Miss MARIE GEORGE
was not given much chance for her
gamineries; Miss QUEENIE LEIGHTON was
harmlessly conventional as the Principal
Boy; and Miss MARIE WILSON made a
pretty and natural Alice. Those who
contrived to hear her voice thought that
she sang nicely. Mr. AUBREY FITzGERALD
introduced some clever burlesque, but he
was meant for better things and better
company.
I am half afraid that I have not writ-

THE INCOMPLEAT BURGLAR.
HE was at it again last night. I
woke with a start, and heard him
stealthily cutting a pane out of the
French window downstairs. After
that he crept into the house, and
padded quietly about the ground-floor
rooms, appropriating anything that
took his fancy. Yet this morning,
when I went down to breakfast, the
window-pane was puttied in its frame
again, as neatly as if a glazier had
done the job, and nothing was
missing. -
Strictly speaking, I suppose I
ought to have gone down to attempt
his capture. But I really don't
know what I should have done with
him if I had caught him ; I am averse
from bloodshed, especially in the
home, and, with the policeman pass-
ing only once in twenty-four hours,
there might have been some awkward |
delay—time which it would be
difficult to fill in tactfully—before
the moment for giving him into
custody arrived.
now that he always restores what he
picks up, I merely lay still and
listened. “It is only honest Burglar
Bill,” I said to myself. “Presently
his better mature will gain the upper
hand again, and he will go away, an
erring but not a dishonest man.”
Before I understood his idiosyn-
crasy I did look for him once or
twice, with a poker. But the only
result of this enterprise was to excite
the dog, who had not heard the
intruder, but joyfully welcomed
the supposition that a new, a better
era was dawning, and that sociability
was to be extended henceforth into
those dull, small hours that hang so
heavily at times on one's paws.
Burglar Bill evaded me altogether,
and, on the whole, I am not sorry
that he never came within reach of
my poker.

Some people say that the chang-
ing temperature of the night air can
make floorboards creak, and cause
staid old arm-chairs or bureaus to
kick out. Perhaps; but the night
air was never yet cooled that could
take a pane out of a window and put
it in again. People who doubt the
existence of Burglar Bill are cynics,
with no belief in the ultimate good-
ness of human nature; but for the
sake of such a belief I cling to my
theory of a strong, erring man whose
conscience ever pricks him when the
really difficult part of his job is over.
I can see him doing silent battle with
his evil, angel in the dark rooms
downstairs, the veins on his brow
standing out in the intensity of the
struggle. Slowly, for it means food
and drink to him, he puts back the
cruet-stand that he has abstracted
with such patient skill from the side-
board cupboard; slowly the tears
trickle down his furrowed face; then,
in an agony of remorse, in altogether
uncontrollable agitation, he runs up
a few stairs and down again, plays
one muted note on the piano—I have
never been able to account for this—
and so, having robbed one of nothing
but sleep, passes out silently and
sorrowfully into the night.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM tired of stories of the German invasion of England;
of the landing at Felixstowe (is it?), and the gallant defence
by the Mayor; of the rise of all the waiters (slow, easy-going
men as they have seemed to me), and the advance upon
Epping Forest. I wish that for a change (failing my little
romance of the Sandjak invasion of Novi-bazar) somebody
would give us the story of a French or an Italian raid.
Nevertheless I am grateful to Mr. H. G. WELLs. The War
in the Air (GEORGE BELL) shows us Germany once more as
the aggressor; but this time it is America upon whom her
double eagle eye is cast. The accounts of the air-fights do
not move me much, but the adventures of the Cockney hero
on Goat Island, Niagara, are thrilling. This is Bert Small-
ways, one of the great Kipps family, which only Mr. WELLs
can draw; and he is so well done that I could have wished
he had been the hero of a humbler tale. Until, that is, we
got to Goat Island, when I was all for more fighting. The
War in the Air is an immensely interesting story, well
written, of course; but - -
charcoal-burners, I incline to think myself defrauded if there
is not an ogre or two in the tale and a sprinkling of fairies.
This, however, may be mere prejudice, and there is much in
Little Peter to make amends. Peter himself, for instance, is
wholly delightful. But for that very reason I object the
more strongly to his end. I do not like nice little boys,
especially Peters, to be carried away by angels in the last
chapter. Children have no business with the theory that to
die young is the reward of amiability. For one thing, it
puts a premium on bad tempers.
Dan to Beersheba (HEINEMANN) is the happily-named title
of Mr. ARCHIBALD Colquhoun's latest work. To the already
voluminous and valuable story of the author's travels in four
continents it adds records and descriptions of Burmah, Siam,
Southern China, Central America and South Africa, where
he made the acquaintance and gained the confidence of CECIL
Rhodes. The South Africa Company, under that great man's
direction, was at the time engaged in annexing the vast
territory now known as Rhodesia. Mr. Colquhoun was
appointed to administrative post with promise of eventually
having charge of Mashonaland. His narrative of the advance

it seems to lack single-
ness of aim and so does
not quite hit the mark.
On the other hand it
gives the reader an op-
portunity of deciding
by the one book whether
he prefers his author as
a realist, romancist, or
sociologist.

unanimous youthful

and Lady RITCHIE's
the least hint of it with-
out giving away enough to spoil the interest, excepting for
those cautious readers who guard against shocks by taking
the last chapters of a story first. But perhaps I may
mention two subsidiary attractions. There is a most endear-
ing set of people in it, and my own appreciation of them is
not, let me confess, affected by the fact that one or two
of them owe much to the tactfulness of their former indiscre-
tions. And there are opened several vistas of thought which
make the book a good deal bigger than its three hundred
and fifty-odd pages, closely printed. If I were to try to
build a sort of literary Colossus out of the many novels I
have read this last year, Mr. MALLock's book would certainly
supply the brain for the whole.
Of the making of literary Peters there is no end, nor does
it appear that some among the older ones lose with time
their power to charm. Of such is evidently LUCAs MALET's
Little Peter (FRowde, HopDER AND STOUGHTON), who makes his
reappearance in a dainty new suit of white-and-gold, with eight
most sympathetic and really illustrative pictures by CHARLEs E.
BRock. It is a guise in which he will be very welcome at this
holiday season. Personally, when I am given a book about a
little boy who lived, once upon a time, at the edge of a dark
wood, the son of poor but honest parents, and intimate with
Fairy Blackstick in the
Blackstick Papers (SMITH, ELDER) is of the easy-going,
garrulous, gossipy kind, dainty and easy of movement, agile
in speech, reminiscent in mood. She loves to stand meditat-
ing on Brighton Parade, that no longer neglected thorough-
fare, or to muse in the windows of a house on the front, and
there to call up the ghosts of past literature and dead fashions
—the literature of THACKERAY, the fashions of a day rather
earlier. These Blackstick Papers, by THACKERAY's daughter,
appearing lately in the Cornhill, wisely avoid comparison
with the Roundabout Papers which THACKERAY himself con-
tributed half-a-century ago to the same magazine, then in its
infancy.
Germany, according to The Standard's Berlin correspon-
dent, is much exercised as to what Englishmen wear in
town.
“The dispute arose at a rehearsal of the English play Mrs. Dot.
In the first Act some men drop in to afternoon tea at five o'clock with
a hostess. The question arose, What would these men wear in such
circumstances in London’’’
The proper costume would, of course, be a brown-coloured
bathing suit, neck to knee. The L.C.C., however, does not
encourage mixed bathing at the hour mentioned.

A GUIDE TO POPULAR EMOTION.
II.
[It will be forgotten that in our last issue we quoted The Daily
("hronicle's dictum about journalistic “perspective" and its approval of
the principle on which an equal space was allotted to the accounts of
the disaster in Sicily and the snow-sprinkle at home. We have now to
report (on the authority of The Daily Mail, which gave nearly half a
column of its chief page to the luscious announcement), that “a new
standard of lavishness in the social life of New York" was established
by Mr. and Mrs. GEORGE J. Got LD on the occasion of the introduction
of their daughter MAR jokie to New York society. The entertainment
was “the most gorgeous in the history of the American plutocracy, out-
shining even the famous BRADLEY MARTIN entertainment some years ago."]
IN Liberty's chosen patch of earth
Where all are equal at date of birth,
Where bullion sprouts in the open air
And every man is a millionaire–
If you are anxious to shine aloud
Above the ruck of the gold-edged crowd,
It isn't enough to give a feast
At fifty dollars per man or beast;
It isn't enough to give a ball
On an amber floor in a topaz hall;
Nobody notices things like that
In the mere routine of a plutocrat;
Your only hope is to go one more
Than anyone else has gone before.

In the social manners that stamp that spot

A fifty-thousand-dollar rout
For an innocent daughter's coming-out,
With 80 flunkeys to swell the pomp
Of little Miss MARJonie's virgin romp ;
For they meant that the show she made her start in
Should break the record of BRADLEY MARTIN ;
Dull the splendour and spoil the gilt
Of the best début of a VANDERBILT,
And reach a luxury past the scope
Of the courtly functions of old Európe.
True, it is no affair of mine
How American boomsters dance or dine,
That Momma arranged to knock the town

Answer to Correspondents.
“Forſ: SCOTSMEN.”- Your request that we should explain
the humorous intent of a certain paragraph in a recent issue
of Punch would have been a most unusual one if it had come
from any other quarter; but coming as it does from Scotsmen
—and four at a time, too — it must be almost without
parallel. If you will send one or more of your names, accom-
panied by a corresponding number of stamped and addressed
envelopes, we shall have pleasure in sending you the answer,
which is quite easy. But we must decline your invitation
that we should publish it in these pages, as we cannot
believe that it would be of any general interest.
HINTS TO BEGINNERS.
MY DEAR YoUNG MAN, I'm going to assume that you
haven't done much yet. You've tried to start yourself here
and there, and very little good has come of it. Mr. John
MURRAY and the rest of them have shown a deplorable lack of
enterprise, and the result is that Hannibal : A Tragedy in Fire
Acts, though it was type-written, still reposes in your diawer
in company with enough short stories to make a volume, and
a sequence of seventy MS. sonnets dealing with all the
aspects of life. These publishers are shocking bunglers, of
course. They know next to nothing of their own business,
and their only way with genius is to distrust and reject it.
Still, what are you to do? You can't force these dull
fellows to take your work, and print it prettily, and offer it
to the public, and advertise it all over the press of England.
You can only hope that some day you may find one of them
in a lucid interval of literary intelligence. Then, of course,
Hannibal will come out, and Mr. BEERBoIIM TREE will recognise
in it the one thing he has been looking for, and your fortune
will be made. All that, however, seems to be a long way off,
and in the meantime, as I said, you're waiting. You're
even thinking of advertising yourself as a potential secretary
to a Member of Parliament, having heard of cases in which a
man rose from that position to be a C.V.O. or a member of
the British Academy or a Fellow of the Royal Geographical
Society; anyhow, something very brilliant, which was
supposed to make a deal of difference to his wife.
Now, I don't see why you should wait any longer. These
hints of mine are going to put you in the right way to make
money and a name. You will think of them in after life as
“Iłints that have helped me,” and some day, when you pass
a certain house in the Goswell Road—it is in the Clerkenwell
district—you will observe to your companion that there was
once a man who lived in a three-pair back there and knew a
thing or two about the literary market. Then, having with
difficulty caused your 40-horse-power motor-car to be turned
round, you will hasten back to the Festival Banquet in aid
of the Society for the Relief of Broken-down Novelists, you
being in the chair.
What I want you to do is a very simple thing. First of
all you must get out of your head all your silly old-fashioned
ideas about modesty and reticence and the young person who
holds the record in blushes. Then you are to sit down and
write a preface—a fairly long one, mind you. Short prefaces
are quite useless for the book you are going to write. Here is
a short working model of the shady book's preface. Have I
mentioned, by the way, that you're going to write a shady
book? No matter; you know now, and there are no more
secrets between us.
“It was not without long and anxious consideration,” you
will begin, “that I determined to write and publish this
book. It is the fruit of much thought devoted to some of
the problems that lie at the root”—why problems always
rest there I don't know, but you must take things as you
find them—“at the root of our social system. Men still talk
glibly of marriage. Priests mumble their solemn incantations
over a ceremony which the most advanced intellects have come
to regard with contempt, and which is doomed cre long to dis-
appear both from the conversation and the customs even of the
British Middle Classes.”
After four pages devoted to this cheery iconoclasm you
can proceed like this: “While this book was appearing in
a serial form '-it never did, of course, but that 's of no
consequence—“it aroused a storm of controversy. To the
critics who saw in it nothing but “a farrago of indecency,' I
offer the compliment of my scorn. But there are others.

Hundreds of letters have reached me from those who have
groaned under the weight of the world's conventions. They
have recognised—I quote from the letter of one whose name
as a mother and a worker in the field of social reform is well
known—that “the literary excellence of the book is equalled
only by the purity of its motive and the refined directness of
its method in dealing with situations which the weak-minded
might describe as strong, merely because the artificialities of
our lives have made them unusual.'” After three more
pages of this and a few references to the matchless delicacy
of the French, you can wind up the preface.
When you've done this you must write your sample
chapter, not the first one, but one of the three great ones in
which you defy the commandment which comes between
the sixth and eighth, and smash into smithereens all that
antiquated moralists have taught. Then you take your wares
to a publisher—there are one or two who are on the look out
for that sort of thing—and you show him the preface.
His eyes will glisten. “My boy,” he'll say, “can you write
up to this?” Thereupon you'll bowl him over with the
sample chapter, and he'll give you a contract at once—
£1,000 down on account of royalties calculated at 30 per cent.
Then you go home and write the rest of the book.
Of course there are some disadvantages. Some of your
friends may cut you. Would-be moralists will hold your
name up to loathing and execration. Here and there a
reviewer may fulminate against your “disgusting book”—
but the book will sell like hot cakes and you yourself will
become celebrated and wealthy, especially after you have
discovered the inevitable clergyman who will protest in
print over his own signature that the book is the apotheosis
of decency, the very consecration of all that is pure and
wholesome. So make haste and get to work.

Palace Terrace, to her newly-married
niece, Mrs. Livesey, “Rosemount,”

April 17, 190–.
MY DEAR SARAH,-I am not, as you
know, by any means satisfied with your
marriage, which I consider both impru-
dent and perilous. Mr. Livesey is not
at all the husband I should have chosen
for you myself. He is a weak although
doubtless amiable man, whereas what
you wanted was someone capable of cor-
recting your foibles. He is also, I under-
stand, a Radical and a vegetarian, and
probably an Agnostic, and is therefore
not in the least calculated to direct your
mind as those who really love you would
wish. However, since there is no use
now in saying any more, I have decided
henceforward to consider him as one of
the family (although I hope that when
you come here to stay you will let me
know exactly what he can eat and what
he cannot) and cease to criticise; and it
is with much pleasure that I am sending
you a piece of old glass from my own
collection for your table as a memento of
my wishes for your happiness.
Your affectionate Aunt MERCY.

to tell me what to do. Aunt Mercy
having forgiven us, sent me, yesterday,
a very beautiful cut-glass bowl, which
unhappily came smashed to atoms. What
am I to do? Shall I tell her the awful
truth that it is broken, or shall I simply
say thank you ? It seems so dreadful
to have to tell her it is broken just after
she has written such a letter; but if I
don't there is always the chance that she
may come to see us and ask for it. Do
advise me. Your loving S.

the truth, because no one has ever taken
her in. She has been like that ever
since we were girls. I think you must
be brave, dear, and say that it came
broken, but doubtless owing to a fall in
the Post Office and not at all because it
was carelessly packed. Yes, I think
that is best. * *

MY DEAR AUNT MERCY,-How very kind
of you ! What a beautiful bowl! But
I am exceedingly sorry to say that when
we unpacked it it was found to be broken
all to pieces. The packing was perfect,
so it must have been the result of a fall
on the way. We are greatly disappointed
and distressed, and I am wondering if
you can tell me where I could buy
another like it.
Your affectionate niece,
SARAH LIVESEY.
P.S.—Joseph, who spent hours last
night putting the pieces together, and
who joins with me in love and gratitude,
says he never saw a more beautiful bowl.
W.
Miss Norman-Crudge to Mrs. Vansittart.
April 21, 190—.
DEAR RHODA, - A most unfortunate
thing has happened. I went to some
self-sacrifice over my wedding present
for Sarah—my motto being that it is
absurd to cry over spilt milk, and now
that she has definitely taken that very
unpleasant man for her husband it is
the duty of us all to make the best of it.
It was one of my choicest cut-glass
bowls and of very unusual design. It
left this house in perfect condition, very
carefully packed by Yates; but Sarah
tells me that when it arrived it was in
fragments. Under the circumstances,
especially considering how disappointed
we all had been by this marriage, I
think that had I been Sarah I should
have held my tongue and merely have
said thank you, leaving me in ignorance
as to the catastrophe. But she has been
very oddly brought up, and that nice
thought for other people's feelings which
our dear mother did so much to teach
you and me is no longer in fashion. I
am, however, sending them another
bowl, as I should not like them to be
without any memento of me.
Your loving sister MERCY.
WI.
Mrs. Livesey to Mrs. Vansittart.
April 25, 190—.
MY DARLING Mother, What is to be
done? I am so sorry to trouble you
again, but you know Aunt Mercy so
much better than I do. She very kindly
sent another glass bowl, but by really
extraordinary bad luck, that one came
broken too. There seems to be a fatality
about it. What can I say to her this
time? How can I tell her such an awful
truth twice running 2 Joseph says that
it is old glass and cannot be matched;
but don't you think he had better try?
Do tell me. Your loving
Wii.
Mrs. Vansittart to Mrs. Livesey.
April 26, 190—.
MY DARLING CHILD,--I am all unstrung
by the new calamity; but I don't think
you need hesitate this time. I should
just write to thank your Aunt and make
no reference to the bowl's being broken
at all. I say this, because she wrote me
a letter rather complaining that you had
told her the first time. She seems to
think it would have been kinder to her
not to. I was troubled when I got that
letter, but now I am relieved, for it
makes our duty clear. I do so hope
Joseph will be successful in his search ;
but I fear the worst.
Your loving MoTHER,
P.S.—Of course it will be dreadful if
Joseph cannot match it and your Aunt
Mercy comes to see you. You will have
to tell the truth then, I suppose; but it
will be easier after some time has elapsed
than now so soon after the other. We
must hope for the best.
VIII.
Mrs. Livesey to Miss Norman-Crudgc.
April 27, 190—.
MY DEAR AUNT MERCY, -You are more
than kind to send another bowl. I can't
think where you find such beautiful
things. Joseph is in raptures over your
taste. We shall never forget your kind-
Iless. Your affectionate niece,
SARAH LIVESEY.
IX.
Miss Norman-Crudge to Mrs. Livesey.
May 24, 190—.
MY DEAR SARAH,-I am now able, I
find, owing to the illness of my old friend
Miss Vyner, who was to have come here
for a fortnight, but now cannot, to pay
you the visit which I have long promised
myself. I could come on Monday next
by the train which reaches Warwick at
5.48, and stay till Friday quite comfort-
ably. This will give me time to get to
know your husband, and, I trust, to
esteem him. I should like to have Yates
with me, but can doubtless manage
without her if you have any lack of
room. I am a very easy guest, as I
always bring my own tea and shall
arrange for bread by post.
Your loving Aunt MERCY.

[JANUARY 13, 1909.
THE MOTOR MYSTERY.
THE following documents have lately
come into Mr. Punch's hands. They
are all in the same writing (with the
exception of the telegrams), and appear
to have been addressed to the same
person. In case they throw any fresh
light upon recent events in Wales, Mr.
Punch, who is determined not to be
outdone by his contemporaries, offers
them now to the public.
I.
DEAREST, I have practically settled
it for Saturday week, then it won't be
in the papers till Monday, and that
gives me all Sunday. The only ques-
tion is, Where? I think the sea, not a
river, because they can drag a river,
can't they, or something horrid like
that ? Do they ever drag the sea 2 Find
this out. Probably in the Encyclo-
pardia under “Nets.” Or what about
“Divers ”?
Certainly you will have to be with
me, and I'm afraid we shall have to
have one of the chauffeurs as well. Of
course, nice people always believe a
lady, but journalists and policemen and
horrid people like that are so suspicious,
and I think it will be safer if we have
a man with us to say so too. Now, can
you find a nice place where the road
goes quite close to the sea, and where
it is high tide on the Saturday night?
Do this for me, please. When you have
found the place, then you find out about
the tide from the local paper—it depends
on the moon, I believe. Do we want a
moon or not? More romantic, of course,
but also more risky.
Write at once and tell me you have
done all this for me. I am horribly busy
taking a house up here which I have
just seen. Rent only £200 a month,
which is nothing much, as next January
I am coming into a fortune, and my
trustees Oh, but I was forgetting;
you know all about that
Ever lovingly yours.
P.S.–I may have to borrow one of
your veils on Saturday week; I know
you won't mind; I am quite out of
them.

here at once. Very important.

ward, but still we all know that if a car
runs into anything you do want to shoot
out in front through the glass ; so if you
have found a high tide quite close to
the road it may be all right. Otherwise
we shall have to work it out to see how
far I should go. I have just found
another house I think I shall buy, so
must stop.
IV.
No, dear; my mind is made up. It
isn't only the £2 1s. 11%d. I owe Preston.
There are other bills even bigger than
that, if you only knew all.
Yes, we shall have to go on with it.
I am glad that the dear old car will be
with me till the very end. That and the
dogs are all I ever cared about. Oh, and
diamonds and houses of course. The
dogs' Oh, I've such an idea suddenly
Suppose we can't find a suitable road,
then—why shouldn't I say I have been
swallowed by one of my St. Bernards 2
It would be just as difficult to locate
the body, and so on. You could say
you saw it being done—a lady's word,
you know, they'd have to believe it.
But of course the motor smash would
be more romantic. I am a little worried
about you, dear. If I am going to be
thrown right through the screen and
into the sea you will have to be hurt a
little, won't you? I am sure you won't
mind doing this for me. It is these
little bits of local colour that journalists
and stockbrokers and such people like
so much. I would suggest that you
and Albert (or whoever we take) should
be found underneath the car. Of course
you couldn't very well have got there
by way of a parabola; but ordinary
people wouldn't think of that at once,
and they would be impressed, I’m sure.
They would have the idea anyhow that
we were trying. Let me know what
you think of this.
W.
DEAREST, Aren't you just a little teeny
weeny bit selfish 2 Of course I never
wanted you to break an arm or a leg or
anything like that, but I did think you
wouldn't mind doing a few cuts and
scratches for me. Nothing very deep,
you know. However, if you won't you
won't, I suppose. You'll have to have
a “miraculous escape” then. In a way
erhaps it's as well, because I have
º that the car mustn't be damaged
much, and so now, if people say that
you'd been found unconscious, half
under and half outside the car, every-
body would have seen at once that some-
thing awful had happened.
WI.
[Telegram.]
St. Bernards have suddenly become
very fierce and hungry. Am terrified
for my life.
Wii.
MY DARLING, How sweet of you ! I
was just beginning to think we should
have to do it the other way and was
getting things ready for it when your
letter came. Of course I shall not be
with you when the accident actually
happens, but I can trust you, can I not,
to make it as realistic as possible in
every way? Don't hurt yourself too
much, dear—for my sake. What a
splendid idea about the hat! Can you
lend me one 2 as I have nothing of my
own that would quite do. Thank you so
much if you would. What a splendid
place you have chosen ' I don't know
what you mean, dear, by saying that
there may be danger. I shall be quite
all right, and if the worst comes to the
worst I can simply say that I knew
nothing about the accident and wasn't
there at the time. Will you get me a
book about Australia and send it to me?
What weather we are having—so cold!
My dear, if it had only been summer
We could simply have gone for a bathe
together! But that wouldn't have been
so exciting. What fun I shall have
reading the papers'
Ever yours most lovingly and grate-
fully.
P.S.—I hope you will keep the car for
yourself as a present from me for your
kind help in this business, as I could
not very well take it away with me.
Perhaps, after all, it would be better if
you did damage it pretty well. You
might start it at the top of the hill and
let it run down by itself. A. A. M.

MR. PUNCH'S PUZZLES.
ALWAYsabreast of the times, and never
afraid of profiting by a good example,
Mr. Punch, deeply impressed by the
“Claudius Clear Problems” now appear-
ing in The British Weekly, ventures to
commend to his readers the solution of
the following topical literary conun-
drums.
DEAREST, HI hope you got my telegram,
and sent the book. I was talking to a
man about accidents and bodies going
through the air, and so on, and he says
they always go in a parabola, and that
the distance anything goes depends on
the relocity of projection and the angle that won't be much good. Dear, I don't
of elevation, whatever those are, and that quite know what I’m saying ; the fact
you can find out all about it in Loney's is I'm so bothered by your standing

If Mr. CLEMENT SHORTER had been a
contemporary of Dr. Johnson, and had
called on the Doctor with the view of ob-
taining a signed photograph for repro-
duction in the literary page of The

declined to let him have it, and used
the most injurious language about
“bookmen,” “literary gossip-mongers,”

don't think so at all, seeing that I wasn't

have been the most dignified form of
rebuke in which Mr. Shorter might
have signalised his reprobation of Dr.
Johnson's gross discourtesy and in-
gratitude?
Mr. JAMEs Douglas, the famous literary
critic, once met Mr. AIGERNoN Swinburne
in the library of the House of Lords.
Mr. Swinburne mentioned to Mr. EDMUND
Gosse that he could not understand why
it was that no critic had done full justice
to the sonnets of Mr. Theodore WATTs-
Duxton. Mr. Gosse demurred to this
view, but Mr. Swinburne said that he
must be mistaken, and before an audience
including three dukes, seventeen earls,
and a viscount, he spoke for nearly
three-quarters of an hour in support of
his opinion, proving beyond all shadow
of a doubt that Mr. Theodore WATTs-DUN-
Tox was the most outrageously neglected
major poet of the century. All this time
Mr. JAMEs Douglas had a marked copy
of The Star in his pocket containing an
article in which he said that “by the
side of the sonnets of Watts-DuNToN
those of SHAkspeaRE and Milton were
the immature effusions of irresponsible
ineptitude.” What should Mr. JAMEs
Douglas have done, and why?
Mr. Thomas Blight, the famous biogra-
pher, is engaged, as is well known, on a
Memoir of PARNELI, which, in the number
and irrelevance of its illustrations, bids
fair to eclipse his own most strenuous
efforts in this direction. If, as some
devoted admirers of the “Uncrowned
King” believe, it should turn out that
PARNELL were still alive, and he suddenly
were to confront Mr. Blight and demand
an explanation of his intentions, what
º: Mr. Blight to say, and why?
rd Rosslyn once met Mr. HENRY
JAMEs, the novelist, at the house of a
well-known Duchess with literary tastes.
During the course of luncheon Lord
Rosslyn asked Mr. HENRY JAMEs what
he thought of Sir CoxAN Doyle's novels.
Mr. HENRY JAMEs, with great kindness,
proceeded to explain in minute par-
ticularity how it was that, by a
strange coincidence, he had never been
so favoured by fortune as to be able to
complete the perusal of one of the novels
in question. When Mr. JAMEs had
spoken for about two hours, Lord
RosslyN suddenly remembered that he
had an engagement in the City at
3 p.m. What ought Lord IRossLYN to
have done, and how 2
Dr. Robertson NICOLL, whose evergreen
vitality is a constant source of rejoicing
to his brother bookmen on both sides of
the Tweed, once visited Sir WALTER

undertake a lecturing tour in America.

Robertson NicoLL spoke seriously to the

production. “My experience and obser-
vation,” said the eminent journalist,
with his accustomed modesty, “have
taught me that four things cannot go
on–carelessness, idleness, extravagance
and headiness. The author who gets a
motor-car because his first novel has
done well is likely to repent his adven-
ture.” “But,” mildly replied Sir WALTER,
“I have not got a motor-car, nor am I
likely to.” Ought Dr. Robertson NicoLL
to have apologised for his anachronism
or vindicated it, or said nothing 2 And
if so, why?
When Mr. HALI, CAINE was yachting
off the coast of Norway a few summers
back he lunched with the GERMAN
EMPEROR on board the Hohenzollerm. The
talk falling on literature, the KAISER
observed, “I have been given to under-
stand that in the opinion of the cog-
moscenti the two greatest living English
novelists are GEORGE MEREDITH and
Thomas HARDY.” “Speaking as a Manx
novelist, Sire,” rejoined Mr. HALL CAINE,
“I am with you.” What ought the
KAISER to have replied, and why?
Extract from a Baboo's letter:—
“On way from Karslin I lost my breakfast
for two days consecutively and two days alter-
nately, but it could not make me weak, as I
lived on biscuits.”
What a fine testimonial this would have
made for the Food Reform Association.
The latest news of Miss ELKINs is that
she has become a nurse. Her thoughts
were probably turned in this direction
by the fact that the Duke of the ABRt zzi's
last communication to her was, according
to the Yorkshire Erening Post, “a cable-
gram of 200 wards.”

IN offering their New Match to the

claim to have solved a problem of
universal importance. Without enter-

Messrs. Phewsy and Manstickkor state
with no fear of contradiction that these
essentials of every household have in-
variably failed in one respect, viz., that
they have only been matches. In a
utilitarian age this is not enough. Why,
in fact, waste the shaft 2 The New
Match is at once a sweetmeat, a stimu-

motorists and bicyclists, combining as it
does a light meal with a phosphorescent
flame. It has deprived night of all
terrors, and has rendered the Daylight
Saving Bill unnecessary. The difficulty
of living on sixpence a day has been
solved. For the bedside, seaside and

LATELY IN “KITCHEN LANCERs' we Thought
BACK TO THE GOOD OLD TIMES.
RECENT events point to a return to the
modes of the above era. The papers
have already reported snow in December,
a Christmas ghost, and highwaymen,
carefully masked, on Hampstead Heath.
Put we have exclusive information of
the further spread of the movement.
The night (according to a wireless from
our Cornwall representative) was murky.
A yawl under full sail tacked about out-
side Trepolpen Cove. “There 's old
Sam's light,” exclaimed the skipper, and
he put the helm hard over, the little craft
leaping forward towards a faint glimmer
on the coast. Presently a voice rang
out--a thin, cultured monotone—from a
muffled figure in oilskins sitting on a
keg forrard : “Dear me! (or words to
that effect) we are on the terrible rocks!”
Once more the weather-beaten salt
put down the helm, and by only a
cigar's breadth did the little vessel
escape the fearful Barnacle Rocks.
“There's Sam's light,” cried someone,
indicating a gleam on the port bow;
and the little boat felt its way cautiously
until at last it was beached on the soft
sand of the Cove.
“Ay, ay, Sir,” said old Sam from
the shore. “’Twas a wrecker's light 'ee
see 'pon the cliff; but I've got 'ee in the
cave, fast bound, the rascal' "
“Wreckers in the twentieth century !”
exclaimed the cultured voice in horror.
Then it added: “Boys, you will convey
the casks and keg to the cave and thence
to the secret cellar beneath the Itectory,
as usual.”
“Iss, sure, Sir,” said the skipper, with
a grin. The Smuggler King (for the
muffled figure was indeed he and no
other) left the men to unload, and, draw-
ing a pistol, went to the cave to inter-
view the desperado who for mere gain
would send his fellow-men to a terrible
death.
There in the Cimmerian gloom the
two men faced each other, and simul-
taneously each put his hand to his brow
and started back in amazement.
“Passon " '' exclaimed the wrecker.
“Passon the Smuggler King ! Well
I'm blessed '''
“Trelawny — you a wrecker!” said
the Rector gravely. “I am ill pleased
to find you here,” he added truthfully,
“and as a churchwarden your conduct
is, I consider, most reprehensible.”
The two strong men then shook hands,
and swore to let bygones be bygones.
“The coming year will be one of Birthdays.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ROOFER.
I MARRIED Charles for three reasons.
Firstly, I wanted a useful man about the
house. Secondly, I wanted someone to
look after the luggage and be in attend-
ance generally, when I went away on
week-end visits. Thirdly, I wanted
literary assistance when, upon returning
from those visits, the awful necessity
arose.of writing the roofers. Charles,
| in his ignorance, used to call them
bread-and-butter letters, showing thereby
not only that he was behind the times,
but also that he did not appreciate the
truth that hostesses must be thanked
as much for the loan of their roof as for
the use of their bread and butter. Now
he knows better, so that, when we sat
down to compose our letter of thanks to
Mrs. Fanshawe for the week-end we had
just spent at her place, we regarded
ourselves as sitting down to write, not
the bread-and-butter letter, but the
roofer.
Monday.—The first obstacle was the
date; but here we experienced little
difficulty, for by combining my excellent
recollection of Christmas with Charles's
wonderful power of calculating back-
wards, we got tolerably near the mark.
The next part I did entirely by myself,
and, I say it without pride, it was the
work of a moment to compose the pre-
lude:—“My dear Mrs. Fanshawe.”
What then 2 Ah then we were
indeed in the midst of difficulties. I
felt that it was now Charles's turn, and
Charles felt that it was now time to go
to bed. So we addressed the envelope,
licked the stamp, and considered our-
selves entitled to leave the rest until
to-morrow.
Tuesday.—It was now to-morrow, and
there was my dear Mrs. Fanshawe un-
thanked and Charles sitting before the
fire as useless as only a Charles can be.
“Come, Charles,” I said, “my peroration
is complete and your work still remains
to do. Let it be a letter combining the
maximum of gratitude with the mini-
mum of gush. Let it be thorough but
epigrammatic, hearty but not vulgar,
original but not affected, meat but not
gaudy. Keep those few and simple
directions in your mind and fire away.
I will write as you dictate.”

“That is my bit.”

“Be a man,” I said.

that jewel bright, I write (as indeed, how
can I not 2) to thank . . .”
“Excuse me, little one,” I interrupted
once more, “what small chance we have
of being asked again depends entirely
upon our merry temperament and the
jocular way we have with us. Begin
again.”
“My . . . .” he began.
“That stands,” I said.
“Re recent visit. I am now in a

good health. I find the fog, on the one
hand, still with us, but my silver-backed

put this down to the carelessness or
criminal intent of the official who packed
my bag, and must insist upon their imme-
diate restitution, in default of which I
shall find myself under the necessity of
taking such steps as my solicitor may
adrise . . . I may take it that you have
left your brushes behind 2 ''
“Mr. Marriott,” I said indignantly,
“how many times must I tell you that
your wife is perfect? Of course I have
left nothing behind.”
“Then we cannot write this letter
to-night, for there is nothing to write it
about. You should make a point of
always leaving something behind.”
And so we put it off till the next day.

morrow, and Mrs. Fanshawe, though still
as dear as ever, yet remained unthanked.
This Charles, I began to think, was
something of an ass. “What do we

asked ; then, a little later: “Omitting
the affectionate part, let it run thus:
I must thank you for a delightful week-
end. We got back to town all right. We
are all well here. Is not the weather
most seasonable 2 I hope you are all
well there. We are all well here. When
I say ‘we,' I mean Charles and myself.
Thanking you again, I remain yours
sincerely, Violet MARRIOTT.”
“Best-looking of all the Charleses,”
I said not unkindly, “you are a
splendid husband, but no letter-writer.
We must telegraph.” And so it came
to this:
“Fanshawe, Pelton. Thanks for de-
lightful wreek-end. Too busy to write.
Marriott.”

TRIALS OF THOMAS.–No. 3.
THE CIIRISTMAS HOLIDAYS.

Master Jack. “ALL RIGHT, Thomas, You Go FIRST.
You 'RE sure to BREAK it, A
ND THEN I'LL GET over ALL RIGHT."
A HUMAN-TALE.
It was a dark, damp, uncomfortable
January afternoon, no weather for out-
door revelling, and the young fairies
began to feel time hang rather heavy
on their hands. Finally, when the
smallest of all fell into a dewdrop and
had to be hauled out by the heels and
wrapped in dandelion fluff to dry before
a glow-worm, the atmosphere of the
Palace nursery became so ominous that
the Big Fairy had no alternative but
to suggest reading aloud as the only
way of keeping them all quiet.
“But what shall it be?” she asked,
to which they instantly replied in chorus,
“Oh, a Human-tale, please !” because,
you know, there is nothing that the
young fairies love half so well, especially
at Christmas time, as a story about
Humans, with, if possible, motors and
telegrams and all sorts of magics like
that in it. So the Big Fairy produced
from somewhere a wonderful human
newspaper, that she pretended she had
found lying in the grass outside the
Palace, and prepared to read.
“What first 2 " she asked ; and the
young Fairies, who were all of them'
Princesses in their own right, chorused |
again, “The Court News, of course!”
so she cleared her throat and began :
“Court of Bankruptcy * *
“Is he a very powerful king?” inter-
posed the smallest fairy.
“Very,” said the Big Fairy decidedly;
“there's lots about him here.”
“Do get on " " cried the others.
“‘An examination was held yesterday
into the affairs of Josiah Bunting, retail

smith Road, Balham, who filed his own

“‘Debtor ascribed his position mainly
to the recent slump in Kaffirs, in which
he had been induced to dabble beyond
his means x * x
“What are Kaffirs?” demanded the
smallest Fairy but one.
“Kaffirs,” answered the Big Fairy,
who was exceedingly well informed,
“are a kind of purplish humans, with
spears. Something like thistles.”
“Go on,” said the smallest Fairy|
said the
ecstatically. “Did they slump him on
purpose?”
“I'm afraid so—‘and to the fact that
he himself had been in failing health.’”
“What's fai–?” began the smallest
Fairy, but the reader intercepted her.
“Failing health,” she said quickly
and firmly, “is a thing humans are in
just before a failure. Don't interrupt.
“No settlement having been proposed,
after some severe comments by the
Receiver, discharge was suspended in-
definitely.' That's the end of that
story.”
“It's rather sad,” said the smallest
Fairy.
“Fancy if it was all true !” exclaimed
the smallest but one.
“Don’t be silly,” said the eldest with
superiority. “There's no such things as
Humans really. They're only nonsense.”
“I wouldn't be too sure of that " ''
interposed the Big Fairy indulgently
(such a playful manner she had with
children). “There is certainly a place
called Balham. I’ve been there.”
“Have you!” cried the chorus, awe-
stricken. “Oh, kind, dear Big Fairy,
do take us there, too !"

“Why?” asked the Big Fairy. “It’s
a quite ordinary place, really, just en-
chanted woods and an ogre's castle or
two ; nothing out of the way.”
“But perhaps,” said the smallest,
solemnly, “if we went there, and were
dreadfully good, and shut our eyes, and
imagined hard, we might see them our-
selves. The Humans, I mean, and
Ladysmith Road, and the Kaffirs, and
the Assets and everything !”
“Well, well,” answered the Big Fairy,
“I was young myself once, and, anyhow,
if you can't see that sort of thing in
the Christmas holidays, you never can,
that’s certain. We'll try this very
might.”
But the smallest Fairy still looked
thoughtful. “I don't think,” she re-
marked gravely, “that it was quite
kind of the Kaffirs to slump. If we
found any, could we ask them not to ?”

him.) There, you're all right now !

burst of clapping greets the entrance of a
star, during which Stanley stealthily
sneaks his mother's and sister's hats
from under the seat, places them on the
string bag, maintains his position on the
top by tightly clutching a strange foot
which penetrates from the seats behind,
and begins to enjoy the entertainment.)

his hat to investigate, and turns round to
D. M. with pink streams running down
his face.) Teally, Madam, I must pro-
test at your allowing your boy to play
tricks with my hat. You ought to keep
him under proper control.
Stanley. It's Gladys's ice!
Gladys. I want my ice
D. M. (glaring at Stout Gentleman
from under her broken hat-brim). Proper
control, indeed! I think it is for you to
explain how my child's ice, for which I
paid a shilling, comes to be in your hat?
Stout Gentleman (flinching before her
fierce aspect). I can't explain it. Madam.
It's a most extraordinary thing !
D. M. It is indeed, and very hard on
my little girl. However, it's no use to
her now. Come along, my bird. Now
then, Stanley, make haste. (Hustles
them out before her, leaving the Stout
Gentleman mopping his head and face
with a large bandana handkerchief and
shaking the remains of the melted ice
out of his hat on to the floor.)
TOLD TO THE SEA-HORSE
MARINES.
[By private cable from Our Own New Guinea
Correspondent.]
Papua, Jan. 8th, 1909.
FROM a Report of the French Geo-
graphical Society which has just reached
us out here I gather that a lecturer from
Mexico has been explaining to that
learned body the use of the turtle as a
marine motor, affixed to a canoe and fed
with fish. To show how this idea may
be developed among really civilised
races, I will tell you of a thrilling
episode in connection with a neighbour-
ing island off the North of Australia.
Marine monsters are here habitually
used for naval purposes, a two-power-
standard in porpoises being maintained
against the neighbouring islands, and a
fleet of 30-knot sharks being kept per-
manently in harbour in case of invasion;
indeed a deficiency in armoured sword-
fish once led to the downfall of the
Ministry. -
The island I speak of, in which I take
an intelligent interest, had with great
difficulty tamed a gigantic five-thousand-
mackerel-power whale, and by fitting it
with electric light, jury masts and turrets
had established its naval supremacy and
demonstrated the superiority of whale
traction in war, besides solving to a
considerable extent the problem of un-
employed mammals.
War suddenly broke out, and we
had just mobilised our fleet of turtle-
destroyers, when to our horror the
enemy sprang upon us a Dreadnought

sea-serpent of the most modern type,
heavily armed with jelly-fish and rigged
with a fighting-top filled with native

It was a moment for action. We
reversed our trusty whale, submerged
him, and using him as a submarine
passed right under the enemy's fleet.
To procure a number of electric 500-

action was the work of two or three
minutes. We submerged the whale
once more, after loading the immense
cavity in its mouth with the electric
eels. Getting abeam of the sea-serpent

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE story of the life of Dr. Jameson (HURST AND BLACKETT),
: told by Mr. SEYMOUR Fort, is useful as throwing light on
some episodes of modern history. It describes in detail the
| early advance and settlement on the choice lands of South
;| Africa of the Chartered Company under the inspiration and
leadership of CECII, RHODEs. The chief attraction of the book
will, however, be found in the personality of its hero. Settled
in Kimberley in practice as a doctor, JAMESON became in brief
time administrator of a territory as big as Great Britain, led
| a raid across the borders of a friendly nation, was cast into
prison, and lived to be Premier of a State in which Britons
| and Dutch dwell together in comparative amity. The madness
of the Raid was brought out in strong light a few years
later when the power of England was strained to its utmost
in the effort to accomplish a task lightly undertaken by Dr.
JAMESON with his troop of five hundred irregular horse.
It must, I think, be rather nice to be Mr. EDMUND FRANcis
SELLAR ; not, however, because he has written Glentyre (BLACK-
wood), but because, having done so, his power of self-appre-
ciation, and perhaps also the applause of his friends, were
such as to persuade him that the general public would derive
six-shillings' worth of entertainment from its perusal. How
splendid to have friends like that! Did they actually laugh,
one wonders, at the crocodile mistaken for a prehistoric
monster, or at the lantern lecture, or at the habit, common,
apparently, to many of the author's personages, of tumbling
down upon the very slightest provocation ? Enviously, and
with the best will in the world, I must confess my inability to
follow them. Indeed, to speak by the book (a sufficiently
weighty fashion in this instance') the attempt to make a
Scots Cranford of the village chronicles of Glentyre seems to
have been doomed to failure from the outset. Honestly,
Mr. SELLAR has not quite the touch for this kind of thing;
and though, to do him justice, here and there traces of a
genuinely comic idea are discernible—the old lady who has
been told that she “understands gentlemen” is a case in
It is evident from Mr.
Fort's friendly narra-
tive that the Doctor,
fresh from triumph in
Matabeleland, was a
trifle enlarged. He had
grown to believe in his
star, as did another and
greater Raider. The
result was that he came
a disastrous cropper,
played blindly into the
hands of the astute
OoM PAUL, and hurried
on what was perhaps
an inevitable war. Ad-
mitting this, Dr. JAME-
son comes out of it all
plucky, light-hearted,
chivalrous, careless of

projects of CECIL RHODEs.

Byam Warner, British West Indian poet and drunkard,
began to put on paper what he believed to be the most
beautiful poem ever conceived. Never, he had told his
newly-wedded wife, had he written a line except under the
influence of stimulants, and, when he fell in love with her
and swore off alcohol, the Pierian spring automatically dried
up. If he did not drink neither could he write. Once the
honeymoon was over the old cravings returned, and the girl
who had married him in order to wean him from the bottle,
unable to bear the sight of his sufferings, determined, at the
risk of ruining his body, to save his soul from becoming
atrophied. So she brought forth brandy in a decanter
and left him to his poem and his fate. The picture may be
true to life. It certainly reads as if it were. But in spite of
its cleverness and the gorgeous framework of island scenery
and West Indian manners and customs of seventy years ago,
it seems to me unnecessarily depressing. I prefer my
brandy in a liqueur-glass or else diluted with soda.
but little girls have a
habit of growing up, and meantime they sometimes fall
in love. At any rate, the heroine of The Trail of the
Lonesome Pine (CONSTABLE) does so; and Mr. John Fox, in
this his latest novel from Kentucky hills, makes both her
and her lover—who was none other than the unknown
Knight of the Winsome Smile—as attractive as true heart
can wish. The book is a careful study of developing character
as well as a delicate romance with a lawless background.
And since Cupid does not here make his puppets breathe
their vows with too much of a nasal twang the ordinary
Briton, who is equipped with a colossal ignorance of the
vocabulary of the Wild West, will find no difficulties of
dialect to vault over. A most enjoyable novel.
“A very pretty table decoration for the dinner table is a winter
scene carried out by using what will appear a frozen pond, made
from a large oval or oblong mirror frosted over with a sponge dipped
in a bath of Epsom salts and beer, using as much of the salts as the
beer will take up in solution.”—The Erening News.
The writer should try again. With a little thought a better
use for beer could be found than this of mixing it with
Epsom salts and making a bath of it.

HEALTHY LONDON.
REMARKABLE TRIBUTEs.
DESIROUs of testing the evidence recently submitted by
various eminent authorities as to the extreme healthiness of
London, Mr. Punch has made it his business to interview a
number of aged residents. The results, which indicate a
remarkable consensus of opinion favourable to this view, are
here appended
Miss Arabella Burble, of 10, Marine Parade, Hoxton,
interviewed by our representative, attributes her longevity—
she is in her 109th year—to the combined effect of the metro-
politan climate and a rational diet which she has followed
for the last seventy years. Up to the age of 78 she was a
non-smoker, but, beginning with penny Pickwicks, she has
since developed a taste for tobacco in all forms, and now
seldom consumes fewer than 50 cigarettes in 24 hours. For
solid food she -relies on pickled tulip bulbs and charcoal
biscuits, washed down with ammoniated quinine. Run over
a few weeks ago by a motor-bus, Miss Burble walked home
without assistance, and wrote with her own hand a letter to
The Hoxton Gazette, describing the invigorating results of
her experience.
Mr. Jonah Whale, of 11, Paragon Buildings, Poplar,
is another concrete example of the extraordinary healthiness
of the metropolitan climate. Born in Norfolk, he was a puny
child, and suffered indescribable agony from rheumatism,
coleopteritis, metatarsal strabismus and other incurable com-
plaints, until, in his 88th year, he moved to London and took
a charming little bijou residence in Poplar. From that day
to this he has never known an ache or a pain. In his 95th
year he developed a beautiful tenor voice, and, on the occa-
sion of the visit of our representative, sang all the latest songs
from the pantomimes, including “She sells sea-shells by the
sea-shore,” with a verve and articulateness that might have
done credit to a popular preacher. Mr. Whale, though slim
in his youth, is now a man of massive proportions, with
raven hair, and a ruddy complexion. His memory is so good
that it is a common practice of his, after reading The Daily
Mail, to chant the entire contents by heart in a minor key,
accompanying himself on a Norfolk biffin.
Albert Bostock, of 17, Maeterlinck Road, Haggerston, a
burly nomagenarian with a voice like a bass tuba, ascribes
his perfect health to the exhilarating climate of London.
The only time he was seriously ill was during a cruise in
the Mediterranean, when the morbid purity of the atmo-
sphere seriously affected his nerves, but about of London fog
speedily set him to rights. His favourite recreation in past
years was to travel on the Underground between Baker Street
and Portland Road; latterly he has found the inhaling of acety-
lene fumes in motor-buses an invaluable cure for depression.
Marischka Palacky, the wonderful Hungarian child pianist,
whose recitals have excited such an amazing furore during
the last few weeks, was interviewed by our representative
in the gorgeous suite of rooms which she occupies at the Hotel
Schmitz. Marischka, who is only six years of age, though
greatly struck by the intellectuality of British audiences, is
still more deeply impressed by the splendid salubrity of the
atmosphere of London. “Since I came here,” she observed
in her charming broken English, “I have felt ten years
younger. Indeed I am certain that, on the principles of
harmonic progression, if I were to live in London till I
was 100, I should still retain all my old infantile abandon
and élan. But even if I only manage to spend six weeks in
London every year I shall be able to surmount the difficulty
enshrined in the famous saying, Si jeunesse savait, si vieil-
lesse pouvait.” Here Mlle. Palacky paused to refresh herself
with a box of caramels, and, apologising for the brevity of
the interview, returned to her study of Cicero's De Senectute,
a work which she is translating into Magyar.

May 25, 190—.
My DARLING Mother, A dreadful
thing has happened. Aunt Mercy has
written to say she wants to come from
Monday to Friday of next week to see
us and get to like Joseph. The terrible
thing is the glass bowl, because poor
Joseph has never been able to match it,
chiefly on account of the smallness of
the bits, which we kept, but which the
glass people cannot manage to put to-
gether satisfactorily. I am not at all
strong just now, and the prospect of
having to face Aunt Mercy and tell her
about the bowl is too dreadful. What
shall I do? Is it safe to tell her we
cannot have her? Please telegraph.

MY DEAR AUNT MERCY,-I am so very
sorry, as it would have been a great
pleasure to have you here under our
roof, but both Joseph and the doctor
think I am not quite strong enough for
a visitor just now. Not that I am at all
ill, but I have been rather run down and
I might not be able to look after you
and take you about as I should wish.
So, dear Aunt Mercy, I hope you won't
mind postponing your visit for a little
while. Your affectionate niece,
SARAH.

Miss Norman-Crudge to Mrs. Liccsey.
May 26, 190—.
MY DEAR SARAH,--I am sorry to hear
of your poor health, but you must not
think that the fear of being left too
much to myself will deter me from my
project of seeing you and your husband
—with perhaps a peep at the bowl on
the table ! It will interest me to ex-
plore Warwick alone, and I shall be
glad also to do what I can to nurse and
amuse you. The only difference it will
make is that I shall now certainly bring
Yates, as she is so clever with beef-tea
and jellies, and is a perfect nurse.
Your affectionate Aunt MERCY.

catching; but Aunt Mercy would be

tonic and preparing for the worst.

Yates has telegraphed that Aunt Mercy
is in bed with influenza. Joseph was so
excited that he insisted on my having
some champagne for lunch, although of
course not joining me. I don't seem to
mind anything now, although I suppose
it will all begin over again.

MY DEAR SARAH,--I want you to be so
good as to do me a little service. There
is to be a bazaar here next week in con-
nection with the new organ for St.
Michael's, and as I want it to be a great
success I have undertaken to arrange a
small but tasteful exhibition of old china
and glass and perhaps a little choice
furniture in one of the smaller rooms.
The bowl which I gave you for a wed-
ding present is so excellent a specimen
of its style and period (although inferior
to the one which you said arrived broken)
that I should like to include it. The
bazaar lasts only three days, so that you
would not be deprived of your treasure
for more than a week altogether. I
enclose a postal order for half-a-crown to
defray the cost of transit and professional
packing.
Your affectionate Aunt MERCY.
XVIII.
Mrs. Livesey to Mrs. Vansittart.
July 17, 190—.
My DARLING Mother, it is all over
now. I have told Aunt Mercy that the
bowl is broken. I had to do it because
she wrote asking to borrow it for an
exhibition. Joseph would not let me
worry about it any more. He said there
had been trouble enough about the
wretched thing and he would settle
the matter once for all; and this is what
he helped me to write. I send it to you
in case you see Aunt Mercy and she asks
you any questions:–
“DEAREST AUNT MERCY, I am very
sorry that I cannot send you the bowl,
because unhappily it no longer exists.
It is broken ; and by a curious clance
it happened on the very day that your
visit to us, to which we were looking
forward so keenly, was postponed. (This
is a dreadful story, dear mother, but I
seem to have been telling mothing else for
years.) At the time that Yates's kind
telegram was brought saying you were
ill in bed and could not come to us aſter
all, Joseph was carrying the bowl up to
my bedroom with fresh roses in it, as
we always made a point of never letting
the parlourmaid touch it. (This about
the parlourmaid is literally true, dear
Mother, although it sounds like another')
As both his hands were full he told
Mills to open the telegram and read
it to him, which she did, and no sooner
did he hear the sad news than the bowl
slipped out of his hands and was utterly
smashed. We have the pieces still, but
the mending people say it is impossible
to put them together again. I hoped
that I should not have to tell you, dear
Aunt Mercy, but perhaps it is better to
have done so. One does not like to
deceive, even out of consideration for
another's feelings. Both Joseph, who
is naturally very unhappy about it, and
I hope that you will not think it neces-
sary to give us another present.
“With much love, I remain,
“Your affectionate niece,
“SARAH.”
There, dear Mother, I think that that
must be the end anyway, whatever hap-
pens. I will tell you what Aunt Mercy
says. Do come and see us soon, dear.
Your loving S.
XIX.
Miss Norman-Crudge to Mrs. Livesey.
July 18, 190—.
MY DEAR SARAH,-I am of course very.
sorry to think that both my beautiful
bowls have ceased to be, but the very
natural circumstances of the destruction
of the second one help to reconcile me.
Poor Joseph, I do not wonder he was
upset. I shall not make the experiment
of giving you glass again, but I hope to
see something more durable when next
I visit my old furniture dealer. The
exhibition, you will be glad to hear,
promises to be a great success, even
without the bowl.
Your affectionate Aunt MERCY.

get your letter, with your Aunt Mercy's
enclosed, and to feel that everything is
now all right again. It shows how im-
portant it is to tell the truth, for until
she knew it was broken there was no
peace of mind for any of us. I am sure
I have suffered almost as much as you.
My one fear is that when I meet your
aunt when she pays her annual visit
to Scotland next month I shall forget
what happened, and that might be
terrible. I can't help feeling it will be

A SAD CASE.
IN a recent lecture on “Insect Life,”
Mr. MARTIN DUNCAN is reported to have
said that “he had seen a Death's Head
Hawk-moth in a hive, very much in-
toxicated and giving vent to squeaks.
It was surrounded by an admiring crowd
of bees, evidently much impressed by
this vocal demonstration.”
We have received the following letters
on this subject. The first is one of
indignant protest from the insect in
question. He says:—
“I have read with the greatest annoy-
ance and disgust the libellous state-
ment attributed to Mr. MARTIN DUNCAN.
In the strongest possible terms I repu-
diate the dastardly suggestion that I
was drunk on the occasion mentioned,
and I may add that I have been a life-
long member of the Young Abstainers'
Union. The courtesy extended to Mr.
DUNCAN in admitting him, as a privi-
leged guest, to the concert referred to
has been ill repaid. He has accused me
of intemperance and he has held his
hosts up to ridicule. As a matter of
fact I was in perfect voice on that par-
ticular night, and my friends the Bees
expressed themselves in the most flatter-
ing terms with regard to my rendering
of “Put me among the Girls.’ This
performance Mr. DUNCAN coarsely and
ignorantly describes as ‘squeaks.’ His
ill-considered sneers have done irrepar-
able harm to my career as a professional
vocalist (for terms and Press notices
see small bills), and I have instructed
my solicitors to commence an action for
heavy damages against him.
Yours truly, ACHERONTIA ATRopos.”
Miss Mellifica Apis writes:—
“As a member of the audience at the
concert described by Mr. MARTIN DUNCAN,
I should like to say there is not a word
of truth in his amazing statement that
Mr. Atropos was inebriated on that
occasion. Mr. Atropos sang with rare
charm and feeling, even for so gifted
an artist, and I think it is a great shame
The New Maid. “Yes, she's AT HOME.
DoEs YER GIT showed IN, on Does YER sit 'ERE 7”
that Mr. DUNCAN, who was invited only
as a special favour, should so abuse the
hospitality of the hive.”
“A Follower of Mrs. CARRIE NATION,”
in the course of a long and vehement
letter, says:—
“Mr. MARTIN DUNCAN's graphic picture
of the nauseating orgy which he wit-
nessed in a bee-hive is an object-lesson
which degraded man would do well to
lay to heart. Here we have the disgust-
ing spectacle of a company of bees, all,
probably, more or less under the influ-
ence of liquor, applauding and encourag-
ing the maudlin antics of a hopelessly
intoxicated moth who hiccoughs tune-
lessly and obscenely before them. It
is terrible to think that even blameless
insects should have come under the
awful Drink curse. And who invented
the Drink 2 Man . Man' Who, in the
first instance, tempted and encouraged
the insects to drink? Man again!
Filthy, drink-sodden man. . . . . * >
[Our Fair Correspondent's language
here becomes so intemperate that we
are obliged to curtail the rest of her
letter.—ED.]
Interviewed by a representative of
the London News Agency, Mr. Atropos
said that he had nothing to add to the
letter which he had sent to the Press.
Asked if he could give any reason for
Mr. DUNCAN's extraordinary statement,
Mr. Atropos said that he regarded it as
the outcome of professional jealousy.
Mr. DUNCAN had intended to address the
Bees on “The Proper Care and Feeding
of Larvae,” and was annoyed to find
that they preferred to listen to his
(Mr. Atropos') performance.
The Secretary of the Variety Artistes'
Federation informs us that Mr. Atropos
is not, and has never been, a member
of that Society.

THE CONTRACT.
“CoME, Peggy, put your toys away; you needn't shake your
head.
Your bear's been working overtime; he's panting for his
He's turned a thousand somersaults, and now his head must

It's cruelty to animals to keep the bear awake.”
At this she stamped in mutiny, and then she urged her plea,
Her wonted plea, “A little time, a minute more, for me.”
“Be off, you little rogue of rogues,” I sternly made reply;
“It's wicked to be sitting up with sand in either eye.
“To bed, to bed, you sleepy head; and then, and then—who
knows?—
Some day you'll be a grown-up girl, and lovely as a rose.
And some day some one else will come, a gallant youth and
gay,
To harry me and marry you and carry you away.”
At this the storm broke out afresh –“You know I hate the
boys;
They're only good at taking things, and breaking things,
and noise.
So, Daddy, please remember this, because—I—want—you-
to :—
I'll never marry any boy; I’ll only marry you.”

THE SHAKSPEARE HOUR.
The four rows of bright, intelligent faces looked up at
me with apparent interest. This, however, is apt to be
deceptive, as the British schoolboy has a marked genius for
assuming a concentrated attention to his work, while in
in agination he gets outside a huge dough-nut or scores a
brilliant goal amid loud cheers. So I asked Green major
to tell me the meaning of the word “paraphrase,” which I
had just explained with my customary lucidity. The absurd
art of paraphrasing is still cherished by examiners, so that
I am forced to allow my unfortunate young pupils to twist
and turn the beautiful lines of SHAKSPEARE into hideous prose.
This is the sort of thing that happens:—
“Now all the youth of lºngland are on fire,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies"
is transmuted into “Now all the young men in England are
quite excited, and have put away in the clothes-cupboard
the silk shirts that they were accustomed to lounge in.”
Green major thought deeply, then said, with a burst of
intelligence, that it meant turning Shakspeare into decent
English. I left paraphrasing and went on to something else.
We are reading SHARSPEARE's Henry V. together, more,
perhaps, on account of a future examination than because of
Mr. LEWIS WALLER's revival at the Lyric, but my young
pupils delight to hear about him, and about KEMBLE, and
MACREADY, and KEAN, and the other great actors who have
assumed “ the port of Mars” and cried (according to one
bright youth who was reciting the º “Once more
onto the beach, dear friends, once more.” Now, however,
being a little put out on account of the paraphrasing, I felt
that we ought to discuss something less pleasant to them.
So I turned to the subject of Prologues. “Another name
for Prologue,” I said, “is Chorus, which may stand either
for the man who delivers the Chorus or Prologue, or for the
Chorus or Prologue itself.” I felt sure that this very clear
statement could not fail to impress itself on the most stupid
boy, and therefore I considered myself at liberty to employ
the Comparative Method as recommended by the Board of
Education. (“Collocation of Subjects,” as the Board so
happily term it.) It was, besides, a suitable opportunity for
administering a little general culture. “The Chorus of the
ancient Greek Drama,” I remarked with that proprietary air
which superior knowledge is apt to impart, “differed con-
siderably from the Shakspearean Chorus. It consisted of a
large number of persons who remained in or about the
orchestra throughout the performance and at intervals passed
lyrical comments upon the action of the play.” And so I
warmed to my subject, and told them of the Chorus of
Tap6éval dºpopopot that I had seen in The Clouds of ARIS-
Topii ANEs a few years ago at Oxford, and I touched lightly on
Bradfield and the performance of Greek plays in general.
Then, with an undiminished flow of language, I explained
the uses of the Chorus in Henry V., how that its duty
there was to apologise for imperfections of apparatus and
scenery and for the inadequacy of the stage to represent with
any degree of verisimilitude the “vasty fieldſs of France,”
and also to stimulate the imaginations of the audience by

As the four rows still looked intelligent, I decided to
enjoy the fruits of my toil, and so I mopped my brow and
said, “All those who know anything about a Chorus will
put their hands up.”
About three hands were raised, among them one belonging
to Brown, a quiet little fellow who always sat in the extreme
corner of the room, on account of which peculiarity I had
named him, somewhat wittily, “Puer in angulo.” I nodded
at him, and he at once began: “Please, sir, I know a
chorus; it goes like this:—‘What is the use of loving a
girl, if she don't love you—’” “Stop!” I roared, for
I was indeed shocked by this unseemly and cryptic outburst
of vulgarity, and, turning hopefully to Green major, whose
hand was still waving in the air, I asked him what were
the duties of the Chorus in Henry V. “Please, sir,” he
replied, “to apologise for the play being written, and to get
people to go and fill up gaps between the Acts.”

A new light is thrown upon the question of Miss Violet
CHARLEsworth's age by The Birmingham Evening Despatch.
It would seem from the following passage that she is not so
old as some of us feared, though her extravagance may not
have been underrated:
“The box left at Snow Hill has been found to contain nothing but
stationery and all kinds of writing materials of an expensive kid.”

We are glad to see that the statement in The Church
Times (quoted in our last issue), to the effect that the present
year is "one of birthdays,” is not a piece of purely clerical
dogmatism. The Observer, whose attitude is secular in the
best sense, confirms this view. “This is the marvellous
year,” it says, “of anniversaries.”

[In spite of the decision of the authorities not to celebrate this interesting occasion the more spirited of the ordinary occupants of the
Museum are reported to have got up quite a nice little dance after closing hours. The Assyrian Court Band (Nimrod's Own) played delight-
fully throughout the evening. As an illustration of the good feeling and camaraderie prevailing between the different departments we may
mention that it was conducted most ably by the Discobolus, who threw himself into the performance with his accustomed vigour.]

FLIGHTS OF FANCY.
(A PEEP INTO THE FUTURE.)
October 2, 1909.--The Army Aeroplane
was brought out of its shed at Aldershot
to-day in splendid weather. The machine
travelled well along the ground for fully
100 yards. Colonel Cody was, as usual,
well satisfied with the results, but de-
cided, before attempting a flight, to re-
instate the radiators (which weigh about
100 lbs. each) in the position they occu-
pied in November, 1908.
January 14, 1910. —The Royal Engi-
neers (under the supervision of Colonel
Copy, the aviator) brought the Army
Airship out of its shed to-day and ran it
successfully round a portion of the golf
course. The radiators (which weigh
about 110 lbs. each) have been altered,
and the machine seemed to run very
smoothly. A cyclometer attached to one
of the wheels showed that the Aeroplane
had covered nearly 1,400 yards (mostly
uphill). Colonel Cody was naturally very
much pleased with the results of the
trial, but explained that, owing to the
frozen state of the ground, no attempt at
flight was possible.
tunately punctured on the home journey.
Norember 9, 1911.-The Army Aero-
plane underwent a further trial to-day
on Laffan's I’lain, the object being to
test the new tyre which was recently
fitted. The trial was satisfactory in
every way, and Colonel Cody is confident
that, should the new position of the
radiators (which weigh about 120 lbs.
each) prove satisfactory and the great
box-like wings act as he expects, there
is no reason why he should not remain
in the air for quite a quarter of an hour.
Two first-class Brazilian Aerocruisers
passed over the Plain at an altitude of
400 feet during the trial.

June 21, 1912.--Not since the summer
of 1908 has the Army Aeroplane had such
a successful trial. Spectators on Laffan's
Plain had a splendid view of the famous
machine as it came towards them flying,
without apparent effort, the Union Jack!
Colonel ('opy is now certain that he has
at last solved the problem—which has
puzzled him for some time—of return-
ing to terra firma after a flight. As a
result of further calculations the radiators
(which weigh nearly 130 lbs. each) have
been shifted forward to recover balance.
May 10, 1916.-The “Semper Eadem”
(as the British Army Aeroplane has been
christened) created a sensation to-day at
Aldershot. Hauled on to the golf course
by a detachment of Royal Engineers the
machine was given a brief rest in front
of the bunker guarding the seventh hole.
Colonel Cody then started the engine
and gave the order, “Let go!” The
Aeroplane leapt forward like a thing of
life and landed on the green in one.
There seems to be no doubt that it was
in the air for at least three seconds. (A
bystander with a stop-watch made it
four seconds.) Colonel Cody was natur-
ally jubilant, and, looking up at the
squadron of Bulgarian Aerodestroyers
which happened to be passing, expressed
the opinion that the “Semper lºadem”
had come to stay!

ROMANCE IN 190S.
Ali, the market statistics hitherto
published to illustrate last year's trade
having neglected the internal economics
of fiction, it is hoped that authors of
novels will study the following list of
fluctuations and regulate their output
for 1909 accordingly:-
Manufacture of Yarns.—Threadbare,
thrice-spun, and doubtful varieties have
showed no sign of diminution, but there
has been a great decrease in the weaving
of the original fabric. The employment
of local colour (foreign, colonial and pro-
vincial) for the purposes of this industry
has been enormous, Devon and Cornish
being in especial demand. American
spots have declined.
Characters. — Males opened silent
strong, but tended latterly to loquacious
epigrammatic. Heroines variable and
uncertain all the year. Self-realisation
and introspectiveness unchanged. Neu-
rotic tone well maintained.
Incidents.-The motor trade has given
an enormous stimulus to this industry.
Home railway accidents have hardened,
avalanches inclined to fall. Elopements
(all kinds) brisk; idylls scarcer.
I)idactic interludes.—A very heavy
turn-over.

PHILISTINES AMONG THE
PROPHETS.
I FORGET exactly how I got there, and
never in the world shall I understand
how Gwen got there. For the rest, they
were obviously artistic and literary folk.
When the men discuss their innermost
souls and the women approach all sub-
jects from a strictly logical point of view,
you may be sure that you are not dining
with people whose only passion in life is
mixed hockey. For myself, I have just
sufficient acquaintance with my soul to
belong to either party; but Gwen's
cheek was too delightfully rosy and
herself too sweetly fresh to belong to
anything but the Opposition.
We both, without conspiracy, acted at
first on the say-nothing-but-look-wise
policy, and as to our mouths it was
“Admission only on Business. No Exit.”
The others being qualified and willing
to do all the talking, we got along nicely
by merely putting in a “Yes” or “No”
now and then. Security, however, breeds
carelessness, and about the savoury I
said “Yes” at the wrong place and
much too loudly. I tried to save myself
from exposure by substituting a fit of
coughing for an explanation, but they
knew, and Gwen knew, and she, being
a woman, set about to desert me in my
distress and to glorify herself by fraud
and misrepresentation. -
Maeterlinck was the topic upon which
she did it. Careless of the fact that
Maeterlinck might be poet, puzzle-game,
Belgian general, hero of a decadent
novel or foreign competitor in the
Marathon race, she ventured to express
disapproval when all the others were
emphatic in praise. Her disapproval
was so vague that it might have applied.
to any of the above descriptions. “Of
course,” she said, “I speak with but
superficial knowledge. I have only just
begun to form a definite opinion. I am
only on the edge, as it were. But as
far as my study of the matter has gone
I am bound to confess that I have felt
a curious want, a sense of something
| lacking. It would be absurd to deny
the many obvious merits, but I do miss
that—what shall I say?—that je ne
sais quoi, that nameless', something,
which I certainly expected to find.”
“Ah,” said one of the, Genuine, “I too
was disappointed at first. But I changed
my opinion as I advanced in know-
ledge.”
“He might have told you,” I whis-
to Gwen, “what this Maeterhnck
is; ” but Gwen, affecting not to hear,
turned to the last speaker and begged
him to reveal his inward self upon the
oint.
After the ladies had gone, they gave
me a cigar and a match, and told me, as
clearly as they could without putting it
into words, that I should hear from them
again when they wanted me. Then
they gathered together and discussed
the pictures at the Exhibition. “Was
it not,” was the last word, “the most
delightful collection of modern times,
as far, at any rate, as the British Section
was concerned ?” When they thought
it was nearly time to join the ladies, one
of them asked me what sort of a year it
had been for the crops. I awoke with a
start and was just warming up to the
subject, when a movement was made, and
we were in the drawing-room before I
had even done with the hay.
We found the ladies discussing TURNER
and Impressionism, and there was Gwen
sitting right in the middle of the sofa
and saying, “Oh, do you think so?”
with such self-possession that they were
all deceived and myself left boiling.
“Shall hypocrisy and deceit so pre-
vail?” I thought, and forced myself to
her side. * -- -
“Did you,” I said, “go to the Exhi-
bition ?” “I believe I did,” she
answered without enthusiasm, and
looked as if this awful man was going
to talk to her about the Flip-Flap.
“And did you,” I said, “find anything
there to please you?” No, she thought
she had not. “Not even the pictures?”
I pursued relentlessly. Then she fell.
“No,” she said with a tolerant smile,
“the Oleograph and the Christmas
Number Presentation Plate are all very
well for the people, but I confess they
leave me chilled to the bone.” “In-
deed,” I said, and turned to include in
the conversation the George Eliot at the
other end of the sofa. “I am trying to
persuade Miss Harmer that the pictures
at the Exhibition were the most delight-
ful collection of modern times, as far,
at any rate, as the British Section was
concerned.”. G. E. forgave my past
and came up to the scratch like the
good sportsman she was. “Why, of
course !” she cried. “Surely you liked
that? Think of the exquisite—”
And while she poured panegyric into
Gwen's right ear I kept on whispering
“Oleograph” and “Christmas Number
Presentation Plate" into the other ear.
Gwen's punishment was just about as
bitter as it could be, and it would have
been longer, only she made such a half-
hearted show of fight. . .
Presently I got her into a corner by
herself. “Were there any pictures at
the Exhibition ?” she asked. “And
if so, where?” “I do not know,” I
answered candidly; “I never saw any.”
“Then,” she said, “you are a deceitful
wretch, and I hate you.” “And justly,”
I admitted ; “but I shall not leave you
until you tell me what Maeterlinck is.”
With that she gave in completely.
“I believe,” she said with an irresistible
smile, “that it is a place on the Con-
'tinent where one takes the waters.
What is your handicap at golf?” "

hole, but right out of bounds. The
Court demurred but finally granted my
petition, and I was, with the other ten

and, if they've got good golf there, we’ll
spend our honeymoon at Maeterlinck.”

THE PRAYER-MAT.
THE rug arrived—a wondrous thing;
Its blended colours seemed to bring
The glamour of an Eastern Spring
To cheer a London Christmas;
One almost sees some pious Khan
Kneel on it by his caravan, -
East somewhere, say, near Teheran,
When Suez was an isthmus!
I note your rather flattering thought—
That since its web and weft were wrought
Where HAFiz sang and RUSTUM fought
My hand might try to harp it:
To this I’d say my modest Muse
Would very certainly refuse
To harp–or even wear her shoes—
On such a magic carpet!
It tells of far-off city gates -
Where swarthy traders fill the crates
With sun-dried store of figs and dates
. For juvenile excesses;
I see the Persian roses bloom,
I sniff the camel's chaste perfume,
And hear the tuneful bulbul boom
In flowery wildernesses |
It paints for me the shiny East,
Mysterious, pagan, unpoliced,
Where Muezzins call to Fast or Feast,
Where minaret and dome are; ,
And when its conjured visions tire
And vanish in the sinking fire
They leave behind an old desire— t
An echo from your QMAR.
I want you, then, O friend of mine,
To come to-morrow night and dine;
You'll find the fitting flask of wine,
The necessary verses -
(No, not my own (), a loaf of bread,
Or else a brace of birds instead,
"Twill need no “Thou” to crown the
spread -
If you will share these mercies!

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Me and Girlie hope
you are quite well. We are quite well.
Mamma is well. Papa is well. Willie,
the parrot, is well, but not quite so well
as Mamma and Papa.
Please, Mister Punch, why don't you
start a “Corner for the Children’’ in ||
your old paper ? Me and Girlie wrote
the following lines between us; me all
the first and second lines, and Girlie all
the others. I think of things to say
about things, and Girlie thinks of more
things to say about the same things
which will rhyme with the things I
have just said. Here it is:—
A POEM.
A little robin sat one day
Upon a little tree.
You could not see its little ears,
They were not there to see.
His breast was striped with ruddy red,
His little eyes were blue.
He wept with plaintive note because
His rent was overdue.
The landlord came that sunny morn;
He saw a dreadful frown
On Mrs. Robin's face, who was
Arrayed in gorgeous gown.
But the landlord did not want the rent,
And the robins in their glee
First hopped around upon the ground,
And then flew up the tree.
We can do this sort of thing for you
every week for next to nothing. You
might call it “Chit-chat for the Chicks,”
or what not. I am thirty-two next
birthday; Girlie is nearly forty. Girlie
has been a law reporter, a sub-editor of
“Scientific Mems,” colitor of a sort of
weekly notes for priggish young men
called “Shoulders to the Wheel !” and
a sporting prophet. Now he sticks to
the juvenile, and sometimes he is Girlie,
sometimes Auntie Sue. He likes being
Girlie best, but doesn't mind being both.
He says perhaps you wouldn't mind
him writing little tales about faithful

[JANUARY 20, 1909.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SCEPTICs who, in spite of Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING's pronounce-
ments, are still unwilling to admit the existence of a definite
boundary between East and West, should read The Prince of
Dreamcrs (HEINEMANN), where FLORA ANNIE STEEL has painted
the pageant of the Court of Jalāl ud din Mahomed Akbar, a
contemporary of QUEEN ELIZABETH. The clash of incon-
gruous ideals is here effectively illustrated. Albar himself
was a bit of a Socialist in his way, and mingled a taste
for advanced political theories with a very thorough-
going Oriental mysticism. The plot turns on the adventures
of a diamond, which was delivered to William Leedes,
jeweller, of England, to cut, and passed to and fro (together
with a pair of paste understudies) amongst the members of
that Sir William had not only made his fortune from the
Gilt Electric Pill (“With a i. in the waistcoat pocket
drowning is the only death") but had also spent nearly all
of it, their self-esteem received a rude buffet. At first they
were maddened by the attentions of Mr. Dennison, an old
friend and fellow pill-maker of Sir William's, who offered
them charity; but the sons quickly understood that it was
a question of Pill-money or Poverty, and accepted everything
at a gulp. But Diana S.–G., possessing a fine distaste for
anything connected with pills, refused Mr. Dennison's offers
of assistance, and we leave her clinging to her ideals. A
hazardous position for an ºrienced and impoverished
maiden, but she has my approval.
Miss MARY CHOLMONDELEY must have hugely enjoyed writing
the Preface to The Lowest Rung (MURRAY), in which she
pillories the noodles who have persecuted her by seeing
in themselves or their
the royal harem and
other intriguers with
such celerity that, if I
had been asked at any
moment, “Under which
thimble is the King's
Luck now?” I should
have got it wrong every
time. Notable figures
in the conspiracy are
Atma Deri, the Charan,
holder of the King's
honour, and single-
minded in her devotion
to him, and Siyah
Yamin, her sister of the
Veil, a lady who was
not by any means so
good. There is also
Khodadad, a Prince of
the Tārkhāns, and any-
one who does not yet
know how a Tārkhān is
tried by his peers and
punished should make
all haste to find out.
But in the dazzling riot
of Eastern colour which
the authoress knows so
well how to produce I
must take exception to
her habit of allowing
characters to drop into –
colloquial English, and even make puns in that compara-
tively vulgar language. Nor can I feel that Auntie Rosebody
is a sufficiently dignified paraphrase of Gulbadan Begum.
When I am in the East, among Rājpâts, I like to remain
mystified all the time, and the more arrow-marks there are
over the tops of the letters the better I am pleased.
If somebody offered a prize to the author who should
invent the greatest number of laughable situations in a fixed
time and Mr. STORER CLotSTON competed for it, I think that
he should win with something to spare. His situations might
not be the funniest, but they would be funny enough. I
can imagine a hearty man reading A County Family
(MURRAY) in a railway carriage and making the journey
intolerable to his fellow-travellers, for the book is food for
those who like to laugh roaringly rather than to smile.
Success, after some generations of adversity, had returned to
the Seaton-Glastonburys, and when Sir William S.–G. died
there were no haughtier people upon earth than his daughter
and two sons. When, however, these proudlings found

[To an old friend, these reflections of middle-age on the making of
forests for the benefit of posterity.]
Ah! how often you and I, my Gerald,
Taking count of Time's appalling pace,
Watching those insidious signs that herald
Chronic apathy of form and face;
Noting how our legs are not so lissome
Nor our waists so waspish as of old,
And the joys of youth how much we miss 'em,
Vanished like the Age of Gold –
When, amid a younger race that hustles
We are hampered by rheumatic pains,
Or remark a looseness in our muscles
And a touch of torpor in our brains;–
We have sucked a coward's consolation
From the thought that, when the final blow
Falls, as threatened, on the British nation,
We shall not be there to know.
“If,” we say, “for but a few more lustres
She can still contrive to rule the wave,
Still to ‘worry through' against the thrusters
Who design for her a watery grave,
We shall see no Teuton missiles raining
On our disillusioned flank and rear,
While the Territorials go in training
Just too late by half a year.”
Other little things at present dim in
Shadows where the Future plies its loom—
Government by Socialists and Women,
With the Second Chamber blown to Doom—
When we contemplate these fearsome bogies
Hovering in the distance, “Ha!" we say,
“Not in our time; not for us old fogies;
We shall then have had our day.”
Yet a boon there is I fain would borrow
From the far years where it lies in store:
When the saplings which we plant to-morrow
Spread their shade about the forest floor,
When, with lattice-work of leaves above her,
And the song of birds in woodland air,
Every lass goes Maying with her lover,
I could wish we might be there.
But, when back again from out waste places
Merrie England plucks her childhood's hours,
Not for us will they, the linked Graces,
Lead their pageantry in Summer bowers;
Not for us the flame of Autumn's dying,
Nor the loveliness of Spring's new birth;
You and I, my friend, will then be lying
Very quiet under earth.

NOTES ON THE ANTI-MOTOR SHOW OF 1909.
THE promoters of the Anti-Motor Exhibition are to be
congratulated upon the success of their efforts. They have
brought together the finest collection of anti-motor devices
and appliances which has yet been seen under one roof, and
the popularity of the show is assured.
The more important of the exhibits, of course, are those
of a protective nature, and here we would specially commend
the “Spiky Turtleback,” an ingenious contrivance which
enables the pedestrian to walk along country roads in serene
indifference. Briefly, the arrangement in question resembles
a huge steel dish-cover, studded on the outside with twelve-
inch spikes. It is attached to the wearer's back by means
of springs and straps, and affords perfect protection against
the heaviest and fastest of cars. Armed with one of these
outfits, the pedestrian, when taken unawares, simply flings
himself down on the road, and retires, literally speaking,
within his shell, cheered by the pleasing reflection that if
anyone is hurt it will be somebody else.
Another admirable invention, specially designed for excep-
tionally virulent anti-motorists, is the “Vesuvian Jacket.”
Made of gun-cotton, with detonators as buttons, this useful
garment will effectually dispose of the car which happens to
run over its wearer. Incidentally, it would, of course, dispose
of the wearer as well, but, as the old adage has it, it is
impossible to make omelettes without breaking eggs.
Besides, the “Jacket” is really intended more as a safe-
guard than as a blower-up of inconsiderate triflers. Its
colour scheme, red and yellow stripes, serves as a danger
signal, and it is fairly safe to assume that even the most
vicious road-hog with such a warning before his eyes would
risk ripping his tyres off rather than run into it.
For nervous anti-motorists, who prefer to be passive rather
than active resisters, we can highly recommend the “Aerial"
outfit, shown by the Pedestrians' Protection Society. This
useful arrangement consists of a small balloon which is
attached to the pedestrian's shoulder by means of light steel
chains and a pair of heavy leaden weights. Upon the
approach of a too strenuous car the act of touching a spring
releases the weights. They fall to the ground, and up goes
their proprietor, to descend again when the danger is past.
The apparatus is made in four sizes: “Chestertons,” “Heavy-
weights,” “Light-weights,” and “Barries.”
At the stall of the Anti-Motorists' Supply Association, Ltd.,
there is displayed a most useful and up-to-date “Pedestrian's
Repair Outfit.” It comprises one wooden leg, one artificial
arm, ten yards of sticking-plaster, one quart bottle of arnica,
and a stretcher. No pedestrian should venture abroad now.
adays without having at least one of these outfits about him.
Whilst glancing over the exhibits at the Association's stall,
by the way, we noticed a new and revised edition of that
inyaluable work, The Anti-Motorist's Book of Phrases. Com-
piled with the assistance of a Naval officer, a retired Anglo-
Indian colonel, and a Suffragette, this handy little volume
gives, in parallel columns, a list of expressions suitable for
anti-motorists under all possible conditions. Every purchaser
of a copy is presented with a small megaphone, in order
that he, or she, may be able to make his, or her, remarks
heard by the occupants of the car which has rendered them
necessary.

SIDELIGHTS ON THE “SHOWER.”
MR. Philip Gibbs, writing in The Daily
Chronicle of the 21st inst., devotes an
exhaustive article to the portraiture of the
“Shover" as a new type of humanity
and romance. He is “a very god, or
devil, of noise; ” at once hero and valet;
and enjoying peculiar facilities for eaves-
dropping. “The owner of a thousand
guinea car is at the mercy of the man to
whom he pays thirty shillings a week,
for knowledge is still power, and the
chauffeur not only knows everything
about the inside of his master's machine,
but sometimes a good deal about the
inside of his master's life.” If Mr.
PHILIP Gibbs’s mordant characterisation
of this new type of humanity be correct,
the “shover" is a reserved, rather silent,
sinister man with a hard mouth, keen,
restless eyes and a sallow complexion.
We have been at pains to verify this
view by consulting a number of repre-
sentative men and women, and are now
able to lay before our readers the results
of our investigations.
Miss Elsie CRAVEN, interviewed at His
|Majesty's Theatre, was most indignant
with Mr. Gibbs for his unsympathetic
portrait. “My ‘shover,’” she said,
“has a lovely complexion. I call him
‘Mr. Pinkie.' I hold him, in fact, in the
deepest affection, he is so deft and
‘dinky.’”
The PoET LAUREATE expressed the view
that Mr. Gibbs’s portrait was untrue.
His ‘shover’ was the kindliest of men,
and in three years had never killed a
hen. His eyes were gentle and his hair
was sleek, the ruddy glow of health
adorned his cheek. In short he stig-
matised as full of fibs the article of Mr.
PHILIP GiBBs.
Mr. Gibbs's assertion that the “shover,”
although a servant, “treats all the other
servants with haughty insolence” is
deeply resented in many of the most
recherchés servants'-halls. Thus Miss
CAROLINE DELORME, head lady's-maid to the
Countess of N , remarks: “Ensconced
behind his glassy cover, as dapper as a
golden plover, our “shover' is a perfect
lover.”
Mr. BERNARD SHAw takes acute excep-
tion to Mr. GIBBS's invidious comparisons
between cabmen and chauffeurs. The
former, according to Mr. Gibbs, speak
“the kindly language of the stable,
Elizabethan, even Chaucerian, in its
candour and realism and picturesque
imagery,” while the “shover,” when
among his fellows, uses a strange tech-
nical jargon which cannot be understood
by the multitude. Says Mr. SHAw: “A
man who talks Elizabethan is little better
than a heathen, and even clumsier and
coarser is he who frames his speech on
CHAUCER. Chauffeurs are made of finer
clay (see 'Emery Straker in my play, who
was, you will recall, aw fait with writers
such as BEAUMARCHAIs), and only minds
effete and flabby deplore the passing of
the cabby.”
Lastly, Sir OLIVER LODGE expresses his
views on the subject in the following
interesting psychological conundrum —
“If the ‘shover,’ according to Gibbs,
though earning inadequate ‘dibs,’ is a
hero and valet combined, the problem
that puzzles my mind is whether, when
facing a cold down to zero, the valety
half thinks the other a hero?”

THE PANTOMIMIC TOUCH.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Having lately
returned from a round of provincial and
suburban theatres, I feel it is my duty
as your deputy-sub-assistant dramatic
critic to tell you what I saw there.
[Do.—EDITOR.] It is at best only a
bird's-eye view of the proceedings that
I can put before you, but it is the view
of a bird which has just seen six different
pantomimes in a week, and has retained
in its mind only a confused impression
of those episodes which were common to
all of them. I shall call the piece
Aladdin; the title is really of no
account, but it is useful for purposes of
reference, copyright, libel, etc.

EDITOR. Ah, I've done it that way my-
self.]
S. L. C. walks across the stage in
what he calls his “disables” (loud
laughter), and then turns his back to
the audience to show that he has some
garment on the wrong way round. He
retires amidst frantic applause.
L. C. (confidentially to the audience).
Do you know my friend Brarn ? What,
not know Brarn ? Ah, I should like you
to know Brarn—'e's a good chap,
Brarn. I must tell you a funny story
about 'im. You will laugh. (Chokes
with laughter himself.) Well, Brarn—tee-
hee-hee-hee-hee—Brarn (recovering him-
self with an effort) was 'aving breakfast
with a lord—just 'aving a bit of break-
fast, you know, same as you or me; and
this lord–tee-hee-hee-hee-hee, Brarn and
a lord 1–well, he said to Brarn, “I trust
that—haw—egg—haw—is a good one—
haw—Mr. Brown; ” and Brarn, very
nervous, you know, looked up and said,
“P-parts, my lord, are excellent.”
(Shrieks of laughter.)
[EDITOR. That story is old.
CRITIC. I fancy it must be.]
Aladdin, the principal boy, comes on,
amid friendly cheers from an audience
which is always glad to see a real lady
again.
Aladdin. And now to find the lamp,
and then to marry my own dear Madge!
Ah, I wonder if she still loves me!
Song—“Madge.”
[EDITOR. Did Aladdin marry a Madge?
I had forgotten.
CRITIC. He called her Madge.]
Madge, Madge,
I've come to cadge, cadge,
I want your heart, I do.
Say, say,
You love me, May, May–
[Short for Madge.—EDITOR.
Oh, say that your heart is true.]
At the fifth encore, which consists of
three claps from an enthusiast in a box,
who has mislaid the chocolates he meant
to give her, she returns with the fire-
man's little child, who sings the chorus,
very flat. Deafening cheers, and a sort of
feeling that she is a good girl after all.
Pit and Pat, the two ambassadors,
come on. Pit, without obviously having
been insulted, knocks Pat down.
Pat (getting up). You do that again
and you'll repeat it. (Correcting himself.)
Repent it. -
Pit. Oh, I'll repent it, will I?
Pat. Yes, you'll repent it.
Pit. Oh, I will?
Pat. Yes, you will.
They sit down and play the mandolin
together very cheerfully.
SCENE 5.
[EDITOR. You're not going to give us
all the scenes 2
CRITIC. This is a very short one, just
to keep the audience excited while the
scene-shifters are busy.]
Enter the Spirit of Evil. He an-
nounces in a very loud singing voice
that his wicked plots are going well.
He is followed by the Good Fairy, who
says that, on the contrary . .
ScENE 6.
Madge. Ah, I wonder if Aladdin will
be true to me, or if he will leave me as
Antonio left his little girl!
Song—“Antonio.”
[EDITOR. Good, I can hum this.
CRITIC. I've heard it twenty-four
times. So can I.]
The Still Lower Comedian comes in
with the Cat.
The Cat. Meadw.
S. L. C. No, you can't go out to-
night. You went out last Thursday.
Yes, and came in with the milk, too.
And you the father of a family.
[EDITOR. Is there a cat in “Aladdin"?
CRITIC. Don't be silly; how could they
get that joke in if there wasn't 2]
All the artistes come on to the stage.
When the manager gives the signal that
ererybody is on, the curtain comes down.
Act II.-SCENE 2.
[Epiton. IHallo!
CRITIC. Sorry, I simply had to have a
cigarette.]
Madge. Ah, I wonder if Aladdin will
be true to me, or if he will leave me as
Antonio left his little girl!
[Editor. You ass; we've had this.
CRITIC. I'm sorry. A slight mistake.]
Madge. Ah, I wonder if Aladdin will
be true to me, or if he will leave me as
Antonio left Sue.
Song—“Sue.”
Pit and Pat come on. Pit, an
ambassador of uncertain temper, knocks
Pat down.
Pat. Don't you touch me.
I’it. I shall touch you if I want to.
Pat. Yes, but I don't want you to.
Pit. Oh, you don't 2
Pat. No, I don't.
Pit. You don't.
They sit down and juggle with extra-
ordinary dexterity. The Low Comedian
follows them.
L. C. Oh, such a funny thing has
happened. You will laugh when I tell
you. Tee-hee-hee-hee. You know our
old man ; well–tee hee-hee-hee-hee—it
was so funny——

[JANUARy 27, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VOYAGE of DISCOVERY.
HE did not grudge the pretty penny stamp.
Upon the note whereby he guaranteed
To go and dance with Them of Leamington ;
He did not rue the very vast expense
Of cabs and fares and cabs and tips and cabs;
He did not shun the labour and the shame
Of vain endeavour and absurd result
That dancing meant to him, who much preferred
His bed to all the ballrooms in the world;
All these he counted worth the bearing for
The bright and witty talk between the turns.
From May he learnt that she had met his sister
And thought she was a very charming girl
And liked the man to whom she was engaged :
That she had also met his other sister
And thought she was a very charming girl
And liked the man to whom she was engaged :
Had even met his brothers once or twice
And thought that they were very charming men
And liked the girls who were engaged to them.
Had there been time she was prepared to like
(He saw it coming) even his heart's choice
But for the fact that it was not yet made.
Grace, hearing that he came from London, thought
That London was a most delightful place,
And spoke at length from inner knowledge of
The Larger London, which, it seemed, consists
Of Euston (Station and Hotel), The Park,
And Daly's and a taxicab or two.
Kate loved “The Merry Widow,” hated hockey:
Jane loathed “The Merry Widow,” loved her hockey:
Joyce cared for neither; Amy liked them both.
(To think that but for this eventful night
He might have lived his unenlightened life
In gross mistake or darkest ignorance
Of all that does most nearly touch the soul!)
Gladys had been to Brussels (he had not);
She had not been to Amsterdam (he had);
But neither of them ever went to Rome,
Yet both knew Liverpool extremely well.
She knew the Shaws and he the Robinsons,
Who both most oddly lived at Liverpool.
Connie had been to seven dances, Nell
To nine, and Violet to seventeen
(Of which six, being for infants, did not count).
At supper Phyllis said, and only said,
But said it very often :-" Thank you, no.”
And Doris, last and best, agreed with him
That gas was nicer than electric light,
That candles gave a nicer light than gas,
That home, sweet home was wholly lit by gas,
~~A nicer light than was electric light,
But, on the other hand, less nice than candles,
That it was time they had another dance,
That candle-light was not as nice as gas,
Nor gas as nice . . . . Ah! there's the band again.
Thus on the morrow he returned to Town
With mind refreshed by interesting facts
And subtle jests and wonderful ideas.

the prime of life are dumb.”—Daily Mail.

IN THE CONFEDERATE CHAMBER.
“BUT are you quite sure 35
I was going to ask if it was quite safe for me to proceed
any further on my desperate mission, but my companion
interrupted me.
“Hush,” he whispered, “don’t talk so loud or you might
be discovered. Of course the mask and the black cloak
make you look just like one of us, and I know you agree
with us heart and soul—everybody does—but it's best not
to raise your voice. They're all the kindest creatures in
the world unless you contradict them or argue with them,
and then they carry on like mad things. Even (he
mentioned the name of a great statesman from Worcestershire)
“ is a regular LEO when he's roused. Ha, ha! You see it,
don't you ? So please be very careful about arguing in here.
Besides it wouldn't be any good. They lured poor CHIOzzA
MoxEY in here yesterday; told him it was to be a fair and
square debate, and he was to be allowed to talk for an hour.
Of course he never had a chance. They gagged him and
bound him and sat him in that chair and read Tariff Reform
pamphlets to him for a couple of hours. Plucky little chap,
you know, is Chiozz \; but, Lord bless you, it wasn't a bit
of good. He might just as well have taken it quietly. Any-
how, he won't want to come back. No, he didn't faint—
just had a couple of apoplectic fits, and then they let him go.”
At this moment I heard a series of blood-curdling yells
from a dim corner of the chamber. “Good heavens ! ” I
said under my breath. “What's that ?” “Oh,” said my
friend, “that's one of the worst cases we've ever had to
deal with. He comes from Norwood—name of Bowl.Es.
They're giving him the torture of the sixth question, feeding
him on Australian wool soaked in Australian Burgundy to
try and make him say ‘Preference,’ but he's an obstinate
beggar. They'll have to get the Retaliation wedges into his
legs if they mean to shake him. Listen.”
A solemn voice was now heard in a sort of chant:-
“Prisoner,” it intoned, “the Confederacy is strong, but it
is generous. If you will now say ‘Pref., only one syllable,
we shall be satisfied.”
“Never,” said a voice in the feeble but dauntless tones in
which I had some difficulty in recognizing the accents which
have so often delighted the House of Commons. “Never.
You may proceed with your work.”
“Torturer,” sang the solemn voice, “give him a pound
of wool and—yes, that will be the quickest way—strap him
to a Norwegian window-frame and put a pipe of British
tobacco in his mouth.”
There was a slight struggle, but the terrible masked
figures soon prevailed, and my poor friend had to go through
the dreadful ordeal. His cheerfulness was seemingly un-
impaired by his sufferings, and he cast many a proud Free
Trade glance at his relentless persecutors. “It’s a pity,”
said my guide, “a great pity. He'll have to toe the line in
the end, you know. They've all had to. Look at BALFot R.
He stood out quite a long time, but when we put the
Birmingham screw on him he caved in. He's often with us
now. By the way he's to preside over his cousin's examina-
tion to-morrow. Cousin Robert's not an easy man—far from
it—but we've got everything ready for him, racks, wedges,
red-hot pokers, shirt of English-made tin-tacks, and broken
glass for his feet. My dear chap, it'll be a regular beano,
I've got a spare ticket for the show. Won't you come?”
But I had seen enough, and with a few hasty words of
thanks to my amiable conductor I hurried from the chamber,

THE SINS OF THE FATHERS.
[After describing a paper read before the
Eugenics Education Society, presenting statis-
tics of themarriages of first cousins, The Journal
of Education says: “Teachers should bear in
mind that the abnormal stupidity of Smith
minor may be due to Smith père's ignorance of
Eugenics."]
O DREADFUL Doctor, cease to frown
And fling your cane away!
Turn, turn your ruffled shirt-sleeves
down |
Birch not the brat to-day !
Ah, strike not while your blood is hot,
But pause, I do beseech you,
And, while you may, consider what
Eugenics have to teach you.
A puny boy that scarce can stand,
His knees are trembling so,
Watches the weapon in your hand
In terror-stricken woe.
Ah, Doctor, pause while there is time
And let the babe be pitied
What is the unpardonable crime
Smith minor has committed ?
He is, no doubt, a dreadful dunce—
But what could you expect?
Kind Doctor, spare the rod for once,
And, if you please, reflect.
He scarce deserves so grim a fate
For being stupid. Rather
Your vengeſul rod should castigate
Smith minor's guilty father.
lèight well do you deserve the tawse,
For black your crime, Smith père!
You flouted all eugenic laws
In marrying Smith mºre.
Eugenic maids around you grew;
You might have had a dozen,
And yet you needs must go and woo,
O fool, a full first cousin.
But let us not be hard. Perchance,
Smith père, upon the whole
Your crime was rather ignorance
Than villainy of soul.
In your young days no forms were filed
By learned statisticians
To show the world what sort of child
Results from what conditions.
But those dark times are swept aside.
Smith minor, when he warms
With Love's young dream, will be sup-
plied
With blank eugenic forms;
And when he comes to take his place
At dinners and at dances,
He'll hand a form with courtly grace
To any girl he fancies.
And when the forms have all been
checked,
And each assigned due weight,
Smith minor will with care select
The most eugenic mate.
Then, Doctor, spare, as kindness bids !
If little Smith is stupid,
He may beget eugenic kids
Without regard to Cupid.

THE TARIFF REFORM SKATING-RINK.
MINISTERS AS SCHOOLBOYS.
The remarkable reminiscences con-
tributed to The Daily Mail by a school-
fellow of Mr. HALDANE, describing the
WAR MINISTER as a boy of a substantial
figure and wearing knickerbockers with
red stockings, have brought us a
number of supplementary recollections
of Mr. HALDANE's colleagues. From
these we select the following as perhaps
most vividly palpitant with momentous
actuality.
Mr. Asquith AND THE CABBAGE LEAF.
SIR,-Though nearly forty-four years
have elapsed since “we twa . . . paidled
in the burn" together, or, perhaps, I
should say, “thegither,” I still pre-
serve a distinct recollection of the
PRIME MINISTER at school. Even then
he had a robust figure, and generally
wore check trousers and side-spring
boots. -
Few people nowadays associate Mr.
Asquirii with cricket, but as a matter of
fact he was a very useful “curly" lob
bowler, while the imperturbable serenity
of his countenance had a disconcerting
effect on those who bowled at him. I
remember that when he played cricket
he always wore boots in preference to
shoes, and sported a blue belt which
set off his figure admirably. He was, I
may add, the first boy in the second
eleven at the City of London School
who ever wore a cabbage leaf in his
cap to guard against sunstroke. When
this was brought to the notice of Dr.
ABBOTT, he at once observed “Mark my
word, that boy's brains are worth pro-
tecting, and he knows it.” EzRA JoPE.
Great Gable, Tulse Hill.
MR BIRRELL's PETs.
SIR,--It was my good fortune to
spend a year in the middle sixties at
the same school with Mr. BiºFELL, whose
taste in dress remains vividly impressed
on my memory. Sturdy and thick-set
in figure he affected the peg-top trousers
then in vogue, and on Sundays generally
wore a blue swallow-tail coat with brass
buttons, a maroon plush waistcoat and a
beaver hat, the tout ensemble being
stylish in the extreme.
| Admirers of Mr. BIRRELL will not
easily associate him with sport, but in
those days he was a crack shot with a
saloon pistol and kept several guinea-
pigs as well as silk-worms, the latter
doubtless foreshadowing his distinction
at the Bar. PHILAUGUSTINE.
Amersham, Bucks.
MR. LLOYD-GEORGE As ATHLETE.
SIR,--It was my privilege some thirty
years ago to be a class-mate of the
CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchequER at Llanys-
tymdwy School. He was then, as now,
slim and spare of figure, and wore sage
green pantaloons with sand-shoes.
Few persons would believe that Mr.
LLOYD-GEORGE was, as a boy, a dashing
three-quarter back I shall never forget
a wonderful run that he once made,
turning and twisting like a humanised
eel as he dodged all his opponents—
some of them men of colossal stature—
and finally landed the ball behind the
goal-posts. A whole holiday is still
granted to the school on the anniversary
of this marvellous exploit, which has
been the subject of countless pennillions

CoMPETITION For the DESIGN of the GREAT PYRAMid. The JUDGES discussiNG THE RELATIVE MERITs of the Competitors' work.
I have never seen him in Parliament,
but his attitude in class when answering
a question was extraordinarily impres-
sive. With hand uplifted and head
erect, and eyes turned back as if delving
into the inmost depths of his subliminal
self, he would chant his answer in a
rich fruity tremolo that hypnotized the
master, and invariably secured for him
the maximum marks. I can still repeat
some of his impromptu poems, which
elicited from the headmaster the witty
remark that, if he had lived in the reign
of AUGUSTUS, he and not VIRGIL would
have written the Georgics.

Criccieth, N. Wales.
A NEUTRAL-TINTED TYPE.
SIR,--I have only a vague recollection
of the present Foreign MINISTER at his
and my private school, and, like many of
his school contemporaries, often wonder
that he should ever have risen to
eminence. Unobtrusive in dress and
manners, he never said or did anything
furnishing materials for good “copy.”
He was actually fonder of fishing than
cricket, and, in general, entirely failed
to model his life on the great principles
enunciated by Mr. PETER KEARY in his
splendid manuals of efficiency. These
reminiscences will, I think, explain why
it is that the Foreign SECRETARY cuts
such a meagre and unimpressive figure
in the personal columns of our en-
lightened democratic press.
Balham. AIREY EELES.
WALKS IN LIFE.
The Roller-skate Walk, introduced by
Mrs. NICHOLAS LoNGworTH and Miss ETHEL
ROOSEVELT (says the Washington corre-
spondent of The Evening Standard),
promises to outshine the Gibson Walk
in popularity. It is a cross between the
military tread of the chorus girl in
comic opera and the glide of the
premier toe dancer. The ball of the
foot is planted first, the legs are kept
straight, the body erect on the hips, and
as far as possible the walker glides.
This looks a little complicated, but is
nothing to some other modes of pro-
gression we have lately heard of. For
instance, the Bangor Flit is a com-
promise between a motor-car spill and
“shooting the moon.” After giving
one wild look, the ſlitter glissades as
fast as possible to the nearest railway
station, and, before knowing where or
who she is, is found, say, at Oban.
The Aldershot Scoot is a combination
of “ducks and drakes” and an earth-
quake. For the first half-second it is
all plane sailing, and then something
gives way and you come violently to
mother earth. After a month of repairs,
you begin again and repeat the evolu-
tion, covering quite a lot of ground—
with débris. It amuses foreigners.
The Banana Slide tempers the delights
of the trottoir roulant with the abruptness
of a bomb explosion. It can be prac-
tised anywhere where there is a pave-
ment and a crowd of appreciative small
boys, and is largely affected by elderly
foot passengers.
The Ski-who-must-be-obeyed Shuffle
unites the gait of a dancing bear with
the struggles of an inverted cockroach,
when the effort to compass a Telemark
Turn lands the performer in a snow-
drift.
The motto which appears at the head
of the menu at a Folkestone hotel is
Semper Idem. This is translated by the
guests as “Mutton Again.”
Charity to Man and Beast.
The successor to the late Raja
Goku LDAs has, according to The Pioneer
Mail, announced that he has “remitted
the debts of his tenants to the extents of
one lakhs of rupees,” and “presented a
set of Encyclopædia Britannica to the
library of the station of a village for
feeding stray cows and other cattle in
that station,”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WHOLE ART OF SHOOTING:
BEING some OBSERVATIONS OF A
DEAD SHOT.
[“De mortuis nil misi bonum."]
OPINIONs differ as to the principal
reason which should determine every
young Briton to become a good shot.
Some will tell him that he may at any
time be called upon to defend his hearth
(unless he uses gas-stoves) from the
foreign invader.
Others will tell him of the glories of
Sport for Sport's Sake. And here his
aunts will remind him of the miseries
of Pneumonia for Wet Feet's Sake.
Yet others will tell him of the delight
of sending a friend a brace of peewits,
tapirs or wombats.
Still others, who have shot themselves
sick in their downy days, will tell him
that the costume alone justifies the
thing.
After some study of the various
allurements, one can but think that
there is something in the dictum of
this last class—something almost true
in what they say.
The kit's the thing. Although a
considerable amount of shooting may
be done in the Home Counties, begin-
ning in quite mild seasons of the year,
don't let this fact weigh for anything
when you are getting your outfit. Get
something heavy enough for the rigours
of the Arctic Circle.
A shooting-coat is called so because it
is a thing you wear for potting, or
bedding-out, or an odd day's window-
glazing (just as riding-breeches get
their name from being used for pro-
menades on the Marine Parade).
It should be built of Harris, Donegal
or Hampstead tweed, lined with walrus-
hide, faced with corrugated-iron, and
trimmed with virgin cork. Refuse all
substitutes for the last material; it
floats.
According to your tailor, the shoot-
ing-coat, “what is a shooting-coat.”
must have plenty of pockets. A fair
allowance is fourteen, though Mr. F. C.
SELous, one of the biggest big-game
men, specifies fifteen in his books.
The idea of having so many pockets
would appear to be as follows: One can
put all the impedimenta of every-day
use—mail-nippers, pipe, pouch, cigarette-
case, match-box, keys, office dittoes,
time-table, card-case, pencil, fountain
pen, eraser, note-book, to mention those
that occur most readily to mind—into
the pockets of one's shooting-coat. Put
each in one pocket. Have a place for
every individual thing, and keep every-
thing in its place. Then, just as a bird,
beast or fish comes down wind, or up
wind, or in any direction relative to the
wind, affording one a shot, one can say,

“Tut tut! I believe I've left my keys of at least an inch in diameter, and weigh
behind ''' fumble in one's pockets, and
so manage to let the bird, beast or fish
get well out of range.
By executing this manoeuvre you
achieve many most desirable ends. You
save a cartridge–two, if the bird, beast
or fish is travelling slowly—give your-
self the satisfaction of knowing you'd
have potted it if you'd fired, and
prevent your fellow-guns airing their
pretty wit at the expense of your eleva-
tion, or trajectory, or parabola, or
something. Now it is to be hoped
the student sees the reason for such a
multiplicity of pockets.
Each pocket should have a box-pleat
running vertically down the centre, and
at least one leather button on its flap.
These buttons should be nearly spherical,

about two ounces each. The back of
the coat should have expanding pleats,
a cowl, aneroid barometer and Cape-
cart hood.
Some sportsmen favour tails—others
prefer a peaky semi-Directoire cutaway.
This is a matter of taste.
The sleeves, at the shoulder, should
be leg-o'-mutton, ruché, and cut on the
bias. Detachable non-skid epaulettes
may or may not be worn. At the wrist
both sleeves should have bear-skin cuffs,
the hair about four inches long. This
prevents wounded birds falling down
the sleeve and gives the coat a natty
appearance.
Now for the nether garment. Breeches
are most in vogue now, with a sliding

has hurriedly to vacate a lofty elm's
topmost fork, in rabbit shooting). They
should be constructed of gopher cor-
duroy, pitched within and without, and
should have an easily-identified symbol
neatly crewel-stitched in red silk, so that
one can tell which is the front. Most
handy, this, when dressing for king-
fisher shooting, which necessitates early
rising on dark mornings. It is usual
to cut shooting-pants with two legs.
The man who, when ordering trouser-
ines for shooting, fails to specify a
double allowance of brace buttons fore
and aft, is guilty of contributory negli-
gence.
The best footwear for shooting is a
pair of brown brogue shoes, with red
enamelled tongues, and spur blocks.
Some prefer pumps, I know, but I stick
to my guns in this matter, and plump
for brogues. Socks of the piston-ring
or aurora borealis pattern are de rigueur
just now; they should match, be worn
a l'insouciance, and be free from open-
work as to the heels.
Gaiters you must have. The hedge-
sparrow, though able to relish a joke
with the best of birds, has a rooted
aversion to bare knees, and, as even
Blosse and Crackwell seldom turn out
a pair of gunning-shorts that come
below the patella, the man who goes
afield with exposed knees takes his
puncturable epidermis in his hands, so
to speak. The gaiters must be of wart-
hog hide, tanned with Squarson's vinegar
and coal tar. This gives them that rich,
fruity appearance so pleasing to the
refined palate.
The vest is a matter of opinion. If
you wear shirts and things, there is
really no need to employ a waistcoat,
except your natural desire to avoid being
mistaken for a tar from H.M.S. Buzzard.
Your tie should be very fierce. You
may drop across a tiger at any time, and
although the human eye is well known
to exercise a wonderful influence over
the giant cat of the Midlands a gunner
with even two eyes is not so well pre-
pared for an encounter as he who
wears a decided Paisley tie. Such at
least is my reading of the evidence.
Now for the sportsman's head. You
may wear a polo cap, a pith helmet with
a Trinity (Dublin) band, or a Gibus. If
your purse is to be considered, you can
get some very maidenly effects in green
felt Tyrolese chapeaux. Personally, I
always affect a tweed roundabout. As
this is your shooting hat, let yourself go
a bit, and decorate it with three or four
shillings'-worth of fishing tackle. Half-
a dozen trout casts, a paternoster or two,
a Texas Devil spoon-bait and a landing
net (not necessarily on the handle) are
the least you can sport. Remember that
the hat proclaims the sportsman. The
uneasiness aphoristically associated with
the head that wears a crown is nothing
to the tristesse of a man at a big shoot
who wears a simple sun-bonnet, just
like one of H. W. ESMOND's heroines.
Now comes the matter of a gun. If
you are going to shoot only now and
then, over week-ends (and some of my
happiest Sundays have been spent among
the roots down Harpenden way, bowling
over caterpillars), make shift with a pair
of hammerless ejectors. But if you are
going to follow the calendar, and shoot
from partridges to parrakeets, right
round the year, you cannot do better
than get a Daisy air-rifle from Jamage's,
alongside the blind newsvendor's cabin,
in Holborn. You may take it as being
true that a really good gun cannot be got
for a smaller sum than three half-crowns,
unless you hang round auction-rooms and
get a Manxman to bid for you, when you
see something good in the catalogue.
The gun is everything—even more. A
guest who turns up at a country-house
with a bow and arrows, catapult, or even
a “footpad's terror” Derringer, is not
reckoned very smart in these days.
In selecting a game-bag, get one of
those Canadian - Indian articles from
Dossenheimer's, in Shoe Lane. They
may be distinguished at sight by the
fringe, which is of wigwam or wanpum.
I have a sneaking preference for the latter.
This game-bag should not be too large.
If it will accommodate a couple of ten-
pointers (as the sportsman designates
the larger-built chaffinches) it will pro-
bably serve your purpose.
Now for ammunition. If you take
the trouble to run down to Whale Island
you can often pick up some old Service
stuff cheaply. It is simply a matter of
squaring the Admiralty office-boy. But
be sure you know the bore and stroke of
your weapon. Those most commonly in
use are 90 m/m by 120 m/m, with
mechanically-operated inlet valves and
ample water-jackets. If you turn up at
a shoot with a .22 Belgian clavicle-
smasher and two hundred rounds of 4.7
blank, ten to one the other fellows will
think you are a green hand. Speaking
of colours, Sir HIRAM MAXIM has laid
down the law that the colouration of
cartridge-cases has little bearing upon
the effectiveness of their contents. I
always use pink; but WIRCHOW has
argued with some force that they should
really chime in nicely with one's socks
or tie.
I find that the limitations of space
will not allow me to say anything about
the use of the gun, but that is, after all,
a trivial matter; it's the costume and
the implements that really count.

GREAT ARTIST'S
r
EARLY DAYS.
PATHETIC LECTURE.
THE last of the deeply interesting
series of lectures on “The Altruism of
Art” was delivered by Professor the
Right Hon. and Reverend Sir Halbert
Firconer at Olympia on Friday night.
The Professor, who wore the uniform
of the Blue Bavarian Cuirassiers, of
which he is honorary bandmaster, de-
voted his address to a recital of his
early struggles and the conquest of
difficulties which might have daunted
a less intrepid and versatile artistic
descendant of the ADMIRABLE CRICHTON.
His first studio, said Sir Halbert, was
the disused stable of a giraffe, being
some 12 feet square and 24 feet high.
Yet it was in this circumscribed area
that he set to work on his famous
picture, The Last of the Great Eastern.
For that canvas it was necessary for
him to fix a seat halfway up one wall
and strap himself into it while he
painted sideways. But one day, in
order to work at the bows of the vessel,
he had to fix his seat 20 feet from the
ground, and, one of the straps breaking,
he was precipitated head-first into a
barrel of burnt umber, from which he
was extricated with great difficulty by a
passing policeman, who heard his shouts
and rushed in to his assistance.
A strange feeling of drowsiness came
over him, premonitory of a total eclipse
of his powers. But the picture had at
all hazards to be finished for that year's
Academy—the only question was how 2
To stave off the feeling of lassitude, he
drank strong coffee every five minutes
for three weeks, while to build up his
strength he purchased an electric
battery, a keg of cod-liver oil, and
fifteen peach-fed Californian hams. So
the great work was done, and a gleam
of sunshine irradiated his gloom when
an unknown patron purchased the pic-
ture for £5,000 before it was sent into
the Academy, where it was the cynosure
of every eye. Within a week of the
opening of the Academy he had
received letters of congratulation from
two crowned heads, three archbishops,
seventeen belted earls, and the late
Mr. TRACY TURNERELLI.
At a later stage in his career, when
he had painted 300 portraits of
M.F.H.’s in 300 days, an unsympathetic
critic declared that “Firconer could
paint men, but he could not paint
animals.” Incensed by the injustice
of this remark, he retorted by
painting his famous and colossal canvas
of The Animals entering the Ark,
which completely paralysed his de-
tractors. Although it was now more
than fifteen years since that picture
was painted, it still held the field as

the largest and most exhaustive repre-
sentation of the great Noachian enter-
prise, and to this day he still received
commissions from menagerie proprietors
in both hemispheres on the strength
of it.
At a still later stage another critic
declared that Firconer could never do
anything on a canvas less than 20 feet
square—referring, doubtless, to a series
of colossal groups which had excited
the envy of incompetent contemporaries,
and caused several overrated old masters
to turn somersaults in their family
vaults. Here again his answer proved
that the brush is mightier than the
tongue. In the space of six weeks he
painted on a canvas exactly the size of
a threepenny bit a picture containing
portraits of every single member of the
House of Lords. The exertion was
tremendous, but he kept himself going
by using a Samson Chest Developer
which increased his girth by 17 inches,
and when the picture was exhibited he
was at once elected an honorary member
of the Microscopical Society and His-
toriographer Royal to the Mint. Subse-
quently he received so many Orders
that it became necessary for him to
assume the title of Reverend, which
harmonized at once with his appearance
and the spiritual character of his work.
The Right Honourable Professor then
gave a vivid account of his experiences
as honorary conductor of the band of
the Blue Bavarian Cuirassiers, illus-
trating his narrative with solos on the
double-bass, the piccolo, the tenor
trombone and the slide trumpet. He
finally gave a daring exhibition of his
skill on the trapeze, danced a pavane,
accompanying himself on the castanets,
and brought down the house by singing
Wotan's Abschied in costume, with
a beard of prehistoric bushiness and
volume.

WHEN, on almost the first page of Lady Letty Brandon
(LONG), we are told by “ANNIE E. Holdsworth" that her
heroine possesses an illegitimate elder sister, Janet, who is
her exact double, nine novel readers out of ten will suspect
that they are embarking upon a tale of mistaken identity.
It is a suspicion, however, which far underestimates the truth.

It is not an easy thing nowadays to think out a new villain,
but I believe Mr. PERCY WHITE has done it. In The Rescuer
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), Athelstan, a young man with dark hair
and penetrating eyes, is making the most of the fact that
the late Edgar Maitland, whom he assisted in scientific
research, believed himself to have discovered the existence
of visible, or at any rate photographable, brain waves. Mait-
land dies before the discovery is ripe for publication, and on
his death-bed he entrusts his widow and Athelstan with the
duty of seeing it through. Athelstan, having originated the
thing in the first place by deluding Maitland with a faked
photograph, keeps up the deception by hinting vaguely at
success in the near future. Meanwhile he does himself very

hard to believe that a writer of
the reputation of Mrs. LEE-

to take seriously the troubles of
a lady who has to keep “running

Matters are thus when the

which he gradually fetches up

makes for pleasurable excitement.

but he is not quite so happy at defining remedies. So in
the longest of his stories, The Adventurous Frenchman, he
suggests in a very racy fashion the perils of a contrabandist
during the Russo-Japanese war; but he either skates over
the details of their surmounting, or else finds a rather too
easy way out. But the interest of his book is, for me at
least, quite independent of its adventures. Mr. WEALE con-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW OPERATIC CRITICISM.
INFECTED by the vivacious example of
Mr. A. B. WALKLEY, the operatic critic
of The Times has discarded the old
traditions of sobriety, and, in a notice
of WAGNER's Götterdämmerung, has lapsed
into the now familiar blend of classical
allusiveness with up-to-date argot. At
this rate of progress we may soon expect
to see criticisms in the following vein
blossoming forth in all the bravery of
large type:—
CARMEN (VERY) SECULARE.
“‘Pagan, I regret to say,’ said Mr.
Pecksniff,” and Pagan is certainly the
mot juste to apply to Carmen, performed
with the utmost brio last night at
Covent Garden. But the ethics of opera
are not those of let us say—Brixton.
The famous cigarette factory at Seville
where Carmen —belli teterrima causa-
worked did not come under the super-
vision of any Factory or Workmen's
Compensation Acts. Hinc illae lacrimae
—cigarette girls are a nice quiet set, “I
don’t fink'' | Besides, Don José did
not belong to the Territorial Army. If
he had worn a simple uniform of khaki
instead of those épatants yellow breeches,
no complications would have ensued.
But, as Mr. HENRY JAMES remarks, “There
you are ' " Spain is not Suburbia,
and, given these tropical premisses,
events are bound to move forward
to the inevitable peripeteia. Besides,
Carmen, though at the outset a rather
squalid and tawdry personage, grows in
stature as the drama advances, until at
the end she has become one of the
supremely great figures of tragedy
where Antigone is to be found, along
with Dido, Cordelia and Violet Charles-
WORTH.
Mme. Pippa de Dietrich, who under-
took the title rôle last night, has un-
doubtedly an arresting and vivid per-
sonality. Though she lacks the grandeur
of CALVá–the sublimity which, as
LONGINUs says, is a reverberation of mag-
nanimity, she moves and sings with a
sort of inspired canaillerie which is
vastly reſreshing. Only the most stoical
of eremites could resist the corybantic
seduction of her dancing; and Don José
was no plaster saint, but a simple human
Spanish “Tommy.” It is, in fact, the
ol J, old story of Belle and the Dragoon,
in which the latter is bound to come off
second best when the tertius gaudens
happens to be a famous bull-fighter.
Antonio—we mean Escamillo—was bril-
liantly played by Signor Caldanino, the
famous Basque baritone, who bears a
most curious resemblance to Mr. C. B.
I'RY.
The mounting of the opera was at once
realistic and picturesque, but we cannot
refrain from expressing our poignant
regret that the example of RICHARD
STRAUss — and let us add RICHARD
WAGNER—of introducing live stock on
the stage was not followed. A Bull
Ring without bulls is an oxymoron in
excelsis. Surely the resources of Leaden-
hall Market would have been equal
to the cocasion. The tavern scene,
again, was somewhat lacking in orgiastic
élan, and compared with the latest
exponents of the art, some of the dancers
seemed to suffer from a positive plethora
of garments. But, as Mr. PéLISSIER says,
“the sun's still shining in the sky,” and
if NIETZSCIIE is right in his aphorism, “Il
faut Méditerraniser la musique,” no fault
can be found with this auspicious revival.
We may note that as a practical proof
of the Syndicate's honourable determina-
tion not to indulge in any preferential
treatment, the name of one of the
dramatis personae had been thoughtfully
changed i. Mercédès to Carburetta.
FORGOTTEN HEROES :
OR, “STILL RUNNING.”
[The French submarine Z has just been found
to have been lying forgotten for three years..]
RUMOUR reaches us that Austria has
explained the billeting of a force of
hers on a town in Macedonia during the
last three months. The force had been
despatched from headquarters with
general orders to annex territory, and in
the hurry of re-arrangements in the
Balkans had been overlooked. Austria
has now offered to withdraw the troops
not having occurred.
Extraordinary excitement is reported
to have been caused in German military
circles by the disappearance of two
entire regiments of infantry from a
garrison town in Westphalia. The order
countermanding the march was handed
to the EMPEROR for examination, passed
on by him to the CHANCELLOR, transferred
to the SECRETARY FOR WAR, forwarded
by him to the Foreign Office, where
it appears to have been lost. The regi-
ments continued their march, in the face
of every opposition, through Poland and
across Russia, being aware that dis-
obedience of their orders would be fatal.
When last heard of they had just fought
a terrific engagement with a savage
force of four times their number in the
centre of Tibet, and were continuing
their advance by forced marches in the
direction of Eastern Japan. The inci-
dent is naturally taken as an “unfriendly
act” by all the Powers whose territories
they have invaded, and furious wireless
messages are being hourly despatched
in the attempt to stop them. The force
had really been intended to act as a
unreservedly, and regard the incident as
guard of honour to the mayor of a small
town a few miles away.
Great anxiety is felt as to the Army
aeroplane Casabianca. In order to re-
trieve previous failures, she was sent up
with directions to break all existing
records. She has now been round the
world three times, and when last seen
was passing over Orkney and Shetland
at a rapid rate, the crew working with
desperation, but apparently much ex-
hausted. They mistook frantic signals
of recall for encouragement to renewed
efforts.
WILLIAM'S LICENCE.
DEAR SIR,-As the owner of Toby,
that easily first (Latin, facile princeps)
among educated dogs, you will be
interested to hear of the exploits of my
dog, William Shakspeare, and more
particularly since some notoriety has
recently been accorded by The Daily
Chronicle to a dog which went to a post-
office and procured its own licence.
This is a feat which my dog performs
regularly every year, not merely, as The
Chronicle dog did, “standing up to the
top of the counter” and handing in a
note with money, but actually going
behind the counter and selecting the
paper himself from other similar ones
relating to foreign postage, filling it in
with his name, address and pedigree,
and paying spot cash on the transaction.
Further, having obtained the licence, he
files it away in a safe corner of his kennel.
But this year the Divine William, as he
likes to be called, surpassed himself.
Some time ago I had the misfortune to
receive a bad half-sovereign, and through
inadvertence William took this coin
when he went on his annual visit to the
local post office. He did not discover
the error until he was too far on his
way to turn back—the office is some
seven miles from my house. At first he
was nonplussed (I confess it), but he
quickly decided what to do. Jumping
on a passing omnibus he barked for a
twopenny ticket and successfully ten-
dered the half-sovereign in payment.
Then with 9s. 10d. he proceeded to do
his business, bringing back 2s. 4d.
change. I should mention that in
former years it has been my custom to
give him twopence for himself, so that,
believing him to have deducted this
honorarium, I accepted the change as
correct. Such is William's modesty that
it was only through overhearing an after-
dinner talk in dog Latin between him
and the gardener that I learned the
truth. My first impulse was to repri-
mand him severely, but I refrained, for,
after all, one cannot expect a too high
degree of morality in dumb animals.
I am, etc.,
WILLIAM's Own ER.

78 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[FEBRUARY 3, 1909.
ANOTHER OLYMPIC GAME.
AN attendant skated up to me and
touched me on the shoulder. “You
mustn't go so fast, sir,” he said. “It’s
dangerous when there are so many
people about.”
“My good man,” I began, turning to
him indignantly. Then my feet left me
suddenly, came back with a great effort
the wrong way round, and gave it up
altogether. . . .
The attendant lifted me kindly.
“Thank you very much,” I said. “If
you will hold me tight, I will go on with
my sentence. Thank you. Well, then,
I was about to say that it wasn't at all
my own idea going as fast as that, and
that nobody realised so intimately as I
how dangerous it was. Thank you again.
Now if you will be so good as to push
me off, I think I shall be able to show
you something.”
He gave me a push, and I sailed right
down the course into a strange lady,
apologised, and came down heavily.
She struggled for a moment and then
decided to sit down too.
“I’m very sorry,” she began sweetly.
“I expect it was my—— Hallo! But
how splendid ' "
“Good morning,” I said. “I'm
simply meeting everybody here to-day.”
“In London,” said Miss Middleton
with an air of detachment, “one is
always running into one's friends. Now,
are you going to lift me up or must
I scream for help ?”
“I am going to lift you up,” I said,
and I took her hand, pulled myself up
by it, pulled her up, and sat down very
violently again. “There you are,” I
added ; “and now, if you will have me
dragged to the side, I will explain all.”
We got to the edge somehow, and
clung on to the rails.
“This is most awfully bad for me,” I
began. “The things I say when I fall
down. Oh, it doesn't do at all, you
know. And I used to think myself such
a quiet and well-spoken lad.”
“Now your true nature is revealed.”
“Ah, yes. It brings out the old
Adam . . . or something rather like it
. . every time.”
“You should have a man,” said Miss
Middleton; “I did, and I made him fall
down. I felt so proud.”
“I had a man once, but I simply
couldn't bring him down, though I did
try. I must have showed him all the
holds. I put the wrist-lock and the
neck-clutch on him.”
“Twice round the wrist is once round
the neck,” said Miss Middleton ; “twice
round the neck is once round the waist;
twice round the waist is——”
I took the floor at once on letting go
of the rails, and Miss Middleton, who, it
seemed, had had a day's start of me and
was therefore much more steady, helped
me up again.
“Thank you very much. I'm wear-
ing quite a place in the back of my
head. It's so tiring.”
We skated slowly down the length of
the course. That is to say, we started
slowly, but at halfway we were going
much faster than I liked.
“I have a secret to tell you,” I began.
“Oh, do,” said Miss Middleton. “Tell
me the romantic secret of your birth.
What they call sotto voce.”
“Yes, I'll tell you that another time.
What I want to say now is this. I can't
stop and I can't turn. Do you think,
before we get to the end, you could
explain one or the other to me?”
“I believe you can do both at once by
putting one foot behind the other.”
“Oh, I know that way all right. But
then there's the bother of getting up
again.”
“Then suppose we free-wheel so that
we shan't be going so fast when the
accident happens.”
-“I think so. You know, these things
want brakes really . . . Do you see
that woman in red, straight in front,
leaning against the rails?”
“Yes. Why?”
“Oh, nothing . . . I wonder if she's
a mother.”
“Sure to be. A lot of girls and one
boy at Cambridge sort of mother.”
“Oh . . . I think I shall say I knew
the boy at Cambridge. Would you care
about coming too?”
“No, I must try to turn.”
“You don't mind my not stopping
and picking you up 2 I simply must
go and see this woman.”
“All right. You may say I was at
school with one of the girls, if you like.
Gladys. Good-bye.” -
I rolled relentlessly on. There was a
crash behind me, but I dared not look
back. I had other business on hand.
It was bound to come. . . It was
coming . . . coming . . .
PLOP 1
“I’m very sorry,” I murmured for the
two hundred and eighty-fourth time that
day, “but I knew your son slightly—I
mean my daughter Gladys knows Miss
Midd The fact is,” I said in a burst of
candour, “I’m only a beginner at this.”
“Doesn't matter at all,” she said with
a motherly smile. “Guess we're all
falling about to-day. Very pleased to
have kept you from hurting yourself.”
“Thank you very much,” I said for
the three hundred and ninety-third time.
I put my hand to my head, realised sud-

It was useless. down violently. . . .
“Thank you very much,” I said; “I’m
giving you a lot of trouble, I'm afraid.
Good morning.”
“Well,” said Miss Middleton when I
caught her up again, “I fell down all
right. How's Gladys P’’
“I made a mistake; I didn't know
them, after all. I say, will you do some-
thing for me?”
“What's the matter ?
will.”
“I’ve been thinking, and I fancy I've
made a discovery. Now I want you to
say something rather startling to me.
Quite suddenly, you know.”
“I can't think of anything, not like
that. Except that your great uncle's
died and left you a million pounds and
a pair of roller skates.”
“No, that isn't at all the sort of ——”
“Your tie's all crooked.”
I went down with a crash. . . .
“Well,” said Miss Middleton, as we
clung on to the side, “was that all
right 2' -
“Perfectly,” I said, with enthusiasm.
“That's my discovery, that the whole
thing is mental. If we could only keep
our minds quite placid we should be all
right. When I tried to take off my hat
to my American friend and found I
couldn't, I went down like a log. So I
did just now. By the way, my tie isn't
really crooked, is it? No; I thought it
couldn't be. Well, now let's roll round
the room perfectly easily together, hold-
ing hands and fixing our thoughts on
something calm and soothing, which has
nothing to do with skating.”
“Mother,” suggested Miss Middleton.
“Try again.” - -
“Cod-liver oil.”
“All right. Now then, are you ready ?
Go! . . . Do you know, it's a very
funny thing, but I don't think I had
ever realised that a cod had a liver.”
“I once had a gold-fish, and it drank
up all its water and died of indigestion,
because we ſound it dead in the morning
at the bottom of an empty bowl. Which
looks like liver.”
We were simply skimming over the
floor by this time.
“There was once a halibut,” I began.
We swept round a corner in style.

“A funny sort of fish,” Miss Middle-

eighth circle, “ something like a-what

My feet gave a sudden jerk,
“Oh no, no,” cried Miss Middleton,
“I didn't mean a skate—— It wasn't a
bit I mean I——”
It was too late. The fatal word
brought it all back to me. My feet
leapt up into the air, and all the rest of
us took their place upon the floor with

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CONSOLATION.
As the body of William Smith was
leaving the cemetery chapel on its
way to the grave, an elderly gentleman
of aristocratic mien alighted from an
electric brougham, and after a word
with an official joined the little band of
In Ourners.
William Smith was moving more
slowly than be ever had done in life,
for he had been a commercial traveller
noted for his briskness until double
pneumonia set in.
Mrs. Smith had seen her husband
infrequently, and then only for brief
week-ends, but she respected him
deeply, was grateful for the position
to which he had raised her, and,
weeping steadily now at the graveside,
had accepted grief as her destiny.
The ceremony over, the stranger
approached Mrs. Smith in an attitude
of sympathetic courtesy, and offered her
his arm to the gate. He told her how
highly he had always valued her
husband, how completely they had
understood each other, and how different
everything had been since they parted.
The widow listened with respect
and satisfaction, in no way embarrassed
by her ignorance of the gentleman's
name, for her husband naturally had
had many friends unknown to herself,
although this one certainly seemed to be
both in attire and in address far re-
moved above her idea of the majority of
them, several of whom were indeed
present.
“If there is anything I can do, Mrs.
Smith,” said the stranger as he shook
her hand at the entrance, “you must
write to me. You will see that I have
moved to another town house,” and
handing her his card he lifted h’s hat
with a gesture of reverent courtesy,
stepped rapidly into his brougham, and
was driven away.
The widow looked at the card, and
reeled. It was that of the Earl of
Borrodaile.
One by one, as the high tea pro-
gressed, anecdotes of the Earl of Borro-
daile came to the memory of this guest
and that—his wealth, his career, his wild
oats, his famous or infamous ancestry,
but most of all, recurring and recurring,
bis perfect manners, the unmistakable
affability of your true nobleman, as com-
pared with the supercilious condescen-
sion of the spurious political breed, with
a word for the modesty (or craſtiness) of
the deceased in keeping so distinguished
a friendship a secret from his older pals.
The next day one of the guests sent
the widow not only a cabinet photograph
of the earl but also his caricature, by no
means unkindly done, from Vanity Fair.
These pictures, one in the parlour framed
in gilt, and one in Mrs. Smith's bedroom

out to her friends and callers, with suit-

self but of his intimacy with her husband:

fectly the mistress of herself, serene in
anecdotage. For by the infinite mercy
of Heaven she has never learned that
the Earl of Borrodaile was under the
impression that he was consoling the
widow of William Smith, his old pen-
sioned valet, whose funeral had been in
progress only a few yards distant at the
same time.

Sir FREDERICK TREVEs having recently
brought to notice the high intrinsic
value of radium, as well as its curative
value, we think it may become necessary
soon to revise certain well-known pro-
verbs and phrases, and we make the
following tentative suggestions:—
All is not radium that is energetic.
As good as radium (applied to a
sleeping child). -
He has a heart of radium (this ſo
certain uncles and benevolent gen-
tlemen generally).
Pound wise, tube-oſ-radium foolish
Take care of the pounds, the radium
will take care of itself.
Speech is golden ; silence is radiumen.
We may add that those who have
been in the habit of selling their souls
for gold will probably not be aſſected
by the alteration, as the value of the
souls in question is not likely to tempt
higher bidders.

“UNDER ENTIRELY NEW MANAGEMENT 1 ''
(From a private diary which may, quite possibly, remain unwritten.)
April 1st, 19–. Always knew the will of the People
must prevail some day. But not so soon as this. To think
that all the Means of Production, Distribution, and Exchange
are now completely Socialised, and Labour emancipated from
domination of Landlordism and Capitalism, without so much
as a blow being struck! Why they should have chosen my
humble self as President is beyond me. Of course, the name
of Alaric Poshford was familiar enough to them in connection
with a certain power of impassioned eloquence, combined
with unusual lucidity in explaining . economics of
Socialism. But I could almost wish Social Revolution had
arrived more gradually. Labour Party rather forced my
hand. So many details that I should have liked a few more
years to think out. Have chosen Comrades Sowerbutts,
Grafftey, Bilger, Sleech, Yem, Crowl, and Kloppski as
Members of my Inner Council. None of them, perhaps, men
of quite first-rate intellectual capacity,
Eleusis Lodge (formerly Buckingham Palace), from leading
Trades Unions, Industrial, Co-operative, Benefit, and Building
Societies. Thought, at first, they had come to offer congra-
tulations—but they hadn't. Seems they 've been getting
uneasy as to security of investments from which much of
their income formerly derived. Reminded them that Labour
had long ago declared itself for Socialism; that, from
Socialistic point of view, all interest was Robbery. That
they no longer required funds, as the State in future would
do all they had been instituted to do —and do it a precious
deal better. In short, as I put it to them pleasantly, they
couldn't expect to have their cake and eat it too. Deputation
thanked me, and withdrew.
May 2nd. Re-housing Problem solved by settling Slum
Population in the various unoccupied West-End mansions.
Some little friction, owing to all the families wanting the
drawing-room floors. And they will insist on using the
banisters for fuel! Issue Manifesto calling on Citizens to
protect their own property.
May 3rd. In Council. Comrade
but all grand workers and accus-
tomed to act under me. Sowerbutts
will undertake Home Departments,
while Kloppski—being at home in
several Continental languages—will
be the very man for what used to be
called the Foreign Office. Comrade
Grafftey, who as a former East-End
Guardian has had considerable expe-
rience in financial management, would
like to be in charge of the Exchequer.
He may be competent. Better leave
it open for the present, perhaps.
April 2nd. Comrade Sowerbutts
has found hopeless confusion in all
the Public Offices. And none of the
permanent officials there to afford the
slightest information | Some of them
might have stayed on long enough to
show us the ropes. They seem to
have taken our denunciations of the
Bureaucracy much too seriously.
Well, we can do without them
April 3rd. Comrade Yem proposes
Revision of Fares on the recently
Nationalised Railways. No distinc-
tion of Classes, and Return Tickets to
HEARD
ONLY!”
Voice of Conductor (through fog). “Room for ONE
Grafftey reported that the depleted
state of National Exchequer renders
it advisable to cut down all but abso-
lutely necessary expenses. Comrade
Bilger moved that, private property
being now abolished and all incen-
tive to crime consequently removed,
the State should economise by dis-
pensing with Police Force. Seconded
warmly by Comrade Kloppski, who
had never seen any advantage in
having Police. Comrade Sleech moved
amendment to include Army, Navy,
and Territorial Forces, pointing out
that a Socialist State, having no
frontiers, logically requires no de-
fences. Carried mem. con. Find that
Kloppski has sent out messages to all
the principal nations, informing them
of our glorious Social Revolution, ex-
horting them to follow our example,
and assuring them of our unalterable
determination to regard them as
Brothers. Quite right, only he
might have consulted me first. The
only notice Foreign Governments
anywhere for half-a-crown. Have them, by all means. We
can afford it now, with no dividends to hamper us. And I
observe that traffic returns on the S.E. & C. especially, show
enormous increase for last few weeks.
April 4th. Making splendid progress! No more Un-
emºj", even Unemployables | All earning skilled
wages in the innumerable factories, industries, etc., taken
over by State as going concerns. Our revenue ought to
reach a tidy figure by end of month. But daily outgoings
for free meals, free clothes, old-age pensions for everybody
over forty, and so forth, work out at rather more than Com-
rade Grafitey anticipated. No matter. Can't we levy a
super-tax on all the idle rich 2 Annoyed to find there are
none. All left country by now, with everything they could
realise!, Cowards! Capitalist employers, too, have trans-
ferred their works to Colonies or Continent, instead of show-
ing manly confidence in their fellow-citizens' sense of justiceſ
But perhaps Comrades Crowl and Sowerbutts were unneces-
sarily frank about their intentions. Crowl says, finely, that
“Ship of State will ride the lighter now the rats have
abandoned it.” All the same, we could have done with a
few of the richer rats on board.
May 1st. Received Deputation at my official residence,
have taken of our friendly overtures
has been to recall their Ambassadors. Let them . We have
no desire for intimate relations with a pack of alien diplo-
matists with whom, as aristocrats, we could have little in
common. But offensive, all the same. We are not dogs!
June 1st. Comrade Grafftey can't make out why so little
money comes in. Returns from all our Socialised Industries
(with exception of State Distilleries and Breweries, which, in
spite of complaints of deterioration in quality of liquor, do
show a slight profit) most unsatisfactory. Sleech says present
working shifts far too short. A Citizen has no sooner looked
round and grasped general idea of task expected from him
before his two hours are up and it's time to knock off. But
surely he must have leisure to develop intellectually and
morally—in short, to taste the joys of life! And what about
all our disbanded soldiers and sailors ? If we 're to find
employment for them, the shifts will have to be shorter, rather
than longer. Bilger says we can't ask decent citizens to
labour side by side with persons they regard as no better
than “hired murderers.” Still can't understand why our
output is so small and sales so limited. Sleech says because
our Citizens don't put any vim into their work. Then why
not appoint overseers to keep them up to it? Better not,
perhaps—the People might resent it.

he could trust to float a loan for us. Disgraceful how the
National Credit has been lowered by the infamous band of
brigands who formerly mismanaged the country ! We might
try using a paper currency—but would our Citizens stand
it? Kloppski has brilliant idea. Our Fleet useless to Us—
but ought to be worth something to some State benighted
enough to attach any importance to command of the sea.
Offers to approach representatives of foreign Powers on the

full power to negotiate on behalf of State.

in exchange. So, unless all Citizens abandon industrial
r|labour as useless, and take to tilling the soil energetically at
once, we shall be within measurable distance of starvation in
six months'
Aug. 2nd. Believe, even now, there would have been no
serious disturbances but for rumour that a formidable foreign
navy was preparing to steam for our coast. Kloppski, at
some personal inconvenience, put off a voyage he was taking
to Buenos Ayres for reasons of health, and endeavoured to
calm mob by announcing method by which he had relieved
them from the intolerable burden of our bloated armaments,
and assuring them that the foreign fleet was merely coming
with the peaceful purpose of convoying home its country's
purchases. Unluckily, lamp-post only too convenient! . . .
Citizens are now betraying Socialism by electing Committee
of Public Safety from the very class of professional butchers
they so lately regarded with loathing! The spirit of
militarism is again rampant. Fleet and Army being rapidly.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
IN THE PLAYGROUND.
Villa Sans-Gêne, Casinoville.
DEAREST DAPHNE, - Behold your
Blanche revelling in sunshine and blue
skies, while you, poor dear, are beset
with anti-cyclones and V-shaped depres-
sions or else beastly fogs. Josiah's
in Central America on business—one of
his Companies is financing a revolution
or a republic or something out there;
so I took the opportunity to nip over
here with Bosh and Wee-Wee, for my
delicate chest will not stand an English
February.
There's quite a nice lively set here.
No don'ters among us. Know what a
don'ter is, my sweet? Pri-
Wee-Wee. “You've used my dream-
number, and worn out the luck, and now
it's no use my going to back it ! Oh,
how wicked to rob a poor woman of her
dreams in that way! Call that being a
husband 2 ” “No,” said Bosh, ..i.
walking off; “I call it being a winner—
quite a different thing.” It’s the first
time I ever knew them nasty to each
other; but they're all right again now.
Still, I think Wee-Wee's temper is just
the teeniest bit spoilt by so much
roulette. For instance, when she and I
were discussing the Fancy Dress Dance
at the Casino to-morrow night, and she
said she and Bosh meant to go as Rouge-
et-Noir, I made the innocent remark,
“Why not go as the other thing–Trente
- -
sure enough there was a run on red,
and your Blanche was a happy little
woman
Clinton and Clytie gave a freak lunch
the other day. We all pretended we
belonged to the submerged tenth, and
tried which could talk most slang.
Clinton was easily first with his “Tender-
loin’” patter. He was got up as a New
York tough, and Clytie as a toughess.
I went as an East-End Sally-girl, with a
little shawl and an apron, and “ſevvers.”
Bosh and Wee-Wee came as paupers.
(“It’s only anticipating a little,” Bosh
said; “it’s what Wee-Wee's passion for
roulette will soon bring us to!") Mélanie
de Chateauvieux and her Comte (didn't
Itell you they were here?) were Apaches,
and after lunch they did
the brake on. Husbands are
almost always don'ters. Wee-
Wee's the only wife I know
who doesn't consider her hus-
band one. But they're quite
an extraordinary couple.
They don't consider a holiday
a bit spoilt by being together.
I said something about it
to them yesterday, and Bosh
said, Yes, he supposed it
was a bad habit they'd got
into.
We're all stuck on Systems |\\
here. It's the chief topic. W
I've got a System, of course.

Oh, m'amie, the sea and
sky are so divinely blue to-
day that, as I said when
some of us were strolling on
the Terrace just now, it's
enough to make even a
sensible person a poet.
“Yes,” said Bosh, “the
Mediterranean's a very de

about it, though compara-
tively few can spellit. Wee-
Wee wrote a poem about it
when we were 'mooning in
these parts ages ago; she

Her System is to look for tips every-

she turns into a number, and goes and
backs it. And she dreams too. Such
fun, my dear! The other night she
dreamed a number, and, like a donkey,
mentioned it to Bosh at breakfast. At
our usual time she and I went to the
Rooms distractingly got up, and covered
with mascots and lucky charms. She
was all excitement about ber dream

away. “Thanks, little woman,” he said
to Wee-Wee. “I backed your dream-

fledged butterfly, which is still alive and
flourishing, in her bedroom. Butterflies are an
unusual phenomenon at this time of the year,
and I am curious to know what it signifies as
an omen.”—Daily Express.
[IF we receive any more letters like
the following they will be destroyed.]
DEAR SIR,--This is indeed a “year
of anniversaries,” and yesterday was the
86th anniversary of my grandfather's
birth. He was very much perturbed
because an exceptionally fat robin came
and stared at him through the window
for fully a minute and then flew away
without a word. I would like to know
if any of your readers have had a similar
weird experience. H. L. SAMs.

DEAR SIR,-Last Monday my little
daughter was exactly a year old, and on
going into the nursery what was my
surprise to see a mouse disappear behind
the skirting. My wife and l have neither
of us ever seen a mouse in this room
before (although we have had them in
the kitchen), and we cannot help feeling
that there is more in the incident than
meets the eye. My little girl knows
nothing about it and is up till now quite.
well. J. B. PHIBBS.

DEAR SIR,-Seeing your interesting
correspondence on “Omens,” I thought
your readers might like to hear my
experience. Some time ago our cat
presented us with kittens (triplets), two
of which we had made up our minds
to drown as soon as they were old
enough to stand it. On the very day
fixed for the carrying out of the sentence,
my youngest boy, whose fourth anniver-
sary it was, had a miraculous escape from
wetting his feet in the Serpentine.
Needless to say we took the hint and the
kittens were spared, and we are now
firmer believers in omens than ever.
HERBERT J. MINCHIN.
17, St. Swithin Street,
Edgware Road.
DEAR SIR,-My wife's mother is a
great believer in omens and considers it
especially lucky to see a donkey on her
birthday. Her birthday was yesterday,
and she saw a donkey on Westminster
Bridge—although I was not with her at
the time. Taking the Underground
from there she inadvertently got into
an “Ealing Non-stop '' instead of an
“Inner Circle.” At Ealing the donkey
brought her the usual luck, for she
found a shilling on the platform, and
she eventually arrived home, tired but
triumphant, 7#d. to the good!

AT THE PLAY.
I.—“OUR Miss Gibbs.”
NEVER was there a man more fortunate
in the loyalty of his clientèle and his
critics than Mr. GEORGE EdwardEs at the
Gaiety. Let him give them pretty
faces, pretty frocks, pretty scenes
and pretty music, and they are
very simple creatures to please. It
doesn't matter if his author's ideas—
such as the love of a budding Earl
for a shop-girl—are as old as the ever-
lasting hills; or, worse still, are six
months behind the times, as in the
reproduction of the White City, or the
revival of the craze for amateur burglary.
Are not the old favourites all there ?
Is not Our Miss Gibbs no other than
Our Miss GERTIE MILLAR, who by any
other name would be as sweet? Is not
Mr. EDMUND PAYNE just himself again,
though he may imagine that he is dis-
guised in the local colour of a Yorkshire
lad 2 Is not Mr. GEORGE GROSSMITH,
junr., as fatuous as ever ? Do not the
two admirable “sets”—Garrod's Stores
and the Court of Honour at the White
City–offer the old familiar liberty, to
individuals and choruses, to behave in
the foreground as they would be ex-
pected to behave in no conceivable spot
in the universe ? What more could one
ask 2 -
Of course you need to be an habitué,
as I am not, to be in perfect touch with
these conditions. Thus, though Mr.
EDMUND PAYNE is always an irresistible
figure and an incomparable humorist, I
could not share the hilarity of the Pit
over his opening pleasantries. But to
them it made no difference what he said
or did, so long as he said or did it.
Then there is Mr. GEORGE GROSSMITH,
junr., with his established reputation
for playing the sportsman of the silly-ass
school. Yet to the cold eye of the com-
parative stranger there is something
curiously unfunny in his methods. Still,
I like his reserve; he never “presses”
or pretends to be amused by himself.
And he sings one song with a capital
chorus in praise of music's power as
demonstrated by the fiddler-conductors
of Hungarian bands.
Miss GERTIE Mili.AR, in the character
of a Yorkshire lass, has a song with one
most fascinating note in the music of
the last line. But the best was a duet
between her and Mr. EDMUND PAYNE on
the charms of their Yorkshire farm, and
nothing could be more moving than Mr.
PAYNE's appeal to us to come and sample
its beauties for ourselves.
I hope Mr. IMRé KIRALFY has been
invited to see his White City, and that
he had a better seat than mine—a chair
in a passage, with a large section of the
stage well out of my line of vision.
Even from that coign of disadvantage I
could see the gentleman who personated
him under the thin pseudonym of Mr.
Amalfy, and though I have never con-
sciously beheld the great universal im-

*Aſtadtw
provisor in the flesh I cannot believe
that this stage dandy did any justice to
his miraculous gifts.
Enfin, a very passable evening's dis-
traction for those who are in the vein
and a comfortable stall.
II.-“AN ENGLISHMAN's Hoxie.”
An Englishman's Home is announced
on the programme as “By a Patriot.”
I don't know if that gives everybody
else the feeling of horror and shame
that it gives me. A “Patriot” is gene-
rally defined as “a man who loves his
fatherland.” To wish to distinguish
yourself from your fellows as a man who
loves his fatherland; to wish to talk
about your love for your fatherland to
anybody--I cannot understand it. Has
the man no secret places in his heart?
And is there nothing that we may take for
granted about him? How, I wonder,
would he feel if he saw a play described
as “By a Pure Woman”?
But this is to be old-fashioned. Of
course I know really that in these days
a “patriot” means simply “a man who
believes that Germany could successfully
invade England.” Well, the author may
be right to call himself that; yet I cannot
see why he should wish to remain anony-
mous; for he has written a tremendous
play, to which anybody might be proud
to put his name. It is impossible to
describe fully such a mixture of laughter
and tears, throbs and thrills; un-
necessary to give the bare outlines of
the plot, seeing that all London knows
by now that it deals with the invasion
of this country by a foreign power. But
it is only right to say that the author
has presented his case for national
service with such rare tact that the play
would be void of offence even to the
most violent anti-militarist.
Yet there was in my mind all the
evening the feeling that the lesson was
not so effective as it was meant to be.
This, I think, was largely due to the
fact that the Bad Young Man, vulgar
but cheery, who spent his spare time
watching football and deriding the
Volunteers, was so delightfully human
that one could not help being attracted
to him; while the Good Young Man,
who spent his spare time learning to de-
fend his country, was such a stagey figure
and made such conventional speeches
that one was unconsciously repelled by
him. Had the Good Young Man been
cheery and companionable, and the Bad
Young Man not only vulgar but unreal,
then. . . . But the author, I fancy, was
too scrupulously fair to take that advan-
tage over his opponents.
Mr. LAWRENCE GROSSMITH plays the
cheerful bounder Geoffrey, and I shall
not attempt to express my admiration
of his fine performance. It is tribute
enough simply to have singled him out
from the remarkably clever cast which
interprets the play. I hope the compli-
ment will not be weakened if as an
aſterthought I add a special word
of praise for Mr. MAx LEEDs, who
is delightfully funny as a Volunteer
lieutenant. And this reminds me:
Geoffrey is rightly held up to contempt
for ridiculing the Volunteers in the First
Act, and yet all through the Second and
Third Acts the author is doing the very
same thing himself!
Still, a wonderful play. Wonderful,
and yet again wonderful, and after that
out of all whooping.
P.S.–I almost forgot to say that from a
military point of view, the most wonder-
ful bit of work of the evening was the
manner in which I found my way to
Wyndham's in the fog.

“There is no institute of its kind in existence
anywhere except the one in Paris. Thanks to
the munificence of Sir Ernest Cassel the new
one in London will be the finest in the world.”
“Every year the all-round shooting of the
Navy has improved, but never has it reached so
high a level as at present.”
These two extracts from The Daily
Chronicle have an honourable place in
our forthcoming book, The Journalistic
Touch; or Piling on the Praise.

saddle, he virtually stepped into the Pope's

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Patricia Baring (CoNSTABLE) was a little Australian girl
who began to keep a diary before she was nine years old.
She kept it so well and spelled so correctly (even the long
words) that, if you ask me, I think Miss WINIFRED JAMEs, who
also comes from the land of HILL and TRUMPER, kept it for
her... In fact, the book reads as if it were largely composed
of Miss JAMES's reminiscences of her own (geographically)
far-off childhood. It reveals a charming character and many
pretty and pleasant thoughts. But, apart from the spelling
difficulty, I don't believe that the earlier chapters could have
been written by Patricia herself. Little pitchers may have
long ears, but what runs in at one has fortunately a knack of
promptly running out at the other. Patricia couldn't have
remembered all those long conversations. When she is a
the chance of seeing the great actress for nothing was too
good to be lost. Besides, it might help him with his French.
To-day, so he told her on his tardy arrival, he had simply for-
gotten his engagement,owing to a press of business at the office.
But meanwhile the sympathetic stranger had been making hay
rather quickly. “Mariana,” he said—after a conversation of
less than four hundred words, containing a definite proposal
about half-way through—“May I call you Mariana?” “You
have,” was Mariana's terse but satisfactory reply; after
which what chance for Haversham the Unready ?" The little
story seems to me quite good fooling, delightfully typical of
American humour and Mr. CHARLEs BATTELL LOOMis.
A great part of Mr. R. P. HEARNE's book, Aerial Warfare
(LANE), is devoted to a very interesting and lucid exposition
of aeronautical theory and practice, but the keynote is to be
found in the sentence, “Already the German people have
given to ZEPPELIN several hundred thousand pounds—invested
the money in him, hoping
little older she becomes
more possible, and even
more charming. If I had
been a young man on the
spot I should certainly
have been at her feet with
the rest of them. But
think how difficult it is,
artistically speaking, for a
modest little woman like
Patricia to tell us, in her
own words, how clever and
fascinating and pretty the
young men found her.
She (or Miss WINIFRED
JAMES) has to adopt all
manner of devices to keep
up the illusion that she
is ignorant of her own
charms. And the devices
are so transparent. They
don't even take me in, and
I am not nearly as intelli-
gent as Patricia. The
story ends on a painfully
modern and tragic, nºte, |ze. --...o
that the speculation will
give the necessary “divi-
dend.’” The dividend is
the profit to be gained by
giving Great Britain the
best hiding she ever had,
and, says Mr. HEARNE, “it
is with a sickening feeling
that the growing appre-
hension of impending war
between Germany and
England has to be ad-
mitted.” Against our
danger we have the cheer-
--|ing statement of Sir HiRAM
MAXIM (who contributes an
Introductory chapter) that
H|in his judgment “balloons
can never be of any real
value either in peace or
war.” In which case,
since Count ZEPPELIN is
devoting his attention to
dirigible balloons as dis-
tinct from aeroplanes (for

the use of the first person singular if she wishes to fulfil the
undoubted promise of Patricia Baring and Bachelor Betty.
I commend A Holiday Touch (GEORGE BELL) to all
budding story-writers in search of a model of the sort of
thing that appeals to magazine editors on the other side of
the Atlantic. A light touch—the holiday touch, in fact—
Mr. CHARLEs BATTELL Loomis undoubtedly possesses. Gently
satirical, mildly sentimental, or downright farcical (his own
words, on which I dare not try to improve), his stories are
always cheerful and generally amusing, even when they
have a touch of pathos. I like best “The Unheard
Wedding March.” Mariana Leighton had waited so long at
the nuptial altar for her husband that was to have been that
at last all the wedding guests had stolen from the church,
murmuring, like the other Mariana, “He cometh not.” All,
that is, save one, and he a stranger in the land. To him
Mariana owned that this was the second time Chauncey
Haversham had left her in the lurch. A week before, as

And it is further satisfactory to note that the
old Roman usque ad caclum principle of land-ownership is
still in force, so that for the present if Germany should start

Seriously, however, there is a great deal in Mr. HEARNE's
book which military authorities would do well to study.
Although the youthful hero of The Adventures of Louis
Blake (WERNER LAURIE) tells his own tale, no charge of im-
modesty can be brought against him. Indeed, Louis BECKE
has kept such a tight hold upon Louis Blake that I am not
only convinced of the possibility of these adventures, but
also have a pleasing sensation that one might oneself have
taken a part in them without signal failure. “You would
have found it quite easy, if you had ever lived in the South
Sea Islands,” Louis the Second seems to say, and I am pre-
pared to believe him. I have to disapprove of Louis the First
in one particular; for, after an amusing opening, I came (on
page 18) to these ominous words, “I must now go back in my
story for a space,” and he does, and the space occupies sixty-
four pages. For the rest, the book may be strongly recom-
mended to boys, for it is full of life and the joie de vivre, and
it contains incidents enough to satisfy the greediest appetite.

HEI2 RETURN.
Being a wholly imaginatire anticipation of
the Proceedings at the Palace on the historic
might.
It has come at last, the long-desired
evening, the evening of Her re-appear-
ance. How long we have waited, but
how rich our reward | Not only all the
old dances that we love so much, the
Biblical hornpipe as of old round that
charming property from TUSSAUD's, but
new ones too, more convulsively spiritual,
more devoutly delirious, more sacredly
serpentine than ever.
Before the dancing began, an ode to
the Artiste from the emotional pen of
Sir ERNEST CASSEL was read by Sir John
FISHER, containing these memorable
lines:–
“Barefooted Bacchanal, would that I were
Kipling,
To celebrate thy marvellous arm-rippling.”
As She entered the theatre by the
stage door, it might be stated here,
more than 1,000 photographers blocked
the way, some with cameras, others
merely waiting to make appointments.
She was also waited upon by a deputa-
tion of hosiers asking that in one dance,
at any rate, she would wear stockings
or their trade would be gone. The
letters awaiting Her totalled 3,425, and
there were 873 telegrams of congratula-
tion. During the evening 114 floral
tributes reached the theatre.
The new dances were four in number,
and in them She personated in turn
PHARAOH's Daughter in her famous fan-
dango known tastefully as the bull
rush; JEPIITILAH's Daughter in her final
macabre. Ilebrew fling, on hearing of
her father's vow and her own fate;
URIAH's wife in her pas de liberté after
the battle; and JEZEBEL in her defiant
tarantella before a waxen ICLIJAII—all
new and all marvellously restrained (not
only in dress) and full of Scriptural tact.
What an evening !
Needless to say, every one was there;
all the old admirers and many new :
a portly and handsome Canon in his
stall following every movement with all
his accustomed leverence and rapture.
“It was like reading the Bible by flashes
of lightning,” he said afterwards; the
PRIME MINISTER in a private box; Mr.
WALKLEY, inarticulate even in French or
Greek in his costasy ; and a deputation
from the Bible Society. There were
also all the critics, the AGENT-GENERAI,
of CANADA, Sir GILBERT PARKER, M.P.,
and the Mayor of Frognal.
At the end of the turn the applause
lasted fourteen minutes, and She was
led on eleven times. Free restoratives
were then distributed in the theatre, am-
bulances removed those admirers who
were too far gone to remain any longer,
and the programme proceeded. Late at
night she was drawn to her residence at
Frognal in a carriage from which the
horses had been removed, the PRIME
MINISTER, Mr. WALKLEY, Mr. ALFRED BUTT
and a number of other ardent gentlemen
taking their places. Never was such a
triumph.
A DOG'S LIFE.
[According to an order which has just been
issued, any dog found in the streets within the
Metropolitan area unaccompanied by its master
within one hour after sunset and one hour
before sunrise will be liable to seizure by the
police.]
YE brindled bulls and chow-dogs,
Ye poodles, poms and Skyes,
Ye bandied crew of Scotties too,
I summon you to rise.
It is the moment now, dogs,
To listen to my call,
Whether ye be of pedigree
Or no degree at all.
These bipeds in the manger
Threaten a fearſul ſate
To any hound that toddles round
The streets a little late.
Our liberty's in danger;
Gay dogs must be unknown,
For after dark no canine spark
May wander forth alone.
No more, 'mid flying motors,
Shall we be free to work
The gutters where delicious fare
Is always sure to lurk.
The tasty tails of bloaters,
The cod-heads we adore—
These are delights at which o' nights
Our tails shall wag no more.
No more the midnight cabby
Shall raise his “Tally-ho!”
When Irish Pat rounds up the cat
That would a-wooing go.
IIenceforward Tom and Tabby
May court at ease and gloat
O'er our grim doom who can but fume
To hear their wooin' o't.
No longer may a bow-wow
Fed up with fender joys,
Steal off to meet along the street
The rowdy-dowdy boys.
There’ll be a horrid pow-wow
Unless he's pleased to stew
Beside the fire with no desire
To sow an oat or two.
Our masters mean to keep us
Cribbed in convention's pen,
Prim, comme il faut, until we grow
E'en duller dogs than men.
With bitter wrongs they heap us,
l{egardless of our rights—
Each dog, they say, still has his day,
But we demand our nights.

BRIGHT SUGGESTIONS FOR DARK
EVENINGS.
To make a Whatnot.—This is really a
simple matter. Procure a piano-case
and, having removed the piano, take to
pieces. You will now have more than
enough wood for your purpose, which
you may proceed to carry out in accord-
ance with your own ideas. Individual-
ism should be the dominant note in your
work. Having done it, varnish, and
invite your envious friends to view your
handiwork.
To make a Suit of Clothes.—Remove
old suit. Take a bale of cloth and cut
off bits and stitch them together until it
fits. Add as many pockets as your re-
quirements call for. Paste lining on
inside of suit and cut hole at top to
allow head to protrude. Many a good
suit has been spoiled by neglect of
this point. Complete with hat, boots
and Ascot tie; these had best be pur-
chased, and give a very dressy appear-
ance.
To prepare a Coat of Arms.-The
usual way to set about this task is to
send a cheque to the Pursuivant of Fees,
Family Herald's Office. This indeſati-
gable official will send a beautiful Coat
warranted to fit any person who does
not care to appear in plebeian shirt-
sleeves. You may, however, save ex-
pense by preparing the Coat yourself in
the following manner. Take a few art
lessons from a good ticket-writer, and
on some mill-board draw a shield. Em-
bellish this with suitable designs. I'or
instance, if your family is extremely old
(as no doubt is the case), draw a Flood;
this makes a very nice quartering. Other
effective designs, emblematic of your
chief attainments and characteristics, are
a case of fish-knives argent (athletic dis-
tinction), view of Boulogne (travel), en-
trance to local Polytechnic (the Arts),
Wimbledon Common (military prowess)
—and so on. Other themes will suggest
themselves as you go on. Finish off
with appropriate motto, such as Solvitur
Dorando, or Sapo Simianus togas mon
lavat. The general effect is very pleasing.
A useful Ireference Book.-Think of
as many words as you can beginning
with A, such as arguebus, Algernon
Ashton, “Answers,” and so on. There
are many others. Write them down
with suitable explanations, and proceed
in this manner through the alphabet.
Towards the end, your task will be ren-
dered surprisingly easy by the fact that
there are practically no words beginning
with X, Y, or Z. There is money in
this idea, for a reliable book of this
kind would sell well, and many pub-
lishers would be glad to consider your
MS. In any case you will have broken
the monotony of bridge-playing and
pantomimes.

I want a collar measuring 16 by 2%, and only one. I don't
care what reduction you make on half-a-dozen, I will not have
more than one. I see you are about to say that you are bring-

that I will not be persuaded, cajoled, or bullied into buying

to get out of your shop. I refuse to discuss the weather.

THE MOUSE.
I THINK this story is going to be an apologue, because I
have always intended to write an apologue, and something
seems to tell me that I shall manage to do it this time. Of
course I know that an apologue must have an application. In
the old-fashioned sort there was never any mistake about the
application. There couldn't possibly be two opinions as to
what the man was driving at ; and when you got to the end
of the story you were quite comfortable. “Aha,” you said
to yourself, “that's a nasty one for the Socialists, that bit
about the fox and the lion,” or, “I wonder what the House
of Lords will think about the crocodile and the swimmer; it's
a fairly nasty knock.” That, as I said, was the old-fashioned
sort. But there's a new kind that has come in recently.
It leaves you guessing. You can't quite make out whether
the writer is having a hit at the GERMAN EMPEROR or only
expressing some opinion or other about Miss CHRISTABEL
PANKHURST or BERNARD SHAW. I don't say my apologue is
going to be exactly of that kind, but it will be somewhere
near it. You'll be able to apply it to anybody you like
(or dislike, for the matter of that)—your coachman, your
chauffeur, your housemaid, your wife, or the Chairman of the
local branch of the Tariff Reform League. Anyhow, I may
as well begin, and you can decide the rest for yourself
later on.
There was once a mouse. I am not acquainted with its
family history, for I only saw it, so to speak, from the out-
side, but it seemed a very amiable little mouse, confident
and frisky, and as neat and quick as a mouse can be. It
lived somewhere in the hinterland of the wainscoting in the
dining-room, and sometimes, when the human family was at
breakfast or lunch, it would suddenly pop out and glide
along the floor, or even scale a side-table and dart about or
pause for a moment, as if it had remembered some very
important business that ought to be attended to... When
they saw it the children stopped talking and held their
breath, and then one of them would whisper, “There's our
dear little mouse,” and then with a quick flash the mouse
had scurried off under the old grandfather's clock that ticked
away for ever and ever so slowly and solemnly.
Now in this house there was a butler. His name was
Black, and he had once been a dragoon. At present he was a
very stout man, and you couldn't fancy him riding a horse,
except, perhaps, one of the huge horses which used to draw
the brewers' drays about the lanes. Mr. Black did not like
mice. He had heard about this particular mouse, and he
did what any other butler would have done. He decided
that the mouse ought to be caught, and he got two traps and
set them in the dining-room. This was in the morning
before breakfast. There was a piece of cheese in one trap ;
the other had a scrap of bacon. I shouldn't have dreamt of
touching either, but then mice are so different.
When the children came down to breakfast they imme-
diately saw the traps, and they ran to the Lady-of-the-house
and asked her what these funny machines meant. And the
Lady-of-the-house said they were meant for a mouse. If
the mouse got into one the trap would go snap and pin the
mouse down very tight. “But will the mouse like that?”
said the youngest child. And the Lady-of-the-house said
“No ; the mouse wouldn't like it at all; ” and she took the
two traps and sprung them, and then she opened the
window and threw them both into some thick bushes that
grew close by. And soon afterwards the mouse paid his
morning visit, and was well received as usual.
Now when the butler came in to clear away the breakfast
things he saw at once that the traps were gone. He looked
for them under side-boards and tables, thinking a mouse
might in its struggles have dragged each of them away;
but of course he didn't find them—only made himself hot
and angry. When he was angry his mind, curiously enough,
always turned to the boy in buttons, who was his household
slave. “That varmint of a boy,” he said to himself, “has
been up to his tricks again. He 's took orf the two traps to
have some game of his own with them.” Then he went into
the pantry, where he found the boy, and taxed him with
taking the traps and converting them to his own use. The
boy poured himself out in honest denials, but Mr. Black was
not to be mollified. He said it was a clear case, and he took
his old razor-strop from its hook and applied it not at all
lightly to the boy, who wriggled and protested, but all in
vain. “If they'd given you more of this sooner,” said
Mr. Black, “I shouldn't have to trouble with you now.”
In the meantime the old mother-cat left her six-weeks-old
kitten in the kitchen, and, proceeding along the passage,
made her way into the dining-room. She also had heard of
the mouse, and her decision had been the same as the
butler's, though she was accustomed to work without traps.
She paused on the hearthrug to arrange her toilet. Then she
crouched low, her eyes gleamed, she ſlicked her tail from side
to side and made a swift spring. There was a tiny squeak,
and the cat said, “I’ve got him,” or cat-words to that effect.
Listen, however. The kitten, a pertish youngster, had
issued from its basket and had, after an interval, followed its
mother into the passage, where it stopped to reconnoitre by
the pantry-door. It was at this moment that Mr. Black,
having finished his strop-swinging, came out flushed but
triumphant. He did not see the kitten; the kitten failed to
avoid him, and the butler's foot descended heavily on the
little animal. With a shrill squawk of terror and pain the
kitten extricated itself, and Mr. Black, impeded in his stride,
lurched to the ground. The cat heard the sound of her off-
spring's woe. She dropped the mouse and raced to help.
The mouse, more frightened than hurt, dragged itself to
safety, and the Lady-of-the-house, coming suddenly into the
passage for a consultation with the cook, found the butler
prostrate on the floor.
Now the only person who was thoroughly pleased was the
boy—and he had had the strop. The cat wasn't pleased ;
the kitten was far from pleased; the mouse had escaped, but
there was no pleasure about it; the butler had suffered in
his dignity; and the Lady-of-the-house was amused, but
puzzled, for she knew that the hole-in-the-carpet alleged by
the butler did not exist.
“Silly old fathead,” said the boy, “that'll teach him to
come his strop-games over me.”
OUR SWEEP.
Like other sweeps, when starting his career,
He early learned the motto of his trade;
He saw it at the entrance, well displayed,
“Abandon soap, all ye who enter here !”
And judging by his looks it would appear
He read the grim commandment and obeyed,
For still his face grows darker, shade by shade,
More manifestly sable, year by year.
He rises early and is moved to song,
This much he has in common with the lark;
Thereafter the resemblance isn't strong,
For any one who hears him may remark
His notes are few in number and belong
Midway between the bellow and the bark.

Navy Stores, Post Office, Bee-keeping,
River Police, &c., &c., thereby relieving
their parents of their presence at home,
and obtaining a huge start in the
Marathon race of life.
There is, of course, a sort of prelimi-
nary examination, but if you can spell
“accommodation ” and words like that
there is nothing to fear. Filling up the
Voting Coupons is the principal thing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DISCIPLINE FOR SERVANTS.
DEAR Mamma's plan for disciplining
her servants was not a success. It was
a good plan, but we never had the
proper kind of servant.
The idea came to Mamma when first
the new Workmen's Compensation Act
came into operation. She took out a
policy against July 1st, and said it was
a splendid opportunity to begin an
entirely new régime in kitchen control.
Up to then, as dear Mamma said
when outlining the scheme, she had no
hold over the servants—no way of
punishing them. Her plan was a com-
bined system of punishments and re-
wards. Each servant, in addition to
her regular wages, was to receive—if
entitled thereto, as Mamma said—five
shillings a month Conduct Money.
Every time a maid incurred Mamma's
displeasure a small fine would be in-
flicted and deducted from the five
shillings.
Mamma was most enthusiastic about
it. She went to the stationer's and
bought a little note-book bound in red
leather. On the cover she had stamped
in gold lettering:
CoNDUCT REGISTER.
At the head of the first page was printed
Cook-GENERAL,
FINEs.
And halfway through the book
House-PARLouRMAID.
FINEs.
Two new servants came in just then,
and dear Mamma explained the system
to them and showed them the book.
They were very pleased, and the cook-
general told Mamma it would “fairly
keep her on the 'op.” Though rather
vulgarly put, that, as dear Mamma said,
was the right sentiment, and she ex-
pressed the belief that her servant
troubles were at last at an end.
A rough scale of fines was agreed
upon-one penny, for example, for each
minute late. Papa said that was a bit
steep, but dear Mamma said: “If
discipline is not discipline, what is it?”
Papa said: “I leave it to you, partner,”
and went to bed. This was the first
night of the new régime.
The servants overslept themselves next
morning and came down an hour late.
Dear Mamma was very distressed
about it. You see, sixty minutes at a
penny a minute is five shillings, and
there was the whole Conduct Money
gone at one fell swoop. A conference
was held in the kitchen, and dear
Mamma, on emerging, announced that
the iron rod of discipline had been
temporarily relaxed. She had most
kindly agreed to overlook the offence, and
a fresh start was to be made.
That was at half-past nine.
At a quarter to twelve, while running
blithely down - stairs, dear Mamma
put her foot on the dustpan, carried
away a rack of Zulu assegais in a wild
clutch to save herself, and sat down very
abruptly indeed.
There is no need to repeat what she
said to the house-parlourmaid, but she
ended up by saying, “And your whole
five shillings is gone—Gone ! understand
that clearly 1"
If you will believe me, the girl went
upstairs, put on her hat and jacket, and
walked straight out of the house !
Rather to dear Mamma's surprise—for
it is her experience that servants always
combine together against the mistress–
the cook-general quite took her part over
this unfortunate incident. She said that
Mamma was well rid of the house-
parlourmaid, because the girl had been
very rude behind dear Mamma's back
about her good conduct money, and had
said she would demand it at the end of
the month whether she earned it or not.
The cook-general went on to say that for
her part she would much better appre-
ciate the scheme if Mamma would give
her her five shillings now. She said it
would seem much more like a reprimand
to her if she actually had to hand over a
fine than if she were deprived of money
she had never so much as seen.
Partly because there seemed some-
thing in this theory, and partly because
she was afraid the cook-general might
object to being single - handed, dear
Mamma agreed, and gave the five-
shillings—also permission to pop out
and post a letter to a friend who might
be willing to take the vacant situation.
“The girl is a treasure,” said dear
Mamma, as she watched her turn the
corner with the letter in her hand.
At half-past eleven that night two
policemen brought her to the house
quite incapable. It was most wretched.
Of course we could not have her in, and
she was taken to the police-station.
We had never lost two servants quite
so quickly before, and Papa said it was
all through the Conduct Money scheme,
which hurt dear Mamma very much.
She said that with such wretched ser-
vants it had not had a fair trial, and
when the next maids came in she ex-
plained everything to them and started
it again.
At the end of the month fourpence
was due to the cook-general and a penny
to the house-parlourmaid. They were
very rude about it, and actually refused
to take their rewards. Dear Mamma,
however, talked them over, carried for-
ward the fourpence and the penny, and
they promised they would set them-
selves not to lose a farthing during the
coming month.
Dear Mamma had hardly left the
kitchen when the cook-general dropped
and broke a plate.
Mamma turned back. “Ah, Mary,
Mary,” she said with a kind smile,
picking up the conduct-register, “that's
threepence.” -
“Ho! is it? Well, that's sixpence,”
said the girl, and deliberately dashed a
second plate on the floor
The fine for rudeness was a shilling,
but dear Mamma thought it best not to
enter it just then. The way in which
things mounted up after that was extra-
ordinary. Dear Mamma just entered
them as they came, but in adding them
up she found to her horror that the
cook-general owed her £1 3s. 7d., and
the house - parlourmaid owed her
19s. 11}d.
It was while dear Mamma was ex-
plaining this to Papa and begging him
for once in his life to go in and speak
to the servants that there came from the
kitchen a loud crash followed by terrific
SCTeams.
We rushed in, and there was the cook-
general executing a fascinating little
dance on one leg round and round the
table. She collapsed on a chair pre-
sently, and then it appeared that she
had upset the kettle and scalded her
foot. The doctor said it was trifling,
but she said that a very similar shock,
only not quite so bad, had killed her
aunt, and that for months and months
the mere sight of a kettle would set her
all of a tremble.
We sent her home, and then the young
man from the insurance company, after
interviewing her, came to see us. Dear
Mamma and I watched him go jauntily
down the drive, and then Papa came in.
Papa's lips were flecked with foam. He
could hardly speak.
“Whatever is it?”
cried.
“It's this Conduct Money of yours,”
stormed Papa, using a regrettable adjec-
tive. “On the policy I said the girl's
wages were £1 10s, a month, but she
tells the Company she was receiving
£1 15s., and the Company is going to
repudiate the claim Of all the ! ”
and so on.
Our case comes on next week. Dear
Mamma is living with her mother and
Papa is preparing to file his petition in
Bankruptcy.

has been made to “go" in this way.
From The New Reformer (Madras):—
“At such times of self-renunciation in our
own life, it is only supreme renunciation that
appeals to us; and anything short of that, we
feel, would be an inadequate support and stay
for the soul. George Eliot realised this fact,
and in the ‘Milk on the Floor, where life goes
very hard with her heroine, and all the world
seems against her, the novel represents Maggie
Tulliver as turning . . .”
A new reform indeed ; and what a mess
it makes of the old index joke, “Mill on

(With acknowledgments to the ingenious Office

Quite a number of successful plays, and
a few failures, too, have had “an " in

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-My poor, dear Papa

he usually does early in the year. But

from a second-hand shop, and the iron-
monger's boy came with a truckful of
barbed wire. All the afternoon Papa
made Norman and Peter help him to
hammer stakes in the lawns and flower-
beds round the house, while Phyllis and
I were told to look at the gun and try
to master its mechanism—for even the
girls, he said, had a part to play. The
gun was very rusty and wouldn't work,

To calloneself “APatriot,”
as the author of An English-
man's Home does, is not, by
the way, a new departure.
There have been Patriots
before. A book entitled This
Little Isle, published in 1835,
a copy of which lies before
the writer, is attributed to
“a patriot,” and it is gene-
rally understood that the
poet CLOSE once wrote a
pamphlet under that inte-
resting pseudonym. The
great days for jokes on the
subject are, however, over;
but there was a time when
every disturbance in Ireland
was wittily called a Pat
riot. * +

The author of An English-
man's Home has not the
same reasons for shunning
publicity as had JoHN Home,
the author of the play which
gave rise to the patriotic
ejaculation, “Whaur's your
WULLIE SHAKSPERE noo?”
who might be called the
Scotsman's Home. Men who
take pseudonyms have
various reasons for doing
so; not the least of which
is that they do not want
to be known. But “A

ing out anything. And the
two boys, besides hammer-
ing their thumbs, got
muddy and hot and cross.
The next morning Papa
woke the boys at six, and
made them go out on to the
lawn to drill. Norman had
the gun, and Peter a broom-
stick, because he is so little.
They came in to breakfast
crosser than ever. In the
evening they had to take
the barbed wire and stretch
it between the stakes—con-
structing entanglements,
Papa called it. It was left
out all night, and next
morning, after drill, they
took it all in again, only to
repeat the thing all over
again at night. That has
gone on ever since, and their
clothes and hands are in a
fearful state because of the
spikes. Norman is so cross
because Papa won't let him ||
have any cartridges until ||
he is sixteen, and says that
for the present he must
practise putting the gun to
his shoulder and aiming. -
Every now and again Papa
takes Phyllis and me into a
corner, and says we must be
brave, and show stout hearts,
and stand by the men to
help them all we can. He has
made us sleep in the back
attic, which he calls the
West Watch-tower, where,

The success of An English-
man's Home cannot fail to recall
to the minds of many of our readers
the furore caused a few years ago by
the publication of a not dissimilarly-
entitled work, An Englishwoman's
Love Letters. That, too, by a strange
coincidence, was anonymous, but it
turned out to be the work, not of a
major in the Army, but a gentleman of
letters. The coincidence goes further
than at first sight one would think, for
what is an Englishman's home but
his house? and the author of An Eng-
lishwoman's Love Letters was a Mr.

instead he told us that an Englishman's
house was his castle, and that while
we had neither moat nor drawbridge
we must see to it that our castle
was defended from the invader. He was
awfully solemn, and added that at least
it should be said of his house that it
was defended—to the death, if need be;
and that made Phyllis cry.
We soon discovered that Papa thought
that the house was about to be sur-
rounded by foreign soldiers. I don't
know where he got it from—I could see
nothing about it in the paper. Instead
of going to the City he went up to the

tise watching. Phyllis gets so
frightened, she can't sleep. And on
Saturday, being a half-holiday, we had
barricading practice, which meant
dragging the furniture across all the
doors and windows, and piling it up as
high as we could.
Mamma looks so anxious and puzzled
about it all. What do you think it
means? Is it serious, and will it last,
do you think?
Yours affectionately,

SoME of our contemporaries, taking
compassion on the literary aspirant in

RoRERT BURNs.—There is no demand Study the works of the late Guy,
for the Scotch dialect poem: even the
Scotch dialect story has gone out of
fashion. Your only chance of success
would be to have a few of your efforts
set to music, and then forward them to
your countryman, HARRY LAUDER, in the
hope of his bringing them out at the
Halls. You seem to have a leaning
towards sentimental verse: you might
develop this vein, taking as a model In

certain facility in turn-
ing out blank verse, but
your poem Paradise
Lost is insufferably long,
and full of wearisome
classical allusions. We
feel sure that no editor
would accept it. And
yet there are ideas in
the poem. You might,
we think, have made a
good deal more of
Adam's first meeting
with Eve. The piece,
too, would be greatly
improved by the use of
suitable headlines, such
as

Woman.
Was Eve a Suffra-
gette? (N.B.-This
last headline,
though irrelevant
to the poem, would
be sure to prick the .
public attention in
these troublous
days, and we cannot
too strongly insist
that the only test
of a work is its sell-
ing capacity. This
is a point too often
overlooked by be-
ginners like your-
self.)

PERCY B. SHELLEY.—Your lines are

The public does not want Laments:
you should give them something in the
style of Put me among the Girls.
You would perhaps do better in prose.

practised hand would be ashamed, and
we have little doubt that, if you persevere,
you will in time write stuff good enough
for the provincial stage. What we
especially like about this little effort is
that there is plenty of blood in it. We
suggest that you cut out all the soli-
loquies, and tone the language up
more.
FRANCIS BACON.—The public does not
read essays. If you aspire to be a
leading-article writer, you must acquire
a snappier style. No, we do not allow
that anyone can be the author of another
man's plays. To be the author of a
work, one must have written it oneself.
OLIVER GoLDSMITH. – Your story The

TYING THE WHITE TIE.
(BY THE Colonel.)
MoRE matches, I suppose, are won and
lost through correct or faulty manipula-
tion of the neckwear than through
success or failure in any other depart-
ment of the costume; and in response
to numerous appeals from my readers,
I have drawn up some rules which, with
a little practice, should enable the ordi-
nary amateur to obtain a fair modicum
of proficiency in this difficult stroke.
Choice of Implement.—Select a tie
with a fairly whippy shaft (the stiff kind
supplied by so many laundries are im-
possible for a beginner) and a large
head; you may please yourself as to the
amount of bulge, but in any case the
blade should be capable of being passed
through a two-inch ring.
The Stance.—Plant both feet firmly
on the floor in front of the mirror (which
should be full length), turn the toes
slightly inward, loosen the knees, and
let the whole body be as supple as
possible.
The Up-swing.—Tie a double slip-knot
and take the left-hand end slowly back-
wards over the right shoulder, keeping
your eye firmly fixed on the underneath
side of the head of the collar-stud, and
your hands well away from the body;
at the top of the swing the blade of the
tie should be parallel with the ground,
and one foot slightly lifted. Always
remember that what the up-swing has
been, the down-swing will be, and never
lose sight of the stud.
The Down-swing. —Keeping the left
shoulder slightly tucked in, throw both
arms away, loop the two ends, knot
firmly, and come well through with the
body. If you have followed my instruc-
tions carefully a beautifully long straight
cravat will be the result, probably half-
way to the pin. Never mind a few
failures. Rosin the hands well, alter
the stance a little, re-adjust the links,
and start again.
Territorial Forethought.

bers of the detachment to a supper at the Lyn
Walley Hotel; dress, uniform, without belts.”--

THE PAGEANT MASTER
SPEAKS.
MR. PUNCH's Pageant having come to
a close, he takes this opportunity of
thanking his many friends for assisting,
not only by their loans of articles of
interest, but also by their presence in
such numbers, in making the Exhibition
so memorably successful.
“Exmouth are due to receive a visit from
Exmouth, but though a stubborn game is
assured, if Exmouth can reproduce the form
they displayed against Albion last Saturday,
there should be no doubt as to which way
victory will go.”—Western Morning News.
In spite of this, however, we are inclined
to pin our faith to Exmouth.
The following testimonial is circulated
by an Indian sports stores, and has led,
we understand, to a huge increase of
business:—
“Dear Sirs, The balls were ordinary and I
think they were not much below their class for
the price paid for them. The Solution was not
very bad either.”

GLASS WITH CARE.
THIS is the story of how I sent some
real German glass from Berlin to Eng-
land through the German parcels post.
It doesn't sound exciting. But wait.
It started with a letter from my
sister.
“. . . And, oh! I have heard they
make very good glass in Germany, and
now while you are in Berlin you might
get me some real German ware to add to
my collection . . . the real bottle-green,
mind.”
So, of course, I had to. There was a
shop in the Leipzigerstrasse that had
“January Sale on account of Death,” in
the window, so I went there, secured an
assistant, and she showed me some
glass.
“Is it expensive 2 ” I asked.
“Oh! yes, very expensive. For the
Mister sees it is the very best glass.”
“I wouldn't mind if you showed me
something a little cheaper, you know,”
I hinted.
“And yet the Mister is an English-
man, nicht wahr 7” Her opinion of our
race sank considerably. But she showed
Ine SOme more.
The price was certainly less than the
first, and there were plenty of people
buying it; and as I know nothing about
glass I decided to have some too.
“I will take a cup and saucer, and a
glass,” I said.
“Pay at the desk, please.”
It was easy enough to pay at the
desk, but quite a different matter to get
one's goods afterwards. Behind the
delivery counter five men—in uniform,
of course—were wrapping up and
handing the articles that had been sold
to an excited crowd struggling in
front of them. In the course of time I
was forced by pressure from behind
against the counter, and there I held on
and watched. It was most interesting,
especially as a mathematical exercise.
On an average seven articles were handed
in to the men every ten seconds; on an
average each man handed one article
out every ten seconds. Thus in an hour's
time there would be 720 people in front
of this counter waiting for their pur-
chases. It was now eleven, the shop
closed at eight; so at closing time there
would be 6,480 people waiting. Iteally
it was extremely interesting. Now,
allowing that the sale lasted thirty days
—but here one of the men snatched
the receipt from my hand, wrapped the
cup and the saucer and the glass up in
a piece of tissue-paper and flung them
into my arms. My hold on the counter
being loosened the lady behind, whose
resolution had thrust me into my advan-
tageous position, flung me out and
occupied it herself.
So that was all right. All I had to
do now was to get a box, put the glass
in, and post it. It sounded easy, but in
Germany one never knows. . . . I went
into one of the large Warenhause, where
they sell everything from a white
elephant to a cardboard-box—no, not to
a cardboard-box, for I asked the door-
keeper after I had sought the right
department in vain, and it appeared
they did not sell such things.
“. . . But if the Mister buys some-
thing, he will be given a cardboard-box,”
he ended magnificently.
So I went into the toy department and
bought a doll which I didn't really
º just then, and with it the necessary
OX.
And now I only had to post it. Only!
I went into a post-office. They are
annoying things, German post-offices,
for there are a lot of little windows, each
for a different purpose, and you have
to find out which is the window you
Want.
But this time I discovered the parcels
receiving window at once. There was a
nasty-looking man behind it—the sort
of man who would score off you if he
could.
“I want to send this to England,”
I said.
“What is it?” he snapped.
“Samples without value,” said I.
Most parcels you send to England are
that, and if they are not, they are——
But you shall hear.
He took it somewhere into the back
of his den, and after a little while
returned and barked, “No, it's not.”
“Then it's a packet of value,” I said.
(That was what I was going to tell you
just now.)
“No, it's not,” he barked again.
“Oh, very well, then you have me. I
give it up. Call it what you like, but
send it to England.”
“Ausgeschlossen,” said he, and shut
his window with a bang. I knew what
ausgeschlossen meant. It means you
can't smoke a pipe in a smoking car-
riage. It means you can't go into a
free museum without fetching a free
ticket from a place three-quarters of a
mile away. It means you can't walk on
the left-hand side of the pavement even
when it's the shop side and you want to
look at the shops; or it means you can't
walk on the left-hand side of the pave-
ment even when it isn't the shop side
and you don't want to look at the shops.
Ausgeschlossen means a lot of things
like that. So I didn't try to fish him
out of his lair again. I could see he
had taken a dislike to my parcel from
the first. I resolved to work it off on
someone who could view it with an open
mind.
At the next post-office the parcels
department was fronted completely by
glass, and one could see everything that
went on behind. There was rather a
nice old man at the window. That is,
he looked nice.
“I want to send this to England. It's
samples without value,” I said.
He took it and weighed it, and had a
chat with another man there about it,
and then he came back and said, “I’m
sorry; it's not.”
So he had found it out, too.
“Then it's a package of value.”
“No, it isn't that either.”
“Well, anyhow, I want to send it to
England.”
“Just so. Now take my advice, my
friend,” he said. (I translate freely
from the German. I have been doing
that all along, you know.) “You are
young, and you are an Englishman, and
you are not equal to tackling the German
Postal Regulations by yourself. You
take it back to the shop where you
bought it.”
“Oh, I can't do that,” I said, and
looked at my watch. “At the present
moment there are something like fifteen
hundred people waiting to be attended
to in that shop.”
“Well, then, take it to any German
friend and persuade him to help you;
but if you rely merely on yourself you
will never get rid of that parcel.”
So I took it to my tobacconist, and he
explained that a sample without value
had to be under five hundred grammes,
which my parcel was not; and a Wert-
packet had to be in a wooden or stout
cardboard box, sealed at the ends, which
my parcel again was not. So far as the
German post-office was concerned it was
nothing, it was an impossibility.
Well, between us we packed each
thing in a separate cigar-box, for he
hadn't anything big enough to hold
them all, wrapped them up, addressed
them and sealed them. Then I took
my three packages back to the old man.
“Now they are packages of value,”
I said.
He took them in and weighed them.
“I’m awfully sorry to disappoint you,
but they are not,” he said.
“Why on earth not?”
“Because they only weigh four hun-
dred grammes each, and a Wertpacket
has to weigh five.”
It is an Englishman's boast that he
never knows when he is beaten. I took
those three boxes into a gunsmith's next
door to the post-office.
“I want three hundred grammes of
lead shot in three separate lots of one
hundred each,” I said.
The gunsmith, fearing the worst,
helped to repack my parcels with a
combination of nervousness and kindly
care that was almost touching.
I took them back to the post-office in
triumph.
“Now they are all right,” I said.

ONDON CHARIVARI. [FEBRUARY 10, 1909.
oUR BookING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
As a rule the republication of political speeches is not a
º enterprise either for the publisher or the reader.
OSEPH Cowen, for some time Member for Newcastle, was an
exceptional man, and exception is created in the case of his
utterances on public affairs. His Speeches (LONG MANs), edited
by his daughter, deal with the stirring events dating from
the Bulgarian Atrocities of 1876 to the General Election of
1885, the last great triumph of Liberalism at the polls under
the leadership of Mr. GLADSTONE. Mr. Cowen accurately
described his position in the political world when, addressing
his constituents in the Town Hall, Newcastle, twenty-nine
years ago, he said, “I am not a conventional adherent to the
fashionable Liberalism of the hour, but I am a lifelong Radi-
cal by conviction, sympathy, training and taste.” Above all
things he was what is to-day known as an Imperialist. Some
of his finest speeches harped on the theme of the Empire.
Amongst non-official Members of the House of Commons he
was the last survivor
(MACMILLAN) is a collection of stories of which all but the first
deal with minor psychological problems of a kind that only
good craftsmen can hope to make interesting. The name-
piece, which is rather more pretentious, and has a mediaeval
legend for subject, is written with a delicate simplicity that
reminds me a little of some of ANATOLE FRANCE's stories in
L’Etui de Nacre. The wild woman had been expelled from
a convent for the unpardonable sin of secret ablutions (she
used to steal out at night and bathe in a marble tank), and
so she came to live in a cave near that of a recluse who had
long ago subdued his only sinful temptation, that of writing
sacred verse. The tragedy occurred when the hermit dis-
covered that his friend had not, after all, mortified her vanity,
but occasionally took a bath in the river. The remaining
studies mostly deal with matters of conscience (either artistic
or pecuniary) among widely differing American types, and
only one (perhaps the least successful) with the conventional
theme of romance. It is hard to believe that a quite ordinary
young Englishman could have deluded the wife of an
American professor into supposing he was in love with her,
merely in order to use the pretext of their flirtation as a reason
of the small tribe of
orators. He did not often
speak, but he never
joined in debate with-
out lifting it alike in
spirit and in eloquence
to the highest level.
One of his most memo-
rable efforts, deeply
moving a crowded
House, was his speech
on the Bill by which
DisrAELI conferred upon
his Royal Mistress the
title Empress of India.
This does not appear in
the present volume, but
may not be omitted from
the complete edition of
his speeches promised
by Miss JANE Cowen.
CATCHIN' 'Is DEATH For
The Story of Virginia
Perfect(METHUEN) can be -
divided into two parts, before and after the death of R. Perfect
“Working Jeweller. Clocks and Watches repaired on the
remises,”) Concerning Perfect there is little to say except
that he lived at 17, Madrigal Street, Clerkenwell, and was
entirely unworthy of his name. His philanderings, however,
gave Virginia ample opportunities to display forbearance,
and I was beginning to think that she was far too patient a
wife, when an accident made her a widow. Up to this point
I feel that Miss PEGGY WEBLING has drawn an almost un-
naturally faultless heroine. But afterwards I have no com-
plaint to make. Removed from the uncongenial atmosphere
of Clerkenwell to that of Bohemian London, Virginia gains
in power without losing a jot of her simple purity, and both
in her devotion to Keble and in her struggle for daily bread
she is most engaging. The minor characters (artists and
artisans) have been drawn with scrupulous care, and among
them all I give my whole-hearted allegiance to Virginia's
quaint, imperturbable boy—a sculptor in the bud. Miss
WEBLING is to be congratulated upon a book which is at
once fragrant and unconventional.

so lightly and easily that some readers may resent the tone
of the later chapters; but however that may be, Mr. Shore's
people have interested me considerably. They ring true;
they act and speak naturally. And if the fate of the heroine
seems rather forced at the end, it is something to be thankful
for that a story which in cruder hands might have left an
unpleasant taste behind is both readable and enjoyable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BUDGET LETTER.
DEAR LLOYD-GEORGE,-You will be glad
to hear that I have just sent along my
little contribution to your fund. Don't
fritter it away in Dreadnoughts—spend
it wisely and cautiously; you might
buy one Old Age Pension with it and
still have a trifle over for the Terri-
torials. I won't tell you exactly what
you would have over because you might
find that I had paid too much, which
would break my heart; or that I hadn't
paid enough, which would break me
altogether. All I say is, Be careful.
Don't be led away into riotous extrava-
gance, and don't think, because I have
done this for you, that Lord Rothschild
and Mr. ANDREW CARNEGIE are going to
do as much. r - - - -
Now, my dear LLoyd-GEORGE (excuse
the familiarity, but I expect to owe you
more next year than I shall ever be able
to repay), I hear that you have got to
raise another twenty millions, and that
you don't quite know how to do it. Of
course twenty millions seems a small
sum to me, but I can understand that
to you it is something of a problem. I
wonder if I can give you a few helpful
suggestions. Anyhow, they are meant
kindly.
I saw in the papers the other day an
article on “Simplified Spelling”—a de-
lightful subject. In the new era, you
know, instead of spelling a word like
“desiccated ” with two “sics” we shall
spell it somehow else—I don't know
how for the moment, but at least it will
be much easier. Well, this method is
going to save time and raw material;
time because you won't have to stop and
think, and raw material because most of
the words will be shorter and won't
want so much paper. An eminent statis-
tician calculated in this article that if it
is adopted all over England (by which
I take him to include Scotland and
Ireland), there will be a saving in the
year of time and material equal to—
what do you think? — twenty million
pounds !
Now, my dear old soul, what more do
you want? There's your money. Make
the simplified spelling compulsory, and
you rake in the twenty million. Where
you rake it in from I don't quite know.
Under the new law I should have begun
this letter “Dere Loyd-Jorge,” but I am
sadly afraid that I should have squan-
dered the extra time in sleep and used
the extra paper to light my pipe. But
then I can never understand these
economic statisticians. I read a little
time ago that in the last fog London
lost seven million pounds; well, I know,
speaking for myself alone, that I lost
thirteen-and-sixpence and a tie-pin, and
they would have pinched my watch as
well, only I had left it at home; but the
statistician didn't make any reference
to that at all. No, he said that one shop
in Regent Street had lost a thousand
pounds because the fog had prevented
Lady Rosenstein from going out and
buying a tiara; and another had lost a
penny because you and I hadn't bought
our Westminster. He almost seemed to
forget that you and I had kept our
coppers, and were going to spend them
the next day.
And so, perhaps, there may not be so
much in the simplified spelling scheme.
Let's try another. -
The Government, it is my firm opinion,
gives too much away. It has been
giving licences away up till now, and if
it is really going to sell them next year it
will have begun none too soon. But think
what a lot it might do in this direction.
Take anything—take margarine. I have
never (intentionally) dallied much with
margarine, but I believe it has to be
inspected and stamped and so on by the
Government. But suppose that, instead
of being merely passed as bearable, it
were actively recommended. Suppose
it were stamped, “As spread by Mr.
LULU HARCOURT, who finds it tasty,” or,
“Lord ALTHORP loves it "2 How gladly
would tradesmen pay to have their
wares so registered.
I hope I'm helping you. Now I'm
going to weigh in with another sugges-
tion. What is it which is inflicted upon
us several times every day and which
none of us ever wanted once? (Even if
you answer this correctly there is no
free scholarship). Leading articles.
Put a tax on leaders and you will benefit
humanity. Teally the tax would only
need to go on certain words—Scope,
Drastic and Inalienable, and the idea
could then be extended so as to reach
novelists and others. A slight duty on
Authentic would bring in a million
or so from Mr. E. F. BENSON; one
on Athwart another million from Mr.
WELLs. I take the following extract
from a report of one of Mr. AUSTEN
CHAMBERLAIN's recent speeches :—“It
was a Government of terminological
inexactitudes. (Laughter.)” . A man
who can say a thing like that, just three
years late, and an audience which can
laugh at it, should be heavily fined.
Duty would have to be paid on all such
outworn phrases.
A tax on beards has been suggested
many times; the only point of debate
is the amount of such a tax. I have just
worked it out for you as follows:–
The average man (this doesn't mean
you or me) works 1,500 hours a
year. If he has to shave every day he
works another two hours a week—say
100 hours a year. The bearded man
has that extra 100 hours for financially,
as opposed to aesthetically, remunerative
work, and therefore makes one-fifteenth
more money per annum. Hence if one-
sixteenth of this increased income were
extracted from him he would be brought
down to the level of the clean-shaven
man. In other words, beards should be
tazed one-and-threepence in the pound.
I hope that is clear and helpful.
I have some more ideas for you, but
perhaps the time is hardly ripe for them;
they are a little too revolutionary. One
was that members of both Houses should
pay £600 a year for the privilege of
making laws. The Commons might get
the money from their constituencies
whose views they represent; the Lords,
representing nobody, would of course
have to find the money themselves.
Another suggestion was that married
men should be taxed. A third—that
double-barrelled names should pay duty
—will be more kindly made, my dear
GEORGE, to your successor. . .
But by now you have nearly all the
money you want. Calculating it roughly,
indeed, I find that I have suggested to
you the means for finding £19,999,999
19s. 11d. My last, idea is that there
should be a tax, pro rata, on all futile
suggestions made to the CHANCELLOR OF
THE ExchEQUER. I enclose a penny stamp,
and remain, *

DUPLICITIES.

Sir Dashwood Holmby, K.C.M.G., to Hugo
Leigh, of the Treasury.
January 3.
DEAR OLD MAN,+There is to be a
dinner to Bankes on the 26th, at the
Belvoir Hotel. I hope you can be there.
He is a silly ass, of course, and per-
sonally I bar him a good deal, but one
can't very well stay away without its
looking like an intentional slight; and
as a matter of fact I am getting the
wretched thing up. You will come,
won't you? It will be a good dinner
anyway. D. H.
P.S.—Dunsmore will make the speech
of the evening.
II
Hugo Leigh to Sir Dashwood Holmby.
January 5.
MY DEAR DASH,-If you can guarantee
the dinner I will come, but I don't much
care for the Belvoir cooking. The
flavour is abstracted somewhere en route,
and they know nothing about the tem-
perature of claret. As for old Bankes, I
not only dislike him, but I distrust him,
which is worse. He is a tuft-hunter and
a minx. However, the Department must
hold together, I suppose, and since he's
leaving us we may as well be decent.
I am glad you got Dunsmore. He is
always fluent and amusing, and amia-
bility and lying come easy to him.
Yours, H. L.

Lord Dunsmore was to have proposed
my health, but owing to the sudden
illness of Lady Dunsmore (a very charm-
attending at all. Another Treasury man,
Hugo Leigh, whom you have no doubt
heard of, an authority on netsukes and
one of our best tennis players, took his
place. I had always thought that Leigh
disliked me, but one can make strange
mistakes in that way. His remarks were
charming. He touched on every side of
my career, the literary as well as the
administrative, and even quoted a stanza
from my “Pearl Fishers.”

Hilary Bankes to Sir Dashwood Holmby.
January 26.
MY DEAR Holmby, I cannot go to bed
after this, to me, most memorable night
without thanking you for all you have
done, and expressing the sympathy that
Mrs. Bankes and I have for you in your
illness, and also saying how very
felicitous and flattering were Leigh's
remarks on my poor character and
career. I had no notion that he felt so
warmly towards me.
Again thanking you and wishing you
a speedy recovery,
I am, very sincerely yours,
HILARY BANKES.

January 27.
MY DEAR LEIGH,-The kindness of
your speech quite overcame me, and I
fear I did not succeed in the least in
conveying my real feelings to you last
evening. Pray accept my deep gratitude.
It will give Mrs. Bankes and myself great
pleasure if you will dine with us on the
30th at eight o'clock. There will be only
two or three picked guests besides your-
self. Yours very sincerely,

My DEAR LEIGH,-Mrs. Bankes and I
are extremely sorry that you are engaged
on the 30th. She is so very anxious to
meet you that I am emboldened to name
two other dates, February the 5th and
the 8th, on one of which we are hoping
you will be free. On either might you
will find some very nice people here,
carefully chosen, to meet you.

January 30.
MY DEAR DASH,-You have done for
me for ever. After trying for years to
lead a clean life and say what I mean, I
am now a public liar, all through your
trickery and machinations; and what
is worse, I have Bankes as firmly
fixed on my back as Sinbad's Old Man
of the Sea. I am become his dearest
friend. Every post brings me a letter
inviting me to dinner, and—meanest
trick of all—mentioning more than one
date, so that I shall have to go at last.
There will be a dedication to me in a
few days for certain. All his grand-
children, if he has any, are to be named
Hugo. Why, oh why, can't we tell the
truth 2 Your miserable enemy,

RAMBLING.
ALFRED pronounced himself entranced
with the project. It was, of course, not
a project at all, but a disease, and Alfred
had sickened for it.
I remarked that walking (old style)
had always an especial charm for me,
but Alfred said at once that this was
not walking, but Rambling. I believe
that my walking was Rambling—just
that, and that Alfred's Rambling was
mere walking—a dull business—but it
was not one of the times when he listens.
He bent the binding of the book back
and placed it before me.
The requirements forcorrect Rambling
(not walking) were quite moderate and
were clearly set down. The Rambler
was recommended to provide himself
with a pair of stout boots; a half-a-
crown; the Historical Companion to the
Series, cloth, One Shilling; and the
Special Map, paper, One Shilling.
“Only sixpence left,” I remarked,
trying to put a cheerful face on things;
but Alfred reproved me. We might
almost have been surveyors, so serious
was his attitude to the project.
However, despite my misgivings, it
was with a light heart that I eventually
walked out of the station with my friend
into the early promise of a wintry morn-
ing. The book that had bulged his
pocket was produced, and we agreed it
would perhaps facilitate matters if we
tore out the leaf containing the Explana-
tion of the Map, and kept it handy for
reference. I set myself to master it.

could ingeniously be made of the hands
of one's watch adjusted according to the
position of the sun. This was Rambling.
But Ramble No. Seven was our con-
cern, and first we had to follow the road,
climb a stile upon the left, and pursue
the path for a quarter of a mile. Alfred
went first, holding the Guide in one
hand and the fluttering Map in the
other, and I followed, firmly graspin

the Explanation and the Historical Com-
panion. We kept to the winding ribbon
of path, not daring to look unto the
right or left for fear we should miss the
spot where a little twiddle, like a worm
trying to look over its shoulder, marked
(on the Map, not on the path) an alter-
native way which we had decided to take.
We ascertained its position exactly, but
saw no sign. I took the Map from
Alfred's reluctant hand for a closer in-
spection, and it was later on that I dis-
covered that we had been deceived by a
fragment of tobacco ash, and I had not
the heart to tell him.
Luckily at this time a man in a
Norfolk suit approached us along the
path. In every line of his comfortable
figure reposed the quiet content of the
country-side, and we asked him with
confidence to direct us. He was ex-
ceedingly kind, and offered us minute
directions.
If we retraced our steps, he told us,
we should presently climb a stile and
reach the main road and the station.
We thanked him, of course, but implored
him to direct us in the way from which
he had come. Strangely enough he
seemed to know nothing of it; he shook
his head and refused even for one
moment to glance back at it, but ever
pointed onward in the road he (and
apparently all) must take. He did not
see me lightly tap my forehead, but as
he passed on we noticed a little book
reposing in the hand (the one that
wasn’t pointing onward) behind his
back.
“For Ramble No. Seven (reversed)
see p. 35.”
So we pressed along the path we
were on and at length gained a hill-
brow (where a friend tells me there is
an entrancing view), and stopped to
adjust our course to our c. We
were to bear to the left into a lane and
continue until “two stately elms” were
reached. As we entered the “----.”
we had to step aside for a jolly carter
and his team and a creaking load of
timber. 'Tis an honest rural sight, and
as we stood and watched it in the
dancing light our spirits revived and
we felt the better for it. Thrusting the
Historical Companion into my pocket,
I linked my arm in my friend's and we
followed the rustic lane. But soon we

were no stately elms to be seen. Upon
rising ground it was impossible for even
two paltry little trees to be anywhere at
hand without our suspecting it. A
hardy son of the soil approached
whistling, but one shrinks from ad-
mitting that one is searching for two
gigantic trees.
Alfred knew I was watching him.
He frowned a little and read the passage
aloud two or three times. Some pert
little cloudlets romped by together
above us. I thought one of them
smiled, and a light broke in upon me.
“Alfred,” I said with conviction,
“the jolly carter has taken our trees.”
For the rest of the day we just walked
about in any direction that occurred
to us. But that is not Rambling.
“In seven visits to the table yesterday after-
noon Stevenson scored the 749 points to take
him to the schedule, his average therefore
working out at the minutest fraction below 107

view of short division.
THE ARTFUL DODGER.
SLACK and half impotent he stood,
Yet with alert observing eyes;
The opportunity was good,
He snatched the guarded prize.
Across the level field he broke
Light-footed, sound of wind and limb,
Aghast, the startled crowd awoke,
And howled at sight of him.
Ho doubled through the hue and cry
With feet that swerve but never slip,
The treasure money could not buy
Held tight within his grip.
Wild apparitions breathing fast
With arms outstretched to check his
flight
Rushed at him, yet he flickered past
And spread them left and right.
Then while the crowd their thunder
roared
Like crash of breakers on our coasts,
He also came to ground, and scored
A try between the posts.

We've studied in the L.C.C.
Continuation Schools.
We've proofs to show how much we know,
Then come, young men, to us if
You want to meet a clever, meat,
Domesticated housewife.
But what is the point of our cooking a joint, or learning to
make a steak tender?
Why worry our heads with the making of beds or striving to
polish a fender?
It is all thrown away, for the youths of to-day decline to wax
keen and ecstatic
Over gifts such as these; what they want, if you please, is
something more melodramatic.
If you're hunting a mate, you should try to create some
intensely exciting sensation,
Which will boom through the press till your pictures obsess
the wondering thoughts of the nation.
Teople don't seem to mind what's precisely the kind of the
feat that may win motoriety:
It is excellent if you go over a cliff and vanish awhile from
society,
If your only pretence is a same common-sense, as a spinster

But the suitors arrive thick as bees in a hive if you leap
from the bridge down at Clifton;
And many a maid with the poison has played when the
thought irresistibly stirred her
That the men in a cue would be waiting to woo if she’d only
committed a murder.
Yet perchance, after all, we should pause ere we call these
youths all the names we’ve a mind to ;
There is something, perhaps, to be said for the chaps for
doing the things they’re inclined to.
If a man weds a maid who is thoroughly staid and always
sane, sober and sensible,
The monotony serves to get right on his nerves till her
virtues appear reprehensible;
But should she be known, pretty dear, to have shown a
penchant for poison, it follows
The monotony goes when her husband well knows he must
watch every mouthful he swallows;
His life is possessed of a freshness and zest, and his wits
will grow brighter and brighter
When he never can tell if that curious smell is oxalic or
spirits of nitre.
Domesticated damsels we
Will call ourselves no more;
We’ve done with pots and pans, we're free
Of culinary lore.
Henceforth our time we’ll spend in crime

A CONVERSATION-MANUAL FOR THE MONKEY-HOUSE.
Notice to the Public.
HAVING observed certain statements in the Press to the
effect that Dr. GARNER, of Chicago University, is now engaged
in compiling a Vocabulary of the Simian language as spoken
by the Larger Apes, Mr. Punch feels it only due to himself
to inform his readers that he has long been labouring in
the same field as the learned American Professor, and that ||
his “Complete Handbook of Colloquial Phrases Current in
Polite Monkey Society” is already in the hands of the Printers.
This important work—revised and corrected by no less
an authority than the Principal Baboon of the Royal Zoo- |
logical College at Regent's Park—will enable visitors to
the Monkey-House to converse fluently with the residents
in their own tongue, and thereby get into closer touch with
them than has hitherto been practicable. -
It is perhaps unnecessary to dwell upon the advantages |
of promoting a better understanding between two races |
which have so much in common, and the two specimen ||
dialogues which follow will serve to illustrate the general ||
scheme of the manual.
Intending students will soon discover that Monkeyish is
not so difficult as it looks, provided they are careful to follow ||
the phonetic pronunciation as indicated in the text. -

JUST LIKE THEIR LUCK.
The Daily Chronicle recently narrated
the circumstances in which Mr. CHARLES
CRIVELLI, a Soho hairdresser, has picked
up for a few shillings a genuine Titian.
These trouvailles, we are glad to say, are
of almost daily occurrence in Soho and
the neighbourhood, as may be gathered
from the following well authenticated
cases. -
Mr. Julian Swoggle, a Venetian blind-
maker, is the fortunate possessor of a
priceless Greek statue which he picked
up literally for a song in the Euston
Road.
“I was walking along the road in
question the other evening,” explains
Mr. Swoggle, “humming ‘Antonio,'
when a monumental mason accosted me
and said, “Do you want a life-size statue
for nothing?’ ‘You’re kidding me,' I
answered. “Not a bit of it,” said he; ‘I
want the room, and if you'll cart the
thing away, it's yours for nothing.' To
cut a long story short, I took the statue
away in a lorry the next day, and when
I'd got it home and given it a bath sure
enough there was the signature PHEIDLAs
carved on the plinth.”
Constable (emphatically). “ONE's
We understood that Lord ARMSTRONG
has written to Mr. Swoggle congratulat-
ing him on having become the possessor
of a genuine and incontestable Pheidias.
The necessary restoration is now taking
place, as the statue, which represents
a wrestler, lacks a nose, chin, both
arms and the greater part of one leg,
and before very long some Mr. Pierpont
Morgan or some other opulent Maecenas
will have the opportunity of purchasing
a masterpiece.
Mr. John Burdekin, an artificial sau-
sage-skin manufacturer, recently picked
up a magnificent diamond tiara in ro-
mantic circumstances. It was put up
for sale at an auction in the Strand as
“portions of a chandelier,” and knocked
down to Mr. Burdekin for 3s. 6d. On
taking it home the owner accidentally
dropped his purchase from the top of
an electric tram, and to his amazement
not a single one of the glass drops was
smashed. This excited his suspicions,
and after consulting a Dutch expert in
Spring Gardens, he was delighted to
find that they were diamonds of extra-
ordinary size and lustre. Among the
connoisseurs who have already pro-
nounced the diamonds genuine are Lord,
A crowd, if I say so! Move on 1"

The circumstances which placed Mr.
Julius Ballin, an aged dolls'-eye maker,
in possession of one of the most famous
of all historic jewels, are intensely
romantic. About ten days ago he was
eating a kromesky in a restaurant in

a hard substance, which on inspection
turned out to be a pearl on which the
initials A and C were distinctly observ-
able. Incredible as it may seem, this
pearl, on the authority of Lord ARM-
stroNG, Lord RosslyN, the Marquis
Townshend and other experts, has been
pronounced to be none other than the
one which CLEOPATRA was inaccurately
alleged to have dissolved in a goblet of
wine. As a matter of fact it was fished
out by ANTONY and appropriated by
AUGUSTUs after the battle of Actium,
remaining in Rome until it was carried
away with other relics by the great
NAPOLEoN. Subsequently pawned by
NAPOLEON III. when in exile, it fell into
the hands of a restaurant keeper who,
unaware of its value, presented it to his
chef, who inadvertently allowed it to
become embodied in one of his dishes.

OH, would you, Ass, that I refute
The opprobrium and ill repute
Which ever to your title clings?
Then listen while the poet sings:—
In Ireland, where the shamrock grows
(And Goodness, knowing all things,
knows
Why he that writes of Ireland can't
Avoid that overbearing plant)—
In Ireland I have travelled far
In someone else's motor-car,
And from my seat have studièd
The ways of bi- and quadruped,
Who eat and drink and sleep and play
Entirely on the King's highway.
The errant kine themselves approve
Slow, stupid, dull and hard to move;
Whereas the swine, whom nothing will
Induce to think of standing still,
Must run ahead with endless fuss,
Too fast for them, too slow for us.
The dogs (a race which men suppose
To be a race that thinks and knows)
Bounce forth with misdirected zeal
And barely miss a murderous wheel,
Then bark and bark with false delight
Because they’ve put the foe to flight!
The hen, being situated where,
Secure from harm and free from care,
She might have watched us and derided,
Descends forthwith to be divided.
The horse, whose more than ample task
Should furnish all he needs to ask,
Sees fit to disregard the reins
And take no end of foolish pains
To drag his most excessive load
Into the ditch beside the road,
Then labours much and suffers more
To get it where it was before.
You, Ass, behave as none of these,
But hold you calm and well at ease.
Perhaps to keep the eyebrow kempt,
Perhaps to show a deep contempt,
You simply turn your head away,
And keep it turned, as if to say:
“It’s got to come. Let's shut an eye
And let the foul machine go by.”
Thus you shall be to me for ever
The type of all that's wise and clever;
And asinine henceforth shall mean
“Discerning, sensible, serene.”
O Ass, you pressed me to refute
The opprobrium and ill repute
Which ever to your title clung;
I hope you’ve listened while I’ve sung.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CATCH AS CATCH CAN.
PATRONs of the Alhambra, which has
lately been the scene of some excellent
wrestling, might have been excused if,
on leaving by the St. Martin's Lane exit,
they had been roused to even greater
enthusiasm by the posters of the Garrick
Theatre which met their eyes with the
enthralling announcement, “Mr. Bour-
chier as Samson.” Yet another thrilling
bout, this time between an Actor-Manager
and an ordinary lion—that is the least
they could have expected. Fortunately
(or unfortunately) all that is to be seen is
Mr. Bourchieſ in the latest play from
France.
Samson, a modern melodrama by
HENRY BERNSTEIN, is an episode in the
life of that strong silent man, Jacques
Brachard, Copper King. . Besides being
strong and silent (in so far as an actor-
manager can be silent) he is also self-
made, a rough diamond and one of
Nature's gentlemen. You know exactly
the sort of man I mean, and you know
how perfectly Mr. BourCHIER would play
him. : Well, anyhow, he was in love with
Anne-Marie, who was his wife and
therefore (this is a four-act play and the
scene is Paris) in love with Jérôme Le
Govain. Jérôme I am now going to
call Jesse, partly because they did so on
the stage, and partly because the accents
bother the printer a good deal. Jesse
I may introduce as the sort of man
who makes me sorry that the “Torture
of the Hot Egg" is now popular only
in the rural parts of China. On the
first night that Jacques leaves his
wife (in order to go to England on
copper business) Jesse takes her, off
the stage, to a horrible supper-party;
to the disgusting story of whose orgies
we are compelled to listen in the Third
Act. - Anne-Marie's love for him is
killed by this exhibition, and she makes
her escape in the middle of it; return-
ing home to find that Jacques hadn't
left for England after all. (He had
been WARNED. By a FRIEND.) Jacques
decides to take his revenge on Jesse by
ruining him financially, and in order to
do this he has to create a panic on the
Bourse by selling copper. (Or buying it;
I am a child in these matters.) Any-
how, some difficulty arose, and he had to
sell all he had (or buy a lot he didn't
want) in order to upset Jesse thoroughly;
in other words, he had to ruin himself
to ruin his enemy. Which, if you
remember, is what SAMSON did when he
pulled down the pillars of the temple.
Of course, just as the curtain falls,
Anne-Marie discovers that she really
loves Jacques. Cynics will point out that
her lover was hopelessly ruined and about
a million (no, only francs) in debt;
whereas her husband, being the sort
of man from whom Copper Kings are
made, was certain to amass another for-
tune in a week. I take a more charitable
view of human nature. I simply say
that the man at the box-office insisted
that Anne-Marie should love Jacques
before the curtain went down.
Though I grow older every day, yet
there are two institutions in which I
retain a touching and child-like faith:
the Stock Exchange and the French
Marriage. My faith is so great that
I could believe anything of them.
And so if they tell me that a great
Copper King, who controls markets, has
to lose eighty-four millions (no, still only
francs) before he can ruin a com-
paratively poor man who trusts him
“I HEAR THE sound of words.”
Samson Agonistes.

implicitly in matters of finance, I accept
it humbly and with gratitude. And if
they go on to say that a Lover would,
on the first possible occasion, take a
proud, cold, aristocrat of a Wife to a
revolting supper party, where she would
meet the very scourings of the streets,
then again in all humility I believe. But
a doubt will haunt me none the less, and
I ask myself two questions: Has any-
thing happened in the translation?
Was Miss WIOLET WANBRUGH, typical
Englishwoman as she is, quite suited to
the part of Anne-Marie 2
The scene in the Third Act, where
Jacques keeps Jesse in his private room
at the Ritz, while Copper is being
brought down, is an excellent one; there
actually is a short wrestling interlude
here. In addition Mr. Boultchien does
good work on as pleasant a lunch as I
have seen on the stage. This is always
a popular feature with the audience, the
feeling being, I suppose, one of satis-
faction that an actor is a human being
just like ourselves. But having missed
my dinner on the night in question I
could hardly bear it.
Comic relief was supplied effec-
tively by the relations of Jacques' wife.
Ifancy M. BERNSTEIN found that he was
an hour short, and introduced the rela-
tions at the beginning of each Act to fill
up the time. Mr. ARTHUR WHITBY and
Mr. KENNETH Dougi,As were both very
funny as Anne - Marie's father and
brother respectively. I have mentioned
Mr. BourchiCR's excellence as Jacques,
and I must pay tribute also to Mr.
CHARLEs BRYANT's Jesse. Miss EDYTH
LATIMER, who has a curiously fascinating
voice and manner, showed, in the part
of a discarded mistress of Jesse's, that
she fully deserved all that was said of
her after her promising appearance in
Idols. M.

THE POLITE ART OF WITUPERATION.
I.
“Just look at these boots,” said
George. James looked, but the boots
remained unmoved. “Well?” said
George.
“Well?” said James, ever ready to
oblige.
“Did you ever see anything like
them 2''
“Never,” said James emphatically,
though he had no idea whether he was
expressing wonder and admiration, or
loathing and contempt.
“They are disgraceful,” said George.
“Abominable,” said James, much
relieved to find out what opinion he
was to hold. “What is the matter with
them 2 ”
“Matter? Why, they are unwear-
able. Fancy expecting a normal foot,
not made of indiarubber, to go about in
a boot with an instep like that l”
“Isn't it tight enough 2"
“Tight enough? Why, it's miles
too tight. It is not to be tolerated. I
am going to give the man that made it
a thorough blowing up.”
“I should give him a piece of your
mind,” said James.
“I shall certainly give him a bit of
my tongue,” said George. “Fancy
daring to send me a pair of boots like
that I'll make the fellow sit up.”
“I should tell him exactly what you
think of him.”
“My dear James, when I have finished
talking to him he will know so much
about himself that he will wish he
had never been born. Moreover, he
shall take back those boots and make
me another pair for nothing. Let us
go round and talk to the fellow now.”
So minded, George and James set off
for Bond Street.
II. .
Arrived at the shop, they paused a
moment to decide upon the line of
attack, whether it should be the stormy
or the sarcastic. Then they marched
up to the door and allowed it to be
opened for them, without flinching.
Once inside, a Gentleman with a frock-
coat and white slip took charge of them,
and, had they wanted to say “Jack
Robinson,” they could not have done so
before they found themselves seated in
large armchairs and the Gentleman
kneeling affectionately at the feet of
George.
“I have come,” said the latter, not to
be demoralised by a soft carpet and a
universal peace, “about these boots.”
| “Indeed, Sir 2" said the Gentleman,
in a subdued voice which clearly re-
buked George for talking so loud. He
took off George's old boots and put on
the new ones, much as a nurse dresses
a very bad child in very good clothes.
“And a handsome pair of boots they
are, Sir, if I may say so.” At this point
James, for no particular reason, felt
more ashamed of his own feet than he
had ever felt ashamed of anything
before.
“But look at them,” said George.
“Sh—” said James.
“Yes, Sir,” said the Gentleman, “I
admit that I cannot help looking at
them. Even for us they are a beautiful
creation. Particularly observe, Sir, the
perfect fit over the instep, producing a
smart appearance which every boot-
maker in London has for years been
trying in vain to imitate.”
“But surely they are a little too
tight?” -
“Too tight, Sir 2" said the Gentle-
man, apparently aghast at George's
horrible suggestion; and then, as one
whose innate breeding compels him to
disguise his contempt, “Oh, no, Sir.
With a smart foot like yours you cannot
have the instep too tight. Too tight?
Oh, no, Sir!”—and even his breeding
could not restrain just a little smile at
the bare idea. -
“But . . .” said George, knowing in
his heart that it was really no use.
“Of course, Sir, if you are going to
wear them in the very depths of the
country, where none of your friends can
see you, we CAN . . . though it seems a
pity to spoil them . . . we CAN let them
out a bit.”
“I think they are just a little too
tight,” said George, blushing but stub-
born.
“Well, of course, Sir, it is for you to
say. If you insist . . . say, an eighth
of an inch. We shall only charge you a
shilling or two; and what address shall
I send them to ?”
Then, with one parting look of affec-
tion, the Gentleman put the cause of the
trouble back in the box, and with an
effort lowered himself to put on George's
feet his old boots, made by another and
therefore disreputable firm. His lips
only made some remark about the mild-
ness of the weather, but his eyes clearly
said, “After all, what can one expect
from a man who could ever wear boots
like these ?”
And so, having no further use for
them, he gently put George and James
out into the street again.
III.
“After all,” said George, after a long
silence, “I could not be too hard on the
man. It wasn't his fault; he didn't
make the boots. Besides, it was very
decent of him to promise to send them
back without charging for the postage.”
A Pleasant Innovation.
“The bride appeared in a smart white frock
of pale blue linen.”—Western Mail (Australia).
ASTOUNDING THEATRICAL
SENSATION.
SELF-EFFACING ACTOR-MANAGER.
INTERVIEw with Mr. REECE.
(Suggested by the account of Miss Marie Dress-
ler's altruistic methods recently given in
“The Pall Mall Gazette.”)
As I entered the stage door of the
new Philadelphia Theatre in Shaftesbury
Avenue, writes a representative of
Punch, I felt myself engulfed in an
atmosphere of bonhomie that almost took
my breath away. The rehearsals of the
new tragi-comedy, Mia!ed Pickles, had
been going on for sixteen hours almost
continuously, but everyone was in the
highest spirits. Seeing me at the wings,
Mr. Reece greeted me with a shout of
welcome. “An interview 2 Of course,
my dear fellow. We'll knock off work
for half-an-hour, and I'll tell you some-
thing about my methods. -
“Now look at this galaxy of talent.
Lovely and accomplished women; high-
souled, chivalrous men.” Here Mr.
Reece—whose likeness in profile to his
distinguished father, the late Captain
Reece, R.N., is quite extraordinary—
turned to the actors and actresses
grouped around him and addressed them
in words of the most intense and moving
earnestness: “Never forget, dear boys
and girls,” were the words which fell on
my astounded ears, “that every one of
you means more to me than I do myself.
You interest me and the public more
than the principals, because there is
the element of uncertainty and the
unexpected about you.”
Leaving the chorus for a moment, Mr.
Reece indicated another special feature
of his management by pointing out a
number of the principals, and saying,
“Every one of them has a fatter part
than mine. You know London audi-
ences don't really want any one person.
On the stage, as in politics, il m'y a pas
d'homme mécessaire. We live in an age
of Collectivism. And don't you imagine
that I do this against the grain. It is a
tradition of the family—you know my
father's motto, “It was his duty and he
did.” Take this play; I had a splendid
scene in the first Act when it was
originally cast, but, like Jack Sprat, I
can't stand fat, so I gave it up to some-
one else.” - -
“But surely you repented your
generosity ?”
“Not a bit of it, my dear boy. The
fact is I like producing much more than
acting, and I have practically decided
never to appear in another play, though
I have taken the theatre for fourteen
years. Ah, here is Otis Lemuel,” he
said, summoning to his side the young
jeune premier who is already famous in
Australia. “He is really gorgeous, and

PLACE BURN ?”
he has a gorgeous part. Haven't you?”
he asked him.
“Simply ripping,” replied Mr.
Lemuel, affectionately putting his arm
round the actor-manager's neck; “but I
owe it to you, my first and greatest
benefactor.”
“Ah, but if you hadn't got the brain
of a Garrick and the figure of an Apollo,”
replied Mr. Reece, “you would never
have got where you are—at the top of
the tree.”
Shedding a few natural tears of
titude Mr. Lemuel retired, and then
Mr. Bert Folsom came up, and in a voice
trembling with emotion stammered out:
“Mr. Reece has been a father and
mother to me. But for him I might
have gone into the diplomatic service or
olitics ” “Instead of which,” adds
. Reece, “you are now the idol of the
Antipodes and earn a salary of £200 a
week. And he's worth it too, every
penny of it.”
Similar testimonies to the angelic
kindness of Mr. Reece were also forth-
coming from Miss Letty Slazenger, Miss
Daisy Gellibrand and Mr. Uther Hipkins.
“Rehearsing for Mr. Reece,” they re-
marked in unison, “is a labour of love.
He is the best man in the world. We
would all die for him this minute.”
“Yes, mine is indeed a happy lot,”
remarked Mr. Reece afterwards. “You
remember the beautiful old lyric:—
“If you love me and I love you,
We'll both of us love one another:
So wrap me up in the Union Jack,
And kiss me for my mother!'
It has always been my aim to run my
show on those lines, and so far I think
I have succeeded.”
THE CRISIS.
My heart is lost to Grace and Rose,
Each lovelier than the dawn and
blither;
But how on earth can I propose
To either?
For both I burn with flame devout,
The sort no time nor chance can
smother,
But somehow not for one without
The other.
If Grace consented to be mine,
Her single charms would soon seem
prosy ;
With tenfold passion I should pine
For Rosie.
Conversely, were I linked with R.,
I doubt not (such is Cupid's curst
wile)
That Grace would seem diviner far
Than erstwhile.
Next problem: either might refuse.
But would it calm my bosom's
heavings,
Bereſt of half my love, to choose
The leavings?
And if they both disdained my hand
The prospect fairly makes me shiver,
I do not think my health would stand
The river.
Yet here we are—time flies apace—
Just now I take a modest breather,
But soon it must be Rose or Grace,
Or neither.
And since, dear Sir, whate'er betides,
The outlook seems a sadly glum one,
And swains despairing must confide
In someone,
Please help a suitor in distress,
Lest love's true course that never ran
well
Should make him alter his address
To Hanwell.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
My African Journey (HopDER AND StocGHTON), which is the
story of a visit paid to Uganda by the Rt. Hon. WINSTON
SPENCER CHURCHILL, M.P., does not pretend to be the record
of a pioneer; nor does the author here press his claims as a
mighty hunter, though the cover of his book represents him,
in a blood-red landscape, posed beside a prostrate rhinoceros.
One of these monstrous fauna he felled with his own hand,
and took part in the peppering of another to death; but the
quest of big game was only an incidental feature in his
progress as an exalted tripper along a course where every
need had been anticipated and the only opposition on his
ath came from hostile and predatory tribes of insects. But
#. narrative of a not very difficult enterprise is invested
with a literary charm unusual in the ordinary traveller's tale.
Always observant, Mr. CHURCHILL is more concerned to convey
truly his impressions than to make fine writing; but now
author of them. Still, a fine story, written with care and
distinction.
In Reminiscences of my Life (PITMAN) Sir CHARLEs SANTLEY
continues and supplements the story of his brilliant career
as set out some years ago in Student and Singer. It is a
rambling and discursive narrative, not without engaging
qualities, for Sir CHARLEs makes no effort to disguise his likes
and dislikes. SIMS REEVES was his friend, and he defends
that great singer's memory with a creditable warmth, which
is, however, not incompatible with a few sly, but good-
humoured, digs at Mrs. REEVES, her husband's jealous cham-
pion. BoITO's music he cannot abide, and for WAGNER's he
has a limited admiration. Fortunately Sir Charles has lived
long enough to note a strong reaction in favour of the names
he venerates. , Sir CHARLES's writing, I may add, is not quite
so careful and highly finished as the singing by which he
has delighted nearly two generations. There is an artless
happy-go-lucky kind of slap-dash about it, as, for instance,
when he refers to our old friend Argus as “the fabled what's-

The Faith of his Fathers (MELRose) is a prize novel by A. E.
JAcoMB, selected by Messrs. ANDREW LANG, W. L. CourTNEy,
and CLEMENT SHORTER, for a prize of two hundred and fifty
guineas. It is also selected by me for a few words of hearty
commendation as a strong and sincere story of provincial life.
William Atkinson was one of those honest bigots who viewed
life steadily, and saw only a fraction of it—a narrow-minded
Methodist who stopped all argument with a quotation
from the Bible. He forced his weak son Stephen into an
unhappy marriage, and renounced Rachel, his daughter,
when she became engaged to a man who could not accept
his own creed; and he finally resigned his post at the works
because the firm had accepted a contract to make war material.
A fine man spoilt. Miss JACOMB (no hint of her sex in the
story) shows very surely how in Mrs. Atkinson the wife's
sweet faith in her husband is gradually turned to bitter in
the mother's love for her children. The final tragedy,
Stephen's killing of his wife, is accidental, and capricious—
it would have been far truer had the mother, maddened by
her children's wrongs, inevitably turned upon the direct

he is also greatly interested in the development of canals.”—Cycling.
This is one of those spontaneous remarks which bring the
press very near the heart of the great British public.

[FEBRUARY 24, 1909.
PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PRIVATE REFLECTIONS OF A CONSCIENTIOus Fox.
(As they might occur to him, if– as, being a highly-intelligent animal, is
not so rery improbable after all –he should happen to be a constant
reader of the admirable “ Hunting” notes in “The Daily Telegraph.”)
MUST be up and doing before long. Plorn Hounds meet
in this wood to-day “by invitation.” Whose invitation?
I'm sure I never asked 'em They are going to make what
the clever gentleman who describes all the runs so pictu-
resquely in The Daily Telegraph would call a “raid.” Why
“raid " ? Always thought “raiding” was my job. But he
must know best. I do admire his style. Wonder how he'll
describe the weather. Will he call this “a wild stormy day
that bodes none too promisingly,” or merely mention that
“the wind is spiced with abnormal harshness”? Sball I
gather that “hounds have again to grapple with an extremely
bad scent” 2 All I can say is that, if so, they can't blame me.
If they find it disagreeable, they needn't run after it . . .
Can hear hounds whimpering. Expect I shall be what
the D. T. gentleman calls “unkennelled ” before long.
Queer word that, “unkennelled.” A sportsman with all
his experience can't be confusing a fox with a hound, I
suppose ? But no—it's sure to be correct. If I don't live
in a kennel, I ought to, that's all. Hope he’ll be out to-day,
and write something pleasant about me. He can be rather
severe on some foxes. Called one a “craven” the other day,
and said he “tried to shirk his obligations.” If he wrote
that of me, I don't think I should ever hold up my brush
again. But what are my “obligations" exactly 2
The D. T. gentleman, I know, likes a fox to “accept
his mission cheerfully.” Only I wasn't aware that I had
any mission. And if I have, I shan’t get time to make any
converts. Then he'll expect me to be “full of courage.”
One fox whom he mentions with approval “stood in front
of hounds for just over two hours.” Afraid I should never
have courage enough for that. At same time, from other
remarks of his, can't help thinking he would rather I ran
away. Very puzzling to know what I really ought to do. . . .
Point settled for me. Hounds have, as the D. T. sports-
man will probably put it, “got me quickly on the move,”
and are “pushing me away.” I am out in the open now.
Getting across a field : I would “ traverse” it instead, if I
knew how it's done—cnly I don't. Hounds some distance
in rear, but “working,” to do them justice, “with marked
perseverance.”
as their “pilot.” A heavy responsibility. I do hope I shan't
run them into any difficulties ' If I took 'em across the railway
line just when a train was coming up, the D. T. gentleman
might be masty about it next day. Will make—I mean
“shape my course”—for Pounders Hill, and endeavour to
“carry a bold front" over it. Am bold enough in front—
but not so sure about the brush end of me. I will “hie
on. . . . .” * *
Still “hie-ing on.” I suppose this is what the D. T.
sportsman will call “a merry twenty minutes.” Hope he is
near enough to notice that I am “one of the right stamp,”
and am “enabling the hounds to credit themselves with a
rousing hunt.” They are hunting very prettily, I will say
that for them; but mere prettiness is apt to pall after a time.
Have had enough of it already. . . . -
Drop into Slinkby's Spinney. Find another fox there—
luckily a fellow I know, and one of the best. Would he mind
taking the hounds on for a bit till I get my wind back? Such
a pity to spoil their sport just as they're getting so keen. He
says, “All right—he's game to give 'em a “jaunt' for a few
minutes.” He does. . . .
Capital view of run from edge of spinney. My substitute
lias shown them the way over a brook, which (as I trust the
D. T. sportsman will not forget to record) is “taking its usual
toll.” He may be paying the toll himself, for all I know.
My business is to “lead the chase,” and act ||
“Things,” as he would put it, “are going uncommonly
brightly, hounds giving a most praiseworthy display, and
running with rare determination and self-reliance.” So is
my poor friend—with too much self-reliance, indeed. Can't
make out from where I am whether he is “rolled,” “bowled,”
or “toppled ” over, or simply “pulled down”—but evidently
hounds have “closed his existence.” Well, well, he will
have a kindly obituary notice in the D. T. to morrow—if its
representative is out of the brook—and what more can he
want 2 . . . -
Hounds will probably be “ringing back” here shortly.
Better not wait for them. Will follow example of one of the
D. T.'s foxes, and “go to ground in a rabbit-warren.” Tight
squeeze getting in. Occasion what the D. T. gentleman calls
a “ſlutter” and “brief scurries,”—only he refers to horses,
not rabbits. Explain to residents that this is not a business
visit. Lie low and make myself agreeable, till informed by
elderly and highly nervous rabbit that “bolting ” is going
on above. He offers, most obligingly, to show me out by
back way. Mustn't forget, if spared, to call on him to-
morrow. N.B. Elderly—but plump. . . .
“Set going” once more. “Quick response” from hounds.
Must “harden my heart,” and try at least “to furnish them
with a spin" before I am run down. I think the D. T.
representative will admit that I am “yielding a very enjoy-
able hunt.” Hounds behind me seem to be “keeping the
fun well sustained ’’ and “making light of obstacles.” They
are certainly “pushing me smartly along.”
Fancy the field is “reduced to a vanishing point,” as I
shall be presently unless I’m jolly careful. Hope the D. T.
gentleman hasn't taken a toss. Should like him to be in
at the finish. Then he could describe it in his own inimit-
able manner. Like this: “The old warrior sustained a lot
more punishment before being toppled over dead-beat in the
open.” That's an epitaph any fox might feel proud of ! I
do hope he won't remark, as he did in one case, that I am
“carrying anything but a bloom on my coat.” Don't like
personalities—and besides, “De mortuis,” &c.
The thing that is worrying me most—at present —is what
sort of finish I shall get. I mean, shall I be “handsomely
killed,” “polished off,” or “grimly dealt with ”? Not quite
clear what the distinction is, but must say I don't relish
the idea of being “grimly dealt with.”
unpleasant. . . .
It may be only my fancy, but it strikes me I’ve “run the
hounds out of scent.” Most inconsiderate of me! They're
Sounds so very
not in sight anyhow. Ought I to allow'em time to come up.
Seems only polite, after all the trouble I’ve given them. And
then there's the D. T. representative—should be sorry to
forfeit his good opinion. He might give me such a good
notice On the other hand, if he did, I should never see
it. And there's an earth close by that's really uncommonly
handy. I think, perhaps, I'd better be “getting in.” . . .
I have. Tegret to disappoint the Plorn pack—for whom I
have the highest respect, and particularly the D. T. gentle-
man. But his “Hunting” notes will be more interesting
than ever to-morrow morning. F. A.

ALL THESE RICII PEOPLE * *
LUXURY AT THE HALLS.
New METHODs of BARBERISM.
[The management of the Empire have opened
a barber's shop in the stalls foyer. “The
equipment of the complete-ittle salon de coiffure
in the luxurious later Empire style,” so we
read in The Daily Mail, “comprises a troupe
of three artist coiffeurs, a cultured lady mani-
curist, an a' omplished hat-ironer, and the
dernier cri in boo polishers.” The staff has
also been strengthened by the addition of an
interpreter, a Hungarian baron, who is attired
in gorgeous livery and who speaks seven
languages with impunity.]
ON inquiry at the Friv. we learned
that within the last few days every box
had been equipped with a Turkish Bath,
so completely screened off that habitués
will be enabled to indulge in this
luxurious form of ablution without
attracting the attention of the rest of
the audience. Another admirable and
patriotic new departure is the importa-
tion of a drill sergeant who will give
instruction gratis in the space at the
back of the stalls between the turns.
Concurrently with the performance on
the stage it has been arranged that Dr.
EMIL REICH shall give lectures in the
lounge on the Pre-Socratics to the accom-
paniment of a Hungarian dulcimer.
At the Stolliseum the innovations are
of a character entirely in keeping with
the literary and philosophic accomplish-
ments of the Manager. Thus every seat
in the gallery carries with it the right
to consult Who's Who: every seat in
the balcony is provided with a copy of
Debrett: underneatheverystall is a dainty
case containing the complete works of
HERBERT SpENCER; and every box is fitted
with shelves containing a complete set
of The Dictionary of National Biography.
The manager of the Cosmopolitan
states that his New Features are of a
most wide-reaching and sensational
character, but he does not wish to dis-
count their effect by any premature an-
nouncement. He contents himself for
the moment by mentioning that, except-
ing the first row, every seat in the stalls
and balcony will be provided with an
X-ray apparatus, enabling occupants to
see through the most umbrageous and
opaque of Merry Widow hats. The
attendants are all first-rate linguists,
speaking Russian, Japanese, and Esper-
anto, and the chucker-out is an Austrian
archduke who was exiled from his native
land for wearing open-work socks at a
Court Ball.
Acharming invention, which bids fair
to enhance the already immense popu-
larity of the Columbia, has been intro-
duced at that famous music-hall. Every
seat in the house is capable of revolving
like a music-stool, so that, when so
disposed, the spectator can turn his
back on the stage and face in any direc-
tion he pleases. Again, besides supply-
ing the usual refreshments, theattendants
provide narcotics, sedatives and other
drugs enabling weary persons to slumber
peacefully in their seats. In cases where
the sleepers have not awakened at the
close of the performance, the attendants
are then instructed to remove them in
ambulances to the restaurant, where hot
coffee and other stimulants are provided.

Papa (jocosely). I don't know that he's got any business to
shoot elephants; but then you see he's a great man–
President of the United States and all that.
L. A. Oh, I see. Does that make a difference then 2

He's entitled to some rest.

Papa. Yes, my boy.
L. A. What is a faunal naturalist 2 Have you ever been
a faunal naturalist?
Papa. Hum—ha, well, I don't know. I'm not sure that
I ever have been. It's one of those American expressions—
just a way of saying things. Dcesn't mean anything in

say, isn't KERMIT a rum name?
Papa. An American name, my boy.
L. A. Yes, I see. And then there's something in the
paper about his going away because (reading) “he intends
to put himself beyond the reach of those persons who, be
believes, would inevitably seek, if he were within reach,
to use his influence with the administration of President
WILLIAM H. TAFT.” There's a lot more like that. Is that
supposed to be very noble of Mr. RooseVELT 2 Doesn't he
like President WILLIAM H. TAFT 2
Papa. Like him? Of course he does.
L. A. Well, he's running a long way away from him,
isn't he? Oughtn't he to stay and help him? And, Papa,
is Mr. RooseVELT a very brave man 2
Papa. Certainly, my boy, very brave indeed.
L. A. But it says (reading): “There is not a member of
the party who is not an excellent rifle-shot, and assurances
have been given that not the least fear need be entertained
for Mr. RooseVELT's safety while he is away.” If it's so safe,
Papa, I don't see much fun in going; do you?
Papa. Ah, but perhaps they're mistaken, you know.
L. A. Who are mistaken, Papa?
Papa. Why, the people who give these assurances.

his bullets and his tents and his folding baths; and, oh,

PERENNIAL bud, accustomed long to seek
The mural shelter of the uninvited—
If of her charms we hesitate to speak,
Her hopes, at any rate, remain unblighted.
She trips it still, though her fantastic toe
Has lost the lightness of its first endeavour;
For men may come (sometimes) and men may go,
But she goes on (expecting 'em) for ever.
Once more we watch her in her mellow glee
Shambling around at their infrequent bidding;
Or looking (in the Lancers, figure 3)
Sweetly suggestive of a Wanguard skidding;
Or sitting out and, with engaging slang,
Voicing her girlish preference for ices;
Or toying pertly with a pink meringue,
Of which a simple crumb or two suffices.
We watch her partners—men who never shrink,
Courtiers whom coy antiquities deter not,
Who utter blithely, “This is ours, I think,”
While wishing most profoundly that it were not.
It is the same in Hornsey or Mayfair—
In either grade, the middle or the upper—
If youth is on the hop she's always there,
And someone's got to take her in to supper!

part of last year, and have not yet
been paid for the same. We regret
that we are unable to give unlimited
credit, and must ask for immediate pay-

payment we shall be compelled to place
the matter in the hands of our solicitors.

[FEmruary 24, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CONFESSION.
I DON'T like to go out with this thing
on my conscience. . . . .
I want to tell the whole story and die
in peace. . .
Let me begin at the beginning.
I was an only dog. I had a very
happy home. My mistress was a beau-
tiful woman, with long skirts on which I
was allowed to lie. My master was a
magnificent man, fond of walking. They
were both weak, too, and fed me at
meals with little bits, and let me lie
close to the fire. That was upstairs,
where, of course, I liked to be best ; but
| downstairs was good, too, for the maids
did not mind dogs (as some do, I am
told), and there was a handy-man
named Vincent who fed me very punc-
tually, and with whom I walked out on
his errands, even though I could see
that he tried to make people think I was
his.
That was in London, in a house near
Kensington Gardens, where I had many
friends.
In the country I was equally lucky,
for we moved every spring to a place
with many rabbits near it, and though I
never caught one I rejoiced in their
proximity. It had very sunny spots to
lie in, too.
You see how happy I was, as happy
as only an only dog can be.
That is my tragedy.
How little we expect the upheavals of
life!. One day my master returned in
the evening, much as usual, but carry-
ing a basket. Fish, I thought, without
enthusiasm—cat's food ; or perhaps
fruit, which is, if possible, duller still.
But I was wofully wrong, for out of this
basket he took a small black creature—
one of the kind known, I believe, as
am Aberdeen terrier, a breed I have
always disliked. I, as you have noticed,
am an Irish spaniel.
“Here, Bush,” he said (my name is
Bush), “is a companion for you !” and
he held the thing towards me. Com-
panion . For some days, I need hardly
say, I did not approach the reptile, and
I kept away also from my master and
mistress, just to punish them, although
I am afraid they were too much occupied
with their new toy to observe it. And
them gradually I allowed myself to come
round and to resume my old habits.
But how different everything was
At meal times, whereas I used to get all
the tit-bits, I now received only half;
when my master whistled in the old days
it was for me, but now it might also be
for that other, and indeed he was often
there before me. In short, I was no
longer an only dog.
Things went on like this for some
months, until one day Scottie (as they
called him) began to be ill; and he
got worse and worse, and at last died.
One had, of course, to make some show
of grief, but, by Sirius, how glad I was
at heart! I had the greatest difficulty
to keep my tail still—it would wag; and
when I heard my mistress say, “Well,
in future, dear, Bush shall be our only
dog,” I had to pretend I had a flea to
cover my emotion.
From that moment all my old happi-
ness returned; I had the place again to
myself; I had all the hearth-rug, and
all the tit-bits, and all the caresses, and
all the walks. My master grew in mag-
nificence, my mistress in beauty.
But alas ! human beings have very
changeable minds; and one day what
should appear out of a wholly blue
sky but another basket, from which
there crawled another dog; but this time
a more genuine article, a cocker spaniel
pup. The first thing he did, as if his mere
presence were not enough, was to frisk
towards me and set his horribly sharp
little teeth in my ear. Naturally I gave
him a bite that sent him screaming
round the room, and my master opened
the door and sternly ordered me out,
while my mistress caught the creature in
her arms and kissed it. A good begin-
ning ! -
And so it went on : I was always in
disgrace for complaining of assault or
for showing my intense disapproval of
the vacillation of these people and the
loss of my recovered privileges; for
once again the hearthrug ceased to be
my own, and I secured only half the
tit-bits, and when my master snapped
his fingers I often did not get there
first, for these little cockers are con-
foundedly nippy, and Vincent, when he
took me out, took the other too.
It was while I was one day medi-
tating on my misery that a brilliant
thought came to me—brilliant as I con-
sidered it then, but wicked as I know
now. It is, as you are probably aware,
the nature of the spaniel to be, while
friendly to all, passionately faithful to
one alone, and that one a man. This
little dog was too young and inexperi-
enced to have come to any conclusions
about the composition of a household :
he was naturally without knowledge of
class or degree. My plan was to take
advantage of his ignorance and plas-
ticity, and persuade him that Vincent,
the handy-man, was his master, and thus
bend his affections entirely in Vincent's
direction.
I knew enough of our real master to
be sure that directly he found out that
the dog liked Vincent more than him-
self he would lose interest in him and
let him go—give him away to the next
caller, or even sack Vincent and the dog
with him.
And so it was ; the schemo worked
perfectly. The little dog attached him-
self to Vincent with an adoring persist-
ence. Nothing could get him away, or,
if he were induced to go upstairs, he
was continually running to the door and
whining for (as he thought) his master.
Our real master was furious. “Con-
found the dog!” he used to say, or
“What's the use of a dog that doesn't
love you ?” And then he would lay
his hand on my head and say that at
any rate I was loving and faithful, until
1 didn't know where to look. And then
one day it all worked out as I had con-
ceived, and the little dog was given to a
neighbour. . . .
I have never been happy since, for he
was a faithful and brave little dog, and
my master and mistress would have
rejoiced in him, and I had robbed them
of a friend, and set a stone where my
heart should be, just through my vile
jealousy and selfishness; while as for
poor Vincent, he was heartbroken, and
he seemed to understand that I had a
paw in the business, for he was never
the same to me again.
Yes, I did a low thing, and I am
sorry for it. I did a thing that no
spaniel and gentleman ought to do. I
wish you would kick me once, hard, and
then I could die happy.
TIPS TO ART CRITICS.
THE modern art critic, however great
his knowledge, is often at a loss for
variety in his vocabulary. The difficulty
of saying the same thing about different
pictures and artists in different ways
has been experienced by every writer on
art. An eminent Academician only the
other day said he knew of an art critic
who wrote for eight papers. In order
to conceal your identity and to obviate the
snares of repetition, at least in the same
article, we suggest as the best model
the style of The Daily Telegraph. Say
RAPHAEL is your theme. Do not mention
his name more than once. He can be
described as-
1. “The lover of the Fornarina.”
2. “The divine Urbinate.”
3. “The great rival of MICHEL AN-
GEIo.”
4. “The great master of the Stanzie.”
5. “The favourite painter of Pope and
Peasant.”
6. “The pupil of Timoteo Viti.”
(N.B.--Do not say PERUGINo, or you will
be detected of insufficient knowledge of
the latest criticism; but you may refer
to him as the “gracious fellow-student
of PIETRO WANUcci.” This gets in some
erudition, and conveys to your readers
the other name of PERUGINO. Editors
are impressed.)
7. Finally, if you are very hard up,
“the precocious offspring of Glow ANNI
SANTI.”
CoROT, on the same principle, becomes:

l
1. “That nster of dawn and twi-
light.” -
2. “Parezellence the painter of Bar-
bizon.”
3. The mly peer of JEAN FRANÇols
MILLET.
4. “Tº protagonist of 1830.”
5. “Te master of Romanticism.”
6. “The father of modern landscape.”
7. “...he son (or sun, it does not
matte, which) of Nature's self.”
8. The heir of DEI.ACRoix.”
9. “The pioneer of plein airistes.”
I the picture to be criticised is a
lardscape, you can say either “the
alist has sacrific, d the values to his
tºnes; ” or “he has neglected tonality at
fie expense of his values; ” or “few
artists maintain that exact balance
between the tones and values which is
the peculiar prerogative of the born
artist;" or “the faculty for neglecting
both tones and values is indeed rare
among the modern exponents of land-
scape painting, though common enough
with certain deceased masters.”
If the picture is a subject work, say
Triumph of Bacchus, you have a freer
hand. “Few connoisseurs will accept
(or will refuse to accept) this new
delineation of the Greek wine-god; ” or
“the lover of Ariadne,” or the “Child of
Semele,” or “the Theban Deity,” or
“ that deity whose identity in Greek and
Roman mythology is inseparably con-
nected with the over-indulgence of
intoxicating liquors.” (N.B.-Don't call
him Tyrant of Syracuse).
A. AND B.
[In the Journal of Abnormal Psychology is
described the case of a lady who, owing to
nervous strain and shock, became two diſſerent
personalities, which suddenly alternated with
each other. The two states she called A and
B. As A she was a pattern of propriety; as
B she enjoyed doing what she knew would
annoy herself as A.]
A. WHENEVER I am A

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DiAny of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, February
16th. — “Uprouse ye then, my merry
merry men, For 'tis our opening day.”
Thus the poet, his fine eye in frenzy
rolling after the alleged manner of his
class. If it chance to roll over House of
Commons at this moment, with PRINCE
ARTHUR on his legs, the PREMIER waiting
to follow, the poet will acutely feel the
inappropriateness of his remark. "Tis
our opening day, pardieu. PRINCE
Althun, with the blare of the sum of
Biarritz on his brow, the health-giving
breezes from the Atlantic still coursing
in his veins, gallantly tries to do the
uprousing. But where are the merry,
merry men 2 Certainly not within these
four walls.
This, the Fourth Session of first
Parliament of the King. Trumpeted
abroad that momentous issues are to the
fore. Expected that straightway the
armed hosts marshalled on either side
would raise their battle-cry, and the
clang of arms would ring through the
Chamber, startling the porpoises in the
adjacent Thames.
That, in truth, is the purpose and
purport of debate on the Address. In
olden times, when giants lived, the
fight, whether short or long, was
strenuous, ending in exciting episodes
of division upon which the fate of
Ministry hung. Affair to-day has all
the dreary dulness of a sham fight.
Whether by accident or settled in-
tent, mover and seconder of Address
appear in civilian costume. As a rule
Members charged with this important
business fig themselves out in battle
array. Perfection of detail is achieved
when one doms Army uniform and the
other borrows the garments of a Naval
Officer. To-day mover and seconder
lisp their studied nothingnesses in
peaceful garb. Members seated near
secretly welcomed the innovation. The
unaccustomed sword has a way not only
of getting between the legs of the gallant
Colonel pro tem, or the Admiral of the
hour, but of prodding in the ribs inoffen-
sive legislators who chance to be near
the warriors. From that point of view
the levée dress is rather popular.
For the main body of Members it
struck a subtle note that made it idle to
think of possible conflict, and caused
the martial figures of NAPOLEON B.
HALDANE and ADMIRAL McKENNA to seem
unwarranted intrusions on Treasury
Bench. On PRINCE ARTHUR the effect
was dolorous. Helaboured along through
passages of King's Speech, languidly
picking holes in it. Once momentarily
roused to repel interruption from Irish
camp. Was talking about condition of
Ireland, which he deplored as anarchical.
RACK To EARTH AGAIN.
Mr. Will-be Right (after yet another marrellous display of dexterous steering and balance,
and of imperturbable coolness in his Fiscal Aeroplane). “REALLY, what babies. These TARIFF
REForMERs ARE!
I QUITE ENJoy These Little “TRIAL' Flights, AND I FLATTER MysELF THEY
GIVE ADSOLUTELY NOTHING AWAY THAT'S OF ANY USE TO ANYBoDY!”
“What about The Confederates ?”
shouted an Irish Member.
The inquiry certainly lacks the quality
of sequence. PRINCE ARTHUR was, as
angry as was Tristram Shandy's father
when, upon occasion, his wife enquired if
he had remembered to wind the clock.
Breeze only temporary. Leader of Oppo-
sition relapsed into dull dogged manner,
pounding along by the hour whilst
Members strolled out, and those who
remained to hear began to yawn.
Business done.-Parliament re-assem-
bled.
Wednesday.—Galleries still closed to
the public, male and female. The rows
of benches facing the Chair, often the
most crowded section, now a wilder-
mess in which occasionally, in the absence
of the rose, there blossoms a stray Peer.
As for Ladies' Gallery, for the first time
within memory of the janitor, the injunc-
tion “Silence!” printed in large letters
and prominently displayed on walls, is
obeyed.
St. AUGUSTINE, returning to Treasury
Bench in time for division, reports that
more or less lovely woman has again
stooped to folly. Been dining with
Certificated Grocers at Inauguration of
their Institute.
“What company,” he says, mopping
his brow and readjusting a worried
necktie, “could possibly be more re-
spectable than one composed of Certifi-
cated Grocers? In anticipation the mind
refused to connect them with anything

in the way of unseemly outburst of
emotion. And yet * *
St. AUGUSTINE wiped his parched lips
and shuddered as he thought of what
had passed since he left the House at
Question time.
A number of Suffragettes, purporting
to be wives or aunts of Certificated
Grocers, planted themselves in gallery
facing table at which sat the unsuspect-
ing Chief SECRETARY. When he got on
his legs in response to toast of Houses
of Parliament, one simultaneously rose
with mild remark that she had another
toast, “which I am sure ” she re-
marked, glancing round the startled
audience.
The Certificated rose to their feet
as one Grocer. Rushed up to the
gallery with intent to remove the mal-
content as if she were a faulty cheese
or a tub of butter not free from sus-
picion of rancidness. . Alack they
found her chained to the balcony as
last Session one of her sisters betrayed
an attachment to grille of cage in House
of Commons. Assisted by three waiters
(who hoped the extra duty would be
remembered in the bill), the Certificated
Grocers tugged away at the chained
damosel. From her side sprang up
another, with clanking chains and per-
sistent inquiry as to the approximate
date when the question of votes for
women might be expected to find a
place in the Ministerial Programme.
There was loud cry for files; but
Certificated Grocers going out
to dine with a Cabinet Minister
don't habitually carry files in their
pockets. If it had been a cheese-
taster, now. Presently one of the
agitated waiters returned from
successful search for files. The
fetters were loosed, the damosels
thrust forth, and the flow of St.
AUGUSTINE’s golden eloquence pro-
ceeded thenceforward uninter-
rupted.
“I think in future I shall take
a snack in the House,” he whis-
pered in sympathetic ear of PRE-
MIER, who had been privileged to
dine in peace.
Business done.—Labour Mem-
bers, moving Amendment to Ad-

House of Lords, Thursday. —
The MEMBER FOR SARK, an expert
in the matter, says to see Lord
CREwe carrying the Crown in the
Royal Procession last Tuesday was
a lesson in deportment. His tall
figure, slightly bowed in recogni-
tion of the precious charge dis-
played on the crimson velvet
cushion held in nervous hands, moved
with quiet footfall, as if he were enter-
ing a church. His face wore a deſer-
ential expression which reflected upon
the emblem of sovereignty a fresh glow
of sanctity.
This no new thing. CREWE per-
forms all the functions of his Minis-
terial estate with inborn grace, cul-
tured courtliness of manner. It was
characteristic that, failing performance
of the duty on the side of the
House which, whilst he lived, Lord
Robertson adorned, it was he who
voiced the common regret at withdrawal
of the familiar figure from the historic
scene. Whether in the Commons as Lord
Advocate, or in the Upper House as
a Lord of Appeal, Robertson ranked
among the most effective debaters.
Endowed with what the late Lord
GRANVILLE once aptly described as “the
cross-bench mind,” he, though a strong
Party man, never displayed the tiresome
monotony of the partisan. He was
capable of recognising good or evil on
both sides, expressing his opinion in
sentences exquisitely framed, lambent
with irony. Through the Autumn
Session he was here, apparently in good
health, certainly in fullest possession of
his unrivalled intellectual gifts. By his
sudden, almost tragic, death the House
suffers the loss of one of its chief
Ornaments.

It was a week later that I met Eliza-

“Well,” she said, “have you got your

“I haven't,” I confessed.
“I forget who you said you were

“Somebody who had black hair,” I
said. “I have been thinking it over
and I have come to the conclusion that
I should have knocked them rather if I
had had black hair. Instead of curly
eyes and blue hair. Can you think of
anybody for me?”
Queen Elizabeth regarded me as
sternly as she might have regarded—
Well, I'm not very good at history.
“Do you mean to say,” she said at
last, “that that is as far as you have
got? Somebody who had black hair?”
“Hang it,” I protested, “it’s some-
thing to have been measured for the
wig.”
“Hare you been measured for your
wig 2" -
“Well—er—no.

That is to say, not
exactly what you might call measured.

along now, only—I say, where do I get

nervously, “I’ve done an awful lot,

cry. I've got an awful cold.”

they can't prove he didn't, seeing when
he lived. He flourished about 770, you

going to take you in hand. Will you
trust yourself entirely to me?”
“To the death, your Majesty. I'm

[FEBRUARY 24, 1909.
A T T H E PLAY.
I.—“THE TRUANTs.”
I HAVE been thinking it over carefully,
and I have decided to refuse Lady
Darnarray's kind invitation to Nether-
cote Grange for the week-end. The life
there is too strenuous for me, the people
too unexpected. There is Pamela Grey,
for instance. A mice bright girl, of
course; but she does Maud Allan dances
in the hall—in the hall, of all places.
And her ideas generally are quite ad-
vanced ; particularly the idea of run-
ning away to Buenos Ayres, with a
bounder called Bill, in the hope of
getting married out there. By the way,
only a week ago I had the tip straight
from the stable as to the currect pro-
nunciation of “Buenos Ayres,” and I
may say that Bill pronounces it wrong
—which is a pity, as he used to live
there. But he has worse faults than
that. He swears like anything, and
is most confoundedly rude to every-
body. Dick Chetwood, his cousin,
is quite a decent sort; if he were
the only one there, I shouldn't mind
going. Freda, to whom Dick is
engaged, is rather a dear, but a bit
too ready with the revolver for my
taste. You know, she held up Bill
in Pamela's bedroom the other day,
and threatened to shoot him if he
didn't give up the elopement idea.
Well, I mean there's a jolly house !
As it happened, Bill was only
winged, but it might lave been
pretty serious. Then there's Strel-
land — Lord Strelland, -a political
peer, I suppose. Of all the smug-
voiced tallow-chandlers, commend
me to him. And he was a fair brute to
Freda.
Yes, I shall have to refuse Lady
Darnaway's kind invitation. There is
too much slapping and screaming, cry-
ing and cursing, knocking things down,
and flinging things about. And shooting.
Besides, they do find out your secrets at
Nethercote Grange. A most unpleasant
way they have of L- Well, of course I
shouldn't mind anyone knowing really,
only However, as I said, I am
refusing the invitation.
All the same, I must congratulate
Mr. W. T. Coleby. His comedy is im-
probable, some of his people bellave in
an extraordinary way, and he has
dragged in a Third Act which was
unnecessary; but in Bill and Pamela
(admirably interpreted by Mr. DENNIS
EADIE and Miss ATHENE SEYLER) he really
has given us two fresh characters.
For this, as well as for the pleasure
of seeing Miss LENA Ashwell, in a
part suited to her, the regular playgoer
will consider The Kingsway well worth
a visit.
II.-‘‘THE HIGII BID.”
The “Afternoon Theatre's" second
production at His Majesty's is a comedy
by Mr. HENRY JAMEs. The stage is a
great leveller; if the literary aspirant
turned from his novel of literary life to
write a play he would, I am sure, choose
some such plot as that of The High Bid.
Captain Yule's ancient house was
mortgaged to Mr. Prodmore, an impos-
sible financier. Mr. Prodmore, however,
promised to restore it to him free of all
encumbrances, provided that he changed
his politics, married Miss Prodmore, and
stood for the division. (It was a Tory
seat, and he was a Radical.) Mrs. Grace-
dew, an American widow, with the
American's love of old English houses,
knowing nothing of the part Prodmore's
daughter was to play in the transaction,
urges him to change his political con-
victions, and keep his house. He pre-

dew learns (1)—to her dismay—that he
has also to marry Miss Prodmore ; (2)—
to her joy—that Miss Prodmore is
secretly engaged to somebody else. In
the end, of course, the widow buys back
the house from the financier and offers it
and herself to the captain. -
The aristocratic Radical is no new
character to Mr. JAMEs ; indecd Mr.
JAMES should have a friendly feeling for
him by now. Why, then, does he make
him out a dishonourable cad? Captain
Yule, as played by Mr. Formes Robert-
SON, is for the first half of the comedy a
gallant gentleman, the soul of chivalry
and honour. I felt as I watched him
how unutterably childish Prodmore was
to offer such a man his silly “condi-
tions.” And then Yule calmly announces
(to the woman he is beginning to love!)
that, following her advice, he has con-
sented to sell his honour; and further,
to marry a girl to whom he has hardly
spoken. Was there ever anything more
outrageous? And what of Mrs.Gracedew 2
It would be like a woman, I admit, to
urge a man to break his faith in order
pares to do this; whereupon Mrs. Grace-l.
to keep his house; but surely much
more like a woman to despise him aſter-
wards for doing it at her suggestion.
There is a literary charm about the
dialogue which is very attractive, but
Mr. JAMEs lets his characters talk too
much. They make their point in two
lines and then go on for ten lines more,
so as to be quite sure of it. This makes
the brighter part of the audience im-
patient. Mr. HENRY JAMES is much too
leisurely for the stage.
None the less, a most interesting
experiment, which owed much to Mr.
Forbes RoberTSON, Miss GERTRUDE
ELLIoTT and Miss Esmé HUBBARD. The
last-named, as Cora Prodmore, gave a
delightſul reading to a delightfully-
drawn character. M.
GREAT AUTHORS’ STRUGGLES.
[Special interviews; with apologies to
“The Bookman.”]
“For years,” said Mr. WILLIAM
LE QUEUx, “I struggled without
success. I averaged a novel a
month, and yet the financial results
were almost negligible. At last
one morning the postman called
with a parcel on which there was
6d. to pay. I thought it was one of
my novels come home to roost, and
wondered whether I should waste
the money on it. "It some in-
describable impulse compelled me
to take the parcel in, and when I
tore it open there was a jewelled
scimitar from the SUITAN of MoROCCo.
From that day I have never looked
back, but only sideways—to see
how the scimitar looks as it clanks
against my near calf.”
“No,” said Mr. HoRNUNG, “the rewards
of literature are scanty and the strain of
the work is immense. I should not
advise any young man in whom I took
an interest to pursue a literary career.
For my own part I gave up literature
long since add took to burglary, which
I find infinitely more lucrative.” .
The Lord of Greeba Castle shook his
head. “Struggles of literary men
Ah, the tragedy of such a career. Shall
I ever forget the financial result of one
of my first and greatest novels, The
Bondwoman. It was in agony that I
conceived that work and eventually
brought it to perfection. At last it was
placed before the world, and I awaited
an account from my publishers. When
I opened their letter and saw the
miserable result of twelve months' labour
—a paltry cheque for £10,000 0s. 9d.—
I am not ashamed to say that I shed hot
tears of sorrow. But my spirit was
unbroken, I struggled on, and now”—
a smile stole over the great man's face—
“they have to pay me a pound a word
—punctuation marks to count also.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN The Gifted Family (METHUEN), Mr. BARRY PAIN has
written a delightful novel—no other word will serve so well
to express the quality of the book. It is interesting from
the first page to the last, and its characters are observed
and described with a care that is both kindly and humorous.
There is a persuasive charm about Mr. BARRY PAIN's writing
which appeals with convincing force to his readers, and
ranges them on his side and on the side of the persons who
live and move through his pages. The Prendergast family
is an array of little talents. With one exception each member
of it has his or her own particular inoffensive and ineffective
gift in art or music or letters. Papa admires MEREDITII and
scheme should depend on recruiting by methods that suggest
the charity bazaar, or a newspaper boom in the dull season,
rather than the systematic development of the resources of
the country for the purpose of Home Defence.
Mr. ANTRIM ORIEI, seems to have decided on making an
omelette and then discovered that his chickens (they are
turkey poults by the way) have been unexpectedly hatched.
The Miracle (CoNSTABLE) is bound in bright yellow boards,
and begins with a complimentary dedication to the Young
Turk Party, so that I expected to read a story about the
Y. T. P. candidate for Jericho; but as a matter of fact the
book is an intelligent appreciation of events in the Near East
during 1908, written upon the assumption that the state of
Islam is hopelessly rotten. Seizing the opportunity of ABLUL
HAMID's demise, Bulgaria is made to declare war, and receive

lectures on him ; one of the daughters is musical, another
dramatic ; and lºred has a turn for drawing. All, in fact,
are gifted, except Sandra, the youngest, who has no special
talent except for making people love her. She, indeed,
shows that there is an art of life, and that it is more than
all the other arts. She trembles on the brink of tragedy,
but Fate and Mr. BARRY PAIN and her own sweet nature are
kind to her, and she reaches happiness. I repeat that
this is a delightful book.
Critics, armchair and otherwise, have said that the Terri-
torial Army scheme is all very well on paper, especially when
the paper is excellent and nicely bound. A new book on
the subject, The Territorial Force (MURRAy), I think is good;
yet it does not leave one satisfied that all is as it should be,
for no one can read either Mr. HALDANE's introduction or
Mr. HAROLD BAKER's clear exposition of the main facts relating
to the organisation, administration, and discipline of our
civilian army without regretting that the success of the
the moral support of England and Russia; a British legion
goes to the front, assisted by the heroine (daughter of Sir
Elgar Howard, the Foreign Secretary) in the part of a trained
nurse, and the Turk is swept back to the gates of Stamboul.
So it turns out (as the epilogue informs us) that the
“miracle” is not a description of the story at all, but merely
an expression of the author's surprise that he has made a
bad shot at prophesying. But parts of the book, which only
numbers 265 pages (and especially the account of the decisive
battle at Kuleli Burgas), are so brilliantly written that one
wishes there was a great deal more; and if, as I suspect, the
Young Turks interrupted Mr. ORIEI, before he had properly
finished, it was very tiresome of them. I think, however, that
it was a pity to discuss the characters of living English
statesmen without making the smallest effort to disguise
their identities; and a little rash (considering the title) to
give a certain newspaper the name of The Daily Miracle:
the cowslip has surely no right to call the buttercup
'yellow.

Smilingly hopeless of the victor's guerdon
And that reminds me—one last word:—
Don't be a Peer; it really would be too absurd .

Science Notes.
THE THREATENED SLUMP IN Moonshine.
Sir GEORGE DARWIN's prediction that the moon, once part
of our earth, will recede to a greater distance, has given a
considerable impulse to the manufacture of coon-songs and
other minor poetry dealing with an orb in which the interest
of the reading public is likely before long to decline materially.
THE RESTING CLASSEs.
The official statement that the pace of the earth's rotation
is decreasing, and that eventually every day will be fifty-five
times as long as the present allowance of twenty-four hours,
is viewed with favour by Trades Unionists, who hope by
that time to have secured a general eight-hours working-day,
which will leave an ample margin of 1312 hours per diem
for meals, recreation, and repose.
CROSS-EXAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME ;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's Road To KNowLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; his sister Mabel, aged 18.)
Little Arthur. I say, Mabs.
Mabel. Yes, Arthur, what is it?
L. A. Didn't you say you wanted votes for women 2
Mabel. Of course I do; and so do all women who are
worthy of the name; and we shall get them, too.
L. A. Oh, but I say, I heard Mamma say she didn't want
to vote; and she said a lot of other things, Mabs, you know
she did. Isn't Mamma
Mabel. Oh, Mamma; she's different. -
L. A. But she's a woman all right, isn't she? And we
ought to do what Mamma wants, oughtn't we?
Mabel. Yes, yes, of course, in most things; but Mamma
hasn't thought about these things; she's got so many other
things to do; and then she has the old-fashioned ideas.
L. A. Then is it only new-fashioned people who want
votes for women? Because it says (referring to newspaper)
that some of the ladies arrested last time were not at all
young. Some of them were more than forty. Aren't they
old-fashioned 2 - -
Mabel. I'm afraid you're too young to understand these
things. * • - - -
L. A. Yes, Mabs; but I should like to try, you know.
Papa told me to try. * - - - -
Mabel. Yes, Arty, that's quite right.
and I’ll help you. . ;
L. A. Thank you, Mabs.
Mabel. Yes, dear. º
L. A. Why do you want a vote, Mabs?
Mabel. We want to have a share in the government of the
country. We hold that we ought to become the equals of
men, and that we ought to be so treated. We believe in the
great principle of no taxation without representation.
L. A. Oh, Mabs, that does sound splendid But, Mabs,
you don't pay taxes, do you ?
Mabel. No-not yet.
L. A. Then, is paying taxes a very nice thing 2
Mabel. Well, I'm not sure it's so very mice.
L. A. No, I thought not; because Papa's always quite
furious about paying his taxes. You know, Mabs, he's
always in a temper about them.
Mabel. Yes, he is. I know Papa's look when the taxes
come in.
L. A. But if they're such beastly things, why do you
want them for yourself 2
Mabel. I don't. -
L. A. But if you want a vote you must have the taxes
first, mustn't you? Hadn't you better stay as you are,
Mabs 2
Mabel. Never. -
L. A. Oh, then, I suppose a vote is something splendid.
It makes up for taxes 2 -
Mabel. I don't say that.
L. A. No; Papa doesn't either. He said at the last elec-
tion he was dashed if he'd vote for either of them. He said
one was as bad as the other, and a vote was more nuisance
than it was worth.
Mabel. That's Papa all over.
L. A. Yes; but Papa knows about it.
and he doesn't like it.
Mabel. But we say that women have a higher sense of
duty than men. They are more ready to recognise the re-
sponsibilities of citizenship. They see things more clearly
and take juster views.
L. A. Then you think women are really better than men,
Mabs 2 -
You go on trying,
But I say— . .
He's got a vote

THE BEETLE.
WHENCE comes the beetle? Has he been pursued
Into the dark recesses of his lair?
Did any mortal ever see him there?
Was any beetle ever interviewed ?
How comes it that he can and does elude
The wiles of Keating and the baited snare,
Discriminating with the nicest care
What may be eaten, what must be eschewed 2
Wain questions these; for beetles as a race
Were always mysteries. They ebb and flow;
By night emerging from that mystic place
Where through the daylight hours they undergo
Enforced seclusion, with averted face,
In darkness such as only beetles know.

THE RETURN OF THE LION.
[“The Lusitania arrived yesterday at Liver-
pool from New York. She had on board 400
passengers, 332,000 dollars, 1,570 sacks of
mails, and Mr. Sandy Kilter.”—Daily Press,
passim..]
No sooner was the Lusitania sighted
than the Scotchmen of Liverpool, rein-
forced by detachments of Scotchmen
from Manchester, London, and other
places where they abound, formed them-
selves into battalions and marched to
the docks, playing and singing national
alts.
On Mr. Sandy Kilter's exhibiting him-
self in full Scotch costume on the
captain's bridge, they set up a cheer
which could be heard in the Isle of Man,
and seriously annoyed Mr. HALL CAINE.
On arriving within hail Mr. Sandy
Kilter, who had left Euston some weeks
before with the parting words on his
lips, “God bless you till I come back,”
shouted, “Here I am, you see, as sound
as a Scotch blue-bell.” The guard of
welcome then broke unanimously into a
Highland fling, which endured until the
little man was in their midst, when they
pulled him nearly to pieces out of pure
joy. On discovering, however, that his
American fortune was not on his person,
but in a strong box on board, his
countrymen desisted and permitted the
interviewers to get at him.
In honour of this unique occasion–
the return of England's darling—the
great papers, represented usually by
reporters, had sent each its editor-in-
chief, a select few of whom had acquired
by ballot the privilege of a few words
with the hero.
Mr. Sandy Kilter, in conversation with
the editor of The Spectator, computed
that during his visit to America he was
heard by 150,000 persons who paid for
the entrée and an unknown quantity
that did not. His hand was wrung
14,000 times, and the breath expended
in saying, “Good old Sandy,” if em-
ployed as motive power, would turn the
sails of the Moulin Rouge for three years.
To the interviewer of The Daily Mail
Mr. Sandy Kilter said that he had sung
before President RooseVELT. The Presi-
dent had not his gun with him.
Mr. Sandy Kilterexpressed the opinion
to the editor of The Manchester Guardian
that if Columbus had never seen an egg
he, Mr. Kilter, would be some millions of
bawbees the poorer. America, he said,
is the most wonderful country, filled
with the warmest hearts, in the world.
Mr. Sandy Kilter confided to the editor
of The Standard that he earned two
dollars a minute waking or sleeping all
the time he was in America.
Asked pointedly by the editor of The
Pall Mall Gazette why he did not return
to Scotland for a few weeks at any rate
of the year, Mr. Sandy Kilter replied that
he remained in England and America
because he liked to be among his
countrymen.
Conversing with the editor of The
Morning Post, Mr. Sandy Kilter said that
the drawback to America was the paucity
of haggises. He had seen only four
all the time he had been there, and two
of these were eaten by Big BiLL TAFT
before he (Mr. Kilter) could get at them.
Interviewed by the editor of The
Guardian, Mr. Sandy Kilter said that
America was the greatest country he had
ever struck. It extended from the
Atlantic to the Pacific and back again.
Asked by the editor of The Times if he
was intending to return to America soon,
Mr. Sandy Kilter said that he could not
yet say for certain, but whether he went
or not he had written a new song to
convince his countrymen that whatever
his movements might be his heart was
true to Scotland. The chorus ran :—
I'm Fº day and night, nae matter whaur
gang,
It's Scotland whaur I fain would be, I leave it
wi' a pang;
I leave it wi' a pang, ye ken, and when I've
made my pile
I'm gaein' back to Scotland, boys, to spend it
wi' a smile. - -
But I warn ye, never fear,
That the gettin' o' the gear
May tak’ your little Sandy boy a bonny lang
while !

[MARch 3, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
After the interviewers and photo-
graphers had all finished, Mr. Sandy
Kilter was allowed to enter the train,
but he had first to receive a beautiful
gold-mounted slogan, on which was
engraved the date and record of the
historic occasion.
At Euston another ceremony awaited
the famous singer, when the PRIME
MINISTER and Mr. HALDANE (represent-
ing our Scottish Cabinet) received him
and presented an address of welcome.
He was then escorted to his home at
Tooting by a guard of honour drawn
from the Black Watch.
PERCY.
Do you play Percy? It is a jolly
game, though long and intricate. I
fancy I won last might, but I can't be
certain.
The first thing that Iremember clearly
was hearing somebody say, “It’s your
turn.” So I turned to my neighbour
and said, “What have I got to do?”
A man opposite me, who seemed to know
all about it, said, “We want a sentence
of three words beginning with “B.” I
thought a long time, and then said:
“Bulls buzz badly.”
“That doesn't make sense,” he said.
“Why not ?” I asked. “Bees buzz,
don't they 2”
“Of course.”
B º Well, you told me to begin with a
“Yes, but——”
“All right, here's another one. Black-
beetles bar Beef-tea. That's sense
enough, anyhow.”
So then we went on to C. After a
time I had on my piece of paper a short
list of representative facts, which could
be arranged in some sort of order, thus:
NATURAL. History.
Anchories always "||.
Blackbeetles bar Beef-tea. (I don't
blame them.)
Giraffes gargle grandly. (This is
obvious.)
Unicorns uphold undervests. (This I
am not so certain of).
Eccles ASTIC.
Can Churchwardens cough 2
Elephants envy Episcopalians. (Silly.)
Iledgehogs hum hymns.
FINANCIAL.
Fantis fell flat.
(Note:-" Fanti” is a mine. . This
fact is alleged and without prejudice.
The management cannot be held re-
sponsible for accidents on the rink.)
Still, LIFE.
Bull's-eyes barely bounce.
PoliticAL.
Marquises mostly meditate.
Votes for Women.
And so on. This does not pretend to
be complete, but it forms the foundation
of a trustworthy reference book.
Well, just as I was getting set I was
picked up and led to another table and
given a pair of scissors and a packet of
pins. While I was moralising to myself
that Pins prick Princes and Scissors
sometimes sciss, my attention was
called to a bowl of water in which
several corks were floating, and a man
opposite, who seemed to know all about
it, told me to pick the pins up with the
scissors and see how many I could stick
into one particular cork. This is a thing
I had never previously wanted to do.
At the end of a quarter of an hour I
had stuck twenty pins into the bottom
of the bowl, and one (I still believe)
into the bottom of the cork. That,
however, will never be known for cer-
tain, for the game took another sudden
turn, and I found myself gazing at a
small pack of cards and saying, “Cards
comfort camels.” Then, as I was feel-
ing in my pocket for a pin, my right-
hand neighbour said:
“You know how to play, don't you?”
“I’m learning,” I said cautiously.
“Well, it's quite easy. You deal thir-
teen cards, and then what you want to
do is
“The point is,” said my left-hand
neighbour, “to get out as many cards –
“For instance, supposing you had a
red knave there and a black ten there,
then——”
“Of course an ace goes out at once.”
“The whole object is——”
“Perhaps,” said the man opposite,
who seemed to know all about it, “I
can make it clearest by putting it in this
way. Now suppose 3.
At this moment (there are points about
Percy) a man whom I had never seen
before came up to my left-hand neigh-
bour and said, “Shall we go down to
supper?” Now, give me a lead and
I’m over like a bird. I turned to my
right-hand neighbour and said, “Let’s
go too; ” and I added, as we went off,
“Leonard loves lobster.” After that I
did not talk much for half-an-hour.
The game now became very fast. I
was given another pencil, a pair of
scissors (I think), and a piece of paper
on which an old lady next to me had
written a line of poetry. The man
opposite, who knew all about the game,
told me to write underneath it a line
rhyming to it. The old lady's line was—
“There was a little boy who had
blue eyes and hair of gold.”
I wrote:
“That line is in no metre at all, but
if we aren't bothering about metre and
gow only want a rhyme I don't mind
adding that his feet were cold.”
Then I folded it up, turned to my
left-hand neighbour, and said, “Shall
we go down to supper?” And I added,
“Archibald adores asparagus.” Now
there must be some rule in the game
that I hadn't quite mastered, for we had
only got as far as the door when I was
asked to wait a moment. I waited a
moment, and was immediately seized by
somebody else and given two pencils and
a bowl of marbles.
“What do you do?” asked the girl
on my right.
“It’s quite easy,” I said. “Suppose
you have a black knave there, and a red
ten there But perhaps I can show
it you best with a figure,” and I began
to sharpen one of the pencils.
“No,” said somebody, “you have to
take the marbles out of the bowl, and
put them on the table.”
I put the pencil down and proceeded
to do this. When I had been doing it
for some hours the man opposite, who
certainly knew all about it, looked up
at me and said very sternly, “With the
pencils.” Before I was able to begin
again, I was handed a packet of pins
(or something) and asked to think of a
living poet beginning with A.
“I don't know her name,” I said,
“but just now xx
By this time I had scored four hun-
dred-and-seventy-eight, and I was gene-
rally supposed to be in the running for a
prize. I did something with a needle
and a piece of string which gave me
twenty more, and then settled down to
a really steady game with the scissors
and a pack of cards. I had just dealt
these round, and was preparing (under
the direction of the man opposite) to
say “Snap!” when my right-hand
neighbour, who was leading me by five
only, got up and went across to a com-
petitor with two pencils, and said, “I
must really be going now ; it has been
a perfectly delightful evening.” I was
not going to be beaten on the post, so I
did the same. Then I was handed my
hat and coat, and asked to think of——
It was some time before I realised
what had happened, and then I decided
to think of a hansom.

It is a very jolly game. The rules, as
I say, are a little difficult, but you soon

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 153
PUNCH,
THE centenary court.
THE first day's proceedings in the
newly established Centenary Court at-
tracted a good deal of attention, because
a large section of the newspaper-public
had begun to resent the practice of
substituting memorial articles about
DARwn and LINoolN, Sir John MooRE
and Mrs. BROWNING, for real live news of
the day. The Court, as constituted by
an Order in Council “For the Better
Supervision of Semi-Jubilees, Jubilees,
Diamond Jubilees, Radium Jubilees,
Centenaries and Ter-Jubilees, and in
restraint of Indiscriminate Memorialis-
ing,” consisted of Lord AVEBURY, author
of the Hundred Best Books, Dr. W. G.
GRACE, compiler of a Hundred Centuries,
Mr. A. C. Swinburne, author of A
Century of Roundels, Mr. CLEMENT K.
SHORTER, author of The Old Brontë
Hundredth, and the Steward of the
Chiltern Hundreds. The Court, at its
first session, co-opted as legal assessor
Mr. Justice DARLING, author of the
Hundred Least Jokes. -
Lord Avebury opened proceedings by
observing that centenary was derived
from the Latin centum, meaning a hun-
dred, and that it had been shown to be
possibletocelebrate the centenary either of
a great man's birth or his death, or even
both. If he might, without vanity, use
a personal illustration, it would be prac-
ticable for his own birth-centenary to be
celebrated in 1934. Provided that the
date of a person's birth had been accu-
rately registered, there could seldom be
any serious difficulty in calculating the
incidence of his birth-centenary. On
the other hand, the centenary of the
death of an eminent person could never
be fixed with anything more than
approximate accuracy during his life-
time. He made these observations in
no spirit of self-seeking, but only for the
information of the Court.
He wished also to indicate some general
rules of procedure. In the case of a minor
celebrity, not likely to be found worthy
of a centenary, the Court might be
prepared to make an order for a Jubilee.
Again, if an eminent person had duly
celebrated his centenary—the test of
celebration to be leading articles in at
least five morning papers and an illus-
trated page in The Sphere or The Taller
—the Court should never refuse a Ter-
Jubilee order, when the time arrived.
He was not so clear about Bi-centen-
aries; because it might be said that a man
who had been centenarised and ter-jubi-
leed--if he might be allowed to coin two
words which had not the authority of the
Oxford Dictionary (possibly, in the latter
case, because that monumental work
had not yet reached the letter T)—ought
to be ready to make way for some other
eminent man who had been less fortu-

nate. However, what the Court had
chiefly to keep in view was the public
interest, which would suffer if the wrong
people were commemorated. In such
an Annus Mirabilis as 1909, a nicer
scrutiny should be applied to applicants
who, in ordinary years, would be less
severely criticised. They would now
take the first case.
Mr. CLEMENT. K. SHORTER said that he
appeared to support an application on
behalf of the immortal memory of
Thomas HAYNES BAYLY, the Radium
Jubilee of whose death would fall on
April 22.
MR. JUSTICE DARLING. Should this ap-
plication mot come before the New Old
Bailey? (No laughter.)
Mr. Swinburne. Never heard of BAYLY.
What was he ”
MR. SHORTER. A poet. He wrote I’d
be a Butterfly, We met, 'twas in a
Crowd, and She wore a Wreath of Roses.
DR. GRACE. 1 remember when I was a
lad at school that we had a rhyme which
began like that:
She wore a wreath of roses,
It was in the month of June,
And we stood on the bridge at midnight
Throwing snowballs at the moon.
LoRD Avebury. That sounds a little
as if somebody had been making fun of
the poem. At least it does not sound to
me quite like a serious poem. Don't
you think it is a joke, Mr. DARLING 2
MR. JUSTICE DARLING. I always thought
it was a personal pronoun. (The Steward
of the Chiltern Hundreds laughs doubt-
fully. LoRD AVEBURY looks perplexed.)
Mr. Swinburne. You say that BAYLY
was a poet. Did he write “desire” as
a word of two or three syllables 2
Mr. SHORTER. He never wrote it at all.

tion ?
Mr. Shorter : Only a little, my lord.
I should like to call Mr. ANDREW LANG.
Mr. JUSTICE DARLING (hurriedly)—
Man wants but little here below,
But wants that little Lang.
LoRD Avebury. I think the last word
should be “long,” Mr. DARLING. It is
not a Scotch poem. -
Mr. LANG, sworn, deponed that he
knew Thomas HAYNES BAYLY as a minor
pre-and-very-early-Victorian poet, about
whom he had once written an article.
He desired to express no opinion on the
eligibility of BAYLY for a Jubilee. But
it seemed to him hardly in the best of
taste to hold public rejoicings because a
minimus poet had died seventy years
ago. As a journalist he appreciated
Mr. SHORTER's anxiety to have a page
about BAYLY in The Sphere this April,
instead of waiting for the centenary of
his death in 1939, or the bi-centenary of
his birth in 1997. He understood, of
course, that the writing of memorial
articles was now an industry of consider-
able importance.
Lond Avebury. Perhaps, if you could
quote some little thing written by the
applicant, it might clear the mind of the
Court.
Mr. JUSTICE DARLING (in a whisper).
Perhaps it might clear the Court.
Mr. ANDREW LANG. Let me see. Tum,
tum, tum:—
Oh, no! we never mention her,
Her name is never heard;
Our lips are now forbid to speak
That once familiar word.
I cannot but recall her with
Some feelings of regret;
'Tis true she married Mr. Smith,
But ah! can I forget?
LoRD AveBURY. Thank you, Mr. LANG.
I think I like the second verse best.
MR. LANG. I thought you would. I
wrote the second verse myself. It
always seems to me about the best
thing that BAYLY never did.
MR. Swinburne. Does Mr. LANG claim
to have written any more of BAYLY's
poems ? -
DR. GRACE. I think that is a very
proper question. It would affect BAYLY's
place in the averages if he was allowed
a substitute to bat for him.
MR. LANG. No. I wrote only that
verse. I had no time to write any
more of BAYLY.
LoRD Avebury. Nevertheless, I think
the application might be granted.
MR. Justice DARLING. I concur, if Mr.
SHORTER will enter into two sureties that
THOMAS HAYNES BAYLY is really dead,
and that this application is not a pub-
lisher's device to boom some living
poet of the same name.
DR. GRACE. Where was BAYLY born ?
MR. SHORTER. At Bath.
DR. GRACE. Then he was nearly a
Gloucester man.
At this point proceedings abruptly
terminated, the Court being rushed by
a band of minor poets carrying a
banner with the devices “HoNour THE
LIVING” and “WE ARE STARVING.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRActED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February
22nd.—When Orders of the Day were
called on, PREMIER was in something
that looked like tight place. Still
harping on the many-stringed Address.
Parliament met a little later than usual.
After last year's experience, not disposed
to make up for it by sitting on through
August. Urgent business waiting.
Ordinary assembly of picked men would
without an hour's delay put their hand
to it. Mother of Parliaments not an
ordinary assembly. Of a possible maxi-
mum of twenty-five weeks in Session,
to-night sees close of one passed in pur-
poseless chatter. Nor is it ended yet.
Practically two weeks, freshest of Ses-
sion, will be appropriated for what no
man who has heard the discussion, in
less marked degree no one who has read
report of it, would regard as of any
practical advantage either to individuals
or the State.
At end of July, when hours are pre-
cious, legislative work will be scamped
or abandoned because there is no time
to carry it through. Ministers would
then give a peerage to any man who
could restore this wasted fortnight.
| What would you? It's a way we have
at Westminster. Consecrated by age, it
will continue through all coming Ses-
sions, renewing its youth like the eagle.
What happens to-night has by com-
parison some semblance of reality. Ever
since Parliament elected there has been
|
“A RATHER WEAK Governess.”
(Mr. Birrell as described by Lord Dunraven.)

DEFERRED PREFERENCE.
The Prime Minister. “Notice him? Of course I notice him
He remains the ‘Dominating
Issue,' but I've a lot of little things to see to before I get rid of him 1"
promise of fight to a finish with House
of Lords. Whilst he was yet with us,
C.-B. longed to be at 'em, a desire not
exceeded in earnestness by the mutual
yearning of Sir RICHARD STRACHAN and
the Earl of CHATHAM. Several times
went very near naming precise date for
opening fight. ASQUITH more cautious.
Not less emphatic in denunciation, but
vaguer in terms indicating period of
settlement. Nevertheless, aggravated
by rejection of Licensing Bill, he pub-
licly invited the Liberal Party to “treat
the veto of the House of Lords as the
dominating issue.”
“Very well,” said the Liberal Party,
and began to take its coat off with an
alacrity that would have disconcerted
Mr. Winkle.
When Session opened, eagerly turned
to King's Speech in expectation of find-
ing definite challenge written therein.
Not a word about it. So to-night stal-
warts below Gangway encourage Pon-
SONDY to raise flag of revolt; moved what
PREMIER in opening sentence of reply
was careful to point out was a Vote of
Censure on the Government. Suppose it
were carried, out would go the Minis-
try, and then where would you be?
Position certainly awkward. Asquith
surmounted it with accustomed skill.
Reiterated his denunciation of the Lords.
But his proud spirit spurned dictation
by them as to precise occasion or date
of Dissolution. Hands still full of good
work. Once it was fully fashioned,
then let noble Lords look out.
When Division called, only 21 Radicals
and Labour Members (helping to make
a minority of 47) rallied round the per-
tinacious Ponsonby, 225 approving the
waiting policy dexterously expounded
by the PREMIER.

[MARCH 3, 1900.
Business done.—Fiſth night of debate
on Address.
Tuesday.—Good Unionists are begin-
ning to look askance at Captain CRAIG.
A grim story from Russia recently told
how discovery had been made that a
trusted member of secret society was
actually what Mr. Hills would call a
Confederate, arranging with the Police
attempted outrages. Can it be that the
Member for East Division of Down has
secret relations with St. AUGUSTINE, and
at his Machiavellian suggestion dis-
credits cause of Law and Order in
Ireland by making it appear ridiculous
at Westminster?
Suspicion absolutely unfounded.
Nevertheless, uneasiness of Ulster Mem-
bers to certain extent justified. To-day
gallant Captain puts pistol to head of
Chief SECRETARY, and insists upon know-
ing how many arrests were made in
connection with the midnight attack on
Lieutenant-Colonel Vivian RYAN-LENI-
GAN's house, Castlefogarty. (The postal
address seems borrowed from one of
LEVER's novels.)
It turns out, according to police re-
port, that “the midnight attack” was
comprehended in the throwing of a
stone through the window of unoccupied
house.
Nothing daunted, CRAIG asks another.
Wants to know how many arrests were
made in connection with the disturb-
ances at Thurles on Sunday, January 3?
Again the matter-of-fact police
report shows that “the out- I
break” on the day named
was occasioned by a number
of small boys playing tin
whistles and beating tin cans.
Their desperate leader, aged
13, was summoned to Petty
Sessions. Magistrate showed
sense of enormity of offence by
fining him a penny.
House laughs; those con-
cerned for maintenance of
peace in Ireland think it no
laughing matter. It happens
that these cases were gravely
cited on threshold of debate
on angry indictment of Irish
Executive submitted with
authority of Front Opposition
Bench. How are mere Saxons,
unimaginative folk with 1acial
leaning towards accuracy of
statement, logical conclusions,
to distinguish between CRAIG's
nightmare fancies and what
are put forward by Earl PERCY
as matters of fact, supporting
his declaration that the pre-
sent Government “in the
name of justice to Ireland has
taught her people to trample a He
Law"?
BUTCHER of TRINITY.
“There is an undeniable exhilaration about
slaughtering these literary Ministerial lambs
which a profound study of the Classics had in
no way—er--led me to anticipate—er 1"
(Professor S. H. Butcher, M.P. for Cambridge
University.)
Business dome. — Earl PERCY moves
amendment to Address declaring condi-
tion of large portion of Ireland deplor-
able, and regretting that Ministers make
no effective effort to restore the authority
of the Law.
“SAY ‘WHEN,” YE BASTE!!”
y
- Mr. Asquith) will d to hist the Prime Minister
under foot both Liberty and who co i. wº go down to history as the Irime Muni
(The Rt. Hon. J. H. M. Campbell, K.C., M.P.)
Wednesday.—Ireland again. Debate
on PERCY's amendment continues. As
yesterday, parties to debate are in direct
conflict on simplest matters of fact.
Whilst one side alleges that Ireland is
in state of anarchy, with human lives
imperilled and property at the mercy of
a predatory peasantry, others declare
that, so far from crime increasing, the
country is, by comparison with Great
Britain, in condition of almost absolute
freedom from crime. St. AUGUSTINE
supports latter assertion by quoting
official returns showing state of affairs
to-day and in 1886, when, Lord CARNAR-
voN's secret conference with PARNELL
coming to naught, the Crimes Act was
passed by Unionist Government. At
that time crime of all kinds, from murder
to the writing of threatening letters,
totalled in the police records 1,056 cases.
In the present year they are, according
to the same authority, only 576, a reduc-
tion of nearly fifty per cent.
Once more the mere Saxon throws up
his hands in despair. Whom is he to be-
lieve 2 On which side does the truth lie?
The Member for SARK, recently back
from a tour in Ireland, says nothing
is more difficult than to extort from
an Irish peasant a simple statement
bearing upon a matter however trivial,
if he suspects ulterior design in what is
actually innocent enquiry. Unlettered,
ill clad, half-fed, he, with apparent defer-
ence that reaches height of
perfect politeness, fences with
the questioner. Voluble, hu-
morous, he seems to be con-
veying the desired informa-
tion. When the stranger goes
his way and examines the re-
plies extorted by what he
regarded as rather skilful
cross-examination, he finds
the information either ludi-
crously misleading or hope-
lessly lacking in material.
This pleasing trait in Irish
character has been in evi-
dence during last two nights
at Westminster. We troop
now to Division Lobby, and
upon our souls we don't know
whether Ireland is as black
as CARSON paints it or as bright
as St. AUGUSTINE pictures it.
Business done. — Earl
l’ERCY's amendment negatived
by 336 votes against 118.
“Thirty-four persons entered the
contest at 3d. a head. The first
prize-winner got 6s. 10d., the
second 3s. 5d., and the rest was
spent in beer among the competi-
tors."—The Star.

DEAREST DAPHNE,--To crin or not to
crin—that is the question | D'you see
yourself, my dear, flounced to the waist,
with a shawl worn pointed, and the
spoon-bill bonnet of our grannies?
There's one thing to be said for the crin,
and even that can be said by only a select
few of us—it does give a show to a
decent foot and ankle. But the voting
is mostly against it; and Bosh says if
Wee-Wee adopts it he'll divorce her. I
hear that one of our leading dramatists
is at work on a crinoline-drama which he
means to call Molly Deforming Herself!
The wave of patriotism that's going
over the country is making me simply
most immensely busy. Beryl Clarges
and I are helping the military authori-
ties for all we're worth by coaxing young
men to learn to defend their country.
We've set up such a snappy little re-
cruiting station near here, and we take it
in turns to go and help the recruiting
sergeant to pull 'em in by offering a kiss,
or a free pass to one of the music-halls,
really do think that, by the time Daily
Thrills declares war, we'll be ready for
anything! But the “ſly in the ointment’
is Beryl's jealous temper. Someone set
going a story that on my days at the
recruiting station they always choose a
kiss, and on her days they declare for a
music-hall or the Final Cup Match,
and she's turned quite nasty about it.
What did you think of Norty's speech
in the House the other might in answer
to Mr. Crawley's proposal that we should
abolish our Navy to please a certain
foreign Power? We all think it quite
his best effort. He means to use all his
eloquence to prevent the Lords from
being abolished. Isn't it a simply
abominable idea º Poor dear things!
To have one's income reduced or to
lose by speculation are horrid misfor-
tunes that some people have to endure;
but to be abolished altogether How
would anyone cope with such a calamity
as that? Norty has no immediate people
to be affected by it, as I have; but he
or a seat for the Final Cup Match at says his cousin Middleshire and some
the C. P. It's quite a nice feeling to of them were talking about it at the

We've got heaps of recruits; and I
decided that, if they were abolished,
they'd ask for Old-Age Pensions.
“But so few of them are old enough,”
I said. “What's that matter?” said
Norty. “You’ve only got to say you're
seventy, and you'll get it, even if you're
in your twenties!” It seems to me that
the brightest ray of hope for the Lords
is this monster petition against their
abolition that is being prepared in the
U.S., and signed by lots of American
heiresses, a deputation of whom, I hear,
are to bring it across and present it.
Josiah's still in Central America—fact
is he can't get away. There's been
another revolution in San Bangador
since he went, and they say now that if
he'll pay so-and-so they'll make him
Dictator. He 's refused, and now he's
hiding for fear they should make him
Dictator by force. I don't quite approve
of his refusing the Dictatorship. Think
what a Dictatress I should have made,
my dear! (I'm not sure what the
duties would be, but I was most awfully
good at dictation in my schoolroom days.)

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
There'd certainly have been thrills in it.
But perhaps they’d soon have tired of
us and murdered us, and that woul
be too big a thrill. -
Of course I'm frightfully anxious
about Josiah, though he is a don'ter.
People tell me I ought to have all the
amusement poss to prevent me from
brooding, so I'm making an effort. For
one thing I’m trying to train Norty's
musical taste, which is—oh, simply
awful! He actually likes MENDELSSOHN
Fancy, you know ! “Why,” I said,
“MENDElssohn's voted trivial and middle-
class to a degree nowadays. They've
put comic words to one of the Songs
Without, and are singing them in a
panto. That shows what MENDELSSOHN's
come to.” “I don't care,” was all that
Norty said, “I like the old ones.” So,
to correct his taste, I took him to hear
the famous Dr. Crotchet conduct his
wonderful new Symphony that every-
one's beenraving about. But he wouldn't
admire it, though I explained its scope
and meaning most clearly. “Oh, I don't
say it's not all right,” he said, “and
just what a symphony ought to be—a
tiny little tune trying to peep out occa-
sionally, and then all of them rushing
THE REVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
| THERE is a story I read years ago, in
which one of the characters is described
continually as a brilliant wit, the most
wonderful talker the world had ever
seen. I believed in this fellow for a
long time; until, in fact, he made an
actual appearance in the book. Then
he failed badly, for on being offered
a chair by somebody he could only
remark that he would be chary of accept-
ing it. . . .
To describe your hero as the man
with the best digestion in the world is
one thing, to call him the wittiest talker
is another; it is as bad, in certain
circumstances, as to announce the
heroine of your play to be a dancer who
has captured all London by storm.
This is what Mr. HENRY ARTHUR JONES
did in The Dancing Girl when he wrote
it eighteen years ago. He has brought
it up to date for its revival at His
at it and banging it to death—that's lºs
the idea in a symphony, I know—but
it's not my style.” He found fault, too,
with Dr. Crotchet's conducting. “No
Englishman can conduct,” he said; “his
self-respect comes in his way. Give
me those foreign Johnnies that jump
about like lunatics and seem to be
grabbing up the music in handfuls and
throwing it at the band.” . . -
What a lot of boresome rot is being
written about servants being imposs
to get and not fit to keep when got I
can only say I don't suffer from the
servant trouble; and nobody need who
keeps a competent housekeeper and
house-steward to look after them. But
I believe I manage better than most
people. As to servants being worse
than they used to be, it's just a tra-la-la.
Look at what Hamlet says—“Sharper
than a servant's tooth it is ”—to have a
something or other, which proves that
in SHAKSPEARE's time servants were not
only bad, but positively dangerous !.
Oh, I must tell you – Stella's bring-
ing out a book, Domestic Management
by a Duchess. I ran in to see her
the other day, and, having something
particular to say, went into her dress-
ing-room. Two of her maids were
doing her hair; two more were polish-
ing her mails; and she was dictating
the last chapter of Domestic Manage-
ment to a secretary, showing how a poor
clerk's wife on thirty shillings a week
might have every comfort for her home
—and save as well! Wonderful crea-
ture, isn't she?
Ever thine, BLANCHE.

style of dancing now, Drusilla dances
barefoot, as the habit is at the Palace.
And somehow, you know, I don't see
Miss ALICE CRAwFoRD at the Palace
capturing all London by storm.
Mr. Jones has made other efforts to
rejuvenate his play; for instance, he
refers now to The Daily Mail and to
Free Trade. (How pointless a joke
about Free Trade would have been
eighteen years ago!) But he cannot
disguise its age. Act III., containing
the Soliloquy of the Wicked Duke,
or the Father's appeal to his Cheild,
would betray it to anybody.
Mr. TREE, as the Duke of Guisebury,
went through his part in a careless way
which suited the character perfectly.
He had a delightful air of having for-
gotten his words; which was, I am
almost sure, the effect he intended to
produce. I liked him best in his ex-
tremely amusing scenes with Reginald
Slingsby. As Reginald Mr. WANE-TEM-
PEST was as funny in his own funny way
as he has ever been. Mr. BASIL GILL
(the noble young man who is tempted)
was just right in the First Act, but
afterwards he seemed uncomfortable in
a collar and a tweed suit. The great
scene between him and Drusilla was
particularly unreal; I don't quite know
whose fault this was, but I don't think
it was mine. Miss MARIE Löhm played
the cripple girl, and was, as Grizel (of
Tommy and Grizel) would have said,
“just sweet.” M.

FOLLOWING ALFONSO'S LEAD.
[The King of Spain was reported to have made
a promise that he would not fly in an aeroplane
at Pau.]
It is stated on good authority that
Miss MAUD ALLAN has solemnly promised
the PRIME MINISTER that she will never
attempt tobogganing in her Salome
costume. -
Mr. RooseVELT, we are delighted to
hear, has given Mrs. RooseVELT his
sacred word of honour that during his
African campaign in no cireumstances
will he wrestle with a gorilla.
We learn, with mingled feelings, that
Mr. HALL CAINE has at the last moment
cancelled his engagement to descend in
a submarine at Portsmouth. It appears
that at the eleventh hour he remembered
that he had pledged his word to Mr.
HEINEMANN never to run the risk of
encountering a mermaid.
But the disappointments and incon-
veniences caused by the observance of
these promises are as nothing compared
with the overwhelming sense of despair
which settled over all the South of
England when the dread news was
broken to the public that Sir Humbert
Hare-Brusher, R.A., was unable to
accept the invitation of Mr. Dexter to
accompany him on an aerial voyage.
For yesterday was a gorgeous morning
at Bushey, and the world-renowned
artist, who had kindly consented to the
presence of many Bavarian, Finnish,
Eskimo, Spanish and American reporters
and photographers, arrived early on the
Levitation ground where Mr. Felix
Dexter was standing on the hurricane
deck of his new spring-heeled air-yacht,
the “Jump to Glory,” the peculiarity
of which is that it can at will either
travel on the ground or leap into the
air. Up to the last moment it was be-
lieved by the private secretaries, major-
domo and valets of Sir Humbert Hare-
Brusher, R.A., that he would make the
ascent; but all expectations were finally
dashed by the announcement made
through a megaphone shortly before
11 o'clock yesterday morning. “I have
never been so disappointed in my life,”
so ran this pathetic message, “as I was
this morning when I was compelled to

decline Mr. Dexter's tempting proposal.
But the fact is that yesterday the agent
who manages my lectures, a really noble-
hearted fellow, declared that if I went
up in the air-yacht he would reſuse to act
for me any longer, and I had no choice
but to give way. What makes my dis-
appointment all the more bitter is that
I have just received a telegraphic round
robin, signed by all my colleagues at the
Academy, in which they say, “By all
means go up. Stout fellow ! Don't
hurry to come down.’”
After the delivery of the message Sir
Humbert sat for about ten minutes
in the car, while Mr. Dexter explained
the way in which the windbags are
worked. Sir H. showed a quite extra-
ordinary quickness in mastering the com-
plicated mechanism. Mr. Dexter, indeed,
was so much impressed that he observed,
“I have never seen any man who under-
stood how to handle a windbag better; ”
and praise from Mr. Dexter is all the
more valuable for its rarity. Sir Hum-
bert subsequently entertained Mr. Felix
Dexter and his brother Ambrose, or
“Amby,” as he is generally called, at
luncheon, together with the Mayor of
Bushey, Lord Uther Pupe, and Sir
S. Weld-Head. During lunch Sir Hum-
bert discussed continuously and with
extraordinary acumen the effect produced
on the prices of contemporary pictures by
motor cars, STRAUss's operas, MAXIM's
restaurant, the corner in wood-pulp, and
the over production of Bavarian beer.
During the morning no fewer than 600
photographs were taken of Sir Humbert,
all of which will be reproduced on a
colossal scale at his next lecture, “What
I have done for Art single-handed.”
The Great Brain at Work.
“The Oxford University crew made two
journeys in unchanged order to Iſley yesterday,
coached by Mr. Haldane.”—Daily Mail.
The exact strategic purpose of this we
shall not disclose.
“A foolish mistake occurred in the report of
the Bishop of Durham's speech at the York
Convocation, published in our issue of yester-
day. The subject upon which his lordship
spoke was not the ornaments of the Minister,
but the ornaments of the minister.”
Licerpool Daily Post.
Very unfortunate. Somebody must
really have another try next week.
“S. P. S.”—You are not entitled to be called
“The Hon.” because your sister has married a
peer.”—Birmingham Daily Post.
A nasty one for “S. P. S.” He must
write again about that cousin who
married the Mayor.
The Journalistic Touch.
“A close personal friend of the King, Lord
Durham was born only a few moments before
his twin-brother.”—The Westminster Gazette.
Amsterdam philanthropists have
formed a society with the object of look-
ing after persons who are found intoxi-
cated in the streets. As, however, the
society is, according to The Evening
Standard, “self-supporting,” there does
not seem to be much in the idea.
“The Quay followed up with a fine rush up
the field, and were within an acre of scoring.”
—Flintshire County Herald.
Of course a miss is always as good as
an acre.
The Pink of Pronunciation.
“The ha'penny wits who have already started
their verses about the French Grand National
candidate, Lutteur III., making his name rhyme
with “flutter,” are warned that the “u" is
long. Lutteur is French for wrestler, and the
pronunciation is loo-teur.”—Sporting Times.
Our contemporary must wrestle again
with the language.
A Policy of Panic.
“I am one of those who hold–Radical as
I am—that there is something to be said for
one's country and for one's Empire.”—Speech
by the Mayor of Battersea.

the impression of past excellence, or indeed of anything, had
faded from my mind. In other words, Tomo-Bungay, though
it interested me immensely, took no sort of hold on me. This
is because the hero and narrator, George Ponderero, is an
unreal and (I fancy) unrealised person in whom it is im-
possible to believe. When George takes to flying machines,
and I ought to feel instinctively that that is just what he
would do, I can only remember that Mr. WELLs himself is

excellent.” But by the time I had got on to the next chapter
In spite of his “unfailing intuition,” “unfailing fact,”
and “ long fine hands,” I am convinced that Cyprian Fielding,
the hero of The Heart of a Gypsy (Duckworth), was a silly
man. While spending a holiday at an Exmoor parsonage he
fell in love with the rector's adopted daughter, Meridiana
Pharaoh, but Di (as she was usually and mercifully called)
divided her love between Cyprian and the Beech-tree under
which she had, in her infancy, been abandoned by her mother.
The Beech-tree, if it did not actually talk, was no ordinary
tree, and in any case, with a rival so deaf to argument and
persuasion, I think that Cyprian might have been excused if,
like CESAR's enemies, he had sought safety in flight. But he
preferred to go searching for trouble when he took Di to
London, and allowed her to be bullied by his ambitious step-
mother and jealous Lady Winifred Turton. The result of
his conduct in this case was simple pandemonium, and,
although for the disasters which
rather keen on the subject.
When I ought to trace a con-
nection between George and his
manner of expressing himself, I
can only notice that he uses cer-
tain words which Mr. WELLs him-
self habitually and distinctively
uses. I’ven when George breaks
deliberately the sixth, seventh
and eighth, indeed all the Com-
mandments, he acquires no sort
of personality in the process.
Fortunately some of the minor
characters are more real. Beatrice
Normandy, Aunt Susan, and to
a certain extent Uncle Edward
(the inventor of Tono-Bungay)
are well and truly drawn; they
give an air of life to the story.
It is a pity that such a remark-
able book should not quite have
come off. Had it been written
in the third person it would, I
fancy, have approached more
nearly to complete success.

cannot give Cyprian a testimonial
for either tact or intuition. Miss

fully of Exmoor, but her attempt
to combine a fantastic idyll with
a tale of life in London is more
courageous than effective.
Mr. FARQUHARSON SHARP, in his
Short History of the English
Stage (WALTER SCOTT), has accom-
plished admirably the task he
set himself—the compilation of
a theatrical reference book within
a convenient compass. It is a
remarkable comprimé of essential
facts, set forth with engaging
directness, intelligently classified
and exhaustively indexed. But
why, in offering to the specialist
his work of research, does he
elate the casual reader too by
furnishing him in the earlier
chapters with exhilarating mat-
ter, only to hurl him down later
can hardly be described as easy
reading, especially for one whose
acquaintance with the beauties of
the American language is as
imperfect as my own. Happily,
however, the charm of Mr. GEORGE'. -
DYRE ELDRIDGE's style is greater even than the difficulty
of his idiom. What position the writer holds in the
literature of his country I do not know, but to English
readers an inevitable comparison will present itself, for
there is more than a suggestion of our Mr. HARDY in
the force with which he has told this tale of life in a re-
mote New England village fifty years ago. It is by no means
against a pleasant background that he has set his drama of a
woman and three men; the mental atmosphere of Padanaran
is compounded in equal parts of Puritanism and scandal;
but it is treated with a delicacy and a power that compel our
almost unwilling interest. For a long time I wondered what
there was in it all that recalled some half-forgotten bogie of
childish reading. At last I realised the association. The
people of Padanaran are simply the people of The Wide Wide
World (that narrowest of romances !) looked at from without,
and with the saving differences of sanity and humour. Per-
haps it is this that gives to a story about them its half-fearful
fascination. I question whether anyone will willingly lay this
book aside unfinished.

When papers bulge with poets' rhymes,
And “Old Etonian '' tells The Times
That he has heard the early cuckoo (liar!)

And makes the Young Man want to sing,
And turns his Object's heart a touch less chilly;
This is that March that wakes the dead,
And lo! the hare goes off its head
And takes to dancing with the daffodilly.

Conformably, with Nature's own,
Assume a gayer garb, a jauntier carriage

At this peculiar time of year

CROSS-EXAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME:
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's Road to KNowLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; Papa, aged 48.)
Little Arthur. Papa, do you make money?
Papa. Well, ah—um, yes; every now and then—just a
little here and there; not as much as I should like to make,
of course. But still I do manage to make both ends meet.
L. A. Then, Papa, you want to make a great deal of money,
do you ? -
Papa. Of course I do. How do you suppose I'm going to
keep the family going without money? There's your mother
and Mabel, and there's you, and the servants, and the house.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I know; but does everybody want to
make money 2 -
Papa. Yes, everybody—at least every sensible man does.
L. A. Is Mr. Harding a sensible man 2
Papa. What, the Vicar 2 Of course he is; one of the most
sensible men I ever met; a great influence for good in the
parish.
L. A. But Mr. Harding doesn't want to make money.
Papa. What do you mean, my boy?
L. A. Well, you gave me his sermon to read, you know,
Papa, and it says (reading from printed sermon): “The
rage for money-making is the curse of the age. In the grip of
this monster men forget the things of the spirit. Life be-
comes a mere, mad race for wealth.” That's what it says,
Papa, and there's a lot more.
Papa. Oh, ah, yes, I daresay, but Mr. Harding is a clergy-
man, you know; he's a very good man, of course, but not
quite practical.
L. A. But, Papa, you said he was one of the most sensible
men you ever met.
Papa. Oh, yes, he's certainly sensible; a fine scholar and
all that.
L. A. Then, Papa, I suppose sensible men are not prac-
tical. Is that what you mean, Papa?
Papa. Oughtn't you to be going out for your walk, now?
(Looking at his watch.) Why, bless me, it's past eleven.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I know; but I'm not to go out till half-
past eleven to-day. Papa!
Papa. Yes, my boy, what is it?
L. A. Oughtn't you to give up trying to make money?
Papa. Ha, ha! And where would you be if I did, I
wonder ?
L. A. I don't know, Papa; but if money-making is really
the curse of the age, aren't you doing a dreadful thing,
Papa? “ !.
Papa. Now, look here, Arthur, you mustn't talk nonsense.
L. A. But that's what Mr. Harding said in his sermon.
Papa. I know, I know; but I’ve told you before--Mr.
Harding is a clergyman, and clergymen don't always look
at these things in a practical way; they’re not men of the
world.
L. A. But is it better to be a man of the world than to be
a clergyman 2 -
Papa. Well, in certain things, perhaps, a little worldly
wisdom isn't a bad thing.
L. A. But, Papa, Mr. Harding says (reading):—“Men
must be brought to recognise that there is a wisdom which is
not of this world, and that it is far higher and better than
the wisdom of the worldling.” Are you and I worldlings,
Papa?
Papa. No, certainly not. What a preposterous notion
L. A. But you're not a clergyman, Papa, are you?
Papa. No, I never was.
L. A. Then what are you, Papa?
Papa. A sensible man, I hope.
L. A. But Mr. Harding is a sensible man too, isn't he? You
know you said so, Papa; and so you and he are the same.
But you want to make money, and Mr. Harding thinks that
is a curse. Doesn't Mr. Harding make any money, Papa?
Papa. Well, there's the living, you know—£400 a year—
and he writes books and articles. Yes, he makes a little, too.
L. A. But perhaps he means that it's all right to make a
little, but you mustn't go on after that. Papa, did you ever
eat locusts and wild honey?
Papa. No, certainly not; who ever heard of such a thing?
L. A. Because Mr. Harding says (reading): “In these days
it seems to have become the mark of good society to spend
one's substance in riotous living. It is our duty to call men
back to the simpler life, to remind them that great thoughts
may be thought and great lives lived on a diet of locusts
and wild honey.” That's what he says.
Papa. Does he 7 Well, it's half-past eleven now, so you'd
better trot away, or there'll be trouble.

THE “FIND”-SEEKERS.
(A Sketch in Caledonian Market.)
TIME: 11 o'clock on a Friday morning. A bitter N.-E. wind,
with sleet changing to snow. Mrs. Thomas Grablam-
Tyddler alights from a taxi-cab, and enters the gates,
followed by Mr. G.-T. in a fur-lined coat with the collar
turned up, and a tweed cap. He carries a small hand-
bag with depressed resignation.
Mrs. G.-T. Now mind, Tom, you leave all the bargaining
part to me. I do wish you had on a shabbier coat. I put
on all my oldest things on purpose, and if I talk with a
Cockney twang, they'll never know I’m not a dealer.
Mr. G.-T. All right, Dolly. Though why on earth you
brought me up to this beastly place on such a rotten morn-
in’ is beyond me. What?
Mrs. G.-T. Why, you dear old silly, I told you! Friday's
the best day for it. There's simply no telling what treasures
we mayn't pick up. Honor Hyndlegges got a perfectly heavenly
dressing-case here last week, silver fittings and everything,
for only thirty-seven-and-six. It would have been at least
ten guineas in any shopſ
Mr. G.-T. I say, that must be rot, you know ! Why should
they let it go so cheap as all that?
Mrs. G-T. Oh, they may have special reasons, and, you see,
as it's sold in open market, it's quite all right, however they
came by it. .
Mr. G.-T. Ah! Wonder you didn't make me bring along a
sack instead of this satchel affair.
[They pass down an alley of vacant cattle pens, till they
come to a mat on which is displayed a collection of
bric-à-brac, consisting, among other equally valuable
articles, of a bird-cage partly filled with garden snails;
a deplorable tall hat, from which the salesman is care-
fully brushing the snowflakes; a faded croquet stick;
a rusty skate; a Tantalus spirit-stand without its
decanters; a case which has evidently once contained
curling-irons; a headless terra-cotta statuette; a
stuffed perch in a broken glass case; and a horrible life-
sized waren head, with glass cyes and only one cheek.

Mr. G.-T. Well, of course, I don't know, Dolly, but I can't
believe there's much in his little lot that wasn't honestly
come by.
Mrs. G.-T. No. I don't see anything here I should really
care for. Let's go on. (They pass on.) Ah, here is something
really good. I do love Old Sheffield !

You can see the date on it. I can't make out quite whether
it's 1328 or 1528, because it's so encrusted with age, but it
must have come out of some museum. And I distinctly

Mr. T. S. (languidly, after greetings). Old Sheffield 2 Yes,
there are one or two people here who sometimes have some
really good pieces—most of it, you know, is just got up to
suit this particular market. Oh, those—yes, very nice indeed,

opinion. . . . Well, candidly, I shouldn't say they’re very
old. . . . . And you picked up this too, eh? Wery decorative,
and the colour charming—so clear. Of course you saw at once
it's one of those process reproductions. Oh, quite worth
getting, I daresay. . . . I could hardly tell you—but possibly,
with the frame, it wouldn't be so very dear at a shilling. . . .
Ah, a mortar, ell ? And dated, too? Interesting—quite inter-
esting—they cast these things from first-rate originals, and so
well that, until you get the dirt off, you would hardly know
they weren't antiques. . . . Oh, no, every now and then you
do come upon wonderful finds here. For instance, only a
few minutes ago I met a little man I know—a dealer of sorts
—with a pair of seated Chinese figures with movable heads
and hands—he'd seen 'em being unloaded from a van, and
spotted 'em at once. Another fellow was after 'em, but he
wouldn't go to more than a sovereign, so my little man nipped
in and got 'em for thirty shillings. He showed 'em to me,
and they really were wonderful. Ming of the best period—
and in perſect condition—probably looted from Pekin.

hoped to get a hundred at least. And I shouldn't wonder if
he does. Now, dear lady, if only you had happened to be on

is suffering from a severe sprain in his arm as the result of
directing the performances of RICHAED STRAUss's Elektra.
Herr voN SCHUCH ought to be grateful that he has not been
Elektracuted.
From a chatty letter in The Irish Independent —
“This extremely rare plant has an acinaceſorm leaf, sessil and em-
plexical, while the lamina is gibbous and limiate. The flowers have no
calix, which is replaced by a caduceus periamph. The polypetalous
corolla is caryophyllaceous.”
This plant was discovered in Mayo, and naturally the in-
habitants have boycotted it. .

A VIEW OF MODERN LIFE ;
OR, THE NEw EDITING.
This article by Mr. Bellary Hilloc, which
we print after submitting it to a censorship
mindful of the law of libel, contained certain
accusations against certain public persons,
accusations which we believe to be true. Mr.
Hilloc, whº wanted notoriety at any price, was
exceedingly unwilling that we should publish
his article without these accusations, and in
order to prove that he, at least, has the courage
of his convictions, we have adopted the form in
which the article at present appears. We do
this, in spite of the perfect idiocy of the result,
the more willingly since it demonstrates to our
easily persuaded mind how in this country the
law of libel aids that very obscuring of facts to
which Mr. Hilloc refers—that obscuring of
facts which is one of the most serious of
modern tendencies.—ED., The Bungay Review.

THE STORY OF THE WEEK.
[IMpoRTANT ANNounceMENT BY THE AUTHon:—
Truth, it has often been said, is stranger than
fiction. On the other hand, fiction is generally
more interesting than truth. Realising this,
and also that times are hard, Mr. Punch
has conceived the idea of presenting to
his su! scribers a short hebdomadal résumé
(as Parisians say) of the events of the
week, in the guise of a story. To this end he
has made arrangements with one of our lead-
ing—with the present writer, to contribute in
serial form a novel of actual life, in the hope
that this will enable his readers to economise
by dispensing in future with their ha'penny
morning paper.]
THE WAGGING WORLD.
(NotE-You can start this story NOW
—or not, just as you like.)
CIIARACTERS IN THE STORY.
Baron Norascotiacitch, one of the
Under Secretaries at the Servian
Foreign Office. He is engaged in
an important correspondence with
the Austrian Foreign Office, de-
manding compensation for the an-
nexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
His last letter was accidentally
addressed to-
J. A. Smith, the Secretary of the
Scottish Rugby Union. It is be-
lieved to have begun, “My Dear
Smith,” but the contents are as yet
a secret.
R. W. M. Arbuthnot, the Cambridge
spare man. He has been forced to
resign his position at the stroke
thwart, owing to the threats of the
Confederates, the leader of whom
is generally supposed to be--
George Redford, the famous Censor.
Hamilcar Harmstrorth, an anonymous
donor of £10,000 to the Territorials,
for enlistment in which
William Taft has just been rejected on
account of insufficient chest mea-
surement. William, however, is in
no wise daunted, and joins the
training ship Mercury, where he
comes under the care of
C. B. Fry, who is definitely going to
play for Hampshire this season.

Menial Manners, a young and lovely

Alfred, a German waiter disguised as a
Swiss waiter.
And a few more.
CHAPTER ONE MILLION AND THIRTEEN.
On a typical morning in March two
men might just have been seen walking
along the Embankment. The scene
spread before them (and partly over
them) was a familiar one to the Londoner.
On the right hand, as far as the eye
could see, a black waste of snow; on the
left hand a river of mud; on the
collar
At this moment the fog liſted, and the
i. travellers paused to look about
them.
“The L.C.C.,” began the elder de-
liberately, “be-” -
“My dear Smith,” interrupted the
other, “it has nothing to do with the
L.C.C.'. It's the Borough Councils.”
“Anyhow,” said his companion, “you
can't deny that the L.C.C. rate has
gone up three farthings. And that's
what you call Municipal Reform.”
“A legacy of the Wastrels,” retorted
the younger, angrily. “If it hadn't
been for them . . . .”
A clock chimed the hour slowly and
methodically. - -
“Listen,” said the first man. He held
up his hand for silence, and counted the
strokes as they fell. “Eleven . The
hour has come.”
“What hour 2 ”
“The hour, my dear MARRIOTT,” replied
his companion, “when we may begin to
celebrate the centenary of the poet BUNN.”
CHAPTER ONE MILLION AND FourTEEN.
[Synopsis of PREvious Chapten: The L.C.C.
rate has gone up three-farthings. On the other
hand this continues to be a week of anniver-
saries. But the weather is beastly.]
(NotE.-You can go on with the story
now.)
Let us however return to the A.B.C.
shop where we left our hero. Scarcely
had the door shut behind his rival when
he drew a letter from his pocket, and
once more with perplexed brow strove to
master its contents. It was written in a
foreign language, but, thanks to the
training which preparation for the pre-
liminary examination of The Erening
News Scholarship Scheme had given
him, he had no difficulty in translating
it as follows:–
“My dear SMITH,-I must say I don't
quite like the tone of your last letter.
I thought we had decided to leave the
question of compensation for the loss of
Bosnia and Herzegovina in the hands
of the other Powers for arbitration.
Why then do you suddenly suggest that
a trifling payment of three shillings
a day constitutes an act of profes-
sionalism 2 Please let me know at once
whether you intend to turn up on the
20th, as I want to mobilise our army.
This is positively my last word on the
subject. Yours sincerely,
“C. J. B. Now Ascotiavitch.”
“What does it mean 2" said our hero
aloud to himself, as he put the letter
away and stared out of the window at
the fog and snow. “What indeed does
anything mean P’’ -
“Well,” cheerfully said the little man
who sat opposite him, “Tariff Reform
Inneans x >
“Yet what does anything matter now
that STUART is at stroke again * *
The little man made no answer.
In-'
stead he began to cut into the sºone
which he had ordered. *
“Talking of Norwegian granite,” he
said, as he took a bite. -
Our hero was in no mood for frivolous
conversation. He rang for his bill, and
when the waitress had given it him he
picked up his photograph of Mr. Scott-
Dickson and made for the cash desk.
“What are you going to do for the
women º’ the waitress called after him
reproachfully,
“I beg your pardon,” he said, and,
returning, placed twopence underneath
his plate.
Once outside, he made his way through
the slush to Putney, where the Cam-
bridge crew were just embarking, FAIR-
BAIRN being still at the bow thwart.
“The Army Aeroplane. Record Descent
at Aldershot,” shouted a paper boy near
him, and beckoning to the lad he pur-
chased an evening journal, and hastily
scanned the Society column for the latest
news of Father WAUGHAN's dreams. Then
an announcement in large type met his
eye, and he staggered back.
“Heavens !” he cried, “the House of
Lords has been threatened again ' "
CHAPTER ONE MILLION AND FIFTEEN.
[SYNopsis of PREvious Charter: Tariff Reform
means more letters to my dear SMITH, and
STUART at stroke and bow.]
(Not E. –This is going to be the last
chapter this week.)
In a boudoir in Central Glasgow a
young and lovely girl was resting idly
on a couch. . Outside the snow fell
pitilessly, but inside the room the fire
burnt brightly enough. Waking sud-
denly from her reverie the girl sighed,
and then rose and skated gracefully
across the apartment to her writing
desk. She sat down and drew the tele-
plıome towards her.
“Are you there?” she said. “I
want Minus 2113 Central. . . . . Hallo,
are you Minus 2113? . . . . What?
. . . . Gone abroad, has he 2 What,
Spain? . . . . Thank you.”
She put the receiver back and took
out a sheet of notepaper. Then dipping
a jewelled fountain-pen in the ink she
began,
“My dear Surth,

with any luck.)

that further instalments of this exciting
story have been hibited by “The

Wicklow Spring Assizes yesterday, and the
Lord Chief Justice congratulated the grand
jury and the people at large on the circum-
stance.”—Daily Graphic. -
The people who were still “at large'
had probably already congratulated
themselves on the circumstance.

SINGINGSICKNESS
THE prevalence of this distressing malady is an alarming
fact that needs to be grappled with by scientists without
delay. Whether it is due to the harmful presence of the
common house-fly, just as Sleeping-Sickness is due to another
ravening insect, is not yet fully established, but it is certainly
a disease of domesticity and is to be found principally in
the suburban villa and the small flat. In hotels, clubs, and
billiard rooms, it is practically unknown.
Its symptoms are well-defined. The malady is sometimes
accompanied by gaspings for breath and redness of the face,
frequently by loud screams, and almost always by a piano.
Scales are among the least pleasant of the indications of the
scourge. Among the adolescent its manifestations are akin
to those of Love-Sickness. . :
A peculiarity is that those whom this malady directly
attacks show every sign of happiness and even pride in their
disease; the real sufferers consist of those who are personally
immune. The latter may gain temporary relief by inserting
cotton-wool in the ears, and sometimes, in the less obstinate
cases, by hammering nails into the party-wall. But no lasting
prevention or cure has been discovered, always excepting death.
It is one of the ironies of nature that Sleeping-Sickness
should prevail in remote swamps of the African continent
and Singing-Sickness in nice comfortable places, on dry soil,
like Highgate and Wimbledon. If only the victim of Sleeping-
Sickness could be brought into a neighbourhood in which
Singing-Sickness rages, there would be a very fair chance of 1.
the disease of the former being baffled and eventually con-
quered; or, better still, a movement might well be set on
foot to transport subjects of Singing-Sickness to the malarious
regions of Africa.
A MOTHER's SACRIFICE.
[Tö a Suffragette who, on being brought before the magistrate,
made the following statement (according to The Daily Telegraph):—
“I have a little son, eight months old, and his father and I decided,
after calm consideration, that when that boy grew up he might ask,
‘What did you do, mother, in the days of the women's agitation, to lay
women's grievances before the Prime Minister?' and I should blush if I
had to say I made no attempt to go to the Prime Minister.”]
AND so this boy of yours, years hence perusing
Records of women wronged by man-made laws,
May ask, an eager flush his face suffusing,
“What did you do to help the Women's Cause ?”
If, when this searching question has arisen,
You answer, “Nothing,” picture his surprise!
'Twere better to endure the pains of prison
Than face the scorn in those reproving eyes.
Let it be his to hear the tale—and may be
It will not lose through being often told—
How you renounced your husband, home, and baby,
When he (the last-named) was but eight months old.
Such be your answer! Yet, O happy mother,
Is this the only question you foresee ?
What will you say, suppose he asks another:—
“Meanwhile, dear Parent, who looked after me?”

—Sensation created midway through
Questions by appearance of a stranger
by cross benches on Ministerial side.
CLAUDE HAy, exultant over MANGNALL's
QUESTIONS ASHLEY, who dried up on his
tenth question, rose to put his eleventh,
flushed with knowledge that he had still
several more to the good on the paper.
The stranger, a man of stalwart build,
with face.cleanly shaven,asked theSPEAKER
whether there was not a Standing Order
limiting to eight the number of questions
that might be put by individual Mem-
ber at one sitting? Proceeded to point
I Am Not conscious of ANYTHING THAT could BE AccuRATELY DEscribed Even As ‘Discomfort'
out how unfair is the practice of
superfluity in this matter; daily has
effect of shelving Members whose ques-
tions stand low down on list, and are
not reached before a quarter to four.
As the stranger proceeded, Members,
pricking up their ears, recognised
the voice. It was FENwick, hitherto
bearded like the well-known but anony-
mous Pard, now pitilessly shaven
SARK explains the incident as supply-
ing evidence of the terrorism created by
The Confederates. Since the twelfth
century, when the Wehmgericht flour-
isled, there has been no secret society
exercising equal power, spreading
through the community similar terror.
CLAUDE HAY is a leading member. Every
statesman forming it has the name by
which he is recognised by his comrades
enrolled on a scroll enclosed in a
leaden casket and stored in the vaults
of the offices of the Tariff Reform
League. CLAUDE is known as Mokamma,
or The Veiled. Tom MooRE with pro-
phetic eye beheld him when, ninety
years ago, he wrote Lalla Rookh :
“There, on that throme. . . sat the Prophet Chief,
The Great Mokanna. O'er his features hung

Of course this veil is not brought
down to the Commons, being reserved for
use at the secret rites of The Confederates.
FENwick, feeling it his duty to the
House and the country to beard MoRANNA
in his place in the Commons, took the
precaution of disguising himself. Silver
veils being scarce and beyond his means,
he not less effectually used the razor.
The whole thing, as SARK says, shows
how dread is the influence of this
secret Society. PRINCE ARTHUR, who has
been personally threatened, watched the
episode with obvious uneasiness.

Tuesday. — Ac-
cording to Standing
Orders House been
engaged in con-
sidering the work-
ing of Old Age
Pensions Act and
the condition of the
Unemployed. Ac-
tually it has been
wondering whether
CAP'N To M M Y
Bowles will get in
for Central Glasgow
as result of polling
still in progress
when SPEAKER took
the Chair. If so, by . |
what majority? If
not, what will his
whacking amount
to 2
Politics apart,
there is a general l
desire to see the
old salt tacking
back to his familiar
anchorage. Would
like to hear him again emphasising
his criticism with convincing flourishes
of his handless arm. Oddly enough,
should he return, he would make for
the very corner seat to the right of
the SPEAKER filled by him through
a succession of Parliaments. Things
have changed since the CAP’N last paced
the quarterdeck. The Liberals have gone
over; so have the Unionists, and so has
'AP'N ToMMY. But the corner seat, in
olden time besieged by CUMMING MACDONA
and Mr. GEDGE, remains, waiting for the
return of the wanderer.
Should CAP'N ToMMY come back a
Liberal Home-Ruler, he would find the
House as completely transmogrified as
himself. Doubtful how he would get
along with the dormant mass. When
last with us he enjoyed advantage of
criticising his esteemed Leaders from
close contiguity of the Bench imme-
diately behind that on which they sat.
Always a position that commands atten-
tion. Been sedulously sought from days
before and since the forgotten HoRSMAN
was a power in the Hºuse. Few filled
it with the sustained brilliancy of CAP'N
ToMMY. An incisive debater, he had a
turn for pointed phrases that Dizzy
might have envied. It was his habit
thoroughly to master the details of a
question before expounding it. Seems
a small thing to mention, but not so
common at Westminster as might be
supposed. Generally understood that
he breakfasted on Blue Books and had
remaining fragments hashed for dinner.
How HE BROUGHT THE Good News.
“Acland-Hood, with face, figure, and gait more than ever reminiscent of a turkey-cock.”
On the Public Accounts Committee
he was a terror to evil-doers, including
the heirs of a foreign Sovereign who
evaded the payment of Death Duty on
British investments and found a Radical
Chancellor of the Exchequer who turned
a blind eye on the transaction. That
was the worst (or the best) of CAP'N
ToMMY. He was no respecter of persons,
whether they sat on the Treasury Bench
or on Continental thrones. He would
have thought nothing of speaking dis-
respectfully of the Equator; indeed he
did more than once transgress in the
analogous case of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.
Possibly three months after his re-
turn, should it be accomplished at the
poll now in progress, he would turn
and rend his newly “respected Leader,”
Asquith. It would be awkward so soon
after having found salvation to relapse
into his old attitude of candid critic of
his pastors and masters.
Perhaps on the whole CAP'N Tom MY
is better out of it. He would come
back to a new world whose leaden
dulness is proof against the sharpest
tongue. It was the audience supplied
by the last Parliament and its pre-
decessors that largely contributed to the
making of him. As PRINCE ARTHUR dis-
covered, when three years ago he first
faced it, the present House is a poor
strop on which to sharpen intellectual
razors.
10.50 P.M.–A quarter of an hour ago
news came that CAP'N ToMMY had won;
the figures assuring his triumph were
quoted. 564 was
the precise majority.
s That seemed con-
clusive. Now comes
ACLAND Hood, with
face, figure, and gait
more than ever re-
miniscent of a tur-
key-cock, rushing
up with slip of
paper in his hand.
At sight of it a
gleam of triumph
lights faceson Front
Opposition Bench.
The news flashes
benches, greeted by
the result.
CAP'N ToMMY has
been routed, not by
a narrow majority,
hut by thousands.
Members passing
out on their way
home find the throb-
bing Metropolis
stricken dumb. No
footfall resounds on
the crowded pave-
ments. Cabs,'buses,
motor-cars struggle silently over the
bed of the heaviest fall of snow the cen-
tury has seen. Through the thickening
air muffled voices repeat the figures
from Glasgow. Thus at great crises
does Nature attune herself to the action
of man. -

mate Account of Old Age Pensions

with the use of Norwegian granite for
purposes of Rosyth docks.
“ Was the stone dressed or un-
dressed ?” he sternly asks the FIRST
LoRD or THE ADMIRALTY.
ADMIRAL McKENNA only that minute
emerged from rather rough water.
'atriots opposite, hereditary champions
of the working man, have discovered a
new wrong done him in the matter of
this granite. It was bought in Norway
to the detriment of the British quarry
owner. It was wrought by workers
unprotected by the fair wage clause
inserted in all Government contracts
operative in this country.
Here be grievances especially poignant
just now when by-elections are going on
in Scotland, whose granite has been set
aside in favour of Norway's. Hue-and
cry instantly raised; merrily carried
on till the ADMIRAL quietly drops the
remark that his department has long
been familiar with Norwegian granite, it
having been habitually used under the
régime of his predecessors, who, in con-
formity with Government treatment of
all foreign contracts, did not insist on
the fair wage clause.
It was in the awkward silence that
followed on this disclosure that Mr.
FLAVIN chipped in with his inquiry about
the garb of the stone. No Salome
granite for him. Insisted that it should
not only be dressed, but well dressed.

the public feeling of the Old-Age Pen-

stalwart young fellows answered the call,
and the devoted patriots were speedily
rescued. A reassuring telegram was at
once addressed to Mr. BIRRELL, inform-
ing him that none of the cattle-drivers
had suffered from frost-bite.
Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, at a meeting

I Live in a block of flats which forms

treason, a felony or a misdemeanour.
I have neither attempted, incited to, nor
aided and abetted in, the commission of
the same. I am not even an incorri-
gible rogue and vagabond, and yet I am
under police supervision. I may seem
to find fault with the police, but I
should have been the first to write to
The Times about the grave deficiencies
of our detective system, had not the
tunately I did not see the policeman,
but the policeman saw me.
I walked round to the front of the
big man's flat and stayed there. “If
the little child will not let me write
frivolous poetry,” I said to myself, “she
shall not make me listen to Old Hun-
dredths. I will stay and hear some
Chopin.” A So, the night being a dark
and a warm one, I got as close up under
the railing as I could and listened.
Thus I remained absorbed, and I do
not know how long the policeman had
been there before I became aware of his

scrutiny. - * →

the stop a right-about turn. “I will go
back,” I thought, “and explain.”
The policeman was grossly to blame.
He neither said anything, as I came up
to him, nor offered to change his uniform.
“I got tired of the small child,” I said
hurriedly, “and came to listen to the
big man.” The policeman said nothing;
he did not even look cross. Had he
only looked cross, I might have kept
calm and even threatened to report him.
Anyhow, I should not have sworn (as I
did) that I was doing nothing, that I
was committing no crime, that no money
police acted as they did. --
On Sunday (I cannot say de-
finitely whether it was the inst.,
the ult, or the prox.) I was seated
in my flat without a stain upon
my character. I was composing
light verse for this very paper,
and what more innocent and
reputable occupation can be con-
ceived for a Sunday evening 2
The wall which separated me
from the next flat was thin, and
on the other side of that thin
wall a little child was learning
to play the piano. There is no
better way of learning the piano
Old Hundredth hymn over and
over again, proceeding slowly
but with determination, not
omitting an “Amen” at the end
of every attempt, and not being
in so much of a hurry as to cease
even when indefinite repetition
has produced comparative accu-
racy. No one knew or appre-
ciated that fact better than that
little child. Do - not, however,
jump to conclusions, for that
child still lives immune. Let
me tell the tale in my own way.
In a flat on the side of the
square opposite to me and the
little child there is a big man,'—
who also plays the piano. Though he
is four times, as big as the little child,
he does not seem to be a quarter so
strong in the arm. He has none of
the child's perseverance and love of
Old Hundredths oft repeated. He plays
nocturnes and sonatas, and rarely plays
the same thing twice. And so, because
the world seldom appreciates industry
and painstaking merit, people who
loathe the little child's labour love
the big man's playing. I am such a
person. -
Wicked frivolity cannot prosper in
the hearing of the Old Hundredth, and
aſter an hour vainly spent upon one
line, which made no claim to sense or
any serious purpose, I put the verse
away and went out into the square,

one party refuses to talk the
conversation must die, and we
reached my flat in silence. There

For a bit I stood awkwardly.

weakly, and started to move off.
Then I stopped and came back.
I took half-a-crown out of my
pocket, looked at the policeman,
and put it back again. At last,
the policeman remaining silent,
I crept back into my flat like a
worm. Inside, I waited trem-
bling a minute or two, and then
peeped through the blind and
saw him still standing there.

It was the policeman's fault for say-
ing nothing. Had he made some accu-
sation, I should have explained the truth
to him and he would have understood.
As it was, he passed on and left me
feeling relieved for the moment, but
guilty. In the matter of guilty or not
guilty, it is a question of what you feel
and not what you are. So, when I saw
him returning long before his proper
time, I was panic-stricken and ran away.
It sounds foolish, but again it was the
policeman's fault. Policemen have no
right to wear sombre blue uniforms,
which inspire terror in innocent breasts.
Had he been dressed in pink, had he
blacked his face, had he even been
wearing a cloth cap, I should have stood
my ground and passed everything off

It seems like a jud gment on him.

ACADEMIC OPERA.
[The Daily Chronicle records the fact that
Lord HowARD DE WALDEN has started for Buenos
Ayres with the libretto of an opera entitled
Dylan. It forms the second part of an in-
tended trilogy, the other two being entitled
Don and Brangwyn, and has been set to music
by Mr. Joseph HolbrookE, who has introduced
eight concertinas into his score.]
LoRD (we regret that the Cen-
sor has absolutely forbidden us to
mention the name of this interesting
peer) recently started on a tour to
the Isles of Greece, taking with him
the libretto of a new opera set to music
by Mr. Delius, who will accompany him
on his travels.
The work, which is in three Acts, is
called Hubert, and is based on one of
the stories in the Buschigrammaton, the
famous collection of Bavarian Fairy
Tales. Hubert, it should be explained,
is the first opera in Lord ’s tri-
logy, the other two being entitled Von
and Herkomer. Meantime Lord —— is .
Sergeant of Royal Irish Constabulary (interrieucing new member of the Force). “Well,

desirous of giving some experimental
performances of the first opera in the
AEgean, where the very name of Mr.
Delius will act as a passport to the
affections of the islanders. Still the
results of the experiment are awaited
with a certain amount of misgiving, as
the orchestration of Hubert is in some
respects highly unconventional.
Thus in the First Act the accompani-
ment to the Serenade is played by
sixteen Jew's harps, four Nasi-flutes,
and two Lombardophones. The plot
of the opera, again, is rather peculiar,
as there is no heroine, and the hero is on
the stage all the time, either singing,
dancing, or exhibiting one or other of
his numerous accomplishments.

In the Second Act he rides a turtle to
the sound of sea trumpets; in the Third
Act he paints a full-length portrait in
ten minutes, during which he never has
a bar's rest.; and in the Epilogue he
swims the Hellespont in the full uniform
of the Bushey Fire Brigade.
The libretto is written throughout in
rhymed Alexandrines, and those who
have enjoyed the privilege of perusal
declare that the lyrical temperature
throughout is higher even than that of
the most fervid stanzas of “burning
Sappho.”
Lord ––– has already mapped out
two other trilogies, the subjects of which
are (1) John (2) Singer (3) Sargent, and

EVERYoNE has heard often of the small boy in whom a
course of penny-dreadfuls has developed a suburban passion
for piracy. His case, and the severe magisterial com-
ments thereupon, belong to the routine of our police-courts.
Well, the next time that any young lady is brought up on
the charge of escaping from an unsympathetic home to dwell
among art students in a Bloomsbury attic, and with no more
practical equipment for the battle of life than red hair and a
sense of humour, then I hope the Bench will say some pretty
sharp things about “E. NESBIt" and her latest far too
fascinating book, Daphne in Fitzroy Street (GEORGE ALLEN).
Decause, you know, #doubt very much whether Daphne and
that delightfully real child Doris would have been quite so
happy in actual life. And all those charming people that
they got to know almost directly, Claude, the nice boy

I think novel-readers ought to be able to take out in-
surance policies against sudden accidents to characters,
which render them grotesque or repulsive objects for the
remainder of the book. It is so disturbing. In Mrs. HENRY
DUDENEy's Rachel Lorian (HEINEMANN) a quite guiltless hus-
band is crippled for life by a railway catastrophe on the
first day of his honeymoon; and the same kind of situation
is brought about as that which occurs (to take an instance)
at the end of Mr. E. F. BENSoN's The Angel of Pain. Rachel
falls in love with her husband's best friend, a romantic
artist, whilst the invalid becomes more and more embittered
and morose, and finally takes religion. After a time Mrs.
DUDENEY kills him off, and then I hoped that the tangle
would be straightened out. But no; the heroine dooms
herself to a period of widowhood, and at the end of it
discovers that Patrick Rivers, with whom her relations have
been purely platonic, has been conducting a most improbable
intrigue with a very inferior person. The book is full of
flashes of fine writing, both in the analysis of emotions and
the description of scenes, but the style is amazingly jerky.

novel is something different from the ordinary story of
crime. He provides us, of course, with the customary
apparatus; for valuable pictures are stolen and acute
detectives follow up chance clues or surprising coin-
cidences; and there is also an uncomfortably realistic
murder-scene thrown in near the finish. But Mr. PATER-
Nos TER possesses a gift for character-drawing which raises
his people considerably above the lay-figures of the ordin-
ary detective romance; and if one is inclined to carp at the
rather forced happiness of the ending it must be allowed
that justice is frankly meted out to everybody except the
hero. And he, by the recognised Statute of Authors' Limita-
tions, is exempt from too harsh treatment.

OF THE PROPOSED TAX ON BACHELORS.
[Being a vicarious protest, made on behalf of a certain celibate
malgré lui who finds himself in straitened circumstances.]
LADIES, at whose repellent feet
Times without number I have kneeled,
Laid bare a breast at boiling heat
And found your own securely steeled,
Thrown off a pulmonary sigh,
Picked up my heart in little pieces,
And, rising, cast a rueful eye
Upon my trousers' ruffled creases;–
Where lies the fault (go, hang your heads !).
That one who wooed till he was sore,
Wearing his knee-caps down to threads,
Should still remain a bachelor;
While others, whom the nuptial knot
Should rather stimulate to charity,
Propose to tax his lonely lot, -
To penalise his singularity?
Ladies, if ever such a fee -
Adds to my hump the final straw,
If a connubial Ministry
(HALDANE objecting) makes it law;
I shall protest against the same,
Urging that each rejected lover
From those who snuffed his proffered flame
Should be entitled to recover."
You, Helen, promised me a heart
Just like a sister's, soft as wax;
Well, you shall do a sister's part
And help your brother pay his tax. -
You too, Elise, shall take your share;
With purer pleasure I award it,
Since you espoused a millionaire
And so can easily afford it.
For you, Belinda, I am lot!
To have to send you in my bill; --
I'd overlook my blighted troth,
For you are left a spinster still ;
But it was greed: you thought to find
Someone more solid, sound, and pursy,
And, though you missed him, I’ve a mind. -
To let my marrow know no mercy.
You others—Ethel, Judy, Jean—
I'll see you have your small account;
The list is long, and that should mean
A relatively slight amount;
Soon as the grasping Budgeteer
Settles the size of this extortion,
I'll work it out and let you hear
(Discount for cash) your just proportion.
But as for you, perfidious Jane—
My earliest case and far the worst,
Since I should scarce have tried again
If you had not refused me first–
The wound is nicely healed to-day
(By now my heart's as tough as leather),
But you will clearly have to pay
As much as all the rest together.

L. A. Yes, Papa, I know. But you said you wanted me to
be a thorough Englishman, didn't you, Papa?
Papa. Of course I do—and you'll be one, I hope. I don't
want any foreign tricks in my family. John Bull's good
enough for me.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I want to be like that, too. But if I learn
German I'm afraid I shall have to learn some foreign tricks,

perhaps I don't understand these things.

SLEUTH.
Two very interesting and suggestive experiments have
recently been carried out by Major Rich Ampson's bloodhounds,
and convincing proof of the value of these animals as aids to
the police force has once more been given. A fortnight ago
the two hounds, Don and Pluto, were taken by the Major to
the New Forest, the greater part of the journey being accom-
plished by rail to Brockenhurst. Thence they were conducted
to the spot where, according to tradition, WILLIAM RUFUs
was slain by an arrow discharged by one of his hunting
men. The hounds were at once laid on the trail, and imme-
diately betrayed evidence of great excitement. With their
owner in attendance they ran at a great pace through the
Forest, stopping every now and then to bay at one of the
trees. After a most interesting chase of an hour they
returned to the place where they had started, and, owing to
the gathering darkness, Major RICHARDSON was compelled to
c.ll them off just as matters appeared to be assuming a
critical phase. Major RICHARDSON is well satisfied with the
experiment, though he naturally regrets that he was not
called in earlier. He believes that there can be no doubt as
to the guilt of WALTER TIREL. An important historical
question has thus been definitely set at rest.
On hearing of this performance the Italian Government
asked Major RICHARDSON to bring his hounds to Rome, and
the gallant Major promptly assented. The object of the
visit was to investigate the circumstances attending the
assassination of JULIUS CESAR some years ago. Don and
Pluto, having had an excellent meal of polenta overnight,
were led in procession to the statue of Pompey, which
CFSAR, it may be remembered, bathed with his blood when
he expired as a result of twenty-three dagger wounds. . Here
both the hounds were manifestly uneasy, Pluto, in particular,
circling round and round the statue with every sign of anger
and alarm. Hence they proceeded at top speed to the Forum,
being watched with great interest by a numerous and dis-
tinguished company of German and American visitors who
had gathered at this celebrated spot. The story goes that
the body of CESAR was burnt here, and both the intelligent
animals evidently had this circumstance in mind, for they
refused, in spite of Major RICHARDSON's entreaties, to proceed
any further. In conversation with our representative Major
RICHARDsoN afterwards declared his firm belief that the
murder took place in the manner described in the histories.
He thinks that CASCA and BRUTUs were certainly implicated
in it, though he is not prepared to say who struck the first
blow. Of course he regrets that he was unable to arrive on
the scene at a moment more nearly approximating to the
date of the assassination, but the results actually attained
leave him more satisfied than ever as to the necessity of
employing bloodhounds in every case of crime.
A SONNET OF SPRING MICROBES.
WHAT art thou, Spring, that poets oft have sung
Thy praises, and the beauties thou dost wear,
In sonnet, madrigal, and lyric fair?
Not so do I, but rather tends my tongue
To speak of those small microbes, freshly sprung
From winter sleep, that fill the waking air,
And mumps and measles through the country bear,
Thy sign to mortals that the year is young.
The jaded city man, with heartſelt sigh,
Returning in the evening from his work
With that affliction KIPLING calls the hump,
Although he longs a bunch of flowers to buy,
Must now reſrain—who knows but there may lurk
In each frail bloom a measle or a mump?

I rise at 10 a.m.
My cold bath is ready when I am

there is no trouble at all about getting
it cold. It is always beautifully cold.

I return to bed at 10.1 a.m.

call attention to my astounding brass

never got lost was William Winks of

Where should we be without The Oyster

I cannot tell. I know that I do not feel
that my day has been complete unless I
have purchased one of its amazing
half-hoops. This enterprising company
will send you one of its stupendous
half hoops on receipt of thirty shillings.
I lunch at 1.45 p.m.
Yes, I have a heavy lunch at the club,
and my doctor's address is 399, Harley
Street, W.
I cut myself shaving at 10.30 a.m.
Time was when the ten minutes spent
in shaving was one of the trials of the
day. Now, thanks to Blenkinsop's In-
credible Safety Razor, I have half an
hour's unalloyed pleasure. You simply
cannot cut yourself with this razor; but
should you do so a Jones' Plaster will
stop the bleeding at once. (Two ads. in
there. Heavy work.)
I breakfast at 11 a.m.
All the time we have been chattering
about bedsteads and such, my breakfast
has been keeping cool in front of the
fire. Those little black things you see
on the top of the poached egg are bits of
coal which have shot out. I use only
the very best coal, and the consequence
is that I don't mind the extra taste a bit.
Try Old, King and Co., and you will see

THE INVADERS.
[This terrible story is written by a patriotic
Briton who resents perpetual invasions. Mr.
LE QUEUx, with admirable impartiality, has led
both a German and a Russo-French army into
the heart of his land. Mr. Wells, after first
horrifying him with Martians, has terrorised
him with aeroplanists. Mr. Shiel has brought
the Yellow Terror to his very coast. And now
two popular weeklies are simultaneously letting
loose some more German armies on his devoted
country. The time has come for Retaliation—
even Mr. Churchill admits that. But let us
get to the story.]
Chapter I. BERLIN.
ON a bright summer day in 1912,
Berlin was the picture of prosperity and
security. Happy, unsuspecting Teutons
drank lager in their beer-gardens to the
accompaniment of music from admirable
military bands. Little did they think
that far across the North Sea a treacher-
ous War Office had been planning and
scheming for years, that the prepara-
tions for invasion were complete to the
last button, and that at any moment a
mighty power might swoop down on a
trusting land. -
The natives smiled as they watched
the familiar spectacle of British excur:
sionists sniffing about Berlin. It did
not seem strange to them that the Tariff
Reform League and the Free Trade
Union should each send over five thous-
and delegates to settle the fiscal problem
by personal investigation—the Tariff
Reformers led by Mr. LEO MAxSE, and the
FreeTraders by Mr. BYLEs. Even the Ger-
man policemen were compelled to smile
when they noticed that each excursionist
carried a large red-bound guide-book.
As the clocks of the city struck
twelve a series of deafening explosions
took place. The excursionists had all
discharged their guide-book bombs,
and the railways, telegraphs, barracks,
gas works, and electric 'power stations
of Berlin were blown to smithereens.
Mr. LEO MAXSE, rescuing the Mayor from
the ruins of the Town Hall, sternly de-
manded the surrender of the city.
Hurriedly a few scattered troops had
gathered in Unter den Linden. There
were only fifteen theusand men, but
enough to make a gallant effort. Sud-
denly a dark object appeared in the sky
overhead. “It is the British army
aeroplane,” cried a keen-eyed sergeant.
“It may fall anywhere ! Save your-
selves.” It was too much ; the awed
troops fled for the shelter of cellars.
Berlin and the British aeroplane fell
together.
CIIAPTER II. Potsdam.
Nothing was known in Potsdam of
the strange happenings in Berlin, when
a motor-car drew up outside the Imperial
Palace. Nor did the guard recognise
in the goggled motorists those intrepid
dare-devils Messrs. LEO MAXSE and
WILLIAM LE QUEUx. The first had
called by appointment to see Prince
Bülow. With the utmost confidence
the Prince received him. He even
courteously submitted when Mr. MAXSE
proposed to read him extracts from the
Tariff Commission's report. Soon the
Prince began to nod. Wake, Prince,
wake, before it is too late' But the
Prince falls into a deep slumber.
In the meantime Mr. WILLIAM LE
QUEUx, with the confidence of one born
and bred in the purple, had penetrated
to the innermost recesses of the Palace.
The KAISER received him graciously, and
even listened with an air of politely

received from other crowned heads.
Again the fatal slumber! Then the
wily LE QUEux steals to the Imperial
telephone and demands to be put
through to Kiel.
He receives the reply, “Who is there?”
“William,” is his truthful answer;
“put me on to the Admiral commanding
the fleet.” This would look better in
German, but English is the recognised
language of all paper invasions.]
While the Admiral is trembling at
the other end of the telephone he re-
ceives the fateful order, “Blow up the
Kiel Canal and take out the fleet at
once for realistic collision practice... I
# propose to test the resources of my
repairing yards.”
Three hours later there is no Kiel
Canal and the German battle-fleet is a
confused mass of shattered hulks.
English cunning had triumphed.
CHAPTER III.
[The other chapters were quite easy,
but this one is so difficult that we must
hold it over till next week or even later.]
MUSIC HATH CHARMS
THE piecemeal transformation of the
legitimate drama into musical comedy,
so well inaugurated by the success of
Butterflies and The Dashing Little Duke,
still continues. It is reported that The
Dictator is to be the next subject of ex-
periment. As the idea is bound to
spread, we have pleasure in anticipating
below some theatrical paragraphs of the
immediate future:–
Mr. BEERDOHM TREE announces that
the birthday-week of PAUL RUBENs will
be celebrated at His Majesty's Theatre
in an especially graceful and appropriate
fashion. This will take the form of a
programme comprising revivals of cer-
tain past productions at this house, all
of which have since been metrically
adapted by the famous author-composer.
Amongst various attractive items for the
Y. we might mention Little Miss
arguérite, Purple Emperors (originall
called Herod ; #!"8. §
(the last with additional lyrics by Mr.
G. R. SIMs). The occasion will be
awaited with considerable interest.
Meanwhile the instantaneous triumph
of Ophelia at the Lyceum proves how
well advised were Messrs. SMITH and
CARPENTER in thus bringing their latest
revival into line with popular taste. In
the title rôle Miss ELLALINE TERRiss sings
and dances as daintily as ever, perhaps
her most taking number being the tune-
ful Bogie, Bogie, Boo! arranged as a duet
with the Ghost. The accompanying snow-
effects are especially striking. Mr. Rut.
LAND BARRINGTON, as a melodious Hamlet,
affected interest when Mr. LE QUEux'scores heavily by his humorous delivery
related anecdotes of compliments he had of Since Poor Old Father Died; and the
Play scene, with its delicious burlesque
of the methods of Mr. Pélissien, is
another factor in a success which opens
up golden vistas for managements with a
Shakspearean repertoire.
WICEREGAL CAPERS.
A Pinnic TRIUMPH.
SoME details of the St. Patrick’s Eve
Pageant of Industries and Fancy Dress
Ball to be held at the Castle in Dublin
to-night were given in The Observer of
March 7. From these we gather that,
while guests in ordinary evening dress
may watch the pageant, only those who
don a costume illustrative of Irish
industries will be permitted to take part
in the ball. Also that the list of Irish
industries prepared by Lady ABERDEEN
as a guide to the wearers of fancy dress
includes the following:—
Minerals and Marbles.
Poultry Farming.
Shipbuilding.
Agricultural Imple-
Fisheries. Innents.
Tobacco-growing. Matches.
Mosaic. M meral Water and
Rope-making. Cyder.
Candles. Bacon-curing.
Soap and Perfume. Peat. -
Brushes and Baskets. Horse-rearing, Hunt-
Early Flowers and ing, &c.
Vegetables.
Curiosity is stimulated by the state-
ment that a Minerals Quadrille has
been arranged, in which General and
Mrs. BUNBURY will represent coal, and
Lord and Lady HADDo salt. Mr. Punch
is fortunately able to supplement these
meagre details with further information
of the chorographic dispositions of Lord
and Lady ABERDEEN, whose incorrigible
humour has been greatly enhanced by
their sojourn amongst the vivacious and
quick-witted Irish.
Immense and ebullient enthusiasm
prevails amongst those who are respon-
sible for the Mineral Waters Two-step.
An attempt was made to secure the
co-operation of the Bishop of Sonor AND
MAN, but that ſailed. Fortunately Lord
PiRRIE, K.P., has come to the rescue with
characteristic zeal, and has heroically
agreed on this occasion only to alter
his name to Lord PERRIER. Mr. ChERRY,
the Attorney-General, will represent
a non-alcoholic Cherry Whisky, while
Mr. HEALY will figure as Dry Ginger
Ale and Mr. KETTLE as Potash.
The Fish Lancers will be full of
quaint and adorable conceits. Lord
HADDo will represent a Finnan Haddie.
General BUNBury, as he wittily puts it,
expects to take the cake as a Red
Herring. Lord TRIMLESTown will appear
as a Sun-fish. Other notables who will
take part in these scaly revels are Sir
FREDERICK Pollock, Mr. Richard WHITE-
ING, the Sisters FINNEY, Messrs. SALMoN
AND GLUckstEIN, and Miss DAisy BUCK-
TRout. As the leading “fish-lancer”
Lord Pinnie will carry a harpoon, in the
use of which he has been carefully
coached by Mr. FRANK T. BULLEN.
The Mosaic Polka will be another
striking feature of to-night's Fancy Ball.
The immigration of Polish Jews into
Ireland will enable the national dance
of Poland to be executed entirely by
experts, and to lend local colour to the
performance the band for this item will
consist solely of jew's harps in place of
those of Tara.
Special pains are being lavished on
the Bacon-curing Barn Dance. Lord
PiRRIE has designed a lovely garbage
for himself in the rôle of “Gammon and
Spinach.” Canon BEECHING and Mr.
SidNEY LEE will wear two daring costumes
as “ Rasher and Rasher’”; and General
BUNBURY, in view of his commanding
stature, will represent “Brawn.”
No set dances have been arranged by
those representing agricultural imple-
ments, but we understand that Mr.
DEVLIN, M.P., will figure as a working
threshing-machine, Mr. CREAN, M.P.,
being the wheat. -
Perhaps the most sensational item in
this wonderſul programme is the Dairy-
ing Dance for Irish cowboys specially
trained by Mr. GINNELI, M.P. Here
again Lord Pinnie, K.P., may be ex-
pected to take a prominent part, and,
indeed, has promised to perform what
he wittily calls a Pirrie-ouette.
Lastly, a Musical ltide for Rearing
Horses is being organised by that
staunch patriot, Alderman SHANKS, whose
famous mare is expected to perform
prodigies of equine valour.

“A Son" promises to be a work of per-
manent interest. It is frankly realistic,
and we feel certain that anyone who
takes it in hand will be compelled to sit
up to all hours of the morning with it.
The flannel binding is a novelty.
“Even Lord Byron, who was supposed to be
a callous sort of person in so far as caring for
the world's verdict was concerned, is said to
have been completely wretched at the first
production of his play, Dearer than Life.”
So says John KENDRICK BANGs in
Success, and if he cares for our verdict
we may mention that the confusing of
GEORGE GordoN ByRoN with H. J. By RoN
prevents his article from doing perfect
justice to the title of the paper in which
it figures.

MNEMONIC AIDS.
[Loss of memory is once more becoming a
common complaint.]
A GREAt thing in the art of remember-
ing is association of ideas. You are in-
troduced to a Mr. Smith, and so that
you may not forget his name you think
of the poem concerning the man who
toiled and rejoiced. This, of course,
may prompt you later to address Mr.
Smith as Mr. Chestnut, or Mr. Sparks,
or even as Mr. Longfellow; but all roads
to success are paved with danger.
This, however, only illustrates part of
the method, and we commend the fol-
lowing mnemonic aids to the reader's
attention. We do not claim for our
system that it represents anything like
a full course of mind development; we
simply wish to let the public have the
benefit of a few practical hints, for which
we ask nothing in the way of fee or
subscription. -
No. 1. You are a Bridge enthusiast
and wish to remember to return your
partner's lead. Write the name of the
required suit on your cuff, or get a card
of it from another pack, and keep it in
evidence. The latter method, however,
is open to misinterpretation, especially
if the card borrowed be an ace or a
trump, and you absent-mindedly take a
trick with it. A safer plan is to have
one of those fancy handkerchiefs hearing
designs of the four suits, and to put
it down your sleeve, leaving the right
picture exposed.
No. 2- You are the husband of a lady
who, under excitement, becomes rhe-
torical. She has given you a letter to
post. You might paint your face a post-
office red so that every glance in the
mirror reminds you of your commission.
A still better plan, since you are likely
to notice them more often, is to incarna-
dine your fingers, or wear red knitted
gloves or mittens.
No. 3. A lady visitor at your house
has had the unhappiness to marry a Mr.
Sudds. You naturally wish to avoid
any mention of soap or washing in her
presence, and a good mnemonic aid to
this end is to put a cake of soap in your
pocket. Be careful, of caurse, not to
instead of your cigarette-case, and above
all don't leave it in your visitor's hand
when she bids you good-bye.
No. 4. You are in the habit of leaving
one or more of your bath-taps running.
Tie a knot in the centre of your towel.
No. 5. You wish, perhaps, to remem-
ber to return a borrowed book or um-
brella. . . . . But this is a contingency
not likely to arise, and in dealing with
it we should only be wasting our space
and the reader's time.

PUNCH,
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 8.
—There happened to-night one of those
little incidents which show that, after
all, the House of Commons is almost
human. VERNEY asked UNDER-SECRETARY
For Colonies whether he could state the
profit of gold-mining companies in the
Transvaal during the last ten years.
SEELEY advanced to Table with pro-
digious sheet of foolscap in hand. Cit-
ing the year 1903-4, he in studiously
quiet voice named the result. It was
a trifle under three and a half millions.
House listened languidly. As year by
year showed increase, Members began
to move uneasily in their seats. Strange
lights gleamed in eyes which, as far
as earlier observation went, had no
speculation in them. Here and there
on back benches were heard sounds as
of one licking his lips in keen antici-
pation of sharing a sumptuous meal.
SEELEY, insensibly sharing growing ex-
citement, raised his voice in continuation
of the dazzling record.
“Nineteen hundred and five-six,
£4,622,000.”
On the benches where Labour Mem-
bers gather, emotion grew uncontrollable.
Had JoHN BURNs happened to be sitting
in their midst, they would have shaken
hands with him, so far were they
beside themselves at this display of
wealth hitherto untold. SEELEY went on
piling it up. Jupiter calling upon Danae
in her brazen tower was no-
thing compared with UNDER- hº
SECRETARY FOR THE Colonies.
“1906-7,” he trumpeted, -
“45,115,000.”
This too much. “1907-8,”
said SEELEY with a shout.
Members could stand no more.
“Agreed ' Agreed ' " they
cried. And UNDER-SECRETARY
sank back exhausted in his
seat, leaving untold the out-
put of the last year.
After this the great granite
question turned up again,
ADMIRAL McKENNA confined to
his bunk. Teported to have
caught a chill. Gentlemen
opposite know that a chunk of .
Norwegian granite, after the
manner of a similar sample
of old red sandstone, has
caught him in a tender part,
and, as in the case of the
recipient of the red sandstone
aforesaid, deprived subse-
quent proceedings of all inte-
rest. In his absence the
schoolmaster is abroad. MAC-
NAMARA takes the floor, with

|present Government would be guilty of
such mean unpatriotic penny-wise per-
versity.
Turns out that Admiralty have strictly
followed precedent established in 1896,
when Unionist Minister was at the
helm. Over three million sterling being
expended on extension of dockyard at
Devonport, Admiralty of the day ap-
proved action of contractors in using
Norwegian granite and did not insist
upon clause securing fair wage for
foreign workmen.
This a little awkward. Confederates
changed the subject; but are they down-
hearted ? No. Have another card, so
to speak, up their sleeve. HERBERT
GLADSTONE has been buying abroad
material for making mail-bags. (What
Home Office want with mail-bags not
clear. That a detail.) Won't do to have
him showing that his predecessor in
similar manner also bought in cheapest
market. Will look matter up. If the land
is clear, will shake out the mail-bags and
give granite the go-by.

TERJEE been talking more than enough?”
'Twas the voice of REEs of India. I
knew he’d complain. In truth, he well
might. India looms large in both Houses
to-night. In the Lords the SECRETARY
of STATE pilots through another stage a

important proposals popularising British
government in India introduced since
Dizzy made his Royal Mistress Empress

Speaker LowTHER, regarding
freedom in questioning as
sort of safety-valve, lavishly
permits the practice. Per-

who, lacking opportunity for
acquirement or consideration
of latest information, may be
entrapped into indiscretions.

Don't get much out of that eminent
Scotsman. No harm done in House of
Commons where we know our Satish
Chatterjees. In only less degree is the
performance hurtful throughout the
country. Quite a different thing in
India, a section of whose native popula-
tion of late did honour to Don't KEIR
HARDIE. These wranglings, reported
verbatim in morning newspapers, are
eagerly reproduced in native press. To
its readers one M.P. is as good as
another; a great deal better too, if he
only asserts or insinuates that Govern-
ment of India is mendacious, suborned,
tyrannical. -
It was SATISH CHATTERJEE MAcDoNALD
who gave the kick-off to-night. Wanted
to know about arrest and deportation of
certain political agitators. UNDER-SECRE-
TARY having made reply, up sprang half-
a-dozen Members of British branch of
Satish Chatterjee family—MACKARNESS,
CottoN, RUTHERFORD, DON'T KEIR HARDIE,
and others.
Meanwhile on topmost Bench below
Gangway sits up aloft JACK REEs, keeping
watch over UNDER-SECRETARY. Plays
part of what HALSBURY would call “a
sort of" Greek Chorus. Now and then,
amid clamour of the Chatterjees, he gets
in elaborately framed question, to which
nobody pays any attention. The Chat-
terjees cry “Caw Cawl"; the UNDER-
SECRETARY endeavours in reply to say as
nearly nothing as possible; and at length
DEPUTY-SPEAKER timidly suggests that
other questions should have a turn.
Business done—The Satish Chatter-
jee family take the floor.
Thursday. -Since at historic crisis
embattled Europe was reassured and
sustained by editorial assurance on the
our eye on Louis Napoleon,” there has
been nothing like Mr. Swift MACNEIIL's
attitude at the present time towards his
Sovereign. Across sea and land a
searching eye beams on Biarritz. Mr.
MACNEILL's trouble is indicated in notice
appearing on paper to-day directing
attention to “advice given by the
FoREIGN MINISTER to the KING to go
abroad without a Minister responsible to
this House for the KING's transactions in
international politics.”
Can make nothing out of Edward GREY,
who affects indifference to apprehensions
and constitutional objections. If Foreign
Office are thus neglectful of vital interests
of Empire, let private citizenship sacrifice
personal convenience on country's altar.
lf no Minister of the Crown is forth-
coming in attendance on travelling
Majesty, is there not in the House a
lineal descendant of WILLIAM LENTHALL,
Speaker in the Long Parliament, also
Godwin Swift, late of this parish, uncle
and guardian of DEAN Swift? Is he
not Ex-Professor of Constitutional and
Criminal Law, King's Inns, Dublin?
Persuasion tips his tongue whene'er he talks,
And he has chambers in the King's Bench
Walks.
When next the Foreig N SECRETARY goes
a-fishing, he might think over this sug-
gestion.
Business done—Still in Committee of

question, declares there is not shadow
of foundation for mail-bag story. Must
hark back to granite.

A DEAD CERTAINTY.
This was the posture of affairs: it was
half-past two, and the matinée was at
three. But the notices in the shop-
window said “Last reductions. Sale
now on. Genuine bargains”; and Cecilia,
who was only up for the day, said it
would be positively sinful to let the chance
slip, and she wouldn't be two minutes.
In a woman's shopping vocabulary
two minutes means half-an-hour; so I
objected, and painted a vivid picture of

said, with what dignity I could—
“I want about three yards of inser-
tion at nine-five, please.” Then I swal-
lowed, and added—not very bravely I'm
afraid—“ and I'm in rather a hurry.”
Juno stuck a pencil in her dress, gave
a cursory glance at me, to see what
manner of a cheap bargain I might be,"
and asked coldly: “Did you want it
ruched or puckered ?”
Perhaps those were not the exact
alternatives offered; but it seemed that
“Eleven-three is the price,” she ex-
plained icily, “not the width.”
“Oh, yes; then I'll take it.”
“The piece, or only nine yards?”
“Yes, nine. No, five.”
She waited, compassionately now, as
a wise elder might await the result of
an infant's painful effort after articulate
voicing of its wants.
“Five yards, please,” I said meekly.
“But” –- this was rather a brilliant
after-thought; Cecilia should not taunt

Cecilia looked at the shop
window plaintively, and I re-

cogent reasons why bargains
should appeal strongly to the
wife of a country parson—of
a parson, moreover, who has
no immediate prospect of exer-
cising archidiaconal functions.
However, the feet of the people
in Row C had to be considered
too, so I said promptly, “Look
here, it takes a man to do
shopping quickly. Tell me
what you want, and I'll be in
and out again in less than five
minutes.”
Cec lia looked at me with

But Juno was wrestling
with the multiplication table.
I made the answer fifty-six
and threepence, but appa-
rently my hint about sale
price had not fallen on deaf
ears. “Four-and-tempence
three-farthings. Sign!” said
Juno—a really handsome re-
duction. I tendered a sove-
reign. Then came an inter-
lude. “Your change will be
here in a minute,” she said.
She said ; but I saw very
little chance of it, and glanced
anxiously at the clock at the
far end of Right Through. I
was to pay the bill if I lost
the bet; and no one seemed
to be bothering about my
change. Of course it was out
of the question that Juno her-
self should go in search of it,
and the countesses about the
place were all gracefully statu-

tonners. - -

A nobleman who had come
in to have his hat ironed, on
seeing my dilemma, very civilly came
forward and pointed the way to Right

been there for his wife.
I only fell into one error on the way.
“I want,” I said to a rather prepossess-
ing viscountess—“I want nine yards of
insertion at about five-three.”
“Oh, yes,” she said brightly. “This
is the glove department. Would you

There was a cathedral-like dimness
about this region when I did finally
reach it, and it seemed very far from
the street. Time had not been standing

there were two kinds of insertion, and

The situation was serious. -
“I’d better see some of each,” I said
brilliantly. -
Juno deftly spun out four or five
rolls of lace, and I fingered one piece,
not without certain misgivings.
“Er—I suppose this is insertion ?” I
asked. For I had expected something
heavier—something strong, for patching.
Juno was sure of it.
“Then I'll have nine yards at three-
five, please. No, five yards at nine-
three,” I said.

standing. She took some heavy
change out of its maw, and
handed this to me, together

very particular about the packet.
“Do I–do I-do I leave this at the
desk?" I gasped at parting.
“That is your farthing change,” she
said scornfully, on one of her rich
middle notes. -
I clutched my paper of pins and fled.
Cecilia, when I found her, was in the
act of coveting a hat in the window—a
hat that had been greatly reduced in
price, but not in circumference. ,
“You’ve spent tempence more than
you should have done,” she said, when
I had boasted of my genuine bargain;
“but it doesn't matter since you have
to pay. You've kept me twenty-one

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GREAT PLAY.
It is very difficult to write praise;
very easy to find fault. As I have
nothing but praise for Mr. GALsworthy's
new play, Strife, I find it difficult to say
calmly what I think of it. Perhaps the
best thing I can say is that I feel proud
to think that it was written by an
Englishman, and acted by English men
and women. You know, ours is a poor
country. Our Trade is rotten and our
Navy futile. On another count we are
in danger, if we are to believe an emin-
ent Member of Parliament, of becoming
the laughing-stock of Europe. Think
how awful that will be And only re-
cently. The Saturday Review announced
that one German conscript would be a
match for a hundred Territorials (Eng-
lishmen). So it is jolly—is it not?—to be
able to reflect that at least we have
written and acted a play which can
stand comparison with anything the
Drama of the superior countries can
show.
Strife tells the story of a strike at the
Trenartha Tin Plate Works. In the
struggle between Capital and Labour,
the protagonists are old John Anthony,
Chairman of the Company, and David
Roberts, leader of the workmen. Old
Anthony dominates the other directors
(one of whom is his son), just as Roberts
sways the other members of his com-
mittee. Both of them are looking to the
future rather than considering present
needs. “If you give in now,” says
Anthony to directors thinking of divi-
dends, “Labour wins for ever.” “If
you give in now,” cries Roberts to work-
men thinking of food, “Labour loses for
ever.” But Roberts's wife dies. “It will
be our wives next time,” say the other
men; and they are ready for compromise.
“A woman dead!—this is too terrible,”
say the other Directors, and they also are
ready for compromise. So terms are
agreed to, and Anthony and Roberts are
thrown overboard — Anthony on the
verge of a paralytic stroke at his betrayal
by his own son, Itoberts on the edge of
madness at the death of Annie . . . .
And then it is discovered that the
new terms are actually the very terms
which had been drawn up before the
strike as a basis of agreement. Which,
as the Trades Union Official says, is
where the fun comes in.
I have seen it said by critics that
Mr. GAIsworthy's moral is this, that and
the other. I don't think Mr. GALsworthy
bothers about a moral. It is his business
to make other people uncomfortable.
When people are thoroughly uncomfort-
able they begin to think; after they
have thought a little they decide vaguely
to “do something.” Mr. GALsworthy
longs for somebody to “do something.”
If Strife has a moral it is simply that

the problem of Capital and Labour will
have to be settled.
Though the play is great the acting is
worthy of it. I refuse to single out any
player for special praise; if once I began
I should not stop until I had mentioned
every name on the programme (including
probably those of the Business Manager
and the Musical Director). They are all
perfect. You must go to one of the

though, that Mr. FROHMAN will be able

thousands who are turned away nightly
from An Englishman's Home had an

discover that there are other problems
to which a patriot may give his mind—
with equal advantage to his country.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
CoMMANDER C. N. Robinson has laid all sailormen and
those who are even remotely interested in the sea under a
heavy load of obligation by writing The British Tar in Fact
and Fiction (HARPER). The gallant Commander is a master
not merely of his subject but of a capital style, breezy, as a
sailor's style should be, and most admirably graphic and
entertaining. He has produced a fascinating book, describ-
ing the sailor both as he actually was and as he was repre-
sented in prose and verse through the centuries. I wish I
could do justice to the interest of this record in the space at
my command. I venture to say that no marine library can
henceforth be considered complete without it. A word of
Mr. Tuckwell as the work of HAWKINS when Provost of Oriel.
Other claimants will please recede into the background.
I have not for some time penetrated into the subterranean
kingdom of the Central London Railway, and so cannot say
whether Mr. DESMOND Coke's new novel, The Golden Key
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), has had as good a show there as its pre-
decessor The Pedestal, which at one time seriously threatened
Miss LENA Ashwell's reputation as the best advertised man,
woman or thing below the surface of the earth. But I have
no dºubt which is the better book of the two. The Golden,
Key, like another panacea which does not disdain the uses
of advertisement, touches the spot—the sore and aching spot
hidden beneath too many of the fancy waistcoats and blouses
of our island race. It is the story of an ordinary rather
lovable young Londoner who is emotionally dumb. Even to
praise, too, must be given to H -
the illustrations, which have
been selected with great dis-
crimination. Many of them
bear witness to Jack's secular
association with the fair sex
and to his sentimental gal-
lantry. Indeed, the matrimo-
nial proclivities of the sailor
were notable two hundred

pointing book. I heard Mr.

Commons, in that vibrant

and they had to use an interpreter.”
Who were the Oriel “Noetics?” It is a question which
would puzzle many informed minds. The Oriel Noetics
were EVELEIGH, CoPLESTON, WHATELY, Dr. ARNOLD, HAMPDEN,
HAwkins, BADEN-Powell, and BLANCO WHITE–eight good men
whose characters are set forth by Mr. TUCKWELL, the “Radical
Parson,” in Pre-Tractarian Orford (SMITH, ELDER). The
book has not the raciness of the same admirable writer's
Reminiscences of Oxford; but then it is made of sterner stuff,
and what it lacks in fun it makes up for in seriousness.
The papers on WHATELY and ARNOLD are models not only of
lucidity and brevity but of sane criticism and sympathetic
understanding. Better biographical essays I have not read
| for many years. One of WHATELY's trenchant obiter dicta
| (shall I say?) is timely to-day: “People who think it easy to
| govern Ireland because it is poor, half-civilised, full of
| ignorance, are like the young medical student who imagined
that he had learned enough of medicine to doctor very little
children.” The old joke about the undergraduate and the
funeral—“I wish it had been a nearer relation"—is fixed by
under the shadow of the
great name of CANNING." Through two ponderous volumes
Captain BAGot leaves the shadow vague. He has no grip
of the man either in his personal relations or in his public
work. There are in all over 800 pages of printed matter,
much of it in the form of laborious notes. Heaps of letters
filling the pages suggest the process of taking them hap-
hazard out of the waste-paper basket. As far as the interest
or value of many is concerned, they had better have been
left there. A solitary gleam of humour, and that borrowed
from CUNNINGHAM's Horace Walpole, illumines the massive
tomes. In CANNING's inscription on the monument to WILLIAM
Pitt it was written, “He lived without ostentation, and
died poor.” . An alderman, his feelings outraged by the
application of such a word to the deceased statesman, pro-
posed to substitute for “poor" the phrase “in indifferent
circumstances.”

refuse destructor for the city of Rotterdam has been placed with

[MARCH 24, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NO OFFENCE INTENDED.
[The following lines are supposed to be addressed to the German
people by the PRIME MINISTER and the FIRST Lond of The ADMIRALTY in
extenuation of their candour during the debate on the Navy Estimates.]
LARGE and belovéd, O amphibious Power,
If we have seemed to you a touch too candid,
If in a really rather awkward hour
We had to let your sacred name be bandied
As that of our most likely foe,
Permit us to explain why this was so.
It all began about November last.
We gathered, in the very act of mailing
Our glorious Two-Power Standard to the mast,
Firm as a Suffragette lashed to a paling,
That you (we never dreamed you would)
Were building Dreadnoughts faster than you could.
Of course we don't dispute your perfect right
(Why, who are we to circumscribe your freedom?)
To keep your KRUPPs a-boiling day and night
With thirty thousand extra hands; you need 'em ;
Your merchant-ships—may they increase !—
Require protection—one Dreadnought apiece.
(Since penning this remark we learn, dear friends,
That your commercial needs are not as stated ;
We hear that Admiral Tirpitz now intends
To have his fighting navy concentrated,
For local objects, nearer home,
And not dispersed about the general foam.*)
And if you said you wouldn't push the pace,
That was no pledge, but just a “declaration,”
Not binding, though it gave us heart of grace,
And nerved us to a little relaxation;
And if thereon you fail to act,
Your bona fides still remains intact.
We should have liked to draw a veil about
Matters that hardly lend themselves to mincing,
Only, you see, we had to blurt them out
Because our own side takes so much convincing;
We had to talk in tragic metres
So as to flabbergast our Little-Fleeters.
Against our will we gave your schemes away,
Not all of them, of course, but all we knew, Sirs;
On painful facts we turned the light of day,
Simply to shock these Armament-Reducers,
Fearing they might, unless we stirred 'em,
Vote for the Fleet's reductio ad absurdum.
Pity, don't blame us; we were bound to hedge,
Bound to employ ambiguous resources,
Exposed upon the cliff's appalling ledge,
With just the choice of two repugnant courses,
The balance being fairly level—
That side the deep sea, and on this the devil.
O. S.
* Last Thursday, in the Reichstag, Admiral von Tirpitz “declared
that henceforth the battle fleet will be kept commissioned exclusively
for a ‘home war,’ i.e., operations in waters immediately adjacent to
German coasts, instead of being kept in a state of preparation for
fighting in any possible region.”—“Daily Mail's" Berlin Correspondent.
An advertisement in The Amateur Gardener:
“Last spring we dug in a good dressing of Vaporite underneath our
pear trees with a view to checking the chrysalides of the Pear Midge.
The results are that we secured a good crop of peas.”
Though checked, the Pear Midge was by no means rebuffed,
and seems to have put in some particularly useful work.

Little Arthur. Mamma, was the Pantomime very funny last
Wednesday?
Mamma. What a queer question. You were there your-
self. You ought to be able to say as well as anyone else.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, I know; but what I mean is, did they
mean it to be funny?
Mamma. Well, yes, I suppose they did. The audience
laughed, didn't they 2
L. A. Oh, yes, they laughed all right, but I didn't always
laugh when they did.
Mamma. Didn't you?
L.A. No, I didn't. When the big man came in dressed as
a landlady most of them laughed. Papa laughed a lot, but
I didn't, and you didn't either, Mamma.
Mamma. No, I thought it vulgar.
L. A. What does “vulgar" mean, Mamma 2
Mamma. Oh, “vulgar” means common and disagreeable.
L. A. Then, of course, nice people don't like disagreeable
things, do they 2 -
Mamma. No, of course not.
L. A. But if Papa laughed he must have liked it.
Papa a nice man?
Mamma. You mustn't speak of your father in that way.
He 's perfectly capable—
L. A. But, Mamma
Mamma. Don't interrupt me. I say he's perfectly capable
of judging for himself in these matters, and it isn't for us to
criticise him. -
L. A. But, Mamma, you said it was vulgar.
Mamma. So it was.
L. A. But if you didn't want to criticise Papa you ought
to have thought it funny, and you ought to have laughed at
it, oughtn't you ?
Mamma. I daresay–I daresay; but then people don't,
always do what they ought. Possibly, if I thought it over
again quite calmly, I might come to think it very funny.
L. A. Oh, no, Mamma, I don't think you could. I couldn't.
If I have to think funny things over quite calmly I can never
laugh at them. Ought I to ?
Mamma. It's close on lunch-time, I’m sure.
L. A. Not very close, Mamma. There 's about a quarter of
an hour. Manma, is a red nose always called a “boko” ”
Mamma. A what 2
L. A. A “boko,” Mamma. The man who dressed up as a
landlady had a very red nose, and when the other man hit
him on it he said he had “ketched him one on the boko.”
They all laughed like anything at that.
Mamma. I suppose it's one of those bits of American
slang. I don't understand it. You'd better ask your father
to explain it.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, I will. But I’m sure it must be very
terrible to have a red nose like that, mustn't it?
Mamma. Yes, dear, it must.
L. A. But if it's so terrible, we oughtn't to laugh at it,
ought we ? You told me we ought never to take motice of
personal peculiarities. Isn't a red nose a personal peculiarity ?
Mamma. Of course it is. -
L. A. But they all laughed at it and talked about it all
through the Pantomime. Don't you remember, Mamma, they
all came up and wanted to warm their hands at it? That
made me laugh a little.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I have been reading your “Cross-

He wanted to know if the building of a battleship means em-
ployment for anybody, and I said I thought it must be so.
And then he said, “Well, why do the Labour people want
us to have no battleships ?”
said that if all the money we spend on battleships was given
to the unemployed, then they wouldn't need to be employed
in ship-building or anything else. Can any of your readers
tell me if that was the right answer? Motheſt of ONE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SPRING GARDENS.
[If you think this article has anything to do
with the L. C. C. you are in error. It is an
instructive contribution by Our Own Horticul-
turist.]
Now that Spring has officially arrived
it is time that we turned our thoughts
to our gardens once more. Perhaps
some of you have been doing this for
several weeks past, but for myself I wait
reverently until the 22nd of March is
here. Then I step out on to the lawn
and summon my head-gardener.
“James,” I say, “the winter is over
at last. What have we got in that big
brown-looking bed in the middle there?”
“Well, Sir,” he says, “we don't seem
to have anything, do we, like?”
“Perhaps there's something down
below that hasn't pushed through yet?”
“Maybe there is.”
“I wish you knew more about it,” I
say angrily ; “I want to bed out the
macaroni there. Have we got a spare
bed, with nothing going on under-
neath 2 ”
“I don't know, Sir. Shall I dig 'em
up and have a look?”
“Yes, perhaps you'd better,” I say.
Between ourselves, James is a man of
no initiative. He has to be told every-
thing.
However, mention of him brings me
to my first rule for young gardeners—
Never sow Spring Onions and New
Potatoes in the same bed.
I did this by accident last year. The
fact is, when the onions were given to
me I quite thought they were young
daffodils; a mistake anyone might make.
Of course, I don't generally keep daffodils
and potatoes together; but James swore
that the hard round things were tulip
bulbs. It is perfectly useless to pay
your head-gardener half-a-crown a week
if he doesn't know the difference between
potatoes and tulip bulbs. Weil, anyhow,
there they were, in the Herbaceous
Border together, and they grew up side
by side; the onions getting stronger
every day, and the potatoes more sensi-
tive. At last, just when they were ripe
for picking, I found that the young
onions had actually brought tears to the
| eyes of the potatoes—to such an extent
that the latter were too damp for baking
or roasting, and had to be mashed.
Now, as everybody knows, mashed pota-
toes are beastly.
The Rhubarb Border
gives me more trouble than all the rest
of the garden. I started it a year ago
with the idea of keeping the sum off the
young carnations. It acted excellently,
and the complexion of the flowers was
improved tenfold. Then one day I dis-
covered James busily engaged in pulling
up the rhubarb.
“What are you doing?" I cried. “Do
you want the young carnations to go all
brown 2''
“I was going to send some in to the
cook,” he grumbled.
“To the cool. 1 What do you mean?
Rhubarb isn't a vegetable.”
“No, it’s a fruit.”
I looked at James anxiously. He had
a large hat on, and the sun couldn't
have got to the back of his neck.
“My dear James,” I said, “I don't
pay you half-a-crown a week for being
funny. Perhaps we had better make it
two shillings in future.”
However, he persisted in his theory
that in the spring people stewed rhubarb
in tarts, and ate it!
Well, I have discovered since that
this is actually so. People really do grow
it in their gardens, not with the idea of
keeping the sun off the young carna-
tions, but under the impression that it
is a fruit. Consequently I have found
it necessary to adopt a firm line with
my friends' rhubarb. On arriving at
any house for a visit, the first thing I
say to my host is, “May I see your
rhubarb bed 2 I have heard such a lot
about it.”
“By all means,” he says, feeling
rather flattered, and leads the way into
the garden.
“What a glorious sunset,” I say,
pointing to the west.
“Isn't it?” he says, turning round;
and then I surreptitiously drop a pint
of weed-killer on the bed.
Next morning I get up early and
paint the roots of the survivors with
iodine.
Once my host, who for some reason
had got up early too, discovered me.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“Just painting the roots with iodine,”
I said, “to prevent the rhubarb falling
out.”
“To prevent what 2"
“To keep the green fly away,” I cor-
rected myself. “It’s the new French
intensive system.”
But he was suspicious, and I had to
leave two or three stalks untreated. We
had those for lunch that day. There was
only one thing for a self-respecting man
to do. I obtained a large plateful of the
weed and emptied the cream jug over it.
Then I took a mouthful of the pastry,
gave a little start, and said, “Oh, is this
rhubarb 2 I'm sorry, I didn't know.”
Whereupon I pushed my plate away
and started on the cheese.
Asparagus.
Asparagus wants watching very care-
fully. It requires to be tended like a
child. Frequently I wake up in the
middle of the night and wonder if James
has remembered to put the hot-water
bottle in the asparagus bed. Whenever
I get up to look I find that he has for-
gotten.
He tells me to-day that he is beginning
to think that the things which are coming
up now are not asparagus after all, but
young hyacinths. This is very annoying.
I am inclined to fancy that James is not
the man he was. For the sake of his
reputation in the past I hope he is not.
Potting out.
I have spent a busy morning potting
out the masturtiums. We have them in
three qualities—mild, medium, and full.
Nasturtiums are extremely peppery
flowers, and take offence so quickly that
the utmost tact is required to pot them
successfully. In a general way all the
red or reddish flowers should be potted
as soon as they are old enough to stand
it, but it is considered bad form among
horticulturists to pot the white.
James has been sowing the roses. I
wanted all the pink ones in one bed, and
all the yellow ones in another, and so
on ; but James says you never can tell
for certain what colour a flower is going
to be until it comes up. Of course, any
fool could tell then.
“You should go by the picture on the
outside of the packet,” I said.
“They're very misleading,”
James.
“Anyhow, they must be all brothers
in the same packet.”
“You might have a brother with red
hair,” says James.
I hadn't thought of that.
Grafting.
Grafting is when you try short ap-
proaches over the pergola in somebody
else's garden, and break the best tulip.
You mend it with a ha'penny stamp
and hope that nobody will notice; at
any rate not until you have gone away
on the Monday. Of course in your own
garden you never want to graft.
I hope in a future article to be allowed
—even encouraged—to refer to such
things as The Most Artistic Way to
Frame Cucumbers, How to Stop Tomatoes
Blushing (the Homoeopathic method of
putting them next to the French beans
is now discredited), and Spring Fashions
in For Glores. But for the moment I
have said enough. The great thing to
remember in gardening is that flowers,
fruits and vegetables alike can only
be cultivated with sympathy. Special
attention should be given to backward
and delicate plants. They should be
encouraged to make the most of them-
selves. Never forget that flowers, like
ourselves, are particular about the
company they keep. If a hyacinth
droops in the celery bed, put it among
the pansies. -
But above all, mind, a firm hand with
the rhubarb. A. A. M.

HOW I ADAPTED.
I HAVE been a good deal worried
lately over my play. To speak candidly,
so have some other people, but these
were chiefly managers, strong men, who
could endure in silence. And usually
did. The trouble appeared to be that,
though my central idea was excellent
and dramatic enough (Adolphus in love
with Angelina, who is betrothed to
Edwin) the treatment was not so satis-
factory. Or so I gathered from the
advice of the only friend whom I could
persuade to read it. What he said was
briefly, “Adapt | Look about you,
select your management, and adapt
accordingly. Don't be discouraged by
one failure. Adapt again!” So I
adapted—with what result the following
extracts from my notebook will show.

tivated but enormously wealthy, loves

ST. CECILIA AT THE SALES;
on, THE NEW HANDMAID of CoMMERCE.
MESSRs. Torrey and Dems, of the great
Emporium on Campden Hill, announce
a monster musical entertainment to be
held under the dome of their new build-
ings on May Day in celebration of the
25th anniversary of their association
with Kensington. The proprietors, with
an enterprise which does them infinite
credit, have placed Sir Edw ARD ELGAR's
Symphony in the forefront of their pro-
gramme. This epoch-making work, we
may note, will be conducted for the first
time by Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, and the
sermon will, of course, be preached by
Dr. Torrey, who comes from America
for the purpose.
The programme of the great tercen-
tenary celebration at Messrs. Black and
Crosswell's is now complete. Naturally
music forms a prominent feature in the
function, and the proprietors are to be
congratulated on their originality in in-
cluding in the programme Sir Edward
CLGAR's Symphony, which will be con-
ducted for the first time by Mr. Wilkie
BARD. Mr. Josef Hol.BROOKE has com-
posed a superb set of Symphonic Waria-
tions, entitled “Pickled Walnuts,” and
Mr. GRANVILLE BANTOCK, already famous
for his Oriental compositions, will con-
duct a new Symphonic Poem illustrating
the life, adventures and death of a
Bombay Duck.
Messrs. Bark and Bark, the well-known
Kensington outfitters, propose to com-
memorate their jubilee, which falls on
the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo,
by a grand orchestral concert, at which
Sir Edw ARD ISLGAR's Symphony will be
conducted for the first time by Mr.
LEwis WALLER. The proprietors, we are
glad to see, have announced that in
future the style and title of the firm
will be John Sebastian Bark and Sons,
and that all relatives, direct or collateral,
of their great namesake will be allowed
a discount of 25 per cent. on cash pur-
chases. --
Messrs. Pinker and Mute, the well-
known undertakers, propose to celebrate
the centenary of the establishment of
their firm by a Musical Festival, at which
all the compositions performed will be
in harmony with the nature of their
business. Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton, who
will act as conductor, has composed a
new Symphonie Funèbre in honour of
the occasion, and the programme will
include Gounod's Funeral March of a
Mariomette and STRAUss's Tod und Verklä-
rung. We are also glad to mote that Sir
EDWARD ELGAR's Symphony will be con-
ducted in the Silence Room for the first
time by Lord ShurTLEworth.
Messrs. Bunter and Guzzard, of Berke-
ley Square, announce a most attractive
Conceit for April 1st, which happens to
be the birthday of Mrs. Guzzard, as well
as of the late Prince BISMARCK. In
honour of so auspicious an occasion,
M. Ritz has most kindly undertaken to
conduct Sir Edward ELGAR's Symphony
for the first time, and the National
Anthem, which will open the programme,
will be prefaced by a new Golden Roll
on the drums.
Messrs. Dormy and Mendoza, the pro-
prietors of the famous house so long
consecrated to the habiliments of Mor-
pheus, or “slumberwear,” as of late we
have been taught to call them, are
celebrating their diamond jubilee next
month, and have resolved to mark the
occasion by a grand musical demonstra-
tion. Being anxious to strike out a
wholly new line in the entertainment,
they have decided to make Sir Edward
ELGAR's Symphony the pièce de résistance,
and this monumental work will be con-
ducted for the first time in the Pyjama
Saloon by Sir John Fisher. This great
sailor has also kindly promised to sing his
favourite appeal to the nation, Dormi
pure, together with several German
Wiegenlieder of a most deliciously mar-
cotic and tranquillising character.
Messrs. Brown, Jones and Robinson,
the world-famous manufacturers of hy-
gienic hosiery, propose to commemorate
the coming of age of young Mr. Cad-
waladr Jones by a magnificent musical
demonstration on the roof garden which
now crowns their superb premises in
Oxbridge Circus. After long and care-
ful deliberation they have decided to
make Sir Edward ELGAR's Symphony the
clow of the entertainment, and have
been fortunate in securing no less dis-
tinguished a celebrity than Lord Guthrie,
the famous Scottish judge, to conduct
this work for the first time. Lord
GUTHRie has always been an ardent
musician, and he wields the baton with
a tact, an amiability and a charm which
would fit him for any society, no matter
how exalted.
“We give it up, unless it be that the one is
the mould of fashion, like Hamlet's father, and
the other isn't.”—Manchester Erening Chronicle.
This must have been hereditary. Any-
how, we know that Hamlet himself was
the “mould of form" because Ophelia
said so.
“At present there are but two honorary free-
men of the borough of Darlington—the Right
Hon. Frederick Sleigh and Earl Roberts.”
Northern Echo.
By a curious coincidence the names of
these two veterans come next to each
other on the rolls of freedom of several
other boroughs.

BENEDick.
YE lessening company of single men,
Weep for the bitter tidings I impartſ
For Benedick is booked, the wary Ben,
Old Benedick, esteemed in every art
Second to none:
E'en he, for all his richly-coloured past,
Has done it once too often—he has done
It once too often—now the die is cast,
And Benedick, our chief, is caught at last.
Ay, weep for Benedick' He was well wont
Himself to weep when others went astray.
Has it not ever been his counsel, Don't
To them that would 2 Have we not beard him say,
How tame, how trite
Was wedlock 2 And, with suffering eyes grown dim,
Mourning some fallen comrade's evil plight,
Oſt would he vow, with more than common vim,
To see us further ere we wept for him.
He was no scorner of the sex. Not he'
To him the merest flutter of a gown
Was draw enow; but, like the busy bee,
He loved to sip from every flower, one down
T'other come on ;
Seeking, or when the owl complaining mopes
Or otherwise, t'improve each hour that shone,
Yet ever coy, and ever raising hopes
For ever vain, so well he knew the rºpes.
And you, dear charmers of those earlier days,
Will you not weep what time you hear his fall?
You will recall, I trust, his airy ways,
His nods, th’ alluring becks he wooed withal,
- His wreathéd smiles;
Also I charge you that you should attend
The last sad rites, thronging the pews and aisles,
For, as a fact, one-half of you would lend
A gloomy &clat to his fearful end.
But you, O mothers, which of you will shed
One tear, one kindly tear, on this lost swain 2
For this is he for whom your nets were spread
So often and so utterly in vain
(Wily old bird').
You will not weep, go to ! But we, his peers,
We, relicts of an ever-dwindling herd,
Reft of our champion and our chief of years,
May be excused some horror-stricken tears.
Ah, me! And yet what profit that we mourn
And tell our loss in due and wailful chant 2
For Benedick is booked ' The nuptial bourn
Yawns for his trembling footsteps—and you can't
Get out of that '
Better it were to rally 'neath the blow
And, with sad foresight, circulate the hat,
Clubbing together, that he may not go
Giftless to wed; and it comes cheaper so.
DUM-DUM.

THE NUT.
A STUDY IN PRIDE.
THERE are many forms of pride, and
all are amusing to study, but I doubt if
any variety is more satisfying and viva-
cious than that of a man standing in the
pit of a music-hall who happens to know
personally one of the performers on the
stage. I say this because I know;
because I observed such a man the
other evening, and I saw his honest face
light up as he passed the word round
among his neighbours, who until then
had been strangers but were now
admirers; and their rapture at being so
He seemed to be an old habitué, for
without a programme he had known all
that was coming. And then suddenly
he came to his own; for, “Watch this,”
he said, as a new number went up; “this
is good. I know a chap in this. I'll
tell you when he comes on.” We
watched and waited. It was a furious
knockabout sketch, the scene of which
was a grocer's shop, staffed by comic
grocers. Humorist after humorist came
upon the stage, fell over each other, and
went through the usual antics ; but
there was no news of our friend's
friend.
And then at last a young man, more
than commonly foolish, representing an
aristocratic customer, rused on. “That's
him,” said the man, “tha's old Charley.
He's a nut, I can tell yout' I had not
heard the phrase before. A nut. But
it had, like all London slan, its merits.
A nut, I take it, is what weised to call
a dog, with a touch more olirrespons-
ibility, and high-spirited idycy. It
seemed to ſit old Charley, whº was, by
the way, quite young. He ind lged in
a variety of eccentricities. I can magine
nothing more nuttish.
“Isn't he a nut?” the man asled us
all with a radiant sweeping glane of
inquiry. How could we disappoint him?
I caught myself nodding in acquiescene.
A nut, surely. “Oh, he's a boy, I
promise you. I've had some rare times
with old Charley,” his friend went on.
“You should see him at Forest Gate'
I tell you he's a nut.”
The nut continued to do llis best to
prove his character. He screwed an
eyeglass in his eye, he dashed the girls
under the chin, he fell over his walking-
stick, he flung his tall hat on the ground.
His friend was in ecstasies. “Good old
Charley !” he cried again; “isn't he a
nut? By Jingo, but he's a nut!”
I left him exulting in the acquaint-
anceship, while the youths round him
glowed in the glory of even the tem-
porary acquaintance of a man who knew
intimately a nut on the music - hall
stage. -
And, after all, that is no small thing.
. THE STATION PATHWAY.
TheRE's a rock upon a headland
Where the hoarse gulls wheel and cry,
Where the fierce waves break in thunder,
Flinging foam across the sky;
It was there we watched the sunset,
You and I, in days gone by.
There's a little country orchard
Where the rosy apples fall,
There we two, one autumn morning,
Sought them where the grass grew tall;
And we ate them in the shadow
Of the crumbling, moss-grown wall.
Even though these recollections
Never fail to wake a thrill,
There's a narrow gravel pathway
That to me is dearer still,
Sweeter, though defaced by hoardings,
Marred with many a garish bill.
When I journey to the station,
Morn and evening, to and fro,
Floods of gratitude o'erwhelm me
As along that path I go;
It was there that I said, “Will you?”
It was there you answered, “No 1"

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 15.
—Truly the wind is tempered to the
shorn lamb. DiNizulu being played out,
tried, convicted and sentenced, it seemed
that time would hang heavy on the
hands of the British Branch of the Satish
Chatterjee Family. It is true LONG John
O'ConnoR, whose altitude is so great that
he can easily keep one eye on Ireland
and another on South Africa, complains
that the Chief has been “deprived of
his own clothing.” Members reflect that,
after all, this doesn't necessarily amount
to much in Natal.
Just as DiNizulu disappears from the
scene, curtailing opportunity for the
Chatterjees to show how treacherous,
how cruel, how lost to all sense of
honour and humanity are their country-
men representing England in foreign
parts, enters the Mad Mullah. SEELY,
who has of late had some correspondente
with him, took the opportunity of re-
marking that “anyone less mad than
this potentate he could not imagine.”
“Hear! hear!” assented BYLEs of
BRADFORD (First Baron, cr. 19–).
Certainly, as extracts from his corre-
spondence read to the Committee show,
he is a polite letter-writer. Others in
course of debate described him as a
bloodthirsty, cruel despot whose iniqui-
ties were equalled only by those of the
KALIFA.
MANGNALL's QUESTIONS AshLEY came to
the conclusion that “the only thing to
do is to kill him and have nothing more
to do with him.” This last portion
of the remark characteristically partakes
of the character of the superfluous sup-
plementary question. House felt that
the first proposition comprised the
whole.
REES of India, inexorably logical,
objected that “you cannot kill a Mullah.
As soon as he is dead, another turns up.”
Which, if one remembers rightly, was
the case with those early Turks the
AMURATHs.
SATISH CHATTERJEE RUTHERFORD, dis-
tantly alluding to the Mullah as “this
gentleman,” hoped that if he were cap-
tured he would be granted a fair trial.
At this veiled attempt to “get in one”
in connection with the Indian branch
of the family, Mr. BUCHANAN truculently
blew his nose.
It was left to John DiLLON to disclose
the amiable, hospitable nature of the
Mullah. Five years ago, when JoHN
happened to be more prominently on
the warpath “agin the Government,”
he received a lengthy communication
from the sympathetic Mullah, inviting
him to go and spend three months with
him. None of your niggardly week-end

be spent in close companionship. Com-
mitteelingered lovingly over the prospect
here opened : the Mullah and JoHN
DiLLON, seated by the camp fire, perhaps
having exchanged hats, smoking the
pipe of Peace, the Mullah dwelling on
the arbitrary conduct of successive occu-
pants of the Colonial Office, John gently
but persistently endeavouring to lead
the conversation in direction of WILLIAM
O'BRIEN's connection with the Irish Par-
liamentary Party and some traits in the
character of TIM HEALY.
Unfortunately J. D.'s public engage-
ments elsewhere prevented his packing
up a few things and going out to Somali-
land. Whereby the world is poorer by
lack of a picturesque episode.
Business dome.—Colonial votes in Com-
mittee of Supply.
Tuesday.—Just as well the Strangers'
Galleries fore and aft were empty to-day.
Otherwise panic with possibly deplora-
ble results might have taken place.
House crowded in every part. Members
on both sides wound up to rare pitch of
excitement. In speech a model of
lucidity, occupying only an hour in
delivery, ADMIRAL McKENNA expounded
Navy Estimates for coming year.
PRINCE ARTHUR came next with speech
towhich exceptional emphasis of delivery,
unusual solemnity of manner, added

Me show you some de bery best" cattle-drive' in Somali-

weight. Unfortunately plan involved
setting forth of some intricate figures.
Figures not his strong point. As he
proceeded to demonstrate how, year by
year up to 1912 inclusive, Germany will
be overtaking British Fleet in respect
of number of Dreadnoughts, there
loomed out of the fog four phantom
ships, which, falling in line with the
rest, hopelessly complicated matters.
That a detail prosaically corrected by
the ADMIRAL and the PREMIER. There re-
mained the conviction possessing PRINCE
ARTHUR's mind, forcibly conveyed to
listening throng that, “for the first time
in comparatively modern history, the
country is face to face with a naval situa-
tion so new, so dangerous, that it is
difficult thoroughly to realise all its
importance.”
PREMIER followed, his mood and manner
deepening impression created by pre-
ceding speakers. Whilst correcting
PRINCE ARTHUR's figures, and demonstrat-
ing that in 1912 Great Britain will have
afloat twenty Dreadnoughts against Ger-
many's seventeen, he made significant
admission. Twelve months ago, stand-
ing in the same place, speaking on same
theme, he had boasted that in the matter
of building these great ships Great
Britain enjoyed substantial advantage.
Could turn out a Dreadnought in twenty-

and was voted easily best. I wore white
satin with a pattern of bank-notes
printed round the edge of the skirt, an
Empire sash of golden tissue with
bullion-fringed ends, gold coins on my
neck and arms, and my hair powdered
with gold dust. My partner was one of
the Labour Members, Bill Batters, of
Houndsditch. He had on the dress of his
former calling—corduroys—with a hod
on his back. He was great fun. His
eyes and smile aren't at all bad, and the
way he says, “Wotsay?” and “Dunno”
is simply quite. I think of adopting both
expressions. Wee-Wee was my vis-à vis.
Her frock meant landed property. It was
carried out in green chiffon-velours, for
parks and meadows, you know, and she
had little models of their different places
on her head and on each shoulder. She
danced with Jack Jupp, M.P.-the one
who's always leading processions about.
Before he got into Parliament and began
leading people about, he was a carpenter,
and he had on the dress he used to carpent
in, and carried a plane in his hand.
Other quadrilles were the Home Rule
one (arranged by Mrs. O'Howler, wife of
The O'Howler), a Tariff Reform quad-
rille, a Free Trade quadrille, and a
Socialist one, in which they all took each
other's partners and did whatever steps
they pleased, paying no attention to the
music; and ever so many more.
The day before the dance, Popsy,
Lady Ramsgate, had come to me in the
rettiest, girlishest perplexity to know if
f could suggest something for her
quadrille. I said I thought it would be
suitable if she arranged an Old English
one !
Oh, my dear! who d'you think I met
again at the Masses-and-Classes Dance?
My old friend the Socialist leader, Count
Outa Telbows, of Hungary! I asked
him what he'd been doing with himself
all this time, and he said he'd been
touring in India, teaching the natives to
make a particularly deadly kind of
bomb. I was very angry, and asked
him how dared he do such things? He
said it didn't want any daring; that the
authorities had been most kind and
courteous to him. He's a wretch, of
course; but he's much improved by
shaving off that horrid beard, and his
waltzing is simply dilly He asked why
I'd “deserted the Cause?” I said, Oh,
I'd had heaps of Causes since then, and,
besides, the Socialists went too far. And
he said, Would Igraciously tell him how
far they ought to go? And I said, “They
oughtn't to go at all.” This closed the
conversation.
Oh, my sweet friend I must tell you
of a perfectly lovely trick (with a wager
hanging to it) that Wee-Wee and I
played on Aunt Goldie. First, it must
be understood that the poor old dear's

Now that the Spring will soon be
upon us, and we can therefore expect
to be skating within a reasonably short
time, perhaps a few phrases for the use
of such of our foreign friends as may be
sampling the land of fogs at the moment

the frost to last. Why do you bring the

that is my skate-blade; only it was made
in Germany, and the gardener has been
using it during the summer months for
weeding. Yes, very trying. Do not
forget the cold tea. What is whisky?"

It is cold. It is not cold. It would
be warmer if it were not so cold. Quite,

neath. Can you skate? I can skate.

you, I prefer to watch. I do indeed.

all ? May I get you some tea, some
coffee, some whisky, some beer, some
buns 2 Thank you, I have a saveloy in
a paper bag. How thoughtful of you.
Not at all; it was my sister's when we
started out.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I FIND it unfortunate that the scheme of John GALsworthy's
latest novel, Fraternity (HEINEMANN), should start out from
certain details of an immense improbability. It is unbeliev-
able that a journalist in criticising a picture should publish
a hint of the relations existing between the artist's husband
and the model who posed for it. It is equally unbelievable
that a woman of Bianca Dallison's alleged refinement—the
author perhaps insists a little too much on the hereditary
culture of his rather middle-class Kensingtonians—should
silently hand the critique to her husband, and conclude
from his embarrassment that it was high time for a definite
rupture of the marital tie. In any case, if this was the final
straw which broke the camel's spine, we ought to have been
told a good deal more about the previous load—always
a large element in the success of the final straw.
As the title of Mr.
by CLARKSON), and the scenes are set in London, with just a
glimpse, for the big situation in the third Act, of Revolu-
tionary Paris. Yronme de Cassagnac (heroine) and her
noble father are refugees from the Terror. To support them
both, Mademoiselle becomes dancing-mistress in the house of
a titled but plebeian English family (refined comic relief).
She is insulted on her way through the park, and rescued in
the nick of time by—why, by whom but the mysterious
“M. Lenoir,” teacher of singing. Subsequently the hero
and heroine are transported (somewhat clumsily) to Paris,
under a false passport describing them as M. and Mme.
Perrin. The effect is that, to quiet a threatening mob,
high-born Yvonne has to fling her arms about the nameless
M. Lemoir and proclaim him for her beloved husband. And
after all, when M. Lenoir turns up in the final scene to claim
his bride, behold the poor tutor, powdered and sworded, has
blossomed into M. le Comte de Mérigny, member of one of the
noblest families in France. To repeat, Noblesse Oblige should
triumph as Romantic Melodrama. I could even, if put to it,

from the world of actuality. Mr. GALsworthy is incapable
of writing without charm and distinction, but I do wish he
would not look for his illustrations quite so high or quite so
low. He opens with a wasteful and laborious comparison
between a patch of gentian-blue sky and a costume of the
same nuance in a shop window; and he is not very pleasant
when he introduces the loves of a spaniel as a background
to his human intrigue.
“M. E. FRANCIs" is a writer from whom pleasant experience
has taught me to expect so much that I was the more
disappointed when Noblesse Oblige (LoNG) proved, for me
at least, quite unworthy of her reputation. Indeed, remem-
bering certain deserved successes at the Garrick Theatre,
I was forced to the theory that Mrs. BLUNDELI, had been
tempted by the prospect of more dramatic fleshpots, and had
regarded Noblesse Oblige less as a novel than as a play in
the making. And, with perhaps a trifle more fighting thrown
in, it should serve excellently for an entertainment of the
right Beaucaire-Pimpernel blend. The period is 1794 (wigs

Lord Loch), FRANCIs HoRNER, ANDREw CLEPHANE, and others,
in their youth, and now and then they contain characteristic
evidences of youthful indiscretion and candour. The editors
seem to have suppressed nothing. The result is in the main
entertaining, and it certainly cannot be disregarded by any
future biographer of BROUGHAM, if such should arise. Just
now, however, the famous Chancellor is under a cloud; but
if ever there was a mine containing a mother-lode of gold
it is Brougham and His Early Friends.

THE DETACHMENT OF PRENDERBY.
The NAVY QUESTION: PATRIOTISM AND PARTY.
“HAVE you been reading your Yellow Press?” I asked
Prenderby last Saturday.
“My ‘Yellow Press” ” he replied innocently; “tell me
about that.”
“It’s the name,” I said, “which the Radical rufflers give
to the Tory rufflers.”
“Ah, the buttercup calling the dandelion yellow”
“Yes; and the buttercups are just now abusing the
dandelions for making Party capital out of the Navy scare.”
“Is New Zealand a dandelion ?”
“New Zealand is a peach,” I said.
“I, too,” said Prenderby, “am a bit of a wall-fruit myself.
I sit out and watch, where I can see most of the sport with-
out taking sides. So when you talk about the Navy being
made a Party question, I ask myself, without prejudice, who
began that game 2 And my answer, without prejudice, is that
it began inside the Cabinet. Here was ASQUITH, who knew
exactly the needs of the Navy, but found his house divided
against itself. He found Lloyd-GEORGE and WINSTON
CHURCHILL (not to mention one or two names of greater
weight) bitterly opposed to the course which his duty, as
responsible for the Nation's safety, marked out for him.
A bigger man would have let his Party break up rather than
yield on a point of national necessity. But he preferred at all
costs to keep his Party together, and so made a compromise.
Unfortunately he had still to persuade the rank and file of
his followers to accept even these half-and-half measures;
and in this effort he grew more portentous than he meant,
and then the trouble began.
“I confess,” continued Prenderby, having got his head,
“that I should have been better pleased with the Unionists
if, after entering the strongest possible protest, they had
seen their way to wash their hands of the business and to
avoid all appearance of seeking to make Party capital out of
it. Two yellows do not make a white. But, after all, no
honest statesman can wash his hands of a matter that con-
cerns the very existence of the Nation ; and in any case an
Opposition would be more than human if it declined to treat
as a Party question what had already been forced into that
category, as I have shown, by the action of a Prime Minister
who apparently was more concerned to keep his Party to-
gether than to assure the safety of the Empire.
“I have often heard my Radical friends indulge in pleasant-
ries over what they called the “Khaki" Election of 1900.
Well, if the next one is a Blue-jacket Election, they will have
their own side to thank for it. Heavens ! How they give
themselves away!”
“Anyhow,” I said, being anxious to divert him from a
line of argument which pained me—“anyhow, both sides are
agreed that Germany is at perfect liberty to follow her own
devices.”
“That unanimity,” replied Prenderby, “is to me the most
deplorable feature in the whole controversy. No nation,
with even the minimum of intelligence requisite for self-
preservation, permits a neighbour, however friendly, to mass
troops upon their common frontier without adequate reason
given. When the Boers sent us their ultimatum, and fol-
lowed it up over the border a few hours later, it would have
been futile for us to try to persuade them that our troops
had been thrown into Natal for the sake of its climatic advan-
tages. Well, the North Sea is one of our frontiers, isn't it?”
“Without a map at hand,” said I, “I cannot verify your
allegation. But I assume that you would not go so far as to
ask Germany for an explanation of her accelerated pro-
ramme?”
war; and I happen to be congenitally addicted to a pre-
ference for Peace. Besides, a great nation does not ask
these questions aloud, but only of herself; and she answers
them out of her own head ; and she acts accordingly. She
makes timely provision for rendering her rival's ambitions
hopeless. And it is because I am convinced that a course
of weakness and delay and Party time service is the surest
means of keeping those ambitions alive that I, who belong
to no Party but the Party of honourable Peace, protest against
a policy that is bringing us daily nearer to the unspeakable
horrors of war. There are still two days before BALFour
makes his final appeal, and of course ASQUITH may reconsider
his position. But I gather that he intends to show a firm
front to the Opposition; in other words, to show a flabby
back to the Little-Fleeters in his own Cabinet.”
“With great respect,” said I, “are you not the victim of
panic?” -
“My dear fool,” replied Prenderby, mislaying for the
moment his habitual courtesy, “this is not a question of
courage. No one accuses Germany of cowardice for keeping
up that stupendous army of hers, nor regards HALDANE as
a very brave fellow because he is unctuously satisfied with
next to none at all. We are not proposing to play twenty
men against a German Rugby fifteen. We could afford to
give them odds at that game, and if we were beaten we could
always smile and look forward to the return match. But in
a naval war, which is a rather more serious game than
mud-larking, if an island race like ours is beaten there is
no return match—not, at least, for that generation. And
you only have to knock up against a few casual mines, and
your narrow margin, and more, may vanish automatically.
No, the bravest nation in the world cannot afford to take
risks in the game of war.”
“Well, what do you want?” I said, with excusable
petulance. “Would you have the Tories in 2 I'm told
they're very short of big men.”
“I offer no opinion,” said Prenderby, “on the subject of
their size; but I would sooner be governed by pigmies who
are agreed on a sound naval policy than by giants who differ
about it.” -
“Prenderby,” I said, “it has long been my custom to
consult you on grave political questions because of your
motorious detachment of mind. But to-day it seems to be
your malevolent purpose to try to shatter my cherished
belief in a Government which not only represents the flower
of British intelligence, but is supported with almost me-
chanical devotion by the greatest majority of modern times.”
“My boy,” said Prenderby, on a paternal note, “as far as
domestic matters are concerned, I don't care a brass button
as to which side nominally governs the country. I can with
calmness leave to the common sense of the public to see that its
will is carried out on points that intelligibly affect its pocket
and general welfare. But as regards the Army, the Navy,
and Foreign Affairs, in which the public needs instruction
and leadership, I would use the best men from both sides.
I should like a Coalition Ministry, a Ministry of All the
Patriots. It is an intolerable scandal that the country cannot
enjoy the invaluable services of a man like Edward GREY,
without having at the same time to suffer the attentions of -
well, you know whom, simply because the latter happens
for the moment to call himself by the same Party name
of Liberal, though their two standards are as wide apart
as the Poles.”
“And in such a Government,” I said, with my best irony,
“you would accept the Admiralty, if it were offered you?”
“If you were their only alternative, yes,” said Prenderby.
My reply was marked by considerable dignity. I said:
“You are at perfect liberty, like Germany, to do
or think what you dam well please.” And I wished him an
O. S.
“That,” said Prenderby gravely, “would mean immediate extraordinarily good day.

received the same answer—namely, “About four-and-a-half or five miles").
A BOND STREET VISION.
Down the street the sunshine glances on
the crowds that come and go,
Fashion treads in Springtime's footsteps
where the plate-glass windows glow,
But I turn where ice and marble's stern
simplicity set forth
Noble fish from noble rivers of the grey
and snow-bound North;
And I pause with glance uncertain, as
of one who seems to know
In a dream the vanished features of
some ºriend of long ago, -
For I see in state reposing such a salmon
as I keep
As a rule for grim encounters on the
closen casts of sleep;
As a rule, yet somehow surely has that
glittering bulk before
Agonised my waking vision by a real
and solid shore.
Fifty pounds? so once I made him, on
the evening when I held
Him — or else his double—beaten in that
reach below Dunkeld.
There he lies, superb and royal, clean as
when he left the tide,
With the bloom of snow and lilac mantled
on his gleaming side,
While his shoulders, proudly arching,
wear a lustre hard and bright,
Borrowed in Norwegian fiords from the
fitful Arctic light,
~~~~ --- ---
Or where schools of running salmon leap
beneath the summer stars
Where the North Sea breakers thunder
over Highland river bars.
So for me the scene is altered, and in
spirit I am whirled
Far away from crowded pavements;
fairest faces in the world,
Roofs and chimneys, frocks and fashions
—all are flown as shadows fly,
And I see a stately river 'neath a soft
October sky.
Once again I see the Autumn banked
and blazoned where the trees
Shed her wealth of reds and yellows on
the moisture-laden breeze;
Oak's pale orange, beech's russet, in a
splendid shower are blown
Where the ousel dips and whistles as
he flits from stone to stone;
And I hear the roar and mutter as the
stream comes sweeping down
Black and foam-flecked round the red-
stone, clearing to a golden brown,
Slipping past the scattered birchwoods,
where the deer come down at night,
Amber o'er the shelving shallows—on
the shingles lisping light;
And I feel the thrilling magic of the
greenheart's spring and sway,
And a favourite fly is working fully
twenty yards away,
And behind the sunken boulder, where
the slack swirls smooth as oil,

T -v- a rºw c- Fºº cº-
has enquired, once erery hour, how far it is to Ballymaloney, and has now for the third time
“Thank heaven we 'RE KEEPING PACE with it, ANywAY.”
Lo! the deep is agitated with a mighty
wave and boil,
And I see for half a moment that
stupendous tail and back
Wallow wide upon the surface in a
leisurely attack;
There's a heave of sudden silver —
there's a flounce—a savage pull,
And again the reel is racing as he gets
it fair and full!
Now the stormy sunset's touching all
the distant tops with light,
And he's rolling spent and helpless
from the long-contested fight,
Shattering the quiet surface into rings
of rippling foam,
Where the gillie waits his moment ere
the gaff is driven home. . . .
Then—ah then—the rod springsstraight-
ly and a worn and broken trace,
Free again, springs back to strike me
like a whiplash in the face;
And I see the great fish rally—see the
wave that marks his track
O'er the dim unfriendly shallows till
the deep receives him back!
So the vision fades and passes, gone are
mountain, wood and cloud,
And the voice of streams is lost in roar
of traffic and of crowd.
Shall I leave him unacknowledged ? or
in fond remembrance—yes,
Why not have at least a portion sent
along to my address?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARCH 31, 1909.
THE UNIVERSITY BOAT RACE.
[EDITOR. Let me see, the Boat Race is
meat Saturday. You might write an
article about it.
AUTHOR. Certainly, if you desire it.
But I don't know one end of an oar
from the other.
EDITOR. One end 's flatter than the
other; that's how you can tell.
AUTHOR. Thanks. I'll point that out.
EDITOR. Don't be too technical. IIadn't
you better take a shilling from the stamp
drawer and run down to Putney this
afternoon, and then come back and do
us a mice breezy sketch 2
AUTHOR. By all means.]
Mortlake is a small town in the
Kingston Parliamentary Division of
Surrey, situate some six miles west of
London as the crow flies. Its popula-
tion at the last census was estimated
roughly at 7,774, though many experts
consider that 7,775 would have been
nearer the mark. However, even this
figure will be exceeded on Saturday
next, when a party of nine Putney resi-
dents educated at Cambridge University
will journey thither by water, followed
(or possibly preceded) by a similar party
of nine who claim Oxford University for
their Alma Mater.
This exodus from Putney is now an
annual event, which is eagerly looked
forward to by the young participants.
Why, I am often asked, do they always
select Mortlake as the object of their
visit? Are there not more interesting
resorts in the neighbourhood 2 Before
I answer this question, let us take a
look at the eighteen young gentlemen
who will join the excursion this year.
Perhaps that will help us to an apprecia-
tion of their partiality for this fascinating
village.
[AUTHOR. Am I being breezy enough 2
EDITOR. I can't think what on earth
!you imagine you're doing.
AUTHOR. It was partly the guard's
fault—I went on to Mortlake by mistake.
Such an interesting place.]
First and foremost, primus inter pares,
as CICERo used to say, we have Mr.
STUART, the doyen of the Light Blue
party. Mr. STUART has been to Mortlake
no less than four times already, and
is still as enthusiastic as ever over its
historic associations. He will be able to
point out to Mr. Rosher the famous
tablet to Sir Philip FRANCIS (“JUNIUs.”
FRANCIS, as he was known to his inti-
mates), erected in the parish church to
his memory in the year 1818. The
church itself, as Mr. WILLIAMS (who has
been here once before) may remind him,
occupies the site of an edifice of the
14th century, the tower still dating
from 1543. This tablet is a favourite one
of Mr. STUART's, and on three previous
occasions he has reverently called the
attention of his confrères to it, before
the quiet of the place has been rudely
disturbed by the arrival of the Oxford
party. On the occasion of the fourth
excursion, when mine young Americans
took the places of the Dark Blue pil-
grims, Mr. STUART, with characteristic
national courtesy, waited at the landing-
stage until they had all arrived, before
leading the way into the venerable
edifice.
Another enthusiast over the old brasses
in Mortlake church is young Mr. KIRBY ;
so much so, indeed, that he has paid three
previous visits to them. For some rea-
son or other, however, he always gets
there a little late; consequently he has
not been able to devote so much study
to them as he could have wished. His
friends earnestly hope that next Satur-
day, at any rate, he will arrive in good
time.
[AUTHOR. I fancy I have put that
rather tactfully.
EDITOR. Oh, get on, and get it orer.
AUTHOR. You will like this meat bit.
This is really a spicy little bit of gossip.]
One of the show places of Mortlake is
the Brewery. Mention of this reminds
me that the time has come to reveal the
secret history of the dispute which re-
cently raged around Mr. STUART and his
fellow-student, Mr. ARBUTHNOT. The boat
in which the Cambridge party annually
proceeds to Mortlake is so narrow that
there is only room to sit one abreast;
generally, therefore, there is some dis-
cussion as to the order in which the
excursionists shall be seated. Now on the
occasion of the University wayzgoose the
Brewery, with ready hospitality, throws
its doors open to the inspection of the
tourists, with the necessary proviso that
only the first one to enter shall be
allowed to sample the different vintages.
It is obvious, therefore, that the man
seated in the “bows,” or thin end of the
boat, is the one who will arrive at Mort-
lake first, and, therefore, the one most
likely to obtain this privilege. Mr.
STUART loudly insisted that it was his
turn for this; while his friends con-
sidered that it was his duty to remain at
the thick end of the boat, where he could
see and, if necessary, encourage the
Oxford party. Mr. STUART felt that this
encouragement would come better from
a younger man, and recommended Mr.
ARBUTHNot for the position. Hence the
trouble. Mr. ARBUTHNOT may now have
to wait for another year before he can
visit Mortlake; and when he does so it
is to be hoped that he will remember to
look out for the tomb of Sir RICHARD
BURTON.
[AUTHOR. I say, shall I stop being so
technical 2
EDITOR. When did
you think of
stopping altogether 2 -
AUTHOR, I see what it is ; you 're
offended because I haven't brought in
what you told me about the oars.]
But Mortlake has other associations
than those I have already mentioned.
It was here that the two famous
astrologers, DEE and PARTRIDGE, resided ;
indeed QUEEN ELIZABETH herself is cur-
rently reported to have consulted the first-
named in this very village. DEE, who, in
the language of the period, was “harde-
bakyd enowe to knowe ye flatte ende of ye
oare from ye round.de one,” mistook the
identity of his client, and prophesied
for her a numerous family and some
success in life: which so much amused
the QUEEN that she presented him with
the Elizabethan Order.
E Before I close this article [Hooray!—
D.]
Before I close this article [Hooray!—
ED.]—
Before I—[Hoo—ED.]—
In conclusion I feel it my duty to say
that the second-class return fare to
Mortlake is one and threepence, and that
the Editor only gave me twelve old
stamped addressed envelopes, so that I
was actually threepence out of pocket, in
addition to the taste of the gum, and
when I honestly try to collect a little
information about the place I was sent
to—or, anyhow, arrived at, so as to write
an article upon a subject about which I
should otherwise have known nothing,
I am made the stock, that is the laugh-
ing-butt, I mean the- -
Well, anyhow, may the best boat win!

THE BANDBOX.
WHEN the Faringdens invited us to
their afternoon reception Mamma said
that Vera must have a new Paris hat
for the occasion, as she had matrimonial
hopes for her, and Guy Faringden, who
is very eligible and very impressionable,
doesn't care a straw for a girl unless she
is ultra smart. When the day and the
hat came, Mamma also decided I was
not to go at all, because, she said, it
would look too pointed to take one
daughter in a Paris model and the other
in a Bayswater one.
Vera's new hat had been bought at
Spotcash's, the new Anglo-American
Emporium, and came in one of their
lovely satin bandboxes.
The bandbox, indeed, was quite a
dream in itself, being covered with shell-
pink satin, with a ruche round the top, and
a satin bow and long ends. But some-
how, the hat it contained was not quite
so convincing as I expected, for though
built on correct lines and resembling in
shape a huge inverted pudding-basin,
it lacked to my eye the crude contour
and clumsy uncoutliness that mark the
dernier cri. Still, when Vera had got it

on, well crushed down over her face,
like an extinguisher, it looked quite
smart, and she was more high-spirited
than sympathetic when she called back
to me, as she drove away with Mamma
in a taxi-cab–
“Never mind, Valerie.
have the bandbox.”
Of course this was adding insult to
injury, and I went slowly back into the
bedroom and stood gazing sadly at the
bandbox through my brimming tears.
Then, as I gazed, all in a moment a
real genuine inspiration of genius flashed
through my brain. The bandbox!
Why, it was the very thing ! There
was the abnormal satin-covered crown,
the utter absence of brim, the close satin
ruche, the top-heavy. extinguisher-like
shape, all as required by the prevailing
mode. With trembling fingers I cut a
round hole in the lid and pushed it
some three inches down into the box,
then I turned the bandbox upside down
and put it on my head, which fitted into
the round hole. My pulses throbbed,
there was a mist before my eyes, and when
it had cleared I looked in the mirror.
The effect was marvellous; the bold
simplicity of design completely fulfilled
Fashion's latest fluctuation, and a quar-
ter-of-an-hour later I also was speeding
to the Faringdens' in a taxi-cab.
The absolute and overwhelming suc-
cess of my appearance may best be
indicated by the following paragraph
which appeared in all the society
journals a few days later: —
“A marriage has been arranged, and
will shortly take place, between Mr. Guy
Faringden, eldest son of Sir Godfrey
Faringden, Bart, of Faringden Towers,
N.B., and Miss Valerie Simpson, younger
daughter of Mrs. Frederick Simpson, of
Mountjoy Gardens, S.W.” (The italics

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
| SPEAIGHT UP TO DEAIGHT.
MR, SPEAIGHT, the famous improver of
the Marble Arch, which is now no
longer a foolish and antiquated gateway
to the Park, but a noble isolated obstacle
in the middle of Oxford Street, carrying
out superbly its new duties as a com-
plicator of the traffic—Mr. SPEAIGHT, to
whose fertile brain this improvement is
due, has been drawing up a further
series of projects for the beautification
of London, which, under his ingenious
and patriotic hand, is to become as
attractive as the White City.
“The fault of London,” as he is re-
ported to have said to an interviewer,
in whose statements, however, we
place no confidence, “is that it is
so English. The capital of a country
should never reflect its nationality; it
should borrow from other countries. My
conception of the perfect London is that
it should be packed with statuary, like
the gardens of the Tuileries and Luxem-
bourg.
“There cannot be too much statuary.
At present London's statues are scat-
tered—Cobden at Camden Town, Wel-
lington at Hyde Park Corner, Brunel
on the Embankment, William III. in
Kensington Gardens, and so forth. Let
us have them all together near Bucking-
ham Palace. The equestrian figures
might be set side by side, as if starting
for a race. Physical Energy from Ken-
sington Gardens beside George III. in his
scratch wig from Cockspur Street, and
Richard Coeur-de-Lion from the House
of Lords beside the Duke of Cambridge
from Whitehall. That would be novel
and pleasing; but bookmakers would,
of course, not be allowed.
“All the other statues should be
picturesquely assembled in avenues, so
that on one's way through the Mall one
could literally walk through the history
of England. How instructive, how
stimulating !
“To isolate the Arch at Hyde Park
Corner so that it comes into the middle
of the roadway is another of my schemes.
The picturesque and interesting conges-
tion of traffic at the foot of Hamilton
Place wants company. Things should
go in pairs. I therefore suggest the
creation of more intricacy close by.
This done, I would place the Achilles
statue on the top of the arch.
“Nelson's Column is not satisfactory.
I feel sure something could be done with
it. A hinge in the middle, so that
Nelson could be lowered for the inspec-
tion of the man in the street, who now
has no chance of closely studying his
great hero, might do it. Hydraulic power
would be the medium, I take it. A
simple matter.
“The lions, too. How wasteful to
concentrate all four lions in one spot,

Pen-and-Ink Notes.
Though the example of Lady CoN-
sTANCE LYTTON, who has been writing
with her blood, will not be followed
literally in fashionable circles, it has
given an impetus to the sale of blue
inks ; and a well-known ink-manufac-
turer is putting on the market in a few
days a new brand to be known as Blue-
Blood Ink.
There has been some discussion from
time to time as to whether the pen is
mightier than the sword. . We are in-
formed that the whole subject is to be
decided at next Monday's meeting of a
Herne Hill debating society. Admission
will be free.

THE NEWEST MAGAZINE.
(Being the kind of interview that hardly
any daily paper now spares us.)
It was in an office luxuriously fur-
nished and bearing every trace of
prosperity that our representative, call-
ing, we need hardly say, wholly on the
editorial initiative and without the
cognisance of the advertisement manager,
found Mr. Mornleigh Foam, the pro-
prietor and publisher of the new
magazine, called after himself, Foam's
Magazinc.
“I am glad you called,” said he, as |
he offered our representative a costly
Cabana and poured out two glasses of
the merriest Veuve procurable. “I
had, of course, no notion that you were
coming, but I am delighted to see you,
because I feel that such originality and
enterprise as I am showing should be
put on record in an influential paper.”
Our representative, who has been
quite decently brought up and knows
what's what, bowed.
“Yes,” continued the publisher, “I
gave this subject immense thought, and
at last came to the conclusion that it
was idle not to strike out a new and
courageous line. “I would,” I said to
myself, “hit the country—as BURRE, you
remember, hit the House of Commons—
between wind and water.’”
“And you——?”
“Yes, I did. I took one of the boldest
and most revolutionary steps that the
publisher of a new magazine could do.
I wrote to Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING for a
story !”
“Ah! ” Our representative buried
his face in his bubbling glass. “Yes,
Mr. Foam, and then 2 ” -
“And then I wrote to — You will
never guess' "
“You tantalise me, Mr. Foam.”-
“To Mr. ANTHONY HoPE 1 ''
“Did you really? It was Napoleonic.
And then 2''
“And then to Sir ARTHUR ConAN
Doyle. Sir ARTHUR, I may say, was
very kind. Indeed, I have had some of
the pleasantest experiences of my career
with the aristocracy.”
“And what have these authors written
for you, may I ask?”
“Ah, well, there you have me. I
must confess that I have not looked too
closely into that. But I know what I
have written for them.”
“May I inquire what, Mr. Foam 2"
The publisher leaned back with an
expression of affected caution and mys-
tery. “Cheques,” he said at last.
Our representative laughed heartily.
“Yes, indeed,” he said. “I expect so.
Yes, indeed. Cheques. Ha! ha' "
“Mr. Kipling's story,” continued Mr.
Foam, “cost me nearly half-a-crown a
word; but you may buy it, together
with many other stories much more
comprehensible, for sixpence. There's
enterprise and generosity. Indeed, I
venture to think that no better sixpenny-
worth was ever offered. The names
alone are worth the money.”
“Then you don't care for anonymous
or unknown writers ?”
Mr. Foam's expressive eyes conveyed
a strong negative.
“Yes,” he went on, “I’m an inno-
vator. Bold, very likely; reckless,
perchance foolish. But there it is A
man must be true to himself, and I was
always one for derring-do. My policy—
my secret—is names.” -
Our representative rose and picked
up that one of his two hats which seemed
nearest to him.
“Good-bye,” said the publisher.
“Look out for my first number. There's
a story in it by RIDER HAGGARD about
Africa and treasure-hunting which
should set the Thames on fire. There's
been nothing so original since King
Solomon's Mines. Mind the step.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DiAny of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 23.
—Storm-cloud hangs low over crowded
House. The air is thunderous. Pre-
sently we shall see it riven by forked
lightning. In such circumstances PRINCE
ARTHUIt is always supernaturally calm.
Has placed on paper a Vote of Censure
affirming criminal neglect by Govern-
ment of safety of the country. To-
day he is to ask for an opportunity of
moving it.
Through the long string of questions
Members impatiently await the mo-
ment of his interposition. When it
comes, he, in conversational tone, stu-
diously casual manner, invites the PRE-
MiER to name the day. Tension of the
House indicated by the cheer which
greets his rising. A still louder, one
rising from the serried hosts of Minis-
terialists encourages the PREMIER when
he responds to enquiry. Asquith not
exactly what you would call a man of
emotional nature. Does not wear his
heart on his sleeve for daws or other |
inconsiderable birds to peck at. By
rare exception is just now in state of
seething indignation. It finds voice

At this moment he is content acridly This unusual tone ruffles the cultured
to surmise that PRINCE ARTHUR, equally smoothness of PRINCE ARTHUR's manner.
He don't want to fight,
but by Jingo if he do!
Thursday is set apart for
second reading of Appro-
priation Bill, an oppor-
tunity sacred to Mem-
bers desiring to talk
on any subject under the
Sun.
“The righthon. gentle-
man,” he said, flinging a
scornful gesture towards
the Treasury Bench,
whilst he looked round
for the cheers of his sup-
porters, “is giving not
his own time, but our
time, to the Vote of Cen-
sure.”
In this objection PRE-
MIER, to increasing anger
of PRINCE ARTHUR, dis-
covered fresh reason to
believe that there was
no hurry in the matter.
“The only alternative
date is Thursday week
— April 1st,” he inno-
cently added.

versation across the Table. Its acerbity
subtly heightened by the courteous
phrases of personal reference imposed
by Parliamentary usage. In the white-
heat of temper conventionalities might
have failed but for interposition of RED-
Mond aimé. The Irish Members have,
it seems, marked Thursday as their own.

Censure implying situation of national

The Irish leader making this clear,
the interval afforded PRINCE ARTHUR
opportunity of resuming command over
himself. When he again interposed he
had recovered the manner almost of
indifference with which he opened the
conversation. Storm fizzled out with
commonplace suggestion that settlement
of precise day shall be deferred till
to-morrow.
Nevertheless excitement still sim-
mered. LoNDONDERRY, watching it from
the Peers' Gallery, was so perturbed that
when he rose to leave he put on his hat,
a serious breach of privilege. Walked
nearly the full length of the Gallery
before a breathless messenger, catching
up with him, reminded him of his peril.

“It would make an admirable fresco,”
I suggested, “like those in corridor be-

(though I fancy he was not displeased at
the idea), “ that is not a matter for me to

House of Commons, Thursday.—
Across the troubled scene of angry
controversy and threats of Vote of
Censure trips a figure which bestows
upon it a pastoral air. Dressed in rough
homespun, the skirt cut short enough to
display the thick-shod but not over-sized
shoes, with the glow of country air and
life on her innocent countenance, the
maiden paces the thoroughfares of
Clapham and the Boulevards of Brixton.

“I’m going to sell my mother's butter
and her fresh-laid eggs,” she answers.
“They are from our own farm, situated
in Battersea, left us by a fond father,
carried off suddenly owing to
a kick in the back by a cow
when he was filling a pail at
the pump.”
What can you do? Why,
you buy all the butter and the
eggs in the basket, with diffi-
culty carrying them home,
whilst the little one, grate-
fully smiling, runs off to the
farm for a fresh supply.

dashed the picture on the
canvas and Members are

to call “pats of Dosset” are
really margarine. The fresh
eggs come from the Continent
in a crate. The whole thing
is, in short, a fresh injustice
to Ireland, whose eggs and
butter are, so to speak,
whipped out of the market.

HOW TO DISARM OPPOSITION.
- [“Don't let yourself be disturbed by criti-

papers are often one-sided persons, dominated
by prejudice. If I were to leave Germany one
day and go to the other end of the world,
Germany would perhaps be surprised and ask
my pardon for much.”—Report of conrersation
of the German Emperor in Reuter's Telegram
from Berlin, March 22.]
SIMILAR reports about other Dis-
tinguished Persons, though not yet
to hand, are hourly anticipated as
follows:–-
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, addressing
an audience of Pacifists in the Lecture
Theatre at Garrod's Emporium on Satur-
day last, said that for fifteen years he

have a kindly feeling towards him—if
he remained there.
Mr. Victor GRAYSON, interviewed in
his favourite Restaurant, said that
in the long run the fatuous and malig-
nant criticism of which he was the
object would recoil on the heads
of his blatant and overfed calum-
niators. It was the privilege of martyrs
to be misunderstood. Even in the
Colne Valley detraction had reared its
poisonous crest. If he were to quit the
sordid political arena at Westminster
and emigrate to Tibet, England would
undoubtedly regard him with widely
different feelings.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, speaking at
a political meeting at the Paddington
Baths on Friday, observed that he said
ditto to the GERMAN EMPEROR on the
subject of criticism. Dramatic critics
were often purblind creatures, and had
no sense of perspective or eye for sar-
torial elegance. He had suffered much
at their hands, but he bore them no
malice. Sometimes, in moments of de-
pression, he had thought of starting
afresh in Alaska or Manchuria or the
tain critics had systematically and con-
Grand Sahara. In the last-named dis-
trict, however, he understood that the
natives did not wear or appreciate the
beauty of trousers. Still it would be a
noble task to extricate and elevate them
from this benighted condition. He felt
certain that if he were to leave England
one day and bury himself in the pur-
lieus of Timbuctoo, M. Pélissieſt would
be surprised and Mr. BEERDOHM TREE
might shed a tear. On the other hand
it was possible that he mightn't.
Speaking at an open-air meeting near
the Great Wheel at Laxey, in the Isle of
Man, Mr. HALL CAINE said he sympa-
thised deeply with the GERMAN EMPEROR,
whose sentiments expressed his own
feelings with extraordinary precision.
Genius inevitably exasperated the com-
mon herd, and was often driven into
exile in self-defence. As Gibbon said,
“Conversation may enrich the intel-
lect, but solitude is the true school for
genius,” and he had serious thoughts of
putting this dictum to a practical test
(Sensation.) For twenty years cer-
sistently belittled his achievements. He

had endured this ordeal with patience
and in contemptuous silence. But there
was a limit in all things, and he often
wondered what England would think if
he were permanently to take up his resi-
dence in the Antipodes. (Great emotion,
during which sereral prominent Mana:-
men were removed in a fainting condi-
tion.) At any rate, he felt sure that
Mr. HEINEMANN would be surprised and
Mr. A. B. WALKLEY would be smitten
with remorse. But after all, Australasia
deserved some return for her generous
offer of Dreadnoughts. (Continued emo-
tion, during which the Great Wheel was
profoundly moved.) -
KENTISH FIRE-LIGHTS.
(By Tiberius Mudd.)
The statement that the MS.
of the first volume of Mr. DE
MoRGAN's new novel runs to
180,000 words has excited some
singularly irrelevant comment in
certain quarters. Perfect conden-
sation no doubt is a good thing,
but it is not within the power of
everybody to compass it. For
however short we may be, there
will always be one Shorter.
A strange but unconfirmed ru-
mour is going the round of Fleet
Street that Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT is
engaged on a Biography of Dr.
Robertson NICOLL. On hearing
this a witty member of the Omar
Khayyám Club observed that he
supposed the illustrations would
be Nicoll-plated.
A correspondent writes to point
out the remarkable coincidence
that both parts of Mr. MoRLEY
Roberts's name are now borne by
peers. In this context I may point
out that Jimbo, Mr. ALGERNoN BLACK-
wood's new book, has not an elephant
for its hero.
Mr. WILLIAM HEINEMANN has just re-
turned from a journey in India. Mr.
John LoNG, on the other hand, always
travels in Wales.

well aware, is the Greek for “thunder.”

“THE Noble SPANIARD.” .
TAKE away from the women their Vic-
torian costumes (if I may say so without
offence) and withdraw from Mr. HAwtrey
the privilege of dropping his h’s,
and there would be little left in Mr.
MAUGHAM's pot-boiler at the Royalty
to explain his popularity as a play-
wright. Save for one novel fea-
ture, The Noble Spaniard belongs to
the hallowed category of Palais-Royal
farces, duly bowdlerised for British con-
sumption. The novelty is provided by
Mr. HAwTREY in the title rôle. For once
Lady Proudfoot (Miss Fanny Brough) cherishes the
illusory hope that the Duke of Hermanos (Mr. Hawtrey)
has designs on her virtue.
he plays something approaching to a
character part; he has almost to be
somebody else than himself; he has
even to borrow a voice. Towards this
loan I fancied at times that Mr. TREE
had contributed a trifle.
Grandees of Spain are so rarely
accessible to alien observation and so
seldom may be studied in the pursuit of
British widows at watering-places in the
Pas-de-Calais, that I must credit Mr.
HAwTREY with evolving his Duke of
Hermanos out of his own head. It was
a delightful creation, and he kept it up
with admirable consistency and restraint.
So long as he was on the stage all went
pretty well; but he couldn't be there
permanently. He had to be busy
elsewhere, hunting for imaginary hus-
bands or unlegalised rivals; purchasing
weapons for their destruction; collecting
post-horses for the purpose of an elope-
ment; waiting outside on the sea front
to catch the bouquet whose discharge
from the window was to be the signal for
flight. During these regrettable dis-
tractions we mainly elied for our fun
on Miss FANNY BROUGH; and, indeed, her
characteristic humour of voice and
face, the familiar eloquence of her hands,
the unfamiliar motions she imparted to
crinoline and flounce, were a pure joy,
For the rest, it was rather dull and
obvious work. The dialogue, especially
of the women, was often thin to the
point of emaciation, and when there
was good stuff in it, it was generally
confined to one side, while the other
had to be content with trivial interjec-
tions. That intelligent actress,
Miss KATE CUTLER, was not very
happily suited in the part of a
merry widow who appeared to
appreciate very heartily – even
perhaps above its actual merit—
the humour of the situations in
which she found herself, but was
allowed to contribute very little of
her own. Mr. LYALL Swete, who
was got up after the similitude of
THACKERAY, has also bad more
likely parts to play. For all his
profound knowledge of stage
technique, I seemed - to trace a
touch of the amateur in his acting.
Of the others, Mr. LEoN Lion
seized what little chance he had in
the last Act. --
Altogether, a rather negligible
play, and not very worthy of Mr.
MAUGHAM's reputation. But this
should not prevent its being a
popular success. - S.
The Daily Telegraph announces
that at the banquet of welcome to

but who will make it?
“The writer is not quite right in sympa-
thising with the small butcher, because he can,
and does, rule the roast whenever he chooses
to exercise his power.” -
In these words a correspondent in the
Glasgow Herald gets the butcher's cham-
pion neatly in the best end of the neck.

| ONCE BITTEN.
| An Ode to Nature in Spring, by a Former Victim.
NATURE, you deceitful charmer,
Bidding long-haired poets roam
(This annoys the local farmer)
O'er the incense-breathing loam ;
Let me tell you how your footling
Conduct has deterred from tootling
| One who sits in motley armour,
Writing doggerel at home.
! Long ago, when early spring-tide
| Came to glad the woods and hills,
Tighter was my tuneful string tied,
Throbbing with melodious thrills;
I would take excursion tickets
Just to watch your blooming thickets,
Hoping (if they weren't extinct) I'd
See some Naiads near the rills.
What occurred ? I wore a trim bow
(Meant to match the boughs) of green;
Lightly clad, with arms akimbo,
Felt a oneness with the scene;—
Then there came a sleety blizzard,
Froze the stanzas in my gizzard,
And I cast them to the limbo
Of the odes that might have been.
Even now, when dusk embraces,
Like a pall of fragrant soot,
Hollow glens and open spaces,
I should like to go and put
Mine amongst the lips that flatter
Faun and nymph and hooféd satyr,
Were it not that grassy places
Get so dampish underfoot.
Dryads might behold me gaping
Through the boughs—my bowler off;
Pan himself, a herdsman aping,
Whistle from some water-trough :
Who can say? But, if the night dew
Caught me coming home (and quite due),
Nothing could prevent my shaping
For a nasty spell of cough.
Therefore if my pipe be scrannel,
If my music fails to fill
Forest grove and river channel,
Nature, do not take it ill;
Think with how sublime (if vague) an
Ardour to be dubbed a pagan,
Long ago, in lightish flannel,
I sustained a heavy chill.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN presenting Glimpses of the Twenties (CoNSTABLE), Mr.
ToyNBEE does not attempt to elucidate them by comment.
That is wise, since the bare record of historic facts suffices
to enable the modern reader to realise something of the
actuality of these good old times. The period dealt with
follows the course of the reign of the last and worst of the
GEORGES. It is illumined with some great names, as CANNING,
WELLINGTON, BROUGHAM, ELDON, Robert PEEL, PALMERSTON and
Pitt. But for the most part—public and social life being
tainted at the fountain head—the dramatis personae are a
sorry lot. The man behind the throne—really a decent person
eponymous liberty she desires. Whether, after this, young
ladies should still be permitted to pursue the Bacchanal
course of Honour Moderations at Oxford, must be left to the
heads of their colleges to decide.
The Alternative . (HUTCHINSON) deals with a problem
nearly as old as the dilemma which troubled the prince
of doubters. To be wed or not to be wed, whether
'tis wiser in a girl to suffer the slings and arrows of
an outrageous mother's tongue, or, in the arms of a man
with a past whom she only tolerates, to set sail on the
perilous seas of matrimony—that, for poor Kate Heriot, was
the question. She ought to have been the happy wife of her
cousin and boy-lover, Kit Lyel. But he went away to seek
his fortune, and never told his love, except in a letter which
as times went—was the KING's
doctor, Sir WILLIAM KNIGHTON.
When GEORGE IV. was de-
tected in the habit of holding
secret intercourse with foreign
envoys, CANNING, at the time
Foreign Secretary, put his foot
down. The thwarted KING
sent his medical man to talk
him over, a fruitless endeavour
that occupied three hours.
One familiar with the habits
and position of statesmen of
to-day reads with amaze-
ment of the abject bearing
usually assumed by CANNING
towards such a man as GEORGE
IV. Even the Duke of WEL-
LINGTON bowed his stately
figure, which usually sug-
gested a ramrod in the neigh-
bourhood of the spine, in the
closet of a sovereign whose
familiar instruments were
the ex-accoucheur KNIGHTON,
MACMAHON, a former kitchen
boy, and one BLOOMFIELD, who
literally fiddled his way into
royal favour. The book casts
a lurid light on a period of
British history when the Em-
pire was in the making.

married the other man, and
lived unhappily ever after, the
victim of a long tragedy of
lies. To help her to be loyal
to her marriage-vow, Kit, on
his return, lied—magnificently
—about the purloined letter.
To free herself from her hus-
band, when his passing fancy
had turned to abiding hatred,
she falsely pleaded guilty to
infidelity with her cousin, who
had died in her arms. To
gain his private ends her hus-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FORTUNE AND FOLLY.
[The author of the following Great Thoughts on Gambling, written in
imitation of Lord Avebury's latest work, Peace and Happiness, admits
that he has done this kind of thing before; but then so has Lord
AvrBURY. The exigences of space demand that his name should be
written thus, tout court, without the modest list of fifty degrees and
distinctions which appear on the title-page of his book.]
THE love of money has been described by a Christian
writer as “the root of all evil,” and the Pagan poet, OvID,
gave it as his opinion that riches were “irritamenta
malorum” In more recent times the following apostrophe
was addressed to wealth:— -
“Money, thou bane of bliss, and source of woe; ”?
and another poet recognised a truth which is now almost
universally accepted when he said that
“Riches cannot rescue from the grave,
Which claims alike the monarch and the slave.””
On the other hand, many authorities have regarded wealth
as a blessing, even though in disguise. OLIVER GoLDSMITH
made the observation that
“Wealth imparts
Convenience, plenty, elegance and arts.”
And the author of Don Quizote * wrote:—
“El mejor cimiento en el mundo es el dinero.”"
“Money is the man,” was the saying of PINDAR (the original
being in Greek); and an English writer went so far as to
assert that “Money makes the mare to trot,”" thus contend-
ing that the benefits of wealth are not confined to the human
race.
Much depends upon how you come by your wealth.
HoRACE gave this advice: “Make money; honestly, if you
can ; but make it somehow.” This was, of course, satirical.
One of the best ways of making money is by the honest
sweat of the hand or brow. Thus obtained, it is less liable
to be thrown away carelessly. Many rich men who began
as labourers will agree with Romeo when he said that
“parting is such sweet sorrow.”
One of the worst ways of making money is by gambling.
The Dutch have a proverb, “Ligt gekomen, ligt gegaan,” “
of which the converse does not seem to be equally true.
There is a very beautiful spot, called Monte Carlo, situated
on the Mediterranean Sea, where
“Every prospect pleases
And only man is vile.” "
People have been known to visit this watering-place for
the purpose of gambling against the “bank.” “Bank” is
perhaps a misleading term. “I know a bank”" called
RobARTs, LUBBoCK & Co., and I am the head of it, but we are
in no way associated with the management of the “bank”
at Monte Carlo.
HoRACE speaks, in one of his Latin Odes, of country-folk
reclining on a “shady bank (umbrosa ripa).” I should hesitate
to apply this invidious epithet to the bank at Monte Carlo.
I am told that here, as in other haunts of vice, honesty is
found to be “the best policy.” "
At the same time, if there were no folly in the world to
take advantage of, the “occupation” of the bank, like
Othello's, would be “gone.”” “A fool and his money be
soon at debate.”” And GAY remarked :
“Could fools to keep their own contrive,
On what, on whom, could gamesters thrive 2"
Strangely enough, perfect propriety reigns in the gambling-
room of the Casino, as it is called. It is in a work entitled
1 Incentives to evil. * George Herbert. * Dryden. " Cervantes.
* The best foundation in the world is wealth. " Wolcott. * Shakspeare.
* Lightly come, lightly º: * Bishop Heber. "Shakspeare, Mid-
summer Night's Dream. "British proverb. *Shakspeare. * Thomas
Tusser.
Tom Jones, which I cannot recommend to the young of either
sex, that we read: “Nor will Virtue herself look beautiful
unless she be bedecked with the outward ornaments of
decency and decorum.” “... And this would appear to be
also true of certain forms of vice. - -
Chance is perhaps the chief element in gambling, and
many consider that the leading characteristic of chance is its
uncertainty. The author of Paradise Lost grasped this fact
when he spoke of chance as being “fickle.” ” Yet there
are some who rely upon its promises. The philosopher
EMPEDOCLES, only a few minutes before he lost everything,
except one slipper, in the crater of Etna, is said to have
observed : - -
“We lean upon the thought
That chance will bring us through.””
The futility of this belief has been well enunciated by Sir
HIRAM MAXIM, and I hardly doubt but what his views are
shared by his friend, Mr. VickeRs, though the latter has not
actually given them expression in print—not to my knowledge.
Admittedly there is no fixed principle about the movements
of chance. “Fortuna meliores sequitur”” was the theory of
SALLUST, and there is a common belief that “fortune favours
the brave.”” But there is also a proverb to the effect that
“Fortuna favet fatwis.”” Anyhow, one need never run
short of quotations to suit all cases. * -
SIR THOMAS OVERBURY, who flourished in the 16th century,
spoke of “the giddy wheel of fortune.” The phrase is
peculiarly adapted to the game known as roulette, where a
rotatory motion is given to the instrument of chance. No
one can with any exactitude foretell what number will fall.
Rory O'More recommended impair, meaning the odd
numbers. -
“There's luck in odd numbers, says Rory O'More.””
But according to the expert, Mr. Victor BETHEL, the even
numbers occur quite as often. -
Many prefer to put their money on zero, which is neither
odd nor even, but equivalent to maught (0). Here they have
the support of the brothers JAMES and HoRACE SMITH, who
Wrote :
“Thinking is but an idle waste of thought,
And naught is everything, and everything is naught.”
On the other hand the Latins had a proverb: “Ex nihilo
nihil fit.” -
There is one consoling thought to which ISAAR WALTON
gave utterance when he said: “No man can lose what he
never had.” This is nearly always true, and especially
applies to gambling where the bank refuses to accept your
I.O.U. or promissory note. Yet to lose all the cash that
you have about you is sometimes more than enough.
Over the door of Hell the Italian poet, DANTE, saw written
the words: “Lasciate ogmi speranza, voi ch' entrate.”* Over
the door of the Salle du Jeu" we might well affix the
striking phrase of MoWTAIGNE: “Le jeu me vault pas la
chandelle.”” O. S.
* Henry Fielding. * Milton. " Matthew Arnold. 7 Fortune backs

Military Tactics.
“The Lieut.-General Commanding the Division considers that the
destruction of the Borer beetle is so very important that he asks
everyone to assist in exterminating them. They can be easily found
on the trunks of trees at night time and can be killed by knocking
them on the head with a stick.”
Another way is to shave their heads and let them stay out
in the chill night air till they catch their deaths of cold.

TIPS FOR OUR TOTS:
OR, How To CURE HARMFUL HABITs.
THE imperfect physique of the present
generation has long excited the anxious
attention of educational experts. As
prevention is notoriously better than
cure, it is well that parents should
always be on the watch for those care-
lessly acquired habits which, if not
checked in childhood, are only too apt
to mar the mellowness of maturity.
A great writer in one of our most
strident contemporaries has recently laid
stress on the deadly results of over-indul-
gence in the hammock and the easy-
chair. NELSON, RodNEY, and BLAKE never
slept in hammocks except under com-
pulsion, and HANNIBAL, ALEXANDER THE
GREAT, and JULIUS CAESAR never included
armchairs in their camp equipage.
But there are other habits equally
deleterious in their effect on the stamina
of our tots, titled and otherwise. Long-
distance running, for example, in the
case of children under ten, is distinctly
to be deprecated. Lord DESBOROUGH
never ran a three-mile race before he
went up to Oxford, and to this fact
must be attributed his splendid mastery
of the question of bimetallism.

AN ENGLISHMAN'S NEW HOME,
“Moving into another house? Oh,
that's nothing,” they say. “And once
you're there !”
But let me tell you a little about it;
for we are not yet within hailing distance
of moving, and my life is already a
burden.
To begin with, there was the adver-
tisement. That was sent off light-
heartedly enough : Wanted a house
with such and such accommodation;
must be in Dorset or Devon. Note
the words I have thrown into italics.
A man has been found ass enough to
take it. He is coming in soon. His
London address is 48, Pickwick Gate.”
A nod being as good as a wink to a
provincial tradesman, they all hurry to
their desks and pen painful prose. This
prose began to find its way into my post-
box very soon after. Mr. Bunch the
butcher had heard a rumour (the
literary artist') that I had taken “The
Fig-trees,” and might he have the honour
of serving me? Nothing could equal
the excellence of his beef and the succu-
lence of his mutton. Mr. Wishleigh,
another butcher (butchers are much
of two butchers and several other trades-
men, simply by not going to them. No
light matter for sensitive folk.
And that is not all, for on the pre-
mises is a gardener with a large family
who counted upon being retained and
wore himself out in zeal when we went to
view the house; but unhappily he can-
not stay, because we have a gardener
already, and there is another broken
heart
Meanwhile the moving (which is
“nothing ”) and bills for new carpets
and such-like trifles are all before me !
It sounds simple and lucid : a
house with so many bedrooms and
other rooms, so much land, and must
be in Dorset or Devon—the italics
are again my very own.
Then the replies began ; agent
after agent—or rather firms of
agents, for no agent seems to have
enough in him to stand alone—| :
wrote sending desirable residences,
unique residences, and old-world
residences, and gentlemen's resi-

set, but all over the face of this
England, this precious stone set in
a silver sea. They came by every
post, some accompanied by precious
photographs, which we were im-
plored to return at once. By every
post they came. Had there been a
Sunday post they would have come
by that. One came even from
Hampstead—an eligible home in
| the Vale of Health !
Having found the house (in Dor-
set)—and, strange to relate, one was
found very quickly—I stopped the
advertisement and wrote politely to
the principal agents, telling them
that all need for excitement was
over : I was suited. But do you
think that deterred them 2 Not a
bit. They still went on sending
more and more particulars, more
and more residences unique, and

THE end of the Influenza Season
being now at hand we are enabled
to publish for the first time a re-
markable sermon preached by our
vicar during the early portion of
Lent. That we have not done so
before is due to the fact that the
state of high tension in the parish
in question, occasioned by the
weather, has only recently, since
the rise in temperature, given place
to the usual harmonious relations
between vicar and flock.
The vicar, after alluding feelingly
to the trying weather we had re-
cently experienced, remarked that it
was at such times as these that we
learnt to bear with greater kindness
and tolerance those infirmities and
shortcomings in others which (cough)
—which often caused us discomfort
and annoyance and which (cough)—
which called for a gentle forbearance
on our part (general coughing). He
would say that perhaps (burst of
coughing)—he would , say again
(lengthy coughing recitative from
back of church)—he would say again
—for the third time (strong bron-
‘chial disturbance from old gentleman
in front pew) that at times like
these it behoved those who pro-

and then I wrote again and said I
really meant it, and gradually the stream
dwindled, although there are still little
flickers of activity in it, and sometimes
two residences will come in in a day,
and sometimes only one.
So far so good. The house was
mine.
But then the successful agent—the
winner of this Marathon—began to get
to work. I had never thought of it
before, but of course no one can live on
house-agency, and he must therefore
look around for auxiliary aids. What
he does, I gather, is this : he goes to his

and might he have the privilege of
purveying whatever meat it pleased me
and mine to devour? Mr. Starcher,
however, the third butcher in the town,
either doubting his penmanship or be-
lieving solely in the personal appeal,
took train to London and actually called
at Pickwick Gate twice in one day.
Meanwhile were the grocers and
greengrocers and bakers of this little
Dorset town idle? They were not.
They also were laying burdens on our
postman's back, and still are. Their
letters arrive daily. The result is that
when we do move and are settled and
visit the little Dorset town we shall be
conscious of having broken the hearts
fess Christian principles to carry
them into daily practice (cough, cough,

bear consistently (coughing duet ending
in general chorus)—he would repeat, to

vent the cuckoo being heard, except by
the very deaf. “That's the wise cuckoo,”
as the poet said; “he sings his song
a hundred times over, until you think
he never can recover his self-respect
again " " — a fine trope. SHAKSPEARE
called the cuckoo the “bird of fear,”
but PoE preferred the raven to that
post: “Bird, if bird thou art, or demon.”
The bird of freedom is, of course, the
sawin, as every reader of Biglow knows;
but we have no sawins in England.
Like the bobolink, they are American.
In April there is a distinct tendency
on the part of human beings to change
their plumage, and the streets of this
dear grey city—“the city of dreadful
night,” as poor THOMSON called it—be-
come more gay. The straw hat tarries
till June, and the white waistcoat is not
yet conspicuous; but the genus man will
no doubt go through his wardrobe with
some care in a day or two, lured thither
by the genial sun (“the orb of day”) to
see if last year's tweeds are fit for wear
this year, or if he must visit the tailor.
Spring of course is not in town what
it is in the country. There are, for
example, no clods in London, and clods,
I can tell you, are devilish useful things
when you have to make a quarter of a
column of small print about this hack-
neyed season every day. It adds I do
not know what interest to the life of the
farm to pull up a clover root and mark
in nodules on the roots the massed colo-
nies of such organisms, robbing the air
of its gases and giving them to the
roots to feed on. But this, of course,
you can't do in London. There is, how-
ever, no reason why you should not, like
M. Zol.A when in exile here, hunt for
hairpins (which I might by a poetical
figure call the plovers' eggs of the city;
at any rate they are to be found only on
the ground). These fall in great pro-
fusion at all times of the year, but
never with more abandon than in the
merry merry spring-time.

TO AN OLD BAT.
When Vesper trails her gown of grey
Across the lawns at six or seven,
The diligent observer may
(Or may not) see, athwart the Heaven,
A small marsupial on the wing. Well, that
Is (probably) a Bat . . . .
In any case I shall not sing of that.
O Willow, in our hours of ease
(That is to say, throughout the Winter),
I take you sometimes on my knees,
And, careless of the frequent splinter,
Caress you tenderly, and sigh, and say,
“Ye gods, how long till May ?”
So, Willow, now that April's here
I do not sob for Spring to show its
Pale daffodils and all the dear
Old flowers that keep the minor poets;
I hail it just because a month (about)
Will find You fairly out.
Revered, beloved, O you whose job
Is but to serve throughout the season—
To make, if so it be, the Blob,
And not (thank Heaven') to ask the reason—
To stand, like Mrs. HEMANs' little friend, -
Undoubting to the end :
Old Willow, what a tale to tell—
Our steady rise, from small beginnings,
Ab ovo wsque—wsque—well,
To 84, our highest innings; -
(Ah me, that crowded hour of glorious lives—
i Ten of them, all from drives')
| Once only have you let me in,
Through all the tonks we’ve had together;
That time when, wanting four to win,
I fairly tried to loot the leather—
And lo! a full-faced welt, without the least
Warning, went S.S.E.
A painful scene. In point of fact
I’m doubtful if I ought to hymn it;
Enough to say you went and cracked,
And left me saying things like “Dimmit”
(And not like “Dimmit”), as I heard Slip call
“Mine !” and he pouched the ball.
Do you remember, too, the game
Last August somewhere down in Dorset,
When, being told to force the same,
We straightway started in to force it . . . .
Tor half-an-hour or so we saw it through,
And scratched a priceless 2;
Or how the prayer to play for keeps
And hang the runs, we didn't need 'em,
So stirred us we collected heaps
With rather more than usual freedom:
Fifty in fourteen minutes---till a catch
Abruptly closed the match?

What memories ' Yet 1909
May find us going even stronger;
So, pouring out the oil and wine,
Let's sit, and drink, a little longer;
Here's to a decent average of 10 !
(Yours is the oil. Say when . . .)
When Morning on the heels of Night
Picks up her shroud at fice and after,
The diffident observer might
(Or might mot) see, beneath a rafter,
A small marsupial upside down. Well, that

In any case I have not sung of that. A. A. M.
CROSS-EXAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's Road To KNOWLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; Papa, aged 48.)
Little Arthur. Papa, did you make a speech at the meeting
last night? -
Papa. Yes, my boy, I proposed a vote of confidence in
Lord Taplow, our new Candidate.
L. A. Do you know Lord Taplow well, Papa?
Papa. No, never saw him before. Fine upstanding young
fellow, but nothing of a speaker. No choice of language.
However, he’ll learn as he goes along.
L. A. I wish I could have heard you speak, Papa.
Papa. So you shall some day, when you’re a bit older.
However, there's quite a decent report of the meeting in the
Sentinel. You can read my speech in that. There, that 's
the place where I begin, where my thumb is. (IHands a
paper to Little ...;
L. A. Thank you, Papa. (He reads.)
Papa. How do you like it?
L. A. Oh, Papa, I think it splendid. Did you really say
all that? - * -
Papa. Yes, and a good deal more too. It's not a verbatim
report. - -
L. A. No, Papa. May I read out some bits, Papa?
Papa (flattered). Certainly, my boy, certainly ; read away.
L. A. Here's a bit, Papa (reads aloud):—“In Lord Taplow
they had a man whose brilliant career was well known to
them. Indeed they might say that they were all on terms
of warm personal friendship with Lord Taplow. (Cheers.) He
himself (the speaker) had known Lord Taplow from his boy-
hood up, and he was proud ” But, Papa!
Papa. Yes, my boy, what is it?
L. A. I thought you told me you never saw Lord Taplow
before last night?
Papa. Did I say that?
L. A. Yes, Papa, you did. But in your speech you say
you have known him from his boyhood up.
Papa. Oh, of course that's a–how shall I describe it?—
a façon de parler.
L. A. What does that mean, Papa? Something that's
not quite true?
Papa. Of course not; of course not. It's a way of putting
things. It's expected at public meetings. They all knew
what I meant—and, besides, I have known quite a lot about
Lord Taplow. Don't you remember your mother reading
out the account of his wedding a month or two ago?
L. A. Yes, Papa, I remember. Then I suppose if I ever
speak at a public meeting I can say that I’ve known him
from his marriage up. (He reads again.) “If there could
ever have been any possible doubt as to Lord Taplow's
fitness to represent them in the Council-chamber of the
nation, his lordship's brilliant and eloquent speech of this
evening would have utterly dispelled it. Never in his (the
speaker's) long experience had he heard political issues dealt
with in so admirable a fashion. Nay, he would go further.
He could say without fear of contradiction that Lord Taplow's
speech was the most statesmanlike anybody in that room had
ever listened to. (Loud applause, Lord Taplow smiling and
shaking his head.)” I say, Papa, isn't that—

“Of all the despicable Governments that had disgraced this
country the present Government were the most despicable.

country.” That sounds splendid, Papa; but if Mr. Cutts is
a traitor, oughtn't he to have his head chopped off?

The Journalistic Touch.
“The Liverpool Echo' has now a position which is quite unique,
having a larger number of advertisements than any other evening paper
in Great Britain.”—Liverpool Echo.
But you can fill “a position which is quite unique” much
more easily by having a smaller number of advertisements
than any other evening paper in Great Britain.
A New Thing in Loopholes.
“The Government's view, I understand, is that there is still a loophole
for negotiations with Germany in regard to a modification of the
respective naval programmes of the two countries, and that to
announce definitely that they were going to lay down the eight Dread-
noughts within the coming twelve months would be to close that
loophole with a bang.”—Irish Times.
“From the middle of November to February 3 the party had only
two meals, including that on Christmas Day.”--Glasgow Herald.
And then, according to another paper, they “found a crèche.”
We cannot bear to dwell on the picture.
Under the heading “The Weary Titian's Sons,” The
Toronto Globe prints a stirring article on the duties of
Empire. From the reference to TITIAN it seems that Canada
at any rate does not intend to cut the painter.
“In the semi-final round for the “Arthur Dunn' Memorial Cup, Old

AND-I-- Don't –Apologise!”
CELEBRITIES OF THE RAILWAY
WORLD.
I.
BEN KIRBY lives in a little house with
one window and sells cardboard. He
deals in three colours, never varies the
size of the piece, and has 4,532 varia-
tions of price. A personal friend of his,
also in the business, has composed a
little poem on a collateral subject, in-
different perhaps in point of rhyme, but
striking in metre :—
Save Money,
Avoid Delay,
Buy
Strip Tickets.
Unfortunately the composer of those
lines practises on a tube railway, and
those tube fellows will, as Ben Kirby
rightly remarks, say anything.
“Good morning, Ben,” said I. “Have
you any cardboard ”’’
“Where do you want to go to ?” he
asked irrelevantly.
“I don't want to seem rude,” I
answered, “but surely that is my busi-
ness. What have you got?”
“Red, white and green,” he answered
more sensibly.
“I will have eighteen-pennyworth of
the green,” I said.
II.
Harold Perks makes his living by
opening and shutting gates. He too is
not uninterested in cardboard.
“Good morning, Harold,” I said.
“May I have a look at it 2 " he asked.
“Certainly,” I replied. “The date is
5 Ap 09, and none of the companies on
whose steamboats, trains, coaches, car-
riages, wheelbarrows or carts I travel
cares what becomes of me en route. So
says my little piece of cardboard, issued
subject to all those conditions, regu-
lations and bye-laws of which you wot.
It is one-and-sixpence parly. I don't
know what “parly' may mean, but
have a bit.” -
Harold produced his cigar-cutter and
helped himself to the bit with the one-
and-sixpence on it.
III.
Percy Tibbits does not live anywhere.
He merely travels, and that not com-
mercially but for the fun of the thing.
He called on me at Blimy Junction,
ostensibly out of politeness, but really to
satisfy his lust for cardboard.
“Good morning, Percy,” I said. “Have
some ticket 2 Harold has snipped the
best bit, but help yourself.”
“Green, my dear fellow 2" he cried.
“But you are sitting in an armchair.”
“Yes, a first-class armchair.”
“That is the sad part. You ought to
º a white piece of cardboard,” he
Sal Ol.
“Snob,” I replied. -
I gave him one-and-fourpence. -
He gave me a piece of paper with his
autograph on it.
- IV.
Teddy Shaw has a little place all to him-
self in the country, which (being, I sup-
pose, a Colonial) he calls Five Ashes
Station. He blows whistles, lights
lamps, and waves his arms about. His
favourite occupation is boxing. Some-
times he portmanteaus, is not above a
milk-can now and then, but in no cir-
cumstances will be have anything to do
with packages containing gunpowder,
nitro-glycerine, or any explosive of what
kind, nature or sort soever. Incident-
|ally he collects cardboard, paper, money
and anything he can get hold of.
“Thank you,” he said, meaning that
he wanted the rest of my bit of card-
board.
“Thank you,” I answered, meaning
that he was welcome to it and to my bit
of paper as well.
“Thank you,” he added, meaning, I
take it, nothing in particular.
W.
Herbert Watson lives in a box and
pulls signals. He does not sell, inspect
or collect cardboard. As a result of
the foregoing, I have never met him,
and I don't much mind if I never do.

H.M.S. INoFFENSIVE (sister ships—H.M.S. INNocuous, ABJECT, AND UNobtrusive—Not to be built).
A Design for a Dreadnought to be presented to the nation by the Labour Party and a few other equally ardent patriots.
House of Commons, Monday, March 29.
–Save for bare rows of benches in
Strangers' Galleries, every seat occupied
when that Marine of politics, ARTHUR
LEE, formerly of the Army, of late the
Navy, his motto Per mare per terras,
rose to move Vote of Censure upon
Government inasmuch as their provision
of battleships of the newest type does
not sufficiently secure safety of the
Empire. Peers flocked down early to
secure places. From Diplomatic Gal-
lery the world looked on in persons
of Foreign Ministers. One notable
absentee. America was there; Austria-
Hungary, Japan, Portugal, Greece, Nor-
way, and eke Sweden were represented.
Germany modestly held aloof.
Except when GREY was speaking, and
later when PREMIER and PRINCE ARTHUR
had wrestling bout, proceedings were,
considering their importance, curiously
dull. Fact is, they partook of character
of anti-climax. The real sensation was
created a fortnight ago when Navy Esti-
mates were introduced, when PRINCE
ARTHUR made grave protest against in-
sufficiency of shipbuilding programme,
when PREMIER, in speech obviously
directed to recalcitrant friends below
Gangway, admitted and enforced gravity
of situation. House of Commons can
never be twice wound up to pitch of
excitement when same key is used.
What it wanted to hear to-night was
what might be said by FoREIGN SECRE-
TARY, PREMIER, and PRINCE ARTHUR, above
all the Foreign SECRETARY. For the rest,
hon. Members, voicing personally their
views and opinions, might as well have
stayed at home delighting and instruct-
ing the family circle.
At one moment desolate appearance
of benches suggested a count. This
was tried ; but it would never do for
momentous debate involving life of
Ministry and safety of Empire to con-
clude in that ignominious fashion.
Accordingly Members at dinner or
wiling away the time elsewhere rushed
in and saved the situation.
This happened after Edward GREY
had delivered a fine speech, stately in
diction, statesmanlike in substance. As
twice a day the Severn fills, so, just
before ten o'clock, when news went
round that ASQUITH was up, the stream
poured in again. Once more was pre-
sented the impressive scene of benches
thronged with men intently listening.
PREMIER, above all things a practical
business man, recognised absence of
necessity for making long, elaborate
speech. Had his turn a fortnight ago.
Dexterously took second innings last
Monday when, unexpectedly nipping in
on Naval Estimates, he re-stated case of
the Government with surpassing clarity
and force. Now, with reiterated com"
plimentary reference to EDWARD GREY”
speech, he, like a statesman of earlie"
birth, was content to “say ditto to Mr.
BURKE.”
Only once roused himself above level
of conversational tone. This in con-
cluding passage, when he warmly pro-
tested against the obvious implication
underlying Vote of Censure, that,
though Ministers had given definite
pledges of intention with respect to naval
programme, the Opposition “distrust
either our intelligence or our good faith.”
PRINCE ARTHUR, as usual when dealing
with a case bristling with facts and
figures, was at his worst. Said nothing
more about the four phantom ships
discovered in his speech a fortnight
ago, which brought up Germany's force
of battleships in 1912 to 21. Have
doubtless foundered on Dogger Bank,
that mystic mirage-haunted speck of
Northern Sea. Made his way painfully
through intricacies of figures, growing
increasingly irritable when corrected.
On stroke of eleven he sat down.
House cleared for a division. Members,
having saved (or failed to save) the State,
hurriedly passed through Division Lobby
into Palace Yard, hoping to be in first
flight for cabs. Comparatively few
stayed to hear particulars of foregone
conclusion in Division Lobbies.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Soldier ANd sailor Too.”—Kipling.
(Mr. Arthur Lee.)
Business done—Vote of Censure
negatived by 353 votes against 135.
Tuesday.—Another Irish Land Bill.
What is its number in the ascending
scale? No one quite certain. Seems
that since, forty years ago, the game
started we have had one, if not every year,
certainly with each successive Ministry.
The latest is designed to amend Act
passed by last Government when GEORGE
WYNDHAM was Secretary. Time was
when introduction and progress of an
Irish Land Bill used to fill House with
stormy crowd. To-day ChieF SECRETARY
talks to benches along which are many
gaps.
Otherwise matters much as usual.
The more Irish Land Bills change, the
more they are the same thing. Faithful
Ministerialists support Government of
the day, whatever its denomination be.
Gentlemen from Ulster cry aloud against
fresh spoliation. Nationalists give
grudging consent to Second Reading,
with avowed determination of seeing
how much more money they will be
able to wring out of the Exchequer in
Committee. And after all Ireland re-
mains the same dear distressful country
it ever was.
Business done.—Second Reading of
latest Irish Land Bill moved.
Wednesday.—Ordered business of day
just got into stride when there were
strange doings at the door. Messenger
hurriedly entered; whispered something
in ear of SERGEANT-AT-ARMs seated on
Cross Bench. With air of quiet determi-
nation flushing a countenance habitually
resolute, the one man armed in House
of Commons quitted his seat and strode
to the door opening on to the Lobby.
Peering forth, he, unlike Sister Anne,
at once saw somebody coming ; with
great presence of mind closed and locked
the heavy portal. Then was heard a
timid knocking. Peeping through a
latticed opening in the door the SER-
GEANT-AT-ARMs seemed satisfied with his
survey. He unlocked and opened the
door.
2ntered a figure strangely garbed.
The door-keeper, advancing to the Bar,
broke in upon the speech of the Minister
on his legs with the cry, “Black Rod ' "
St. AugustiNE (it happened to be he),
stopping midway in a sentence, suddenly
dropped into his seat as if he were
an Irish Landlord in proximity of a
hedge with the gleam of a gun-barrel
behind it. The figure in black coat,
breeches and stockings, carrying an
ebony stick tipped with golden crown,
made solemn advance up the floor, halt-
ing midway to make obeisance to the
Chair. With these preliminaries he
delivered his message, bidding the
Commons repair to the House of Lords
to hear the assent to certain Bills given
by Royal Commission.
The SPEAKER stepped down in wig
and gown, and, escorted by the now
unruffled SERGEANT-AT-ARMs with Mace
on his shoulder, obeyed the summons.
When he returned, passing to the Chair
through upstanding ranks of Members,
“STATELY IN Diction, STATES MANLIKE IN
substance.”

Monday,
“I want Eight,
AND I won't wait."
It is rumoured that some people just a leettle
bit lost their heads at Croydon.
(Sir R. Hermon-Hodge.)
he communicated to the House the
nature of the business transacted in his
absence.
This was St. AUGUSTINE’s cue. Re-
turning to the Table, he picked up
the sentence broken by entry of Black
Rod, completed it, and went on as if
there had not happened what is equivalent
to the seventeenth century momentarily
popping in on the twentieth and dis-
locating its prosaic business.
Business dome.—Irish Land Bill read
second time.
Thursday.-General NAPOLEON B. HAL-
DANE unusually reserved of late. Answers
MANGNALL's QUESTIONs with refreshing
taciturnity; has volunteered no further
explanation of recent growth of Terri-
torial army. Fact is even his indomi-
tably massive mind, Atlas that lightly
bears aloft what to others would be
crushing weight of thought, is tem-
porarily depressed by problem submitted
by that veteran GEORGE Gibbs, Major of
North Somerset Imperial Yeomanry.
Suddenly, a propos de bottes, G. G.
posed SECRETARY OF STATE with enquiry
“whether he will consider the advisa-
bility of substituting a flannel shirt for
the shaving appliances carried in the
knapsack." -
At first sight suggestion seems absurd.

The IDEA seems to Mr. PUNch to be CAPABLE of considerABLE developMENT, which should be of GREAT INTEREST to sportsMEN.
. HEREIN. Also MAY BE THE solution of the problem of the SCARCITY of horses. WAR OFFICE, PLEASE Note.
No man could shave himself with a
flannel shirt. Then why suggest the
substitution ? N. B. HALDANE happily a
statesman of broad ideas. Not disposed
lightly to set aside a suggestion con-
cerning comfort of battalions on the
march because it looks impracticable.
Is thinking the matter over. Regrets
that when, the other day, he placed in
the tea-room two foot-soldiers diversely
dressed so that Members might satisfy
themselves of the desirability of pro-
posed sartorial alteration, he did not,
so to speak, kill two birds with one
stone. At stated intervals the men
might, under direction of Major GIBBs,
have experimented in direction of de-
monstrating to what extent (if any) a
flannel shirt may be substituted for a
raZOr.
Too late now. The matter will come
up again after Easter.
Business done.—Indian Councils Bill
read a second time.
From the notices of the Minister of a
Congregational Church near Man-
chester:— -
“March 21st. Subject: ‘Looking forward.'
March 28th. Subject: ‘Never again.”
A saddening example of the triumph of
experience over hope.
A CHESS-MATCH.
She had moved into Laurestine Villa,
I was informed, on New Year's Day. Not
knowing what the lady was like, I moved
into the attached villa at Lady-day.
On that same day she followed with a
move down the garden path into the
road, a music-case in her hand and a
Merry Widow hat upon her head.
I moved a kitchen chair and the
dining-room clock to let her pass.
The game was renewed the next day.
I was sitting on the bare floor of the
drawing-room, when I heard the third
movement of a Beethoven sonata very.
plainly from her side of the wall. I
knew then that it was my turn once
more; and as she appeared to be a very
strong player, reckless in attack, I felt
that my only chance of winning lay in a
bold effort. I therefore promptly moved
in a packing-case and proceeded to
hammer it open. -
The game continued briskly, and
eventually I consulted my landlord.
“No, I can't thicken the wall,” he
said. “An Englishman's semi-detached
house is his semi-detached castle, you
know, Mr. Smith. I'm afraid we can't
interfere,” he added brightly.
. I could not take her castle, and I
didn't see my way to move my rook.
A few days later she brought in her
young man to sing “I fear no Foe" and
“Because.” This was a master-stroke
with her knight that I had not reckoned
upon; I replied with my other neigh-
bour's dog, borrowed for the occasion.
However, I could not so much as check"
her; and obviously my prospects of
mating her were very poor. Yet I knew
of a little house on the other side of
London that would have suited them
splendidly.
These prolonged games are exhaust-
ing, and I resolved last week to make,
a final attempt to compel her to retire.
She had been playing very strongly,
and I was sick of it. So I went up
to Brinsbroad's and asked to see their
stoutest pianos. -
“Overstrung 2" asked the manager.
“Yes,” I replied; “but how did you,

“BEVIS.”
Bevis is, after all, not a new Ox
Extract, but a young Marquis who is
going to marry Beer. His personal
motives are not purely mercenary; he
really likes the girl; but his field of
selection, which otherwise would have
had no bounds, has been conditioned by
the pecuniary needs of his house. His
mother, on the other hand, is cynically
frank on the subject of marriage settle-
ments; and there is also a stray uncle
who sees his way to some pickings;
and a middlewoman who has brought
the young couple together and wants
what she calls “recognition.” The girl
gets wind of these schemes and shows
spirit enough to break off the engage-
ment. This rouses the boy from his
complacent lethargy, and puts him on
what he thinks is his mettle. He will

ley (Mr. A. E. Matthews), whom she imagines

start courting the girl over again, but
this time on her merits. He induces
the middlewoman to get up a week-end
party and throw the girl and her father
in contact with his own strained rela-
tions. Follows a scene of mutual em-
barrassment, quite awful in its tension;
but the girl is eventually persuaded to
give in by her father, who has no idea
of losing a good thing, and only bucks
at being asked to pension the uncle, who,
unlike the middlewoman, has done no
“work” for him. It is now the boy's turn
to decline an arrangement that offends his
amour propre. Nothing heroic, however,
ensues. He does not migrate to another
continent (though the names of several
occur to him), where he might prove
himself to be a man as well as a marquis.
A conventional episode, on the border-
land between farceand melodrama, brings
the two together, and all ends happily
and tamely on an undertone of sentiment.
A quiet vein of very fresh and attrac-
tive wit runs through the passages which
illustrate the main theme; while a sub-
ordinate affair of hearts between the uncle
and the middlewoman, pushed perhaps
a little too much into the foreground,
supplies the kind of humour which is
known as “rich.”
Mr. MATTHEws, as the pleasant half-
fledged youth, was of course admirably
in his element, and at times he pulled
himself together and assumed an air of
martial resolution; but he failed to put
much heart into his serious wooing.
Miss MADGE Tither ADGE, in the trying
part of the heiress, showed a nice
maidenly dignity, but lacked the
wings of impulse. Miss Lottie WENNE,
as Mrs. Pym, matchmaker, was superb.
It was nothing to her that this was
supposed to be a comedy; she was out
for farce, and meant to enjoy herself.
On the other hand, Miss WATSON, who
played the mother of the Marquis, kept
well in the picture; and my only com-
plaint is that she was a little apodeictic
(if Mr. WALRLEY will permit me) with
her hands. Finally Mr. LowNE, as the
uncle, and Mr. FRANCE, as the brewing
magnate, did excellently what was asked
of them. Indeed the whole cast was
beyond praise, and so was the manage-
ment, except perhaps in the second
scene. Here the embarrassment on the
stage almost communicated itself to the
house, so stickily was it presented.
My, best compliments to Mr. HUBERT
DAVIES, and I hope he may never-again
have in the audience the large man who
sat two rows behind me on the first
night and barked with so hoisterous an
hilarity that nobody else in the neigh-
bourhood could hear himself laugh.

provided by the Government from its exchequer;
that exchequer must be replenished by taxes.
The Poet feels confident that, at this moment

atrocious attitude to which he hereby confesses.]
I MUST admit that I am not
By any means a patriot.
I sometimes used to think I was,
But now I know I’m not because
Though I'm prepared to shout and rave,
“Let Britons really rule the wavel"
Though I have sat and scratched my
head
And written to The Times and said:—
“What is the use of all this fussin'?
When they build one, let's build a
dozen"

Why stint the fleet to save the cash?”

A GOLF DEGREE.
A UNIVERSITY of Bull-fighting (says
The Express of March 30) has been
established at Bilbao, and will open its
doors on July 1. The new University
will grant two degrees—licentiate and
doctor of tauromachy, and lectures will
be given on the history of bull-fighting,
the classic and romantic schools, the
anatomy of the bull and of the horse, the
study of arms and the biographies of
great toreros.
We understand that the University of
St. Andrews will shortly follow suit,
and devote itself entirely to the aesthetic
and practical aspects of golphomachy.
The Professors are to be elevated to
Professionals, taking seniority according
to their handicap. The course for
students at this Royal and Ancient
Academy of Learning will be a daily
round of eighteen holes, with the usual
penalties for the Swilcan Burn, the Eden,
and the Station-master's Garden. Medals
will be granted for proficiency, and the
“honours” awarded from time to time
to the side that gains a hole. The
examinee with fewest marks shall head
the list, and those who are duly qualified
in the championship will be awarded the
degree of B.A., that is to say, Bunkers
Avoided; while candidates who fail will
be “gulphed.”
By this patriotic action of the Scottish
Alma Mater it is confidently expected
that the Art and Science of Golf will take
its proper place among the humanities.
The Truth about the Sexes.
In its half-column of “Notable Say-
ings of To day,” The Westminster Gazette
quotes Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN as re-
marking, “Men are men, and women
are women.” Which, as the song says,
nobody can deny. The marvel is that
the circumstance (apparently) was never
before noticed, and might now have
been overlooked had not the eagle
glance of The Westminster, in search of
striking sayings, fallen upon this ex-
posure of it.

[“The latest mode demands that the waist
must measure its natural circumference, and
must be twenty-four inches, at least.”—Fashion
Column, Daily Paper.]
At Fashion's edict, stern and brief—
“The waist must be compressed no
more ”—
A suspiration of relief
Goes up from shore to shore.
Behold the triumph of the plump !
Her ample symmetry she hastes
To blazon boldly, while a slump
Occurs in willow waists.
For “twenty-four" is chie, no less;
And maids too slender by an inch
To save themselves from dowdiness
Will have to pad, not pinch.
While multitudes of cords and bands
And tapes, uncomfortably tense,
Spring looser now the mode demands
A wide circumference.
Man gives the fashion his support
With approbation deep and strong,
For tempers will not be so short
Nor doctors' bills so long.
In fact, the female form divine
Once more will transiently reign,
Now Paris follows nature's line
And ladies breathe again.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks...}
I HAVE long had a suspicion that SELWYN was one of the
frauds of the eighteenth century. After reading Mr. PARNELL
KERR's George Selwyn and the Wits (METHUEN) the impression
is confirmed. HoRACE WALPOLE did much to create a phan-
tom reputation for him. His Letters are full of references to his
friend and citation of his good things, which, such as they are,
probably owe much to the polish of the recorder. ThacKERAY,
steeped in the lore and gossip of the time, drags SELWYN into
the company of Henry Esmond Warrington, who meets him
at White's Club. Mr. KERR destroys his hero's last hope of
justification as a wit by compiling a chapter presumably
recording his choicest productions. Here is a sample, not
Colonel Marwood's trouble was that there was another man
in England who looked exactly like him. If this happened
to you or me we should be inclined to say that it was the
other man's trouble, and if ever we met him to offer our
sympathies. But the Colonel was a Tory Member of Parlia-
ment, and so it really was annoying for him when his double
went down to his constituency and advocated Disestablish-
ment, Free Trade, and the Taxation of Land Values.
Naturally the Confederates began to strop their daggers.
In the circumstances the only thing for the hon. and gallant
Member to do was to trot down to Great Baggerton the next
afternoon, and repudiate the speech ; whereupon late that
night the double turned up in the House and repudiated
the repudiation. But the double had even better jokes
in hand. He gave the whole of the Colonel's employés
(The Co-operative Household Stores, Ltd.) a holiday
better or worse than the bulk, but
to celebrate the birth of a

tive brevity: “One night at
White's, observing the Post-
master-General, Sir Everard
Fawkner, losing a large sum

SELWYN was sent down from
Oxford for a blasphemous esca-
pade unredeemed by flash of
humour. He lived partly upon
his father, partly upon the State,
which bestowed small pensions
for sinecure offices. There is
no record that he earned an
honest penny in his life. Two
illusions are connected with his
individuality. By one he is
labelled a wit; by the second
he is described as an habitual
attendant at public executions.
Mr. KERR dispºses of both, more
completely of the first. Inci-

wife heard nothing of this till
later, when at a mass meeting
of the men the middle-aged
couple were solemnly presented
with a christening-bowl. Imagine
the lady's horror. You will find
these truthful narrations and
others in The Troubles of Colonel
Marwood (F. W. White). Unfor-
tunately Mr. A. C. Fox-DAVIES
has hardly done justice through-
out to his happy idea. Melo-
drama, rather than comedy, is
his medium, and he does not
seem quite at his ease in a book
of this kind.
When I saw Mr. ARTHUR MoR-
RISON's name on the cover of
Green Ginger (HUTCHINSON) I ex-
pected the book to contain some
powerful, gloomy stories of
Shoreditch slums and Essex vil-
lages; but I was wrong. Essex

Is just a little raw or else a little overdone.
There are, besides the folk who hunt, a number who do not,

But just too much coincidence to suit a seasoned taste.

due to him not only for creating
laughable situations, but for allowing the curtain to fall upon
them at precisely the right moment. “Mr. Bostock's Back-
sliding” and “A Lucifo Match" left me chuckling both at
what is told and also at the ludicrous events which must
inevitably follow. Mr. MoRRison has invented some most
amusing and plausible rascals, and has watched over them
so carefully that their little games are not interrupted by the
attentions of inquisitive policemen. Bill Wragg, indeed,
who “began business in the parrot line with a capital of
nothing and no parrots,” had more good luck in a few hours
than comes to most people in a lifetime. As a digestive, to
be taken in small quantities after dinner, I cordially recom-
mend Green Ginger.
The following Book Review has appeared in the Agony
Column of The Times:—
“In absence and silence, we keep the watch on Rhine;
Woe worth the latest book, one fired down the line ! M. A. D.”
The critic does well to be reticent about the names both of the
book and its author, for the tone of his review is very bitter.

sHouTING For A Tax on Noise.
[Mr. Runcim AN has been stumping the country and breathing revenge
against those who urge the Government to guarantee our naval scuity.
At Wolverhampton he threatened them with Budget reprisals, suggest-
ing, in a passage itself not too subd ed in tone, the “new principle,” that
“He who shouts the loudest pays most.” Later, at Newcastle, he is
reported by The Chronicle to have said: “We know where weath
lies . . . and when the time comes round for the Budget I hope the
patriots won't squeal.”] - - -
How ever will you do it, DAvid Lloyd?
How tell our natures each from each and say,
“This is a patriot: he shall fill my void ;
And this is not: and so he needn't pay ”?
How will you know just where to gorge?
I can't imagine, Mr. GEORGE.
The simple test of Party scarcely serves,
For there are Liberals who want a Fleet ;
Nor can you judge by noise that jars the nerves,
For there are patriots who restrain their heat,
Who do not shout till they are sore,
But, like the parrot, think the more.
And if you go by noise do you propose
To plant a taximeter on our tongues?
Or, with a wind-gauge lashed beneath our nose,
Check off the volume issuing from the lungs,
And charge upon a sliding scale
From zephyrs up to half-a-gale?
The principle is fairly sound, I own,
If not confined to those who shout for ships;
I'd love to see a Treasury metrophone
Instantly clapped on any noisy lips;
I loathe your kind that talk too loud—
Even a Little-Navy crowd.
So, Sir, if you would really have on toast
The ranter and the roarer; if your game
Is “He who shouts the loudest pays the most,"—

L. A. Mamma never played Hockey, did she?

L. A. Ah, I thought not, because I heard her shy the other
day that she didn't know what girls were coming to nowa-
days; they thought of nothing but games, and games made
them rude and mannish, and she was sure nice men didn't
like that kind of thing. She said a lot more, but I can't

Mabel. I’ve often told you, Arthur, that Mamma's a little
old-fashioned in these things—and, b, sides, who cares what
men think 2
L. A. But, Mabs, don’t girls want nice men to like them?
Mabel. We don't see why we should go out of our way to

You'll be an old maid all your life, beginning from now,

L. A. I've had my tea, Mabs.
you mean to be an old maid.
Mabel. Why, you silly little boy, of course I don't.
L. A. But then you’ll have to marry some one, Mabs; and
if you marry some one you can't live your own life, you
know ; and, oh, Mabs
Mabel. What's up now 2
L. A. Mabs, you’ll be a backslider, and I don't want you
to be that. Please, please don't be a backslider.
Mabel (with dignity). You may be quite sure that I shall
know how to go straight on. I shall never marry anyone
who won't agree— -
L. A. But that's what Helen Vincent said. Do you think
Mr. Knight agreed to things 2
Mabel. No, I don't. Men never do; and it's the fault of
the women.
L. A. Well, perhaps your man won't agree either. Are

INCREASING DEPRAVITY OF WOMAN.
ANOTHER IMPUDENT CASE of KLEPTOMANIA IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!
MORE PANIC.
Concident with the Navy “scare” (as
Hermany and the British Radical Press
call it—each, no doubt, for good reasons
of its own) several collateral cases of
unworthy panic have come under our
notice. We intend to expose some of
them, in the hope of shaming those who
have thus fallen from the high standard
of bull-dog courage which has made our
nation what it is.
A Mr. Jones, who recently bought the
Villa Maggiore, Nether Tooting, has, in
a moment of abject pusillanimity, taken
out a fire insurance policy. Coward
A Mr. Robinson, of Esperanto, Balham
Grove, has, in view of the uncertainty of
our Spring climate, acquired the un-
manly habit of wearing flannel next to
his contemptible skin. Coward |
A Mr. Brown, near whose residence,
which shall be nameless, a number of
burglars have lately been plying their
trade with impunity, has taken the
| un-English precaution of fitting his
doors and windows with electric alarms.
Coward
A Mr. Smith, of The Sanctuary,
Turnham Green, who moves in social
circles which have been decimated by
influenza, has adopted the despicable
practice of using tobacco as a disin-
fectant. Coward |
A Mr. Trotter, who has just returned
from the Malay Peninsula, admits that
under the enervating influence of a
tropical climate he allowed himself to
assume a pith helmet by day and mos-
quito curtains by night. Coward'
Owing to a paltry fear of collision
during a fog off Ushant, a Captain Tom-
kyns (the name of whose ship we sup-
press for the sake of the other officers,
whose courage is not in question) so far
forgot himself as to run his engines at
half-speed and sound his siren at fre-
quent intervals. Coward'
Both the Manchester United and
Bristol City Clubs, ignoring those splen-
did traditions of British gallantry by
which the adversary was always invited
to attack you unawares, and take every
other conceivable advantage of you,
have put their teams into strict training
for the Final of the Cup, and propose to
employ the maximum permissible num-
ber of players. Cowards!
Things that might have been put
differently.
In its review of Sixty Years in the
Wilderness, The Scotsman says:—
“So lively an author as the writer of “The
Diary of Toby M.P.' in Punch cannot be dull
even when talking about himself."
“Fven" is a happy touch.
Fashionable Intelligence.
“Mr. J. Heaven, of Jerusalem, is continuing
to make good progress towards recovery."
Adelaide Adrertiser.
More Commercial Candour.
From an advt. for artificial teeth :
“Mr. --— has fitted many patients who have
hitherto failed to obtain satisfaction.”—Dundee
Evening Telegraph.
It looks as if the juries contained too
many dental artists.
“In the two-furlong race Waterhouse was
first, Jones second, and Graham third, but when
they met in the quarter-mile Jones sec red the
premier marks.”—Manchcster Guardian.

[APRIL 14, 1900.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SEASON'S PROSPECTS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I have just been
studying those articles on “The Coming
Cricket Season,” which appear regu-
larly at this time of the year in the
daily papers. Shades of GAURRoDGER!
was there ever such dull reading 2 You
know (only too well, I expect) the sort
of thing that is offered to us.
BLANKSHIRE.
“Blankshire will have the same
arduous programme as last year, with
the addition that the Australians will
be met at Blankton in the early part of
June. Mr. Robinson will once again
assume the command, and he expects to
have the services of all the amateurs and
paid players who were available last
year. No new talent has been unearthed,
though a young professional from Blob-
leigh is spoken of as likely to be useful
in the near future. Mr. Robinson speaks
highly of the prospects of his team, and
there can be no doubt that Blankshire
will take a creditable place in the final
order, if, indeed, they do not actually
win the championship. The Blankton
Week begins on the 1st of August.”
That, I fancy you will admit, is a
perfectly fair example of the sort of
thing which is expected to enliven our
Easter holiday. Now what can be done
to alter this distressing state of affairs 2
Well, I have two suggestions to make.
The first is that, in order to make the
forecasts really sensational, truth should
be disregarded altogether. There is at
least one paper which could do this
without any loss of reputation; which
indeed might acquire thus an added
reputation for consistency, in that it
brought its cricket prophecies into line
with its others.
I give two or three examples of the
sort of thing I mean.
Yorkshire.
“The personnel of the Yorkshire team -
is likely to be entirely changed this year.
In the early matches, at any rate, the
side will consist of ten Leeds amateurs,
all well-known billiard players, and
HARDISTY, who will captain the eleven.
Only one county will be met, and HAR-
Disty confidently expects that his side
will come out bottom of the list. A
match for the benefit of Lord HAWKE will
be played against the Australians in July.”
RENT.
“At the last moment Mr. E. W. Dillion
has had to resign the captaincy, and Sir
Gilpert PARKER has been appointed in
his place. All the counties will be met
twice, and, if necessary, three times,
while the Australians will be played on
second Thursdays throughout the season.
An interesting experiment will be made
by the committee, BLYTHE keeping wicket
for the first few matches, Huish having
been badly bitten in the thumb by a
rabbit. There will be no Canterbury
week this year, owing to the high-
handed action of the Mayor, and all the
matches will be played at Gravesend.”
SURREY.
“For some time it was doubtful if
Surrey would play any matches at all
this season, owing to a difficulty about
finding a ground, but a few acres have
now been secured in the neighbourhood
of Kennington, and here all the first-class
counties, the Australians, Northampton-
shire, and the Provincial Actors will be
met. Mr. RAPHAEL, Sir R. HERMON-HoDGE
and Mr. FRANK SMITH will turn out
among the amateurs; while JoE WARD,
ALF DEAKIN and the Mayor of Cambridge
are qualifying as professionals. The
whole of the Lancashire eleven have also
offered their services if required. There
will be no entrance fee at any of the
matches.” -
LEICESTERSHIRE.
“The team and fixtures will be the
same as last year except that Sir ARTHUR
HAZIERIGG will in future play as a pro-
fessional. The challenge from Australia
to five Test Matches, to be played to a
finish, has been accepted, and these will
be played on the first five days in June.”
Now, Mr. Punch, you see from this
how interesting cricket forecasts can be
made, given the necessary imagination.
But if you still maintain that Truth is
of the essence of the matter, then I offer
instead my second suggestion.
Why bother about the actual cricketers
who are going to play for the counties 2
For one man who watches them a hun-
dred will read about them. The interest
of the public, so far as our summer
game is concerned, lies elsewhere. This,
then, Mr. Punch, is how the ideal article
should be written:
PROSPECTs of THE SEASON.
The Westminster Gazette.
Mr. P. F. WARNER will once more turn
out signed articles in the first person
plural upon the doings of Mr. Noble,
Mr. TRUMPER, Mr. WAss, Mr. CARKEEK,
Mr. FRY, Mr. KERMODE, Mr. BENSKIN, Mr.
Hobbs and Mr. CRAIG.
The Daily Telegraph.
So far as we are informed there will
be no changes this year, and Major
TREvolt will again throw light upon the
dark corners of the game at the rate of
five lines per ball.
The Daily Mirror.
All the old words are again available,
and several promising young ones have
been unearthed. Moreover an entirely
new anecdote of Vic TRUMPER at Cam-
bridge will be played off on the public.
The Sportsman.
Side will again be assumed by
“Wanderer,” who will keep himself aw
fait with the inner council of the Selec-
tion Committee. In the early part of
the season he is expected to refer to
somebody's innings as being “like the
curate's egg, good in parts.” In this
case he may not be available for the rest
of the summer.
A novel feature of the season's pro-
gramme will be the inclusion every
three days of a list of the names and
states of the Colonials from whom the
Australian eleven will be selected. This
should be studied each time it appears,
so that, if Mr. Noble should decide
suddenly to give a trial to one of the
many Colonial residents in London, the
fact may not escape the attention of the
reader. --- - - ---
The Evening News.
An immense amount of new blood
will be infused into the side, the most
promising of them being “Old Blue,”
“Brixton C.C.,” “Fair Play,” “Z.,” and
“Englishman,” all of whom will point
out that if only somebody else had been
selected the result of the Test Matches
might have been different. -
There, Mr. Punch! How much more
interesting that would be | Yet there
is one forecast which I have omitted.
It comes under a heading not unknown
to you, and mentions that once more a
friendly attempt would be made to get
a little fun out of a body of good sports-
men who perform a difficult task quite
efficiently. A. A. M.
ROSES FOR SPRING PLANTING.
The Mawd Allan.-Pale flesh colour
tending to rosy blush ; scanty bloomer,
but perfect form. Fine for exhibition.
The Winston.—Uncertain. Liable to
revert to stock.
The Balfour.—Wery graceful contour;
requires protection. -
The Arthur Benson.—Very prolific;
flowers freely produced throughout the
season; good in the bud, but flat when
open.
The De Morgan.—Late blooming; elon-
gated form ; sport of Charles Dickens.
The Chesterton.—Exceptionally large
and of great substance; shape globular.
The Transformation.—Coppery tint,
with buff at base; growth vigorous;
edges waved.
The Suffragette.—Purple, white and
green; rampant climber, thorny; grows
freely on railings, requires severe cutting.

CNGLAND'S BEST (IRLS.
A STUDY IN THE FULSOME.
(With profuse acknowledgments to the Radical
Press.)
“BE good, sweet maid, and let who
can be clever,” was all very well for the
dowdy damsels of the mid-Victorian era.
But in our enlightened age girls are
very properly encouraged to be original.
If they are dowered with some special
gift, such as caricaturing or whistling,
or “Saloming,” as it is charmingly
called, they need not feel ashamed of it
as of an attribute disgraceful in their
sex. Indeed, as that stalwart organ of
democracy, The Daily Chronicle, truly
puts it, “without a certain cleverness
and sparkle, even beauty cannot make
its owner a success in society.” Wealth
is of course indispensable, though there
have been instances in recent years of
young girls with practically no fortunes
making brilliant matches. But it is
dangerous to build upon the unsubstan-
tial foundation of the exceptional. The
young girl is in fashion, to quote again
from our stalwart Radical contemporary,
but it is significant that of the beauties
specially singled out for appreciative
notice in its pages there is hardly one
who is not directly connected with “our
old nobility.”
Wise mothers—and modern mothers
are seldom wanting in astuteness—do not
keep their young “flapper” daughters
buried in the schoolroom until the day
of presentation. They prepare them for
their complete emancipation by a series
of preliminary canters. Thus they take
them to dine at the Fitz or the Tarlton
while the hair that is hanging down
their back is still their own. Once a
month at least in the best houses the
“flapper” is taken behind the scenes at
the Tav., or on the top of a motor bus,
or, when they are running, on a penny
steamer, so as to gain that wider view of
life so indispensable to the up-to-date
chatelaine. The modern girl who counts
is invariably a mistress of a rich and
copious vocabulary, and to their com-
mand of slang no less than to their looks
must be attributed the immense popu-
larity of Lady Sheila Swilly, Lady
Usquebaugh's high-spirited daughter,
and of Miss Marigo Smirnoff, one of the
most gifted Levantine débutantes of the
season. The upbringing of Lady Sarah
Boodle has been wholly unconventional,
and as her parents spend most of their
time in balloons, she is looking forward
to her first season with all the fouque de
die-huit ans. Until she was sixteen
Lady Sarah was allowed to read nothing
but The Sporting Times and The Statist.
This led, not unnaturally, to a violent
reaction, and Lady Sarah is now a
devoted student of MAETERLINCK, Mr.
W. B. YEATs, and FIONA MACLEOD.
Happily this development has not im-
paired her healthy enjoyment of bridge.
Last year she won £300 at this winsome
pastime, and one of the finest players at
the Portland is rumoured to have said
that if she gave her whole time to it
she might win three times that amount.
So far, however, Lady Sarah, with a
restraint that does her infinite credit,
has never played for more than ten
hours at a stretch.
One may fitly conclude this group of
winsome English girls by the mention
of two beautiful cousins, Lady Phoebe
Bunting and Miss Miriam Belshazzar.
By an extraordinary coincidence they
are both third cousins once removed of
Daphne, Lady Saxthorpe, whose coster
impersonations were so marked a feature
of her late husband's tenure of office as
Governor of Hong Kong. Lady Phoebe,
strange to say, never learned her
alphabet until she was nearly fifteen,
while her cousin had mastered the
intricacies of compound interest almost
before she could walk. Lady Phoebe is
a winsome blonde, while Miss Belshazzar
is a svelte brunette whose superb Semitic
profile recalls the delicious proboscis of
her illustrious grandfather, Sir Joshua
Schnabelheimer.

APRIL IN “THE STREET.”
APRIL of the shining tresses,
Tearful mouth, and laughing eyes!
Where the budding wildernesses
Wait the swallow's glad surprise,
Where the slender
Larch's tender
Green is new and neat,
Most folk set you ;
Yet I’ve met you
In Throgmorton Street !
When the City pigeon's cooing
Takes a soft domestic note,
When the daffodil is doing
Duty in the broker's coat,
When through highway,
Court and byway,
Gusts and sunshine range,
And the racing
Clouds are chasing
Over the Exchange;
What if rates be flat or firmer,
What if prices fill or back,
If I hear your sunny murmur
Of a four days' Easter slack,
Of absconding,
Vagabonding
From the Street's grim aisle,
While its chill stones,
Mammon's millstones,
Cease to grind awhile !
BLACKMAIL.
THE eminent West End physician felt
my pulse with his right hand, pushed a
thermometer as far down the basement
of my tongue as he decently could with
his leſt, and went out of the room. He
returned in two minutes, took out the
thermometer and examined it.
“Ha! Influenza : " he said. “Three
days in bed—this prescription’’ (he to k
one, ready written, from a pile on his
table)—“ that will be two guineas.”
“No l’” I said. “Not influenza, but
a cold—a common cold in the head, and
you know it.”
“Hush ’’ he implored; and his face
paled. He went swiftly and silently
across the room and locked the door.
“So you know all,” he said.
“I do; you may therefore tell me
everything,” I replied. Briefly, the
story he told me was as follows:
Twenty years ago this great doctor
was a young and struggling practitioner
in Tooting. One day there came to
consult him a man of unusually pros-
perous appearance suffering from a heavy
cold. The young doctor, in the moment's
excitement, made a mistake and diag-
nosed the case as influenza; and the
patient was so charmed that he shook
the young man warmly by the hand and
went hºme to bed, where the doctor
visited him each day for a week, run-
ning up a very useful little bill.
Not to be outdone, the patient's
friends, when they in their turn
fell victims to catarrh, called in the
same young doctor to ascertain whether
they too were not distinguished by
influenza. Having put his hand by
accident to the plough, our friend
refused to look back, and pursued the
downward path of worldly success.
Thereafter he never diagnosed a cold
in the head as anything but influenza.
He quickly made a reputation as a young
man who knew a bad thing when he saw
it; and his progress to Harley Street
was accomplished as easily as the descent
of Avernus.
“I have told you all this,” he con-
cluded, “because you had guessed it
already. It remains merely to add that I
place implicit confidence in your secrecy,
and to repeat that my fee is two
guineas.”
“Your confidence,” I said, “is not
misplaced. It remains merely to add that
my fee for discretion is five guineas,
and I will therefore trouble you for the
difference.” -
I have had a very good winter season.

the Strand :—

THE INSURANCE QUESTION.
“It is the duty of every man to insure
his life,” pronounced Patty.
“I had an uncle once,” said Dibchick.
She smiled.
“Don’t you believe me?” he asked.
“Oh yes, I daresay you had a dozen.”
“No, only two. They were twins,”
he added with a sigh.
“But what's that got to do with in-
suring your life?”
“You see,” he explained, “one of
them was an African bishop. I forget
what the other took up. I fancy he
eventually became a gentleman jockey.
But the point is that my uncle Arthur
was a bishop. In fact, they said that
with any luck he might have been an
archbishop; but unfortunately --
“Still, I don't quite see—”
He waved his hand. “Wait a mo-
ment. I'm just coming to it. What I
was going to say, when you interrupted
me—”
“I like that,” said Patty.
“Well, when I interrupted you, then.
What I was about to observe when I
interrupted you was that my uncle
Arthur felt very strongly on the subject
of insurance agents. He used to main-
tain that there was only one effectual
way of dealing with them. When they
called and suggested your insuring in
their office, you should always begin by
producing the whisky.”
“But I couldn't very well do that,
could I?”
“No, I suppose not. He was speak-
ing more from a bishop's point of view,
as it were. Well, after that, the next
thing to do, said my uncle Arthur, was
to mix them a liberal dose, and then,
holding the glass in your hand, say,
‘Would you mind letting me have a
prospectus?' Then they gave you the
prospectus, and you gave them the
whisky, and—well, then they went
away and tried to forget you.”
“I should have thought giving them
whisky would have been the very way
to make them call again.”
“Oh, no, not at all. Directly you
had given it to them, you murmured,
“Exeuse me,’ and rang the bell. Then
they would think you were in a great
hurry, and would drink it off quickly,
before they realised what they were
doing. That was the essential part of
the treatment. My uncle Arthur said
that you should never give them time
to sip a little, and then leave the rest,
or pour it into a flower-pot when they
thought you weren't looking. You see,
it wasn't the ordinary whisky; you got
it at the grocer's.”
“I don't think your uncle can have
been a very nice man,” said Patty.
“There you are wrong,” answered
Dibchick; “he was one of the best of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 5.
—John BURNS moved second reading of
Housing and Town Planning Bill. In
course of speech strongly denounced the
insalubrity and general undesirability of
what he called Back-to-back houses.
Reference fluttered hon. Members below
Gangway. Earlier in day, question
arising about noble lords lending Mr.
DU CROS spare motor cars for Party
purposes in Parliamentary elections,
ATToRNEY-GENERAL suggested that suit-
able time for legislation on subject
would be when whole matter of relatiºns
of two Houses comes up for considera-
tion.
“And when may that be?” blandly
asked WINTERTON, ever on alert in search
of useful information.
“It does not rest with me to fix the
day,” said Robson, with a sigh in his
soft voice. “Iſ it did I should certainly
make the date an early one.”
Thoughts thus attuned to the subject,
BRUNNER at first imagined that when
PRESIDENT of Local GoverNMENT BoARD
talked of Back-to-back houses he had in
mind the two Houses of Parliament,
separated as they are by a corridor.
LUpton, who, with intention of keeping
a closer eye on his late friend John (now
Right Honourable), shifted his position

terial side to Front Bench below Gangway
opposite, knew better. Long connection
with Leeds made him familiar with this
homely form of structure and its con-
veniences. In Back-to-back houses it is
the custom of an afternoon for the lady on
the third storey—usually with her cap
awry—to lean out of window and enter
into conversation with lady in window
opposite, whose proximity is happily so
close that one almost could, sometimes
nearly does, emphasise remarks by
tugging at the other's towzled hair.
Mr. LUPTON proceeded to adapt the
pleasing custom to habits of House of
Commons. Leaning out of what repre-
sented his window on the second floor
back opposite Treasury Bench, he offered
a few observations personal to PRESIDENT
of Local GoverNMENT BoARD and his
views on House Bill. J. B., always
ready for a fight, sharply responded.
Mr. LUPTON, with true Back-to-back-
house readiness, “let him have it’ in
reply.
Situation growing exciting when
SPEARER interposed with remark: “The
hon. Member must not carry on a con-
versation with the right hon. gentleman.
This is a debate, not a conversazione.”
Whereupon Mr. LUpton withdrew and
shut down his window with a bang.

Tuesday.—In a series of thirteen con-
secutive questions addressed to PRESIDENT
of BoARD of TRADE, Captain CRAIG told
touching, though intricate, story of an
Irish lifebuoy. As far as can be made
out from the medley of interrogations,
there is moored off Ballyquintin Point,
County Down, a lifebuoy, officially named
Strangford Lough buoy, because it is far
out of sight of Strangford. It was the
original intention of Irish Lights Com-
missioners to moor it about a mile and
a half from the bar mouth. Someone,
probably connected with the Land
League, having placed it at the distance'
named, it still bears the name of
Surangford.
A peculiarity about this buoy is that
at approach of night it regularly goes
out. It appears that the Irish Lights
Commissioners, “accompanied by some
members of the Elder Brethren,” spend
most of their spare time in putting forth
from Ballyquintin Point, making for the
buoy, and taking it away to be repaired.
The arduousness of this labour, long
endured, has so worked upon the mind
and body of Wiscount Monck, one of the
Commissioners, that he has retired from
the Board. Captain CRAIG sees oppor-
tunity of “appointing some representa-
tive of the Board of Trade to fill the
vacancy who will be responsible to Par-
liament in regard to questions affecting
the administration of the Board.”
Meanwhile he sternly demands that

THE TWO FRIENDS.
AFTER MR. Hil. AiRE BELLOC.
'Two men walked along the road
together. They walked because they
were poor, and they kept company
because they were friends. It was an
ordinary English road, bordered by
hedges, and CESAR's legionaries had not
passed that way for many years. Some
people say that CESAR's legionaries have.
never marched on that road at all, which
is a very strange thing.
One of these men was named Deux
Bocks; he was a Gaul of cheerful tem-
perament and active tongue. Also his
nose was of the colour of carmine—not
lake or red ochre, but carmine. One
cannot mistake a nose of that kind. His
companion was a Teuton, and he was ||
called Wiedersellen—Alf Wiedersehen.
Now Deux Docks the Cheerful was
strange in his manner of walking. He
went from side to side and often brushed
the hedges with his coat-sleeve. (There
were hedges on both sides of this road.)
When he had thus brushed a hedge he
would turn to his companion and smile,
and say nothing. Then he would walk
obliquely to the other side of the road,
and do the same thing again. CESAR's
legionaries never walked in this way.
Alf Wiedersehem was not like Deux
Bocks, and he was dressed in a more
fashionable style. He wore a black
morning coat, for one thing; a silk
cummerbund clasped his ample waist,
and on his head was a deerstalker hat,
the flaps of which were tied up with
ribbon as the weather was sultry. Be-
cause of his habit of dressing in the
height of fashion he had often been
mistaken for an insurance agent, but he
was nothing of the kind. He was a
quantity surveyor.

and rode off. As he turned the corner

one English word—“IRats!”
Deux Bocks was the next to speak.
“Je suis sec comme un poisson' "
he said. Then he added “Hélas !” and
shook his head; for the turnips dis-
heartened him.
After a while the two friends
continued on their way to the next
town, and spent the night in an ale-
house.
In the parlour-bar stood two men,
dressed in uniform. They were Terri-
torials, and were dressed quite unlike
C+salt's legionaries. Nevertheless they
were sociable fellows—one was taller
than the other—and they drank bottled
beer until the clock struck eleven. Then
they left.

No. III.--Why They Appreciate ME At
THE OFFICE.
What do you mean by “late”?
Very well, then, I apologise. I know
my time is not my own, but I think it
unreasonable that I should be criticised
for keeping an appointment with my
doctor. -
I gather it would be superfluous to
refer you to the doctor, because if you
don't believe me you'll think me capable
of going to a doctor who tells lies.

is as important as all that. Punish me

AMERICA AND THE MASTERS.
CAUGHT by our representative at the
Savoy Hotel, Mr. CyßUs K. GARNER, the
famous millionaire collector of Chicago,
willingly consented to discuss the re-
moval of the 60 per cent. tariff on all
works of art imported into the United
States.
“It will,” he said, “make a great
difference to me. In fact, that is why
I am visiting Europe. Now that one
can freely take back whatever one buys
I mean to buy in earnest. I mean to
make this effete island and that old
back number of a Continent contribute
the best there is to my walls.
“I’m a bit of a poet in my way,”
he went on. “I’ve made my money
out of pork, and artists paint their
ictures with hogs' bristles, I'm told.
o you see? My idea is that a man
who has made his money out of pig's
flesh can't spend that money more
poetically than on the products of pig's
hair. That's why I'm out for old
masters.
“Now they tell me there's a house
here in London called Artford House,
or something like that, that's full of Old
Masters. Well, I'm here to buy it.
I'm here, too, to do a deal over your
National Gallery, if you’ve got enough
business enterprise to consider it. Then
I shall go over to Paris, where I’m told
there’s a unique called the “Venus of
Milo.’ That's my programme, young
man. But I wouldn't have thought
twice about it as long as the 60 per
cent. tariff was on.”
Our American correspondent tele-
graphs that the consternation which was
expected to reign at Coromaker's great
fine art store in Pittsburg is quite
absent. “Yes,” said Mr. Coromaker,
when asked his opinion, “the lifting of
the impost will no doubt tend to cause
many of our connoisseurs and collectors
to go to Europe direct for their pictures;
but that will not injure our business.
We were prepared for it, and have now
a number of agents in London and on
the Continent whom we shall keep
supplied with excellent works of the
Barbizon school. The only difference
will be that these pictures will now
cross the Atlantic twice, instead of never
having travelled at all ; but a corre-
sponding rise in price will recoup us
for the outward journey, and of course
the journey back is the connoisseur's
affair.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE first thing to notice about Uncle Gregory (HEINEMANN)
is that Uncle Gregory himself, the central character who gives
his name to the story, has been dead six months before it
opens. This, however, does not prevent his being the
strongest and, in a sense, most vital figure in the book.
Bolily Uncle Gregory sleeps with his fathers; spiritually his
monstrous personality lives on, dominating and crushing all
who are brought within its influence, even as his Benefactions
dominate the neighbourhood in which he moved. It is the
history of the last and greatest of these Benefactions, the
colossal Trust left by Gregory Rowley to be administered by
his unhappy heirs, that has given GEORGE SANDEMAN the
theme for a very unusual and entertaining story. Of plot in
the ordinary sense there is none—nothing but the overpower-
ing memory of Uncle Gregory, and its effect upon the group of
two countries, have had no effect in mitigating Irish animosity
to British rule. Mr. O'BRIEN's book is a compendiguš
contribution to knowledge of the machinery by which that
rule has for more than a century been administered.
The Measure "...". "outh (LANE) is not a discussion of
the standard to required of Territorials, but a rather
pessimistic view of the romantic temperament. For some
reason or other ALICE HERBERT has handicapped her hero
with an Eurasian origin and an alcoholic father, but as no
attempt is made during the rest of the book to in-ist on the
doctrine of heredity, I can only regard these particulars as
incidental. Francis Bewley falls in love with a beautiful
but terribly matter-of-fact girl at home, and after being
repulsed as insufficiently wealthy, experiences a course of
amorous adventures, some rather sordid and discreditable,
and then, having formed the acquaintance of two “fathers”
who conduct an East-End mission, becomes violently—not to
say hysterically—religious. Finally he is bequeathed two
very human sur-
hundred pounds a
vivors who have to
struggle with it.
And all the time

promises to devote

Mr. BARRY O'BRIEN. He knows it from its roof-tree to its
spacious cellars, which once held a fine assortment of claret.
In Dublin Castle and the Irish People (KEGAN PAUL), he tells
its story in detail. , Very instructive it is, on the whole pain-
ful, in no wise creditable to the predominant partner of the
Union. The only Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant whom
Irishmen hold in reverence is THOMAS DRUMMOND, author of the
immortal, illuminating aphorism, “Property has its duties
as well as its rights.” DRUMMOND has long been buried, and
there is no harm in praising a dead Englishman, albeit for a
time lie dominated Irish affairs from Dublin Castle. The real
truth underlying Irish discontent is that, whether the hand
of the British Government strokes or strikes, it is an alien
hand. It follows that the enormous sacrifices of party
interests and national resources, made since Mr. GLADSTONE forty
will forgive me!) which introduces
suspect it to be the
place where they bring the buried ingots and Roman coins
that are unearthed from time to time. If so, it was far too
heady a vocation for Mr. Bewley. He ought to have been in
sonnething more tranquillising, file the Board of Agriculture
or the War Office. - ". . .
The title of The Canon's Dilemma (FISHER UNWIN) is taken
from the first of a collection of short stories for which, ap-
parently, Mr. Victor L. WhiteCHURCH wishes a longer life
than is accorded to the contents of popular magazines. Per-
sonally I am not assured that they are worth it. When I
read of the canon, on the first page, that, “discarding his
clerical frock coat and collar, he would put on a rough blue
guernsey and sea boots instead,” I felt that his dilemma
might present interesting possibilities. But I was dis-
appointed, for the real dilemma was not that one at all, but
another far less exciting than any which might be expected
to arise from a canon wearing waders round his neck. The
stories are nearly all about parsons of some grade or another,
and I am inclined to judge from the inherent improbability
of most of the situations that parsons are the least likely of
all readers to be attracted to them. Perhaps in remote
country parishes, where the improbable is regarded as liable
to happen, there may be a chance for the book. I wish it luck.

HOME FISHERY FOR CITY CLERKS.
[This article seems to us in close accord with a certain class of fishing
chronicle favoured by a contemporary, an eminent Sporting Weekly.]
THAT the British sportsman of humble means can possess a
first-class fishery within the bosom of his family and ten
miles of Charing Cross is a fact not generally known. That
such nevertheless is the case we will proceed to demonstrate.
The fishery in question is situated at the house bearing
the title “stone,” which is the latter half of the name
“ Elphinstone” shared by two houses in Mount Sion Avenue,
West Dulwich, the word being inscribed across the joint.
The garden, which extends for a distance of forty-seven
yards behind the house, contains the fishery referred to.
This consists of a cemented basin four feet two inches in
diameter and twenty-seven inches deep in the middle. The
basin formerly had two cracks in it, A and B, which were
stopped with red lead putty applied with the tin-opener.
The pool is fed by a pipe the origin of whose supply is un-
known, and in time of drought is replenished from the
scullery tap by means of a rubber hose. This water has a
bracing effect on the fishery and acts like a tonic.
In May of last year two trout (Salmo feror), weighing
respectively 1 lb. 2 ozs., and 10% ozs., were purchased at a
restaurant in Old Coventry Street. They were named Charles
and Jane for convenience of reference and were conveyed
to “Elphinstone " in a bait can per electric tram. Both fish
arrived faint, but appeared to revive when introduced to their
new quarters. Next morning, however, the fish Jane was
discovered to be in a defunct condition, and was accordingly
buried with regret near the roots of an indiarubber plant
which had been bedded out after wintering in a pot on the
dining-room table. It may be observed however that fresh
fish is not a form of nourishment readily assimilated by
indiarubber plants that have passed their prime.
What follows is the Diary of the “Elphinstone" fishery,
and though the season came to a premature conclusion it
will be seen that excellent sport was enjoyed. It should be
added that the natural food resources of the fishery were
supplemented by judicious allowances of Tidd's Fario Feed,
a savoury compound, price £14 10s. 0d. a ton, very nutritious,
and much relished by Charles. -
DIARY.
June 3.−Began fishing at 3.15 with a 00 Sneck Limerick
Hook dressed as a Greenwell's Glory. At the first cast
Charles came brightly to the hook. He fought strongly, and
it was nearly two minutes before the net could be got under
him. During the following half-hour caught Charles five
times, when the fish unaccountably went off feed. (Note.—
This has proved to be a record bag for the fishery.)
June 5.--Got Charles twice before tea on a Greenwell's
Glory. The water fishes excellently. (Note.—Greenwell's
Glory is greatly under-rated, in fact, when tied with gold
ribbing, it proved to be Charles's favourite fly.)
June 6.—Did not fish this day.
June 7.-The fish puzzles me. Began fishing at 340.
Charles saw me, but aſter tea he was caught twice. The
second time he made no fight, but came to the net like a log,
and then suddenly turned and bit me savagely on the thumb.
(Notc.—Too much care cannot be exercised in handling large
trout.) -
June 8 and 9.-These days I did not fish.
June 10 and 11.—Caught Charles once on each of these
days. He appears to be getting listless, but continues to fish
fairly well.
June 12.-Charles saw me. -
June 17.-Have fished carefully these last three days, but
Charles will not rise. Cannot make out what is wrong.
Have sent for patterns of patent Varox flies.
June 19.-A disappointing day. Fished with the patent
flies; no result. Then changed my clothes, whereupon
Charles rose at the Varox, but I missed him. He splashed
about all over the pool like a mad thing. Cannot under-
stand the fish. The Varox patent flies are beautifully tie
and very expensive. -
June 30.-Have been fishing every day, but had no rise;
greatly perplexed. -
July 2.—Have solved mystery. Charles feeds at might.
Happened to go into garden aſter supper and found Charles
rising. He saw me and stopped. Felt embarrassed. Will
try to-morrow.
July 3.—A memorable night. Approached pool at 10.30 P.M.
with White Moth fished dry. Got into Charles instantly,
who made a great fight. Caught him twice again before
leaving him at 3.15 A.M. It is certain that I have a magni-
ficent bit of fishing all to myself. (Note. —The White Moth
is a fly that is too infrequently used. There is no more
deadly lure when fished dry after nightfall.) -
July 4.—This day has been disastrous. Tried Charles
again after supper. He rose cautiously to my sixth cast, and
was hooked. He fought a little, and then let me reel him in ;
but just as I was stooping to put the net under him he made
a rush and came right out of the water at me. I fell back,
and in saving myself unfortunately broke my rod and the
hook got embedded in the lobe of my left ear. Charles,
after throwing about in a threatening manner, got back into
the pool unassisted. (Note.—It is impossible to pull a fish-
hook out of the lobe of the ear by force. It must be cut
out, and even if the sufferer can refer to the files of The
Family Doctor, the operation, when attempted within the
home circle, is apt to lead to marital estrangement.)
July 18.-As I observed Charles to be feeding again,
telephoned Pilquart of the Flyfishers' Club to come for an
afternoon's sport to-morrow.
July 19.-Strange matters. Pilquart came and lunched.
He likes my “Weedy Whiffs.” As he had brought waders
under a misapprehension and seemed a little depressed, I
promised him a Weedy Whiff for every time he landed

Charles. I put him right and left him. When I returned
an hour later I found him lying on the grass smoking. He
astonished me by telling me that I owed him a shilling box
of Weedy Whiffs, and invited me to try to win them back.
I went on casting steadily until tea-time without getting a
rise, although Pilquart encouraged me and gave me much
advice. After tea Pilquart took his rod, but, to my astonish-
ment, instead of fishing, began to put up his tackle and gave
me to understand that he was going home to fish his bath, as
he had reason to know he should find as good fish there as at
the “Elphinstone fishery.” It then transpired that Charles
was gone and that Pilquart had discovered the fact early in
the afternoon.

fishery it is advisable to fix barbed wire along the top of the
fence when there is a boy living next-door.)
TO A CUCKOO, HEARD ON THE LINKS.
BohemiAN spirit! unencumbered by Penates,
And sole performer of the woodland band
Whose contributions I can recognise with great ease,
Let others count you shifting as the sand,
But surely underneath that bosom black-barred
There lurks a sentiment that I (the hack-bard)
Can fully comprehend. So, cuckoo, here's my hand.
Not for the sake of ease you flit about the copses
And bid your partner to an alien care
Entrust the incubation of her popsy-wopsies,
Planting the eggy mites at unaware ;
But art, the voice of art, is ever calling.
How could CARUso sing with infants squalling?
To fetter genius is to drive it to despair.
Should I not also turn my heartstrings to macadam?
I too deposit, whereso'er I could,
A host of unmelodious babies (if I had 'em)
Or in the kindly shelter of some wood
(With robins), or whatever crèche was going,
Soon as I felt the inspiration flowing,
The bubbling in my brain-pan? Yes, by Jove, I should.
'Tis therefore that I sometimes wonder when I hear you
Fulfil the valley with that vagrant noise,
Now by the holm-oak yonder, now beside this near yew
(Unhampered as you are by household ploys),
Why you have never hit on something neater,
Some outburst less monotonous of metre,
Less easy to be aped by unregenerate boys.
Is it perhaps that, like that other star, the throstle,
Simply to prove your throat can stand the strain
You too keep on, the Spring's repetitive apostle,
Piping your pacan till it haunts the brain 2
I cannot say. But what I find so sad is
One never knows if you or if the caddies
Are making all that rumpus. There it goes again

Poor dear Veronica in her bridal gown,
with her maids and her pages and her
parents and her best enemies and every-
thing that is hers, waiting at St. Agatha's

up wonderful, fearful stories on it, but
not one of them touches the spot. The
true inwardness of the affair, my dear,
is puzzles, no less! For a week Piggy
had been putting together one of the
big, diſfy ones, and when the wedding
morning came they couldn't get him
away from it. His best man argued
with him, and even tried force, but it
was no good. “I won't be married,”
screamed Piggy, “till I've polished off
this blank puzzle!”
And by the time he has polished off
the blank puzzle, and comes out among
his kind again, he'll find himself treated
to the cut direct and the cut with cir-
cumstance wherever he goes, and per-
haps thrashed by one of the Wandeleurs.

Josiah's back again from San Banga-
dor safe and sound and horribly glad to
be at home. He has an idea that he's
very much altered by what he went
through there; but it's only a pleasant
delusion on his part. As a matter of
fact, he's more like himself than ever!
He has some fearful friends in tow that
he knew out there—a planter-man and
his wife; simple and utterly impossible
people, my dear! The wife wears silk
and satin frocks first thing in the morn-
ing, and chirps out, “Beg y' pardon 2''
whenever one speaks to her. The man
does such weird things with his knife
and fork at feeding time that Norty
said to me one evening, “Is that your
own idea, Blanche, to have a conjurer to
amuse us at dinner ?” Also, the wretch
makes puns, if you please ! When he
let one off the other day and seemed to
think I would laugh at it, I said, “Oh,
that's a pun, is it? What deliciously
moss-grown old things they are The
chignons and long whiskers of conversa-
tion, don't you think?” He hasn't
made any since.
I've done my level to be civil to
them, said how interesting it must be to
be a planter, and watch the things grow-
ing and pick them when they're done
enough, and what a wonderful arrange-
ment it is of what-d'you-call-it that the
leaves of the plant should make tea, and
the berries coffee, and another part sugar
—and all that sort of thing, you know.
And as if that weren't enough, I find
Josiah expects me—me, you know–
myself—your own Blanche, to take this
tea-and-coffee woman about and show
her London.' ' Meaning the Tower, the
Monument, the British Museum, and all
those other chambers of horrors' As if
they had anything to do with London.
Oh, my dearest! such a funny little
something happened just after Josiah's
return. I'd got a bit careless, I sup-
pose, in leaving things about while I
was on my own, and one day I found
him looking at a certain }rttle miniature
of an eye that someone gave me as an
Easter offering —a dark eye, never mind
whose, with a look of mischief in it and
a setting of brilliants. “Whatever 's
this 2 ” said the Head of the Firm in a
queer voice. I felt it was a case for
“ de l'audace, de l'audace, et encore de
l'audace.” “Why, you silly man,” I
said, “don’t you know your own eye
when you see it?” “Mine!” he said.
“My eyes are light.” “That's all you
know ! When you're animated and
excited your eyes look quite dark. I
snap-shotted you once when they looked
dark, and this was done from it.”
And (oh, ces hommes ces hommes!)
he actually took it all in, and was quite
flattered, and has given me a new long
chain of brilliants to hang the miniature
on " 'There are some people, you see,

Everyone who's been round the

of Sibyl St. James. Profile, of course.
Bosh says she’s “profile et pretty well
nihil,” meaning, you know, that she's
only a profile. And certainly she's
sacrificed everything to that profile of
hers. She doesn't give dinners or
suppers or go to them. Et pourquoi?
Because the profile mustn't be seen eat-
ing! She hasn't any friends. It isn't
that people won't know her; they can't.
How can one be pally with a profile, or
make a confidant of it, or talk scandal
with it, or do anything but just look at
it? We were talking about Sibyl at
Wee-Wee's the other night, and Bosh
said people told a story of her husband
meeting her suddenly round a corner
one day and not recognising her, be-
cause he'd never seen her front face
before. Ever thine, BLANCHE.
THE PORTERESQUE.
[“During the hearing of a motor-car case at
Bournemouth a witness, described as a porter,
said: “I saw a motor-car coming towards me
with marvellous rapidity, and if I had not
possessed great agility and youthfulness I
should have been killed. I afterwards looked
round at the driver's face, which was scintil-
lating with vicious grins. The driver also
made some insipid remarks, and the car was
travelling with the silence and swiftness of a
shrapnel shell.’”—Morning Leader.]
IN the interests of the colour of life it
is to be hoped that the Bournemouth
porter will set a fashion—more than
that, inaugurate a tradition. How much
more entertaining would the daily rou-
tine become if all public servants talked
like this Not only porters, but com-
missionaires and boy-messengers, and
policemen and postmen too. Perhaps
Mr. RUNCIMAN will smile upon the scheme
and arrange for lecturers in the Porter-
esque to visit the schoo's. Then some
such results as these might follow :-
In directing an old lady from the
country who had asked the way to the
Bank, a constable stationed yesterday at
Trafalgar Square replied thus: “Dear
Madam, the journey is not only simple
but of engrossing interest. The first
step is to leave the august spot on which
we now stand, overshadowed as it is

then traversing Fleet Street and climb-
ing the Hill of Ludgate, be under the
façade of Sir CHRISTOPHER WREN's mighty
fane, now the lunching resort of the
wholesale drapery trade . . .”
Or again, at Charing Cross Station,
a porter wheeling a truck may thus
chatter: “Your consideration I crave
to allow this not inconsiderable vehicle
to pass. This way, lady, for the train
which in course of time will take its
departure from this platform on its
perilous and protracted journey with the
nominal intent of reaching the ancient
seaport of Dover (one of the Cinque
Ports) at 5.3. At what hour, however,
its happy arrival will actually occur
one hesitates to hazard. Conjecture's
fires pale before such a problem. This
way, lady, this way.”
A hotel porter, having been inadver-
tently mistaken for the boots by a short-
sighted guest, would reply to a request
about calling him in the morning in the
following terms: “Incurious stranger,
why this sad confusion of functions?
Dost thou truly believe this uniform to
be attuned to the ignoble duty of foot-
wear-cleaning? Or is thy mistake due
to myopia, astigmatism, or incipient
cataract 2 Discuss, infatuated stranger,
for, as thou art aware, the ball of repartee
cannot be kept up without constant
repercussion.”
Once more, if the Porteresque diction
becomes general, we can easily imagine
a caddie, on being asked by a beginner
what is the best club to use for a long
approach shot, lapsing into poetry as
follows:–
“Fair Sir, although the lie be grassy
I cannot recommend the brassy.
Again, undoubted risks environ
Your handling of the cleek or iron,
For on each side, I grieve to state,
Pot-bunkers simply pullulate.
To use a baffy or a spoon
Were unpropitious and jejune.
In fine, my deſt elimination

And, to conclude this talky-talky,
Just take your mashie and play pawky.”

Services.

[APRIL 21, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOME NEW HEAD-LINES.
[With acknowledgments to all rival Arbiters
of Fashion.]
So Spring, the sweet Spring, is here,
and most of us are maturally giving
anxious thought to the subject of our
'' top-dressing '' – as , a witty young
Marquis of agricultural tastes once called
his hat in my presence. Having just
returned from naughty, enticing, de-
lightful Paris, where I made my annual
tour of the magasins des modes, I am now
in a position to indicate precisely what
surprises Dame Fashion has in store for
you. The “cartwheel” has gone —
trundled into the limbo of forgotten
things; the busby we can suitably re-
linquish to those dear Territorials, now
that they are preparing in grim earnest
to frighten the wicked invader from our
poor, peaceful shores; and the beehive,
symbol of industry and perseverance,
is, appropriately enough, to be the wear
par excellence of those who are making
another attempt this year to take
advantage of the season's influence upon
“a young man's fancy.” Entre mous, a
balmy smile goes best with this really
“dossy" chapeau, and the coiffure, being
completely hidden, may be worn négligee,
or be left at home altogether.
But a greater surprise awaits you in
the “barn thatch.” - This sensational
design is in the form of any other
thatched covering of an empty top-loſt,
and can be worn “fore-and-aft,” as our
gallant tars plurase it, when beating up
against those boisterous winds that
come “before the swallows dare; ” or
“broadside on ” in the wet, when the
| eaves carry the rain clear of the shoulders.
The yokel laugh, which is something
between a Swiss yodel and a contralto
| chuckle, can be practised for use with
this.
And now, looking allead into those
days “with roses red incarnadine,” when
the daily papers tell us that “yesterday
was the hottest 10th of June for ninety-
one years,” what do you say, my lady
fair, to the “water-butt" hat? Isn't the
idea arresting 2 But, to let you into a
secret, this is an adaptation of the “wine-
cask" straw with which the hatters
made an abortive attempt last season to
oust the “boater ’’ for men—a hat, by
the way, which has nothing but cheap-
ness and comfort to recommend it. So
great, however, is the obstimate prejudice
of the “lords of creation’ against any-
thing really striking and conspicuous
that not even in Paris, that city of flán-
eurs, would any male creature muster
up sufficient courage to don it.
A propos, I must tell you a story, which
goes to show that some of these strange
creatures positively admire dowdiness in
us. I was at a smart afternoon reception
the other day, in a Faubourg not a
thousand miles from the Pont Neuſ,' remarkable in that, because, of course,
when an English “mees” came in with
her papa, a brown-faced Colonel from
India's coral strand. Pretty she was,
undeniably, but, if you believe me, she
was wearing one of those hats we all
thought so becoming in the spring of
1907 ' ' ' You never saw anything more
countrified or ridiculous, more—in a
word—hopelessly middle-class.
Two mice - looking, well - groomed
English boys were standing near me.
“Hulloa ” said one, “what a pretty
girl!” “Awfully fetching hat--what?”
growled the other. And one gaby went
off, no doubt to manoeuvre for an intro-
duction, while the other sighed a big
sigh. And I daresay I did too, to think
that these great, irrational creatures have
votes, while we pioneers of taste and
fashion, who put our heads fearlessly
into beehives at the word given, have
In One.
But revenoms a mos moutons, as a
humorous Frenchman said to me once
when the telephone bell had called him
momentarily from the dinner-table. The
“water-butt” should be built of chip, in
one of the latest art-shades—a “garden-
seat” green or “boiled gooseberry”
grey. Trimmed with duck-weed or
water-cress, and conveying a pleasantly
cooling suggestion of water on the brain,
nothing certainly could look better in
the languid heat of the dog days.

chick, “I remember, years and years

“It’s no good your attempting the

“ because you can't be so very old, now.

“I don't think,” said Bob calmly, “I

Dibchick regarded him with an air of
approval. “You will end as a legis-
lator, Bob.”
“Rot,” said Bob ; “I know you're
thirty-five. It isn't a thing that wants
thinking about.”
“There you are wrong. Of all the
seventy ages of man, thirty-five is the
one that affords food for the most
serious reflection. At thirty-five a man
has lost the first blush of youth,

Patty turned again to Bob.

“No,” said Bob. “If he had, he
wouldn't mention it.”
“To return to our original topic,”
said Dibchick. “Speaking of clothes, I
remember, when I was at the Varsity, a
friend of mine introduced me, as a great
favour, to his tailor, a very pleasant
fellow. Not that there is anything
“Do you
tailors are, as a general rule, a parti-
cularly ingratiating body of men. Well,
all I wanted at the time was a tweed
suit. Six months afterwards we found
that I owed him seventy-eight pounds. |
He was quite as much surprised about
it as I was.”
“You must have been a juggins,”
said Bob. - -
“No, I think not. You see, when he
had once got my measurements, he
contracted a habit of sending things
round on trial, as it were; and of course,
when a man has actually gone to the
trouble of making a thing for you, it
seems rather—er—rather a reflection on
him to send it back again. I've got
loſs of his garments by me still. I
remember his speciality was overcoats
and kilts.” -
“Have you lived much in Scotland 2’’
asked Patty. -
“No, that's just the point. I explained
to him that I didn't really need kilts,
because the only place I went to in the
vacation was the Channel Islands.
he said you never knew when they
might come in useful. When I took my
degree, I gave them to my scout. He
was a man with several small daughters,
who had once played inside right for
Oxford City. So naturally he was very
glad of them.”
“Did all his daughters play inside
right together?” asked Bob.
“No, he was alone there. They never
joined him. I should have made that
clearer. It was before he had acquired
any daughters to speak of.”
“Were they all daughters?” inquired
Patty.
“I believe there was a boy here and
there; but it was the girls he was
really wrapt up in.”
“I thought it was the kilts,” said
Bob.
Dibchick leant back in his chair and
blew rings of cigarette smoke. Patty
watched him respectfully.
“You’re rather good at those things,”
she said.
“Oh, I don't know,” he answered
modestly; “the plain, straightforward
article is easy enough, but I seem to
have lost, the knack of breaking them |
from keg.”
Bob got up. “I vote we leave him,
Patty. Let's go and play croquet.”
“But I should like to have under-
stood about the kilts,” said Patty.
“Why should his scout have been so
glad of them ’’’
"To tell the truth,” said Dibchick,
“he wasn't—at first; at least, not so
much. His original idea—a poor one—
was that his wife might work them into
a tea-cosy or a bed-quilt or something
of that kind. But being a woman of
social ambitions, she thought it would

THE saddest thing I ever saw 2 he
said. Well, I don't know that I can
remember quite the saddest, at this
moment, but one of the saddest was a
row of railway trucks on the line some-
where near Redruth, on the way to
Penzance. We had left London full of
anticipation of our holiday—in thorough
holiday mood—the sky seemed for the
moment to have no clouds in it—and
then suddenly we came upon this pathetic
sight, a row of dispirited trucks in a
siding, on each of which was painted the
bitter words: “This truck not to go
east of Truro.” Now think of that
Think of what it must mean to an
adventurous ambitious truck to have its
wings thus clipped by some unimagina-
tive jackamapes of a traffic superin-
tendant' Our hearts bled for them.
I am fairly phlegmatic myself, but I
could not bear to look at them ; and
when my wife saw how small they were,
she completely broke down. You know
women, sir, you know their tender ways.
The fact that the trucks were so small
certainly made it worse. One pictured
the new ones full of freshness, unaware
of the cruel legend on their sides,
running up to Truro so gaily and confi-
dently, all expectant of their long and
delightful journey to the east, and then
being pulled up sharp and sent back
again without a word of explanation.
No east of Truro for them ' I'or them
the dull west. Dull indeed. For what has
life to offer west of Truro when you may
not go east 2
One thought of the young ones forced
to listen to the talk of large trucks who
had been to Plymouth and Exeter and
London even. Could there be a harder
fate than that—to have to hear of the
promised land knowing you may never
enter it? We wondered if one of them
had ever managed to break away and
run the blockade of Truro station. But
I fear not; man, and especially official
man, is too sharp, too tyrannical.
The incident entirely spoiled our holi-
day. My wife moped all the time, and
though she was as brave as she could be
she did not deceive me—I knew where
her thoughts were. How could I fail to,
when mine were there too?
Poor little trucks.

With poets, onions, eggs, and early peas,
With fragile blossoms blooming undetected,
And fleecy lambs a-scamper on the leas;

And girls are ironing their linen bonnets,

Caulks his dismantled lung,
And plays the living deuce with SHAKSPEARE's native tongue,

Retard the genial glow of actual Spring;
Although the feathered choirs, with frappés gizzards
Still feel an inability to sing.

In leaf and blade the vital sap is humming,

THE POETRY OF “BRADSHAW "
ANNOTATED.
[In the manner of the Higher Criticism
of Poetry.]
“PASSENGERS commencing a long dis-
tance journey on a Saturday or Sunday,
when the destination will not be reached
till the following day, are recommended
to consult the detailed tables covering
the whole of the Route, as the Train
service on Sundays often differs from
that on Week Days.”
The above selection opens with a most
complex mixture of metres and with a
very large proportion of unaccented
syllables. These devices are employed
to give a vivid impression of the speed
and confusion incidental to the begin-
ning of a long railway journey.
The paragraph starts with a dactyl:
this is followed by an amphibrach, and
this by an iambus; three trochees are
next used, and then another dactyl. On
a cursory reading these opening phrases
might be considered a mere jumble;
but what to the uninitiated seems to be
a jumble is to the truly poetic mind a
fine example of forceful heterogeneity'
of rhythm. Contrast, for example, the
quick movement expressed in the word
Saturday (the busy day) with the slower
movement denoted by the word Sunday
(the day of quiet). But even Sunday
does not suggest such peacefulness as
Sabbath would have done. The secular
word Sunday is very appropriately used
here as the employment of labour is
entailed.
In the phrase long distance journey
we have an excellent example of the
wonderful effect of onomatopoeia. The
idea of a long distance journey is indi-
cated very forcibly by the sound, for
“the words move slow" on account of
the accumulation of consonants—eleven
consonants to eight vowels. Note also
the careful choice of the long word
destimation used in connection with a
long distance journey, and, in contrast
with this, note the sharp sound in
reached and the shortness of the word,
suggesting the sudden stopping of the
train.
Throughout the paragraph one cannot
fail to hear the short sharp sounds of
the engine expressed by the sounds ch
and j (reached, journey), as well as the
large number of sibilants, as in passen-
gers, commencing, distance, Saturday,
Sunday, destination, etc., etc.
Following day. By the second day
the rhythmical motion has produced a
somnolent effect; this is finely expressed
by the use of the liquid l and the lulla-
by sound of the word day.
Recommended to consult. The time
now quickens at the hopeful outlook
expressed in this phrase; but when one
comes to “the detailed tables” one is
compelled by the accumulation of similar
consonants (two d's, two t's, and two l’s)
to read the words slowly and so feel the
labour of consulting time - tables in
detail. - -
To prevent monotony the rhythm has
been varied; but now the poet returns
exactly to the metre used in the opening
sentence. This is very skilfully worked
in, and without careful perusal one would
be at a loss to understand why the words
covering the whole of the route produce
upon the reader such a remarkable
effect. The repetition is of the very
essence of the poetry of motion. Em-
ploying the usual dum and di to express
a long and a short syllable respectively,
we find that corering the whole of the
route and Passengers commencing a long

. . . are both of the form dum di di di

It is quite impossible to point out all
the beauties of this exquisite poem, but
we cannot leave the subject without a
reference to two or three other points of
interest.
It will be noticed that rhyme, the
most humble of the expedients employed
for the creation of musical beauty, is
almost discarded by the author, as it is
by many other great poets, but that of
the more refined and subtle aid of
assonance he gives us a fine example in
the words journey and service, and of
alliteration in the words detailed, tables,
AT THE PLAY.
The SCHOOL FOR ScANDAL.
The public is greatly indebted to Mr.
TREE, and he, in turn, to Mr. PERCY
MACQUoid, for a revival most exquisite in
every detail of scenery and costume.
The company, too, was a veritable galaxy
of stars, though the magnitude of some
of them seemed to be unfavourably
affected by an atmosphere to which they
could not perfectly accommodate them-
selves. Mr. LORAINE, in particular, while
he did sufficient justice to the breeziness
and generous bonhomie of Charles Sur-
face, had really stepped into the picture
in the manners of the time; but Miss
SUZANNE SHELLON's Mrs. Camdour was
a delightfully robust perſormance, and
her own spontaneous humour was a
very attractive enlargement upon SHERI-
DAN's wit.
Mr. TREE as Sir Peter was admirable,
more especially in his confidential solilo-
quies; and Mr. BASIL GILL, if he bore
no facial resemblance to the ideal Joseph,
acted with greater subtlety than one
might have expected. Mr. LIONEL BROUGH
was a masterly Moses, and Mr. HENRY
NEVILLE gave the right measure of
rotundity to his interpretation of Sir
Oliver. Mr. Edward TERRY, as Crabtree,
train, days, etc. And what
glorious music in the succession
of a's in these same four words !
In some portions of this selec-
tion the author must certainly
rank with the greatest masters of
our noble language. Compare,
for example, the phrase, “To
be , reached till the following
day,” with TENNYSON’s “That he
shouts with his sister at play.”
And, again, compare “Often
differs from that on week days."
with the line of SHAKSPEARE,
“Gaoler, look to him—tell not
me of (mercy),” or the late
Laureate’s “Guinevere and in
her his one deſlight).”

For general fatuousness the

From the Supplement to The Schoolmistress we extract
the following questions set by the Board of Education in an
English Language Paper in the Preliminary Examination for
the certificate:
“A traveller in Africa saw two animals which he took to be young
lions running towards him. His negro servants ran away in fright,
while he shot both the animals—a feat with which he was pleased.
Immediately afterwards, however, a white man came out of the neigh-
bouring wood and remonstrated with him, explaining that the animals
were not lions but dogs brought at great expense from England. The
traveller was much abashed and apologised for his mistake.
Tell the above story again in your own words so as to make it as
ãº. and interesting as you can. Make the two men talk to each
other.'
We sincerely trust that no young girl among the candidates
was capable of so much as imagining the probable language
of the owner of the dogs. -

THE STANDING GRIEVANCE.
I HAVE heard the question discussed
from every side—including the inside
and outside. Perhaps this is why I
have never been able to make up my
mind. My wife is a Suffragette. My
wife's mother is a Suffragist. My mother
is an Anti-Suffragette. My sister—who
considers that the proper moment has
not yet arrived—might best be described
as an Anti-Suffrage-As-Yet. The views
of my daughter are totally incapable of
description, though she is perhaps the
most earnest of them all.
“Why don't you consider women as
they are, and not as you think they
might be if they became different to
what they are,” said my wife.
“Because,” I replied, “you want to
become different to what you are, and if
you did become different it would be
foolish to consider you as you were
before you did.” - - -
“What I mean,” she said, “is this.
Take the general conduct of women
through any series of every-day events,
and, if that conduct is satisfactory,
apply it to events on a larger scale in
the government of nations.”
This struck me as being reasonable,
and I ruled two columns in my note-
book and headed them “Pros,” and
“Cons.” respectively. As I raced down
the hill to catch my “Circle” train to ||
the City it struck me that I would put
the idea into practice on my journey.
I reached the booking-office in a
dancing hurry. There were exactly
twenty seconds before my train was due
in. The lady in situ waited till she
had received her ticket, and then com-
menced the necessary sequence of events
that leads to the production of a purse.
A statesman should always be pre-
pared—even for an emergency. The
expected appearance of a railway-ticket
on the slab could not truthfully be called
an emergency, so I entered a mark in the
“Cons.” column. - -
My heart smote me as I watched her
take her purse out of her reticule and
open the inmost compartment. She was
really rather pretty. I entered a mark
on the “Pro” side, because carefulness
about money is an excellent quality in
people who prepare the Budget.
Having looked inside the purse she
inquired the price of the ticket. The
answer to this question necessitated the
return of the purse to the reticule and a
search for a pocket in an underskirt.
After a short but determined struggle
she produced a second purse, which
proved equal to the financial strain.
While the clerk was counting out her
change I entered a second mark in the
“Cons.” column. I don't know in
what category this mark should be
laced, but I heard my train in the
distance and moistened the tip of my
pencil before I wrote with it. -
Having obtained my ticket I made a
dash for the barrier, and was again held
up while she made careful inquiries as
to her destination. While the ticket
collector was informing her for the
third time that any train going to the
left would take her to the Mansion
House, 1 made a second entry on the
Credit side. This was rather noble of
me, but I felt she deserved one for such
a display of caution. Excellent quality
in a young Minister of State.
The five additional points which I then
entered on the Debit side I afterwards
crossed out. I felt that my personal
feelings should not enter into the matter,
and, after all, trains are very frequent on
that line. I spent the time in drawing
a more elaborate scheme of marks and
remarks. This is how it runs :— -
Pros. Cons.
Brought forward 2 2
On her asking me if the next .*
train was right for the Mansion
House. -
This showed a healthy
mistrust for officialdom and
a pleasing repetition of her
caution. --

question directly afterwards. .
(I haven't invented this—
there really was a porter.)
Over-caution—bad. 1
On her asking the conductor of
the train the same question.
Persistency. - 1
On her entering a smoking
compartment in frantic haste. -
Lack of perception. - 1
Lack of presence of mind. 1
On her attempting to leave it
after the train had started.
Willingness to acknow-
ledge errors. 1
On the conductor calling, “All .

she changed there for the Man-
sion House. . . . .
Useful heckling gift for
member of Opposition. 3
(This occurred at South
Kensington on one of the
surviving semi-circle trains.)

On her attempting to leave it

It was my last entry—about a Member
retaining a seat while another person
was standing for it—that made my wife
think I hadn't treated the matter
seriously. She said that only a woman
could apply the test with absolute
impartiality. I am inclined, as they
never give up their seats to other women,
to agree with her.

NARROW ESCAPES.
It appears from his recently published
biography that Mr. BRANSBY WILLIAMs,
the well-known music-hall artist, was
originally intended by his parents to
become a missionary. -
It would be a great mistake, however,
to suppose that this is an - isolated
case of the abandonment of one career
for another of a diametrically opposed
character. As a matter of fact the
annals of contemporary life teem with
analogous cases of conversion. -
Mr. RUFUs ISAACs not only wished to
become a sailor, but actually went to
sea before the jury mast. He was
eventually called to the harbour bar,
with results that are familiar to all our
readers.
The late Sir HENRY IRVING as a boy
cherished the ambition of being, an
engine-driver. He ultimately adopted
the career of an actor, but found conso-
lation for the change in a close friend-
ship with his faithful STOKER. .
The parents of Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN
were bent on his entering the political
arena, and confidently looked forward to
his one day becoming Prime Minister.
“After all,” as the Bard wittily puts it,
“I only missed it by one letter. Instead
of being P.M., I am P.L.”
Mr. Non MAN McKINNEL justified his
Christian name in early youth by his
first-rate fighting qualities, and had
already challenged FITZSIMMONs when
the success of “Pompadour Jim" on the

boards induced him to abandon pugilism
for histrionics. But to this day he
prefers a strong, repellent, aggressive
part to one of a pacifist character.
Mr. HAYDEN CoFFIN was within an ace
of becoming an archbishop—if he had
adhered to his original intention of
entering the Church. But on its being
pointed out to him that his name would
be worth a fortune in musical comedy,
to say nothing of his golden voice and
priceless deportment, he reconsidered
his verdict. Yet to this day his ascetic
features and rapt gaze often cause him
to be mistaken for an archdeacon.
FRANCHISE FETTLEMENTS.
THE “Woman's Freedomleague Fancy
Fair” has offered a prize for the best
Suffragette blouse for practical wear,
and Mr. Punch's modiste has entered the
competition with the following design
for a complete costume:–
Beehive hat in purple green and
white straw, with long plume standing
erect in front to tickle the constable's
cheeks and reduce him to a state of
hysterical collapse. Sterner measures
indicated by 14-inch hat-pins, which
are also specially designed to keep the
headgear straight in the subsequent
rough-and-tumble, and ensure a more
dignified snapshot of the “Cause in
Action' for the various Press cameras.
Blouse made of specially prepared
oiled silk guaranteed to slip through
the arms of the law. Cuffs and revers
daintily edged with barbed wire in the
latest shades, waistband and shoulder-
straps to match. All fastenings made
doubly secure by pins, the points un-
covered to taste. The blouse should be
made without a yoke, which must not
be worn under any circumstances.
Skirt of stout grey gaberdine, war-
ranted not to tear or catch on the tops
of iron palings round public men's
front gardens and statues. This gar-
ment, which is close and clinging, is
provided with a patch pocket large
enough to hold megaphone and dog-
whip.
Chiffon boa two yards long, conceal-
ing along its length a slender steel
chain with padlock attached.
Footwear, stout nature-form shoes with
broad welts and spiked soles.
Hose, blue.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The RE is something rather melodramatic about the condi-
tions of the agreement between the two rivals which gives
its name to Mr. Ridgwell, CULLUM's novel, The Compact
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), but it is difficult to conceive anything
too melodramatic for the country and the time in which the
story is placed. As Mr. CULLUM suggests in a useful “Intro:
duction,” recent events in South Africa have largely obscured
our recollection of those which preceded them, and it is
scarcely realised that during the years following Majuba the
land was a paradise for freebooters. He reproduces this
atmosphere of lawlessness, with cross wind-currents of
political scheming–BIs MARCK and CECIL RHODES, GLAISTONE,
Lord DERRY, and W. E. FoſtSTEIt all T-
it. The Baroness has a friendly way with her, the sort of
way that THACKERAY had, and TROLLope and our own beloved
DU MAURIER. If she wants to make you love her characters
she manages to do it. They are all real people, and they
talk and act as such. Still, Tommy Kingsmead having in
Chapter I. started to walk from the station and not having
met with or been overtaken by any vehicle on his way, ought
not to have been allowed to arrive at the courtyard in a cart
in Chapter II.
If you have seen that play of newspaper life, The Earth,
at the Kingsway, then you had better read Mr. Oliveſ. ONIONs'
story of newspaper life, Little Deril Doubt (MURRAy); the
novel, at any rate, carries conviction in every detail. Mr.
ONIONS does not introduce us to the daily with the circulation
of two millions, but to the companion magazines which thrive
contributing; and this makes his
book so exceptionally readable that
I am quite willing to accept the
stagy situations which are intro-
duced to round up the facts for
popular consumption.

the Band's badge, using the Band's

ing a week to making The Billion
better known. Though many
joined, it was believed that the
editor was the only man who in-
variably saluted his friends with
the Billion grip. “Chiyilies and
Match Tricks were edited by an
Imperialist called Israels.” For

his fathers, to old Bath-Tub Lansing, manufacturer. Mr.
Lansing is rich, for there is something about his bath-tubs
which makes them indispensable to every properly regu-
lated household. He is a kind, unassuming, uneducated
old gentleman with a kind old wife to match him, and he has
an Oxford son, handsome as Apollo and a friend of Tommy
Kingsmead. Also he has a daughter Inez, less agreeable,
because she is more of a snob than her parents or her Greek
god of a brother. Tommy, being a good little chap, comes to
stay with this family in his own ancestral mansion in order
to give them a lift with the stiff idiots who compose society
round about Kingsmead. This is the basis of the story
which the Baroness voN HurtLN tells in Kingsmead (Hutchin-
SoN). In an amusing preface she apologises for various
chronological inconsistencies which may trouble those who
have read her earlier work and who now read this book.
Some of her characters will be found to have grown up
too soon in Kingsmead, particularly Pam, whom we all
remember. Well, I own I don't mind much, for I thoroughly
enjoyed the reading of her new book, and I heartily recommend
it excellent reading.
When a gentleman sues for a lady's hand, it is not usual,
I believe, for him to inform his beloved that, though he
adores her, he rather prefers the society of a male friend.
Nor is it usual, I fancy, for the lady to accept him on such
terms; or to answer, like the heroine in Mr. John BARNETT's
new novel, Geoffrey Cheriton (SMITH, ELDER), “I used to fancy
that the second place was impossible to me. But it isn't—
it isn't! I'm really very proud to take it.” However
that may be, if the heroine does not mind playing second
fiddle, I see no particular cause for the reader to cavil at
the improbability of an uncommonly well-written novel.
The best of the book is the everyday life in a City office,
with all its petty meannesses, its jealousies, rivalries,
and hopeless outlook: that at least rings true in every
note. For the rest, the gentleman whose friendship
ranked higher than the love of the lady does not move
me. He is a kind of inferior Steerforth, and of such persons
one may easily have more than enough, in real life and in
fiction. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DETACHMENT OF PRENDERBY.
The NAVY QUESTION AGAIN.
“WELL,” I said–for I had made my peace with Prenderby
—“you’re to have your eight Dreadnoughts after all.”
“Who told you so?” he asked.
“A little bird put it into a paper the other Sunday,” I said.
“I like to hear these things direct from headquarters,”
said Prenderby, “and I hear nothing. Asquiſii may be
wanting to save his own face; but in the meantime what
about the speaking countenance of your little bird * From the
PREMIER's last Scotch speech I gathered that he thought it wilful
waste to build more Dreadnoughts when you never could tell
but what at any moment somebody might invent a Dread-
nothing-not-eren a-Dreadnought, and leave us choked up with
a lot of hulks only fit for scrapping.”
“But,” I protested, “wasn't something of the same kind
said at Cardiff by Lord RosBBERY 2 and you wouldn't call him
a Little-fleeter. He told us that before he joined the popular
clamour for more ships he would want to know what was
going on in the brooding brain of our Naval Constructor.”
“I was there myself,” said Prenderby; “and I make
allowances for his lordship. He had to talk from a landing
half-way up a staircase, and this was uncomfortable. Besides,
he was speaking in praise of a great past-master of the
art of Naval Construction, and one of his successors, Sir
Philip WATTs, was present to do honour to the memory of his
old teacher. I have never yet, in a long acquaintance,
dissected Sir Philip's brooding brain, but I am certain of one
thing that is always going on inside it. I know that he
knows that in every ship he turns out there is the seed of
obsolescence. Being an honest man, he doesn't plant it there
on purpose; but all the same his cecupation would be gone
without it. Even if, in a moment of pardonable pride, he so
far forgot himself as to address the latest of his monstrous
inventions as follows:– O Insuperable, live for ever!’ it
would be his business to start brooding again at once with
the idea of making it obsolete as soon as might be.”
“But supposing,” I suggested, “that he already sees his
way, by brooding for another paltry eighteen months or so,
to invent a type that will reduce all previous types to the
relative fighting capacity of a trim-built wherry, would you
have the Government go on building four extra Dreadnoughts,
well knowing that they would be obsolete by 1914 °"
“Oblige me,” said Prenderby, “by confining your atten-
tion to the year 1912. We are strong enough to-day (as the
Radicals assure us), and we might, if certain things happened
and other things didn't, be strong enough in 1914; but
kindly fix your brooding eye on the danger zone of 1912.
If in that year we are beaten by Germany * x
“Would it not,” I interrupted, “be more discreet to speak
of the forces of ‘The Empress of the North,’ as in An
Englishman's Home 2"
“Never allude to that play again in my presence, if you
please,” said Prenderby. “The lack of decency and
patriotism shown by those responsible for the exposure of
our soiled linen on a Berlin stage fills me with unspeakable
shame and disgust. But to resume. If in 1912 we are
beaten by Germany (and please don't call me a coward
because I happen to have a little imagination) will you
derive any solace from the reflection that both sides were
fighting with obsolete ships, and that we failed because,
in our wisdom and foresight, we refused to build enough of
the m 2 ''
“But the Government,” I urged, “are building one
quartet; it is only the other quartet that they are doubtful
about.”
“But why build any at all, if their probable obsolescence
is the objection ? And how should the second four be more
tainted in this respect than the first 2"
“Can't you understand,” I said rather petulantly, “that it
is waste of good money to build superfluous Dreadnoughts
when the Government have got wind of something better
that will revolutionise naval warfare in 1914 : " .
“That,” said Prenderby bitterly, “should make a noble
spectacle for our invaders in 1912. Fifty pfennigs entrance
to see the British Super-Dreadnought (1914 pattern) on the
stocks. By the way, I rath r wonder that some of those Radical
papers which have been sniffing at the nation’s “cowardice’
in the present Navy ‘scare’ should tolerate this idea of
designing a Super-Dreadnought. Does it not argue panic?
Is it quite consonant with the spirit of Nelson's day that
they should cravenly desire to best the enemy's ships in
the matter of quality, if not of quantity?”
“I take it,” I said, “that you persist in your unreason;
that you go one better than Wordsworth's stubborn little
maid in “We are Seven '2'' . . . . . . .
“I am for the whole eight unconditionally, if that is what
your humour means. I should think very little of the
captain of a Varsity boat if, on the day of the race, he were to
say, ‘We shall start with four men, anyhow ; and pick up
the other four at Hammersmith, if we find that we
want ‘em.” a -
“You remind me,” I said, “of the Westminster cartoon
—the ‘Unionist parrot' that keeps on screaming ‘Dread-
noughts!’” - . . . . . . . .
“I am no Unionist,” said Prenderby, always irritated by any
suggestion that his views have a party bias; “and, besides,
the Unionists haven't got a parrot of their own, unless they
have taken over the only established parrot, the one belonging
to the other side—I mean the bird that persisted in saying
‘Your food will cost you more.’ By the way, the bird was
right. Our food is costing us more. Possibly that was
why the Free Fooders got rid of their parrot, lest he
should go on adding to the many truths that are uttered by
inadvertence.”
“Talking of food,” I said, “did you read Lord MILNER's
speech at Nottingham and his defence of a Preferential
policy 2"
“I never read party speeches on such economic questions,
as I desire to preserve an open mind. My studies in Prefer-
ence and Tariff Reform have only extended over four or five
years, and my judgment is therefore still unformed. But
that part of his speech which dealt with purely patriotic
themes seemed to me to rank among the great utterances of
the hour. - - --
“Lord MILNER grows in mental breadth. There was a time
when I thought him narrowed by personal prejudice, and too
bitter about the Boers. But his outlook has widened. I
should have little fear for the construction of the next
Government if it might include another Mil NER or two.”
“Well, my Westminster Gazette doesn't seem to think
much of him,” I said. - -
“I am aware of that,” said Prenderby. “I observed its
comments on the patriotic portion of his speech, and I found
them petty and partisan—unworthy of a great paper. It
looks as if the Government, of which the Westminster is
the evening mouthpiece, cannot pardon Lord MILNER for
having been publicly censured by them. . We forgive those
who have wronged us, not those whom we have wronged.”
“But you forgave me the other week,” I said.
“Because it was I who was wronged,” said he.
And on this conciliatory note we parted.

Joan. “HE'ſ trili. ME NOT TO BE sucit A Fool.”
I wish There was A MAN heme."
THE BUILDERS.
I.
Mrs. Thrush. What do you think of
that hawthorn?
Mr. Thrush. Oh, no, my dear, no;
much too isolated, it would attract atten-
tion at once. I can see the boys on a
Sunday afternoon. “Hallo, there's a
tree that 's bound to have a nest in it.”
And then where are you? You know
what boys are on a Sunday afternoon?
You remember that from last year, when
we lost the finest clutch of eggs in the
county.
Mrs. Thrush. Stop, stop, dear, I can't
bear it. Why do you remind me of it?
And as for Sunday afternoons they
never ought to have been invented.
Mr. Thrush. There, there, composeyour-
self, my pretty. What other suggestions
have you?
Mrs. Thrush. One of the laurels, then,
in the shrubbery at the Great House.
Mr. Thrush. Much better. But the
trouble there is the cat.
Mrs. Thrush. Oh dear, I wish you'd
find a place for me; I assure you (blush-
ing) it's time.
Mr. Thrush. Well, my notion, as I
have said all along, is that there 's
nothing to beat the very middle of a
big bramble. I don't mind whether it's
in the hedge or whether it's on the
common. But it must be the very
middle. It doesn't matter very much
then whether it's seen or not, because no
one can reach it.
Mrs. Thrush. Very well then, be it
so; but do hurry with the building,
there's a dear.
II.
Mr. Tree-Creeper. I've had the most
extraordinary luck. Listen. You know
that farmhouse by the pond. Well,
there's a cow-shed with a door that
won't shut, and even if it would it's
got a hole in it, and in the roof, at the
very top, there's a hollow. It's the
most perfect place you ever saw, be-
cause, even if the farmer twigged us,
he couldn't get at the nest without
pulling off a lot of tiles. Do you see?
Mrs. Tree-Creeper. It sounds perfect.
Mr. Tree-Creeper. Yes, but it's no use
waiting here. We must collar it at once.
There were a lot of prying birds all
about when I was there, and I noticed
a particularly nosy flycatcher watching
me all the time. Come along quick;
and you'd better bring a piece of hay
with you to look like business.
III.
Mr. Wren. Well, darling, what shall
it be this year—one of those boxes at
“The Firs,” or the letter-box at “Meadow
View,” where the open-air journalist
lives, or shall we build for ourselves
like honest wrens?
Mrs. Wren. I leave it to you, dearest.
Just as you wish.
Mr. Wren. No, I want your help. I'll
just give you the pros and cons.
Mrs. Wren. Yes, dear, do; you're so
clear-headed.
Mr. Wren. Listen then. If we use
the nest-box there's nothing to do, no
fag of building, but we have to put up
with visitors peeping in every day and
pawing the eggs or the kids about. If
we use the letter-box we shall have to
line it, and there will be some of the
same human fussiness to endure; but, on
the other hand, we shall become famous
—we shall get into the papers. Don't
you see the heading, “IRemarkable Nest
in Surrey”? And then it will go on, “A
pair of wrens have chosen a strange
abode in which to rear their little fluffy
brood—" and so forth.

Mrs. Wren. That's rather delightful,
all the same. “ -
Mr. Wren. Finally, there is the nest
which we build ourselves, running just
the ordinary risks cf boys and orni-
thologists, but feeling at any rate that
we are independent. What do you
say ?
Mrs. Wren. Well, dearest, I think I
say the last. -
Mr. Wren. Good. Spoken like a
brave hen. Then let's look about for
a site at once.
IV. -
Mr. Swallow. I’ve looked at every
house with decent eaves in the whole
place until I'm ready to drop.
Mrs. Swallow. What do you think
about it? -
Mr. Swallow. Well, it's a puzzle.
There's the Manor House: I began with
that. There is good holding there, but
the pond is a long way off, and carrying
mud so far would be a fearful grind.
None the less it's a well-built house,
and I feel sure we shouldn't be dis-
turbed.
Mrs. Swallow. What about the people?
Mr. Swallow. How funny you are
about the people always' Never mind.
All I can find out is that there's the
squire and his wife and a companion.
Mrs. Swallow. No children 2
Mr. Swallow. None.
Mrs. Swallow. Then I don't care for
the Manor House. Tell me of another.
Mr. Swallow. This is the merest senti-
ment; but no mater. The Vicarage
next. - -
Mrs. Swallow. Any children there?
Mr. Swallow. No, but it's much nearer
the pond. -
Mrs. Swallow. And the next? -
Mr. Swallow. The farmhouse. A
beautiful place with a pond at your very
door. Everything you require, and lots
of company. Good sheltered eaves, too.
Mrs. Swallow. Any children?
Mr. Swallow. Yes, one little girl.
Mrs. Swallow. Isn't there any house
with babies?
Mr. Swallow. Only one that could
possibly be any use to us; but it's a
miserably poor place. No style.
Mrs. Swallow. How many babies?
Mr. Swallow. Twins, just born, and
others of one and two and three.
Mrs. Swallow. We'll build there.
Mr. Swallow. They 'll make a horrible
row all night.
Mrs. Swallow. We'll build there.

A TRIFLE OFF.
“HALL0,” said Miss Middleton, as we
met suddenly in the Park, “how are
you?” She held out her hand.
“Very pale,” I answered, as I grasped
her wrist; “very pale and thin.” I
took out my watch. “Will you say
Go!' when you're ready ?” .
“I don't know what the game is, but
I'm always ready. Go!”
“. . . Ten, eleven, twelve,” I finished
up. “Now, in the same time mine does
thirteen and a touch.” I put my watch
hack and let go of her wrist. “That
shows you.” -
Miss Middleton looked anxiously at
me. “Aren't you very well ?” she asked.
“Of course I'm not,” I said peevishly.
“That's what I’ve been trying to ex-
plain all this time. I'm very ill. My
pulse is–well, you saw just now. I've
no business to be in London at all. I
ought really to be at Brighton, lapping
up ozone.” -
“Oh, what's the matter?”
“Influenza,” I muttered gloomily.
“Oh, I'm so sorry. Have you taken
anything for it?” - -
I turned excitedly to her. -
“Have I tak— I say, you aren't
trying to be brisk, are you ? You know
nobody appreciates brisk humour or
intellectual badinage more than I do—
when I'm feeling well. But there are
times, and this is one of them—there are
* x
emphatically times——
“What have I done?” cried Miss
Middleton in dismay. “I simply
said ——” -
“You simply said, had I taken any-
thing for it? Have you ever had
influenza 2 " . -
“I expect so.”
“If you can't remember it better
than that, you haven't. Well, anyhow,
there are two ways of taking it; one is
lying down, and the other is sitting up.
I took mine sitting up.”
“What does that mean 2''
“Why, that I went home and fought
it, Madam. Wrestled with it. Drowned
it. Great Barlow, the things I drowned
it with !”
“Tell me,” said Miss Middleton.
“I can only remember some of them.
One's memory gocs with influenza, and
they mixed the things up so. Let us
sit down here for a little while.”
We took two green chairs, and I
leaned back and closed my eyes.
“There was somebody's Lung lotion,”
I began dreamily, “very thick and
black and beastly, and somebody's Tonic
Port, very thin and red and beastly, and
they came together every three hours.
And there was somebody's Eucalyptus
on a lump of sugar, and somebody's
lozenges, and somebody's jujubes. And
a cough mixture. And a gargle. And
there was something to bathe the eyes
with. And there was a wash for giving
the coats of spaniels a glossy appear-
ance, and a spray for removing green-
fly from rose-trees . . . And I drank
them all.” - -
There was an impressive stillness
after this. Then said Miss Middleton:
“You don't look very—er—glossy.
Can't you get the money back 2''.
“I don't feel very glossy,” I said.
There was another impressive silence.
I began to fumble in my waistcoat
pocket. - . .:
“This is really my gargling time,” I
began, “but I have here a tablet which
is said to be equally efficacious. You
will forgive me for not offering one to
you,” I went on as I held it between
i. finger and thumb, “but this is the
ast.”
“What a curious thing,” faid Miss
Middleton. “It looks just like the tip
of a billiard cue.”
“Hang it, it is the top of a billiard
cue,” I said, as I looked at it more closely.
“Thank you.” I threw it away in dis-
gust. “But it would probably have
done me a lot of good,” I added. “The
great thing with influenza is to keep on.
On and on until you gradually wear it
away. Have you a teaspoon with you?”
“There!” cried Miss Middleton. “All
the time I was putting on my hat I kept
saying to myself, Now don't forget
a teaspoon this time. And I knew I
should.” - -
“Very brisk,” I said appreciatively.
“Very brisk and airy. But I really
want a tablespoon too.”
I took a bottle out of my coat pocket.
“We’re right out of tablespoons,”
said Miss Middleton. “To tell you the
truth, Sir, there's really no demand for
them nowadays.” -
“There is a demand,” I said crossly.
“I’ve got to take a te spoonful of this
in a tablespoonful of water. Here's the
water,” I added, as I took out a flask
from another pocket.
“You 'd better drink from the bottle,
and I'll say ‘Woa' when I think
you've had a teaspoon's worth. And
you can have as much water as you like
afterwards . . . Woa ! Better?”
“Much. That 's done me a lot of
good. By Horsley !” I cried, “I feel a
new man. I’m ready for anything.”
“You wouldn't like to take me back
this afternoon and play a little cricket
with me, and stay to dinner, I sup-
pose ?”
“Like it?” I shouted. “I should
love it.” I jumped up and began to
make drives with my umbrella. “There
you are – four all the way. And there's
my cover shot. And there——”
I suddenly felt very hot and unhappy.
I sat down again and shut my eyes.
“It's no good,” I said. - .

“I'm all right,” I said grumpily.
“As a matter of fact I was playing
cricket only last night.”
“A dream 2" said Miss Middleton.
“Do tell me. I love dreams.”
“I went on to bowl. It's a funny
thing—I've dreamed about cricket every
night for the last week, but last night

ignoring her. “Jove, I remember every

“Hooray!”
“You were looking on—in fact you
were the only one. I'd been fielding
next to you in the deep, and, when I
took that wicket I thought, ‘Now she'll
admit that I can bowl.' Then I sent
down another wide, and then the man
gave an easy chance to cover, which was
missed. I don't know if you know that
ball of mine which swerves across and

“Yes, yes,” said Miss Middleton
eagerly. “Was I still there?” -
“Well, then I bowled another wide,

“Oh, I was a beast !” said Miss
Midddleton remorsefully. “I'm so

(Little Arthur, aged 12; Mamma, aged 41.)
Little Arthur. Mamma, why are you giving a dinner-party
to-morrow 2
Mamma. Oh, one must show a certain amount of hospi-
tality, you know, Arthur. People show us hospitality, and
we mustn't be backward in making a return. Besides, we
like to have our friends round us occasionally, just for the
pleasure of meeting them.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, I see. But are they all friends?
Mamma. Of course they are. Why do you ask?
L. A. Oh, I don't know, Mamma; but when you told Papa
that Mr. and Mrs. Tadworthy were coming he said— I
don't like to say what he said, but you know, Mamma.
Mamma. No, I don't think he said that, Arthur.
L. A. Said what, Mamma 2
Mamma. What you said he said.
L. A. But I didn't say it, Mamma.
Mamma. Well, never mind. Your father may have been
hasty, or probably you misunderstood him. -
L. A. No, Mamma, I heard him quite plainly, and I'm
sure Papa wasn't at all pleased. I know quite well when
Papa isn't pleased. -
Mamma. Well, we won't discuss that any more.
L. A. No, Mamma. But when you and Papa give a dinner-
party, don't both of you send the invitations? I've seen the
cards, and they say, “Mr. and Mrs. Elton request.” That
means both of you, doesn't it? -
Mamma. Yes. What then 2
L. A. But if Papa invited Mr. and Mrs. Tadworthy, why
was he so angry when you told him they were coming 2
Mamma. I’ve told you not to discuss that any more.
L. A. No, Mamma, I won't discuss it because I know he
was angry. I only want to know why he was angry. Aren't
Mr. and Mrs. Tadworthy friends of Papa?
Mamma. Well, perhaps not friends exactly—“business
acquaintances” would be the better term.
L. A. I see, Mamma; but they can't be business acquaint-
ances of yours, Mamma, can they, because you’ve no busi-
ness, have you? Are they friends of yours, Mamma”
Mamma. Yes, of course, in a way they are.
L. A. But is that quite right, Mamma 2

L. A. Is it quite right for you to have friends who are not

L. A. Yes, Mamma, but not for another quarter of an
hour. She's to call out when she's ready. Mamma!
Mamma. Yes, dear.
L. A. Ought you to have friends who are not Papa's
friends?
Mamma. Well, they're not really friends in that way. We
know one another, and they’re very honourable people who
have made their way by their own exertions, and I’m sure
we ought to respect them for it.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, I think so too.
to think so, did he?
Mamma. I’ve told you before you mustn't take everything
your father says quite literally. He likes his joke some-
times.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, and I like Papa's jokes too when I
understand them; but when you told him about the Tad-
worthys he only said one word, you know, and it wasn't a
joky word at all, so you see I had to take it literally, hadn't I,
amma 2 But I say, Mamma.
Mamma. Well, what is it now 2
But Papa didn't seem
L. A. You said just now that all the people who were
coming to the dinner were your friends.
Mamma. Did I say that? -
L. A. Yes, Mamma, you said that, and I think you meant
it.
Mamma. Why shouldn't I? I mean, of course I did.
L. A. And then, Mamma, you told me the Tadworthy's
were not friends of Papa's, and you went on to say they were
not really friends of yours, but they were very honourable
people. But if they’re not friends why did you invite
them 2
Mamma. You're too young to understand these
I've often told you. -
L. A. Yes, Mamma, I'm afraid I am ; but you and Papa
always tell me to speak up freely and not to mind asking
questions.
Mamma. Yes, yes, I know; but sometimes you ask a great
many.
L. A. Yes, Mamma; but if they're not friends, you know,
the dinner-party won't be as pleasant as it ought to be, will
it? You won't like it as much as you would if the Tad-

BEAUTY IN BUSINESS.
[From the records of the “Social Circle,” a club founded in Hamp-
stead over three years ago for the purpose of bringing lonely, eligible
Londoners together, it appears that, while millionaires and Government
officials with the certainty of pensions stand high on the list of men
whom women want to marry, poets are the least popular.]
O BARD, do you sigh for a face that is fair,
And are you so sombre and doleful
Because you are filled with desire for a pair
Of eyes that are azure and soulful?
If Beauty's your quarry away with your verse!
By poetry hope not to win her,
The lady will think of the state of your purse
And what you can give her for dinner.
Then seek not to soar on poetical wings—
Your genuine Beauty refuses
Chill teetotal draughts from Castalian springs
And grass from the mount of the Muses.
She wants to be lodged in an elegant way,
She means to be suitably boarded–
In short, you will find her, I'm sorry to say,
Commercially minded and sordid.
No doubt she will smile at your figures and tropes,
At your flowers all a-blowing and growing,
But do not on that base extravagant hopes—
She knows that her teeth are worth showing.
The questions that really concern her will be:
Pray, how, when, and whence will the tin come?
She won't miss her motors and sables, not she'
For a paltry poetical income.
Then dip not your pen in Pierian ink;
Keep all your available vigour
For companies, corners—whatever you think
Will swell up your pile a bit bigger.
Or, if this be too much for the brains you possess,
Poor poet, pray turn your attention
To Government billets. The girl may say “Yes”
If you offer a passable pension.

MUSICAL NOTES.
The announcement that Signor
CARU’so's sovereignty is to be challenged
by a new tenor of the name of CARASA,
and the fact that Signor TAMINI aspires
to the laurels of the late Signor TAMAGNo,
are by no means the most remarkable
instances of romantic coincidence in the
annals of musical nomenclature.
Thus intense interest is excited by the
impending arrival of Madame Blara Cutt,
a vocalist of such Patagonian proportions
that, in the words of KEATS,
“By her in stature the tall Amazon
Had stood a pygmy's growth.” -**
Madame. Cutt, who is marrietºhat
extraordinarily handsome and gifted
tenor, Mr. Cummerley Bundford, is the
happy mother of a delightful little
daughter, who is §". known in
the profession as the “Cuttlet.”
Great and ebullient interest has been
excited by the imminent advent of the
far-famed Italian prima donna, Madame
Tetrarchini. This wonderful young artist
has never visited England before, but
her name has long been a household
word in the Argentine and at the Anti-
podes. Her voice, which has been aptly
compared to a blend of gold and velvet,
has never been subjected to the strain of
Wagnerian lyric drama and, having been
devoted exclusively to the interpretation
of the standard Italian operas, retains a
girlish freshness more suggestive of
eighteen than Madame's real age, which
is officially stated to be twenty-eight.
Amongst the most richly endowed
débutantes of the season is Miss Southern
Crossley, an Antipodean contralto whose
organ has the luscious richness of a
Carlsbad plum combined with the trans-
lucent purity of rock crystal.
The multiplication of new orchestras
goes on with unabated vigour. Only
the other day Mr. BEECHAM, after
severing his connection with the new
Symphony orchestra, founded a fresh
band of his own. Within the last few
weeks, however, further organizations
have sprung into vigorous life. Fore-
most in power and influence amongst
these is the Vickers and Maximphony
Orchestra, which has been founded at
Barrow, and has already attained a high
-
level of efficiency. Next we have to notice
the G. R. Simsphony Orchestra, a body
of players who in volume of chevelure
and general capillary attraction leave
little to be desired.
Considerable anxiety has been aroused
amongst chamber music players by the
announcement that an ingenious gentle-
man named Mills has" invented an
instrument, operated by electricity,
which combines the tones of the finest
string quartet. As the leader of the
Bohemian Quartet, in an interview at
Prague, puts it, windmills, though ob-
solete, are an ornament to the land-
scape, but string Mills are an intolerable
innovation which cannot be permitted.
“There is a time in the early part of each
year when the thought comes that warm coats
should be donned and petrºl tanks filled to
take the highroad and byroad, whither bound
matters little, so we may be braced by running
briskly up the lifts of the way, and blown
through and through with fresh air as the
easing levels seemingly roll back beneath the
tireless wheels of the car.”—The Morning Post.
Very pretty and all that, but we still
think that “tireless” wheels are a
mistake.

CHARIVARI,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 19.
—Admiral SMITH-Dornie N never so sur-
prised in his life. You might, as he
said, have knocked him down with a
marlingspike. The other day, being at
home with friends and neighbours at
Berkhampstead, he merely remarked
that it would be a good thing if the late
PREMIER were dug out of his grave and
hanged on the gallows tree. Has an idea
that something of the kind was once
done. CHARLEs I.--or was it CROM well ?
—was treated in that way. When he
comes to think of it, couldn't have been
CHARLEs I., as he earlier lost his head.
In such circumstances there were diffi-
culties in way of subsequent proceed-
ings; so it must have been CROMWELL.
Anyhow, it was a person moving in a
certain respectable walk of life.
Now here's the House of Commons
reassembling after Easter recess, and
instead of straightway going for the
Government in the matter of those four
extra Dreadnoughts, or on any other of
the dozen grounds upon which they might
be attacked, it turns upon him (the Ad-
miral), and wants to know what the
FIRST LORD of THE ADMIRALTY proposes to
do in the matter?
Only six questions on the paper;
FANCY Picture of MR. M-Nz-s’ LADY FRIENDs
“Is the right hon. gentleman aware that the
lady friends of Mr. Menzies are very meek and
mild—(laughter)—and of a very well-behaved
disposition ?” (loud laughter.)—Mr. Watt.
thirty-three and a
third per cent. are
devoted to this
affair. Worst of it
is, it is not only the
Radicals who affect
to be shocked. That
the Admiral could
stand. But ARTHUR
LEE, rising from |
Front Opposition ; :
Bench, wants to
know whether con-
duct of this kind is
becoming in an in-
dividual who enjoys
a pension.
Here's a pretty |
go! Admiral, called
upon for explana-
tions by FIRST LORD,
had explained it was
all a joke. Or, as he
precisely put it, it
was “in the mature
of a metaphorical
expression.” Had
he suspected for one
moment that it - -
would have at- -
tracted this embar-
rassing amount of i---
public attention he
would never have
cast his ideas of
current events into
that particular form of expression.
Undertakes to refrain from further
flashes of humour, and the House reluc-
tantly lets him go with his pension.
Business done.—LULU brings in Bill
for electoral reform of City of London.
In absence of PRINCE ARTHUR, BANBURY
intimates that City of London doesn't
want to be reformed. Very well satis-
fied with its present representation and
the methods of securing it. As for
the Bill he, as becomes a neighbour,
dropping into the French of Stratford-
atte-Bow, scornfully dismisses it as “a
reeshofay of one brought in last year.”
Tuesday.—Little been heard of late of
ALPHEUS CLEOPHAs. Time was when his
figure, standing well out on floor of
House so that it might be seen of men,
was a familiar adornment of the nightly
scene. Somehow, for one of those subtle
reasons which make studyof life here ever
fresh in interest, ALPHEUS has not caught
on with the present House. Failure not
due to lack of effort to resume and main-
tain former position. From the outset
he was coldly received; seriously
thought of changing his first Christian
name to OMEGA, by way of intimating
conviction that all was up.
To every honest citizen there comes a
time when duty calls for the sacrifice of
private modesty on the altar of public
interest.
THE GALLANT ADMIRAL who Lost his HEAD.
(This being “in the nature of a metaphorical expression.”)
Mr. McKenna does his best for that nautical orator Admiral
Smith-Dorriem.
The hour struck to-night, and
lo! ALPHEUS CLEOPHAs responded to the
summons. Bill before the House
proposes to repeal the parsimonious
enactment that limits the salary of
PRESIDENT of BoARD OF TRADE to a
pittance of £2,000 a year. In criticising
the measure DILKE suggested that,
instead of raising the salary of Ministers,
they should reduce the number seated
in the House. Whilst payment of
Members was refused, so numerous were
Ministerial offices that the cost to the
country was not much less than the
total reached elsewhere where Members
were paid. As things are, accommo-
dation could not be found on the
Treasury Bench for all the men who had
a right to be seated there.
Murmur of applause below the Gang-
way here broke in. DiLKE had evidently
touched a chord of personal conviction
strongly held and widely extended.
Perhaps it was this little wave
of enthusiasm that moved ALPHEUS
CLEOPHAs. Anyhow, there he was as
of yore, his legs astride, his face turned
upon the Treasury Bench, so that with
eagle eye he might search the counte-
mances and the consciences of Ministers.
“Curious,” he remarked, “that, at a
moment when everybody else's income
has decreased, the House is asked to
increase the salaries of Members of the

Cabinet. Before the matter is considered
the question of the payment of Members
should be dealt with. Otherwise there
will be nothing left for us.”
So depressed was ALPHEUs at this
prospect that he did not observe the
hand of the clock approaching eleven,
and was still lamenting the situation
when the debate automatically stood
adjourned. - -
Business done.—Rather negative in
its conclusions. Bill designed for
discipline of unruly strangers so riddled
in debate that PREMIER withdrew it for
further consideration. Another dealing

ALPHEUS Cleophas.

sents itself. Wonder is that it has
not earlier overtaken the House. In

introduces the first person plural.
“Who’s “we’?” asked a Member,
equally punctilious, though on other
lines, with Sam Weller's father when
question arose in court as to the method
of spelling the family name.
“We is myself,” said the Member for
North Manchester, loftily regardless of
grammar.
Of course he is—I mean they are—
quite right. JoyNSoN is “I,” and Hicks
is “I.” Joy NSON and Hicks are “we.”
ATHERLEY-Jones has long had matter
at heart. Glad to find it at last taken
up. RANDOLPH Churchill, probably at-
tracted by the circumstance that he was
himself inheritor of double-barrelled
surname, thirty years ago led the way
in direction of belittling those who
shared this distinction.
“Remarkable,” he said in one of his
earliest speeches, “how often we find
- - medioerity with a
- double-barrelled
name.”
As he spoke he
gazed pensively on
the broad back of

AMBASSADORIAL ADVENTURES.
MR. BRYCE, the British Ambassador in
the United States (so it is stated in a
daily paper), while on a visit at the house
of the President of Wisconsin University,
discovered that his boots, which in a
moment of insular aberration, he had
placed outside his door, had been cleaned
by the daughters of the house. On
learning what had happened, the great
diplomatist at once took them off, de-
claring that he would preserve them as
a souvenir of the charming way in which
he had been extricated from the embar-
rassment caused by his disregard of
American customs.
A later report, not yet published,
states that His Excellency proposes to
have the boots set up-en his drawing-
room mantelpiece at home and to grow
maidenhair ferns in them.
MR. BRYCE's next visit was to the
Governor of Oklahoma, where the Bayard
of diplomacy enjoyed a further oppor-
tunity for adding to his collection of
chivalrous keepsakes. In a moment of
inadvertence he asked for a boiled egg
for breakfast, but on learning, just as
he was in the act of cracking the shell,
that it had been prepared by his
hostess, he at once forbore to impair its
symmetry, and, wrapping it up carefully
in tissue-paper, placed it in his despatch
box as a touching souvenir of American
hospitality.
Shortly afterwards Mr. BRycE was the
guest of the Governor of Newtimberville,
where he arrived after a long bicycle
ride, completely saturated by a storm
of rain. Retiring to his room, Mr.
BRYCE thoughtlessly placed his wet clothes
on a chair outside the door, and went
through his usual course of Sandow
exercises until the humid garments had
been restored to their normal dryness.
Subsequently, at afternoon tea, it trans-
pired that the process of desiccation had
been exclusively carried out by the
Governor's talented daughter, Stan-
leyette. “Never again,” at once ex-
claimed the historian of the Holy Roman
I’mpire, “can I wear garments glorified
by so generous an act;” and retiring to
his apartment he at once removed his
clothes, and remained in bed until the
Poole of Newtimberville had provided
him with a new outfit. We understand
that Mr. BRYCE, while retaining his
dried vestments for the present, has
decided to bequeath them to the British
Museum as a concrete example of the
splendid courtesy of our lady-cousins
across the Atlantic.
No incident marked Mr. BRYCE's recent
sojourn at the palatial residence of the
{{overnor, of Pittsburg until the morn-
ing of his departure. Just before he
was starting, in a moment of oblivious-

AT THE PLAY.
“THE EARTH.”
I Don't know how many days Mr.
FAGAN took over his creation of “The
Earth,” but, once the idea came into his
head, the rest must have been easy
enough. There are practically only
three characters, and one issue. The
other persons contribute to the atmo-
sphere in which the Paper-King has his
being, but they present no minor inte-
rests or complications of their own.
Perhaps the very simplicity of the
scheme gives it its arresting force, for
the play certainly holds the attention.
It is a curious blend of realism and im-
probability. No one imagines that Sir
AN EARTHY PARADISE.
Miss LENA AsiiWELL.
Lady Killone .
Rt. Hon. Denzil Trerena
w MR ALLAN AYNEsworth
Sir Felix Janion (in background)
Mr. Non MAN McKiNNEL.
Felix Junion could have made so smug
a corner in journals without a certain
slimness and facility of conscience:
but the kind of unscrupulousness
which he shows in his treatment of
the Cabinet Minister, Trevena, has no
sort of relation to the credible. News-
papers that depend upon all classes of
society for their circulation do not, to-
day, use a woman's honour as a weapon
for political intrigues. Strangely enough,
though he had to bear this preposterous
stigma, Sir Felix was, perhaps, the most
attractive figure on the stage. This was
due in some measure to Mr. NorMAN
McKINNEL's interpretation. Though no
actor can be more admirably brutal
when he chooses, he brought to the
part a smiling imperturbability which
almost disarmed the scandalised critic.
His quiet and laconic cynicism, matched
against the fluent rhetoric of Trevena,
nearly made the worse argument appear
the better. Trevena, of course, wins in
the end because his lover threatens, at the
cost of her own public disgrace, to expose
Janion's designs; but nobody imagines
that the otherevening papers would have
had the temerity to print her confession.
The two characters were well balanced.
The villain had his touches of generosity;
the hero's fibre was weakened by a secret
shame, and even the sincerity of hi
attitude as a public philanthropist was
called in question by his apathy towards
private claims upon his charity. . i
The play was follówed with a close
attention that was a better complimelit
than applause. Even the gods of tle
gallery, who, being greedy devourers Óf
the kind of journalism exposed to
righteous contempt on the stage, might
have been expected, after the detached
manner of audiences, to join heartily in
the denunciation of a system which
they supported, were noticeably undé-
monstrative.” This may to some extent
be explained by, Mr. ALIAN AYNEsworth's
rendering of the part of Trerena; for it
was difficult to mistake his bearing for
that of an ideal “idealist,” and he
rather rushed his declamations as if he
were afraid of boring us. In the lighter
parts he was excellent, but became a
little stagey under pressure.
I wish I could speak with more en-
thusiasm of the performance of that
delightful actress Miss LENA Ashwell.
Up to the last scene, when she was
forced to rise to the occasion, she played
with indifference, and spoke often in a
harsh recitative. But she had rare
moments, illuminated by an irresistible
grace and tenderness of voice and ex-
pression. - . - --
The minor characters, most of whom
regrettably disappeared after the First
Act, were admirable, and the humour of
Mr. Poulton, as Janion's impossible
business-manager, was a most refreshing
relief. --
The moral of the play, apart from the
false picture of journalistic intrigue in
the matter of a woman's honour, is
pretty useless, because it ignores the fact
that a Newspaper Trust in the hands of
a single man is very little more dan-
gerous than a number of rival papers, iſ
all are actuated by purely commercial
motives; and because (what is more
important) it omits to trace the evil to
its root, and to remark that every nation
has the Press which it deserves; that
the choice of its journals, as of its
Governments, lies with a public which
can choose well if it wishes; since the
same people who gave The Earth. its
circulation of two millions, also gave
Trevena his chance of making laws for
the regeneration of the race. - O.S.

If I am feeling a little bitter against

he gave us the terrible old joke about

at the same time he really has written
an immensely amusing farce, to which
full justice is done by the players.

THE HIGHER HEDONISM.
[A daily paper sighs for the days when the
rarity of the bath lifted it to the rank of a cere-
mony, in which one was conducted to the bath-
room by musicians, and served with water
perfumed with flowers.]
I LovE the dear, dead days of old,
Of which historians declare
The knights were usually bold,
And baths so generally rare
That their occurrence roused in some
A joyful tendency to strum.
For then, when rumour ran around
That bathing pleased the baron's views,
Forthwith the solemn sackbut's sound
Acclaimed the interesting news,
And pipes (which never knew the
“main")
Assisted with a glad refrain.
For him the festive cymbals beat,
For him with frequent rub-a-dub
Appropriate kettle-drums would greet
The boiling water for his tub;
And, if a troubadour appeared,
His services were commandeered.
But now, when, mindful of my bath,
Reluctantly from bed Islip, -
No minstrels flock around my path,
Nor does my customary dip
Provoke a solitary toot
From anybody's jocund flute.
But all is still. To me belongs
No kind of minstrelsy at all,
Save when I warble comic songs
Imported from the music-hall,
And even these are marred by rude
Complainings from the neighbourhood.
Yet, after all, complaint is vain,
For, though our melodies be less,
The world has now contrived to gain
A compensating cleanliness,
And baths and bath-rooms are for us
Enjoyably ubiquitous.
Though it is true the cheap supplies
Vouchsafed us by a Water Board
Do not incite our friends to rise
And hammer on a harpsichord,
Regret seems really rather wrong,
For soap has superseded song.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ORME AGNUs did a bold thing in staking out his literary
claim in the very heart of the country that owes allegiance to
the old lion of Dorchester; but he has long since proved
himself worthy even of the associations of Wessex. In Sarah
Tuldon's Lovers (WARD, LOCK) he has continued the story of
his best-known heroine so pleasantly that she will now have
more lovers than ever. The book is a comedy of courtships,
interspersed with happy little sketches of Dorset life; and,
though inanimate Nature does not play quite the same part
in Mr. AGNUs's writings as in those of his greater neighbour,
still, for one who loves Purbeck as well as I do, the sugges-
tion of that wonderful landscape in the background, its great
skies and brown heaths, gives to a delightful novel by no
means its least charm. To Holiday-Makers Commencing (as
the advertisements say) my advice next Whitsuntide would
certainly be to purchase at Waterloo Station a return ticket
to Wareham and a
copy of Sarah Tul-
don's Lovers. The
journey will just
carry you nicely
through the book.
At Winchester the
parson and the old
squire will have
had their dismissal;
before Bourne-
mouth you will
know the true
character of Ostra-
more and what
Sarah did when
she discovered it;
and, if the ending
leaves you a little
sad, by that time
the tower of Corfe
and the great hills
will be on the hori-
zon to console you,
and you will be
NEVER LEND YoUR CAR WITHOUT YOUR CHAUFFEUR.
Borrower (meeting owner of car). “ONLY ONE MoRE Load, old Boy! Do it in six Easy—what?”
A clever book of an unusual kind is The Valley of Shadows
(CONSTABLE), in which Mr. FRANCIS GRIERson has told with
wonderſul charm his early memories of Illinois in" the
days immediately preceding the Civil War, when ABRAHAM
LINCOLN was a candidate for the Presidency and the whole
land was troubled with the expectation of coming change.
In a series of vivid personal impressions Mr. GRIEItson gives
us a history of that time that is as enthralling as any romance.
His pictures of life on the prairie, or, a little later, in St. Louis
itself, are things of real beauty and power, touched with just
that element of mysticism that might be expected from the
writer's other work and adds enormously to his value as
the critic of an extraordinary epoch. There are chapters
in the book—“The Camp Meeting” is an example of qne
kind, “The Log House" of another—that haunt one after-
wards like remembered music, or like passages in the prose
of WALTER PATER, to which indeed there is much in Mr.
GRIERSON's style that is akin. Yet for all this the book
produces no effect of artifice; it is astir with lively and
vigorous movement. To sum up, truth, though often stranger
- - than fiction, is al-
| most always duller;
Mr. GRIERSON has
accomplished the
rare feat of making
it more interesting.
In a brief busi-
ness-like preface to
The Press Album,
published by Mr.
MURRAY in aid of
the Journalists' Or-
phan Fund, Mr.
HARRY LAWSON ex-
plains that every
penny contributed
is devoted to the
keep and education
of the orphans.
No money is wasted
on bricks and mor-
tar: the principle
laid down is that
of saving the child
in that glorious -
country to which Mr. ORME AGNUs has given yet another
literary snark.
I am afraid that I am not a hall-marked Englishman. I
hunt just as often as I take a bath without the chill off, which
is never. But, if I know a hunter from a cab-horse and
Leicestershire from Leicester Square, The Straw (HUTCHINSON),
by R. RAMSAY, can give the ordinary hunting-novel several
fields and a beating. It is Leicestershire to the life, and it
has in it as pretty a love-story and as thrilling a point-to-
point and as mysterious a murder as the heart of man or
Jack Mytton or Sherlock Holmes could desire. And these
are only some of its good points. If ever I am overtaken by
my past and overwhelmed by my debts I shall be a lucky
man if I find a “straw" as charming as Judy Stewart to
catch at. Poor Judy ? For her own sweet sake as well
as from a sentimental affection (on Mr. Punch's
count) for the honoured name which she bears I rejoice
to think that in the end she reached the sun-kissed
haven of peaceful love. And, as straws show which way
the wind blows, I don't think I am far wrong in guessing,
from many feminine touches in R. RAMSAY's book, that the
hand which held the tiller is a woman's. Besides, I happen
to know.

THOMAS CATLING... Congratulations are due to him, to the
Fund, and to the public who have the opportunity, by
the expenditure of half-a-crown, of possessing a hand-
some volume containing rich variety of contributions from

for special notice particular contributions would be as diffi-
cult as it would be invidious; nor can I gratify the impulse
to quote in full a catalogue of names and subjects extending
over seven pages. Space forbids. As alternative the reader
is invited to plank down his half-crown and call the book his
own. The coin, like the poet's bedstead, will serve a double
debt to pay. The buyer will get five shillings'-worth for his
money, and an excellent charity will be richer by half-a-crown.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BEAUTY IN THE MAKING.
[An esteemed contemporary has made the authoritative statement
that “no woman has completely reached the zenith of her charms until
she has suffered, nor a man until he has had disappointment."]
THE papers said the usual things,
Mentioned the bride's unearthly grace,
Her angel figure (less the wings),
Her trousseau trimmed with costly lace;
Told how the bridesmaids' heads were tired,
And what the midget page was wearing,
And found the gallant much admired
For manly build and martial bearing.
Well, I was also there and felt
That, if I had to tell the tale,
A plainer couple never knelt
At the marital altar-rail;
She might he good and he be brave,
But nothing surely could be sorrier
Than the design which Nature gave
To both their faces—bride and warrior.
So they were wed, this “happy pair; ”
But scarce the honied moon had waned
When discord, darkening all the air,
Got their relations rudely strained;
Another month —and (ob, how sad')
They parted, miserable creatures,
Each sore because the other had
A simply rotten set of features.
On rolled the carth, till both were fain
To fix the breach and have recourse
To where they turn one flesh to twain
By Separation (or Divorce);
And I, the loyal fellow who
Assistcal at the earlier function,
Turned up to see the business through,
And watch their secular disjunction.
A feather might have knocked me flat
What mystic power had wrought the spell?
A fairer couple never sat
Among the wigs within the well!
Then I recalled how beauty's glow
Will thus occur as though by magic
When men have had a horrid blow
And women sampled something tragic.
A most affecting scene ensued.
The sight of such amazing charms
Moved them to drop their bitter feud
And fall inside each other's arms.
Tough Counsel melted who had seen
Whole stacks of married pairs unmated,
And through the lids of BARGRAVE DEANE
The stealthy tear-drop percolated. O. S.
Budget Note.
The rebate of £10 per child on small earned incomes
works out at 7s.6d. per annum-the price of a dog-licence.
Consequently the little boy who, on being asked whether he
would like a baby sister, said he would rather have a fox-
terrier, will now be able to have both.
The description under a photograph, in The Daily Mirror,
of the First Sea Lord runs : —“Admiral Sir John Fisher
(near the cart).” Not, as Mr. MAXSE would like, “Admiral
Sir John Fisher (in the cart).”
cRoss-ExAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's IRoAD To KNowLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; Papa, aged 48.)
Little Arthur. Papa, may I talk to you about Sunday ?
Papa. Sunday ? Of course you may. But I'm afraid we
can't alter our arrangements.
L. A. What arrangements, Papa?
Papa. Well, you know, Mr. Blinkenstein and I are to play
a round of golf in the morning at Wexley Heath, and you’re
to carry my clubs for me; and then we’re coming home to
lunch—your mother's asked some friends to it—and if it's a
fine day we're to go out in the motor in the afternoon; and
then there'll be tea, and then dinner; and then most of
them will be getting back to London by train. It's all
pretty well settled. I don't see how we can alter the
arrangements.
L. A. No, Papa, I don't mean that. I don't want to talk
about this next Sunday particularly. I want to know if
you're sure it's quite right for us to go on in the way we're
going on Sundays.
Papa. O-ho! Somebody's been putting Sabbatarian
notions into your head. You'll be telling me next I mustn't
whistle on Sunday.
L. A. Oh no, Papa, I shouldn't think of that. I'm sure
if you would really like to whistle on Sunday I should like to
listen to you. But, Papa!
Papa. Yes, what is it? Cut it short now.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I'll try. What does “Sabbatarian"
mean 2
Papa. Well, ah—um—it's not very easy to explain.
L. A. But, Papa, you used the word just now, you know.
You said somebody had been putting Sabbatarian notions
into my head, didn't you ?
Papa. Oh, well, when people have exaggerated motions
about Sunday and think one oughtn't to do anything at all
on a Sunday, why, we call them Sabbatarians.
L. A. Then Mr. Harding the vicar and John the butler
are Sabbatarians. I've heard Mr. Harding preach about it.
He said the modern fashionable crazes for playing golf and
rushing about the country in motor-cars on Sundays were
destroying the good old observance of the day of rest; and
John said last Monday he was so run off his legs with one
thing and another every Sunday he didn't have half a minute
to himself, and he knew it was killing him.
Papa. You mustn't listen to what John says.
had no business to talk to you like that.
L. A. No, Papa, perhaps not. And he said a lot more
about being a negro slave, and getting ordered about like
cattle, and oughtn't he to have a bit of his Sunday to him-
F. like other people? I'm afraid he's a Sabbatarian,
apa.
Papa. Well, well, we won't talk about John.
L. A. No, Papa. And if you don't like Sabbatarians,
Papa, I'm sure I don't want to be one.
Papa. That's right, my boy.
L. A. But then, I suppose you think we ought all to work
on Sundays, and do anything we like and make other people
work.
Papa. I never said that.
L. A. But, Papa, Sabbatarians are the people who say we
mustn't do these things, and so if you dislike Sabbatarians
you must want to do the things the Sabbatarians don't want.
Papa. Now don't you catch me up like that, my boy. It's
not respectful. Besides, I never thought anything of the sort.
L. A. Didn't you, Papa? But you said it, you know.
Oughtn't we to work on Sundays, then, Papa?
Papa. No, you know we're told not to. But I don't call
golf work. It's mere play.

had the grace to attend divine service it might be
different—
Papa. Well, your mother's going, and Mabel.
L. A. Yes, Papa, that's just what Mr. Harding said. He
said men thought their duty was done when they had allowed
the women of the family to go to church; but he said they
were quite wrong about that. They ought to go themselves.
Papa. Now, look here. I want to tell you once for all, it's
no use your trying to fling quotations from Mr. Harding at

petent to decide these matters for myself.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I'm sure you are. And if you don't like
what Mr. Harding says in his sermons——
Papa. Don't put words into my mouth.
L. A. No, Papa; but you said I was flinging quotations
from Mr. Harding at your head just to bully you, and nobody
likes things that bully, so you can't like what Mr. Harding
says in his sermons. And if you don't like the sermons I
quite understand why you don't want me to go to church.
Papa. Who said I didn't want you to go to church?
L. A. Well, Papa, you're going to take me to carry your
clubs on Sunday morning, so I shan't get to church. And
there's John—he can't get to church; and the women
servants. But anyhow, it's jolly to think we're not Sab-
batarians, Papa. That would be awful, wouldn't it?
Papa, You'd better toddle off and attend to your postage-
stamp album.
L. A. Oh, there's plenty of time for that.
Papa. No time like the present. Off you go.
L.A. I could do it on Sunday, Papa.
Papa. No, you'll do it now. I've told you fifty times I
won't have you sticking in stamps on Sundays.
A Pleasant Emendation.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
AT THE PLAY.
“ColonP.L. SMITH.”
IN the intervalsof those cricket matches
at which Mr. MASON and myself have
from time to time assisted (in the French
sense) I cannot remember that the sub-
ject of Dramatic Irony was ever under
discussion. Our captain, Mr. J. M.
BARRIE, would, I am sure, have dis-
couraged the topic as tending to divert
our intelligence from the main purpose.
But Mr. MASON should know, without
need of reminder, that the sport of
Sophocles makes this demand in common
with the more difficult game of
cricket—that, if you play it at all,
you must keep the rules. Now
when Celia Faraday takes the
audience and one of her sisters into
her confidence and gives them to
understand that Colonel Smith is, to
the best of her knowledge, a mere
figment of the imagination, the
author should have remembered
that the other actors, not being in
the secret, were bound to receive
the report of that gallant officer's
death with a due decorum and
sense of affliction. “Instead of
which,” they treated the announce-
ment with a dreadſul and even re-
volting frivolity. The result of this
behaviour was to change the whole
character of the play. What had
promised to be a phantastic comedy
was reduced to the level of farce.
Criticism modified its focus, and we
felt that we had been cheated all
this while of the irresponsible and
knockabout merriment to which we
had a justclaim. Spasmodic humour,
however attractive, could not content
us; if it was to be farce, we must
have the kind of fun that rollicks
breathlessly; and Mr. MASON did
not give us nearly enough to go
round.
The scheme of the play was suffi-
ciently fresh. This idea of a neg-
lected girl trying to give herself
value by pretending to be engaged
to an imaginary soldier in Somali-'—
land (who happened to exist in the flesh)
might have made excellent stuff for a
much shorter play. Dut Mr. MASON
has beaten out his bar of gold too thin.
Those excellent young actors, Mr. ERNEST
Thesider and Mr. REGINALD Owen, who
were introduced in order to mark the
enhanced value of Celia Faraday stock,
were themselves a very poor drug in
the market; Mr. William FARREN had
very little chance, except with the
obituary notice; and there was also a
superfluous sister in the shape of Miss
Lydi A BiLBRookE, though I should have
been sorry to miss her pretty face and
hair. .
Still, our best gratitude is due to Mr.
Ro
Ja
Celia Faraday
Colonel Smith
Admiral Grice
MASON for having broken up the Thief
series of plays which threatened to become
a permanent feature of the St. James's.
And it was delightful at last to see Miss
IRENE WANBRUGh in a character which she
could play with a light heart and no
fear of being lectured portentously for
her deceit. In the letter scene she was
fascinating; and always her facial play
and gestures were extraordinarily clever
and illuminating.
Mr. ALEXANDER will probably differ
from me when I venture to think that
he was more in his true element than
he has been in any new play for several
about the seat that Mr. MASON is to vacate 2
Would it not be a sporting proposi-
tion if the retiring Member revived a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TOBACCO AND OTHER DUTIES.
[The Chancellor of the Exchequer having
introduced his Budget in a brilliant
speech, the usual discussion followed.]
“WELL,” said Henry, “what do you
think of it 7”
“Rotten,” I said. “I mean ripping,”
I added hastily. “What I really mean,”
I went on, as I gathered courage, “is
that it is the bankruptcy of Free Trade; |
it mortgages our resources up to the
hilt; it plunders the middle class; it.
destroys all confidence in the future; it
—er—it I say, why are things
always mortgaged up to the hilt?
mean, it's such a silly expression.”
“You’ve been reading The Daily
Mail.”
“I have,” I confessed. “I say, Henry,
do tell me. Am I one of the middle-
class 2''
“The middle-class is the class below
yourself and the person you happen to
be talking to at the time.”
“That's you and me. Well, Henry,
my lad, the class below us seems to be
rather a jolly one. Let's go down a
step, shall we?”
“The Mail says the middle-class is
being plundered. You don't want to be
plundered, do you? Look here, it talks
about the ‘middle-class Issachar.’”
“Oh, I say, who was Issachar? Much
of a chap 2"
“Keep to the point,” said Henry.
“Well, the point is this, that the
middle-class apparently has £5,000 a
year and several motors. I’m all for
being one of them. You can plunder
me as much as you like, if you give me
the stuff first. Henry, my middle-class
friend, how's petrol?”
Henry read his paper in silence for a
moment.
“Have you a pencil” he asked at
last. “If so, we might work it out.”
“Work out what ?”
- “Why, if it's a good Budget or a bad
| one, of course.”
“How on earth——”
“It is the duty,” said Henry solemnly,
“of every high-minded Englishman to
decide for himself if the Budget affects
him personally. If it does, it is a bad
one, and, as a true patriot, he must
oppose it.”
| “I never thought of that. I suppose
you’re right.”
“Of course I'm right. Here’s the
editor of The Petroleum Review. He--”
“A nice chatty paper,” I interrupted.
“I know the man who does their
acrostics.”
“Well, the editor of The Petroleum
Review says y
“Of course, the chess page is not
| what it used to be.” -
“The editor of The Petroleum Review,”
continued Henry, unmoved, “is all
against the tax on petrol. He thinks it
bad for the country. And Mr. GLUCK-
STEIN is very much shocked at the
increased duty on tobacco. Actually
shocked. Not on his own account, mind
you, but because it may hurt his country.
And the brewers »
“No, no,” I begged. “Not them
again. One knows their devotion. Be-
sides, I quite see your point.”
i. Very well then. Where's the pen-
cil 2 °
I produced it. We sat down in front
of a sheet of paper and began.
“Increased tax on motors,” I read out.
“Nothing doing there,” said Henry,
“as we don't belong to the middle class.
Go on.”
“Tax on petrol.”
“Pass.”
“Wait a bit,” I said. “Don’t they
clean panama hats with petrol? Or am
I thinking of something else?”
“You must be thinking of something
else.”
“I’m not so sure. Put down “Petrol,
doubtful.’ It might mean another penny
a year to us.”
“Next.”
“Twopence on incomes over £3,000,
and another sixpence over £5,000.”
Henry turned to me expectantly.
“Well?” he said, poising the pencil.
“If they paid me properly,” I be-
gan, “I might— As it is, no. Pass
£3,000.”
“Next.”
“Abatement of £10 per child under
sixteen,” I read. “Er—sixteen seems a
good many.” -
Henry smiled and looked out of the
window.
“However,” I said, “we needn't——
Well, then we come to estate duties. I
have an aunt who—— It's 15 per cent.
on a million, isn't it? . . . She lives at
Lewisham, though. And I believe she
has a son of her own. In any case she 's
one of these healthy nut people. Be-
sides, I–”
“Aunt doubtful,” wrote Henry.
“Thank you. Stamp duties come
next. Have you any bearer securities or
option notes? None at all? What's in
that old cupboard 2 Oh, all right. Then
how about licence duties?”
“I’m drinking ginger-ale just now,”
said Henry.
“I’m drinking cough mixture chiefly.
I gather that there's no alcohol in either.
Pass licence duties. Next we have
unearned increment of land.”
“I have,” said Henry thoughtfully,
“a small share in a cricket ground. At
least I haven’t paid my subscription this
year yet, but : y
“If the subscription was raised you
could resign,” I pointed out.
“True. In fact I think I shall amy-
how. Thanks for reminding me; it’s a
rotten ground. Then that settles the
land-tax. Anything left?”
I choked back a sob as I put down
my paper and turned to him.
“Henry, my dear old friend,” I said,
“there is indeed something left. We
are now, in the words of the late Sultan,
right up against it. What do you say
to eightpence a pound on tobacco?”
Henry told me. - -
“Quite so,” I agreed. “And nothing
less. The Government has forfeited
our confidence. Your Panama hat and
my aunt, we might have forgiven them
that. But this—this is too much. To
think that we, you and I, should have
to pay, actually to pay for old-age
pensions and Dreadnoughts and things.
That the country should do so is all right,
but that you and I–– Henry, it is
too much. Pass me a cigarette that has
not paid the extra eightpence, and let
us be silent for a while. . . .” "
When I had finished my cigarette I
got up to go. -
“Well, I must be off,” I said. “I’ve
a lot of work to do. So long.”
“Good-bye,” said Henry. “By the
way, what do you think of the Budget?”
“The Budget?” I cried furiously.
“A spiteful and vindictive Budget, Sir!
A venomous Budget ! The disgraceful
and mischievous product of a third-class
intellect ' He has sold the country,
Sir! Budget, indeed ” And I strode
from the room. A. A. M.

been expressed more clearly. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 26.
—Interesting debate on Second Reading
of Bill designed to augment salary of
PRESIDENT of BoARD of TRADE from £2,000
to £5,000 a year, The scheme, when
carried to full extent, will make similar
increase in emolument of PRESIDENT OF
Local GovertNMENT BoARD. Labour Mem-
bers to a man dead against it. Their
remaining point of agreement with their
right hon, friend John Burns is ſound in
his declaration th it no man
is worth more than £500 a I
year. True, it was made
at a time when John did not
think he would live to draw
£2,000. But, though circum-
stances change, truth stands.
Only the other day, the
Labour Members declared
their uncompromising aver-
sion from other people draw-
ing salaries by proposing to
dock Victor GRAYSON's. That
a mere trifle compared with a
proposition which, according
to admission of PREMIER, will
involve an added annual draft
on the Treasury exceeding
£10,500. Mr. Jowett (no fam-
ily connection with Balliol),
went to the root—or, more
precisely to the keel—of the
matter.
“Barnacles,” he said, -
“have been allowed to grow
on the Board of Trade, and
they should be looked into.”
WINSTON moved uneasily
on his seat. The duties of
PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF
TRADE have steadily grown
with expansion of industry.
Within his time has been
added the omerous but bene-
ficent task of acting as me- l
diator in wage conflicts be-
tween masters and men. If
to these engagements is to be
added that of looking into barnacles.
growing on the Board of Trade, he must
reconsider his position.
BYLEs of BRADFond (First Baron, cr. —)
offered a practical suggestion that in-
stantly commanded attention.
“The real question,” he said, “is
how much is the Ministerial Bench
worth, taking it all round? That de-
cided, let us vote a lump sum and leave
division of the pooled salaries to right
hon. gentlemen themselves.”
PREMIER shook his head. Sufficient
for the day are the disagreements among
his flock. To have this bone of conten-
tion superadded was more than he could
contemplate with equanimity. Still it
is a business proposition so illuminating
that something may be heard of it in
Committee.
WINSTON takes characteristically digni-
fied view of situation. If the House likes
to be generous with public money, it is
not for him to thwart benevolent in-
tention. Personally he will not profit
by it. Increased salary of PRESIDENT of
BoARD of TRADE must date from the term
of his successor in the office. Remem-
bering his Virgil, he murmurs:–
“Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes;
Sic vos non vobis nidificatis aves.”
Opposition, not to be outdone in
The Wicked UNCLE.
“Sydney Buxton fell on his knees and promised a full enquiry.”
enerosity, protest. BALCARREs, who
early loves a Liberal Minister, gives
notice that in Committee he will move
an amendment making the increased
salary forthwith payable. F. E. Smith
takes the same line. Incidentally drops
remark that may have autobiographical
interest.
“There is,” he said, “many a junior
at the Bar who earns more salary than
the PRIME MINISTER.”
Business done.—Second Reading of
Board of Trade (Salary) Bill carried by
152 votes against 76.
Tuesday–JoyNson-Hicks, the “We”
of Parliamentary debate, continues to
develop. This afternoon he flung across
arid waste of Committee on Post Office
Estimates the garland of an idyll. Every-
body knows how David Copperfield's
acquaintance, Mr. Dick, found it im-
possible to abstain from dragging into
his Memorial reference to the head of
CHARLEs I. JoyNSON-Hicks, going one
better, dragged Mr. Dick himself on to
floor of House of Commons.
It was the old, old story, told
with such artless simpl city that when
JoyNSON sat down amid a murmur of
cheers he sympathetically mopped the
eyes of Hicks. As for the audience,
there was scarcely a dry eye among them.
Mr. Dick, it seems, is a Post
Office official “who cast an
- eye on a young lady in the
Telegraph Department.” “It
was,” JoyNSoN-Hicks hastened
to add, “a perfectly moral
and justifiable eye, which
ripened into an attachment.”
Not the eye, you know, but
circumstances generally. The
lady's name was, as the Cate-
chism hath it, M. or N. as the
case may be. With permis-
sion of the CHAIRMAN of CoM-
Mittees, JoyNSoN-Hicks agreed
to call her “Miss M.”
All went well for a time,
till Miss M.'s father got wind
of what was going on in the
Telegraph Department. Re-
cognising in the PostMASTER-
GENERAL a family man, capable
of sympathy with a perturbed
father, he wrote to him com-
plaining of Mr. Dick's pro-
cedure. His confidence was
amply justified. Setting aside
problems arising out of wire-
less telegraphy, deferring
establishment of penny post-
age with France, SYDNEY
Buxton threw himself into the
affair with remarkable display
of energy and concentration
of purpose. He not only wrote
stating that he “viewed with
displeasure” Mr. Dick's action
in regard to Miss M., but
straightway transferred the swain to
Manchester “at his own expense.”
There he would have remained, with
Miss M. crying her pretty eyes out
at Glasgow, only for JoyNSON-Hicks.
This worthy couple, remembering that
they too were once young, resolved to
come to the rescue. Hence this touch-
ing story interposed in dry discussion
of the Vote for £12,337,930 for the
salaries and expenses of the Post
Office, including telegraphs and tele-
phones.
Emotion excited in the Committee
swept away everything before it. SYDNEY
Buxton, temporarily cast for part of
the Wicked "Uncle, fell on his knees,

promised full inquiry into the matter
and immediate reinstatement of Mr.
Dick, if it were shown that he had
suffered injustice. With this assurance,
promising to wind up the romance with
the familiar line, “Mr. Dick and Miss M.
were married and lived happily ever
afterwards,” the Committee cried content,
and what threatened to prove a serious
Ministerial crisis passed over.
Business done. — Post Office Vote
agreed to. -
Thursday – “The Hon. Member
seems to be in an argumentative mood.”
- Thus mused the SPEAKER, regarding
John T. MiDDLEMORE with fresh -
interest. It was the state cf
the Navy that wrought upon
the mind of the Member for
North Birmingham. The
geographical position of his
constituency forced upon him
the necessity of hurrying on
with the building of de-
stroyers. He cannot sleep o'
nights till he learns “how
many dry docks capable of
docking Dreadnoughts we
shall have in the North Sea,”
say, by the year 1916.
“The matter is very ur-
gent,” he said. “When the
house is on fire—”
What would thereupon hap-
pen was left untold. ' There
is a strict rule dominating
Question Time which forbids
the interpolation of speeches.
Of this the SPEAKER reminded
John T., and he, under com-
pulsion, left the house burn-
ing. Up again when ADMIRAL
McKENNA attempted to sheer
off from question of dry docks
in North Sea.
“But, Sir "he insisted,
jumping to his feet with more
than sexagenarian alacrity.
Had he been left alone for a
quarter of an hour the Ad-
MIRAL would (in a Parlia-
mentary sense, of course) have
been wrapped up in his old tarpaulin
jacket and swung below.
Here the SPEAKER interposed with im-
putation about an argumentative mood.
It was a second warning. A third might
have awful consequences. So J. T. sub-
sided, and to the many mysteries the
dark unſathomed caves of ocean bear is
added one that conceals the number of
dry docks we shall have in the North
Sea seven years hence.
Business donc.—Lloyd-GEORGE intro-
duces and expounds Budget. A story
of unrelieved n eluncholy. Deficit not
of thirteen millions, as anticipated, but
exceeding sixteen millions, with revenue
dropping, expenditure increasing, and
Trade depressed. Prodigious speech;

showed signs of collapse. Still an hour

plainly perturbed; Prince ARTHUR re-
garded him across the table with pained
anxiety. At length the LEADER of OPPost-
TION interposed, and, backing up the
PREMIER's entreaty, hitherto unavailing,
persuaded the fagged and fainting Minis-
ter to take brief rest. .
Chancellor of the Exchequer. “Nice car. How many horse-power”"
Ourner (with pardonable pride). “About 30.”
Chancellor of the Exchequer. “Oh, then I want Eight (guineas), and
I won't wait.”
ANOTHER WICTIM OF PROGRESS.
“WELL,” I said, “what do you think
of it all 2" -
He was the fifth horse on the rank,
and had spilt all his dinner in the
roadway through over-desire to get at
the bottom of his nose-bag. His driver
being beyond call in a neighbouring
public-house, he was not in the best of
humour.
“I’m glad you asked me,” he said.
“You're the first to do so. It's cabby,
cabby, cabby, that the people are slopping
over; not a word of cabby's best friend' "
“That's how it strikes you?” I re-
marked.
“How else?” he replied.
“We've
been having a pretty rotten time, I can
tell you, ever since those oil-carts came
in. It's got steadily worse and worse.
We used to be looked after once; fed
regularly, groomed regularly; not over-
worked. But now ! Now no one cares
a straw about us. The drivers have
taken to drink, and the cleaners have
lost hope, and the owners can't afford
fodder. We stand about in the cold all
day, starving, and at night there's no
one to treat us like friends.”
I expressed a sympathy which I really
felt.
“I don't wonder,” he went on, “that
people take the taxis now ;
but I used to wonder once.
Look at the difference | There
was a noisy, nasty, little rat-
tling box, with a driver who
was always having tea, seldom
had change, and never said
“Thank you”; while here was
a smart, comfortable cab, a
smart horse with pretty mu-
sical bells, and a cheery driver
| with a joke in his mouth.
How any one in his senses
could prefer an oil-cart to that
I can't see; but now, of
course, it's different. The
horses aren't smart any more,
and the cabmen aren't cheery,
But it's letting the horses
get poor that's done the mis-
chief, because what me and
my mates believe is that the
people would soon have tired
of the new toy and come back
to us; but now they can't
—we're too wretched.”
I was forced to agree.
“It's very kind of Lord
RosebERY and Mr. Rothschild to
do what they have, to say no-
thing of The Daily Mail,” he
continued; “but what I want
to know is, who's going to
look after us? Who's going
to put flesh on us again, and
a glossy shine, and make it a
pride once again to lift up
our hoofs? Who's going to do that?
Cabby, indeed! Cabby has a chance.
He can buck up if he wants to, but
we can't. What we want is a month or
two at grass and a little affection.”
“We must get Lord RosebERY to think
of that too,” I said ; “ or Mr. Rothschild.”
“They won't,” said the horse, gloomily.
“It's always cabby. Why, look at the
pheasants Mr. Rothschild gives them
every Christmas. Did he ever give the
horses anything? Never. Not even a
lump of sugar ! No, this is a bad
world for horses. But what me and
my mates are always hoping is that
there's a better somewhere else on the
other side of the knacker's yard.”
“I hope so too, I'm sure,” I said.

THE LATEST MARTYR.
AN ARTICLE without A Wond of TRUTH
in it.
HAVING heard disquieting rumours of
LITTLE Tich's health, and being anxious
to see for myself how that mirth-maker
of genius, the maximum of fun in the
minimum of space, or, as another scholar
has described him, “the multum-in-parvo
of merriment,” really was, I ventured
to intrude upon his privacy and make
intº at the fountain head.
t did not take long to reach the
comedian's minute bijou residence in
Lilliput Lane, Little Britain, where he
has for neighbours Sir George SMALL-
MAN and Mr. Shorter. On knocking at
the door a feeble voice bade me come in,
and I found myself in the presence of
the great little droll. But, oh, how
wasted what a change! Where was
now that bright and saucy eye? It
was dimmed and melancholy. Those
amazing legs that have so oft set the
Tivoli in a roar—could these staid and
woe begone limbs be they?
“Then, my dear sir,” I gasped, “it’s
true; you are ill.”. -
“I am,” he said, in a voice from which
all the old irresponsibility and gaiety
had passed away; “I am.”
“And may I ask,” I inquired, “what
is your trouble?”
“You may,” he said. “I will put
it briefly. I am gradually perishing
of thirst.”
“Thirst,” I cried—“thirst—in the
heart of London, in the midst of public-
houses ' "
“Ah, there,” he interrupted—“there
you have it. Public-houses! Do you
know, I have not had a drink since the
passing of the new Children's Bill.
They won't serve me, they're so terrified
of the fine-forty shillings the first time
and five pounds the next. If I could
only get inside I should have a chance,
for they would know me; but I can't ;
they're all on the watch. No sooner does
the shadow of my head appear in the door
than they order me to quit. “Outside
there !' they cry. ‘Barman, put that
boy out.' Their vigilance is something
terrible. Why, once I got an old pal to
take me in—we'd been there scores of
times in the kind old days; but it was
no good. “No children allowed here,'
the landlord barked at us, and my friend
had to leave me outside—with the babies.
No wonder I'm blighted.”
“But, my dear sir,” I said, “why not
send for your beverages and consume
them here?"
“No fun in it,” said he, “no friend-
ship, no conviviality. That's what I
miss. It's not so much the liquor as
the jolly company. All gone, all gone!"
I sympathised with him.
“Yes,” he continued,” and it's loss of
money too. I used to pick up hints for
my songs in those bars. All gone now.”
“You will, at any rate, let me join you
in a bottle here,” I said; “I will be
as jovial as I can and do my best to
recall the past.”
“You're very kind,” he replied; “I’ll
try too. But you mustn't mind if I
don't quite rise to it"; and so saying
he produced a bottle and, with the tears
bedeving that once most facetious of
visages, poured out two glasses. Having
done so he buried his head in his
hands and sobbed, and I slipped noise-
...; away, leaving him alone with his

worDS IN THE Dock.
The long-expected trial of a number of suspect words
began yesterday in Bolt Court, in the house once inhabited
by Dr. Johnson, before Mr. Justice J. A. H. Murºw.' The
court was crowded; among those present whom we noticed
being the compilers of a number of dictionaries, editors, jour-
nalists, and advertising agents. On the back benches sat
several words who greatly showed their daring by venturing
into the precincts at all, among them being “Oxo,” “Post-
Toasties,” “Obsession,” and “Booklet.” - - - -
“Presents” first stepped into the dock, closely guarded
by two strapping worders. * - -
A number of English theatrical managers having testified
to the undesirability of this neologism, Mr. CHARLES FROHMAN
entered the witness-box, and proceeded to give “Presents’
a good character. He had, he said, employed the word all
over the globe, but especially in America and England, and
had found it willing and honest. “Mr. CHARLES FROHMAN
presents” had indeed become a phrase familiar in the mouth
as household words. Other managers, he believed, “offered”
plays ; Mr. REGINALD DANCE, again, “submitted ” them ; but
for himself he “presented" them, and should continue to do.
Cross-examined, Mr. FROliy AN said it was true that a charge
for admittance to his plays was made. ' -
“Then, strictly speaking, you do not “present ' anything;
you charge for it?” -
“Certainly; I am a business man.” -
“Is it, then, truthful to say you ‘present’?” -
“Why, certainly. You have heard of people being pre-
sented at Court, I suppose. Well, you would not say that
they were given to the King! (Applause and laughter.)
The Judge said he was not convinced that “presents”
was guilty; but he hoped that nobody else would adopt the
word. (Mr. FROIIMAN: “Hear, hear!”)
“Century” was then called, and entered the dock.
“'The charge against this person,” said the Public Prose-
cutor, “is that he is an impostor and fraud. In the winter
| he is little heard of, but directly the summer begins he
bursts forth and takes the bread from the mouth of poor
“Hundred,' a very honest fellow, at every turn.” -
Mr. C. B. FRY, called for the defence, said that “Century”
was a great friend of his. Mr. Thomas HAYWARD agreed.
Dr. W. G. GRACE, for the prosecution, said that he hated
the word. “Hundred” was the word he was accustomed to,
and “Century” he looked upon as an interloper and thief.
Major Philip TREvolt said that he adored “Century,” and
should always stand by him. Similarly, he adored “Rabbit.”
(Sensation.) - - . . . . . .
After listening to other testimony, the Judge sentenced
“Century” to a year's rest, amid applause. -
: “Scientist” took his place. *
A memorial from the Royal Society was read by the Public
Prosecutor, calling attention to the baleful activities of this
person, who was, it is said, an American adventurer with a
bad record in his own country. . . .
The Judge: “Can one have a bad record in America?”
(Laughter.) .. - '. * .
Evidence was also given to the prisoner's disadvantage by
a deputation from the Athenaeum Club. . . .
In his defence a long speech was made by Dr. SALEEby,
who said that without the valuable and expert assistance of
“Scientist” there would be no means whatever of rapidly
describing a certain type of savant who had taken all learning
for his province.
The publisher of The Harmsworth Encyclopedia concurred.
. . A letter having been read from Sir OLIVER LODGE, the
Judge passed sentence of three years' imprisonment in
Carmelite Street. -

“Shall I strike at it with my partisan !"—Hamlet. *
We wonder whether the Duke of RUTLAND, when he sent
£10 to “Cabby's" Fund and pleaded that the Death Duties
(this was before the new Budget came out) prevented his
sending more, had any suspicion that he was to be charged
with importing a party spirit into a matter of common
charity. . Yet this is how The Westminster Gazette comments
upon the Duke's letter: “We thought that the hard lot of
the cabman was independent of politics, but to a Duke no
task is too hard, and his Grace of Rutland has contrived
to show how the fate of the London cabman can be made
part and parcel of a campaign against Liberalism.” The
italics are our own contribution to The Westminster's amaz-
ing illustration of its own partisanship. It is well that
Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT's memory as the inventor of the Death
Duties should be kept green, and The Westminster Gazette is,
of course, of the right nuance for this purpose, but we had
always thought that succeeding Chancellors on the Tory side
had paid him the practical flattery of imitation. Woukd
The Westminster accuse every one who grumbles at the [
Income-tax of joining in a campaign against the principles

BEASTS AND THEIR BUYERS.
INCIDENTs of THE Bostock SAI.E.
The accounts of the sale recently held
at Glasgow, when the “Scottish Zoo”
of Councillor Bostock was put up
to auction, have been unaccountably
meagre, the only interesting fact di-
vulged being the purchase by Mr.
BRANSBY WILLIAMs of a talking raven
with a view to lending additional realism
to his representation of Barnaby Rudge.
As a matter of fact, the progress of the
sale positively teemed with incidents in
which the personal note was loudly, may
sensationally, prominent.
One of the most remarkable lots put
up was a magnificent camel—wittily
called a Camelot by the auctioneer—
which, after spirited bidding, was knocked
down for 350 guineas to Mr. HUMPHRY
WARD, who proposes to ride his new
acquisition in the Row on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays during the
season. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays the ship of the desert will
remain at its moorings in a sumptuous
Hippodromedarium erected after a de-
sign supplied by Mr. R. B. CUNNINGHAME

A massive elephant, weighing 35 tons guineas), four gorillas, a laughing
and standing some 45 hands high,
realised 400 guineas, the fortunate pur-
chaser being Mr. ALGERNoN BLAckwood,
the author of Jimbo. As the elephant
in question is a grandchild of the late
lamented Jumbo, the felicity of his
purchase will leap to the eye of persons
of the meanest intelligence.
A brace of superb lions were knocked
down at 250 guineas to Messrs. SALMon

bidding was very keen, but although the
eminent Nicotinian experts were opposed
by numerous competitors, including
Mr. PIERPONT MoRGAN, Mr. GEORGE
ALEXANDER and Dr. HEBER HART, they
ultimately secured the lot amid roars
of applause from their purchase.
Mr. HERBERT TRENCH, the eminent poet
impresario, was also a large purchaser,
and secured for his new repertory

including a spacious hippopotamus (125

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE great drawback for me to the pleasure of opening a
book with the name of Mr. JoEL CHANDLER HARRIs upon its
cover is that I am always so sadly disappointed to find within
no mention of Brer Rabbit and his immortal company of
victims. Not that, this apart, The Bishop and the Bogie Man
(MURRAY) is by any means destitute of charm; on the con-
trary, the simple story of Adelaide and her childhood in the
house of Uncle Jonas is admirably told, with the same kindly,
old-fashioned humour that has made its author beloved in
two continents. I liked Adelaide at once, and Mr. Sanders,
especially after he pretended so nicely to see Cally-lou,
Adelaide's invisible playfellow. Randall, the black boy,
upon her own legs, and not discovering that she was of
aristocratic origin. Margery, who did not suffer from any ||
excess of modesty, proposed, in the first chapter, to a
peculiarly offensive bounder. He declined very frankly;
and having given him up as a bad job Margery's next step
was to answer an advertisement and then to leave “The
Feathers.” From a barmaid she now became “niece” to Lady
Pomphrey, and her name of Pigeon was altered to Daw—
which was, after all, more or less in the family. Lady
Pomphrey, though her bark was worse than her bite, had
succeeded in quarrelling with her son, and was clearly
anxious to quarrel with the rest of her relations. To become
suddenly the niece of such a high-spirited lady was no
sinecure, for apart from other inconveniences the position
entailed a lot of determined lying, and as a liar Margery
never got thoroughly set. Nevertheless, as she and her suc-
cessor at “The Feathers” married
likewise endeared himself by his
obliging tact in falling down dead
the very first time Adelaide shot at
him with a corn-stalk and said
“Bang!” You perceive that Ade-
laide had quite a good time of it
at Uncle Jonas's ; afterwards she
grew up into a rather conven-
tional heroine, and was less in-
teresting. But of all the charac-
ters an easy favourite for me was
old Aunt Lucindy, simply because,
in recounting some adventure, she
described herself as having “lit
out fom dar.” Which is precisely
what the great protagonist of the
Remus tales was wont to do when
circumstances became too strong
for him. If only Mr. HARRIs would
“quit” writing stories that other
people could do equally well, so
that bimeby ole Brer Rabbit might
again come lipperty-lopperty out
of his enchanted woods, that would
be an event worth any quantity of
bishops!

of establishing relations with them. However, this esoteric
company of youths and maidens is such a very jolly one that
no difficulties of initiation should be allowed to stand in the
way of a more intimate acquaintance. I particularly like
Bumble. When he falls into a furze-bush he says, “Ber-lud,
Iago, blood l Bah, sweetheart, 'tis but a scratch; fear not
for-eee-ha! O hell!" which is exactly what one ought to
say. The hero, Tony Bargrave, is perhaps the least realised
of the many young men in the book. He is a shadowy
sentimentalist who imagines himself to be in love with every
girl he meets; and it is only in the last part of the work
that we can visualise him properly. Mr. Sidgwick, in fact,
would have written a more interesting book if he had begun
and ended it a hundred pages later.
The barmaid-heroine of Margery Pigeon (ARNOLD) knew
nothing about her parents, and I wish to compliment Miss
JANE WARDLE on allowing her to stand—if I may say so—
Recollections of Wagner, by AN-
GEio NEUMANN (Constable), in which that veteran impresario
records in a lively narrative the services rendered by him-
self and his companions in spreading the cult of WAGNER
both in and out of Germany. NEUMANN, who began as an
opera singer, combined considerable business aptitude with
a great deal of genuine enthusiasm—indeed, when it came to
bargain-driving, we feel that he was distinctly inferior to
WAGNER. The story of their temporary estrangement and
reconciliation throws a somewhat painful light on the
colossal egotism of the “Bayreuth Colossus,” as musical
critics delight to call him. Miss Edith LiverMoRE has done
her work as translator in competent fashion, and the book is
enriched with some good illustrations, notably a fine portrait
of HEDwig REICHER-KINDERMANN, whose early death, when
at the height of her fame, was due, like that of MALIBRAN,
to her own reckless and self-sacrificing spirit. The progress
of WAGNER reminds one not a little of that of the Car of
Juggernauth. His devotees prostrated themselves befor
him, and were occasionally crushed by his genius. -

THE JERRY-BUILDER'S BUDGET.
[Under the provisions of Mr. Lloyd-GEORGE's Budget, any owner of
a garden of more than one acre in an urban neighbourhood is to be
suspected of attempting to “create a speculative inflation of values
which is socially mischievous.” Beyond the one acre his garden, as
“not being used to the best advantage,” will, in addition to the present
rates and taxes chargeable on a residential assessment, be taxed on
its capital value as an eligible site for rows of shops or villas, unless
the owner throws it open to the public to picnic in.]
I HAVE a little garden glade
Shelt, red and green and fair,
And elms that throw a pleasant shade
To cool the summer air;
Hard by, the town folk make a dust,
But you would never guess
What peace is here—and only just
Two acres, more or less.
Below the terrace lies the lawn
With chestnut-shadows shot,
Where roses take the dews of dawn,
And pale forget-me-not,
And there are winding ways that steal
To sudden ivied bowers,
So screened and close they scarcely feel
The touch of winter hours.
And then I have, for ease of heart,
An allée where I go
To think of things and pace apar
Leisurely to and fro; -
Yew-hedges flank my grassy space,
And at the blossoms' prime
I hardly know a nicer place
For getting words to rhyme.
This was my kingdom, where I ranged
Lord of my tiny lands, -
But all, it seems, will soon be changed
Under the spoiler's hands;
Mine was an Eden ere the fall,
Unsoiled of snakes and sin;
Now comes the worm and wants to call
The jerry-builder in.
“One acre you may keep,” says GEORGE,
“ (Such is my generous plan),
I}ut all the rest shall go to gorge
The bricks-and-mortar man.”
“ Unless your leafy place,” says Lloyd,
“(Such are my liberal views),
Be opened to the unemployed
To wallow where they choose.
“Otherwise on your purse the fell
Swoop of my fist shall come,
Treating you just like those who sell
Whiskey and gin and rum;
And you must cut your timber or
Let run your plot to weeds,
To make, or save, the money for
Afforestation's needs !”
Well, I must grin and pay my fine
To suit the Georgian taste,
And somehow keep my garden mine,
Though it were bare and waste.
No tinker here shall fake his huts
To squeeze my quiet chalet;

Little Arthur. Uncle John, may I ask you some questions?
Uncle John. Any amount, my boy. Just you fire ahead.
My time 's yours, you know.
L. A. Thank you, Uncle John. You're quite sure you
don't mind 2. - -
U. J. Lord bless you, no, I don't mind.
to do for a minute or two. - -
L. A. Shall you have a great deal to do after that, Uncle 2
U. J. After what? - -
L. A. After you've answered my questions. -
U.J. Oh, I don't know. There's the dog ; he'll want a
bit of a run. And then there'll be lunch, and just the
slightest map after lunch—good for the health, you know,
Arty; and I might put in a round of golf; and then there's
tea and so on. I daresay I shall worry through the day all
right. - -
L. A. Yes, Uncle, I am sure you will. -
U. J. And I’ll tell you what, my lad of wax, if you're a
good boy you shall help me to knock the balls about on the
billiard-table after tea. Capital thing for the hand and eye.
L. A. Oh, thank you, Uncle, that's very good of you. But
I'm afraid I must have my German lesson after tea.
U. J. Oh, German, is it? Capital thing. Tackle the
KAISER when you're grown up. You stick to it, my boy.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, I mean to. But, Uncle John
U. J. Yes, Sonny, what is it 2
L. A. I suppose you do a great
don't you ?
U.J. Well, my boy, I don't exactly overdo it, you know,
but I manage to rub along. Besides, I did my little bit {
when I was in the regiment, so I'm entitled to take a rest.
L. A. Yes, Uncle. But Papa says the country is being
ruined by so many idle men. He says everybody ought to
be up and doing ; and if we don't all show ourselves willing
to work we shall be left behind in the race.
U. J. Oh, he said that, did he And quite right, too.
I'm all for it. Nothing like work. That's what I told 'em
when they came to me about the unemployed. But it's no
good giving 'em work, I said ; they won't do it. Loafing's
what they want to do, and that's the long and short of it.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, I see. Then you think some people may
loaf and others mustn't 2
U. J. Well, ah, I'm not so sure of that.
hold with loafing.
L. A. But you think when people have done a little bit
they’re entitled to a rest.
U. J. Oh, yes, that’s right enough.
L. A. Ought they to rest a long time, Uncle?
U.J. No, I'm not for giving 'em too much holiday. A
day or two here and there, and then at it again. That's my
notion.
L. A. Yes, I see. May I ask you a question, Uncle?
U. J. I said you might. Out with it. -
L. A. Isn't it a long time since you left the regiment,
Uncle? -
U. J. Eight years.
L. A. And when you were in the regiment, Uncle, I
suppose you worked frightfully hard 2
U.J. Well, I don't know about “frightfully,” but we had
to buck up a bit.
L. A. Then you didn't spend most of your time in
hunting and shooting and steeple-chasing and having leave,
did you, Uncle 2

No, I can't say I

PRACTICE BEGINS.
L. A. It was something I heard Mamma say to Papa the
other day. She said you always were a champion at that
kind of thing.
U.J. Did she now? I never knew I had such an un-
grateful sister. But I daresay there's a spice of truth in it.
All work and no play, you know, makes Jack a dull boy.
L. A. Yes, uncle, I quite see that; and of course you
didn't want to be a dull boy. But it's eight years since you
left the regiment.
U.J. Yes.
L. A. Isn't eight years a very long time, Uncle?
U.J. Deuced long. You're right there.
L. A. But you said just now you weren't for giving people
too much holiday—only a day or two here and there.
U. J. Yes, that 's the ticket.
L. A. But, Uncle, you've had eight years, haven't you ?
And you said eight years was deuced long-so you've had a
deuced long holiday.
U.J. Now look here, my boy. I never said anything of
the kind.
L. A. Oh, yes, Uncle, you did. You said you had done
your little bit in the regiment, and you were entitled to take
a rest. And then you said—
U.J. So that's your game is it, you young ragamuffin,
You've been trying to trip up your Uncle, have you ?
L. A. Oh, Uncle, I'm sure I didn't wish to do that. Only
I wanted to understand what Papa meant about idle people
ruining the country, and——
U.J. Oh, I daresay, I daresay—but I'm off now. Haven't
any more time. Letters to write, you know, and all that.
So long, Arty.

“I am worried, WILLUR; I'm thinking of what we’ve told
them. I guess we'll have to answer for it in the hereafter.”
“Nonsense! All you told them was that they were hospit-
able. What's wrong with that ?”
“I was thinking more of what you told them, WiLDUR,”
replied ORVILLE with a sigh. “You’ll remember you said
that as aeroplanists they had everything before them.”
“And a darn long way, too, Onville. What's wrong with
that ? Go on; you haven't struck a falsehood yet.”
“What about ‘You can go ahead with every confidence'?
Wii BUR, do you think 11
“That's right enough. Of course they can go ahead ||
with every confidence; but once they begin going upwards,
there are risks, and it's not for me to encourage them to go
any way but ahead.”
“I see. I am less uneasy now, Wii.I.U.R. And when you
said of the ground at Sheppey, “If a man cannot fly there he
never will fly," did you mean—”
“Just what I said. I could have said the same thing of
Hyde Park or the Strand building sites; there's plenty of
air over both of them, ORville. Only being at Sheppey I
said it of Sheppey.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LATEST DEPUTATION.
PARTICULARs have just come to hand of
a very interesting interview last week
between the Editor of The Times and a
number of ladies and gentlemen. The
subject under discussion was the advisa-
bility of establishing on the first page of
The Times a section entitled Forthcoming
Birthdays, which should announce a
few days before the event the proximity
of these important festivals, for, as the
spokesman, a young Kensington gentle-
man of three, pointed out, as things
now stand it is too easy, owing to a
defective parental intelligence depart-
ment, for every one to know of the near-
ness of a birthday; and it often happens
that the first intimation to one's friends
arrives, as in a recent tragic instance,
after the event. (Cries of “Shame!”)
There were, of course, some persons
base enough, mean enough, to prefer
such a state of affairs (Tumult); but, on
the other hand, there were nice people.
(Cheers.) It was for the nice people
that this column would be instituted.
The Editor having inquired as to the
actual working of the scheme, the fol-
lowing propositions were offered. The
title being “Forthcoming Birthdays,”
each entry should refer to a birthday to
be celebrated on that day week. This,
it was pointed out, would give time.
The rate of payment, it was suggested,
should be low. The accounts to be
paid by fathers.
Asked to provide a specimen adver-
tisement, the leader of the deputation
produced the following:—
“On May 15, Master Herbert Willington Blan-
tyre, of 93, Orme Square, W., will be six.
Friends kindly accept and make a note of this
intimation.”
That is the simplest form. But
amendments are possible, such as, for
example, indications of the advertiser's
taste. Thus:
“N.B.-H. W. B. has a model railway, but it
still wants signals.”
And again there might be a guiding
word or two on the other side, with a
parental inspiration, such as:
“No sweets, by request.”
The Editor having stated that he
would confer with the Advertisement
Manager and see what could be done,
the ãº withdrew and sorted
itself out among its nurses.

Now we know why we heard a man say,
“Lloyd-George be blowed ' " the other

The stirney Chinners pageant.
The present sporting production of
Shakspearean plays without accessories
seems to have the approval of the Bard
himself, for he is taking part, in person,
at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in a
pageant for which the irreducible mini-
mum has been expended on costumes
and scenery. The average price of the
dresses, we are told, was only a crown-
piece, and even this figure would have
been considerably lower but for the
regal splendour—and thoroughly well
she deserved it—of Queen Elizabeth's
apparel.
Very bravely and intelligently, and
with a delightful freedom from self-
consciousness, the scholars of Stepney
played their parts in the pageant of
Boadicea, in contempt of Suetonius Paulinus,
takes a poison-pill, with the idea of “dying still
a Queen.”
London's history, from Saxon ANSGAR to
FRANCIS DRAKE, from BoADICEA to the
Blind Beggar's Daughter of Bethnal
Green. We had no use for a prompter
with everybody knowing everybody
else's part as well as his own. There
were occasional diversions not allowed
for in the book, such as the lapse of
the villainous Longchamp's moustache,
shortly after Prince John had bade
him “Begone, ere we regret our cle-
mency; ” but the spirit of humour was
so strong among the child actors (notably
the boy who played Gurth) that they
could well afford a little merriment pro-
voked without design. -
I hardly suppose that the children of
Whitechapel who played in this pageant
were much less instructed in their parts
beforehand than most of the grown-ups
who get by heart the matter for other
pageants; but I can imagine no better
soil in which to sow the seed of citizen-
ship and patriotism than the hearts of
these keen young Londoners.
I present my most cordial compliments
to Mr. Louis PARKER, Pageant-maker-
Extraordinary to the British Nation, who
can never have had material more
interesting to work upon ; to Mr. F. P.
HARVEY DARTON, Vice-master of the Cere-
monies; to Miss RosaBEL WATSON, Con-
ductor of the Orchestra; to Mr. G. K.
MENziEs and the other authors of a
libretto distinguished not only by ex-
cellent taste but also by a lucidity and
directness very proper to its purpose ;
and finally, to whoever was responsible
for some very dainty dances—morris
and other—which added charm and
gaiety to a performance always pictu-
resque and needing no incidental dis-
traction to save it from dulness.
The pageant will be repeated at
7 P.M. on the 12th, 13th, 17th, 18th,
19th and 20th. Applications for tickets,
which are free, should be made to the
Secretary, Whitechapel Art Gallery,
High Street, Whitechapel, E. O. S.
WORDS IN THE DOCK.
II.
IN opening the case against “In
truth" the Public Prosecutor strongly
protested against the odious innuendo
involved in the use of these words by a
publicist or editor, the suggestion being
that his opponents dealt in falsehood or
fiction. Besides it was admittedly a
blunder to protest too much; and to say
continually “I’m telling you the truth,”
excited suspicion. Mr. JAMEs, the eminent
novelist, never styled himself “Truthful
JAMES,” and he certainly didn't suffer
in persuasiveness for his reticence.
Counsel concluded a brilliant address by
reminding the Court that a great Irish-
man had said that he had “far too great
a regard for the truth to be dragging
her out on every paltry occasion.”
The Editor of The Spectator, called
for the defence, said that the incrimi-
nated words were very good friends of
his, and had frequently assisted him in
trying circumstances. Occasions arose
in which it was the painful duty of a
writer to insist on the obvious, and to
resist the temptation to indulge in
paradox. He was continually, and he
trusted successfully, restraining the ten-
dency to be witty.
Cross-examined, the Editor of The
Spectator said that when he relied on
the defendants he did not invariably
endorse statements which appeared in
Mr. LABOUCHERE's organ.
At this stage of the proceedings some
commotion was caused by a Member of
Parliament rising at the back of the
Court and shouting out in impassioned
accents, “J'accuse.” He was promptly

silenced, and, on being reminded that
the phrase in question had been used
by the late M. Zol.A, fell into a profound
swoon. The prisoners were subsequently
sentenced not to be heard in Wellington
Street for the space of six months.
The next case was that of “Frankly,”
an insinuating adverb whose conduct
in literary and dramatic circles of late
had, so it was urged, become a serious
nuisance and even a danger to the com-
munity.
Counsel for the prosecution in an
emotional speech contended that the
aggressive appearance of “frankly” in
this context was an affront to good sense
and the fitness of things, as it was
perfectly motorious that literary and
dramatic critics never were frank. The
could not earn a livelihood if they were.
The greatest living novelist—whose
name he abstained from mentioning
solely in deference to her detestation of
publicity—had exposed their Machiavel-
lian treachery again and again, but
without result. It was to be hoped that
The nearest that he came to it was in
the phrase franchement canaille, which
he had applied to the performance of a
famous French comédienne.
The Daily Chronicle, summoned to give
evidence as to character on behalf of the
prisoner, said that he had the highest
opinion of him, and found him in-
valuable in opening the second para-
graph of an unfavourable review of a
k or play; as for example, “Frankly,
this sort of thing won't quite do nowa-
days.”
Mr. MASSINGHAM, on the other hand,
said he had no use for otiose adverbs.
|It was the duty of a critic to be frank,
not to say that he was frank.
The prisoner was ordered to be
deported to America.
Finally came “Minor,” the principal
witness against whom was Mr. WiLLIAM
WATson. The word, he said, was a
danger to Society, in that it aroused the
worst passions of all poets whenever it
was used in connection with them. To
Mr. Itobert DONALD, the Editor of
the present action would finally and irre- call a man a minor poet was more
vocablyannihilate this ghastly imposture. offensive than to call him a coward.
Mr. A. B. WALKLEY, who was called Poetry was poetry and poets were poets.
by the prosecution, said (through the (Ironical cheers.) Such empty-heads as
interpreter) that he never used the word. I those now cheering were the employers
of the rascal “Minor.” He was their
friend. (Riot.)
Other witnesses for the prosecution
were Mr. John LANE and Mr. FIRANCIS
CouTTs.
The Editor of The Westminster Gazette
was subpoenaed for the prosecution, but
his evidence tended rather to the de-
fence. He found “Minor,” he said, a
useful fellow. All poets were not of
equal genius ; why not distinguish *
For his part he would, however, agree
to drop “minor,” but only on condi-
tion that he might say “first class” or
“second class,” or some such phrase.
At this point Mr. WILLIAM WATSON's
language became so virulent that the
proceedings terminated in an uproar.
“Oh, j'aime les Militaires.”
“A large crowd cheered the ladies [Yeomanry
nurses] who presented a very fine and marital
appearance, and attracted a good deal of a ten-
tion.”—Sunday Chronicle.

MR. PUNCH'S BUDGET.
[Mr. Punch prints a few examples of the sort
of letter which is now arriving daily at his
office.]
The Eyrie, Tooting.
DEAR OLD PUNCH,-My income is £700
per annum, and my wife has an allow-
ance of £100 from her father. I have
two boys under sixteen and one dog
over sixteen, together with an adopted
niece of fourteen ; we have a garden of
three acres, including a small pond, into
which there is reasonable access—in
fact all the children fell into it yesterday
in the search for ungotten minerals. I
have a horse whose horse-power is 1,
and I smoke three ounces of tobacco a
week. What was the name of the
scholar—I mean what is the amount of
my new taxation ?
Yours to a cinder,
GEORGE KEATs.
[When a niece falls in, the landlord pays
ten per cent. on the increased value. The
Editor cannot work out the rest of the problem
now, but he believes the correct answer is that
peacocks don't lay eggs.]
The Snuggery, Bedford Park.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Will you use the
influence of your great paper to remedy
a crying scandal? My uncle died last
October and left me all his money, some
six hundred a year. When alive he
resided at Shepherd's Bush ; and on
two evenings a week for ten years I
used to go down there to see him. No
smoking was allowed in his house, and
nothing stronger than sherbet. For
three hours after dinner I had to read
aloud to him—Times leaders and things
of that kind. Sundays too I generally
spent with the old man; that meant
sermons in the morning and a little
bath chair exercise in the afternoon.
Yet, will you believe it, instead of
letting me pay 9d. tax on my new income
(well-earmed), this detestable Govern-
ment insists that I should pay 1s. 2d. 1
Yours disgustedly,
GUY Pot'ſs.
P.S. You might care to print the en-
closed small contribution. If so, you
had better sign it “Gypots” – my
pseudonym in the Bedford Park Mes-
senger.
[The Editor of Punch begs to offer Mr. Potts
his sympathy and one of his rejection forms.]
31, Grosvenor Square, Balham.
MY DEAR SIR,--I have a daring sugges-
tion for a cartoon which, if it appeared
in your paper, would create an immense
stir throughout the length and breadth
of England, and might indeed give the
death-blow to this hated Government.
I regret that I am unable to draw it for
you myself, but no doubt you have an
artist on your staff who could execute
my idea.
It is simply this. Draw LLOYD-GEORGE
as a repulsive footpad holding up John
Bull with the words, “It’s your money
I want.” BALFour, who is standing by
dressed as a policeman, says threaten-
ingly, “Ah! You wait !” Other
policemen might be represented by
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, Bon AR LAw, and so
on, together with P. S. Fosteſt, in a very
new uniform, showing that he has only
just been elected. Asquith and WIN-
STON might be a little way behind LLOYD-
GEORGE. Over the whole scene the
brooding spirit of NELSON looks down
and says, “Alas, my country !”
This may be considered severe, but if
it were well drawn it would, I think, be
very effective, and might encourage the
House of Lords to throw out the Budget.
Awaiting your reply, I am, etc.,
ERNEST TOOTLE.
[The Editor of Puneh is afraid that Mr.
Tootle's cartoon is a little too strong to use at
present, but he will keep it in reserve and
employ it at the last moment if all else fails.
What lovely weather How are Mr. Tootle's
sweet peas getting on ?]
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Doubtless you have
read the letter of Mr. W. W. AshLEY,
M.P., to the Superintendent of some
Poor Children's Home, regretting that
the increased taxes absolutely prevent
him from sending a subscription. The
benevolences and (alas!) anticipated
poverty of Mr. ASHLEY are matters of
world-wide interest; so it was only
right that his letter should have been
made public. What I want to suggest
now is that you should start a fund to
take over all his charities, until such
time as the Tories come back to power?
For this purpose I have much pleasure
in enclosing a cheque for a guinea.
X, Y, Z.
P.S. These are not my real initials,
but I desire to remain anonymous. .
[Unfortunately X.Y.Z.'s cheque has remained
anonymous too.—Editor.]
The Crow's Nest, Surbiton.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I must tell you of
a joke my little girl Gladys (aged 8)
made this morning. She was helping
me in the kitchen, and watching Berke-
ley (our maid), who was trying to unscrew
the bottle of stout which I always take
with my lunch. After trying a long
time Berkeley said, “It’s no good, mum,
I can't budge it.” Little Gladys im-
mediately turned to me with a smile and
said, “I expect Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE could,
Mamma.” She must have heard her
father and me talking about the Bud-
get (!) Was it not clever of her? I am
sure that with a picture this would
appeal to your readers, particularly to
those who have children of their own.
Gladys is a sweet fair - haired little
thing, and was wearing a navy-blue
serge frock—I enclose a photograph of
us both taken last month, for the
guidance of your artist. Berkeley is
rather short and has not much figure.
You might word it like this :
LLOYD-GEORGE TO THE RESCUE
Berkeley (unscrewing bottle of stout
for her mistress's lunch). It's no good,
mum, 1 can't budge it.”
Gladys (aged 8). I expect Mr. LLoyd-
GEORGE could, Mamma!
|Merriment of Mamma.
If you cannot get this drawn at your
office I daresay Gladys could make you
a little picture of the scene. I may say
that I shall put whatever you send me
in her little money-box.
Yours very sincerely,
(Mrs.) H. Q. PLIM.
[The Editor of Punch presents his compliments
and begs to return the beautiful photograph of
Gladys's two elder sisters, which appears to
have been sent in error. Unfortunately he has
a ready accepted a joke on the subject of the
Budget, so that he is unable to use Gladys's de-
lightfully humorous legend. Should she, how-
ever, devise sºme equally witty impromptu on
the occasion of Mr. Lloyd-George's next Budget
the Editor hopes that he will be allowed to
hear of it.]
SIR,--I am a widow with an unearmed
income of £205. I live alone with Betsy
(my pug) and Jane (my faithful old
servant). Now this mercenary Govern-
ment seeks to impose an additional tax
of 2d. in the pound upon me. If it is
allowed to do this I shall be compelled
to dismiss my faithful companion, Jane
(who will in consequence be thrown upon
the rates), and eke out a miserable exist-
ence with my poor dog. A Widow.
[An extra 2d. on the £45 which pays income
tax comes to 78. 6d. a year. As an alternative,
therefore, “A Widow" might dismiss Betsy,
who would be thrown into a Dog's Home, and
eke out a miserable existence with poor Jane.

This being the season for new clothes,
let me say that there is nothing better and
cheaper than the stock now to be seen
at Messrs. Attalow Price & Co.'s, in Bond
Street. No woman who wishes to make
other women turn round in the street
(and is there a nobler ideal among the
Smart Set?) can afford to neglect Messrs.
Attalow Price's hats. Let them be sure
to ask for the Salome chip straw, which
would work havoc, I am sure, even
among Baptists, and is really bon
marché at 8 guineas untrimmed, and 15
with ribbon. I have two.
“Clothes and the Man.”
Male costume may be thought to be a
little off my beat, and indeed it is, but
if 1 see in the shops, a pair of trousers
I have got to write about them, or what
becomes of my title? Well, I have seen
some, and I wish, entirely without pre-
judice, to praise them and to advise
dressy men to go nowhere else for their
trousseaux. The best trousers I have
ever seen, or rather the best trousers I
have seen since last week's paper came
out, are those made by Button and
Stitch, of Houndsditch. It is not, I am
aware, a fashionable quarter, but Messrs.
B. & S.'s clients have to remember that
what Messrs. B. & S. save in rent they
put into the article. Thir being so, why
assist the Savile Row tailor in paying
his rent when, by taking a little longer
in getting to the City, you can attain
a really better material and better cut?
To improve on an old saying, “Men are
curious kittle cattle,” and surely in no
way, is their eccentricity more firmly
established than in the matter of clothes.
Whatever be their occupation or pursuit
they must be clad in the prescribed
uniform. The golfing man must have
his regulation kit, the cricketer and
spectator at Lord's his flannels, the
dentist or society man or Cabinet Minis-
ter his frock coat and top hat, the artist
his lounge suit, the music-hall singer
his rags, and so on throughout the
whole of life's busy round and common
task, and any man reversing the recog-
nised order of things immediately calls
for derision and amusement. No one
can make them (this week) like Messrs.
ºn and Stitch. But next week?
(No more of this, however.—Ed.)
Vanity Fair on “The Devil.”
P. 517: “We found it excellent . . . most
interesting from start to finish ... the play
and the acting were both admirable.”
P. 532: “Simply silly and stupid. . . the
dramatis personae are puppets; the person
who pulls the strings is a bungler; and there
is in short nothing in the play.”
We agree cordially with Vanity Fair.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 3.
—“Reminds me of Agincourt on the
eve of the battle,” said the MEMBER FOR
SARK, glancing round the lists. “Al-
most one hears
“The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadſul note of preparation.’
‘The royal captain of this ruined band’
—I mean PRINCE ARTHUR, in command of
the decimated Opposition predestined to
rout—seems pretty fit.”
“Think! oh, think, of the market gyal-
dener!, (Aside, sotto, roce) I never thought of
him before, but oh! how pathetic it sounds !”
House just got into Committee of
Ways and Means. First round in the
great Budget fight. PRINCE ARTHUR
promptly leads off. His rising greeted
with storm of cheers and counter cheers
that truly indicates strained relations of
parties. Opposition mean business.
Resigned unto the heavenly will in the
matter of monotonous defeat in Division
Lobbies, they will still carry it on, dis-
puting every foot of advance of Finance
Bill through Committee.
Notable change in aspect of two Front
Benches. At ordinary times entrance
upon business of day is signal for flight
of Ministers and ex-Ministers. One in
charge of measure to the fore keeps his
place, assisted by a junior colleague,
occasionally supported by that Minis-
terial man-of-all-work, the ATToRNEY-
GKNERAL. The rest flee to their private
rooms, in whose seclusion they are under-
stood to attack arrears of office work.
This afternoon both Front Benches
remain full, the occupants intent obser-
vers of the tactics governing opening of
attack.
PRINCE ARTHUR evidently bestowed
exceptional pains on preparation of
his speech. Magnificently scornful in
denunciation of what he calls “the
electioneering manifesto” that prefaced
delivery of Budget speech. To delight
of Opposition, drags in HENRY GEORGE.
At first there was a shocked feeling of
breach of Order, doubtless inadvertently
committed, accompanied by accidental
miscalling of Christian names. The
name of the CHANCELLOR of THE EXCHEQUER
just now in everyone's mouth. Had
PRINCE ARTHUR, not specially notable for
accuracy of detail, made a slip and called
him HENRY 2 This takes much longer to
explain than it did to flash through the
minds of Members. The point suggested
with studied innocence was quickly
seized and greeted with shout of boister-
ous laughter.
“Mr. HENRY GEORGE,” he continued
when silence was restored, “held that
possession of all land was intrinsically
robbery, and that it ought to be taken
away without compensation to existing
owners. That is a fairly coherent sys-
tem; but what on earth lies at the
bottom of the system of Mr. HENRY
GEORGE's great namesake?”
In the course of speech History, after
its occasional manner, repeated itself.
Pursuing his argument, denouncing the
treatment of landed property by the
Budget, PRINCE ARTHUR, looking among
his papers, found he had forgotten a par-
ticular sheet setting forth figures which,
if cited, would establish his case. Eighty
years ago ALTHORP (forbear of present
Earl SPENCER) found himself, when
addressing House as Chancellor of
Exchequer, in the same predicament.
He apologised for the accident, but
assured Members that he had studied
the figures, that they led to a certain
conclusion, which he hoped would be
accepted on his personal declaration.
Unconsciously PRINCE ARTHUR, in like
predicament, paraphrased the appeal,
and by a ready cheer received the same
tribute of confidence and acquiescence.
Business done.—Got into Committee
on Budget Resolutions.
Tuesday.—“This is not an ordinary
debate,” remarked Mr. PRETYMAN, rising
to resume discussion in Committee on
Budget scheme. “It is one of the most
momentous issues ever presented for the
consideration of Parliament.”
Whereupon Members on both sides
with one accord strolled out to gossip on
the Terrace, write letters or read the
evening papers. 'Twas ever thus. They
will sit out a debate running through a
single sitting. When it comes to allo-
cation of several nights to a particular
subject, howsoever important, they
|straightway flee.
For some hours to-
might, whilst speech followed speech,
not all as good as PRETY MAN's, the House
would have been counted out had the
doors been closed against temporary
influx of idlers from without.
Filled up when at half-past nine
word went round that the CHANCELLOR
of THE Exchequer was up. To the close
of sitting PRINCE ARTHUR was among the
absentees. This a pity, since some of
the pointed passages of the speech of
“HENRY GEORGE's great namesake” were
directed to reply to his speech of last
night.
The “BIRD-NESTER” in Bonhowed PLUMAGE.
Mr. Lloyd-George in Mr. Chaplin's clothes.
[“While the chairman of the Agricultural
Committee of the Tariff Commission was bath-
ing in the still waters of Tariff Reform, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, lurking, I suppose,
somewhere on the bank º; probably
on a bird-nesting expedition (laughter), sud-
denly came across the right hon. gentleman's
clothes (laughter), and being, as everybody
knows, a man of predatory disposition, at once
took possession of them, and we may assume
that in the privacy of his own home he tried
them on, and he appeared in them here on
Budget night (loud laughter). Cou'd you have
better or more cogent reason for a Develop-
ment Grant? (roars of laughter).”—Mr. Asquith.]
House glad to find the CHANCELLOR in
something of his old form. Itelieved of
the burden of multitudinous manuscript,
he spoke for an hour and a-half, briskly
replying to criticisms raised through
two nights' debate. At one stage he
brought SoN AUSTEN up with angry

repudiation of what seemed an innocent
remark. Referring to the Conservative
Party in the Reichstag, he asked
whether the Opposition were aware
of legislative action in respect of land
taken by “their own party in Germany.”
“We have no party in Germany,”
SoN AUSTEN, amid loud laughter, angrily
declared. Lloyd-GEORGE smiled across
the Table with paternal tenderness, as if
addre-sing a naughty boy who had put
his fingers in the jam-pot.
“Whatever effect the Budget may
have on property,” he said, “it seems to
have had disastrous effect on the right
hon. gentleman's sense of humour. I
am not sure it was ever very strong, but
it is completely shattered.”
This did not improve matters. Oppo-
sition angrily cheered. Ministerialists
uproariously laughed. A prolonged
scene appeared imminent. But the
storm fell as suddenly as it had burst,
and Members in whispered conversation
asked what it had all been about.
Business done. — Budget in Com-
mittee.
Thursday.—Mr. Dobson does not know
what is the proper thing to do in the
circumstances. They are certainly odd.
Among questions on the paper one
standing in the name of Mr. Joyce in-
vited ADMIRAL McKENNA to state whether
his attention has been called to the fact
that it is more than thirty years since
certain reaches of the River Shannon
have been surveyed, with the conse-
quence that, owing to changes taking
place, existing charts have become un-
reliable. The ADMIRAL having made
answer, up rose Mr. Joyce, and in thun-
derous tones further enquired :
“Will the right hon. gentleman say
who carried out the first soundings 2 "
Quick came reply from neighbour-
hood of the Table.
“Mr. DOBSON.”
The Member for Croydon audibly
gasped. The assertion was absolutely
groundless. His private business lies
wholly apart from the profession of a
surveyor. As a matter of fact he has
never seen the Shannon. For a moment
the House shared his perplexity. Then
explanation flashed upon it, and a burst
of laughter greeted the unpremeditated
ioke.
J It was not the ADMIRAL who had made
reply. It was the SPEAKER, ignoring
Joyce's supplementary question, calling
by name the Member next on the list of
questions.
Assisted to his feet by those sitting
near him, Mr. Dodson, in reply to the
SPEAKER's call, named the number of his
question. But he remains in state of
bewilderment, undetermined whether
the House really understands that he
had nothing to do with the survey of
the Shannon, or whether, in justice to
himself and his constituents, he ought
to make a personal statement.

OF far more interest than the views
expressed by mere party organs on Mr.
LLOYD - GEORGE's financial schemes is
the verdict of the independent Press, as
represented by papers whose concern
with politics is either accidental or sub-
sidiary. Thus:—
“The effect of this extraordinary
Budget on English trade is bound to be
depressing in the extreme. . . . Mr.
LLoyd-GEORGE has set a premium on
living for ever, and it remains to be
seen whether his attempt to impose on
us the habit of athanasia will go down
with the country.”—The Undertakers'
Gazette.

ful document been compiled.” — The

“An excellent story is going the
rounds about the childhood of Mr. D.
Lloyd-GEORGE, who (as Chancellor of the
Exchequer) is responsible for the Budget
now before the House of Commons.
Years ago the budding politician was
walking in the streets of Carnarvon
when he was threatened by an older and
larger boy. “My name is David,” said
the embryo statesman, standing his
ground firmly ; “have you ever heard
what happened to GoLIATH 2." His
oppressor (runs the story) was so dis-
comfited that he incontinently de-
camped."—Smacks.

EN ATTEND ANT.
DEAR Sir, I beg that you will glance
At these few brief remarks from France.
The falser forms of British pride
It is my boast to set aside:
I find I like, upon the whole,
To breakfast merely on a roll;
I also like the early lunch,
And tolerate a tardy Punch ;
The weather too is often fine,
And one appreciates the wine;
The crossing never makes me ill;
I am, in fine, a Francophil.
Let me then now without restraint
I’roceed to air my one complaint.
There is a virtue which I lack:
I never yet have learnt to pack.
When I get here I often note
With grief the absence of a coat;
I often leave Southampton (Hants)
Without sufficient change of pants.
On landing then I send a wire
For all the things I most desire,
And these are soon upon their way,
But do they reach me quickly? Nay.
For weeks and weeks I linger here
And still the things do not appear.
In France, Sir, what is needed most
Is an efficient Parcel Post.

Newmarket, has arranged an exchange of en-
cumbrances with the Rev. E. A. Moxon, Vicar

THE PENALTIES OF OFFICE.
A New TERROR For MiNisTERs' Wives.
The searchings of the Nonconformist
conscience are vividly illustrated in the
“Problems of Conduct” appearing week
by week in the British Weekly. Problem
No. 229 runs as follows:—
“Mr. and Mrs. Bryce, poor and proud,
have taken rooms for Whitsuntide at
C–. Mrs. Larraby, the Bryces' rich
neighbour, calls on Mrs. Bryce and hears
her plans, and Mrs. Bryce tells her where
they are going. On the morning of
starting Mrs. Bryce receives a letter from
the landlady saying the rooms have been
let to the Larrabys, who are paying
double what Mrs. Bryce offered for the
rooms. What should Mrs. Bryce do?”
The prize has been awarded to an
Edinburgh gentleman for the following
answer : —
. “Mrs. Bryce should suffer silently and
proceed to find fresh rooms. Remon-
strances are lost on unprincipled people,
and legal action is not for the poor and
proud.”
Further developments of this new
method of inquisition may be expected
on some such lines as the following:—

“Mr. and Mrs. McKENNA are staying
at Étretat for shrimping, a pastime to
which they are passionately addicted.
One fine day, while Mrs. McKENNA is
engaged in her favourite pursuit, a lady
whom she has never seen before ap-
proaches her with a sinister expression
and observes: “I see you can't get away

Mrs. McKenNA do?”
The prize, a volume of sermons by
Professor Septimus Bopp, has been
awarded to
ALBERT Goudif,
4, Pall Mall, Peebles,
for the following answer:-
“Mrs. McKENNA should swiftly remove
the shrimping net from the briny and
bring it down over the head of her
tormentor, twisting it tight round her
neck until she cries for mercy.”
Other solutions are as follows:–
“Mrs. McKENNA should say nothing,
but politely offer her interlocutor a
shrimp. By acting thus she would
inflict a much severer reprimand than
she could have done by any other means,
as her magnanimity would paralyse her
antagonist.”
“Mrs. McKENNA should plunge into
the sea and swim rapidly away from the
aggressive intruder.”
PROBLEM No. 236.

of a novel written by Mrs. Dorinda Boss,

ing a criticism. Mrs. Buxton thinks the
book absolute drivel but hesitates to say
so. Meanwhile a second letter arrives
from Mrs. Boss threatening, if the judg-
ment is not favourable, to make the Post-
MASTER-GENERAL the villain of her next
novel. What should Mrs. Buxton do?”
The prize, a copy of Cruden's Con-
cordance, bound in three-quarters levant,
has been awarded to
JoxAs PERRING,
Laburnum Villa, Swanage,
for the following answer:-
“Mrs. SYDNEY Buxton should promptly
telegraph that the novel eclipsed the finest
work of GEORGE SAND, Mrs. HUMPHRY
WARD and MARIE Coſtelli.”
Other solutions (the first containing
some jeur d'esprit of a ripe antiquity)
are as follows:–
“The most effective course of action
which Mrs. Buxton can adopt is to frame
a diplomatic answer which can be read
in two ways. For instance, she might
say that the novel possesses quite ex-
ceptional qualities, that she has never
read anything like it before, and that the
PostMASTER-GENERAI, intends to waste no
time in perusing it.”
“Mrs. Buxton should stick to her
guns, say that the book is drivel, and
defy Mrs. Boss to do her worst.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BILLY BARRINGTON'S MANOEUVRE.
[Being the first-fruits of the recent appoint-
ment of a scientilic Aviation Committee.]
BiLLY BARRINGTON, an impecunious but
impressionable subaltern in the Putty-
shires (“The Catch-'em-alive-oh's") had
encountered many damsels in the game
of love, but when he met May Maddison
he knew he was in for the final tie
which must end in the nuptial knot.
He proposed and was accepted with en-
thusiasm, and next morning popped and
twittered over on his motor-bicycle to
interview her father. Mr. Maddison was
grey haired but not gouty, and though
half Billy's size had twice his energy.
Besides, he had other ambitions for his
daughter, so he refused Billy's request.
At the same time he offered him a drink.
“No thanks,” said Billy; “but I may
as well tell you, if you won't give us
your permission we shall get married
without it.”
“Thirty years ago,” said Mr. Maddi-
son, “such a threat might have alarmed
me, because young men had both hardi-
hood and resource when I was a young
man, and now it seems the old ones
have got it all. I suppose you think
that anybody can steal a march on me
and take my daughter.”
“No, I don't,” said Billy; “but I
think I can.”
“You do, do you?' Well, I'll bet you
a thousand to one in sovereigns you
can't. Now here's a bargain —if during
the next seven days, in broad daylight,
say from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M., you can come
and take my daughter without me, I'll
give you permission to marry her at the
village church as soon as you like.” .
“Done,” said Billy. “I’ll go and
get a special licence.” , ,
The ancestral home of the Maddisons
was a lonely moated grange; the moat
was deep, the walls were high, and the
entrance was barred by a lofty iron gate
only opening from the inside. Mr.
Maddison regarded his position as almost
impregnable. “But to feel you are quite
safe, my dear,” he said to his daughter in
explaining matters, “I shall keep you
in sight from breakfast till dinner for a
week, at the end of which time you shall
have the young soldier's sovereign to
spend on chocolates, and I'll take you a
trip to Paris for a complete change of
air and costume.” - - *
Six days passed and no sign from
Billy. The morning of the seventh was
fair but chilly, and a girlish figure, in a
warm cloak and cap, might have been
seen reclining in a hammock under the
mulberry-tree by the arbour, while
Papa sat reading the morning paper
hard by.
“I fear,” he said, looking up, “that
your old man isn't going to have a
chance of showing his mettle after all.
I think your young one might have had
one try for you, my girl—but still, what
a lot of chocolates you'll be able to buy
for a sovereign ”
He paused, but there was no
from the hammock. * * -
“Crying again?” he said. “Well, I'm
cruel only to be kind; and now I'm
going to write my letters, including one
to The Times on the “Decay of the
British Army.” Mind you stay where
you are, my dear; ” and he went into the
library and took up his position at the
writing table in the window, from which
he could see his daughter still reclining
in her hammock. All of a sudden the
room became dark as the light from the
French-window was obscured by some
huge floating object. Mr. Maddison,
sprang to his feet as a military balloon
made a clever descent so close to the
mulberry-tree that, while one of the occu-
pants made fast to the branches, the other,
Billy himself, sprang out, and, seizing the
recumbent figure in the hammock, slung
her into the car just as her father leaped
through the library window and dashed
up to the spot. To seize Billy round
the waist, fling him aside, and jump
into the car to retrieve his daughter was
the work of a frenzied moment, the very
moment, in fact, in which the aeronaut
let go the branches. The balloon rose
slowly and steadily into the air; and
Mr. Maddison leaned back, too breath-
less to speak, but with a smile of
sárcastic triumph playing round his
twitching-lips. . . . - - -
“So you thought you'd done the old
man, did you?” he gasped out to the
aeronaut, whom he recognised as one of
Billy's particular pals. Billy's pal' gave
a sleepish smile, and nodded. “Oh,
you're very clever! you’re very smart ;
but not quite smart enough for me yet.
And as for you,” he added, turning to
his daughter, huddled up on the oppo-
site seat, “I’m surprised you haven't
too much feminine pride to submit to
being pitched about like a sack of pota-
toes—for that was for all the world what
you looked like.” - - - -
The crushed figure made no response,
but suddenly lurched forward as the
balloon swayed, and would have fallen
to the bottom of the car had not Mr.
Maddison caught it with sudden tender-
ness in his arms. - -
." Merciſul Powers! What is this?”
he roared, recoiling from his burden,
which consisted of a feather bolster
attired in his daughter's cloak and hat.
“Where's my daughter?” he thun-
dered. Billy's pal smiled more sheepishly
than ever, and pointed downward with
his thumb. Gingerly leaning over the
side, Mr. Maddison saw his daughter
emerge with Billy from the arbour
where she had been hiding after plant-
anSWel'
ing the dummy-substitute in the ham-
mock when her father returned to the
house. He saw their toy-like figures
hurry through the gate and down the
road to the village church. The girl
clung, drooping, to her lover, but as they
entered the sacred porch Billy looked up
and waved a cheery salute.
“I’m done : " said . Mr.
“I’m not up to your high-flown notions.
So let me down as gently as you can,
and as quickly, because I want to be the
first to wish them luck.” *
And so he was; and when later in
the day they started on their honeymoon
Billy had a cheque for a thousand
pounds in his pocket towards house-
keeping expenses. -

Painful Conversation.
OF my many virtues one stands out
supreme – the gift of aphasia. I am
much sought alter by garrulous hosts
and hostesses for their listening-parties
—I do it so well. It is a virtue, how-
ever, which brings its owner very little
satisfaction. , -
The person in whose company I feel at ||
the greatest disadvantage is Wrenchall.
I see him only occasionally, but I look
forward to our interviews just as any
other person would anticipate a visit to
a dentist. . .
- Wrenchall is really the most genial of
fellows. He welcomes me-as-kindly as
any man I know ; he insists on my
taking the most comfortable chair in the
room ; and with every effort to make me
feel at ease, he chats, away brightly
about the weather, the Navy,
the
holidays, his garden, and easy things
like that. But my tongue might be of
putty for all the contribution I can
make to the conversation. If bimetal-
lism or metaphysics or HERBERT SPENCER's
“Data of Ethics,” were the subjects in
hand I could not be more taciturn. The
fact is, Wrenchall is able to ally with
the simplest conversation such strength
of grip and penetration that a person
of timid build like myself is helpless.
He possesses irr sistible power
benumbing my brain and d adening
my, perception and sensibilities, and
once he has cast his spell over me he
contrives to extract from me only what
is bad. No man that I know of can
with such skill and withal such a genial
manner inake holes in me, if I may use
the expression. .
No, I never feel happy with Wrench-
all. I have said that I anticipate my
visits to him as another would regard a
visit to a dentist; and that, perhaps, is
not remarkable. For Wrenchall is my
dentist.

fairly describe as one of the times of
my life.

The death of Billy, the oldest sheep in

Among his many accomplishments, he
would stand perfectly still in a field at
the word of command, while his master
crouched down by his side and shot
at rabbits over his back.
Alas! our all-wool patriarch
Is gone; he was a sheep of mark,
Nearly an octonarian;
He never smoked, he drank no beer,
He lived, throughout his whole career,
A blameless vegetarian.
All Leicester, may, all England knew
No doggier sheep, no teg so true,
For sport a very glutton
As stalking-horse, he did his part
At putting rabbits in the cart,
And now he's dead as mutton'

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I think it would puzzle anybody to give an exact definition
of Mr. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM's creed on the evidence of his
last work, which he has entitled Faith (Duckworth). Its
outlook on life is obviously a little gloomy, but the contents
of his book would have been as aptly described if he had
called it Hope or Charity. Anyhow, I am satisfied that the
author's creed is not entirely pagan, for -
on page 160 the word Periphlegethon
occurs, and that would surely have got
itself corrected if he had felt any con-
suming interest in the classical abodes of
the dead. The volume consists of a series
of very short and very vivid sketches of
scenes and personalities, written in a
manner that suggests a study of 1)AUDET,
and set against various backgrounds, Spain,
Italy, Morocco, and South America, and
| one or two in the grey north. The longest,
and perhaps the most interesting, is that
which deals with the sunny (but otherwise
quite un-Cooked) territory of the Andorra
Republic. Mr. GRAHAM upholds his high
reputation—as the tailors say—for first-
class style (in spite of a rather annoying
trick of using similes that now and then
seem more ornamental than illustrative),
and if he intends to complete the trilogy
I shall anticipate the companions of Faith
with the greatest pleasure.
No doubt the title of Mr. SYDNEY C.
Gitieſt's new book, a tale of the “stirring
times” of the Peninsular War, is “rote sar-
castic.” Otherwise I don't see why he calls
| it A Young Man. Married (HUTCHINSON),
since it directly contradicts the sour dictum
of Parolles in All's Well that Ends Well
that “a young man married is a man
that's marred.” Lieut. Arthur Cinnamond,
“of the “—th,” was not marred but made by
his marriage with Doña Rosita de Lara, a
fugitive Spanish maiden who threw herself
on the tender mercies of the -th on the
morrow of the storming of Badajoz. Till
he fell in love with her, Arthur was rather
a poor steed, devoted, like Orpheus, to his
loot, and deep in the black books of Lord
| WELLINGTON. But with his donah's dear
hand in his he turned over a new leaf (with
the other), and became the very model of
a regimental officer. At first he didn't
score much by the change.

title, ends happily. But I don't think it shows Mr. Girit:R at
his best.
There are two things about The Trickster (PAUL), by Mr.
G. B. BURGIN, which I don't understand. Firstly, I do not
understand which person in it is the trickster, and, secondly,
I do not understand why the author should have wasted so
rare a melodramatic device as that dining-room built above a
well in which a plumber was once Crowned. Quite early in
the book he describes how this well is securely bricked over,
- - but I congratulated myself that this wasn't
going to deceive me. There would be, I
felt sure, a struggle in that dining-room,
and the brickwork would give way, and all
the bores in the story would be wiped out
at one fell scoop. This hope urged me to
give minute attention to many pages of
conversation which otherwise I might have
skipped. Every time anyone went into the
room I grasped the arms of my chair to
nerve me for the shock. But it never came.
The well remains bricked up, and finally
just an ordinary revolver removes the super-
fluous husband and gets the verbose lovers
together. Really, for theauthorof thirty-four
novels—I arrive at the figure after a careful
inspection of the fly-leaf-this is a little
disappointing. But perhaps the tragedy
of the well is reserved for the thirty-fifth.
Why Mr. George Soxies LAYARD named
his book War (GEORGE ALLEN) I failed to
understand until I found the heroine,
Christabel Lovett-Drown, taking refuge for
the night in Mme. Tussaud's. Christabel,
far from being alarmed, was “ripe for
adventure,” so when she saw John Serced,
a night-watchman (with a curious idea of
his duties), kneeling before MARY QUEEN of
Scots, and saying, “O Queen, deign to
look upon thy servant. I think I see
the life-blood coursing through thy veins,”
it was perhaps natural that she should
come to his assistance. At any rate she
impersonated MARY, and in spite of tile
fact that her fingers (which she allowed
him to kiss) “savoured of buns,” Screed
was supremely content to remain upon
his knees. I should think that Mr. LAY \to
must have smiled to himself when he
thought of this curious situation for his
heroine, and I congratulate him upon the
humour with which he describes it. In-
deed he is to be praised both for his sense
of style and his sense of comedy, and the
only fault I have to find with him is
that his villain is an anaemic creature,

give the young couple a very thin time. At the best, Iosita
was jogging uncomfortably after the army, perched on the
top of a baggage-wagon or rushing, like Fame, over the field
of battle in pursuit of Arthur, knowing that where the guns
were there “my Arturo" would be. At the worst, as igno-
rant of each other's whereabouts as the maid-servant in Mr.
HAwTREY's story was of her master's, they were engaged in a
hand-to-hand fight with her high-born but bad-mannered
| family, who bitterly resented her marriage with a heretic.
However, aſter many escapes, more hair-breadth than hair-
raising, lºosita was restored safe and sound to her Arturo's
arms, and the book, like the play from which it borrows its

Mr. CHARLEs JARROTT, his views on motor and petrol taxes:-
(1) In The Daily Chronicle: -
“I do not think that it is going to make an enormous difference to the
private motor owner . . . . . I don't suppose people are going to be
frightened off from buying motor cars.” -
(2) In The Daily Mail :
“I am so indignant that I find it difficult to express my opinions.
The impost will be absolutely disastrous.” - - -
We are glad to see that in spite of his indignation Mr.
JARROTT has already managed to express two opinions.

THE TRANSFORMATION.
[The Daily Chronicle has some encouraging remarks for those among
its readers who are suffering from imbecility. Our contemporary
recalls that Lockh ART wrote of SouthEY: “Afer his mind failed, his
hair, previously snow-white, thickened, curled and became perceptibly
darker.”] - -
I KNEW her in her palmy days;
No woman I have ever met
Had more of wit and charming ways
Than she-at five-and-forty nett;
Time, it is true, had leſt his trace.
On hair already white and waning,
Yet she preserved a youthful grace
I found extremely entertaining.
At dinner-parties (where, I hold,
One's object is to eat and drink)'
I like a neighbour not too old,
Who doesn't want to make you think;
But when with her I used to dine
My appetite was gladly wasted ;
Her sparkling wit was all my wine,
Her talk the only food I tasted.
I took her in the other night. -
Lord ' what a falling-off was there!
Her conversation, once so light,
Was heavier stuff than I could bear;
And while she babbled (tedious bore!)
About her Sex and Votes for Women,
I fed till I could feed no more, 3
And nearly drank enough to swim in.
Nor was this all. Another change S. º
The rolling years had ushered in : -
Something about her hair was strange,
Her hair that once was grey and thin;
Its ample curls, its coppery tone, “
Looked almost like a fresh creation;
I hardly knew it for her own,
So curious was the transformation.
Later I saw why this was so.
I thought of one, with mind unhinged,
And how his scant hair, white as snow,
Curled up in masses, darkly tinged;
These altered locks, this lapse of wit—
I saw exactly what the change meant:
Her mental balance—that was it—
Ilad undergone a rude derangement.

Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT in The Pall Mall Gazette denounces
Mr. A. B. WALKLEY and Mr. WiLLIAM ARCHER as “the two
most dangerous enemies of dramatic progress in the Press
to-day.” It is pleasant, however, to think that they manage
things better in the provinces. Thus we note that the
dramatic critic of The Manchester Guardian applauds Mr.
MASEFIFLD, the author of Nan, because “he neither gives
simple people strings of nubbly polysyllables to mouth, nor
the bastard semi-metrical stuff in which half our dramatists,
in scenes of attempted emotion, ape the dithering whine of
fiddlestrings that usually supports them on such occasions.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. *
A LITERARY LIGHT.
ANNESLEY BUPP was born one of the
Dupps of Hampshire—the Fighting
Bupps, as they were called. A sudden
death in the family left him destitute
at the early age of thirty, and he
decided to take seriously to journalism
for a living. That was eight years ago.
He is now a member of the Authors'
('lub; a popular after-dinner speaker in
reply to the toast of Literature; and
one of the best-paid writers in Fleet
Street. Who's Who tells the world that
he has a flat at Knightsbridge and a
cottage on the river. If you ask him to
what he owes his success he will assure
you, with the conscious modesty of all
great men, that he has been lucky;
pressed further, that Hard Work and
Method have been his watchwords. But
to the young aspirant he adds that of
course if you have it in you it is bound
to come Out.
I.
When Annesley started journalism he
realised at once that it was necessary
for him to specialise in some subject.
Of such subjects two occurred to him—
“George Herbert” and “Trams.” For
a time he hesitated, and it was only
the sudden publication of a brief but
authoritative life of the poet which led
him finally to the study of one of the
least explored of our transit systems.
Meanwhile he had to support himself.
For this purpose he bought a roll-top
desk, a type-writer, and an almanac;
he placed the almanac on top of the
desk, seated himself at the type-writer,
and began. -
It was the month of February; the
almanac told him that it wanted a week
to Shrove Tuesday. In four days he
had written as many articles, entitled
respectively Shroretide Customs, The
l’ancake, J.enten Observances, and Tues-
days Known to Fame. The Pancake,
giving as it did the context of every
reference in literature to pancakes, was
the most scholarly of the four; the
Tuesday article, which hazarded the
opinion that Rome may at least have
been begun on a Tuesday, the most
daring. But all of them were published.
This early success showed Annesley
the possibilities of the topical article; it
led him also to construct a revised
calendar for his own use. In the “Bupp
Almanac" the events of the day were
put back a fortnight; so that, if the
Feast of St. Simon and St. Jude fell
upon the 17th, Annesley's attention was
called to it upon the 3rd, and upon the
3rd he surveyed the Famous Partnerships
of the epoch. Similarly, The Origin of
Lord Mayor's Day was put in hand on
October 26th.
He did not, however, only glorify the
past; current events claimed their meed
of copy. In the days of his dependence
Annesley had travelled, so that he could
well provide the local colour for such
sketches as Kimberley as I Knew. It
(1901) and Birmingham by Moonlight
(1903). His Recollections of St. Peter's
at Rome were hazy, yet sufficient to
furnish an article with that title at the
time of the Coronation. But I must
confess that Dashes for the Pole came
entirely from his invaluable Encyclo-
padia . . . .
II.
Annesley Bupp had devoted himself to
literature for two years before his first
article on trams was written. This was
called Voltage, was highly technical, and
convinced every editor to whom it was
sent (and by whom it was returned) that
the author knew his subject thoroughly.
So when he followed it up with How
to be a Tram Conductor, he had the
satisfaction not only of seeing it in print
within a week, but of reading an editor-
ial reference to himself as “the moted
expert on our overhead system.” Two
other articles in the same paper—Some
Curious Tram Accidents and Tram or
Bus : Which 2–established his position.
Once recognised as the authority on
trams, Bupp was never at a loss for a
subject. In the first place there were
certain articles, such as Tramways in
1904, Progress of Tramway Construction
in the Past Year, Tramway Incentions of
the Last Twelremonth, and The Tram:
Its Future in 1905, which flowed an-
nually from his pen. From time to
time there would arise the occasion for
the topical article on trams–Trams as
Army Transports and How our Trams
fared during the Recent Snow, to give
two obvious examples. And always
there was a market for such staple
articles as Trams in I'iction . . . .
III.
You will understand, then, that by
the end of 1906 Annesley Bupp had a
reputation; to be exact, he had two
reputations. In Fleet Street he was
known as a writer upon whom a sub-
editor could depend ; a furnisher of what
got to be called “Buppy’—matter
which is paid at a slightly higher rate
than ordinary copy, because the length
and quality of it never vary. Outside
Fleet Street he was regarded simply as
a literary light; Amnesley Bupp, the
fellow whose name you saw in every
paper; an accepted author.
It was not surprising, therefore, that
at the beginning of 1907 public opinion
forced Annesley into newer fields of
literature. It demanded from him,
among other things, a weekly review of
current fiction entitled Fireside Friends.
He wrote this with extraordinary fluency;
a few words of introduction, followed
by a large fragment of the book before
him, pasted beneath the line, “Take
this, for instance.” An opinion of any
kind he rarely ventured; an adverse
opinion, like a good friend, never. -*
About this time, he was commissioned
to write three paragraphs each day for
an evening paper. The first of them
always began: “Mr. Asquith's admission
in the House of Commons yesterday
that he had never done so and so is
not without parallel. In 1746 the elder
Pitt . . . .” The second always began:
“Mention of the elder PITT recalls the
fact that . . . .” The third always
began : “It may not be generally
known . . .”
Until he began to write these para-
graphs Annesley Bupp had no definite
political views.
IV.
Amnesley Bupp is now (May 1909) at
the zenith of his fame. The “Buppy”
of old days he still writes occasionally,
but he no longer signs it in full. A
modest “A. B.” in the corner, supposed
by the ignorant to stand for “ARTHUR
BALFOUR,” is the only evidence of the
author. (I say “the only evidence,” for
he has had, like all great men, his count-
less "...] Trams also he deserted
with the publication of his great work
on the subject–Tramiana. But as a
writer on Literature and Old London
he has a European reputation, and his
recent book, In the Track of Shakspeare:
A Record of a Visit to Stratford-on-Avon,
created no little stir.
He is in great request at public
dinners, where his speech in reply to
the toast of Literature is eagerly at-
tended.
He contributes to every symposium in
the popular magazines. -
It is all the more to be regretted that
his autobiography, The Last of the
Bupps, is to be published posthumously.

Liberal Education.
At a recent meeting of the Women's
Liberal Federation at St. James's Hall a
lady remarked that “it was their duty
not to threaten the Government, but to
educate.” Subsequently another lady
exclaimed, in reply to a question : “The
answer is N–O, no.” (Loud º
We think the second lady did well to
show her friends that her education at
least had not been neglected, and we
are glad to see that the audience gene-
rously recognised the fact. Many people
can say “No,” but not everyone can
spell it. .

MUSICAL NOTES.
We have always manfully upheld the
| cause of British art and British artists.
But there are moments when our pat-
riotism is sadly shaken. The foreigner
is not only finely equipped, but he
possesses certain extraneous advantages.
In particular he uses our language so
much more eſſectively than we do.
In his hands “the thing becomes a
trumpet”—his own trumpet, whence he
blows strains like the seraphs' in their
burning rows. .
This is not a mere general statement.
It is prompted by an official document,
forwarded by a correspondent, setting
forth the triumphs of Professor MARio
LoRENzi, a young Florentine harp cir-
tuoso. The youthful genius made his
mark early. He was only twelve when
he gained the gold medal at the Royal
Musical Institute. According to the
pamphlet:— ... "
“The clever boy so much applauded in so
many Concerts won the gold medal with the
highest vow ; 10 on 10. Our congratulations
... to the little virtuous...”
A year later further honors fell to him.
“Florence (Nazione) July 1908.
“Wednesday 8 in our Musical Institut the
boy of fourteen Mario Lorenzi obtained, with
splendid €xamens, with full vows, the Diploma
of Magystére of Harp.
“This is the first time that a pupil of our
Musical Institut obtain a Diploma of Magystére
at the age of 14 years.” -
---
After these academic triumphs the
young “virtuous ” proceeded to the
conquest of Rome:–
“Rome (Illustrazione di Roma) January 1909.
“...at the noble modesty, at the audacious
dignity of the fourteen Professor Lorenzi who
does not precede with trumpet of réclame, he
copies all hystorical impassibility of Thomson
abboring whatever meanness quáckish...
...In many Concerts we see the young
harpist with anxiety voluptuous of conqueror,
to obtain the apogee of agility; the rapid
lightining passings on, of his celestial instru-
ment, fresh under his magical fingers, and
the elegant wonderful musicalness, ascend to
Heaven, gently, charming as a caress of an
angel...” - - - -
On his return to Florence “it is abso-
lutely impossible to say the enthusiasm
that the valorous boy suscited in the
execution of different pieces.” The critic
of the Patria (Prato) also admits the
failure of human speech, but boldly
attempts the impossible:–
“...Here we are before one of those phe-
nomenus, for which nothing is sufficient enough
to say. A delicate boy of fourteen who owns
already the secret to take away with the touch
of his little hand, from a very difficult instru-
ment the solemn and mysterious word of Art...

out it with simplity as a child, but with sove-

reign's surety his own will, and be subject it to

Parma was perhaps less unbridled
in its enthusiasm than Rome, but its
tribute is not without its orthographical
significance :-
“...Mario Lorenzi very young indeed, dis-
played his very difficult Programme by serious
artist, very old in art. The tecnyc he possess
exact as correct he is in the style which he
translates. The touch he has, is full of ex-
Fº without abandoning studied manners.
e surmount with cleverness the oclaves so
difficult, the tremulous and trills with handsome
execution of light and shand.
“At last the absolute mastery command that
he shows to posses of the instrument make
positively to forget that we find before us to a
person phisically so small. He is an artist who
speaks and moves our heart, and delight our
spirit...”
“Navy perambulator, nearly new.”
North Wilts IIerald.
The very thing for Reggie
“The other day at the meeting of the Pres-
bytery of Hamilton, attention was called to the
fact that a ‘church member and communicant'
had desecrated the sabbath by motoring several
miles to church, although he had places ºf
worship close at hand . . . . Twenty years ago
such an irregularity would have been severely
censured.”—Truth. -
It would certainly have been a matter
for comment—twenty years ago, before
the motor deluge.
London has recently been honoured
by a visit from the distinguished com-
poser Widor. We gather, however, from
the notices of his concert that he is a
serious musician and not a Merry Widor.
“UNIoxists SEARch. For A CANoid ATE

This is good hearing, but probably the
strain of calling the other man a liar
and a traitor will tell in the end.

IN CHAMBERS.
AN Action FOR LIBEL.
Libel, is the opinion you express of
someone else when, driven at last by
righteous indignation to abandon con-
ventional falseiiood, you speak out your
mind with fearless honesty. Libel is
also the opinion someone else expresses
of you when, maddened by wicked
jealousy of your glaring merits, he
abandons all sense of truth, decency and
honour, and gives full play to the vile
range of his distorted imagination.
Your dearest friend brings the ghastly
production to your notice, and blind
with fury you hurry off to your Solicitor.
The Solicitor, in a state of unimpassioned
but well-feigned disgust at the vileness
of humanity, hurries off with you to
Counsel's chambers. Counsel,
secretly inclined to agree and
sympathise with the other side,
makes a mote of all the circum-
stances, informs you that he has
no doubt that he will see you
properly avenged, and wonders
whether we ever are going to
have fine weather again. Being
too much upset to address your-
self properly to this subject, you
take your leave, and thereupon a
Young Man emerges from the
background and sets about draw-
ing your Statement of Claim.
A Statement of Claim is a
brief but accurate marration of
the facts (be the law what it
may) by the Plaintiff. The State-
ment of Defence is a brief but
accurate marration of the facts
(be the law what it may) by the
Defendant. The odd thing about
these two documents is that they
never agree upon any point, ex-
cept that the Plaintiff is a grocer,
and that the Defendant does
the instigation of the devil, wrote of the
said Jones:—
‘SMITH's BUTTER IS THE BEST BUTTER,”
meaning thereby” (and now for it!)
“that Jones's butter is not so good as
Smith's butter; that Jones's butter is no
butter but margarine, and the worst
known kind of margarine at that. That
the butter of the said Jones is not good
enough even to be margarine. That
the said butter is made from the scrap-
ings of the gutter and by means of
sweated labour. That the butter of the
said Jones is vile, poisonous and exe-
crable. That the said Jones knows
that his said butter is vile, poisonous
and execrable, and revels in the thought.
That the said Jones has on divers occa-
sions endeavoured to make his butter
TAKING A SPECIALIST'S OPINION.
Enquirer. “I say, MATE, 'oo Is This 'ERE 'Olnine?”
Counsel's Young Man's Innuendo un-
moved, jots a Statement of Defence
down on the back of an envelope. The
Statement of Defence, which means
nothing in itself, but may be said to
mean anything convenient at the trial,
runs thus:—
“1. The said Smith does not admit
that he is the said Smith.
2. The said Smith does not sell butter.
3. The said Smith does not advertise
the butter which the said Smith does
not sell.
4. The advertisement, whereby the
said Smith does not advertise the butter
which the said Smith does not sell, does
not bear the alleged defamatory or any
meaning.
5. The said Smith's butter is the best
butter.”
-— After that, of course, there is
nothing more to be said, so the
pleadings are closed and the case
eventually comes on for trial.
Eminent Silk for the Plaintiff
Jones leaves no doubt in the
mind of the lay audience of the
sweetness and purity of Jones's
character and butter, and of the
indescribable filth of Suith's
nature and margarine. Eminent
Silk for the Defendant Smith
convinces them that Jones is an
unprincipled villain (not only in
the matter of butter selling) who
deserved and would have got
the harshest treatinent at the
hands of Smith, had not Smith
been one of those perhaps too
charitable persons who will do
no man an injury, however richly
he may merit it. The Judge,
who seems to have heard all that
before, suggests to the Jury that
Jones and Smith are both very
decent fellows, a little carried
carry on business at No. 9,999, Strand.
In order to get damages for a libellous
attack, it is not unimportant to show
that it is libellous. As it generally is
not, it is the business of the Young
Man to make it so, and his explanation
of what the double-faced brute meant
by his apparently innocent statement is
called the Innuendo. Jones and Smith,
for instance, are trade competitors, and,
as Smith's custom is getting better than
Jones's, Jones is determined to have the
law of Smith for libel. Wondering
what sort of a fellow Smith really is,
the Young Man starts in on the State-
ment of Claim, gets the prefatory facts
stated as soon as possible, writes down
the words that were actually used, and
then sets about the pleasant task of
innuendoing. The material paragraph
will run as follows:—
“The said Smith falsely and mali-
ºntonly and cruelly, and at
worse, but has found the same impos-
sible. That the said Jones, by selling
the said butter, is cheating the poor,
robbing the widow and orphan, and
wilfully exterminating the human race.
That the said Jones is a blackguard, a
liar, and an abominable cad. That the
said Jones has been twice divorced and
has served a term of penal servitude for
forging his father's signature. That the
said Jones has obtained the vast in-
heritance which he now squanders in
profligate living by the poisoning of his
elder brother, whom he did by guile
induce to consume a portion of the
said abominable, filthy, and loathsome
(alleged) butter.”
You would have thought that Smith's
Counsel would have been reduced to
silence by that, but not a bit of it. If
he has a Young Man on the premises,
the Young Man does it, but if not the
other Counsel himself, reading Jones's
-'away by their feelings. The
Jury, who are by this time sick to death.
of Jones and Smith, think privately that
they are both fools, and return a verdict
that disappoints the one and is far from
satisfying the other.
Thatevening the papersissue posters:-
“AMAZING LIBEL SUIT.”
Not enough of these are sold to please
the publishers. who are consequently
very cross with the public. That portion
of the public which does buy feels itself
grossly duped, and is very cross with
the publishers. Everyone is, in fact,
very cross with everyone else, and does
not hesitate to say so. Everyone else is
not going to stand such abandoned libel
as ensues, and hurries off to his Soliciº
tor, blind with fury. The Solicitor, in a
state of unimpassioned but well-feigned
disgust at the vileness of humanity,
hurries off to Counsel's chambers. Coun-

A SERVANT OF THE PUBLIC.
For years and years it has been a
mystery to me, and I have no doubt to
others, where the Post Office get their
pencils—those pencils which are of such
value that they are chained to the tele-
graph counter like the nail brushes at a
political club not a hundred miles from
Northumberland Avenue.
From what mines can such plumbago
be excavated—plumbago warranted to
make no mark save by intense pressure,
and when intensely pressed to break 2
I have bought pencils at every price in
retail shops, but never have I found
anything like these. They are, as the
dealer said, a unique.
But now I know, for I have met a
public official who gave away the secret.
“Yes,” he said, “I am a specialist in
the impracticable, and as such am
adviser to government departments and
railway companies. You have heard, of
course, of the “Corridor Soap * used on
certain lines, the great merit of which
is that it “won’t wash hands”? Well,
I discovered that soap. It took me a
long time, but I found it at last. I was
paid a handsome commission by several
leading companies for putting them up
to that secret.”
“Indeed,” said I.
“Yes,” he continued, “and it was I
| who brought to perfection the post office
pencil. The post-office nib is mine, too,
| made to my pattern by a well-known
| firm. Have you noticed the
blotting-paper?”
“I have,” I said, with a groan.
“Ah!” he resumed, his eye gleaming,
| “ that was a great find. That comes from
| France.” -
“From France?”
“Yes, from France. They under-
stand bad blotting-paper there. And
the post-office ink,” he continued—
“you might think that became thick
in course of time; but it doesn’t.
Let me tell you a secret”—and he
whispered in my ear. “It begins like
that ' It's a kind of stirabout from the
word Go!”
“No l’” I cried.
“I swear it,” he said.
FEATS OF FORGETFULNESS.
“CLAUDIUS CLEAR,” in the last of his
bewitching causeries in The British
Weekly, records a number of feats of
memory performed for the most part by
defunct worthies. It is some consolation
to think that many living luminaries
are capable of feats of obliviousness
quite equal to, if not surpassing, the
exploits so carefully chronicled by the
vivacious Claudius. -

that Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL is totally

unable to recall the opinions which he
expressed with the utmost conviction,
and even passion, little more than three
years ago.
Lord ROSEBERY, again, in spite of his
notorious sympathy with the afflicted
cabmen of London, has pathetically
confessed that he never succeeded in
memorising the number of a hansom.
Captain Rasher, R.N., although pos-
sessed of remarkable literary gifts, is
seldom able to recollect what he has
committed to paper unless at least twenty
fair copies are printed for the use of the
First Sea Lord.
The Marquis Townshend, though care-
fully instructed in the Greek tongue
when a bow, is no longer able to repeat
even a single page of LIDDELL and Scott's
Dictionary by heart.
Mr. SIDNEY LEE, on one occasion while
crossing the Channel in a fog, tried to
while away the hours by repeating the
whole of SHAKSPEARE's plays by heart,
but broke down in the middle of the
Third Act of Titus Andronicus.
Lord CourTNEY, at a recent meeting of
the Statistical Society, owned with deep
contrition that he could no longer repeat
the list of Derby winners since the year
1780, in which that classic race was
first run.

I HAVE a boy of three years old,
His face is plain as it can be ;
His nose is of the Roman mould,
But—he belongs to me.
One morn we walked in Sheppey's Isle,
For there was nothing else to do,
And prattled in the WoRDsworth style
Of things both old and new.
My thoughts were in another place:
I thought of Brook Green's pleasant
flats, . . . .
Our dear old dog, the porter's face,
The “Salce” on the mats. -
It was the sort of day when one
Could think and think and think and
think;
The heat was trying, and the sun
Seemed to suggest a drink.
My boy was walking on my right;
The name I call him by is Jim;
As there was no one else in sight
I had to talk to him.
The lambs were getting on my mind;
The heat by now was simply vile;
“Brook Green,” said I, “we’ve left
behind, . . . . . .
And this is Sheppey's Isle. t
“My little lad, which like you best ?”
Said I and shook him for a while,
“Our little flat in London (West)
Or this here Sheppey's Isle?
“And tell me, would you rather be,
My precious little juvenile, -
In Brook Green Mansions (No 3)
Or here in Sheppey's Isle 2"
He, hesitating, looked at me,
Then answered with a happy smile :
“Brook Green's played out; I'd rather
be -
Down here in Sheppey's Isle." .
“Iook here now, James, is this the
truth? -
My little Jimmy, tell me why.” . .
“I do not know,” replied the youth.
“Why, bless my soul!” said I,
“Brook Green is handy and all that,
And suits me almost to a T.;
Why would you change the little flat
For Sheppey by the sea 2"
At this my poor boy dropped a tear
... And made no audible reply; .
Ten times I shouted in his ear,
“Why, Jimmy? tell me why.”
At last he found his tongue again
... And thus to me he made reply,
“Cos here I've seen a naryplane,
And that's the reason why.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 10.
—For some vivid moments there seemed
prospect of interruption of debate on
Budget Resolutions consequent on
CHANCELLOR OF ExCHEQUER being haled to
Clock Tower, placed on bread and water
diet, and permitted to wear Mr. CHAPLIN's
clothes only on Sundays. It was Cap-
tain CRAIG who created the scare. Ever
on alert, he had observed report of
interview conceded by CHANCELLoſt of
ExchEQUER to a morning newspaper. In
its course CHANCELLOR reported to have
said, “Traders who think they are
unfairly treated may take one of two
courses. They may behave as business
men and come to me, or they may be-
have as politicians and go to Mr. AUSTEN
CHAMBERLAIN.”
In this, which he described as “an
attempt to intimidate traders sitting
on Unionist benches into crawling on
their knees to the right hon. gentleman,”
the gallant Captain perceived a breach of
privilege. Fortunately for LLOYD-GEORGE,
SPEAKER did not view incident in that
serious light. But it serves to show
how in the midst of life we run dire
risk of being immured in the foulest
dungeon of the
Castle keep.
Not the only dis-
turbing element in
the quiet evening
LIoyD-GEORGE pro-
mised himself.
About half-past
eight discovery was
made that his place
on Treasury Bench
was empty. As
matter of fact, sole
occupant at this
moment was the

Hicks remarked

citude, “no one to

was willing and ready to impart the
true principles upon which a Budget
should be founded. As BANBURY spoke
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER entered,
with weak attempt at a smile. Gentle-
men opposite not to be trifled with.
Explanations and apologies proved un-
availing. Division on motion to report
progress would occupy a quarter of an
hour, would serve to stretch the legs of
those who had remained in attendance,
and would bring in Members who
were selfishly dining. Taken accord-
ingly, and a good half-hour wasted.
Then KIMBER resumed his speech where
he had left off.
All might have been avoided had
Members concerned adopted SHERweLL's
procedure, described in phrase that
Coming
to particular turn in prodigiously long
speech, he complacently remarked :
“Now, Sir, I will anticipate a murmur

to the more difficult task of anticipating
KIMBER's murmur before it hurtled
through the House. -

procedure during a sitting of the House
of Lords. On sultry days in early stages
of incumbency of office the original Radi-
cal “Bob” REID used to assert himself
in the stately person of the LORD Chan-
CELLoſt by casting aside the skirt of his
gown and displaying a pair of terrestrial
legs. . . --- -
“And before the Bishops too !” said
Mr. J. G. TALDOT with pained voice, re-
garding the incident from the niggardly
pen allotted to Commoners.
Never before in its long history had
similar scandal been connected with the
Woolsack. Happily it is a thing of
the past. Whether a little bird whis-
pered in the LoRD CHANCELLOR's ear J. G.
TALBor's remark, or whencesoever hint
came, it proved effective. Even through
the summer solstice the Lord CHANCEL-
LoR's knees are decently, draped ; but the
wig still nightly suffers: : --
The Lond CHANCELLOR installed, there
follows an interval of a quarter of an
hour for private business. This custo-
marily takes the form of whispered con-
versation among the half-dozen Peers
who compose the House. . (It is, by the
way, a nice and significant calculation
that, whereas a quorum in the Commons
requires the presence of forty Members,
in the Lords three Peers suffice to make
a House.) On the stroke, of half-past
four public business is called on. On

asked how long the Whitsun holidays

the Table as if collapse were imminent,
replied in hoarse tones that as there was
prospect of sitting later than usual in
August perhaps they had better take an
exceptionally long holiday at Whitsun-

THE SECRET OUT.
[“It has become known that Herr Richard
Strauss is engaged on the composition of a
light opera to be called Sylvia und der Stern
(Sylvia and the Star), the libretto of which
is written by Herr Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
Although the plot is kept secret, it has trans-
pired that the scene is laid at the end of the
18th century, a period which, it is believed,
should lend itself well to light, melodious music
and handsome costumes."—The Times.] .
HERE, at last, perhaps, is the new idea
for which Mr. GeoRGE EDWARDEs is always
seeking. How to vary the monotony of
the ordinary musical-comedy plot?—that
is his problem. He tried foreign back-
grounds, he tried stage backgrounds, he
now tries shop backgrounds. But here
is something far more actual-news-
paper and political backgrounds. It is
all the fashion now, too. Sylvia and The
Star is only a beginning, but think how
amusing it might be, and how illu-
minating !
. Although the plot is secret (that stuff
about the eighteenth century is obviously
to put you off the scent) we can tell a
little of it. Sylvia (Miss GEITIE Mill.AR)
is the fiancée of a young and rising Con-
servative (Mr. GEORGE GROSSMITH, jun.),
who, when the curtain rises, is visiting
at Sylvia's home, where May Day is
being kept in the old-fashioned way,
with certain new devices introduced by
the Smart Set. Among the guests is
the editor of The Star (Mr. NAINLY) and
the chief literary critic of the same paper
(Mr. EDMUND PAYNE). Sylvia's mother,
the Countess of Gloot (Miss CoNNIE
EDIss), has, it seems, literary aspirations,
and she has written a novel which was
highly praised in The Star under the
title The Renascence of Nous. Hence
the presence of Mr. EDMUND PAYNE.
What with song, dance and quip, the
First Act goes merrily on, ending up-
roariously in a game of forfeits, the
penalty which falls to Sylvia's lot being
the task of editing The Star for a week.
Curtain. r - -
In Act II. we find ourselves in The
Star office, where the fun is fast and
furious. Sylvia, being all for her hus-
band, and assisted by him, writes
astonishing leaders against the Liberals,
and receives astonishing visits from,
among others, the Prime Minister (Mr.
(). B. CLARENCE) and the Chief Liberal
Whip (Mr. WALTER PAssMoRE). Needless
to say all comes right in the end.
So much for the plot. As to the

“I’LL tell you a story,” began Ponker.
“One evening, a certain Mr. Geo.
Hartley Bentworth of Cutter Street was
going home on the top of a Walham
Green 'bus when it got into a block in
the Strand. Presently he looked up from
his paper and noticed that people all
about him were craning their necks to
see what was going on further down the
street, while an unreasoning panic
seemed to have seized all the horses.
Evidently something unusual was taking
place But what are you doing?”
For Ponker's patient listener was
stealing to the door with his tobacco jar,
his hair-pin (or smoker's best friend),
and the evening paper.
“It's another Invasion story,” he said
coldly.
“Wrong,” retorted Ponker. “But
you are right in supposing that I am
telling you a story with a purpose. Sit
down and be quiet.
“‘What is the matter?' asked Mr.
Bentworth of the driver.
“‘There's an elephant asleep in the
middle of the road,' said the man, “so
we shall have to go round by the Em-
bankment.’” -
(Rather a mild-spoken driver, thought
the audience.)
“In consequence of this delay Mr.
Bentworth arrived home ten minutes late.
In the front garden he came upon the
gardener, who was talking to the post-
man. Both had pale faces, and seemed
frightened.
“‘Anything wrong, William P' asked
Mr. Bentworth.
“‘There's a strange beast in the gar-
den eating the sweet peas,' replied
William. “Like this ; ' and he in-
flated his cheeks and regarded his
master with a vicious leer.
“‘An unprincipled-looking monster,’
thought Mr. Bentworth; ‘I should not
like to meet him without a gun.' Then
it occurred to him that William was
trying to look like a hippopotamus, and
Wi succeeding, upon the whole, pretty
WeII.
“So he advised the gardener to buy
a penny bun, and lure the animal out
by the tradesmen's entrance. Then he
went indoors.
“‘My dear,’ he told his wife, ‘I am
hot and flurried, so I shall have a bath
before dinner.'
“‘Oh! don't,' said Mrs. Bentworth,
looking up from her drawn-thread
work. “There's a crocodile in the bath,
and he made such a funny noise when I
disturbed him. I don't think he is quite
so good-tempered as the last one we had
staying with us, the one that bit the
milkman's leg, I mean.'
“Mr. Bentworth sighed, and asked
what there was for dinner. As if in
answer to his question the cook burst
into the room, and said:
“‘Please 'm, I'm sorry, but shall I

it was a story with a purpose,” he
complained.
“It is,” said Ponker. -
“Well, what have you told it me for?”
“My good fellow,” explained Ponker,
“there are a lot of well-fed people,

cause they have nothing to worry about,

AT THE PLAY.
“LovE WATCHES.”
“FREDERICK HARRison and CHARLEs
FROHMAN present Miss BiLLIE BURKE in
Love Watches.” So ran the announce-
ment, suggesting at the start that, in
the opinion of these gentlemen, Miss
BILLIE BURRE and not the play was “the
thing.” And, indeed, as far as the play
was concerned—a trite farce, described
as a comedy, on the hallowed lines of
one of the old love-and-jealousy schemes,
and adapted from the French into the
American — they were well justified.
Whether they were equally justified in
the matter of Miss WILLIAM BURRE must
remain a question of taste, notwithstand-
ing the repeated assurances, on the
authority of the book, that Jacqueline
(the character she played) was “adora-
ble.” Miss BURRE has a certain pretti-

of the time she had the air of a poupée
with springs wound up almost to the
snapping point. She was there, of
course, to make things hum, but her
restless mobility never allowed me to
recover from the mental strain which I
suffered in trying to make out who was
who all through a First Act that seethed
with obscure French names, though it
had little else of French in it.
Subsequent Acts were relieved by the
quiet humour of Mr. ERNEST LAwFord in
the part of another Ernest, a lack-love
pedant ; but the value of the things
which were said both by him and about
him depended often upon their sugges-
tion of the improprieties which were
left unsaid when the original was
bowdlerised.
The entrance, early in the play, of
that intelligent actress, Miss HENRIETTA
|WATson, inspired hopes of something
good and in the English language; but
she disappeared after a few seconds, and
never recurred. Even so, we saw more
of her than of a certain other character
described as a dancer and even a “living
picture.” This lady, a creature of rare
promise, whose mere mention suggested
the most intriguing possibilities, merer
appeared at all.

play as it was acted), but off the stage
he had been pursuing an intrigue with

lady's husband discovered “the letters”;
and the inevitable duel was arranged (off
the stage). This took place a day or
two later (off the stage), and Fritz
was killed. Meanwhile we had been
watching Christine. -
The First Act, showing a supper party
in Fritz's rooms, should have been de-
lightful, for besides Fritz and Christine
there were present Theodor and Mizi,
two jolly young people gaily played by
Mr. CHARLES MAUDE and Miss MARGARET
BUssé. But the tragic demeanour of
Mr. HENRY AINLEY overawed us, and we
were afraid to laugh.
The Second and Third Acts took place
in Christine's rooms. Nothing happened,
and we saw little of Fritz; but various
people came on and talked to Christine
about him—telling her that all men
were like that, and that she would soon
get over it, and that he would come

And for two Acts we watch her to see
how she likes it.
Though much in each Act is excellent,
the play is badly balanced as a whole.
After the First Act interest dies out in
the story, and centres instead on the
actress.
It was something of an ordeal for Miss
MARG ARET HALSTAN, and she came out of
it well. In real life I have newer seen a
woman in agony, so that I cannot say
that her performance was unnatural. It
was artificial certainly, but under the
stress of great emotion people do become
artificial. Anyhow, her conception of
the part was the correct one. Mr.
AINLEY's, I thought, was not. The
whole point of the play must have been
that Fritz was a careless fellow, who had
only been amusing himself with Christine.
“He spoke of you too,” says. Theodor, in
describing the last scenes, and Christine
seizes hysterically upon the “too.” Mr.
AINLEY, to judge by the way he went on
in the Second Act, would have talked
of her exclusively. Upon my word, I
thought he really loved her. M.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Doubtless you have in your time said some harsh things
about solicitors, but you cannot imagine what nasty remarks
other people have made until you read Leares of the Lower
Branch (SMITH, EIDER). Mr. CHRISTIAN, a Bachelor of Laws,
intent on learning the worst, has read and noted every
book in which the word “attorney” occurs. He has un-
earthed all the unprofessional writings of the Profession, and
not a solicitor, whose pen has ever run away from his
precedents, has escaped his notice. If at times the humour
of the author and his solicitor friends inclines to rotundity
(like the humour of all good men of the Law) the reader
learns much that he should, but does not, know about a host
of writers whose names have been on the Rolls. Indeed,
nearly all deceased men of literary note (including an editor
of Punch) seem at one time or another to have sat upon an
office stool and written, “This is the last will and testa-
ment of, etc.” The book 1 - --- --- - - - - - -
deals thoroughly but plea-
in the book) over a lot of unattractive people, not easy to
realise, and not always worth realising. Two characters,
David and Bice, might have redeemed it, but one dies early
and the other remains a mere suggestion.
I don't know whether the book contains portraits of Mrs.
FRANKAU's private friends or enemies under assumed names.
There is one apparent reference, of a disagreeable kind, to
a certain marriage that has made matter for social gossip;
and it may well be that some of the superfluous minor
characters, of whom we learn particulars that appear to
serve no very useful purpose, are drawn from the ranks of
her acquaintances. If this be so, she will be wrong to reckon
upon a very wide interest, on the part of the public, in
personal references of which only a very limited number
possesses, or is likely to worry about possessing, the key.
Nearly a quarter of a century ago, at the close of twenty
years' management, Sir SQUIRE and Lady BANCROFT used the
first opportunity of well-earned leisure to write an account
of their career. The interest of the public was pleasantly

If it had occurred to the author of An Incompleat Etonian

her hero, a good name for it would have been An Incompleat

“Everywhere his feet had trodden was the better for his
passing; ” “she was everything of which Vanessa had no
experience and was unable to place; " “he had been too
long used to play the cuckoo for him to lightly contemplate
building a nest.” She shows a marked singularity in her
treatment of plurals in -a : she speaks of “this phenomena,”
and “a different strata; ” she says that “the effluvia of
dead and rotting things was in his nostrils.” Here and
there she uses a word in a sense peculiar to herself: con-
fuses agley with aſſog (“he found the trade all agley with a
new discovery''); and talks of “those high fallacious hopes
integral to his youth.” Finally, her punctuation is that of a
child who doesn't know the difference between a comma and
a semicolon. This illiteracy of manner, almost unbelievable
in a writer of “FRANK DANdy's" experience, sets one against
the matter of her book. But anyhow it is not a great
performance. She wastes her cleverness (for there are ideas

well is proved again in the pages of this portly book. It
presents a story, simply told, of a strenuous life crowned
with rare measure of success. Whilst necessarily indicating
the triumphs of its authors, a delicate reserve pervades the

“Henry in Search of a Wife" is an-
nounced as the Title of a forthcoming
novel by Mr. CotRLANDER, and we are all
eager to know whether it will prove to be
an historical romance with HENRY VIII.
as hero. -
Describing the short hole on the new
Moretown links, Golfing says: —
“The pin is distant from the tee about a
hundred and forty yards or thereby, and is
oval in shape, its length being nearly twice
it; breadth. One of the narrow ends faces the
tee, and is on the level.”
Good golfers, however, rarely pay much
attention to the peculiarities of the pin.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPINE,--Quite an amusing
function—“Tea and Tailoring”—is to
come off in a few days' time on the
Terrace of what old-fashioned people
call the House of Commons. It's a
men's affair, really, but of course we
shan't be shut out !
A certain Berlin Schneider, who claims
to have revolutionised the tailor's art,
is to give a show of his “creations” on a
number of mannequins he's brought
over. People are simply raving about
his things, and calling them “extra-
ordinarily ingenious,” especially an even-
ing coat which, by removing the tails,
can be worn as a dinner-jacket, and a
frock-coat that, turned inside out, be-
comes a dressing-gown ' I hear that,
when the show is over, the Schneider-
in-chief is to make a little speech (arfter
booking orders from a number of Free
Trade Members), in which he will say
that the Derrace of the House of Gom-
mons is the finest show-room in the
world, that he is very grateful for the
use of it, and that, with all the generous
help and encouragement he's had, he
feels gonfident of being able to remove
the unjust prestige so long attached to
British tailoring ! I disapprove of the
whole thing; but really, you know, my
dearest, in the present state of things
it's counted simply poisomous form to
stick up for your country and give a
thought to its trade and things.
Norty's immensely disgusted with the
matter. He says his only consolation is
that the Schneider couldn't have a worse
ad. for his “creations" than some Mem-
bers of the Government will give him
by wearing them He means to ask a
lot of questions and make a lot of
speeches about it in the House, and give
it 'em hot; as he says himself, “I’ll
give 'em the length of my tongue, if
they'll give me the length of their
cars '''
Everyone's giving dances just now ;
but I’ve knocked 'em once more with
my party of a night or two ago. I sent
out the ordinary cards, “Mrs. Multimill
at Home,” with “Dancing” in one corner
of the card, but in the other corner was
“Bare Feet.” Wasn't it a dilly idea 2
It all went with a bang. Reporters were
killing each other to get in and make
pars. and take snapshots. I’m still roar-
ing at the remembrance of how some of
the people looked. How they could dare
to come ! Deryl Clarges refused owing
to “another engagement.” I knew she'd
have that “other engagement.” She
wears fives, you know, and—- But I
won't say any more; I’m abore detract-
ing from other women, I hope
Lots of kind things were said of some
feet that I won't particularise further;
and Ray Rymington has made some
verses to “My Ladye of the Shell-pink
Feet,” the opening line of which, “Pink
shells, pink shells on the sea-shore,” is
dreadfully reminiscent, I'm afraid, of
one of the hanto. songs.
I've got a new Cause, my dear! Isn't
that lovely 2 And you'd never, never,
never guess what it is The Planet
Mars | | That dear, clever creature who's
given up his whole life to Mars is over
here just now, and is a great draw for
dinner. He's got a most glorious plan,
and I’m going to help him carry it out
for all I'm worth, and make others help
too. He's going to set up enormous
megatelephones in all the English-
speaking countries, and then, when Mars
and the Earth are nearest to each other,
we're all to shout together, “Are you
there?” Isn't it a screaming idea? I
can hardly wait till it's time to do it, I
want to hear the answer so | Norty
says that, even if they are there, it
doesn't follow that they speak English ;
and how should we like to hear, in
answer to our “Are you there?”
“Sorcelºt,” or “Jawohl” 2. He's a hor-
ribly aggravating boy.
That poor dear Oldpark is being led
such a life by his Texan countess.
She's always grubbing in the Muni-
ment Chamber down at Oldpark and
springing family privileges and tradi-
tions on her husband that are quite
news to him. She's found out now that
CHARLES THE SECOND or RICHARD THE THIRD,
or one of the others who wanted money
and borrowed from the Oldpark of those
days, gave him in return the privilege
of coming to Court “in full panoply,
with blowing of trumpets and flying of
flags.” “What's a panoply, anyhow º'
asked the Countess when she 'd mastered
it so far. “I’ll order one right away;
and we’ll use all our privileges at the
next Court, trumpets, flags, and all!”
“Oh!” screamed poor Oldpark, “those
rotten old privileges have been waived
for centuries.” “Ain’t I saying so all
the time 2'' she said ; “and they’ll be
waved again, those flags will, before
we're many weeks older. Some of my
folks will be over by then, and I want
the whole crowd to see Hypatia Oldpark
go to Court with all her privileges, and
the vurry best panoply that can be got
for dollars " " She's unearthed some
old suits of armour, too, and means to
have a tournament down at their place,
with lists and heralds and largesse and
all that sort of thing, and a Queen of
Love and Beauty—herself, of course !
She wants to force that poor wretched
Oldpark into a suit of armour and make
him hold the lists against all comers.
Bosh says the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Husbands ought to step in.
D'you know, my dear, what is the
newest way out of any particularly bad
hole you 've got into ? Lapse of
memory ! I see Punch has something
this week about “Feats of Forgetful-
ness.” It’s been tried with immense
success in several rather bad cases
lately. Wee-Wee was telling me to-day
she's a ghastly heap of bridge-debts on
her shoulders and doesn't know how on
earth she's going to pay them. She
says the only way out of it that she can
see is to have a lapse of memory, and
forget who she is herself and who every-
one else is. -
Talking of lapses of memory reminds
me that trance-performers are quite the
rage just now, and I've discovered a
wonderful pair of trance - performing
sisters and brought them out at an
aſternoon party I gave last week. I'd
a big crowd here, and I told them before
the performance began—for, of course,
it's the very essence of these trance-
affairs to impress upon the audience that
the people can't do it in a normal state
—“Now this girl who's going to play
can't really play a bit, and this girl
who's going to dance doesn't know the
first thing about dancing.” And then
they were hypnotised, and the girl who
can't play played a merreille, and the
girl who can't dance did an extraordi-
mary dance, a mixture of the Salome
and the Cachuca Everyone was in
fits, and I was simply loaded with con-
grats at having found such a pair of
marvels. Only Beryl looked sniffy: so I
said to her, “I hope you believe, my
dear, that it's all on the square, and
that the girls really can't play and
dance in a normal state?” And she
said, “Why, of course, I believe it,
dearest. I’m quite sure they can't play
or dance in a normal state—or in any
other state ''' - -

“In reply to your letter of the 14th inst.
asking for permission to grant, a day's holiday
on the 24th inst., I beg to inform you that it

which meets on that date.”
Whereupon the clerk put on his coat
again and went out to lunch.
From the report of a local committee
of the Y.M.C.A. :--
“Very large numbers of visitors were then
attracted to the place, many riding in daily

whole, the condition of thºse animals and the
care taken of them was good.”
Intending visitors will be glad of this

[“Mr. William O'Brien, lately M.P. for Cork,
telegraphs from Florence that the report in The
('atholic IIerald that he intends to reside per-
manently in Jerusalem is “an absurd inven-
tion.’”—Daily Mail.]
Mit. John DiLLON, M.P., has wired to
The Observer to state that the allegation
that he has gone to Jericho at the
request of his constituents is a gross
exaggeration of the facts. What really
happened was that Mr. TIM HEALY,
hearing the rumour about Mr. O'BRIEN,
genially observed, “I wish John DiLION
would go to Jericho.”
On enquiry at the House of Commons
on Friday no confirmation could be ob-
tained of the exhilarating report that Mr.
Swift MACNEILL, Mr. Josi Air WEDGwood,
and Sir HENRY COTTON have arranged to
go lion-hunting in Somaliland without
guides when Parliament rises. The
rumour appears to have had its origin
in the fact that in one of his fascinating
speeches on the taxation of land values—
a subject which he always contrives to
render as entertaining as a Palais Royal
farce—Mr. Josi Ali WEDGwood declared
that there were always lions in the path
of reform, but that they caused mo alarm
to him or those who thought with him.
Mr. HALL CAINE has telegraphed to
The Stratford-on-Aron Mercury that
there is absolutely no foundation for
the report, sedulously circulated at
Portsmouth and other seaports, that he
is the author of BACON's Letters.
Capt. BACON, IR.N., has cabled to The
Army and Nary (Hazette to contradict
the report that he is the author of the
novel Incomparable Bellairs, which, as
everybody ought to know, was written
by Mr. and Mrs. EGERTON CASTLE. Capt.
BACON, who, we understand, has just
issued a special édition de luxe of 50
| - - -
copies of liis Essays, characterises as a
“preposterous ſigment” the statement
that he intends to reside permanently
on the top of Fisher's Peak in Colorado.
Sir Jolix Fisheſ has sent a remarkable
telegram to the editor of The Era to say
that there is absolutely not the faintest
shred of truth in the extraordinary
statements (1) that he was responsible
for the dramatisation of The Bath
Comedy under the title Surect Kitty
Bellairs; (2) that he was going to be
raised to the peerage with the title of
Lord BACON of Silver Streak.
The Mark of a Gentleman.

THE SECRET OF THE ARMY AEROPLANE.
[Mr. Willi AM LE QUEUx wishes to deny
indignantly that the following tale was written
by him. On the contrary, he identifies himself
completely with the proprietor of The 1)aily
Mail in deprecating the publication of scare
stories. As the proprietor of The Daily Mail
truly says, such stories “place England and
Englishmen in a ridiculous and humiliating
light before the German people.” At the same
time Mr. LE QUEUx is bound to confess that
the story printed below bears an astonishing
resemblance to his latest imaginative work,
Spies of the Kaiser—-a book only just published,
but written in the days of his hot and unre-
generate youth, many weeks ago.]
“YES,” said my friend, Ray Raymond,
as a grim smile crossed his typically
English face, looking round the cham-
bers which we shared together, though
he never had occasion to practise,
though I unfortunately had, “it is a
very curious affair indeed.”
“Tell us the whole facts, Ray,” urged
Vera Vallance, the pretty fair-haired
daughter of Admiral Sir Charles Vallance,
to whom he was engaged.
“Well, dear, they are briefly as fol-
lows,” he replied, with an affectionate
glance at her. “It is well known that
the Germans are anxious to get hold of
our new aeroplane, and that the secret
of it is at present locked in the inventor's
breast. Last Tuesday a man with his
moustache brushed up the wrong way
alighted at Basingstoke station and
inquired for the refreshment - room.
This leads me to believe that a das-
tardly attempt is about to be made to
wrest the supremacy of the air from
our grasp.”
“And even in the face of this the
Government denies the activity of Ger-
man spies in England ' " I exclaimed,
bitterly.
“Jacox,” said my old friend, “as a
patriot it is none the less my duty to
expose these miscreants. To-morrow
we go to Basingstoke.”
Next Thursday, then, saw us ensconced
in our private sitting-room at the Bull
Hotel, Basingstoke. On our way from
the station I had noticed how ill-pre-
pared the town was to resist invasion,
and I had pointed this out bitterly to
my dear old friend, Ray Raymond.
“Yes,” he remarked, grimly ; “and it
is simply infested with spies. Jack,
my surmises are proving correct. There
will be dangerous work afoot to-night.
Have you brought your electric torch
with you ?”
“Since that Rosyth affair, I never
travel without it,” I replied, as I stood
with my back to the cheap mantel-shelf
so common in English hotels.
The night was dark, therefore we pro-
ceeded with caution as we left the inn.
The actions of Ray Iłaymond were
curious. As we passed each telegraph
he stopped and said grimly, “Ah, I
thought so ; ” and drew his revolver.
When we had covered fifteen miles we
looked at our watches by the aid of our
electric torches and discovered that it was
time to get back to the hotel unless we
wished our presence, or rather absence,
to be made known to the German spies;
therefore we returned hastily.
Next morning Ray was recalled to
town by an urgent telegram, therefore
I was left alone at Basingstoke to foil
the dastardly spies. I stayed there for
thirteen weeks, and then went with my
old friend to Grimsby, he having received
news that a German hairdresser, named
Macdonald, was resident in that town.
“My dear Jack,” said my friend Ray
Raymond, his face assuming that sphinx-
like expression by which I knew that he
had formed some theory for the de-
struction of his country's dastardly
enemies, “to-night we shall come to
grips with the Teuton "
“And yet,” I cried, “the Government
refuses to admit the activity of German
spies in England ' "
“Ha!” said my friend grimly.
He opened a small black bag and pro-
duced a dark lantern, a coil of strong
silk rope, and a small but serviceable
jemmy. All that burglarious outfit
belonged to my friend
At this moment the pretty fair girl to
whom he was engaged, Vera Vallance,
arrived, but returned to London by the
next train.
At ten o'clock we proceeded cautiously
to the house of Macdonald the hair-
dresser, whom l'ay had discovered to be
a German spy
“Have you your electric torch with
you ?” inquired my dear old college
friend.
“I have,” I answered grimly.
“Good | Then let us enter " ''
“You mean to break in 2'' I cried,
amazed at the audacity of my friend.
“Ball !” he said. “Spies are always
cowards !”
Therefore we knocked at the door.
It was opened by two men, the elder of
whom gave vent to a quick German
imprecation. The younger had a short
beard. -
“You are a German spy 2" inquired
Ray Raymond.
“No,” replied the bearded German in
very good English, adding with mar-
vellous coolness, “to what, pray, do we
owe this unwarrantable intrusion ?”
“To the fact that you are a spy who
has been taking secret tracings of our
Army aeroplane l’’ retorted my friend.
But the spy only laughed in open
defiance.
“Well, there's no law against it,” he
replied. -
“No,” retorted Ray grimly, “thanks
to the stupidity of a crass Government
there is no law against it.”
“My God!” I said hoarsely.
“But my old friend Jacox and I,” con-
tinued Ray Raymond, fixing the miser-
able spy with his eye, “have decided to
take the law into our own hands. I
have my revolver and my friend has his
electric torch. Give me the tracings.”
“Gott—no "cried the German spies
in German. “Never, you English cur!”
But Ray had already extracted a letter
from the elder man's pocket, and was
making for the door! I followed him.
When we got back to our hotel he drew
the letter from his pocket and eagerly
examined it. I give here an exact copy
of it, and I may state that when we sent
it to His Majesty's Minister for War
he returned it without a word '
“Berkeley Chambers,
Cannon Street, E.C.
DEAR SIR,--In reply to yours of the
29th ult. we beg to say that we can do
you a good line in shaving brushes at
the following wholesale prices:
Badger . 70s. a gross.
Pure Badger 75s. a gross.
Real Badger 80s. a gross.
Awaiting your esteemed order which
we shall have pleasure in promptly
executing,
We are, Sir,
Yours obediently
WILKINSON and ALLBUTT.
Mr. James Macdonald.”
That letter, innocent enough upon the
face of it, contained dastardly instruc-
tions from the Chief of Police to a
German spy Read by the alphabetical
code supplied to every German secret
agent in England, it ran as follows :
(Phrase 1) “Discover without delay
secret of aeroplane's successful descents.”
(Phrase 2) “Forward particulars of
best plan for blowing up
(1) Portsmouth Dockyard.
(2) Woolwich Arsenal.
(3) Albert Memorial.”
(Phrase 3) “Be careful of Jack Jacox.
He carries a revolver and an electric
torch.”
“Ah!” said my friend grimly, “we
were only just in time. Had we delayed
longer, England might have knelt at
the proud foot of a conqueror' "
“Ha!” I replied briefly.
Next morning we returned to the
chambers which we shared together in
London, and were joined by Vera Val-
lance, the pretty, fair daughter of
Admiral Sir Charles Wallance, to whom
my old friend was engaged. And, as he
stroked her hair affectionately, I realised
thankfully that he and I had indeed
been the instruments of Providence in
foiling the plots of the German spies!

CROSS-EXAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's IRoAD TO KNowLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; His sister Mabel, aged 18.)
Little Arthur. Have you ever been in love, Mabs?
Mabel. You queer little atom What a funny question
to ask
L. A. But have you, Mabs?
M. No, of course not. Why should I?
L. A. I don't know, Mabs; but aren't you old enough 2
I mean, oughtn't you to be falling in love with somebody now
you’re eighteen 2
M. Oh, it doesn't go like that, you know, Arty. Some-
times people never fall in love, and sometimes they wait
until they're much older than I am.
L. A. Don't you want to be in love, Mabs?
M. No, not a bit. -
L. A. But isn't it very jolly to be in love? -
M. No, I shouldn't think so. People who are in love
always strike me as too silly for words.
L. A. Well, anyhow, Uncle John doesn't think they're silly.
M. What has Uncle John been saying about it?”
L. A. I asked him yesterday about it, and he said it was
just the rippingest thing in the world. He said it was much
better than drinking champagne, or riding a steeplechase, or
getting your debts paid.
Al. Well, I don't drink champagne or ride steeplechases,
and I don't owe anybody money, so what Uncle John said
doesn't appeal to me.
L. A. No, Mabs, I thought it wouldn't ; but he said much
more than that. He said when people were in love they were
so bucked up that they felt they could hug anybody, but they
only wanted to hug one person really, and if she didn't want to
hug them back they felt miserable, but it was much jollier
being miserable about that than being happy about anything
else, because when she did come round and give you a wink
you went up top notch again in double-quick time. That's
what Uncle John said.
M. Silly old Uncle John
in love himself.
L. A. But, Mabs, you said just now that it was the people
who were in love who were silly. Didn't you say that, Mabs?
M. I daresay. What then 2
L. A. Well, if you don't believe Uncle John has ever been
in love you shouldn't call him silly.
M. Oh, he's silly in a different way.
L. A. No, I don't think he is really, Mabs.
M. What do you mean 2
L. A. Only that Uncle John said he'd back himself against
anybody else for falling in love. He said he'd got a heart
as big as a hippopotamus-room for all and plenty to spare.
He's never been out of love, he says, since he was ten years
old. He was born so, he thinks, and he can't help it—the
little dears are too much for him. But he's going to try and
go on bearing up when they won't have him, because it 's
always one down tºother come up with him, so he 's always
kept busy.
M. Uncle John ought to be ashamed of himself to put such
motions into your head.
1...!. I didn't mind, Mabs. I like Uncle John to talk like
that. Oh, and he said they were all one to him, but there
was always one who was more so than the others. He said
he dreamt the other night he was left on a desert island with
Mrs. Gaynor, and after a dozen years or so he began to fall
in love with her all right, but he woke up just before he
could tell her about it. He said that was the bravest thing
he'd ever thought of doing, and many a man had got the
W.C. for less; but he wasn't particularly proud of it, because
he was like that and couldn't be different.
I don't believe he's ever been
M. Oh, he said that, did he? Anything else?
L. A. Yes; he said if ever I reduced a woman to despair
by trifling with her young affections he'd come and smash
me, even if it was Mrs. Gaynor. But, I say, Mabs .
M. Well ?
L. A. When people fall in love with one another isn't it
because they’re beautiful and mice 2
M. Something of that sort.
L. A. And when they fall in love like that they marry,
and then they go on loving one another till they die, don't
they 2
M. Where did you get all that from ?
L. A. Out of a book; but is it true, Mabs 2
M. Oh, I daresay it's true enough.
L. A. Then do you think Mrs. Gaynor was ever beautiful
and nice? Because Papa doesn't think she was, and I don't
think so either.
M. I'm inclined to agree with you and Papa.
L. A. Then why did Mr. Gaynor marry her?
M. I’m sure I can't say. You'd better ask him.
L. A. Uncle John said it was because she had pots of
money, and he supposed Mr. Gaynor thought fifty thousand
down was better than a straight nose and a pleasant temper.
But I think it must be dread ſul to marry when you're not
in love, because then you go on not being in love for ever
and ever.
M. You seem to know a lot.
L. A. I'm glad you think so, Mabs, because I try very
hard to learn about things. But I say, Mabs, are you in
love?
M. You asked me that before, and I told you I wasn't.
L. A. But you said people fell in love with one another
because they were beautiful and nice, and I’m sure you're
beautiful and nice, Mabs. -
Al. Of course, if you think so, Arty, I must be.
L.A. Yes, Mabs. And the other day you told Lucy
Harding that Dick Stanier was the handsomest and nicest
man in lºngland.
M. You little ––
L. A. And if he's that, Mabs, you must love him fright-
fully. I don't see how you can help it. Have you told him,
Mabs 2 -
M. You absurd little creature. Told him 2 There's
nothing—— -
L. A. Oh, yes, there is, Mabs. But perhaps he ought to
say something first 2
M. Well, it's considered usual.
L. A. All right, Mabs, I'll tell him what you said about
him, and then--
M. If you dare to do any such thing I’ll——
L. A. And then, Mabs, perhaps he'll toe the line. That's
what Uncle John called it. -
M. Uncle John's very vulgar; and if you dare to breathe
a word to Dick, I'll come and smash you. So there.
L. A. All right, Mabs, I won't. But you do love him, don't
you ? And you're not too silly for words, are you ?
M. There's Mamma calling you. Run away quick.

Masked in the beauty of the May-dawn's birth,
Death came and kissed the brow still nobly fair,
And hushed that heart of youth for which the earth
Still kept its morning air.
Long time initiate in her lovely lore,
Now is he one with Nature's woods and streams,
Whereof, a Paradisal robe, he wore
The visionary gleams.
Among her solitudes he moved apart:
The mystery of her clouds and star-sown skies,
Touched by the fusing magic of his art,
Shone clear for other eyes.
When from his lips immortal music broke,
It was the myriad voice of vale and hill;
“The lark ascending "poured a song that woke
An echo-sweeter still.
Yet most we moun his loss as one who gave
The gift of laughter and the boon of tears,
Interpreter of life, its gay and grave, -
Its human hopes and fears.
Seer of the soul of things, inspired to know
- Man's heart and woman's, over all he threw
The spell of fancy's iridescent glow,
The sheen of sunlit dew. -
And of the fellowship of that great Age
For whose return our eyes have waited long,
None left so rich a twofold heritage
Of high romance and song. s
We knew him, fronted like the Olympian gods,
Large in his loyalty to land and friend,
Fearless to fight alone with Fortune's odds,
Fearless to face the end.
r -
And he is dead. And at the parting sign
We speak, too late, the love he little guessed,
And bid him in the nation's heart for shrine
Take his eternal rest.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
!-
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 17.
—The PREMIER, talking just now about
the Budget, persuasively assuring City
capitalists that the average of Income
Tax is a fraction under 11, d. in the
pound, was disturbed by the vision of
something black flashing to and fro in
the immediate neighbourhood of Front
Bench opposite. At first thought it
was a bird seeking sanctuary in the
home of Liberty. On looking up dis-
covered it was only PEckIIAM BANBURY
waving his silk lat.
At the moment, replying to argument
that increased taxation would drive
capital out of the country, PREMIER was
remarking that if capitalists betook
themselves to France they would pay at
the rate of 1s. 5d. in the pound, whilst in
Prussia a man with £5,000 a year is
mulct at the rate of a 2s. Income Tax with
near prospect of increase. What PECK-
HAM (with the assistance of his hat)
wanted to point out was that, though
Income Tax may be higher in scale,
German Government stocks are not
charged with it.
PREMIER a dangerous man to interrupt.
Swift came the reply, crushing to the
Peckham patriot.
“I am shocked to hear that the hon.
| Baronet holds such stocks.”
PECKIIAM, replacing hat on head,
pressed it defiantly over his massive
brow.
Since a little incident that happened
the other day, PECKHAM never loses
sight of his hat. On memorable occa-
sion referred to, about to leave the House
“What NEws on The RIAlto 2" or, Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN’s “ForeignER.”
“Distributing some small change of political
economy.”
(Mr. Chiozza Money.)
Mr. Birrell. “I can only say that in a matter of this kind I prefer the evidence of a
policeman to that of a cardinal.”
when ChiozzA Money rose to distribute
some small change of political economy,
he couldn't find his hat. Was certain
that, the bench being nearly empty,
he, when he came in, placed it on the
seat to his left hand. Where was it?
At the corner of the bench sat that
esteemed veteran Member known to his
light-hearted neighbours as The BUZZARD,
happy in the privilege of not hearing
more than one-half said in prolonged
debate. On the Front Bench below,
with radiant smile and cartwheel carna-
tion, sat MARK Lockwood. He was the
man; always up to mischief; had hidden
the hat.
“Come now,” said PECRHAM, thumping
him on the back, “none of your larks.”
With evident sincerity, MARK pro-
tested he knew nothing about the hat.
“Perhaps you left it outside,” he
said.
With another glance round and under
the benches, PECKHAM hurried out.
Searched all his old familiar ways;
came back hatless.
“You should have borrowed a blood-
hound,” said MARK, when result of search
was reported.
As he sat moodily halfway down the
bench PECKHAM's eye fell upon THE BUz-
ZARD still closely following debate. He,
happy man, possessed his hat and wore
it on his head. Something in the shape
attracted attention. Casually drawing
(Loud laughter.)
nearer, PECKIIAM had his first impression
confirmed. There was no strawberry
mark about it, but it undoubtedly was
his long lost hat. In a moment of
absence of mind, impressed by cogency
of SoN AUSTEN's latest speech on Budget
Itesolutions, The BUzzARD had stretched
forth his hand, taken up PEckham's hat
and put it on. Nothing in discrepancy
of size suggested mistake.
“I beg your pardon,” PECRHAM loudly
whispered in his ear, “but you're
wearing my hat.”
“Yes,” said The Buzz \RD, modding
genially, thinking he was being compli-
mented on his mastery of intricacies of
the Budget, “I’m beginning to get my
head into it.”
“Dear old chap,” said PECKHAM, ten-
derly brushing with coat-sleeve the nap
of recaptured hat, “he’s so deaf he
doesn't know one hat from another.”

perforce still waiting for eight Dread-
noughts, noble lords have turned their
attention to condition of the Army. Yes-

attack on Territorial Force. Described
it as totally failing in object for which
it was designed. Puting assertion in
another way, NEWTON roundly declared
that, “except for a few simple minded

persons, bewildered by the brazen clap-
trap of Mr. HALDANE, no one is under
any illusion as to our military position.’’
YoUNG WEMYss invited House to pass
l{esolution calling upon Government to
take immediate steps to place Army in
impregnable position of defence.
Situation a little embarrassing for
noble lords on Front Opposition Bench.
If they supported motion it would prac-
tically pledge them, when in office, to
establish and maintain an army of a
million men. Moreover alleged situation
awkward for them. The Boy Bois,
writing on his golden wedding day,
comes to assistance of his nonagenarian
friend, YoUNG WEMyss. Whenever he

British Army in respect of capacity,

organisation and general efficiency, Bobs
goes back to the period when it was, and
had with brief interval been for fourteen
years, in hands of late Government. At
it again yesterday.
“I have,” he wrote to You Ng WEMyss,
“no hesitation in stating that our armed
ſorces as a body are as absolutely unfitted
and unprepared for war as they were in
1899-1900.” * ,
I'.-M. MiDLETON winced. CAwpoſt,
Leader of Opposition pro tem. in absence
of LANSDOWNE from cause which all
regret, beseeches YoUNG WEMYss not to
divide. Such course would, he said,
“ place noble lords in an invidious posi-
tion.” That not a consideration to
which WEMYss is habitually amenable.
Flourishing Bobs's letter as if it were a
battle flag, insists on division. Where-
upon ex-Ministers flee, followed by loyal
lords, and down-trodden Government to
their amazement find themselves victors
in Division Lobby by majority of four.
Attack resumed to-day under different
auspices with other results. That man
of war BEDFord comes to the front.
Demonstrates that the Army is in abso-
lutely rotten state. Demands instant
searching enquiry. CREWE, smilingly
watching the President of the Zoo-
logical Society in this new rôle,
hummed :--
“Duke Bedford was a soldier bold
And used to war's alarms;
But a cannon ball took off his legs,
So he laid down his arms."
That of course merely a trope. So far
from laying down his arms, the gallant
Duke, backed by full force of Oppo-
sition, carried them to victory. Front
Bench unreservedly supported motion
for enquiry, and CREWE, leading into
Division Lobby his forlorn score of
fighting men, was beaten by a majority
of half a hundred. -

Business done.—Commons do further
talking round Budget Resolutions.
MooRE throws lurid light on operation
in Ireland of Stamp Duties charged on

evidently struck by unfair incidence of
the impost in cases where a landowner
contracts inconvenient habit of fre-
quently dying. --
House of Commons, Wednesday.—
CATHCART WASON as broad-minded as he
is vast-shouldered, as high-principled
as his stature is lofty. Ever tries to do
the fair thing as between man and man
—or even woman. Admits that this
afternoon he carried his method a little
too far. On motion to consider Lords'
amendments to India Councils Bill,
Ch.ATTERJEE RUTHERFord opposed and
insisted on Division. WASON, making
the full circuit of the Chamber, voted
in both Lobbies, ranging himself with
the “Ayes” in one, adding corpulence
to the “Noes" in the other.
Theoretically nothing could be fairer;
in practice the procedure is not to be
commended as effacing a vote. SARK
says the next thing we shall hear about
CATHCART is that he has paired with
himself.
At Question time angry debate sprang
up round Captain BACON's letter to First
Sea Lord, in which he spoke disrespect-
fully of an hon. Member alluded to as
“the bellicose BELLAIRs.” In accordance
with Admiralty practice, the letter was
printed and a number of copies struck
off. One, misappropriated, reached B.B.,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INTERNATIONAL AND IMPERIAL CRIME
EXHIBITION, 1910,
AT THE GREAT BLACK CITY.
Exhibitions are becoming so popular,
and, at any rate with regard to side-
shows, so remunerative, that intense
rivalry is expected in the near future,
and also a good deal of ingenuity in
hitting upon new subjects to illustrate
by stall and entertainment. No one
will therefore be surprised to learn
that preparations are already far ad-
vanced for the opening, in May, 1910,
of the great Criminal Exhibition at
Hounslow. Heath. As the sympathetic
co-operation of Scotland Yard has been
enlisted, the success of the Exhibition
is already assured, and even a hasty
sketch of its scope and features will
reveal the unique and transcendent
interest of the exhibits. - -
To begin with, the promoters have
been happily advised in securing the
best convict bands and choirs from all
the great prisons—the Princeton Sym-
phony orchestra and the Holloway Pill-
harmonic Choral Society. By a wel-
come deviation from the established
convention, long hair will be conspicuous
by its absence. This circumstance, to-
gether with thesuppression of performers'
names, nothing but numbers being used,
is expected to win for the Exhibition
the cordial support of a novelty-loving
public, fed up, to use an Americanism,
with the hirsute extravagance and dis-
cordant polysyllables of the ordinary
musician. -
The Lake, a splendid sheet of water,
has been laid out so as to illustrate the
history of penal settlements. It will
contain a miniature Devil's Island and a
reduced. Botany Bay, and visitors will
be able to go for trips in real galleys,
rowed by live criminals chained to the
oars. There is also to be a baby Bospho-
rus, on which sack-and-bowstring trips
at 3d. a head (or body) will take place
all day long. Connected with the lake,
in the form of a sinuous loop, is a stream
happily named the Turpintine, after the
famous highwayman. - -
Arrangements have been made for the
erection of a charming Siberian village,
in which authentic anarchists, some of
them of the highest rank, will be seen
at work in specially refrigerated cells.
The entrance fee to this, as the York-
shireman said, will be “Nowt.”
The Flip Flap will give place to a
gigantic treadmill, from the upper steps
of which an unparalleled view of London
will be obtainable. This will be known
as “The Golden Stairs.”
A very interesting booth will be de-
voted to kleptomania in all its branches,
with trained kleptomaniacs, many of
them titled, visiting sale counters and
showing how it is done. Scotland Yard
are promising a number of the more
sensitive police to illustrate the arrest of
kleptomaniacs and the expression of
surprise (and possibly relief) on dis-
covering that it is no vulgar case of
theft, but a highly specialised disease
more common among the well-to-do than
the poor.
A phrenologist will be in attendance,
with a candle, to feel the bumps of
magistrates.
The Daily Mail building, better known
at the last Exhibition, if we remember
aright, as the Copper Cupola, will not
be lacking, but in the Crimes Exhibi-
tion it will take the form of an arena for
performances of “Robbing the Mail
Daily.” - --
-In a model of the Marylebone Police
Court a gramophone will give recitals
at intervals of Mr. Powdſ.N's best things.
In the Irish village will be shown
cattle-driving every aſternoon and even-
ing, real peasants and real “ hazels”
being employed under the supervision
of Mr. GINNELL. In another part of the
Exhibition Irish crime will be manufac-
tured in the usual way.
It is expected that few pavilions will
be more popular than that devoted to
Sherlock Holmes, under the control of
Sir ARTilult CoNAN Doyle. Detectives at
work will there be seen through smoked
glass. Traces of crime invited. Sir
ARTHUR will draw inferences from foot-
prints and cigar-ash from 3 to 11 daily.
But perhaps the most popular show
of all will be the factory of spurious
china, embellished with portraits of the
most successful dealers in this ware and
their clients. Any Sèvres or Dresden
articles copied while you wait, so
closely as to defy detection. -
The Truth pillory for magistrates will
be erected between the rabbit-smaring
compound and the wiſe-beaters' home.
On its artistic side the Exhibition
will be unusually strong. Portraits of
all the most eminent peculators in the
history of the world will be on view, and
a whole gallery will be devoted to busts
of the best bankrupts. Arrangements
have been made with The Daily Mirror
for constant relays of portraits of popu-
lar swindlers. Naturally a prominent
place among the works of art will be
given to RAPHAEL's cartoon of the “Death
of Ananias,” and ALFRED STEVENS’ “False-
hood plucking the Tongue from Truth.”
Among the artistic crimes will be an
exact model of the Albert Memorial.
Arrangements for catering have been
placed in the hands of the firm which
now gets everything of this kind. In
addition to their ordinary restaurants
they will have a specially select one for
ex-convicts, called The Oakum Club.
Free skilly will be served on the opening
day, at which it is expected the Duke of
Allguile will preside.
AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RIGHES.
I HAVE, adjoining my garden, a plot
of land of the agricultural value of, say,
ten shillings per annum. Upon it I
graze one goat, and sometimes-—when
nobody is looking—practise putting and
very short approaches. My children also
have the use of it for the purpose of
playing horses. Hitherto I have re-
garded my possession of it with a mild
complacency, but now I picture myself
strolling round my estate some morn-
ing, looking for a stalk of grass long
enough to clear my pipe, when I see
approaching me a saturnine young man
with a black bag. Thinking he has come to
sell a sewing machine or wants to mend
the clocks, I put on my stern-look and
say, “Not to-day, thank you.” It has no
effect upon him. It never has at the first
go-off. So I repeat it in a higher key.
“I have come,” he says coldly, “to
assess your mineral wealth.”
“Oh! that need not detain you long.”
I say cheerfully, as I dive intony trousers
pocket. “Four and ninepence half-
penny.” *
“I was not referring to what you have
gotten,” says he in his supercilious way.
“Another kind of collector will look
after that. But what have you got in
the ungotten line? No doubt...there is
a rich seam of coal under here.”… .
I hope the refining influences of my
early training will never wholly desert
me, even in the presence of a Land Tax
Inquisitor.
“If you are looking at that lump of
Wallsend,” I reply pleasantly, “it’s
merely a piece I threw yesterday from
my bedroom window to drive a snail off
my putting green.” - --- .
“I’ll put down ‘coal,’” says he,
writing in his note-book, “and it's open to
you to disprove its existence if you can.”
“If I an? But how can I ?”)
He shrugs his shoulders. “You must
sink a bore.” . . w -
“With all the pleasure in the world.”
I reply heartily. “I have a briek, and
a piece of string. If you will have the
goodness to take off your. collar and
accompany me to the river, I know
where there is a deep hole--"
But he is naturally impervious to
insult. . . . . . . . .
“And now as to your other ungotten
minerals,” he remarks, as he sharpens
his pencil.
“It might be as well,” I say in my
most biting manner, “if you were to
tell me at once how far down you pro-
pose to assess me. I have always under-
stood that the other end of my little
property is in a liquescent or molten
state. It's almost sure to embrace a
little brinstone and lava; I've seen
quite nice brooches made of lava, so it

due time I see myself receiving a demand

With this weighing upon me it may
readily be imagined how impossible it is
for me to earn an income big enough to
satisfy the standard of the super-tax
collector. What the Government is
losing in this way will never be known.
But I do know that rapacity sometimes
defeats its own ends.

half-an-ounce of it would beggar me.
And then there is ungotten iridium and
tellurium to be considered, to say nothing
of stannium, molybdenum . . .
And it would take I don't know how
many generations of us to dig 4,000
miles in order to disprove the existence
of these things. And remote posterity,
claiming rebate, would be sure to be
repulsed by some Statute of Limitations.
The man who wrote my Latin
rammar did well to remark that
“riches are dug-up, an incitement to
evil.” But he never guessed the curse
of riches before they are dug up.
I wish to have nothing to do with
them. I only ask to be left with “Wat

after the man who has now become my
favourite character in history) in the

Would the Chancellor of the Ex-

A TAXI, it is well known, will, when
you can get one, carry two persons for
the same price and the same tip as
one, and three and four at an extra six-
pence each for any distance. This being
so, it has occurred to an enterprising
and ingenious stationer in Jermyn
Street (where the economical bachelors
for the most part dwell) to print a
number of placards, which he retails
at sixpence, each bearing a different

small thing. Again:

This, it is expected, will be very popular,
and one can easily supply others from
one's own imagination.
Of course, the prosperity of the scheme
depends largely upon the success with
which one can hire a taxi. At present
London is full of them (we are told), but
how to get one is a recurring problem.

[JUNE 2, 1909.
A HARMONY IN SPLITS.
[Colonel MARK Lockwood, in the regrettable absence of the Chairman
of the Kitchen Committee, announced, amid much laughter, that the
“super-tax” of 1d on every glass of whisky supplied to the House
had been reduced by one-half, and that the charge would be 3%d. for
short measures and 6%d for long ones. By buying a double portion
Members could save one half-penny on the cost of two single portions.
The following lines are supposed to be addressed to the gallant
Colonel by a member of the opposite Party.]
CoLoREL! you have the cause of Peace at heart;
The recent spirit-crisis proves you rich in
Those qualities that so become your part
As Acting-Chairman of the Commons Kitchen–
Stern scion of a warrior breed,
Yet like a mother in our homely need
What time you filled the void we all deplore,
Due to the absence of Sir A. JACOBY,
Changed was the voice that in the battle's roar
Would cry," Wa victis!” (“To the vanquished woe be!”);
Soft were the tones and even fluty
In which you dwelt upon the whisky duty.
Thanks to the Budget, we were asked to blow
An extra penny piece on every portion;
Whether we took a short or lengthy go
There was the same intolerable extortion :
But you have halved the fiscal fee,
And oh, the blessed diſference to me !
Our drams, moreover, as you pointed out,
If in a double dose we shrewdly bought 'em
(As would be natural in a session's drought
Likely to last well on into the Autumn),
Should, by a simple calculation,
Save us a solid sou on each potation.
And here, as in a glass, I roughly trace
The solvent you have sought for party passion;
I recognise a subtle means of grace
In the long draught that men may split their cash on :
When rival wits their toddy share,
They constitute the true ideal “pair.”
Drowned in a blend of barley, malt and rye,
Behold our hot imaginations cooling !
The two Front Benches, seeing eye to eye,
Shall join, by means of spirituous pooling,
In harmonies of whisky-soda,
Capped by a clinching undiluted coda.” O. S.

mination of a composition.”—Webster. -
|N CHAMBERS.
THE CHOICE OF A PROFESSION.
If the following discussion took place at all (which you are
not bound to believe) it must be admitted that it was not a
business matter. Jones, Senior and Junior, were personal
friends of Counsel, and came to consult him upon the matter
as such. To be a barrister does not deprive a man of the
greatest pleasure in life, the advising of friends gratis upon
the better conduct of their own private affairs. The fact
that the giving of advice took place in chambers does not
make the matter a professional one, but does justify its
inclusion in the present series.
It appears that, for as long as Jones Junior could, Jones
Junior had avoided the subject of what he was going to be.
But though Jones Senior loved his son with a great love he
could not contemplate with equanimity the prospect of main-
taining him in leisured ease for ever.
The time had at last !
arrived at which a choice of professions for Jones Junior
became imperative. -
“Jones Senior,” said Jones Junior, “what am I going
to be 2''
“Be a Poet,” said Jones Senior.
“Not if I know it,” said Jones Junior, with unconscious
aptness. - º
“If you will not be a Poet,” said Jones Senior, “be a
Socialist.”
“Father,” said Jones Junior reprovingly, “I am serious.”
And Jones Senior, not being able to see for the life of him
why a Socialist should not be a serious Socialist, ceased sug-
gesting. Jones Junior thereupon went through the category
of professions, and had no difficulty in showing how un-
suited he was for each of them. Jones Senior, who, unlike
most fathers, was amenable to argument, sorrowſully admitted
the truth of his son's words, and matters seemed to have come
to a permanent impasse, when Jones Junior was struck
with a brilliant idea. Who could deny that the practice of
Crime was a profession at once engrossing, original, lucrative
and sporting 2 That was the pith of Jones Junior's sugges-
tion, and Jones Senior, whose moral fibre was of the weakest,
at once fell in with it. It was at this point that Counsel
was consulted. , - - - -
The first question that he maturally put was as to which
side of the profession Jones Junior should adopt—Felony or
Misdemeanour. “Without advancing an opinion as to the
merits of either,” said J.J., “I refuse from the outset to
devote my life to mere Misdemeanours, a course of conduct
which, to the uninformed layman at any rate, appears to
consist of little else than eating potatoes with your knife, and
unpunctuality. No, if I go in for Crime I go in for Felony;
and if I go in for Felony I go in for Murder.” -
“Well spoken, Sir,” said Counsel; “but do you quite
realise what Murder is ? I have here a small handbook
which will give us a precise definition of that trade. “The
word murder is derived from the Germanic MORTH . . .”.”
“We may perhaps onlit that part,” said Jones Senior.
“‘. . . It consists of (1) unlawfully (2) killing (3) a reason-
able creature (4) who is in being (5) and under the King's
Peace (6) with malice aforethought . . .”
“Is there much more?” asked Jones Junior, anxiously.
“‘. . . (7) the death following within a year and a day.’”
“Dropping for a moment the other six points, what may
‘malice aforethought' be?”
“I will read that to you,” said Counsel. But at the end
of the first twenty minutes' reading the Joneses interrupted,
“We do not on the whole think that we can manage it.”
Counsel felt bound to agree with them. “Not only is
there that complication, but the slightest slip will turn all
your efforts into mere Manslaughter, and there is always the
danger that you might in the end achieve a Homicide, which
might not only be Excusable, but actually Justifiable. Let
us try Burglary.”
“That is a good idea,” said Jones Senior, not because he
thought Counsel clever, but because he had just thought of
that himself.
“‘. . . Breaking and entering at night with intent to
commit some felony therein a dwelling house, a church or a
walled town.” How would that suit you?”
“The idea of the ‘walled town' is, of course, childish,”
said J.J., “but the other part seems more feasible. I think
I will take Burglary.”
“Without any desire to baulk you of your choice, I must
remind you that not only does the barest description of
“breaking and entering’ fill sixty-three pages, but there is
also required a Mens Rea.”
“And what is a Mens Rea '.'
“Much the same as Malice Aſorethought, only a chapter
and a half longer.”

From all things underfoot you felt revolt,
Skyward you fixed your passionate regard,
An other-worldly poult.
Your voice as well, that ushered in the morn,
And roused the farmer from his rural crib,
Clear as the clarion of a motor-horn
(And reproduced ad lib.)—
This also marked you from the common group
Of mortal creatures with their few brief suns;
Mrs. J. Q. P. (with relief). “Oh you speak ENgilish?”
You were not meant to know an earthly coop,
Nor pace terrestrial runs.
And so, in death, 'twas but the baser part
(That had not known the thrill of joy and pain,
The hope to soar, the ecstasy of art, -
Your legs, to make it plain)--
'Twas only these that served our simple clay,
And passed the boundaries of human lips;
And I have dined on one of them to-day
With pommes de terre in chips.
But not the breast !—where beat the ardent soul
Which made you challenger of rival kings:
That mounted up to some ethereal goal,
Rapt on your seraph wings.
“How do you know,” the careless scoffer seeks,
“What after-world awaits domestic brutes ?”
“Have I not dined " (I answer) “liere for weeks
On limbs as tough as boots?”
And when the waiter hears my murmured plaint
He tells me (with that low respectful cough,
As who should speak of some departed saint)
The nobler parts are off.
“Off!” How he puts it in a single word!
I see you cast your mortal coil and rise,
Leaving no relic of the carnal bird
Save amputated thighs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JuxE 2, 1909.
OOR JAMIE.
[Mr. Punch is unable to explain the following
article. He sent his special Sporting Corre-
spondent to Birmingham (at great expense) to
report the Test Match, and this is all that he
has received in exchange. Whether his corre-
spondent read Mr. JAMEs Douglas's book, Adren-
tures in London, during the luncheon intervals,
and unconsciously assimilated that writer's
style; or whether the expert article intended
for this paper is, by some accident of the post,
now in the offices of The Morning Leader,
Mr. Punch cannot presume to say.]
HAIR-BREADTH ESCAPES IN BIRMINGHAM.
The other morning, being afflicted by
the crudity of the Carlton, I drifted into
Birmingham. A vast crowd of men
was pursuing its way with single intent-
ness of purpose in one direction. They
looked neither to the right nor to the
left. They did not even look at me.
My curiosity was stimulated. Where
was this vast crowd drifting 2 Moved
by a whim, I followed them. This was
indeed an adventure. What on earth
was going to happen 2
And then suddenly it flashed on me
that I had stumbled upon a “Test
Match.” A game of crickets between the
glorious manhood of this happy isle
“set in a silver sea" and the equally
glorious manhood of that other island,
Australia. In my boyhood there used
to be a ca'ch question we asked one of
the other, “Which is the biggest island
in the world’” When the answer
came, “Borneo,” or whatever it might
be, then swift as a razor-stroke flashed
the triumphant retort, “No, Australia.”
Perhaps the objection would be made,
and sustained by childish recourse to
ſisticuſis, that Australia was not an
island, but a continent—I cannot re-
member. At any rate England was now
playing Australia at this game of crickets,
on this ground at Birmingham, whither
I had drifted. -
Two men armed with blades of willow
standat the wickets. Two others—clothed
in white smocks, the emblem of Justice
and Truth stand by to see fair play.
The ends of their dark trousers project
from beneath their white smocks as if to
show that they are but human after all.
Indeed my neighbour informs me in a
whisper that when just now old LILLEY
appealed for a leg-snap the men in the
white smocks would not allow the
appeal. Verily, to err is human.
“ Blooming beggar must have been
blind,” says my neighbour.
I tell him that Justice is proverbially
blind.
Round the wickets eleven men are
placed at craftily cunning angles. One
of them, strange to say, is swathed and
gauntletted, though the day is warm.
It gives him a strangely overdressed
appearance. Yet in a subtle way it
makes one feel that whatever comes he
will be ready for it. Beside him the
others look bare, unclothed. Uproari-
ously nude. This over-dressed man is a
very JASON among them. He reminds
me of Pelleas. He reminds me of
HARRY LAUDER. º
I ask my neighbour to point out
this LILLEY to me. There he is, over
there. It is our swathed and gaunt-
letted friend. The over-dressed man.
So that is GEORGE LILLEY.
The ball is bowled. It flies through
the air with the swiftness of the swallow
and the subtle swoop of the snipe.
The batsman flings his bat at it
viciously, as one slashes at a thistle.
There is a click. And then echoing
over the sward comes LILLEY's voice,
“How 's that ?”
It is a wonderful voice, of a modulated
resonance that would touch a TETRAzzINI
to tears. It has echoing deeps in it like
velvet darkness, and the syllables are
soft plumes of sound. On the upper
register it writhes into discordance, but
on the lower it is a plastic harmony.
It lingers and stirs and embraces and
clings. It stabs but leaves no scar. It
is all violet voluptuousness. It-–"I
shall get it soon . . .
There is a ragged volley of appeal
from lesser voices. The man in the
white smock bites it into silence. “Out,”
he snaps. And in the interval of waiting
for the next batsman my companion
points out A. C. MACIAREN to me.
So that is MACLAREN. “ARTHUR,” my
neighbour calls him familiarly. It is a
friendly game, this game of crickets. I
shall call him ARTHUR, too. Am I not
initiate now 2 One of the great cricket-
loving manscape of England 2
ARTIli R MACIAREN. I wonder what the
“C” stands for. Colu MBUs, possibly ;
or CATO. No, surely it is CROMWELL–
the leader of men. For this ARTHUR
MACLAREN dominates his fellows as a
pretty actress at the Carlton dominates
the swain who attends her thither. He
is a clean-cut king among men. One
perceives that he is a fighter, iron-grey
and doughty. He should be wearing
a plume in his helmet, a breastplate
of gold ; gleaming greaves should be
on his calves. At the least he should
have the leg guards and gauntlets.
He stands at his ease, tossing the jolly
red ball from one hand to the other. If
he were a conjurer he would turn it into
a rabbit. One feels that he would have
made a good conjurer, and that it would
have been a good rabbit. Now I look
at him again he reminds me of BERTRAM.
He has the nose of a CESAR. It stands
out like a cliff. It is the Scawfell of
nervous vitality. I could write a book
about his nºse. He is as delightfully
English as the KAIs...R is German. You
could not imagine a German MACIAREN.
He reminds me of Iłis MARCK. I have
met him somewhere, I feel certain;
perhaps on the heights of Olympus,
perhaps at the Carlton. He stands there,
at short mid-wickets, this ARTHUR MAC-
LAREN, a white glamour of fluent curves;
and it would take a SHAKSPEARE, a
SHELLEY, a WATTs-DUNTON to sing his
praise.
It is a great game, our game of
crickets. The rout of youth climbs its
shattering way through the playing fields
of Eton to the headstrong heights of
Tugela, untainted by the meretricious
yesterdays. Out of the throat of the
brutal past we have bitten our way to
chivalry. Our soul is toxic with the
delight of battle, aflame with the acrid
keenness of its scent. This is the
effervescing secret of our inheritance.
This is the battle of nations—England
against Australia.

MORE “UNGOTTEN’’ MINERALS.
As a true Englishman and patriot my
motto is, “Every (other) Briton must
pay his income tax.” My objection to
Income Tax Commissioners is that they
persist in concentrating their attention
on me instead of harrying notorious
evaders. However, of one thing I am
certain—too much study of the Budget
proposals is unwise—especially last thing
at night.
The first part of my dream was not so
bad. I had been hunted into my hen-
roost by a covetous Chancellor. With a
view to gaining favour in his Noncon-
formist eyes I posed as a Passive
Resister. Unfortunately this did not
appeal to him in his official capacity.
He handed me an Income Tax form and
sternly bade me fill it up.
This was quite easy. -
Earned income, £300. Income derived
from houses, buildings, land, roller
skating rinks, Rand mines, tithe, and
breweries, nil. Total Income, £300, from
which I could deduct £150 on account
of fifteen children all under the age of
sixteen.
Net income £150, of which £160 is
exempt (which, as Euclid would observe
in his concise way, is absurd).
Income for Taxation purposes, minus
9d, and said politely to the Chancellor,
“As far as I can make out the Govern-
ment owes me 7 s. 6d. I might have
charged you on the 1s. 2d. rate, as you
have not earned it, but I am a patriot.
Please give me 7 s. 6d. and eight Dread-
noughts at once.” |
The Chancellor scowled at the form.

rich uncles with a quarter of a million

“it would be easier for a Church School

DEVOTEES OF DISCORD AT QUEEN'S HALL.
TELEPATHY or KLEPTOMANIA 2
WE have been favoured—if the term can be ſittingly
employed in such a context—with an advanced proof of the
analysis of a work entitled Ode to Discord, perpetrated by
Sir Charles Stanford, which is to be performed by the New
DESIGN FOR AN ODE TO DISCORD.
Symphony Orchestra at Queen's Hall on the 9th inst.
We have been spared the “poem,”—a considerate onission,
to judge from the music, which is throughout in an
advanced stage of de-composition, but the perusal of this
preliminary document, which describes the Ode as “A
Chimerical Bombination in Four Bursts,” has filled us
with mingled feelings, in which anxiety predominates.
Thus we read that the orchestra will be reinforced on this
occasion “by a Hydrophone, a Tamburone Tombastico, a
'real Jamboon, and a Contrabass-Macaroon,” while the
dramatis persona, include “Chromatic Brigands, Double-
'sharpers, Contrapunters, and syncopated Suffragetti.” This
is bad, but worse follows. Thus in the opening movement
a reference to waterfalls is suggested by the soft ‘swishing’
(to borrow a graphic Eton phrase) of the Hydrophone,” while
in the Second Burst our attention is called to the following
“beautiful progression on the trumpets:–
which passes into a resumption of the main theme (No. 7) in
E flat minor, and shortly after in E major, where the Trombones,
i the bloodhounds of the orchestra, triumphantly bay it out in
full force.” The Burst ends with the impressive Invocation
of the Bass Tuba, which enters with a booming roar, and, after
striking the astonished firmament and rebounding therefrom,
descends (by request) to his lowest note
o: 11.) *E=== -
~r
-
The Third Movement or Burst partakes of the nature of an
Oasis in a Grand Sahara of Cacophony, but in the Finale, to
quote from the analysis, “the forces of Discord again awake,
and their resuscitation is indicated by a Prelude founded on
snatches of a theme which continually dominates the move-
ment. This subject is admittedly a chromatic version of the
well-known Volkslied, - -- ---
... • “Wir wollen nicht bis Morgen fruh
Nach Hause wieder gehen’
(literally, “We will not go home again until early to-morrow
morning'), - . - - -
as will be evident from the following quotations:–

the first being the subject of a fugue, in which the ‘blithe
Anarchs ' disport themselves to... the manner born. The
booming of the Chimaera, personified by the Tuba Mirabilis,
is heard through the tumult, while the chromatic scales of
the Anarchs crowd round it. As the welter proceeds, phrases
from the main theme of Burst the Second (No. 7) appear, the
approach of a climax being heralded by the organ-tuner's
scale, ascending step by step, all three themes combining at
the longed-for appearance of ‘the Hideous.' The Volkslied
now rears its hitherto diminished head in an augmented
form, when the movement reaches the key (more recognisable,
perhaps, by its signature of one sharp than by its sound) of
G major ; the solemn notes of the organ accentuate the piety
of the throng,
(No. 19.) éº-

and a series of strepitously explosive augmented fifths leads
to the high-water mark of sonority, where the unhappy |
Volkslied is thundered out in both forms, simultaneously
dovetailed. **

A short allusion to the theme (No. 7), a rush of descending
chromatic diminished fifths, and a swirl of the Hydrophone
indicate the sudden hush of the Anarchs as they hear their
inevitable fate approaching. Then the Outraged Volkslied
asserts itself on the Horns of its Dilemma in its true Diatonic
colours:— -

and the Trumpets also are just expressing their determina-
tion to put off their return home until the Diatonic Daylight,
when the Goddess once more comes to the rescue of the
affrighted Anarchs, and with a fortissimo “Hence, loathèd
melody,’ and a shout of reprobation from the Chorus, the last
vestige of Tomality departs.”
Enough has been quoted to indicate the nature of this
appalling work. But what Mr. Punch wants to know is
whether such onslaughts ought to be allowed to be made
on the unprotected tympana of the British public with
impunity? Ought composers to be permitted to tax the
systems of performers without being super-taxed in turn ?
These are only a few of the thoughts prompted by a perusal
of this blood-curdling analysis. And this is not merely a
question of mational hygiene. Graver issues are involved by
the composer's unscrupulous use of themes clearly borrowed,
though in perverted form, from composers who in most cases
are no longer able to protest against this treatment. Tele-
pathy can hardly explain this op-liſting from BEETHovey and
WAGNER. Kleptomania is probably the most charitable
excuse that can be put forward.
Mr. Punch notes in conclusion that this lurid forecast of
the music of the future has been appropriately illustrated by
the pencil of an artist mamed MoRRow. The scene depicted
is that of the Shrine of Discord, in which the goddess, holding
her notorious apple in one hand and a broken tuning-fork in ||
the other, surveys the orgies of her votaries with contorted
features and eyeballs askew. Note in the foreground the
ignominious exit of the old masters—MozART, HAYDN, BEET- |
hovex, etc.—one of them minus an ear, and all deluged by
streams of water ejected from the nozzle of the hydrophone.

He had a jewelled holder for his seven-inch cigar;

with rings, -
And on his chest were diamond stars and other costly things.
His waistcoats were a sight to see , their buttons were of
gold; - - -
His shirts were trimmed with yards of lace, light-brown and
very old. . - -
His bath-taps ran with ruby wine, and when he combed his

With golden combs you felt he was indeed a millionaire.
I cannot tell the thousand things that went to make him

And all the moneyed deeds he did, and all he could have

His butler was a ruined Duke ; his footmen, you could see,
Were youths of ancient lineage and very high degree.
His housemaids were a giddy throng of twenty titled girls,
And every day his boots were brushed by Marquises or

Of course you know the reason well: Lloyd GEORGE had taxed
them all ; -
With one accord they left their Park, their Castle or their

Gave up the smiling pleasances they formerly had graced,
And chose to serve a millionaire of cultivated taste.
Things are not as they used to be –somehow they never were;
These Budget days are dark for all, since all must pay a

But from my mind one memory can never be effaced—
My meeting with a millionaire of cultivated taste.
It may be remembered that a fortnight ago we commented
upon the disposition of parts of the Hertford crew to train
independently of each other, and recommended them to meet
during the races. We now read in The Sportsman :-
“On Thursday Queen's, through a mishap in the boat, lost a place to
Hertford, but the latter made amends on this occasion, and, gaining
rapidly by the Weirs Bridge, caught Hertford as the boats were coming
out of the Gut.”
From which it would seem that they took our advice. On

House of Lords, Monday, May 24.—In

“I say, Mr. Speaker, without fear of contra-
diction, that it is without exception the finest,
the best, etc., etc.”--ad infinitum.
- (Sir Henry Craik)
moment of happy inspiration, Lord
LowAT, sixteenth Baron, fell upon a way
that seems to point to revolu-
tion in procedure. Had on the
paper a question addressed to
UNDER SECRETARY FOR WAR touch-
ing details of Territorial Force.
Having submitted it, he re-
marked that it was hopeless
to expect information from the
Government.
“I shall therefore,” he said,
“endeavour to answer the ques-
tion myself;” and straightway
proceeded to do so.
Of course the principle un-
derlying this innovation is not
new. Readers of Dombey and
Son remember how the eldest
of Dr. Blimber's pupils at
Brighton chiefly occupied his
time in writing long letters
to himself from persons of
distinction, addressed “P.
Toots, Esq., Brighton, Sussex.”
Never before has it been
applied to the business of
Parliament. Its advantages are
obvious. Valuable time will be
saved to overworked officials of
the State who now spend their
early mornings in preparing
answers to multifarious ques-
tions, the large majority trivially
controversial. It will avoid
heated temper; above all, will
stay the pestilence of supple-
mentary questions.
No noble lord (and very few hon.
Members), having answered his own
question, would immediately after re-
suming his seat jump up again and
remark, “Arising out of that reply, I
beg to ask whether——,” and so on.
It happened that shortly before this
happy thought struck Low AT in the
Lords a new turn was given to Ques-
tions in the Commons by action of the
PRIME MINISTER. DR. FELL, round whose
personality still lingers mental mistiness
as to why he should not be personally
lovable, attempted to pose PREMIER with
inquiry as to how he reached the con-
clusion that 9%d. was the average rate of
Income Tax paid last year.
“Sir,” said the PREMIER, “the figure
of 9;d. is arrived at by dividing the
total yield of the tax by the aggregate
income of taxable persons coming under
review by the Commissioners of Inland
Revenue. The other figures are ob-
tained by multiplying the figure of 9%d.
by the estimated yield in a full year of
the tax after the proposed alterations
have been made, excluding and includ-
ing the super-tax, and dividing by its
estimated yield on the existing basis.”
DR. FELL's countenance, as this pains-
taking explanation proceeded, was a
pleasing study. As the syllables fell in
slow utterance stonier and stonier grew
its absence of expression. When the

Mr. Healy, infuriated by Mr. Harold Cox, who had thrown

sionate fervour that “they [the Irish] had to wear the shoe, and all
they knew was that the proof of the pudding was in the eating.”

Tay Pay explains that the reason of its
superiority (pace Sir John Dewar and others!)
to Scotch wij is that it “lies idle so much
longer.” (The mere mention of the matter will
probably be sufficient to incite the Irish con-
sumer to remedy this national shortcoming.)
Here is another useful hint. If in
forthcoming holidays ADMIRAL McKENNA
will prepare for MANGNALL's-
QUESTIONS ASHLEY a few answers
constructed on this model, it
would lead to the saving of
precious time and would earn
the gratitude of Members whose
questions standing lower down
on the list are habitually cut
out by his expansive curiosity.

even more liberal might be done—has

for several years benefited by it.
TIM consumed with wrath at this
evasion. Protection pleased him not,
nor Free Trade either.
“They are both false,” he said, with
that impartiality that marks the really
arge mind. “There is nothing right or
wrong about either. What suits you is
best.”
Irishmen were in the most advan-
tageous position for knowing whether
Ireland was well treated or not.
“We have to wear the shoe," cried
TIM, shaking a fearsome forefinger at
the cringing figure of the CHANCELLOR
of THE Exchequeſt, “and all we know is
that the proof of the pudding is in the
eating.” -
This suggestion of a sort of shoe

high-lows baked in a pie, per- .
plexed the crowded House. Al-
ready its withers lad been
wrung by the testimony of Mr.
Gol LI'ING, based on the opinion
of an expert, as to the peculiar
quality of tobacco grown in Ire-
land. It seems that a cow could
ſill herself (as if she were a pipe)
with the home-grown plant and
“would not have a pain.”
Whereas if the same discrimi-
nating quadruped wºre to browse
on American tobacco - plants
“ the results would be devas-
tating.” - -
All this was plain sailing com-
pared with TIM's mystic sugges-
tion of the top boot or blucher
pudding.

tainly it blew from the north-east, but
was wholesome in its energy and fresh-

pant raging at England and all that is

simple eloquence. “England," TIM said,
in voice trembling with suppressed
emotion, “ has done her best to turn the
perfumed garden of Ireland into a
blackened potato patch.”

confidence in impregnability of their

a penny on the price of a full glass of
whisky, with glaring absence of mathe-
matical precision adding a similar sum to
the half glass. But even the worm will
turn. There followed an outburst of
angry indignation, for parallel to which
SARK says you must go back to the
epoch that saw birth given to the Bill

hauled down their flag halfway. The
supertax was reduced one halfpenny.

yield a slight increase of profits. On the
other hand must be taken into account
the virtue of inculcating temperance
by limiting the expenditure of hon.
Members upon alcoholic drinks. Finally,
and this was the Colonel's great point,
“Members can avoid paying the odd
halfpenny by purchasing two portions
at the same time.”
That fetched 'em. Idea had never
suggested itself. When put forward in
the simple language at MARK's command
it was so obvious. Good-humour im-
mediately restored. Members of Kitchen

JANE W. PickLES AND OTHERs.
This case came before Papa and Uncle
Toby, L.J.J., being an appeal from a
decision of Nurse, J., in the domestic
divisional court on the previous day.
Aunt Selina, K.C., appeared for the
appellant, and Cousin Teaser, K.C.
who were sued through Mamma, their
next friend.
It appeared that on the aſternoon of
March 11th the respondent Pickles, aged
eight, with two others of lesser age, were
left in the nursery under the charge of the
appellant, during the temporary absence
of Nurse. They had in their possession
a silver coin of the realm, to wit a six-
pence, which during the course of a
series of unlawful frolics the respondent
Pickles, aided and abetted by the other
respondents, wilfully and maliciously
‘dropped down the back of the appellant.
The latter with some difficulty shook the
said coin from her person and appro-
| priated it.
An action was at once
commenced before Nurse, J., on her
return. It was argued on behalf of the
defendant that the action of the plain-
tiffs in so disposing of the sixpence
clearly amounted to a constructive gift
of the money to the person down whose
back it was dropped. On the other
hand it was contended for the plaintiffs
that on account of their tender age by a
legal presumption they were irresponsible
for their actions, and that in any case
there was insufficient evidence of malice.
This view was upheld by Nurse, J., who
ordered that the money be forthwith
restored and that the defendant pay the
costs of the application. Against this
decision Jane appealed.
Aunt Selina, K.C., for the appellant.
The parting with the coin by bestowing
it upon the person of her client was
undoubtedly a constructive giſt, even
though it was not so intended by the
respondents. Moreover, there was ample
evidence of sufficient malice to rebut the
presumption in favour of the respon-
dents. Previous to the act over which
the dispute arose they had clearly been
endeavouring to cause annoyance and
discomfort to the appellant. She had
been led by fraudulent representations
into consuming a chocolate biscuit from
which the sandwiched sweetmeat had
been removed, pepper having been
substituted in its place. Counsel was
not sure that the respondents were not
indictable for the administration of
noxious drugs.
Cousin Teaser, K.C., objected. Pepper
was not a noxious drug. The condiment
in question had been provided for the
use of the family by his learned friend
herself, and if it were in any way
noxious she (his learned friend) was
indictable in the first instance.
The objection was allowed. -
Cousin Teaser, K.C., addressed the
Court with great confidence and a smut
on his nose. He wondered that his
learned friend had the face—
Aunt Selina (interrupting) was sorry
that her learned friend had such a poor
apology for one. -
Cousin Teaser did not understand.
A poor apology for what?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Aunt Selina. For a face. (Hysteria.)
Uncle Toby, L.J. This court is not a
theatre. If this disgraceful disturbance
occurs again I will have it cleared. .
Cousin Teaser. The exhibition of
puerile wit, upon which the appellant
relied to win her claim was in itself
sufficient proof of the weakness of the
case. He would however call one wit-
mess who, he hoped, would set their
lordships' minds at rest once for all.
The witness Cook was then called,
and deposed that that there Jane was
a greedy gal, she was, and never did
appreciate the pore little innercents in
their little pranks, as one might say.
Boys would be boys.
Aunt Selina objected to this part of
the evidence as irrelevant. What was
required from witness was fact, and
not aphorisms however original.
Cook (resuming) further deposed that
it weren't out o' no sense o' right and
wrong that appellant had retained
the disputed money, but because she
(appellant) were that spiteful. If she
(appellant) had had St. Paul's crammed
down her back she'd 'a' kep' it, she
would. -

state that whatever had been pushed
down this unfortunate girl's back by
these depraved young scoundrels she
would have appropriated 2
Cook (emphatically). Which I certingly
does.

the respondents to place chattels or even
hereditaments down people's back on
previous occasions 2 -
('ool didn't know albout chattels and
such like, but she distinctly remembered
that respondents had treated her in the
same manner one day last month with a
live frog, which she didn't mind, bless
their little hearts, and made witness larſ
something crool it did to see the pore
thing leppin’ about all over her (wit-
ress's) kitching.
A unt Selina (impressively). Did the
respondents on that occasion evince the
slightest desire to retain the frog in
question ?
Cook. They said it was a Valentine,
bein’, as I remember, the fourteenth o'
Febuerry. . .
A unt Selina. My Lords, I need not
further trouble you. Respondents' own
witness has admitted that under pre-
cisely similar circumstances the object
in question was a gift—may more, a
sentimental gift. I leave the issue to
your lordships' discretion.
Cousin Teaser interposed, but——
Papa, L.J., summing up, was of the
opinion that the respondents had clearly
proved their own liability.
Uncle Toby, L.J., concurred.
Appeal upheld.
:k t; ::
Respondents, who had on more than
one occasion throughout the action been
detected and reproved for making un-
seemly grimaces at the opposing Counsel,
were ordered to pay the costs, and left
the court in tears. It was later un-
officially understood that on urgent
representations from their next friend
the Court had been induced to indem-
nify the respondents out of its own
pockets.

(A True Story from Odessa.)
Three students of Odessa
Were Leo, Nic and Jan ;
They loved to smoke and crack a joke,
They loved to clink the can ;
They loved to flirt with Tessa,
Marie, and Olga too,
They loved their larks, these gay young
sparks,
As sparks are apt to do.
In vain would staid professors
Attempt by hook or crook
To wean those boys from giddy joys
And bring them all to book.
The hardened young transgressors
Just winked the other eye,
And thought, “Why turn our brains to
learn
The square of 2 + y 2
“There's Ivan ' Ivan knows it!
He loves to sit and cram,
And we’ll contrive to sit next Ive
When doing our exam.”
And so with many a prosit
To Ivan's subtle brain
They laughed and joked and chaffed and
smoked
And clinked the can again.
The day, so dread and fateful,
At length must needs arrive,
When all the three arranged to be
Close round the desk of Ive;
And, feeling duly grateful
That he was well prepared,
They made a note of what he wrote
And a + y was squared.
That night there was much dining,
And Ive was toasted well;
They wished him health, they wished
him wealth,
More times than I can tell.
But every silver lining
Must have its leaden cloud:
The pass-list came, and oh, the shame!
All four of them were ploughed
Then wroth waxed Nic and Leo,
And Jan was far from cool;
'Twas clear as day, decided they,
That Ivan was a fool ;
And straight the outraged trio
Together strode abroad,
And Ive was thrashed and kicked and
bashed
For being such a fraud.
Now sad their situation
Deep in a dungeon vault ;
Grim, grim their fate, for they await
Their trial for assault.
Yet great their provocation,
And when the lads are tried
The judge—who knows?—may think ||
their blows
Were not unjustified.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SIR John ARDAGH was of the class of men that has made,
extended, and still preserves the British Empire. For a
period of forty years, between 1868 and 1907, he was active
in the service of his country. His range of experience was
singularly wide. Gazetted to the Royal Engineers in his nine-
teenth year, he was appointed, while still young, to the post
of Secretary to the Committee on Fortifications, in which
capacity he visited Halifax and Bermuda. He was in Paris
at the occupation of the Germans, assisted at the Congress of
Berlin, served on the Bulgarian Boundary Commission, was sent
to Egypt during the crisis of which ARABI was the central
figure, fought in the Soudan, was Private Secretary to Lord
LANSDowne when Viceroy of India, was at The Hague during
the Conference of 1899, being temporarily borrowed from the
Intelligence Department, of which he was the head before
and during the Boer War. It seems to have been an impulse
and their dialogue, with its almost maddening frequency of
poetic metaphor, proclaims their origin on every page. Still,
Mr. SUTCLIFFE's pictures of Fell country are so alluring that
he has almost persuaded me to renew an old acquaintance
with it this very month; though, like the conjuror in Peter
Pan, I “haven't any hope really ” that the inhabitants will
prove such a company of inglorious Miltons as he would have
me picture them.
Another Priscilla, of Priscilla and Charybdis (CossTABLE).
was a farmer's daughter, with modern ideas on milking and
manure, whose parents married her to a plausible and well-
to-do scoundrel. Luckily, however, for her peace of mind
they were no sooner married than separated. As they were
leaving the church her newly-made husband was arrested on
a charge of fraud, and clapped into prison, and the news-
papers, shortly after his release, reported that he was
drowned. So Priscilla, guilelessly believing what they said,
married the squire, a shiſtless youth without much backbone,
and made a man and a Member of Parliament of him by the
common to the Foreign Office
and the War Office, whenever a
good man was wanted, straight-
way to send for ARDAGH.
The story of this strenuous
Life (MURRAY) is told by Lady
ARDAgh. No temptation would
have made him place it on
record with his own hand. As
modest as he was courageous
and capable, he was almost
morosely reticent about his own
achievements. This characteris-
tic was most notable during the
dark days of the Boer War.
As chief of the Intelligence De-
partment, uninstructed critics
naturally turned and rent him
when discovery was made of
the hopeless inefficiency of the
Army, and of the Administra-
tion's colossal ignorance about
the strength and resources of
the Boers. ARDAGH bore other
people's burdens in silence.

example of her own resolute
character. But, just when they
were beginning to live happily
ever after, the scoundrel turned
up again, and held a pistol at
the squire's head, one barrel
loaded with blackmail, the other
with the law, exclaiming, “Your
money or my wife " " The
squire was for giving him
neither, and must infallibly
have got the worst of the en-
counter, if a previous victim of
the scoundrel's had not saved
the situation by killing him
with a pitchfork. And, after
all, she need not have done it
(except as a relief to her own
feelings), because it turned out
that Priscilla's first marriage
had been conducted by a sham
parson. However, it's no
use crying over spilt blood,
and we must take Mr. FRANK-
FoRT MooRE's book as we find
It was only when the Royal -
Commission was appointed to inquire into the unhappy
business that disclosure was made of the fact that the
counsels and warnings of the Intelligence Department had
been systematically ignored by a Government fully and accu-
rately informed. Lady ARDAGh has done well to lift the veil
from this noble figure.
Priscilla of The Good Intent is not, as you might reasonably
suppose from the title, a seafaring romance, but a story of
life in a north-country village, as it is imagined by Mr.
HALLIwell, SUTCLIFFE. I put in that last remark because,
with every possible respect for an author of multifold
achievement, I am unable to believe a word he says about
the inhabitants of Garth. Good Intent was the name of a
farm, where dwelt heroine Priscilla, and was wooed of two
swains, David the Smith and the returned ne'er-do-well
squire, Reuben Gaunt. Eventually, after a fever epidemic
which tries the true metal of Gaunt (and the author's treat-
ment of this is by far the best thing in the book), Priscilla
marries him, amid prospects of the rosiest. At least we
are told so ; but as a matter of fact all the persons of the
tale are so palpably artificial that it is impossible to credit
them with any future existence whatever. They are the
autumnal rustics of Drury Lane rather than those of life;
- - it, and be as thankful as
we can. Its title is, perhaps, the worst thing about it, for
there is no suggestion that Priscilla in the story itself stands
for one of two alternative perils. The jingle of sounds—a
little arbitrary in any case—might have served if it had
called up any corresponding association of ideas; but it
doesn't, and so it is just a jingle.
Mr. BERNARD CAPES has returned to romance proper without
polemic interludes on style, and that is an excellent thing,
because I would not willingly have missed a page of The
Love Story of St. Bel (METHUEN). The scene is laid in
fourteenth-century Siena, and (except for the heroine and a
very unpleasant hunchback who impersonates his brother,
the perfect knight St. Bel, and may in fact be termed the
dragon) St. CATHERINE is the most prominent personage in
the book. Of course, when a writer introduces an historical
dea ex machiná (and the Saint occupies this rôle in settling
the feuds of the contado), there is likely to be a good deal of
creaking about the ropes; but Mr. CAPEs knows them so well
that it is hard to believe he was not there in person, disguised
as an arbalister or a Black Dominican. His characters talk
in an archaic manner which is admirably sustained from
start to finish without ever becoming tiresome, and that is
no small testimony to the author's skill.

THE HIGHER LANGUAGE TEST.
extended links at Pwllheli
R. Lloyd-George recently opened the
[M y ope “beneficent game” of golf
and remarked as among the merits of the
that it tested a man's temper and language.]
The truth had been already guessed.
It needed not a Cymric wizard
To find that golf affords a test
Of language latent in the chest,
Of temper in the gizzard.
Long ere Pwllheli leapt to fame
Through yonder Ministerial Taffy,
Ourselves had cursed our driver's aim,
Addressed our cleek in words of flame,
And brutalised our baffy.
Ourselves had foozled shots than which
Nothing on earth could well be softer ;
Had seen the humorous pellet pitch
In arid pot or watery ditch,
And smashed in twain our lofter.
We, too, around the hole had said
Things more adapted to the gutter;
Had for the time mislaid our head,
And turned the polished green one rel,
Blasting our blameless putter.
Full many a saintly man we know
Who, baffled by a hopeless stymie,
Being one down with two to go,
Permits himself to mutter, “Blow !”
Or even runs to “Blimey!”
Sometimes the faults of other men
Provoke the impious interjection;
It happens in a foursome when
You lay your partner dead—and then
He makes a resurrection.
But there's a game we're bound to play
That tends to language still more stormy:
Where there are thumping stakes to pay,
Pouched by a Bogey, so to say,
Who starts by being dormy.
All of us thirst to have his gore,
We yearn to raise the ruby blood-jet ;

He's solid rubber, rind to core.

Papa. Oh! I daresay you 're learning plenty of things,
but we want to make a man of you, you know. That's why
you're to go to school.
L. A. But shouldn't I grow up and be a man all right if I
remained at home, Papa?
Papa. You'd be a sort of man, I daresay, but not the sort
I want you to be. Boys must have the nonsense knocked
out of them some time or other, and there's no place like a
school for that.
L. A. I see, Papa. Then I suppose I've got a lot of
| nonsense about me?
Papa. Yes, any amount.
L. A. But how did I get it, Papa?
Papa. I'm sure I don't know.
L. A. Did Mademoiselle teach me nonsense?
Papa. Certainly not.
L. A. Did Mamma teach me any ?
Papa. Of course not. Don't be silly.
P L. 4. No, Papa, I won't. Then did you teach me nonsense,
apa
Papa. Now look here, Arthur, a joke's a joke—
L. A. Yes, Papa, I suppose it is; but I wasn't making a
joke that time. I don't make many jokes. I only thought if
it wasn't Mademoiselle or Mamma it must be you, because
nobody else has taught me anything at all.
Papa. I don't remember having taught you anything.
L. A. Oh, Papa, you did. I saw what you did, you know,
and I tried to do the same; and then there's reading books
and sermons and newspapers, and asking questions for
information, and
Papa. Well, that's just the kind of nonsense a big sehool
will knock out of you.
L. A. There you are, Papa. I learnt it from you, and
now you say it's nonsense, and yet you don't think you
taught me any nonsense. I'm sure I don't know
Papa. No, you don't. You don't know anything, and
that's why you're to go to school.
L. A. I sex, Papa. They'll teach me not to do all the
things Mamma and Mademoiselle and you have been teach-
ing me to do. Is that it, Papa?
Papa. No, it isn't. They'll—
L. A. But, Papa!
Papa. I'm doing the talking now.
L. A. Yes, Papa.
º: And I want you to understand that you're going to
school to get your character formed. You'll learn to play
games—cricket and football, and so on—and to make your
own way in the world—to take a knock, and give it, if
necessary, and to hold your head up like a man.
L. A. Then you want me to play games, Papa?
Papa. Of course I do. You know
L. A. Yes, I know, Papa; you said games had made
Englishmen what they were.
Papa. Yes, to be sure I did. Games are the backbone of
an English education. I don't want you to be like one of
these molly-coddling foreign boys.
L. A. Very well, Papa, l’ll learn games. And then, Papa,
you want me to learn to fight, too, don't you?
Papa. What put that into your head 2
L. A. Well, Papa, you said I was to take a knock and give
it, if necessary, and I can't do that without fighting, can I?
Papa. I didn't mean that you were to spend your life in
fighting; but you'll have to show a proper spirit, and if a
chap hits you you must hit him back.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I'll try to. But I saw two men fighting
in the village the other day, and the policeman came past and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WEEK-END IN THE COUNTRY.
“Why not come down,” (wrote
George), “and spend a week-end with
us? We're all alone. The country is
looking lovely just now, and it will do
you all the good in the world. Fresh
air and exercise are what you Londoners
want. There is a good train at 2.30.”
“The very thing,” I said to myself,
| and I wired, “Coming by the two-thirty.”
At two-thirty-four I wired again,
“Coming by the five-mine.” How it was
I missed the 5.9, I cannot explain, but
it was not until half-past ten that I
arrived at last.
“Not at all,” said George in reply to
my apologies. “Afraid you didn't see
much of the country coming up from
the station, though. Never mind ; you're
staying till Tuesday, aren't you? That's
good. Breakſast at ten.”
It was a glorious morning when I
woke for the first time at four. At six
and at eight it was still delightful, and
I congratulated myself on my escape
from London. . However, I only just
managed to get down to breakfast by ten.
George turned up twenty minutes later.
“Glorious day, isn't it?” he said.
“We must have a good walk. Hallo,
here's Muriel. You know my sister,
don't you ?”
“Good morning,” said Muriel. “Isn't
it a glorious day? Polly down yet,
George 2" -
“She's having breakfast upstairs.
She's going to church, though.”
“Yes, I'm going with her.”
“That's right. Now then, old man,
what would you like to do about
church 2 ”
“Well,” I said doubtfully, “of course
one can always go to church in London.”
“Just as you like, you know. The
carriage is going. And the ladies would
love to have you.” -
“Rather,” said Muriel. “Gracious,
we must fly.” -
I looked at the beautiful day again . . .
and helped myself to another cup.
“You’d better go without us,” said
George to Muriel. “We haven't finished
breakfast yet. Tell you what, though—
we're going a good walk, so we might
call for you, and all come back together
through the woods.”
“That's an idea,” I said heartily.
After breakfast we went into the
library. I began to fill a pipe.
“That's rather a jolly book,” said
George, picking one off the table. “You
might have a look at it some time.”
“I’ve heard about it,” I said, looking
at the title, “I know it's good;’ and I
began to dip into it.
“What a perfect day,” said George
at the window, yawning and stretching
himself; “I must just write a letter,
though.”
I turned back to the first page. . . .
It was really a very jolly book. . . .
“Hallo,” said George, “they're back
from church. We shall have to do our
walk this afternoon, old man. How's
the book 2 ”
“Heavens,” I cried, “it’s one o'clock.
I had no idea.”
“Well, come and have some lunch.
What a wonderful day! About this
afternoon—would you like to go up
through the woods, or shall we get down
to the sea 2" -
“Don’t mind a bit,” I said cheerfully,
and went in to lunch. . . .
“What do you generally do on a Sun-
day after lunch 7" said George, as we
lit our cigars.
“In London I generally go to sleep,”
I confessed.
“S) do I,” said Geºrge. “Try the
Soſa in the library, won't you? You'll
find it quite comfortable, and then you
won't be bothered by the ladies.”
We all met at tea in the drawing-
Itcoin.
“Tea outside is so unconfortable,
don't you think?” said Mrs. George.
“You’re three lumps, aren't you? Isn't
it a perfect day?”
“Perfect,” we all agreed.
*:: *:: *::
“I hope it will be fine to-morrow,”
said George, as he gave me my candle
that night. “You’ve hardly seen the
country yet. We might have the car
out—unless you'd rather walk?”
“Walking would be better for us, I
suppose?”
“By Jove, yes; you Londoners want
exercise. I'll tell you what. We'll
go out in the car and take lunch with
us, and then the ladies can drive back,
and you and I will walk. How's that?”
“Ripping,” I said.
Monday was another glorious day,
from four o'clock onwards. I was down
all right at ten, and so was George's
sister.
“What are you men thinking of doing
to-day ?” she asked, when I had got
going on the fish.
“George said something about all
oing out in the car.”
“That will be jolly.

“I haven't seen it yet,” I said.
hardly been outside the house.”
“George must take you round before
we start.”
When this was repeated to George
half-an-hour later he was enthusiastic.
“Come on,” he said, as soon as he had
finished his breakfast; and I followed
him out.
“This,” he said, as we stepped from
the library on to the lawn, “is where we
generally play croquet. A jolly game,
I always think.”
“Oh, rather.”
It's very pretty
“I’ve |Ge
“Do you play much? Well, then,
don't you agree with me that it's a mis-
take for the man who goes first not to
have a shot at the hoop 2" -
“It's rather risky,” I began, “be-
cause—”
“Well, now, I don't think so. I'd
back myself to do it any time. Look
here, we might just have a game and
then I'd show you what I mean. Would
you like to?”
“Rather; I'm always ready for
croquet.” . . .
“We must have another,” said George,
an hour and a-half later. “You didn't
get any of the luck.” . . . “And a con-
queror,” he added half an hour after-
wards. “The balls just went right for
you that time.”
“What a perfect day,” said Mrs.
George at lunch. “How's the croquet 2"
“We're just playing the conqueror,”
said George. “Jove, it's hot. I've
never known such a day.”
We finished the third game (which
George won), and came in for a drink.
“It's all eye,” said George. “Same
as at billiards. If you can smack 'em at
one you can smack 'em at the other.”
“Well, I can't smack 'em at billiards,"
I sighed.
“Nonsense! Really? I wonder what
I could give you? Do you care for a
game 2 Come on, then.”
Muriel came into the billiard-room
about four.
“Billiards—on a day like this ' " she
exclaimed.
“It's clouding over a bit now,” said
George, as he chalked his cue . . .
“That takes me out, I think.”
“Why don't you play a sociable game
for four?” said Muriel.
“Bridge?” said George. “Well, get
Polly then. And we'll have tea in here."
“Do you play Bridge much 2'' Muriel
asked me.
“I love it,” I said truthfully.
“So do I,” she said, and she went of
for Polly . . .
At about seven o'clock, “No trumps,"
said George. “Ah, I thought so,” he
added. “It’s begun to rain.”
We all looked out of the window.
“What a pity!” we all said.
“Spoilt your week-end rather,” said
Orge.
“Oh, no, I've had a perfectly ripping
time,” I protested.
“Still if it had kept fine You
know, in the country one does want **
“Must you go early to-morrow 2" said
Muriel.
“I'm afraid so.”
“Well, you must come again, that's
all,” said Mrs. George kindly.
“And come when it's fine,” said
George, “and get a little country air and
exercise. Do you all the good in th
world.” A. A. M.

AMONG THE ADWERTISEMENTS.
I. “Stop! STOP RIGHT where. YoU ARE
YoUR HAIR is FALLING OUT!”
It is the autumn of life. I have
stopped right where I am, and, lo! my
hair is falling out. It is useless to
replace it. Once, in the beginning of
things, I thought it might be done, and
when the first hair, leaving its follicle and
passing through the cutis vera and the
epidermis into the open air, lay before
me in all its silent tragedy, I was not
downcast. I took that hair to the works,
thoroughly overhauled it, polished and
sharpened it, parted it on the right side
and replaced it. In less than a week a
second hair lay on the shoulder of my
coat, making its mute appeal for liberty
or the grave. “It is the spring of life,”
I said, “and your work is still to do.”
I had it trimmed and relined throughout
and fresh buttons put on. But when I
sought to replace this one, it would not
be replaced. What mistake had I made?
Was it not, after all, the spring of life?
The mistake was not there. Whether it
came of romance or a careless barber, that
hair was not mine. It was an import.
But now, every time the wind blows,
my path is strewn with these sad tokens
of a zenith passed. I have tied the little
fellows up in bundles of five, and
Dorothy, Violet, Joyce and Miss Mallow
have each been supplied with a bundle.
But the remedy is temporary, and neither
Dorothy, Violet, Joyce nor Miss Mallow is
open to a second bundle. Reader, have
you any cushions that you would
have stuffed, for it is the autumn of
life?
I cannot prevent this falling-out, can
I? But why should I want to prevent
it? Do not I spend half-an-hour a day
getting hair off my face? Why should
I spend another half-an-hour a day
getting hair on the top of my head 2
Why should I have 8,683 (no, that was
yesterday; I should say 8,679) stalks
sitting idle on the top of my head, while
I carry them about all day for nothing?
Are they beautiful in shape 2 Only for
their perfect and unbending straight-
ness. Is red tinged with bluey-greyish-
brown a tint pleasing to the eye? I do
not want the stuff. I will stop no longer
right where I am. I will keep moving.
Let it all fall out.
No, thank you, gentlemen, I do not
want a bottle to-day.

It was the winter of life, and all his
hair had fallen out. He had tried
999 different kinds of cocoa, and each of
them was the best and none of the others
was pure. He had stopped right where
he was, and his hair had ceased falling

out. There was no more to fall. Neither
Dorothy, Violet, Joyce nor Miss Mallow
would disgorge their gratuitous bundles.
“Shall I be a miserable failure in
life?” he said. Then something caught
his eye. It was an advertisement.
“Thank you,” he said, “for your
prompt reply. I will not.” And he
went on and bought a wig.
III. “The DESIRE to POSSESS BEAUTY

His fountain pen had filled itself in a
flash, and was now sitting on his study
desk trying, trying with all its little
might to leak. All the fleas and beetles
were dead, and the growth of the book-
shelf was visible to the naked eye. The
strong healthy baby, determined to have
the best, had finished its thirteenth
bottle (all of different makes) of the
Only Food and was making the day
hideous with its shrieks for the other
six. Dorothy, Violet, Joyce and Miss
Mallow were not to be seen, but there
can be little doubt that they were stand-
ing before their several mirrors, growing
momentarily more beautiful in four
different varieties of corsets.
“I wonder how they will like my
wig’” he asked himself.

[JUNE 9, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ABSTEMIOUS ARISTOCRATS.
As a certain amount of scepticism has
been provoked by the remarkable dis-
closures made by Miss ELLA HEPWORTH
Dixon in her article on “The Craze for
Frugality” in last Wednesday's Daily
Mail, Mr. Punch has been at some pains
to verify her astonishing statements.
He regrets to state that the results of
these inquiries confirm her conclusions
at almost every point.
To begin with, The Daily Mail has
taken to using the word “parcimony,”
spelling it in the manner adopted by
The Times, and thus inducing its
readers to concentrate their attention on
the deleterious qualities which it con-
notes. This in itself is a straw which
shows which way the wind is blowing.
M. Rideveau, the chef of the Hotel
Tit-Bitz, interviewed in his sanctum
last Friday, corroborated Miss HEPWORTH
Dixon in almost every particular. Ac-
cording to his statement the number of
people who only eat four meals a day is
steadily increasing. Last week, Baron
Brauneberg, who was dining with Sir
Isidore Stoschenbüttel, pointedly de-
clined his favourite dish of Devonshire
cream, caviare and pâté de foie gras.
Lord Lushingham has become a teetotaler,
and Mr. and Mrs. Hugo Bulger enter-
tained a party to supper, after a recent
performance of Pelléas et Mélisande, on
cracknels and ginger ale.
Messrs. Murdoch and Menzies, the
well-known grain merchants, furnished
our representative with some truly
astonishing figures as to the increase
of the barley crop in the last year. The
output now amounts to more than a
billion bushels, and even so it fails to
keep pace with the ever-growing demand
for the favourite beverage of the day.
Indeed, Mr. Mungo Menzies declared
that the amount of barley-water drunk
by the members of the House of Lords
alone in the summer months would
fill the Serpentine and Round Pond
combined. - -
Mr. St. Loe STRACHEY, the author of
The New Way of Life, proposes to carry
out a series of free food tests on an
experimental Spectator company, with a
view to determining what is the irre-
ducible minimum of nutriment on which
the doctrine of Free Exchange can be
efficiently advocated.
The Editor of the Tailor's Goose affirms
that the cult of economy has invaded
the hitherto sacrosanct domain of high
sartorial art. Indeed, he has it on the
best authority that a well-known duke
was recently seen at Epsom in a suit of
ready-made grey flannels, and boasted
to his friends that he had purchased
them that morning for 27 s. 6d. at the
emporium of Messrs. Charity Bros., in
Cheapside.
The Editor of the Tittler publishes
an interview this week with Mr. Fulsome
Younger, who describes himself as a
converted gourmand, and is anxious
to form a Dining Club, the members of
which must pledge themselves never to
spend more than 25s. on their dinner,
exclusive of wines.
Mr. MoWTAGU Wood, whose superbly
eloquent article in the June National
Review on “The Disabilities of an
Oxford Career” has caused such con-
sternation in Academic circles, attributes
the decay of his Alma Mater to the
fatuous fashion of frugality which
threatens to submerge the peerless pearl
of cities beneath an avalanche of anaemic
abstinence. . As he expresses it in his
inimitable style, “it is this exorbitant
apotheosis of economy, this sinister fetish-
worship of semi-starvation that degrades
the somnolent sons of Oxford, supinely
stagnating beside the argent confluence
of Cherwell and Isis, to the abysmal
depths of disconsideration and dis-
repute.” Mr. Wood, however, nobly
refuses to despair of his University,
and holds that a course of Port and
Polysyllables, if vigorously persisted in,
will revive the robuster traditions of
the past and make the exuberant scions
of noble houses irresistibly pine to
punch all that is most sensitive in
the anatomy of bulky and belligerent
bargees.
THE RULING PASSION.
[According to a Hungarian critic, British
middle-class women “have a perfect itch for
indignation. Unless they feel shocked at least
ten times a day they are not happy.”]
THERE are who find their sole delight
In taking Mayfair flats;
There are who love to purchase quite
Unnecessary hats;
There are who rank the world a blank
Save church-parade on Sundays,
When they disclose expensive hose
And soul-enthralling undies.
But one there is with little mind
For pleasures such as these;
Joys of a far less costly kind
My virtuous Martha please. ,
The thrill that springs from hats and
things
She values not. What knocks her
Is when she hears with blushing ears
Some tale that fairly shocks her.
At breakfast Martha scans the Mail,
Where she is sure to find
Some dreadful, horrifying tale
That sears her model mind.
Aghast she reads the Smart Set's deeds,
Or some enquiring chappie -
Asks, “Is it true that women woo?”
And she is shocked and happy.
A deep and gratifying glow
Of virtue comes her way,
If she by any chance should go
To see a modern play; - -
She gloats with rage to think the stage
Should dare to draw attention
To endless strings of awful things
She'd rather die than mention.
And if the Vicar's wife should call
She serves some tasty scraps—
The curate's sad free-thinking fall,
The verger's latest lapse;
But greater still the scrumptious thrill
That G. B. S. affords them;
When he's discussed a perfect bust
Of righteous wrath rewards them.
| N C H A M BERS.
OUT of CHAMBERs.
It is not to be supposed that even the
busiest K.C. has no existence outside
court and his chambers. Observe, for
instance, a distinguished Silk leaving
the Strand and marching westwards as
early as four o'clock in the afternoon.
Let us follow him and leave chambers for
the Dentist's operating-room. Delighted
at , our own immunity, we observe the
Dentist standing ready to ply his forceps
with a happy smile and irresponsible
chatter. Sitting in the Throne of Pain
we see the K.C., stripped of the dignity
of his robes and reduced to subjection
by one aching tooth. The former is
urbane and politely prepared to do his
worst; the latter masterful in manner
but meek at heart. He for once shall
be the victim, shall even be the martyr
to a string of questions which he knows
he could answer once for all if only his
uestioner would let him. -
Silklike, the K.C. is not going to let
the other fellow in before he has had his
say. The contest must be an uneven
one, but there shall be a contest. Let
us sit silent amidst the escape of gas
and the whirr of grinding machines,
listening to the K.C.’s words and watch-
ing with attention the curious cere-
mony. -
“You are a registered dentist 2" says
the K.C.
“I am, indeed,” says the Dentist.
“Then let me explain to you how you
stand with regard to the law. Pro-
bably the first reference to the art of
dentistry in the Statute Book occurs in
32 Henry VIII., chapter 42, section 3,
where it is enacted that ‘. . . no manner
of person within the City of London . . .

“The result of that, I take it,” says
the Dentist, “is this: If I were shaving
you, I could pull out your teeth, but
could not cut your chin. It would be
a most entertaining experiment to pull
out a tooth with a razor.”

She (doing her best). “REA-A—A—A—lly. How straNGE You should All have MET.”
“Technically, this is not the City of
London,” says the K.C. hastily, “and
you have no jurisdiction. In 1878 was
passed the Dentists' Act, 41 & 42 Vic-
toria, chapter 33, the charter of the
profession. The following is a summary
of its provisions. . . .”
“When a man treats me with such
painstaking thoroughness, I feel bound
to do the same for him,” the Dentist
interrupts thoughtfully.
“Thanks,” says the K.C. suspiciously;
“I will be very brief with you. We
will pass on from that and come at once
to the most recent proposed legislation,
to wit that of Lord Hylton, in March
1907 (Bill No. 15), “. . . to prohibit
Joint Stock Companies from carrying
on practice as dentists or dental surgeons,
except by means of duly qualified per-
sons.” Personally, I could not bear
the thought of having a tooth pulled
out by a Joint Stock Company, but
Lord HYLTON doubtless felt differently.
I expect what happened was that
there were as many as twenty men at
work in his mouth at once, and in
the confusion one fellow got at him
with a pick who never ought to
have been allowed to leave his coal-
mine.
“So much then for the Statutes. Now
let us get to the cases. The leading case
is that of The Pharmaceutical Society v.
The London & Provincial Supply Asso-
ciation, Limited (1880, Appeal Cases,
857), but I never can understand from
the report which was trying to pull out
which's teeth, and why. There is also
ample authority for attaching severe
liability to the dentist who trespasses
off the one particular tooth under his care,
and for saying that every dog may have
at least one bite. Finally, there is the
case of Lee v. Griffin, reported in
1 B. & S., of which the facts are as
follows:– A. ordered off B. a set of
artificial teeth, which were by the con-
tract to be fitted to the mouth, but died
before they were so fitted. Held, that
there was a contract for the sale of goods
within the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. II.,
chapter 2, section 17.”
“I don't see where the fraud comes
in,” says the Dentist.
“It doesn't. I only quote that case
to show that the law has got its eye on
dentists. Bearing that in mind and
never forgetting that I have done some
very successful prosecuting in my earlier
days, you may now begin. As your ||
Lordship pleases : Gentleman of the
Forceps, the prisoner in the chair sits
charged with a tooth, inflicting grievous
bodily harm. It is for you to say whether
that tooth be guilty or not guilty.”
“It is a thoroughly bad tooth,” says
the Dentist.
“That I take to be a verdict of ‘Guilty.'
There have been numerous previous con-
victions, and light sentences of mere
stopping seem to have no effect upon it.
The maximum penalty allowed by the
law must be applied, and the sentence of
the Court is that you remove the tooth,
the whole tooth, and nothing but the
tooth.”
There are, of course, several well-
known recipes for “Barberry Preserve.”
Perhaps the best is that given by the
Bradford Daily Argus:
“One dozen cambric nightdresses, 1 dozen
powdered sugar, heat in pan gently, and boil
together for 10 or 15 minutes.”
Cambric is essential. A cotton night-
dress ruins it.

House of Commons, Thursday,
June 3rd.—House reassembled after
Whitsun holiday of Spartan brevity.
Only bench nearly full was that behind
front row in Diplomatic Gallery. Even
as SPEAKER took the Chair a thin black

along the bench. Every man carried in
his hand a copy of Orders of the Day.

No appeal against this. No need to

argument. The most inconsiderable
Member is master of situation. At his
nod a Bill, possibly involving costs of
hundreds of thousands of pounds in
business affairs of a populous com-
munity or a big commercial concern, is
blocked.
Mysterious strangers in Diplomatic
Gallery follow proceedings with almost
anguished interest. A sigh of relief
when stage of particular Bill is passed
is echoed by low groan of despair when
another is postponed. -

SNOWDEN plumped down as iſ

distant rooms and corridors the bells
clanged signal for a count. Slowly
Members trooped in. Would they
make up forty before the sand sped

As soon as he moved the count he
bolted behind the SPEAKER's Chair.

A DIGRESSION.
I was tired of pedestrianism and
the passing taxicab. “I will now,” I
said to myself, “be rich. To be pro-
perly rich I must be in a motor.”
The taxicab saw me and returned my
greeting. More than that, it stopped in
its wild career and returned to speak to
me. To have dislocated all the traffic
at Charing Cross for the best part
of a minute, that is the beginning of
riches.

“I don't follow you," said the man,

“Then I will follow you,” I said, pre-
paring to enter the cab.
“But tell me,” said he, “of what you
stand in need. I should like to help
you if I can.”
“I want to go to Regent's Park
Corner,” I said.
| “Why?” he asked.
“I have a multitude of reasons,
some abstract, one concrete. Re-
gent's is, I consider, a very pleasant
Park, and I am told that some one
expects us to luncheon in that
neighbourhood.”
“Us?” he cried, incredulous.
“No one ever expected me. I am
the Great Unexpected. Who would
ever have thought that I should be
earning one pound to thirty shillings

“Pardon,” I interrupted; “your
clock already points to 8d., and I
have only one shilling and sixpence
in the whole world. I am not sure
whether I have even that with me
at the moment. Never mind; let
that pass, for I have a bright idea.
Let us go to Regent's Park
Corner.”
“Yes,” said the policeman on
the pavement, interested in spite of
himself, “why don't you?”
“Because,” said the chauffeur,
idly fingering his lever, “Regent's
Park has not got a corner.”
“No matter,” said I, “I do not
insist upon the Regent's, though I
must have a Park and a corner. In
fact, when I said Regent's Park
Corner, I meant Hyde . . .”
“Ah!” said the chauffeur, mov-
ing off in another circle, “you should
always say what you mean.”
To have held up the traffic at
Charing Cross twice in the same
hour, that is plutocracy.
The head of SNOWDEN uprose again,
cleared of the cloud PECKHAM had wan-
tonly but ineffectually wrapt it in, and
debate went drearily on.

Fisherman. “I DoN'T suppose You see The PAPERS MUCH UP HERE, BUT You've PROBABLY HEARD AbouT THE KING winning THE DERby ?”
Boatman. “Oo Ay, I HEERD TELL, o' THAT. HE MAUN BE A GUID RIDER, HIM!”
A SHOW OF HANDS.
So far as the remote past is concerned,
my memory is excellent. I should like
to take a piece off behind, so to speak,
and patch it up in front, where the
machinery for registering future events
is weak. It has a stupid habit of re-
calling things just after the time for
action is passed.
Thus it allowed me to get four-fifths
of the way to Hampstead before remind-
ing me to bring a pair of gloves for the
dance. The local shops were, I knew,
all closed ; and if I returned home I
should be late, and Her programme
would be filled up.
Then I remembered with a sudden
exaltation of mood that my host was
learning wood-carving, and always kept
| his old gloves for finger-stalls.
I found him in the hall, but he could
not help me. All his old gloves,
together with his favourite coats and
| his dear old shooting boots, had been
spirited away to a jumble sale.
“Come without any gloves?” asked
Greene.
I don't like Greene, but there was a
ray of hope in his query. “Yes,” I
| replied eagerly.
“Pity,” said Greene.
“What can I do?” I demanded
fiercely.
Greene pondered. His face brightened
suddenly. So did mine. “There's
some tennis-court whitening in the
shed,” he said, “and if you only dance
with girls in white dresses it won't
matter if it does come off a bit.”
Then I caught sight of Her in pale
blue.
She was quite nice about the
gloves, and said that she had kept six
dances for me, but that she really
couldn't sit them out. The floor was
too lovely, and the band a simple dream.
I retired to a lonely corner for thought.
Even the solace of a cigarette was denied
me. She objected strongly to men
smoking at dances. As I might have
the pleasure of driving home with her
afterwards, I dared not disobey.
My host unearthed me before the third
dance was over. “Just the very man I
want,” he cried heartily, and dragged
me off resisting. . . .
She wasn't exactly a wall-flower. She
belonged rather to some species of Vir-
ginia-creeper—doomed to be everlast-
ingly fixed to the wall. I began to
scribble imaginary engagements all over
my programme at frantic speed.
“This poor fellow has come without
any gloves,” said my host. “His pro-
gramme is empty, and it would be an
act of real charity to sit out with him.”
She led me, helpless, to a secluded
nook and at once started out to bore me.
My thoughts were elsewhere, and my
answers were vague and irrelevant.
After three-quarters of an hour her voice
took on a chilling tone. I pulled myself
together and made a desperate effort to
be polite.
“I wonder if you are any relation to
General Scroggins?” I asked.
“My name is Groggins,” she replied.
“Come and have a drink,” I said
hastily. It didn't sound right, somehow,
though the intention was good. “I
mean, can't I get you some claret-cup or
something?”
“No, thank you.”
“Or some lemonade or anything of
that sort’”
“No, thank you ’’
“But I insist—you haven't had any-
thing to drink for over an hour.”
“No, thank you.”
“But I really must insist,” I said,
edging backwards till I reached the
stairs. Then I turned and fled back
to my previous hiding-place.
An hour later I was discovered by my
hostess. “Poor man,” she said, “all

alone? But you won't want gloves for
supper. Come with me. I've got some-
one for you to take down.”
My heart rose again. Perhaps She
was still free for supper.
“Thanks so much,” I replied. “I’ve
just been bored to death by my one and
only partner.” (This, of course, was
not a tactful thing to say to a hostess.)
She stopped suddenly and spoke to
someone round the corner.
“I’m so glad you're still here. I
want you to cheer up a poor man who
has been bored to death by his one and
only partner.”
She turned to me and stepped aside.
“Let me introduce you to Miss Grog-
gins.”
Appetite and indignation battled
fiercely for the mastery, and appetite won.
We sat at a table from which I had an
uninterrupted view of Her. Also an
equally good view of Greene.
I became reckless. I talked merrily
and unceasingly. My partner thawed
once when I spoke of BROWNING, and
froze again with a snap when I com-
pared his II unting of the Snark to
BYRON's Ancient Mariner.
I spent the rest of the night in strict
seclusion, except on one occasion when
my host's sister-in-law dragged me out
and introduced me to Miss Groggins.
At last the strains of the National
Anthem reached my eager ear. I
waited by the hall door till She came
down. Greene also waited.
She looked at us in laughing despair.
“There isn't room for you both !” she]
said.
“It is my turn,” I pleaded humbly.
She regarded us judicially for some
seconds. “Well, I can't decide without
being very rude to one of you—so I will
refer it to a higher court. My aunt
hasn't met either of you, and she shall
have the casting vote.”
Oh, yes, the aunt was Miss Groggins
right enough—and Greene secured the
seat by an overwhelming majority of
two to One.
I decided to walk home. The grey
hopeless dawn suited my mood. I
wanted a smoke, too, desperately. I felt
in my pockets. I repeated the process.
I had forgotten to bring my cigarette
case! I felt despairingly in the tail
pocket of my dress coat. I never use
this pocket—but perhaps, in a fit of
absent-mindedness, I had put it there!
I didn't find it. All I found was a pair
of unsoiled evening gloves which I had
worn the night before
Common Objects of the Countryside.
From a Parish Magazine:
“We have unfortunately not as yet been able
to obtain a Curate, though having taken every
possible step to secure that object.”
AT THE PLAY.
“A MERRY DEVIL.”
For his sixteenth-century “Florentine
Farce,” Mr. FAGAN seems to have drawn
ungrudgingly upon SHAKSPEARE's crea-
tions. Its full name should be “Much
Ado about the Taming of the Merry
Wife of Florence.” The fun begins
boisterously with the entrance of Mr.
CYRILMAUDE, disguised as a local Falstaff.
He is a swashbuckling suitor of Madonna
Geralda, the “Merry Devil” (Miss WINI-
FRED EMERY), and a plot is soon afoot to
serve him with figs and an iced drink
which shall cause him an excruciating

colic and lead him to imagine that he has
been poisoned. A second plot is then
devised against another suitor, Sir
Phillip Lilley, an Englishman, who
takes all things, including his love,
very seriously, and has not been long
enough in Florence to assimilate its
prevailing indifference to the practice of
poisoning. He has denounced as heart-
less the ridicule of Captain Bambazone's
stomach-ache, and he must be taught
better manners and an easier mor-
ality. My lady is to work upon
his passion and persuade him, against
his principles, to take a hand in the
secret burial of the poisoned Captain's
corpse, actually a dead hog dressed
up for the part. The vast amusement
enjoyed by the designer of these plots—
each of them rather homely in concep-
tion — was not dangerously infectious
beyond the footlights, and there was more
attraction for the audience in what one
must call the serious relief. Indeed, the
real interest began just before the curtain
of the Second Act, when the English-
man, angered to find that his loyalty
had been played with, gives his
spoiled lady a sound whipping (off).
After this the farcical element becomes
secondary, and we have to do with high
sentiment and the clash of strong natures.
The last Act contains a very pretty pas-
sage between Madonna Geralda and her
young singing page, Cherubino (Master
HAROLD EVERETT), whose sympathy for
his mistress's trouble leads him to
confess his love for her. The brave
earnestness of the boy, and the smiling
graciousness of the lady, careful not to
hurt his pride, gave to this little inter-
lude a particular charm.
Miss WINIFRED EMERY in the combined
parts of Portia, Beatrice, Katharine the
Shrew, and Mistress Page showed an
extraordinary versatility; and Mr. CYRIL
MAUDE as the Florentine Falstaff was
always pleasantly rotund in his buf-
foonery. Minor parts were picturesquely
played by Miss JEssie BATEMAN (whose
return is most welcome) and Mr. HoLMES-
GoRE.
The dresses and the beautiful scenely
were no doubt admirably Florentine and
of the period. The practical jokes, too,
may be said to have easily escaped the
snares of modernity; indeed, their almost
cosmic freedom from subtlety might have
commended them to Primeval Man.
WINIFRED EMERY's Madonna Geralda was
other than a spoiled, high-spirited and
rather disagreeable Englishwoman of no
particular era, or that Mr. AUBREY SMITH's

Mr. FAGAN's serio-comic extravaganza
in the archaistic vein is at least an
experiment that should be encouraged.

“Ah! just what I thought. You are
typical. You don't want books. And
how much less does a man who writes
books want with a library subscription!
Think of that. Very well, then, here
comes in my scheme. My scheme is to
relieve people of books. My collecting
vans don't bring books; they take them
away. You can subscribe for as many
or as few volumes as you like. For
half-a-guinea a year I will take away
one of your books twice a week. For a
guinea I will take one away every morn-
ing. For two guineas I will take three
away. And so on. It's perſectly simple.
When all the books you don't want have
gone you close the subscription. Every-
one has too many books, and no one any
longer reads anything but the papers.”
“Yes,” I said, “it’s ingenious, and I
daresay there's something in it. But
why not strike earlier? Why not use
your machinery to prevent publication
at all ?”
“Oh, no,” he said, “that wouldn't do.
People like to belong to things; they
like to subscribe. The van calling
would be a source of both pleasure and
pride to them.”
“And what will you do with the
books you collect?”
“Those? Oh, I shall sell them cheap
to the others.”
“What others?”
“The real readers.”

THE COW-CURE.
[A leading surgeon has informed The Daily
Mirror that when a man's “bad day” recurs—
which, it appears, is once every three or four
weeks—he should go into the country by
himself, and, if it is summer, lie in a field,
and meditate on nothing but cows.]
WHEN Chancellors would supertax your
brain
With Budget worries, take a local train
To some bucolic spot, unknit your brows,
And simply think of cows'
When ghostly scare-ships, scudding
through the night,
Have sent you up to bed half dead with
fright,
Arise next morn and in a meadow browse
And ruminate on cows.
So, when the scribbler's day of gloom
comes round
And ne'er a blessed topic can be found,
He'll write, as I do now until I drowse,
On cows and cows and cows!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks. )
MR. CHARLEs GARVICE's novels seem to belong to the kind
which I call massics, to distinguish them from classics. I
learn from publishers' notices at the end of Queen Kate
(HopDER AND STOUGHTON) that he is “an author who enjoys a
prodigious vogue on the other side of the Atlantic,” and I
accept that statement with respect, though throughout the
story I have tried hard to find out why he enjoys it.
rather, not why he enjoys it, for that is reasonable, but why
he has it. Prodigious vogues are sometimes very difficult to
account for. In Queen Kate there is a gambling baronet,
Or the most improbable things.
Mr. Robert HICHENS has decided not to repeat the mistake
of giving us more than we deserve for our money (68), as he
did in A Spirit in Prison. His new novel, Barbary Sheep, is
just a º shocker, for, which Messrs. METHUEN charge
3s.6d. It tells how a baronet's wife has a vulgar flirtation,
if nothing worse, with an Arab Spahi at El-Akbara, the Gate
of the Desert. Mr. HiCHENS is back in those favourite haunts
of which he understands so well how to reproduce the atmo-
sphere. To Lady Wyverme, however, they are novel, and the
atmosphere gets into her frivolous head and makes her do
A local madman, armed with a
murderous knife, is arbitrarily dragged in to save the situa-
tion, and a veil, equally arbitrary, is drawn over the strained
relations which are bound to follow between the lady and
an Italian villain, a dashing spendthrift young guards- her stolid British husband. Apart from the setting, it is
man, who succeeds to a dukedom, and a Russian prince, just an ordinary magazine story, in which Mr. HichENs seems
fabulously rich and unscrupulous, who will give up all for to have taken advantage of his reputation to impose upon us
the hand of the divine opera singer who has taken Europe something that is not quite worthy of his clever pen.

really the heroine in
disguise. Also there

—a bishop. Yes, I
feel sure I remember
a bishop. And a
forged will. ... Now
in England all these
things are good sell-
ing lines, but some-
how I don't seem to
see them getting a
“prodigious vogue.”
Mind you, I've only
read this one book
by Mr. GARVICE, and
perhaps the others
had some other
strong point, such
as stolen jewels or
something, which – - -
this lacks. Anyhow, I am greatly excited to see how it
takes.
When, on a spring morning in Paris, Ste. Marie and
Richard Hartley set forth on The Quest (WARD, LOCK), to
discover the vanished brother of the young woman with
whom they both suppose themselves to be in love, the
reader who has any previous acquaintance with the work of
Mr. JUSTUs Miles ForMAN will already congratulate himself.
Nor does what follows belie the promise of so good an
opening. The scene is furnished with just sufficient local
colour (in the way of restaurants especially) to recall delight-
ful memories. Further than this, there is a wicked uncle
“with a laugh like the mewing of a cat"; an excellent
mystery; a fight or two; and finally a dilapidated old house
in the suburbs, in the garden of which (how Mr. ForMAN
does love a horticultural setting !) the hero is kept a wounded
but enamoured prisoner for weeks on end. It is all quite
gloriously impossible, but the best fun in the world to read
about. I wish Mr. ForMAN had not chosen to call his most
frequently mentioned character Ste. Marie, a name which is
irritating to the insular eye; but, this small personal objec-
tion overcome, the story is one for which I have nothing but
a rather breathless admiration.
“THIS TOO, TOO SOLID FLESH.”
“The conspirators ARE AT HAND ! QUICK QUICK! My Lord. The secart STAIRCASE.”
a combination of bad
judgment and bad
luck. Granted that
she could not pre-
vent her infatuation
for Herr Stehmann,
the famous pianist, I
think that she was
imprudent to write
so freely to him;
nevertheless it was
hard (and extremely
inconvenient)that the
famous one should
die suddenly, and
leave so many effu-
sive letters in the
hands of his infam-
ousand blackmailing
wife. The blow to
Eugénie's pocket was
severe, but it was the
- buffet to her pride
which convinced her that she must be Tom Trevor's friend
instead of his wife. However, he disagreed with her on this
§. and so she ultimately carried off the Great Tom
takes, beating the more attractive Marjorie Willett, who
was my fancy. Miss SoPHIE Cole's book will appeal
chiefly to fluffy people, but if it restrains anyone from
writing indiscreetly to married celebrities it will have
justified itself.

In reading Mr. REGINALD TURNER's book, Samson Unshorn
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), I was reminded irresistibly of the Duke
of Plaza Toro, who led his regiment from behind. The story
tells of one of the kings of the popular press—the Napolea
of Journalism, as the subalterns of their reporting army
might call them. He is so terribly swift in his achievements
that panting Time toils after him in vain, and Mr. TURNER
comes in a poor third, some way behind Time. Maxwell, the
Napoleon, does something, starts a new paper, perhaps, or
proposes, or breaks it off, and while Mr. TURNER is explaining
at length how he felt while he was doing it he is off after fresh
laurels—booming conscription, or refusing a peerage, or what
not. All this would be more entertaining if one could only be
there while he is at it; but one must of necessity stay with
the author.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
CHARIVARIA.
It is now rumoured that there is more
than meets the eye in the forthcoming
naval display in the Thames, when there
is to be a line of war vessels stretching
from the Nore to the Houses of Parlia-
ment. The actual object of this show
of force is, it is said, to intimidate the
Suffragettes, who have been threatening
a renewed attack on the House of Com-
mons from the river.

Our new cruiser, H.M.S. Defence, ran
ashore the other day, and was none the
worse for a short stay there. It is
satisfactory to know that she is not
merely seaworthy.

When Mr. Lloyd-GEORGE visited Cardiff
he spent some time at the Pageant House
inspecting the costumes, “in which,”
The Daily Chronicle informs us, “he
displayed all the intelligent interest of a
PAQUIN or a Worth.” Note how con-
siderate the Radical Press is to Mr.
Asquith's colleague. There is no men-
tion of a Poirºt.
*.*
Meanwhile Mr. Lloyd-GEORGE's influ-
ence in Wales, at any rate, seems to
increase rather than to diminish. No
sooner, we read, was Cyfarthfa Castle
thrown open to the public, the other
day, than plants and shrubs were up-
rooted, brass taps wrenched off, the
rooms ransacked, and even lead removed
from the roof. Taffy takes kindly to
the hen-roost notion.

It speaks well for the careful arrange-
ments at the Horse Show that, although
there were 1,500 baby ramblers there,
not one of them was injured.

At a rummage sale in connection with
a Yarmouth Church Mission the silk hat
of one of the workers was inadvertently
sold for a penny. The owner's annoy-
ance may be imagined, for the article, we
understand, was worth more than double
what was given for it.

Our attention has been drawn to the
advertisement of a Temperance Hotel at
Shrewsbury, which states boldly :-
“Ponteſt REPT on the PREMises.”
After this, it seems perhaps unkind to
mention that the House in question is
called “The Welcome Temperance Hotel.”

Contrary to announcements the Church
Pageant opened with a realistic repre-

In his speech at the Press Conference
Lord MoRLEY stated that many persons

as a profession with no more justification
than his friend Mr. BIRRELL would have
if he took to the painting of pictures.

BiRRELL's politics.

This is an example of what perseverance
can do. Indeed, it has led to an even
greater success. In The Evening News
we read :—
“Crawford's dismissal of Benham afforded a
fine example of what is known as poetic
justice. It happened thus: Benham in playing
forward did not meet the ball properly, and it
sped a few inches above the ground to Marshal,
who could not quite hold it with one hand.
With the very ball, however, the Surrey captain
clean bowled Benham.”
This, at least, shows that Mr. CRAwford
does not call for a new ball every time
he has a catch missed off his bowling.

“WORDS, WORDS, WORDS.”
[Being the reflecticns of a pessimist on the unanimity shown by orr
leading statesmen in speeches delivered on the subject of National
Defence before the Imperial Press Conference.]
“Ah God, fºr a man with heart, hºad, hand,
Like some of the simple great ones gone
For ever and ever by,
One still strong man in a blatant land,
Whatever they call him, what care I,
Aristocrat, democrat, autocrat–one
Who can rule . . Tennyson.
YEs, we “endorse” each other right enough ; .
“Hear, hear!” we cry, “’twas excellently said;"
Our hearts, no doubt, are of the proper stuff,
And here and there a head—
But, when we look to feel the guiding hand
Laid to the promised task betimes and now,
Like patient oxen in the tilths we stand,
With none to steer the plough.
Oh, you have heard us, you from oversea,
Have heard our statesmen, every brand and hue,
Talk with a wondrous unanimity
Of what we ought to do;
But think you we shall do it? Ah, good Sirs,
The thought is prompted by a guestly tact,
Or vou are misinformed of what occurs
- In the domain of fact.
Not that we shirk the sacrifice to pay;
Nor that our ancient pride of race is lost;
Put that our chosen leaders make delay,
Stopping to count the cost.
A decade since, in that disastrous year
We put our finger on the cankered spot,
Saying, “We’ll have the surgeon's lancet here!”
And left it—clean forgot.
That is our way, down which we ever drift;
Hopeful that with the Hour will come the Man,
We wait the call to action, stern and swift,
To clinch the pondered plan;
And still we need a ruler who can rule,
An arm to smite the iron while it glows,
And we are left to let our ſervour cool,
And the good moment goes.
Honest we grant them : we're an honest breed ;
But where's the courage bold to say, “You must 1
There lies your duty; follow where I lead;
Else I resign my trust' "
O you who never in your younger lands
Have “let “I dare not” wait upon ‘I would,’”
But, when your heart's work lies before your hands,
Take it and make it good;
Go back and shame us into living deeds,
For here at home, in speechcs deftly spun,
We talk and talk and talk of England's needs,
And nothing's ever done !
Poor “weary Titan’’ (that's the term they use)—
Weary I can't think why, unless for lack
Of exercise to keep her splendid thews
From growing soft and slack–
'Tis to her sons our candour makes appeal
(Trusting the family to bear the truth)
That you should give her tonics stiff with steel,
And so renew her youth;
Yet not assume the cynic's captious mood,
For such irreverence would become you ill,
Since, at her worst and weariest, you're her brood,
And she's a Titan still. O. S.
IN THE GRIP OF AN ARTIST.
SCENE–The interior of an “artistic hairdressing establish-
ment for ladies” in a not unfashionable quarter of
London. All the compartments, except one, are occupied
by victims in various stages of torture. There is a buzz
of conversation, mostly carried on by the erecutioners.
A lady advances timidly towards the empty compartment.
She is pounced upon by the artist (a French gentleman)
to whom it belongs, takes her seat in the chair, and is
swathed for the operation.
The Artist. Now, Madame, vat is it you desire?
The Lady. Well, I thought I should like to have my hair
done. You see——
The Artist (undoing her hair). Oh, yes, I see. I am not
blind in bose eyes. You are from ze contry. It is difficult
to attend to ze hair in ze contry. I am to give an artistic
effect, hein 2
The Lady. Something of that kind. I thought you might
do it in puffs.
The Artist (amarily). In poſs! I am to do ze hair in poſs!
It is not a word I understand. You mean I am to do it in
r-r-rolls?
The Lady. Well, yes, if you like rolls better I'll have it
in rolls.
The Artist. It is not vat I like better. The question I
most pose to myself is zis: Will Madame's hair go into
r-r-rolls, and in addition, Can I make an effect vis r-r-rolls 2
The Lady (meekly). Exactly. I should be much obliged if
you'd try.
The Artist. And I am expect to make r-r-rolls viz zis
(holding out streamers of hair contemptuously). Wen ze hair
is six inch long I can make r-r-rolls, or if Madame please I
call zem poffs—but zis hair is a yard. I cannot respect
myself if I make him into poffs. Ze head will lo k l ke a

gard or so to contemplate the result). Mon Dieu, vat will you ?
I have done him tant bien que mal, but I cannot make him

THE PAGAN SPLURGE.
THE spirit of the new Hellenic revival, which in this
country has been chiefly confined to Marathon races and
music-halls, has, as might have been expected, begun to
spread like wild-fire in the more imaginative º of
the U.S.A. A young Sicilian shepherd and piper was lately,
so we read, imported for the purposes of a “Greek pageant
and Bacchanalia". organised by the leaders of New York
Society : but this is as nothing compared with the rumours
that are hourly floating like the strains of Pan across the
herring-pond.
An immense celebration, for instance, of the Waldorphic
myst, ries is being prepared by the “Four Hundred” for
|June, the anniversary month of the foundation of their
order (in 411 B.C.) by Antiphon at Athens, and at this festival
a modern version of the Adonis Chant will be sung by
white-robed maidens in procession at Newport, with special
reference to the temporary sojourn of ex-President RooseVELT
in Africa.
Meanwhile, Mr. J. D. RocKEFELLER is thinking of towing
over the island of Delos just as it swims, and mooring it
by a golden chain to Rhode Island, where, by the way,
a colossal statue of Big BiLL TAFT is to be erected : this
accomplished, the President of the Standard Oil Companies,
as lineal descendant of the God of Light, will deliver oracles
to the Press from the ancient haunt of Apollo.
At Chicago, again, Mr. J. D. PATTEN is about to build
a temple to Demeter, the bountiful earth-mc ther, in
commemoration of his successful scoop in the wheat-market:
while Mr. G. O. ARMOUR, the beef-king, has become an
ardent student of the Iliad, and is never tired of repeating
the line,
Xpúaea XaAketov čkaroušot' evveałotov,
which he translates as an inspired prophecy of the pecuniary
advantages of wholesale canning.
All over the States millionaires are contracting for white
marble mausoleums of Ionic or Doric description to hold
their remains, and the saying that “good Americans when
they die go to Paros,” will soon be truer than ever. As
further indications of the new movement, it may be remarked
that Chian wine (known as Chianti) is everywhere replacing
Cocktails, and that the inhabitants of Pittsburg are said
to be desirous of re-naming their city Tartaropolis.

THE RABBITS.
CHAPTER I.
Introducing the Lop-eared Ones and
Others.
“By Hobbs,” cried Archie, as he
began to put away the porridge, “I feel
as fit as anything this morning. I'm
absolutely safe for a century.”
“You shouldn't boast with your mouth
full,” said Myra.
“It wasn't quite full,” pleaded
Archie, “and I really am good for runs
to-day.”
“You will make,” I said, “exactly
fourteen.”
“Hallo, good morning. Didn't see
you were there.”
“I have been here all the time.
Fourteen.”
“It seems a lot,” said Myra, doubt-
fully.
Archie laughed in scorn.
“The incoming batsman,” I began,
“who seemed in no way daunted by the
position of affairs——”
“Five hundred for nine,” put in Myra.
4. reached double figures for the
fourth time this season, with a lofty
snick to the boundary. Then turning
his attention to the slow bowler he des-
patched him between his pads and the
wicket for a couple. This, however, was
his last scoring stroke, as in the same
over he played forward to a long hop
and fell a victim to the vigilance of the
wicket-keeper.”
“For nearly a quarter of an hour,”
continued Myra, “he had defied the
attack, and the character of his batting
may be easily judged from the fact that
his score included one five --— ”
“Four from an overthrow,” I added in
parenthesis.
“And one four. Save for a chance to
mid-on before he had scored, and another
in the slips when seven, his innings was
almost entirely free from blemish * x
“Although on one occasion he had
the good fortune, when playing back to
a yorker, to strike the wicket without
dislodging the bails.”
“See to-morrow's Sportsman,” con-
cluded Myra.
“Oh, you children,” laughed Archie,
as he walked over to inspect the ham.
“Bless you.”
Miss Fortescue gave a little cough
and began to speak. Miss Fortescue is
one of those thoroughly good girls who
take an interest in everything. A
genuine trier. On this occasion she
said:
“I often wonder who it is who writes
those accounts in The Sportsman.”
“It is believed to be Mr. Simpson,”
said Archie.
Simpson looked up with a start and
jerked his glasses into his tea. He
fished them out and wiped them thought-
fully. “The credible,” he began, “is
rarely—— ”
“Gentlemen, I pray you silence for
Mr. Simpson's epigram,” cried Archie.
“Oh, I always thought Mr. Simpson
wrote verses in The Saturday Review,”
said Miss Fortescue in the silence which
followed.
“As a relaxation only,” I explained.
“The other is his life-work. We read
him with great interest; that bit about
the heavy roller being requisitioned is
my favourite line.”
“Mr. Simpson and KILLICK and
CRAWFORD all play in glasses,” put in
Myra eagerly, across the table.
“That is their only point in common,”
added Archie.
“Oh isn't he a very good player?”
“Well, he's a thoroughly honest and
punctual and sober player,” I said,
“but—the fact is, he and I and the
Major don't make many runs nowadays.
We generally give, as he has said in
one of his less popular poems, a local
habitation to the Ler—airy nothing.”
“I thought it was SHAKSPEARE said
that.”
“SHAKSPEARE or Simpson.
here's Thomas at last.”
Thomas is in the Admiralty, which is
why he is always late. It is a great
pity that he was christened Thomas; he
can never rise to the top of his profes-
sion with a name like that. You couldn't
imagine a Thomas McKenna—or even a
Thomas Nelson. I want him to get it
altered by letters patent, but I hardly
like to suggest it; letters of any kind
are a dangerous subject with him just
now.
“Morning everybody,” said Thomas.
“Isn't it a beastly day ?”
“We’ll hoist the south come for you,”
said Archie, and he balanced a mush-
room upside down on the end of his
fork.
“What's the matter with the day?”
asked our host, the Major, still intent on
his paper.
“It's so early.”
“When I was a boy——”
“My father, Major Mannering,” said
Archie, “will now relate an anecdote of
Waterloo.”
But the Major was deep in his paper.
Suddenly he—there is only one word
for it—snorted.
“The Budget,” said Myra and Archie,
exchanging anxious glances.
“Ha, that’s good,” he said, “that's
very good ‘If the Chancellor of the
Exchequer imagines that he can make
his iniquitous Budget more acceptable
to a disgusted public by treating it in a
spirit of airy persiflage he is at liberty
to try. Butairy persiflage, when brought
into contact with the determined temper
of a nation——’”
Hallo,
“Who is the hairy Percy, anyhow 2"
said Thomas to himself.
The Major glared at the interrupter
for a moment. Then—for he knows his
weakness and is particularly fond of
Thomas—he threw his paper down and
laughed. “Well,” he said, “are we
going to win to-day?” And while he
and Archie talked about the wicket his
daughter removed The Times to a safe
distance.
“But there aren't eleven of you here,”
said Miss Fortescue to me, “and if you
and Mr. Simpson and Major Mannering
aren't very good you'll be beaten. It's
against the village the first two days,
isn't it?”

WRITING A COMEDY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
WHEN Sibbering told us at the Club that he was about to
retire to a remote village in Sussex in order to write a comedy,
we were all a little incredulous. We had not been aware
that he wrote at all, and, somehow, a comedy was about the
last thing we should ever have expected from him. So that,
when I happened, shortly afterwards, to be staying myself
within a few miles from Tidhurst, the village in question, I
could not resist going over to look up Sibbering, and find
out if he really was working at a comedy, and, if so, how he
was getting on with it.
I discovered him at last in his retreat—a charming cottage,
well away from the village and main road, and surrounded
by woods and sloping meadows. There was no doubt about
the comedy, for he was actually engaged upon it as I entered
Comedy, by Robert Sibbering,' than the brute began: ‘The
eedjit' the eedjit! Cheek of him to try and write a Come-
dee' or words to that effect. And another bird—a
thrush he was—asked, “Will he do it? Will he do it?’
On which the blackbird said, ‘No fear, he 'll chuck it—he'll
chuck it !” and then gave a nasty kind of whistle.
“Aſter that, of course, I became the joke of all the birds in
the neighbourhood | They come and shout out : ‘Stick to it!
Stick to it!” or, ‘He'll do it! he'll do it!” but mostly they
advise me to “leave it—leave it!' If you listen, you'll hear
'em at it mow !” . . .
I did listen, and I am bound to admit that the cries I heard
were capable of his interpretation—but, as I told Sibbering,
I felt sure the birds did not intend to be rude—it was only
manner. “Not intend to be rude!” cried Sibbering, “when
a confounded thrush has just this very instant addressed
his sitting-room, a remarkably pleasant
and cheerful one, with a large bay- |
window at one side, looking out upon
a sunny orchard, and, on the other, a
latticed casement, the light of which was
shaded by a big yew and some Scotch
firs that overhung the front garden.
He seemed nervous and worried, but
not displeased to see me. “No, my dear
fellow,” he said, “ you're not interrupt-
ing me at all. Fact is, I'm rather at
a stand-still for the moment. Though I
did think I was just in the right mood for
a comedy in my present state of fearful
depression '''
must have looked puzzled, for he
explained : “Surely you know that all
genuine humourists are dismal melan-
choly chaps in private life? You must
have heard that old yarn of the hypo-
chondriacal patient going anonymously
to consult a doctor. “My advice to you,'
said the doctor, ‘is to go to the Jollity and
see that new farcical comedy of Grinling
Gassiter's. Iſ that don't cheer you up,
nothing will.' All the other fellow said
was: ‘I am Grinling Gassiter.' And I
suppose he didn't go to the Jollity. Well,
don't you see? Any one whose spirits are
as low as mine are ought to turn out no
end of a brilliant comedy. Only I shall
never get a chance of doing it here !”
I said I should have thought the
“SL VIEILLESSE POUVAIT.”
me as ‘Gr-reedy Bob'? You can't see
him, because he always dodges behind
a branch of that apple-tree over there—
but you must have heard him '''
I couldn't deny it, but once more I
assured Sibbering that I did not think
the remark had any personal reference.
“I know better!” he declared with
some heat; “he comes and charges
me with gluttony whenever I’m at
meals, and I'll swear the fat beast
eats a lot more than ever I do' Per-
haps,” he added, in tones of withering
irony, “you'll tell me next that bird
in the yew meant to be compli-
mentary 2 Do you know what he
called me? . A ‘Chee-chee-chee-chippy-
chippy-chirriwit!’”
At this, a thrush, as if from sheer
desire to make more mischief, struck in
with : “So he did—so he did l’”
I advised Sibbering to take no notice.
“After all,” I said, “it didn't sound as
if it was meant to be offensive.” “I don't
pretend to know its exact meaning,” said
Sibbering very solemnly, “but this much
I do know-it's an epithet that no decent
bird would sully his bill with. And for
two pins I'd take that bird's name and
address. No, of course I know that
would be no use. But what right has he
to reflect on my credit?”
It was probably the merest coincidence,
place an ideal one for any literary
work, if only for its absolute quiet. “Quiet 2' he said,
“quiet! With all these beastly birds about! Ah, I
see—you think they're innocent chirruping little beggars,
with no ideas beyond minding their own business. So did
I—once. When I came down here first, I supposed they
were merely talking to one another about their private
affairs. As soon as my ear got more accustomed to their
intonation, I found that the malicious little devils were
spending their whole time in talking at Me! It's no use
saying ‘Nonsense!’ like that. I tell you it's a fact.
They’re all in a conspiracy to put me off my comedy. For
anything they can tell it might be the means of rescuing our
National Drama from its present deplorable condition—but
what's that to them 2 They're trying their hardest to nip it
in the bud. There, did you hear that blackbird call out,
‘We’re doing it—we're doing it, we're doing it!’ Yºu see
—he actually glories in his work! He's the worst of the lot,
that blackbird. He started this infernal persecution the
very first morning I commenced work! No sooner had I
written: ‘The Tergiversations of Lady Tryphena, an Original
but just then a blackbird (if it wasn't
a thrush) cut in with, “Credit—credit. Get a verdict ' Get
a ver-dict l’’
“He’s taunting me now !” he cried, “taunting me be-
cause he knows as well as I do that I've no legal remedy
That's the same bird that took upon himself, only yesterday,
to suggest a perfectly preposterous opening line for my first
scene. Lord Percival Flarge comes on alone, do you see?
and I was trying to hit on a really smart speech for him—
something, don't you know, that would put the audience in a
good temper at once. I’d almost got it, when that con-
founded blackbird chipped in with, “How 'd it do? I've
been and gobbled a worrum, and my worrud, he was such a
wriggley one !” Now, I ask you, could he really have sup-
posed that that was a likely observation for any English
nobleman to make? Of course he knew better! It was
simply dashed impertinence' Still, I've thought of the
right thing at last, in spite of him. How does this strike
you? ‘Act I., Scene 1. The Morning Room at Toppingham
Towers. Enter Lord Percival Flarge Lord Percival (to
himself): “And so Lady Lopyeir '' (I'm making this a

really high-class comedy—all the characters have titles
except the domestics—I’m told the Dress Circles prefer
it)—“so Lady Lopyeir is not at home. H'm, she can't be
such a rery mysterious personage, after all, when this is the
sccond time I're found her out !”.' Spoken with the right
emphasis—the right emphasis, you know, I think that
ought to get a laugh, eh?”
Before I could reply I was anticipated by a long plaintive
cry from a bird in the front garden. “There's another
of 'em!” cried Sibbering. “Upon my soul, this sort of thing
is s'mply intolerable !”
“Now come, my dear fellow,” I protested, “it merely said:
‘A little bit o' bread and no chee-ese !’ All yellowhammers
do, you know !” Sibbering looked at me suspiciously:
“Other yellowhammers may sºy that,” he replied; “what
that yellowhammer said was: ‘A little wit—and such an old
whee-eze!’ A distinct allusion to my joke' "
Assuming this to be the case, I was privately of the yellow-
hammer's opinion, but of course I took care not to say so.
“How am I ever to make any progress,” demanded Sibbering,
“if I'm to be constantly subjected to these carping criti-
cisms? I must and will put a stop to it! I wonder if I
found the village constable and askel him to caution the
birds— You think I'd better not, eh? Well, perhaps you're
right, dear old chap, perhaps you're right. But you've
seen for yourself what I've got to put up with, and, if I
should have to give up all idea of finishing my comedy,
I wish you’d explain to the other fellows why I found it
impossible.”
I never
heard any more of “The Tergirersations of Lady
Tryphena,” so I conclude that Sibbering must have found
the birds too many for him. At the same time I cannot help
thinking that he was just a trifle over-sensitive. F. A.
An Eisteddfoddity.
The inrush of the Welsh to London this week is terrific.
Prudent voyagers from the Principality itself started some
days in advance, knowing how any pressure of traffic renders
the Welsh railways somewhat slow and uncertain. At the
moment of going to press, our special representative wires:–
“I have just interviewed one of the leading Bards, named
Wilkie. He personally opened the door to me. ‘Wellllcwm ' '
he said genially. “Mynddywr hatt dwsntt tweh the llamp."
I asked him what he thought of London. It appeared that he
knew the place well; still, he agreed that it was ‘wwnddrffwll,'
to quote his own picturesque word. He expressed great
surprise that he hadn't been invited to take part in the
Eisteddfod this year; he would have been only too willing,
he said, to sing to them, and to make them sing.”

It is not often that a player, while in the act of defending
his own wicket, secures several of the other side's, taking
fourteen altogether in one innings. Yet this, according to
The Daily Chronicle (special type), is what Robson did against
the Australians:–
“Going in at 32, and taking a brief rest after capturing his sixth
wicket, Robsºn sent down nineteen overs and a ball for 35 runs and
eight wickets.”

MUSICAL NOTES.
The success achieved by the gifted
Hungarian singer, Mlle. Jelly von
Aranyi, has already had a remarkable
effect on the nomenclature of our leading
singers. Mr. PLUNKET GREENE has given
notice that he will henceforth be known
as Mr. Junket Greene, and by no other
name. Madame MELBA has almost com-
pleted the legal formalities necessary to
her assuming the forename of Pêche.
Mr. KENNERLEY RUMFORD will in future
sing under the succulent title of Mr.
Baba au Rumford. • Madame KIRKBY
LUNN has adopted the name of Sally,
and Mr. HENRY BIRD, by a deed poll duly
signed and witnessed, has assured all
and sundry whom it may concern t” at
his name in future will be Buszard.
Lastly, Mrs. HENRY Wood has intimated
that her vocal engagements will hence-
forth be fulfilled under the attractive
alias of Charlotte Russe.
M. Emile Cartouche, the renowned
French baritone, besides being a great
singer, is a famous archaeologist, and
always makes a point of studying the
period of every opera in which he sings.
Thus having been cast for the part of
Amonasro in Aida he at once proceeded
to Egypt, lived on mummy wheat for
three weeks, and camped out at the foot
of the Sphinx, ascending at least one of
the Pyramids every day in order to
impart the requisite local colour to his
vocal chords, which, it is hardly neces-
sary to say, are of phenomenal length
and power.
Madame Gemma d'Antichità, the Cala-
brian diva who will shortly make her
début at Covent Garden as the principal
witch in the revival of CIMAROSA's Mac-
beth, has, since the death of Signora
Messalina Skrimshanks, enjoyed the
privilege of being the only living pupil
of the renowned Porpora. Although
the famous coloratura singer has been
twenty decades before the public, her
répertoire includes several of the most
up-to-date operas. Mr. RIDER HAGGARD,
who recently heard her sing, observed
that, with the exception of She, Mme.
Gemma d' Antichità was the most
sprightly bicentenarian he had ever
Conne across.
The performance of the new opera,
the name of which has escaped us, at
Covent Garden last Saturday was a pro-
digious success. The stalls presented
their usual bright and animated appear-
ance, tiaras were riſe, and every seat
was occupied. Among those present
were the Patagonian Minister, the Chev-
alier Pongo di Mangostine, Mariana
Countess of Bonanza and the Hon. Dorcas
Boodle, the Earl and Countess of Dolly-
mount, Sir Langdale Pike, Sir Ernest
Berncasteler, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Braune-
berg, the Cavaliere Barolo, Baron Ingel-
heim and Sir Isidore Zeltinger.
It is stated in a circular issued by
his agent that Pepito Arriola, the
modern MozART, “in addition to his
extraordinary musical talent, has shown
a constant thirst for knowledge of every
kind, and, although he has only been a
few weeks in London, is not only learn-
ing English rapidly, but has a thorough
grasp of the intricate railway system, by
which he is fascinated, and of which he
has made a special study.” We learn
from another source that Sir GEORGEGIBB,
who recently attended one of Pepito
Arriola's recitals, was so electrified by
his playing that he at once offered the
Wunderkind a seat on his Board and a
permanent free pass from Mansion House
to The Monument. Meantime we learn
that M. PADEREWSKI is engaged on a new
opera, the libretto of which is entirely
composed of the names of the Welsh
Railway-stations in Bradshaw.
Nerves.
“He started badly, slicing his tee shot to the
first hole, and had to tike a niblick to recover.
The result was a 5 at the second hole.”---

Apparently his recovery was not
immediate. Another time he should
take a stronger pick-me-up.

of the comparative inclemency of our

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 7.
–Only the other day Strangers' Galleries
re-opened ; pity if it should prove neces-
sary to close them again. Serious risk
has been run. SIMON, K.C., innocently
responsible. Varied dull debate on
Finance Bill by one of his bright, clear,
never too lengthy speeches. Held a
brief for the grocer, weighed down with
apprehension of burdensome rates for
spirit licences.
“Whatever may be said on the sub-
ject from the temperance point of view,”
insisted the learned gentleman, “it does
not seem fair that the grocer should pay
an amount equal to half the annual
valuation of his premises.”
Enunciation of this noble sentiment
went straight home to heart of a grocer
in the gallery.
“Right !” he said, aud loudly clapped
his hands. -
Messengers in attendance rushed up
and remonstrated. Grocer's spirit sank
within him. What was the use of Lord
RosebERY making speeches at Shep-
herd's Bush, extolling the greatness of
an Empire buttressed about by loyal
colonies, if, seated in the very home of
liberty, a downtrodden grocer, momen-
tarily elate at the enunciation of a great
principle, was not permitted to clap his
hands for joy, as do (or did, in the
days of the Psalmist) all the trees
of the field 2 Happily the matter was
not carried further, authority being

satisfied with a reprinand and a warn-
ing not to do it any more.
So the grocer remained in the Gallery,
and presently heard a touching story
told by Mr. YoUNGER bearing upon the
great whisky question. Two monkeys
were generously entertained by a scien-
tist, each being provided with a noggin
of Scotch. One sample newly distilled,
the other well matured. Result remark-
able and instructive. The gentleman
who tossed down the new whisky grew
fractious, uttering strange cries and
showing strong desire to fight his host.
The other became as mellow as the
whisky he was permitted to sample.
As Mr. YoUNGER, with contagious en-
thusiasm, put it, “He became delight-
fully and pleasantly drunk, making
friends with everybody around.” So
that there should be no mistake about
it, the monkeys were subsequently enter-
tained at another stance. The distribu-
tion of whisky, young and old, was
reversed, with precisely the same con-
sequence.
It looks as if we shan't be crowded !
I think I shall take myself in to have another ice . "
The grocer in the gallery was dis-
posed to regard it as rather a waste of
liquor, but conceded that in the public
interest the experiment was worth the
cost.
It is understood that, having served the
desired purpose, the monkeys were, not
without some trouble, induced to sign
the pledge.

This afternoon HAROLD Cox steps
down to verge of stagnant pool and
stirs it with thrusting point of argument
illumined by flashes of humour. The
young Member for Preston is the most
precious product of the still new Parlia-
ment. His position, won in compara-
tively brief time, is honourable equally
to the House and himself. It dis-
closes afresh the supreme quality which
preserves vitality of what Press dele-
gates from over seas strikingly allude
to as the Mother of Parliaments. The
House cares not a rap whether a
Member seeking its favour is duke's scn
or cook's son. True it has a lingering
preference for the former. But if the
latter be the better man he will win the
prize for which countless multitudes
have striven.
Four years ago HAROLD Cox (not, by the
way, a “cook's son,” but a judge's) was,

down. The journal learnedly discusses
the question, Can Medical Art give
relief in such case ? It arrives at affir–
mative conclusion and gives a few recipes.
SARK, holding that a grain of personal
experience is worth an ounce of profes-
sional advice, has been making enquiries

age, have so morbid a taste as to prefer
seclusion and the absence of réclame is,
of course, reprehensible and anti-social
to a degree; but there it is.
To the disclaimers which a contem-
porary has wrested from certain ladies
may perhaps be added the following:—
DEAR SIR,-We give you our word of
honour that the likeness of the Duchess
of MILAN was not bought for the nation
by any assistance from us. We should
lardly have lent our patronage, since
the portrait is painted by hand and not
a photo, and also since the lady (?) does
not show her teeth. Please give the
utmost publicity to this statement.
Yours, etc., ZENA and Phyllis DARE.
Me give two hundred thousand dollars
for a picture for Britishers to look at 2
Cheese it. Rose STAHL.
SIR,--The purchase of the Holbein
being completed, may we trespass on
your space to say that we know nothing
as to the identity of the lady who has
given the bulk of the money; and may
we add that so long as England tolerates
its present freedom of the Press and
its leadical Government, and repudiates
Tariff Reform, so long will such gifts
remain anonymous 2
From the nature of our business we
can naturally claim special facilities for
gauging the extent of national prosperity
or depression. We therefore do not
hesitate to affirm that should the English
continue cherishing the exploded prin-
tiples of CoPDEN and BRIGHT, to the detri-
ment of home industries and agricultural
interests, they must be prepared to
lose whatever their forefathers attained,
whether prosperity, prestige, or pictures:
in fact, everything except the peevish-
ness and profits of dealers.
Your obedient servants,
P. and P. PolNAGGI.
DEAR SIR,--I could, of course, have
given the £40,000 with the greatest ease
—by simply writing a short story—but
as a matter of fact, I didn't. It is no
interest to me to provide the nation with
pictures at which ignoramuses and toads
are free to look.
Yours faithfully, MARIE ComELLI.

money. SAPPhiBA Mongoose.

FROM ANTI-ARCTIC REGIONS.
[Dedicated to Lieut. Shackleton and his crew
by a student of zoological romance.]
YoU that have been where bergs are stiff
In ice-bound latitudes remotest–
Forgive me, brave explorers, if
I enter here my humble protest.
Of valorous deeds you did your part,
But one sea-wolf (who knows what
what is)
Has failed to find in all your chart
The grand old thrill that heaves his
leart
Up to his epiglottis.
Where was the lapse? Of course I knew;
I that had toured the globe with HENTY,
Had braved with BALLANTYNE the blue,
Longeremy summers totalled twenty—
I saw the answer clear as day,
That spelt (for me) your story's ruin;
You simply had to while away
The bloodless hours on foot or sleigh
Without a local Bruin.
Penguins you had, I hear, and seals;
Exhumed some interesting flora;
And startled in her stately reels
The aboriginal Aurora;
But never once there hove in sight
(His hairy shoulders with a hunch on)
The terror of the Arctic night,
Requesting you to stay and fight,
Or constitute his luncheon.
|That is the true explorer's note,
The contest of the bo's'un versus
(He grips his monster by the throat)
A slightly pinked Polaris ursus;
Schooled in a host of such affairs,
Stamped deep by many a writer's pen-
mark,
I tell you that a Pole sans bears
Is Hamlet played to listless chairs
Without the Prince of Denmark.

YESTERDAY the weather was decidedly
cooler. During the previous week a
great deal of rain has fallen and the
country is looking much reſreshed.
The well in the grounds of the Hotel
Magnifique has risen two feet.
A local natationist undertook to swim
from Conger Island to Flush Point on
Saturday, but had to give up the
attempt owing to becoming entangled
in drift ice off the breakwater. His
temperature is still subnormal.
The Mayor has called a public meet-

Fine bracing conditions prevailed
yesterday.
The sale of hot-water bottles is quite

Yesterday the weather was much
cooler. A splendid north-east breeze
prevailed, and the family shelters pro-
vided at the foot of the cliffs were all
crowded.
The summer muffin season has begun.
Owing to the representations of the
coroner, sea-bathing has been forbidden.
The local golf links are in excellent

The air on the sea-front yesterday was
most embracing.
After a recent open-air concert the
principal trombone player of the Cor-
poration Band was found to be suffering
from frost-bite. The Corporation has
this week decided to apply for sanction
to borrow £500 with the object of pro-
viding all the Bandsmen with fur coats.
Mr. BULSTRODE, who opposed the vote,
created an uproar by asserting that the
trombone player's complaint was chronic
snake-bite. He defended himself by
saying that in such weather it was the
act of a benefactor to provoke a heated
discussion.
The schoolboy who ate a strawberry
ice for a bet yesterday is out of danger.
THE SPRING POET.
AN UNREPORTED SEssion.
WoLUMINOUs as have been the accounts
of the proceedings of the Imperial Press
Delegates at their epoch-making Con-
ference, they have not by any means
covered all the ground. Not a word,
for example, has been said about the
momentous discussions upon the best
colours of ink for Imperial journalists,
with such fascinating side-issues as the
quality of blue pencils; nothing has
reached the public concerning the views
of the Delegates on the respective merits
of whiskey, coffee and snuff as an en-
livener when the hours are small. But
perhaps the most interesting session of
all was that which was given up to the
Spring Poet and how to deal with him,
all reports of which seem to have been
mislaid, except the following, of which
we have exclusive possession.
It was appropriate that Lord CREwe,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, should
preside over this meeting of the Colonial
representatives, since he is himself a
poet of no mean calibre and the son
of a poet, and one to whom a primrose
is more than a mere flower; and it
is appropriate, too, that in a discussion
upon “The Spring Poet and what to do
with him,” he should have at his side

Mr. ONIoss, from the Police Court, Mr.

HAM, a notable amateur lyricist, and Mr.
HALDANE, whose triolets are at once the
joy and despair of the Front Ministerial
Bench, Mr. WilkiE BARD, and Mr. PARIs
SINGER.
The Editor of the Table Mountain
Tablet said that the Cape Government
had lately passed a law making the kill-
ing of Spring Poets no murder. Since
that enactment all the Spring Poets who
could afford it wore bullet-proof cuirasses
(A voice: “Did you say queer asses?”
Loud laughter, in which the Earl of
CREwe was constrained to join) and
trousers of chain mail.
The Editor of the Maltese Terrier said
that even in Malta, a little island given
up almost entirely to the military, the
Spring Poet was known. In fact, the
local editor considered him the true
Maltese cross.
The strong man of the Singapore
Spectator said that he supposed ..
thrown out in his time as many as forty
Spring Poets. He did not hurt them
much.
The Editor of the Hudson Bayly Mail
said that the spring was not a too
noticeable feature of his country; but it
was impossible for the first glimmering
of a break in the winter to get ahead of
verses on the subject. He kept a
harpoon handy for the authors.
At this stage of the proceedings the
Conference was adjourned for half-
an-hour and Miss MAUD ALLAN, the
renowned Canadian Terpsichorean, gave
her famous impersonation of “Spring-
heeled Jill” to an accompaniment on
the pianola, tastefully contributed by
the PRIME MINISTER. After the excite-
ment caused by the performance had
died down, Mr. McKECHNIE, of the
Montreal Clarion, who declared that he
was a pure Celt, said we could not do
without spring. The poets of old drank
of the Pierian spring; the poets of to-
day generally wore spring-side boots.
Sir JAMEs CRichron-Browne said that
vernal versification, or furor Pierius,
was a well-recognised form of insanity.
Fortunately the bacillus had been dis-
covered, and an antitoxin was in course
of preparation. The only further diffi-
culty would be in inducing those who
were subject to the complaint to submit
to inoculation.
Mr. St. Loe STRACHEY said he thought
the Government had missed a golden
opportunity by not imposing poetic
licences on all persons who contribute
verse to the Press. He had calculated
that on the basis of the tax on armorial
bearings at least £500,000 could be
raised annually in this way. Failing an
impost, he strongly advocated compul-
sory military service for all Spring
Poets. They ought to be first-rate

The chief leader-writer of the Bombay

moral effect of one of his polemics had
been entirely ruined by the presence in
the same paper of a set of milky rhymes.
The Editor of the Wooloomoolloo

Poets was to ask them to drink and give
them poisoned whisky.
The Chairman, in summing up the
debate, said that they had heard a

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I wonDER what sort of notepaper is used by people in fiction:
it must be something very generous in size, for they boldly
embark upon sentences that would fill the four sides of an
ordinary sheet before coming to a fulltstop. Henry Gastomard,
the hero of Mr. MAx PEMBERTON's last book, The Show Girl
(CASSELL), opens his shoulders for the benefit of his friend
Paddy O'Connell in a way that must have warmed the heart
of his stationer. He has fallen in love with a young lady
named Mimi, whom he met at the Fête de Neuilly, and who
resides among the Bohemians of the Butte. In spite of
this she is quite virtuous, and of aristocratic (if irregular)
parentage, though this fact is not discovered until after she
has been married to Henry,
and subsequently kidnapped
by her old acquaintances. The
glimpses of Montmartre which
the author gives us are ex-
cellently vivacious, but out-
side these there are some pain-
fulweaknesses. TheO'Connell,
for instance (if that is his pro-
per title), worked off some
terribly old golf stories on us;
there is a quite impossible
parson; also a Paris detective
(supposed to be no end of a
sleuth-hound) whom even the
bull-dog routinists of Scotland
Yard would have laughed at,
and Dr. Watson himself stig
matised as a bungler. How-
ever, this last failing may be
due to the fact that the novel
is conducted entirely by corre-
spondence, a method that does
not seem to produce the
thrills I hunger for when I
take my life-preserver and go
out into the realms of the
bizarre. -

the least of whose merits is an Oxford chapter which is
obviously the real thing, and not the combined product of
imagination and a guide-book.
Sanguine of ultimate greatness myself, I follow with inte-
rest the careers of other great men, especially those of fiction.
From the study of the latter I conclude that to prove yourself
really great you have merely to talk about nothing but
yourself and to be very talkative. As to the way of achieving
this, I have learnt little. It is done, I suppose, between the
chapters. Peter Vandy starts his financial greatness (and
what greatness is not financial, nowadays?) upon original
lines and to the accompaniment of many wise and witty
sayings of his author, Edwin Pugh. Too soon be sinks into

by melodramatic methods, of which the type is familiar and
the working details not too
clearly explained. The more
money he accumulates the
duller his story becomes, until
finally his wife has to spit in
his face and be felled by his
fist in order to keep my in-
terest alive. Beyond that one
great knock-out blow, I have
to take the frequent word of
himself and Mr. Pugh for the
magnitude of Peter Vandy.
He gains the whole world, I
am told, but loses his own
soul; yet I wonder privately
whether he ever had a soul to
lose. The name of the novel
in which Peter Vandy appears
is, oddly enough, Peter Vandy.
Its publisher is C. H. White,
and its first half is well worth
reading.
In Sixty Years of Upping-
ham Cricket (Long MANs) Mr.
W. S. PATTERson, himself a
ſamous master of cricket, has
written a book of more than
merely local interest. In any
general history of the game
an important chapter must
'Tis be devoted to Uppingham,
a nursery of great cricketers,
- bred from their earliest
list of successes to her credit,
but I think none of her books has been more charming
than her latest. Galatea of the Wheatfield (METHUEN)
was really Tabitha Bolt, into the quiet of whose
country existence Gerald Bamnister breathed life and
love by teaching her grammar. So that later, when their
innocent boy-and-girl flirtation had been broken off, Tabitha,
desperate at being forced to marry the yokel Abel Fripp,
accepted literally a chance phrase in an old letter, and, follow-
ing her Pygmalion to Oxford, burst in upon him and his
astounded friends in his rooms at St. Aldate's. You see the
embarrassment of the situation for poor Pygmalion Fortu-
nately both Mrs. BLUNDELL and her characters handle it with
a delicate mastery that is wholly delightſul. The betrothal
of Tabitha and Gerald is sanctioned, indeed commanded, by
quixotic old Mr. Bamnister; and as a preparation the girl is
taken for a year to live with some titled relatives of her lover.
lºventually — but no, I think I shall not tell you quite
all the story; you remember the fate of Galatea in the
original, and this will give just enough clue not to spoil your
enjoyment of a clever and sympathetically written tale, not
| years to an observance of the
true fundamentals of
cricketing style. Mr. PATTERSON has brought to the accom-
plishment of his task a rare blend of enthusiasm, modesty
and knowledge. His account of H. H. STEPHENSON, the pro-
fessional who practically created Uppingham cricket, is most
attractive. H. H. loved a straight bat and a bat played for-
ward, and he detested the abominable “cross stroke.” So
does Mr. PATTERSON, and so, I have reason to believe, does
Mr. Punch. I observe that Mr. PATTERSON, when he first
played for the School against the Old Boys in 1871, made an
aggregate of 14 runs in two innings. In 1908, playing for
the Old Boys against the School, he made an equal amount
in one innings. In thirty-seven years he has thus doubled
his capacity. In the meantime, he had put in a few cen-
turies; and now he has written the record of his School in
the game he loves. He has done his work excellently well.

NEVER you mind! you did your little best;
Space only failed you, not a sense of duty;
Against your loyal nature you suppressed
Some most deserving types of Rank and Beauty;
And yet your list, my lad,
Ran to a hundred, eight and twenty—not so bad.
There were who moved about the velvet sward
To air their hats or even watch the races;
You had a purer purpose—to record
Their sounding names and millinery graces;
Yes, it was largely ad hoc
That you meandered round the teeming lawn and
paddock.
There were who chose to try a sporting chance
And plunge, we'll say, on Pretty Polly's brother;
To your dispassionate and fleeting glance
One end of him was very like the other;
It was your high and solemn
Task to ignore such features in your social column.
Brown, bay, or chestnut, well or badly bred,
Stout in the quarters, stocky in the barrel—
Prom Nature unadorned you turned your head,
Your business was to talk about apparel;
The noblest dam or sire
Could never compensate for absence of attire.
But when you deal with cape and voile and gown,
What a refined vocabulary ! O, Sir,
What shades and nuances ! how you dot them down
In terms to fit a butler or a grocer!—
“Café-au-lait,” “praline,”
“Champagne” and “claret,” “apricot” and “apple-
green.”
Added to these (all good to eat or drink)
Your undefeated eye observed a goddess
In “tabac brown,” and one in “pastel pink,”
And one with “tiger lilies in her bodice; ”
Also a dame who sat
'Neath iris trimmings round “a sort of turban hat.”
When I have named a robe of “Nattier blue,”
And (nattier still) a smart “Shantung” confection,
A “mole-grey” cape, a gown of “sulphur "hue—
Gems of a very fine and rare collection—
I may omit, I hope,
The louder fashions, such as “faded heliotrope.”
Some will be pained, I fear, by your neglect,
But don't let that disturb your self-composure;
Not the Recording Angel could expect
To paint the whole of that superb Enclosure;
Indeed your generous hand
Has painted quite as much as I (for one) can stand.

U. J. What's up, sonny, what 's up? Works out of
order? Too much supper last night? Feel a bit chippy-
eh, what? -
L. A. No, thank you, Uncle John, I am feeling very well.
U. J. Let's have a look at your tongue. (The tongue is
extended.) Oh dear, oh dear, that's much too pale. You've
been going it, you young dog. You'll have to take a pill,
you know. Deuced hard job, but you'll have to do it.
Mustn't burn the candle at both ends. What you want is a
pill—none of your humbugging modern pills, but a good
strong old-fashioned hard-working pill. I'll get you one in
a brace of shakes, and
L. A. I'm sure I’m very much obliged to you, Uncle
John, but I never could take pills. Papa's just like that,
too, and, besides, my health is quite good.
U.J. Ah, well, you'll be sorry for it some day, when you'
want a pill and can't get it. There was a rascally servant of
mine once, a native, who got messing about with my things.
He'd seen me taking pills, and he found the box, and, by
gum, Sir, he swallowed the whole lot at one go—might just
as well have swallowed an elephant battery. Made the
beggar sit up a bit, you know. Never heard such howls in
all my life.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, that must have been very interesting.
But I wanted to talk to you about something else, Uncle
John.
U. J. Right you are, my boy. Just you fire away.
L. A. Didn't you say, “That's me,” just now, Uncle John 3
U. J. Did I? I daresay I did. Couldn't have said any-
thing else, could I? It was me, you know.
L. A. Oh, Uncle John, there you go again!
U. J. Lor' bless me, what's the trouble 2
L. A. You oughtn't to say, “That's me” and “It was me.”
You ought to say, “That is I” and “It was I.” .
U.J. Who says so 2
L. A. Miss MacBrayne told me. l
U.J. What did she tell you that for?
L. A. Oh, Uncle John, she had to, because it's right.
She is teaching me English grammar and the rules of
English composition, and she says it is very important to
observe them, because it marks the distinction between an
educated person and a mere barbarian.
U.J. My eye, did she say all that? She's a bit of a
scorcher, isn't she?
L. A. Oh no, Uncle, I don't think she is really a scorcher.
She 's got a lot of certificates from institutions and colleges.
U.J. Ah, I daresay. That's what comes of all these new-
ſangled ideas about educating women. I always thought they
were overdoing it, and now I'm sure.
L. A. Then do you think, Uncle, that women ought to say
wrong things?
U.J. Certainly not. I never said that.
L. A. But if they're not to be educated so as to know
what's right they'll all have to go about talking like
barbarians, and you won't like that, will you ?
U.J. Well, I'm not sure. I never could cotton to a blue-
stocking, you know. But as for saying, “That's I,” I simply
can't do it, old man. Must draw the line somewhere.
L. A. But it's right, Uncle.

“MANY New FACEs since I was here LAST 2"
“YEs, Colonel. I this K ME AND You will be About the LAST of the old ser.”
U.J. Well, nobody says it, and that's enough for me.
L. A. Oh, yes, Uncle John. Miss MacBrayne says all
educated people say it, and I've made up my mind to say it too.
U.J. That's right, Arty, I like your spirit; but I'm too
old a dog to learn tricks. I shall go to my grave saying
4. That 's me.”
L. A. Oh, don't do that, Uncle. Do please say, “That's I.”
U.J. Well, I'll think about it when the time comes, but
it'll be no end of a business—embitter my last moments and
all that. However, I'll see what can be done to meet your
views. Did she tell you anything else?
L. A. Oh, yes, Uncle, lots of things.
U. J. She didn't happen to mention who was going to
win the Gold Cup, did she 2
L. A. No, Uncle, she didn't. Is the Gold Cup in the
English Grammar 2 -
U.J. No, my boy, it isn't. It's on Ascot Heath, and if
Miss MacBrayne could manage to name the winner I should
think a lot more of her education.
L. A. Well, I'll ask her, Uncle; but last time we didn't
get further than split infinitives.
U. J. Good gracious me, what sort of an animal's that?
L. A. It isn't an animal at all, Uncle John. It's a gram-
matical rule.
U.J. Well, l’ve heard of a split soda, but dash me if I've
ever heard of a split infinitive.
L. A. (after a pause). That was a joke, Uncle John, wasn't
it? I like you to make jokes like that, because I understand
them; but I never understand Mr. Blinkenstein's jokes, and
he makes a lot, and laughs at them, too.
U. J. Well done, old man! Don't you give in to any
German jokes. Keep the flag flying, you know. But about
these split infinitives; just you show me one of 'em, and I'll
settle his hash. -
L. A. Well, Papa used one the other day in his speech at
the Primrose League meeting. He said that “Mr. LLoyd-
GEORGE's avowed object was to totally annihilate the pros-
perity of the country.”
U.J. And your father's quite right, my boy. He never
said a truer word in his life.
L. A. Oh, but, Uncle John, think of the split infinitive.
If he had only said, “totally to annihilate,” or “to annihilate
totally,” it would have been all right.
U.J. So that's a split what's-his-name, is it? Well, I
shan't worry about it. Seems to me your father got hold of
the right end of the stick, and that's the chief thing.
L. A. Miss MacBrayne didn't know what to say when I
told her about it.
U.J. Well, you tell her I thought your father talked sound
Sense.
L. A. But think of the grammar, Uncle.
U.J. Oh, confound the grammar. It's the taxes we've
got to think of.
L. A. But, Uncle——
U.J. Toddle off now, sonny. I want to finish The
Sportsman.

[June 23, 1900.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RABBITS.
CHAPTER II.-ON THE RUN.
THE Major has taken a great deal of
trouble with his ground, and the result
pleases everybody. If you are a bats-
man you applaud the short boundaries;
if you are a wicket-keeper (as I am), and
Thomas is bowling what he is pleased
to call googlies, you have leisure to study
some delightful scenery; and if you are
a left-handed bowler with a delivery
outside the screen, there is behind you
a belt of trees which you cannot fail to
admire. When Archie was born and
they announced the fact to the Major,
his first question was (so I understand),
“Right or left-handed?” They told him
“Left” to quiet him, and he went out
and planted a small forest so that it
should be ready for Archibald's action
when he grew up. Unfortunately Archie
turned out to be no bowler at all (in
my opinion)—and right-handed at that.
Nemesis, as the ha'penny papers say.
“Well ?” we all asked, when Archie
came back from tossing.
“They lost, and put us in.”
“Good man.”
“May I have my sixpence back?”
I said. “You haven't bent it or any-
thing, have you? Thanks.”
As the whole pavilion seemed to be
full of people putting on their pads in
order to go in first, I wandered outside.
There I met Myra.
“Hallo, we're in,” I said. “Come and
sit on the roller with me and I’ll tell
you all about JAYES.”
“Can't for a moment. Do go and
make yourself pleasant to Dahlia Blair.
She's just come.”
“Do you think she'd be interested in
JAYES 2 I don't mean the disinfectant.
Oh, all right then, I won't.”
I wandered over to the deck-chairs
and exchanged greetings with Miss
Blair.
“I have been asked to make myself
pleasant,” I said. “I suppose that
means telling you all about everybody,
doesn't it 2 ''
“Yes, please.” -
“Well, we're in, as you see. That's
the Vicar leading his team out. He 's
no player really—one of the “among
others we noticed.' But he's a good
father, and we've borrowed two off-
springs from him. Here comes Archie
and Wilks. Wilks drove you from the
station, I expect?”
“He did. And very furiously.”
“Well, he hardly drives at all when
he's in. He's terribly slow—what they
call Nature's reaction. Archie, you will
be sorry to hear, has just distinguished
himself by putting me in last. He
called it ninth wicket down, but I
worked it out, and there doesn't seem to
be anybody after me. It's simply spite.”
“I hope Mr. Archie makes some
runs,” said Dahlia. “I don't mind so
much about Wilks, you know.”
“I’m aſraid he is only going to make
fourteen to-day. That's the postman
going to bowl to him. He has two
deliveries—one at 8 A.M. and one at
12.30 P.M.; the second one is rather
doubtful. Archie always takes guard
with the bail, you observe, and then looks
round to see if we're all watching.”
“Don’t be so unkind.”
“I'm annoyed,” I said, “and I in-
tensely dislike the name Archibald.
Ninth wicket down l’’
The umpire having called “Play,”
Joe, the postman, bounded up to the
wicket and delivered the ball. Archie
played forward with the easy confidence
of a school professional when nobody
is bowling to him. And then the leg-
bail disappeared.
“Oh ’’ cried Dahlia. “He’s out !”
I looked at her, and I looked at
Archie's disconsolate back as he made
for the pavilion ; and I knew what he
would want. I got up.
“I must go now,” I said; “I've
promised to sit on the heavy roller for
a bit. Archie will be here in a moment.
Will you tell him from me that we both
thought he wasn't quite ready for that
one, and that it never rose an inch 2
Thank you very much.”
I discovered Myra, and we sat on the
roller together.
“Well, I've been making myself plea-
sant,” I said. “And then when Archie
got out I knew he'd want to sit next to
her, so I came away. That is what they
call tact in The Lady.” . .
“Archie is rather fond of her,” said
Myra. “I don't know if—”
“Ah, yes, I understand.
ago * x
“Let's see. Are you ninety or
ninety-one? I always forget.”
“Ninety-one next St. Crispin's Day.
I'm sorry Archie's out. ‘The popular
cricketer was unfortunate enough to
meet a trimmer first ball, and the silent
sympathy of the Bank Holiday crowd
went out to him as he wended his way
to the pavilion.” Extract from “Pavilions
I have wended to, by PERCY BENSKiN.’
Help ! There goes Blair!—!”
After this the situation became very
serious. In an hour seven of us had
got what I might call the postman's
knock. Wilks was still in, but he had
only made nine. The score was 52,
thanks entirely to Simpson, who had
got 35 between first and second slip in
twenty minutes. This stroke of his is
known as the Simpson upper-cut, and
is delivered straight from the shoulder
and off the edge of the bat.
“This is awful,” said Myra. “You’ll
simply have to make some now.”
“I think it's time Wilks got on to
Years
his second speed. Why doesn't some-
body tell him 2 Hallo, there goes John.
I knew there wasn't a run there. Where
are my gloves 2 ”
“You mustn't be nervous.
make some.”
“The condemned man walked firmly
to the wickets. ‘What is that, umpire?'
he asked in his usual cool voice. ‘Hout-
side the leg stump, Sir," said the man in
white. “Good,' he replied. . . . . What
an ass your second gardener is. Fancy
being potted out like that, just as if he
were a geranium. I ought to wear a
cap, oughtn't I, in case 1 want to how
when I come in. Good-bye; I shall ||
be back for lunch, I expect.” -
I passed Joe on my way to the wickets,
and asked pleasantly after his wife and
family. He was rather brusque about
it, and sent down a very fast half-volley
which kept low. Then Wilks and I
returned to the pavilion together amid
cheers. On the whole, the Rabbits had
lived up to their reputation.
“Well, we are a lot of bunnies,” said
Archie at lunch. “Joe simply stands
there looking like a lettuce and out we
all trot. We shall have to take to Halma
or something. Simpson, you swim, don't
ou?”
“You don't have to swim at Halma,"
said Simpson.
“Anyhow,” said Blair, “we can't
blame the Selection Committee.”
“I blame Thomas,” I said. “He
would have eight and he wouldn't wait.
I don't blame myself, because my average
is now three spot five, and yesterday it
was only three spot one.”
“That is impossible if you made
nought to-day,” said Simpson eagerly.
“Not if I divided it wrong yester-
day.”
“Averages,” said the Major to the
Vicar, catching the last sentence but
two, “are the curse of modern cricket.
When I was a boy ; ,
“We are now,” Archie explained to
us, “back in the thirties, when FELIX

Thomas.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PERFECT HOLIDAY.
I.—THE CARAVAN.
The following notes are based upon
particulars supplied by the Firms
named therein.
Now that the fine weather is possibly
upon us, or, at any rate, is, according to
tho almanack, due, it is time to think
about the holidays. And what better
holiday could there be than one spent
in a caravan” Think of the morning
mists, the glory of the sunrise, the
tender beauty of the same orb's setting,
the adventures of the road, the rabbits,
the strangeness of it all (at first), the
sweet restſ ulness of the deliberate pace,
the healthy dust, the romance 1
First, the vehicle itself. A caravan is,
as you probably know, a room on wheels.
This you may either buy or hire. If
you buy it go to the Caravan Builders
Co., Bermondsey Causeway, S.E., but if
you hire it go to the Caravan Hiring Co.,
Wanstead Flats, E. In either place you
will be well treated. The advantages of
buying over hiring are (1) it becomes
your own, and (2) you have had, if the
caravan is new, no predecessors—a word
which covers a large variety of life.
The advantages of hiring over buying
are (1) you pay less, and (2) the wretched
thing does not lie on your hands after
you are dead sick of it. But do not
forget the point about predecessors.
Gipsies may have lived in it once. . . .
Picturesque devils, no doubt, but. . . .
What are the joys of the caravan:
Ah! In a caravan it is possible to have
constant change of scene, to be comfort-
ably sheltered, and yet to be continually
in the open air. To the uninitiated the
capacity of an ordinary caravan seems
almost miraculous. From the outside it
looks as though one person alone would
have some difficulty in squeezing into it;
anyhow, you say there won't be room for
anything else. It takes one's breath
away to learn that the caravan contains
a bedroom—sometimes two—a dining-
and-sitting-room, a kitchen, pantry,
wardrobe, china closet, bookshelf—in
fact, nearly as much as can be packed
into a small suburban villa.
All these things have to be fixed up,
which brings us to point No. 2–ſur-
nishing. But here the resources of
commerce are endless. For the stove
you may go to Billington's, at 153, Cur-
sitor Street; for your hat to Preedy in
Cheapside; for your boots, if new, to
Ringrose of the Strand, or if old (and
ah' old boots are best '), to Robertson's
in the Haymarket. For your gun, who
is better than Fosbrooke 2 and for your
wall-paper try Simperwill's in Sloane
Street. Do you eat chocolate 2—there
is none like Maurice's in Bond Street;

-
ON WIMBLEDON COMMON.
Bruised Pedestrian (to apologetic golfer). “WELL, SIR, if you must play BALL At YoUR TIME
of life, I wish to GoodNess You'd Use A soft one.”
while Buckstone's billiard tables are still
the best. At breakfast time, when the
morning mists have been swept away
and the fields and hedges smell fresh
and sweet, the camper knows that just
two things are necessary to make life
perfect—the smell of bacon frizzling in
the pan and the delightful all-pervading
aroma of coffee. And when considering
coffee be sure to go for an extract, for
the coffee is so much better and more
like coffee than any made from the
berry. Bostock's is the variety of which
many campers of experience naturally
think. The points claimed for it which
should specially appeal to the camper
are ease of preparation and uniqueness
of flavour when it is ready. It reminds
you of the delicious coffee you forgot to
drink thirty years ago, which has been
waiting for you ever since.
For dinner you will naturally prefer
Peter's Pemmican and Condiment Soup
to anything fresh or wholesome, since
you are on a perfect holiday and rough-
ing it is such fun, while the special
advantages of Raisin-peas must not be
forgotten.
After dinner the delicious pipe; and
you will of course smoke Tramp Mix-
ture, that heavenly blend which causes
the smoker to forget whether he is in
his shirt-sleeves or not, or if he has ever
washed.
Next week, “The Perfect Holiday.

weather in London yesterday was bright, and
a nice drying wind prevailed.”—Liverpool

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 23, 1909,
| THE COMEDY OF QUESTION TIME.
An UNRECORDED INCIDENT.
SIR Edward GREY, answering questions
put by Mr. BYLEs (L.), Mr. MACKARNESS
(L.), and Mr. WILL THORNE (Lab.), said
that the Imperial Opera House at St.
Petersburg was, as its name suggested,
in receipt of a State subvention, but His
Majesty's Government could not accept
responsibility for the visit of the leading
members of the ballet.
Mr. MACKARNESS. Is the righthon. gen-
tleman aware that The Daily Chronicle,
in its issue of the 16th inst., has stated
that Mme. PREOBRAJENSKA, “the queen
of this organisation,” is a “great deal
more thanan ordinary theatrical dancer?”
(Sensation.) I have reason to believe that
the tendency of the pirouettes executed
by this lady is distinctly reactionary,
and calculated to demoralise the demo-
cratic press——
The SPEAKER. Order. The hon. mem-
ber is not asking a question, but enter-
ing into a discussion of the ethics of the
Terpsichorean art.
Mr. BYLEs. Is the right hon. gentle-
man aware that the name of one of
the principal dancers is Mlle. Bash-
skirtsoff 2
No answer was given.
Mr. W. REDMOND. Arising out of the
previous question, Sir, may I ask
whether Mr. STOLL, the manager of the
Coliseum, is really an exiled Grand
Duke 2
Sir Edward GREY said that on making
inquiries he had ascertained that Mr.
Stoll, was the author of A Theory of
Immortality by Natural Law. This
seemed hardly reconcilable with the
grand-ducal hypothesis.
Mr. MACKARNESs. Can the right hon.
gentleman give a positive assurance that
these ballet dancers are not political
spies, whose aim is to lure the pro-
letariat from their allegiance to HENRY
and Lloyd GEORGE 2
Sir Edward GREY said he had no in-
formation that supported this ingenious
theory.
Mr. BYLEs wished to know whether it
was a fact that the Empress CATHERINE
had instigated the assassination of her
husband.
The SPEAKER. Order. Events that
happened 150 years ago are not suitable
subjects for questions, even on the part
of the Member for Bradford.
Mr. MACKARNESs. Is the right hon.
gentleman aware that there is an
intense and growing feeling in the
country as to the inadvisability of en-
couraging these salaried protégées of
the Russian Court, while corresponding
facilities are denied to the patriotic
dancing dervishes of Egypt and the
Nationalist nautch-girls of India?
Sir Edward GREY returned no answer.
Mr. WILL THORNE observed that the
right hon. gentleman was an inhuman
monster. (Labour cheers.)
Mr. W. REDMOND. Anyhow, he's got a
thorn in his side. (Opposition laughter.)
DEGENERATION.
[“It is said by the critics of democracy that
journalism of the newer type impairs and
weakens the habit and faculty of continuous
and coherent attention.”—Lord Morley.]
LONG ere the first of winter's snow
Upon this forehead fell,
A little lad I used to know—
I knew him rather well.
He loved his dog, he loved his cat,
His pink-eyed rabbit and his rat,
He loved the great good-natured cook,
But most of all he loved his book.
This little lad would read through all
A summer's afternoon;
The Heroes held him in their thrall
Till bed-time came—too soon.
He paused not till the Golden Fleece
Was brought in triumph back to Greece,
Nortill Medusa's grisly head
Had frozen Polydectes dead.
There in the great arm-chair upcurled
All else he would ignore,
Concentred in the magic world
Whereon he loved to pore.
No journals had as yet been brought
To paralyse his power of thought,
This little lad that once I knew—
Le petit moi que j'ai perdu.
At Oxford he could still attend
As one not quite insane,
And haply for an hour on end
{...} exercise his brain.
At first he quite enjoyed the scent
Of some Socratic argument,
And could pursue it like a dog
Perhaps through half a dialogue.
But soon the youth began to find
His mental vigour fail;
The proper study of mankind,
They told him, was The Mail.
He read it daily, and his power
Of brain grew weaker hour by hour;
All Plato's points he learnt to miss—
Ehew 1 Descensus facilis.
And now he reads in jerks—a liſt—
Two minutes in a train–
And ere he has the time to siſt
A sentence-liſt again.
Bus—tram—morelift—and thena strap—
More lift—what wonder if a chap
Has lost the art of thought, and bars
Papers with more than six-line pars?
-
“Aurum irrepertum, et sic melius situm
Cum terra celat.”
The above was written by HoſtMcE prior
to Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's proposal to tax
Ungotten Minerals.
A BACK NUMBER.
“No, no soup" (this to the butler).
Then I turned to the serious business of
the evening. I looked at the large and
gravely Scotch matron beside me, and
went at it gallantly.
“Don’t you think,” I began, “that
the shortage of horses, due to the spread
of motoring, may become a national
danger?”
“Very,” she replied with a pleasant
smile; “but that is so like him "-and
returned to her soup with an air of duty
done.
I hate any lacunae in table-talk, so I
made no pause to try to detect the
relevancy, if any, of her answer, but
continued with business-like briskness :
“But perhaps we are getting a little too
apprehensive of Lah—the dangers of
invasion. Who was it who said that to
meet trouble halfway is the surest
method of—er—going halfway to—in
fact, to meet trouble 2 Was it LoCKE,
BACON ? By the way, what do you think
of MARK Twain on the Baconian heresy 2"
“I like the woolly ones best,” she
said with great decision; and her glance
was as clear and untroubled as a child's.
This did give me pause. Plainly she
was guiltless of joking, and there were
no signs of incipient insanity. In my
confusion I let the butler fill my glass
with champagne, although the halfpenny
autocrat of my breakfast-table tells me
that the Smart drink only mineral water;
and I have always thought one had
better be dead than not be smar".
Vulgarian-like—but the faux pas was
due to confusion, not to ignorance—I
emptied my glass. Then, with dwindling
confidence, I spoke again.
“And what are your views on the
slump in modern drama?”
“I did once—in France,” she told
me. Heavens ! I wished I could have
changed places with Bailey Hamilton.
Bailey, on the other side of the table,
had a bright young girl next to him,
and they were already tackling their
seventh topic (Lords and the Budget).
But I wasn't going to give in yet.
“Do you think,” I said, dauntlessly—
“do you think this remarkable weather
is going to last?”
No answer.
“Do you think this remarkable weather
is going to last?” I repeated, a shade
more anxiously.
No answer. “But then,” thought I,
“the Scotch are a cautious race. It will
take time to think out something non-
committal. Or perhaps she is comparing
this year with that, and deducing her
verdict from an average of forty sea-
sons.”
The fish came —the fish went, and my
question remained unanswered. Then,
on a sudden, she turned.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM The DIARy of Toby, M.P.

able but for its deputations.”

had rather a hard day. First of all
there were the Irish distillers insisting
upon special terms in the Budget. Then
came the Welsh Members, pistol in hand,
demanding instant passage of Church
Disestablishment Bill. Worst of it is
these chaps have votes. Last week the
Irish Nationalists plumped against
Second Reading of Finance Bill. As it
happened, didn't matter much. Specific
reason for defection plainly stated. But
if Wales joins hands with Ireland, pas-
sage of Bill through Committee might
prove a thorny one.
Accordingly PREMIER “turns
on ” his persuasive colleague;
bids him see the Irish and the
Welsh malcontents in succes-
sion; to both playing the part
of the Friend of Humanity.
Meeting the Irish distillers,
LLoyd-GEORGE's tongue lingers
lovingly over a memorable line
in his prototype's address to the
Needy Knife Grinder:
“I give thee sixpence' I'll see
thee d– first.”
Restrained himself. Played
the part so well that he brought .
salt tears to eyes of hardened
benedictions. Not a dry eye in the room
when in voice trembling with honest
emotion he protested that he “would
consider the matter as a whole with as
deep a sympathy, as warm a friendship
for Ireland, as any gentleman present.”
And yet, as he reſlected when the
deputation withdrew, he had not done
more than promise “consideration.”
With his own countrymen he was,
naturally, more at home and not less
successful. On entering the room he
found them upstanding, singing “The
March of the Men of Harlech,” led from
the Chair by ALFRED THOMAS (Knight).
There was that in the stern regard
turned upon him that betokened serious-
ness of the situation. It meant war.
The Welsh Members want Disestablish-
ment and they won't wait. (No rhyme
possible about the declaration, wherein
it falls short of the attraction of GEORGE
WYNDHAM's immortal couplet. What it
lacks in rhyme is made up for in
reason.)
Task of reconciliation seemed hopeless.
WILLIAM JoNES especially turbulent in
hisattitude towards a PRIME MINISTER who
had broken faith with honest Welshmen.
Almost blood-thirsty in his denunciation
of that Minister's emissary. His sar-
donic suggestion that “in the absence
of a lamp-post they might hang the
CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer on the
Member for Pembroke ’’ was received
with roar of approval chilling to the
stoutest heart. From his altitude of
6 feet 7 Owen Philipps looked down
assenting. Not pleasant to go about
suspending a limp CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExCHEQUER. But with Welsh Members
personal convenience is never permitted
to clash with patriotic purpose.
Patienceandplausibility workwonders.
At the end of address that did not ex-
ceed a quarter of an hour in delivery,
the mutineers were won over. In an
eloquent passage spoken in their native
tongue LLoyd-GEORGE promised if they
would say nothing more about Dis-
establishment Bill this Session it should

ing off the immediate stroke of adversity
by pleasing promises for the future. As

Wednesday.—JAMEs FitzALAN HoPE,
J.P., author of A History of the 1900
Parliament, cannot make out what the
House is laughing at. Asked a simple
question. Wanted to know what, in the
opinion of the Admiralty, are the rela-
tive values, for the purpose of com-
puting the two-Power standard, of
battleships of identical fighting power
at Kiel, Toulon, Pola, Nagasaki, San
Francisco, and New York 2
Nothing could be simpler, nor any-
thing more subtly calculated to cover
the FIRST LORD with confusion.
“The relative value of battleships of
identical fighting power in their
respective ports would,” ADMI-
RAL McKENNA gravely answered,
“be one of equality.”
Then came the burst of
laughter; began below Gang-

To-day the name of LUNDON again figures
on the roll of Parliament; but another
bears it. Even Ireland, mother of
marvels among mankind, could produce
only one William LUNDON, and he died
before May was out.
The present House knew nothing of
him. Its predecessor not much. He
spoke rarely, but his speech was memor-
able as his appearance was striking. A
farmer by occupation, there were few, if
any, in the House who equalled him in the
extent and intimacy of his classical know-
ledge. Greek and Latin were more
familiar to him than the English tongue,
which as a true patriot he despised. To

lack of familiarity with it he added the
habit of addressing the SPEAKER or
the CHAIRMAN of WAYS AND MEANs as if
he were hailing him across the breadth
of the Thames. He made amends for this
by occasionally dropping his voice to
inaudible whisper, in which such point
and coherency as might lurk in the
particular passage were utterly lost.
One would have given much to have
been the confidant of Mr. LUNDON's
thoughts as he sat on a back bench
below the Gangway and regarded hon.
gentlemen opposite and on the benches
to his right. A man not given to
boasting, he was proud of the fact that
he was an early pioneer of the Fenian
movement, in connection with which he
served three years' imprisonment. When
the Land League was started he regarded
it as better than nothing and, plunging
into its wildest doings, found himself
again in prison.
It was during one of his missionary
efforts in connection with the League
that he succeeded in baffling the myr-
midon of a Saxon Government. Ad-
dressing a roadside meeting, he observed
a constable, note-book and pencil in
hand, ready to take down his words,
which it was shrewdly suspected would
be treasonable. Aſter a few introductory
remarks, he began to declaim in the
original tongue the names of the ships
catalogued in Homer. The constable
was puzzled.
All he knew was that the
language was not English nor even
Irish. But he was told off to take
verbatim report, and he was not the man
to shirk duty. So as the stately roll
was recited he struggled on, covering
sheets of his note-book with hierogly.
phics.
The best part of the story, a conclusion
possible only in Ireland, was that when
his notes were transcribed and sworn to
in Court, Mr. LUNDON was summarily
convicted under the Crimes Act and
sentenced to two months' imprisonment
with hard labour.
Business done. — In Committee of
Supply on Local Government Estimates.
“In a case at Kingston in which a boy com:
plained that three teeth were knocked out of
his mouth when he was assaulted, Mr. A. Higgs,
one of the magistrates, who is a dentist, took
the boy over to a window, and after a careful
examination was able to pronounce that the
teeth were only broken off and not dislodged
by the roots.”—Daily Telegraph.
This of course greatly mitigated the
alleged offence.
A “well-known physiologist” has let
out to The Daily Mirror the secret of the
way to avoid depression. “Be cheer-
ful,” he says. As secrets are being
given away, Mr. Punch does not mind
giving his clients a golden rule for
avoiding poverty. It is as follows: “Be
rich 1”

The Governor received me with that
dignified courtesy which has ever gone
with the control of such institutions.
“I think,” he said, “you will agree that
it is well conducted.”
He took a huge bunch of keys from its
mail and led the way.
“Here,” he said, unlocking a cell, “is
a very old offender.”
I peered into the gloom and saw an
Aberdeen terrier in the corner.
“Sandy's his name,” said the Gover-
nor. “A destructive maniac. He tears
up everything he sees–clothes, papers,
work-bags, carpets, hearthrugs, even
books. His last offence was to chew
half a presentation copy of BRYCE's
American Constitution. He is here for
a week. We cover articles with Eau-de-
Cologne, whisky, and tobacco-juice to
disgust him.”
In the next cell was a bulldog.
“Disobedience,” said the Governor.
“Won't go out for walks without a lead,
and then pulls at it like a salmon. We
fasten him to a crank, and he has to trot

In the next was a little black spaniel.
“Refuses to be broken to the house,”
said the Governor. “A stubborn case.
Otherwise a charming character. Syste-
matic lashings regularly was the sen-
tence.”
“Do you find that punishment is a
deterrent?” I asked.
“Undoubtedly,” he said ; “but they
learn slowly. One sojourn here is rarely
enough. Here, for example, is a fre-
quent visitor,” and he showed me an
Irish terrier. “A cat-worrier. We deal
with him by pushing stuffed cats charged
with electricity into his cell. In the
way they cure crib-biters, you know.
But his spirit is stronger than his sense
of pain.”
“Good dog!” I involuntarily said.
The Governor was scandalised, and led
me away. “Had I known you would

have refused you the interview.”

PRAISE TO THE FACE.
MR. HAROLD BEGBIE concludes a de-
scriptive article in The Daily Chronicle
on the great Naval Iteview by Oxpressing
the modest hope that the critics of the
Admiralty may one day come to suggest
that “our greatest battleship should be
named the Kingfisher,” adding that “it
would be a graceful amend to the creator
of the modern Navy.”
The extreme modesty of this proposal
has naturally disappointed the admirers
of “the greatest of sea-lords since Noah,”
as he has wittily been styled, and Mr.
I'unch has been positively bombarded
by suggestions as to how this culminat-
ing point in Sir John Fisher's career
should be fitly commemorated.
Mr. Rugby Pink, the famous naval
correspondent, writes: “Mr. BEGBIE
suggests that one battleship should be
called the Kingfisher. Could anything
be more miserably inadequate or un-
generous 2 My proposal, which I am
convinced will be hailed with general
acclamation, is that England should
*
lenceforth be called “Fisherland,' and
the Isle of Wight the ‘Isle of Arnold
White.’”
Mr. Yello Pearyard, the renowned
nautical publicist, opens his communi-
cation by very properly calling attention
to the superb and gorgeously poetic
metaplors of Mr. HAROLD 13EGBIE's article.
He says, “Has anyone since RUSKIN come
within a measurable distance of the
majestic sonority of this adorable exor-
dium ?— -
“‘On Saturday there was something new.
Britannia's flesh did not creep. It glowed.
Sea and Sky were like two prize-ſighters
retired to their corners after a round of hard
pounding. Every shade of bruise was in the
clouds, which were puffed and bagged and
swollen; every shade of sick green was in the
sea, which suggested a winded body and a
sinking stomach. These two antagonists re-
garded each other. They appeared to be wait-
ing for the next round. The sound of the wind
was like the murmur of conversation round the
ring.
Every now and then the rain fell ; every
now and then a pale sun, like a hamn:ered eye,
peered out of the brown-paper sky and pro-
duced the tinge of thunder in the green sea;
always the wind blew. It was cold, melan-
cho y, depressing. But—you could almost see
Britannia's flesh glow with pride.’
“Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE suggests how a
ſitting amend could be made by the
letractors of Sir John FishFR. May I
be permitted to suggest that the mag-
miſcent services of Mr. BEGIrie to the
English language, to Britannia, and to
Sea and Sky also deserve recognition.
Why should we not ſound a Chair
of Ichthyolatry at Birmingham Univer-
sity, with Mr. BEGBIE as first Professor?
Or failing that, let him be created
Honorary Admiral of the (Arnold) White,
or Controller of the Boom.”
The foregoing letters adequately repre-
sent the spirit of enthusiasm evoked by
the lyrical outburst of Mr. BEGBIE. It is
painful to add that a jarring note is
struck by one correspondent, who writes:
“I am not a superstitious man, but
when people write in this rancid strain
of fulsome complacency I want to
propitiate Nemesis by a wholesale holo-
caust of professional gushers and gup-
mongers.”

We are sorry that the two following
paragraphs should have appeared con-
secutively in The ManchesterGuardian:—

“It was also alleged that they took a number
of hens, valued at £2, from an adjoining
hen-run.”

A TARDY PROPOSAL.
[In the course of an article on “The Bride”
a daily paper points out that in respect of their
chances of getting married, waitresses come
before clerks, and clerks before teachers and
nurses.]
SoME years ago I saw her first,
Her homely face suffused with frowns,
As she (professionally) nursed
That beastly brat of Brown's.
She pleased me then, I must confess;
To her I smiled my silent thanks,
Who curbed the cub's effusiveness
With surreptitious spanks.
His governess when next we met,
She led his youthful footsteps through
The mazes of the alphabet,
The path of two times two.
'Twas not to find her still unwed
That filled me with unholy joy,
But that I knew she slapped the head
Of that unpleasant boy.
On teaching tasks she turned her back,
Her labours graced another scene;
For want of something else to smack
She smacked a type machine.
Then once again she changed her post;
Since marriage comes to her who waits,
She served out dubious eggs on toast
And so called ham on plates,
At last my laggard heart awoke
(The cap and dress became her well),
I ate the eggs, but barred one yolk,
Then softly rang the bell.
Her face, I hastened to decide,
Though plain, was not unpicturesque.
“Be mine,” I said, and she replied:
“I will. Pay at the desk.”
PUBLISHERS ANNOUNCEMENTS.
MR. LONG JANE's NEW PoET.
Mr. LONG JANE begs to announce that
he will publish shortly a volume of
poems by the new poet, Mr. Morrell
Haggis, with an introduction by Mr.
G. K. Jesterton. The co-operation of
Mr. Jesterton and Mr. Haggis in the
production of this book is eminently
Jestertonic. The two men met as
strangers to each other on the stairs of
a Battersea flat. The new Poet intro-
duced himself. “Mr. Jesterton, I pre-
sume?” he said. “It would be im-
possible,” replied the great commentator,
“to state anything more tremendously
true.” “I,” said the other, folding his
hand in that of his new friend, where it
lay like a sleeping camel in the Sahara,
“I am Morrell Haggis.” An hour later
two figures of strangely contrasted ap-
pearance might have been seen steadily
§ºiº. Battersea Park, one
shouting the other's verses to the aston-
ished heavens and a following of feckless
youths. The book containing these
wonders is only 3s. 6d. net.
MR. WELKIN MARK's NEW PoET.
Mr. Welkin Mark (exactly opposite
Long Jane's) begs to announce that he
has secured for the English market the
palpitating works of the new Montana
(U.S.A.) poet, Mr. Ezekiel Ton, who is
the most remarkable thing in poetry
since Itobert 13RowNING. Mr. Ton, who
has left America to reside for a while in
London and impress his personality on
English editors, publishers and readers,
is by far the newest poet going, what-
ever other advertisements may say. He
has succeeded, where all others have
failed, in evolving a blend of the imagery
of the unfettered West, the vocabulary
of Wardour Street, and the sinister
abandon of Borgiac Italy.
Commercial Candour.

[JUNE 23, 1909,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Story of Thyrza (Constable), by ALICE BRowN, is really
the story of two Thyrzas, with little else but the author's
own word to guarantee their identity. In the first part of
her book she sketches, with a very sympathetic humour, the
childhood of a girl of high-strung and consciously romantic
temperament, brought up in the most primitive surroundings.
In the second part we are shown a rather colourless woman
of middle-age, absorbed, after a brave struggle against
poverty and shame, in the career of her unfathered son.
The bridge that spans the yawning gulf between these two
existences may be strong enough to bear the author's feet
skimming airily along by aid of the winged sandals of imagi-
nation, but is not meant to r- - -
as I remember to have met with in recent fiction. Intro-
duced to us as a contemplative Baby (in a first chapter of
which the delicate charm would alone make the book worth
reading), his career as school-boy, undergraduate, and
grown man is developed by the author in a way that is
always convincing, because it is always the logical outcome
of the two opposing influences that directed it. There are
other characters also in the book that impress one as truly
observed : Mark Hassall, the ascetic young Oxford tutor,
whose friendship with Gervase was so strong a force in bring-
ing about the tragedy of the latter's life, is one; another is
Miriam Souls, the girl whom Gervase marries through a
strange mixture of passion and altruism. Kate, her sister
and the heroine of the story, is a figure of whose reality I am
less sure; nor can I resist a suspicion that Mrs. DEARMER was
herself not quite certain about the remaining important per-
support the gravity of the
critic. Even under my
frail weight it quivered
parlously. She has asked |º
too much of us when she lº
wants us to believe that ſº
she has provided an ade-l'A
quate motive, on Thyrza's
side, for the act that was ||Y.
to ruin her life. The credu-lºe
lity which allows the girl|}
to idealise a coarse nature
whose loyalty she has had
good reason to suspect, can-
not account for her lapse.
True, she had always had
a morbid craving for self-
sacrifice, and would cer-
tainly have laughed at con- :-
vention and run clean away
with a lover if there had ||
been a bar to their formal
union. But here there was
no such bar; and the cir-
cumstances—it is the old
story of a last train missed

All this, however, may be a matter of personal opinion; but,
for the rest, there cannot be two opinions about the charm

her feeling for what is noble in character, her sense of the
laughter that lies close to tears. If her vision is, perhaps,
rather clear than wide, she always sees the things worth
seeing. And I am glad to make the acquaintance of Barton
Gorse, and to be given once more, as in Rose Macleod, so
pleasant a picture of love between two people well past

MORE BUDGET GRUMBLES.
SIR,-May I ask all your readers to
join me in a non-political league against
the Budget 2 I am not a politician
myself. I have not the least animus
against the present Government. It
would pain me if they were to be turned
out of office. My object is simply to
secure the alteration of financial pro-
posals which I believe to be detrimental
to the public interest. Let me ask all
your readers of all parties to support
this non-political movement, and to send
their names and addresses to
Yours impartially,
- - WALTER LONG.
P.S.—I have already been surprised
and gratified to secure the adhesion of
Mr. BALFour and Mr. AustEN CHAMBERLAIN.
SIR,--I recently inherited from a rela-
tive a small legacy—amounting approxi-
mately to the sum of one million sterling.
As I frequently receive requests for
subscriptions from charitable societies,
I wish to state that I have had to pay
in death duties the sum of £100,000.
This is the income for three years of
a million invested at 3% per centum.
Therefore you will see that for three
years I am absolutely without any in-
come whatever and shall be unable to
subscribe a farthing even to the most
deserving charity. It wounds me deeply
that the rapacity of a Chancellor should
check the stream of benevolence.
Yours practically
A PAUPER.
P.S.–I am taking legal opinion as to
whether, considering the fact that I
possess no income, I am not eligible
(during the next three years) for an old-
age pension.
SIR,-From my landed estates I derive
a gross income of £80,000. Of this no
less than £40,000 is paid away in income
tax, local rates, insurance against death
duties, repairs, allowances, subscriptions
and other charges. Thus I already lose
half of my income, and am left the
miserable pittance of £10,000 a year.
Were it not for certain investments apart
from land I could not make both ends
meet. And now a super-tax of 6d. in
the £ is to be levied on my income.
This means that I must economise. I
shall therefore discharge one plumber,
one mason, one bricklayer and one
carpenter from my estate staff. Perhaps
this will teach the democracy that it is
dangerous to lay hands on capital.
Yours truly,
SIRU (;GLER.
SIR,--I happen to be a millionaire—a
bare millionaire—that is, the value of
my landed property just exceeds a
million. Now, apparently, this Budget
merely takes away one-tenth of the pro-
perty in case of my death. But I
intend to prove that circumstances may
arise under which the Government may
confiscate not a mere tenth but two-
thirds of my property.
Let me suppose that I am walking on
the seashore in company with my ten
sons. There is nothing improbable in
that. We are cut off by the tide and take
refuge on a rock. A breaker sweeps me
away, to the infinite regret of my off-
spring and the fiendish delight of the
Chancellor, who rakes in a cool hundred
thousand. The next breaker carries off
my eldest son, and with him £90,000.
The others follow in order. By the
time the lifeboat rescues my youngest
son the estate has been reduced to
*:350,000—roughly two-thirds of its
value confiscated.
I ask you, shall such things be? I say
never. To show my determination I am
sending a subscription of 10s. 6d. to the
Budget Protest League, and I ask all
millionaires to follow my example.
Yours truly,
AN ANXIOUS PLUTOCRAT.
SIR,-My landed property consists of
one cliff and its adjacent foreshore on
the Eastern coast. At present its rental
value as a goat pasture is 7 s. 6d. per
annum. But I can see possibilities for
its development. I am working strenu-
ously for and giving largely to the
Tariff Reform League. When Tariff
Reform comes the ample cave accommo-
dation for smugglers in my cliff will let
readily at fabulous prices. Am I to be
taxed on this wealth which I am labour-
ing to create 2
If so I shall refuse the use of my
caves to smugglers and hold out for
higher prices still. Reluctantly I should
be compelled to offer my cliſt and fore-
shore to foreign Governments as a highly
cligible invasion site.
Yours truly,
PATRIOT.
Siſt, -ſ own a few acres of agricultural
land of poor quality, which till this year

it has this advantage—it borders the
private golf course of a Cabinet Minister.

throw bottles, fly kites, and shout

so, is it not also just that I should re-

the members of the Social and Political

LATEST NEWS FROM THE IROADS.
(By Our Motoring Erpert.)
BATII Road.—During the re-tarring
operations yesterday a child named
Albert Burdekin, aged 4 years, fell on
a patch of still warm tar and became so
firmly imbedded in it that it took several
navvies to extricate the little sufferer,
whose clothes were completely destroyed.
Sir Leon Guggenheimer, however, who
was passing by at the time, kindly
proffered an old fur coat, in which young
Iłurdekin was removed to the Hounslow
Cottage Hospital.
BARNES AND DISTRICT.-Tarring opera-
tions are in full swing on the Barnes —
Richmond road. Special accommodation
is now provided for tar babies at the
Nurseries, Upper l'ichmond Road.
13RIGHTON Road.—I'very Sunday this
popular highway grows more and more
reminiscent of the Red Sea during the
Iºx dus. On Monday the 21st a remark-
able experience was enjoyed by a well-
known motorist in the neighbourhood
of Handcross. Having been obliged
to stop in order to execute some trifling
repairs, this gentleman became nearly
faint owing to the strong scent of clover
from an adjacent field.
CoVENTRY Road.—Tarring operations
concluded on Saturday between St.
Albans and Markyate. The surface is
now being treated with lavender-water
at the expense of the firm of Schmüller.
EASTROURNE Road.—The neighbour-
hood of Frant is still convulsed by the
witticism of a well-known motoring
nobleman who observed that the process
of re-tarring the road was apt to retard
his progress.
GREAT North Roap.-On Friday last
an obelisk was unveiled about four miles
from Welwyn to commemorate the
escape last year of Lord George Bostock,
who had the misfortune to collide with
a steam-roller at this spot.

OH, the sunny month of June,
When our hearts are keeping tune
With the whisper of the breezes and the murmur of the stream,
When the girls are making posies of the pansies and the roses,
And the gardens have the glory and the freshness of a dream.
Oh, the leafy month of June !
It will vanish very soon,
With its hours of light and beauty and its flowers and its

With the joyous trills and gushes of the blackbirds and the

And the laughter of the children as they tumble in the hay.

I had rhymed so far with rapture when the sky grew black
as ink,
And before I had a moment to collect myself and think,
With a flash
And a crash
!ame a sound of awe and wonder;
Came a summer-burst of thunder;
And the rain, a rushing river,
Drenched me through and made me shiver;
And I hurried helter-skelter
To the very nearest shelter;
And the song-birds ceased their singing
In the branches bleak and wringing;
And the gardener, crouching closely
In his shed, spoke up morosely.
He and I had one desire–
To get home and light a fire
In the wet and freezing noon
Of a jolly day in June.

have been awarded to them by the President of the United States in
recognition of their services in rescuing the shipwrecked crew of the
American schooner Edward J. Berwind."—Morning Post.
There is a true British ring about all this.
The tendency of many released Suffragettes to resort in
London to a vegetarian restaurant for breakfast seems to have
spread to Liverpool. The local Echo tells how a certain
“Holloway heroine,” on her return to that centre of activity,
“was presented with a banquet of flowers.”
“At the annual convention of the British Undertakers' Association
Mr. Porter, the president, said that good would result in every way if
women took more part in business.”—Daily Mail. -
A pretty compliment, which would, however, have come
better, perhaps, from the president of some other association.

POET AND PENGUIN.
[One of the photographs of Lieutenant
SHAckleton's Expedition shows a group of
antarctic penguins being entertained with selec-
tions from a gramophone].
WHEN the sun has finished setting
And the light begins to wane,
And the fly has ceased coquetting
With his image on the pane;
When the timid batling hovers
Round the lonely country barns,
And the myriad race of lovers
Spin their yarns;–
When the babe is hushcd to by-by,
Cradled in her tiny cot,
And the little fairies fly by,
Smiling on the tender tot;—
Then, in short, beneath the crimsoned
Skies of eve, I take my chair,
Gently stretch my weary limbs, and
Sniff the air.
Twilight! bashful hour when Cupid
Makes the lips of those that love
Utter things intensely stupid
(As I've hinted up above);
Twilight hour ! when man is smitten
With a liking for his lot,
Hour of which the bard has written
Lots of rot
Here I weep no tears of sorrow
O'er my oft rejected rhymes;
Here I feel no need to borrow
Money, as I've felt at times;
Here I muse upon the mystic—
Hark! is that the Thing that moans
Nightly chez my inartistic
Neighbour Jones?
Woe is me! is this my reverie
Thus to end at his caprice?
Must I bear with him whenever he
Chooses to disturb my peace?
Cam I never soothe my forehead,
Never calm my restless brain?
Why must I endure this horrid
Noise again?
True, I've heard that in the freezing
Regions round the Southern Pole
This insufferable wheezing
Soothes the penguin's puny soul;
But a penguin and a poet
“Married to immortal verse”
Differ vastly ; and I know it
Makes me curse.
Yes! I have a finer feeling
Than a bird can ever know;
And my higher brain is reeling
With the row, and I must go.
Jones' I'd drown you, were it lawſul-
Laugh to hear your bubbling moan-
Lashing round your neck that awful

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from The DiARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 21.
—“Having disposed of the Instructions,
I will now leave the Chair.”
As he said this, looking round the
benches with regard of wholly kind,
partly pained sympathy, there was in
the SPEAKER's voice a note of manly
pathos that went straight home to the
hearts of the audience addressed. Occa-
sion momentous. After days and weeks
of talk round the Finance Bill, House
now about to get into Committee. Real
business beginning. How long it will
łast who can say? Already on this our
opening day over one hundred pages of
solidly printed amendments circulated.
Every day will bring its sheaves with
it. For three days a week through the
sad summer time the House, getting
into Committee not later than four o'clock
in the afternoon, will sit through long
evening into the young fresh morning.
And the SPEAKER will take no part in the
grinding of a mill whose slowness is
upon occasion unparalleled among the
legislative machinery of the world.
It is not his funeral. It may literally
prove to be that of the CHAIRMAN of WAYS
AND MEANs and his Deputy. Day after
day, when the House resolves itself into
Committee of Ways and Means to take
in hand the Finance Bill, the SPEAKER
will retire to the learned leisure of his
library. Some would have gone off
jubilant, happy in the good fortune that
befell them. Not so Mr. LowTHER. He
stood for a moment gazing upon the
throng, then turned, and with audible
sigh of sympathy slowly strode forth.
Mr. EMMoTT hopped into chair at the
Table and forthwith ruled a batch of
lamendments out of order with decision
land energy that did something to relieve
a painful situation.
MEYSEY-Thompson put first block in
wheel of progress. Moved to postpone
Clause 1. Proceeding to enlarge on
principle of unearned increment, was
pulled up by CHAIRMAN.
“The hon. Member must speak to his
motion,” said Mr. EMMOTT.
“I do not quite understand,” said
MEysEy-THOMPson, naturally amazed at
I this ruling. “Am I to speak only as
to postponement?”
“Most certainly.” -
“What am I to say then?” he gasped.
Here was chance for kind souls op-
posite. Full muster of legal talent on
Treasury Bench. Attorney-GENERAL,
SolicitoR-GENERAL, LORD Advocate, So-
LicitoR-GENERAL For SCOTLAND–any one
could have told the distraught Member
what to say in support of his motion.
They sat dumb, unsympathetic.
Then, “Sir, I beg to move,” mur-
mured MEYSEY-THOMPSON, and dropped
into his seat.
This the solitary instance during
sitting where Member had amendment
on paper and no speech in support of it.
At midnight two amendments disposed
of with assistance of Closure. WILLIE
PEEL rose and protested against “the
headlong, hurry with which we are
rushing through this Bill.”
Not hitherto suspected of being a
humorist, his reputation established at a
stroke.
Business dome.—First night in Com-
mittee on Budget Bill.
Tuesday. — Sultry atmosphere out-
side. Lowering clouds threaten thunder-
storm. With quick sympathy the
House discloses similar atmospheric
characteristics. Rumbles of thunder,
spluttering of rain, sudden flashes of
lightning, mark course of proceedings.
“The NIMBLE GALLIARD.”
(After the picture by J. Seymour Lucas, R.A.)
[“Mr. L'oyd-George has shown much humour and extraordinary intellectual nimbleness and
agility during these discussions (on the Finance Bill).”—Daily Paper.]
Half-an-hour before midnight storm
burst in full fury. Opposition elated
by result of division on PRETY MAN's
amendment exempting agricultural land
from increment tax. Irish Nationalists
going in body into the Lobby with
their hereditary allies, the country gen-
tlemen of England, majority dropped
to a trifle over 100. When burst of
hilarious cheering from Opposition died
away, CHANCELLOR of the ExCHEQUER
moved Closure on portion of Clause
dealing with increment. This meant
wiping off the slate two and a half pages
of amendments.
Instantly hilarity blazed into fierce
resentment. The old familiar cry,
“Gag Gag "-precursor of many
violent scenes—filled the Chamber.
“Put the whole Bill,” cried a Unionist,
metaphorically emptying his pockets in
face of ruthless highwayman.

What would the CHAIRMAN
do? Would he grant Closure

precedent in dealing with
Bill, or would he withhold
assent 2 Mr. EMMoTT, master

ments fell, walked on both
sides of the highway. Among

Otherwise CHAIRMAN would

the Chair.

He was, so to speak, the straw

business, refused to appoint

carried without division.

FALSTAFF'S OFFENCE.
SIR John, I’ve never yet attacked
Your taste for taverns and for tippling,
Or rated you because you lacked
The lithe proportions of the stripling;
Your braggadocio irks me not,
I rather like a brawl's excitement—
And yet against you I have got
A strong indictment.
'Tis that you pestered Mistress Page
With clumsy and unwelcome wooing,
Until she threatened in her rage
To draſt a Bill” for man's undoing;
That threat has filled our days with strife,
Our docks with many a fair defendant,
And each is of that merry wife
A true descendant.
Should Mistress Page's Bill go through,
And woman snap her final fetter,
The blame, old Jack, will rest with you,
The measure's only true begetter.
Meanwhile, I trust your sprite will
squirm

THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
ON the eve of the third Test Match
we feel bound to give publicity to the
following illuminating advice and
suggestions that have reached us with
regard to England's representatives.
“PAx”, writes to say: “Would it not
be a good idea if separate private
pavilions were erected for all amateurs
consenting to play for the Old Country,
and if a rule were to be passed that all
communications between these gentle-
men on the field of play should be made
through the umpires P’’
[Poor. “PAx' has been swallowing
some silly rumour.—ED.]
“CoNEY,” writing from an address in
the Midlands, suggests that in order to
make the Australians look a little more
like rabbits than they did at Lord's,
England's fast bowlers in the forth-
coming Tests should be BURRows of
Worcestershire and WARREN of Derby-
shire.
An anonymous writer suggests that,
to ensure a sticky wicket at Leeds,
GEORGE HIRST might be requested to
furnish the groundsmen with a gratis
supply of his health toffee.
“MATHEMATICUs” writes to ask whether
Triangu'ar Tests will be possible on the
Oval.
In pursuance of the theory that dour

an eleven (which we have not the space

capital D's.
Later. A report reaches us that if
the worst comes to the worst Mr. G. K.
CHESTERTON has promised to don an
M.C.C. cap and a false black beard and
lead the field against the Australians.
DRUGS FOR WEG.
The success of the fruit grower who
has brought on his strawberries ten
days earlier by giving them ether has
set the gardeners of England busily
engaged in experimenting with drugs
for fruit and vegetables.
Green peas, in order that they may be
green, are now being freely drenched with
a solution of arsenic, and the tonic blood-
making propertics of the beetroot are
vastly increased by an injection of iron
into its veins. The eyes of potatoes
can be made, it has been observed, vastly
are what do it, “Devonian” has selected
more attractive by a few drops of bella-
donna; while the sensitiveness of the
sensitive plant is dulled by judicious
doses of cocaine or morphia.
Pears, as our fruitarian readers need
not to be reminded, are peculiarly liable
to the sleeping sickness, but it has now
been discovered that if hot coffee is
supplied to the fruit during its grow-
ing stage, complete immunity from this
complaint is secured.
But perhaps the greatest triumph of
all is the “New Way of Life for Onions,”
as devised and carried out by the famous
Russian scientist, Professor Wejnikoff.
The onion, though one of the noblest of
vegetables, has unfortunately long been
regarded as suspect in the best circles
owing to its peculiar aroma. The Pro-
fessor, however, by spraying it with a
solution of eau-de-Cologne, patchouli
and opoponax, has succeeded in com-
pletely deodorising this entrancing
vegetable, which can now be eaten with
impunity by the most fastidious mem-
bers of the plutocracy.

IN THE AIR.
The offer to the nation of an air-ship,
to be paid for by the readers of The
Morning Post, and a garage by The
Daily Mail, has naturally spurred other
papers (never contemptuous of hints)
to acts of similar patriotic generosity.
The Daily Telegraph has placed at the
disposal of the Government a colossal
balloon in the shape of Mr. HALDANE for
any purposes that may be required, the
only condition of acceptance being that
the name of the journal shall be pro-
minently emblazoned upon it.
The Daily Express cffers to start a
I'resh Air Fund to supply the vapour
with which the airships are filled.
The Daily News does not see its way
to support the War Office in any way,
but rather than do nothing it offers to
subsidise Mr. ChESTERION sufficiently
handsomely to make it worth his while
to engage any or all of England's
enemies in argument on any subject
whatever immediately they land, and to
do it so successfully as to blow them
into thin air.
The Pall Mall Gazette solicits sub-
ship to present to the
scriptions for the purchase of a Bellair-
Board of
Admiralty.
The Spectator will gladly provide the
country with a sufficient number of
trained pigeons (each one the hero of a
touching anecdote illustrating the intel-
ligence of birds) to act as news-carriers
in time of war.
The Guardian volunteers to provide a
dovecote to harbour The Spectator's war
pigeons during their periods of pacific
inactivity.
The Globe offers no airship proper, but
promises that when that pºrtion of the
millennium arrives which provides for
the flying of pigs it will present the
Admiralty with rashers of aerial Bacon.
The current issue of The British
Weekly contains a brilliant article from
the pen of “CLAUDIUS CLEAR,” appealing
in clarion tºnes to the supporters of that
renowned periodical to come to the
rescue cf their distressed Fatherland.
He confidently demands from them the
sum of £50,000, with which to purchase
and place at the disposal of the nation
a Nicoll-plated airship, to be called The
Kailyard, as well as a Kentish Fire
balloon, with a crew exclusively com:
posed of Men of Kent.
The enterprise of The Sphere takes
the form of a passionate appeal from
Mr. Shorter to his readers to provide
funds enabling him to present the nation.

Mr. Punch has pleasure in quoting
the following extract from a rival publi-
cation, entitled, “Field Service Regu-
lations,” and issued by the War Office:
“A Contribution is a forcible collection
in money or in kind . . . and is gene-
rally inflicted as a punitive measure,
and as a matter of policy.”
AYorkshire contemporary relates how
“a street organ, manipulated by three
men who professed to be unemployed,
was suddenly pounced upon by the
police and charged with stealing eggs.
This instrument must be one of the
many Radical organs which support the
great robber of hen-roosts.

IN the lumber-room Irummaged for some papers out of place,
When I came—among the cobwebs—on a small morocco case,
Raised the lid and saw a medal, on its upturned side a date,
“1857' graven on the tarnished laurelled plate.
'Twas enough ; and ere I turned it in its faded velvet bed
Quite a host of recollections ran in riot through my head;
And from out the musty boxes, loved of spider and of mouse,
Came a half-forgotten story of an owner of the house.
Thus: A dusty roadway rises and an Indian sun beats down
Where an English scouting party gallop in from Delhi Town.
On their flank the rebel rifles rattle out in sudden storms,
One full mile in front is shelter, where a sweating battery
forms.
On they come in open order, through the danger zone they
sweep,
Save the last, whose wounded charger pecks, and pitches in
a heap,
Struggles, shivers and lies quiet, while the trooper makes a
run,
Tries to join his comrades halting under cover of the gun,
Where they breathe their sobbing horses, and the boy who's
in command
Knocks the dust from off his tunic, numbers off his tattered
band,
Throws a glance along the roadway where the bullets flick
and bound,
Sees the distant, limping figure, swings his reeking Arab
round,
Swears, and, sitting down to gallop, sends him racing back
again,
Gets the trooper up in safety, spite the raking leaden rain,
And again defies the gauntlet of the glaring shot-swept road,
Till the Arab rocks and staggers into cover with his load

This the story I remembered of those days by Delhi's gate,
As I read the magic figures of the medal's famous date.
Then it seemed to my romantic and unmilitary mind
That some record of his riding might be found engraved
behind.
So I turned it, and discovered that, some fifty years ago,
His Aunt Jane had scored with butter at the local county show.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ONE can guess what started Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD on the
scheme of her Daphne, or “Marriage à la Mode” (CASSELL).
One pictures the author on her visit to the States, and a New
Englander saying to her, “Our divorce laws are a scandal to
civilisation; why don't you, dear Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, with
your powerful pen, write a novel exposing these iniquities?”
On the other hand, she may have undertaken the voyage
with this set object before her. Anyhow, it is a pity that,
even from so heterogeneous a race, Mrs. WARD should not
have selected for her excellent purposes a purer type than
this daughter of an Irishman and a Spanish South American
woman. A pity too that she complicates her case by marry-
ing Daphne not to another American but to the native of a
page is a delight, written with humour and sympathy, and
a gentle satire none the less biting for its restraint. Especi-
ally does the figure of practical Dr. Brink himself dwell in
the memory, with his kindness, his steady disclaimers of
philanthropy, and above all his very human enjoyment of
the good Burgundy that his work enables him to afford.
Perhaps the chief charm of the book is its entire avoidance
of sentimentality. The tragi-comedies of Bovingdon Street
call forth their own tears and laughter without any apparent
manipulation by the author. In short, Mr. Lyons' Sirpenny
Pieces have the ring of true metal, and I for one shall eagerly
anticipate another issue from the same excellent mint.

Even so, she is hampered by, the

the plot, never her strongest point, is
at times perfunctory, and the rather
crude devices by which Daphne is
allowed to secure evidence to sup-
port her case for divorce seem, if
I dare hint it, to savour a little of
Palais Royal farce. - -
I notice that the publishers' an-
nouncement states that “the whole
story leads up to the scene in the
last chapter between the divorced
husband and wife, and by it Mrs.
WARD is content that her book should
be judged.” And well she may be,
for it is certainly a very strong
and moving chapter, and we are
most of us content to be judged
the tactics of party newspapers
are not quite so black as Mr. A.
GowANs WHYTE paints them. All
the same, it is not his politics but
his love affairs, and his relations
with the three women who influenced
him most, that make one really like
the book. There are certain passages
in his friendship with one of these
ladies through which I wish Mr.
WHYTE had drawn his pen. But the
story of his unconsciously-growin
love for the woman whom he eventu-
ally marries is idyllic in its earlier
moments, and marked in its climax
by all the ruggedness proper to the
course of true love. The impedi-
ment to their happiness was a dark
chapter in her previous life, which

confessed that, though the book ENTERPRISE. darker chapter in his mother's life,
opens well and ends very well, and
throughout offers many proofs that the old craftsmanship has
not been forgotten, Mrs. WARD has done better work.
I must end with a sincere compliment to the tact she has
shown in handling a difficult subject without offence to the
feelings of the nation whose laws (and some of their manners)
she assails. Americans are notoriously sensitive of criti-
cism; but the best of them are bound to welcome this
attack upon a condition of things from which they are the
chief sufferers. A postscript of praise is due to Mr. PEGRAM's
delicate illustrations in colour.
Sixpenny Pieces (Join LANE) takes its name from the
practice of that most amiable physician, Dr. Brink, of
Bovingdon Street, who prescribed for the dwellers in his
neighbourhood on what is called the spot-cash system at
sixpence a consultation. Fortunately the patients were un-
aware that Mr. A. NEIL LYONs was watching them all the
time through the little window above the gas-stove in the
kitchen ; and those who remember Arthur's, by the same
writer, will not need to be told what excellent use he makes
which he chanced to discover, put
the lovers more nearly on a level. And so two blacks made
a white, and Mr. Whyte made a good ending to a good book.
In An Honest Man (METHUEN) the reader may study the
curious operation of a stone trying to draw blood from itself
and, supposing stones to have families, from its wife and
children. Honest Milsom's dishonest partner defaults with
most of the firm's assets, but the firm's creditors, dis-
regarding the etiquette of fiction, temper justice with mercy
and are not the less true to life for that. They allow the
firm's debts to stand over indefinitely; but Milsom's pride is
not to be so easily put off. It drives him to play the martyr
to the gallery and the brute to his family, even to abuse his
sweet wife to his miserable ledger-clerk and to do other
detestable things, the pecuniary advantage of which is some-
times obscure. There is, indeed, a striking and possibly a sound
idea at the back of the author's mind, that a man's sense of
honour is often a nuisance and occasionally a positive curse;
but the next time Mr. R. H. BRETHERTON has a striking idea, he
should invite some expert novelist to teach him the art, or
of his opportunities. The result is a book of which every
undertake for him the business, of its proper exposition.

4 - EN OF PUDVILLE ' " concluded the Orator, “the eyes of England are upon you ! Vote for Spinks and Free
Trade! Vote for Spinks and the sacred principle of One Man, One Vote! Vote for Spinks and the triumph
of a Socialist Budget !”
As he descended from his al fresco hustings, the Orator was approached by a gentleman of philosophic aspect.
“Pardon me, Sir," said the Thinker, raising his hat, “but I have had the ill-luck to miss all but your excellent peroration;
and I should take it as a peculiar favour if you would kindly define for me the exact meaning of a ‘Socialist Budget."
Is it one, as the term would seem to imply, in which all men are equal in the eyes of its framer ?”
“By a Socialist Budget,” replied the Socialist Orator (it was his proud boast that he had never said “Sir” or raised
his hat, to any man), “I mean one by which the bloated Capitalist is compelled to pay for the down-trodden Masses from
whose sweated labour he has piled up his iniquitous accumulations of filthy and unearned lucre.”
“Yet I take it,” said the Thinker, “that you have sufficient self-respect to desire to contribute your fair proportion
toward the maintenauce of the Empire?”
“I get all the self-respect I need,” replied the Orator, “from the fact that I belong to the ranks of Labour. My
contribution to what you call ‘the maintenance of the Empire’ is moral rather than pecuniary. I earn a starvation
pittance of £150 a year as a Labouring Man, and therefore pay no income-tax. I am a lodger. I allow myself no
luxuries, being a non-smoker and a total abstainer from intoxicating beverages. My doctor forbids me tea and sugar.
As I suffer from gout-' poor man's gout,’ need I say?—I drink imported mineral waters, and these are not taxed by a
Free Trade Government.”
“And I may assume that you subscribe to the gospel of Free Food 2"
“Would you tax the poor man's bread, his staff of life?” protested the Orator.
“It seems the only way of getting at some of you. Unless the necessities of life are taxed, how can men like you
be expected to have a proper sense of the responsibilities of citizenship 2"
“We get that by exercising our right to vote.”
“To be sure. Which reminds me that I just now passed a sandwichman carrying the legend, “No Taxation without
REPRESENTATION'; and since we began our conversation I am more than ever impressed with the belief that there is quite

as much to be said for the converse doctrine–No REPRESENTATION WITHOUT TAXATION. Yours, of course, is an exceptional
case. You are peculiarly abstemious. But even the average labourer who has a vote does not pay anything like his share
of the State's expenses. How do you reconcile this condition of things with your principle of ‘One Man, One Vote'?”
“All men are equal in the sight of Heaven,” replied the Orator.
“But not in the sight of Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE.-Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE wants us to believe that the Landowner and the
Publican and the Millionaire (especially the dead Millionaire) are much bigger and better fellows than the rest, and that
he ought to do them the honour of making them pay the lion's share of the cost of Empire. Very good, I say, if only he
gives them a proportionate voice in the disposal of their contributions. Your doctrine of “ONE MAN, ONE VoIE' is directed
against the pluralists, men who just happen to have voting qualifications in more than one constituency. But I would
carry the system of pluralism much further. I would say, ‘No TAXATION without CoRRESPONDING REPRESENTATION. If I
subscribe ten times as much in taxes as my neighbour, and if these taxes are honestly imposed, it must mean that I have
ten times as much interest as he in the disposal of the State's revenue; therefore I ought to have ten votes to his one.
Who pays the piper most has the right of calling the greatest number of tunes.”
A spasm of indignation played across the face of the Orator. “You would be throwing the power of Parliament,”
he said, “into the hands of the Capitalists, and they would bring in Budgets which would lay the burden of taxation on
the Labouring Classes.” -
“And an excellent thing for you,” replied the Thinker. “You would then get a corresponding increase of votes,
and be able to turn the Capitalists out at the next election and produce the kind of Budgets you like best. The pendulum
would swing for a little, but would soon reach a state of millennial repose.” i
“I don't like your millennium,” said the Orator, “and I disagree with you in every particular.”
“Then,” said the Thinker, “let us put the case to arbitration. Yonder I observe, alighting from his car, a |
gentleman of a wise and judicial countenance. Let us appeal to him.”
+ + -k * + *
Scarcely had the benign old Sage caught the gist of their argument when he politely interposed.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “I am no party politician. I have a habit of smiling at various forms of folly, but I make ||
it a principle not to attempt to assign to them any order of merit, saying, ‘This is foolish, but that is more foolish still.” On
the contrary, I have with me a soothing compound for the composure of all differences. Permit me to hand you a
couple.” -
And with that, and a courtly bow, MR. PUNCH (for it was he) bestowed on each a sample of his
Ønt jumbrel and Chirty-sixth tolume.
