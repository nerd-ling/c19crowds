Sporting Combines.
To the list of established hybrid games–Ice-Hockey, Bath-
Handball (sometimes called Water-Polo), and Pony-Hockey
(sometimes called Polo, tout court)—it is now proposed to add
the sport of Roller-Tennis. Other attractive combinations
have occurred to us, such as Airship-Golf, Submarine-Foot-
ball, Jujitsu-Curling (with humans for stones), Motor-Cricket
(petrol interval at 4.30), Express-Patience (for Messenger
Boys), Polo-Bridge (like ordinary Bridge but with a mounted
dummy), Croquet-Billiards (played on the usual billiard-
table and highly recommended by the manufacturers of
the same), Antarctic-Marathon (to find the Pole, then once
round and back), Lacross?-Badminton, and Looping-the-
Caber.

mitted to Socialism, but in the trough of a wave in which it would be in
peril of ploughing the arid sands of Opposition.”—Belfast Newsletter.

PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GERM-CARRIER.
IN U.S.A. (across the brook)
There lives, unless the papers err,
A very curious Irish cook
In whom the strangest things occur:
Beneath her outside's healthy gloze
Masses of microbes seethe and wallow,
And everywhere that MARY goes
Infernal epidemics follow.
Herself immune and full of beans,
A state her ruddy cheek confirms,
They say she runs, behind the scenes,
A toiling factory of germs;
Wherever, rosy and robust,
She was engaged to boil the victuals,
The family would bite the dust,
Falling about her path like skittles.
What latent seeds of typhoid lurk
In ambush near her every pore,
You'll see in Dr. Sopf:R's work—
“A Chronic Germ-Distributor;”
A statistician gives his view
That, if she kept a dairy farm, he
Reckons that on her own she'd do
More damage than a German army.
Our MARY, being shut away
For two whole years to get her clean,
Is just as germy as the day
On which she went in quarantine;
And now the Court that tries her case
(Her chance was but the merest cipher)
Sprinkles aseptics round the place
And says she ought to have a lifer.
And yet she's not the only one
That ſlings destruction far and wide,
And still contrives somehow to shun
The horrid poison housed inside;
I know a man, with health as rude,
Whose lightest word and simplest wheeze'll
Throw off a germ you can't elude—
Either a mump or else a measle.
As blooming as a perfect peach,
And hard as is the camel's hump,
Lloyd never learned, by sampling each,
To tell a measle from a mump;
Yet where he goes the microbes spread;
You mark, though he is never ailing,
Horror that vainly scoots ahead,
And pestilence behind him trailing.
Among his hundred books (the best),
Lord AVEBURY, counting up his cash,
Was shocked to find his noble chest
Break out into a measly rash ;
“Nathaniel,” too (that's not his name,
But let it serve for Budget humour),
Secured a brace of mumps that came
And caused a nasty facial tumor.
How deal with one who bears about
These germs of Socialistic rot?
Some would employ, to snuff him out,
A lethal chamber. I should not.
I recommend a happy mean,
A more humane and temperate measure:
I'd have him clapped in quarantine,
There to abide the country's pleasure. O. S.

Little Arthur. Papa, you 're a Conservative, aren't you ?
Papa. Yes, my boy, of course I am.
L. A. Why do you say “ of course,” Papa? Couldn't you
have been a Liberal?
Papa. Certainly not.
L. A. Why not, Papa?
Papa. Oh, ah, well, they're a wretched lot, you know, con-
fiscators and all that. They're never happy unless they're
upsetting everything, and undermining the Church and the
Constitution.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I've heard you say that before, and I'm
sure it must be very dreadful. But, Papa. -
Papa. Well, what is it? Speak up, you know. I'm only
too ſº you're showing an intelligent interest in polities.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I’m trying to do that. I was going to
ask you if you thought all Liberals were bad men 2
Papa. Oh, I don't go so far as that.
L. A. But if they're robbers, Papa, and disloyalists, and
if they mean to abolish the King and destroy the Army and
ruin the Navy, and if they're revolutionists actuated only by
sordid greed and envy
Papa. Who put all those long words into your head 2
L. A. You did, Papa.
Papa. I?
L. A. Yes, Papa. I took them all from your speech at the
meeting last week. You said (reading from a newspaper):
“If you desire to have in power men who are disloyalists
steeped to the lips in treason, if you wish the Government of
this great country to be carried on by those who would
uproot the throne, rob the rich, destroy property, tax the
poor man's beer, and place our navy at the mercy of foreign
powers; if --—”
Papa. Yes, I remember.
L. A. That was what you said, Papa, and a good deal
more, too, and then there was loud and long-continued
applause.
Papa. Yes, the speech seemed to please them. It was
what they'd all been thinking, you know, and when I said it
for them they cheered.
L. A. Yes, Papa. William thought it was a good speech,
too. He said, “Master did let 'em have it proper.”
Papa. You shouldn't listen to what a footman says.
L. A. I couldn't help it, Papa. He said it quite loud, you
know, the next morning in the breakfast-room, before you
came down. But he said he was a Liberal himself, and he
wasn't going to change.
Papa. Oh, he said that, did he?
L. A. Yes; and isn't Mr. Hopwood a Liberal too, Papa?
Papa. Yes, Hopwood's one of the worst Radicals I ever
met — not far short of a Socialist, I fancy.
L. A. Oh, Papa, don't say that. That would be too
terrible.
Papa. I'm afraid it’s true.
L. A. But, Papa, Mr. Hopwood was dining here only two
days ago.
Papa. Well, what if he was 2
L. A. And after dinner, Papa, when I came in to dessert,
you and Mr. Hopwood were talking, and Mr. Hopwood spoke
about reform and the land and unearned wealth and the
Budget, and you said there was a good deal to be said for it
from his point of view, and he'd put it very well.
Papa. Yes, I know; he'd argue the hind leg off a donkey.
L. A. I should like to see him do that, Papa. And then
you said the House of Lords wouldn't have it, and he said
you were trying to break up the Constitution; and you said,
Quite impossible.

L. A. But if they're such bad men, you oughtn't to give

the police and have them put in prison.
Papa. You think so, do you?
L. A. Yes Papa. They oughtn't to get off because they’re
rich men. You said yourself in that speech that the beauty
of the law was that it was the same for the rich as for the
poor.
Papa. So it is; but it won't hit Hopwood and Hammerton
for being Radicals.
How can you make
L. A. Well, all I can say is it ought to, if they're robbers
and disloyalists and all that. But perhaps you didn't mean
it, Papa. Perhaps you were joking.
Papa. Nothing of the sort.
L. A. Then you ought to tell the King about them and
their Government.
Papa. The King”
L. A. Yes, because I read the other day that the King
appoints the Government, so the King ought to know that
his Government are robbers.
Papa. Oh, the King knows all about them right enough.
L. A. Then I can't understand it. -
Papa. No, you can't ; and you'd better be off now. I'm busy.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-My hay-party went
with a bang, and was voted quite the
newest and prettiest function in town
this summer. I see the sincerest form
cropping up already in several direc-
tions. I commandeered Mayfair Square
for the occasion, and had ever so many
loads of hay brought up from the
country; I'm afraid it was a bit damp
—several people say they caught cold—
pigs' The dancing and supper mar-
quees were made like big barns, and
the cards I sent out were things of
sheer joy, with the dearest little crossed
rakes and pitchforks on them, i--
and “Come and make hay while
the moon shines.” We were all
en paysanne, of course, and as
the men are so obstinate about
dressing up I simply laid in a
big store of smock-frocks, and
made them put them on when
they came. Pompom and my
newest little darling (an Antarc-
tic spaniel, my dear, a dream
of doghood, with the sweetest,
weeniest leggy-legs') both wore
teeny smock-frocks, and every-
one was raving about the little
thingy-things.
The moon put in a disap-
pointing performance ; however,
we'd lots of lamps to support
her, and the rain kept off, for
that occasion only. I took care
to have all the proper rustic
dishes, syllabub, posset, junket,
as well as things people really
can eat and drink, and we did
country dances, and played kiss-
age, you know, when, as the Psalmist
says, “The grasshopper is a failure.”
Of course I managed to secure the
dear Empire Editors for dinner while
they were in London, and every one
said it was extremely well done. and
struck the right note, and all that sort
of thing. The menus were in the form
of proofs. There was “Consommé à la
Rédacteur” and “Soles à l'Imprimerie,”
and the chief dishes were called
“Leading Articles.” Of course I’d no
“canards" in the bill-of-fare, and no
“marrons glacés” among the sweets.
My own toilette was very carefully
thought out, its leitmotif being intellect :
—plain white satin, cut princesse, with
them said they’d never heard of any
views or ideas at all like them before
Wasn't it flattering 2
The most important piece of news
this season is that ears are out—quite,
and quite démodé. As SHAKSPEARE says,
“If you have ears, prepare to shed them
now,” or, if shedding them outright is
too diffy, at least hide them, for they're
most unpopular features just now—(by
the way, would ears be called features
or appliances 2)
Ears being out, it naturally follows
that voices are worn loud and screamy;
which reminds me of a little tragedietta
people are telling each other. You
must understand, to begin with, that
— — ——Winnie and Cuckoo Delamont
have been in the first flight of
the earless brigade (they both
have the typical Delamont ear
—an ear cbviously intended to
lead a very retired life!). The
Duchess of Dunstable, with these
two girls in tow, was one of the
most persistent of the maternal
sports, who, for a long time,
have been patiently stalking
Lord Orebright (rather a new
creation, but immensely pecu-
nious, my dear!). Well, whether
old Dunstable at last wore him
down, or whether he really did
begin to see more in Cuckoo than
anyone else has ever been able
to see, one can't say, but the
affair began to move and get
some way on it, and finally came
to a head at the Flummerys'
garden-party, where, it seems, he
proposed while he and Cuckoo
were sheltering from the rain
under some trees. Mrs. Jimmy

needle, and dancing-down-the-

do, even to saying “ee” and
“zee.” People brought their
own rakes and pitchforks, and

chic ; but mine were easily best—ivory
with silver teeth. Norty, who looked
awfully snappy in his smock-frock,
said he believed it was “alien hay.”
Wasn't it a shame? I said it wasn't,
but he persisted. He declares that
even our hay isn't made in England
| now ! For a touch of local colour I
had two cows put in a corner of
the square, to graze or chew, or what-
ever it is they do ; but unluckily one of
them ram at Aunt Goldie—(I'm not a
bit surprised; it only shows what a
lot of sense animals have ()—and she
fainted. Entre mous, my dear, she
looked most utterly and completely
ricky in a short, flowered skirt with
panniers, a sunbonnet, and buckled
shoes. Isn't it quaint that she should
care to come to a hay-party?—at her
no trimmings, and only diamonds for
ornaments. I felt perfectly at home
with the dear, clever things, for, you
know, literature and journalism are
quite a fad of mine, and I should
devote myself to them a good bit if
I could spare time from things that
matter more. I don't profess to be
among the “Got-theres,” or to be any-
thing, at present, but a “Not-yet; ”
still, some enormously kind things have
been said about two little signed articles
of mine, “What to Wear and What to
Say when Aeroplaning,” and “Ought
Young Girls to run without Blinkers or
not?” in The Sideglancer and The
Peeress.
I developed some of my views and
ideas about the Press of the Empire to
the dear Editors, and one or two of

Sharpe happened to be passing
behind them at the time, and
says she heard the offer made
in the most formal terms—“I
say, look here ! What d'you
say to you and me toddlin' to

if you are.” And that unlucky Cuckoo
had a heavy bunch of silk cherries over
one ear and a great chiffon chou in the
other, and never knew she’d had an
offer' She spoke immediately of some-
thing quite irrelevant, and young Ore-
bright thought he was refused; and

Clytie Wandollarbilt's fifth ! When the
story got round at last to the old Duchess,
I hear she tore her transformation, boxed
Cuckoo's peccant ears (there's a lot to
box in the Delamont ear!), and went to
bed for a week to do a rest-cure. The
two girls go everywhere now with their
ears severely unadorned and very much
in evidence; but too late! too late:
“After the stable-door is stolen—” you
know the proverb.

“WILL somebody give me a cigarette?”
said Myra, stretching out a hand.
“I fancy not,” I said, “Thomas and
I both feel that you are too young.”
“I don't really want one, but when
I'm locked up in the billiard-room with
two dumb men——”
“We were reflecting on our blessed
victory.”
“Were you thinking of Archie's cen-
tury or John's bowling’” -
“Neither, oddly enough. I was recall-

“It was a skier,” said Myra. “I
thought it was never coming down.
What did you think of all the time?”
“Everything. All my past life ſlashed
before my eyes. I saw again my happy
childhood's days, when I played inno-
cently in the-er—pantry. I saw myself
at school, sl—working. I saw * *
“Did you happen,” interrupted
Thomas, when we both thought he was
fast asleep, “to see yourself being badly
taken on by me at billiards?”
“Thomas, you're not properly awake,
old friend. I know that feeling. Turn over
on the other side and take a breath.”
Thomas rose and stretched himself, and
went over to the cue rack. “You should
have heard him siding about his blessed
billiards this morning,” he told Myra.
“I didn't side. I simply said that
anybody could beat Thomas. Do they
play billiards much at the Admiralty”
I should have thought the motion * >
“Take a cue. Myra will mark.”
“Iłather; I can mark like anything.”
“Once upon a time,” I said, “there
was a lad who wanted to go into the
Admiralty. But his mother said, ‘Not
until you have learnt to swim, Thomas.’
So he had a set of six private lessons for
one guinea before he went in for the
examination. He came out thirty-eighth,
and was offered a lucrative appointment
in the Post Office . . . Hence his enor-
mous skill at billiards. Thick or clear?”
“I will adventure half-a-crown upon
the game,” said Thomas, giving a miss.
Right O Rothschild. Now, are you
ready, marker? I'm spot. Hadn't you
better oil the board a bit? Well, as
long as you can work it quickly enough.”
I took careful aim, and my ball went
up the table and back again, with the
idea, I imagine, of inspecting the wicket.
It seemed quite fast.
“One º said Myra, and Thomas
kindly brought his ball and mine to the
top of the table.
“I fancy I shall be able to swerve
from this end,” I said. I tried a delicate
cannon, and just missed the object ball.
“I shall find a spot directly—there's one
under the red ball, I believe.”
“Do try and hit something,” said
Myra.
“The marker is not allowed to give
advice,” I said sternly. “What's the
matter, Thomas P’’ -
“I’m not quite sure what to do.”
“I think you ought to chalk your
cue here,” I said, after examining the
position.
“I’ve done that.”
“Then ram the red.”
Thomas rammed and all but sank it
in the leſt-hand pocket.
“I am now,” I said, “going to do a
cannon off the cushion. Marker, what
is my score ?”
“One, Sir.”
“Then kindly get ready to put it up to
three . . . Rotten luck.”
“Wrong side,” said Myra judicially.
“No, I meant to hit it that side.”
“I mean you wanted a little check
side.” i
“Hang it, this isn't chess. Go on,
Thomas.” - º
Thomas, who had been chalking his
cue, advanced to the table. “Hallo,” he
said, “where's the other ball ?”.
I looked at the table, and there were
only two balls on it ! .
“That's an extraordinary thing,” I
said in amazement; “I’m almost certain
we started with three.”

“Certainly not; I shouldn't dream of
doing such a thing. I don't say but
what I mayn't have slipped down my-
self when nobody was looking. Myra,
did you notice which pocket I was
trying for that time 2"
We felt in all of them and at last
found my ball in one of the bottom ones.
It must have gone there very quietly.
“Score, marker?” I asked confidently,
as I prepared to continue my break.
“Oh, you're going over the crease,”
cried Myra.
I took my ball back an inch.
you tell me the score ?” I said.
“STEVENSON (in play), three ; INMAN,
two. INMAN's two were both wides.”
Barely were the words out of her
mouth when INAIAN's score was increased
by a no-ball. A miss-cue they call it
technically.
“Three all,” said Myra. “This is
awfully exciting. First one is allead,
and then the other.”
“By the way, how many up are we
playing?”
“Five, aren't you ?” said Myra.
This roused Thomas. He had played
himself in and now proceeded to make a
pretty break of seventeen. I followed.
There was a collision off the middle
pocket between spot and red, and both
went down. Then plain was uninten-
tionally sunk as the result of a cannon
shot, and spot and red sailed into
harbour. With Thomas's miss I scored
“Will
eleven.
stroke Thomas again went down.
“Billiards,” he said.
“You don't think I want to put the
rotten thing down, do you? It's such
a blessed rabbit. Directly it sees a hole
anywhere it makes for it. Hallo, six
more. I shall now give what they call a
miss in baulk.”
“Oh, good miss,” cried Myra, as spot
rested over the middle pocket.
“That was a googly. You both
thought it would break the other way.”
The game went on slowly. When
Thomas was ninety and I was ninety-
nine there was a confused noise without,
and Archie and Miss Blair burst into
the room. At least only Archie actually
burst; Miss Blair entered sedately.
“Who’s winning 2 ” cried Archie.
“What an absurd question,” I said.
“As if we should tell you.”
“All right. Dahl–Miss Blair, have you
ever seen billiards played really well ?”
“Never.” . . . .
“Then now 's your chance. Ninety,
ninety-nine—they've only just begun.
This is Thomas's first break, I expect.
There—he's got a clear board. You
get five extra for that, and the other man
is rubiconed. Ninety-nine all. Now
it is only a question of who misses first.”
I put down my cue. . . . . . .
“Thomas,” I began, “we have said
some hard things about each other to-
night, but when I listen to Archie I feel
very friendly towards you.”
“Archibald,” said Thomas, “is a
beastly name.”
“So I told Miss Blair. For a man
who was, so to speak, born with a silver
billiard-table in his month, to come here
and make fun of two persevering and, in
my case, promising players, is—”
“You’ll never finish that sentence,”
said Myra. “Try some more billiards.”
“It was almost impossible to say what
I wanted to say grammatically,” I an-
swered, and I hit my ball very hard up
the table at the white . .
“It's working across,” said Archie,
after the second bounce; “it must hit
the red soon. I give it three more laps.”
“It’s going much more slowly now,”
said Miss Blair.
“Probably it's keeping a bit of a
sprint for the finish. Wait till it gets
its second wind . . . No, I'm afraid
it's no good ; it ought to have started
sooner. Hallo, yes, it's—— Got him '''
“It hasn't finished yet,” I said calmly.
“Look . . . there !”
“Jove,” said Archie, shaking my
hand, “that is the longest loser I've
ever seen. My dear old man, what a
performer. The practice you must have
had. The years you must have devoted
to the game. I wonder—could you
possibly spare an hour or two to-morrow |
to play cricket for us?” A. A. M.

And agreed to take you for a
Brother- (woe is me!)-in-law.
Collars always should be low.

Thinks they should be high, and so
Made a burden of my life;

And, whenas the foe is fled,
I will share the spoils of war,
And in peace and one-inch collars
Live at ease for evermore.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 28.
—Nothing more touching in modern
Parliamentary life than the relationship
between Irish Nationalists and Ulster
Members. Separated by the narrow
gulf of the Gangway they prove afresh
that blood is thicker than water. De-
monstrations of affection lose nothing
by reason of their spontaneity. Should
Captain CRAIG or WillIAM MooRE rise to
offer contribution to current enquiry
or debate, their brethren below the
Gangway instantly break forth in a
shout in which appreciation for intel-
lectual supremacy is mingled with note
of personal affection. On the other
hand, when a Nationalist Member speaks,
Ulster upliſts its voice in shrewd sugges-
tion designed to flash a clearer, more
kindly light on his purpose.
An instance forthcoming this after-
noon. It appears that Miss ColeNso
from her personal resources contributed
certain sums of money to the defence
of DiNizulu. For any person in any
quarter of the Empire to have associated
himself or herself with revolt against the
Crown suffices to secure sympathy of
Irish Nationalists. They suggest that
the Treasury should reimburse the lady.
UNDER-SECRETARY FOR ColoNIES, impreg-
nably polite, points out that the Govern-
| ment contributed out of the public purse
funds necessary for the defence of the
-
Pinornis ingens Ulstralis, or Mooa Bird
(found in North Armagh, otherwise extinct).

“IMPREGNAbly Polite.”
(Col. S-ly, D.S.O.)
Zulu Chief. They really cannot extend
their bounty to cover the case of Miss
CoLENSO. Irish Nationalists insist. SEELY
shakes his head.
It was here that Mr. MooRE stepped in
with suggestion calculated to meet diffi-
vulty.
“Will the UNDER-SECRETARY,” he
suavely asked, “consider the propriety
of obtaining a grant from the United
Irish League Fund for Miss ColeNso 2°
The consideration of the Nationalists
for the comfort and convenience of a
countryman from Ulster was forthwith
testified.
“Sit down! Sit down!” they shouted.
Parliamentary week only just com-
mencing. Mr. MooRE's remarks not
lengthy. They had, for example, fallen
short of the exposition of the Budget
which kept CHANCELLOR OF ExchEQUER
on his legs for four hours. Yet so
motherly in its tenderness is the con-
cern of the Southerners for the health
and comfort of a brother from the North
that they insisted, almost with turbu-
lence, upon his not endangering his
health by undue physical effort.
“Sit down Sit down ' " they roared
again. Having shot his dart, Mr. MooRE
obeyed injunction.
Business done.—Fourth night in Com-
mittee on Budget Bill. FITZALAN HoPE
propounds conundrum dealing with
property let on lease expiring at death
of the last survivor of three. A friend
of his holds such a lease, the remaining
life being that of a virgin of seventy.
“Now,” he said, fixing inquiring eye
on ChancELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, “what
formula has the right hon. gentleman
for establishing the exact relations be-
tween the value of the property and the
life of the old lady ?”
LLOYD-GEORGE moved the Closure.
Tuesday.—Transference of the MASTER
of ELIBANK from Lobby to Treasury
Bench on promotion to place vacated
by BUCHANAN deprives the House of a
useful and attractive study in deport-
ment. In addition to his duties as
Whip, FLIBANK was Comptroller of His
Majesty's Household. From time to
time it fell to his lot to bring messages
from a gracious Sovereign to the faith-
ful Commons. Arrayed in Court uni-
form, carrying the white wand of office,
he advanced to the Table with due
obeisance to the Chair. That compara-
tively easy. Where natural grace came
in was in the retreat, each step taken
backward with halt at the precise spot
proper for the thrice-made salutation.
Seems easy enough till tried. Many
a dauntless Admiral who has blithely
trod the quarter-deck in hours of danger,
and has subsequently been made Black
Rod, has been conscious of the fearsome
sinking of the heart that accompanies
this expedition. At least one in modern
times halted speechless at the Table.
MASTER of ELIBANK took to ceremony
from the first as a duckling takes to the
Water.

Under - Secretary for India, displayed
fresh qualities that compel esteem. Each
of the half-dozen enquiries on the paper,
for which he was prepared with written
answer, was followed by what is known
as a supplementary question. Other
Ministers, weakly yielding to pernicious
habit that sometimes leads to ruffled
temper and always involves unredeemed
waste of time, make answer. MASTER OF
ELIBANK, apparently unhearing, certainly
unheeding, stared vacantly into space as
if he were on the blasted heath (quota-
tion) once visited by Macbeth, also as it
happened charged with a batch of sup-
plementary questions. - - -
The querist sat dumbfoundered, star-
ing at the new Minister as if his silence
were due to sudden development of
trance. . Nothing happening, SPEAKER
called next question on paper; there fol-
lowed another supplementary question,
another glacial silence; next question
was: called, and so business briskly
proceeded. - - - - ..
Possibly this remarkable state of
things was due rather to necessity than
to deliberate design. Having been but
a day at the India Office, the UNDER-
SECRETARY could hardly be expected to
answer off-hand questions sprung upon
him as to the population of the Madras
Presidency, the code of regulations for
European schools in . Bengal, or the
domestic circumstances of “one Gulab
Bano,” alleged to have made short work
of her husband. . . . . - - -

HoRAtio? Deep down in the cellars of
bankers, public and private, there is
stored treasure in price far exceeding
what the deep unfathomed caves of ocean
bear. Bank-notes issued and never
presented; balances standing in the name
of men and women long since dead and
turned to clay; piled up securities repre-
senting hundreds of thousands of
pounds, not to mention brass-bound
boxes bursting with priceless jewels
and precious stones.
HoRATIO, if pressed, could name twelve
banks where there are secured at this
moment unclaimed securities worth two
million sterling. All this he proposes
to pour into the lap of CHANCELLOR of
ExchEQUER.
To that end brings in Bill compelling

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MUSIC IN EXCELSIS.
THE public-spirited announcement of
an eminent pianist that he proposes to
devote the proceeds of a concert to aero-
nautical purposes, has, we are glad to
learn, been fraught with wide-reaching
consequences throughout the entire
domain of the youngest of the Arts.
Turning to The Daily Bamberger of
last Saturday we are confronted with
the soul-shaking statement that Mr.
Bamberger, accompanied by his wife
and their triplets (Mozart Skibo
Bamberger, Beethoven Rockefeller Bam-
berger and Rosebery Glinka Bamberger),
will shortly start for Moscow, where it
is his intention to carry out a series of
experiments with a new flying grand
piano of his own invention. On calling
at the house of Sir Pompey Boldero, Mr.
Bamberger's father-in-law, our repre-
sentative was assured that the announce-
ment was only too true. But Sir Pompey,
who was deeply affected, added that he
had extracted a solemn pledge from his
son-in-law that he would never take his
wife with him on one of his flights, or
more than two-thirds of the triplets.
The object of the flying piano, the
amiable baronet went on to explain, was
to intimidate the Nihilists and Anarchists,
over whom Mr. Bamberger has long
exerted a remarkably sedative influence,
and when this aim has been accom-
plished he proposes to give a series of
cross-Channel recitals, in which the
audience will be attached in cars to the
legs of the piano. Further inquiries from
Sir Pompey elicited the interesting fact
that Mr. Bamberger intends to present to
the National Gallery a colossal equestrian
statue of himself, recently executed by
Professor Sir Hugo von Erkimer, for
which Mr. Frick, the famous Chicago
millionaire, vainly offered £100,000.
The Manager of the Crystal Palace
confirmed the report which had already
appeared in The Daily Gale, to the effect
that at the next Handel Festival all the
performers would sing from balloons or
aeroplanes. Madame CLARA BUTT, he
went on, had already commissioned the
firm of Boulger to build her a huge
dirigible, to be called The Hope and
Glory, in delicate compliment to Sir
EDWARD ELGAR's famous march tune.
The Manager added that it was intended
to lend realism to the performance of the
“Hailstone Chorus” by a discharge of
several million peas on to the heads of
the audience from the superincumbent
balloons.
A telegram from Bayreuth conveys
the welcome intelligence that, yielding
to the urgent appeals of Count ZEPPELIN,
Mr. WILBUR WRIGHT, Mr. LATILAM, and
others, Herr SIEGFRIED WAGNER has kindly
consented to re-write his father's early
opera, The Flying Dutchman, so as to
meet the requirements of modern aero-
nautical science. In the new versin
the special torment of Vanderdecken will
consist of his never being able to find a
proper garage for his airship. The
dramatis persona remain practically un-
altered, except that Senta becomes
Petrola—a very happy emendation—and
the famous Spinning Chorus is cleverly
adapted so as to suggest the whirring of
the engines of the airship.
M. PADEREwski, so we 'an from The
Warsaw Inven'or, a scientific periodical
of remarkable ability, has patented a
new form of musical parachute, con-
structed like a concertina, which plays
during the descent, and thus warns the
denizens of terra firma of the approach
of the aeronaut. Mr. SPENCER is much
struck with the invention, and thinks of

A FILLIP FOR FICTION.
[The following lines are supposed to repre-
sent an optimistic author's view of the proposal
to publish new novels at a shilling or even
sevenpence apiece]. - -
ALL the charms of all the Muses—
Plots to make you smile or weep,
Love that wins and love that loses—
Even now are fairly cheap : . .
Comic interludes or killings,
Tragic tears and knavish tricks,
Priced at half-a-dozen shillings
May be had for 4s. 6d.
Ah, but on your eager purses .
Come, we know, a thousand calls,
Charitable zeal amerces, -
So do cabs and music-halls;
Oft enough a decent dinner
Might be purchased with the sum
Authors ask you for the inner
Soundings of a cerebrum.
“Buy your books?” you argue; “no, Sir!
Waste our cash on works of art 2
Wherefore, when the nearest grocer
Keeps a fiction-lending mart?
When from bakers we can borrow
Tales that educate the home,
Tales of mirth and tales of sorrow,
Paying 2d. down per tome?”
That is why, to save our calling
(Never flush about the fob),
We've reduced our world-enthralling
Masterpieces to a bob:
Fancies of the fairest tissue,
Radiant as the evening star,
Publishers propose to issue
At the price of a cigar.
Then, perhaps, some Croesus, smitten
By the smart reviewer's mem.—
“Not since Waverley was written
Have we seen so rare a gem,”—
Rashly from his pocket raking
All the pence (the damage blown)
May secure that epoch-making
Novel for his very own.
THE HIGH ART OF WALKING.
The view expressed by Sir Victor:
HoRSLEY that swinging the arms while
walking is quite unnecessary has attracted
widespread attention in stockbroking
and other circles. We append a few of
the representative opinions elicited by
this momentous pronouncement.
Mr. H. A. Miles, of the Engineering
Department of the Post Office, writing
to The Daily Mail, observes that a rapid
walker uses his arms in the same way as
a greyhound uses its tail.
The PoET LAUREATE lays no claim to
be considered an authority on pedestrian
progress. “A poet,” he remarks, “can
not altogether dispense with feet, and, if
he is a patriot, must be prepared to use
his arms, or, to be more precise, his
barrels. Personally, in moments of
lyrical ecstasy I am only conscious of
wings.”
Mr. STEPHEN Col.FRIDGE, in a genial
interview, expressed full concurrence
with Sir WICTOR. Personally, however,
he was inclined to go a good deal further.
It was not merely the swinging of the
arms that was unnecessary while walk-
ing, but the arms themselves. People
did not walk with their arms unless
they were acrobats. The great object
in locomotion was to carry as little
weight as possible, and for fast walking
the best thing was to remove the arms
altogether by a surgical operation.
Miss ORDE MALAN, the renowned votary
of Terpsichore, strongly dissents from
the view of the illustrious specialist.
Rapid walking is of the essence of danc-
ing, and dancing without the serpentime.
arm ripple is unthinkable. Miss MALAN's
view is also supported by Mlle. KARSA-
VINA, the famous Russian ballerina now
performing at the Coliseum, by Mr.
PéLissil:R and Inspector JARVIs. As the
Inspector put it, “The Venus of Milo may
have been armless, but it seems impos-
sible for a modern woman to advance
rapidly without swinging the arms,”
and here he rubbed his ear ruefully. . .
Mr. BERNARD SHAw writes to say that
the connection of arms and the man is
not essential, but only dramatic. Thé
most famous statue of Victory, he adds,
was wingless. :
“Lucas Malet,” the illustrious author
of Sir Richard Calmady, gives it as her
opinion that if, as she has herself
triumphantly shown, a legless baronet
can be a hero of romance there is no
reason why an armless stockbroker
should not win the annual walk to
Brighton.

“THEy've etten the maist of the wuts in a neet,” said
old Mr. Whinnery, referring to the slugs, and the common
bookworm will easily devour The Story of Hauksgarth
Farm (SMITH, EIDER) in that time. Its scenes are laid on
the Lancashire and Westmoreland border (the Red Rose
shire, by the way, is rather low down in the county fiction
championship just now), and EMMA BROOKE has depicted
them remarkably well. There is no great subtlety about
the plot, or the characters either, but I feel so absolutely
certain that they really lived on a real farm (not a literary
nor even a newspaper model), and that the farm was exactly
where the authoress puts it, that I am glad the date is 1830
or thereabouts, so that nobody is likely to prove me wrong.
Silver Whinnery was brought up in the same home with
Silence and Nanna, neither of whom was related to him by
blood, and having quarrelled with his father went to sea:

loved, was gone, and concluding that she was married, he

| characters for their stories.
The writer, who calls herself
“Handasyde,” has exhumed Lord GEORGE BENTINCK for the
purposes of Other Things than Love (HUTCHINSON), and pro-
jected him into an era of motor-cars and modern Tariff
Reform. So little, indeed, has she troubled to veil her
necromancy, that she only alters the name of the horse with
which Lord GeoRGE would have won the Derby in 1848 (if
he hadn't sold his stud) from Surplice to Surface. When
the book opens, its hero, having just lost his wife, decides to
devote the remainder of his life to the cause of Protection,
and, considering the title of the story, it might fairly have
been expected to be entirely political. As a matter of fact,
however, it deals with the gradual consolation of Lord GEORGE
by the one infallible remedy known to romance. There are
some cleverly drawn characters, notably those of Sinclair of
Sinclair and his daughter Betty, who is charming; but the
self-made man to whom the heroine is at first engaged is far
too much of a bounder. I must be permitted to hope that
Lord Gee-Gee (as his friends called him), having found that
he could love again, also repurchased his stud, and won the
Blue Riband of the Turf in course of time, with, let us say,
Top Dressing III.
I do not think that the anxiety
Silence, as her name implies,
was as good as gold, but Namma
could have spared an ‘n’ from
the middle of her praenomen
without loss to her reputation.
So when she came back there
was naturally trouble, or “sic a
scrowe as niver,” perhaps I
should have said. The sequel
is thoroughly exciting and ro-
mantic in the best sense. Two

Ifancy that when Miss SHEILA
KAYE-Smith set out to write
Starbrace (GEORGE BELL) she was
actuated, in part at least, by -
a wish to describe the eighteenth-century high tobyman in
his habit as he really lived, and stripped of that romance
with which the foolish chroniclers of a later age have loved
to invest him. For the better attainment of that end, I can
see her at pains to make such a study of the idiom of the
class and time as should secure at least accuracy of con-
versation. The result is interesting, if a little overwhelming.
When one of Miss KAYE-SMITH's ruffians observes to another,
“The lad's a rum cull; let's keep our snappers and gaffs for
the hornies, and hop a flash wag on the road,” most readers
will incline to wish that she had supplied her book with a
glossary. This, however, is but a slight defect in an
unusually clever tale. In many ways indeed this story of
the lad Miles Starbrace, driven to the Road by circumstance
and by the tragedy of his own warped character, half animal,
half child, is a remarkable piece of work, one that for a
beginner in the novelist's art seems to me extraordinary.
! The last chapters especially are haunting in the poignancy
of their analysis. I |. know how Miss KAYE-SMITH can
have endured the writing of them, and I am not at all sure
that I owe her any gratitude for having done so. Powerfu
the book undeniably is, but I hope that next time the author
will devote her strength to some less pitiable theme.

THE DETACHMENT OF PRENDERBY.
THE LAND CLAUSEs or THE BUDGET.
I Fot ND him seated in an exquisite Louis Quinze chair,
absorbed in contemplation of one of the many masterpieces
of art which adorn his spacious chambers.
“And what do you think of the Land Clauses of the
Budget 13ill 2 " I asked.
“I thank Heaven,” said Prenderby, “that I had the good
sense, years ago, to sell my land, and spend the proceeds
upon the works of great artists. Happily LLOYD-GEORGE
doesn't bear the same resentment to an Old Master as he
bears to what is known as real estate. If he did. I should
now have the prospect of paying separate and distinct taxes
on the canvas of my pictures; on their materials—oil or
water colour; on their foregrounds, their backgrounds, their
middle distances; on their figures, human or animal; on
their frames; on the wall-space they occupy. As it is,
they are exempt from all taxation in my lifetime ; and
meanwhile I could sell them to-day at an enormous profit,
especially if I wrote to the papers and appealed to the public's
patriotism to prevent their going abroad. And all this
unearned increment is due to the efforts of the community.”
“But I don't see,” said I, “what the community has got
to do with it. It is the result of your own cleverness of
selection.”
“No more, or very little more, than if I had selected a
piece of land in a neighbourhood which gave promise of
improvement. The intrinsic worth of my pictures remains
where it was. It is the taste of the community that gives
them their enhanced market-value; just as the taste of the
community might, by the erection of a sausage factory in a
rustic suburb, enhance the value of my neighbouring land as
a site for artisans' villas. Perhaps I needed a shade more
intelligence in the case of my pictures, but only a shade.”
“Anyhow,” I argued, “you have sunk your talents in a
napkin ; your pictures yield you no interest.”
“On the contrary,” replied Prenderby, “they yield me a
well-secured interest of at least five per cent. in the form of
luxury—the pure joy I get from regarding them. And I
pay no income-tax on that.”
“ Still,” I said, “ your sophistries will never persuade me
that land has not got a special claim to taxation. There's
something peculiar about land.”
“There is, indeed,” he said.
move it.”
“That's my point,” I cried triumphantly. “Land is the
country itself; and the nation is its only rightful owner.
I'm a bit of a Socialist on this subject.”
“But it already exercises the rights of ownership,” replied
Prenderby. “ Apart from existing rates and taxes for which
this particular class of property is selected, the community
reserves to itself the privilege of running railroads and new
streets across your land, and chopping it up into allotments.
It doesn't do that kind of thing with other forms of property
--your furniture, for example. It doesn't give the pro-
letariat the run of your bath, or commandeer your grand
piano to serve as panelling for its municipal slaughter-
houses.”
“Dear Prenderby,” I said, with a touch of pity, “I am
sorry that a person of your gifts should not yet have been
emancipated from the old feudal spirit.”
“‘The old feudal spirit?’ Ah, there you touch the Higher
Socialism,” he replied, in what I carelessly assumed to be his
best vein of paradox. “Let the State,” he continued,
“instead of levying fresh pecuniary burdens on the land,
demand feudal service–military service—of every man that
holds its soil in fief, and we shall be taking one right step
backwards in the direction of national self-respect.”
“This is a free country,” I said, but not very assertively.
“For one thing, you can't
“It is nothing of the sort,” snapped Prenderby, “ or you,
for one, wouldn't be paying taxes on anything.
“I should pay them voluntarily,” I said, but without
conviction. -
A touch of affectionate anxiety betrayed itself in Prenderby's
eye. “You have been overworking,” he said. “You should
see a brain-doctor and take a rest-cure.”
“You think,” I said, “to distract my attention from the
weakness of your arguments by an affectation of solicitude
for my health. But I ignore your red herrings. Let us get
back to the land.” - -
“We shall be the only people there, if we stay long
enough,” said Prenderby. “But, to be serious—— ”
“Do I understand that we have been having humour up
to this point ’’’ . - . - -
“Humour,” replied Prenderby, “is like Truth; it takes
two for its achievement—one to speak and one to hear.”
“Well, try being serious,” I said.
“To be serious,” resumed Prenderby, “you said just now
that there is something peculiar about land, and I agreed
with you. For one thing, I said, you can't move it. For
another thing it is a form of property which, more than most
luxuries, demands the employment of labour. Even a
pronounced Free Trader like yourself would be permitted
to encourage this form of Home Industry.” -
“Go on,” I said, “don’t mind me.”
“Well, if you must treat the owner of land as if he were a
moral pest, why not make allowance for his redeeming quali-
ties, and let him have a rebate on every labourer he employs '' |

“Is that your own idea 2 " I asked.

sation with a soldier who thinks.”
“‘A soldier who thinks ' ' " I exclaimed. “What business
has he to do that? Why doesn't he stick to his soldiering 2"
“Because he has mone to stick to,” replied Prenderby.
“He happens to be one of those keen and distinguished
soldiers to whom the War Oſlice is just now giving a rest.
This leaves him leisure for thinking out other things.”
“I am not sure,” said I, “that Mr. HALDANE would approve
of your friend's line of thought if it came to his ears.
Anyhow, I can't take two of you on single-handed. Perhaps
I’d better go off and consult a sailor.”
“Try Ch.ARLIE BERESFORD,” said Prenderby ; “I hear he's
at large. And the Admiralty might be glad for him to have
a little quiet occupation—something connected with theories
about the land, instead of the sea.” O. S.

Still she was silent, and he groaned in sheer despair.

Salesman. “Yes, SIR.
But, ON THE OTHER HAND, TRADE IN GARDEN-Hose is Absolutely AT A STANDSTILL.”
SCOTTISH SUPERIORITY.
The MYSTERY SOLVED.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Have you ever
brought your massive intellect to bear
on the solution of that eternal riddle—
Why do Scotsmen always succeed? I
think I have discovered the clue in a
question which was put in the House of
Commons last week – on Monday the
5th, to be precise:–
“Sir John Jardine asked, as regards the
incidence of the increment tax on land feued
in superiorities in Scotland, whether the tax
would become exigible under the Finance Bill
from the date of sale by a vassal or only after
the feu had ceased to be full and infeftment had
taken place, and whether it would be exigible
on an intermediate sale by the purchaser from
the vassal and before any infeftment.”
People have a stupid way of askin
from time to time, “Stands sj
where she did?” My answer is, “Of
course she does, and, if possible, more
so,” and I think. no reasonable person
can possibly dissent after this soul-
shaking question of Sir John JARDINE’s.
In the first place it is the only division
of the United Kingdom in which superior
vassals exist. But above and beyond
all it is in Scotland and in Scotland
alone that infeftment takes place, and I
have no hesitation in ascribing the
extraordinary talent for success shown
by the Scot, as compared with the
Englishman, the Irishman, or the Welsh-
man, to his enjoyment of this unique
advantage. The Englishman has some
great qualities—solidity, doggedness,
reserve—but he is never lifted to the
higher plane of achievement which
results from that magic process. And
so with the nimbler Western Gael. You
have only to look at the Houses of
Parliament to realize the difference.
For example, what is it that lends fas-
cination to the discourses of Mr. WEIR
on immature fish? Infeftment. What
enables Lord PENTLAND to hold the
gilded chamber in the hollow of his
hand? Infeftment, and nothing else.
To define this extraordinary and mag-
netic quality is no easy task. It is
implicit in the “superiorities” of Scot-
land. But unless and until the Southron
contrives to inoculate himself with it he
will always fight a losing battle in every
walk of life with the unconquerable,
because infefted, Scot.
Infeftionally yours,
A WEAKER WASSAL.

statistics have caused a painful sensation
throughout the States. It had been
hoped that the average would be well

two persons were killed, six seriously
and fifty slightly injured. New York is
certainly the second biggest city in the
world, and this grudging attitude on the
part of her citizens, this disinclination
to offer an adequate annual tribute to
the Goddess of Liberty, can only be
regarded as a sign of decadence and
degeneracy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RABBITS.
CHAPTER IV.-A FEW WIRES.
A HUNDRED and eighty for mone.
The umpire waved his lily hand, and
the scorer entered one more “four "
in his book. Seeing that the ball had
gone right through a bicycle which was
leaning up against the pavilion, many
people (the owner of the bicycle, any:
how) must have felt that the actual
signalling of a boundary was unneces-
sary; but our umpire is a stickler for
the etiquette of the game. Once
when—— But no; on second thoughts,
I shan't tell you that story. You would
say it was a lie—as indeed it is.
“Rotten,” said Archie to me, as we
crossed over. (A good captain always
confides in his wicket-keeper.)
“Don’t take Simpson off,” I said. “I
like watching him.”
“I shall go on again myself soon.”
“Oh, it's not so bad as that. Don't
lose heart.”
The score was two hundred when we
met again.
“I once read a book by a lady,” I
said, “in which the hero started the
over with his right hand and finished it
with his left. I suppose Simpson couldn't
do that?”
“He’s a darned rotten bowler, any-
way.”
“His direction is all right, but his
metre is so irregular.”
At the end of the next over, “What
shall I do?” asked Archie, in despair.
“Put the wicket-keeper on,” I said at
Once.
The idea was quite a new one to him.
He considered it for a moment.
“Can you bowl?” he said at last.
“No.”
“Then what on earth —'
“Look here; you’ve tried 'em with
people who can bowl and they've made
two hundred and twenty in an hour and
a half; somebody who can't bowl will
be a little change for them. That's one
reason. The second is that we shall all
have a bit of a rest while I’m taking my
things off. The third is that I bet Myra
a shilling * x
Archie knelt down and began to un-
buckle my pads. “I’ll keep ’ myself,”
he said. “Are you fast or slow 2"
“I haven't the faintest idea. Just as
it occurs to me at the moment, I expect.”
“Well, you're quite right; you can't
be worse than some of us. Will you
have a few balls down first 2 ''
“No, thanks; I should like to come as
a surprise to them.”
“Well, pitch 'em up anyhow.”
“I shall probably vary my length—if
possible without any alteration of
action.”
I am now approaching the incredible.
The gentle reader, however (the bois-
terous reader also for that matter), is
requested to touch wood with one hand
and to listen very carefully with the
other to what follows. When he has
heard my explanation he will perhaps
understand.
Bowling is entirely a question of when
you let go of the ball. If you let go too
soon the result is a wide over the bats-
man's head; if too late, a masty crack on
your own foot. Obviously there are
spaces in between. By the law of
averages one must let go at the right
moment at least once. Why not then
at the first ball? And in the case of a
person like myself, who has a very high
action and a good mouth–I mean who
has a very high delivery, such a ball
(after a week of Simpsons and Archies)
would be almost unplayable.
Very well, then ; I did let go at
the right moment, but unfortunately I
took off from the wrong crease. The
umpire's cry of “No-ball” and the
shattering of the Quidnunc's wicket
occurred simultaneously.
“Good ball,” said Archie. “Oh, bad
luck! ”
I tried to look as though, on the whole,
I preferred it that way—as being ulti-
mately more likely to inspire terror in
the batsman at my end. Certainly it
gave me confidence; made me over-con-
fident, in fact, so that I held on to the
next ball much too long, and it started
bouncing almost at once.
The Quidnunc, who was convinced by
this that he had been merely having
a go at the previous ball, shouldered his
bat and sneered at it. He was still
sneering when it came in very quickly
and took the bottom of the leg stump.
(Finger spin, chiefly.)
Archie walked up slowly and gazed
at me.
“Well?” I said jauntily.
“No, don't speak. I just want to
look, and look, and look. It's wonderful.
No elastic up the sleeve, or anything.”
“This is where it first pitched,” said
the Major as he examined the ground.
“Did you think of letting in a brass
tablet?” I asked shortly.
“He is quite a young man,” went on
Archie dreamily, “and does not care to
speak about his plans for the future.
But he is of opinion that : ,
“Break, break, break,” said Simpson.
“Three altogether.”
“Look here, is there anybody else
who wants to say anything? No? Then
I'll go on with my over.”
Archie, who had begun to walk back
to his place, returned thoughtfully to
Ille.
“I just wanted to say, old chap, that
if you're writing home to-night about it
you might remember me to your people.”
J}lair was about the only person who
didn't insult me. This was because
he had been fielding long-on ; and as
soon as the wicket fell he moved
round about fifty yards to talk to Miss
Fortescue. What people can see in
her Well, directly my next ball
was bowled, he started running as hard
as he could to square leg, and brought off
one of the finest catches I’ve ever seen.
“The old square-leg trap,” said Archie.
“But you cut it rather fine, didn't
you? I suppose you knew he was a
sprinter.” *
“I didn't cut it at all—I was bowl-
ing. Go away.” -
Yes, I confess it.
trick. It was a good length half volley,
and the batsman, who had watched my
first three balls, was palpably nervous.
Archie walked round and round me in
silence for some time, and then went
over to Thomas.
“He’s playing tennis with me this
evening,” he began.
“I played billiards with him last
night,” said Thomas proudly.
“He’s going to let me call him by his
Christian name.”
“They say he's an awfully goºd chap
when you know him,” replied Thomas.
I got another wicket with the last ball
of the over, and then we had lunch.
Myra was smiling all over her face when
we came in, but beyond a “Well
bowled, Walter” (which I believe to be
BREARLEY's name) would have nothing
to do with me. Instead she seized
Archie, and talked long and eagerly to
º And they both laughed a good
Cill.
“Arkwright,” I heard Archie say at
the end. “IIe's sure to be there and
would do it like a shot.”
Like a wise captain Archie did not
put me on after lunch, and Simpson
soon began to have the tail in difficulties.
Just aſter the eighth wicket fell a telegram
came out. Archie took it, and handed
it to me. “From MACLAREN, I expect,”
he said with a grim.
“You funny ass; I happen to know
it's from Dick. I asked him for a wire
about the Kent match.” -
“Oh, did Kent win 2 ” said Archie,
looking over my shoulder. As I opened
it the others came up, and I read—
“Please be in attendance for vert
Test Match.-HAwRE.”
+ + + + +
I got three more that afternoon. One
from FRY, one from LEVEson-Gowen, and
one from MACLAREN. They all came from
Lord's, and I’ve half a mind to take my
telegrams with me and go. Then Myra
would probably get six months in the
second division.
“I shouldn't mind that,” said Myra:
“You could easily bowl—I mean bail
nie out.”

cRoss-ExAMINATIONs For THE Home;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's Road To KNowlFDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; Uncle John—Captain John Lambert,
late 28th Hussars—aged 44.)
Little Arthur. What were you talking about to yourself,
Uncle John, when I came in just now *
Uncle John. Singing a bit of a hymn, wasn't I?
L. A. No, Uncle John, I don't think it was a hymn.
U.J. Sort of hymn, I think, wasn't it 2
L. A. Well, Uncle, it wasn't like any hymn I've ever heard.
U. J. Wasn't it, old man 2. But perhaps you don't under-
stand my way of singing 'em.
L. A. I don't think it was that, Uncle John. And, besides,
you weren't singing at all. -
U.J. That's just it: everybody says that about my sing-
ing. It's not having an ear that does it.
L. A. Oh, but, Uncle, I've heard you sing splendidly :
and Mamma says you used to sing Tom Bowling and
Sally in our Alley so as to make people cry.
U. J. Ah, well, that was long ago. I've lost the hang of
it now. It's the hard liſe I’ve had that's driven it out.
L. A. But, Uncle, when you said that to Papa the other
day he said it wasn't the hard life but the hard living that
had bowled you over. Papa thought that was funny, because
he laughed.
U.J. So he did; but then your father and I never quite
agreed about jokes.
L. A. No, Uncle; and I don't always agree with Papa
about jokes myself.
U.J. The deuce you don't ; but you ought to, you know.
Must respect your father's jokes, Arty, or things 'll happen
to you.
L. A. Well, Uncle, if you think so I'll try. But what
was it you were talking about when I came in 2
U.J. Can't think, old man. What did it sound like?
L. A. Well, you'd got a pencil in your hand, and a bit of
paper-there it is—on the table in front of you, and you
were saying that Bandersnatch had been forced up far beyond
his proper price and he was a wrong 'un anyhow, and if
French Mustard got home you'd paint the town red.
U. J. Oh, I said that, did I? Funny thing I should be
talking to myself, but I was always the boy for doing sums
out loud. Comes easier, you know.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, it does; but it didn't sound like sums.
I haven't got Bandersnatch or French Mustard in my arith-
metic book.
U. J. Ah, but you ought to have. If a Bandersnatch and
a half can eat one pint of French Mustard in a week, how
many gallons of beer will a Dutchman drink in a fortnight?
That's rule of three.
L. A. Well, it's not like my rule of three; but I'll try to
work it out if you like, Uncle.
U. J. I wouldn't worry about it, Arty. It's a regular
teaser, and I’m not dead sure I know the answer myself.
However, if you'll promise not to let it go any further, I'll
tell you a secret. They're horses.
L. A. Who are horses, Uncle?
U.J. Bandersnatch and French Mustard; and very dis-
appointing horses I'm afraid they'll turn out.
L. A. (in a tone of great pain). Oh, Uncle John Then
you were betting !
U. J. No, Sonny, not at that precise moment. Just
running through my book to see how I stood.
L. A. But does that mean that you do bet sometimes,
Uncle?
U. J. An occasional sixpence, old man—never more.
L. A. But why do you do it, Uncle?
U. J. Born so, I expect.
L. A. But may I bet, too, Uncle?
U.J. Certainly not, you young dog.

L. A. I don't know what pencillers are, but Mamma says
betting is a great curse.
U. J. And she's dead right.
L. A. But if you think she's dead right, Uncle, you
oughtn't to bet yourself, ought you ? -
U.J. Oh, I don’t know. I don't think I could quite make
a habit of not betting. Only sixpence, Arty. Hardly counts,
you know.

L. A. No, Uncle, she didn't say anything about monkeys.

woman I knew.

“The Daily Chronicle '' and “Mr. Punch.”
UNDER the heading, “Mr. Punch Nods,” our friend, The
Daily Chronicle, falls foul of the frontispiece to our new
volume. “Mr. Punch, like many others,” says The Chronicle,
“has not looked at the Budget Bill or read the debate, or he
would have known that gardens such as he shows are exempt
from taxation, however valuable the plot may be. So that
the notice ought to read : " This land reserved as an open
space by reason of Lloyd George's Budget.’”
Mr. Punch, like many others, has no idea what the last
sentence means; but he has a large heart, and will be glad
to reserve a wide open space in it for a class deserving of
great pity—those, to wit (if any), who are likely to be im-
posed upon by this statement of The Chronicle. For himself,
he is content to take Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE at his own words,
without the assistance of an interpreter. And Mr. GEORGE
has very plainly and cynically told us that all pleasure
gardens (one skimpy acre only being exempted) must either be
sold for building purposes, as not being at present used “to
the best advantage”; or thrown open to the public; or pay
an annual penalty of d. in the pound on its capital value.
Mr. Punch does not “mod” to this; on the contrary, he
shakes his head at it by way of vigilant protest.

THE DOGS PAGEANT.
EveRY dog used to have his day, but
now that His MAJESTY has made our
Toby Sir Toby, every dog thinks he
ought to have his knight too, and eke
his pageant. And why not?
For dogs are not what they were.
Dogs have become not only characters
in novels, as readers of Mr. GALsworthy
know, but characters in plays too, as
Mr. LAURENCE IRWING is now showing;
and only a week or so ago the sum of
£5,000 was refused for a Pekin toy
spaniel. This being the case, a dogs'
pageant is not only right but necessary,
and we are glad to be able to announce
that the preparations for such a spectacle
are now in full swing.
The Dogs’ Pageant, under the super-
vision of Mr. Louis N. BARKER, will be
held at Battersea during the Dog Days.
Among the patrons are Sir H. W. LUCY,
Sir E. J. Poynter, Mr. OTTO BEIT, and
Mr. MUIRHEAD BONE.
The first tableau will represent the
greation of the dog. According to the old
legend, the want of a dog being felt, the
other animals were invited to contribute
to his making. Man gave responsibility,
woman affection, the lion courage, the
deer swiftness, the monkey mischief,
and the tree bark. (Help!) Anyhow,
the dog emerged, and the world was
complete. Tableau I. will illustrate this.
Tableau II. shows the dog as the
friend of man. Burglars stealthily ap-
proach man's house, and the dog warns
him. Man is overcome by the snow, and
the dog saves him. Man falls into the
water (it is hoped that the Sage of
Battersea, Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON, will
undertake this part), and the dog pulls
him to land.
Tableau III. illustrates the dog as the
ally of man. Man hunts the fox and the
dog kills it. Man shoots the partridge
and the dog retrieves it. (Song: “Dare
to be a spaniel.”) Man is molested by
rats and the dog catches them. Man
would fain eat roast beef, and the dog
turns the spit. Man desires a pair of
gloves, and the dog dies near a tannery.
Tableau IV. is dangerous, but the
Committee hopes for the best. Here we
see Sir WICTOR HoRSLEY and the Hon.
STEPHEN Col.FRIDGE in conflict over a
terrier. The contest is very spirited
and Mr. Louis N. BARKER has surpassed
himself in the dialogue; but it is recog-
nised that trouble may ensue.
Tableau V. is the most impressive.
All the famous characters of history who
have had dogs will march past, leading
them. No AH (with two), ALCIBLADEs,
LEAR, King CHARLEs, the Duke of MARL-
BOROUGH, CowPER with Beau, Mrs. BROWN-
ING with Flush, BISMARCK, MATTHEw

THE NEW PHILANTHROPY.
WE are assured on unimpeachable
authority that it is true that a gentle-
man, whose name is widely known to
the public, has intimated his willing-
ness to contribute £10,000,000 towards
the rebuilding of our ſleet. It will be
remembered that, when the announce-
ment was first made, it was accompanied
by the statement that certain prelimi-
naries were under discussion. It now
transpires that the superb offer of this
patriotic and munificent millionaire is
attended by only one single condition—
viz., that fifty other individuals should
each contribute the same sum in the
course of the next fortnight.
The announcement that an anonymous
benefactor had offered £2,000,000 yearly
to provide pay for the rank and file of
the Territorial Army seemed almost too
good to be true. On inquiry at the War
Office, however, it turns out to be per-
fectly accurate. The offer had un-
doubtedly been made, but certain con-
ditions were attached to it, as, for
example, that no Territorial would be
eligible unless he were (1) a vegetarian,
(2) a Tolstoyan. The War Office autho-
rities declined to divulge the name of
the gentleman, but they added that, as
a result of careful investigations, they
had satisfied themselves that his income
was as much as £150 a year.
The name of the heroic philanthropist
who proposes to devote £5,000,000 to
the erection and endowment of a National
School of Dancing is Commodore Gillow-
son. His princely gift is hedged about
by only one stipulation—that the founda-
tion stone is not to be laid until Com-
modore Gillowson has been appointed
First Lord of the Admiralty and
Colonel MAPLESON Secretary of State for
War.
In spite of all attempts to preserve his
anonymity, the name of the splendidly
generous philanthropist who has sub-
scribed £200,000 to provide all the in-
habitants of the Grand Sahara with
niblicks has become public property.
It is, as was generally apprehended,
none other than our old friend ANDREW
CARNEGIE. No conditions accompany the
gift, except the negligible one that the
ratepayers of Timbuctoo shall contribute
to the upkeep of a Temple of Arbitra-
tion, with Free Library attached, on the
banks of Lake Tchad.

Exth Acted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 5.-
To quit the House of Commons, cross
the corridor that parts and joins the two
Chambers, and enter the House of Lords,
is like passing out of the noisy street
into the holy calm of Westminster Abbey.
There is this further similarity. In the
Abbey only a small proportion of con-
gregation can hear what is said in the
pulpit. Proportion in Lords that enjoys
like advantage is probably a trifle
smaller. But what would you? As in
Cathedral, outer rim of congregation
feel assured that right thing is being
said in proper words. Never mind a
lapsed syllable, a sentence murmured
into the confidence of the bosom of the
noble lord on his legs.
This afternoon House almost bustling.
Business lasted full hour less five
minutes. EBURY had question on paper
relating to operation of Small Holdings

Lords are peculiar and expansive. Com-
plaint sometimes made in Commons of

House just up. Sat continuously for
thirteen hours. Twelve devoted to Com-

legislators struggling forth to greet the
blushing morn comes STANLEY WILSON.
Others fight for the few cabs about

one, button up their coats, hoist their
umbrellas, and trudge home through
sloppy streets under wet skies. STANLEY,

more or less rele-
vant observations.

CALDWELL, doggedly wakeful in the
Chair, accepting Closure, righteous in-
dignation was turned upon him. On the
stroke of 3 A.M. STANLEY ordered a new
Chairman as, being at supper, he might
have asked for a fresh poached egg or
another grilled bone.
“Get a new Chairman,” he com-
manded.
As there happened not to be one at
hand, Mr. CALDwell, retained his situa-
tion. Observing this, STANLEY fell back
upon his familiar observation.
“Scand’less | Scand’less " " he cried
aloud, smitten to the heart with indig-
nant sorrow that such things should be
in the home of the Mother of Parlia-
ments.
Business dome.—After all-night sitting,
Committee turns to again at Budget
Bill. Still engaged on Clause 2.
Thursday.—HENRY Cotton, Knight of
the Star of India, rather looked forward
to a good week. Scraped up a lot of
tittle-tattle designed to show that the
men who hold India for the Empire,
meanwhile bestowing sedulous care on
the welfare of its teeming population, are

cowardly motives. Strung lotchpotch
together in series of five questions
which, subdivided, made aggregate of
ten. What a time he would have to be
sure, with MACKARNEss, RUTHERFORD and
Robertson cheering, LUPTON at minute-

. After these things were printed at
public expense and circulated with Par-
liamentary Papers came the grim tragedy
at the Imperial Institute. A man who
had given all his thought through the
best years of his life to the service of
the natives of India was struck down
by the hand of a sympathiser with the
clientèle of certain hon. gentlemen below
the Gangway. There are some points
at which even a Chatterjee is halted.
With the unburied body of CURZON
WYLLIE lying in the bereaved home, it
was perhaps just as well to postpone
enquiry into the case of GANESH DAMoDAR
SAVARKAR, sentenced to transportation for
publishing matter which found its
logical issue in the murder of a harm-
less man; and to leave for more con-
venient season lament on the treatment
of ACHYUT BALwant Kolhatkar for cir-
culation of seditious utterances. So when
the string of questions was reached
CoTTON made no sign, and they were

SCENE–Smoking compartment between a

First Man (to the man in the corner).
Do you mind if I open the window a
little? !
Second Man. Not in the least.
Third Man. Ah! that's better. It
was getting very close. -
. First Man. Ten passengers all smok-
ing make it rather close, don't they?
. Fourth Man (with a commanding eye,
who, looks, at every one as he speaks).
Fresh air 's a very good thing—if you
don't have too much of it. Ha, ha!
- - [Laughter.
Third Man. Extraordinary how quickly
a current of air becomes a draught.
First Man. Yes, indeed.
Sixth Man. Some people don't mind
draughts; and some are so sensitive to
them that to be in one is a misery.
[Looks amaciously at the window.
Fifth Man (on the seat back to the
engine). Well, draughts don't hurt me.
A current of air's a good thing, I say.
Fourth Man. Yes—if you don't have
too much of it. Ha, ha!
- [Laughter again.
Sixth Man. Perhaps as you don't
mind a draught you wouldn't object to
change places with me?
Fifth Man. Delighted, I'm sure, only
riding with my face to the engine
always makes me feel sick.
Sixth Man. That's very strange. I
thought it was riding back to the engine
that had that effect.
Fifth Man. Ah, yes, I believe it is so
with ordinary people; but not with me.
I'm very peculiar in many ways.
Sirth Man. I wonder if we have had
enough fresh air for the moment?
Fourth Man. Enough is as good as a
feast, they say. Ha, ha! |Laughter.
Sixth Man. At any rate I think we
might have the window up a little now.
Say three inches. No need to have our
heads blown off, is there? .
[Feeble laughter from the more kindly
assengers. - -
Third Man. Well, what I say is, fresh
air is the best friend of man. Get all
the air you can and you'll live long and
die happy.
Fourth Man. Yes, of course; but one
mustn't live too long, you know—mustn't
be a nuisance to one's friends, and all
that. Ha, ha! [Laughter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OFFICE LAIRK.
OUR William is a model lad,
And, be it clearly understood,
His ninety-nine per cent. is good,
And only one per cent. is bad.
Discreet and sharp, polite and strong,
He is a perfect office boy,
With one per cent. (v.s.) alloy-
A fatal tendency to song.
To this the Senior Pard demurred.
“Although he is a splendid thing,
I do not care to hear him sing.”
Wherein the Head Cashier concurred.
“Speak gently to the youthful Bill,
And tell him, though himself is dear,
His music's not, O Head Cashier.”
The Head Cashier replied, “I will.”
“Dissuade, or at the most forbid.
His tender feelings do not hurt.
Be neither rude nor harsh nor curt,
But stop him singing, please.” He did.
For two long weeks our William led
A tuneless Hſe, his music dumb,
And when he felt he'd like to hum
He chewed a caramel instead.
By some ill-omened circumstance
Our Head Cashier it did befall
To be invited to a Ball
(For even head cashiers must dance).
And there there fell upon his ear
A soul-enchanting melody,
So pleasing that next morning he
Must voice it, William standing near.
And, though he ceased, the sweet refrain
Almost before he had begun, -
It was too late. The harm was done,
And William's song is heard again :--
How he would have us all remark
(And to that end he spares no pains)
Though Home is sweet, the fact
remains -
He dare not go there in the dark.
. -- -
“Quickly after starting Trinity showed in
front, but it was for a few strokes only, for Clare
closed on them at the quarter-mile, led by a
quarter of a mile at the half-mile, and were
nearly clear at Fawley.”---The Morning Post.
It seems that Clare's magnificent spurt
was too good to last.
“Sharp grieved for the loss of Tyldesley.
They are the Jonathan and the Absolom of
Lancashire cricket.” — Manchester Evening
Chronicle.
This makes SHARP out to be a contem-
porary of DAyid (TYLDESIEY's father). He
must be quite a veteran; which would
account for his selection.
“IRhodes made a few nice hits, and in cºm-
pany with Lilley put on 1.”—Belfast News-
Letter.
Not bad for a Test Match.
MISUNDERSTOOD.
“My dunderheaded neighbours,” said
the Squire, “the whole affair is a con-
founded nuisance, especially when I’ve
got a touch of the gout; but my position
in the county seems to demand that I
should take the chair to-night, and
introduce our new Candidate to this
miscellaneous and not over-intelligent
gathering. Naturally you know nothing
about Mr. Gawker, who lives quite five
hundred miles from here, and I know
very little, except that his father made a
fortune out of bath-taps and he himself
is a member of three spoiting clubs and
the English Bar. Why he wants to
represent us in Parliament I can't, of
course, imagine—I suppose it's merely
his disinterested love for us. But here
he is. Let him explain for himself.”
And, with a proud and impressive ges-
ture, our Chairman swept the water-
bottle from the table and sat down.
(Well, perhaps he didn't say quite
that ; to tell the truth, the noise outside
the place kept me from hearing a word ;
but * he has a very speaking
face.
Then up rose Mr. Gawker, a tall, pale
young man with a single eyeglass. The
stewards, rosetted lile prize cattle,
clapped their hands, and we made a joy-
ful sound of welcome with our umbrellas.
Mr. Gawker felt round the inside of
|his collar with one finger and began.
“My good asses,” said he, “I know
you expect me to promise you the moon,
so I’ll do so at once, and I heartily wish
you may get it. But you know as well
as I do that when once I’m in the House
I shall simply have to obey the Party
Whip, like any other Johnny who wants
to advance his–I mean, who wants to
serve those great and glorious principles
that we all have so much at heart. I've
sent a cheque to your Cricket Club, and
I hope to goodness you'll think it big
cnough. I know I do. Now about the
Budget . . .” - -
(No, possibly I haven't got him down
verbatim ; ; but, with a free fight
going on outside to an accompaniment
of police whistles, is it surprising if I
had to guess at a word here and there?)
For ten minutes Mr. Gawker kept the
even tenor of his oratorical way, and I
sat in a temperature of 90° Fah. firmly
clutching the counterfoil of the pink
ticket that entitled me to pass out.
Once or twice I said, “No, no,” in a
gently deprecating fashion ; for, when
all is said and done, Tariff Reform at
least means (I hope) a good twopenny
cigar. Then the inevitable happened.
A shrill voice rose, vibrant and des-
perate, to the glass dome overhead (we
were in the Corn Exchange), and fel]
amongst the startled audience.
“Will you give women the Vote?”
Mr. Gawker, with an air of pained
surprise, turned rather limply to the
Chairman.
“Put her out !” shouted the Squire
angrily (I knew the gout had got him),
and the rosetted ones rallied to the
onslaught. Out she went, an unwept
martyr.
“Statistics,” thought I, as our speaker
began ticking off the ſingers of one hand
with the forefinger of the other. And
then a lady sitting behind me whispered
in my ear.
“I quite agree,” I replied ; and a
steward watched us with latent ferocity,
ready to pounce. Despite the risk I
rose-1 couldn't refuse so obvious a
duty—and, leaning gracefully on my
unbrella, extended my right hand up-
wards and outwards. * ,
“Will you give——” I began. .
Of course I knew the words were ill-
chosen as soon as they escaped my lips.
But, all the same, I'll never, never.
forgive the Squire or play croquet with
his daughters again. -
Whirlwind and earthquake followed,
and a chaos of black-garbed limbs, red
faces, and tri-coloured ribbon, while the
floor rose and fell. I killed three
stewards in the hall and two on the
step. Then I found myself outside the
Corn Exchange, sternly grasping a
tattered handful of rosette, while the
pale moon, that has witnessed so many
follies, looked down sadly on man and
his fevered violence. - - * -
“If you had allowed me to finish my
sentence,” I said coldly to one of the
stewards who survived, “I was going to
say," Will you give orders, Mr. Chairman,
to have a window opened 2' I only
wanted fresh air, you joskin.” .
“Well, and now you’ve got it,” said
Perkins crossly, looking for his collar.
Perkins is an ironmonger, and I resolved
at once to transfer my custom to his
rival. Last year I bought a small file
from him, but “never again,” thought I.
And then an awful thing happened.
Three Suffragettes surrounded me, pat-
ting me, admiring me. “Well done,
well done!” they cried. And the moon
went behind a cloud.
To suffer martyrdom for a cause one
contemns is bad enough. To be con-
gratulated upon it is a sorrow's crown
of sorrow. - -
“Ladies,” I said, “I have been mis-
understood. Never would I assail the
glorious right for which our ſolefathers
bled, the ancient sacred, inalienable
British right of Free Speech—for People
on Platforms. What you witnessed was
the result of a misapprehension on the
part of my friend Mr. Perkins, to whom,
however, I bear no malice.” And I
turned to shake him by the hand.
3ut Perkins had gone into the hall
again to guard our ancient liberties.

P. O. POLITENESS.
THE PostMASTER-GENERAL's order to Post Office servants,
pointing out the advantages of “courtesy, good humour,
and an obliging disposition,” should have been accompanied
by hints for the use of beginners in the art of politeness.
Thus:--
PLEASE (pronounced plºt). —This word is an abbrevia-
tion of “If you please.” It is generally placed at the
beginning or the end of a request, distinguishing it from
a command.
ThisNK You (colloquially pronounced 'kii). — Post Office
officials may have noticed that this is the expression used
by the stamp-buyer on receiving his stamps, and with a
little diligence they will soon get into the way of saying
“Thank you” when the money for the stamps is given
to them.
A SMILE.—This is a most valuable accomplishment, by
which the trouble and difficulty of saying polite things can
frequently be dispensed with. A customer would often,
indeed, prefer a smile to speech. It is produced in the
following manner: let the lips rest lightly and naturally
together, gently contract the facial muscles in a manner that
lengthens the mouth. If possible, allow the corners of the
mouth to curve upwards, and do not resist the tendency of
the lower eyelids to close towards the upper. If the teeth
are pearly, the lips may be slightly opened.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
STORIES of village life are rather like the little girl in the
celebrated poem—when they are good they are very, very good,
and when they are bad they are horrid. Fortunately, how-
ever, A Little Green World (HUTCHINSON) seems to me to be
very good indeed. J. E. BUCKROSE is, I observe, the author
of various other books, which have escaped me, but which
have evidently been greatly to the liking of several critics.
So far as the present volume is concerned, I make haste to
add my own voice to the chorus of praise. Hardly since the
days of Miss MitroRD or Mrs. GASKELL has the comedy of an
English countryside been treated with such entire success.
J. E. BUCKROSE writes of it with a delicacy and a gift of
sympathetic laughter which, if those reviewers are right who
prefix a “Mr.” to the name, is oddly feminine. Of story there
is little--just a group of very ordinary people, some engage-
ments, a general shake-up, and a fresh pairing. It is the
| treatment of rural character that gives the book its charm.
of conversation, too, which makes the characters seem so
unreal.
The Bronze Bell (GRANT RICHARDs) is a story of destiny and
intrigue, of Rajputs and Babus, of mystery and adventure,
which tells how a member of the Indian Secret Service, of
the true KIPLING brand, with the help of a young American
called Amber, nipped in the bud a projected native rising
which would have easily eclipsed the horrors of the Mutiny
in '57. My salaams to Mr. Louis Joseph WANCE. I have
followed with deep interest every step of young Amber's
perilous path, as he is led by the finger of Fate through the
ghastly Gateway of Swords to save India for the English
and the girl he loved for himself. It is one long succession
of first-class thrills. Only why does Mr. VANCE make the
Bronze Bell speak—in purest Sanskrit—at the supreme
moment? That seems to me an unnecessary departure from:
the craisemblance of his story, which in every other respect
is as real as it is ingenious. However, it is a very slight
blemish, which will be readily forgiven him by his readers
in this country and in India, because he has made his

The Perjurer (CONSTABLE) is rather a melodramatic book
about not very attractive people. The women don't actually
command the men to unhand them, but that is the sort of
atmosphere which hangs over the dialogue. The hero, Lord
Larernock, is the most unpleasant bounder who has appeared
in fiction recently, but for some reason Mr. W. E. Norris and
all the other characters are reluctant to acknowledge this.
“July an " (for instance) “knew Lavernock very well, had a
species of liking for him, and did not deny him certain
merits.” Well, he must have known him very well to have
discovered the merits. Anyhow, Lavernock's suicide on
p. 201 was most welcome, even though it was the beginning
of the misunderstandings. The fact was that Forester and
Julyan had each promised Helen Monk that he would not
gamble any more with Lavernock (her cousin), and so when the
latter killed himself as the result of losing heavily at écarté to
Forester, Julyan, knowing that Forester had been provisionally
accepted by Helen, took the blame on himself, although (or
rather because) he too loved Helen. At the inquest he per-
jured himself valiantly. Helen, of course, was freezingly polite
to him afterwards and full of admiration for Forester. The truth
came out in the end, but not until Julyan had been stabbed
by Lavernock's actress wife. The story is extremely well
put together, and would seem quite natural and probable
if the dialogue had been less formal. It is this formality
the author. What is
additionally provoking is a habit of setting forth common-
places of criticism in glittering phrases that to the unwary
suggest novelty. As was said about a dear departed friend
who dyed his hair, England is really not so black as Mr.
MASTERMAN paints her. An exceptionally interesting and
informing chapter is the one whose scope he disguises, with
characteristic effort to find an arresting word, beneath the
title “Prisoners.” It deals with the home and workshop
condition of men, women and children labouring under the
Factory Acts. Here Mr. MASTERMAN's Ministerial position has
afforded him opportunity of studying official documents. He
uses it so well as to make me the more regret the others he
has lost.
Hurling the Hurler.
“The Greek sport of discobolus throwing, which has become so
popular now, was also one of the features of the day, and was won
by Sakèlaridès with a throw of 82ft.”—Paris Daily Mail.
This event, however, will never be really popular with the
discobolus himself.
“From the public point of view it is a pity that he became a member
of the Upper House while still in the full vigour of his mental powers."—
The Sketch.
Still, after all, they must have one or two like that.

CROSS-EXAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's RoAD TO KNowLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; Uncle John—Captain John Lambert,
late 28th Hussars—aged 44.)
Little Arthur. It was very kind of you to take us all to the
theatre yesterday, Uncle John.
Uncle John. Don't mention it, old man, don't mention it.
I'm only too glad you enjoyed yourself. Must buck up your
father and mother now and then. Can't let 'em rust in the
country all the year round.
L. A. I'm sure they thought it was very kind of you,
Uncle; and it was a great treat for me.
U.J. That's all right, Arty. We've got to make a man
of you, you know.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, I quite see that. Do you think seeing
The Belles of Belluno will make a man of me quicker?
U. J. Of course it will, my boy. Pretty music, pretty
girls, pretty dresses, and all that. Got to see 'em some day,
you know, so you may as well see 'em now-eh, what?
L. A. Yes, Uncle, and that's why I'm so much obliged to
you. But when I’m grown up will people do what they do
in The Belles of Belluno 2
U. J. What do you mean?
L. A. Will they all sing things together and dance?
U.J. Well, perhaps not all of 'em.
L. A. But will some of them 2
U.J. One or two might. But we’re living in England, you
know, and The Belles of Belluno were in Italy, weren't they 2
L. A. Yes, Uncle. Is that what they do in Italy 2
U.J. You bet they do—every time. . *
L. A. Then I don't want to live in Italy.
U.J. That's right, Arty, you stick to that.
Englishman, and don't you let 'em forget it.
L. A. No, Uncle, I won't. But, if people are not going to
do things in that way when I’m grown up, I don't see how
the play will help me to be a man.
U.J. Ah, I daresay you don't now, but you will some day.
L.A. I hope so, Uncle. But was it a very clever play, Uncle?
U. J. Well, I enjoyed it all right.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, I know you did. You laughed much
more than Papa, and Mamma didn't laugh at all.
U. J. Didn't she? Ah, well, she's a woman, you know.
She can't help it, so we mustn't throw it in her teeth.
L. A. No, Uncle, I'll try not to. I'm sure it ought to be a
clever piece.
U.J. Why?
L. A. Well, three people wrote the music, and three others
wrote the words, and another man produced it, so it ought to
be much cleverer than if only one man did it.
U.J. So it ought, Arty. You've just about hit it.
L. A. Do all the ladies in Italy wear very short dresses,
Uncle?
U. J. Every one of 'em, Arty. It's a national custom.
L. A. I thought it must be, because Lady Dolly Varasour
didn't wear a short dress all the time, did she?—and she's
suppo ed to be English.
U. J. What a chap you are, Arty, for noticing things.
L. A. But in the last Act her dress was the shortest of all.
I suppose that was because she was getting accustomed to
Italian ways.
U. J. That's it, of course. Doosid smart she looked, too.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, I thought so, too.
U.J. Did you now. You've got an eye, young man.
L. A. Thank you, Uncle; but I didn't like her singing.
U.J. No, poor Kitty never could sing for nuts, but she
keeps piping away. Does her best, you know.
L. A. I’m sure she does, Uncle; but why did you all clap
yºur hands so at her song?
U.J. What song 2
L. A. It's in the book here (taking book and reading):
“I'm Dolly this, and I'm Dolly that,
And I'm Dolly in prose or rhyme,
I'm Dolly thin and I'm Dolly fat,
And I'm Dolly all the time.”
What does it all mean, Uncle?
U. J. Blessed if I know.
L. A. Then why did you clap your hands and say encore?
U.J. Oh, it went, you know-catchy sort of thing.
L. A. But it wasn't very clerer, was it, Uncle?
U.J. You can't have everything clever, you know.
L. A. No, Uncle; but you ought to have clapped your
hands at the clever things.
U. J. Oh, I ought, ought I?
L. A. Yes, Uncle, I tried to. But, Uncle !
U. J. Yes, old boy.
L. A. Isn't Lady Dolly Varasour a married lady?

LOWER RIVER CAUSERIE.
(For similar information as to social functions on the Upper Reaches,
see the Society rapers.)
SouthEND is unusually full this year, in spite of the Budget
proposals, and the countless attractions of this favoured spot
appeal with irresistible force to an ever-increasing clientèle.
Not without reason has Southend been described as the
Venice of the Home Counties, and many of the most exclusive
members of Limehouse Society are to be seen at this delightful
resort. The pier, from which the sea is visible at all states
of the tide, is thronged with a gay crowd of loungers who are
attracted by the unique collection of slot machines and the
the happy couple to this charming riparian resort. At 5.30
a most tasteful repast was put before the delighted guests.
We are privileged to state that the chief ingredients of the
meal were assorted shellfish and Ceylon's premier product.
The day was somewhat sultry, and the gentlemen, displaying
that touch of Bohemianism which gives such a cachet to
Plumstead, removed their coats. An exquisite rendering of
some of the most popular melodies of the day was given on
the gramophone, and brought a very agreeable evening to a
conclusion.
The Naval Pageant has caused considerable excitement
among L.C.C. nautical circles in the neighbourhood of Black-
friars. Criticism of an unfavourable character has been
expressed at the failure to provide the crews with any
orchestral diversion in the shape of concertinas and cornets
—a regrettable omission on the part of a cheese-paring
Admiralty. A local expert, who invited the crew of a
destroyer to retrieve the coppers which he had thrown in the
river, is understood to have formed an unfavourable opinion
as to the capabilities of our tars.
Our Isle of Dogs and North Woolwich chit-chat is unavoid-
ably held over until the middle of next week.

THE RABBITS.
CHATTER W.—AT PLAY.
I sºlº TED a handkerchief, gave a last
look at the weather, which was beastly,
and went down (very late) to breakfast.
As I opened the door there was a sudden
hush. Everybody looked eagerly at me.
Then Miss Fortescue tittered.
Well, you know how one feels when
that happens. I put my hand quickly
to my tie-it was still there. I squinted
down my nose, but there was no Smut.
To make quite sure I went over to the
glass. Then Simpson exploded.
Yet nobody spoke. They all sat there
watching me . . . . and at last I began
to get nervous. I opened my mouth to
say “Good morning,” but before I got
it out Miss Blair gave a little shriek of
excitement. That upset me altogether.
I walked up to the teapot and, pouring
myself out a cup, said, with exaggerated
carelessness: “Rotten day, isn't it?”
And then came the laughter—shout
after shout.
I held out my hand to Myra. “Good-
bye,” I said, “I’m going home. Thank
you for a very jolly time, but I'm not
going to be bullied.”
“Oh, you dear,” she gurgled.
“I am rather sweet before breakfast,”
I admitted, “but how * *
“It was too heavenly of you.
thought you would.”
“I think I shall go back to bed.”
“It was rather rough luck,” said
Archie, “but of course the later you are,
the worse it is for you.” -
“And the higher the fewer. Quite
so. If this is from “Breakfast Table
Topics’ in The Daily Mirror, I haven't
seen them to-day ; but I'll do my best.”
“Archie, explain.” -
Archie took up a piece of paper from
the table and explained. “It’s like
this,” he said. “I came down first and
looked at the weather, and said * x
“Anyone would,” I put in quickly.
“Well, then, Blair came in and said,
“Beastly day,’ and then Simpson——
Well, I thought I'd write down every-
body's first remark, to see if anybody
let the weather alone. Here they are.”
“It’s awful,” put in Myra, “to have
one's remarks taken down straight off.
I've quite forgotten what I said.”
This was the list.
Archie: “ Bother.” (So he says.)
Blair: “What a beastly day !”
Simpson : “What a jolly day !”
The Major: “Well, not much cricket
to-day, hey?” -
Myra: “Oh, my dear, what a go!”
Miss Blair: “What a terrible day!”
Miss Fortescue: “Oh, you poor men
—what a day !”
Thomas: “Rotten day, isn't it?”
Me: “Rotten day, isn't it?”
I never
“I don't think much of Thomas's
remark,” I said.
Later on in the morning we met (all
except the Major, that is) in the room
which Myra calls hers and Archie calls
the nursery, and tried to think of some-
thing to do.
“I’m not going to play Bridge all
day for anyone,” said Archie.
“The host should lay himself out to
amuse his guests,” said Myra.
“Otherwise his guests will lay him
out,” I warned him, “to amuse them-
selves.”
“Well, what do you all want to do?”
“I should like to look at a photograph
album,” said Thomas.
“Stump cricket.”
“What about hide-and-seek?”
“No, I've got it,” cried Archie;
“we’ll be Boy Scouts.”
“Hooray!” cried everybody else.
Archie was already on his hands and
knees. “IHa!” he said, “is that the
spoor of the white ant that I see before
me? Spoorly not. I have but been
winded by the water-beetle.
“Sound, sound the trumpet, beat the drum,
To all the scouting world proclaim
One crowded stalk upon the tum
Is worth an age without a name.”
“Archie!” shrieked Myra in horror.
“It is too late,” she added, “all the
ladies have swooned.”
We arranged sides. Myra and I and
Simpson and Thomas against the others.
They were to start first.
“This isn't simply hide-and-seek,”
said Archie as they went off. “You’ve
got to track us fairly. We shall probably
blaze' door-posts. When you hear the
bleat of a tinned sardine that means
we're ready. Keep your eyes skinned, my
hearties, and Heaven defend the right.”
“We ought to have bare knees really,”
said Myra when they'd gone. “Boy
scouts always do. So that when they
go through a bed of nettles they know
they’ve been.”
“I shall stalk the stairs to begin with,”
I said. “Simpson, you go down the
back way, and look as much like a
vacuum-cleaner as possible. Then they
won't notice you. Thomas and Myra——
Hush | Listen Was that the bleat of
a fresh sardine or the tinned variety 2 °
“Tinned,” said Myra. “Let’s go.”
We went. I took the Queen Anne
staircase on my—in the proper stalking
position. I moved very slowly, searching
for spoor. Half-way down the stairs my
back-fin slipped, and I shot over the old
oak at a tremendous pace, landing in the
hall like a Channel swimmer. Looking
up I saw Thomas in front of me. He
was examining the doors for “blazes.”
Myra was next to him, her ear to the
ground, listening for the gallop of horses'
hoofs. I got up and went over to them.
“Hast seen aught of a comely wench
in parlous case, hight Mistress Dahlia?”
I asked Thomas.
“Boy scouts don't talk like that,” he
said gruffly.
“I beg your pardon. I was thinking
that I was a Cavalier and you were a
Roundhead. Now I perceive that you
are just an ordinary fathead.”
“Why,” said Myra at the foot of the
stairs, “what does this button mean?
Have I found a clue?”
I examined it, and then I looked at
my own coat. -
“You have,” I said. “Somebody has
been down those stairs quite recently,
for the button is still warm.”
“Where is Scout Simpson 2"
At that moment he appeared breathless
with excitement. -
“I have had an adventure,” he said
hurriedly, without saluting. “I was on
the back stairs looking like a vacuum
cleaner, when suddenly Archie and Miss
Blair appeared. They looked right at
me, but didn't seem to penetrate my
disguise. Archie, in fact, leant against
me, and said to Miss Blair, “I will now
tell you of my secret mission. I carry
caviare — I mean dispatches to the
general. Breathe but a word of this to
the enemy, and I miss the half-holiday
on Saturday. Come, let us be going,
but first to burn the secret code.’ And
—and then he struck a match on me,
and burned it.”
Myra gurgled, and hastily looked
solemn again. “Proceed, Scout Simp-
son,” she said, “for the night approaches
apace.” -
“Well, then they started down the
stairs, and I went after them on my—
scouting, you know. I made rather a
noise at one corner, and Archie looked
round at me, and said to Miss Blair,
‘The tadpoles are out full early. See
yonder where one lies basking.’ And
he came back and put his foot on me
and said, ‘Nay, 'tis but a shadow. Let
us return right hastily. Yet tarry a
moment what time I lay a false trail.’
So they tarried and he wrote a note and
dropped it on me. And afterwards I
got up and here it is.”
“The secret dispatch,” cried Myra.
“It’s addressed to the Scoutmistress,
and it says outside, “Private, not to be
opened till Christmas Day.’”
Myra opened it and read: “Your
blessed scouts are everywhere. Let me
just have fire minutes with her in the
nursery, there's a dear. I'd do as much
for you.” -
But she didn't read it aloud, and I
didn't see it till some days afterwards.
She simply put it away, and smiled, and
announced that the scouts would now
adjourn to the billiard-room for pemmi-
can and other refreshments; which they
did. The engagement was announced
that evening. A. A. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“THE DICTATOR” UNBENDS.
By the courtesy of the Editor of The
Dictator, who has placed his advance
proofs at our disposal, we are enabled to
forestall the interesting correspondence
which will appear in our esteemed con-
temporary's next issue:–
THE CALL of THE DABChick.
SIR,-The curious variations of opinion
| about the exact interval of the cry of the
dabchick may be possibly explained by
the following
which fell to my lot when I was ranching
in Canada several years ago. In those
days I had a pet dabchick which used
to sleep, standing on one leg, on the top
of my cruet-stand. When visitors entered
my sitting-room he used to cry out,
“Wipe your feet, wipe your feet,” in an
anapaestic measure, the first two syllables
being on the same note, the last being a
minor tenth below. (This I have on the
authority of my landlady, who was a
Primitive Methodist with an absolute
sense of pitch). On one occasion a
French officer came to see me and was
greeted by “Baba" with , the usual
salutation, but at a different pitch. I at
once rang the bell for the landlady, who
informed me that the interval was a
major sixth. When this was told the
officer he nearly fainted with amazement,
but on recovering his self-possession
exclaimed, “But that is me! I am a
Major in the Sixth regiment of Chas-
seurs ''' - -
But “Baba’’ was altogether an excep-
tional bird. On my return to England
I trained him to mark golf balls, and no
matter how deeply it was embedded in
heather or whins, he would invariably fly
like an arrow to the globe, keeping up
a constant twitter until the caddie had
located it. Unfortunately, when I was
playing at Musselwick last February
with an Austrian Archduke, my partner
sliced his drive so badly that he struck
“Baba,” who was sitting on the tee-box,
and killed him on the spot.
I am, Sir, etc.
A. LEGGE PULLAR.
8, Marine Prospect, Brondesbury.
P.S.–If your readers' patience is not
exhausted I wonder whether they will
assist me in ascertaining why it is that
the old English name for the dabchick
is “the Nope” 2
|We are delighted to print Mr. Legge
Pullar's fascinating letter, and only
regret that we are unable to reproduce
the photograph of “Baba's '' tomb, with
which it is accompanied. So gifted a
creature, indeed, deserved princely obse-
quies. We can assure Mr. Legge Pullar
that, whatever may be the case with our
readers, our patience is never exhausted
by these recitals. They enable us to
face the dreadful prospect of Mr. Lloyd-
remarkable experience.
GEORGE's Budget with renewed fortitude. pression that the Bunting family were
As regards the beautiful old English
word “Nope,” we may be allowed to
remark that it has been transplanted to
America as a synonym for “No,” but we
are not aware that “Yep,” the transatlantic
for “Yes,” was used by GILBERT WHITE
as the nickname for any bird. Yet
“Yep ’’ is a singularly pleasing mono-
syllable with a true Elizabethan ring
about it.—ED. Dictator.]
CHRISTIAN NAMES FOR ANIMALs.
SIR,-One of your correspondents has
called attention to the pleasant habit of
giving birds Christian names, e.g. Thomas
Tit, William Wagtail, Philip Sparrow.
In our household this practice is not
confined to a few birds, but is of uni-
versal application. From earliest infancy
my children have been taught to address
all animals alliteratively—Bartholomew
Blue-bottle, Millicent Mouse, Christopher
Cockroach, &c. The result is to be seen
in the extraordinary tameness of all the
fauna in our neighbourhood. Only yester-
day a wood-pigeon flew into my dressing-
room while I was shaving and remained
perched on my head until the operation
was finished. I ought to add that I
have trained a squirrel to act as a pen-
wiper while I am writing, and that we
have a pet cricket and a tame bat who
are the best of friends.
I am, Sir, &c.
Verity Parva Vicarage.
D. D. PIIIBIs.
STRANGE CONDUCT OF A SEMI-BOMBAY
Duck.
SIR,-A valuable semi-Bombay duck
in my farm-yard, which habitually quacks
in the key of D flat, has suddenly and
without any warning taken to quacking
in the key of F sharp minor. The odd
thing about it is that this rise in pitch
should have synchronised with a fall in
the thermometer.
Congratulating you on your splendid
defence of the House of Lords,
I am, Sir, &c.,
(Mrs.) ANNA NYAss.
The Oaks, Much Lyeham.
|Ducks are very imitative creatures, and
it is possible that the bird in question
may have heard some one playing a
piece in the romantic key of F sharp
minor, and temporarily attuned its cry
to the piano. It is, indeed, a pleasure
to know that our policy in regard to the
House of Lords has commended itself to
the possessor of this talented fowl.-E.D.
Dictator.]
THE BUNTING FAMILY.
SIR,-('an any of your readers tell me
whether the yellow Bunting is the baby
Bunting mentioned in the historic ballad.
I am, Sir, &c. PAUL PRIOR.
Bosham.
|We have always been under the im-
human beings, who were much addicted
to the chase. But we are open to cor-
rection. Perhaps Mr. Prior could get
the information of which he is in need
on applying to the First Sea Lord at the
Admiralty.—ED. Dictator.]
“THE DICTATOR’’ TENT AT BISLEY.
SIR,-The generous interest of your
readers, who have, as in former years,
provided a Dictator tent at Bisley, em-
boldens me to send you the accompany-
ing brief account of the entertainments
held therein during the past week :-
The aim of the tent is to refresh and
amuse riflemen, after their day's shooting
is over, by a succession of exhilarating
programmes. This year several of the
old features have been retained, but a
number of new items have been added.
Thus the entire staff of The Dictator
have given imitations of various animals
and birds, notably the cuckoo, the pea-
cock, the chiff-chaff, the corn-crake, the
night-jar, the jay, and the screech-owl.
The Editor has lectured on Tuesday,
Thursday and Saturday on “Do Field-
mice use field artillery 2” and on Mon-
day, Wednesday and Friday on “Bastiat
and the Budget.” The tent holds forty
persons, but one day last week, during a
lecture on “The Fiscal Inwardness of
Persian Cats,” fifty-seven people managed
to get inside.
I am, Sir, etc.,
HAROLD WILLIERS PEEL,
Hon. Sec. Free Trade Entertainment
Association.
[In the circumstances for us to offer
any comment might seem to savour of
egotism, but we cannot refrain from ex-
pressing our regret that Mr. Lloyd-
GEORGE did not see his way to attend the
lecture on “Bastiat and the Budget.”
A debate in a tent, as LINGOLN remarks,
is a soul-shaking experience. A propos
of field mice, can any of our readers
supply us with any authentic anecdotes
about the mole of HADRIAN ? - ED
Dictator.]
Candour from a Golf Committee.
“Rule 10–Disputes respecting the play
shall be determined by the Committee, with
power to add to their number.”
The cause of the present bad weather
has now been scientifically explained by
the ha'penny press thus:
“It is only necessary for the barometer to
undertake a steady and sustained rise in Eng-
land, France, and Germany, for the distribution
of pressure to become favourable for a spell of
real summer weather.”
You see how impossible it is for the
*
pressure to do anything until the baro-
meter makes a start.

P. 0. POLITENESS.
MR. SYDNEY Buxton's promise of re-
ºwards for civility is causing such a revo-
lution in post-office officials that several
customers are complaining of shock. The
following dialogues, overheard in a local
office, may be taken as average samples
of the state of things at present pre-
vailing:—
First Customer.

Counter Clerk (ticking off telegram).
Excuse me one moment. (Finishes mes-
sage.) So sorry to keep you waiting, but
we are short-handed to-day. That parcel
will be fourpence, if you please, parcels
st.
First Customer. What will it be letter
post 2
Counter Clerk. It will be fivepence
halfpenny, letter post; and in case you
care to know, it would be precisely the
same by book post.
First Customer. Dear,
seems very expensive.
it again to make sure?
Counter Clerk. With pleasure. Yes,
that is correct—let me jot down the
amounts for you on a piece of paper.
First Customer (stares at paper and
hesitates for thirty seconds). I’ve changed
my mind; I think I'll send it by hand,
after all, if you'll give it back to me.
Counter Clerk. Certainly. The
weather looks like rain, but I hope it
will hold off till you get home. Good
morning, and thank you.
Second Customer. If I send a letter to
my husband's mother at Little Billetby
about nine to-night, what time will it be
delivered 2
Counter Clerk. I must just look it up
—I won't keep you a moment. Ah! it
won't be delivered till to-morrow after-
noon at Little Billetby—but if they send
to Great Billetby they can collect it
to-morrow morning.

When you survey the trophies of your cunning,
And muse, Corinna, on the grim remains
Of those poor wights who, hardly in the running,
Were led to think themselves your happy swains,
And when they learnt the truth despaired and blubbered,
And left their scalps to fill your Indian cupboard—
Take special heed (I do not ask for mercy;
The mariners of old were wise to shun
A second visit to the shores of Circe),
But in that horrid pile take heed of one,
A striking chevelure that (proud tormenter)
Was trained to part exactly down the centre.
That one is mine; and if you have them labelled,
And with your sister Sioux sometimes swop
Impressions of the war-path true and fabled,
I charge you to observe this pious crop,
And tell them how its wearer took his gruel,
A dauntless paleface, in the love-god's duel.
Some there may well have been who tumbled nicely,
And when you told that immemorial fib -
Of how you'd be a sister, said precisely
The sort of things you liked of love ad lib.,
And ceaseless adoration that should flow on
Till death untimely supervened, and so on.
But not the present writer; loth and lagging,
He took some time to conquer, and he turned
Nobly to bay, indignant of the bagging,
Gave you an awkward interlude when spurned,
Thrilled with the anger of a wounded poet,
Thought you a hardened flirt, and let you know it.
Therefore, I say, do honour to a victim
That gave you such an anxious hour to stalk,
That struggled manfully, and, when you tricked him,
Not lightly yielded to the tomahawk ;
And when the tales of triumph are recounted
Revere that votive tuft and have it mounted.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I notice in The Daily News a photograph
of an orator on a chair with an audience of six boys. It
is placed beside a photograph of a Woman's Suffrage gather-

figures, but the legend this time is “A Free Trade Orator and
his Audience.” I shall be glad if you will allow me space to
inform editors of these and other papers that I am now touring
the provinces with “Victor,” my tame donkey, and that I am
ready to be photographed in suitable positions as

ExTRACTED FROM the DiARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 12.-
One of the most difficult tasks that falls
to the lot of a Leader of either House is
the pronouncement of panegyrics on
departed statesmen. On a historic
occasion Dizzy, remembering MoLièRE's
avowed practice of taking his good things
wherever he found them, got over the
difficulty by incorporating in the details
of his lament a purple passage from a
eulogy spoken by a French orator at the
tomb of a great Frenchman.
GLADSTONE at his best on these occa-
sions. His panegyric on PEEL, with its
apt quotation of the splendid lines be-
ginning, “Now is the stately column
broke,” is a precious possession. PRINCE
ARTHUR touches a high level. C.-B., who
on more than one occasion joined him in
paying tribute to the mighty dead, was,
in quite different style, a worthy com-
peer. The present PREMIER, called upon
to bewail the passing of his predecessor,
struck a note that surprised as it pleased
the House by its genuine emotion ex-
pressed in terms of simple eloquence.
To-night, CREWE, rising to pay a tribute
to the memory of Lord RIPON, established

lessly critical Assembly. His
brief speech was lofty in
conception, perfect in phras-
ing. Beneath the reverence
of a still young statesman
for the memory of a veteran
who had filled with distino-
tion most of the offices which
are the prizes of a political
career, was heard the note
of personal affection for one
whº, as he simply said, “I
have known all my life.”
The Commons spent their
tenth night in Committee on
Budget Bill. Before it was
reached disturbing effect

Here assistance came from unexpected

mark that to ask the MINISTER FOR WAR
what would happen if the Yeomanry
were ordered to charge is a projection of
imagination carried too far for the
Question Hour.
House laughed ; LANE-Fox sat down
with his question not only unanswered
but incomplete. Its effect nevertheless
unmistakable and enduring. Through
the long hours that followed, when
Members were ostensibly discussing
methods of ascertaining the original site
value of land, or contemplating the con-
tingency of decrement instead of incre-
ment, one could see the troubled look on
pallid faces as lips silently formed the
fateful question, “What would happen

assaults on citadel of the Lords. Now,
advancing with flags flying, drums
beating, trumpets blaring, sits down be-
fore it in force. Or, as the Parliamen-
tary reports put it, “Lord Roberts
moved the second reading of the
National Service Bill.”
Northu MBERLAND submits resolution
involving rejection of Bill. As his
Grace stood behind Front Opposition
Bench consulting manuscript on which
his jeur d'esprit were written there
was nothing in his bearing or personal
appearance to suggest the PERCY whom
Douglas knew at Chevy Chase. On the
contrary, rather suggestive, as SARK
observed, of “the Waterloo House young
man" known to another generation now
grown into the sixties. Appearances
notoriously deceptive. When in fine
passage the Duke intimated his readi-
ness, if necessary, to “see this fight out
on his stumps,” a wave of emotion ran
through habitually icy audience.
This was last night. Debate resumed
this afternoon in same conditions of
crowded benches and thronged side
galleries whénce bright eyes, the owners
| gowned in daintiest summer frocks,
rained
influence. Affair admirably
stage-managed. Whilst MILNER was on
his legs expounding heroic views in halt-
| ing sentences, Heaven's artillery suddenly
brought into action. Peal after peal of
thunder broke over startled town ;
through the open windows was heard
the plash of battalions of torrential
rain.
LANslow NE, in one of his masterly
| balanced speeches, damned the Bill with
faint praise of motives of its supporters.
| By common consent honours of debate

In carefully prepared
address, which comprised
slight résumé of Peninsula
War that left much to be
desired in NAPIER, he artfully
led the listening senate up
to Trafalgar. His intent,
born and nurtured in the
study, was to cite the date
of the battle, let it come
with a clash like the roar of
sit down.
Turn which circumstances
took unfortunately not only
spoiled a well-designed plan,
but prevented the House
from knowing exactly how
it would have worked out.
That is a detail. What hap-
pened was that MAYO, having
skilfully prepared the ground
for his coup, remarked :
“As your lordships know,
the battle of Trafalgar was
fought in the year–er—in
the year—er–er—”
DESCENDED FRoM Hotspur.

draw you aside from the true path! Believe
me, an armed camp is the haunt of the-ahem'
--of Beelzebub, and no-o-o pla-a-ace for our
de-ar sons !”
He had forgotten the date. Worst of
it was that, looking helplessly round, he
found no noble lord sitting near or far
who was able to supply it.
“Well, my lords,” said MAYo, brisking
up, “for the purposes of my argument
it does not matter in what year Trafalgar
was fought.”
Plucky this. But general impression
remained that it was a trifle inadequate.

case, remarked that he “ had a great

index of the current Law I'eports appears
the line, “Mr. Justice Channell: his
great mind.”
The MEMBER For SARK, indexing to-
day's Parliamentary Reports, writes the
line— ... " -
“Mr. Speaker Lowther: his blank mind."
No suggestion of damnatory objurga-
tion lurks in the phrase. It merely
records the masterly attitude of igno-
rance assumed by the SPEAKER at a
critical moment. During a sitting which
commenced yesterday afternoon at 2.50,
closing this morning a few minutes after
9, a noble earl took occasion to observe
that a gentleman belonging to West Ham
and the Labour Party was not in a condi-
tion usefully to take part in debate. The
gentleman from West Ham, refraining
from attempt to mince matters, retoited
that the noble lord was a liar. Further,
he indicated readiness to “ram the words
down his throat.” Declining to obey
order from the Chair to withdraw the
offensive term, the gentleman from West
Ham was directed to withdraw himself.
This he did, pausing at the Bar to invite
the noble earl to walk out with him
and “see if you are as sober as I am."
On resumption of sittings to-day, the
SPEAKER was approached with request
for advice on the matter. It was here
that the right honourable gentleman's
mind revealed its incorrigible blank-
IneSS.
“I must,” he said, “decline to admit
any knowledge of what has
occurred. The official re-
port is not yet published.
Reports in the newspapers
may or may not be reliable.
My mind is unaffected by
any account I may have
seen.”
No getting over that. So

time, and Clerk proceeded

THE MAY-FLY.
This interesting creature is to be
found in parts of Great Britain and in
certain of the United States of America.
Its favourite habitation, however, is the
Pas-de-Calais, the natives there giving
it the name of Peut-être.
By night it stays quietly within some
place of shelter, appearing only for brief
periods in the daytime. Its organism
is a frail one, and easily gets out of
order; but when it is in good health its
along the ground, at others a graceful
and its glistening wings make it a thing
of beauty. In the air its gambols are in
the form of circular flights of several
minutes' duration.
Though the May-fly exists on both
sides of the Channel, curiously enough
been known to cross
from one country to another up to the
time of writing. The strong winds pre-
vailing there may be the reason, for the
turbances other than a breeze of the
right strength from the right quarter—
a breeze that is very rare at this time of
the year. Other kinds render it exceed-
ingly shy and retiring.
The May-fly is very fond of news-
papers, an affection which is warmly
reciprocated.
Strong ambition and great courage,
tempered by caution, are the chief char-
acteristics of the creature. This last
quality is apt to interfere with its
plans; but, after all, the other qualities
are in the majority, and are likely to
prevail in the long fly.
From San Francisco comes the news
that the police have in their possession
a gentleman who has married ten widows
and is engaged to fourteen more. This
is carrying specialisation too far.
“Mayfair and Belgravia set the note which
is followed, of course, afar off in every gentile
suburb.”—-Standard.

This does not refer to Bayswater.
The following simple and explicit
directions are posted up in a hotel on
the Nordfjord —
“The fire escape!
Direction for use:
The one end of the rope is to be fixed
at the hook in the window frame, the
other is to turn out of the window. The
plaited snotter, which is fixed at the log
of wood, is to be put under your arms,
whereupon you may safely let yourself
slide down. You may regulate the
hurry by keeping the rope under the
log. If more persons are to be saved,
you have to pull up the contrary end of
the rope, fix this at the hook and go on
so till nobody is left.”
“There are forty bed-rooms, with hot and
cold water laid on, while one-half that delicate
attention is lavished on the putting greens of
the new course.”—Daily Graphic.
We are still in doubt as to which half
of the delicate attention is lavished-
whether the greens get forty bedrooms'
worth of either hot or cold, or twenty
bed-rooms' worth of both.

THE KELT.
THE youngest subaltern came in
behind the tea-tray and asked me the
usual first question , before we had
finished shaking hands.
“Do you fish?”
“Well, I have, you know,” I admitted,
“at bazaars—parcels with loops of string
on them, and all that.” -
“Then you haven't heard about me?”
“I really couldn't say. I've done
nothing but hear about people ever since
I've been in Ireland, and everybody seems
to be related to everybody else, either
through the Quinns of Killy—what-is-
it, or the Gores of Bally—something-or-
other, so if you happen in some way to be
a Gore or a Quinn, Mr. Smithson——”
The youngest subaltern sighed and
helped himself to potato cake. -
“I’m afraid not,” he said; “but you
can't think how I've enjoyed meeting
someone who doesn't know all about me.”
“You’re not a Channel-swimmer, are
you?” I asked hastily.
He shook his head.
“I have it then ; you've been flying.”
“I wish I had ' You know a fellow,
even in the Army, must have a hobby
for his few spare moments. In the
hunting season one could put in two or
three days a week with the hounds, but
now there's nothing to do but fish. I
did think of a motor once, but the
Budget came in and I took a fishing
instead. I thought it would be cheaper,
but I’m not so sure of it now. Well, I
fished for a month—Sundays too—and,
at last, I got a bite!”
His manner was full of suppressed
tragedy, and from an uneasy movement
of his tea-cup hand I saw that he would
have liked to pull his moustache. I was
glad he couldn't, for it was a mere
seedling, and I implored him to go on.
“It was a great moment. You never
felt such a beggar to pull—jerked the
line like a young cart-horse. I got quite
excited, and so did all the others.”
“The other fish 2 ''
“No, the other people. There were
lots of them—couldn't say how many—
jumping up and down, yelling ‘Sure
but the gentleman's met a fish.’ Seemed
to come up out of rabbit holes and from
behind bushes all over the place—like
special correspondents. There was some
red hair, and a squint, and a pair of
patched trol sers, I know; but I'm
hanged if I could say whether the
trousers and the squint went together,
or whether the hair belonged to them or
to another person who was tied together
with straw bands and bits of rope.”
“Gores or Quinns ?” I murmured.
“I think it was trousers who gaffed
him, and I know it was the squint who
squatted down beside him and said,
Sorr, he's a Kelt '''” -
1 *
“Ireland for the Irish again '"I ex-
claimed indignantly. “I hope you told
him that it didn't matter to you whether
the fish was a Kelt or a Pan-Anglican 2"
I meant to say “Syro-Phoenician,” but
the other word came more handy, and
he didn't seem to notice anything.
He shook his head sadly.
“You’re supposed to put all Kelts
back again into the river, it seems.
Well, mine wasn't a very—er-Keltic
Kelt, and it was my first fish, so I put it
into my basket instead.”
“What did the Gores say—I mean
the natives?”
“They were very kind and tried to
buck me up about it, but the man who
has the opposite fishing came along, and
he went dead against me. I suppose
you haven't met him yet? I forget his
name. Anyhow, he made money out of
bacon. He's one of your red-faced
sportsmen, chock-a-block with conceit.
Looks like a strutting turkey-cock!”
“Pride in his port, and all that?”
The youngest subaltern looked at me
peewishly for a moment.
“I don't know about his cellar—
never dined there myself; still, he's
full-blown—very. We had an inter-
change of compliments over the river–
I’m rather glad, now I come to think of
it, that the river was there. Had the
cheek to ask me if I’d ever hooked a
salmon before. As a matter of fact I
hadn't, or I shouldn't have been so keen
on keeping that fish—so I left him
bellowing on the bank. Jones and
Batherson were the only fellows in the
mess when I got back to barracks, and
neither of them knows a Jock Scott from
a—a—. Well, I was just telling them
how it feels to have a real beauty like
that on the end of your line, when into
the barrack yard comes the Colonel's
motor. He never does anything him-
self, you know ; he's a slummocker!”
“Esperanto ?” I asked faintly — it
sounded bad.
“‘Tommy’ for a lounger. He trots
into the mess, and the first thing he says
is, “Hello, Smithson, Mr. Hanrahan
(that's the bacon man's name) tells me
you killed a Kelt this afternoon. If
that's true, I wish you boys would be more
careful; I won't have this known as the
Cockney Brigade' Most unsportsman-
like ' ' And that's the sort of thing that
has gone on ever since. I've given up
fishing. If I go down to my stretch of
river, old Hanrahan comes up and asks
me how many Kelts I've got. Never
even talk of fishing now, but everybody
knows. Wherever I go I hear someone
saying, ‘That's the man who took a
Kelt!' Prettiest girl in the county,
barring her mouth, keen on fishing too,
wouldn't even look at me at the Regi-
mental Ball.”
“Well,” I said, rising, “it’s a masty
proverb to mention under the circum-
stances, but aren't there as many good
fish in the sea as ever came out 7”
“Oh, rather,” he assented ; “and, I
say, I have enjoyed your talking to me,
you know !”
ANOTHER NAVAL CRISIS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I have got myself
into trouble, trouble with a charge of
gunpowder at the end of it. Laugh
away, Mr. Punch Laugh away, and
do not stop laughing just because I add
that you have got yourself into the same
trouble, too.
You remember, though you may have
tried to forget, a jolly little poem of
mine about one Geoffrey Lovatt. It
appeared in your issue of July 7, and
dealt courageously with that gentleman's
high collars and want of manhood, mark-
ing the subjection in which his wife held
him. I have had it out with the wife,
my own dear sister, and referred her to
the Punch office, telling her that Mr.
Punch is responsible by the etiquette of
journalism, and that he's an excellent
target by the grace of nature. Take my
advice, Mr. Punch, and be out for some
years, because she is of a persevering
character and uncompanionable in her
off moods.
It does not, however, end there, for there
is this Geoffrey Lovatt to be reckoned
with. It happens that he is a sailor,
who, instead of sailing, boosts about the
home waters in a nasty submarine, carry-
ing with him two thoroughly unscru-
pulous torpedoes and a lot of warlike
enthusiasm. It also happens that there
is to be a naval review in the Thames,
and this G. L. informs me darkly that
he will be lying off Temple Pier with his
little thingummy, ready to settle accounts.
You in Bouverie Street and I in the
Temple are, I feel, much too accessible.
What shall we do? Shall we allow the
heart of the literary and legal world to
be blown nowhere, merely withdrawing
our two valuable selves inland before
the catastrophe? Or shall we take'our
chances 2 There is this about it, that
in order to fire upon us he will have to
get the bows of his submarine well out
of water, even on to the Embankment.
He is an ingenious fellow and imay
manage that, but, if he does, you and I
can always summons him for riding on
the footpath. :
That is our only hope, as far as I can
see. You may have rather a taste for
being in more than two places at once,
but personally I strongly disapprove of
being spread over London. So I say now
—and when I say a thing I mean it –
that, if this Geoffrey Lovatt persists in
his idea and blows me up, I shall never
speak to him again. t
Your indignant CoNTRIBUTOR.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 53
THE PICTURE COLLECTOR'S GUIDE.
The huge totals realised at certain of
the season's sales at CHRISTIE's are not
unnaturally turning the thoughts of
struggle-for-lifers towards art virtuosity
as a means of livelihood if not wealth.
A few hints to parents who are think-
ing of making their sons successful col-
lectors may not be out of place.
To those lacking capital the important
thing at the outset is to pick up a real
treasure for nothing and sell it advan-
tageously. It is the first step that counts.
To do this one should haunt the miscel-
laneous sale rooms, where many an Old
Master has been discovered in job lots
among carpets, safes and feather-beds.
Everything that is old and grimy was
not necessarily painted by MURILLO or
It exibn ANDT, RAPHAEL or TITIAN, but all
might have been. Remember that.
Remember that beneath the top picture
may always be another. If you buy a
genuine Rembrandt and, on scraping
it, find a portrait of WELLINGTON, stop
scraping at once.
Cultivate your voice. Many master-
pieces have been picked up for a mere
song, and it would be dreadful to have
no mere singing power when one was
offered to you. Cram your repertory
with mere songs.
Be wary. Remember that CoROT
painted nearly everything except the
canvases that bear his name.
When purchasing of a dealer always
look at the back of the picture first: it
inspires respect, and puts him off from
trying on his little games.
Bear in mind that a dealer's a dealer
for a’ that. He may wear clothes like
yourself and talk like you, and sustain
life in more or less the same way, but
mone the less he is a dealer.
Visit the National Gallery and learn
how the great artists painted. This will
make you the less likely to buy every
Rembrandt that is offered to you. Study
the difference between the styles of
PERUGINO and CROME.
Keep a photograph of the Holbein
Duchess on your wall. Let that be
your star. Some day, say to yourself,
I too will sell a picture to the nation.
THE CATS’ PAGEANT.
THE Dogs’ Pageant having been
arranged for, the Cats' is now under
consideration. Mr. Louis N. BARKER
having no special leaning towards this

will represent the origin of the cat.
According to the old legend there was
for a while no cat, nor was it missed.
But after a while the earth became more
populous and there were no longer as
many men as women, and an old maid
appeared; so the first cat was evolved
to keep her company. As in the case
of the dog the other animals contributed
to her devising, the tiger giving a
miniature of itself as a model. The
leopard gave litheness, and the panther
its spring, the fox cunning and the
dormouse sleepiness, the giraffe disdain
and the seamew its second syllable.
Thus was the cat made.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Howevelt kindly I may feel disposed to Miss DoRothea
CoNYERs, I am bound to believe that she wrote all the tales
published under her name in The Conrersion of Con Cregan,
and other Stories (HUTCHINSON). On the other hand I am
not bound to accept the numerous laudatory statements
on the outside pages as admissible evidence on her
behalf. Sitting as judge, I feel inclined to pass a severe
sentence of very penal servitude upon her for her plots and
to award her a gold medal and a birthday honour for her
atmospheres. She frivols without purpose in Ireland among
hunters and racers, Pats and
ever after. Of them, I much prefer the fascinating Biddy,
especially when she uses her influence over Fitzwater to
make him abolish cloak-room fees and provide drinkable
º in the theatre bars. So few heroines think of these
things.
To insist upon the defects of a book when one finds oneself
in sympathy with its motives is an ungracious task. Let me
say at once, then (and have done with grumbling), that
Hugh S. WALPole's The Wooden Horse (SMITH, ELDER) is not
without incongruities, and that the humour of title is too
arbitrary to be amusing. To those, however, who detest snob-
bery and abhorrigid conventionality this history of the Trojan
family will make an instant appeal. Upon his return to
Cornwallaſter an absence of twenty
“asthores,” and is natural and
charming. She busies herself
seriously in England with lost
wills, compromised débutantes and
impossible barristers, and is con-
ventional and horrid. At her worst.
she takes pages to solve childish
mysteries, which I, who have never
before known the joy even of sus-
pecting the guilty party, saw
through at once. At her best she
gets plenty of delightful fun out
of the schemes and loves (but
mostly the sport) of thoroughly
Irish Irishmen. Wherefore this
Court directs the public to read
The Conversion of Con Cregan and
most of the other stories, but binds
Miss CoNYERS over to keep the peace
and on no account ever again to
have anything to do with plots.

son, Robin, was a martyr to good
form. The Trojan rule was to
know the right people, to be
meticulously correct in speech and

think that this ends the book. Not a bit of it. We are now
introduced to Sir James Fitzwater, an opulent member of
the Hershman Syndicate, who, seeing that what has taken
place is really a first-class advertisement for the piece,
promptly revives it, with the dramatist's widow as leading
lady. Of course, the thing is a howling success, and sub-
sequently Biddy, the heroine, arranges to marry Fitzwater
on condition that he produces all her late husband's plays.
The arrangement is a little difficult to follow, and is com-
plicated by the reappearance of Gellion, who was only washed
down the river as far (apparently) as Germany, whence
he returns, under an alias, with a black beard and an
entirely new and original musical comedy. Subsequently
he rescues Fitzwater from a conflagration and gets his
false beard burned, and so dies, this time in his proper
person. The other characters, one supposes, live happy
into a combination of commercial traveller and news-
paper editor. Neither his store for the sale of shoes
(this was Mr. Opp's particular line of dry goods) nor his
paper, The Opp Eagle, attained the measure of success which
his virtues deserved. And, since his courtship also missed
the mark, Mr. Opp cannot truthfully be said to have made
what they call over there “a good thing” of his life. But
while the author debases him in every worldly way—and an
American who fails in business is debased indeed—she con-
trives to create in him a type of unselfish goodness which
should have a wide appeal. “Pity,” says CHAUCER, “runneth
soon in gentle heart,” and, since all readers are “gentle,”
Mr. Opp is sure of abundant sympathy for his misfortunes
and self-sacrifice. -

THE NEW RESISTANCE.
[A novel form of opposition is threatened on the part of mutinous
wives. The development is due to the success of certain Suffragettes
who, after being admitted to gaol of their own heroic choice, have
contrived by dint of fasting to prevail on Mr. HERBERT GLALSTONE to let
them out.]
No, Frederica, lºo; I may have knuckled
Under, at times, to woman's soft appeal.
But now I have my armour on and buckled ;
Tears cannot melt that tegument of steel ;
That which I’ve said I’ve said :
“You shall not wear a bec-hive on your head!”
I have allowed you loosely to conduct your
Home-life according to your lack of taste,
But to permit this pestilential structure
Would be to have my dignity displaced ;
Frankly I draw the line
At such a hat on any wife of mine.
When we exchanged our pledges at the altar
You undertook to honour and obey :
And though, ere now, I have been known to palter
With manhood's rights, this time I'll have my way ;
| lay the law down flat,
Saying, “You shall not wear a thing like that.”
Nor would it shake my purpose should you fºllow
The lead of Suffragettes that live on air,
Refusing, out of cussedness, to swallow
Your salutary meals. I shouldn't care
Two paltry jots or tittles
What attitude you took about your victuals.
You might adopt a course of strict starvation,
But you would never break my manly pride;
You might arrest the fount of sustentation
Till you were just a bag of bones and hide,
But that would not disturb
A man of stouter stuff than GLADSTONE (HERE.).
Believe me, I am anything but brutal;
I take no pleasure in a hollow cheek;
I could not get my heart to hum or tootle
If you were slowly waning week by week ;
But here I must be firm, -
()r I should show no better than a worm.
And, iſ you stuck to it and went on sinking
Until you failed to draw another breath,
Your widower would console himself with thinking
That there are tragedies far worse than deatl, .
Dishonour may be reckoned
The first of such, and your bee-hat the second.

THE RABBITS.
CHATTER WI.-IN AND OUT.
“WELL," said Thomas, “how are we
going to celebrate the joyful event?”
We were sitting on the lawn watching
Blair and Miss Fortescue play croquet.
Archie and Dahlia were not with us;
they had (I suppose) private matters to
discuss. Our match did not begin for
another hour, happily for the lovers; and
also for the croquet-players, who had
about fifty-six more hoops, posts, flags
and what not to negotiate.
“It’s awfully difficult to realise it,”
said Myra. “My own brother Just
fancy—I can hardly believe it.”
“I don't think there can be any
doubt,” I said. “Something's happened
to him anyhow—he's promised to put
me in first to-day.”
“Let’s have a dance to-morrow night,”
continued Thomas, relentlessly pursuing
his original idea. “And we'll all dance
with Miss Blair.”
“Yes, Archie would like that.”
“I remember some years ago when I
was in Spain,” said Simpson
“This,” I murmured appreciatively,
“ is how all the best stories begin.”
And I settled myself more comfortably
in my chair.
“No,” said Simpson, “I’m wrong
there. It was in Hampstead.” And he
returned to his meditations.
“Tell you what,” said Thomas, “you
ought to write 'em an ode, Simpson.”
“There's nothing that rhymes with
the lady.”
“There's hair,” I said, quite un-
intentionally.
“I meant with Dahlia.”
“My dear man, there are heaps. Why
there's azalea.”
“That's only one.”
“Well, there are lots of different kinds
of azalea.”
“Any rhymes for Archie and Man-
nering 2" said Simpson, scornfully.
“Certainly. And Simpson. You might
end with him—
“Forgive the way the metre limpson,
It's always like that with Samuel Simpson.'
You get the idea 2"
“Hush,” said Myra, “Miss Fortescue
has passed under a hoop.”
But it is time that we got on to my
innings. Archie managed to win the
toss, and, as he had promised, took me
in with him. It was the proudest and
most nervous moment of my life.
“I’ve never been in first before,” I
said, as we walked to the wickets. “Is
there any little etiquette to observe?”
“Oh rather. Especially if you're
going to take first ball.”
“Oh, there's no doubt about my
taking the first ball.”
“In that case the thing to remember
is that when the umpire calls ‘play' the
side refusing to play loses the match.”
“Then it all rests on me? Your con-
fidence in me must be immense. I
think I shall probably consent to play.”
I obtained guard and took my stand
at the wicket. Most cricketers nowa-
days, I am told, adopt the “two-eyed
stance,” but for myself I still stick to
the good old two-legged one. It seems
to me to be less wearing. My style, I
should observe, blends happily the dash
of a Joseph VINE with the patience of a
KENNETH HUTCIIINGs; and after a long
innings I find a glass of , I've for-
gotten the name of it now, but I know
I find it very refreshing.
Being the hero (you will admit that—
after my hat trick 2) of this true story,
I feel I must describe my innings
carefully. Though it only totalled seven-
teen, there was this to be said for it. It
is the only innings of seventeen ever
made by a hero.
It began with a cut to square-leg, for
which we ran a forced single, and fol-
lowed on with a brace of ones in the
direction of fine slip. After that I
stopped the bowler in the middle of his
run-up, and signalled to a spectator to
move away from the screen. This was
a put-up job with Myra, and I rather
hoped they would give me something
for it, but apparently they didn't. At
the end of the over I went up and
talked to Archie. In first-class cricket
the batsmen often do this, and it im-
presses the spectators immensely.
I said, “I bet you a shilling I'm out
next over.”
He said, “I won't take you.”
I said, “Then I huff you,” and went
back to my crease.
My next scoring-stroke was a two-eyed
hook over point's head, and then Archie
hit three fours running. I had another
short conversation with him, in the
course of which I recited two lines of
SHAKSPEARE, and asked him a small
but pointed conundrum, and afterwards
I placed the ball cleverly to mid-off, the
agility of the fieldsman, however, pre-
venting any increment, unearned or
otherwise. Finally I gave my cap to
the umpire, made some more ones,
changed my bat, and was caught at the
wicket.
“I hit it,” I said, as I walked away.
I said it to nobody in particular, but the
umpire refused to alter his decision.
“I congratulate you,” said Miss Blair,
when I was sitting down again.
“I was just going to do that to you,”
I said.
“Oh, but you were kind enough to do
that last night.”
“Ah, this is extra. I've just been
batting out there with your young man.
Perhaps you noticed 2’

“Thank you so much. You've known

“We were babes together, Madam.
At least, simultaneously. We actually

curly hair, and fought the captain on
the very first day. On the second day
his hair was still curly, but he had
black eyes. On the third day he got
into the cricket eleven, and on the

Afterwards he sang in the choir, and

THE SLAVES OF KICK-BALL.
[The following extract—of interest to all
British Sportsmen who have observed the
attitude of the Football Association towards the
Players' Union--is taken from an entertaining
pamphlet, “Slavery Amongst Foreign Devils,”
issued by the Society of the Pink Dragon, the
leading Chinese Anti-Slavery Society. It
follows immediately a paragraph concerning
the slaves who are subject to a feminine demon
named “Mrs. Grundy,” and it precedes an
eloquent denunciation of the injustices practised
by the mandarins of the Inland Revenue.]
“AND in this strange land of foreign
devils wondrous things happen. For,
driven by madness and poverty, certain
poor hirelings place themselves in an
enclosure before countless howling de-
mons and are set to kick one another
and also a ball. And behold when one
body of these poor hirelings kick ball
between certain sticks one-half of the
surrounding demons throw their head
covering in the air and behave in un-
seemly fashion. And when other hire-
lings kick ball through other posts more
demons do the like And at other times
all the demons join together and tear
asunder that hireling who is the spiritual
director of the kick-ball and plays reli-
gious music on a small instrument.
“Now all these ignorant white demons
bow down and worship a strange joss
which is known as the Football Ass, and
they acknowledge its rule and tremble.
For the Football Ass fixes the pay of the
hirelings and says, “No slave who kicks
ball shall receive more than four large
pieces of gold in one quarter moon.’
“And if a kick-ball hireling asks for
more then he is deprived of his wage
for ever. And if a master demon offers
his slave more and he taketh it—as is in
thenatureof man to do—then it is decreed
that the slave shall receive no more
money and shall no longer work at kick-
ball, and that the master shall conduct
kick-ball no more.
“And if a miserable slave desireth to
kick ball for another demon then must
he bow to the Football Ass and beseech
it humbly, saying, ‘Let thy contemptible
servant go hither or thither.' Then if
the slave be impotent or of little value
the Football Ass answers, “Go where
thou wilt.' But if he have good health
and feet of lightning and a head as
of iron, then the Football Ass answers
angrily, ‘Let him cleave to his master—
or otherwise let him be deprived of
subsistence.'
“And when the workers at kick-ball
joined together and said, ‘Shall we still
bow down to this beast which is but an
Ass?’ then the Ass brayed with fear and
said: ‘Let all kick-ballers be deprived
of their living. It is better that they
should starve and that there should be
no more work at kick-ball than that the
worship of the Football Ass should
cease.'

Story of the Merchant of Venice.
“There was a rich Jew living at
Venice and his was Shylock and he
married a wealthy woman named Portia
and Shylock had a son named Antonio
and Shylock wanted to take a pound of
flesh out of Antonio so Shylock had the
knife ready and just as he was going to
cut the flesh Shylock heard that An-
tonio's ships had been found by Portia
so Portia saved the life of Antonio Shy-
lock knew if he had done it he would
have to have shed blood. And the
merchant of Venice is sometimes known
as the Comedy of Errors or as we should
say the merry wives of Windsor and
while Shakespear was writing the Mer-
chant of Venice Bassanio and Lorenzo
were sitting by each of him Shakespear
was only a poor lad born on Stratford-
on-Avon and then he made his way to
London writing Poets and one day in
the year 1610 he heard the noisy theatres
in London.”

THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
Finst Aid To AMATEUR ARtists.
t’słFrL as the picture-postcard and
the camera undoubtedly are in assisting
the traveller to memorise his vacation
rambles, they do not of course compare
with the sketch, the personal record of
the scene. The shop at which the
picture-postcard is purchased—even the
pretty girl who sells it to us—how soon
we forget them | The circumstances of
the pressing of the button of the camera
—how fugitive they are! But, on the
other hand, how enduring are the memo-
ries of the pictures we painted or drew—
the harvesters that ate us as we worked,
the villagers that looked on, the cow
that breathed down our backs, the cold
we caught, the chill we contracted
These abide. Hence a lasting vividness
in our minds that marks out sketching
as the ideal record.
Everyone, however, cannot sketch.
Gifts and talents are distributed by
Nature with a thoughtlessness that is not
to be excused, and hence it is that the
most horrible and hairy men can play
the piano best, and artists can paint
while gentlemen cannot. This, of course,
is wrong, but none the less it must be
faced. How, then, is one to sketch if he
has no aptitude” The answer is that
the ingenuity of man must provide him
with the power.
Different countries, it will be noticed,
have different characteristics, strongly
pronounced. Holland, for example, is
flat ; Switzerland is lumpy. Flatness
calls for straight lines; lumpiness for
curves. A special T-square has there-
fore been prepared for sketchers in
Holland to form the groundwork—the
natural genius–of the country, upon
which even the veriest tyro can indicate
suſlicient life to convince his friends
that he has been there; and surely that
is the end of most travel? The accom-
panying illustrations show what can be

done with the addition of a pair of com-
passes (or a selection of coins) for clouds.
The trees, the mills and the tulips any
one can add.
If, however, the trees are felt to be
too difficult, it should be known that
Messrs. Eton and Poppin now have on
sale a series of zinc stencils, in varying
sizes, of no fewer than fifty trees, ranging
from the oak to the araucaria, and one
has merely to pencil them in where re-
quired according to scale, and then
either colour or leave blank. By seeing
them invariably against the setting sun
the necessity for colour (always a deli-
cate and tricky business) is obviated.
Turning to Switzerland, which is
lumpy, we find that extremely con-
vincing results can be obtained by
using one of the ordinary wooden curves
that are to be found in all well-fur-
mished boxes of compasses. With a
little adaptation and twisting, the Alps
can be completely mastered—as in the

of châlets and firs is a detail. If, how-
ever, cows are wanted Messrs. Eton and
Poppin sell stencils of these also, and
indeed of all the animals to which the
sketcher is liable — from the smallest
size to life-size.
Another favourite country for the
tourist and amateur artist is Egypt,
which is, as a moment's thought will
tell, the land of the Pyramids. Here,
then, all is simple, for with an ordinary
set-square the tombs of the Pharaohs
are yours — as our picture indicates.

Care must, however, be taken to re-
member to omit the hole in the middle.

kind of sea. The two that are illustrated

belong to comparatively quiet weather;
but storms are catered for also.
Finally it should be pointed out, for
the benefit of those who wish their
sketches to serve not only as memoria
technica but also as ornaments and ob-
jects of admiration to their friends, and
to be worthy of gilt frames, that Messrs.
Eton and Poppin not only undertake to
furnish crude designs, but also supply
beautifully coloured scenes, or rather
scenarios, of every variety, for every
country, upon which the tourist may
do as little work as need be before
adding the name of the place and the
date and the signature.
That is one way. For those who find
the finishing of a picture irksome and
difficult the firm comes to the rescue
with a competent staff of accomplished
artists, who undertake this mechanical
part of the work for a small fee. The
unfinished drawing should be accom-
panied by notes, written or drawn, by
picture-postcards or extracts from guide-
books, to assist these useful allies in
completing the pictures faithfully. The
original sketcher then appends his sig-
nature, and the picture is ready for its
frame and the plaudits of his acquaint-
ance.

him of his awful suspense about the

CO-OPERATION INVITED.
I.
KNow all men by these presents that
I have invented a new way of telling a
funny story. I have carried out my
invention in detail, and the framework
for the article is complete, having been
typed, punctuated, and (in places) cor-
rectly spelt under my personal super-
vision. All that remains is to provide
the funny story.
Now, though I have given this matter
my mature consideration, no comic
episode will suggest itself. In vain I
have devoted half-an-hour's consecutive
thought to each of the following topics:
—(1) Choleric Colonels, (2) Nouveaux
Riches, (3) American Exaggerators, and
(4) Weary Parents oppressed by the
Late Departure of a Daughter's Possible
Fiancé. I have therefore determined
to invite extraneous assistance, and to
appeal to a generous public.
II.
The family have become permanently
obsessed by melancholy ever since
demanded from them a funny story.
They can think of nothing but pathetic
incidents concerning the life of the very
poor, and railway accidents. In his one
lucid interval my brother has evolved
this little poem:—
“You’ve often heard it said that you
Work like a horse. This may be true.
The same remark may also be
Applied to me as truthfully.
In either case the point, of course,
Depends upon what kind of horse.”
I presented my compliments, but re-
gretted that I was unable to accept his
contribution.
III.
I have two uncles, the one famous, the
other notorious, as a raconteur. Uncle
No. 1 was ready to oblige, but confessed
upon cross-examination that he relied en-
tirely upon my editor's paper for his sup-
ply of funny stories. Uncle No. 2 related
an incident touching the infant child of
his sister-in-law. I laughed with such
respect that he felt bound to justify him-
self by explaining that what made it so
funny was the way the infant child of
his sister-in-law said it.
IV.
All my friends know heaps and heaps
of stories, but have forgotten them all.
Three only have shown themselves to
I|possess good sound memories and have
recollected one story apiece. As it hap-
pens, it is the same story. My English
friend tells it to show how the English-
man scored off the Scotchman. My Scotch
friend tells it to show how the Scotch-
man scored off the Englishman. My
Irish friend tells it to show how the
Irishman scored off them both. I am
glad to say that I have forgotten that
story myself.
W.
The last hope is with you, O reader.
I formally call upon you to produce a
funny story, for me to tell you in the
new way I have invented. This, more-
over, is to give you notice that, unless
within ten days from this date (whatever
it may be) you comply with my request
and deposit at the Punch Office an
envelope containing the said funny story
and addressed “Wants Department—
Destitute Contributor,” you will forfeit
the pleasure of reading the article,
which, as far as the framework at any
rate is concerned, has been typed,
punctuated, and (as far as possible)
correctly spelt under my personal super-
vision.

THE CENSORSHIP AGAIN.
The following communications seem
to be intended for the Royal Commission
on the Dramatic Censorship. Perhaps
they will be read by its members.
Mr. HARRY LAUDER: So far from
abandoning the Censor, I would give
him far more power: until, in fact, he
made the theatre as moral and enlight-
ening as the music-hall. As it is, you
may search the music-halls far and near
for a suggestive or even vulgar thing,
whereas go into the first theatre you
come to—the Duke of York's, for example
—and you see a man who is married
making love to a single woman. Man,
it's awſu'. If I were the Censor I would
stop that. I would not allow a fact ever
to get on to the stage.
A CoNSTANT SUBSCRIBER: What we
really want is more censorship, not less.
We want, for example, a Press Censor
as well. Every editor should be forced
to submit his paper to the Lord Chamber-
lain's office before going to press. Then
not only would the divorce reports be
deleted, but such offensive and unhealthy
cocksureness as you find in Mr. BERNARD
SHAW's letters would vanish too. Of

course the Lord CHAMBERLAIN himself
would not find time to read so much
between 12 and 3 A.M., but he would
probably experience little difficulty in
finding a staff of efficient helpers equal
in mental calibre to Mr. REDFord.
The PROPRIETOR of The St. JAMEs's
The ATRE: How could I oppose the Censor
when he came to me for his first two
names A man is not called GEORGE
ALEXANDER REDFord for nothing.
Mr. EUSTACE MILES: There should cer-
tainly be a Censor for restaurants. Every
menu, both for lunch and dinner, should
be submitted to him early in the day,
and he should cut out the indigestible
things. Only thus can you get a moral
and efficient people.
G. B. S.: My last word on the subject
is this: Swing the Censor.
The following passage from a Scotch
paper appears to point to the growth of
the Woman's Suffrage movement among
the journalists of the North :—
“The reason for the decadence of tandem-
cycling is probably due to the fact that, except
in the case of husband and wife, it is not
always easy to find two men who are likely to
be cycling together."

O so ME they likes the country-side,

An' some they fancies the crowded streets
An' the noisy bustlin' town;
But give to me the clean salt smell
Of the tumblin', tossin' sea,
With an honest ship beneath my feet
An' the wind a-blowin' free.
O some they takes a pride an' joy
In drivin' a furrow straight,
An' some they hustles a motor-car
At a rattlin', murderin' rate;
But give to me the staunch, stout wheel
Of a ship as knows my 'and,
An' feels 'er way across the sea
To an unseen far-off land.
O some they lies when life is done
'Neath quiet grass-grown mounds,
An' some they as to take their rest
In the close-packed city grounds;
But give to me, when my time comes,
And I no more may roam,
To be dropt o'erboard in my shotted
shroud
That the sea may take me home.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 19.
—Twenty-five minutes after SPEAKER
took the Chair sitting threatened to
collapse. There were seventy-three
Questions on the Paper, sufficient to
keep things going through allotted
period. But it happened that in some
cases the Minister addressed was not in
his place. In others the enquiring Mem-
ber had not arrived. Having in vain
endeavoured to effect the Parliamentary
process of “joining the flats,” the SPEAKER
desisted. Awkward pause followed. In-
genious Member of Opposition seized
opportunity to move that the House do
now adjourn. SPEAKER ignored motion :
if deadlock continued it might be put
again.
Mr. WEIR came to the rescue. Had
on paper a cluster of Questions addressed
to Lord Advocate. Was not in his place
when the first was called on. A Ques-
tion, when passed over, would not in ordi-
mary course be dealt with till the list had
been gone through. Mr. WEIR, step-
ping into imminent deadly breach, sug-
gested that his catechism might be
taken forthwith. SPEAKER
gladly consented. Lond ADVO-
CATE, pleading the privileges
and responsibilities of a family
man, elbowed the SolicitoR-
GENERAL (Scotland) to the
front. When he answers Mr.
WEIR in person he strategi-
cally places himself in laager
at the end of the bench. The
innocent, unwary SolicitoR-
GENERAL–or was it the des-
peration of a hunted man 2–
rose from the Gangway-end
of the bench, under imme-
diate influence of Mr. WFIR's
piercing glance.
This discipline not the least
severe portion of the ordeal
undergone by the Minister.
Having read the number of
his Question with the assist-
ance of pince-nez truculently
set astride his nose, Mr. WEIR
does not accept its aid when
fixing the guilty Minister with
stony stare. He peers at him
over the glasses; a trivial
detail to mention in print, but
indescribably awesome in its
effect. Lord Advoc ATE is
accustomed to take refuge in
silence when Mr. WEIR puts
supplementary questions re-
garding the learned Lord's
alleged iniquities in the High-
lands. In such case you
should hear the blood-curd-
ling comment, “No answer.”

And thus John DiLLON ; only his pur-
pose is to “serve him out.” It appears
his Grace has been writing a letter to
Unionist candidate in pending election
in Derbyshire. This J. D. denounces as
infringement of liberties of the House,
and moves reference of case to Com-
mittee of Privileges.
Shade of JEMMY LOWTHER, if within
sight and hearing, will chuckle over
this vindication of his annual action
whilst yet with us in the flesh. When,
at opening of Session, Standing Orders
were read, including one for-
bidding Peers to meddle with
elections to House of Com-
mons, JEMMY was accustomed
to move its abrogation. Ar-
gued that it was habitually
disregarded, its solemn asseve-
ration through succeeding
Sessions partaking of charac-
ter of farce. Asquith, having,
as he admitted, on one occa-
sion voted with JEMMY, on
another against him, brought
to fresh consideration of ques-
tion singularly unbiassed
mind. Supported motion for
reference.
PRINCE ARTHUR poured con-
tumely and scorn on the whole
business.
If, he said, PREMIER and
majority thought it wise to go
through formality of sending
this matter to Committee of
Privileges he did not believe
anybody would greatly con-
cern himself one way or the
other.
“Right hon. gentlemen op-
posite,” he added, bestowing
withering glance on CHANCEL-
LoR of Exchequeſt, “would do

vanished from the Parlia-

mise as “the Bar” is a strip
of leather sewn on to the

he described as “the vener-

MUSICAL JOTTINGS.
The artistic value of strikes has
hitherto escaped the attention of econo-
mists, who have been unduly preoccupied
by their industrial influence. But this
aspect of labour troubles can no longer
be overlooked in view of what has
happened at the Paris Conservatoire,
Le Moxie DE WATTEAU.
(Mr. Alfred Mond.)
where a musical postman recently won
the first prize for singing in opera,
having learned an entire score by heart
during the leisure given him by the
recent strike.
This notable incident has not escaped
the acute and sympathetic intelligence
of the PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE,
who has resolved to extend his scheme
of Labour Exchanges so as to provide
for the establishment of a staff of
professors at every industrial centre
for the instruction of the genuine un-
employed in harmony, counterpoint,
and orchestration. In many cases, no
doubt, the students, after a few weeks'
study, will resume their normal vo-
cations. But where exceptional talent
is shown they will be encouraged, by
scholarships and exhibitions, to persevere
in a profession notoriously understocked
ample, as Madame TETRAzzIN1, Signor
CARUso and Herr LEHAR, the composer
of The Merry Widow.
The PRESIDENT of THE BoARD of TRADE,
however, does not intend that the fortu-
nate beneficiaries of State musical in-
struction shall reap the entire profit of
the advantages gratuitously placed at
their disposal. He therefore proposes
to get his friend Mr. Lloyd-GeoRGE to
impose a small brain tax of 20 per cent.
on their earnings, as well as a royalty
of 30 per cent. on latent and unde-
veloped melodies on the basis of a
valuation to be conducted
every five years by Special
Commissioners of the Board
of Inland Revenue. With the
receipts from these duties he
hopes to pay the salaries of the
State professors and to defray
the cost of the scholarships,
thus placing his scheme on a
self-supporting basis. These
proposals, we regret to say,
have met with a curiously
mixed reception from the
Labour Party, amongst whom
the tax on ungotten melodies
is extremely unpopular. Sir
Robert PERKs, again, has

DEAREST DAPHNE,-Trying to make
the best of things lately, some of us
have been having rain-parties, at which
there lave been umbrella-dances and a
prize for the snappiest rain get-up.
And what has been our reward, I'll ask
you, for so nobly striving against such
beastly circs?–Why, whenever the sun
has put in an appearance, it's been for
the express purpose of spoiling a rain-
party'
-:Stella Clackmannan has caught the
amateur society dramatist fever, and
written a modern play with all the
proper ingredients, the Husband and
the Wife, and the Other Man and the
Other Woman, and some people to go
in and out and talk, and lots of frocks,
and interiors by Frettow and Gilder,
and a good sprinkling of aphorisms.
The frocks are very well done, and
the subtle dif. in cut and trimming
that there should always be between the
Wife's frocks and the Other Woman's
is cleverly marked. As for the aphor-
isms, Beryl Clarges says the definition
of one's oldest friend as “the witness
who could give the most damaging
evidence" is hers, that she said it
one night at Bosh and Wee-Wee's, and
she feels so strongly about it that she
took a stage-box at the Mayfair on
purpose to bow when the definition got
a laugh.
At my last Sunday Afternoon I had
Miss Singleton, the Champion of Celi-
bacy, to give one of her lecture-chats,
“Our Destiny and Their Enormities.”
It was great fun. We've got used to
the people who spell woman with a
big W, but to spell spinster with a
big S, as this brave woman does, is
really a new departure, and by way of
being a heroic one. She scorns the idea
of playing ivy to any man's oak, and
seems honestly to think the very best
thing that can happen to a woman is to
be left all alone by herself for ever and
ever, Amen.
About the biggest sensation of the
season has been Etheldreda Saxonbury's
runaway match with the Duke of Middle-
shire, and the way it was brought about.
The Toppingtowers were too stomy to
come to town this summer, and also too
much affaissés at their son, Portcullis,
having married Lil Lilton, “The Girl
from Nowhere,” you know, at the Funni-
ment Theatre. It would never have done,
however, to let all the girls rusticate
(two already published, and three more
in MS.), so Etheldreda and Edelfleda
have been going about with their great-
aunt, Popsy, Lady Ramsgate. And
Popsy swore by all her gods she'd have
one of them Duchess of Middleshire
before the season ended. (The Duke,
please note en passant, had just re-
turned from a three years' big game
hunting trip, and hadn't met either of
the Saxonbury's since they came out.)
Popsy's a clever old girl, whatever else
she may be, and she said to me: “It's
no soft job I've taken on, Blanche, mind
that. Etheldreda's a beauty and one

of the best amateur step-dancers of the
day, as you know—but what then 2 All
our boys are going to the Stage for their
wives, and parlour tricks simply don't
count! Etheldreda's step-dancing 's
better than half the stuff they see at
the Funniment and the Sans-Souci, but
the light foot's no good without the
foot-lights' - The few men who can be
coaxed to parties dance or sit out with
you young married women. ... As for
young Middleshire, he cries off parties
altogether (the girls haven't even met
him yet) and haunts the Halls and the
Musical Comedies. However, I’ve sworn
to make him my great-nephew-in-law, so
it’s got to be done.” -- . -
Soon after this, Popsy, Lady R., made
it up with Portcullis and his “Girl from
Nowhere,” and struck up a furious friend-
ship with Wiscountess Lil, who, be it
remembered, reigns supreme at the
Funniment, and does as she likes there.
Soon after that, a new girl, Miss Dolly
Darling, appeared in a small part in
The Girl from Nowhere, and made a big
hit with her step-dancing, completely
knocking over, amongst others, the Duke
of Middleshire, who haunted the theatre
more than ever, pelted her with flowers,
sweets, and stones (precious), and at last
wound up his attentions with a sugges-
tion of a special licence and immediate
marriage. - * ,
And then, my dear, Middleshire got a
facer | Instead of having done the cor-
rect and regular thing, and proposed to
make a duchess of little Dolly Darling of
the Funniment, whose mother, he'd
been given to understand, had kept a
whelk-stall in Commercial Road, he
found he’d laid his hand, his heart, and
his strawberry-leaves at the feet of
Etheldreda Saxonbury, “daughter of a
hundred earls,” as SHAKSPEARE says, and
directly descended from - HENGIST and
HoRSA He was frightfully disenchanted
at first, I believe, but he got reconciled
to it, and they had their stolen wedding
just as if she'd been the real thing.
The Toppingtowers family have grate-
fully taken The Girl from Nowhere

recognised she promises to do her best

CoMMENTING on the enhanced price of
human hair, as evidenced at the recent

lishes a truly alarmist article to the
effect that “this rise has been caused
by the increased size of our hats, which
necessitates an extra supply of hair so
as to offer a proper basis to the new
structures. Moreover, the young French
peasant girls are less anxious to part
with their tresses; and the dealers in
hair are unable to cope with the demand
made upon them. The crisis is attain-
ing huge proportions, and wearers of

The matter is indeed serious. We have
trustworthy information from behind the
screens in coiſture circles that a huge
combine has this week been engineered
by the Hair Kings of Bond Street, and
that the capillary crop of 1910–11, has
already been cornered. One astute oper-
ator in the ring, with bullish proclivities
and a strong hat-making connection, has
ear-marked the following season's 'out-
put, completely routing a group of .

for the discovery and purchase of early-
Victorian sofas, the stuffing of which
by a secret process will be rendered

In these circumstances it is becoming
more and more evident that the ordinary
beauty will have to be content to draw
us with a single hair, or at most
with two or three. With the impending
shortage there won't be enough to go
round. . We think that the Suffragettes,
in their eager desire for martyrdom and
masculinity, might help to relieve the
hair-famine by parting with their
crowning glory (or is it disgrace?) in

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
AIRSHIPS FOR ALL.
It has long been felt that aeronautical
science is being hampered by an over-
rigid adherence to a particular type of
machine. Happily a new departure on
sound lines has been taken by a Dresden
student, who has invented an entirely
new type, and his excellent example has
been so freely followed that a whole
crop of new flying machines is now
being put on the market.
To begin with, the world of fiction
has been agreeably exhilarated by the
simultaneous announcement, from Strat-
ford-on-Avon and the Isle of Man, of the
patenting of two new types of flying
machine. The first, which belongs to
the dirigible type, is a huge sausage-
shaped bag of gold-beater's skin inflated
with the most intoxicating vapours, en-
cased in a framework of chiffon and
drawn by a team of eight swans. The
second, which is made entirely of bamboo
and canvas, is called an aerocane after
its inventor, and is kept afloat simply
by the automatic distension of his superb
cerebellum. A large and influential
company is already being formed for
the exploitation of the invention, including
Mr. Roland Blatherwayt, the illustrious
interviewer, and other pioneers of en-
lightened publicity.
Next an extraordinarily interesting
type of flying machine is that invented
by Mr. AUGUSTE VAN BIENE, the famous
'cellist, of “Broken Melody.” ſame. Mr.
WAN BIENE, as our readers are doubtless
aware, recently introduced the new
Auxeto 'Cello invented by the Hon.
CHARLES PARSONS, and he has applied
the same principle to his flying machine,
which is of the nature of a dirigible
double-bass. Directly the bow touches
the strings the instrument soars aloft,
uttering seraphic strains, the aeronaut
being kept in position by a gyroscope,
which is concealed in the bridge. Mr.
VAN BIENE, who is fully booked up to the
year 1914, hopes after that date to give
more time to the development of his
patent, with a view to establishing a
London Flying Symphony orchestra,
which shall bring the advantages of the
“Broken Melody” within the reach of
the benighted denizens of Siberia,
Saghalien, and Tierra del Fuego.
It is impossible any longer to disguise
the fact that Professor Sir Ugo von
Aircomber has invented an entirely un-
suspected and original type of flying
machine. The motive power being a
peculiar mixture of explosive oils, ac-
cording to a recipe of LEONARDO DAVINCI,
the aeronaut is in the happy position of
being able to use the waste for artistic
purposes and to paint while he flies,
| as the engine is a Brush patent fitted
with cross-hatching gear, running at the
rate of 15,000 revolutions per minute.

cLERGYMAN, BUT NELSoN waxTED TO BE A SAILOR-AND HE DID BE.”
While flying over Bushey last week the
inventor took several aerial portraits of
his neighbours, in which the fore-
shortening is conveyed with masterly
effect. The machine is to be exhibited
to the Regent of Bavaria next Monday,
and a company is to be formed by the
Bavarian Highlanders for the exploitation
of the invention.
Lastly, the Archdeacon of LONDON, who
has long been known as a first-rate
mechanic, has taken out a patent for an
invention to which he has given the
engaging name of The Sinclairoplane.
Unlike Mr. WiLBUR WRIGHT's machine,
The Sinclairoplane is worked by wings
beautifully designed so as to suggest
angel's pinions, and the operator sits in
a seat which conveys a dignified sug-
gestion of a pulpit, while allowing his
gaiters to be distinctly visible. A com-
pany composed exclusively of rural
deans is in process of formation for the
exploitation of the invention, which is
said to be admirably adapted for country
congregations.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE exists a tendency in the modern stage to which
critics have given the name of underplaying. I think some-
body ought to warn Mr. Thomas CoBB that there lies an equal
danger in what, if the word had not already another use,
one might call underwriting. For example, Mr. Burn-
side's Responsibility (MILLS AND Boox) contains a number of
agreeable ladies and gentlemen whose acts and conversations
so successfully avoid the melodramatic that it is sometimes
difficult to discover any significance or interest in them at all.
Yet the main idea of the story is promising enough—the
question whether an innocent young man, with whom a
featherbrained young wife has become so infatuated as to
drive her husband to suicide, is under a moral obligation to
offer her re-marriage. Unfortunately, both Primula Tuson
and Raymond Burnside are so faintly drawn that their future
creates only the mildest curiosity. Even when poor Tuson
that the government of England is in the hands of a certain
ruling set—aristocrats only in the debased modern sense.
The second is (I fancy) that the power behind the
SPEAKER's chair—behind the front benches, rather—is an
Israelitish one. And the third is, of course, that almost any-
one can have a title who cares to pay for it. There is just
enough of truth in all these premisses to give point to
Mr. BELLoc's satirical conclusions; and for this reason I can
confidently recommend his latest gibe, A Change in the
Cabinet (METHUEN), to everybody who admits to possessing a
sense of humour. The story is concerned chiefly with the
adventures of Sir Charles Repton, the Minister, and “Dimmy,”
the awkward but promising young man of the party, who
fell down on the occasion of his only speech in the House,
but afterwards acquired a growing reputation at Question-
time. I believe in Dimmy entirely. He had also a delightful
adventure at sea, where he was mistaken for a stowaway. I
particularly liked this part of the book, and I implore
Mr. BELLoc to let his next story be one of derring-do through-
out. He would do it delightfully, and I think he should ;
takes his overdose, the
tragedy of it quite fails to
move us, for the reason, I
fancy, that Mr. Cobb himself
was equally unconcerned.
Of course Burnside declares
that he is ready to marry
Primula, and, equally of
course (in the last chapter),
she chooses independence,
and leaves him free to men-
tion his somewhat placid
passion for Drusilla. Pro-
bably Mr. Cobb's numerous
admirers will welcome Mr.
Burnside's Responsibility the
more because it comes at a
season when they can leave
their own at home; it is an
excellent example of what

Among the treats I’ve held in store

Was an intention to explore
The merits of the Antipodes;

In value to the atmosphere.
That has the stamp of one who's tried
Its taste by actual inhalation,
And knows how much should be supplied
For other people's delectation.
Mr. H. BELLOC is a man of three convictions. The first is
point-blank to fall in with her scheme, and when Phoebe in a
fit of pique engaged herself to a foolish boy, she continued'
patiently to hope that one day she would run her quarry to
ground. At first the odds seemed all against her. Henry
departed for the Continent in search of a wife, and in order,
as he said, to insure Phoebe's happiness with her boy lover
by making it impossible for Isabel to look upon him any
longer as her potential husband. Failing in his quest he
came back pretending that he had been successful. But
still Isabel lay low and said nothing, till suddenly Phoebe
saved the situation and herself by breaking off her
engagement, and Isabel's pertinacity received its due reward.
It is a pretty little comedy of human emotions, told in a
quietly humorous style which makes the reading of it a
genuine pleasure, modified in my own case by the reflection
that I number several Isabels amongst my female relatives.

“We offer £20 if we fail to transmit any

There ought to be a fairish field of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PICTURE PUZZLE.
“What 's this 2° said Betty. “A
cow’s tail?”
“Or a pump-handle?”
“Or a boy-scout's alpenstock 2"
“Or the South Pole?”
“I expect you're all of you right,”
said Billy Darton; “but, if you ask me,
I should say it might be a bit of bamboo
—something Japanese-part of a light
building, for instance. What's the pic-
ture supposed to be about?”
“Fancy our neverlooking at the title,”
said Betty. “Here it is. Street Scene in
Yokohama. I’m sure Mr. Darton must
be right. How clerer of you to guess a
thing like that, Mr. Darton'."
“Not at all; not at all,” said Billy
modestly.
“Well now,” I said, “we’ve got a
bamboo pole, and two ſaces, and three
pairs of feet. What shall we do with
the extra pair 2"
“Do you think the faces might be
Manx, and have three feet apiece.”
“But it says Yokohama.”
“I suppose that is against it.”
“Perhaps the third face is turned
away,” said Billy very tentatively.
“This blob of hair, now—mightn't that
be its back view º'
“But of course 1" cried Betty. “How
brilliant you are, Mr. Darton.”
I couldn't remember to have ever heard
this epithet applied to Billy—not, at
least, on the score of intelligence, though
he is quite good at nursery cannons.
Billy is one of those nice clean young
fellows who seem to get along quite
comfortably, thank you, without any
particular brains, and contrive, for some
obscure reason, to exert a strange fascina-
tion upon sweet innocent natures like
Betty's.
“Have you noticed,” Mrs. Carstairs
had recently confided in me, “that our
dear girl seems to attract poor young
Mr. Darton. I do hope nothing serious
will come of it. The General and I
feel most strongly that it should be
discouraged. You see, Mr. Darton has
very little beyond his subaltern's pay,
and no prospects; and I'm told there
isn't any chance of a career in the Army
nowadays unless you have brains.
Things have sadly changed. It was
very different in the General's time.”
“There is still an opening,” I said,
“for physical prowess in the Service.”
“Ah,” said Mrs. Carstairs, “ but you
can never count on having a war. Besides
there's always a certain risk attached to
fighting, isn't there 2"
“I don't see how this piece of dress
comes in,” said Betty; “it’s not a bit
like the rest of her.”
“Perhaps she's been sitting on a sofa,
and one of the cushions came away with
her when she got up.”
“I think mosaics are so interesting,”
said Mrs. Carstairs. “Have you seen the
ones they have in St. Mark's at Venice,
Mr. Postlethwaite 2 º’
“I am deferring that pleasure,” replied
the Curate, “until the Campanile has
been restored.”
“Quite right, quite right,” said the
General. “But it can never be the same
thing.”
“I have an inspiration,” said Billy.
“Mightn't it be one of those things that
Japanese women wear at the back of
their waists?”
“Of course, of course,” cried Betty
in generous admiration. “Really, Mr.
Darton, you are too splendid ' "
“Oh, it's nothing,” said Billy ; “just
a knack.”
“Ever tried the War-game, Darton 2''
asked the General on a note of unusual
respect. “Since my time, you know.
German invention. What's their name
for it 2 Krigspill, or some such bar-
barism.”
“No, sir; can't say I've ever played
it,” said Billy; “I should like to try my
hand at it.”
“Oh, he'd pick it up at once,” said
Betty. “And I shouldn't care to be the
enemy if he gets to play it like he plays
Jigsaw. I never saw anything so mar-
vellous. But to business. We've got
to fill in that yawning chasm over the
head of the Jap man.”
“Perhaps it's a bit of background.”
“You can't have background cutting
off half his head.”
“He may have lost the other half at
Port Arthur.”
“What about this donkey-pannier *
you've got to find a place for that. Why
not try it on his head º'
“But it won't go. It's broad at the
top and narrow at the bottom—just the
opposite of the gap.”
“I suppose,” said Billy, “it couldn't
possibly be one of those straw-hats the
Japanese johnnies wear-like a bee-hive?
You might just turn the thing upside
down and see if it goes.”
“Well, I'm jigsawed,” cried Betty.
“You’re simply beyond everything, Mr.
Darton. Father, we’ve been entertain-
ing a genius unaware.”
“Bravo, Darton " " said the General.
“Thank you, Sir,” said Billy.
::: ::: :::
. That was Saturday night, and by the
following evening Billy had achieved a
still greater quest. He broke it to me
next morning in the Carstairs motor on
the way to the station.
“My dear boy,” I cried, “a thousand
congratulations. She's a charming girl,
and you thoroughly deserve her. Beauty
at the prow and brains at the helm—a
perfect combination. Parents agreeable
and all that 2' -
“Went better than I expected,” said
Billy. “Afraid they might buck a bit
owing to my— well, the fact is they
used to think rather poorly of my intelli-
gence. But now they tell me they’ve
mo hesitation in trusting Betty to me, as
they're sure I have a career before me.”
“No wonder,” I said, “aſter your
record performance with the puzzle.
You surpassed yourself.”
“Pretty good, wasn't it?” said Billy.
“But I don't mind telling you now,
strictly between ourselves, that that
puzzle was a plant.”
“A plant ' " I cried.
a plant?”
“Sort of a daisy,” said Billy. “I
brought it down myself on Saturday.
Man in the regiment showed me how it
went, and I did it over and over scores
of times, till I knew it by heart.”
“And you were dishonourable enough
to impose on that sweet girl's innocence
and credulity? Oh, Billy' "
“You wrong me, old man,” he replied.
“As thingummy said, ‘I could not love
the dear so much, loved I not honour
more ' ' ''
“But you deceived her,” I insisted.
“You led her to suppose that you were
a genius. Is that your idea of conduct
befitting an officer and a gentleman * *
“Dear old chap,” said Billy, “ you
don't understand. I’m not clever enough
for that. The plant was her own notion,
bless her.” (). S.

Still his fondest recollections cluster,
For on this he fixed his dreaming

FVERYTHING that is possible having now

or above, The Morning Surprise has
decided to offer a prize of £1,000 to the
first person, man, woman, or suffragette,
who succeeds in walking on its bed from
Dover to Calais or from Calais to Dover.
The conditions are of the simplest.
Forty-eight hours' notice must be given,

satisfaction of The Surprise that he has

way or other. It's a bore, I tell you.

great boots. This, Sir, is going too far.
I ask you to stop it. The CILANNEL.
Meanwhile the name of a competitor
was received, a M. Trotter, a French
subject of English parentage. M. Trotter
was the expert pedestrian attached to
the firm of Lepitapatte, the famous boot-
makers, and M. Lepitapatte accompanied
him to Calais to superintend the great
essay. Interviewers at once got to work.

his head when he dips his finger into

thinks of the rocks at the bottom. There

THE RABBITS.
CHAPTER VII.—ALL OVER.
“May I have a dance 2 ” I asked Miss
Blair.
She put her head on one side and
considered.
“One, two, three—the next but fire,”
she said.
“Thank you.
it only one 2'' -
“You may have two running then, if
you like.” -
“What about two running, and one
hopping, and one really gliding 2 Four
altogether.”
“We'll see,” said Miss Blair gravely.
Myra, who was being very busy, came
up and dragged me away.
“I want to introduce you to somebody.
I say, have you seen Thomas?”
“It’s no earthly good introducing me
to Thomas again.”
“He’s so important, because he thinks
the dance was his idea; of course I’d
meant to have it all along. There she is
—her name's Dora Dalton. I think it's
Dora.”
“I shall call her Dora anyhow.”
I was introduced, and we had a very
jolly waltz together. She danced de-
lightfully; and when we had found a
comfortable corner she began to talk.
She said, “Do you play cricket 2'
I was rather surprised, but I kept
quite cool, and said, “Yes.”
“My brother's very fond of it. He
is very good too. He was playing here
yesterday against Mr. Mannering's team,
and made six, and then the umpire gave
him out; but he wasn't out really, and
he was very angry. I don't wonder, do
you?”
I had a sudden horrible suspicion.
“Did you say your name was Dora—
I mean his name was Dalton P’’
“Yes. And just because he was
angry, which anybody would be, the
wicket-keeper was very rude and told
him to go home and — and bake his
head.”
“Not bake,” I said gently, my sus-
picions having now become almost a
certainty. “ Boil.”
“Go home and boil his head,” she
repeated indignantly.
“And did he 2''
“I)id he what?”
“ Er—did he understand — I mean
don't you think your brother may have
misunderstood 2 I can't believe that a
wicket-keeper would ever demean him-
self by using the word “boil.” Not as
you might say boil. ‘Cool his head
was probably the expression—it was a
very hot day, I remember. And . . .
ah, there's the music beginning again.
Shall we go back º’’
I am afraid Miss Dalton's version of
the incident was not quite accurate.
That sounds a lot ; is
What had happened was this: I had
stumped the fellow when he was nearly
a mile-and-a-half outside his crease; and
when he got back to it some minutes
later and found the umpire's hand up,
he was extremely indignant and dramatic
about it. Quite to myself, sotto roce as it
were, I murmured, “Oh, go home !” and
I may have called attention in some way
to the “bails.” But as to passing any
remarks about boiling heads—well, it
simply never occurred to me.
I had a dance with Myra shortly after
this. She had been so busy and impor-
tant that I felt quite a stranger. I
adapted my conversation accordingly.
“It's a very jolly floor, isn't it?” I
said as I brought her an ice.
“Oh, yes!” said Myra, playing up
promptly.
“Have you been to many floors—I
mean dances, lately 2”
“Oh, yes!”
“So have I. I think dances have
been very late lately. I think when the
floor's nice it doesn't matter about the
ices. Don't you think the band is rather
too elastic — I mean keeps very good time?
I think so long as the time is good it
doesn't matter about the floor.”
“Oh, isn't it?” said Myra enthusias-
tically.
There was a pleasant pause while we
both thought of something else to say.
“Have you,” we began——
“I beg your pardon,” we said at once.
“I was going to say,” Myra went on,
“have you read any nice books lately, or
are you fonder of tennis P’’
“I like reading mice books about
tennis,” I said. “If they are nice
books and are really about tennis. Er—
do you live in London 2''
“Yes. It is so handy for the theatres,
isn't it? There is no place exactly like
London,
(lifferent.”
“Well, of course up in Liverpool we
do get the trams, you know, now . . .
I say, I'm tired of pretending I’ve only
just met you. Let's talk properly.”
At this moment I heard a voice say,
“Let’s try in here,” and Archie and
Dahlia appeared.
“Hallo! here's the happy pair,” said
Myra.
They came in and looked at us diffi-
dently. I leant back and gazed at the
ceiling.
“Were you just going?” said Archie.
“We were not,” I said.
“Then we’ll stay and talk to you.”
“We were in the middle of an impor-
tant conversation.”
“Oh, don't mind us.”
“Thank you. It's really for your
benefit, so you'd better listen. Let me
see, where were we? Oh yes, “One
pound of beef, ninepence; three pounds
of potatoes, fourpence; one piece of
is there? I mean it's so
emery paper for the blanc-mange, tup:
pence; one pound of india-rubber—’”
“‘Dahlia darling,’” interrupted Myra,
in a fair imitation of Archie's voice,
“‘how often have I told you that we
can't afford india-rubber in the cake 2
Just a few raisins and a cherry is really
all you want. You mustn't be so extra-
vagant.’” *:
“‘Dearest, I do try ; and after all,
love, it wasn't I who fell into the cocoa
last night.’”
“‘I didn't fall in, I simply dropped
my pipe in, and it was you insisted on
pouring it away afterwards. And then
look at this—One yard of lace–4s. 0d.
That's for the cutlets, I suppose. For
people in our circumstances paper fril-
lings are quite sufficient.’”
Archie and Dahlia listened to us with
open mouths. Then they looked at each
other and them at us again.
“Is there any more?” asked Archie.
“There's lots more, but we've for-
gotten it.”
“You aren't ill or anything 2"
“We are both perfectly well.”
“How 's Miss Dalton 2 ”
“Dora,” I said, “is also well. So is
Miss Fortescue, and so is Thomas. We
are all well.”
“I thought perhaps
“No, there you are wrong.”
“I expect it's just the heat and the
excitement,” said Dahlia with a smile.
“It takes some people like that.”
“I’m
parable,” said Myra.
“We do. Come on, Dahlia.”
“You’ll pardon me, Archibald, but
Miss Blair is dancing this with me.”
Archie objected strongly, but I left
him with Myra, and took Miss Blair
away. We sat on the stairs and thought.
“It has been a lovely week,” said
Miss Blair.
“It has,” I agreed.
“Perhaps more lovely for me than
for you.”
“That's just where I don't agree with
you. You know, we think it's greatly
over-rated. Falling in love, I mean.”
“Who’s “we’?”
“Myra and I. We’ve been talking it
over. That's why we rather dwelt upon
the sordid side of it just now. I suppose
we didn't move you at all 2’’
“No,” said Miss Blair,
settled.”
“That's exactly it,” I said. “I should
hate to be settled. It's so much more
fun like this. Myra quite agrees with me.”
Miss Blair smiled to herself. “But
perhaps some day—” she began.
“I don't know. I never look more
than a week ahead. ‘It has been great
fun this week, and it will probably be
great fun next week.” That's my motto.”
“Well, ye-es,” said Miss Blair doubt-
fully. THE END. A. A. M.

if it were a party question; just a quiet
satisfaction for the country's sake, dashed
with a little natural regret that, owing

coincidence, but there's something very
like it lower down here, only with the
“no" left out before “limits.” It says
that your agitation has been “a complete
fiasco,” because the public “altogether
refused to believe that a Government
which had dealt so frankly with the facts
and saw so clearly the possible points of
danger needed any urging to do what
was necessary for safety.” Then it goes
on to say: “There are limits to what the
average Englishman will believe about
his political opponents.”
Tory. Well, then, your Radical leader-
writer must be something else than an
“average Englishman,” for there seem
to be no limits to what he is prepared to
believe about his political opponents.
Radical. I get out here. Good evening.
Tory. Aw recoir, and honi soit.
Well Meant.
“The arrival of H.M.S. Talbot at Frith was
an incident in a series of revelations as to the
strength of our Navy which made most people
who witnessed the sight marvel at England's
supremacy on the sea.”—Erith Observer.

MoTHER or ONE. – (1) We should
strongly advise you to get rid of the
nurse who is in the habit of leaving
baby in the bath for two hours while
she just “slips out to the post.” (2)
Rabbits should not be kept in the room
where the child sleeps.
MAvot RNEEN.—You say baby has got
his head stuck between the bars of the
nursery window and can't get it back.
And this is already Tuesday ! Why
didn't you wire? Send for a blacksmith
at once, and meanwhile amuse him, and
do not let him know the predicament he
is in.

his “exactly like Mr. Haldane, M.P.” is a
common one. He will soon get over this
stage. Yes, you were quite right; even
though your husband is a veterinary
surgeon it was better to have the doctor
as well.
ANxious.—(1) Don't be unreasonable;
a child of six weeks cannot be expected
to know the difference between meum
and tuum. At present he is probably
more interested in mummy and tummy.
(2) To prevent him from biting his
uncle's ear, smear it with mustard.
BRow Nie.-You say you are worried
because baby has eaten the front page
of The Daily News. There is no cause for
anxiety. The back page of The Express
would perhaps be the best antidote.
PATER.—You complain that your son
has been disobedient, will not ask for
forgiveness, and that nothing you can do
will bring him to his knees. Why not
try bringing him to your knees and let
him study the pattern of the carpet
while you do the rest?
PROUD PARENT writes: “I thought you
might be interested to know that our
doctor declares that my latest is the
finest baby he has ever seen. I enclose
a photograph.” Thank you, “Proud
Parent.” The photo you enclose is the
400th we have received this week of the
“finest baby the doctor has ever seen,"
and it enables us to complete another of
the screens which we send every week
to one of the hospitals.
HINTS TO A BEGINNER.
IF writing verse be your delight,
Be careful with your theme;
This useful maxim keep in sight,
That things—and chiefly things you
write—
Are seldom what they seem.
Let critics be your constant dread,
And, as your poem grows,
Look ever cautiously ahead,
Lest all unconsciously you tread
On someone else's toes.
Whatever subject you discuss,
Be meek as you are mild ;
Cork up your satire, label thus:
“This poem is innocuous
Alike to man and child.”
You cannot be too circumspect
Or use too nice a care;
The critic's brighter intellect
Some subtle meaning will detect
Which really isn't there.
On rare occasions you will find
Him lenient enough ;
But if he chance to feel unkind,
Or if the chop on which he dined
Was more than common tough,
He for vituperation plumps
And, as I can attest,
He takes your verse by lines or lumps
And metaphorically jumps
On your defenceless chest.
His wrath, of course, may be defied,
Nor will his lances prick,
If you by nature are supplied
Like the rhinoceros with hide
Inordinately thick.
But if, like mine, your courage goes
With every critic's curse,
Take good advice from one who knows:
Write nothing in the shape of prose,
And less in that of verse.
--
The British interviewer who wanted,
by way of compliment, to call M. BLéRiot
“a regular flier," was ill-advised to say,
“Monsieur, vous étes un roleur régulier.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from The DiARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 26.
—ADMIRALMcKENNA breathes again. For
four months has carried about with him
a secret heavier to bear than was the Old
Man of the Sea on Sinbad's shoulders.
In March last provision was made in
Navy Estimates for building four new
Dreadnoughts. In a sort of postscript,
which, as usual, was the most important
part of the communication, he intimated
contingency of an additional four.
On this public attention centred.
Four new battleships would straightway
be added to the Fleet. That a matter
of commonplace certainty. But what
about the contingent four 2
Someone broke the stillness of a Sab-
bath morning by announcing within a
fortnight of the FIRST LORD's statement
that the contingency was a reality, the
“may "governing the proposition being
changed into “shall.” In short the
hypothetical ships were already — the
article was published on April 4—deter-
mined upon as an actuality. There-
upon storm of enquiry broke upon the
Treasury Bench. Was this statement
authentic, or was it a vain imagining?
Difficult position even for the wariest,
astutest of First Lords. If he confirmed
it, he would have important section of
Ministerialists in revolt. As it turns
out, it was impossible to deny it. To
any one looking back over the four
months, with full knowledge officially
conveyed to-night, the ADMIRAL's clever-
mess of fence in circumstances of extreme
difficulty becomes for the first time fully

apparent. Repeatedly
pressed in varied form
of enquiry, he did not
say “Yes ; ” he never
said “No ; ” yet he
managed to convey im-
pression that he was
really answering the
question.
At the moment when
he rose this evening in
Committee on Navy
Estimates, no official
indication of Minis-
terial intention with
respect to the four
contingent battleships
had been forthcoming.
But who, short of pos-
session of vivid imagi-
nation, shall picture
the ADMIRAL's suffer-
ings during these four
months? What lock-
ing of his bedroom
door at night lest a
Suffragette might enter
and extort his secret!
What restraint at the
supper-table lest resul-
tant mightmare might
give it away! What
extreme caution with
respect to weather con-
ditions on treading his
quarter-deck, lest sud-
den lurch of the ship
to larboard or star-
board should explode
it! What careful
avoidance of the Poet
Laureate of the Navy
League with his insis-
tence on eight and his
blunt refusal to wait !
All is over now.
The secret is out. We
shall have the eight
without undue wait.
After four months' fitful fever the ADMIRAL
sleeps well.
Business done.—Official announcement
made that the Fleet will be strengthened
by four additional Dreadnoughts, hither-
to “contingent.”

IIouse of Lords, Thursday. — Lord

have been much

duced with double
object of relieving

and cheapening

class least able to
bear them, by ex-
tending jurisdiction
of County Courts.
In the lightness of heart that accom-
panies perennial youth, HALSBURY moved
to omit Clause I., the main, indispensable,
prop of the measure. Motion opposed
by so high, impartial, independent
authority as the Ex-PRESIDENT of THE
PROBATE Court. Carried by majority of
5, a significant variation from usual
muster against Government Bills. There-
upon Lond CHANCELLOR, to consternation
of Opposition, declined to proceed further
with the Bill. In vain HALSBURY protested
against this unexpected consequence of
his own action. CREWE, supporting his
colleague, renounced all interest in an

“strangled at its birth.”

LOVE.
[For the first time in the annals of literature
this important topic is treated in verse.]
- Prologue.
My love is seated on a bench
Beneath the overhanging tree,
And, though she is a comely wench,
I am as bored as I can be.
Ilie full length upon the lawn
And yawn and yawn and yawn and yawn.
Then, wond'ring how she's getting on,
I rise to find the lady gone. -
| The Material Part.
When I am making love to girls,
I run my fingers through my hair;
I call attention to the curls,
I tell them that it's rude to stare.
This sort of gossiping one knows 'll
Prepare the way for one's proposal.
But as for you . . . I am appalled
To think you're very likely bald.
When girls are making love to me.
They pass me all the things they think
I most prefer to eat, and see
That I have all I want to drink;
They never broach the topic till
I’ve obviously had my fill.
When girls are making love to you . . .
I don't believe they ever do.
Of all the illness in the world
This love-complaint is hardest cured,
For hair may be for ever curled,
And food for ever be endured ;
And we could evermore discuss
The all-sufficing topic “U.S.”
The last two couplets hardly seem
To have a bearing on the theme.
When love is true, then love is hot;
You cannot mind your Q's and P's :
You have to voice it on the spot,
You have to voice it on your knees.
Yet, when you're thinking to propose,
You simply mustn't blow your nose.
The slightest sneeze, the merest cough
Will put the kindest lady off.
Epiloque.
The waning of the winter moon,
The simmer of the summer sky,
The awe of autumn's afternoon,
These have their wherefore and their
why.
And, gentle reader, even you
May have some hidden meaning too.
This poem, on the other hand,
I own I cannot understand.

IBISLEY AND IRUSINESS.
Some practical hints, picked up at Bisley, for the
future guidance of marksmen wrhen in action.
The prone position is inadvisable
when you are aiming at dirigibles.
Umbrellas should not be taken into
the firing line—not even in wet weather.
Lemonade and shandygaff are seldom
obtainable in action ; marksmen must
therefore be prepared (a) to suck pebbles,
or (b) to go without. -
Should you aim at one infantryman
and inadvertently hit another, say
nothing. The chances are that, in the
ſlurry of the moment, the error will
escape notice, and your innocent decep-
tion may well be excused in the hour of
national peril.
A simple rule for scoring is—any-
where in the tunic, one.
Mounted men have an irritating habit
of moving from one position to another,
the object being to baulk the steadfast
marksman. The best way to meet this
difficulty is to make corresponding altera-
tions in the direction of your rifle-barrel.
When shooting off a tie with an oppos-
ing marksman remember that an inner
with your sighting shot is worth more
than the expectation of a possible series
of bulls later on. This is one of the differ-
ences between Bisley and the other thing.

THE IDEAL HOLIDAY RESORT.
“I AM oppressed,” said George, “by
this question of holidays, for as such I
am bound to regard the months of
August and September, whatever I may
do with the other months of the year.
The Barrister's year is divided into
terms, when he doesn't work, and the
Long Vacation, when he mustn't work.
A vacation is a holiday, and a holiday is
a thing to be spent. The difficulty is to
know where to spend it.”
“A friend of mine,” said I, “tells me
that Skegness is so bracing.”
“I have heard that, too,” said George,
“but the entertainment provided seems
to consist of nothing else than one fisher-
man and unlimited sand. The latter is
tolerable, but the former, as one's sole
companion for two months, might prove
a little tiring. His constant agility
would make one feel hot and uncomfort-
able, and the sea is really too blue there.”
“Any Railway Company would be
only too glad to recommend a pleasant
resort,” said I, thinking of more posters.
“The best and quickest route to Ireland
is certainly . . .” -
“It is, undoubtedly,” said George.
“But you will notice this curious fact
about Railway Companies' recommenda-
tions. They are invariably spots served
exclusively by their own lines. I think it
is just possible that they content them-
selves with making your journey there
and back thoroughly happy and don't
much care what happens to you in
between times. Now, if I could find
a Company really emphatic about the
charms of a watering-place that you
couldn't possibly get to by their own
railway, I would go there like a shot.
As yet I have not. I find, for instance,
that nothing would induce the London
and North Western Railway to spend its
holidays anywhere else than in London
or the North-West.” .
“Have you ever tried Theobald's
Grove’” I said, turning casually to the
A.B.C. “It is only 13; miles from
Liverpool Street, and the fares are 1,8a,
1/2b, and -/10c. It does not mention
the other sights, but it does say that the
thing to see is page 490. I have never
heard the Great Eastern boast of this, and
there does not appear to be a population.”
“I have not the pleasure of knowing
Theobald,” said George, “and the A.B.C.,
though thoroughly impartial, is too pro-
miscuous. Besides, they insist upon my
taking a bottle of fruit salts in my bag,
and I doubt if I have room.”
“Why not try Finland 2* I suggested.
"I mention that simply because Thomas,
who also has never been there, said
to me this morning, ‘Why not try Fin-
land ''. Any adequate reason you ad-
vance for not doing so I shall be delighted
to pass on to Thomas.”
“I know a man,” said George, “who
once knew a man, who thought he knew
a man . . .” -
“What a lot of men there are about
nowadays,” said I.
“. . . who went to Finland years and
years ago and was stabbed in the back
in his sleep.”
“You could easily avoid that by sleep-
ing on your back.”
“And wear a chest-protector?” said
George. “No, I suppose it must be the
old Continent again. Already I hear the
familiar song ringing in my ears. How
does it run ? -
“Il est dangereux de se pencher en dehors.'
or, as they sing it in Italy,
‘E periculoso sporger-i ' '
The attraction is irresistible. Take it
that I sail from Dover to-morrow.”
“And I will forward your letters to
the old address at Margate,” said I.
“The world is all awry,” said George,
sorrowfully. “I look to my old friend
James for advice, and I am answered
with meaningless nothings. I look past
him to the starlit heavens for inspira-
tion, and I am told, sometimes in red
lights, sometimes in green, and occa-
sionally even in white, to ‘DRINK AND
ENJOY LEwAR's LITTLE LIVER BOvs.’
Again I have to turn to James and hope
against hope that for once he will not
show himself an ass. Now tell me:
where shall I go?” .
“Go to Jericho,” said I.
THE VERAcious virTuoso.
MR. BAMBERGER's NARRATIVE.
THE account headed “Melba in Wom-
derland,” describing the astounding
demonstrations organised in honour of
the redoubtable dira by the Whakaro-
warewa natives at l'otorua lends signifi-
cance to the following narrative of the
travels of Mr. and Mrs. BAMBER(; ER in
Patagonia, which has been kindly and
modestly furnished us by Mr. J3AMBERGER
himself.
It will be remembered that Mr. DAM-
BERGER undertook this arduous and
perilous expedition from mixed motives,
partly scientific, partly artistic. It was
suggested to him that the tones of his
violin, reinforced by the social prestige
of his wife (the only daughter of Sir
Pompey Boldero) might succeed not only
in luring the Giant Sloth from its fast-
mess in the salicylic swamps of the
Lycopodium Valley, but also bring com-
fort and cheerfulness to the l’atagonians
themselves, who have of late been suffer-
ing from severe agricultural depression,
owing to the failure of the crops of
Digitalis and Extractive Scammomy.
Mr. and Mrs. BAMBERGER travelled with
an extremely small retinue, consisting of
only 150 native bearers, a squadron of
Argentine Carabiniers, ten flashlight
photographers, four men cooks, and
three alternating accompanists. Their
first stop was at Pogolopotl, the famous
floating city on the inland sea of Slobo-
lando. Here the travellers were met by
over 600 of the leading Creosote Indians,
including the famous anthropophagous
chieftain, Gobolup. This renowned war-
rior, whose chivalry is only equalled
by the length of his feet, welcomed the
visitors with the most abject condescen-
sion, reciting some of the choicest recipes'
in his ancestral cookery-book, and enter-
tained them to a magnificent banquet
consisting of Paraguay tea, cardamoms,
and coriander bascules. After the banquet
Mrs. BAMBERGER presented the chief with
a beautifully illuminated copy of her
family tree, and in return he proposed
her health in a most eloquent speech,
winding up with the words, “Jaborandi
Senega guavana ceradilla condurango.”
Mr. BAMBERGER having suitably replied,
the party then adjourned to take part in
a grand jamboree, which was kept up to
a late hour. While the revels were at
their height and Mrs. BAMBERGER was
dancing the Kitchen Lancers in the most
recherché aristocratic style with the
chieftain's eldest son, news was brought
by an exhausted runner of the advent of
a raiding party of Scarabs, the hereditary
foes of the Slobolando Patagonians.
With singular unanimity Mr. BAMBERGER
was chosen as generalissimo of the
garrison, and at once led a sortie against
the invaders, armed with the Mauser
pistol presented him by the Cz \R, and
the stiletto given him by the Nihilists of
Moscow. The issue of the conflict was,
never long in doubt. Out of the 1,200
slain nearly half were accounted for by
Mr. BAMBERGER himself, while the booty
included forty bales of natural scammony,
twenty-three kegs of kola, nineteen
jeroboams of liquorice juice, fifty pottles.
of orris root, and one hundred butts of
clarified camomile tea. Mr. BAMBERGER
gave a short violin recital on the field of
battle, followed by a speech, in which he
assured his triumphant warriors that on
his return to England he would person-
ally assure the KING of their loyalty to
him (i.e. Mr. BAMBERGER). He then
ordered double rations of cod liver oil.
rhatany and tolu balsam to be served
out, and, bidding an affecting adieu to
his army, continued his progress to the
Lycopodium Valley. - -
In our next instalment we hope to
summarise the appalling adventures of
Mrs. BAMBERGER while a captive in the
lair of the Giant Sloth, the tragic agony
of Sir Pompey Boldero, and finally the
portentous and incredible means by.
which Mr. BAMBERGER first hypnotised
and then annihilated his beloved con-
sort's inexorable captor. Not if I know
it.—ED. Punch.] -

HD came to my room in the stilly
Night hours, and so soft was his tread

Bent silently over the bed.
In a bloodcurdling whisper that carried
More menace than many a shout
He bade me to state where my family

And money hung out.
It gave me good heart for a tussle
To mote his nefarious air–
Sure sign that the gentleman's muscle
Was only a flabby affair—

Contempt for the criminal law,
I flung the clothes back and I caught him
a smack
Right under the jaw.
But oh!, as the kick of a hoss is,
In swiftness and force was the blow

Wherein I was knocked out of time,

Connected with crime.

fortunately Mr. AIGERNoN GissiNG's enthusiasm for his sub-
ject is greater than his sense of form, and in consequence
the book seems to miss its proper effect from some confu-
sion of interest. In the words of the immortal criticism
of Jabberwocky, “it fills my head with ideas, only I
don't exactly know what they are.” To say this, however,
is not to deny The Unlit Lamp many excellent qualities;
it has above all things the grace of complete sincerity. The
story concerns the life of one Timothy Lampitt, poacher
and squatter, and the efforts made by Paul, son of old Squire
Creed, to mitigate his father's interpretation of rural law
against the outcast. Paul had been with the army in France,
and brought home with him not only republican theories but
also the daughter of a sergeant as wife. I should like to

THE DEPLORABLE FRIVOLITY OF
MR. PONKING.
(An Electioneering Forecast.)
INIRoll croRY.—Certain Cabinet Ministers are, as Mr. Punch
has recorded in a recent cartoon, employing gramophones
to represent them at political meetings held in farour of
the Budget. It seems not improbable that during the
meat General Election this precedent may be followed by
Parliamentary Candidates who finil it impossible to pay
a personal visit to more than a few of their constituents.
At all events, we will asl, the reader to assume that that
rising politician, Mr. Stodgely-Sewett, who is standing
for the Division of North-West Tootwell in the Liberal
interest, has deputed a gramophone to cancuss the
householders in Mafeking Avenue. The instrument,
escorted by an amiable but incompetent member of Mr.
S.-S.'s Committee, has arrired at No. 10, the semi-detached
two-storical residence occupied by Mr. Alfred Ponking,
whom we discover at tea with his wife and children.

“The Long Result of Time.”
From The Sheffield Weekly Telegraph's account of a
swimming competition between Leicester and Sheffield
Otters we learn the following:—
“In the first hundred years Leicester gained nearly half a length,
and subsequent swimmers increased the advantage until J. A. Jarvis,
Leicester's last man, had over a length's start of F. A. Unwin. The
latter swam magnificently, but could not quite overcome his long
arreal's.
This does not surprise us. If Leicester took a hundred
years to gain half a length, they would probably take
another hundred years to make this into a length. So that
poor Mr. UNWIN started about two centuries' worth behind.
This is a very heavy handicap indeed.

THE JESTERSHIP.
The Parliamentary Committee ap-
pointed to inquire into the functions
and services of the Oſlicial Jester (Mr.
G. B. SHAW) sat yesterday to receive
evidence. Mr. BIRRELL., M.P., was in
the chair, and the other members of the
committee were Mr. KEIR HARDIE, M.P.,
Mr. MASTERMAN, M.P., Mr. A. E. W.
Nº. M.P., and Mr. RoberT HARCOURT,
Mr. Shaw, who was first called, said
that he had prepared a book of 500
pages at his own expense which should
take the place of his examination.
The Chairman. We have read it, and
would now like to know what you have
to say for yourself.
Mr. Shaw. But I explained everything
there.
The Chairman. We laughed so much
that we couldn't follow it. -
Mr. Shaw. I shall have great pleasure
in saying it here, provided that the
reporters are all present.
The Chairman. Proceed.
Mr. Shaw. I was appointed Official
Jester in 1894.
Mr. Mason. Who appointed you ?
Mr. Shaw. I appointed myself.
The Chairman. What is your proce-
dure? -
Mr. Shaw. It is very simple. I am a
conscientious inverter. When I meet
with a generally believed statement I
turn it round. For example, the general
opinion is that all British soldiers are
brave. I say that all British soldiers
are cowards, and when I am asked
where their cowardice lies I say they
are not brave enough to run away. I
an do this kind of thing for ever. I
never tire.
Mr. Keir Hardie. Why do you mever
tire 2
Mr. Shaw. Because I live a healthy
life. I never touch alcohol, and I never
eat deceased animals.
Mr. Harcourt. Why not ?
Mr. Shaw. Because it's funnier not to.
Mr. Masterman. Is there any subject
on which you cannot jest ?
Mr. Shaw. None has been discovered
Vot. -
The Editor of “The Times” was the
next witness. He said that he con-
sidered that Mr. Sixw ought to be re-
tained as Official Jester since he pro-
vided excellent free copy several times
a week. Rig-type copy.
Mr. William -1 reher said that he was
a Scotchman. He considered that the
Official Jester should be retained because
he (the speaker) could understand his
jokes.
Mr. Jesterton said that he was against
the Official Jester. He was not good for
trade. -
Mr. Granrille Barker spoke in favour
of the Jester, holding that the public
was in need of cold truths, such as
Mr. SH \w offered them, and the un-
familiar side could not be too much
studied. The Jester made people think.
The foreman of a firm of printers said
that he hoped the Jester would be re-
tained, as he was good for trade. He
was always having manifestos printed.
A deputation of clergymen of all de-
nominations here entered to lodge a
protest against the Jester. He was, they
said, opposed to all law, order, and right
feeling. His doctrines, in the form of
jokes, were permicious.
Mr. Eustace Miles said he hoped the
Jester would not be removed.
Mr. Shaw, recalled, said that he made
a very good thing out of the Jestership.
He would starve if he were forced to be
serious. One of his greatest expenses
was the need of having his head half-
soled every few weeks.

Dread the approach of WILLIAM Joxes.
For then the wildest of cyclones
Are mild compared with WILLIAM Joxes.
Then Tories hoist the warning comes
And madly fly from Willi AM Jones.
Then England with submission owns
The sovereignty of Willi AM Joxes.
THE PORK PAGEANT.
Following upon the Dogs' and Cats’
Pageant, the plans for the Pork Pageant
are now complete. It will be held at
Hoggs Norton in September, and the
book has been very carefully written by
that prince of pageant-makers, Mr. LOUIS
N. Pork:R. Among the patrons are Sir
Thoyſ As LIPTON, Sir WILLIAM HARRIs,
Mr. DENNY, Judge BACON, and the Chief
Secretary for Ireland.
Tableau I. will represent the discovery
of roast pig. Here Mr. Porker has had
recourse to the gentle Elia. The scene
is Chinese, and the burning of Ho-ti’s
house and first enraptured taste of
crackling will be vividly enacted.
Tableau II.-Effect of Cold Pork on
the imagination. Several thousand frozen
pigs recently imported from China will
appear in this scene, which includes a
vivid representation of FUSELI at supper
and of his nightmare afterwards. -
Tableau III.--The invention of sau-
sages. Sir WILLIAM HARRIs will take a
leading part, and pulp several thousand
potatoes with a silver mashie.
Tableau IV.-The learned pigs of all
ages, beginning with David's sow. The
processes of education will be displayed
for the first time. Pigs will be seen at
school, in the various classes, acquiring
culture and passing examinations. Re-
presentation of Michael, ANGELo, Ti IIAN,
TINTORETTO, &c., drawing pigs with their
eyes shut.
Tableau V. will represent the
tleman that pays the rint”—an Irish
scene. No expense has been spared to
make this a realistic transcript of life in
the green or emerald isle. Real peasants
have been imported, and have already
begun to rehearse. Real pigs will be
introduced, driven by Mr. GINNELL, M.P.
Tableau VI.-Chicago. Pork packing.
A real millionaire, travelling in Europe,
has consented to display himself during
this scene and illustrate the life of a
pig-made American.
Tableau VII.-SILAkspeaRE and BAcox
in a contest of wit before good Queen
BESs, without whom no pageant is com-
plete. She listens to their verbal adroit-
ness and at last awards the prize to—
but that is Mr. To RREIt's secret. - .
Tableau VIII. and last.—The grand
march past by Baconians, starting from
Ham Street, and proceeding by Ham
Lane, Ham Common and Ham Bridge
Halt. This is a very splendid eſſect,
comprising as it does personification not
only of the great Chancellor himself but
also of DELIA BACON and IG. DoNNELLY, and
it will be brought at each performance
to a conclusion by a spirited dialogue
between Mr. GEORGE GREENwood, M.P.,
and MARK TwAIN, in which the Baconian
theory will be enunciated with damming
force. -

CROSS-EXAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's RoAD To KNOWLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; Mamma, aged 41.)
Little Arthur. Mamma'
Mamma. Yes, Arthur.
L. A. Do you think I am enjoying this visit to the seaside?
Mamma. What a funny question. I'm sure you ought to
be enjoying it. There are the sands, and the sea, and the
downs. You’ve got your spade for sand castles, and your
met for shrimping; and you can bathe every day and learn
to swim ; and there's your kite. There are thousands of
little boys who would give anything for such pleasures. And
besides, you've got Papa with you for a week.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, that's just it.
Mamma. What's just what?
L. A. Papa's just—no, I mean I'm wondering about Papa.
Mamma. What are you wondering about him 2
L. A. I'm wondering if he'll make me enjoy myself.
Mamma. Why, you silly little boy, of course he won't
: make you enjoy yourself. Nobody can do that. But he'll
show you how to do it—help you, you know. You ought to
be very grateful to him. ".
L. A. So I would be, Mamma, but——
Mamma. But what? - -
L. A. You spoke about sand-castles, Mamma, didn't you ?
Mamma. Yes, I did. Your aunts and I used to build
splendid ones when we were little girls, and when the tide
came in we used to stand on them. Little Canutes, your
grandfather used to call us. Oh, yes, it was great fun.
L. A. Well, Mamma, I started building one yesterday, and
I thought I was getting on very well, but Papa said I was
doing it quite wrong, and he took the spade away from me
and went on piling it up and up and patting it; and then he
kept sending me to collect sea-weed and stones to strengthen
the walls, and when he'd finished it it was time to go home
for lunch, and I hadn't really dome anything. -
Mamma. Oh, but you mustn't grudge your father his little
relaxation. Remember how hard he works.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, I’ll try to. But hasn't Papa got any
amusements of his own 2 Couldn't he play golf, or make a
speech 2 -
Mamma. He came down here to get away from making
speeches, and as to golf, he said he wouldn't play during this
one week, but devote himself to us. There are not many
boys who've got so unselfish a father. -
L. A. No, Mamma, I suppose not—but he isn't teaching
me to swim, you know.
Mamma. Isn't he?
L. A. Oh, no. Yesterday and to-day he left me by the
maehine and went swimming himself, and when he came
back he held me up by my bathing-drawers and said, “Strike
out now,” and when I struck out he said, “That's all wrong.
You'll never learn to swim like that,” and then he dipped me
under twice and said, “There now, that'll make a man of
you,” and then we went back into the machine.
Mamma. Well, perhaps it is a little difficult to learn
swimming here, but you must keep on trying, Arthur.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, I will if Papa will let me. And them
there's the shrimping-net.
Mamma. What's the matter with that ?
L. A. Oh, there's nothing the matter with the net, Mamma.
Mamma. Well, what have you got to complain of, then 2
L. A. I'm not complaining, Mamma; I'm only telling
you. I'd just started shrimping yesterday when Papa came
up and took off his shoes and socks. He told me I wasn't
holding the met in the right way, and he took it away from
me just to show me how to do it; but I never got it back;
he went on doing it all the time.
Mamma. Well, your father caught all those shrimps we
had for tea yesterday. I'm sure that was very clever of him.
L. A. Oh, no, Mamma. He only caught five small ones.
He bought the rest for threepence from a real shrinper.
l Mamma. But you told me you and he had caught all of
them. - - -
L. A. No, Mamma, I said we'd got them all, and so we
had. Papa arranged with me I was to say that so as to pull
your leg a bit. - - * ,
Mamma. Arthur, I will not have you using these vulgar
expressions. Your father would be extremely displeased if
he heard you. -
L. A. I don't think he would, Mamma, because he used
expression himself.
Mamma. Well, I don't think it's at all funny.
L. A. Nor do I, Mamma; but that's what Papa said.
Mamma. And if he did, you're only a little boy, and
you've no right to repeat it. - * .
L. A. No, Mamma; but the other day, when Papa said he
had pulled Mrs. Nettlefold's leg, you laughed. You seemed
to think it was funny them. -
Mamma.
it any more. What were we talking about?
L. A. Papa and my enjoyment.
Mamma. Well, I suppose you were able to fly your kite
yesterday after tea 7
L. A. Oh, mo, I wasn't. Papa came on the Downs with"
me, and after I'd tried to get the kite up twice, he took hold
of the string and got it up himself. After that he wouldn't
let me hold the string at all, because he said the kite was
too strong for me. -
Mamma. Well, why don't you go out now, and catch
shrimps or fly your kite? Your father's out, so now 's your
chance.
L. A. Thank you for the suggestion, Mamma, but it's no
that
good.
Mamma. No good 2 Why not? +
L. A. Because when Papa went out he took the net and
the kite with him. He said he'd have a go with the kite
first, and then he'd start shrimping when the tide was
further out.
Mamma. Well, why didn't you go with him 2
L. A. It wouldn't have been much fun for me, Mamma;
and besides, he said I might like to stop at home and talk to
you ; so I stayed.
Mamma. Anyhow, you could go on the sands and build
castles.
L. A. No, I couldn't, Mamma, because Papa broke my
spade yesterday, just as he finished his castle.
Mamma. Well, here's sixpence to buy another.

The Dog-Watch. -
Under the heading, “Is Liverpool Safe?” The Daily Mail
recently gave an account of a test of the Mersey defences,
concluding with the reassuring statement that “up to a late
hour the many watchers had observed nothing likely to dis-
turb their slumbers.” This is your true dog's watch. Not
long ago a high authority at the Admiralty informed us that
we might “sleep in our beds” without fear of being roused
by an invasion ; but we prefer the Mail's advice, which
amounts to this: Keep awake, England Keep awake all
the time, and then nothing is likely to disturb your slumbers.

A NEW PAPER FOR BIPEDS.
DEAR SIR,--So much interest is taken
nowadays in the four-footed domestic
creation, their joys and sorrows, that it
only seems fair that our feathered friends,
the fowls, should have a turn. With
this end in view I am bringing out a
paper called The Daily Wattle, devoted
to the needs and interests of the poultry
world, and send you herewith a few
cuttings from the first number, hoping
thereby to arouse public interest in a
much-needed journal:—
Social and General.
Madame Anne de Lusian gave a de-
lightful little afternoon party on Satur-
day, at which Crewso sang. Among
others present we noticed Mrs. Legge
Horne, who looked charming in white,
Mr. and Mrs. Bantam, and Mr. Orping-
ton, of the Buffs, who escorted two of
his charming sisters.
Mr. and Mrs. Dawking
have gone to
Leaden Hall for the season.
Her many friends will be grieved to
hear of the sad death of Miss Pullet,
which occurred suddenly last Wednes-
day at Yew Tree Farm. She appeared
to be in the best of health and spirits
on the Tuesday, though her friends had
noticed a decided tendency to embonpoint
during the last few weeks, which, it is
feared, may have contributed to her
sudden seizure and early demise.
Lord Barn d'Or is recovering from
the somewhat severe injuries he sustained
in his motor accident on the Brighton
road last week.
Two eggs, old enough to know better,
were caught poaching yesterday, and
were served accordingly.
The latest report is that feathers are
going out of fashion and very few will
be worn this autumn.
Births :
At “Ye Neste,” Henley, Mrs. Wyan.
Dotte of eight sons and five daughters
(three addled). American papers, please
copy.

IForecast.
Full crops are expected generally.
The Whitchurch (Salop) Herall repro-
duces the scores which were made, so it
says, “by the Shropshire tea in the
China Cup competition at Bisley.” We
know what China tea is like in a Shrop-
shire cup, but this local product is a
beverage which we have never had the
curiosity to sample.
The Protection of Scenery.
According to The East Anglian Daily
Times, a new speed provision (in the
State of Connecticut) “makes anything
over ten miles an hour reckless driving :
(1) Whenever the driver's view of the
road or traffic is obstructed; (2) when
he is approaching a crossing or interest-
ing highway.”
Commercial Candour.
“Stop and think for a moment. Many people
are all run down, tired out and hardly able to
drag about—don't know what ails them. -

Wine of Cod Liver Extract, the great tissue
builder, is the answer.”—The Ciril and Military
Gazette (Lahore).

Now, when the sportsman is flitting from market and Mammon,
Now, when the courts, swept and garnished, stand silent
and lone, --
Now, with her challenging grouse, and her sea-silver salmon,
August, of mountains and memories, comes to her own ;
Would you gaze into the crystal, and see the long valleys,
Braes of the North, and the rivers that wander between,
Crags with whose coating the tint of the ptarmigan tallies.”
Come up to Euston to-night about 7.15.

Humbly content with the codling you catch from the pier,
Making the booth's mere mechanical rabbit your target,

No need to bother for berth or for booking of ticket,
When you would sojourn a space in the Kingdom of Dreams.
Come, then, and stand on the platform, and see through the
arches,
Full of the evening that flushes the chimneys with light,
Gold-burnished rails that run out to the pines and the larches,
See the long corridor carriages busking for flight;
Board them in fancy, and then, when the twilight grows

Speed through the moon-mantled Midlands—by fell and
by firth,
Wake with your tea, in the smootk-swinging rush of the

When the white glamour of morning is pale over Perth.
So, spite of luggage and crowds and of engines that whistle,
Over the riggings—in spirit—once more you'll descry,
On to the perilous butts, where the batteries bristle,
Blotting the heather, the well-driven coveys come by ;
Bracken and blaeberry, murderous midges that bite you,
Summits that stand to the sunset, tremendous and stark, -
Come up to Euston, for lo, it has dreams to requite you,
Till the last tail-light has twinkled, and gone in the dark 1
AERY NOTHINGS.
A RACE for Trans-Channel honours has been arranged be-
tween Mr. Hollein and the latest War Office flier, the Solritur
Ambulando. Among the conditions governing the match it
is stipulated that the former shall be allowed no more than
one brass band, two tugs, and enough beef essence to stave
off starvation, while the aeroplane must carry Mr. G. K.
ChESTERTON in an Inverness cloak fully charged with books
of reference, and arrive with the engine and crew in situ. A
thoroughly sporting event is thus assured.
The annual fair held at Nijni Novgorod has been rendered
noteworthy this year by the unexpected arrival of the Dulce
Domum, in charge of Dr. Icarus Lunn. This achievement
undoubtedly marks the final conquest of the air, and we
hasten to tender our congratulations to the intrepid ačronaut.
The Dulce Domum left Fulham last Saturday, having Wan-
stead Marshes as its objective. In consequence, however, of
a sudden change in the direction and force of the wind an
alteration in the programme was decided upon, with the
above happy result. The dauntless crew, on being told of
their whereabouts, expressed no surprise, but accepted with
eagerness the Governor's invitation to dinner. . . . . .

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM The DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, August 2.
—As the old adage hath it, Every Major
has his day. This is ANSTRUTHER-GRAY's.
Question Paper testifies that for months
he has devoted a massive martial mind
to question of equipping British Army
with dirigibles. To experiment has con-
tributed not only thought but personal
adventure. Frequently at break of day
policeman on beat has observed, floating
over railed-in grass-plot, a strange con-
trivance. At first supposed it was the
mysterious balloon of which the air and
men's minds were recently full. On
closer inspection recognised in sole
occupier of mysterious machine the ten-
ant of No. 9, Eaton Square, S.W.
Of course there are peculiar difficulties
in the way of the MAJOR floating in the
empyrean. You want a pretty strong
motive power to fly off with nineteen
stone at the rate of a mile a minute.
The MAJOR, accustomed from boyhood to
make the best of things, perceives in his
height and girth advantages where others
spy serious disabilities.
“It simplifies matters,” he says.
“You see, when I'm aboard no ballast
is required.”
Which, when you come to think of it,
is quite true.
House in Committee on Civil Service
Estimates. They
include vote for
£36,464 for grants
in aid of scientific
investigation. This
looks in no cent
enough. NAPOLEON
B. HALDANE, coming
to the front, gives
away pious fraud.
Lieut. ShackleTON
tells MEMBER Fort
SARK that when he
was bringing home
his ship from Ant-
arctic Seas it sprang
a leak. Being short-
handed for such
purposes, he offici-
ally called the pump
“a scientific instru-
ment,” and turned
on the doctor and
the naturalist to
take a hand at it.
They were shipped
to look after scien-
tific instruments,
and here was one
earnest attention.
Similarly this
vote, though ap-
pearing in Civil
Service Estimates,
l
Lieutenant Shackleton should really attend an Army Debate in the
ouse of Commons. He would certainly feel
tempted to add to the
collection of Penguin slides with which he now delights his audiences.
(This one, for instance, would seem to be a War Minister “taking
the salute” at a march-past of Antarctic Territorials.)

“The oats supplied (to the Shropshire Yeomanry) were so light,
you'd only to put your head in the manger and blow, Mr. Speaker,
and the whole thing went—ph-h-h!—like that . "
and being described
as “in aid of scien-
tific investigation,”
really belongs to
Army expenditure
and represents sum
available for experi-
ments in aviation.
Hence N. B. H.’s
appearance on
scene. Makes in-
teresting statement
on development of
new arm of the
Service. Apologises
for asking for so
small a sum ; pro-
mises to do better
in future. As it is,
with assistance of
Navy, there will be
spent £78,000 this
year on aeronautics.
And all this largely,
if not entirely, due
to inspiration and
encouragement of
the MAJOR.
In an eloquent
passage N. B. illus-
trates the difficulty
confronting the
gallant ex-Hussar
in course of his
voluntary service to

nation. It appears that, if you go too
high when scouting in a dirigible,
intervening clouds prevent your taking
observations. If you go too low, as
HALDANE put it, “the position of the
unfortunate aeroplanist who is sitting
on a seat like that of a bicycle, with a
battalion of marksmen below, is very
disagreeable.”
At this juncture all eyes turned on
the MAJOR, modestly occupying two seats
behind Front Opposition Bench. In
their mind's eye, Members saw him
partially accommodated on saddle
suitable for rider of a bicycle, scud-
ding low, regardless of the enemy, who,
with rifles brought to shoulder, pointed
skyward as if they were rook-shooting.
Business dome.—Nineteenth and last
day for Supply in Committee. At
ten o'clock guillotine dragged in ;
£59,000,000 sterling remained to be
voted. Bang went the whole sum in
next to no time at all. Could have
been done even quicker, only some
Members insisted on running up average
of their attendance on divisions. Here
was opportunity of adding five to the
score. Utilised to the full.
Tuesday.—During the naval review
on Saturday public attention was concen-
trated upon His MAJESTY, alert on the
royal yacht, steaming slowly through
the mighty avenues of battleships, proud
in possession of a peerless armada.

Mr. John T. MiDDLEMORE was
also there, bent on same mis-
sion of reviewing fleet. For
some time he has, with melan-
choly persistence, marked
the Admiralty as his own.
His attention first called to
subject by discovery of the
utterly neglected condition of
Birmingham. Within circle
of twenty miles of that metro-
polis of labour and Liberal
Unionism there is not a single
first-class cruiser, much less
a Dreadnought. If there are
smaller ships assigned to the
station, they are subterraneous
as distinct from submarine.
Of that Mr. MiDDLEMORE knows
nothing. But before the Pro-
rogation he will pose Admiral
McKENNA with a question or
two.
Up to present date has been
too closely engaged in convict-
ing the Admiralty of neglect
of our first indispensable line
of defence. Being, apart from
naval affairs, a genial gentleman, he does behind of the Government” in respect
“BARox BYLEs of BRAdFord.”
“What did His Majesty the King say on Monday ?”
THE KNG say on Monday?"
Here ... SPEARER interposed,
reminding the noble Member
that the name of the KING
may not be introduced into
debate.
“Sir,” said the BARON, with
slight note of asperity, “I
was going to speak with the
greatest possible respect of
His MAJESTY.”
Reassured, House made
room for REES or HINDUSTAN,
who chivalrously supported
ADMIRAL McKENNA under
angry fusilade.
It was here that Member
for North Birm’ngham loomed
in sight, a Dreadnought dwarf-
ing fleet of destroyers. Enough
for others to potter round
these minutiae of criticism,
these minnows of animadver-
sion. What Mr. MIDDLEMORE
wanted to know was, “Do the
Government intend to build
eight more Dreadnoughts next
year?”
His timbers shivering with apprehen-

asked how in his Dictionary he came comparisons between one nation and for any Government to particularise in

“Ignorance, Madam, pure
ignorance." Happily the na-
tion has the Member for North
Birmingham in the crow's
nest, keeping a sharp look-out
on naval administration.
Muster of fleet at Spithead
afforded opportunity for in-
spection from fresh point of
view. Scanning long line of
battleships from window of

pitable Adriatic, his keen cul-
tured eye discovered various

subterranean titivations the installa-
tion of baskets of flowers at Earl's
Court Station has attracted sympathetic
attention of late. But other and
more striking changes are shortly
about to emerge into the stage of
achievement.
A charming innovation in the inte-
rests of music-lovers is that which
Messrs. SMITH and WILLING are shortly
about to enforce on all the bookstall
assistants in their service—viz., that in-
stead of the mystic word “Poime-e-e-r”
(i.e., paper) being called separately, it is
to be chanted henceforth in two or three-
part harmony. The assistants, moreover,
when not occupied in attending to the
wants of the passengers, will sing madri-
gals, part-songs, and catches from a
collection prepared by Sir EDGAR SPEYER
and Sir GEORGE GIBB.
Another extremely considerate and
desirable new departure is that by which
all passengers, on reaching the platform,
will be supplied gratis with roller skates,
in case they have to wait for a train. A
special instructor will be told off to
watch each platform, and may be relied
on to rescue any novices who are in
danger of skating on to the line.
Another long-felt want will shortly be
satisfied by the decision of the Company
to attach a sleeping carriage to all Circle
trains, for the benefit of all those who
wish to rest comfortably while in the
train, or, as occasionally happens, spend
several hours a day in going round
and round the Underground. Light
refreshments will also be served on the
car, which will include a barber's shop,
a card room, a reading room, a billiard
room, an American bar, and a jig-saw
puzzle parlour.
But perhaps the most surprising
development of all is the noble offer of
Sir Hugo von Erkimer to paint the
entire roof of the line between Baker
Street and Portland Road in luminous
paint, with frescos representing his
early struggles and ultimate triumph
over the combined forces of jealousy
and incompetence. The only difficulty
about the scheme is that it naturally
involves the removal of the roofs of all
the carriages. But the directors are
hopeful of discovering a ria media which
will reconcile the claims of high art
with the comfort of the public.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 11, 1909.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE BEST PEOPLE.”
THE first week of August is perhaps
mot the likeliest time for the start of a
new play, and the atmosphere at Wynd-
ham's on Thursday was of the sultriest.
But a really excellent entertainment was
provided for a mostappreciativeaudience,
which included several members of the
profession bent on improving their holi-
days by the spectacle of other actors at
work. The First Act, extraordinarily
well done, showed us a brace of couples
engaged in executing a mutual exchange
—the men in earnest as far as they
knew how to be. At times the comedy
(which never descended to farce —
not, at any rate, in action) hovered on
the verge of an adaptation
from the French, both in the
matter of situation (the old
scheme of a petit souper, a
surprise, and a concealment
in an adjacent room) and
also in the matter of the pro- .
prieties; but always got safely
away. - -
Mr. BERNARD SHAW must not
be jealous if I describe the
play as “immoral” in the
sense that it deals with ques-
tions of right and wrong in a
spirit of irresponsible detach-
ment. Nothing was supposed
to matter much ; the virtues
and vices of the characters
were equally human ; the best
of them was not blameless,
and the worst had redeeming
qualities. Nobody was greatly
concerned about the issue (it
all came right in the end and
is bound to go wrong again
within a month); our interest
rather lay in the constant surprise of
diversions which always occurred just
when the obvious course was indicated.
Mr. LoNSDALE's dialogue was most
felicitous, and my only complaint is that
we could never quite believe in the
sincerity of the only character who really
made a show of taking things seriously.
The interpretation could scarcely have
been improved, though, perhaps, that
delightful actor, Mr. KENNETH DOUGLAs,
suffered a little from facial monotony,
due in part to his eye-glass. Mr.
FREDERICK KERR, as usual, was made for
his part, and his part for him. Miss
Eva MooRE was very intelligent and
vivacious in the part of a clever woman;
and Miss LETTICE FAIRFAx was almost
equally good in the part of a stupid one.
But nothing was better than Mr. Sugden's
performance in the First Act.
There was a heavy-weight champion
who only appeared just in time to escape
the final curtain. I should have liked to
Jord Emsworth

make his better acquaintance, as he was
obviously a man of action and meant
business.
Mr. LONSDALE is not very happy with
his titles. A former play of his, The
Early Worm, had nothing early about
it; and, since the characters in his
present play are certainly not “The Best
People’ in point of morals, the title can
only apply in a social sense, and there-
fore required some sort of satire upon
this designation of Society. But mone
was furnished, except in a single
passage where the old peer requests his
son not to raise his voice and so oblite-
rate the sole remaining distinction
between his class and the common
people.
The evening opened with a revival of
Mr. ECKERSLEY's bright and attractive
THE GAY LIFE. 'y
curtain-raiser, A Boy's Proposal, which
deserved a much better setting than it
got. It is futile for the dialogue to invite
attention to the luxury of her ladyship's
apartment, when the manager affords
her nothing better than a garret. Miss
CHEVALIER was pleasant and matural,
but Mr. DAWSON might have been less
amateurish; and I incline to think that
the talents of that clever boy, Philip
ToNGE, have been a little overrated.

0N A BIRMINGHAM PLATFORM.
[No, this has nothing to do with Mr. Asquith's
threatened visit to the Headquarters of Tariff
Reform.]
TheRE were 87 intending third-class
passengers–85 ordinary people, one
poor fool and myself. I despised the
85 ordinary people, pitied the poor fool,
and admired as much of myself as I
could see in the mirror over the Auto-
matic Weighing Machine.
When the train came in looking hot
and impatient, I had taken up a front
position on the platform, intent on
securing a corner seat at all costs. The
85 had also taken up front positions,
possibly with the same intent, but the
poor fool had got left well in the rear,
which finally convinced me that he was
indeed the poorest of fools, or
the most foolish of paupers.
I did not get a corner seat,
for I am not the sort of person
to push and fight. Moreover,
there was only one eorner seat
}) available, and theengine-driver
told me that he should want
that himself, when he had
finished oiling the bearings.
Still, in spite of my retiring
nature, I was first into the
train. I put my bag on my
seat and went to lean out of
the window, partly in order
to make at least two of the
brutal possessors of corner
seats uncomfortable in their
possession, and partly to watch
with contempt the plight of
the poor fool.
Behind the mass of strug-
gling humanity he was visible,
still sitting upon a milk-can.
He appeared to be lost in
his foolish abstractions, and,
though from time to time he did look at
the train, the observations of his eye
seemed to convey nothing to his mind.
So, intimating to the occupants of my
carriage with one glance that "anyone
trespassing on my place would be
prosecuted with the utmost rigour of
the law, I stepped forth to interfere.
“Am I right in supposing,” I said to
the poor fool, “that you have a third-
class ticket to London?”
“I believe you are,” he answered with
an absurdly happy Smile. .
“Then pull yourself together and
come and get your seat.”
“Hadn't we better first get one for
you,” he answered, to which I cxplained
that I was able to look after myself, and
had done so particularly well on that
occasion.
“Assuming that you are correct in
saying that you have placed your bag
on your seat,” he said, in the detached
manner of one approaching an abstract

problem at his leisure, “does the matter
necessarily end there? Have you
noticed that there are ladies about?
Supposing, when you got back, you
found that your bag had fallen off your
seat on to the rack, and that a lady was
sitting on your seat, what then * I can
think of no remedy.”
He was hopeless. “All right,” I
shouted at him, “go your own way.
But it won't be my fault if you get left
behind.”
“I don't feel that this is the sort of
train to leave one behind,” he said. “If
it does, I will try not to blame you.”
My argument with the lady in my
seat was full of good points, and should
have been convincing. Women, how-
ever, cannot argue, so I took my bag off
the rack and stepped out of the carriage
on to the toes of the poor fool, who had
be stirred himself at last, and was sur-
rounded by an orderly crowd of officials.
“Ah,” he whispered to me, “so you
have lost your seat, have you? I con-
gratulate you, though I think it was
more by luck than by your own skill.”
Then to the officials, “My friend is also
in the same position. He, too, holds
a third-class ticket to London, well-
printed, but not transferable, and he
also would be glad if you would find
him a seat.”
“There are none,” said the Station-
master briefly.
“You mean,” said the poor fool, “that
there are seats, but other people are
already sitting on them,” and he started
us all walking down the train to learn
the views of the Guard upon the matter.
Meeting that impatient individual, he
dragged him into the discussion and
brought the party to a standstill, without
apparent purpose, in front of an empty
first-class carriage.

“I always feel,” said the poor fool,
“that it is rude to hustle. For that
reason I allow all the other passengers
to get in before I do so. Moreover, I
have no rooted objection to riding in a
first-class carriage, if it is to oblige a
railway company.” For my part 1 was
searching for another looking-glass, in
which to admire myself, but, though I
found the glass, I could only see in it
the reflection of the poor fool, so I fell
to admiring that instead.

WHY THE BUDGET IS “POPULAR.”
[Addressed to the CHANCELlor of The Exchequen by a typical member
of the class which constitutes the vast majority of the electorate.]
You ask me if your little Bill,
Round which the bees of faction buzz,
Causes my heart a happy thrill?
My answer is : " It does.”
I like a thing that knocks the folks
Who mote and bloat and dance and dine,
That takes the stuff from out their pokes
And puts it into mine.
Not that I care who pays my way;
Such worries never make me fret;
I'm always free, come whence it may,
To pouch what I can get.
The thought of charity I detest
But mean to bear it like a man :
You tap the source, I’ll do the rest
And swallow all I can.
And, though you chop and change your Bill
From what was perfect at the start,
In my opinion it is still
A noble Work of Art.
Whether the owner or the State
Should pay the valuation fee
May be a matter for debate
But makes no odds to me.
Baccy and sugar, ten and beer—
That's all of mine your taxes touch;
A halfpenny there, a farthing here—
It don't amount to much.
That's why I bless the lavish hand
That lets me use for my defence
A thumping Navy, built and manned
At other men's expense.
Nor could I bring myself to blame
A scheme that gives me, free as air,
Schools, baths and pensions, just the same
As if I'd paid my share.
So clear, indeed, its merits lie
That, when you ask me if I view
Your Budget with complacent eye,
I’m bound to say, “I do.”
I can't requite, and you would flinch
At all reward for service done,
But, if you need me at a pinch,
My heart is yours, for one.
Yes, though I’m sure that you would shove .
The hint of payment down my throat,
I shan't forget your proofs of love,
And you shall have my vote.

HOLIDAY RESORTS.
I.-BILLINGSGATE.
This little old-world village has many attractions for those
who prefer a quiet holiday to the more strenuous forms of
recreation now in vogue. Situated on the bank of a wide
river, strange to say it has not yet become spoiled by fashion
nor devastated by the noisy tripper. Its inhabitants and
their curious dialect will afford opportunity for much thought
and speculation, while its exhilarating breezes must be per-
sonally experienced to be appreciated at their full value.
The staple industries are connected with fish, and one can
well imagine how beautiful a sight it must be to see the
boats return at twilight, while the wives and sweethearts of
the gallant blue-jerseyed and blue-languaged fishermen await
them on the pier. All lovers of the picturesque should make
a strong point of seeing Billingsgate. To find it easily, shut
your eyes when nearing the bridge, and when the smell
becomes strong enough to support your weight turn to the
left. Another method is to buy a small scrap of litmus
paper from a chemist, and carry it in the hand; when it
turns pink you are there. -
- II.-CLAPIAM JUNCTION.
This healthy and bracing spot has been for many years
the destination of thousands, and it is so well known that
little that is fresh can be said in its praise. Situated charm-
ingly on the South-Western line, with frequent trains also
kindly supplied by the L. B. & S. C. R., it is unequalled for ,
beauty and refinement.
Few people realise the true value of:

patrons.
seems a mile-and-a-half long, but is in reality only about a
mile, or , by a wonderful subterranean gallery cut through
the solid rock, and full of the finest chiaroscuro effects.
Amusements are many and varied ; a favourite game with
the children is hide-and-seek along the underground passages
a pastime in which their elders do not disdain to participate;
races are also frequently run along the pier and down the
stairs, and the authorities encourage the sport by placing
olicials at the bottom whose amusing duty it is to stop
competitors as they pass, if possible. In fact, for young and
old at this season of the year a stay at so breezy and
salubrious a spot can be heartily recommended.
III.-PICCADILLY CIRCUs.
Opinions may liffer as to the propriety of camping out on
this historic piece of reclaimed meadow-land, but there can only
be one verdict as to the benefits to be derived from a stay
in the vicinity. Unrivalled in its position, a quiet stroll round
the district (taking care to keep to the paths and not to pick
the flowers) is full of interest, while those who are good
walkers may penetrate to the surrounding open country
without fear of straying far from some place of refreshment.
Magnificent views can be obtained, price 6d. per packet of
twelve assorted, and there are several shops where souvenirs
of a more expensive character may be purchased. Excur-
sions can be made from the Criterion (an old coaching inn)
to the Pop (a pretty little creeper-covered tea-house), return-
ing cid the Empire; this journey is often done on foot, but
strangers will be well advised to hire one of the convey-
ances which are provided. The illuminations each might are
on a splendid scale, and if their stay is in any way dull
visitors will only have themselves to blame.

THE RIGHT AGE TO MARRY.
GENERot's CoNTRIBUTIONs of Novelists.
The silly-season discussion evoked by
the recent momentous decision of an
American lady athlete shows no sign of
abatement. Indeed, we have received
letters on the subject from 950 female and
800 male novelists, but as the contribu-
tions bear such an extraordinary family
resemblance we feel that the needs of the
situation will be answered if we print
three, adding a pithy and luminous
epistle from Mr. ALGERNoN AshTON.
SiR,--As one who is happy though at
present unmarried, may I be permitted
to point out that the locus classicus on
this point is to be found in my novel,
The Joys of Judas, in which the heroine,
after attending a garden-party at Burl-
ington House, is kidnapped by the Duke
of Vertigo and immured in a cellar in
Arlington Street. The novel, which was
| published by Messrs. Odder and Odder,
is now in its seventeenth large edition,
and was the special favourite of the late
Emperor of Russi \, Mr. GIAI'ston E, and
the MAudi. MARIE SCARLATTI.
SIR,-May I be permitted to quote, as
bearing on the point at issue, the words
of a famous general, a man of dauntless
courage and stoical self-possession, in
my new novel (already in its thirtieth
huge edition), The Back of the Arab
Mind?—
“General Gray strove man fully to
repress his rage, but the blood was
thunging and ruckling in his carotid
artery, his face was purple and the
whites of his eyes were stricken pink. At
last he could restrain himself no longer
and, seizing his sobbing daughter by the
right ear, he swung her off her feet with
the scream of a wounded gorilla, adding
in a tense whisper, ‘Dash it all, girl,
don't be a blithering idiot, but keep
calm like me.’” (Vol. II., p. 184, 4s. net,
at all libraries and booksellers'.)
ALF ABEL.
SIR,--It is obviously impossible to lay
down a hard-and-fast rule as to the
right age to marry. But I may mention
that after making a careful analysis of
my own 59 novels I find that the
average age at which my heroines
entered the portals of St. George's,
Hanover Square, is 21%.
May I quote the words of a distin-
guished littérateur in my new novel,
The Nicest Woman in Nice, as he
describes the ideal partner?—
“O women in our hours of joy
Inclined to worry and annoy,
When anguish makes the brow to ache
You are a trump and no mistake.”
Yours faithfully,
WILHELM DE KEw.
SIR, - In FIFLDING's day heroines
married at the age of sixteen or seven-
teen. Mr. RiDER HAGGARD's famous
character, Aycsha, was, if I mistake not,
close upon 2,000 years of age when she
contemplated matrimony for the last
time. Surely it ought to be possible to
strike a happy mean, and say that 490
or 500 is the ideal age.

HINTS FOR HOT HOLIDAYS.
The object of this article, other than the
obvious one of filling up the page until
you get to the paragraphs at the bottom,
is to collect in handy form such informa-
tion as the best authoritics consider
indispensable for the proper preserving
of life in these trying times of heat and
holiday. (I don't want to be alliterative:
it just comes.) To do this it has been
ſound necessary to bone many priceless
ideas from the ha penny papers. Apolo-
gies, however, are gladly offered—in the
first place, to the editors of these con-
temporaries, and secondly (and more
diffidently) to the readers of this com-
pendium ; it seems hard lines that they
should have to have it all over again.
There can be no doubt, though, that
everything in this article is essential to
their well-being, and that I have omitted
mothing which I could possibly get in.
Readers, therefore, should cut this page
out and suspend it by a string from the
chandelier, so that it may always be
before them. When they are thoroughly
sick of it they should paint it lightly
with treacle, and then the flies will come
and read it, too.
Now I'm going to begin.
WHAT To WEAR.
Quite apart from Mr. REDFord, there is
one great difficulty about clothing your-
self suitably in this weather; namely,
that the more clothes you put on to keep
the heat out the more heat (somehow)
you keep in. For this reason it is
generally agreed now that, the lighter
your clothes are, the better. In the case
of both men and women it has been
found possible to reduce the weight of
the wardrobe to the merest trifle.
Man's Dress.
1 gold-beater's skin suit . 1 oz.
1 asbestos shirt front . 2 dr.
l diamond tie pin . . . . 2 dr.
1 pr. open-work aluminium
socks. . 1 dr.
1 pr. sandals. - 1 oz.
1 india-rubber collar . 1 oz.
Total . 3 oz. 5 dr.
The idea of the diamond pin is to
focus all the rays of the sum upon your
chest, which is of course rendered in-
mune by the asbestos Richard. Should
you, however, fall into the sea (I shall
refer to this more fully later on) the
india-rubber cºllar will be found both
helpful and stimulating.
Woman's Dress.
Though the feminine wardrobe comes
well within the province of this article,
it hardly comes within that of this
paper. But I am told it works out as
follows:
1 muslim frock . . 1 oz.
Et-caetera . . . 2 oz.
Hat . 12 lbs. 13 oz.
Total . 13 lbs. 0 oz.
WILAT TO EAT.
Let us (says a well-known vegetarian
Harley Street specialist), let us (says he)
consider a typical winter breakfast, such
as was suitable three weeks ago; what
do we find 2
Porridge . . . Hot.
Fish . . . . Beastly hot.
Eggs . . . . Help!
Marmalade . . Heating.
How much more suitable is the follow-
ing:
Canary seed Titillates the diges-
tive duct.
Filleted beetroot Smartens up the mer-
vous system, re-
moves moth, pre-
vents baldness
and makes cycl-
ing a pleasure to
hundreds.
In valuable for
black-and-white
artists.
Grouse Recipes.
(I thought you'd like these now.)
“Grouse Melba”:—Take grouse, re-
move the works, insert ice, and eat with
spoon.
“Potage de grouse”:-Borrow grouse,
rinse in warm water, return, and serve
results with squares of toast.
“Pressed Grouse.” — Bone grouse;
stretch and press, taking care that the
crease is down the front of the leg;
place on sideboard, and say to your
friends, “Lot of trouble that bird gave
me. Stalked it for twenty miles up
stream, and then it winded me, and I
had to give it both barrels.”
You will notice that all these recipes
necessitate the use of a grouse. So
exacting are the dictates of fashion.
Breadcrumbs
How To BATHE.
Rule I.-Before striking out, make
sure that you really have arrived at the
seaside. It is no good starting the
overhand stroke when your excursion
train is still waiting at Balham. In the
case of Southend -— but all the jokes
about Southend were made last month.
I'ule II.-The small jellyfish with
the mauve insides don't sting. If they
do, then it shows they know nothing
about natural history, and to a certain
extent you have the laugh of them.
Rule III.-(We are putting down
these Rules just as they occur to us-
there is no necessity for you to observe
any particular order). – Should you, when
swimming at one of our Southern
resorts, mistake the way back and
arrive inadvertently at France, say to
the first man you meet, “Pardon, mon-
sieur, mais je suis arrivé. Proxime
accessit. Nisi prius,” and explaim to
him how it is that you have no hat. He
will see by this that you are determined
to stand no monsense and he will indicate
the route to England.
Rule IV.-Before taking off from the
top of the cliff ascertain the state of
the tide. It does not follow that because,
according to the London press, it is high
water at London Bridge it will be high
water immediately beneath you. Many
an accident has been caused by for-
getting this.
Iºule V.--Bathing only makes you
hotter, you know. -
WHAT TO TALK About.
The sole topic of conversation in bus,
tram, tube, monoplane, biplane, Salisbury
Plain, club and Carmelite House is “What
is the Right Age to Marry P" Some say
“Now,” and some say “Never,” and
some say, “Well, it depends.” If you
cannot consult a lawn-tennis champion
on the subject you should join the first
group you observe in conversation on
the beach. They are sure to be talking
about it, and a copy of The Daily Mail
is considered sufficient introduction at
the seaside. Just go up and say, “Well,
I think twenty-three,” and ask them all
back to lunch.
Another enduring topic is the Heat
Wave. The thermometer has now reached
the incredible figure of 86° in the shade,
or 128° if you have to cross the road for
an evening paper. You may, therefore,
safely say to your neighbour, “Well, is
this hot enough for you?”—implying
that it is all his fault we are having a
heat wave at all, and that but for him
we should still be enjoying the cool
breezes and refreshing showers of three
weeks ago. If he dares to say “No."
you will be left trying to imagine what
on earth it will be like when the thermo-
meter stands at 87°.

Sporting Notions.

the young pheasants get strong on the
wing.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
Broadlands.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--I'm a happy little
woman I’ve got the Centralians here!
—actually —and that wonderful Captain
Findlay who discovered them — and a
houseful of people to meet them. You've
heard all about them, of course?–llow
Captain Findlay got to the very middle
of Australia, where no one's ever been
before, and found the Centralians, as
he's called them, living there, where
nobody thought anybody could live, for
there's no water to drink—though, as
far as that goes, lots of people here in
England manage not only to live, but
to do themselves awfully well without
ever drinking any water'
The Centralians are the sureetest crea-
tures | About four feet high and copper
coloured, with faces like those old-
fashioned door-knockers. Their dress
is something in the Salome style; and
they're the only race known who don't
seem to have anything that can be
called a language: isn't it delicious 2
(Norty says they could do with some of
them in Parliament') -
The party consists of the Chief, whose
name seems to be l'apparapparoo, his
little wife (her name, as far as we can
make out, is Gig said as many times as
you've the breath), the Centralian Prime
Minister, and some members of the
('abinet. They don't care to live in
houses, and have no use for furniture,
so some of the stables have been given
up to them. I wanted them to dine
with us every evening, but Captain
Findlay says it's best not, as they eat
their meat raw, and generally fight while
they're eating it. They always dance
for us after dinner, however-war-dances,
love-dances, friendship-dances, and all
that sort of thing. We're all immensely
gone on their dances, and are practising
them ourselves.
Professor Dimsdale is here to study
them. As a mental philosopher, he
takes an enormous interest in them. He
particularly wanted to find out whether
they'd any of what he calls “a priori ideas,”
meaning things we know without being
told. I don't know what he (lid to them
to find out, but the Centralian Prime
Minister threw a native weapon at him
and hurt him very much. Wasn't it
unfortunate 2 The poor, dear Professor
had quite a head for the rest of the day.
I can't say whether this unlucky little
incident proved that they had or hadn't
“a priori ideas "--I thought it best not
to ask the Professor just yet.
Oh, my dearest and best, I must tell
you a perfectly lovely story of Josiah
So many of the houses for miles round
want to meet them, that I said I should
give a big garden-party, a fête cham-
pêtre, in fact, for the Centralians.
“Where's the good of giving a fête
champêtre for them ’’’ said the head of
the firm. “The little savages don't
drink wine.” He's most awfully grunty
about them altogether. “You have these
ugly little brutes here and make much
of them,” he said, “and yet you won't
have the Tomlinsons.” (That's the
planter man and his wife that J. knew
out in San Bangador.) “My dear man,”
I said, “can't you see how immensely
chic the Centralians are, and what a
draw they are Just look at the moun-
tain of letters my secky has to wade
through every day from people simply
begging me to have them and put then,
up anywhere, so that they may meet the
Centralians.” -
“I don't care,” he said. “The Tom-
linsons were very kind to me out in San
Bangador. What's the matter with
them 2 I'm sure Tomlinson's a most
respectable man, and his wife's quite a
lady 1"
“En v' lä assez, mon ami!” I told him,
when I could speak for laughing.
“You’ve sized them up exactly.” (I've
left off trying to revise his vocab, and
he's really more amusing aw maturel.)
That night at dinner I fairly brought
down the house by saying, “I put it to
you all whether you 'd care to meet some
tea-and-coffee people named Tomlinson.
I have it on good authority that he's a
most respectable man,' and she's quite
a lady ' ' ' My (lear, you never heard such
a shout of laughter | But Josiah got so
glumpy that I had to smooth him down
later and say he could have the tea-and-
coffee people to stay, if he liked, after
I've gone to the Clackmannans in Scot-
land. That wouldn't do, however. “They
want to meet you and the other fine
people,” said Josiah. “Mrs. Tomlinson
admires you very much.”
Poor little me! What have I done
that I should be admired by a tea-and-
coffee woman 2 If it had been her
husband, now, it wouldn't have been
quite so absurd
I suppose I ll have to give in. What-
ever else Josiah may be, he 's quite
decent about money, and it's his birth-
day this month, when he always gives
me a present.
Do you go in for motor-kiting, my
dearest? We do. My motor-kite gym-
khana last week was a huge success.
The only little hitch in motor-kiting is
that the kites don't always fall in one's
own grounds, and when big, heavy
kites fall on people in roads and fields
and places they get so humpy about it.
In one of our long-distance races a big
kite, quite a young aeroplane, fell on a
farmer-person, who was ploughing or
reaping or some occupation of that sort,
and stunned him. He says his brain's
injured, and that he'll “ have the law
•
of us.”
People are telling un petit conte pour
rire about Fluffy Thistledown at Cowes.
She was there for regatta week with her
yacht, Froic, and one moonlit midnight
when they were winding up the evening
with a game of blindman's buff on deck
Fluffy was idiot enough to fall over-
board. A sailor-man belonging to the
yacht plunged in and rescued her, and
the story ought to end there—but it
doesn't. The sailor-man has long had
an ambition to possess one of the
Humane Society's medals, and now he
sees his way to it and wants it applied
for. Of course the whole affair would
get into the papers in that case, which
wouldn't suit Fluffy at all, because-
well, it was rather a frisky party, several
of the people being supposed to be some-
where else, and there were one or two
that Lord Thistledown (who 's a bit old-
fashioned) had positively forbidden her
to know !
Moral : If you want to keep a yacht-
ing party snug, don't fall overboard.
Norty's so absurd, he says the sailor-
man was very forward and interfering,
and that Fluffy wasn't in any danger,
for she's not heavy enough to sink.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
P.S.. I must get rid of the Centralians
at once. Sweet Pompom and the little
Antarctic spaniel have only just been
saved in time. Those dreadful little
wretches were making preparations to
eat both my darlings /
THE ANNUAL INTERVIEW.
“OUR motto,” said Mr. Salisbury Drake,
“has been simply this : — Surpass Your-
self." Each of us, Mr. ARTH R Colli Ns,
Mr. HENRY HAM ILTON and I, has it over
our desk. It is better even than Know
Thyself.' If you are true to it you can-
not go wrong.”
“And have you surpassed your-
selves 2 " I asked.
“Of course,” said the genial and
popular playwright. “Here is the MS.
It will take London by storm.”
“What,” I asked, “is the line ‘’”
“The line?” said he. “It is every line.
Drury Lane can't be confined to one
line. The mission of the autumn drama
is to summarise life and Society. All
the tendencies of the day meet in our
play.”
“And virtue is triumphant?”
“Obviously,” said Mr. Drake.
“What is the principal scene 2'' I
asked again.
“The principal scene !” exclaimed
Mr. Drake, aghast. “We have five
principal scenes. Five' "
“And what, then,” I inquired, “ is the
first of them ‘’”
“The first,” said Mr. Drake, consult-
ing his MS., “is the Channel. Between
Dover and Calais. A masterly piece of

stage illusion. The hero, having lost
his money, becomes a Channel swimmer.
He is nearly across when a buzzing is

“That,” said Mr. Drake, “represents

“Not very novel?” I suggested.

that we not only have real horses and
real jockeys, but real dirorcées. Ten of
the most popular and beautiful divorcées
in London Society are to appear nightly.
The hero, having acquired a new fortune,
has become a punter. The villain, dis-
guised as a bookmaker, pulls wires to
ruin him again.”
“And principal scene III.?”
“More realism,” said Mr. Drake. “The
South Pole. The hero has joined Lieu-
tenant SHACKLETON, and is seen eating a
pony under the shadow of the Pole.
Victory ! At this moment a polar
bear, which has been approaching him
stealthily, throws off his mask, and is
revealed as the villain. A terrible
struggle ensues, and the hero escapes
only by climbing the Pole.”
“Admirable!” I cried.

“Ah!” said Mr. Drake, “here we
return to the gay life again. The
Horse Show. The high jumping in
progress. All the winners at the recent
show are coming. It will be a most
effective scene; no one need ever go to
Olympia again.”
“But how does the drama progress?”
“There will be a few words at the
beginning of this scene. The hero is a
competitor, the villaim is disguised as an
attendant and he frightens the horse.
The hero is thrown.”
“Is that easy to manage?” I asked.
“Not easy, of course, but possible.
An admirably trained horse. A feather-
bed on the stage.”
“Yes?” I said.
“The accident,” Mr. Drake resumed,
“brings us to the last Scene of all—
another triumph of realism, but of a
different kind. The operating theatre in
a hospital. The hero has to undergo tre-
panning. The students are all there,
laughing and joking. The wounded man
is carried in. The amaesthetic is applied.
The surgeons operate. It is most thrilling.

way to the dangers of skeeping on the

THE Joys of REJEction.
REFUSED! Ah me, before I took the header,
What desperation dangled on that word
The one thing doubtful (if I could not wed her)
What kind of suicide was least absurd ;
Wan were my features as a chunk of Cheddar
Ere it occurred. *
And now it seems the blow was not so blasting,
The impulse to expire has been subdued,
The stern resolve to fade away by fasting
Has somehow vanished, and, when breakfast's
brewed,
I still sit up (the guise of anguish casting)
And take some food.
Nay, there are consolations; love's a trammel
That woefully impedes the cardiac pump;
But grief is like a pendant of enamel,
A thing of beauty, an eternal trump —
(I should not marvel if the Bactrian camel
Boasts of his hump).
'Tis no small victory that men should rank you
As one whose heart contains a bleeding sore,
Whose soul is swathed in cypresses and dank yew,
Dead to romance and deeming it a bore;
Who murmurs, “Not for me, dear boy, I thank you ;
Been there before.”
Sweet also is the way that damsels cluster
About the hero of a high despair,
Whose bosom braved the amatory fluster
And might with due expenditure of care
(However hard it may have come a buster)
Be worth repair.
This is the most sublime of sorrow's chances:
This is their meaning when the poets sing:-
“'Tis better to have grieved for vain advances
Than never to have known the Love-god's sting";
To cure a life-long woe is what entrances

If you think we are going to lower ourselves by saying any-
thing about “fouls” you are quite mistaken.

the man whose muscles are not altogether in trim. The rest of the time
he can be drinking in the good seaside or country air."--Daily Mail.
The reader is warned not to pause after the word “drinking.”

ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
IT SEEMs iNhu MAN to give him Away, BUT
OF The
House of Commons, Monday, August 9.
—It was N. Box APARTE HALDANE who first
mentioned half-and-half.
Reference made in enticing circum-
stances. After brief interval, House
back in Committee on Budget Bill.
Seem to remember many weeks already
devoted to pleasant task. Occasionally
sat up with Bill all night as if it were
a fractious infant. Take up Paper to
make cheering discovery that there are
more amendments set down on it than
there were when work first began.
Interesting this as feat of legerdemain.
In actual circumstances alarming. If
process continues we shall about Octo-
ber 1 find ourselves faced with a few
score more amendments than were
tabled on May 1.
Since Bill last in Committee someone
in Unionist camp has run up white flag
in token of surrender. Incident led to
angry resentment. So far from contem-
plating retreat, Opposition is resolved

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Even in palmy days of Parnellite ob-
struction, all-night sittings were not
nearly such lively entertainments as
fancy of outsiders feigned. With the
site value of undeveloped land as topic
of debate, and this night the sultriest
of a coy summer, dulness deepened to
ultimate chasm of depression.
FENwick didn't mind sitting up for
his country's good. But no use trying to
snatch a quarter of an hour's sleep as
others did. His mind oppressed by
news from Wylam. Seems, accord-
ing to local paper, that ten days ago
high jinks were carried on in grounds
of local landlord, whereat Lloyd-GEORGE
and all his works, specially the Budget,
were denounced. That all right as
far as it went. Still open to a land-
owner to invite his political friends
to gather in his park. What FENwick
objected to was alleged circumstance
that detachment of men from H.M.S.
('alliope, with band playing, gun trailed,
arrived on scene.
“What steps does the FIRST LORD of
THE ADMIRALTY propose to take to put a
stop to such practices? "
Thus at meeting of House this after-
noon he catechised McKENNA. Turns
out that some one has blundered. The
warlike crew of the Calliope were men
in buckram. What ...ſ. happened
was that a private company of boy blue-
jackets made holiday in a field a
hundred yards away from place where
political meeting was held, “an event,”
the ADMIRAL drily remarked, “in which
the lads took not the slightest interest.”
Captain CRAIG, naturally resenting this
invasion of his peculiar field of operation,
shouldered FENwick aside, pulled from
breast-pocket a news-sheet printed on
orange-hued paper and took the floor. Ite-
lated how emergency man—oddly enough
“name of Walker" — returning from
fair in County Cavan was fired at from
behind a hedge, shot in face and chest.
Wanted to know from IRISH Solicitor-
GENERAL whether “the murderous assail-
ants” had been arrested and what steps
were taken to protect the hapless victim
of disorder against further outrages?
Reversing proverbial order of proce-
dure, CHERRY made four bites at the
story. (1) Thomas WALKER is not an
emergency man. (2) He has not been
fired at. (3) Did receive wound in the
face, but told police it was caused by a
fall. (4) Fact is, he was shooting rabbits
when accident befell.
How these things get in the papers
others besides Mr. Crummles wonder.
Business dome.—Clause 10 added to
Budget Bill in Committee.
Thursday, 6.10 A.M.–PRIME MINISTER,
wending his way homeward, first peep-
ing round gateways to see if there were
any ladies in waiting, confessed himself
a little weary. His 'orny-landed brother
who “wants eight" hours as the maxi-
mum of a day's labour little recks what
the First Minister of the Crown goes
through between the time of his up-
getting and the laying down of his head
on an untaxed pillow.
That by the way. It 's all in the
day's work and must be cheerily met.
What depresses the PREMIER on this
fair summer morning is reflection on
the lack of gratitude in mankind.
The Budget Bill, as introduced and
as dealt with in Committee up to yester-
day afternoon, involved the principle
of placing on the private owner
“DR. FFL.L.”
“The reason why I cannot tell,”

the burden of cost of Land Valua-
tion. On that particular point the
Opposition centred all their forces. They
protested that to resolve to clap fresh
taxes on the hapless landowner, and
then to insist that out of his slender purse
he should pay the charges of the process
of valuation on which the tax is to be
levied, was an exercise of ingenuity
closer akin to the subtle cruelties of the
Inquisition than to the practices of
English statesmen. -
For some weeks, including an occa-
sional all-night sitting, CHANCELLOR of
ExchEQUER has on this point presented
inexorable front. Yesterday afternoon,
his countenance wreathed in smiles, his
hair brushed with exceptional care,
something of a gala appearance in his
dress, PREMIER announced abandonment
of the obnoxious proposal, and threw the
charge of valuation upon the State.
Having made this clear, pretty to see
him stand with downcast eyes, a slight
flush on his countenance, his lips pursed
in shy smile. Expected outburst of
applause from gentlemen opposite. Not
quite sure that, creating precedent,
PRINCE ARTHUR and WALTER LONG might
not cross over, raise him shoulder high
and carry him round, whilst Bob CECIL
sang solo, “For he's a jolly good fellow,”
the rank-and-file of the Opposition
insisting in chorus that “So say all
of us.”
So far from this expectation being
realised, blank silence fell on benches
opposite, broken later by turbulent
stream of angry denunciation. To re-
lieve the private owner at expense of the
State was, in PRINCE ARTHUR's view, in-
finitely worse than original proposal.
Lord Bob so agitated that, introducing
an autobiographical note, he misquoted
a familiar couplet. Said he:
“When I was young I had no sense,
I bought a shilling for eighteen pence.”
It would be rude to challenge the
assurance frankly put forth in first
line. The second is not exactly what
was written by that voluminous poetaster,
Amon.
That, however, a detail due to heat of
weather and debate. Fnough for PRE-
MiER, going home with the milk in the
morning, to meditate on man's ingrati-
tude to man. - -
“Hit high or hit low,” he murmured,
“I can't please the Opposition.”
Business done. — Ministry perform

HOBBIES THAT PAY.
Pot LTRY. -
CoMPARED with most of the hobbies in
which amateurs indulge, poultry farming
possesses inestimable advantages. It is
more virile than stamp-collecting; less
fatiguing than big-game-shooting; in-
finitely healthier than palmistry.
Previous experience is not only un-
necessary – it is undesirable. People
who have had experience on poultry-
farms nearly always seek to discourage
beginners, and exhibit a peevish reti-
cence when confronted with the most
convincing figures and data.
The country is better than London
for poultry-farming, though it is true
that an ideal scratching-ground is
vacant on the north side of the Strand.
Choose a site as near a town as possible,
since you have to think of marketing
your produce; and it is almost essential,
if you wish to make a profit on your
eggs, to be in a position to sell them.
Many beginners fail to grasp this point
and have the hardihood to blame the
industry ! The industry is all right.

this contrivance, a flavour which com-

these disorders fall under one of three
heads--foxes, motors and the gapes. It

the first two, as they invariably prove
fatal, and the only thing to do is to face
the loss. In the case of a bird which

counts for so much in these matters.
The complaint known as gapes pre-
sents fewer difficulties, and yields, as a
rule, to suitable treatment. The dis-
tressing symptoms exhibited by its vic-
tims are the result of ennui and want of
rational amusement; unless you can at
once introduce some variety into the
birds' lives you may expect the worst.
You can best achieve your object by
moving your farm to some less depress-
ing neighbourhood, where the surround-
ings will prove congenial. Skegness
has a great reputation, and the tonic
qualities of its air have restored many a
jaded bird to health and spirits. Of
course, if you live at Skegness, this
suggestion does not apply, and you must
seek some other locality; bearing in
mind that complete change is the essence
of the treatment.
These remarks do not cover the whole
field of poultry farming, but they go a
long way.

SURPRISING DISCOVERIES.
A MEMBER of the staff of The Daill
Chronicle, in the course of a taxi-cab
drive, recently made the surprising
discovery that the chauffeur was an
ex-theatrical manager. A most interest-
ing narrative was extracted from him.
As the Chronicle sapiently remarks:
“With this new experience, in which he
has proved himself to be a man of
resource with no false pride, Mr. ——
---— would be most useful to any
There are times, I admit, when I hanker
after the luxuries of Vienna, but the
consciousness of a simple life spent in
furthering the interests of my fellow-
men compensates for everything.”
With his new experience (as Mr.
Crowe puts it), in which he has proved
himself to be a man of admirable effici-
ency, the Archduke should be most
useful to any member of the L.C.C.
requiring an enterprising individual to
act as his private secretary. In any
case it is to be hoped that he will act as
Berlin, to savoid repetition, as ‘Athens
on the Spree,’ and he objected to it as a
vulgar periphrasis. Of course I wasn't
going to stand that, so I left. I was
then six months on The Daily Maelstrom,
but they sacked me for spelling petrol
with an e. Finally, as my supplies ran
short, I thought I would take up this
business, as I had formerly belonged to
the Sandwich Golf Club, and worked
hard in order to pass the examination to
obtain the police licence. The examina-
tion was pretty stiff I can tell you, but
theatrical manager requiring an
enterprising individual to look
after his interests.” It is plea-
sant to know that within the last
few days adventures equally stimu-
lating have fallen to the lot of other
journalists. * -
Thus, while recently returning,
in one of the L. C. C. trams,
from his residence, Mr. FitzGeorge
Crowe, the famous editor of
P. A. P., made the soul-shaking
discovery that the conductor was
none other than the missing
Austrian Archduke who dis-
appeared some years back under
the alias of Joh ANNORTH. Slightly
condensed by Mr. Crowe's masterly
stylo, the Archduke's story runs as
follows:– * , ,
“I was for several years an
artificial-eye-maker's assistant, but
wearying of that trade went into
business as a bath-chair proprietor
at Denmark Hill. The demand
for these vellicles, however, proved
fluctuating and precarious, and I
was obliged to sell my entire stock,
except one bathchair, in which I
and my family lived for two years
before I got my present job.
“Now I am happy again. As
an Archduke, I own, the thought
of the unearned increment which
I enjoyed weighed so heavily on
me that I suffered from chronic
depression and sought refuge in
a morganatic marriage.

mition. The work, however, is
severe, and I confess to a craving
for the old Fleet. Street grind.
But, of course, I should want a

With his new experience, in
which he has proved himself to be

most useful to any newspaper
steeped in the actuality of London

came away with great ease owing to the
age of the animal and my healthy dietary

For poisson there are the gudgeons
which we caught in Auntie's hair met,
an admirable article for the purpose.
Never go for a hungry ramble without
an aunt.
We come now to the joint, and here is
discovered the usefulness of chancing
upon a lost sheep in a desolate spot.
Had it been more open and populous we
could never have killed it so success-
fully, while skinning and quartering it
would have been more difficult-and
perilous. As it is, the meat is bound to
be rather tough, but as the week wears
on it will get better and better; unless
of course our forest larder is discovered.
For vegetables there are the nettles,
which are far better than spinach, the
pignuts and the wild carrot.
Next the game. Here we attack the
moorhem which so providentially fell to
my aim, accurate throwing being of the
highest value to the countryside dimer,
and with it a dandelion salad, upon which
the oil from two or three handfuls of
tadpoles has been squeezed.
For sweets there is nothing better
than a little wild honey from an old
tree, but in default of this we may eat
the blossom of the clover and honey-
suckle. For dessert the crab-apple and
the sloe. For coffee the powdered sorrel,
and for the cigar the famous “Flor de
Wiggs” from the nearest cabbage-patch.
As for the supplementary articles, we
can get them, too: bread should be easy
when the fields are so full of corn, and
for butter of course you have only to
seek the buttercup. The milkwort is
equally rich in milk. Mustard grows in
every field. Salt, I will admit, bothers
me, but why not do without it?
The total cost has been the match that
lit the fire. Even a duke might live in
this luxury, and, indeed, it was largely
because I and my paper so feel for the
ruined ducal industry that I wrote the
article.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
To anybody suffering from a surfeit of divorce-problems who
is in need, as he ought to be, of a complete change, I heartily
recommend The Castle by the Sea, designed by H. B. MARRIOTT-
WATson and built by METHUEN. There, within smell of the
Atlantic, he may revel in the spirit of adventure and in an
atmosphere of momentous and incredible events. He will
hob-nob with the fugitive Sir Gilbert, a sportsman with an
unconscious philosophy, and fall in love with the beautiful
Perdita, who not only says she is, but is, adorable. My
student of the morbid will not have been in this Devonshire
resort for twenty pages before the fresh air will have filled
him with a new energy, and he will the
ancient smugglers' caves de-
voted to modern nefarious
uses, to escape with his life
(if any) in his hand. Later,
in the calmer moments of
reaction, duty may compel
him to criticise an excess of
melodramatic and romantic
incident which inclination
prompted him to enjoy, but
even he will admit the charm
of humour which permeates
the whole. He will miss his
accustomed innuendo and
habitual problems, and may
wonder why on earth I recom-
mended to him so juvenile a
book. Then, if he is the
clever lad he pretends to be,
he will suddenly understand.
I knew that the bright and
healthy change would do him
good.
What I like least about The
Way Things Happen (LANE) is
the title, because, as a matter
of fact, the events in Mr.
Hugh D3 Sélixcovitt's amiable
fantasy fall out after a fashion
~
kitten-and even this is a matter of outside evidence, not
unconnected with a recent appearance of the same animal in
a published interview with its distinguished owner.
You would think that it needed, in these days, an excep-
tional gift of nautical bluff for the crew of a tramp to board a
liner, smash its machinery, pinch the contents of its safe,
row off with the richest passenger, and then turn up later on
from another quarter with offers of salvage. Yet ARTHUR
BRERNER, the author of John Saint (WARNE), contrives to give
plausibility to this adventure, as conducted by the mate of
The Four Winds, who gives his name to the book. By the
aid of a little moral philosophy, not too expensive, and a
répertoire of allusive comparisons well within the range of a
popular encyclopædia, Mr. BREBNER wants to persuade the
average reader that there is
something stronger in this tale
than mere stuff for boys. John
Saint, ex-gentleman, and con-
structed for better things,
failed to get rid of the relics
(eventually resurgent) of a
conscience, and this failure,
while it spoiled his chance of
being a really perfect villain,
was the recurring source of
internal conflicts which give
a certain quality of romance
to a book in which the femi-
nine element, commonly sup-
posed to be requisite to ro-
mance, is quite subordinate;
for the one woman in the cast,
though necessary to the plot,
has only a very small speaking
part. Mr. BREENER, if he has
not exactly achieved litera-
ture, has at least written a
good breezy tale, that smacks
true of salt seas, and, unlike
the poor tramp (“blistered in

not at all that of actual life.
Indeed, “The Way things are
Written About" would have
been a truer label for what
I feel to be rather a suc-'- -
cessful literary exercise than the result of honest observa-
tion. Miss Paul was a maiden lady with a limited income
who inhabited the top floor of a house in the Marylebone
Road. The lodger below was one Dr. Paveley, who, a
cºnfirmed mysogynist in the first four chapters, asks Miss
Paul to marry him in the fifth. There is also another
suitor, very rich, who meets Miss Paul in an omnibus, and
proposes to her a few days later. This is the one that she
weds; and then, a little brutally, Mr. DE SéLINooURT kills the
husband in a motor accident, and leaves his heroine a rich
widow. However, the last part of the book is by far the
most sincere; and well told is the development of the
ex-Miss Paul into the almost legendary benefactress of her
poorer neighbours. On the whole, if Mr. DE SELINCOURT eyer
thinks of dividing his works after a certain celebrated
example, The Way Things Happen, despite its artificiality,
will go justly under the heading of Novels Pleasant. That
is why I am the more sorry that, of all the characters, the
only one in which I can really believe is the Blue Russian

‘FRANKie DEAR, SHALL I READ TO YOU while YOU DO THAT’”
CRICKET AS SHE IS REPORTED.
THAT’s right, kick me, and I beg
yours, was the order of things at Clacton
yesterday as the crowd surged through
the clickers to watch the match played
between 17 of the district and a bag
of nuts brought down by Artie Maclean
(who ought never to play again in a Test
Match) of Rutland. Special interest was
attached to the game as his side included
Douglas Cairns, the wiggly-wizard or
disappearing-man king.
Artie called bird and looked chirpy;
so sauntered seventeen out to a wicket
that looked a bit MARIE LLOYD, but really
was a veritable pride of Pont Street.
| Followed Charles Burge and Tenent, the
latter taking a nice four-pennorth off the
first ball, a sea serpent on the legs.
However, on trying to repeat the stroke,
up went the black flag at the other end,
only to be hauled down a minute later,
as apparently the ball had been played.
“I never said——” but that's another
story. Anyhow, the next ball caused the
death rattle; a sort of ball that shrieks,
turns, apologises, and then gently fells
| the middle ash! In ambled Alfredo,
but, after a deep dive at the first, came
up again at the Pavilion steps. The
next of the side made the score mount
up like the 2d.'s in a taxi, and it looked
like a case of all day and Martin for
WOL. CXxxWii.
the Shrimpers; but with 372 for 5
on the blinds Artie called the cows
home.
The local innings reminded me of a
funeral, and several willows were weep-
ing ; Cairns wasn't, but then he had the
job; and Walter Barley, at the other
end, looked like a man who had the key
of the hutch in his pocket.
With the exception of Grunt, the home
skipper, none of the side did anything
to put on clean flannels about. That
Grunt hit some pretty how-do's, and
everybody was sorry when he was sent
home by a creeper. . .
It should be mentioned that Lawson
was unable to field, as in opening a
telegram he slightly strained his heart.
Taken as a whole the game was a
pretty tidy regatta. Everybody was
pleased, and the folk had something to
tell Auntie of. Met a chap afterwards in
the guard's van; said he to me, “They
could play and we couldn't, and that's
the diff.”

sort of thing now that London is so

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW FOLKS AT HOME.
London (Eng.).
DEAR SADIE,--You must have been
thinking hard things about poor little
me for not writing before, but I’ve been
too busy to breathe, almost, tearing
around and sight-seeing; so you must
overlook it this time, and I will be good
in future. We're located here at present,
me and Pop and Cy, that is. The hotel
is a one-horse shack in some ways and
only about six floors up, but, as Pop
says, it hasn't burnt down yet, which is
something to be thankful for, and if
nothing happens we may finish the
vacation here. -
Sadie, you must make the trip next
year. It's simply great, and I haven't
been disappointed yet. The place is full
of Britishers and they're just like what
you read about in the magazines—stupid
and homely-looking (the women I mean),
and so polite. Only yesterday I boarded
a car on Fleet Street—it's one of the
main roads here-in a rush-hour, and
the conductor said, “Thank you,” when
I paid him Store-keepers just the same,
too. And everybody speaks with such a
ſunny accent, you wouldn't believe; but
I can understand them pretty well now,
and get on O.K.
Some of the side-shows here are worth
the passage money to see, and you'd be
tickled to death if you could come
rubbering with us. Right here, about a
couple of blocks from the Parliament,
there's one of the cutest abbeys I ever
clapped eyes on, with the queerest old-
time fixings and things that you can
imagine. I could have spent a whole
forenoon there, almost, I was so stuck
on it; but we're pressed for time and
Pop's schedule doesn't allow for much.
I'm sending you a postal by this mail,
so you can see for yourself what it's like.
You would laugh, Sadie! Cy came
rushing in just before lunch as mad as
a wet hen He went into one of these
Strand saloons and asked the bar-tender
(they are females here) if she could
shake a cocktail, and she said, certainly
she could ; so ('y called for a Highball,
and the woman gave him gin-and-some-
thing and charged him eighteen cents
for it, and then the man next to Cy told
him the right price was twelve cents for
a gin and bitters. Well, Cy got mad
and scratched up the dust and claimed
that it was not a fair deal, and the girl
said, yes it was, the lemon-peel made
the difference; so Cy asked her if she
thought he'd got bats in his belfry 2
and she said the interpreter was out
having his dinner, but she'd try to
understand if he'd speak slower | Pop
cracked his sides almost when he heard
about it.
We went to a swell crush at a country
house last week and I enjoyed myself
considerable, but I wish Pop had not
offered to buy the place, because
warned him not to, and the man it
belonged to turned as cold as a clam,
and dropped the glass out of his eye,
and said he could not entertain the
proposition for an instant. But that's
Pop all the time ! spot cash and clear
the deal | This one did not pan out,
and Pop was side-tracked for once.
Well, I met a terrible good-looking man
there, and he brought me some straw-
berries and fal-lals, and we had a good
time munching. He's called The
O’Stickjaugh (though it's pronounced
quite different), and you mustn't call
him Mister, or My Lord, or anything
like that, and he's head of the whole
push, and all the other O’S.'s don't
amount to shucks when this one is
around. He told me that England is
played out and that only the Kelts are
any use. It appears his clan is Keltic,
so I asked him why he didn't stay
up in his hills and make homespun and
haddocks, and he seemed a bit rattled,
and said I couldn't be expected to under-
stand these things all at once. Then
there was another man, an Englishman
this time: he came and sat down and
said that if I wanted anything he would
tell somebody to get it for me ! I looked
at Cy (he was running around like a
dog at a fair) and told the man I did
not believe in slave labour, and why
did he look so miserable, anyway? Was
it money or an entanglement 2 Well,
he just polished his glass and said he
was worried to death about his golf,
because he had gone clean off his form
and could not understand the reason, by
Jove 1–Land's sake
Oh, Sadie, do you remember the
Saddlebags 2 Well, I ran across old
man Saddlebag at a picture gallery
and he looked as though he had dropped
a nickel down a grating, so I let him
take me to lunch. He told me Mrs.
Saddlebag had divorced him on account
of his wearing spectacles and looking
mean in consequence. He pleaded
myopia (I'm not sure about the spelling)
at the trial, but the judge said he was
not g ing to let any technical point
interfere with justice; so they jarred
loose, and the old man got his walking-
papers, and Mrs. Saddlebag has gone
in for jigsaws. I thought you would
like to know.
There was a railway accident here a
little time ago, a silly little thing—only
two men killed ; and the papers are
cracking on about it so, anybody would
think that something had happened

we had a crack, and she gave me all her

real sorry for her; but she's got a con-
versation book, and you know what a
persevering girl she is.

but the luck was against them. Every-

Eccited and conſident Chorus. “HOW S THAT 2 "
" . . * . . .
OUR VILLAGE CRICKET CLUB.
Umpire. “I
wAsx't Looking—Do IT AGAIN.”
OPERATIC REALISM.
MR. SANKEY MoRRELL, the great impre-
sario, writes to us to call attention to
some remarks made by Mr. CHARLES
MANNERS apropos of his production of
Rienzi at the Lyric Theatre.
Mr. MANNERS is reported as saying:—
“I have never attempted anything on so
grand a scale before. Gladiators, Roman
soldiers, and diplomats will all be suitably
arrayed. There will be five ambassadors and
their suites in one of the scenes, and in the last
Act the sacking of Rome will be depicted with
realistic effects that reach the limit of safety.
I shall have as many as 140 people on the
stage at one time, and it will be no easy matter
to find room for them all.”
On this, Mr. Sankey Morrell comments
as follows: “Without wishing to insti-
tute any invidious comparisons, I wish
to point out that at my forthcoming pro-
duction of Carmen at the Agricultural
Hall effects will be introduced which
have never before been seen on any
stage. The brigands in the Third Act
have been imported from Catalonia at
great expense, and their booty includes
several dozen frozen Chinese pigs,
twenty butts of dry ginger ale, besides
a captive balloon and fifty strings of
Spanish onions. In the last Act, by
kind permission of Lord CARRINGTON,
several real Irish bulls will be intro-
duced ; the cigarettºs consumed by
Carmen and her lady friends will be of
the Sinn Fein brand, and the smoking
of them will be depicted with realistic
effects which reach the limit. The
stage crowd will include Carthaginians,
Basques, Celto - Iberians, Troglodytes
and Phagocytes, all of whom will be
not merely suitably but sumptuously
arrayed. I may add, that by way of
testing the musical capacity of the
governing classes I have sent invita-
tions to every peer in the realm to attend
the opening performance.”
HINTS TO HIS GRACE.
[“Thirdly, he (Sir Edward Grey) holds that
some owners of property could earn something
themselves. I wish he had indicated in what
manner; but as he seems to be kind enough to
consider my unpaid work more valuable to the
public than anything I could earn, I am ab-
solved from the necessity of considering what
remunerative employment I could undertake at
the age of sixty-three which would bring in a
sufficient income to be of any appreciable assist-
ance to me in meeting increased taxation.”—
The Duke of Northumberland in “The Times.”
SIR EDWARD GREY is silent. Let us
try to supply some useful suggestions.
That money is to be made in endless
ways even by sexagenarians is beyond
question. Nor is the age any bar to
enterprise. Look at Count ZEPPELIN,
well over seventy, but simply crammed
with beans. Sixty-three is nothing.
There are, to begin with, always the
Music Halls. If the Duke cared to try
his luck there he would make a fortune.
No need to do anything but walk on,
describe his income and expenditure,
say a few terse things against the
Government (always a popular line to
follow in the Halls), and retire. He
could, of course, if his artistic conscience
demanded it, learn some small trick,
a feat of juggling, a song, a dance,
but it would be a superfluity. The Duke
alone would be the attraction.
GREAT SENSATION.
REAL DUKE APPEARs NIGHTLY.
VICTIM OF BUDGET ON VIEW.
Such lines as these would fill any Hall.
There are other not less simple means
of acquiring wealth. There must be in
London alone, even now in August, a
thousand hostesses who would willingly
contribute a handsome sum for the privi-
lege of including the Duke in their next
dinner-party. He could not go to all,
but he might put himself up to auction
for, say, thirty evenings. The only
effect would be that his income-tax would
cost him more.
There are company promoters also
who would be very happy to arrange for
the Duke's alliance—or we are greatly
mistaken.

Of Illin.
U.J. That's what I always say; but it's a hard world, and
it 's no use complaining.
L. A. But what do you think of life, Uncle John?
U. J. Well, if you must know, I think it's a doosid serious
thing, especially when the bills come in.
L. A. Bills, Uncle John ” How do you mean?
U. J. Ah, you'll find out some day. It's this way. Just
when you think you’re going ahead like a streak of lightning
your tailor and your bootmaker and your haberdasher and
the man at the flower-shop send you their blessed accounts,
and, instead of having a nice pocketful of money, you find
you've got a bit less than nothing. It's cruel luck, but it’s
no good fighting against it. I've done my best, but they’ve
always scored off me in the end.
L. A. But you bought the things, didn't you, Uncle John?
U. J. Oh, I daresay I bought 'em all right; but paying
for 'em 's quite another pair of shoes, as you'll find. If this
mouldy Government were any good they'd pass a law
abolishing bills for ever. I'd vote for 'em right enough if
they'd do that. As it is, a poor beggar never gets a chance.
Think of the things I might have done if it hadn't been for
bills. They're the curse of a fellow's life, and that's the
long and the short of it.
L. A. But the other day, Uncle John, you said women
were the curse of existence. I heard you say it, you know.
U. J. Did you now * Well, you weren't meant to hear it,
anyhow.
L. A. But what did you mean, Uncle John 2
U. J. Meant what I said.
L. A. But do you think women and bills are the same
thing? When you met Miss Hickson on Tuesday—
U.J. Ah, you've just hit the difference there. I could
meet the women every time, bless their little healts; but as for
meeting a bill it's death to me. Never could do it. Besides,
no bill ever chucked a man--sticks to him like a leech, you
º," it comes to the same thing in the end, misery and
all that. --
L. A. But you don't seem very miserable, Uncle John.
U.J. Don't I, old man? I daresay I manage to keep a
laugh going, you know, but in my heart I'm as desperate as
they make 'em. Musºn't give the show away, though. Never
say die.

L. A. But then you do think life is a very serious thing,
Uncle 2
U.J. Serious isn't the word, my boy. It's simply
gloomy - that's what it is.
L. A. But I wonder what Papa meant when he said you'd
never be brought to take a serious view of life? He said
that to Manma.
U. J. Oh, he said that, did he? Well, your father doesn't
understand me, that's all. He never did and he never will.
L. A. But he said he could read you like a book.
U. J. Like a book, did he 2 I wish he 'd read my book on
the last Newmarket Meeting. He 'd understand a thing or

L. A. Mamma said he mustn't be too hard on you, he must
think how you were brought up.
U.J. There's an unnatural girl for you, and my own
sister, too.
L. A. Oh, Uncle, you mustn't say that. She does like
your jokes, you know. You always make her laugh; and I've
seen Papa laugh when you've been playing the fool.
U. J. Playing the what 2 Come, I say, old man, that's
hardly respectful, is it? -
L. A. I’m sorry, Uncle John, but it was Papa who said it.
He said that was your strong point.
U.J. Well, it's lucky I’ve got one.
L. A. Yes, Uncle, it is. Then you do advise me to consider
life a serious thing?
U. J. Certainly; I’ve said so before.
L. A. Papa says the same thing, and so does Mamma, and
so does Mabel. But you said yesterday that a chap who
didn't get a bit of fun out of life was no use to anybody.
U.J. That's right enough, too.
L. A. But if it's such a serious thing, how am I to get

Who, looking on these clods that foul the earth,
Declines to see in them his fallen brothers,
And feels his spirit outraged when he sees
That he must breathe the selfsame air as these ?
Or is it youth that feeds his pen with gall,
Great youth, that sees the world with perſect clarity,
And, never doubting, gives their due to all,
Untainted by the vice of Christian charity?
Only the penetrating eye of youth
Sees with such certainty where lies the truth.
Or is this rage assumed ? Methinks I hear
A tender-hearted greybeard softly sighing;
Upon his eyelid lurks a tell-tale tear
For this sad spindrift round about him lying;
Then, shamed of so much weakness, he conceals
In these wild words the fact that he still feels.

A LINE FROM THE WILDERNESS.
My ThoughtFUL FRIEND,--I can never
thank you sufficiently for the picture-
postcard of Lynton which the postman
brought me this morning. As I said
to the policeman on duty at Welling-
ton Street to-day, “The next best thing
to being on the Devon coast with Miss
Middleton is to have her picture-post-
home.”
card of Lynton on your mantelpiece at
He waved back a motor-bus,
and replied briefly, “You shouldn't say
your “mantelpiece'—Lady GROVE doesn't
like it.” “I don't like it myself,” I
said, “but the landlord won't do any-
thing.” -
By way of return I am sending you
thirteen picture-postcards of the House of
Commons. I only wanted one, but the
lady in the shop said it came cheaper if
you took thirteen. I don't believe it
did. As far as I can make out, it came
elevenpence dearer. Anyhow, note the
pigeon on the extreme right as you
face the picture; he is said to be Mr.
HALDANE's favourite.
It is no good your trying to make me
jealous with your tales of high diving
and shipwrecks. We are having just as
good fun in London. Sometimes we go
for drives, and sometimes we wander
down by the river; and after tea we stroll
into the park and tell Colonial strangers
delightful stories about gold bricks.
We often make as much as £200 a
night in this way. As we pocket the
cheque we add, “Oh, by-the-bye, do you
know that other very funny story about
the Spanish Prisoner? I must tell you
that.” And if they haven't heard it
before it means another £100. There is
a simplicity about our visitors which is
very touching.
In the evening I console myself with
a new game, which we will play together
when you come back (if you are not too
proud). This is how : you open an
A. B. C. railway guide at random, and
choose which of the twenty-odd places
on the two pages you will go to. Then
the other person does the same; and
then of course you tell him how much
nicer your place is than his. (It doesn't
sound much, but neither would cricket
if you tried to explain it in a letter.)
You choose your place partly by the
name, and partly by the county it's in,
and the distance from London and the
number of trains a day, and so on. It
happens sometimes that you select a jolly-
sounding place like Bayswater, and then
find at the last moment that there are so
many trains to it that it can't be in the
Lake District after all. So you have to
be careful. I may tell you in confidence
that the real snip winner on the Bays-
water page is Bealings ; you can
only get there once on Sundays. I
should say it was on the sea, wouldn't
you? We could sail round Bealings
Bluff and have tea at that little cottage
by the coastguard station. Amd if you
must do your high dive, there is a place
halfway down Bealings Ness—— Oh,
jolly! t
Don't go and get wrecked on a desert
island without me, there's a dear. I spent
a night on an uninhabited island once,
but that was before I knew you. Oh, I
did really—off the coast of Scotland.
(“Tales of my Dead Past.”) But there
were no goats and no axes and no
nothing. Only me. I had a keg-I
mean a flask of brandy, though, and a
rifle. And I made a footprint in the
sand overnight and really staggered
back next morning at the size of it. It
must have grown. But it rained a good
deal, I remember, and I fell over a small
cliff in the misty dawn, and the flask
leaked, and –– I don't know who works
these things; I may be wrong, but it
didn't seem to me to be quite entering
into the spirit of the adventure. :
I saw a postman in spectacles yester-
day for the first time in my life; not
that I ever particularly wanted to see
one. Why should they be so rare 2 This
one was a very good specimen, I should
say. You never see them at Lynton, do
you? Own up. After all, you ’ve got
the hills and the sea, and you can't have
everything.
Can you stop the side-stroke for a
moment to listen to me? I need your
advice. You're a young woman of tact
and-and-well, tact, that's the word I
Want.
A year ago I was asked to a wedding,
and I resolved that—even if I was the
only one—I would send a present to the
bride. After a lot of thought I decided
on an egg-boiler. These are very handy
things, because when you have visitors
you can say casually to them, “By the
way, I was just thinking of having a
lightly boiled egg — I wonder if you
would care to join me?” And there is
no business of ringing up the chef.
Well, I was out of London at the time,
so I wrote to David, and told him that
he was to buy and dispatch a wedding
present for me. I said that I didn't
want to spend more than a million
pounds, and that there was no need to
spend less; that in fact I had fixed upon
a million pounds as the sum I could
afford, and that he could please himself
what he chose, but that I had rather
thought of egg-boilers.
By a curious chance David knew a
man whose one idea in life was to make
egg-boilers by the thousand for the
people in shops who try to sell them. As
an old friend of David's this man was
prepared to let him have a boiler upon
wholesale and incredible terms. For a
million pounds he would sell him a work
of art for which the ordinary retail
jeweller would charge no less than five
million. How did that strike him 2
It struck David so forcibly that he
planked down the million, placed my
card in the place where the methylated |
spirit goes, and forwarded it to the lady.
Several days later, of course, I received
a grateful letter from her, and some
days after that I wrote David a similar |
There you would say the story |
Olle.
should end ; but it doesn't. For I
have just received an invitation to the
double wedding of the lady's two sisters;
and the thing that worries me now is—
what on earth can I give them 2
You do see why, don't you? It has
either got to be egg-boilers again or it
hasn't. If it hasn't, then it must be sugar-
siſters, and David doesn't know anybody
who sells sugar-siſters.' I still can't afford
more than a million pounds; but this
time it will only look like a million, and
2dith and Daisy will be sure to notice |
the difference. I never saw the egg-
boiler, but from all accounts it was in
solid gold throughout, with, perched on |
top, an emblematic hen, cut out of some
still more precious metal — radium
perhaps. What will they think, to have
plated siſters palmed off on them 2
When Molly was the youngest
But if we go in for egg-boilers
again, won't the family think it
rather funny ? It doesn't show much
originality; the mind appears to work
in a groove. They may even fancy that
I have a kink somewhere. I see them
introducing me to the company—the
tapped forehead, and
whisper, "Ahem: egg boilers."
Now then, give me your advice, and
then go on swimming again. It's
David's fault for being so grasping.
You see that, of course. So I suggest
that he should simply give his whole
mind for the next month to the problem
of finding a man who makes sugar-
siſters. That he should then follow him
to Brighton, push him off the pier, and
rescue him . . . and so up to the ware
house together.
But still more, of course, you see that
in the beginning it arose from my
being out of London. That is what I
am trying to bring home to you. Poor
girl, stuck miserably on the Devon
coast—what trouble you may be laying
up for yourself A. A. M.
The Daily Mail is giving prominent
announcement in its columns to the fact
that it has issued a book that “will not
sell.” It asks
“Can any one explaim to us why it is that

Our opinion is that this beggarly result
is due to nothing but lack of advertise-
ment.

IN NEW BATHING CONFECTIONS
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE FUTURE.
[The long sittings in the House of Commons leads The Mail to antici-
pate a new kind of Cabinet Minister—one chosen first of all for his
physical endurance.]
Not his to lead a rapt, submissive retinue,
Not his to hear his lavish praises sung,
Not his to catch a whispered “Sir, we've met in you
The leader sought—ambitious, brave and young.”
For him no hall where gather, simple witted,
The slaves whose fierce devotion naught can quench :
Such things he never knew who late has quitted
The utmost private bench.
And mum in hall, no man than he was mummer
When duty bade him haunt the House he hated;
The Lobby, too, he dodged. Of no new-comer
Is knowledge less, are fewer yarns related.
Yet they who know their REDMoNDs (John and WILLIE R.)
* Their BALFOUR, GEORGE, and GREY, their mem'ries hunt,
Wondering why his face too is not familiar
Whose place is now in front.
They whisper queries; watch the abject terror
With which his earliest question he surveys;
They see him rise, and note the childish error
Which marks how small his lore of City ways . . . .
Then one explains: “He can't keep hearers captive,
- Nor keep accounts, and yet, the truth to break,
There's none to present needs who's more adaptive,
For he can keep awake.”
"Here a splendid dinner was in waiting, and ceremony being brushed
aside, everyone soon put hunger into the arena of forgetfulness.”—
Ballymena Observer. -
Other things were put into the arena too, no doubt.
THE GILDED INVASION.
We hear that Mr. Wolney Sprague, who recently crossed the
Atlantic with a number of other prominent New Yorkers, has
converted Wharfedale, where he rents the largest grouse moors
in Yorkshire, into a perfect paradise. The once unsightly
ruin of Bolton Abbey has been transformed into a magnificent
mansion of sixty storeys high, the top ten storeys being
apportioned to the army of 500 beaters who accompany Mr.
Sprague on the moors. Mr. HARRY PAYNE WHITNEY, it will be
remembered, employs only 100 men in this capacity, and they
are obliged to find their own lodging. Mr. Sprague's beaters,
on the other hand, have permanent quarters in the sky-
scraping château of their munificent employer. Their wives
are each presented weekly with a new pearl necklace and a
Gainsborough hat, and their children are educated free at
Eton and Roedean.
At the unanimous request of all the inhabitants this
beautiful tract of country has now been renamed New
Yorkshire, and (if the consent of a famous Soap king can be
obtained) the Wharfe will be rechristened the New Hudson.
Mr. Volney Sprague, whose wife is a daughter of the Egg
king, Mr. Columbus Harridan, travelled from London to Leeds
yesterday in a special bomb-proof, fluorescent, platinoid Pull-
man car. During the journey Mrs. Sprague wore in rapid
succession the tiaras of SEMIRAM is, CLEOPATRA, MESSALINA
and Queen Elizabeth, which form an insignificant portion
of her personal jewellery, and her guests were regaled with
choice chansons by Madame MELBA and Signor CARUS0,
accompanied by M. PADEREwski. The cost of this railway
concert alone is estimated at £100,000. The company
also included Mr. Larry Pottinger, the Lard emperor;
Mr. Ira D. Joram, the Tripe Tsar, and Mrs. Stanleyette
Bangs, only daughter of Mr. Agrippa Bangs, the Onion
archduke.

LONG SHORE NOTES.
IN an article on “Little Creatures of
the Seashore”, in The Daily Mail of
August 19, Mr. W. BEACH Thomas states
that “the whelk, is an easy and most
amusing animal to observe.” Personally,
we have never had the good fortune to
catch this British univalve in one of his
lighter and more frivolous moods, having
generally seen him and his brother Gas-
teropod, the periwinkle or wilk, depressed
by their humiliating situation on a
barrow, and awaiting pin-pricks up a
side-street. We therefore refrained from
pursuing his acquaintance. But with
a title like Buccinum whdatum, fami-
liarised in North Britain by the pet
name of “Buckie,” no doubt he has his
humorous points, not the least being a
proboscis capable of boring through
other molluscs' shells and devouring the
astonished inmates.
Among the other entertainers who are
enjoying a successful season this year
around our coasts, we may mention the
large influx of sharks, reported by the
local papers as having quite a vogue.
While absolutely innocent of man-slay-
ing intent, they are responsible for de-
lightful little interludes of sauve-qui-
peut in mixed bathing circles.
The jelly-fish also are on their mettle,
especially in the Solent and along the
Yorkshire littoral, doubtless in the latter
case with the idea of titillating an
aquatic Cabinet Minister like Mr. SAMUEL.
The blennies and gobies are appeal-
ing this summer, as usual, to a more
juvenile clientèle, and rely chiefly on
their absurd appellations for their draw-
ing power. . . .
Among the more recent fauna of the
sea-shore we cannot refrain from noticing
the remarkable outbreak of “Gems,”
“Cadets,” and other sea-pierrots. They
are to be found on the front at all states
of the tide, and occasionally their wheezes
and antics will beguile the wandering
naturalist into a laugh. Children and
unsophisticated observers are, at any
rate, delighted with such finds, which,
on the whole, quite deserve to rank with
whelks as fun-makers of the sea-side.

—At three o'clock this afternoon wild
hope for a moment flushed the weary
breasts of Members. As usual, SPEAKER
took Chair at a quarter to three. Five
minutes sufficed for devotions; then came
Questions. Only twenty on paper. Sure
sign of failing energy. Of the score,
only half-a-dozen put and answered.
Then fell awesome pause. SPEAKER sat
motionless in canopied Chair. The few
Members present moved restlessly, here
and there exchanging whispered obser-
Vations.
What had happened? What was
coming to pass? Was it possible that
end of tether had been reached, limit of
endurance overpast? Was the Session
crumbling to pieces? Would it be all over
before one of the PREMIER's colleagues
in the Cabinet could say, “’ENERY

for convenience in heated weather. In
criminal courts, when no cases are set
down for trial, Judge is presented with
white kid gloves. Was there point of
analogy? Did the SERGEANT-At-ARMs's
unusual garniture import absence of
material for work and therefore prompt
dispersal?
As these matters were pondered, mes-
senger hurriedly approached SERGEANT-
AT-ARMs and whispered in his ear.
The gallant ex-Guardsman, of whom
few to-day think as having served with
his Colours in the Crimea, lightly
loosening sword in scabbard, rose,
marched to door opening on Lobby, and
stood on guard. Afar off sounded the
ghostly cry, “BLACK Rod!” SERGEANT-
AT-ARMs closed and barred oaken door.
Straightway was mystery fathomed.
BLACK Rod was coming with message
bidding the Commons attend in other
House to hear Royal Assent given by
Commission to certain Bills. We were
simply waiting for the messenger. That
was all. As the SPEAKER passed out in
obedience to the summons, blank dis-
appointment reigned in bosoms of late
lighted by flash of hope.

behind the Chaplain, distinguished amid
a scanty group of Members. On the
Woolsack, robed in scarlet gowns slashed
with ermine, crowned with black cocked
hats, are seated three figures which at
first sight look like relics of Mrs.
Jarley's famed waxworks. They are in
truth the Lords Commissioners appointed
to give royal assent to long catalogue of

The wigged - and - gowned Reading
Clerk presently standing halfway down
the Table proclaims their individuality.
“Our most dear cousin and councillor,
RoDERT THRESHIE, Lord LorºDURN,” he
recites, bending low till almost his
abashed forehead touches the unsympa-
thetic floor.
The cloaked figure in the centre, rais-
ing three-cornered hat, reveals plump
pleased countenance of Lond CHANCELLOR.
“Our most dear cousin and councillor,
Lord ALTHORP,” continues the Reading
Clerk, with another convulsive movement
threatening to dislocate his spine.
Figure to left uplifting three-cornered
hat, we look upon the fair young counte-
nance of “ Bobby '' SPENCER, whose
memory is kept green in the House of
Commons he long adorned.
“Our most dear cousin and councillor
Lord DENMAN.”
Another creak in back of tall gowned
Clerk: a hat is liſted by another of the
trio on the Woolsack, and behold ! the
martial visage of the Captain of the
Honourable Corps of Gentlemen - at -
Arms.
Not a single Peer gracis with his
presence the waste of Opposition benches.
On Ministerial Front Bench, all alone,
picture of heavenly resignation, sits
Viscount WolveRHAMPION, Lord Presi-
dent of the Council. By his devotional
figure rests on the bench an ordinary
modern top hat which, designedly or by
accident, lends sardonic touch of realism
to picturesque scene. From bench be-
hind, otherwise sole representative of
our old nobility, Lord BLYTHE looks on.

shoulder the humbly desired boon.
“Le roy le veult,” he said, preserving
the Norman French in which Plantaga-

Where the fine delicacy of the little
part shone was in the sharpening of
tone, the clipping of syllables, the less
generous turn of head over shoulder,
as assent was reiterated. Per contra,
there was throughout no scamping of
the reverential bow towards the Wool-
sack prefacing every citation of name
of a Bill.

FADER illumined debate with one of
those phrases the world would not

he remarked that once the principle and

from Ministerial benches. Quick as

Which was very careless of them.

GETTING IN THE FIRST WORD.
I KNEw it would happen. When I
see a man riding on a bicycle with a
bag of golf clubs on his back, I always
expect the worst. When that man is
myself, I am sure of it, and ride accord-
ingly. Indeed, the worst had happened
to me several times that day, but I was
riding so slowly at the time that nothing
resulted save a ripple of laughter among
the rustic population.
But with George it was different. His
bag was large, his brake broken and his
speed terrific. So I picked him out of
the ditch at the bottom of the hill, bent
the bicycle as straight as it would go,
and explained to him how well I knew
it would happen. He thanked me for
the information and demanded a rough
estimate of the damage.
“The bruise over the left eyebrow,” I
answered, “I assess at one-and-sixpence,
but against that we must set the im-
proved appearance of the nose. Internal
examination may reveal that the appen-
dix . . .”
“I mean the damage to the bicycle,”
he said shortly.
“I think you are well rid of that,” I
advised. “You will forgive me for
saying this, but I, who have observed
your conduct at the tiller, think that,
excellent though you are in other re-
spects, you are not a fit and proper
rson to be a bicycle owner.”
“No 2" he said reflectively. “Per-
haps I am not. That is probably the
reason why I do not own a bicycle.”
“Come!” I said. “It is not as bad
as all that. Though we cannot point to
any definite part and say, ‘Here is a
back, there a front wheel; here is a
handle-bar, there a saddle,' what remains
is still a bicycle.”
“Maybe,” said George ; “but not
my bicycle. Perhaps you would not
mind taking the raw material home and
explaining your theory to James. When
he learns what it is, he will probably be
interested.”
“So,” I said, “it is James's bicycle, is
it? The James whom I know is a hot-
headed man, prone to complain. Come,
George, we must go straight home, rout
out this James person, and start the
abuse. . . . It is very kind of you, but
I think I can manage my own bicycle
best, and it is no trouble. Perhaps you
would not mind carrying my clubs : ”
+ + + + +
It was a tense moment when we met
James. For ourselves, we should have
been glad to say nothing, but we felt
that we must monopolise the conversa-
tion. James, on the other hand, was
obviously bubbling over with remarks
which he must not be allowed to make.
So, “James,” said George sorrowfully,
“I am ashamed of you.”

“What,” cried James, turning to me,
—“what does he mean 2 I . . .”
“George is annoyed with you,” I said,
“ and I must admit that he has a right to
be very annoyed. I like you very much,
James, but was it not a little mean 2"
“Look here . . .” James shrieked.
“It isn't right,” said George, with an
unflinching eye fixed upon James. “You
know it is not right, and no amount of
blustering on your part will carry it off.
To leave a bicycle about in that dan-
gerous condition was little less than
criminal. As it happens, nothing worse
has resulted from your carelessness than
a broken golf-club or two (which I will
allow you to replace at no great expense
to yourself), a severe shock to my nerves
(which I overlook), and irreparable
damage to my face (which Thomas
assesses at fifty shillings). But suppose
something serious had happened to me,
suppose . . . all, no! it is too horrible
to think of . . . could you ever have
forgiven yourself?”
Again James started to speak, but he
got no fºrther than the preliminary
oath. “Surely you are not going to
argue about it?” said George, with
astonishment. “It is bad enough to
possess such a bicycle, for that is almost
suicide. But to leave it about in a
prominent position, practically to invite
me, who never did you an injury, to risk
my neck upon it in happy ignorance . . .
James, aren't you a little ashamed *"
“What do you mean,” got in James
at last, “ by smashing my bicycle?”
“James,” I said, “ that sounds to me
a little weak.”
“James,” said George, “I did not
expect you to apologise, but I did expect
you to show a little decent feeling. Oh,
James' "
James appearing likely to get out of
hand, George took my arm and turned
from him. “Let us leave him,” said he,
placing his other hand in front of his
eyes. “I cannot bear to think that this
is my real brother James.” And to
James as we moved off – “You will find
me in the billiard-room when you want
to ask my forgiveness. I am not angry
with you, James, only a little pained."

that confronted England at the moment,
he maintained, were the possibility of
foreign invasion and the insufficiency of
her home-grown corn supply. In the
face of these awful crises he proposed to
outline a scheme which would render
the country immune from external dan-

named ("NUT. To members of what he
would term the Dreadnut School he could
only say, “Try a six weeks' course of my
diet, and all your cares and worries will
cease for ever.” There might come a
day when the safety of England would
be said to lie, not, so much as of old, in
her wooden walls but in her wooden
walnuts. In conclusion he advocated
an armed nutrality and reminded his
hearers of the glorious motto of their
association, “Ec nihilo fit nihilum ”

THOUGHTS ON HEARING A BAND.
SING, Muse, if so conventional a theme
May serve to rouse you from your
summer's dream,
By what mysterious influence a band
The most unlikely creatures may coin-
mand.
Sing not of nomad Teutons who encamp
Beneath the rays of some suburban lamp,
Whose brazen instruments emit a sound
As cheerless as the post they circle
round:
Such is not music, and the notes they
play
Drive not men's cares but men them-
selves away.
But rather, Muse, for illustration take
A regimental band of British make,
And then behold a miracle achieved,
Which must be seen before it be
believed 1.
The deafening drum, the penetrating
fife.
Awake the office boy to signs of life;
Observe him, as the distant sound he
hears,
Lay down the ruler and prick up his
ears;
He scans the room with comprehensive
glance,

chance,
Slips from his stool and hies him to the

Of duties left undone and left belind ;

That is a feat by martial music wrought
Which baffles reason and surpasses

IF India has been lucky in her KEIR HARDIE, so has Egypt
in her HALL CAINE. With the unerring instinct of the casual
tourist that gifted author has detected at a glance the mis-
chief underlying the administration of such mediocrities as
Lord CroMEſ. In The White Prophet (published by HEINE-
MANN in a novel and delightful form) he proves by the simple
method of repetition that
“Though East be East, and West be West,
Yet shortly the twain shall meet,”
and by quotations from hymns of both districts, amplified by
socialistic sermons of his own, he dismisses any difficulties
which might have been supposed to exist in the matter of
religion. He has conceived the ideal Englishman in Charles
Gordon Lord, an officer ready to argue at any length his
superior's orders, and to obey them or not as may seem good
to his higher morality. This splendid fellow, acting as
deputy to the local prophet, and associating with a host of

Guinea was discovered before you went there. We have
work like yours coming in every day.” Nor is it pleasant to
be reminded, as the author very rightly does remind us, that
Germany had taken advantage of the labour and seized the
fairest portion of New Guinea before the British Government
woke up and made a colony of what was left.
“Susannah and Several Others” might serve as a generic
title for most of Madame ALBANESI's books. For since
Susannah's time Caroline and Mary and Louisa, and now
The Invincible Amelia (METHUEN) have all figured on the
bookstalls in the sweet simplicity of their Christian names.
Amelia is as fresh and piquant as the rest of the sisterhood,
and as truly feminine as the style of punctuation affected by
her godmother. Only she should have been called the
Incredible instead of the Invincible. I don't believe a
dashing young Dreadnought cruiser of her, build could have
sailed in such shallow waters and so close to the shore
without running aground. As she resolutely declined to do
any honest work, and as she had nothing a year but her wits

well-chosen words, “It cannot, must

tary but corpulent tears roll down cast-
iron cheeks, and “sainted ” mothers
languish by easy stages, he brings
himself, his love, Egypt and the world
to a prosperous convalescence. If Mr.
CAINE cannot claim to be inspired, he
has certainly spared himself no pains.

possible if she were an out-and-out

Admiral MoRESBY's Two Admirals (MURRAY), “a record of
| life and service in the British Navy for a hundred years,” is
| a work of exceptional interest.
The two admirals of the title
are Admiral of the Fleet Sir FAIRFAx MoRESBY, and his
| son, the author, and between them they touch all the years
| of the period which is bounded by the Victory and the
Dreadnought. Thus there are pages which make one long
to read MARRYAT all over again for the sake of being able to
believe every word. There are yarns of the convoy of gold
| from Mexico, with officials all feathering their own nests, and
| even British captains on the make; yarns of Chinese pirates
and of Celestial cunning; of Japan in the days of the feudal
Daimios, with warriors still clad in black burnished chain
armour; of the first British ironclad ; of wrecks and wreck-
age-looters on the coast of Ireland; of many more things,
indeed, than I can mention. Admiral MoRESBY, it will be
remembered, has already published a book on his discoveries
in New Guinea, and some considerable amount of space in
the present volume is given to an account of his explorations
in the then unsurveyed waters of that part of the world. His
achievements included the addition to the chart of many
first-class harbours and navigable rivers, and upwards of a
hundred islands, and the finding of a shorter route between
Australia and China. All this is good reading, but it is not
good to read that the Admiralty hydrographer, when he
received the report, remarked, “Discoveries, Captain MoRESBY!

not allow him to do till the last page of the book.

Since the flight of Gomersalez wondrously pursued; .
Yet although our lives be moulded by a different rule, .
Still the cap you deftly fashioned fits the modern fool.

From the midmost fount of laughter may we drink our fill—
Watch you, RABELAIs' disciple, sunshine in your eyes,

to the office of the syndi-

“Miranda (thinking what

for wealth is so keen we
must turn aside sometimes,
or the pace would kill us.”
“Ferdinand (mournfully):
“Ah! yes. The money

to twin monsters of more

“Miranda (aside); ‘Good

can see the impromptu manufacturers

piqued him of late, and at first he thinks
he will go in for the smartly cynical.
But finally he hedges: ‘Mixed, please,'
he says. The shopman gives him an
envelope, and he puts down a guinea
and goes out.
“During soup he has an unpleasant
fear that Miranda is not going to play
the game, and that his guinea will be
wasted. Their talk flags; but then
Miranda has recourse to the diner-out's
best friend, and something like the
following results:—
“Miranda (indifferently): “Were you

has it not? Perhaps we have lost the
taste for tragedy." -
“Ferdinand (without turning a hair):
“Precisely. On the modern stage the
Tragedy is that one ends with billing
and cooing, and the other with killing
and booing.’
“Miranda (with increased respect):
“Really, that is rather apt. Have you—
but no, it's not possible—have you, by
chance, anything new to say about the
Budget 2'
“Ferdinand: “Certainly. The Budget
is like a lobster; it sheds claws after
position—and all for one guinea.”
“Yes,” replied Ponker's captious
critic, “but having, like a spendthrift,
used up his guinea's worth, won't there
now be a sudden falling off-won't she
think him sulky or something?” .
“Then,” said Ponker sharply, “the
remedy is easy. He should go in for
two guineas' worth.” * *
“When dinner came up I scratched my name
on the dark paint very effectively with the
knife (which is, I think, made of tin); and when
I had finished “Annie Bell, Suffragette,' the

It is on record that Mr. A. J. WEBBE,
on being bowled by an underhand
from MoRDECA, SHERwin, the Nottingham
wicket-keeper, remarked, on his return
to the Pavilion, that it was like being
run over by a donkey-cart. What then
does it feel like, after trying in vain for
years and years to perform even the
simplest feat of equilibrism, to stray
into the Coliseum and find a sea-lion
doing it with ease? Humiliation is not

all the strange and varied animal
kingdom, the least likely creature to be
taught to balance billiard-cues on its

catch clowns' hats, and generally behave
like CINQUEVALLI, one would probably,
after mature thought, have said the
sea-lion. Yet here are sea-lions who do
these things to perfection; and having
done them, roguishly lead the applause.
Captain FRED Woodward's sea-lions at
the Coliseum are wonderſul. They
understand, they laugh, they talk, they
play, they are artists. They do ex-
quisitely difficult things to perfection.
The lion may be the king of beasts in

JOHN.
IIE's a boy,
And that's the long and (chiefly) the short of it,
And the point of it and the wonderful sport of it;
A two-year-old with a taste for a toy,
And two chubby fists to clutch it and grasp it,
And two fat arms to embrace it and clasp it;
And a short stout couple of sturdy legs
As hard and as smooth as ostrich eggs;
And a jolly round head, so fairly round
You could easily roll it,
Or take it and bowl it
With never a bump along the ground.
And, as to his cheeks, they're also ſat-
I've seen them in ancient prints like that,
- Where a wind-boy high
In a cloudy sky
Is puffing away for all he's worth,
Uprooting the trees
With a reckless breeze,
And strewing them over the patient carth,
Or laising a storm to wreck the ships
With the work of his lungs and cheeks and lips.
Take a look at his eyes; I put it to you,
Were ever two eyes more truly blue 2
If you went and worried the whole world through
You'd never discover a bluer blue ;
I doubt if you 'd find a blue so true
In the coats and scarves of a Cambridge crew.
And his lair
Is as fair
As a pretty girl's,
But it's right for a boy with its crisp, short curls
All a-gleam, as he struts about
With a laugh and a shout,
To summon his sister-slaves to him
For his joyous Majesty's careless whim.
But now, as, after a stand, he budges,
And sets to work and solemnly trudges,
Out from a bush there springs full tilt
His four-legged playmate—and John is spilt.
She’s a young dog and a strong dog
And a tall dog and a long dog,
A Danish lady of high degree,
Black coat, kind eye and a stride that's free.
And out she came
Like a burst of flame,
And John,
As he trudged and strutted
Sturdily on,
Was blindly butted,
And, all his dignity spent and gone,
On a patch of clover
Was tumbled over,
His two short legs having failed to score
In a sudden match against Lufra's four.
But we picked him up
And we brushed him down,
And he rated the pup
With a dreadful frown ;
And then he laughed and he went and hugged her,
Seized her tail in his fist and tugged her,
And so, with a sister's hand to guide him,
Continued his march with the dog beside him.
And soon he waggles his way upstairs—
He does it alone, though he finds it steep.
He is stripped and gowned, and he says his prayers,
And he condescends
To admit his friends
To a levée before he goes to sleep.
He thrones it there
With a battered bear
And a tattered monkey to form his Court,
And, having come to the end of day,
Conceives that this is the time for play
And every possible kind of sport.
But at last, tucked in for the hundredth time,
He babbles a bit of nursery rhyme,
And on the bed
Droops his curly round head,
Gives one long sigh of unalloyed content
Over a day so well, so proudly spent,
Resigned at last to listen and obey,
And so begins to breathe his quiet night away.

MORE BOOKS THAT WILL NOT SELL.
I.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I also have written a book which for
some unaccountable reason does not sell. It is not about
Germany : any ass could understand a book about Germany
not selling; it is a story of love and adventure, containing,
in fact, every ingredient that the public wants, and yet it
does not sell. The title is Passion in Mid-air (this shows
how up-to-date it is) and the publishers are Messrs. Bills and
Moon, and yet it doesn't sell. Can you suggest a reason 2
I can't ; but I will gladly give any one five pounds who will
liſt its circulation to 32,000 copies. Yours, &c.,
ORVILLE UNREDD.
II.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--The Daily Mail seems to think it
occupies an abnormal position in being unable to sell more
than 32,000 copies of a book. But I can assure it that the
experience is more common than it fancies. I, too, am with
it. My last volume of poems, The Heart's Tuning-fork,
stopped well under that figure, and apparently cannot recom-
mence its sales without the assistance of some violent cataclysm
of mature, art or artifice. German statistics naturally make
no claim on an Englishman; but here is a book full of
appeal to their sympathy and understanding. I adjure you
to help me unload a few more copies. I will give away
a copy of Mr. Lloyd-GEORGE's Limehouse speech and a portrait
of one of the DARES with each. Yours, etc., P. N. NoNFIT.
III.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,--I have written a book, copies of which
were sent to the PRIME MINISTER, the Archbishop of
CANTERBURY, the Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL, Mr. Lio) D-GEORGE,
Mr. BERNARD SHAw, Mr. EUsTACE MILEs and Lord Roberts,
each of whom replied that he was greatly honoured to be the
recipient and would lose no time in reading it—and yet it
does not sell. How to make it do so is my constant thought
day and night. The book, one would have thought, would
have gone like hot cakes, since it deals with the important
question of chemical manure and the best means of making
two blades of grass grow where only one grew before. What
could be more valuable than that 2 And yet we have sold
up to the present moment only thirty-two copies. I await
your sage counsel. Yours, &c. SCRUTATOR.
IV.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I have written a book which won't sell,
and I can't think of any reason except that it is not interesting
enough. But surely that is absurd. Yours, &c., QUERIST.

“HOLD.”
I KNow, where Hampshire fronts the
Wight,
A little church, where “after strife.”
Reposes Guy de Blanquely, Knight,
By Alison his wife,
I know their features' graven lines
In time-stained marble monotone,
While crouched before their feet re-
clines
Their little dog of stone!
I look where Blanquely Castle still
Frowns o'er the oak wood's summer
state,
(The maker of a patent pill
Has purchased it of late),
And then through Fancy's open door
I backward turn to days of old,
And see Sir Guy—a bachelor
Who owns a dog called “Hold”
I see him take the Tourney's chance,
And urge his coal-black charger on
To an arbitrament by lance
For lovely Alison;
1 mark the onset, see him hurl
From broidered saddle to the dirt
His rival, that ignoble Earl—
Black-hearted Massingbert'
Then Alison, with down-dropped eyes,
Where happy tears bedim the blue,
Bestows a valuable prize
And adds her hand thereto;
My lord, his surcoat streaked by sand,
* low muttering curses
hot,
And with a base-born, hireling band
He plans a dastard plot!
+ + + + .
'Tis night—Sir Guy has sunk to sleep,
The castle keep is hushed and
still,—
See, up the spiral stairway creep,
To work his wicked will,
Lord Massingbert of odious fame,
Soft followed by his cut-throat
staff;-
Ah, “Hold’ has justified his name
And pinned his lordship's calf'
A growl, an oath, then torches flare;
Out rings a sentry's startled shout;
The guard are racing for the stair,
Half-dressed, Sir Guy runs out;
On high his glittering blade he waves,
He gives foul Massingbert the point,
He carves the hired assassin knaves
Joint from plebeian joint!
+ + + + +
The Knight is dead—his sword is rust,
But in his day I'm certain “Holl"
Wore, as his master's badge of trust,
A collarette of gold :
And still I like to fancy that,
Somewhere beyond the Styx's bound,
Sir Guy's tall phantom stoops to pat
His little phantom hound !
FEEDING THE LONDONER.
I. -
“JAMES,” said George, “our common
friend Thomas tells me that there is a
big Furnishing Establishment in the
West End which gives a free lunch to
its better-class customers. I have in-
duced our common enemy, Henry, to
believe that he wants a new carpet for
his study, and I have undertaken to pur-
chase it for him. I am bound to confess
that he did not appear too willing to
assent, but I kept him quiet by telling
him that he could always return the
carpet if he didn't like it.”
“Thomas has mentioned the shop to
me, too,” I said. “He told me that he
started with a chair and went on order-
ing cushions till the Superintendent
invited him to lunch. Then he stopped
ordering cushions and countermanded
the chair. He would not, however, give
me the name.” . - - -
“He did not want to tell me either,
for he is essentially greedy. But I
doubted his word with such persistent
derision that he had to tell it me in the
end. I further elicited from him the
information that they placed an ample
wine-list before him, but that the prices
were so obviously marked on it as to
lead him to suspect that that part of the
meal was less hospitality than a commer-
cial transaction. So he ordered a small
lager, and found out in the end that they
stood alcohol too. He says that the
thought of what he missed spoilt his
day's pleasure. Let us go and purchase
this carpet and have a pleasant meal
together, not omitting to benefit by
Thomas's experience with the drinks.”
II.
We arrived at the shop at about one
o'clock, feeling that at that time one gets
the best light for carpet choosing.
“We have come,” said George to the
Superintendent, “to buy a great deal of
furniture — carpets, rugs, mats, more
mats, rugs and carpets. Then of course
we shall want some rugs. If you are
prepared to undertake an enormous
order, let us begin with the carpets. . . .
What is the time, James?”
I looked at my watch. “Hello!” I
said, “would you believe that it is very
nearly, if not actually, lunch-time? I
had no idea it was so late.”
“Time for lumch’” said George. “Well
I never !” and we both turned to the
Superintendent appealingly.
* - - xx
I catch your meaning, gentlemen,
he said, with conspicuous inaccuracy.
Then to an uninfluential assistant, “Show
these gentlemen some carpets at once.
They are in a hurry to get away.”
This first failure cast a little gloom
over the carpeting, and we were both
determined not to see anything we liked
until we were certain about the meal.
When we discovered further that the
assistant was a new hand and was not
even aware of the existence of a
restaurant on the premises, we felt ||
that this would never do. So George
started looking over another pile of
carpets, while I wandered off in search
of the Superintendent.
“Mr. Superintendent,” said I, “we
find that this is a bigger job than we
thought. Your assistant is a good fellow,
but I doubt if he is experienced enough
to deal with an order of this magnitude.
So I thought I would come back to you.
We have plenty of time now, as we are
too late for our luncheon party in the
City, and shall have to get a snack where
we can.” The Superintendent made no
movement. “Look here, suppose I
and my friend got our lunch now and
we all went along afterwards and dealt
with this colossal order of ours, when
you are less busy 2”
“Just as you please, Sir,” said he.
“What?” said I.
“I said, “Just as you please, Sir,’” he
answered. * *
I gave him time, and then continued:–
“You don't happen to know of a con-
venient place on the spot where we
could get a bite?”
“If you go out of the front door and
turn to the left . . .” he began.
“Come,” I said, candid for the first
time in my life, “I have told you that
ours is going to be the most enormous
order you have ever had. I understood
you provided a little refreshment for
your better-class customers?”
“We used to,” he said. “Now we
have abolished the restaurant and leave
our customers to pay for their own food,
ourselves making a corresponding de-
duction from the price of the goods
purchased.”
III.
When it had been agreed beyond all
chance of misunderstanding that each
paid for what he ate, George and I
lunched simply at an A.B.C. shop. I
suppose Henry scored in the long run,
without knowing it, for I have no doubt
that he returned the carpet that we
chose for him without troubling to loºk
at it twice.
-
“The argument would be that the Lapps
were to eat blubber, the English beef, the
Italians figs and daisies, and the Cingalese rice,
each group by virtue of its geographical
position.”—The Daily Mail.
Now we know why Antonio went away.
Mr. W. W. AshLEY, M.P. (the famous
philanthropist) on the Budget:—
“The next time they heard a Minister de-
nouncing the Lords, let them ask him who it
was he dimed with the night before.”
The dinner wouldn't have been as bad
as that, though.

THE DANGEROUS LIFE.
[“Live dangerously.”—Nietzsche.]
THERE are who love the levels
Of Brooklands course. There are
Who, like demented devils,
Devour the track of tar.
They find the chance of spilling
So gloriously thrilling,
They love the pace that's killing
To driver and to car.
There are who do not shudder
To man the submarine
And turn the fearless rudder
To Ocean's deepest green.
Down, down their ship is taken
With snorts that well might waken
The ever-slumbering Kraken
No mortal eye hath seen.
There are who fain would follow
Young Icarus and fly
More swiftly than the swallow
Across the summer sky;
And though the breezes blow them
Away to sea and show them
The Channel far below them
They gaze with fearless eye.
But if the brass be threefold
About the breasts of these,
How many times must we ſold
Our valiant hearts with aes 2
For though we Cockneys try not
Frail submarines, and fly not,
The wonder is we die not,
Such risks our marrow freeze.
There's nothing in the Strand which
With safety may be done:
Suppose we take a sandwich
And glass of milk at one,
Who knows what weird bacillus
May enter in to fill us
With tubercle or kill us
Before the set of sun ?
When motor-cars are skidding
With all their wonted zest
We bravely do the bidding
Of NIETzsche with the best ;
When taxis, flying faster
Than whirlwinds, bring disas er
And need of sticking-plaster,
We follow his behest.
Then microbes by the billions
In tube-liſts may be found
To catch us toiling millions
Who travel under ground.
Your so-called brave have none done
The things we've every one done.--
'Tis we pale sons of Londom
That live the riskſul round.
The Grammar of the Air.
A Good deal of Aero-Anglo-French was
ejaculated last week around the piste at
Rheims, and the vocabulary of aviaticm
still seen.s somewhat in a state of flux.
A short and satisfactory word for the
motion of aviators in flight is wanting.
We would suggest a ready-made one in
the verb av-oir = “to 'ave” or “av.”
This is conveniently bilingual, and
would come in handy for the Inter-
national Meeting at Wembley. Most
Britishers know as far as “avez-vous '' in
French, and this would now stand for
“Do you proceed through the air in a
flying-machine?” or words to that effect.
“En avant j'ave!” (not j'ai) would be
the bird-man's utterance at the start,
equivalent to the golfer's cry of “Fore!”
while “Avast!” and “Avaunt’ ” might
also be brought into use. We offer this
linguistic hint to the various Aeronautic
Clubs and Leagues. It has classical autho-
rity in the gladiato:s' cry of “Ave, Caesar.”
-
Mr. MERRIMAN - LABOR, in his book,
Britons through Negro Spectacles, says
“The white man is really whiter than
he looks.” This is very true. Take
our colliers, for instance.

“The Vice-Chamberlain stepped to the front.”
(Mr. J. M. F. Fuller.)
smartly-dressed chap in tights, engaged,
inter alia, in keeping three balls in the
air at the same time? If you chanced
to be in House this afternoon—and there
was plenty of room—you would have
seen J. M. FULLER, Junior Lord of the
Treasury, Vice-Chamberlain H.M.'s
Household, doing analogous trick with
grace, ease and certainty that suggested
long practice.
Apparently been stampede of Cabinet
Ministers. Treasury Bench empty save
for presence of HoME SECRETARY, Chief
SECRETARY FoR IRELAND, UNDER SECRETARY
BoARD of TRADE, and the WICE-CHAMBER-
LAIN. Front Opposition Bench, not to
be outdone in game of abstention, repre-
sented solely by WALTER LONG and GEORGE
WYNDHAM, the latter allured by prospect
of fresh conversation on new Irish Land
Bill. Fair number of Questions on
Paper, some addressed to SECRETARY of
STATE FOR WAR, representative of BoARD
of AGRICULTURE, and CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER. The last at the moment at
Rheims—“He was wearing,” one of the
morning papers breathlessly announced
by telegraph, “a soft grey hat and a
light overcoat"—studying the science
of aviation. -
“With a Budget like mine, never
know where you may be, Toby, dear
boy,” LLOYD-GEORGE said, wringing my
paw on eve of departure. (He was, I
remember, dressed in rather large check
suit, with blue necktie, tweed cap, tan
leather boots, over which one caught a
gleam of purple sock, and an umbrella.)
“If things come to the worst with the
Dukes, it will be a great thing to have
an aeroplane in your back-yard, into
which you step and disappear over the
hills and far away.”
It was in respect of this triple flood of

Office, Agriculture, and the Treasury.

round each other in the ambient air

tion. FitzALAN HoPE had spent an hour
in his study evolving intricate question
designed to show that LLoyd-GEORGE
blundered hopelessly in calculation of
the yield, during current financial year,
of increase on spirit duties. Put it with
assurance that it would bowl over the
hapless deputy.
“The answer to all the questions is
in the affirmative,” said the WICE-CHAM-
BERLAIN, bowing to the interrogator
and showing instinctive tendency to
retire a few paces backward as upon
occasion he does at Court, an impulse
checked by unrelenting bench at back
of his legs.
Nothing could be neater.

adopted home at Florence as Signor
LABBI — taking an active part in
Parliamentary proceedings, estab.
lished a freehold in corner seat
below Gangway to left of SPEAKER,
a place ever connected with the bud- .
ding fame of GRANDOLPH. There was
no doubt about the legitimacy of his
holding. There, to be seen of all
men, was his honoured name set
forth on white ticket placed in back of
seat. But LABBY, though living in close
proximity to Westminster Abbey, was
never in his seat at Prayers. How did
he manage it?
SIDNEY GEDGE, happily then still with
us, a never-failing attendant on Divine
Service, had his suspicions. His ordi-
nary seat was above Gangway, in faith-
ful proximity to his pastors and masters
on the Treasury Bench. On a day he
quietly shifted his quarters to a bench
below Gangway immediately opposite
that from which MEMBER Fort North AMP-
TON used to make mischief. The seat
was at the moment tenantless. Bending
his head in reverent attitude whilst the
CHAPLAIN read prayers, through the open
fingers of hand held before his face,
Mr. GEDGE distinctly saw Charlºs DiLKE
drop a ticket into receptacle at back of
LAbby's seat.
Presently, Prayers over, LABBY, with
smiling countenance, strode in and took
his place beside his accomplice. Mr.

the question. House looked forward
with keen expectation to seeing JIMMY
standing at the Bar in a white sheet,
peradventure with a candle in his hand,
what time Lord IRoBERT enlarged on his
shortcomings.
Nothing came of the threat. Encour-
aged by impunity, JIMMY has been at it
again in even aggravated form. Debate
on an amendment having gone forward for
considerable time, Ch.AiRMAN proceeded
to put question. At same moment Lord
Robert rose with intent to continue
debate.
“Mr. CALDwell,” he called out in a
voice that travels far.
JIMMY, however, not looking up from
the paper, continued to recite the amend-
ment, put the question and declared the
Noes had it. House cleared for Division,
Lord Robert in due form put on his hat
and sternly reminded the ChairMAN that
he had risen to speak before the amend-
ment was put. - -
“I did not obsairve the noble lord,”
said Jim MY, glancing sideways at the top
corner seat above Gangway.
Lord Robert gasped. For anyone to
fail to observe him when drawn to his
full height of 6 feet 2, his voice up-
lifted in angered reiteration, seemed to
verge on the impossible. But you can't
flatly contradict the personal assertion
of a Member, much less a Deputy-Chair-
man. So Lord Robert sat silent, staring
at JIMMY as if he were some new incom-
prehensible product of Nature.

AN EXPLANATION.
[A doctor has recommended flirting as a
tonic for dyspeptic and bilious people.
When two young people commence a flirt-
ation, he argues, they become animated and
i gay. Their hearts beat quicker and the
blood circulates more freely. Thus the
sluggish action of the liver is quickened
by the increased blood supply.]
NAY, Phyllis' I've never intended
to wed:
A course I consider so stupid
Has not for a moment come into my
head,
I don't care a cuss about Cupid.
I call on you often, I talk with you
much,
I salute you with amorous greetings,
But now let me hasten to tell you that
such
Are purely medicinal meetings.
We prattle together, exchanging our
views, -
But vows do not enter the question;
Love-making is merely a physic I use
To quicken a doubtful digestion.
Your charming society freely dispels
A hump which were otherwise
chronic; -
In short, dear, platonic flirtation excels
All other descriptions of tonic.
Did anyone offer me you as a wife,
I fear I should laugh at the giver;
I think of you, not as the “star of my
life,”
But merely a stir to my liver. -
Yet do not imagine I'm treating you ill,
But rather rejoice at the notion
That I have esteemed you as good as a
pill
And ranked you as high as a potion.
“The annual regatta, which was held on the
10th inst., was, to a great extent, spoiled by
want of wind. In all the events the courses
had to be shortened. It is to be regretted that
the genuinely sporting efforts of this club have
met with so poor a response this year.”—The
Yachtsman. -
It really does look sometimes as though
the weather wasn't trying.

WHEN THE DUKES (AME BACK.
IN 1924 there was not a solitary
duke or millionaire left in the country.
Capital had gone. There was no money
save ChiozzA Moxey, and this foreign
currency was considerably depreciated.
The United States had absorbed every
duke. By a special constitutional amend-
ment dukes of foreign birth were allowed
to become President. The Duke of WEST-
MINSTER was just completing his second
term. The Duke of NortfoLK, whose ad-
mirable management of Tammany Hall
was the envy of all native-born politicians,
had just secured the Democratic nomina-
tion for Presidency. He had delivered an
ultimatum in a letter to a leading sena-
tor. An obscure politician named Roose-
VELT had striven for a special income-
tax on dukes, but had been defeated
by the Duke of Portland, who instantly
discharged his thirteenth butler, and
intimated that he was prepared to take
even stronger steps. -
In England the great leaders of the
Conservative Party, Mr. Joy NSON-Hicks
and Mr. Victor GRAYSON, had striven in
vain to overthrow the KEIR HARDIE
Government. The Government had the
steady support of all the Old Age Pen-
sioners, and as this included every one
over forty, opposition was futile. Even
a resolution of censure on Wiscount
BYLEs, the Viceroy of India, for giving
precedence at his levees to (coloured)
bomb-throwers, had been defeated by
624 votes to 10. But one day, as Par-
liament was discussing an important
Government measure for giving free
meals to all married or engaged couples,
an armed mob appeared in the Lobby.
The Press photographers, feuilletonis's,
and short story writers of England had
risen en masse.
Mr. Sil.As K. HockING and Count
WILLIAM LE QUEUx (of the Principality
of Monaco) placed their demands before
the trembling House:–
“Whereas we the petitioners have
derived our livelihood in the past solely
from dukes and millionaires; And where-
as some tens of thousands of British
subjects have in the past earned an
honest living by selling to the papers
such snap-shots as ‘The Duke of Norfolk
smiles,’ ‘The Duke of Bedford puts up
an umbrella,’ ‘The Duke of Leeds tells
a friend a good story.' And whereas
the industry of feuilleton-writing (which
hitherto employed on The Daily Mail
and its allied papers alone one thousand
tax-payers) has become extinct owing to
the public's lack of familiarity with
dukes and millionaires—the essential
raw materials of the feuilleton; And
whereas two million writers of short
stories are driven to seek their material
in the slum, the kail-yard, and Upper
Tooting; Therefore we the petitioners
demand that all protective taxes on their
raw material, dukes and millionaires, be
instantly removed. And in the event of
your honourable House failing to comply
with this demand then the members of
the House will be forcibly restrained
whilst the petitioners' representatives
read aloud typical feuilletons of their
own production.” -
There was a shriek of horror from the
frightened House. Mr. CRooks, the
Secretary for War, fainted. Then the
forms of the House were unanimously
suspended and the veteran Premier in-
troduced a Bill providing that dukes
and millionaires should be exempt from
all taxation and become Old Age Pen-
sioners from birth.
Two days later every illustrated paper
in England contained a snap-shot, “The
Duke of Norfolk paying his taxiplane
driver at Liverpool aerogage,” and The
Daily Mail announced a new feuilleton
by the author of Lepers in Purple, entitled
True Hearts in Tiaras. England was
herself again.

THE BENEFIT OF LITERATURE.
At North Walsham on Saturday
the 21st ult, two lads were charged
with stealing “a bottle of brandy, a
bottle of Chartreuse, a box of Sure
Shot cigars, a box of Tortoise-shell
cigarettes, seven boxes of . Colonel
Bogey cigarettes, a box containing 10
packets of Colonel Bogey cigarettes,
a bicycle wrench, 10 packets of 'o'
Player's cigarettes, six packets of
Woodbines, and nine cigars, value in
all £1 2s. 6d,” from a hotel at Bacton.
The prisoners, one of whom explained
that they had been reading “a book
called Raffles which appears to have
turned our beads,” were dealt with
under the Probation Act and were bound
over in their own recognisances of £50,
and their father's surety for a like
amount, to come up for judgment if
called upon within twelve months.
Several eminent novelists have written
to us to contrast the effect of the novel
in question with that on the ingenuous
minds of the readers of their own
beneficial fictions.
Mr. Halk Ayne, the author of The
(Wreat Black Loss, informs us that
two Egyptian Nationalists have been so
moved by the perusal of his romance
that, hearing of a recent regrettable
robbery at Pastor's Hotel at Cairo, in
which the thieves carried off a dozen
of champagne, six bottles of Benedic-
time, 2000 gold-tipped cigarettes, 100
Magnifico Pomposo cigars, valued at
£22, or exactly 20 times the amount of
the goods abstracted by the readers of
Raffles, they asked and obtained per-
mission to recompense the proprietor
for his loss. “I leave all unprejudiced
readers,” Mr. Halk Ayne modestly adds,
“to draw the obvious inference.”
Miss Carrie Morelli writes to state that
none of her readers have ever been
prompted by the study of her works to
any confusion between meum and tww.m.
OUR MERRY MUSICIANS.
No surer indication of the advance in
public musical taste could be afforded,
as The Daily Mail justly points out in a
recent issue, than the popularity achieved
at the Promenade Concerts by the Valse
Triste of the Finnish composer, SIBELIUS.
To quote from our contemporary : “It
is, indeed, sad and ghostly, written as a
part of the incidental music to a drama,
Death, by Arvid Järnefelt (brother-in-
law of Sibelius). A sick and sleeping
mother suddenly awakens to the sound
of soft music, which develops into a
waltz refrain. She waves her hands in
MoRE BUDGET DEBATEs.
“YUs, but You JEst put Younself IN THE Dook
WESTM INSTER’s PLACE.”
On the contrary they have led to the
diffusion of a spirit of such boundless
benevolence that, as recently published
wills testify, various charitable institu-
tions have directly benefited to the extent
of many thousands of pounds.
Meanwhile the Scotland Yard authori-
ties are seriously considering the im-
portance either of enrolling extra police
during the forthcoming run of Arsène
Lupin or arranging for some dramatic
antidote to that further attractive ex-
ploitation of the gentleman thieſ.
“Mr. C. E. M., Parish Church and Burgh
Organist, resumes his Professional duti s on
Wednesday, 1st September. -
“Mr. W. H., Organist and Choirmaster,
commences his Professional Duties on Tuesday,
1st September.”- Port Glasgow Erpress.
Thus there is no clashing.
time to the music, and strange vision-
ary couples appear and dance to the
weird valse rhythm. Then a knock
comes at the door; the mother utters
a despairing cry; the door flies open,
and Death stands on the threshold.”
Although the Valse Triste may not
enjoy the questionable distinction of
being whistled everywhere, The Daily
Mail confidently predicts that it will
become very popular with orchestral
societies, especially those having a
limited but efficient band.
It is pleasant to know that this
campaign against unseasonable levity
is being carried on by native as well
as foreign composers. Thus “The
Last Gasp" is the pleasing title of
a new symphonic poem which Mr.
Schubert Coffin has undertaken to
compose for the Kensal Green
Festival. The scenario of this exhil-
arating morceau is as follows. A
patient suffering from the sequela of
acute influenza is lying prostrate on
his couch when his room is invaded
by two burglars, who, after garotting
their victim, dance a Valse macabre
round the bed. This number cannot
fail to commend itself to orchestral
societies in the suburbs, especially
during an epidemic of housebreaking.
Again, Mr. Cyril Keltie, noted for
his cadaverous charm, has been com-
missioned by the Woking Choral Society
to compose a cantata illustrating the hor-
rors of premature burial. The orchestra
is muted throughout, and the ordinary
instruments will be supplemented by
a group of four oboes d'orrore, two
screech owls and a banshee, and the
conductor's desk at the first perform-
ance will be placed on the top of
a sarcophagus specially constructed for
the occasion. ºr * *
Finally we are rejoiced to hear that
Messrs. Bury and Tombs, the famous
musical entrepreneurs, have arranged a
series of Lethal Chamber Music Concerts.
The full programmes will be announced
in due course, but we understand that
they will include a charming cycle of
Death-bed Ditties and a set of Skeleton-
Army Quadrilles.

OLD JOKES FOR NEW.
As I climbed the stairs to the editor's
office I recalled my last night in London,
when I sat with pen and paper before
me, racking my brains for a subject on
which to write, and cursing the roar of
motor-buses that came in at the window.
(The roar came in.) I do not remember
the name of the country, or how I got ||
there ; but I was far from the land of
my birth, in a place where the prospect
of a fresh start filled me with hope.
I was assuring the editor that I could
do all the things the London editors had
mistakenly decided that I could not do,
when he interrupted me:
“What we want is something fresh,”
he said, “new treatment, novel points of
view, bright ideas, and "-with a wave
of the hand—“and so on.”
“Exactly, just my line,” I said.
“Take my “Wit and Humour’ page,
for instance. It's so difficult to get out
of the old ruts, away from the old
stories–---" -
“I know the curate's egg, and the
rest of 'em,” I said.

“I mean the story--the story of the
curate's egg, you know; parts of it

“No, never heard it. Is it a good
one?” he asked. So I told it to him.
He laughed loud and long, slapped his
leg, and summoned his assistant, to
whom he repeated it. I began to won-
der whether I was dreaming. However,
I was encouraged to try again, and I
recounted the incident of the man who
attempted suicide on the metals of a
slow line, and died of starvation before
a train came, following with the tale of
the nervous page-boy at the Bishop's
bed-room door. They were convulsed.
“Young man,” said the editor, wiping
away his tears, “I’ll pay five pounds for
a column of stories like those.”
“Done!” I said. “And could you
do with a couple of thousand on the
Mother-in-law'”
“No, Sir; humour's your line.

“But she is humorous,” I replied.
“Not in this country,” he declared
grimly. So I told him a mother-in-law
story. His face lit with the light of a
new discovery, and he ordered two
columns, adding that the boys would
enjoy reading it. It required great
restraint on my part to reserve the Scot
for a future suggestion.
I had reached a land where the old
jokes were unknown. Could a humorist
hope for anything better even in his
dreams? As I rushed back to my lodg-
ings I had visions of wealth and fame. I
wrote easily and rapidly, page after page;
then I sat back to read what I had written.

that I had meant to write on before I
fell asleep and emigrated.

The friend he turned him in his butt,

He dropped the dour and tragic mask,
And, “Aiblins ye’ll be richt!” he said,
And took the proffered flask.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
If novel-readers ever go out on strike and break windows,
one of their first demands, I think, will be, that couples who
played together during childhood must be happily united in
the last page: it is one of the natural rights of romantic
sentiment. The principle is rather flagrantly violated in
Diana Dethroned (LANE), by W. M. LETTS, for the two young
people who romped about at the beginning of the book have
only got as far as an engagement, when the arrival of an
unexpected wife, supposed to have been burnt in Paris, and
belonging to Robin Daymant's recently discarded past, upsets
their apple-cart. The lady dies, but not before Phoebe
Lankester has bestowed her hand on a rather uninteresting
cousin who takes morphia and comes from Australia. The
author's mythology is not a little puzzling, for Phoebe, or
“Diana,” although passionately de-
worthy of their present form. Surely there were devices by
which such a writer could have kept the interest of his longer
tale for the space required to sell it at six shillings; at
present the make-weight is a little obvious.
That Mr. Edward Noble knows
The ropes, and other things marine,
Lords of the Sea (from METhue.N) shows,
Like former books of his I've seen;
But what this one makes clear as day,
And what the earlier ones did not,
Is that he also knows the way
To frame a very powerful plot.
Mainly his purpose is to paint
The ugly side of life at sea—
Fierce competition, with the taint
Of P. P. I.'s and barratry.
He does it well, though not so much
voted to horse and hound, is to some
degree identified with Ceres, being
supposed to reach the full perfection
of her womanhood after having
been married for five or six years.
Historically, no doubt, certain local
Dianas could be identified with the
Syrian Astarte, if one wished to do
it, but where the title of a book
is concerned it is surely fairer to stick
to the instructions in the Gradus.
I am the more concerned to make
this criticism because the first part
of the story is, I think, much the
best (the writer is particularly happy
in her sketches of children and
animals, and when dealing with gar-
den and wood), and I rather lost
interest in Phoebe Lankester after her
marriage. Perhaps “Diana Mater-
familias” would have been a fairer
indication of what the reader had to
expect. --
Mr. HowARD PEASE, who has written
With the Warden of the Marches
By truth to things as they exist,
As by the very human touch
He gives to the protagonist.
. I propose a vote of sympathy with
the heroine of Fiona (MURRAY) because
her charm has been eclipsed by the
obtrusiveness of her creator. It is a
pity and more than a pity, for if Lady
NAPIER of MAGDALA would realise that
a novel is not a fitting place for the
airing of countless prejudices her
work would be really delightful. In
this book, however, she is out to tilt,
and one feels at last that a rescue-
party ought to be formed to save
Fiona from such a very wicked
pharisaical world. The desire to
pillory snobbishness is commendable
enough, but I cannot help thinking
that Mr. Venables (a member of the
great banking house of Venables,
Venables, Venables and Pickington)
is more of a caricature than a
character. I can believe a good
deal of Mr. Venables; I can believe
(CoNSTABLE), is at least master of the
art of chapter-heading. “Of the
Coming of the Stranger,” “Of the
Rescue of Elfrida,” and the like, is

in his mottled cheek, his creaking
boots, his huge soft hands and his
self-importance; but I cannot believe
how he distinguishes them, and to one who remembers
the glorious AINsworth thrill there is much virtue in that
“of.” Truth, however, compels me to add that the story
| itself falls a little short of the promise thus implied. It
only fills half the book, and without Mr. PEASE's picturesque
style, and his store of borderland knowledge to quicken it,
I suppose no heroine in
historical fiction ever yet swore a blood-feud against the
house of her father's foes without promptly thereafter
falling in love with its chief. Anyway that is what Elfrida
did, and when the gallant Rinyon, having rescued her
in the most approved style from the clutches of false
Clemmell, turned out to be one of her hereditary enemies,
she evinced a surprise which I confess I was unable to
share. Naturally there was nothing then for Elfrida
but to dress herself in doublet and hose, ride to warn
her lover of the feud, and fall gracefully into his arms.
All of which she did, so promptly indeed as to leave Mr. PEASE
with more than a hundred pages of his book to fill up. He
achieves this by the aid of some short stories, which give
me the impression of being early work, and not particularly
that, with so portentous an outward
curve to his waistcoat, he would spoil his social aspirations
by wearing his thumbs in the armholes of that garment.
Chapter IX. could be aptly named “A Straight Talk with
Smart Society,” and I hope devoutly that this mysterious
set will be more improved than amused by it. Lady NAPIER,
needless to say, is in deadly earnest and wholly on the side
of the angels, but in her wish to make the world a better
place she is in danger of treating her characters unfairly, and
—what is worse—of boring her readers.
“Hospital Sergeant Royal Marines, seeks. Situation to take charge
of doctor's surgery and accounts, or any place of truth.”—Northern
Daily Echo.
He is evidently tired of telling things to the Marines.
From the report of a cricket match in "he Glasgow Herald:—
“W. White, thrown out 93."
It is no part of the scorer's duty to comment on a bowler's
action.

Mr. Lloyd-GEORGE's Development Bill
provides the machinery for the con-
struction of motor roads with no speed
limits. Clearly another bid for votes,
addressed this time to the Medical and
Undertaking Professiºns.

The War Office is about to issue a
number of landscape targets to assist in
the training of recruits and young
soldiers. This opening of a new field
for painters is welcomed in Art circles,
and it is said that a certain Royal
Academician whose landscapes are often
a butt for the eritics has already brought
himself before the notice of the military
authorities. *.*
The KAISER has done much to en-
courage aviation, but when Count
ZEPPELIN reached Berlin he kissed him
on both cheeks.
*.*
A subscriber to The Daily Mail has
been complaining of the way in which
his favourite journal has been booming
the aeroplanes, which he believes will
prove a curse to mankind. We under-
stand it to be a fact that it was only after
long and careful consideration that our
contemporary decided to give its patron-
age to the new method of locomotion,
instead of letting it die of obscurity.
*.*
So few persons have a good word for
the rook that we are pleased to find a
well-known writer whitewashing that
much maligned bird. Mr. HAMILTON
FYFE, in recounting his impressions of
the aerial week at Rheims, remarks:—
“The Antoinette, coming up towards one
high against the horizon, suggests an
eagle sailing on vast white wings—or a
rook, perhaps, since eagles are not
white.” x +

A representative of The Mirror has
been interviewing the proprietor of a
registry-office on the subject of com-
plaints by servants. “Servants in
general,” we are told, “always consider
themselves much aggrieved in being
called by their first names, old as the
practice is, preferring the use of the
surname.” Our experience of menials
named Ermyntrude, Gwladys, and
Daphne is the other way round.
PLEASURE.
The new American Tariff imposes a
duty of 20 per cent. on violin rosin, and
KUBELIK and MARIE HALL, who had
already entered into contracts with
Yankee managers, are said to be faced
with ruin. :k :::
:::
Judge Woodward, of New York, holds
the opinion that, while American people
many years ago were probably over
boastful, the pendulum has now swung
the other way, and the average American
is too modest in asserting the glories of
his native land. But this was said before
the Stars and Stripes had been run up
at the North Pole.
*...*
The Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, on
her way across the Atlantic, cut clean
through a large whale lying asleep on
the top of the water. For some time
past, we believe, the problem of the
reckless sailing of the big liners-or
“sea-hogs,” as they are called – has
been receiving attention in whale circles,
but has not yet been satisfactorily solved.

TH E N EW CORD ON B L E U.
To DR. Cook, of The North Pole.
If you can swear upon your soul
That, having passed the icy seas,
You have unearthed the long-lost Pole
(And, though your tale sounds like a wheeze
Told to Marines by giddy middies,
I must not doubt its bona fides);-
If it is true that you achieved
The dash across those dismal floes
In isolation unrelieved
Except by stuffy Eskimos,
Let me, although a mere land-lubber,
Anoint your head with oil of blubber.
On you the general gaze is bent;
Our feelings even grow obtuse
About that other world-event,
The football-gladiators’ “truce; ”
A deed like yours seems, after all,
, More vital than a game of ball.
And most we marvel how you nursed
So long in secret such a sprint;
I should have thought it would have burst
Out through your pores in sudden print;
Is there a case of such restraint
In Yankee records? No, there ain’t.
I’ven The Mail was months behind
The date of your accomplished fact,
Nor should I be surprised to find
Its Polar Correspondent sacked,
Who missed you in the Arctic night
Through an amazing oversight.
Meanwhile it weighs you in the scale,
It puts you through the critic's sieve,
And finds The New York IIerald's tale
“AN UNCONVINCING NARRATIVE,”
In rival type it almost looked
As if the whole account was Cooked |
Yes, there are sceptic eyes to face,
Men who will cry, “You talk about
Your Eskimos who joined the chase ?
Well, let us see 'em ; trot 'em out !”
And others, “If you reached the goal,
Where's the result? Produce your Pole !”
Myself, I liked that first report,
Laconic as a rifle's crack,
Which showed (without details of sport)
You'd done the journey–Pole and back,
Fulfilling your tremendous mission
“While on a Polar expedition.”
In that last line there is the ring
Of Truth that proves your word is good;
Some might assert they found the thing
While skating in the neighbourhood;
But you located its position
“While on a Polar expedition.”
Well, there have been great Cooks before,
Voyagers famed beyond eclipse—
JAMEs who discovered many a shore,
And Thom As who invented trips,
Nor can there be, in my poor view,
“Too many Cooks” like them and you.

CROSS-EXAMINATIONS FOR THE HOME;
OR, LITTLE ARTHUR's Road To KNOWLEDGE.
(Little Arthur, aged 12; Papa, aged 48.)
Little Arthur. Papal -
Papa. Yes, my boy. -
L. A. May I ask you a question ?
Papa. Yes, yes. What is it?
L. A. Are you a very plain man, Papa?
Papa. Am I a-- Well, I'm dashed ' What on earth
do you mean? It's remarkably good of you to take such an
interest in my looks. I don't suppose I'm better or worse
than most other men as far as that goes.
L. A. Oh, Papa, I didn't mean your looks. I've never
thought about them. Besides, Mamma said we mustn't
judge people by their looks, . She said an ugly face often
concealed a heart of gold; and I’m sure we all kn --
Papa. I daresay, I daresay. You all know I've got a heart
of gold. Was that what you were going to say? -
L. A. Yes, Papa, something like that. But, of course, I
didn't mean that you’d got an ug— I shouldn't dream of
saying such a thing as that.
Papa. Well, we won't pursue that subject, if you don't
mind. -
L. A. No, Papa; but I wasn't thinking of that subject at
all when we started. - -
Papa. What were you thinking about, then 2 You asked
me if I was a very plain man.
L. A. Yes, Papa, I did. I heard you tell M. Lagrange
yesterday that you were only a plain Englishman; and I’ve
"heard you say the same thing to other people lots of times.
Papa. Oh, that's what you're after, is it?
L. A. Yes, Papa, that's what I'm after. And M. Lagrange
said, “Quant à moi, je me suis qu'un pauvre Français,
moi,” and you said it didn't matter and he wasn't to mind,
or something of that sort—so I thought I'd ask you what
you meant by being a plain Englishman.
Papa. Come, there's nothing so very difficult about that.
Anybody can see with half an eye what that means. It
means a man who's outspoken and downright, a man who
means what he says and says what he means, a man who—
who's an Englishman, in short.
L. A. Then are all Englishmen like that, Papa?
Papa. It’s a national characteristic.
L. A. Yes, Papa, but Mr. Mortimer is an Englishman,
isn't he, Papa?
Papa. Certainly he is -a very good old English family,
the Mortimers.
L. A. But Mamma said the other day she never quite knew
what Mr. Mortimer was up to -he never seemed to say what
he really meant; and you said she had hit him off to a T, and
that you couldn't stand a man who had always got something
ehind what he said and was always laying traps for you.
You said there were too many men like that.
Papa. Yes, that's true enough.
L. A. But then, if Mr. Mortimer's an Englishman, Papa,
and if he never says what he really means, he isn't a plain
Englishman, is he?
Papa. I never said he was.
L. A. No, Papa; but if there are too many like him—
Papa. Foreigners, my boy.
L. A. But, Papa, you don't know many foreigners. You
only know Mr. Blinkenstein and Mr. Schmitz and M. Lagrange,
and they’re only three, and I'm sure they say what they
mean, don't they
Papa. What's Miss MacBrayne doing? Why aren't you
having lessons with her ?
L. A. She's got a holiday, Tapa. She's celebrating the
battle of Bannockburn with some Scotch friends in London.

Papa. I don't want to hear what Miss MacBrayne says
about the Scotch. What were we talking about?
L. A. I was going to say, Papa, that, as you only know

Papa. You can go on wondering.

Frenchmen. He says France is at the head of civilisation.

L. A. Oll, I don't mind, Papa. I'm a plain Englishman.
Papa. Are you? Well, you can run off into the garden

The Daily Mail has been approaching certain great
explorers with the question, “What proof would you ask
from Dr. Cook that he had reached the Pole?” and the
following is Sir MARTIN CONWAY's decisive reply:-
“The statement of a reputable explorer, backed by a consistent story
and supported by such observations as circumstances made practicable,
would be accepted by the scientific world, if the story were found on
examination to ‘hang together,' as proof that the explorer had reached
the point he claims to have reached.”
After reading this definite pronouncement we have no longer
hesitation in saying that Dr. Cook has either been telling
the truth or else a lie.

becoming Fellows of the “Royal Chemisal Society.” Can

AN ENGLISH CRICKETER'S LOVE LETTERS.
THE following correspondence was
thrust in our letter-box last week with
the demand that it should be printed in
our next issue. We have not the least
doubt that it is unauthentic—or pre-
mature, at any rate; but at the same
time it certainly seems to convey the
atmosphere of the authorised letters. It
may be of course that our contributor
has only got hold of the rough drafts.
Dec. 24, 1908.
MY DEAR CRAwford, A merry Christ-
mas to you. I hope you are keeping fit
for next season; we must try to beat the
Australians. Can you possibly drop in
to tea to-morrow 2
Yours aſſectionately,
ALVERSTONE.
July, 1909.
MY DEAR CRAwford, – We are all
horrified at your conduct in refusing at
the last moment to play against the
Australians, when you had promised
LEVESON-Gowſ.It to do so. Unless you
can see your way to making a public
apology to the Committee, in the presence
of APTED and the other groundsmen, it
will be our painful duty never to let you
have the Saturday half-holiday again.
Yours very truly,
ALVERSTONE.
MY DEAR LORD ALVERSIONE,--All I said
was that I wouldn't accept the responsi-
bility of captaining a team which con-
sisted entirely of HARRISON, PLATT and
DUCAT. No reason was given to me why
the others weren't asked, and I think I
ought to at least have been consulted,
seeing that it was entirely owing to my
captaincy that we won the last match.
A lot of people look upon me as a sort
of professional, instead of being a very
young man with an experience and
knowledge of the game unrivalled even
by W. G. GRACE.
Yours sincerely,
John N. CRAwford.
My DEAR PROFUMo—I mean CRAwford,
—My instructions are to the effect that,
anyhow, you are quite old enough to
know why all the Surrey professionals
except three are in disgrace; if you didn't
know, you ought to have guessed. The
fact that they are playing to-day against
Middlesex has nothing to do with it. If
the wicket had been soft some of them
would have been left out. Will you
apologise 2 Yours faithfully,
ALVERSIONE.
MY DEAR LORD ALVERSTONE,--It is
awfully nice of you to write me such
jolly letters. The official captain, which
I won't sully my pen with his name, only
told me that I loºps wasn't good enough
for Surrey, and never said anything about
the others. Under the circumstances I
don't see why I should apologise to him
or anybody—except NoHLE.
Yours sincerely,
John N. CRAwford.
MY DEAR JACK, -Awfully sorry I
hadn't time to nod to you when I saw
you to-day, but the Committeº have
ordered me to cut you. I will write
you a nice long letter when I get home.
Yours ever,
H. D. G. LEVESON-Gower.
MY DEAR JACK, I am amazed, re-
volted and disgusted at your conduct.
To think that you should refer to me in
this way in your letters to Lord ALVER-
STONE, when you know how good I have
always been to you ! You bad boy! I
shall tell STRUDwick how wicked you
have been. Under the circumstances I
shall have to cancel your season ticket
to the White City—and KIRALFY quite
agrees with me in this. It is also
obviously impossible that we should
both go with the M.C.C. team to South
Africa, and so I have asked the South
Africans to choose which one of us they
would rather played against them in
Test Matches. They have unanimously
chosen me. Yours ever,
H. D. G. LEVESON-Gower.
DEAR CRAwford, At a meeting of
Surrey stockbrokers it was decided that
the following resolution be sent to you :-
“That in view of young CRAwford's
refusal to play against the Australians,
and the bad style and construction of
his letters to Lord ALVERSTONE, he be
asked never to play cricket again. And
a jolly good riddance.”
Yours sincerely,
W. FINDLAY.
DEAR FINDLAY,-Why I should be
practically branded as a criminal for
refusing to take the field eight short,
when you might at least have thanked
me for past services, I'm sure I don’t
know. Anyhow, I hope that others will
do the same.
Yours for the last time,
Join N. CRAw Fond.
The Manchester Evening News on the
Brighton walk :-
“Edwards has made great strides this sea-
son, and if his improvement has been main-
tained during the last few weeks the distance
between Payne and himself should be consi-
derably lessened.”
He certainly couldn't do botter than to
keep on with his great strides.

LOCOMOTIVE DRAMA.
WE are delighted to hear that the
example set by M. MAETERLINCK in his
recent production of Macbeth is to be
emulated in the operations of the new
Locomotive Theatre, Ltd., which will
shortly open with an extensive classical
and romantic repertory.
It will be remembered that at the
Abbey of St. Wandrille at Caudebec-en-
Caux the tragedy was “lived ” rather
than acted, the witches dancing in the
moonlight round real cauldrons, the
spectators who followed the actors from
point to point having to travel a mile or
two in pursuit of the dramatis personae.
The directors of the Locomotive
| Theatre, realising to what an extent
| exercise conduces to the well-being of
the spectators, have arranged that in
every one of their productions the various
scenes shall be represented in the actual
places indicated by the authors.
Arrangements have accordingly been
made for a production of Macbeth in
Scotland, where, with the aid of motor-
cars, dirigible balloons and other means
of rapid transport, the audience will be
able to cover several hundred miles
during the progress of the drama, tra-
velling - from Forres to Fife and the

English border with the utmost rapidity
and convenience.
The claims of realism will be rigorously
consulted in a variety of ways. Not only
will real cauldrons be provided; but real
brindled cats, hedgepigs and other ani-
mals will take part in the witches' orgies.
The cast will include the Earl of CAWDOR,
who has kindly placed his castle at the
disposal of the company, the ghost of
Banquo and other apparitions will be
supplied by the Society of Psychical
Research, and Sir JAMES CRICHTON-
BROWNE will officiate as the Scotch
Doctor.
Arrangements are also being made
for the production of Othello on similar
lines. As students of the immortal
bard are well aware, the First Act takes
place in Venice, while the scene for the
rest of the play is laid at a seaport in
Cyprus. Negotiations are accordingly
on foot with the Italian Government and
the Colonial Office with a view to ful-
filling the dramatist's intentions, but it
has not yet been decided whether the
transference shall be effected by the
North German Lloyd steamers or a fleet
of dirigible balloons. The cast is not
yet complete, but it is hoped to secure
EL Roghi to impersonate the Moor, the
Duke of the ABRUzzi the Duke of Venice,
and Miss ELKINS Desdemona.

The CIAssific ATION of Wii.I.I.A.M.
William, though not himself of an
adventurous nature, was ever ready to
oblige. When first his brother asked
him to come out to West Africa and
look for lions, William answered with
considerable accuracy that he did not
think that he had lost any. Later, in
order to avoid argument, he consented
to go, and together they set off to West
Africa, or, if there are no lions in West
Africa, then to East Africa.
Arrived there, they equipped them-
selves with rifles, food and a negro
servant apiece, and started forth in their
search for ungotten lions. Very soon,
however, William and his negro got
lost in the desert. Possibly there are
no deserts in East Africa, in which case
this all took place in any country you
like where there are lions, negroes and
deserts, but no signposts. Anyhow,
they wandered about for some weeks
together, managing to subsist by some
means best known to themselves. There
were discomforts and little awkward-
nesses in the situation, but they managed
to scrape along all right until the negro
took it into his head to run amok. His
idea of running amok was to dance
round William with a long, naked knife.
William, roused to argument at last,
disputed the propriety of this, and told
his negro servant to go away and be
quiet, but the latter merely replied
irrelevantly:—“If you had not been a
good master to me I would murder you.”
“Go away,” said William ; and, think-
ing the matter was at an end, “Don’t
make a fool of yourself.”
The negro ceased his dancing sud-
denly, and regarded William with a
fixed eye. “I am not so sure,” he said
slowly, making a humorous grimace,
* * that you have been a good master to

DEAR SIR,-Referring to The Classi-
fication of John (alias William), we
withhold comment until we have com-
municated with our client upon the
matter. Meanwhile we may say that it
reminds us of a little incident which
happened to ourselves only the other

full details.
Yours truly, THE Solicitons.

DEAR SIRs, This correspondence must

THE SUN AND THE SINGER.
The sky is absolutely bald, -
No cloudlets spoil its iridescence,
The heat wave has begun to melt
The butter, and is being felt
By persons having what is called
A presence.
This is the day when those who choose
To make the god of sport their fetish
Are found on golf-links and on
lawns,
With faces of the tint of prawns,
And growing ever, as they ooze,
More pettish.
But not the bard, whose tuneful shell
Is evermore Apollo's servant:
He shall not roam the fields and prod
Alluvial strata from the sod
Until his hide becomes too—well,
Too fervent.
He shall not wave (to suit your whim)
The ineffectual tennis racket,
Nor leave to some indignant fair,
Who muffs it with a mute despair,
The lob that came too high for him
To whack it.
Here on the lawn I mean to sit
While you indulge your gambols
yonder;
Roofed by a tent of waving boughs,
My handkerchief across my brows,
And murmur to the Muse a bit,
And ponder.
Thus I believe those pastoral men,
Watching their tender goatlets eat
thyme,
The bards of old were wont to lie
And weave their songs, and so
will I,
If one of you will wake me when
It's tea-time.

THE IDLER.
I AM a keen motorist. I have got no
nerves; they were all destroyed years
ago. I am very fond of driving; indeed,
I spend the best part of my day driving
the largest car that is at present made.
You may be very proud of your own
car, but it is not nearly so large as
mine. When I say that I can take six-
teen people inside and eighteen on the
top, you will see that this is no vain
boast.
I have come to look upon myself as a
fairly busy man. True, I do not start
work much before eight and rarely con-
tinue after midnight, but while I am at
it I have one or two little matters of
some importance to attend to constantly.
At a rough computation I should say that
I have seven hands. I have never actu-
ally seen more than two of these, but I
know that I can managemy steering-wheel,
my gears, my lubrication, my hand-brake
and my throttle all at the same time,
and yet have one hand to spare to wave
at intending passengers and another for
my cigarette. But then, of course, the
steering is not really difficult. All I
have to do is to realise at the very first
that it is impossible to get my little lot
through, and to hope for the best. Now
and then there does seem to be a spare
foot or two of unoccupied space in the
road, but that is generally filled by half-
a-dozen taxicabs before I get there.
Bless you, I am quite used to these
taxicabs, for there are always three
pressing me on my right, three on my
left, two nipping across in front of me,
and six running into me behind. Very
likely lots of them go underneath me,
and I should not be surprised to learn
that one or two jump over me.
I get plenty of time for quiet medita-
tion, because the passengers always take
great care to give me enough oppor-
tunities for stopping. They feel that
the hills tire me, so they generally
arrange to get on and off when I am
halfway up. I appreciate the kindness
with which they determine among them-
selves that no two of them get off at the
same time. If this seems likely to occur,
one of them stays behind, waits till I
have got four or five yards further, and
then makes me stop again. These little
occasions I use for philosophic contem-
plation. The chief object that I con-
template philosophically is a ruined
engine, the position from which I do so
being usually on my back in the road.
But there is always the motor-bus above
me to keep the sun off. Of course I
lose money on these delays, but one
cannot have one's holidays for nothing.
So much for myself. If you would
only condescend, I should be delighted
to see you any time you cared to come
for a little jaunt on my motor. Choose
a really wet day, stop me as suddenly as
you can, and then watch me skidding.
If we are lucky in our day, I and my
'bus will be carried into a private car-
riage driving on the wrong side of the
road. The coachman will abuse me and
the occupant of the carriage will abuse
me. Then we shall all gather round
and have a chat with a policeman, who
also will abuse me. You, of course,
will abuse me too, and (if you don't
mind my giving you a little hint about
the etiquette of these occasions) you
will be doing the proper thing if you
tell the policeman, and see that he takes
it down in his notebook, that it was
entirely my fault.

ES S E N C E OF PA R L I AM E N T.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
“BANBURY PROBED THE DEPTHs of RARE historical Lord to find PARALLEL to PRESIDENT of The Local GoverNMENT BoARd.”
(Rt.
House of Commons, Monday, August 30.
—A might of discursive conversation,
punctuated by the Closure. Housing
and Town Planning Bill comes up for
Committee. Runs to seventy-three
clauses and six schedules. House
allotted two days for Committee stage.
Seems on face of it inadequate. Fact is
last year Grand Committee, microcosm
of House, sat for weeks shaping the ends
of measure rough-hewn by Local Govern-
ment Board. What's the use of a
Grand Committee if, after this, House is
to go all through the work again 2
Opposition small but expansive. In
Division Lobby mustered thirty-six.
Clogged paper with amendments. Met
Bill on threshold of Committee with no
fewer than ten Instructions. Had a single
one been in order, the whole sitting
might have been appropriated for dis-
cussing it. SPEAKER, Closure incarnate,
made short work of the group. It was
the old story of the Ten Little Niggers.
Nine ruled out on point of Order “and
then there was one.” This also the
ruthless SPEAKER smothered ; “and,” he
added, “all the Instructions being out of
order, I will now leave the Chair.”
Which he forthwith did, spending a
pleasant evening in his library with
PLATO, whilst Committee wrestled with
Hon. John Burns, as seen by Sir Frederick Banbury.)
FREDERICK BANDURY, who, in absence of
PRINCE ARTHUR, undertook to lead Oppo-
sition.
He probed the depths of rare historical
lore to find parallel to PRESIDENT OF LOCAL
GoverNMENT BoARD. Came to conclu-
sion that he was “a kind of Julius
CESAR.” JoHN BURNs, blushing modestly,
disclaimed honour thrust upon him.
WALTER GUINNESs made excellent start.
Seconding amendment for omission of
Clause 1, which compulsorily endows
Local Authorities with power to deal with
unhealthy areas, he remarked:
“If this clause be adopted, Local
Authorities will put up houses without
assurance that they can make both ends
meet.”
John BRIGHT once talked about impos-
sibility of turning his back on himself.
An easy achievement compared with
problem here suggested. As MEMBER
for SARK points out, it is only during
earthquakes that both ends of a house
ever meet.
Hardest case of all DICKSON-Poy NDER's.
On Clause 30 conversation drifted into
comparison between sanitary arrange-
ments of continental cities and London.
At end of hour's talk D.-P. interposed.
“I think, Mr. EMMOTT,” he said, ad-
dressing the Chair, “it is time to come
g 2
back to England from Paris and
Berlin.”
The moment he had landed, so to speak,
on his native shore, prepared to enjoy its
many privileges—to speak by the card
having worked off the first sentence of
what promised to be lengthy and inter-
esting speech, Chairman rose and put
the question. D.-P. abruptly subsided.
BANBURY, making further study of the
PRESIDENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BoARD,
desires to supplement his previous
similitude. John BURNS is not only
“a kind of JULIUS CESAR’’; in his
(BANBURY's) opinion, he further resembles
a Star Chamber President or (alterna-
tively) an anonymous personage attached
to the Court of Louis XVI.
More blushes from J. B. Has long
been accustomed to being called names.
Acknowledges that no effort in that
direction equals fertility of resources of
Member for the City.
Business done. — Between 3.30 and
11.30 fifty-two clauses of Housing and
Town Planning Bill passed through
Committee.

livered his charge to the watch patrolling
the streets of Messina has there been

“He would like to know whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the
Board of Trade had reached those unapproachable heights of public morality in which they
could use language which, though it seemed absurd and almost hypocritical in the case of
ordinary men, became natural and excusable in the mouths of these political saints.”
of Commons and the peccant Duke of
Norfolk. Some weeks have elapsed
since His Grace wrote encouraging mis-
sive to “My dear Profumo,” Unionist
candidate for the High Peak. In it
Swift MACNEILL's quick eye detected
breach of Privilege. Is there not
solemnly passed at the opening of every
Session an order forbidding Peers to
interfere in Parliamentary Elections?
Long experience has shown that in-
evitable result of ſlaunting Breach of
Privilege flag is to place Commons in
ridiculous position. As sometimes hap-
pens, action of august assembly was in
this case directed at level of wisdom
of least discreet Member. Committee
of Privileges appointed, with PRIME
MINISTER in Chair, to consider the alleged
naughtiness of Norfolk. Decided to
invite His Grace to make any observations
that might occur to him. Hinted at
desirability of his attendance in person.
Duke wrote polite note to say he couldn't
conceive what information the Committee
required beyond what was common pro-
perty. As to walking into their parlour,
he presumed application would have to
be made to the House of Lords.
This afternoon enquiry addressed to
Treasury Bench elicits reply that
PREMIER is not yet in position to present
report on case.
Here the matter stands, and here
comes the quotation from Dogberry's
discourse, with a single verbal variation
suited to the political times:–
Dogberry.—This is your charge. You
are to bid any man stand in the Prince's
naine. -
2 Watch.-How if a will not stand 2
Dogberry.—Why, then, take no note
of him but let him go, and presently
call the rest of the Watch together and
thank God you are rid of a Duke.
Business done. — Another night in
Committee on Town Planning Bill.
With the regularity proverbially attri-
buted to clockwork, blade of guillotine
fell at seven and again at 10.30. At
latter hour 156 amendments chopped
off. Soon after midnight Bill through
Committee. -
Thursday.—It would not be true to
speak of Captain CRAIG's martial spirit
as being subdued. It is certainly
.d.; by recent extraordinary pro-
cedure of Post Office. House has
already by frequent questioning been
made familiar with fact that accom-
modation for His Majesty's Post Office
in Collinstown is located in a pigsty.
Later information has reached the
Captain which seriously aggravates the
situation. Submitted it to House to-day
in form of further question addressed to
PoSTMASTER-GENERAL.
“Can the right hon. gentleman state,”
the gallant Captain asked, fixing the
hapless Minister with glowing eye, “if
the pigsty has a chimney?"
As everyone knows, this convenience
is common to pigsties in Ireland. In
the West there frequently are in addition,
SARK tells me, a fireplace, fire-irons, and,
in some cases, settles within the spacious
chimney upon which “the gintleman
who pays the rint” may on winter even-
ings repose and mentally review the
events of the day. If Captain CRAIG has
been well informed—and on these matters
he has established an enviable character
for accuracy—the pigsty at Collinstown,
wherein His Majesty's mails are received
and distributed, has not even a chimney.
Painful to see PostMASTER-GENERAL
shuffling with the question. At the
end of conversation, animated on the
gallant Captain's part, House was left in
doubt as to whether the pigsty has or
has not a chimney. Captain CRAIG may
be relied upon to remove uncertainty.
In his hands it has become the Irish
Question. SYDNEY BuxtoN may just as
well, sooner rather than later, make up
his mind frankly to answer it.
Business done. —Lochaber—I mean
the Budget Bill, once more.
“It was generally recognised in aviation
circles last week that either the claims of
Wembley Park must be sacrificed to Blackpool
or that Wembley Park must give way to
Blackpool.”—Daily Dispatch.
It is a knotty question which will, we
hope, be decided without blood.

I.—The STOPPED Clock.
ONCE upon a time there was a dis-
credited politician whose nostrums no
longer took anyone in. And being
thrown out of office he wandered about,
seeking, like many men before him,
for comfort and consolation among
his inferiors. These, however, failing
him, he passed on to the lower animals,
and from them to the inanimate, until
he came one day to a clock which, the
works having been removed, consisted
only of a case, a face, and two hands.
“Ha,” said the politician, as he stood
before it, “at last I have found some-
thing beyond question and argument
more useless than myself. For you, my
friend, are done. I, at any rate, still
have life and movement. I can speak
and act; I have a function still to
perſorm in the world ; whereas you are
a mockery and a sham.”

“Kindly,” the clock replied, “refrain
from associating me with yourself. I

be, but not useless. For two separate
moments every day I am absolutely
right, and for some minutes approxi-
mately right; whereas you, Sir, are,

wrong.”
II.--THE SAGE.
A City was once besieged by a large
and powerful army, and the inhabitants
were reduced to severe straits and starva-
tion. At length they were saved by an
aged man who discovered a secret method
of converting wood and stone into food
by soaking it in a fluid of his own inven-
tion. So they ate up their houses and
left only the walls of the city, and in
course of time they were relieved by rein-
forcements. Then the chief men of the
city seized the aged man and charged
him with the destruction of their houses
and public buildings, and demanded of
him that he should tell them what they
should do to restore their prosperity.
“Continue,” said he, “the use of the
magical fluid, and devour now also the
walls of your city. Then you need have
no fear of conquering armies, because
there will be no city for them to attack.”
The very Farthest North.
“Dr. Cook's telegram to M. Lecointe states
definitely that he reached the North Pole on the
date mentioned above, and that he discovered
land to the northward.”—Daily Telegraph.

AT T H E PLAY.
“MiD-CHANNEL.”
I AM not sure that Sir ARTHUR WING
PINERO is quite innocent of false pretences
in the matter of the title of his new play.
Mid-Channel might have meant so much.
It might have meant collisions in a
fog, collapsing swimmers, submerged
Lathams, or at least a touch of mal-de-
mer, but it meant none of these things;
any more than the PoET LAUREATE meant
them when he composed his batch of
sonnets on the same marine neighbour-
hood. What the author meant was
CoMFORT IN Mid-Ch MNNEL.
Theodore Blundell . . Mr. LYN HARDING.
that halfway between Folkestone and
Boulogne there is a shoal where even in
weather of the most halcyon the waters
are ruffled. It is an allegory. It illus-
trates a certain type of marriage. Sir
WING has noticed that after a couple
have been married about fourteen years
or so, and all has hitherto been smooth
sailing, there comes a period when the
waters of conjugal union are troubled
and the two feel a bit sick of one another.
Get over this period, by sitting tight
or holding on patiently to the nearest
fixed object, and you will soon be in
quiet water again, with a clear run
before you on a calm course of progres-
sive jubilees. On the other hand, jump
overboard and you will regret it, for at
the best you may lose your hat and are
sure to get your other clothes wet, and
at the worst you will be drowned, for
the shoal is not so shallow that you can
stand on the floor of it with any comfort.
All this takes a lot of explanation in
a play, and the only flaw in the smooth-
ness of the author's construction was
when he stopped Peter Mottram in the
middle of an exit and dragged him back
by the hair for the express purpose of
throwing off a solution of the titular
allegory. Mr. LowNE, who played the con-
genial part of Peter (a friend of both
parties) with a very perfect felicity, had
in his répertoire a large assortment of
excellent advice, part earnest, part
banter, including several hallowed
platitudes,
author was the first to remark; but
when he had to work off this homily on
the title for general future reference I
nearly mistook him for a prig and a
bore.
Before leaving the Mid-Channel theory,
which doesn't quite hold water when
you look at it closely, let me say that
the lady ultimately throws herself over-
board. I am glad that Sir WING had
the courage to make her do this, for an
early scene made it clear, and the lurid
course of subsequent events made it
clearer still, that even if she and her
husband had weathered the shoal there
would have been some dreadfully choppy
water waiting for them between there
and Boulogne.
The play must rank with the author's
best. Its dialogue did not err on the
side of terseness, but it was so brilliantly
rendered, and nearly always so matural
in its fluency, that our attention never
faltered. Less interest was to be got
out of the fate of the three leading
characters (two, if not more of them,
seemed tainted with a rather superfluous
vulgarity), but the sneaking tenderness
which husband and wife retained for
one another in the course of their sepa-
ration and mutual infidelities made us
hope forlornly, against our better judg-
ment, that they might patch up their
quarrel. Still, I am afraid I was not as
much “purified by pity" as I should
like to have been, for the estranged
pair were hardly worth it, and I could
not get myself to worry properly about
the girl whose lover was nearly sacrificed
to the married woman. Somehow she
failed to contribute her right share to
the irony of things.
Miss IRENEWANBREGh was almost better
than herself, especially in the quick play
of light and shade in the earlier scenes,
when there was more chance for the
contrast of emotions.
Mr. LYN HARDING, as the husband, was
not supposed to be too refined for the
Stock Exchange, but there was no need
for him to look so much like a profes-
sional bruiser. Now and then he was
perhaps a little lacking in finesse, and
hovered on the verge of melodrama; but
it was a good performance in a vein not
quite his own. -
Mr. MATURIN, as the lover, a part which
was just a little beyond him, was too
angular, but he also did some good
things. Miss NINA SEVENING was the
erring Mrs. Ammerly, and had one very
on whose antiquity the
nice speech :-"I'm sure I don't want
to get into the Divorce Court again.
hate the hole.” But she is not built
for an adventuress.
As for Lena, the lady's-maid, I must
suppose that she said and did what Sir
ARTHUR meant her to, but most of it
looked and sounded very improbable.
I speak without peculiar knowledge,
having never made more than one care-
ful study of this type; but I suspect that
my inexperience is shared by the author.
To whom, and to his interpreters, and
to Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, who schooled
them, my best compliments on a fine
piece of work. - O. S.
“ARskNE LUPIN.”
Arsène Lupin was a very bad boy. In
the Fourth Act we are told that he
began his career of crime at quite an
early age by stealing sugar and jam.
It must have becm quite an early age, for

the vulgar say) popped the stones. Yet
do not judge him harshly. Remember
that he had the artist's love for the
beautiful, the politician's desire that
wealth should be properly distributed.
Arsène, masquerading as the Duc de

body else's jewels, and rightly chose
the latter. That was a long time ago;
but even as recently as the First Act she
took Germaine's pearls. The reasons she
gave the Duc in the next Act for her
conduct were unconvincing; still more
unconvincing her assurance that she had
stolen nothing since she loved him; at
best she would only have had time to
pinch his watch. Yet there can be no
doubt that both he and she were good
at heart, and that thieving is a fine
profession.
Having swept away the moral diffi-
culty we may now settle down to enjoy
the play. The first two Acts are merely
to prepare you for the last two, when the
great duel of wits, revolvers, handcuffs,
| and bombs takes place between Arsène
Lupin, the world-famous gentleman
thief, and Guerchard, the world-famous
detective. In the First Act, for instance,
some quite ordinary thieves come on
with the object of deceiving you as to
the identity of the real burglar. It had
that effect on the small boy behind me,
for I overheard him betting that it was
Anastase. It didn't deceive me; I
knew it was GERALD DU MAURIER. Mr.
DU MAURIER was playing the part of the
Duc de Charmerace?—then the Duc was
Arsène Lupin.
But the Third and Fourth Acts are
properly thrilling. Revolvers are pulled
out, handcuffs are burst open (I didn't
know that this was done much. Neither,
by the way, did Guerchard—I never saw a
man so surprised), bombs are threatened,
and secret passages disclosed. Through
it all go Mr. DU MAURIER and Mr. DENNIs
EADIE as cool as you please; and when in
the end Arsène escapes in Guerchard's
own motor with Sonia (Miss ALEXANDRA
CARLISLE) at his side the cheering is
terrific. “By Raffles, a proper pair of
villains.”
Only it is a mistake to try to white-
wash your villains. M.

GREAT INTERNATIONAL POLITE-
NESS TOURNAMENT.
WE are glad to be able to announce
that, as a result of the recent corre-
spondence on the subject in The Daily
Error and other leading journals,
arrangements are now on foot for a
grand International Politeness Congress
and Tournament, which will be held
in London some time during the next
Sull lunet.
From a rough prospectus which has
been kindly forwarded to us by the
promoters, we gather that a series
of searching tests will be instituted,
amongst which we may specially notice
the “Post Office Ordeal” and a contest
in courtesy between booking-office clerks.
Another very interesting and oppor-
tune competition will be restricted to
Radical and Socialist Politicians. A real
live Duke, of the most atrocious character,
will be placed on a platform wearing the
insignia of his order, and the competitors
will be called upon to vie with each
other in a contest of delicate eulogy.
Mr. LLOYD - GEORGE and Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL have kindly consented to act
as adjudicators.
The Corn-stampers' Test will also
impose a severe strain on the equanimity
of the contestants, who will only be
allowed to wear sand-shoes, while the
stamping will be done by specially se-
lected operators weighing not less than
17 stone and equipped with hobnailed
boots of several horse-power.
Prizes will also be given to the most
tactful Tax-collector, the perfect police-
man, the most benevolent 'bus-conductor,
and medals for gentleness to jostlers and
courtesy to cats.

“Cries for a speech from some of the

ledgements.”—Susser Daily News.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is some time since Mr. BASIL LUBBock published Round
the Horn before the Mast, a book which was welcomed imme-
diately as the work of one of those rare authors, such as
Mr. Joseph CoNRAD and Mr. FRANK T. BULLEN, who mix their
colours with real sea-water, as distinct from those who merely
drop a pinch of salt into the paint-pot. With Deep Sea
Warriors (METHUEN) Mr. LUBBock justifies his earlier º:
It is the log of an English officer who for a wager ships as a
seaman and spends his furlough on a voyage from India to
the Cape. He poses as a novice, with just that amount of
nautical experience which belongs to the enthusiastic amateur
yachtsman, but every page proclaims the man to whom the
call of the sea is irresistible. Mr. LUBROCK, of course, writes
from personal experience of the life which he has himself
gone out of his way to adopt. Much of the interest of the
narrative lies in the author's portrayal of sea life in its effects
on a number of widely different types of character. He

it is impossible to be captious. Monsieur de Saintonge, the
penniless nephew of a rich, parsimonious uncle, fared ill at
the Court of Louis XV. Too poor to dress himself be-
comingly, he was the butt of Versailles, where “the one
unforgivable sin was to be ridiculous.” Despatched, how-
ever, to Russia on what I will—by stretching the truth to its
limits—dignify with the name of a diplomatic mission, and
dressed no longer in tatters, he filled a position which,
although extremely precarious, was infinitely preferable to
his former post. Ordinary stuff, no doubt, but it is very
well served. The minds of men are exercised as well as
their muscles, and the movement of the story is not accom-
panied everlastingly by the music of clashing weapons.
Indeed, Mr. DRUMMOND has so mice a sense of style and his
reflections upon life are so sane, that I think he is wasting
his time in dealing with Court intrigues.
Excuse me, Mr. RICHARD MARSH, but may I just have a

The Daily Chronicle has conceived the idea, brilliant in
its novelty, of publishing a parody on FitzGERALD's version of
OMAR. It is entitled “The Budgal'at of I'm a-Khrying.”
This remarkable word-play (for the striking similarity between
the sounds of Omar Khayyam and I’m a-Khrying can escape
no sensitive ear) still leaves us unchanged in our opinion that
The Daily Chronicle's humour is at its best when unintentional.
From Aberdour Notes in the Fife Free Press:–
“Excellent weather conditions favoured the 52nd annual regatta
held at Aberdour on Saturday, and there was a large exodus of visitors.”
The regatta doesn't seem to have been very popular; unless,

THE BATTLE OF THE POLE.
To DR. Cook oxCE MoRE.
LAst week the world was at your beck ;
We saw you fêted, mobbed and fed ;
'Twas roses, roses round your neck,
And Copenhagen off its head,
And Princes putting bumpers down
To mark their sense of your renown.
To-day the bakéd meats are off,
The streams of medals cease to flow,
And maffickers remain to scoff,
Saying, “We always told you so; ”
And just because Commander PEARY
Adds to your claims an awkward query.
He too, it seems, surveyed the place,
And, though he made a careful search
For tubes and footprints, found no trace
Of you about the Pole (or perch);
Indeed he hints our Arctic flier
Is little better than a liar.
'Twas he who fared through glacial fogs
And nailed “Old Glory” to the Pole;
You merely went and pinched his dogs
And took a trifling northward stroll;
(I fear ETUKisiiook and Co.
Have been and given away the show).
So far from having reached the spot
Where he put in a recent call,
IIe says you never even got
Anywhere near the scene at all;
That's his account; it only shows
How leaky are the Eskimos.
He wires to Mrs. P. to say,
“I have him nailed” (another clow !)
Omitting in his kindly way
To mention what he'd nailed you to;
It cost his generous heart a pang
To use this piece of Polar slang.
For me, I leave, with great content,
The task of telling black from white
To partisan arbitrament—
The Cookster and the Pearyite:
Let them decide—it's their dispute—
Which gets the bulge and which the boot.
At worst it means a civil feud—
This lot alleging you have lied, .
While that, becoming almost rude,
Heaves carrion at the other side,
And calls your rival record-breaker
A fetid tough, a champion ſaker.
Meanwhile at home we well may thank
Our stars that it did not occur
To one of you to be a Yank,
And one by birth a Britisher;
U. S. would now be arming for
A long and bloody Polar War. O. S.
“Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, Suffragist, was struck off Division 3, at
Chelsea, which contains the Local Government list, on the ground that
she had removed from Cheyne-walk.”—Daily Paper.
“Sylvia, this day I will disfranchise thee,” as SHAKSPEARE
very nearly said in Two Gentlemen of Verona, Act III., Scene 1.
THE IDEAL DENTIST.
["The idea behind the construction of the ideal dentist's surgery
shown at the International Exhibition of the Society of Extractors and
Adapters of Teeth, now being held at the Horticultural Hall,
Westminster, is to charm the senses of a patient, and to keep out ||
of sight anything that would suggest a dentist's operating-room.
Tasteful pictures hang upon the art-papered walls; footsteps are
deadened by a thick pile carpet; finely inlaid furniture fills the room,
with a luxurious easy-chair in the centre. Every instrument is hidden.
The paraphermalia of the profession repose in a mirrored cabinet, which
opens noiselessly. . . . The usual drilling machine is absent. In its
place is a suspended silvered globe, from which hangs a flexible tube,
which is worked by an electric motor secreted in the wall, with even
the switch hidden. No customary dentist's basin is there, but a bowl
like a pedestal rose-bowl. Even the anaesthetic bag appears disguised
as a large silk handkerchief.”—Daily Mail.]
Which is all quite charming, so far as the ideal operating-
room is concerned. But if the Ideal Dentist is to live up to
his surroundings he will surely require some appropriate
small talk for professional purposes.
Mr. Punch begs to submit some specimen sentences which
he trusts will be found suitable to any ordinary requirements.
He makes no charge for them.

THE UNEARNED INCREMENT.
PEOPLE pass me in the street without
a second glance; sometimes even — I
can't say why—with a slightly amused
smile. And yet, did they but know it,
I am no common man. I have done
what no one ever did before—what, in
all human probability, no one will ever
do again.
It happened this summer, when I
was staying in the country with the
Plimpleys. (Quite a respectable family.
At least, they have gryphons on their gate-
posts.) When I had been there three
days, and had beaten them all at golf-
croquet, I asked if there was such a
thing as a Bradshaw in the House.
“Oh, but,” they said, “you must stop
for our Church Bazaar to-morrow. Such
fun.” It seemed that the parishioners of
Market Shortwayte had recklessly built
a Gothic cottage for their sexton, and
now owed £429 13s. 1d. for it. So I
stayed.
When we got into the marquee the
Plimpleys, to a woman, deserted me, and
I stood stranded in a circling throng till
a girl came up to me with something
large and smooth and round, worked
all over with white cauliflowers.
“You will buy it, won't you?” she
said.
“What is it?” I asked.
“Only ten shillings.”
“Yes, but what is it?” I persisted.
“Why, a cushion, of course,” said she.
“Sorry,” said I, “but my size is
mines.” So I lost her, and went and
stood by a lucky-tub, where a female
bevy was fishing, with loud shrieks, for
parcels, at a shilling a bite: sheer
gambling-horrid! I turned to a grim,
military-looking person who was watch-
ing with apparent disapproval, and
said, “Tut, tut, this sort of thing”—I
had met him the day before at the
Squire's but hadn't a notion who he
was -“this sort of thing makes one
almost sigh for Dis-establishment—
what ?”
It was a bad effort, because he hap-
pened to be the patron of the living,
and vicar's warden, and all that. So I
lost him ; and then a girl came up to me
with a sort of camp-bed--same girl and
same cushion, in fact.
“Won't you change your mind?” she
said.
“I have changed it,” said I : “I
thought they were cauliflowers, and now
I believe they are pine-apples.”
“Oh you're horrid,” she said. So
we parted again, and I driſted up to the
end where the band (brass) was playing
a selection of ecclesiastical music. At
least, “The Gadabout Girl.” But, the
breeze from a bombardon setting in too
stiflly for me, even with my collar up,
I won through to the Art Gallery. You
know the sort of thing—a framed receipt
for overweight luggage labelled “The
Last Charge at Waterloo,” and so on.
“Tut, tut,” I said to the curate-show-
man, “if the Church encourages you to
do this, my boy, I shall have to think
about voting for Dis-estab–’ And
then I found the patron of the living be-
side me, eyeing me suspiciously askance.
Real Pan-Anglicans rather terrify me-
I always suspect them of a hankering
after thumbscrews; so I went out again;
and she came round for the third time.
“It’s getting shop-soiled,” I said.
“Better have your Summer Sale, and let
it go at half-price.”
“Oh you are horrid,” she said; but
she smiled (such a kind face), and I
wandered away upon a disconsolate
search for Plimpleys.
Next time she came round it was
green; it had been red before.
“This is the other side of it,” she
explained.
“Heavens! ... Well, at any rate I know
the worst now,” said I. And then the
arrival of a plethoric gentleman in gaiters
and a black apron threw the tent into a
state of seething excitement, and we had
to look to ourselves. By the time I had
straightened my collar and tie and
recovered my hat she stood before me
Once more.
“Look here,” I said, “you're the ninth
girl with a cushion—Oh! it's you! No,
not to-day, thank you.” But the next
time we met, as I couldn't think of any-
thing more to say, I bought it for ten
shillings. “And will you kindly put it in
paper for me 2'' I said.
“Hold it while I go and look for
a Telegraph,” she commanded, and
straightway deserted me.
Shortly afterwards, catching sight of
a Plimpley at last, I made towards her
eagerly, to ask if I might go home and
have a quiet cry. Without a sign of
recognition she turned from me and
deliberately got lost again ' I tried to
approach others; I thirsted for human
companionship; but I had become an
outcast. People thought I wanted to
sell It. Cowards! Oh! the cowards!
When I was at my very lowest a voice
sounded mockingly in my ear: “Aren't
you glad you came * *
I scowled fiercely, and she passed on
with a pink-and-purple tea-cosy.
The slow minutes wore on, and there
seemed nothing in all the world to do
but cast my cushion down on Some
unoccupied spot and sit on it. I was
debating whether to do this, or to jam it
suddenly into the trumpet of the gramo-
phone that had opened fire on my left,
raise the wild war-cry of my clan, and
make a dash for freedom, when a lady
in front of me put up her lorg.nette and
studied my cushion with a cold and
passionless gaze.
“Mildred,” she said to her daughter,
who was old enough, as even Miss SUTTON
would admit; but no matter—“Mildred,
ask that young man the price of his
cushion.”
At that—perhaps it was something in
the tone of her voice—an inexplicable
longing to show my independence
assailed me; to look her straight in the
eyeglasses and say: “No, madam, no.
Take your paltry money elsewhere.
Cicis Romanus sum,_and it's my
cushion. A large thing, but mine own.”
But as I stood there, bowed down like a
man grown prematurely old, holding up
my incubus desperately with both hands
by a fold of its skin, my spirit weakened.
“What is the price of that cushion,
please?” said Mildred flostily.
“Fifteen shillings spot cash,” I
replied. “Thank you.”
They took it from me. Somehow they
took it from me, and I stood erect again,
a free man. Oh! the blessedness of that
moment! Free, free, and with the
best years of my life, perhaps, still
before me. I plunged gaily into the
thick of the crowd, I laughed aloud,
I no longer minded the band. . . .
Then came a fleeting vision of purple-
and-pink, and an anxious voice in my
ear: “Good gracious ! whatever have
you done with It?” . . . . . . .
“Sold it again,” I said triumphantly,
“for fifteen shillings.”
“No! The Vicar will be pleased,”
she exclaimed. --
“I don't see why he should be,” I
answered coldly, and so pushed on,
heedless of the troubled wonder in her
eyes. - -
Well, others may fly the Channel or
wander hungrily in absurd realms of
ice. I will not belittle their achieve-
ments. But I am the only man who
ever walked out of a Church Bazaar
richer than he entered it.
That is my title to Fame. I am
content to let it rest at that. -

HUBERT W RE NC H.
AN ESSAY IN UNCTION.
[With acknowledgments to Mr. RAYMoND
BLAthwayt's appreciation of Mr. HUBERT TRENch
in a contemporary.]
Of all the figures who have recently
swum into the histrionicken, none is more
arresting than Mr. HUBERT WRENCH, the
new tenant of the Pall Mall Theatre.
His is truly a luminous personality, with
his Titanic Michelangelesque torso, and
those piercing velvety black eyes which
remind one by turns of the aquiline
optics of the Ancient Mariner and the
most powerful BLéRIOT acetylene lamp.
As a youth he was a famous athlete,
renowned for tossing the caber and
heaving the hundredweight—he repre-
sented the University of Oxford in both
of these events, and established a record
in his last year by hurling the caber
amongst the spectators and seriously
injuring the Prime Warden of New Col-
lege. Viewed from an anthropometric
standpoint, again, he is a man of singu-
lar and massive proportions, measuring
no less than two inches more round the
head, six inches round the chest and
four round the calf, than Mr. HALL CAINE.
But enough of externals. It is the
exuberant mentality of the new director
that lends him his chief charm. Bred
up on the classics he had translated
PERSIUS into Maeso-Gothic before he
entered his teens, and had set the para-
digms of Túrro to music before he left
them. On leaving Oxford, where he
was one of the most notorious “bloods”
of the Bullingdom Club, and took a
double First, HUBERT WRENCH studied
bombination at Barcelona, Esperanto at
the Cape of Good Hope, double bass at
Burton, and jiujitsu at Tokio. For
many years a highly-placed official on
the Board of Education, he had a third
of England under his control, and ruled
it with a rod of iron. Indeed he is said
to be the only man in the world of
whom the redoubtable Sir Robert
MoRANT was thoroughly afraid. So it
has come to pass that he combines the
spiritual intensity of a Bollandist with
the athleticism of a C. B. FRY ; the elas-
ticity of an Archimandrite with the
austere iconoclasm of a Doukhobor. .
He is, in short, a histrionic aviator who
soars on the bi-plane of a centrifugal
enthusiasm far into the empyrean of
choriambic hallucination. A hero-wor-
shipper of the most catholic temper, it is
hard to say whether he cherishes a
deeper devotion for SIDNEY WEBB or
SIDNEY LEE, for ALCIBLADEs or Dr. CLIF-
FoRD, for SEMIRAM is or Mrs. PANKHURST.
An academic Socialist of the most
advanced type he nevertheless con-
descends to associate with members of
the hereditary aristocracy, and with
characteristic heroism has gone so far
Ethel (finding the sermon tedious, and thinking it high time for the collection). “Oh, Mother,
Do PAY The MAN, AND LET's Go HoME.”
as to offer a small non-speaking part to
a ducal enthusiast in one of his forth-
..] coming productions.
But this spiritual anarchy, this cosmic
antinomianism runs right through his
sumptuous and sonorous nature. He
will present SHAKSPEARE with the same
relentless impartiality that he will deal
out to PAUL RUDENs, TolsToi, Lord
RossLYN, STRINDBERG, CECIL IRALEIGH,
MolièRE and Lord SAFFRON DE WALDEN.
Much more might be said of this brave,
this beatific hierophant of the higher his-
trionics, but the utmost exploits of un-
bridled eulogy must always fall far short
of the transcendental reality. Indeed,
it is difficult to speak of him without
screeching. For HUBERT (as he graciously
permits me to call him) is already en-
rolled amongst that hierarchy of elect
souls whose pellucid purpose and high-
souled enthusiasm for the reformation of
social conditions make them “lovely and
endurable [sic] in the sight of man and
ultimately secure them the conquest of
the world.”

AN UNCONVINCING NARRATIVE.
[Yet a third claimant to the Pole has arisen. We print his state-
ment with reserve, and must request our readers to await the necessary
scientific proof before giving credence to his story.]
CoME, gather around, my 'earties, and listen awhile to me,
For I 'ave a yarn to spin you, a yarn of the Polar Sea;
It's as true as I’m standing here, lads, as true as it blows
a gale,
That I was the first as nearly burst a-finding the Great Big
Nail— -
As sworn to by ETUKishook, GAUKRODGER, J. C. CLEGG, Sir
FoRTESCUE FLANNERY, and the Cardinal MERRY DEL VAL.
It was all of a parky morning that wunnerful 4th of March,
When I put on a hextry weskit and made for the Marble
Arch; -
So I sez good-bye to my country, “Lunnon,” I sez, “adoo!”
And I up and strode down the Edgware Road athirsting
to see it through,
Followed by ETUKISHook, GAUKRODGER, J. C. CLEGG, Sir
FoRTESCUE FLANNERY, and the Cardinal MERRY DEL VAL.
I 'adn't no blooming gum-drops, I 'adn't no polar bears,
I’adn't no sextant neither, but I thinks to myself, “’Oo
cares?”
And I waggled my watch-chain jaunty, which was jewelled
in every hole,
“I can always steer by my cumpas 'ere, it's pointing
straight to the Pole.”
“So it is l’” said ETUKishook, GAUKRODGER, J. C. CLEGG, Sir
ForTESCUE FLANNERy, and the Cardinal MERRY DEL VAL.
I walked for the 'ole of that morning, then I sez to myself,
“Old son,
This here is a dash-for-the-Pole like, and it's darn little
dash you've done.”
So I enters an 'andy station, and I sez to the man in the
'utch,
“’Ere, gimme a ticket as goes to Wick—no, a first-return
—'ow much 2
Ah, and five third singles for ETUKISHook, GAUKRoDGER, J. C.
CLEGG, Sir Fortescue FLANNERY, and the Cardinal
MERRY DEL VAL.”
We sailed from Wick to the northward for 'undreds of days
and nights,
Till we came at last to the ice-floes and followed the
Northern lights,
The Horroreo-boreo-balis, which it turned us all 'orrible pale,
And I sez to my men, “To-morrow and then we shall land
at the Great Big Nail.”
“’Ooray!” said ETUkishook, GAUknodger, J. C. CLEGG, Sir
FoRTESCUE FLANNERY and the Cardinal MERRY DEL VAL.
'Twas the cumpas as went and found it—it seemed to have
turned its head,
It would spin like mad for a minute and then it would lay
like dead;
It took on just like a wild thing, you'd almost 'a sworn it
cried,
Till at last it shot through the glass and got right up on
its end and died.
“That proves it,” cried EIUKISHook, GAUKRODGER, J. C. CLEGG,
Sir ForTESCUE FLANNERY, and the Cardinal MERRY DEL
WAL.
We gave three cheers for ole England and we up with the
Union Jack,
And we plugged our pipes and we smoked 'em and we
thought about getting back;
But a wunner ful pride so filled us as we sat on top of the

Partikerlarly out of those of ETUKISHook, GAUKRODGER, J. C.

Then I called for a pen and paper, and I wrote to the KING,
“Dear Kin

So that's how it 'appened, my 'earties, no matter what

Daily Mail,
That I was the first as nearly burst a-finding the Great

They didn't! That proves I 'ad
ON MAKING A BEGINNING.
A coRRESPONDENT of The Daily Telegraph complaims of the
“leave-me-aloneness” prevailing among business men in
City restaurants. He would like “to alter the existing state
of things so that one might exchange a few friendly remarks
to lighten the burden of the day.” “I wonder what would
bring about such an agreeable change in the deeply insular
and absorbed ways of the Londoner?” he asks.
Well, there is of course the weather with which to start
friendly conversation. A common mistake with those who
use this topic is to make some obvious remark that can be
dismissed with a monosyllabic reply of polite agreement. But,
properly used, the subject can be made to lead to discussion.
On a bright autumn day, for instance, remark to your
neighbour, “Very snowy, isn't it?” He will give you a
discourteous look, and say, “I beg your pardon.” Your
reply should be, “Very snowy, I said—not here, of course,
but at the North. Pole”; and there you are with the subject
of the day before you.
Another way of getting into conversation is to call the
manager and accuse your neighbour of picking your pocket.
After the disturbance is over the exchange of profuse
apologies and genial assurances that it is nothing may be
the beginning of a life-long friendship.
A method that has rarely failed is that of asking for the
honour of paying for your neighbour's lunch. This generally
brings a reply of some kind, and as often as not the bright
chat which follows can by tactful management be made so
interesting that the offer that began it is quite forgotten by
both parties.
A further graceful introduction to conversation we
witnessed in a City restaurant only last Friday. Two
strangers were lunching at a table, one an Englishman and
the other apparently a Frenchman. Suddenly the latter,
with all the charm and abandon for which his race is noted,
filled his glass from the Englishman's bottle, and heartily
drank his health, afterwards addressing a few felicitous and
well-chosen words of admiration and esteem. It was an
exceedingly pretty incident.
“It was also rumoured that the Pole was surrounded by ice.”
This startling report is being circulated by a Shetland paper,
and still awaits denial. s

“THOSE DUKES, HOW THEY HARASS USI"
Mr. Lloyd-George.
A vivid commentary on the above
historic phrase is furnished by two
events recorded in the same issue of The
Daily Chronicle.
First of all we read with ever growing
indignation how “Silverlands,” the
bijou and appropriately named Surrey
residence of Sir John BRUNNER, M.P.,
standing in its well-wooded grounds in
a lonely spot a mile and a half from
Chertsey, was entered by burglars, who
succeeded in getting away with-
Two enamel boxes.
Four small silver ships.
Bottom of a large ship in silver.
Several silver vases.
Small silver table.
Two small silver jars.
Small silver cradle.
Silver knives and forks.
Foreign neck collar studded with jewels.
Old-fashioned ring.
Small silver piano.
Silver photo frame.
Four Indian ornaments.
Two fluted silver vases.
Silver card-case.
Antique French clock.
And finally twelve silver trowels and
silver keys presented to Sir John BRUNNER
when opening institutions or laying
foundation stones in different parts of
the country.
The calamity which has befallen Sir
JoBN BRUNNER is grievous enough in itself,
but its severity is enhanced a thousand-
fold by its coincidence and contrast with
a similar visit paid to a notorious re-
presentative of that class now generally
admitted to consist of the enemies of the
human race.
While the Duke and Duchess of
NoRTHUMBERLAND were in residence at
Syon House, some burglars carried a
ladder a quarter of a mile across Syon
Park and effected an entry into the
library. The Duke's private desk was
forced open and his papers tumbled
about. But with a cowardly consideration
that cannot be too severely reprobated
the burglars did not touch the valuable
silver articles, inkstands and other orna-
ments, which were lying about, while the
priceless collection of portraits of the
Seymour and Somerset families, in a
corridor, which might easily have been
cut from their frames, were not inter-
fered with.
Of the silver opportunity thus
neglected we say mothing, but that
burglars, presumably equipped with
suitable weapons, should have thrown
away the golden chance of purloining
the pictorial family records of a ferocious
despot gives rise in Radical bosoms to
thoughts that lie too deep for tears.
We have good reason to believe that
when the news was broken to the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER and Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL, their anguish was
something painful to witness.
The theory that the burglary at Syon
House was committed by Sir EDWARD
GREY in his desire to possess himself of
the originals of his correspondence with
the Duke has met with credence in cer-
tain quarters, and Mr. BELLOC, M.P., will
probably ask a question of the Foreign
Secretary at an early opportunity.
“Congratulations are to-day due to the Rev.
A. A. Dauncey and Mrs. Dauncey, who are
celebrating their ‘silver wedding.” Mr. and
Mrs. Dauncey were married on September 3rd,
1184.
“On Sunday last Mr. and Mrs. Elias Neel,
of 21, Maze-hill, East Greenwich, celebrated
their “golden wedding,' they having been mar-
ried on August 29th, 1895.”
The Kentish Mercury.
After all, the day of the month is the
great thing.

[With acknowledgments to the Editor of

MY DEAREST Totlets, We can never
say quite what we want to say in this
imperfect world of ours. And as I sit
in my old armchair in my dear old den

BiLLIONs of BRIGHT-EYED BABES
who will take this letter out of our first
BiLGE TUB, heart and voice fail me and
the foolish tears will flow. In the really
great moments of life words are of little
use. We can only ladle out the slush of
sentiment from theslop-pailof a full heart.
Thus it is that at this supreme moment
I wish I could divide myself into a billion
pieces so that we could gaze into each
other's billion eyes and wallow in the
undiluted
Slob of MUTUAL ADMIRATION.
I long to come into your lives, to share
your infantile joys and ailments, to whoop
with you in the whooping cough, to
mumble with you in the mumps—in a
word to help you and to have your help,
financial as well as moral, as we meander,
hand in hand, through the good old
maudlin world.
For although I am overflowing with
the oleo-margarine of pure benevolence
I want you, my dearest Totlets, distinctly
to understand that I cannot afford to
provide you with all these chunks of
cheerfulness, all these rivers of joy, all
these bright and brainy puzzles, without
a modest recompense. I want your love,
but I want your pennies as well. I can-
not catch sunshine for nothing. It is
too arduous and heating a pursuit.
I count on you therefore, even while
I am bathed in the dew of Christian
superiority and universal benevolence,
not only to buy the BiLGE TUB yourselves
but also to recommend it to everyone you
know. My best wishes for you always.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Exth ACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Septem-
ber 6.-Remarkable how closer and
closer the manner of REES OF HINDUSTAN
when interpolating a question resembles
action of torpedo. The MEMBER FOR
SARK's most vivid recollection of the sea
pageant at Portsmouth was the torpedo
attack on the Dreadnought. The battle-
ship lay at anchor, a line of swiftly-
steaming black-painted ships passing at
a distance of something under a mile.
As one after another steamed by,
lookers-on observed something leap from
a porthole into the sea. It sank beneath
the water, its deadly course marked by
pathway of bubbles tumultuously floating
on the surface. Swiftly it advanced,
and as it finally struck the guard of the
battleship's hull there rose to the surface
what looked like head of a dull-eyed
fish with indication of a body shaped
like a dolphin.
The passing ships were destroyers;
these, torpedoes launched with unerring
aim at the mighty target. Against the
steel network that protected the hull
they dashed impotently. There was an
almost human look of despair about the
fish heads as again and again they beat
against what bluejackets call the ship's
ºline in frantic attempt to get at the
Ul II.
Thus, or uncannily like it, is action of
REES OF HINDUSTAN at Question hour.
Someone having put Question on paper,
he rises with craftily devised counter-
blast designed to bring the inquirer
to ignominy. As soon as Irish Mem-
bers catch sight of him they raise a
shout of contumely. In low clear
voice, making the most of pauses in
uproar—the torpedo trying to make its
way, through the steel netting—REEs
persists. Again and again he is beaten
back, till sometimes, as happened this
afternoon, the SPEAKER interposes with
suggestion that notice should be given
of the question.
It was Chinese pork that brought the
torpedoes into action to-day. Dr. FELL,
momentarily turning his attention aside
from naval matters, dragged the alien
on to the stage. O'SHAUGHNESSY, burn-
ing with patriotic jealousy, put sup-
plementary question indicating that
pork recently imported, tastily coloured
in ochre or vermilion according to the
predisposition of the purchaser, pertains
to an animal which, prior to decease,
fulfilled in its native town or village the
function of street scavenger. Julius
CESAR BURNS met this allegation by
recitation of an idyll for which he
quoted authority of Consul-General at
Hankow. The rainbow-hued pork which
of late illuminated Smithfield Market
has (so he sang) its parentage in a
DR. FELL DRAGS IN The ChiNESE Pig.
special tribe of pig which, fed on rice
scrupulously ected, roams flower-
decked through the fair valley of the
Yangtse.
It was at this juncture that the torpedo
discharged from the corner seat above
Gangway on Ministerial side was observed
on its relentless course. The attack was
marked by a peculiarity that added
interest to the episode. The first tor-
pedo was launched with unerring aim
from the hon. Member's usual seat
below Gangway. Probably with object
of getting better aim, possibly on prin-
ciple of alderman at City feast who,
feeling the pangs of repletion, took a
cool chair, REES for his second shot
stepped across the Gangway, firing away
from adjoining corner seat. Effect
the same. Torpedo foiled, the baffled
destroyer steamed out into the silent sea.
Business done. —Development and
Road Improvement Funds Bill read
second time by overwhelming majority.
Wednesday, 1 A.M.–Mr. VERNEY, wak-
ing up just now, having suffered nine
hours' talk round Clause 30 of Budget
Bill, found himself famous. The Opposi-
tion were at his feet. It seemed as if he
needed but to lift a finger and they would
crown him Leader of a finally united
Party. SHENSTONE, comfortable under
care of mine host at Henley, recorded
how he “found the warmest welcome
at an inn.” The burst of enthusiasm
that this morning broke on VERNEY's
astonished head greeted him on leaving
an inn.
Debate turned on new version of
ancient jape. “When is an inn not an
inn P” was the question put. Answer:
“When it's a restaurant.” After long
wrangling, VERNEY in voice trembling
with emotion told a story about “a small
well-conducted country inn” threatened
with ruin by the Budget.
“I know that inn,” he said.
often been there.”
The note of pathetic memory that
made musical this last remark touched
a sensitive Opposition.
“Wote with us,” they cried, meta-
plorically mopping the moist eyes of
the Member for North Bucks.
Idea caught on. Here was a good
Liberal, moved by personal experience,
in revolt against the Budget. If they
could only get him into the Division
Lobby with them it would not turn out
the Government, but it would be a use-
ful object-lesson. The Boy SAMUEL,
scenting danger, moved the Closure.
Hereupon what had been a ripple of
genuine sympathy meandering through
Opposition camp bounded over Treasury
Bench a cascade of indignation.
“Why don't you answer your own
side?” WINTERTON, always eager for
information, shouted.
Turning upon VERNEY, who began to

grow alarmed at the turmoil, Opposition
with one voice (and that loud) besought
him to come over, help, and be helped.
Scene was in its way reminiscent of the
Crisis in the war between North and
South America, when Maryland hung
trembling in the balance. Someone—
was it Lord Robert CECIL 2–hummed
the old war-song:
“The despot's heel is on thy shore,
Maryland, my Marylandſ
His torch is at thy temple door,

-
“MARY'Bone, My MARY'bone "
“Someone—was it Lord Robert Cecil 2–
hummed the old war-song.”
(Gen'ral Robert K. Cecil, U.S.A.)
Like Maryland, VERNEY was wavering.
LEIf JoxEs seated himself by his side
with evident intent of bucking him up.
Hereupon a perfect howl of execration
rose from Opposition. A little mixed
in moment of excitement, one shouted
across the floor:
“Lief him alone, LEAVE Joxes.”
But everybody knew what was meant.
Amid the din the CHAIRMAN mutely put
the Question. Tellers named and the
order given to clear the Lobby, the
Opposition remained seated, watching
the champion of the country inn.
“Vote with us, WERNEY!” they shouted.
“Come along, now 's your chance!”
Slowly VERNEY uplifted his columnar
form. There was a look of anguish on
his face as he glanced first at door of
Opposition Lobby, then at that through

which Ministerial host streamed. As he
finally turned in latter direction, an
agonised cry of “Oh!” went up from
the Opposition, rising and falling like
the moaning of the wind in bleak pine

Thursday.—LLoyd-GEORGE laments the
turn of fate that placed the North
Pole under a foreign flag. Had it been
added to British Territory it would have
brought with it illimitable opportunity
of fresh taxation. What countless miles
of undeveloped land surround it at
respectful distance! What unparalleled
richness of ungotten minerals the dark
unfathomed caves of ocean beneath it
bear! But there is no hope.
GILBERT PARKER, with untameable
instinct for added Empire, asks the
PREMIER, Who owns the Pole? Assum-
ing it be true that Commander PEARY
has, as he affirms, nailed the American
Flag to the concrete projecting spar,
will the action give the United States
right of possession over the region?
PREMIER not easily drawn. You can't
touch him up with a Pole, however long,
howsoever far north.
“The question,” he said, “involves
too much hypothetical matter to justify
a definite answer.”
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER's
eyes now turn hopefully to Antarctic
regions. If the American eagle has
swarmed up the North Pole, the British
Lion must fold his tail round the South
Pole. In that region also there is un-
limited land undeveloped, ungotten
minerals galore.

MESSRs. Press, Button & Co., the
enterprising American firm, whose object
in life is to save time and labour, have
just issued a most admirable skeleton
article for the use of magazine editors,
which it is claimed will reduce the
expenses very considerably, while doing
everything that the public requires. As
is well known, the reader to-day of maga-
zines or weekly papers has but one
desire, and that is to learn all he can
about his heroes on the stage, in politics,
or in literature, and he is especially
pleased when they describe what they
consider their best achievement. There
must be the personal touch. He does
not mind how familiar, how hackneyed
the setting, provided there are enough
new gems in it. In any capable inter-
view the gems are of course supplied by
the celebrity; the setting is the work of
the interviewer. It is slight enough
work, but it costs something, and the
thanks of all editors should be given to
Messrs. Press, Button & Co. for saving
them even that something. The invention
takes the form of a skeleton interview
with a number of spaces to be filled up
by the celebrity, to whom it is posted—
with a stamped envelope enclosed. That
is not particularly novel; the striking
thing about this patent is the fulness of
the directions, very American in their
minuteness and clarity, which accom-
pany it. It begins thus:

with the pleasing purpose in view of

cigarettes, he asked what he could do
for him. [Note: there is also a form of
this article in which spaces are left for the
name of the maker of the car, upholsterer,
brand of cigarette, and so forth.] “I
make a point,” Mr. [name] began, “of

tion took place at the [name of club], and
I remember that there were also present

Mr. [name] was interrupted at this
point by the entry of his beautiful wife,
who, linking her arm affectionately into
his, joined in the conversation with
vivacity and charm.
There is a lot more, but enough has
been given to illustrate the extreme
value of the article. The price is so low
that no editor can afford to be without a
parcel of them, and no journalist can
afford to compete with it. And surely
that is one of the ends of American
enterprise!

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Who says that the
age of chivalry is dead?
Listen to the following unvarnished
tale of rescue by a modern knight-
errant:
“I was on the pier at a large seaside resort
the other evening, and, happening to go down
on to the landing stage, I, in a remote part of it,
came upon a young lady in great distress, in
fact she was on the verge of hysteria. She told
me that one of her heels had become fixed in
the grating, and in trying to release it the other
had also jammed, and she had been a prisoner
for over an hour. I unbuttoned her boots and
assisted her to get out of them, and then with
some difficulty succeeded in rescuing them from
the grating in a more or less damaged condi-
tion. I found them to be a pair of very smart
patent leather boots, with heels very little short
of four inches in height. It would of course
have been quite simple for her to have got out
of her boots before, but apparently her waist
was so pinched and her dress so tight that she
was unable to stoop down to unbutton them."
Surely the hero of this poignant in-
cident, who recently vouched for its
veracity over his own name in The
Chronicle, would be a fitting recipient of
the Order of Merit.
Cordially yours,
MoRDECAi Stutters.

DEAR, when I gaze into your eyes,
Whose light—I give my word—outvies
The very sun,
Show me, I say, a pair as blue,
As deep, as clear, and so forth–pooh!
There isn't one. -
And when beneath the friendly trees
I give your hand an ardent squeeze
Down in the wood
I feel, whate'er of ill may be,
It is the solid fact to me
That this is good.
When coyly on my heaving breast
You, in expansive moments, rest
Your head and hat,
Why, them to all the world I cry,
Take it or leave it, what care I?
You won't beat that
But when the failing day is low,
And love (inversely) seems to grow
Ever more fond ;
When, somewhat nervously, I press
Upon your lips a chaste care-s,
And you respond;—
I am as one that's blind–I reel—
I don't know what to say—I feel
A swift shock strike
Mw, whole soul through; and in my bliss,
“This,” I remark with fervour, “this
Is something like.”

MANY are the insidious and far-reach-
ing effects of the present Budget, and
now we have to note an especially
poignant and olfactory outcome, of
which we trust that the CHANCELLOR of
The ExchEQUER will take due notice—and
mend his ways. The Goddess Nicotine
is in a fair way to be dethroned by

increasing class of smokers, unable to
meet the enhanced price of tobacco, are
finding a substitute in sweets. A large
proportion of football enthusiasts, it is
said, are being obliged to steady their
nerves and control their hysteria with the
soothing acid drop, cice the more full-
flavoured, but ruinous, fag. The next
step will be to provide Peppermint
Compartments in railway trains.
We shudder for Mr. BARRIE, forced to
bring out his next successor to Peter Pan
under the influence of brandy-balls.
Ourselves, at the present moment, are
trying to light a chocolate cigarette with

AT THE PLAY.
KING LEAR.
IF among those who saw Mr. HERBERT
TRENCH's presentation of King Lear last
Wednesday there were any who had
never read the play, there must have been
times when they were rather puzzled.
The First Act seems on the stage so
childish: Lear's division of his kingdom
among his daughters perfect farce; Ed-
mund's villainy perfect melodrama, even
down to the forged letter. Is this, he

would have asked himself, really the
greatest tragedy in the world 2
wards he would have admitted that it
was ; but minor difficulties of construc-
tion would then have arisen to puzzle
him. What, for instance, were the
relations of Gomeril and Regan with
I'dmund 2
Now, although King Lear will always
read better than it plays, Mr. The NCH
and his company must not be held
blameless for the mystification of the
unread spectator. We might well have
been given more of the scenes between
the wicked sisters and the villain, and
the fact that these were cut down
brought about, in the midst of tragedy,
a most laughable situation. Thus:–
Act V., SCENE 2 (on the stage).
Gentleman. Help! Help! O help.
0, she's dead!
Albany. Who dead? Speak, man. -
Gentleman. Your lady, sir, your lady. And
her sister by her is poisoned. -
Edmund (dying, in a cery melancholy coice).
I was contracted to them both.
This of course is the actual text; but
owing to the omission of previous scenes
After-
will happen on every night.
the situation came upon the audience so
suddenly that there were titters all over
the theatre. -
. I don't think Mr. Nory. AN McKINNEL
helped us to get through the first scene
as well as he might have done. Lear
was, I imagine, an obstinate and rather
silly old man, who had already decided
how to divide his kingdom and had
thought of a little birthday joke with
which to pass it off. . . It had seemed
to him quite a funny idea, and when
Cordelia was sweetly serious over it he
lost his temper; each of them being
obstimate the tragedy followed. Mr.
McKINNEL was too big and strong and
dignified for this. I am sure that he
didn't realise that old men will have
their little jokes; I am sure that in that
first scene he didn't realise how old he
was. He was splendid afterwards, when
the character suited him better.
I have no quarrel with Mr. DAwsox
Milward because the childish villainics
of Edmund were not made to seem more
natural. Edmund belongs to an age, when
the most simple plot seemed supernatu-
ally cunning and the jokes of the Pool
were bearable. Yet it was a pity that of
all the players he and Edgar had the
most modern manner. The surprise of
the cast to me was Mr. CHARLEs V.
FRANCE's performance as the Earl of
Kent. I have seen him play well in
many modern comedies, and I thought
that he least of all would give the illusion
of 900 B.C. Yet he did; he was Kent every
|inch ; and I found his performance the
|most enjoyable of the evening. -
FISHER WHITE was excellent as the cruel ||
Mr.
Cornwall, but nobody would have ex-
pected anything else from such a talented
actor. All the three sisters were good;
one would have liked to see more

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SINCE the days when he began to write for the old St.
James's I have consumed a good deal of Mr. PETT RIDGE's patent
food for grown-up infants (that's you and me and all novel-
readers of discernment), and I can cordially recommend the
latest brand. The label, Splendid Brother (METHUEN), is of
course ironical, for irony is to Mr. PETT RIDGE's books in the
same proportion as water to the human body, and that,
though I will never believe it, is said to be about 97 per cent.
But the forcefulness of his irony is always tempered by
a kindly sympathy with human nature, and his stupid,
vulgar, low-down characters are positively almost as intelli-
gent and chivalrous and high-minded as the people we see
in the mornings when we are brushing or “doing" our

may bee, and to destroy their carracks and galleons.” Then

to the British conquest and to still more recent times which
even to me are not quite unfamiliar.
of all ages.
When Mr. E. F. BENSON wrote The Image on the Sands, he
wanted to make us believe that people might be possessed
by two sorts of spirits, black and white (no, this is not an
advertisement); but his brother, R. H., seems to have the
authority of his Church for holding that it is only possible
to evoke the powers of darkness. In The Necromancers
(HUTCHINSON) he tells the story of a young man who dabbles
in magic with disastrous results, and is only saved after a
hair. Leonard Drew, contractor,
the “splendid” elder brother of
Henry Drew, who tells the story,
was a paragon of selfishness.
But, like The Egoist, he had a
leg, a happy knack of doing
everything well and taking
everybody in, especially his
biographer. Splendide mendar,
he lied and borrowed and stole
his way up from the little New
Cross shop where his mother sold
American Cheddar and yellow
soap, till, viá the County Council,
he almost became a Member of
Parliament. And all the while
Henry, who was virtuously but
unpriggishly plodding his way
towards a dear little wife and a
tidy little fortune, believed in
him, and financed him, and got
him out of scrapes, and finally
shipped him off to Australia, just
as David Copperfield did with
Mr. Micawber, to try a fresh
start. In endeavouring to make
him a little blind to his splendid
brother's faults I think Mr. PETT *_2: tºº
Ridge has rather overdone it. ~~~~
But he has overdone it very -
well.
So many thoughts crowded my mind when I had read a
few pages of Mr. IAN ID. ('oly IN's book, South Africa, in the
“Romance of Empire” Series (JAck) that I found it quite
difficult to get on. I wondered, for instance, whether every-
body else who talks familiarly of the Cape is as ignorant as I
was, before Mr. Colvix taught me the facts, that the dis-
covery of the Cape of Good Hope was really a move in the
fifteenth-century conflict between the Cross and the Crescent
—an incident in a great Portuguese expedition to solve the
mystery of the Moorish sources of wealth which were found
to lie in their trade with the East in the Indian Ocean.
There are hundreds of other things in Mr. Colvix's fascinat-
ing book which I didn't know, but I cite this one because,
if the mention of it should chance to hit anybody else rather
badly, he can argue that it happened about five centuries
ago, and there is some excuse for having forgotten it.
Besides, as Mr. Colvin himself says, “it is a little hard to
realise that the Portuguese were exploring East Africa when
the English were still fighting the Wars of the Roses, and
that an army was being led three or four hundred miles up
the Zambesi when Shakspeare was little more than a boy.”
THE IRONY OF CIRCUMSTANCE.
terrible crisis by the will-power
of the girl who loves him. A
sympathetic study of a tho-
roughly sincere and able medium
is introduced; and the hero's
aunt, a lady whose religious
thought moves on a very ordi-
nary plane, makes a good con-
trast to the “intenseness” of
most of the characters. The
author's imaginative skill and
descriptive power throughout
are quite at their best, but as to
his argument I confess I am not
quite clear. The spirits of the
blest, he seems to say, cannot
return to earth, because they are
otherwise and more happily en-
gaged; so the daemons of evil
seize the opportunity of me-
diumistic trances and occupy
mortal bodies. But, seeing that
spirits are admittedly beyond all
temporal and spatial limitations,
it is surely impossible to prove
that they cannot be in two places
or doing two different things at
once. Perhaps Mr. A. C. BENson
will step into the breach and
smooth away my mystifications.
At any rate I think a book of
* his might be guaranteed to lull
the most malevolent and vindictive spooks to rest.
*~3–~s
In compensation for an unfaithful father, an invertebrate
mother, a prudish sister and a garrulous aunt, Miss Priscilla
CRAVEN has given Ghita Streatfield, the heroine of A Lighted
Candle (ALSTON Rivers), the quality of grit. But considering
the handicap it was not enough, and I wish that, along with
this grit, she might have been given a little more womanli-
ness. Her lack of this virtue may be chiefly ascribed to her
aunt, Mrs. Meyer, who possessed a mari aveugle and a tiresome
habit of talking about her infidelities. Mrs. Meyer, one is led
to suppose, was a very smart lady, but however smart she may
have been, and however prone to superfluity of speech, I do
not believe that she could have said, “Give me over the
matches.” In the end Ghita's grit was defeated by Mr. Gott-
schalk's iron will, and had I been told more about him and
less of her relations I should have returned thanks; for
Miss CRAVEN can draw a self-made man without making him
ridiculous, and is far more successful with her serious
characters than with those who endeavour to be amusing
but only succeed in being flippant.

Beyond the range of vulgar seers
Must have delayed your non-stop flights
During the past two thousand years!
Amid how many strange events

Since you appeared above the tents
Of good old JUDAs MACCABEUs!
On one of your too transient trips
You marked the Huns hot-foot for Rome;
Later, you watched the Norman ships

Saw Dutchmen, at Gibraltar, break
The Spanish frigates, mast to kelson;
Assisted at the Lisbon quake,
And beamed upon the birth of NELSON.
Not bad. But yet your visual scope
Should soon be more severely tried,
If, as I hear, you rather hope
To join us in the winter-tide;

In your experience as a comet,
And you might like to try and catch
Some coruscating humour from it.
And, should your other plans permit,
We shall be pleased for you to stay
And notice how our native wit
Decides the issue of the day;
For then, if comets lack for mirth
And find a human farce consoling,
You'll see the brightest show on earth—

“I thought the inkerrament tax might 'a done 'im,” said
the porter.
“Oh, I don't know nothin' about your taxes. I'm only
tellin' you the story. It was last Sunday night. We 'd bin
to 'Ampstead in the arternoon, and we 'd come 'ome tired,
father and mother and me, and we was settin' in the front
parlour, when Uncle Bill come in. Uncle Bill 's mother's
brother, and 'e's got on in the world and laid by a pot o'
money. 'Ouse property's 'is game. When 'e saves a bit 'e
goes and puts it into bricks and mortar. 'Ouses can't run
away, 'e says. It 's made 'im a bit uppish. When 'e makes
a joke 'e wants you to laugh at it. Mother's always 'ad a
'ard job to keep father orf of 'im. Father says it fair chokes
'im to 'ear Uncle Bill talk o' the rights o' property when 'e
remembers 'im sellin' newspapers in the streets not so many
years ago. Well, Uncle Bill come in very 'earty, and 'e says
|so we kep it in the family.
'e knows there 's a steak pudden for supper; 'e could sniff
it, 'e says, 'arf a mile away, and 'e's bound to 'ave 'is share
of it. Father 'ad took orf is coat and unbuttoned 'is weskit
and undone 'is braces—made 'isself comfortable like, and ’e
told mother to pull up a chair for Uncle Bill and 'urry up
with the pudden. Then they began to talk. Uncle Bill
says if 'e could get 'old o' LLOYD-GEORGE 'e'd smash im.
‘What's LLOYD-GEORGE done to you?” says father; and Uncle ||
Bill let go for five minutes about the Budget and the 'Ouse
o' Lords. “You’re very thick with the 'Ouse o' Lords,’ says
father; ‘you’ll be bringin' 'ome a Duke to dinner,' 'e says,
‘and askin' 'im to 'ang 'is coronit be ind the door and put
'is feet on the table if 'e likes. That's your sort all over,’
says father. This made Uncle Bill mad, and 'e says 'e won't
'ear a word agin Dukes, and as for LLOYD-GEORGE 'e's a
Socialist, and 'e's drivin' capital out o' the country with 'is
death duties and 'is supper taxes. ‘Well,’ says father, “if
there is a supper tax you ain't payin' it. It’s my steak-
pudden, and the tax comes on me and I'm willin' to pay. I
don't owl for Dreadnoughts and then squeal when the bill
comes in. That ain't my sort.’
“Uncle 13ill couldn't stand this. 'Is face went white with
little red spoºs all over it, and 'e got out of 'is chair and
said 'e wouldn't stay to be insulted. 'E was goin' 'ome to
alter 'is will, 'e said. “Leave it all to the Duke o' Bermondsey,’
says father, ‘’oo cares what you do with your dirty money?’
Mother come in as father said this, and she was just in
time to get a crack o' the side of the 'ead from Uncle Bill's
clay pipe. 'E meant it for father, but it landed on mother,
Father's a very proud man,
and when 'e saw mother rub 'er'ead 'e fair lost 'is temper
and 'e give Uncle Bill one in the eye. “There's a bit of
capital for you,' 'e says, and 'e knocked Uncle Bll backards
agin the wall. That ended it ; and Uncle Bill got out quick,
and we ain't seen 'im since. My new 'at got trod on in the
scuffle. You can't wear a 'at after father's put is feet
through it.”
“'Ow did your father come to lose is braces 2" asked the
porter. -
“’E says Uncle Bill must 'a took them when they was
wrestlin’ about together; but 'e won't demean 'isself to send
round for 'em, 'e says. But, you can understand I don't
want to 'ear any more about this 'ere Budget.”

TAKING A CALL.
“MAY I come in 2’” said Miss Mid-
dleton.
I looked up from my atlas (I am going
in for the geographical competition) and
stared at her in amazement.
“Hullo,” I said.
“Hullo,” said Miss Middleton doubt-
fully. .
“Are you going to have tea with
me?”
“That's what I was wondering all the
way up.”
“It’s all ready; in fact, I've nearly
finished. There's a cake to-day, too.”
Miss Middleton hesitated at the door
and looked wistfully at me.
“I suppose—I suppose,” she said
timidly, “you think I ought to have
brought somebody with me?”
“In a way, I'm just as glad you
didn't.”
“I’ve heaps of chaperons outside on
the stairs, you know.”
“There's no place like outside for
chaperons.”
“And the liftman believes I'm your
aunt. At least, perhaps he doesn't, but
I mentioned it to him.” -
I looked at her, and then I smiled.
And then I laughed.
“So that's all right,” she said breath-
lessly. “And I want my tea.” She
came in, and began to arrange her hat in
front of the glass.
“Tea,” I said, going to the cup-
board. “I suppose you'll want a cup
to yourself. There you are—don't lose
it. Milk. Sugar.”
Miss Middleton took a large piece of
cake. “What were you studying so
earnestly when I came in 2'' she asked
as she munched.
“An atlas.”
“An atlas’ Don't say you 've been
too ! I'm going to the South Pole—
it's much more splendid. I expect I
shall dress like the Esquimaux women;
I've seen pictures of them, and Father
agrees it would suit me. Do they
have Esquimaux at the South Pole 2
They must have somebody, because how
would the polar bears live? But per-
haps they don't have polar bears.”
I took a deep breath.
“I’m awfully glad to see you,” I said,
“and you’re looking jolly, but do you
think your chaperons would mind if
you sat down for a moment and stopped
chattering” Because I want your help
in rather an important matter.”
Miss Middleton sat down and drank
her tea. “I love helping,” she said.
“Well, it's this. I've just been asked
to be a godfather.”
Miss Middleton stood up suddenly.
“Do I salute 7" she asked.
“You sit down and go on eating. The
diſficulty is—what to call it?”
“Oh, do godfathers provide the
names?”
“I think so. It is what they are there
for, I fancy. That is about all there is
in it, I believe.”
“And can't you find anything in the
atlas P’’
“No, there's nothing in the atlas.
“Sierra Leone’ and “Teddington’ are the
best.”
“How about quite a simple name?
Had you thought of ‘John,' for in-
stance 2''
“No, I hadn't thought of ‘John,' some-
how.”
“Or ‘Gerald'?”
“‘Gerald 'I like very much.”
“What about “Dick’?” she went on
eagerly.
“Yes, ‘Dick” is quite jolly. By the
way, did I tell you it was a girl?”
Miss Middleton rose with dignity.
“For your slice of plum cake and your
small cup of tea I thank you,” she said,
“and I am now going straight home to
Mother.”
“Not yet,” I pleaded.
“I’ll just ask you one question before
I go. Where do you keep the biscuits?”
She found the biscuits and sat down
again.
“A girl's name,” I said encouragingly.
“Yes. Well, is she fair or dark?”
“She's very small at present. What
there is of her is dark, I believe.”
“Well, there are millions of names
for dark girls.”
“We only want one or two.”
“‘Barbara' is a nice dark name. Is
she going to be pretty 2”
“Her mother swears she is. I didn't
recognize the symptoms. Very pretty
and very clever and very high-spirited,
her mother says. Is there a name for
that ?”
“I always call them whoppers,” said
Miss Middleton under her breath.
“How do you like ‘Alison Mary’?
That was my first idea.”
“Oh, I thought it was always ‘William
and Mary.” Or else ‘Victoria and Albert.”
“I didn't say ‘Alice and Mary, stoopid.
I said ‘Alison,' a Scotch name.”
“But how perfectly sweet! Did you
make it up yourself, or does it come
from the atlas’ Oh, why weren't you
my godfather! Would you have given
me a napkin ring?”
“Probably. I will now, if you like.
Then you approve of ‘Alison Mary’?”
“I love it. Thank you very much.
And will you always call me ‘Alison’ in
future?”
“I say,” I began in alarm, “I’m not
giving that name to you. It's for my
godchild.”
“Oh no! ‘Alisons’ are always fair.”
“You’ve just made that up,” I said
suspiciously. “How do you know?”
“Sort of instinct.”
“The worst of it is I believe you're
right.”
“Of course I am. That settles it.
Now, what was your next idea?”
“Angela.”
“‘Angelas,’” said Miss Middleton,
“are always fair.”
“Why do you want all the names to
yourself? You say everything's fair.”
“Why can you only think of names
beginning with ‘A’? Try another letter.”
“Suppose you try now.”
Miss Middleton wrinkled her brow
and nibbled a lump of sugar.
“‘Dorothy,’” she said at last, “be-
cause you can call them ‘Dolly.’”
“There is only one.”
“Or ‘I)0do.’”
“And it isn’t a bird.”
“Then there 's ‘Violet.’”
“My good girl, you don't understand.
Any of these common names the parents
could have thought of for themselves.
The fact that they have got me in at
great expense—to myself-shows that
they want something out of the ordinary.
How can I go to them and say, “After
giving a vast amount of time to the
question I have decided to call your
child “Violet” 2' It can't be done.”
Miss Middleton absently took another
lump of sugar and, catching my eye,
put it back again.
“I don't believe that you've ever been
a godfather before,” she said, “or that
you know anything at all about what
it is you're supposed to be going to do.”
There was a knock at the door, and
the liftman came in. Miss Middleton
gave a little cough of recognition.
“A letter, Sir,” he said.
“Thanks. . . . And as I was saying,
Aunt Alison,” I went on in a loud voice,
“you are talking rubbish.” --
4: + *
“Bah!” I said angrily, and I threw
the letter down.
“Would you like to be left alone?”
suggested Miss Middleton, kindly.
“It is from the child's so-called
parents, and their wretched offspring is
to be called “Violet Daisy.’”
“‘Violet Daisy,’” said Miss Middleton
solemnly, trying not to smile.
“Why stop there?” I said bitterly.
“Why not ‘Geranium' and ‘Artichoke,”
and the whole blessed garden 2°
“‘Artichoke,’” said Miss Middleton
gravely, “is a boy's name.”
“Well, I wash my hands of the whole
business now. No napkin ring from me.
Here have I been wasting hours and
hours in thought, and then just when
the worst of it is over they calmly step
in like this. I call it—”
“Yes?” said Miss Middleton eagerly.
“I call it simply x:
“Yes?” said Miss Middleton.
“‘Violet Daisy,” I finished, with a
great effort. A. A. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
POLAR PROTEST.S.
CAPTAIN SCOTT has received thousands
of applications from persons ambitious
to join his expedition in search of the
South Pole. He has also received letters
urging him not to accept certain candi-
dates, and of these letters we are able to
print a few.
A Fond Mother writes:– “I am
greatly distressed by my son Harold's
determination to join your expedition.
He feels sure that his experience gained
as a Boy Scout since last Easter would
be most useful to you in discovering the
South Pole. He certainly is a clever
boy, but he suffers from a weak chest,
and even in summer he runs great risk
in the scanty uniform of the Scout. On
the sea and amid the ice and snow I
cannot think what might happen to him,
and I beg of you to let a mother's plead-
ing persuade you to spare him to me,
whatever inclination you may have to
avail yourself of his knowledge, which
really is considerably above the average.”
Another letter runs:—“Captain Scot,
if my husbun arsks you to taik him to
the soth Poal dont you. he as got to
stop hom and do a bit of wurk for me
and his ofsprings like whot I kepe on
tellin him. his name is called Sam
Brown but is artfull enugh to call hiself
Robinson or anythink. he will sure to
say you mede not trubble to bring him
back and you will no him by that and if
he coms to see you he as got a wudden
leg. Yours sinserly Mrs. Brown.”
SweFT SEVENTEEN writes: “Harry has
made me so miserable by saying that he
will volunteer to go with you. It was
all over a stupid mecktie: he wanted a
horrid plain one ; I wanted him to have
the one with little pink flowers, and Imade
him buy it. Please, dear Captain Scott,
he is not so strong and clever as his
letter may lead you to think—at least,
he is not strong and clever enough to
fight polar bears and learn Equimox (is
that the way to spell it 2), though he is
awfully handsome. Of course it would
be splendidly heroic of him to find the
South Role; but there are other heroic
things that need not take him away
from England—like the Territorials and
that sort of thing. Dear Captain Scott,
I am sure you know just how I feel, and
I think you are such a nice and
courageous man, so please don't take
Harry.”
The Editor of a popular magazine
writes:—“I have learnt to-day that
Mr. , the well-known author,
is desirous of joining your expedition, his
purpose being to gain local colour for a
South Polar romance, and to escape for
a time from the house-dinners of the
Authors' Club. As the withdrawal of
this popular writer's work from our
pages even for a time would be disas-
trous to this magazine, I consider that
I am justified in informing you that
Mr. —— — is an inveterate and
shockingly bad bridge-player, and that
he suffers from chronic and acute indiges-
tion—things which render him but poor
company in a confined space like an ice-
cabin or a snow-hut. If you could see
your way to avoid accepting his offer I
should be most grateful; and as some
recognition of your assistance I should
be happy to consider the publication of
the exclusive serial rights of your
‘story' when you return, at our usual
rates of payment.”
THE BORDER LAND.
WHEN forty years had taken toll
Of love-locks from my plundered poll,
I smugby smiled within my soul,
“For mow,” thought I, “I’m mated
To peaceful middle age. No more
Need I attempt to ply the oar,
The bat I always found a bore,
The racquet which I hated.
“It is no more my painful lot
To train away what flesh I’ve got
In hopes of capturing some pot
Or silly bit of ribbon.”
I hailed the prospect of repose,
And so, with spectacles on nose,
I settled in my chair to doze
At leisured ease through Gibbon.
Serene and calm life's evening grew,
And sweetly swift the moments flew
Till soon—yes, all too soon—I knew
Without my wife I’d reckoned;
She, thirsting with a fiery thirst
For youth, grew wrath when I, immersed
In the delights of tome the first,
Would offer her the second.
She still has ears to hear the call
Of sportive youth that cries, “Love all!”
Refusing to decline and fall
Into the sere and yellow ;
She craves the fast and furious set,
The lightning rally at the net—
She is not ripe for Gibbon yet,
While I am richly mellow.
So when returning tired from town
At four o'clock I settle down
To read the master, fierce her frown,
And rage begins to bubble;
She fidgets in her chair. I see
Nerve-shaking glances shot at me
And wonder what on earth will be
The end of all this trouble.
Will her white hairs, which draw a groan
When in the mirror they are shown,
First shame her into playing Joan,
Contented to be one with
This Darby? Or perhaps the shame
Of having but a waist in name
Will drive me to resume a game
That I had hoped was done with ?
THE COMPLEX LIFE.
“I HAVE seen a good deal in the
papers lately,” said Ponker, “about the
unwisdom of bringing up boys and girls
with separate sets of ideals; and when
I read anything under that head, I think
of poor Tarleton Weir smoking his
lonely pipe o' nights by the pale light
of the Southern Cross, and dreaming all
the while of the London street lamps.”
He allowed a minute for the visualiza-
tion of this pathetic picture, and then
continued:—
“For ten years Tarleton lived very
contentedly in a garret. Not a garret
really, you know, but three top-floor,
Turkey-carpeted rooms overlooking the
gardens of one of the Inns of Court;
and his sober wishes never learned to
stray very far from the scene of his
daily labours at the Chancery Bar. At
night, for example, he would often spend
long hours by his own fireside, nursing
an unread French novel, and thinking
about things. (Most people are in-
capable of thought, and that is why
jig-saw puzzles and the musical comedies
are possible.)
“Well, it was at some semi-public
function that he met Cartwright; and
Cartwright, by one of those mischances
that will happen, took a great fancy to
him. “Now mind,” he said, as he
gripped Tarleton's hand at parting—
he was a loud, genial, elderly man,
this Cartwright person—“mind, you've
promised to dine with us this day week.
Not a party, you know—you must just
take us as you find us.” “Oh ! not at
all,’ murmured Tarleton, which obviously
was not the right answer, but sounded
polite. (What is the proper answer, by
the way, to this inanity ?)
“Tarleton was never a good hand at
excuses, and as he failed to frame one
within the week, he had to go all the
way out to Raynes Park and take the
Cartwrights as he found them.
“He found them attaching more
importance to table decorations than to
the quality of their claret, and he soon
suspected that Mary, the eldest daughter,
was not blameless in this matter.
“Now, although (so he afterwards
assured me) he was dull and distrait
that evening, the Cartwrights (for some
reason never discerned) persisted in
liking him. So other invitations fol-
lowed, and passive resistance seemed
unavailing. There were Sundays up
the river, a week-end visit . . . and
then there came a day when one of the
Cartwright flappers said, ‘Oh, Mr. Weir
will come on with Mary, of course, in
the canoe.’
“He knew there was no way out of it
them. He never blamed Mary or the
flappers or anyone, but accepted the
situation man fully.

PUNCH, OR
“There seemed to be mo good reason
for delay. And so these two poor dears
prepared, each in separate fashion, to
tread the thorny path of Life together.
Tarleton bought a ticket for the Stores,
because he thought he would get his
tobacco a little cheaper that way, and
Mary decided that she ought now to go
to a dressmaker whose charges were
really ruinous.
“But still there might have been no
catastrophe, I think, if Tarleton had not
been shown the wedding-presents all at
once, or if Mary had been tactful enough
to say, ‘You know, my dear, we can
easily sell them, and spend the money
on cigars.”
“At first Tarleton was merely bewil-
dered; he had never seen so many
unnecessary things collected together in
one room before. He looked blankly
about him, and saw hideously-distorted
reflections of his own face mowing at
him from a hundred plated butter-
coolers. Then, in a flash, he realised it
all, and knew that he had got to live
with these horrors. Hand-painted milk-
ing-stools, that upset at a touch, would
dot his drawing-room. The sacred break-
fast hour would be made turbulent by
the bubbling and steaming of patent
urns and egg-boilers. For a pepper-pot
he must make choice between a silver
owl with perforated head and an electro-
plated lighthouse. Books must be cut
with a jewelled scimitar, instead of with
the forefinger. There were surgical
implements for the elaborate dissection
of walnuts and lobsters, and a tantalus
promised the misery of hunting for a
key every time he wanted a whisky-and-
soda. . . . And clocks! Nineteen of
them ' and each to be wound daily, or
only on Fridays, or biennially, or some-
thing! And a silver-and-ebony pipe-
rackſ (“So kind of the dear Dean to
remember your tastes,’ said Mary; ‘you’ll
have to be tidy now, Tarleton.’ ‘Yes,
but what on earth is it for?' gasped
Tarleton. And then it was broken to
him. Pipes were to be kept, if you
please, sus. per coll, like criminals—as
if mantelpieces had never been invented
—in a little dark room under the hot-
water cistern—the ‘smoking-room,’ gad-
zooks! And Tarleton, mark you, was
the author of that sublime phrase, “The
world is my smoking-room’—the noblest
rebuke, surely, ever administered to an
over-officious club secretary.
| “Life stretched before #. in dreary
perspective, with every daily act trans-
formed into a hideous little ceremony,
to be carried out with the aid of glitter-
ing appliances of wrought silver or the
best electro-plate. New and trivial
duties confronted him, too — as, for
example, to be sure and press grapes
upon the Jacksons when they dimed at
his house, because they were the givers

of the silver grape-scissors. A great
disgust of over-civilization seized him.
Mary he could have liked, but Mary's
Fancy Bazaar—never ! It was all too
terribly complex . . .
“The night before the wedding-day
a pale man slunk inconspicuously
through the dock gates at Southampton;
and when the light of morn broke out
over the waters he was lying very, very
ill in a comfortable state-room some-
where south of the Wight.”

: “I don't know,” replied Ponker slowly.
“I think Mary's education was to blame.
Girls are brought up to think the silver
superfluities of life are essential to
married happiness, while man's natural
tendency is to go and live without sugar-
tongs in a tent. Woman ought to meet
him halfway. And I think,” he added,
grave beyond his wont, “I think these
two might have lived very happily
together if Mary could have been con-
tent to crack nuts—if nuts she must
have—in the ordinary way, in the
dining-room door. . . .”
He shook his head sadly, and fell into
a reverie.

the famous novelist, “I experienced a
sensation of delirious ecstasy only com-
parable to the sensations of a reader of
one of my books or a spectator of one of
my plays. So powerful was the en-
chantment that I was insensibly moved
to sing, and warbled the following lines
in my fruitiest baritone:— -
But Poetry in Fiction takes delight,
And, mounting up in figures out of sight,
Leaves Truth behind her in audacious
flight.
The effect of my singing was so over-
whelming that the General and the
Lieutenant both simultaneously let go
their hold of everything, and the tri-
plane plunged down with appalling
velocity. Realising our danger, by a
supreme effort of volition I distended
my cranium with such extraordinary
success as to counteract the downward
swoop and practically to convert an
aeroplane into a balloon. Reassured by
my intrepid intervention, the two sky-
pilots recovered their equanimity and
soon manoeuvred the machine gently
to mother earth.” - -
Mr. CHESTERTON, after flying with Mr.
Cody on Laffan's Plain, expressed him-
self as follows to a representative of the
Paradox Club :—
“When Cody's aeroplane rose, I found,
like D'ANNUNzio, that the conscious-
ness of the weight of my body seemed
entirely lost, and the relief was so
ecstatic that in order to render it justice
I was obliged to chant the lines from
Quinault:
Il est beau qu'un mortel jusques aux cieux
s'élève, - - -
Il est beau mème d'en tomber.
I may say that I returned to earth re-
luctantly. But the effect will not soon
pass off. . My mental vision has been
clarified, my thoughts codified by my
flight. I must fly again with Cody or
BLéRIOT or WRIGHT, but not with THOMAS
WRIGHT.”
Mr. CLEMENT K. SHORTER, who has also
recently made a trip in Mr. Cody's aero-
plane, writes as follows:– -
“When Cody's aeroplane arose
I felt, as you may well suppose,
A tingling feeling in my toes
And at the apex of my nose,
Quite incompatible with prose.
And ever as we higher flew
I sang to Cody of LE QUEUx, -
MAx PEMBERTON and EUGENE SUE,
And other bookmen old and new.
It was, in short, a trip sublime,
And curiously, all the time
My thoughts expressed themselves
in rhyme
Quite faultless in its tuneful chime."
“The 7.15 p.m. train from Dolgelley to Bar-
mouth will continue to run every week-day up
to September 30th instead of up to September
30th as advertised."—The Barmouth Advertiser.
The distinction between, say, “Chip-
pendale” and “Chippendale as adver-
tised" is equally marked.
“In the Furness district adders grow to
an unusual size, from 25in. to 30s. being
apparently the normal development.”—Leeds
Mercury. - -

much as three feet.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Septem-
ber 13. — When NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
found himself enmeshed in his Moscow
campaign, disaster staring him in the
face, he turned to the constitution of the
newly-founded Imperial Opera at Paris
and busied himself with for-
mulating rules for its manage-
ment.
Curious how in varied
fashion, sometimes slavishly,
more often indirectly, history
repeats itself. For fully three
years NAPOLEON B. HALDANE
has been engaged in the work
of re-establishing the British
Army. Not since the days
of CARDWELL–a reformer much
maligned in his time, now on
a pedestal crowned with laurel
by a grateful nation—has the
task been pursued with equal
boldness, originality and suc-
cess. To-night he lightly
takes in hand direction of a
section of the Budget.
Whilst CHANCELLOR of Ex-
CHEQUER rests from his labours
with the Land clauses, and
the PREMIER plumes himself
on having successfully carried
Licensing Duties through Com-
mittee, N. B. H. buckles to the
Death Duties, handling them
with an ease and skill that
could not be exceeded were
they a battalion of Territorials.
Personal sacrifice more
marked by reason of counter-
attraction. Though he sits
on the Treasury Bench listen-
ing to EvelyN CECIL proposing
to barter DON'T KEIR HARDIE's
trousers with the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExCHEQUER in default
of landed estate subject to
Death Duties, his heart is not
here. It is away in the high-
lands by Mergentheim, a-chas-
ing the Red Army or the Blue,
according as he has been
assigned position by the GER-
MAN EMPEROR. Of all the
stirring delights life offers to an
ex-Barrister, there is none
more riotously stirs the blood
of N. B. H. than galloping at the head of
a troop of cavalry, making straight for
the guns of the enemy, with sure know-
ledge that they are not loaded.
Such might have been his privilege at
the War Manoeuvres this week conducted
in Germany under the personal super-
vision of the EMPEROR and our PRESIDENT
OF THE BoARD of TRADE. Duty calls to
the humdrum business of Committee on
the Budget. Instinctively he salutes
and obeys, leaving to WINSTON the privi-
lege (in conjunction with the Imperial
War-Lord) of showing German Generals
and Captains how a campaign should
be successfully conducted.

Tuesday.-Throughout Session the
Ladies' Gallery has been so quiet
Members have almost forgotten its ex-
istence as an integral portion of the
Chamber. No banners suddenly hang
out on its outer walls. No irrelevant
remark announcing the prime ambition
of woman interrupts ordered
speech. No case of unre-
quited affection is disclosed
by discovery of forcible attach-
ment of more or less young
person to unresponsive grille.
State of things made more
noteworthy a sudden unmis-
takable flash of interest that
at particular moment of to-
day's sitting passed through
the group seen, as through a
glass darkly, behind the iron
casement. It happened when
PRINCE ARTHUR interposed in
debate on amendment to
Budget Bill exempting from
operation of second sub-sec-
tion of Clause 42 property
passing between husband and
wife.
“As an individual Member
of the House,” he observed,
“I cannot be accused of per-
sonal interest in this matter.”
Looking shyly across Table
at that other gay young
bachelor, the WAR MINISTER,
he added: “Like the right
hon. gentleman opposite, I
approach it from an absolutely
impartial standpoint.”
Of course mothing new in
condition of affairs indicated.
Every mother in Israel knows
that PRINCE ARTHUR and NAPO-
LEON B. HALDANE are still “on
the market.” But the pointed
reminder came so unexpec-
tedly, dropped so suddenly
on arid waste of discussion
about one per cent. Succession
duty and the like, that it
naturally fluttered the dove-
cote over the Press Gallery.
One day in the last Par-
liament, Cousin HUGH, stroll-
ing down Bond Street, had
his attention drawn to an
article displayed for sale
in a modiste's shop-window. Forget
at the moment what was the occa-
sion or what the argument sought to
be established. Well remember Lord
HUGH standing below the Gangway,
blushing to the roots of his hair, wring-
ing his hands in pitiful embarrassment
as he informed the House that the article
was “what he believed was called a
corset.” Mentioned its price and other
particulars, which indicated that his

l (With grateful acknowledgments to J. Seymour Lucas, R.A.)
study had not been so fleeting as
introductory remark implied. And here
was Cousin ARTHUR, sheltering himself
in the companionship of a celibate on
the Treasury Bench, coming forward as
the champion of married couples harried
by a blood-sucking Chancellor of the
Exchequer. -
“Why,” he cried, in voice vibrating
with indignation, “by the operation of
the Income Tax you fine husband and
wife for living together, and by the
imposition of Estate Duty you fine them
because they do not die together.”
Later, whilst avoiding the picturesque
particularity of Cousin Hugh, PRINCE
ARTHUR enlarged upon the topic of
female dress. Amazing figures had
been given to him setting forth extra-
vagance under this head of domestic
expenditure. -
“I have no means of testing them,”
he added. (SECRETARY of STATE FOR WAR:
“Hear, hear!”)
But he accepted them with full con-
- -
fidence in their accuracy. Under pro-
posal of the Bill executors are required
to act as a Grand Jury and decide
whether during the five years preceding
death of testator expenditure upon
his wife's frocks was justifiable. The
dresses, “and so on,” would have to be
looked over first by the executors and
then by the commissioners.
“It is idiotic,” PRINCE ARTHUR thun-
dered, bringing down on Table resound-
ing blow which happily covered shrill
murmur of approval from Ladies' Gallery.
Unlike majority of speeches delivered,
whether on one side of the House or the
other, this manly outburst had instant
effect. Ch.ANCELLOR of ExCHEQUER capitu-
lated on two important points. Excluded
marriage settlements from range of
Death Duties; reduced from five years
to three the period preceding death
within which gifts shall pay tribute to
the Treasury.
Business done.--Twenty-eighth sitting

Thursday.—“Having, man and boy,
been in the House for nigh forty years,
I am prepared for anything. But never
thought I would live to hear TIM HEALY
denounced by his fellow-countrymen as
a landlord.”
Thus the MEMBER FOR SARK, distractedly
brushing his hair the wrong way.
Event happened on consideration of
report of Irish Land Bill. It was Mr.
FLAVIN who, breaking a silence that has
long eclipsed the gaiety of the House,
levelled the charge. IRISH ATTORNEY-
GENERAL introduced new clause defining
untenanted land. TIM briefly described
it as “botched and discreditable.” John
DiLLON struck the note of indictment by
sarcastically suggesting that opposition
would have come better from the Ulster
landlord camp above the Gangway.
This gave Mr. FLAVIN his cue. TIM
interpolating a remark, he leaped to his
feet and shouted at the top of his voice,
“The hon. Member for North Louth is
fighting to protect his own property in
Kerry.”
A burst of cheering rose from com-
patriots and companions dear among
whom TIM doggedly sits for greater
convenience in the matter of occasionally
sticking pins into them. The House
looked on in amazement. Here was
startling discovery ! That TIM is a
prosperous man, as prosperity goes at
the Irish Bar, everybody knows and of
it most people are glad, recognising the
reward of supreme capacity. But TIM
a landlord, “a sort of " Knight of
Kerry, as Lord HALSBURY would say, gave
pause, and for a while stopped progress
of the Bill.
“Next thing we shall hear,” said
WALTER LONG, visibly dismayed, “is
that TIM has been shot at from behind
a hedge by a tenant evicted from his
Kerry estate. That would be a pic-
turesque and characteristic episode in
the Irish Question.”
Business done.—Irish Land Bill passed

GREAT SCOTTISH INTER-
NATIONAL WEDDING.
GRAND DUCHESS AND ARGENTINE BRIDE-
GROOM.
DAZZLING SCENES.
THE historic burgh of Comrie, in
Perthshire, was one blaze of epithalamic
splendour yesterday for the nuptials of
the Grand Duchess Wolga to Hector
Hirschbergheimer, the Argentine mil-
lionaire, son of the late Melchisedek
Waterbury Hirschbergheimer, of Odessa
and Pittsburg. The town, which, true
to its reputation for seismic activity, had
signalised the occasion by a series of
genial earthquake shocks, was profusely
decorated with bunting, and the streets
were lined from an early hour with
Highlanders, Gauchos, Patagonian
Hussars, and a squadron of the Imperial
Cossacks of the Ukraine, of which the
Grand Duchess is the Honorary Colonel.
The first to arrive at the church for
the ceremony were Lord and Lady Leyds
and the Hon. Marma Leyds, of Inver-
squish, Lord and Lady Skibo, the Bam-
burgher of Bamburgh, Enver Bey of
Loch Enver, Sir Jeroboam Szlumper of
Inchnadamph (wearing the uniform of
the Joppa Fusiliers), Mr. Virgil P.
Boyles, iſis Gulielma Zeltinger, Mr.
Alonzo Kimball, the Hospodar of Wal-
lachia, the Ban of Croatia, Mr. Homer P.
Tonks, Mr. and Mrs. Baddeley Tartan
(of New York), and other representatives
of leading Highland county families.
The bridegroom, a magnificent albino,
clad in the superb magenta uniform of
the Magellan Carabiniers and accom-
panied by his cousin the Bamburgher
of Bamburgh, arrived promptly at noon,
the band of the Black (Waterbury) Watch
playing the national anthem of Tierra
del Fuego as he passed beneath the
sumptuously decorated pergola into the
sacred edifice. On the arrival of the
Grand Duchess, who wore a sumptuous
chinchilla poncho with platinum pom-
poms, and was accompanied by her
brother the Grand Duke Prosper (in
Highland costume), who gave her away,
the band played “The Star-spangled
Banner.” There were no bridesmaids,
but the sermon was preached in Esper-
anto, and after the service the entire
wedding party proceeded to Inversquish
Castle for the wedding breakfast. In
honour of the principals the viands were
specially chosen to illustrate the inter-
national character of the alliance, and
"included maté, pemmican, capercailzie
and sturgeon steaks, while the fountains
ran with vodka until a late hour. The
presents, which numbered more than
a thousand, included three dirigible
balloons, twenty samovars, a complete
set of the works of Gogol, a fine cottage
guanaco, a diamond-hilted chistera, and
postal orders from local admirers.
AT THE PLAY.
- “FALSE GODS.”
I AM afraid that Sir HERBERT TREE has
overrated the magic of M. BRIEUX's name,
and thought that with a little stage
management it could be made to work
miracles, like the statue of Isis. But
because a man can write freshly enough
upon modern questions, such as the
problem of Co-operation or that of
Maternity, it does not follow that he will
have anything but the baldest plati-
tudes to give us when he gets among
the ancients. I speak without know-
ledge of the original and cannot say
how far M. BRIEUX has been Faganised
ºr ryeº per-
The Agnostic to his Love. “It's such waste
of a really nice girl to throw you into the Nile;
and anyhow you’re much too slim to make it
overflow properly.”

by his translator. But if the adapta-
tion is an honest one then I gather that
M. BRIEUX credits himself with having
discovered a brace of bright new truths:
(1) That there must have been agnostics
in most ages; (2) That it is poor work
destroying old creeds unless you can
offer something satisfying in their place.
Well, it doesn't take much genius to
think of things like that. I believe I
could have guessed them both myself,
with my socks down. - -
The trouble came about through a
potter's son (trained for the priesthood)
going on a two-years' tour and getting
his mind broadened. Where he picked
up his agnosticism I can't imagine. At
this period—whatever it was most
other nations were busy with creeds as
crude as his father's. Anyhow, he
returned home and denounced the bestial
gods of his country—and well he might, [.
for they were an ugly-looking lot.
Dead scarabs in his path had no terrors
for him, and the accident of a thunder- |
storm coming at a moment when a
human sacrifice was about to be made
to the Nile brought him the reputation
of miraculous powers.
be a god himself, or in touch with gods
more potent than the local ones. As
poor Mieris pathetically put it (she had
lost her sight and had also apparently
mislaid her sense of humour):—“No- |
thing is impossible to our gods, and his
gods are stronger still.” However, he
conscientiously declines to be a deity,
and indeed will not commit himself to
assert that there is any such thing, not,
at any rate, within range of mortal
advances. He contents himself with a
sort of glorified Socialism, and, if the
“false gods” had only been British
Dukes, he might have been a Budgeteer
after Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE's own heart,
though perhaps a shade too scrupulous.
In the end the old order prevailed,
which should be an encouragement for ||
the Peers.
Talking of politics, Mr. BIRRELL, who
was present on the first might, may have
caught the dear old maxim: “We must
not make martyrs, if we can help it.”
If so, I hope he thought of his Irish |
cattle-drivers. -
Mr. HENRY AINLEY, as Satni, the potter's
son, had practically the only acting part. ||
I never mistook him for an Egyptian,
but I was bound to admire the courage
of his convictions and his masterly
alternations of restraint and expansion. |
But the human interest of the play,
which had its opportunity in the clash
of love and conscience, was never pro-
perly developed. True, there was promise ||
in the scene between Satni and his lover,
the girl who had been chosen by the
god for sacrifice that the Nile might be
persuaded to overflow (Miss EVELYN
D’ALRoy played the part of Yaouma
with a very quiet dignity), but both of
them, the girl especially, were too pre-
occupied with the claims of their respec-
tive creeds to give love a dog's chance.
It was rather sad to see Mrs. PATRICK
CAMPBELL playing a superfluous part in
a sketchy dress that ill became her, and
to hear her wasting her golden voice
over some very tedious pathos with only
here and there a touch of poetry in it.
As for the Actor-manager, he reserved
himself, as High Priest, for the pomps
of the Final Act. His get-up was ad-
mirable, and he had the satisfaction of
making a fool of the Pharaoh, and even
threatened him with the disestablish-
ment of the State. Also, he threw off
some very sound cynicism on the social
advantages to be derived from even the
rottenest hierarchy. But it was not a
great part, and, for what there was of it,

Sir HERBERT, the Actor, had chiefly to
thank Sir BEERBOHM, the Manager.
The minor characters seemed to occupy
a needless amount of our time over
trivialities—such as the repairing of
the broken horn of the hippopotamus-
goddess, or the lesson in the elementary
principles of moral intelligence, though
the last was, no doubt, a necessary part
of the game.
The scenery, with the exception of
the dull foreground of Act III., was very
effective; but the crowds (organised
as admirably as ever) were for the
most part without attraction and never
came near to moving my sympathy, ex-
cept for their ugliness. Indeed, I can-
not think how the Agnostic was ever
induced to set the machinery of the
Isis-miracle in motion out of pity for a
collection of supplicants who were merely
noisy and repellent. Nor did the fre-
quent spectacle of individuals prostrat-
ing themselves with their back view to
the audience contribute greatly to the
| general sum of beauty. O. S.
“THE GREAT DIVIDE.”
There was a large crowd of Americans
and me at the Adelphi to welcome Mr.
WILLIAM WAUGHN Moody's melodramatic
play, The Great Divide. I have had a
warm corner in my heart for Arizona
since first I saw it on the map, and it
was in a Phillip Jordan's cabin in
Southern Arizona that the First Act took
place. When I saw that they all had
six-shooters and brown shirts I knew
that it was correct, but in spite of this
I was very unhappy for the first few
minutes. I couldn't keep up at all. At
last I began to realise that the author
was making desperate efforts to leave
Ruth Jordan alone in the cabin, but
could not get some of the other charac-
ters to go. However, he managed it in
about twelve minutes, and then the fun
began. Entered-three “greasers” (jolly
word)—Dutch, Pedro, and Stephen Ghent.
To save herself from the others, Ruth
offers herself to Stephen, the least
depraved, our Mr. HENRY MILLER no less.
Stephen buys off one of his companions,
shoots the other, and carries off Ruth to
the deputy-sheriff or some such cheese,
who marries them at break of day.
Act II. finds them in Stephen's cabin
in the Corderilla Mountains. I ought
to say that his character had completely
changed at the moment that he first saw
Ruth, and that he is now a kindly and
stoutish mine-owner. So at least he
appears to us (and to himself); but Ruth
cannot forget the drunken greaser who
carried her off. After many words, and
many attempts by Ruth and the author
to explain her mixed feelings, Philli
Jordan, the brother (a man to whom #
took an intense dislike), turns up, and
with the lady's consent takes her home

Wag. “PARDoN ME-1T says ‘Smoke P. P. C., AND THAT 's what I'm Dong.”
to Mrs. Jordan, who lives at Milford
Corners, Mass.
By the time Act III. begins there is
what Stephen calls a “little rooster.”
Ruth has not seen or heard of her
husband, nor has he seen his child. But
there has been a plot by Mrs. Jordan
to bring them together ; and now
Stephen appears in his town clothes
looking more like a fairly bad butler
than anything else. There is one more
attempt at explanations, and Stephen
says a lot of things to her which he
ought to have said before (and one
thing which he ought never to have
said — namely, that all the angels
“working overtime” could not blot out
his sins: a typical American joke at
which the American audience laughed
boisterously). In the end Ruth realises
that she will never explain just how she
feels, and Stephen realises that as long
as he is in his best suit nobody could
possibly love him; and so they start
off together to the Wild West again.
Accompanied by the little rooster.
Miss EDITH WYNNE MATThison was
superb in a ve y difficult part. She
understood the character at least as well
as did Ruth Jordan and Mr. WILLIAM
WAUGHN Moody. Mr. HENRY MILLER I
should like to see in comedy. He has
great gifts of facial expression and a
quiet natural manner, but the “strong
(and stoutish) silent man” is too easy
a part for him. M.

Tilda is indeed the dearest and most nimble of gutter-
snipes. Thoroughly alive to all the charms of the Black
Country, she is not slow to discover that the chief of them is
the romantic ease with which you escape thence into the
fairest fields and pastures of England. Manipulating the
rescue of a sweet boy child from his orphanage prison, she
drifts by canal barge from Wolverhampton-way to Stratford-
on-Avon, glides by canoe to Evesham, rushes by motor to
Tewkesbury, and sails triumphant per SS. Evan Evans to her
island goal, Holmness. In all this she is aided by no tire-
some miracles, but relies only on her shrewd use of the better
nature of chance acquaintances. The pathetic opening of
True Tilda (J. W. ARRowsMITH) is perhaps a little common-

This time we move among the
jerry-built purlieus of Barking, and Mr. Matt Casswade,
professor of bricks and mortar, is the shoddy villain of the
piece. The book is a collection of types associated rather by the
accident of neighbourhood than by any very strong dramatic
relationship. We miss the bright thread of love-romance
that runs through the author's last work, The Borderland;
for the wooing of Selina Shadd by George Baversham is too
cynical to come within that category. But romance was pro-
bably never the dominant feature of this down-river locality,
and Mr. “HALIFAx” knows what he is doing when he confines
himself to its native flora and does not worry about exotics.
He observes sympathetically, and has the power to make
others see what he has seen. The environment of his
characters is naturally rather sombre and colourless, but he
relieves it with many gay touches of humour, not too subtle
for the conditions which provoke them.

to the Signet until—in a gouty moment— he consulted
Professor Cyrus, and started rather precipitately upon what
I need not apologise for calling his backward career. Indeed
the result of the treatment prescribed for him was that he cast
off his years with amazing rapidity, and that his spirits rose
most indecorously as he pursued his wild course down the ages.
A middle-aged widow to whom he had been engaged in his
exemplary days was no longer gay enough for his rejuve-
nated notions; even “a little blow-out in London,” refresh-
ing as it was for the time, could not curb his increasing
youthfulness. We leave him standing first in the batting
averages of a select private school, though he would soon
have to pass preposterously on to a kindergarten establish-
ment or to his cradle. I see that Mr. STORER CLouston has
dedicated his book “to an unknown correspondent who once
made a certain suggestion; ” but if the idea is not Mr.
Clouston's I can nevertheless congratulate him upon the
amusing way in which he has treated it, and upon the sanity
which is to be found in this ſarcical entertainment.
In the uncompromising title of his new novel, Low Society
(CoNSTABLE), “Robert HALIFAx” makes no attempt to mislead
his public. Here is fair notice that we are invited once more
to breathe the uninspiring atmosphere which the author so
lose him. But of course
I knew that there had to be an accident or an illness in Mr.
BENSON's books to make them legal; the copyright expires
unless the hero does, as one might say. Each month has
a chapter to itself—a pretty arrangement, but one which
makes for artificiality. Thus, being quite sure that Helen
didn't really rush around the Continent in that last month |
but one, I could not help remembering that Mr. E. F. BENSoN
was a well-known Greek authority, full of pleasant thoughts
on Athens in spring which would just fill a chapter. Yes,
it is a good chapter, but I think his wife's health should
have come first.

THE MYSTERY SOLVED.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-The explanation of
the KITCHENER-CURzoN coincidence is as
clear as mud. Lord KITCHENER, being
essentially a man of action and not an
orator, applied to his old friend and
colleague, Lord CURZON, to draft him a
speech, and Lord CURZON, unconsciously
reconstituting the scene of his own fare-
well, re-wrote, with very slight varia-
tions, the address which he had himself
delivered on that historic occasion.
Yours truly, -
SPLENDIDE WERAX.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - The practical
identity of Lord KITCHENER's farewell
speech with that of Lord CURZON is, I
think, to be attributed to a rare but not
unprecedented manifestation of dual
personality. Lord KITCHENER, as every-
body knows, was engaged for a long
time in a heated controversy with Lord
CURzoN, in which he ultimately carried
the day, with the result that Lord
CURZON resigned the Viceroyalty. Lo:d
KITCHENER, having thus ousted and
eaten up his antagonist, naturally came
to regard himself as the legitimate
successor to his position and influence
and by a natural transition to his
entire mentality. This absorption in-
volved the appropriation of his thoughts
and general outlook, and so his farewell
banquet induced him to repeat the
specch of his vanquished rival.
Yours faithfully,
RECORDATOR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I was discussing the
strange episode of the KITCHENER-CURZON
speeches this afternoon with my friend
that inveterate punster, Mr. OSCAR BAL-
THASAR MoUAT. “The speeches are cer-
tainly curiously similar,” I observed.
“Naturally,” retorted the inveterate pun-
ster, “because they were both Simla
(similar) orations.” Thinking that this
was too good to be lost, I at once took a
note of the witticism, which I place un-
reservedly at your disposal.
- Very truly yours,
ALGERNON ASHTON.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, -No one has yet
suggested the most satisfactory and
convincing explanation of this puzzling
affair of the KITCHENER-CURzoN speechcs.
Lord KITCHENER, it will be remembered,
was embroiled in an acute controversy
with Lord CURzoN, but being one of the
most gentle and kind-hearted of men, he
conceived the charming if somewhat
Quixotic plan of burying the hatchet by
confessing himself unable to better the
oratory of his antagonist. A more
magnanimous compliment could not be
imagined, but unfortunately its subtlety
has defeated its aim.
Yours faithfully,
A SUFFolk J.P.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-The explanation of
the similarity between Lord CURzoN's
remarks and Lord KITCHENER's is sim-
plicity itself. They both employ the
same tired speech-writer.
Yours, etc., SLEUTH.

WHERE the purple gloom of heather,
Where the golden stars of gorse
Twine and twist their roots together,
Let me linger and endorse
Praises of the moorland stretching
Into vistas faint and fetching,
Praises that the guide-book uttered of
this pretty nine-hole course.
By this tor, a famous beacon,
Once, no doubt, were British huts;
Places that you ground your cleek on
(Full of tantalising ruts)
Saw the minstrel Druids gather,
Solemn men with beards like lather,
Witless that in time their temples
would provoke a Saxon’s “Tuts.”
There to leftward lies the ocean,
Shining as a silver pall,
Moving with its magic motion
Onward till the breakers fall,
Onward till the foam-flake splashes
O'er the sea-weed, like my mashies
Tumbling on to greens where TAYLOR
could not stop the berserk ball.
Right, you have the moorland swelling,
Mile on mile, with countless kinks,
Mother of the streamlets welling
Into vales where Ceres winks,
Where the natives murmur “Thiccy.”
And their tongue is soft and tricky
As this mass of vegetation which they
choose to term a links.
Stalwart men on tiny ponies,
You shall see them in the dale,
See them draining with their cronies
Mugs of cider and of ale.
Slack they seem and pleasant spoken, -
Doubtless, though, their hearts are oaken,
Witness my undaunted caddy search-
ing on a tee-shot's trail.
Ah, but now the shadows darken,
Hushed the fairy-haunted scene,
Beauteous land of Devon, hearken'
Help me, as with some chagrin,
By the souls of seadogs beckoned
I prepare to play my second
Out of this enchanted fern-tuft, to the
faith-envisaged green.

WE are very glad to be able to supple-
ment the somewhat meagre account of
the recent meeting of the Atlantic Union
which has appeared in The Westminster
Gazette, with a further record of the
impressions of our English-speaking
guests.
Professor Elihu Lick, of the University
of Tipperusalem, solemnly adjured his
hearers to keep the well of English pure
and undefiled. “You have,” he said,
“too many dialects,” in particular specify-
ing those of Bayswater, Hindhead, Oxford
and Whitechapel. Even at Harridge's
Stores he had heard several words mis-
pronounced, notably “coffee,” “salt,”
“surreptitious" and “aerated.”
Mr. Slingsby Timrod, a ruddy Wam-
couverian, summarised his impressions
as hereunder:—
FAvot RABLE. UNFAvourabLE.
Girth of policemen. Language of golf
Beauty of sandwich- players.
Inell. Tyrolese hats.
Herefordshire cider. The tabloid habit.
Mr. Victor Slumper, a Rhodes Scholar
from Woolloomoolloo, was painfully
struck by the increased consumption of
China tea in good society and the rage
for Pekinese dogs, and he quoted with
great effect TENNYSON's line:
“Better fifty peers of Europe than a title of
Cathay.”
Dr. Wilſord Harbottle, of St. Helena,
stated that he was somewhat bewildered
by a multiplicity of impressions, but
perhaps the most striking was that ||
created by the appearance of Mr. Corri-
dor Abel, the famous novelist. From
reading his books Dr. Harbottle was led
to suppose that he was at least seven
feet high, instead of which he was of
ſrail physique and weighed only 9 stone
3 lbs. -
Archdeacon Mangles, of the Falkland
Islands, was chiefly impressed by the
penetrating voices of the newspaper
boys, which reminded him of the cries
of the sea-birds at home, and the sump-
tuous luxury of the National Liberal
Club.
Miss Wilburina Spacker, of Ithaca,
Va., speaking in fluent Esperanto, de-
plored the lack of skyscrapers, rapid
elevators and quick lunches.
Mr. Hiram Pimblott, of Philadelphia,
expressed his astonishment at the gentle-
mess and sleekness of the police.
Besides the other performers already
mentioned who diversified the entertain-
ment by their performances, mention
should be made of Miss Rotorua Vampa,
who sang Maori war-songs to the accom-
paniment of the nasi-flauto, Dr. and Mrs.
Cyrus Shyster, plunkophone duettists,
and Sig. Onoto Pennini, who gave his
celebrated farmyard imitations.

SHADOWS FROM THE PAST.
THE DANISII STEELYARD.
It is a long time since I first met him—thirty-five years
ago, to be strictly accurate—and our acquaintance lasted only
some eight weeks. In that short period I got to know him
intimately, learnt, I suppose, to appreciate all his sterling
necessary qualities, interfused him, so to speak, in the
substance of my mind, passed an incredibly futile examina-
tion which contained him—and then dismissed him into
blind forgetfulness. Indeed, I have hardly thought of him
again until to-day.
Perhaps I ought to ask pardon for speaking of the Danish
Steelyard as a person. I plead that it is more picturesque
to say “he” and “him " than to keep on with a reiteration
of “it,” and besides I have absolutely and entirely forgotten
what he was or why he was, or for what reason I was
compelled to study his characteristics. In the place in which
I am writing there are at my service innumerable books of
reference, and in a few moments I could grind up and com-
municate all the knowledge that ever existed about all the
Danish Steelyards that were ever created, but I prefer to
remain as I am. Thus I am not tied down to a possibly
hideous actuality; if I like I can summon an ideal D. S. to
my mind; I can picture him as a cosmic force, a beautiful
illusion of youth, a knitter of friendships, a comforter in
affliction, a thousand happy and transitory things out of
which dreams and high ambitions were once fashioned. No,
I shall not renew my once intimate knowledge of the
Danish Steelyard.
It was in Trinity College, Cambridge, that he first swam
into my ken on an October morning. Nine o'clock was but
a minute off. A thin mist lay lightly over the Old Court, and a
pale sun was faintly struggling through. The cook's porters,
white-robed and balancing blue kitchen-boxes on their heads,
were making their way to the rooms of the haughty second
and third-year men who were about to breakfast. We were
freshmen, a large bunch, in all our new glory of caps and
gowns, and we were gathered together for a 9 o'clock lecture.
Directly aſterwards 9 o'clock began to strike, and we trooped
into the lecture-room.
Somehow, as I think of this throng, I invest it with the
weary splendours of the present as well as with the glamour
of the past. That youngster with the brown skin and the
flashing dark eyes of a Spaniard is the Judge of a County
Court. He is styled “your Honour,” and yet at other times
it seems that men call him “Black Jim,” to distinguish him
from “Scholar Jim,” who is a Headmaster and a mighty
player of Rugby football. Another Headmaster is there, too,
a bluff, downright fellow with a straight clear look in his
eyes. I can see him also, and his brother, at Lord's on a
July day, and the brother merges into a Right Honourable
front-bencher. And there are barristers and parsons not a
few ; and a Governor of the Bank of England slaps me on
the back; and a shy, pink-cheeked family solicitor from
Gloucester-hire takes his seat next me. A silent man moves
about pricking off our names on a sheet of paper. He never
asks even a freshman's name: he knows it by instinct.
Then the lecturer begins to talk to us, and suddenly he
mentions the Danish Steelyard.
. I believe the D. S. had a humble relation who was generally
spoken of as the Common Steelyard. I have a vague motion
that there was something British about the Common Steel-
yard, something that distinguished him to his advantage
from the alien adventurer who was foisted upon us at this
early stage of our Cambridge career; but I am no more sure
about him than I am about the other. I half think, now
that I bend my mind to it, that he was slightly less com:
plicated; that he was a sort of take-me-or-leave-me Steelyard
with no special pretensions, while the Dane was arrogant and
insisted on his own surpassing merits. This, however, is the
mere shadow of a shade of a recollection.
There, at any rate, I must let the matter rest, for it is
strange that when, as now, I think of the D. S. I straightway
forget him, and remember only the vanished magic of this
delightful world—youth, high spirits, vigour and friendship ;
the grey courts and rugged towers of the College; the hazy
commons, the beat of eight oars in unison—all that made
life a joy thirty-five years ago. And I know that when, a
century hence, some careful investigator affects to paint the
manners and describe the feelings of our time and the causes
of them, he will remember all the unessential things, but he
will forget to mention the Danish Steelyard.
THE LAST STRAW.
[The chameleons at the Zoo are reported to be in a bad way. Their
sole food, it appears, is the greenſly, or blight, and this year the roses
in the Zoological Gardens (and the poet's backyard) have been singularly
free from this affliction.]
FULL oft I voiced the loud and impious cuss,
With visage growing glum and ever glummer,
Over the totally ridiculous
Vagaries of this recent English summer,
Wherein I burned my Yuletide log in June
(A jolly sight too soon).
And yet one consolation came to me,
My fur-lined coat at least was decked with posies,
And I grew glad at heart again to see
The perfect health of my small patch of roses.
I counted it a bit of real all right
To find them free from blight.
They did not go to swell an insect's tum,
Falling (if roses can) as dead as mutton;
Not mine to mourn at seeing them become
A summer banquet for a greenfly glutton.
No, they were healthy, fragrant, fresh and sweet,
In fact, a fair old treat.
But now no sort of solace can I win;
My sympathetic eyes must fain weep freely on
Learning this present season's shortage in
The commissariat of the poor chameleon,
A rummy little brute, who makes, ’tis said,
Greenſly his daily bread.
Bare platters at the little lizard's meals
Leave no good point remaining with the weather,
And there is nothing more to do, one feels,
But cuss it once again—this time together.
So come, chameleons, let your voices go;
When I count three, say, “Blow !”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BUDGET A.B.C.
[AUTHOR's NoTE.—This is meant as a handy
guide for all decent people who still respect
the Church, the Empire, Family Life, our Old
Nobility, and Sir SPENCER MARYon-Wilson,
Bart. (The order of the foregoing is merely
alphabetical). In the Great Struggle which is
approaching between Order and Chaos, Free-
dom and Slavery, Tariff Reform and Socialism,
such ammunition as this cannot fail to be use-
ful. (In pamphlet form, 5s. per 1,000)]
Alligators.
The connection between the humble
Saurian and the tyrannical LLOYD-GEORGE
may not be apparent at first sight; but
it is obvious that the more our rich men
are taxed the less money they will have
for spending abroad on the banks of the
Amazon. Tariff Reform, therefore,
means free food for alligators; Socialism
means the decay of family life amongst
our larger reptilia.
Tariff Reform means more gaiters for
alligators.-(ADvT)
: Balfour.
The policy which our great leader first
announced in 1903, and has advocated
untiringly ever since, is Tariff Reform.
What is Tariff Reform 2 (Loud and pro-
longed Cheers, and a Voice, “Shame!”)
We shall come to that later on.
Tariff Reform means Full Speed Ahead.
(ADvT.)
Correspondence.
There are only two ways of writing
letters just now. The first begins,
“DEAR SIR BARONET, I humbly venture
to enclose my little account,” and ends
with a respectful reference to the weather.
The second is more important, and must
be given in full:
990, Grosvenor Square, W.
The Castle, Perthshire.
Broadlands, nr. Evershot.
Llwynpucllgch, Dolgelly, Wales.
Thomas Towers, Leicester.
S.Y. Araminta,
(* Strike out five of these.)
DEAR SIR,--I much regret that owing
to the increased taxation imposed by the
Budget (which I shall never pay, as it
is certain to be thrown out by the
Lords) I am compelled to economise at
somebody's expense, and that therefore
I shall be unable to renew my subscrip-
tion to your Children's Holiday Fund.
You may also miss the beef at Christmas.
Yours regretfully, MIDDLESEx.
(Including most of the Embankment.)
P.S.—I am sending a copy of this
letter to the Press—all except the bit
about the Lords.
Tariff Reform means Beef at Christmas.
(ADvT).
Dukes.
(Hats off, please.)
I want you to follow me very carefully
here, because the position of the Duke
is often misunderstood by tactless persons.
Suppose that a Duke receives £200,000
a-year for his services to the country.
Now, at first sight, that seems a lot of
money, and hasty people say, “Oh, we
must tax this man heavily, he is so rich.”
But let us pause and reflect a moment.
What does he do with this money? He
doesn't bury it or drop it down a well.
No, he spends it; and by spending it
he gives employment to the poor people
of England whom we are all so sorry
for. Suppose you take away £10,000 from
our Duke in taxes. What is the result?
Why, he spends £10,000 less 1 That is
to say, the poor working people lose
£10,000 worth of employment. So that
in trying to tax a Duke you are really
robbing the widow and the orphan,
besides hurting the feelings of a wise
and kindly legislator'
Tariff Reform means Happier Dukes.
(ADvT)
Employment.
This is really a continuation of my
last paragraph, only I thought you might
like to put your hatson again. Roughly
speaking, the nation may be divided into
Employers and Employed. (And, under
this beastly Government, Unemployed.)
Now I have already shown the iniquity of
putting these extra taxes on to the very
men who create employment, and of
course the same argument applies to
all the old taxes. That is to say, no
Employer ought to pay any kind of tax.
Who should, then? for we must have
a Navy (see small bills). Why, the
Employed, of course; in other words,
the working man! Surely you see that ?
Tariff Reform means Common Sense.
(ADvT)
Fiscal Reform.
This is simply another name for
Tariff Reform, which is the only alter-
native to this Socialistic Budget. Other
names for Tariff Reform are “Protec-
tion ” and “Free Trade.”
Tariff Reform means ELLIS BARKER.
(ADvT.)
Foreigner (The).
(Shame!)
We are raising this year some
hundreds of millions in taxes. The
money is spent in carrying on the work
of the country, in policing our streets
and in defending our shores. Who pays
these taxes? You and Il LLOYD-GEORGE
makes us pay them! And this is called
“The People's Budget.” . Now the
alternative to this Budget is Tariff
Reform; and what does Tariff Reform
mean? It means making the foreigner
pay! It means making Germany pay
for our Navy | Supposing you had a
wife and two pretty children, wouldn't
you hate having to work for them?
Wouldn't you much rather that some-
body else—the man that lived opposite
whom you disliked so—supported them
for you? Of course you would ! And in
the same way every patriotic Englishman
detests the idea of paying for his own
ships and men, and looks about for some ||
way of making Germany do it.
| Tariff Reform means making Germany
pay for our Navy.—(ADvT)
George, Lloyd-.
Let us never forget in mentioning ||
this person that ours is the “gentlemanly
party.” Our references to the little Welsh
attorney who was educated in a Board
School must therefore be moderate.
“Thief, Traitor, and Foul-mouthed Tub-
thumper” is perhaps as far as we may
go with propriety.
Tariff Reform means more gentlemen.
(ADvT.
Lords (The).
It is now practically certain that
the Lords will do something; The
Daily Express (Unionist), The West-
minster Gazette (Radical), and The Times
(Independent) are all agreed upon this.
The probability is that they will insist
upon a general election, call for the
resignation of Mr. CHURCHILL, disfranchise
the working man, and abolish the safety
miss at billiards. In such a course they
would be supported by the whole country.
Tariff Reform means Lord BLUMENFELD.
(ADvT)
Property.
If this Budget is allowed to become
law there will be no such thing as
property. Your little patch of garden
will be wrested from you. You may be
in the middle of a game of croquet—
actually in position for the third hoop—
but that will not deter LLoyd-GEORGE.
One of his hirelings will come and take
the lawn away from you; as likely as
mot, he will pinch the mallets too.
Tariff Reform means croquet for all.
(ADvT.)
Socialism.
Socialism means— .
I. (actually) The nationalisation of
the means of production and
distribution ;
II. (roughly) Atheism, Free Love, and
Death to EDWARD THE SEVENTH;
III. (for the moment) Anything in
the Budget.
Tariff Reform means God Sace the King.
(ADvT.)
Tariff Reform.
After the lucid explanations of my
advertisement manager it is hardly neces-
sary for me to speak at any length about
Tariff Reform. But in a general way
it may be said that Tariff Reform means
what the other side say the Budget
means, only more of it (or less of it, as
the case may be).
Tariff Reform also means ELLIS BARRER.
(ADVI.)
Zinc.
And so I arrive at Z. It is now
generally admitted by all moderate
thinkers that the Budget will ruin the
Zinc Trade. Tariff Reform would estab-
lish it for ever. Englishmen, for which
will you vote? - A. A. M.

LE CHIEN TERRIBLE.
[To A YOUNG-OLD RETRIEVER.]
No, Rupert, mo: the glory has dispersed
The sweet impression (and the muddy
splash)
You left upon me when I met you first
And faintly called you “Dash.”
Flattered, I thought, “He knows an
honest face; ”
But riper friendship has betrayed how
cheap
Your adulations were, and dulled their
grace:—
Get down, you dingy sweep !
All canine humour may be overdone:
My gloves were meant to wear, I want
my hat:
More, there are moments when it wearies
One
To improvise a rat.
(The cosmic verities are rarely gained,
But none the less I differ from your
view
That earth's phenomena may be ex-
plained
By boning them to chew.)
Yon slipper doubtless was a work of art
Before your earnest fangs revealed its
woof:
Nor should the soundness of a golf-ball's
heart
Be shown by dental proof.
Yes, you have splendid teeth, and must
have made, -
While young ambitions yet were un-
deterred,
The most distracting tyro of your trade
That ever mouthed a bird.
Those, and a very tidy turn of speed,
Topped by a bell-mouthed bay of
blood-hound tone,
Give you the finest points of every breed
(Barring, of course, your own).
But even genius is apt to tire
When so assertive, and so prone to
range
Regardless through the fouler sorts of
mire—
Besides, you have the mange.
I shall not wrestle for that chunk of
W y
I shall not hurl you boulders any
more;
The nameless glamour of your puppy-
hood,
Take it from me, is o'er.
Go and amuse yourself with village
fights,
Or, if you lean to some less active bout,
Proclaim a pogrom of your parasites;
But not in here! Get out.

HEROIC MEASURES.
ADVANCES IN Homoeopathy.
(By our Medical Adviser.)
[The cure of rheumatism by bee-stings was
demonstrated at the Exhibition of the Surrey
Bee-Keepers' Association.]
MEDICAL men are showing great interest
in the new red-hot-poker treatment for
stuttering. The poker is applied freely
to various parts of the body until it
fizzles. The treatment is useless if anaes-
thetics are employed, but it may be dis-
continued, if the patient is in a weak
state or elderly, as soon as he becomes
incoherent and the eyeballs protrude.
The mad-bull cure for acute sciatica
is a theory lately advanced by a German
investigator, and is based on the sup-
position (not so far endorsed by any
sufferers) that the complaint is purely
nervous and therefore imaginary. The
subject is placed in a large field con-
taining from three to five insane bulls
with highly-pointed horns, and is recom-
mended to run for the nearest hedge at
a speed of from twenty to thirty miles
per hour, regardless of pain. Owing to
an unaccountable difficulty in procuring
patients, experiments are for the present
confined exclusively to reformatories and
convict stations.
An open-air sanatorium for sufferers
from asthma is being erected at the
South Pole. Invalids, wearing only a
kilt, winter and summer, will bathe for
half-an-hour twice a day until their
temperatures fall below zero. They
sleep on icebergs. Before retiring for
the night the feet are placed in salted
water until raw and then singed, jump-
ing being generally indulged in during
this exercise. The diet prescribed is
a simple one of half-a-pound of cold
mutton and two drachms of soda-
water per diem. Over-heating should
be avoided.
Other remedies under examination by
the faculty are the bull-dog treatment
(for nervous diseases in children), the
Australian wild cat, and the ants' nest
one-night-cure.

AN EARLY BIRD.

“WELL–- It is out of The EGG – You 'RE RIGHT so FAR 1" -
TO A MICHAELMAS GOOSE.
[“But fill me with the old familiar goose,
- Methinks I might recover by-and-by.")
Not of thy feats of war, intrepid bird,
Sing I; as when the slumbering Romans heard
From their steep citadel the clarien call
That bade them rise and bang the stealthy Gaul.
Not of the cloth-yard shaft, goose-winged to slay
The caitiff as he legged it from the fray,
What time the haughty Frenchman lived to feel
The Free Companion's death-compelling steel,
Or punctured his invaluable pelt on
The point of a Sir Nigel or a Shelton.
Not mine to praise thine intellect, or glean
Tales of that Nestor of the village green,
Whose sage “Ga! Ga!” for o'er a hundred years
Moved an attentive neighbourhood to tears. -
And those seven glaucous gluttons who (one reads)
Flew o'er seven virid and herbaceous meads;
Not mine to tell their travels, or to hymn
All the wise geese of ANTERSEN and GRIMM.
Rather thy minstrel I, majestic goose,
As thou appearest in domestic use;
When plump with sage and roasted to a T,
Men dish thee up ; and I regretfully
Pass by the fish that I may have more room for thee.
Oh, when, a youth, I used to stuff and stuff,
Yet never felt as if I'd had enough;
When nothing eatable about the place
Got by my indefatigable face; -
Well I recall how on Saint Michael's day
Proud relatives would summon me from play,
And weigh me thoughtfully, ere they turned me loose,
And watched me forge my way into the goose. -
I was a sickly lad and rather thin,
And people wondered how I crammed it in,
Nor ever guessed the heroic strength of mind
With which a seventh helping was declined.
Ay, and though multiplying lustres cause
A certain inanition in the jaws,
And appetite's inexorable term is
Set by an inelastic epidermis,
I still achieve the old familiar thrill
When I observe “Roast Goose” upon the bill,
And letting out my belt go to it with a will.
Once at a country fair I saw engage
The champion eater of the vicinage.
Three legs of mutton and a keg of ale
Vanished like chaff before the autumn gale;
Twelve pounds of cheese and fourteen apple pies
Were blotted out before our dazzled eyes.
And “Oh,” I cried, “how gladly would I give
The futile ends for which my fellows live;
Success in science, letters or the law,
For that sublime, incomparable maw
Love might elude me, Fortune pass me by,
Unknown to fame I’d gladly live and die,
Had I that power to eat without surcease,
And cash enough to buy a flock of geese!"

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Exth ACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Septem-
ber 20. —Everyone has heard of the

of a generous meal, pressed on his
acceptance a stale Bath bun. CAPTAIN
CRAIG furtively thrust into his hand a
briarwood pipe. He repelled both
painful scene that took place in Com- advances.
mittee Room C last Friday. Standing
Committee at work on Development Bill.
CHANCELLOR OF ExCHEQUER, having (se-
cretly) breakfasted late, opposed usual
interval for light luncheon refreshment.
At 2.45 Robert CECIL, who though
transcendental by nature is of
a frugal mind, rang bell for |
restaurant waiter. Result of -
interview disclosed when ten .
minutes later the Minion
brought in tray and set it
before the noble Freefooder. |
Napkin removed, behold one
of those shilling meals which
serve to keep green the me-
mory of our dear ALFRED
JACOBY, longtime Chairman of
Kitchen Committee.
As Lord RobFRT sipped his
| turtle soup, toyed with his |
Zephir de Ris de Veau, lin- -
gered over his ortolan, bat-
tened on his Banbury cake—
what irony there was in the
appearance on the scene of
the familiar delicacy — his
colleagues eyed him askance.
Captain CRAIG tightened his
belt. Finding it made no
impression on his figure, he
produced a short briar pipe,
filled, lit, and smoked it.
FREDERICK BANBURY, 1st Bart.,
sat proudly aloof. Some might
eat, others smoke; he would
starve. Happy thought sug-
gested by example of Suffra-
gettes battling with myrmi-
dons of the law. Denying
themselves food, they were
released lest worse things
should happen. What woman
could do, BANBURY would.
Straightway resolved to take
no food as long as Committee
on Development Bill sit up-
stairs on days when Finance
Bill is to the fore in the
House.
Shortly after Questions opened to-day,
the tragedy was brought home to Mem-
bers. Leaning on arm of sympathetic
Messenger the Baronet entered by glass
door; was led as far as Bar. There-
after, on his way to his seat above Gang-
way, he must needs go unassisted. Would
he be able to do it? Pulling himself
together, he struggled on. Spirit tri-
umphed over flesh, of which latter, truth
to tell, scarcely any remained worth
speaking of. Not a dry eye in crowded
House. Murmur of cheers greeted his
slow arrival in safety to his seat. Bob
Awaiting opportunity whilst PREMIER
was catechised, he enquired whether,
“if the right hon. gentleman intends to
compel us to sit all day and all night,
he will also compel the CHANCELLOR of
THE EXCHEQUER to be present?”
The MAN WITH THE PIPE.
(The Sir Walter Raleigh of the Committee Rooms, Captain Craig,
M.P. for East Down.)
There the rub. Bad enough to be
kept-in starving. To know that absent
ChaNCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER is enjoying
the privacy and privileges of his room,
gorging himself with leek prepared in
various forms in the way of concessions
on the Budget Bill, is more than human
nature can stand.
FitzALAN HoPE crystallised scene and
story in a question addressed to PREMIER.
“If,” he asked, “any Member of the
Committee dies in the course of the pro-
ceedings, will he be accorded a public
funeral?”
The PREMIER, averting his glance from
BANBURY, but fearing the worst, declined
to give any pledge.
Business done.-Dealt with Income
Tax clauses of Budget Bill.
House of Lords, Tuesday.—The Earl
of CREWE rules but does not govern.
Nominally Leader of the House, actually
representative of the strongest Govern-
ment of modern times, he is as wax in
the fingers of Lord LANSDowne. The
Marquis does his squeezing gently.
Effect all the same. The Earl
proposes, the Marquis dis-
poses. Omnipotent in the
other House, His Majesty's
Government have not much
more influence over direction
of affairs coming before Lords
than have the policemen in
| the passages or the messen-
gers at the door.
Droll situation forcibly illus-
trated to-day. Housing and
- Town Planning Bill in Com-
mittee. On second reading
it met with reception that
seemed to give glowing pro-
mise of triumphal progress.
|
Criticism of noble lords on
Opposition side chiefly con-
fined to regret not unmingled
with resentment that a mea-
sure admirably calculated to
promote the symmetry of big
towns and the welfare of their
inhabitants had not been
brought in earlier.
Hadn't been in Committee
five minutes when bang
went important provision of
Clause 2.
Great occasion for CAMPER-
| Down. Gripped it with that
dogged tenacity that distin-
guishes him as Convenor of
Forfarshire. Ponderous, prag-
- matical, pertinacious, he (using
the phrase in a Parliamentary
sense) butted CREWE aside.
Leader of the House had taken
| precaution of setting up BEAU-
CHAMP as buffer between him
and movers of what he plain-
tively described as “a series
of amendments which it is in
the power of your Lordships to carry
and which fill the mind of the Govern-
ment with dread and alarm.”
After first division, in which Ministers
mustered only 30 against 112, CAMPER-
Down returned to attack with fresh
strategy. Moved to insert new sub-
section to Clause 2. It ran to exactly
two hundred words ! Breathlessly re-
cited as a sentence, with no interval of
rest save an occasional comma and two
semicolons. Noble lords gasped. What
it meant or might portend, who should
say?

LONDON CHARIVARI.
“As WAY IN THE FINGERs of Lord LANSDOWNE.”
(Lord Crewe.)
There stood the Convener of Forfar-
shire, grim, implacable. Doubtless he
knew what it meant. Study of its bear-
ings was kind of intellectual rhapsody
occasionally permitted himself amid
the more serious avocations of arid life.
CREWE's gallant spirit quailed. Accus-
tomed to face hopeless odds, he invari-
ably makes show of fight. This stupen-
dous sub- estion, with its “but if's,” its
“ and if's,” its “unlesses,” and its “or
other circumstances,” too much for
him. As for BEAUCHAMP, he collapsed
before the sanctuary of the first semi-
colon was reached. When the Lord
CHANCELLOR-whose wig slowly, without
touch of visible force, got hopelessly
awry as the sub-section was read—put
the question, Ministers sat mute;
CAMPERDOWN's amendment agreed to
without division.
: In a sitting that lasted up to midnight,
only one other division taken. It re-
corded the presence of twenty-four
Ministerialists. Where were the odd
six? CREWE, looking anxiously round,
concluded they had succumbed to weight
of the sub-section. Paper still crowded
with amendments. If he challenged
further division, his minority would alto-
gether disappear. So he meekly bowed
his head to the storm, and the Opposition
mercilessly remodelled the Bill.
Business done.—Town Planning Bill
in Committee.
House of Commons, Thursday.—Light
incidentally flashed on pampered condi-
tion of Territorials. ORATOR HUNT held
the candle. Wanted to know if it is
true that during the camping-out of the
Gordon Territorials at Aultmore the
men were accustomed to shave in
lemonade?
No one doubts the courage of NAPOLEON
B. HALDANE. Notable that on this occa-
sion he found it desirable to be engaged
elsewhere. Shaving in lemonade is a
small, to some people an unaccountable,
foible. Why a man should hanker after
lemonade as a solvent for his bar of
shaving soap is one of those things not
easy to understand. Next he'll be ask-
ing for ginger-beer, on field-days for
champagne.
In WAR MINISTER’s absence, ACLAND,
mildest-mannered man that ever faced
an infuriate economist, put up to reply.
Took refuge in ignorance. Never heard
of the lemonade fantasy. Probably inci-
dent result of personal taste and posses-
sion of private means. Certainly there
was no record that in addition to super-
tax, increase of 2d. in the pound income-
tax, and other severities of the Budget,
the British tax-payer is mulct in charges
for lemonade served out to the Terri-
torials at shaving time.
ORATOR HUNT desired to continue the
conversation. Glancing at the SPEAKER,
who this week has developed welcome
stringency with regard to the plague of
supplementary questions, he resumed
his seat, contenting himself at intervals
with vocal imitations of the popping of
corks of lemonade bottles.
Business dome.—Budget Bill in Com-
mittee. Major CoATES illumines dull
debate by “viewing the Stamp Duties
from point of view of a business man,
not a politician.” This innovation proved
instant success. ORATOR HUNT has “a
talk about Tea.”

WIGGY AND THE FARES.
WIGGY was more than usually talkative
to-night after he had set me down and
I had, as usual, grossly overpaid him.
“Lord love me, Sir,” he said, with the
Londoner's elision, “if everyone was like
you what a pleasure cab-driving would
be. But there, they ain't. Only this
morning I had two old ladies to drive
from the Grand Hotel to the Natural
History Museum and back again. They
took me for an hour, and they got back
exactly to the minute. What do you
think they gave me? Half-a-crown.”
“But that's the fare,” I said; “one
hour, half-a-crown. They probably were
strangers to London, and, having read it
in the regulations, thought it was the
proper amount.”
“Right you are, Sir,” said Wiggy. “I
thought something was up on the way
back, and I opened the trap-door and
catched them breaking their necks try-
ing to read the table. So I was pre-
pared for the worst. But what part of
England do you suppose people come
from where they don't give a cabman a
penny for himself?” -
He paused to gather fresh impetus.
“Do you think they'd treat a taxi-
driver like that? Not arf. Look at
those shovers! They never say a civil
word to anyone, but who dares ask one
for any change out of a bob, even if
there's only eightpence on the clock?
Oo? No one.” –
Wiggy leaned down to bring his head
closer to mine. “What is it about those
shovers,” he asked mysteriously, “that
makes them so different from us? Why
are people so frightened of them ’’’
I murmured something about machin-
ery, unknown forces, and so forth.
“Yes, I daresay that's part of it; but
do you suppose if I was to learn to
shove,” said Wiggy, “anyone would be
afraid of me? Nar! It's more than
that. Smoke cigarettes, too, all the
time, and has more meals in a day than
I get in a week, and passes on the
wrong side. I dunno what London's
coming to.”
Wiggy shook his head tragically.
“You don't mind me talking, I hope,”
he said. “It isn't costing anything, you
know—not like talking to a taxi, what's
going on all the time!”
I laughed.
“But that's not all about those two
old ladies,” Wiggy resumed. “What
do you think they did? They didn't
give me the half-crown themselves;
they nipped indoors and sent it out by
the porter. There's lots of different
kinds of meanness in fares—there's the
people who are ‘so sorry they haven't
got any coppers; ' there are the people
who think that giving the driver an old
newspaper is enough to make him their
slave; there are the people what pat your
lorse and ask questions about it, and
then offer a bare bob ; but of all the
mean tricks getting the porter to pay
you is the worst. That's mean twice
over: because, to begin with, it's mean,
just mean ; and secondly there's the
porter's meanness, too, in not sticking
up for the cabman and telling the people
that the fare by itself's not enough.
That's what I complain of. Why
couldn't old brass-bound have said to
the ladies that in London we give a tip
as well as the fare, especially when we
fill up the blooming hour to the tick?
He's a working man, just like me, and
in fact feeds on tips. But no, he just
hands it to me, and says the ladies give
it him for me for an hour's hire, and off
he goes back to his armchair and Daily
Mail.”
Wiggy sighed.
“Fancy giving a man an hour's fare
for an hour's hire ' " he concluded.
“England's breaking up ; that's what
I say.”

I ALWAYS used to read those little books
with a clear conscience. They were
given to me only on a Sunday following
an unblemished week. I am proud to

I remember, was always called Willie–
while the dreadful youth, who went on
the river on Sunday after robbing the
poor little birds of their eggs, was always

enemy called George, but I preferred
to believe that it was the finger of Fate.
I, who prided myself upon being a model

less, vulgar boy – bore the name of
George! I used to pass the little books
on to him (after I had committed

he roared. “Smoker!”
The guard whistled and the train
jerked forward. In an instant I was out
on the platform. “Madam,” I said with
a running bow, as I hoisted her into my
carriage, “there is room here.” The
guard helped me in.
“Did you hear what he said?” I in-
quired anxiously.
“No. What was it?”
I retired hastily behind my paper.
He tossed the paper from him as I
stooped to pick up my piece of toast.
I scraped some pieces of carpet off the
buttered side before replying. -
“I expected it,” I said. “It is page
seven.”
“If I could only hang on for the
rise!” he exclaimed. “Pity you can't
lend me a few thousand for a week,
Willie.”
“I am a poor man, at present,” I said,
“but in any case I could not bring
myself to aid and abet in a gambling
transaction. Do you remember that
moral in one of the little books about
the punishment of vice?” -
George made no reply. There could
be no reply. He savagely tore open an
envelope that lay by his plate. “Law-

boy, I pointed out to him, seemed
to have the better time for the
first six pages of the book, but
Willie always secured the lion's
share of total benefits at page
seven. So hardened, however,
was his conscience that he used to
roar with laughter over George's
untimely fate, and was even
moved to merriment by the excel-
lent moral that was printed in-
side the cover. Finally I gave up
all hope of doing him good. I
left him to go his own wicked
way and shunned his society.

I gave the porter his twopence with a

selfish to give up his first-class smoker,

Moreover I do not consider it right to
travel first-class with a third-class ticket.
The first paragraph I read described
how a youth mamed William had assisted
a lady in distress, and five years later
had been left a fortune by his grateful
fellow-passenger. I put down the paper
again. -
“Madam,” I said, “I am delighted to
have been of some trifling service to you.”

she said with a sigh. -

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN a highly virile explorer, gifted with all the primitive
and barbarous attractions of his fatal type, swoops down
upon an ancient manor, we may be sure that trouble is brew-
ing—especially when the manor contains a delightful and
confiding girl. In The Squire's Daughter (METHUEN) Mr.
ARCHIBALD MARSHALL deals with such a situation. Having
read his novel with sustained interest from the first page to
the last, I am bound to say that he deals with it admirably.
He is never mawkish ; he never gushes unseasonably; he
never offends by misplaced sentimentality. To these virtues
of a negative sort he adds extraordinary positive merits. I
have said that the book is very interesting. It owes that
supreme quality not merely to its skilfully managed plot,
but also to the abundant and cheerful humour-the twins,
for instance, are quite irresistible—the deft, light touch, and
Field's last book. It has a wicked heart, however, for it is
the tsetse, whose bite conveys sleeping sickness to the
inhabitants of Uganda, though not, of course, to the people
who read about it in a novel. Mr. MASEFIELD makes no bones
about dispensing with the conventions of his craft, for his
heroine dies quite early, and we never, in fact, meet her in
flesh and blood. It is the influence of her memory, however,
which causes Roger Naldrett to desert play-writing for
science, and set out for East Africa with anºther altruistic
entomologist in search of a cure for trypanosomiasis. The
author is quite at home among jungles and swamps and
wingéd horrors; he is, in fact, one of the most imaginative
pen-explorers I have ever read; but I am not sure that his
psychological analysis of germs and flies consoles me for the
substitution of medicine for romance. Also he commits one
or two mistakes on other matters, which make me a little
distrustful of his accuracy as a leech. There is no such
plant, I believe, as an “aspodesta; ” and when I hear of
golfers “loafing" round the links I should like to assure
Mr. MASEFIELD that the
the excellent characteri-
sation of Mr. MARSHALL.
Mr. Clinton is a live
Squire, puzzle-leaded,
arbitrary, affectionate
and absolutely convinc-
ing in his reality; and
Cicely, his sweet daugh-
ter, with her innocence,
her gaiety and her
charm, is just such a
daughter as any Squire
may well be thankful
for. All the persons,
in short, stand out clear
and well-defined. Mr.
MARSHALL his done good
work before, but The
Squire's Daughter is by
far his best.
Some time last year I
read in one of the
monthly magazines a
story by Sir GILBERT
PARKER, which struck
me and remained in
memory by reason of its
EPISODES IN THE LIVES OF THE GREAT.—IV.
SIR CHRISTopher WREN, when QUITE A Boy, constructs A hex-house for his

bite which produces the
golf-fever is far more
like that of the gad-fly
than the tsetse.
I have this against
Mr. C. F. KEARY, who
has written The Mount
(CoNSTABLE), that after
beginning his book as a
placid if cynical study
of provincial snobbism,
with which I was be-
ginning to be restfully
interested, he without
warning plunged it and
me into lurid melodrama.
Thus the story is really
in two parts, of which
the second is at once the
A more thrilling and the
less convincing. The
squalid, ugly life of
a Staffordshire pottery
town, and the social re-
lations of its inhabitants
with the richer manu-
<=e. ~~~~~~
simple poesy, its fresh-
ness of character and scenery. I find it in Northern Lights
(METHUEN), one of nearly a score of short romances from
the same pen. The rarest thing to find in current litera-
ture is a first-class short story. When a man has a tale
to tell, he naturally is disposed to extend it over the
orthodox space of a six-shilling novel. Sir GILBERT PARKER
is more generous. He gives of his best within the compass
of an average of twenty pages. Northern Lights shine over
the Far West country of Canada. One-third of the tales, in
which the red man and woman figure, are reminiscent of
FENIMORE CoopFit at his best. Of late years the author has
been more familiar with the wastes of Carlton House Terrace
and the wanderings of that mighty river, the Thames. But
he has not lost touch with scenes of earlier life, can still
paint the glory of Canadian skies, and enable the reader to
realise the vastness of Canada's prairies and its forests. These
form the background of a succession of stories in which a
few short, sharp strokes of a deftly-wielded pen lead up to
a variety of dramatic situations.
Its publisher (GRANT RICHARDs) has painted a very simple-
looking fly on the cover of Multitude and Solitude, Mr. MASE-
facturers who dwell
in the decayed country that surrounds it, are told enter-
tainingly enough. But when Wilfred Ingram invites Hector
Robinson to an interview in his study at The Mount and
incontinently shoots him dead, I was surprised and shocked.
I join issue with the author over his contention that, given
the help of an old servant (who seems to take things
astoundingly for granted), it would be possible for the body
to be removed and all evidence so destroyed that no suspicion
would fall upon the murderer. Personally, I doubt it. But
Mr. KEARY evidently knows Staffordshire better than I do,
and if he thinks the local police incapable of discovering
where Robertson went that evening, and who wrote the
anonymous letter, I am bound to believe him. At all events
he has written a book which is well worth reading.
From the rules of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds:–
“Subscribers . . . have the privilege of wearing the Hunt Button on
hunting waistcoats or on scarlet evening coats with white facings.
The same, mutatis mutandis, applies to ladies.”
“Mutatis mutandis" is a cowardly way out of it. Why not
mention boldly the Hunt hook-and-eye on the evening
frock?

A TRAP FOR BIG GAME.
To LORD LANSDOWNE.
[“That the quarrel,” says The Times, “has been deliberately and of
set purpose fastened upon the Lords is, of course, obvious.” Yet
Unionists throughout the country persist in urging Lord LANSDowne
to play into the Government's hands by giving it the precise tactical
advantages for which it has been laying itself out.]
AS, when a sportsman in the jungly East
Fixes a toothsome snare
Wherewith to catch the lion, noble beast,
And kill him unaware
(Some juicy trifle well-selected for
The special taste of that fastidious glutton—
An ox, a pig, a potted zebra, or
A woolly mutton),
Then safe behind a closely wattled screen,
Or up a likely tree,
Surveys the prospect with a mind serene
d Snug as Snug can be ;
Waits for the moon to rise and climb about,
Or, failing that, till darkness bids the morn hail,
And he can see to lay his quarry out
Dead as a door-nail, L
There is a moment when the beast appears
In a majestic pose,
Observing Nature through his eyes and ears,
But mainly through his nose;
Stalking his prey with nicely bated breath,
He little dreams, at this diverting juncture,
IIimself will shortly meet a horrid death
Due to a puncture;—
There is a moment (I again remark)
Which shows us at our best,
When any sportsman who can raise a spark
Of pity in his breast
Suffers a qualm that puts him off his smile
To think that he should slay—it seems disgusting—
A thing so ignorant of human guile,
So naive, and trusting;-
Just so, my lord, when on a hunting raid
LLoyd waits for you to spring
Into the simplest trap was ever laid
For any living thing,
There comes a moment when a kind of shame
Freezes his fighting marrow on reflecting
How innocent you are (for such big game),
How unsuspecting.
But, when the lion with a lusty bound
Falls on the fat decoy,
Rends it in little bits and lies around
Licking his chops for joy,
Past is the fear of ultimate remorse;
The hunter's blood is hot: it almost hisses;
He takes and plugs him dead (unless, of course,
The idiot misses). O. S.
The Horrors of the Bath.
“Miss Edith Milner writes to The Times from Ober-Amnergau con-
cerning the Passion-Play of next year. She discourses on the luxury
with which travellers to the pleasant little village in Bavaria will be
provided on the next occasion—that is to say, in 1910. The lodgings
are to be more comfortable, baths are to be provided. . . . I shudder
at the prospect set forth by Miss Milner.”–0. K. S., in “The Sphere.”
The italics are ours; the shuddering is Mr. SHORTER's.
THE SPIREAD OF SOCIALISM.
[“During the recent Army manoeuvres large numbers of officers and
men who were in the stubble fields suffered from the attacks of
'harvesters,’ a little insect which burrows under the skin. Many of
the spectators, including, it is stated, some distinguished persons, who
were present at the final battle on Brabury Down and Coleshill, are also
victims.”—Daily Mail (all except the italics).]
SINCE the above outrage all sorts of titled people have
become the targets of impudent insects, which have apparently
taken courage from the successful attack of the “harvesters”
here mentioned. Only the other day the Marchioness of
was set upon by a wasp, which must have been per-
fectly well aware of the rank of his victim, and it was a
mere chance that the butler in his efforts to save his mis-
tress was, fortunately, stung instead. Even the timid
house-fly is forgetting himself: The other day—to the honour
of all who witnessed it—one of these middle-class pests was
seen, actually seen, to alight on and explore the unde-
veloped baldness of a certain noble Earl. Lord B–, too,
has had a nasty experience down in Devonshire. Think-
ing that his exalted rank would protect him from annoyance,
his lordship sat down for a few minutes on an ant-hill to
tie up his bootlace. The inhabitants were evidently Socialists
to an ant, for they were literally all over him in a minute!
Where is this sort of thing going to end? Cats are beginning
to look askance at Countesses; a dog has dared to disobey
a Duke; even the humble worm, as has been predicted
these many years past, is turning. The three-year-old heir
of a noble house, on bisecting one of these loathsome creatures,
was to his dismay immediately outvoted--for a worm counts
two on a division. Only last Wednesday a beetle was found
in the bath of a Baroness. How did it get there? What do
these things mean? Again, we are informed that a sparrow

a padded room where, for a penny, a man could go in for
five minutes and laugh heartily and kick about and enjoy
himself. A number of advertisements, bearing on this
idea, have already been received by Mr. Punch.

TO POSTUMUS IN OCTOBER.
WHEN you and I were younger the world was passing fair;
Our days were sped with laughter, our steps were free as air;
Life lightly lured us onward, and ceased not to unroll
In endless shining vistas a playground for the soul.
But now no glory fires us; we linger in the cold,
And both of us are weary, and both are growing old;
Come, Postumus, and face it, and, facing it, confess
Your years are half a hundred, and mine are nothing less.
When you and I were twenty, my Postumus, we kept
In tidy rooms in College, and there we snugly slept.
And still, when I am dreaming, the bells I can recall
That ordered us to chapel or welcomed us to hall.
The towers repeat our voices, the grey and ancient Courts
Are filled with mirth and movement, and echo to our sports;
Then riverward we trudge it, all talking, once again
Down all the long unlovely extent of Jesus Lane.
One figure leads the others; with frank and boyish mien,
Straight back and sturdy shoulders, he lords it o'er the scene;
His grip is firm and manly, his cheeks are smooth and red;
The tangled curls cling tightly about his jolly head.
And when we launch the eight-oar I hear his orders ring;
With dauntless iteration I see his body swing:
The pride of all the river, the mainstay of our crew—
O Postumus, my bald one, can this be truly you?
Nay, Postumus, my comrade, the years have hurried on ;
You're not the only Phoenix, I know, whose plumes are gone.
When I recall your splendour, your memory, too, is stirred;
You too can show a moulted, but once refulgent, bird;
And, if I still should press you, you too could hardly fail
To point a hateful moral where I adorned the tale.
'Twere better to be thankful to Heaven that ruled it so,
And gave us for our spending the days of long ago. C

LITERATURE WELL THUMBED.
[“The World's Great Books” (says the adver-
tisement) “is a work which the necessities of
modern civilisation have long demanded. The
twentieth century has been described as a
century in a hurry. Time-saving methods and
appliances are needed everywhere. It is in-
evitable that the time-saving principle should
be extended to literature. . . . The new Harms-
worth fortnightly is destined to provide the
remedy. . . . A book like The Origin of Species
will be presented to you as if Darwin had
written it in the form of an article for the
busy man who reads The Daily Mail; Jane

short story for a magazine.”
It is a fine conception. We hope we have
caught the spirit of it in our attempt to re-write
The Egoi t.]
LORD WILLOUGHBY'S WOOING.
[You can start this story now !]
SYNopsis of PREVIOUS CHAPTERs.
After an able but slightly fanciful
prelude, in which the author, with what
seems now to have been almost pro-
phetic insight, refers to the dangers and
difficulties of the explorer “on the edge
of the Pole,” we are introduced to
LoRD WILLoughby PATTERNE, a typical
English peer of the better class, the
owner of a fine park and mansion.
His lithe-limbed figure is the admi-
ration of all, particularly of
MRs. MoUNTSTUART JENKINSON, one of his
neighbours. Lord Willoughby is
madly in love with a charming girl,
LADY CONSTANTIA DURHAM. She however
throws him over and elopes with
the scion of a noble house who is
in the Guards. Lord Willoughby
is literally decimated with grief,
and turns for consolation to
LADY LEtitia DALE, a charming girl who
lives close by. Before he can pro-
pose to her he becomes the winner
of the great Atlas Competition,
which entitles him to a free tour
round the world. On his return
from this he finds that Lady Letitia
has lost much of her beauty. Sud-
denly, to the surprise of all, he
announces his engagement to
Miss CLARA Middleton, a charming, though
untitled, girl, who is the daughter of
Bishop Middleton, a famous divine.
Father and daughter come to stay
at Patterne Hall. Clara takes a
great interest in young
HoN. CrossJAY PATTERNE, a small relative
of Lord Willoughby, and who is in-
tended for the Navy. He is being
coached by
WERNoN Whitford, a handsome and melan-
choly man, who is secretly in love
with Clara, but from motives of
poverty and honour refrains from
pressing his suit. Clara thinks
that Crossjay will have no chance
of passing for the Navy unless he is
specially crammed. [In regard to
which an interesting discussion has
arisen in our columns and is con-
tinued below.—Editor.] It is upon
this point that the first lovers' tiff
between her and Lord Willoughby
has arisen.
GENERAL SIR HoRACE DE CRAYE. A fasci-
nating and sentimental Irishman.
He has recently been the victim of
a nasty cab accident.
Chapter XX.
An Aged and a Great Wine.
Bishop Middleton was walkingleisurely
up and down the lawn until he should
hear the bell to dress for dinner. As he
paced the soft turf, elastic on muscles
of calf and foot, he bore his broad iron-
grey head in grand elevation. Needless
to say, however, he was troubled about
his daughter. Her mother, Lady Jane,
had been an amiable woman, of the
poetical temperament nevertheless, too
enthusiastic, imaginative, impulsive for
the repose of a sober divine; an admir-
able woman, still, as you see, a woman,
a firework. Clara took after her—
hence these tears. A husband was her
proper custodian, justly relieving a
father. With Socialists and so-called
Liberals abroad and daughters at home,
philosophy is needed for us to keep
erect. Let the girl be Cicero's Tullia,
as the saying is: well, she dies | The
choicest of them will furnish us examples
of a strange perversity.
While he was ruminating in this
extraordinary manner he was approached
by Lord Willoughby, who was swinging
the key of his cellar.
“What will you drink, Bishop?”
asked his lordship.
“Well,” said Dr. Middleton, cautiously,
“what have you * >

down to my cellar.”
“Have you anything good 2"
“A wine aged ninety.”
“Port?”
“Port.”
“Ah, we are in England.”
[The Australians much appreciated Pellier
Water during their stay in this country.—ADvT.]
A chirrup was in the right reverend
bishop's tone as he launched into his
famous discourse on wines: “Hocks,”
he said, “are sometimes old. I have
tasted very old Hocks. There are many
different kinds of Hocks. We say Old
Tawny Port. We cannot say that of any
other drink. We never, for instance,
say Old Tawny Ginger Ale. , Port is
literally deep-sea deep. It is like a
classic tragedy; for example, The Aga-
memnon, which is, I hear, appearing
in fortnightly parts in ‘The World's
Great Books.’ Port is our noblest legacy.
Burgundy has great genius. I do not
compare the wines; I distinguish the
I am just going
qualities. Claret also, as you say, has
moments.”
[Do you drink Three Moon Brandy?—AdvT.]
Conversing jocularly thus, they ap-
proached the cellar. But their gaiety
left them as they began to descend.
The cool, vaulted passages struck a

sudden chill into the heart of his lord-
ship. He shivered. A nameless fear
also seized the eminent divine.
“Wait,” he said hoarsely; “there is
something I must tell you.”
It was too late. The other had turned
the key and the cellar-door swung open.
They held their breath as they peered
into the darkness. What was that 2

THE NAVY 2
To the Editor of “The Daily Mail.”
The Laurels, Eastbourne.
DEAR SIR,-I have been much inte-
rested in the discussion which has arisen
with regard to the education of the lad
Crossjay, and I am certainly of opinion
that it would be advisable to remove
him from his present tutor, and place
him in charge of a specialist in pre-
paring boys for the Navy. Speaking for
myself, I have one vacancy for the next
term ; and I may state that boys under
my charge are not only instructed by a
highly qualified staff of resident gradu-
ates, but also receive every home atten-
tion from Mrs. Tutt, assisted by an
efficient lady matron.
I am, Sir, &c. PERCY TUTT.
Owing to the great interest aroused
in this question, an interest which will
be largely increased by Mr. Tutt's letter,
we have telegraphed to the headmasters
of all our leading public schools, asking
them to let us know whether, in their
opinion, a private tutor or a coaching
establishment is the better preparation
for the Navy. We print the answers
we have received :-
From the HEADMASTER of PoCKLING ſon:
“Many of our boys pass direct into
Army without extra coaching.”
From the HEADMASTER of CLAYESMoRE:
“The health of the pupil is of more
importance than mere examinations.”
From the HEADMASTER of BROMsgrove:
“It depends on the boy.”

FIRST AID FOR THE DRAMA.
The spirited new departure taken
by Mr. HERBERT TRENch in enriching
the Haymarket programmes for King
Lear with an essay on that momentous
tragedy is, we are glad to learn, about
to be extensively followed by other
lessees, managers and presenters. It
is with sincere pleasure that we repro-
duce portions of the masterly appreci-
ation of Dear Little Denmark, which
has recently emanated from the scholarly
pen of Mr. FRANK CURZON. º 3.2
Dear Little Denmark is PAUL RUBENS's
supreme achievement, perhaps the most
poignant and soul-shaking comedy ever
written, excelling the Frogs of ARISTO-
PHANEs in subtlety of characterisation,
The School for Scandal in beauty of
execution, and Our Boys in profundity
of thought. * * : * * , a
Never was a more daring conception
than that of Ophelia, a maiden from
Jutlan l, wearing a tall hat and speaking
broad Lancashire | A lesser genius with
a lesser conception of cosmic humour
would have shrunk from such a teme-
rarious flight. But PAUL RUBENS, uniting,
as his name implies, apostolic fervour
with the opulent artistry of an old
master, shrinks from nothing. His
tragically profound sense of humour
perceived that this strange manifestation
of the ewig weibliche supplied a scope
for irony which great imaginations have
always found in human affairs, and the
result is an overwhelming justification
of his intrepid enterprise. & &
In his versatility—for he is his own
librettist—PAUL RUBENs challenges com-
parison with the Bayreuth Colossus and
emerges triumphantly from the exacting
ordeal. For while WAGNER's command
of sentiment was restricted to its more
serious phases PAUL RUBENS ranges
over the whole gamut of human emotion
from elemental passion to the most
delicate caprice. WAGNER, great genius
that he was, could never have written
that adorable refrain to the “humming
duet”:-
Oh, tiddily um!
Lum tity toty tum!
Lum tiddily um!
Lum tity toty tum!
Lum tiddily um!
Lum tity toty tum!
Lum ti to ta tee—
Tiddily um!
To find a parallel to the fine careless
rapture of this wonderful lyric one has
to go back to HERRICK, CATULLUS or
SAPPHo. 32 * & * 32
Another trait in PAUL RUBENS which
stamps him with the indelible hall-mark
of genius is his prescience. Thus the
family name of the Duke in Dear Little
Denmark is Rasmussen, though the pro-
duction antedated by many weeks the
sudden leap into eminence of his name-
School Governess. “Why, VERA, Your Essay is copied word For word from MacAulay.”
Vera. “WELL, I Thought I couldn't Do A BETTER ONE Myself.”
sake, the renowned Eskimo linguist and
champion of Dr. Cook. But in nomen-
clature, as in all else, PAUL RUBENs is
paramount in poetic significance and
imaginative splendour. Note how trip-
pingly his title flows from the tongue—
Dear Little Denmark, and compare it
with the clumsy inanity of, say, Cheap
Great Sweden or Hateful Huge Russia.
In fine, anyone who reads the play
aright will find through all its spiritual
chaos and terror the savage, majestic,
human soul struggling towards gentle-
ness, dignity and feeling for others.
Changed are the men and women who
have come through these stormy waters,
and the headstrong, wilful Hansen of
the opening scene is hardly recognisable
in the discredited Court physician who,
in the hour of supreme humiliation and
defeat, forgets his own sorrows to com-
fort his faithful Lancashire sweetheart
from the vine-clad summits of Jutland.
“Incapacitated, presumably by gout, judging
from the boot that cannot escape the eye of a
sufferer from this complaint, the lady sat com-
placently in a chair."—The Observer.
“Judging,” we should have said (mind-
ful of the gouty squire of fiction) “by
the eye that cannot escape the boot of a
sufferer from this complaint.”
“Widower (35), two daughters, desires cor-
respondence with smart, lovable young lady,
able to swim."—Yorkshire Post.
We suggest to Mr. MAUGHAM that he
should strike new ground by making
his next heroine a smart, lovable young
lady, who can swim.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW FOLKS AT HOME.
II -
London (England).
DEAR SADIE, -– It’s a terrible while
since I heard from you, and I’ve been
looking for something from your end of
the line this last month. Just rustle
two cents (that's all it is now) and send
me a letter, dear, quick; I'd like to
know what's happening your way.
Pop is in terrible disgrace, and I must
tell you about it. The whole racket was
over a salmon, so I reckon you won't
understand it; but it shows what queer
folk they are over here anyway. This
is how it happened. Pop was staying in
Scotland at a house where they've got a
grouse reservation and a bit of a wood,
and a little one-horse creek with salmon
in it. All the sports were crazy to catch
a salmon, but couldn't do it, although
they tried for weeks and talked about it
no end. You have to wear a hat trimmed
with flies, and creep about behind bushes
so as to fool the salmon, and if you're in
luck you get a rise; and that's the end
of it, because it never comes to anything.
Well, Pop had noticed the men doing
all this play-acting, and listened to their
hard-luck tales about the pesky fish, and
one night he fixed it up to have a dash
himself. Next morning, bright and
early, Pop went out and dug up a worm,
put it on a hook and dropped it into the
creek and waited for the bell to ring.
Sure enough in a minute or two he felt
a tug and yanked out a big salmon ' It
was a beauty, and Pop was in two minds
about putting it back because fish don't
agree with him, but he concluded to take
it indoors and show the folks. When
they saw the fish and heard how Pop
had caught it they were fit to be tied,
they were so mad. It appears that the
old man had done the wrong thing
somehow, and ought not to have fished
that way on any account! One man said
it was worse than shooting foxes, and
another one said it wasn't cricket! And
Pop said, No, of course it wasn't, it was
fishing, and all he cared about was results!
They didn't quit talking about it all day,
and they kept up until Pop cleared out.
It's a kind of mystery, anyhow.
I met Maisie Hopkins out shopping
one day last week, and we went to the
Silence Room and had a long talk. As
soon as her souvenir collection is ready
she's going back home, and my word '
Sadie, she has got some things. Maisie
is no slouch when antiques are around !
Four full-sized Saratogas bursting with
them—curios, hotel spoons and relics'
It made my mouth water worse than a
melon 1 Maisie says collecting is dead
easy in this country because folks don't
savvy the value of things and don't
know what they're selling half the time.
For instance, Maisie was in a cathedral
town and lit on an old curiosity-store on
a side-street, and you ought to see the
bargains that woman walked away with !
There was a plague-pipe—there are only
about half-a-dozen of them left in the
country—and a silver coin very old, with
B.C. 62 on it, and the cutest snuff-box
you ever saw It was dug up some-
where in a part called Cornwall and
belonged to King ARTHUR The old
hay-seed who was tending store for his
brother let her have the things for a
song! I tell Maisie she has all the luck,
sure, but she says No, it's just the bar-
gain sense! I guess she's right.
I took Pop to dinner at the Wacken-
baths a few mights back. Old man
Wackenbath has struck it rich in glue,
and he's over here now collecting heir-
looms. He claims that his collection is
the biggest in Europe, and I guess he's
not far off the mark. There were a lot
of folks there, and after dinner most
everybody settled down to bridge; so I
talked to the man who took me in. He is
in the Army, and games give him brain
fag, he says. He wears a monocle, and I
asked him why. And he said it was a
regimental custom, and the other officers
would haze him if he didn't! I never
saw such a man! We got on to Ameri-
can history and national heroes, and I
asked him who was his favourite cha-
racter in American history – GEORGE
WASHINGTON or Rock EFELLER 2 and he
said the Governor of North Carolina
was his favourite character! Sakes
alive I couldn't make anything of the
man; but he's going to call here some
afternoon, if he can get time off. He's
in the Guards, and they hardly have
time for anything, they have to work so.
It's too bad.
Cy has just come prancing in as
proud as a poodle with a blue rosette.
He got among some green-goods men at
a race meeting, and they thought he was
a Britisher because he didn't wear a flat
hat and fancy shoe-laces, and one of the
men said he was at school with Cy, and
Cy said, Yes, sure, and did he remember
the old vicarage with the honeysuckle
round the portico where they used to
spend vacations? And the man said,
Yes, and would Cy flutter for sovereigns?
So Cy fluttered, and won twice, and then
he wouldn't go on with it, and when the
man said, Why not? Cy said that his old
man—the Vicar—told him never to toss
more than twice with old school-mates
at race meetings because it was immoral.
The green-goods merchant cracked on to
beat the band and said that Cy ought to
be deported I reckon Cy is slick
enough to be a politician; what do you
think?
How are things at Bangville 2 I shall
be glad to be back along with all the
folks, though I’m not saying that it
isn't good fun, this travelling around
and seeing things. I shall never be
sorry I brought Pop over here, and it.
does me good to see him he's as
chipper as a sandfly, and enjoys himself
all the time.
Write as soon as you can, Sadie, and
send me all the news. I must quit now
as I'm going to try on some clothes and
the woman is waiting. They’re dreams,
but I haven’t the time to tell you about
them this mail. Happy days'

THE STAG O’ TEN.
WE left the lodge in the morning,
The rime was white on the grass,
The cock grouse crowed on the hillocks
To cheer us up the Pass,
The peaks were in golden glory,
The flats wine-purple, when
We left the lodge in the morning
To look for the stag o' ten
And we searched each face and corrie,
And we saw the heather swim
A-jump in the heat at noontide,
All hazy blue and dim :
And we saw the red hinds listen
Heads high and ears held still,
And we watched the bobbing canter
That carried them up the hill!
We spied and we crawled and clambered,
But never the glass picked up
A hint of his branching honours—
Of brow, of tray, of cup,
Till over the western summits
The night came down the glen,
And out came a star to mock us
For want of the stag o' ten
As back to the lodge's lamp-light
We went by the darkling braes,
All solemnly through the birches
The moon came up to gaze
On one of us lamely limping,
Burnt sorely red and brown,
As stiff as a kitchen poker
With “plowtering up an’ down l’’
But we’d seen some six fair counties
Spread out as a map might be;
We’d seen an eagle wheeling,
A far gray shield of sea;
We'd looked on the rugged splendour
Of loch and rock and Ben—
So one of us said 'twas worth it,
In spite of the stag o' ten

THE “ROOFER'S ’’ SUCCESSOR.
The roofer is dead; that is certain.
But when did it die? When did the
agreeable habit of thanking a hostess
for a pleasant visit beneath her roof die
and disappear 2 It would puzzle the
social historian to say, but it probably
met its end at about the same time as
many other good manners. To-day
visitors come and go and say nothing
of it, and it is by way of commentary
on this new departure that a hostess of
imagination has invented a novel type
of duty-letter. It takes the form of a
communication from the hostess to her
guest thanking him for being so gracious
as to confer distinction on her house
by his presence and so condescending
as to eat her food and drink her wine.
It runs something like this:—
“DEAR MR. BLANK, I trust that you
got home safely, and found that all had
gone well during your absence. It was
very kind of you to spare so much of
your valuable time for such insignificant
persons as ourselves, and we duly appre-
ciate the honour done us, especially
when we recollect how far we live from
town, and how few attractions the house
can offer to so répandu a worldling as
yourself. If at any time you are so
good as to pay us another visit, I trust
you will remember that a Complaint
Book is placed in the hall, and anything
that you object to we will do our best to
improve.
“Pray do not trouble to acknowledge
this, and believe me to be yours to
command, “ALICE HAVEN.”
NATURAL HISTORY NOTE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I think that you
as a dog-lover (for you do love Toby,
don't you? At any rate, you seem to
be inseparables) will be interested in
hearing of an invention that has just
been perfected by Messrs. Curzon of the
Strand, the well-known mathematical-
instrument makers. This consists of a
pedometer for dogs, so carefully con-
structed that it may be altered in its
gear to suit the gait of both a toy terrier
and a St. Bernard. It is a small instru-
ment with a strap to fix it firmly to the
leg, so that the dog cannot worry it off.
Every dog-lover has remarked from time
to time upon the wonderful distances
that his dogs run when they are out
with him. By means of this pedometer
those distances can now be ascertained.
I tried one on a fox-terrier last week,
affixing it to him at the beginning of
a walk over the hills which was to ex-
tend on my part to a measured two-and-
a-half miles, or exactly an hour in time.
Will you believe it, that when the hour
was up the dog had covered fifteen-and-
a-third miles? You see how interesting
this invention will make country walks;
and I need hardly remind you of the bets,
etc., it will lead to.
Yours, PHIL CAINE.

being a very silly pigeon. It used to
be such a comfortable arrangement,
your coming to the window of my rooms.
After all, you did not have to struggle
with the stairs, and, even if I had
wanted to, I couldn't fly to your nest.
How was I to know where it is, or
whether you pigeons even have nests
at all? Then you suddenly go and take
offence and never come back to the old
window-sill any more. As I say, I
think you are behaving foolishly, even
for a pigeon.
I must confess that, when in the first
place I started putting crumbs on the
sill, it was not so much out of kindness
to you as because I did not know where
else on earth to put them. If Ithrew them
out on to the lawn, there were always
the Temple porters with top-hats; if I
put them down the waste pipe, there
were always sanitary inspectors without
top-hats, but with a lot of violence con-
cealed about them. So I laid them on
the sill and you came along and thought
that I was meaning to do you a good
turn. Who was I to undeceive you?
Really, my dear old bird, you cannot
blame me for that. Be blowed, they
were excellent crumbs as crumbs go,
and I know lots of sparrows who would
simply have hopped at them. Moreover,
I dare say that when you first took to
leaving feathers on the sill you were
not thinking entirely of my pipe-clean-
ing. Of course you will now say that
you were, but I can quite imagine that,
though feathers are all very well to fly
with and to keep yourself warm and all
that, it is very comforting to find a man
who will let you shed the worn-out ones
all over his house and still go on giving
you crumbs. You simply dared not go
into a second-hand clothes shop and try
to dispose of them; you knew that, if
you once started doing that, you would
probably end in a cage or in a pie.
As it was our little mutual arrangement
might have gone on for years and years (or
for as many years as pigeons go on), and
no blame have attached to either party,
when you go and make an idiot of yourself
over a cigarette-end. Surely you are
never going to say that I had no right
to put it there? After all, it is my sill,
and how was I to know that you were
a non-smoker? Besides, even a non-
smoker might have known that, with
however good intentions you start a
cigarette, you have to leave off before
you get to the end. Then there is that
tiresome bit to get rid of, and, as
the Temple porters still wore top-hats
and the inspectors were still sanitary,
there was nothing else for it but the
window-sill again. But I thought that
any fool could tell the difference between
a cigarette-end and a crumb, and surely
you are aware that, if you do not care
for what you happen to be eating, you
can always leave it on your plate?
Now look here, old cock. "I am ready
to climb down, if you are ready to climb
up. Come and patronise the old window-
sill, for goodness' sake, and get on with
your crumbs, and let me get on with
the cleaning of my pipes. Anyhow, I
promise not to put another cigarette-
end in your way unless I feel that I
simply must have one more good laugh.
Lastly, I warn you that, if you ignore
my very decent offer, I shall resort to
drastic courses. I may even have to
punish you by sub-letting my rooms to
a man I know who eats all his crumbs
himself, keeps an air-gun and simply
hates pigeons.
Yours still, GEORGE.

House of Commons, Monday, Septem-
ber 27.-Only thirty questions on paper.
When first called on not as many Mem-
bers present. Front Opposition Bench
tenantless. Treasury Bench almost in
same condition. Here and there a lusty
trout, such as N. B. HALDANE, and here
and there a grayling, represented by
SYDNEY BUXTON, who also had question
to answer. What with non-appearance
of Members who have put questions
down and non-arrival of Ministers to
whom they are addressed, collapse of
sitting seems imminent.
Fine opportunity for Hobhouse, who
makes the most of it. Nominally FINAN-
CIAL SECRETARY TO TREASURY, he is actually
the Utility Man of the Ministry. When
any right hom. colleague is detained
elsewhere by State affairs, he sends
written answer to HoBHOUSE, who in due
course reads it to House. A quick-
change artist, he at one moment repre-
sents the Admiralty, anon the Board of
Trade, frequently the Treasury, LLoyd-
GEORGE being shut up in his room
drafting new clauses for Budget Bill.
All very well to read typewritten
manuscript. Difficulty presents itself
when enquiring minds opposite put
supplementary questions. Process akin
to that of giving novice swimming lessons
with assistance of the corks, presently
withdrawing them and bidding him
go ahead. HobHouse comes through
ordeal admirably. Naturally knows
little of particulars of case presented
as affected by internal arrangements
whether of Admiralty, Board of Trade,
or Treasury. Nevertheless manages to
give the soft answer that turneth away
curiosity.
Business done.—Thirty-fifth sitting in
Committee on Budget Bill. Members
in almost comatose state.
Tuesday. — The CHATTERJEEs in full
cry. A group of fourteen questions
relating to unrest in India stands in
their name. CHATTERJEE Cotton leads
off with three. Close on his heels come
ACHYUT RUTHERFoRD, ARABINDo MACKAR-
NESS, and Kolhatkar LUPTON, who be-
lieves vaccination is at the bottom of
the whole bad business. From his tower
on top corner seat below Gangway, REES
of HINDUSTAN looks on, watchful, ready
to trip up the CHATTERJEES.
Got a bit of string across the road
in preparation for preliminary canter
of CHATTERJEE CottoN, who moved
for return setting forth particulars of
recent deportations in India. REES gave
notice of another designed to present
situation in entirely new light. When
Questions got in full swing, he, a sort
of Parliamentary King's Proctor, was
constantly “intervening,” submitting in
form of cunningly constructed question
propositions designed to bring the
CHATTERJEES ignominiously to mother
earth.
One of the finest touches in the
familiar comedy is the attitude the
CHATTERJEES adopt towards their inquisi-
tor. They just ignore him. As far as
sign of knowledge of his presence is
forthcoming, he might still be in Hindu-
stan. If it were the Irish Nationalists'
turn, and if in analogous circum-
stances anyone were to controvert their
questions by argument prefaced by the
phrase, “Before the right hon. gentle-

Nothing more chilling than silence

forthcoming from Kolhatkar LUPTON.

been vaccinated. Knows that, even if
Rules permitted him to address enquiry
designed to clear up doubt on subject,
REEs would work in one of his innocent-
looking counter-interrogations and sug-
gest that, assuming (which he would
not) the suspicion were well founded,
the alleged act took place at a time
when, owing to his being a minor, he
had no legal responsibility.
Nevertheless, though up to present
date he has mastered disposition to
formulate enquiry on the subject, LUPTON
regards REES with gravest suspicion,
moving uneasily in his seat when he
hears his voice. Some day temptation
will prove irresistible and Rees of
HINDUSTAN, warned off prevarication, will
be publicly challenged to say “Yes” or
“No” to a personal question.
Another part in comedy admirably
filled is that of UNDER-SECRETARY For
INDIA. Came down to-day with sheaf of
manuscript containing official answers to
questions on the paper. Before he could
read No. 1, REES of HINDUSTAN inter-
posed, turning searchlight full upon the
CHATTERJEES grouped on the benches
below, disclosing, as it were through the
back of their heads, the disloyal inten-
tions that inspire their indictment of
the Indian Executive Government.
ELIBANK not to be drawn into con-
troversy. He also ignores existence
of IREEs of HINDUSTAN, a condition to
which that gentleman is growing
accustomed. -
“In reply to the question on the paper,”
says ELIBANK with emphasis establishing
a distinction, and then comes the bare
recital of facts.
Here the incident might be expected
to end. Such expectation indicates
ignorance of the ways of the CHATTERJEES.
They have asked their question and re-
ceived full answer. Instantly full pack
on its hind legs yelping in chorus fresh
enquiries. ELIBANK purrs back replies
which contain as little as possible in
addition to official answer. Next ques-
tion on paper. The King's Proctor in-
tervenes as before. Pussy purrs again
with increasing seductiveness. More
yelping in chorus, and so da capo.
The House, though bored by vain
repetition, looks on smilingly at the
diversion. But what about its effect on
the teeming population of India when
gravely reported in native newspapers?
Business done.—Committee on Budget
Bill solemnly decide that chalk is not a
mineral. -

the fourteen millions which everyone
admits have to be raised somehow were
levied upon tea or sugar, to destroy the

tional question of the Lords' meddling
with money Bills. But it would be
free from suspicion of personal interest.
By a Budget that creates a system of
Land Taxes, increases Death Duties,
invents super-income-tax, the Lords
themselves are sorely smitten, and can-
not escape unworthy suspicion.
“In throwing out the Budget they

QUESTION AND ANSER.
INTERVIEW witH THE TALKING Goose.
THE wonderful thinking goose which
so deeply impressed the editorial staff of
The Daily Chronicle has made astonishing
strides since his arrival in London. To
begin with, “Jimmy’ was able to con-
verse only by the somewhat cumbrous
method of picking out cards with words
painted on them. But a few lessons
from a famous voice-producer, Mr. Benry
Hussell, have put that all right, and
“Jimmy" now talks quite distinctly in
a rich fruity voice with the timbre of a
bass clarinet.
Interviewed last Saturday by our
representative at the Golden Egg Hotel,
“Jimmy” courteously answered a num-
ber of questions bearing on his own
career and the political situation with
the utmost lucidity and intelligence,
though confessing to a little fatigue after
a succession of Michaelmas escapes.
Asked as to his parentage and origin,
“Jimmy" stated that he was un-
doubtedly of royal descent, as hisancestors
were settled at Kingussie (King Goosey).

Jack (who has been running all the morning). “WERY sorry, SIR, DAREN'r Do No work.

Master. “WHAT'S THE MATTER 2"
Jack. “Got A BAD Foot."
When the laughter provoked by this
joyous sally had died away our re-
presentative asked “Jimmy” what he
thought of the Budget. “What do I
think of it?” he replied. “Why, of
course, I have an hereditary partiality for
all quack remedies.” In this context
“Jimmy" spoke with great cordiality
of his reception at the offices of The
Chronicle, where he was delighted to
find a rook sitting in the office window.
“This,” said Jimmy, “is the age of the
bird. Man takes him for his model in
aerial locomotion. He cannot even dis-
pense with swallow tails in his evening
attire.”
“Is it true,” queried our repre-
sentative, “that you have decided to
appear at the Music-halls 2"
“No,” said “Jimmy,” “ but I have
accepted an engagement to speak on
behalf of the Budget League to counter-
balance the effect of the fifty-seven-
years-old goose (belonging to a friend of
the Duchess of BEDFord) who has been
retained as a champion of Tariff

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A STUDY IN JOURNALISTIC
CONDENSATION.
THE passengers in the coasting steamer,
Davy Jones, had an alarming experience
yesterday morning when that vessel
struck on a submerged rock near
Murther-Treadmyll, North Wales. The
captain, Mr. John Jones, immediately
ordered the boats to be lowered, and a
lifeboat was despatched from shore by
Mr. William Jones, harbour-master, under
the command of Mr. Thomas Henry
Jones (retired Royal Navy); but, the
catastrophe having occurred in only six
feet of water, the passengers, to the
number of seventeen, were safely got
| ashore without even getting wet.
Mr. George Ap-John Jones (aged 45,
married), a spectator from the beach,
gives the following account:—“I was
standing on the shore with my friend,
Mr. Owen Owens Jones, when we saw
the Davy Jones strike end-on upon some
obstruction below the surface. The
boats were instantly lowered, but were
found unnecessary, as the passengers
managed to climb ashore over the rocks
without even wetting their feet. There
must have been some sixteen or eighteen
of them. The wreck was got off without
any assistance from the lifeboat. The
incident reflects great credit on all con-
cerned [except perhaps the helmsman,
Mr. Thomas Jones.—ED.].
In an interview, the captain, Mr.
John Jones (49, unmarried) states:—
We wass steaming off Murther-Treadmyll
about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, at
a speed of ten knots whateffer, when I
heard the ship strike a rock. I ordered
the boats out whateffer, although the
water wass no more than six feet deep.
I wass be signalling for a lifeboat.
How many passengers were you carry-
ing, Captain Jones?— Seventeen. I
wass shouting out that there wass be no
danger, and put on a lifebelt.
Was there any panic?–None what-
effer. We wass only a yard or two from
the shore, and they wass landing in a
few minitts.
Nobody was drowned ? — Nobody
whateffer; they went ashore dry-footed.
I wass be administering stimulants to the
crew, and we got the vessel off whateffer.
The Murther-Treadmyll Cross-E.caminer
supplies the following interesting de-
tails:– “The depth of the water at the
scene of the unforeseen catastrophe
approximates, according to the corro-
borated evidence of experienced mariners,
to six feet. No insuperable obstacles
were therefore presented to disembarka-
tion at this point, and no inconvenience
experienced by compulsory immersion in
the waters of what our old friend HomeR
describes as the moºvºpMoto80to 6a)\agains.
Mr. Robert Jones (29, widower), a pas-
senger, a jamboiler, in an account which
we have to condense owing to extreme
pressure on our space, states that the
lifeboat, under Mr. Thomas Henry Jones,
made every effort to meet the wreck in
time, but the passengers—seventeen in
number—scrambled over the beach or
(in the case of the ladies) were carried
ashore before he arrived. There was
hardly a wet pair of shoes amongst them
all. Owing to the shallowness of the
water—about six feet—the danger was
infinitesimal.
[We have corroborated the above parti-
culars. The Admiralty charts give the
depth of the water as six feet, and
Lloyd's Register identifies the captain as
Mr. John Jones, of Bangor. Private
investigations endorse the fact that not
a single passenger was submerged.]
AWAKE, ENGLAND !
[The following lines will, it is hoped, arouse
our youth to a sense of their decadence (as
recently remarked by The Daily Mail) in per-
mitting foreigners to monopolise the hotel-
managing business.]
OH, where has the sea-dog been couch-
ing?
Oh, where are the Norsemen of old,
The chaps who were constantly pouching
Some enemy's gold 2
Has nothing been left of the order
Of barons who boned what they could,
Of raiders who harried the Border,
And bold Robin Hood?
The buccaneer captains of Devon
Who barbered King PHILIP of Spain,
Has none of them left us his leaven
Of duty and gain?
And those, the delectable rangers
Of childhood, who dirked and who
drank,
Whose simplest amusement for strangers
Was strolling the plank?
And TURPIN, whose hoof-beats would
hammer
All night on his pillaging route,
Has he not bequeathed us the glamour,
The glory of loot?
Our fathers were full of the vigour,
The verve of the caterer's art,
That bleeds at a regular figure,
Or else à la carte.
Then up, O ye Britons, and follow
The gleam, the adventurous hope,
With backs that are bending and hollow,
With palms that are ope.
Remember the gold of the galleons,
Remember the night-riding swells,
And cut out the Swiss and Italians
At keeping hotels.
A KINDLY SCHEME.
“Yes,” said the Philanthropist, “it is
quite true. The idea came to me at
BURRoughs AND WATTs' the other day as
I watched STEVENSON waiting for his
turn. It was the saddest face I ever
saw. That man, I said to myself—that
man and all the others like him—all the
other billiard-experts who have to wait
their turns—must be catered for.”
“But why?” I asked. “They are
happy enough.” -
“Happy!” said he. “Happy! You
evidently weren't there. I tell you he
was the picture of woe. Besides, happi-
ness has nothing to do with it. It is
the sloth that I object to. Man's duty
is to work, and here was a man doing
nothing—not even watching the game.
Half-hour after half-hour he sat there
with only an occasional brief visit to the
table, while an inferior performer was
doing what he liked with the balls. I
said to myself, I will take that man in
hand.”
“And what have you done?”
“I have prepared a manual for such
enforced idlers. It is called “AllThings,”
an anthology of really good reading,
likely to interest and improve their
minds and lead to a fuller desire for
literature and progress.” :
“Why do you call it “All Things’?”
I asked. .
“Because it is to come to those that
wait.” -
“Tell me some of the contents,” I
said. '
“Well, I begin with TENNyson's
‘Break, Break, Break,’ a beautiful
thing. Then there are selections from
the works of Q. and his sister, LILIAN
QUILLER-Couch or Miss Q. ; MACAULAy’s
ballad on the Battle of Ivry; THACKERAY's
Roundabout Paper, “The Thorns in the
Cushion;' STEVENSON's ‘Merry Men; ”
SHENSTONE's ballad of Jimmy Dawson;
and a translation from the Basia of ‘Se-
cundus.’ At the close are a couple of
exquisite funeral sermons by two Canons
of Westminster, entitled, “The Long
Rest.’ The work is published by Long
Jenny, at the Bodley Head, and there
is a marker in every copy. Not bad, is
it?” he concluded. -
“I’d rather go on looking at my
boots,” I said.
From an official communication from
the Boy Scout Headquarters relative to
a peaceful invasion of France:
“The numbers to be about 6,000, and the
price per capitem, about £2 10s.”
As is well known, the three chief duties
which a Boy Scout must practise daily
are
1) To do a good turn to somebody.
2) To find cover behind a turnip.

IN the sunny South Pacific there's an island all uncharted

Not a tramp has ever hailed it, nor has dip of oar-blade started

Never hurricane may harm it, though at times the land breeze,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is, perhaps, a pity that the John Senhouse of MAURICE
HEWLETT's new novel, Open Country (MACMILLAN), should
have been already introduced to us, at a later stage in his
career, in Halfway House. Not so much because we had
become sufficiently familiar with the charming habits and
foibles of this delectable philosopher of the caravan, but
rather because we should have liked to picture him incon-
solable at the loss of his Sanchia; whereas we know, from
Halfway House, that he is going to be quite ready, after a
modest interval, to take up with another lady. He—and his
author too, I suspect- was first attracted to Sanchia by the
length of white leg which she exposed while wading in a
forest pool. But, in spite of these happy auspices, and the
Poultry, could never have invented Melusine, Hawise and
Sanchia-Josepha; and the mother, who tuft-hunted in the
best circles, would have known better than to hamper her
daughters with fancy-names which might well have frozen-off
the nobler kind of suitor.
When Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick's latest book, The Seccrins
(METHUEN), appears in your house, my advice is this—secure
it firmly and at once for yourself, before anyone else has a
chance to spoil your enjoyment by reading aloud, without
context or explanation, any of the many delightful scenes of
comedy that it contains. Otherwise this is what is safe to
happen. I don't know that it would be quite kind to tell you
the story; but I will hint that the trouble for the Severins
was partly that Michael, the eldest, had been away from
the rest of them so long that when he returned prosperous,
and with ideas of behaviour founded upon that of ordinary
- people, his family could not fail
fact that half the book is a paean
in praise of her loveliness of body
and mind, we never really get to
know her; because she contributes
practically nothing in proof of her
own excellence, seldom committing
herself beyond the point of saying,
“It's very difficult somehow to
know what one ought to do.” For
much of the time she remains pas-
sive as a marble figure—a sort of
Galatea, that only wakes up at an
advanced stage of the story. |.
the way, talking of statues, what
does Mr. HEWLETT mean when he
says, by way of compliment to her
unearthly chastity and beauty:
“He would as soon, he said, seek
the favours of Diana of the
Sphesians as dare to expect one
charged look from her eyes?”
Surely he cannot mean Diana “ of
the Ephesians"—not that many-
breasted Oriental monstrosity ()
On the other hand, John Sen-
house is at no pains to conceal his
personality. Among other items
of self-revelation, he informs his
to strike him with something of
a shock. There were five of

by her children , as Sophia),
Clotilda, the married sister whose
husband was incautiously in
Africa, Selma, the art student,
Camilla, and young Bob ; and

and clever, Bohemian in habits,
and frankly impossible as mem-
bers of the society to which
Michael had grown accustomed.
And their friends were far worse.

unworthy of it... I did, and so (I
am quite sure) did Mrs. SIDGwick;
not otherwise could she have
written what is certainly, so far,
when a successful rival pro-
poses to omit this degrading formality in his relations with
Sanchia, Senhouse insists on it as an essential. Which
at least proves him human at a pinch; and that is more
than can be said for the other gentleman. On Sanchia's
conduct in the matter (she finally omits the formality) I have
no criticism to offer; after all, she is a sort of Arcadian
nymph, and therefore not amenable to ordinary moral
standards; but I don't think I have very often met the kind
of British sportsman who would ask a nice, clean, gently-bred
girl to share his ancestral home as his mistress when by
lifting his hand he could divorce his runaway wife, and
make a decent thing of it.
I have spent all my space and said nothing of the tonic
qualities of Mr. HEWLETT's work. Still faintly Meredithian in
manner, he has sloughed most of his affectations without losing
his fertility of language or his unerring flair for the right
word. He has a very happy touch in his sketches of
Sanchia's sisters. I think, indeed, he must have been a
dominant feature at the baptism of these young women;
for the father, who was something round and large in The
her masterpiece.
A writer in The Manchester Guardian, describing his
sensations on an aeroplane trip, observes that after the flight
he “began to feel as I think, perhaps, the poets do.” This
may account for the headlines of his article which run:
“A FLIGHT WITH ME. CODY.

“It was more difficult for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
than for the little wisp of cotton in the hands of some of those male
volunteers.”—The Daily Chronicle.
Anybody who has seen a camel will agree.
“They (the Unionists) have i. to gain and nothing to lose;
and they intend to lose nothing for lack of courage.”—Daily Mail.
But why make such a point about losing nothing when there
isn't anything to lose?

Confession.
“The silent voter had to be reckoned with, and thoughtful men were
not Socialists, nor were they Nonconformists."
This (according to The Daily Mail) from Sir RobºBT PERKs,
THE WRECK OF “THE ARK.”
ALL went well, as journalists say, until we entered the
harbour. You might think, as I did before I made the
acquaintance of this one, that a harbour was a nice safe
place for a motor-boat to put into. There we sat, all un-
suspicious of danger—the Captain's wife and the Visitor
and the Babe at one end of the boat, and the Captain and
the Engineer and the Crew at the other end. One end was
called the stern, and the other end was called the bow; but
I gathered from the conversation generally that it did not
matter which end was called which. This may have been
because on shore the Captain was a doctor, and the Engineer
was a chauffeur, and the Crew was a novelist, and the Visitor
was a suffragette. The motor-boat was not a motor-car on
shore, but directly we arrived in the harbour it took to be-
having like one, and, when it had run over several fish and a
wooden post that was sticking up in the water to warn us to
keep away from it, it went aground.
The Crew, with great presence of mind, yelled “Star-
board —no, I mean Port ''' and the Captain, under the stress
of circumstance, told us all to get out of the way; and the
Babe, who reads boys' books, jumped up and down and said,
“What fun Have we sprung a leak, and shall we fetch the
shore ?” Then, suddenly, the Engineer remembered he was
a chauffeur and said, “Reverse the engine, Sir,” as you would
if you had run over a man instead of a fish ; and then a lot
of mud was stirred up, and the ('aptain's wife wished she
had worn her other skirt, and the Visitor said it was a bless-
ing purple didn't mark, though white and green did.
Presently, as nothing moved except the dinghy, which
strolled round to the side of the boat and looked up at us
pathetically, the Crew said something about lightening the
ship, whereupon the Captain's wife flung her arms round
the Babe, while the Babe flung hers round the tea-basket,
and the Visitor was heard to regret the absence of Cabinet
Ministers among the ballast. The Captain followed this up
with a further suggestion that we should take to the boats.
There was only one boat, the little thing that was tied on
behind ; but of course in a shipwreck you never talk of
taking to a boat.
“I’m not going to move till I’ve had my tea,” said his
wife firmly. “ l'erhaps by that time, if you stop disturbing
the underneath part of the harbour, we shall be afloat
again.”
The Engineer's caustic remark that the tide was going
down met with nothing but incredulity. “Perhaps it will
go up again if we turn our backs on it,” the Crew said
facetiously.
We were just through with the jam sandwiches and were
starting on the cake when the Engineer, not at all a nice
person to have at a picnic, by the way, mentioned that if
we did not take to the boats now we never should, because
the dinghy was nearly aground too. Whereupon the Crew
dramatically proposed that the women and children should
be landed, while the men remained at the post of danger.
This proposition sounded magnificent until one came to
examine it, when it appeared that the women and children
would have to go without their second cups of tea and their
cake in order to walk home with a tired child across four
miles of broken landscape, while their natural protectors
sat and smoked until what time the tide should rise and
bear them gallantly homewards.
“Privileges, forsooth !” scoffed the Visitor.

folded arms, irresistibly suggesting NAPOLLON-or was it

he said in full rich tones, “and it is my duty to stand by
the ship.”

AN AMERICAN AT OXFORD.
“THAT's St. John's College, M'M.”
“Oh, so You HAVE calileges here!”
“You won't have any difficulty in doing that, darling, if
the tide continues to go down at this rate,” said his wife, as
we rowed ashore.
We found the local Ancient Mariner most discouraging
when we met him later. In his opinion The Ark could not
be got off for a week; he talked also of neap tides. “If it
was a spring tide now,” he added kindly, seeing we were
depressed.
“How could it be a spring tide in the autumn 2" demanded
the Captain's wife crossly; and we left the Ancient Mariner
shivering his timbers.
After that the Babe was packed off to bed sans phrase
because she predicted cheerfully that we should have to sit
through the watches of the night, a prey to horrid thoughts;
but her words came unpleasantly true, and as the hours
went by, bringing no sign of the shipwrecked heroes, the
Captain's wife said she knew now what it meant to be a
mariner's widow, and the Visitor said warmly that she felt
more and more that never until women were placed on the

“Yes,” agreed her hostess, shivering over a blazing fire.

honesty to remind her. “No dinner—and it’s just striking

“Don’t l” wailed the Captain's wife.

Some hours later, a happy, washed and be-ribboned Babe
came dancing down to breakfast and went out with her
mother's opera-glasses to sweep the offing for some trace of
the missing craft. She swept in vain, and came dancing in
“For all we know

again with a most tactless remark.
“I spects they're having
a nice warm breakfast now at the Haven Hotel,” she said,
and plunged into her porridge.
We went silently upstairs to try to remove all appearance
of having passed a night in the train.
When they came home at three o'clock in the afternoon,
having dug out The Ark with spades, we overwhelmed them
with feminine sympathy. Could anything, we asked, be
more cruel than the way brave men were sacrificed to duty,
while women and children in the shelter of their homes
merely sat up all night for them 2 “Sit down,” we begged,
“sit down and eat your dinner, your breakfast, and your
luncheon before you speak one word ' "
They sat down, rather unwillingly, we thought. “You
see,” began the Crew, “you see, there was a meap tide——”
“Yes,” chimed in the Captain eagerly, “it got neapier and
neapier x -
“Yes,” echoed the Crew, “neapier and neapier and
meapier and——”
“So we simply had to abandon the ship to its fate for
the time being,” ended the Captain on a high soprano note.
“Yes,” shrilled the Crew, “yes.”
The Visitor observed that they did not seem so very
hungry considering they had not touched food for nearly
twenty-four hours.
“And you have both shaved,” added the Captain's wife in
a tone of icy calm.
The Babe was crooning to her doll, “So the women and
children was landed and sat through the watches of the night,
a prey to horrid thoughts, while the gallant Captain—
Daddy, were you comfy last night at the Haven Hotel ?”
There was one of those long deep pauses which make
England's homes what they are.

The fateful moment arrived.' 'lomas
presented me with a ball called the
Colonel, and a caddie offered meThomas's

what sort of tee I should like.
I leant upon my club and looked at

“Our young friend Hector,” I said,

“I think a medium one. Slow to

The preliminaries being arranged, I
proceeded to address the ball. My own
instinct was to take the address as read
and get to business as soon as possible,
but in the presence of an expert like
Hector I did not dare to omit the
trimmings. As it was, after every
waggle I felt less and less like hitting
the Colonel. When at last I did let fly
it was with feelings of relief that I dis-
covered, on returning my eye to the spot,
that the tee was indeed empty. I shaded
my eyes and gazed into the middle
distance.
“No,” said Thomas, “it’s more to the
right.” He indicated a spot in the
foreground, about ten yards E.N.E.
“There you are.” -
“That isn't my ball?”
“Yessir,” said Hector, grinning.
“May I have it back?”
into the blue. “You go on from there,”
he said.
“I’m still aiming at the same flag”

I went on. The ball again rolled ten
yards to the east. - -

Colonel is taking this seriously. He
doesn't seem to me to be trying at all.
Has he ever been round
before?”
“Never. He's quite new to it.”
“There you are. He'll come down
at the ditch for a certainty.”
I played my third. A third time we
went ten yards to the east–well, per-
haps a touch of north in it again. And
this time Hector gave a sudden snort of
laughter.
I leant upon my club, and stared him
into gravity. Then I took Thomas by
the coat and led him on one side.
“There are, Thomas,” I said, “other
things than golf.”
“There are,” he agreed.
“A man may fail temporarily at the
game and yet not be wholly despicable.”
“True.”
“He may, for instance, be able to
dance the pavane with grace and dis-
tinction.”
“Quite so.”
“Well then, will you take this giggling

For heaven's sake make him understand
that my reputation does not stand or
fall with my ability to use this brassy
thing. I'm not a golf professional.”
Thomas allowed himself to smile. “I
will tell him,” he said, “that you are not
golf professional.”
We veered right round to the east
with my fourth, and then I became
desperate.
“Why,” I shouted, “do I hit the ball
with a ridiculous club like this 2 I
could send it farther with a cricket bat.
I could push it straighter with a billiard
cue. Where's that bag? I am going to
have a lucky dip.”
I dipped, and came up with what
Thomas calls a cleek. “Now them,” I
said. I didn't stop to address the
Colonel, I simply lashed at him. He
flew along the ground at a terrific pace.
“Well kept down,” said Thomas
admiringly. -*
“By Jove,” I cried, “that's never
going to stop. See how he flies along
now he breasts the slope . . . look,
he is taking the water jump . . . ah,
he has crossed his legs, he's down. . .
“This,” I said to Thomas as we
walked after the Colonel, “is golf. A
glorious game.
“What nonsense,” I said to Thomas,
“they put in comic papers about golf.
All that about digging up the turf
and missing the ball ! . . . and
breaking the clubs I mean, I simply
don't see how one could. Let's see,

“What I am wondering,” he added,
“is why you should have been afraid of
using any club in your small island off

Twenty strokes after.
“The green, the green,” I shouted
joyfully, in the manner of the ancient
Greeks, though I was only on the edge

down.

Divisions may be missed (when the doors are locked), or
multiplied (when Sir F. BANBURY is present), or avoided
(when a deal has taken place).
According to the frequency of his Divisions the many |
electors add reputation to the elected one, or subtract it from
him. Yet the elected may enter the door and afterwards
pass the Tellers without knowing why he has voted for what.
Compare the common phrases of the Division Lobbies:-
“What's this we’re rotir out 2" “Is this the Closure ?”
“I don't know, they tola ºne to come in here’”; “I saw
IIarold Cor in the other lobby, so I came into this one.”
IV. A SPEECII.
A method of spending breath without profit, and time
without amusement. -
A speech may be prolonged to infinity without meeting
any arguments.

[October 13, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LORDS AND “THE CHRONIG."
THE Lords must go: that is certain.
They have failed all round. Not only
do they threaten the people's rights but
they have even lost their old manners.
Once upon a time, however headstrong
and foolish the Lords might be in
politics, they did practise the ordinary
courtesies of society. If you asked them
a question they replied to it. But now
all that is changed.
On Monday we sent a telegram in
these words to every member of the
House of Lords:–
“Trade of the Country is suffering
by uncertainty which exists as to fate
of Finance Bill. - Now that Bill is prac-
tically settled by House of Commons,
Editor of ‘Daily Chronic' would esteem
favour if Lord — would say what he
intends to do about it.”
A moderate enough request, one would
think, and one the answer to which
is generally required. No self-respect-
ing editor could do less than put it.
In order that the chances of getting no
answers might be reduced, we paid six-
pence on each telegram for a reply—in
the aggregate an immense sum.
And what happened? Will it be
believed that only three Peers gave a
| satisfactory and straightforward answer;
all honour to them! Earl DE LA
WARR, consummate statesman as he is,
although nominally a Conservative, sent
us at once six hundred words, or five
hundred and eighty-eight more than
we had bargained for; but the novelty
and rapture of being addressed at such
length by a peer compensated us for
the expense. His reply was a trenchant
defence of the Budget, and an intima-
tion that he should vote for it when it
reached the Gilded Chamber. The
Marquis TownsheXD replied at once:—
“Shall not be present.”
Here is a manly pronouncement, a model
of straightforwardness which we invite
some of his so-called peers to imitate.
Earl RossLYN was equally explicit and
courteous :-
“Shall be at Monte Carlo.”
Some of the Peers whom we addressed
sent non-committal replies. Even these,
however, are not without their interest,
although it is more on the human than
on the political side. As one reads these
little sheets of rustling thin paper one
wonders if it is possible to wrest from
them the secret of the writer's opinions.
What, for instance, was behind the cool,
calculating, and massive brain of Lord
RoſiſsCHILD when he sat in his great
office in St. Swithin's Lane, and wrote
the following telegram, and sent it to
the post-office in Cannon Street:—
“In answer to your message, there
is no doubt, I think, that the trade of
the country is suffering, but this is on
account of the provisions of the Budget,
and not for any other reasons connected
with it. I shall do what I shall do.”
This is a masterpiece of evasion, and
one cannot but humbly and respectfully
admire the author of it. Lord ROTH-
SCHILD was, of course, not under any
obligation to answer our question, but
the manner in which he has replied to
our telegram, while ignoring the query,
is beyond all praise.
This is comparatively polite, if uncivil.
There are several other evasive answers
that are contemptible in their want of
common decency to members of the
Fourth Estate. Lord LINDLEY, for
example, actually brought himself to
reply thus:— -
“Do not know ; ask no more.”
The meaning of the first three words
is beyond dispute: Lord LINDLEY does
not know what he will do when the
Finance Bill reaches the House of Lords.
The second three words are problemati-
cal, but we fancy we know their mean-
ing. His lordship's telegram was sent
from Mulbarton, in Norfolk, five-and-a-
half miles from Norwich. “Ask no
more” is the wearied cry of a man en-
joying a well-earned holiday, far from
the turmoil of the Legislature, who does
not wish to be troubled with any more
editorial inquiries. Well, it shall never
be said that we on The Chronic are in-
capable of taking a hint. We shall be
very careful never again to ask Lord
LINDLEY anything.
Worse remains. Lord LINDLEY is simply
rude; but what of the cowards? Here
is the reply from Chislehurst Park, the
seat of the Earl of Chislehurst:—
“Lord Chislehurst is too unwell to
reply.”
There's a champion answer.
he 2 We don't wonder. And he 's
going to be worse. They all are. The
Peers are in for a pretty hot time, if we
have our way, and mean and tricky little
subterfuges like this won't help them
much. For, of course, Lord Chislehurst
isn't ill at all: he's simply hiding. He
daren't come out into the open and
show his hand.
Again, this is what we get from
Milford House :-
“Lord Milford out of town.”
Now there's a foxy answer. Look at
it well. Carry it to the light. Take the
reading-glass. “Lord MILFORD out of
town.” Did you ever see a statement
that so palpably bore on its face all the
insignia of evasion ?
So much for the replies, the paucity
and tone of which, always excepting
the noble Earl DE LA WARR, speak
volumes for the decay of the old prim-
ciple, Noblesse oblige. As for those who
did not reply, we have no words to
Unwell, is
express our scorn and contempt. Apart
from the loss of money—some hundreds
of telegrams, reply paid—it strikes us as
shoddy conduct in the extreme. That
the Lords, must go is now more than
ever certain.
THE SONG OF THE DIRT.
(With abject apologies all round.)
[“‘Dr. Cook was the dirtiest white man I
ever saw,” said Mr. Whitney, who, after the
explorer had rested, ‘worked on him for nearly
half a day with hot water and a brush.’ He
found Dr. Cook ‘nothing but skin and bones,'
and had difficulty at first in distinguishing him
from the Eskimos.”—Press.]
With fingers frozen and numb,
But with eyes the colour of hope,
A man in latitude 82 -
Was plying a brush and soap-
Scrub—scrub-scrubſ
(So hard that it must have hurt)
And all the time in a minor key
He sang the “Song of the Dirt!”
“Scrub—scrub-scrub
While the water is cooling fast,
And scrub—scrub-scrub,
As hour after hour drags past.
It's O ! for a glimpse of pink;
If only on flesh I could look 1
'Twould make me scrub with vigour
afresh,
If I knew it was really Cook!
“Scrub—scrub—scrub
Till I almost begin to sob,
Scrub—scrub-scrub
Will this brush last out the job?
Nose and forehead and ears,
Ears and forehead and nose,
How I long to be in a Christian land
Where a fellow could borrow a hose !
“The shape I am trying to clean
Is nothing but skin and bone,
Yet but for the terrible dirt
It seems so like my own;
It seems so like my own ;
Poor chap ! it makes me weep
To think that soap should be so dear
And ice should be so cheap.
“Scrub—scrub—scrub 1
My labour never flags,
And what shall I get?–A par or two
In the half-penny evening rags.
But there, I mustn't complain,
My name would never be seen
In even the most obscure of prints,
If Cook had been fairly clean "
With fingers frozen and numb,
But with eyes the colour of hope,
A man in latitude S2
Was plying his brush and soap-
Scrub –scrub—scrub
(So hard that it must have hurt)
And all the time in a minor key-
Which must have been jolly for Dr. C. 1–
He sang this “Song of the Dirt!”

“ARMS AND THE MAN.”
[Lines attributed to one of those Socialists who
have recently refused to acknowledge any con-
nection between themselves and the Territorial
Army.]
LET others, with mistaken zeal,
Prepare to gall th’ invader's heel
With dreadful shot and awful steel
And things that burst;
Before the noble-minded, free,
And gentle Socialist will be
In any way concerned, he’ll see
Them further first.
They are but slaves, who walk, and run,
Hither and thither--rain or sun–
Carry a rifle, serve a gun,
And creep and crawl
As tyrants bid them; they must do
Exactly what they're ordered to ;-
It wouldn't be the thing for you
Or me, at all.
Men of our independent mould
Are little used to being told
To do our silly job and hold
Our silly tongue;
Yet, if we tried to state our views
On doing what we might not choose,
My comrades, in a brace of twos,
They'd have us hung !
It may be very well to save
Your native land (which rules the wave)
From alien enemies who crave
That noble site;
But who are we to lend a hand?
We tell them that it's not our land;
The dukes and classes have it, and
They'd better fight.
Ah, no! Let those prepare to bleed
That scorn our Socialistic creed ;
We, brothers, who are all agreed
To stand alone,
May still pursue our settled plan
Of taking everything we can
From every other class of man
Except our own.
The only point we have to win
Is decent safety for the skin;
And, even if the foe comes in
And makes a fuss,
The Territorials, no doubt,
Will promptly come and turn them out;
They can't defend themselves without
Defending us. DUM-DUM.

[To the great inconvenience of many foreign
competitors, The Aero Club has laid its ban on
the Doncaster flying week because it clashes
with another at Blackpool, to which the Club
has extended its sanction.]
SUBURBAN lady clerks who are in the
habit of simply flying for their trains in
the mornings are warned that the Aero
Club will not permit this method of
progress at any time that coincides with
the Blackpool Aviation Meeting.
All migratory birds that have not yet
left our shores must take notice that
flight will not be permitted on the days
of Blackpool's flutter.
Defaulting trustees are informed that
during next week any sudden departure
from this country that may be termed
flight will be rigorously refused sanction
by the Aero Club.
Master James Martin and his brother,
of Streatham, who had completed all
arrangements for a kite-flying contest
on the Common with their uncle John
next Tuesday, have received a registered
letter from the Secretary of the Aero
Club to say that this thing is not to be.

THE CALL.
DFAR BROWNE-SMYTH,-Calls are of four
qualities: the telephone call, the call
on hostesses who supply free meals to
deserving bachelors, the call of the
blood, and the call to the Bar. Yours is
to be of the fourth quality. Keep your
cars open and, when you hear the
Benchers of your Inn calling on the
seventeenth of this month, indicate by
a brief gesture that you are there. I
cannot help thinking that you have
been successful with your examinations,
or the Benchers would not be making
all this noise. Let me congratulate you
upon having completely deceived a
reputedly intelligent set of examiners.
If the immediate awe of your relatives
permits them to jest at all they will pro-
bably make some humorous reference to
other less respectable but more profitable
bars. There's many a true word spoken
in, etc. Having qualified yourself by a
course of three years' dinner-eating, you
will finally become a barrister by one
night's drinking. Between you and
me, this “call” is a euphemistic way of
describing a little razzle-dazzle with the
Benchers. For you, the razzle-dazzle
will consist of one glass of port, sherry,
or marsala.
For this night only you will be GREAT,
not only in the eyes of your proud
parents, but also in those of the Pro-
fessional News Distributors, Match Mer-
chants, and Gentlemen at Large who
hang round the entrances to the Temple.
They are sufficiently in the know to see
what it is all about, but are not so over-
fed with the prospect of beautiful young
men in evening dress as to despise them.
Make the most of your “moment,” for
this one glass of port will cost you up-
wards of £100, and drink at that price
per glass is not to be tossed off lightly
or to be upset carelessly down the shirt
front.
Make the most of yourself by idle
boasting of the future and frequent
appearances in the new wig and gown
afterwards. It will take all your efforts
to keep the popular interest alive. Your
most enthusiastic female relatives will
lose all interest, and even contrast you
unfavourably with poor Cousin Tom who
makes £90 a year in a bank, unless you
are made Attorney-General within a
month of your call. Be thankful that
they do not in these days insist on the
Woolsack for you, but also do not be
too certain of this Attorneyship. The
next election, I am told, cannot take
place much before January, and, even
if the results necessitate a change of
Law Officers, there are reasons, which I
am not at liberty to reveal, why they
may not hit on you for their Attorney-
General.
Finally, keep your copy of The Times
of the day after your call, in which that
great incident is mentioned. It will be
the last gratuitous reference to you in
public print for about five years. The
next one, when it comes, will be in the
local rag of some unknown circuit town,
where a prisoner will be lucky enough
to be prosecuted by you. It will be
only because the reporter was not com-
petent enough to make the observation,
or the editor not bold enough to print
the statement, if that notice omits to
mention how thoroughly badly you con-
ducted the prosecution.
Your Fellow-sufferer, Robinson.
Why Men Rest their Feet on Chairs.
“According to a social authority the mascu-
line habit of resting the feet upon another chair
than the one occupied by the sitter has its
origin in the instinct of self-preservation.”
- Weekly Scotsman.
We agree. We've tried putting our
feet on the same chair as the one occu-
pied by the sitter (ourselves), and it
isn't anything like so self-preservative.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FRoM TIIE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, October 4.
—Wasn't it HAZLITT who made shrewd
observation that in a transpontine theatre
no one ever heard conclusion of sentence
beginning, “A man who raises his hand
against a woman except in kyindness
” So quick and thunderous was
applause of gallery that the actor's voice
was lost in the roar. In the matter of
chivalry towards womankind the Com-
mons yield first place to nobody. This
makes all the more significant the
chilling reception which greets appeals
made from time to time for imprisoned
Suffragettes.
This doubtless largely due to per-
sonality of self-appointed champion.
Though, as the name indicates, DoN’t
KEIR HARDIE's principles are based on
negations, he is particularly alive to
opportunity of asserting himself when
gratuitous advertisement is forward,
whether the objects of his passionate
sympathy dwell in India or in London.

dressed to Hoyle SECRETARY with intent
to show that Suffragettes are being in-
humanly tortured in Birmingham Gaol.

neither painful in process nor harmful
in result. Food prepared in the ordi-
mary way is ready for the women if
they will take it. If not, the prison
authorities cannot be accessories to
deliberate suicide. Therefore nourish-
ment is administered.
No one rises to back up DoN'T KEIR
HARDIE in his latest crusade. On the
other hand, cheers from both sides ap-
prove action of authorities, as described
by UNDER SECRETARY.
The MEMBER FOR SARK wants to know
who finds the money for this unwomanly
farce. The Suffragettes can't go riding
about in chariots for nothing, bedeck-
ing themselves with ribbons and giving
bountiful breakfasts to each other on
coming out of prison. Nor can they
pay the expenses of spinsters of all ages
living humdrum lives in the country
who jump at opportunity of a free trip
to London, free food and lodgings, with
prospect of seeing their obscure names
in the newspapers. It must cost some-
thing in the way of travelling expenses
down to Kent to buffet Ministers on the
golf links, and fling stones through their
drawing-room windows under shelter of
night. Who pays?
At outset of campaign husband of
one of the women cast solitary gleam of
humour on turbulent scene by an-
nouncing that he would contribute £10
a week to the cause as long as his wife
was kept in prison. That source of

Tuesday. --This the forty-sixth and
penultimate sitting in Committee on
Budget Bill. Time land was in sight.
Things going hard with crew on weather-
beaten barque. Many absent when muster
called. The SPEAKER, who, owing to
habitual sitting in Committee, has been
practically a half-timer, fled for a while
to his northern home. EMMOTT, whose
health improves under extra strain of
work, doubles his part. In Question
time sits in SPEAKER's Chair. When
Mace removed from Table, hey, presto!
becomes Chairman of Committees.
Liquor licences being to the fore,

Hardly had House met when he has to
leave post-haste for Balmoral, sum-
moned to presence of his Sovereign.
Members nudge each other. Shrewdly
suspect this has some bearing on pend-
ing fight 'twixt Lords and Commons.
PREMIER rushes off to catch Scotch ex-
press. Leaves INFANT SAMUEL in charge.
Someone with domestic instincts suggests
a “small bottle.” CilairMAN rules that,
clause of Bill dealing with that subject
being passed, further reference is out
of order. So the INFANT's feeding must
take its chance.
Members settle down to what promises
to be dull night. Forecast not belied.
FABER read what from tone of voice and
subdued attitude suggested Last Speech
and Dying Confession prior to execu-
tion. Was merely moving amendment
omitting the words “Making the duty
equal to half the annual value of the
licensed premises.” BEL Loc — whose
name WINSTON wilfully pronounces as iſ
it were spelt Bellow—momentarily raised
drooping spirits. His oratorical manner
marked by cheery peculiarity. Starts
speech with sudden shout, a sort of View
Halloa which recalls to old Members
memories of the hunt.
What BELLoc wants to whisper in ear
of House is suspicion that Ministers are
suborned by the arts and purses of
millionaire cocoa-manufacturers. Look-
ing into the cocoa cup, he discerns
depths of infamy compared with which
tumblers of toddy are home-blessings in
disguise.
HALL WALKER so moved by discovery
of treason in our midst that he contri-
buted most original idea that has yet
flashed through debate. Protest being
made against alleged design of Govern-
ment to extinguish small licensed houses,
gallant Colonel deployed in their defence.
Declared axiom that public-house is,
perhaps next to garments, absolute
necessity for working-man.
“Fact is,” he said, “every working-
man requires two public-houses – one
near his home, one near his work.”
Member below Gangway, not to be out-
done in generosity, suggested another
midway, so that going and coming
Weary Willie might drop in. No; HALL
WALKER a man of moderate views. Not
to be dragged into extremes. - A public-
house, say next door but one to his resi-
dence, another three doors distant from
his workshop, should suſlice any reason-
able labourer.

right bucolic spirit.]
SEASON, when the skies are fainter,
Spirit of the golden sheaves,
Whom the mythologic painter
Up in London town conceives
Not inelegantly bodiced
In a gown that's far from modest,
Principally made of flowers and leaves.
Autumn, would you have me utter,
When I see your boons dispersed,
Lots of laudatory butter,
Me of Little Medlinghurst?
Hymn you like the writing fellows
Whom romantic moonshine mellows,
Folks that ain't been country-born and
nursed?
Shall I mention how Demeter
Gathers in the girded shucks?
How the happy peasants greet her
Laughing as the laden trucks
Leave their trails, as bright as
guineas,
Hanging from the roadsidespinneys?
No, that's not the way we talk in
Bucks.
Yellow grain and bursting berry--
Think you these would make us glad?
Was there ever time so merry
British hearts could not be sad?
Bravely though the wheat be smiling,
Someone's oats are always spiling,
Turmuts too be ruination bad.
So it is through all the county;
Times in Pulborough is hard ;
Notwithstanding “Ceres' bounty"
There's a mort of mangels marred ;
Let the city poets render
Tributes to your blazing splendour.
Much they know of England, says the
bard.
Ay, and if you choose to tumble
“Cornucopias” about
Till there bain't no ground to grumble,
Still the future hangs in doubt:
We'd be laying up, remember,

Either too much rain or too much
drought.

The announcement that Mr. John

secured this treasure at a much lower
figure. - -
It is, however, stated on good autho-
rity that immediately after the great
dock strike Mr. BURNS began to prepare
a book on the relation of SHAKSPEARE to
the Labour movement, but political work
crowded upon him, and the book still
remains to be written. -

The most remarkable of
these is that locus desperatus

“These are the youths that

flashed into my mind that it
would indeed complete my
enjoyment of a sojourn in
this land of rugged beauty
if I might be favoured with
some word from his lips. As
he folded his napkin some-
thing impelled me to seize
the opportunity ere it was

approaching him with dig-

addition which Mr. BURNS suggests to
the words:–

that the words “Government Board ”

to seize his hand and in broken tones

you call me “Horace’?”
His valet cut short our conversation
by reminding my leader of his train, and
so he left me, bestowing on me another
smile. Thus am I favoured above most

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
PEOPLE who regard with righteous indignation and not a
little personal loathing the mere possibility of a burglar
couchant under their bed o'nights, gather round the cracks-
man of fiction in admiring crowds. If their criminal care-
fully divests his crime of every possible extenuation, steals
because he likes stealing and happens to be called Raffles,
their enthusiasm becomes unbounded. Mr. HoRNUNG was to
be congratulated in the beginning of things for boldly
recognising this innate immorality of the reader and allowing
his hero-villain no merit save good sportsmanship. But is
he to be congratulated either on protracting the existence of
the popular idol, or on finding for him a dully virtuous end
to justify his charmingly disreputable means? With all its
easy style, occasional humour and pleasant seasoning of love
interest, Mr. Justice Itaffles (SMITH, ELDER) rarely rises
above the level of everyday criminal fiction. The devices
employed for the rescue of friends from the clutches of a
moneylender are hardly ingenious enough to be worthy of
crown than the majority of those for which six shillings is
charged.
In his first essay in romance, Anne Inescourt (GRIFFITHs),
MARCUS SERVIAN shows a nice sense of character, and not
merely of the kind that carries a label and lives in a pigeon-
hole. His dialogue, too, is taken down from the living
voice. Such signs of inexperience as one expects from an
untried hand betray themselves rather in his narrative style,
which lacks, at any rate in the first part of his book, the
right note of confident simplicity. The story itself, on the
other hand, moves forward naturally enough to the tragedy
of its conclusion, asking no assistance from those strained
coincidences and melodramatic shocks which are apt to occur
in a first trial of strength. The scheme of the book is a
bold one, for it takes a fairly courageous writer to disregard
popular sentiment and to demonstrate how poor in actual
life are the chances of poetic justice when it runs up against
the cussed irony of things. Here a good man's happiness is
ruined, not through the faithlessness of his wife, but through
his own fidelity to the word of honour by which he was
pledged to take her back if she wanted to return—a promise
the amateur cracksman, and,
on which her cowardice

press-notices proclaim her
one of their best-established favourites, serving up, in Poppea
of the Post-Office (The MACMILLAN Co.) material that was thread-
bare in these islands before the days of DICKENs. In an early
chapter we hear how the pretty wife of rich and proud
John Angus was driven from home by her husband's cold-
ness, and how, some time later, baby Poppea was found
abandoned on the steps of the village post-office. The child
is adopted by old postmaster Gilbert, and brought up as his
own; but years afterwards, when she has grown into the
heroine of the tale, and proud John Angus has married and
lost another wife, chance reveals Poppea to be none other than
his own daughter by the ill-treated first. Well, with no desire
to swagger about it, I must say that personally I guessed that
in one. John Angus has also a son, a cripple, whom he
treats with jealous affection, forbidding him the friendship
of his half-sister at the post-office, and generally behaving
in an overbearing and Dombey-ish manner, which I only
did not mind because I was so sure that he would relent
in the end. As indeed was the case. Seriously, however,
there are features in the book that redeem the somewhat
fustian character of its plot; the picture it gives of rural life
in America at the time of the Civil War is one, and another
is a certain delicacy of writing that I would like to see more
worthily employed. It is published at five shillings, a
reduction that appears to have been rendered possible by the
quality of the paper, though it is far better worth half-a-

the National Anthem of that unique race whose legend has

such should be the cry of all Nice Children as soon as they
set eyes on this herald of the season of Delectable Books.
FLORA and LANCELOT SPEED, the authors of The Limbersnigs,
seem, between them, to know exactly what is wanted in this
kind. The story, simply and very freshly told, with just the
right touches of irresponsible fun, serves as an excellent
thread on which to hang the pictures. Some in harmonies
of brilliant colours, some in black-and-white, Mr. SPEED has
painted and drawn them with so generous a fancy and a
humour so lavish of detail that we are never done with them,
and don't want to be. The plan of the Limbersnigs' castle
and the map of their city are alone an occupation for a week.

people produce a better book for children, I should like to
hear of it.
“In an interview Mr. Orville Wright said he had never flown so high
before. He estimated the altitude at 500 metres. It took him five
minutes to ascend and only five minutes to descend. The downward
speed was simply terrifying.”—The Glasgow Herald.
A little under four miles an hour is indeed a terrifying
speed. He must have been scared with wondering if he
would ever get to earth again.

Of knights and dragons,

relatives, friends and acquaintances. My
enemies do not count. It is unlikely
that they would ever claim the right of
having just one try on my typewriter,
and, if they did, I could refuse them.
Father evinced no desire to typewrite.
He is a man of business, and to him
these machines are neither the beginning
of luxury nor the last word in jests.
The lady who has very kindly pro-
mised to marry me, for those same
reasons which induced father to give me
the typewriter, had something very, very
sweet to typewrite. Unfortunately the
machine would not write it.
All the sisters, female cousins, less
intellectual acquaintances, and infants
in arms wrote:—
“TH} j£eSt is veqqrqqy = (”
or words to that effect.
George (an acquaintance) occasionally
contributes odd verses to the Press. He
typewrote:–

He did not take the trouble to write
all that because he had any affection for
typewriting machines. Simply, he wrote
because he loves to hear himself writing.
George (the same George) insisted on
having another go:—
“It is the schooner Hesperus!
A worthy barque, but not for us,
Who much prefer a motor-bus.
The skipper has taken his little
daughter.
One wonders had the skipper oughter?
Perhaps she does not like the water.”
George said that that had just occurred
to him. It appears that it had also
previously occurred to one of George's
writing friends.
Cousin Frank examined the machine
with great circumspection, made some
reference to “bally pianists,” and then
wrote with great difficulty:-

It is supposed that nothing but
Cousin Frank's colossal ignorance and
incompetence prevent him from being
a thoroughly wicked man.

“THE AUTOGRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE."
[In discussing the “growing increase in the cost of living,” an
evening paper mentions that bacon now ranks with the best cuts of
beef, and eggs for cooking cost 1d more per dozen.]
THE price of beef went up; I did not grudge it;
They said the loaf was dearer; what cared I?
The bristling leaders on a baleful Budget
Left me a mugwump still without a sigh:
Baccy and beer were blowed, but now I waken
To drain the teacup and its tannin'd dregs,
If dearth shall reave me of my morning bacon,
Topped by its two poached eggs.
Some deem the deathless birthright of the Briton
The football that he flicks with flying feet,
His Parliament, his Press; and some have written
Their sagas round his sirloins and his Fleet:
But not the bard: I know that breasts are oaken
Because (maybe by AELFRED's dying wish)
On ham and eggs their nightlong fast is broken—
(We need not note the squish).
Some Atheling, I believe, in bygone ages,
Cooked them before the fight, and gave his men
The courage of the boar-pig when he rages,
The blithe abandon of the farmyard hen;
And shall I shirk the furious fray (like Ashur)
And not assail some party for its sins
When dearer grows the immemorial rasher
And rare the heavenly twins 2
Hard by the open sweetness of the heather,
In taverns underneath the fir-crowned hill,
In every aspect of our glorious weather,
Have I not put them down, and paid the bill?
The yolk that gushes out, the grease that hardens,
They come with memories of the moor and lea,
Or linked with “wet, bird-haunted” English gardens,
Or lodgings by the sea.
Better to heed the siren voices singing
Of Socialism, and prices bound to drop,
Than lose our “semper eadem” by ringing
The matutinal change on fish and chop;
England is England still so long as morning
Wih plenishment of gold and crimson cheers
The platters of her hinds and those adorning
The sideboards of her peers.
SHADOWS FROM THE PAST.
HistoRY.
In my memory the clouds roll back and dissolve a little,
and I see a pack of little boys trooping into a class-room.
“Why are we going in here P’’ says one to another.
“History,” says the other.
“What's history?”
“Oh, I don't know: some rot or other.
things.”
“Dates? What are dates?” -
“WILLIAM THE CoNQUEROR and WILLIAM RUFUS and all that.
They told us to learn them. They’re a frightful swot.”
“Have you learnt them 2"
“Some. Haven't you?”
“No ; I don't know anything about them; never heard
we were to learn them.”
“Then you'll catch it hot.
He's sarcastic.”
By this time the boys are settled into their places, and the
master is at his raised desk. A pale thin man he is, with
Dates and
Hammond's an awful chap.
black mutton-chop whiskers and dark hair fading away from
a high forehead. I can see his hands now as if I had them
before me. Strong sinewy hands with long straight fingers
and nails beautifully polished and trimmed. He wears a
signet-ring on the third finger of his right hand, and he
has an uncomfortable habit of making dents with its edge
all over the thick skulls of the ignorant. How we came to
loathe that signet-ring !
“We will begin with the dates of the Sovereigns of England,”
says the master. “You were all told to learn them, and I shall
expect perfect accuracy. Dickson”—he addresses the boy
who hasn't learnt them—“you begin.” The anguish of
Dickson cannot be described. Latin grammar had been bad
enough ; dictation was a hateful torment; and now, on the
top of it all, came dates. Why must he learn dates? Did
his father know dates ? Why had his father never mentioned
dates at home? Why had he been left in ignorance of this
fearful mystery 2 Nothing was any good at all! Some day,
very soon, he should die, and then, perhaps “Dickson,”
says the smooth voice of the master, “I told you to begin.
We are all waiting your pleasure.”
“There,” says Dickson to himself, “he's begun his
sarcasm; ” but he says no word aloud.
“Dickson,” reiterates the master, “pray oblige me by
beginning at the beginning. It is generally considered a
good place to begin at. Now then.”
“WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR,” prompts a helpful small boy
under his breath.
Dickson catches the casual suggestion, and repeats it aloud,
doggedly and despairingly. “WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR,” he
says, and pauses.
“Proceed, my Dickson,” says the master blandly but
ominously. “Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once
more.”
“What does he mean?” thinks the victim, and aloud he
says once more, “WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.”
“Ten sixty-six,” prompts the helpful one, and Dickson,
about to sink as it were for the third time, snatches at the
straw, grasps it imperfectly, and in a loud clear voice says,
“Tens into six.”
“Tens into what?” thunders the master.
“Into six,” pleads Dickson.
“Tens into six never did go, and they won't go to-day.
Have you made any attempt to learn these dates ?”
“No, Sir–I—please, Sir-I didn't x -
“I thought not. You'll be kept in next Wednesday
afternoon, and you can then apply your mind—ha, ha-
to them. And Stephens will stay in too for prompting so
feebly. Are you suffering in your throat, Stephens?”
“No, Sir, not much.”
“Never mind, you'll be better after Wednesday.”
At this point the clouds thicken and roll back again, and
I remember no more.
Yet stay—there is one more incident of the history lesson
that returns to me. It happened, I fancy, on a different
day, when there was reading aloud.
“That'll do, Oakley,” says the master. “Go on, Hope.”
Hope is a small fat brown boy with a mop of most
rebellious hair. He rises in his place and begins very
gallantly: “Everything being now ready, the English fleet
set sail with a fair wind and arrived safely at * x
“Don't give it up, Hope. England expects every boy to
do his duty. Now for it.”
Thus urged, Hope resumes: “set sail with a fair wind
and arrived safely at Bull—" Here he stops dead.
“Oh, Hope, a little courage.”
“—arrived safely at-Bullogen.”

[October 20, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE REFORMED HOUSE OF LORDS.
ENGLAND UNDER SOCIALISM.
The LoRD CHANCELLOR having taken
his seat on the camp-stool and the oath
of allegiance to the Social Democratic
Federation having been administered to
all the peers present,
The Duke of NorthumberLAND humbly
drew attention to a question of Privilege.
Since the Revolution of 1910, when
their Lordships had been turned out of
their House to admit of its being made
into a smoking-room for the Commons,
the disused shop in which their delibera-
tions were now held had gradually
become more dilapidated, and was now
being used as a skating-rink in the
evenings. To allow of this the House
had to cut short its debates on such im-
portant matters as the Empire (groans),
the Army (indignant murmurs), and the
Church (cries of “Talk of something
sensible!”). He moved to present a
humble petition to the Commons to rent
them a small flat somewhere in a suburb
of some sort.
The Earl of CREWE warned the ignoble
lord that any presumption would be
sternly repressed by the leaders of the
LABOUR PARTY. (Here all the peers present
rose and stood bare-headed.) He must
remember that the House of Lords was
now purely an establishment to provide
old-age pensions and outdoor relief for
the senile and useless of the aristocracy.
(Subservient cheers.) Their lordships
would kindly confine themselves to the
duties imposed upon them by the
Constitution of 1910—investigation of
the ventilation of houses, kitchen
finance, door-scrapers, cleaning of the
clocks and other matters not involving
greater expenditure than twenty-five
pounds.
The House having maintained a re-
spectful silence for a few minutes,
The Duke of WESTMINSTER, who apolo-
gised for the shabby state of his personal
appearance (due to his having been
suffering from a great deal of unearned
decrement of late), moved the second
reading of the Dukes and Bankrupts
Protection Bill. Speaking in both
capacities, his Grace appealed to their
Unfortunateships to support him in his
assertion that a peer had as much right
to consideration as any civil servant or
poor law guardian. (Murmurs.) Their
salaries of £100 a year compared very
unfavourably with the £500 paid to all
employees in the Post Office. If he
might speak without sarcasm, he threw
himself upon the honour and generosity
of the Party in power.
The second reading was defeated
without a division at the direction of the
LoRD CHANCELLOR.
Here BLACK Rod was announced and
informed their Lordships that the House
of Commons was ready to hand them
out their work for the day, and the
House adjourned. Resuming,
The Marquis of LANSDOWNE, who spoke
with a deep cough, introduced the
Peerage Housing and Town Planning
Bill. There was now an alarming infant
mortality among the families of the
nobility and landed gentry due to over-
crowding, and rack-rents were wrung
from these struggling classes to pay
fancy salaries to Socialist politicians and
pamper their children. He need only
point to the congestion in Mayfair and
Belgravia, the small size of the dwelling
houses in Park Lane and their leaky
condition. There should be no reason
why the children of a peer should not
grow up to be sober and honest citizens.
Great Britain could never prosper if
battened on the spoils of the helpless.
The Bishop of LONDON moved an
alteration in Schedule 2 of the Comsti-
tution relating to stationery. It was
degrading to their lordships to have to
use paper and envelopes of the tea-bag
type, while those supplied to the Lower
House—(Loud cries of “Order!”)—he
apologised deeply—to the Upper House
—were gilt-edged and hand-made, and
distributed in bulk to their most distant
acquaintances.
The Archbishop of CANTERBURY on
rising to second was ordered to resume
his seat, and
The motion was placed in the waste-
paper basket.
Lord MoRLEY moved the first reading
of the Votes-for-Peeresses Bill. These
women had not had a very agreeable
time of late, since the West End had
been laid out in cheap blocks of flats
and Polytechnics. Their only fault was
that they had married Peers, and that
should be sufficient punishment. The
wives of working men had all of them
votes—why not give them to Peeresses 2
The registration officials could easily
make them useless (laughter).
Being a Government measure, the
Bill was agreed to without a division,
their lordships standing uncovered.
The Sixteen Hours' Day for Mar-
quises Bill was read a third time.
The Two-Power-Standard in Work-
houses Bill was read a third time, and
At the direction of the police the
usual oath of submission to the Common-
wealth was taken, and their lordships
were searched and turned out for the
night.
“For various reasons the important mutiny
which should have been held last night in the
Jockey Club has been postponed until next
week.”—Buenos Aires Herald.
There cannot be many vacant dates for
revolutions and mutinies in South
America, and the Club was lucky to
find a convenient one so soon.
THE LATEST ABSURDITY.

To the Editor of “The Westminster
Gazette.”
Waily's Theatre.
You wicked man! Why have you
done this thing? This is the first time
in all his long career that Mr. Edward
Georges has had to read an unkindly
notice of a production of his. Every
year the same paean of praise fell to him
as his just due. “Splendid,” “mar-
vellous,” “unique,” “sumptuous”—the
noble words seemed to belong to him as
by divine right; crowned each time by
that majestic phrase, “Mr. Edward
Georges has once more surpassed
himself.”
And now what has happened? What
canker of spite and malice has eaten at
the heart of yourself and your critic 2
“Splendid,” “marvellous,” “unique,”
“a dream of beauty”—yes, you applied
these phrases to the scenery, the music,
the dresses and the players of The Tup-
penny Duchess, but of the book you
dared to hint (how can I bring myself
to repeat the word?) that it was “tire-
some”! Tiresome !
If you could but see Mr. Edward
Georges, even your stony heart would
melt. He is prostrated. Just now he
roused himself for a moment, and in a
voice shaken by sobs, with great tears
rolling down his cheeks, he commanded
me to inform you that he had decided
to withdraw all his advertisements from
your paper. But the effort was too
much for him. He sank back exhausted,
and now unconsciousness has mercifully
supervened. Diamond, Diamond, thou
little knowest what thou hast done!
Yours faithfully, THE SECRETARY.

libel. We are, Sir,

FLAGGING FRIENDSHIP.
[The Eustace Miles Restaurant is to be the
scene of a new experiment by the Round-About
Club. Little silk flags will be obtainable at the
door, and the donning of the flag will be an inti-
mation that the wearer is prepared to speak
and be spoken to.]
No longer shall it be my doom,
Thought I, to sit and munch
Alone amid a crowded room
My solitary lunch ;
No longer need Iglumly glower,
As stolid British phlegm does,
At faces that appear as sour
To me as mine to them does.
A new régime has dawned, said I,
When o'er the lentil bowls
Upon a signal souls will fly
To meet their sister souls.
So pondering I took my seat
And straightway bade the nimble
Young Hebe bring a steak of beet
And friendship's silken symbol.
Behind each proteid-laden plate
I sought to catch a sign
Of any mind that might be great
Enough to mate with mine;
But this one clearly would not suit,
And that one to the right of him—
The milk he poured upon his fruit
Had curdled at the sight of him.
But soon a glint of pearly teeth
Flashed on me where I sat ;
Two eyes of hazel glanced beneath
An Incroyable hat;
Two little curls of rarest red
Upon her forehead clustered,
And oh! the grace with which she spread
Her parsley chop with mustard!
Then fast and faster beat my heart
As I began to try
By every telepathic art
To catch her hazel eye.
At length-oh, bliss'—I saw her glance
In quite a friendly manner,
And filled with dreams of sweet romance
I hoisted friendship's banner.
But just when things seemed like to go
As they so seldom do,
The sour milk-curdler turned, and lo!
He wore a banner too.
He had me in his grip at once,
The points of nuts he mooted,
And ere I could escape the dunce
Dear Hazel Eyes had scooted.
THE “FAST" SET.
“A PERFECTLY healthy man,” writes
Mr. EskoLME WADE, who has been con-
ducting a controversy with Mr. EUGEN
SANDow in The Daily News, “might fast
for six months or more without the
slightest feeling of weakness, but, on
the contrary, with extraordinary benefit
to himself, physically, mentally and
spiritually.”
THE MAN AND
THE MOMENT.
Not content with giving mere literary
publicity to his creed, Mr. WADE has
just opened (we are reliably informed)
a charming diversorium in the neigh-
bourhood of Chandos Street, W., and
painted it a beautiful eau-de-nil colour.
The staff of waitresses consists entirely
of out-of-work Suffragettes, and votaries
of the new diet are already loud in its
praise. No material food of any kind
is served within its doors, the sole
charge being ld, for the napkin. An
inaugural luncheon, to which a number
of distinguished guests were invited,
was composed of the following menu:-
Potage à la bonne faim.
Jugged Air.
Mock Blancmange.
Café zéro.
Never before have the feast of reason
and the flow of soul been enjoyed in
such undiluted purity. A few testi-
monials from some of the survivors of
this ethereal orgie are to hand.
“The jolliest little luncheon I ever
had,” said S.Acco; and Lt.-Col. NEWN-
HAM – DAVIS was equally enthusiastic.
“Never,” he told our representative,
“have I had less strain put upon my
digestive powers.”
“I can only compare the sensation,”
admitted Mr. G. K. ChESTERTON, “to that
experienced on the Wiggle-waggle at
the White City, or during the sudden
ascension of a Tube lift. I went home
immediately afterwards and prepared a
Tremendous Trifle.”
“All the various grades of quality are on
show in our Blanket Department. They speak
for themselves.”—From a Circular.

WHEN, Jock, I saw you, debonair and bland,

When I observed your friendly little stare,
Your guileless baby face, your general air
Of “Golly, how on earth did I get there?"—

Of some Department gather round and bleat

Return at 3, and, having written “Dear

Duly received and noted"—disappear.
There are who do not hesitate to shove
Their views of Babes and Budgets, Life and Love
On paper—as it might be, up above;
Who, fearless fellows, are not found to flinch
When some Proprietor essays to pinch
Their holiest thoughts at eightpence for the inch.

Of (moderate) Fortune unrelieved by Fame.
But there are Nobler Souls about the place,
Such Spirits as have built this Island Race,
Heroes who must, who simply must, have space.
'Twas not to serve the Pen that Nature gave
To these their love of all that's large and brave;
For Them an ampler Life upon the Wave!
So when your father (while I mop the tea)
Says that he rather thinks you'll go to sea,
Dear Jock, sweet Jock, your uncle must agree.

SPILT MILK.
AMONG the inventions on view at the
Business Exhibition at Olympia is a
contrivance for delivering the morning
milk through a hole in the door. A
milk-can is suspended just inside, and
the milkman has a patent funnel which
automatically unlocks the covering of
the hole, so that the milk is delivered
straight into the can. Incidentally, if a
forgetful servant omits to hang up the
can, the milk is delivered straight on to
the floor.
We miss, however, some obvious
developments of this invention. What
is badly wanted at present is a self-

acting apparatus for unobtrusively intro-
ducing skilly or other nourishing fluid
food into the interior of a sleeping

There should be no need to hang up the

should be rendered impossible for an
inadvertent wardress to spill upon the

AT THE PLAY.
“DON.”
Ann Sinclair was engaged to Stephen
Bomington. Stephen (according to Mr.
RUDOLF BESIER, who as his creator
ought to know) was a great poet, but as
he did not recite any of his pieces on
the stage, I cannot say if it was indeed
so. But what is a fact is that he was a
chivalrous dreamer, an idealist who
took in The Daily News, a man who
was “interested in strikes.” Ann called
him “Don,” short for Don Quizote, as
she explains, not for Don Juan, as her
mother suggests. Well, Don had be-
The situation was viewed in different
ways.
General Sinclair believed the worst,
was furious, and asked for an A.B.C.
Mrs. Sinclair laughed and laughed
and laughed. It was too absurd. And
of course impossible.
Ann was very sweet. She trusted
Don implicitly, but had he not been
unchivalrous to her?
Canon Bonington felt strongly that no
man ought to come between a husband
and his wife. He did not believe the
worst, but he was shocked by Stephen's in-
terference with a Heaven-made marriage.
Mrs. Bonington knew it was all that
the municipal cow or chalk-
pit. There should also
be some means of rising
to the occasion in case of a
milk -burst or when the
passage is in spate, owing
to the negligence of the
domestic above hinted at.
Perhaps we may skim over
the difficulty by suggesting
an automatic churn that shall
produce butter or curds or
something for the breakfast
table. We are not going
to cry any further over spilt
milk.
AN ORIGIN.
THE young man gathered
his skins more tightly about
him and walked out into
the storm. He walked on
and on, brooding on his
own misery, until he came
to the seashore. There he
stood face to face with the
furious elements, filled with º º

designing minx, Mrs. Thomp-
sett. How eould they save
Stephen from scandal?
|Surely they could invent
some story. And if Mr.
Thompsett called he was to
be shown into the library
and she would see him.
And so, after we had
wondered for two Acts what
Thompselt was like and
what he would do and how
it could possibly end hap-
pily — when we had been
worked up to the pitch
(nearly) of screaming out,
“We will have Thompsett,
and we won't wait,”—then
he did call and was shown
into the library. And he
was Mr. NoryAN McKINNEL
—big, brutal, fanatic—with
but one word for everybody,
“I want my wife. Fetch my
wife.”
How does it end? I am
not going to tell you. All
through this splendid Third
Act, I kept saying to myself,
“It can't end. How can it
end?” Yet it did, quite
naturally and simply, by
no stage trick of suicide or
earthquake. You must go
the rude record of his feel-
ings. Not till the storm was exhausted
did he return to the village again.
A day or so later another skin-clad
figure walked that way gathering fuel.
He picked up without examining it the
flat piece scored by the young man and
added it to his store. When he reached
his hut his eye chanced upon the charac-
ters and symbols, and he scanned them
with a hurried eye. He frowned as he
threw it on the fire.
He was the first reviewer.

friended a poor girl in a tea-shop, and
had found her a situation as his mother's
companion. After she left, she married
Thompsett, a tradesman and a Plymouth
Brother, hard, narrow-minded, and cruel,
though with the best of motives—
a man who had “found salvation.”
Mrs. Thompsett stood a year of mental
and moral torture with him, and then
in despair wrote to Don and asked him
to help her. Quite naturally, as it
seemed to him, he took her away from
her husband, spent a night at Kettering
(I think it was) by her bedside—she had
collapsed in the train, and could not
continue the journey without a rest—
and on the next day brought her to his
mother's house, where Ann and her
people were staying.
and see for yourself—I know
you would not like to miss the finest
comedy in London.
The acting is worthy of the play.
Mr. CHARLES QUARTERMAINE had the most
difficult task, of course, and perhaps
he didn't quite pull it off; the others
had parts more incisively drawn and
well within the range. They all played
perfectly. I congratulate Mr. HERBERT
TRENCH on presenting, Mr. NorMAN
McKINNEL on producing, and (chiefly)
Mr. RUDOLF BEsier on writing one of the
most finely humorous plays that have

FROM OUR READERS.
(With acknowledgments to “The Daily Georgic.”)
Odious Comparisons.
I NOTE with pain that in a recent
issue you say in a grudging spirit of
Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE, “perhaps he comes
nearest to ABRAHAM LINCOLN of any of the
latter-day leaders of the Democracy.”
Could anything be more jejune and
inadequate than this niggardly tribute
to the splendidly human qualities of our
adored leader? LINCOIN had all the
defects of his qualities, the most
prominent of which was a morbid
moderation. The best that one of
his biographers can say of him was that
he was “fair and direct in speech and
action.” Indeed, so deplorably averse
was he from plain speaking that it is
said he would never allow the Con-
federates to be called rebels in his
presence | Such a man, were he now
alive, would probably show tenderness
to dukes and courtesy to ground land-
lords. Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE, on the other
hand, has none of this pitiful compunc-
tion. He preaches the gospel of a newer
and a nobler age for the common people.
He inculcates the sacred duty of class
hatred with the superb abandon of a
HANNIBAL or a TorquEMADA. He fears
not the rage and the sneers of the Smart
Set. We have had nothing quite like
him in British politics before, and
perhaps never shall again.

A Question of Colour.
I see that in your splendid description
of the peroration of Mr. LLoyd-GEORGE's
speech you say “a great gasp of emotion
passed down the rows of white faces,
like the soughing of an autumn wind
amid the trees.” May I, as a coloured
reader of your admirable and stimulating
organ, venture to observe that the
emotion was not confined to white
hearers. No one could have soughed
more strenuously than myself.
PoMPEY JETSAM.

The Chancellor's Predecessors.
I am glad to see that you eulogise the
delicious drollery of Mr. Lloyd-GEORGE's
magnificent Newcastle speech. Other
great orators have been pungent, have
been extravagant, have indulged in a
superfluity of ornamental invective, but
surely no one before him has contrived
to combine the spirituality of a MARCUS
AURELIUS with the forthrightness of a

says of the bewitching humour of the CHAN-
CELLoR of THE Exchequen, but is he not mixing
up Thersites with THESEUs or possibly Themis-
Tocles.—ED. D.G.]
The Burglar's Plea.
No part of Mr. LLoyd-GEORGE's fine
speech was greeted with greater enthu-
siasm than his superb vindication of the
rights of the poacher. Never before has
a Cabinet Minister openly proclaimed
the noble doctrine that the poacher has
the same right to the game as the man
who, besides being guilty of owning the
land, has spent large sums in rearing
and feeding his pheasants, etc. My
only complaint against the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER is that he omitted to
say a word on behalf of that much-
maligned person, the burglar. I
trust that when Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE
delivers his next great speech at Hol-
loway or Wormwood Scrubs he will
remedy this deficiency and speak up for
a most industrious, precariously remu-
nerated and tender-hearted class, for it
should never be forgotten that the late
Mr. CHARLEs PEACE was an accomplished
violinist and was extremely fond of
children.—W. SIKES.
[Our correspondent appears to us to read
more in the statement than was intended, The
context shows clearly that the ChancELLOR
spoke in a more or less jocular vein. Still,
the right of a burglar to the unearned incre-
ment of a duke has undoubtedly much to be
said for it. The anecdote of Mr. PEACE is most
touching.—ED. D.G.]
How to Secure Peace with Germany.
Few things have contributed more
happily to the establishment of a better
understanding with our great neighbour,
Germany, than the noble action of Herr
Elzbacher in changing his name to Mr.
Ellis Barker. Surely this is a precedent
which cannot be followed too frequently
or too thoroughly. But to be really
effective it must not be confined to one
side. If Germans are to take English
names, Englishmen must assume German
patronymics. I venture to subjoin the
following provisional list in the hope
that the persons mentioned will lose
no time in carrying out the necessary
formalities:
Mr. Lewis Harcourt . Herrludwig Horchhof.
Mr. Herbert Gladstone Herr Frohstein.
Mr. Alf. Mond . Mr. Half Moon.
Mr. Spender - . Herr Auſwender.
Mr. Winston Churchill Herr Kirchübel.

Mr. Lyons . - . Herr Löwenherz.
Mr. Gluckstein . . Mr. Gladstone.
Mr. Asquith - . Herr Mitfragen.

In conclusion may I suggest that you
should lend this movement a much
needed impetus by re-naming your paper

whom I repeated this joke was the Rev.
Canon Letts of this town, and I have his
word for it that he has neither repeated
it to anybody else nor forwarded it to
your paper. Unless you are prepared
to doubt the assurance of a beneficed
clergyman of the Church of England I
do not see how you can persist in the
attitude you have adopted.
DEAR SIR,-Perhaps you are right.
Would you prefer your joke to be illus-
trated or unillustrated?
Yours faithfully, THE EDITOR.
DEAR SIR,--I feel that the joke would
make more of a stir if suitably illus-
trated in the form of a cartoon. You
could either get one of your clever artists
to do this, or I would mention the matter
to Mr. Thomas Pipp, the drawing in-
structor at our schools. Should you
decide to leave the matter in the hands
of one of your clever cartoonists, I should
not desire any fee for my suggestion,
but would be content to receive the
original of the drawing which illus-
trated my idea.
DEAR SIR,--I think that, perhaps, we
had better leave it in the hands of one
of our clever cartoonists. When would
you like it to appear? By the way, do
ſou know Mr. William Gosport, of 5,
The Albany, Southend? He asks us,
to-day, upon a post-card, “Why did the
Budget budge it?” Though not so
neatly constructed as yours, this joke
has in idea something in common with it.
P.S.—My letter should have been
posted yesterday. I wonder if you have
ever met a Mr. Alfred Selly (or Selby),
of Leamington?
DEAR SIR,--I do not know Mr. Gosport
or Mr. Alfred Selly—though I once met
a Mr. John Selby who lived at Grange-
over-Sands. I consider that Mr. Gos-
port's joke has nothing in common with
mine at all, though he certainly seems
to have stolen my idea. The sooner
my joke appears the better for the
country.
DEAR SIR,-The idea of a joke about
the present financial situation may have
occurred to Mr. Gosport independently.
I wonder if you know any of these :—
Mr. Timothy Wells, The Thatched
House, Truro.
Canon Bletchley, of Aberdeen.
Mr. Walters, Wavecrest, Commercial
Road, Leicester.
Lt.-Col. John Adams, Naval and Mili-
tary Club, W.
I cannot help feeling that we have not
yet got the best out of your joke. Can
you not word it slightly differently, so
as to bring out more gradually the
subtle contrast between “Budget.” and
“budge it”? At present you seem to
me to get to the point too quickly.
DEAR SIR,-How would this do?
“The electors' reply to LLOYD-GEORGE
—Budge it!”
Please use this immediately, while the
subject is still topical.
DEAR SIR,-By an odd chance you
have hit upon the very form in which
Mr. Cyril James, of The Bungalow,
Cromer, puts it this morning. Though
not quite satisfactory yet, it is much
more incisive than that of the Rev.
W. R. Tonkin, of Little Beldam, who
writes upon a letter-card:
“History repeats itself. The joke
current in 1831 that the only reply to
the Budget was ‘Budge it,' is as true as
ever to-day.”
This, you will agree with me, is rather
laboured.
DEAR SIR,--I am withdrawing my
joke from your paper and am sending
it to The Times. Yours disgustedly,
Michael FAIRJohn.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
[October 20, 1909.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Ann Veronica (FISHER UNWIN) is a remarkably clever book
about rather unpleasant people. I think Mr. H. G. WELLs
wrote it (particularly the love scenes) with his head rather
than with his heart, and it is my head and not my heart
which consents to all he has to say. Ann Veronica is a
modern girl, full of vague longings for some vague kind of
freedom, who runs away from her suburban home to try life
on her own in London. Mr. WELLs has observed the type
very carefully, and has described it minutely; not often
have we been allowed to see so deep into the soul of a girl.
After an adventure with a City bounder called Ramage, who
lends her money and expects the only repayment which a
man of his type can appreciate from a woman (an episode
excellently done) she falls in love with Capes, a man separated
is not difficult to identify. Mr. GIBBs calls it The Liberal.
It is run by a young millionaire who, having lost two or
three hundred thousand pounds through the recklessness of his
helpers in the early stages, determines suddenly to cut his
losses, when, in the opinion of his staff, success is insight. Five
hundred men are thrown out of employment, having received
notice with a request for secrecy lest the negotiations which
are pending for a reconstruction should be prejudiced. It is
thus impossible for them to utilise the period of notice in
searching for new berths. This, in so notoriously overstocked
a profession as that of the journalist, is a very real tragedy,
and Mr. GIBBS writes bitterly of the callousness of the pro-
prietor. He puts his case so vigorously that in reading the
novel one is bound to take his view, but in actual fact there
is obviously another side to the picture. I think I am not
mistaken in saying that not a few men threw up good berths
to enter the better paid service of the original of The Liberal,
and a rather harsh, though strictly poetic, justice frequently
from his wife. Capes
follows such deser-
I never quite saw ;
he was so indeter-
minate that in the
great scene between
him and Ann Ve-
ronica I almost lost
her too. However,
I am glad to say I
recovered her on
p. 319—a wonderful
page which I had
not suspected of the
author. Mr. WELLs
has written a real
novel at last, whose
story progresses un-
hindered by discur-
sions into Socialism.
Yet in onesentence he
gets extraordinarily
close to the truth of
both Socialism and
Suffragettism, when
he makes Ann Vero-
nica say that the idea
is all right but the
people are all wrong.
Paths Perilous, by SidNEY Pickering,
Is lighted with a vastly brighter flame
Than that suggested by the flickering
Alliterative brilliance of its name.
It pictures France's wild democracy
Who, having lost their own heads (just pro tem.),
Rounded upon the aristocracy
And did the same (but lastingly) for them.
The tale the author has to tell us is
Knit of the many threads of human life—
The loves, ambitions, schemings, jealousies,
That failed or flourished in that time of strife.
An ancient theme, you think? You've heard of it?
Yes, but he puts new force into the job.
Buy it, I say, and read each word of it—
(CHAPMAN and HALL, six bob).
Though much of Mr. Philip Gibbs’s story, The Street of
Adventure (HEINEMANN), is a love comedy, the oldest form of
comedy extant, the great incident in it is a very modern
tragedy. It tells of the death of a big daily paper, which it

-? / 2 tions. Mr. GIBBs,
% however, tempers
2% % justice with mercy.
-- 2% - He either finds other
jobs for those of his
out-of-works who
have excited our in-
terest (no small num-
ber), or else he con-
soles them with
matrimony, or pros-
pects of it—an in-
fallible panacea for
all trouble in novels
(excepting, of course,
when the ceremony
is performed in the
opening chapters).
This is all very jolly,
but the real interest,
as I have suggested,
lies in the journalis-
tic “shop.” Inci-
dentally, since Tory
newspaper proprie-
tors have been pretty
well roasted of late
on the stage, it is pleasant to find someone having a whack
at the other side. Particularly as neither side is much the
worse for it.
Great Englishmen.
“One inch, in addition to one-and-a-half inches which was added by
a recent Army Order, has been added to the chest measurement of
recruits of the Rifle Brigade, and the standard is now 5 ft 5in."—
Natal and Military Record.
“Then the draw for stations was not in their favour, for they were
left behind at the start and so lost the only advantage of their station.
They would probably not have won from either of the other stations, but
we doubt whether either of the other crews would have won from
theirs.”—Eton College Chronicle.
What a race that would have been, though.
Never let it be said again that we do not appreciate
American humour. In the Chicago Daily Tribune we find
the following among hints on “How to sleep well”:—
“A few crackers or a glass of milk should be kept inside the bed."
Well, anybody can see the joke in that.

DEAR Toyſ, I hear you're back in Town
Bronzed as an Iroquois with brown
Of sunshine and adventures;
I wish you’d come and dine to-night
Ere stream and hill have faded quite,
And Mammon's dipped you out of sight
In shares and dull debentures'
You won't get much : my cook of old
You know is not (though gold, pure gold)
A culinary show thing;
That lady's very utmost word
Is first a sole, and then a bird,
And, if she ventures on a third,
It's toasted cheese—or nothing!
Forgive my menu its misdeeds,
At least you'll find a Beaune that needs
No bush's vain adorning,
| And when its vinted balms ascend
You'll think, 'Tis thus, though good
times end,
Their sunny memories stay to blend
With fog and Monday morning !
So come. I want to hear about

As big this year as ever ?
And has your brown retriever pup

He promised to be clever.
You got a stag, I heard from Bee ;
The island heads are small, but she
Says yours is simply ripping;

And, flushed with triumph at his fall,
What sum you spent in tipping !

Through several tomes of salmon hooks,
And on by easy stages
To other works of worthy lore,

Till round our chairs the very floor
Is carpeted with sages |
We'll smoke and watch the embers
glow

[“Months ago we heard of the baby christened Budget. And mow

To pious inspiration the fancy may be traced
Which overtook their parents (being Radical by taste),
And prompted them to label their respective babes at birth
With what their wits conceived to be the noblest names
on earth.
These twain grew up together and shared the youthful spree,
Twin minds with but a single thought, as like as pea and pea;
Or, say, as two-and-sixpence compared with half-a-crown,
Just so was Lloyd George Jenkins to Winston Churchill
Brown.
They seldom mixed with other boys because they held the
View
It's best to hunt in couples, and a couple's only two ;
But some, they saw, were useful when it came to heaving
stones, -
And such were Budget Billingsgate and Ure Another Jones.
On raiding expeditions our two behaved as one,
Together pinched the orchard and raked the poultry-run ;
And answered all objections about these little tricks
With repartees consisting mainly of mud and bricks.
And so the pair (but oh, alas! how outward form deceives!)
Remained to all appearance as close and thick as thieves;
But, underneath a smiling air, this thought they couldn't
smother—
That some day one of them would have to swallow up the other.
For when you hunt in couples, though things go smooth as oil,
There's apt to come a question of who shall take the spoil,
Of who's to be the top-dog that pins his partner down:
Would i. be }loyd George Jenkins or Winston Churchill

Well, on a day they started, both smiling, on the track
Of quite a big adventure, and only one came back '

to pass judgment on the Budget, through the means of the Referendam
Bill.”
You see one of the difficulties straight away.
SHADOWS FROM THE PAST.
THE BUTCHER's SON. .
I HEEM to remember that there was once a little boy. He
lived with his father and mother and his brothers in a large
house midway between two villages, and there in a simple
way he enjoyed life a great deal. There was a garden, there
were favourite dogs and cats, there was a pond for fishing or ,
skating, as the season ordained, there was a stable with a
complement of horses and ponies, and there were woods and
green fields lying about the house. It was a fairy palace of
delight and, like other fairy palaces, it has long since passed
away. Villas and shops, this Crescent, that Avenue, and the
other Rise reign over the spot where there were fields and
trees, and young delight and laughter. Does the uneasy
ghost of Neptune, the Newfoundland, or Sturdy, the grey
pony—how he hated to be laughed at 1–ever roam distraught
through these busy little villas?
In one of the villages, distant about a mile from the large
house, there was a school, and in this school the little boy
was a student, submitting himself, somewhat carelessly, I
fear, to the grand old fortifying classical curriculum which
has made Englishmen what they are. It was an old school,
founded far back in Tudor times, and it differed very little,
I suppose, except, perhaps, in one point, from hundreds of
other homes of learning scattered throughout the length and
breadth of the kingdom. The point of exception was that
there were generally more day-boys than boarders amongst
those who sucked wisdom from it. From the village in
which it stood and from the neighbouring villages and
homes a great many boys used to trudge to it in the morn-
ing, and then back home again for the midday dinner, then
once more to school, and so finally home again in the evening.
The little boy was one of those jolly trudgers.
I have often been told that day-boys are, on the whole, an
inferior class, not to be encouraged in the life of our great
schools. It seems that in the demoralising companionship
of their parents and amidst the unmanly surroundings
created by their sisters they waste precious hours, hours that
should properly be devoted to the acquisition of tone and
esprit de corps. The genius of public-school life, they say,
demands that at the tenderest age a little fellow should be
withdrawn from every influence that tends to make him
gentle and prevents him from becoming barbarous and
brutal—his mother's society is above all others injurious–
and that he should be subdued to all the petty little con-
ventions of dress and manner and general behaviour which
the servility or the roughness of a mass of other boys has
established in a sacred and immutable code of respectable
rules. I don't dogmatise on this point, but I am not sure
that there may not be much to be said on the other side. At
any rate my little friend was for the time a day-boy.
Now one of the fields bordering the little boy's home
belonged to the butcher of the village, and in that field the
butcher's son John was often to be seen. Sometimes John
looked through the hedge and sometimes the little boy looked
through it from the other side, and sometimes they both
looked through it together, and in the end they became
acquainted and exchanged confidences. The hedge soon
ceased to be an impenetrable barrier, and eventually John,
who was a cheerful, plump, well-mannered, red-cheeked boy,
came through it and was made free of the pleasant mysteries
of the garden. The two boys became fast friends. John
could perform marvellous feats with little lumps of clay dis-
charged as missiles from the top of a stick, and he was more
skilful with a catapult than any other mortal boy.

call him Harry henceforth—had arranged to meet a school
friend in a shady retreat in the woods. I rather think a
bird-nesting expedition had been planned. As John hap-
pened to be about when the time came for setting forth to
the tryst, Harry took him with him, not dreaming any
wrong. When they arrived the other boy was there. Harry
was punctilious in his manners, and made a ceremonious
presentation. “Let me introduce you,” he said, “Mr. John
Lumsden—Mr. Thomas Chappell. Now then, where shall
we begin?” Mr. Thomas Chappell, however, looked darkly
uncomfortable. “I'm afraid,” he stammered, without seem-
ing to see John's extended hand, “I’m afraid I’ve left some-
thing behind. I'll just go and fetch it.” And away he ran.
“Mind you come back quick!” shouted Harry after him; and
he and John waited and waited. But Mr. Chappell never
came back.
On the following morning, when Harry arrived at school,
a knot of boys gathered round him, all hostile and deter-
mined. “So you're the friend of a butcher ' " shouted one.
“Yah, you little butcher-boy!” cried another. “Send me
home a shoulder of mutton,” yelled another, “and mind, I
don't want too much fat!” “Oh, you dirty little cad,
hadn't you got a proper cheek introducing your butcher
boys’ ” Then they danced round him, sharpening imaginary
knives, making the sounds of oxen in distress, and altogether
behaving like demons in the pit. The torture continued
for days, until finally the lesson was burnt into the little
boy's heart. Who was he that he should set himself to
abolish those noble distinctions of class upon which the
safety of society depends?

Delicious peeps from shyly lowered lids—

Rearward, the ranks of lively little kids—
I knew your time of coming to a tick
And thought your pace in passing far too quick.
No more our youngsters' hearts do you disturb
As when, diurnally, you used to trail
Your undulating length along the curb,
A drift of maidenhood from head to tail.
The academic crocodile is dead;
To hockey fields its vertebrae have sped.
I am too old to carp at such a change
Or criticise the frenzied female rout

Where “Hack it through!” and “Bully!” is the shout;
And so upon the poor departed's bier

STRENGTH AND BEAUTY.
“Why don't you sit up 2" said Adela
at dinner, suddenly prodding me in the
back. Adela is old enough to take a
motherly interest in my figure, and
young enough to look extremely pretty
while doing so.
“I always stoop at meals,” I ex-
plained ; “it helps the circulation. My
own idea.”
“But it looks so bad. You ought—”
“Don’t improve me,” I begged.
“No wonder you have-—”
“Hush | I haven't. I got a bullet
on the liver in the campaign of '03, due
to over-smoking; and sometimes it hurts
me a little in the cold weather. That's all.”
“Why don't you try the Hyperion?”
“I will. Where is it 2 ''
“It isn't anywhere; you buy it.”
“Oh, I thought you dimed at it. What
do you buy it for 2''
“It’s one of those developers with

said suspiciously.

strong –—”
“Are you being simply as tactful as
you can be ''' -
“—and graceful.”
“It isn't as though you were actually
a relation,” I protested.
Adela continued, full of her idea.
“It would do you so much good, you
know. Would you promise me to use it
every day if I sent you mine?”
“Why don't you want yours any
And
more? Are you perfect now * *
“You can easily hook it to the
wall—”
“I suppose,” I reflected, “there is
a limit of beauty beyond which it is dan-
gerous to go. After that either the thing
would come of its hook, or * *
“Well,” said Adela suddenly, “aren't
I looking well ?”
“You’re looking radiant,” I said,
appreciatively; “but it may only be
because you.'re going to marry Billy
next month.”
She smiled and blushed. “Well,
I ll send it to you,” she said. “And
you try it for a week, and then tell me
if you don't feel better. Oh, and don't
do all the exercises to begin with ; start
with three or four of the easy ones.”
“Of course,” I said.
+ + + + *::
I undid the wrappings eagerly, took
off the lid of the box, and was confronted
with (apparently) six pairs of braces. I
shook them out of the box and saw I
had made a mistake. It was one pair of
braces for M \GOG.. I picked it up, and
I knew that I was in the presence of the
Hyperion. In five minutes I had screwed
a hook into the bedroom wall and attached
the beautifier. Then I sat on the edge
of the bed and looked at it.
There was a tin plate, attached to the
top, with the word “LADIES” on it. I
got up, removed it with a knife, and sat
down again. Everything was very dusty,
and I wondered when Adela had last
developed herself.
By-and-by I went into the other room
to see if I had overlooked anything. I
found on the floor a chart of exercises,
and returned triumphantly with it.
There were thirty exercises
gether, and the chart gave you
(1) A detailed explanation of how to
do each particular exercise;
(2) A photograph of a lady doing it.
“After all,” I reassured myself, aſter
the first bashful glance, “it is Adela who
has thrust this upon me; and she must
have known.” So I studied it.
Nos. 10, 15, 28 and 30 seemed the
easiest; I decided to confine myself
to them. For the first of these you
strap yourself in at the waist, grasp the
handles, and fall slowly backwards until
your head touches the floor—all the
elastic cords being then at full stretch.
When I had got very slowly halfway
down, an extra piece of elastic which
had got hitched somewhere came sud-
denly into play, and I did the rest
of the journey without a stop, finishing
up sharply against the towel-horse. The
chart had said, “Inhale going down,”
and I was inhaling hard at the moment
that the towel-horse and two damp towels
spread themselves over my face.
“So much for Exercise 10," I thought,
as I got up. “I'll just get the idea
to-might, and then start properly to-
morrow. Now for No. 15.”
Somehow I felt instinctively that
No. 15 would cause trouble. I'or No. 15
you stand on the right foot, fasten the
left foot to one of the cords, and stretch
it out as far as you can . . . .
What—officially—you do them, I can-
not say . . .
Some people can stand easily upon the
right foot when the left is fastened to the
wall . . . others cannot . . . It is a gift . . .
Having recovered from my spontaneous
rendering of No. 15, I turned to No. 28.
This one, I realised, was extremely im-
portant; I would do it twelve times.
You begin by lying flat on the floor
roped in at the waist, and with your
hands (grasping the elastir cords) held
straight up in the air. The tension on
your waist is then extreme, but on your
hands only moderate. Then taking
a deep breath you pull your arms
slowly out until they lie along the floor.
The tension becomes terrific, the strain
alto-
on every part of you is immense.
While I lay there, taking a deep breath
before relaxing, I said to myself, “The
strain will be too much for me.” I
was wrong. It was too much for the
hook. The hook whizzed out, every-
thing flew at me at once, and I remem-
bered no more . . .
As I limped into bed, I trod heavily
upon something sharp. I shrieked and
bent down to see what had bitten me.
It was a tin plate bearing the word
“LADIES.”
+ + + + +
“Well?” said Adela a week later.
I looked at her for a long time.
“When did you last use the Hyperion?"
I asked.
“About a year ago.”
“Ah! . . . You don't remember the
chart that went with it 2 ''
“Not well. Except, of course, that each
exercise was arranged for a particular
object, according to what you wanted.’
“Exactly. So I discovered yesterday.
It was in very small type, and I missed
it at first.”
“Well, how many did you do?”
“I limited myself to exercises 10, 15
and 28. Do you happen to remember
what those are for 2"
“Not particularly.”
“No. Well, I started with No. 10.
No. 10, you may recall, is one of the
most perilous. I nearly died over No. 10.
And when I had been doing it for a
week I discovered what its particular
object was.”
“What?” -
“‘To round the forearm'ſ Yes,
madam,” I said bitterly, “I have spent
a week of agony . . . and I have rounded
one forearm.” -
“Why didn't you try another?”
“I did. I tried No. 15. Six times in
the pursuit of No. 15 have I been shot
up to the ceiling by the left foot . . .
and what for, Adela’’ ‘To arch the
instep'ſ Look at my instep ! Why
should I want to arch it?”
“I wish I could remember which
chart I sent you,” said Adela, wrinkling
her brow.
“It was the wrong one,” I said . . . .
There was a long silence.
“Oh,” said Adela suddenly, “you
never told me about No. 28.”
“Pardon me,” I said, “I cannot bear
to speak of 28.”
“Why, was it even more unsuitable
than the other two '2''
“I found, when I had done it six
times, that its object was stated to be,
“To remove double chim.' That, how-
ever, was not the real effect. And so
I crossed out the false comment and
wrote the true one in its place.”
“And what is that ''' asked Adela.
“To remove the hook,’” I said gloomily.

TO MARS IN OPPOSITION.
The strings had ceased, and with their
strain
(MozART, the ever fresh and tender)
Still ringing sweetly in my brain
I stole into a Sussex lane,
A much-reſreshed week-ender, -
When suddenly there met my sight
A scene so excellently bright
As made mere musical delight
Its sovranty surrender.
I never saw my friend the Bear
Or any other starry cluster,
The Pleiads in their tangled lair,
Or Cassiopeia in her chair,
Shine with a larger lustre.
But dwarfing all the other stars,
As PETER dwarfed the other Tsars,
The sanguine disc of mighty Mars
Outshone the astral muster.
Portentous planet, on whose face
The telescope of SCHIAPARELLI,
Through myriad myriad miles of space,
Enables us canals to trace
Minute as vermicelli,
Thanks to your enervating spells
The Sociologist who dwells
At Hampstead, of the name of WELLs,
Grows lyrical as SHELLEY.
Although not usually prone
To harbour vulgar superstitions,
To see you on a sudden grown
To such prodigious bulk, I own,
Excites my worst suspicions.
Are you encouraging LLOYD GEORGE
Fresh fiscal instruments to forge
To make unhappy Dukes disgorge
Their dearest acquisitions 2
In ages past you stirred the feud
Of Fatimite against Abassid,
And co-religionists imbrued
With gore, although their attitude
Was previously placid.
: And now you turn poor Mr. URE,
Who formerly was quite demure,
Into a perfect stream of pure
Financial Uric acid.
Your baleful influence is the fons
Of recent female revolutions,
Transforming Sylphs to Amazons
With hearts of steel and brows of bronze
And iron constitutions,
Who wrestle with the men in blue
(A thing that I should hate to do)
And harmless Ministers pursue
With endless persecutions.
Sleek HALDANE, mildest-mannered sage
That e'er translated SCHOPENHAUER,
Now pores on CLAUSEWITz's page
And, goaded by a martial rage,
Bears witness to your power.
And smug McKENNA, spurred to roam
In fighting kit across the foam,
Now never feels himself at home
Save in a conning tower.
All classes by your lurid lamp
Are led astray, from dukes to tinkers;
You aggravate the common scamp
And force philosophers to ramp
Like dissipated rinkers.
Who shall escape your deadly glare
Which causes panic ev'rywhere
And strikes us pink, unless he wear
Perpetually blinkers?

AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
An attempt to rewrite Lady Cardigan's Recol-
lections to suit some of her critics.
SITTING down at the age of eighty-
four to write my reminiscences, I wish
to make it clearly understood that I am
a happy woman. And whyam I happy?
Because during my long life I have
known mone but sweet and good Chris-
tian men and women; and because I
have all my faculties left. I am still
capable of entertaining my pious friends
in both town and country. I can amuse
myself with singing and playing hymns;
I have a good digestion and can enjoy
my dinner, heedless of any new-fashioned
fads about food; I can read The War
Cry without spectacles.
Thinking over the many noble aristo-
cratic persons I have known, I am
amazed at their simplicity and purity.
One hears so much of the fast ways of
the Smart Set; I have seen none of
them. My father was a deeply pious
man, but he had the not unnatural
foible to wish to disguise some of his
love of spiritual things, and affected
sometimes to be quite a man of the
world. I remember when I was a mere
girl that I wanted very much to hear a
famous preacher who had just come to
London. I asked Papa to take me. He
was very sorry, but it was, he said,
quite impossible. “Quite impossible,
ADELINE. I am dining to-night with
General CAVENDISH at the Club—a long-
standing engagement; but,” he con-
tinued, “even if I were disengaged I
should hesitate to take you, for you are
not just now very strong, and this
preacher is too emotional.” However, I
felt that I could not stay away, and I
therefore went with my maid, and sent
word to Lord CARDIGAN, who also dearly
loved a good sermon, to come to our pew.
The moment he arrived he insisted
that I must leave. I naturally asked
why. “Well,” reluctantly answered
CARDIGAN–“well, Miss DE HoRSEY, your
father and General CAVENDish are in the
pew opposite with ”—(he looked at me
apologetically)—“with two clergymen.
It will never do for you to see them;
your father would be so ashamed to be
caught at church like this. Do, I
implore you, permit me to escort you
home at once.”
I was seized with an uncontrollable
desire to laugh. So this was the long-
standing engagement, this Papa's parade
of worldliness! Of course I could not
give up the sermon, and I remained;
but, owing to a cab accident, I did not
reach home till late. Papa was reading
his Bible and he asked me where I had
been. “I’ve been to church, Papa, ' I
said demurely—(he started)—“and I saw
you and General CAVENDISH there. I
thought you were dining at the Club
. . . and I saw . . .” “Go to bed at
once, ADELINE,” interrupted Papa, look-
ing rather sheepish; “we’ll talk about
your disobedience later.” But he never
mentioned the subject to me again.
I was not Lord CARDIGAN's first wife.
She, poor lady, died young, after a life
of perfect unity with him. I remember
very vividly the day on which Lord
CARDIGAN finally proposed to me. He
had, of course, given me Prayer-books
and so forth, but that was all. I was
awakened by a loud knocking at the
front-door. I looked at my watch and
saw that it was not seven o'clock. The
knocking continued. I heard the bolts
drawn, the door opened, and a voice I
knew well called impatiently for me.
It was Lord CARDIGAN. I dressed care-
fully, even to my mackintosh, before I
received him. Taking me in his arms
he said, “My dearest, my first wife has
now been dead six years this morning.
Enough time has elapsed for all the
conventions to be satisfied. Will you
marry me, and will you allow me to
arrange for our wedding to be solem-
mised without further delay?” I felt
I could do nothing but agree. Pressing
another gold-mounted Prayer-book into
my hand, he rushed away.
Lord HERTFORD was at bottom an Evan-
gelical. I think THACKERAY did very
wrong to malign him as the Marquis of
Steyme. There is, of course, no doubt
that he looked a roué, while the society
he lived in and his great wealth com-
bined to make him noticeable. But as
a matter of fact he was, like Papa and
CARDIGAN, at heart a little child, and of
a deeply religious nature. He always,
however, looked a great nobleman, and
never forgot his manners.
Lord HERTFoRD was persona grata at
Court; every one visited him, and his
breakfast and luncheon parties were
considered delightful. There were, of
course, since this is a cruel and scan-
dalous world, all kinds of rumours
about the orgies after the Opera, when
closed carriages were said to take the
prettiest members of the corps de ballet
up to the Regent's Park house, so
securely hidden in its lovely sylvan
grounds. Scandal said that once there
the ladies discarded the conventional
attire of the ballet and waited on Lord
HERTFoRD and his friends at supper
wearing less than what is now con-

sidered good form to appear in as
Salome. But it was scandal and nothing
else; for as a matter of fact the closed
carriages contained only the clergy and
choir from St. Dunstan's, who were
frequently summoned in this way to
hold spiritual vigils with this kindliest
of noblemen and titled saints.
Not long after CARDIGAN's death I was
much exercised in my mind about a
proposal of marriage I had just received
from DISRAELI. My uncle, Admiral
Rous, had said to me, “My dear, I think
it is on general principles undesirable
for a Christian woman to marry an
Israelite, even though he be the virtual
ruler of England,” but I had known
DISRAELI all my life, and I liked him
too well to harbour such exclusive feel-
ings. Are we not all members of the
great human family? He had, however,
one drawback so far as I was concerned,
and that was he would put peawd'Espagne
on his pocket-handkerchief.
Others who wished to marry me were
more than one Archbishop of Canter-
bury, Mr. Moody, Mr. SANKEY, and the
Editor of The British Christian ; but I
had to say No. They were either not
sincere enough or I did not love them.
A FATHER'S LOVE.
[Adapted, without exaggeration, from a book
written more than two thousand years ago.]
Dost thou love thine offspring dearly 2
Wouldst thou save him future pain?
Beat him on the sides severely,
Beat him till he roars again.
Whoso pets his child and cockers
Turns him to the walks of sin;
He that spares the knickerbockers
Surely spoils the child therein.
If the colt remain unbroken
Hast thou profit in his vice?
So thy son; and, more by tokem,
Thou thyself wilt pay the price.
Wherefore, lest he prove a rover,
“Teach” him ere the chance be gone;
Take him up and turn him over ;
It shall profit thee anon.
Laugh not with thy child and play not ;
Wink not on him if he fall;
Bow his neck lest he obey not,
And thou gnash thy teeth withal.
Short the curb and strong the fetter,
That his feet be not misled;
Is he good 2 He might be better;
Is he naughty 2 Smack his head.
Be thou tireless in correction
Hour by hour and day by day,
Diligent in thine affection
Till his youth has rolled away.
Thus by fond paternal chidings
Goodly shall he wax and wise,
Purged of juvenile backslidings,
Perfect in thy fellows' eyes;
And for all thy pains and labours
He shall make thee full amends,
As a boast before thy neighbours
And a bragging to thy friends.

Appeared one day among their dishes.

Who gave this dietetic sign
Of obvious impecuniosity.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Oct. 18.
— Members back again after week's
holiday. Lords, meantime hard at work,
take a night off. Sort of Boa and Coac
business, as SARK says.
Attendance limited. PREMIER and
PRINCE ARTHUR defer arrival. Would
never guess, glancing over half-filled
benches, that we are preparing another
Revolution. A poor thing, but our own.
Bill before House on Report stage means
unification of Metropolis, with intent that
all elections shall take place on same day.
RUTHERFORD pointed out how, in manner
familiar with present Government, this
strikes ruthlessly at heart of important,
just now, struggling trade. What is
to become of the hansom cabman, not
less poor and honest than a Duke,
accustomed to receive handsome fares
on election days for driving the Plural
Voter from poll to poll 2
CLAUDE HAY, taking closer view of
situation, discovered in Bill insidious
attempt to deprive London working man
of one of his votes.
the working man, having two town
houses in London, have two votes?
Wonderful how concern for working
man is quickened by approach of
General Election. Only the other day
there was touching plea for establish-
ment of principle of one working man
two public-houses. That mocked at by
mechanical majority, who now laugh at
idea of working man with dual town
establishment.
BANDURY, coming back aſter hunger
strike patriotically undertaken in con-
nection with Development Bill, is so
impregnated with influences of this
iteration of duality that he sees two SAM
EvansEs on Treasury Bench. Didn't
know tother from which. In striking
passage pictured embarrassment of poll-
ing clerk asked to determine on election
day which was SAM Evans of Mile End
and which he of Paddington.
Case of KIMBER, Bart., touched fringe
of tragedy. Had looked forward to
Report stage of London Elections Bill
as great opportunity. Prepared to rise
to occasion in stupendous speech.
Started off by seconding REMNANT's
motion to re-commit Bill. In accordance
with order ruling debate, Member bent
on this errand must confine remarks
strictly to argument showing cause why
such course should be adopted. Must not
discuss provisions of measure, already
settled on Second Reading.
“And now,” said KIMBER, having got
into stride and settling down to steady
pace, “I will show hom. Members that
the measure will not, as the FIRST
CoMMISSIONER hopes, make London as
Birmingham.”
Why should not
“SAM Evass of MILE END AND HE of PADDINGTON.”
“Ho! indeed! Sir Sam-u-el Hevans, har yer?!!
Well, I could do wiv a bit o' hincrement
myself. Got a 'arf-crown about yer, eh, ole pal?”
SPEAKER.—“Order! Order! The time
is past for showing that. The oppor-
tunity was on Second Reading. The
hon. gentleman must set forth some
arguments for re-committing the Bill.”
This awkward. KIMBER dolefully
turned over pages of manuscript which
demonstrated futility of Loulu's dream.
With one eye on SPEAKER, the other on
manuscript (of itself a disconcerting
position), he went on. At end of half-a-
dozen sentences, SPEAKER up again.
“The hon. gentleman,” he said, “is
resuming his speech at the point at
which he was called to order.”
And this a free country, the home of
unencumbered speech ! After painful
pause KIMBER made fresh start.
“On the Second Reading,” he
observed, “the FIRST CoM MissionER of
WoRKs admitted that the Bill would
abolish the dual vote in London.”
KIMBER conscious of the chilling of
blood in his veins. An icy stream
coursed through his spine. Without
looking up was conscious of fact that
the Dread Figure in the Chair was
upstanding. Through the haze born of
tear-dimmed eyesight, above the buzz-
ing stillness that followed on pause of
his own voice, he heard the SPEAKER
ordering him to resume his seat; which
he gratefully did.
Alas for those who mever sing,
But die with all their music in them.
ºusiness done. —London Elections Bill
carried by majority exceeding two to
one. Read a third time without division.
Tuesday.—After weeks' absence, Mr.
WEIR comes back, bringing his sheaves
with him in form of bulky bundle of
questions addressed to LORD Advocate.
Yesterday he had a dozen, all in a row.
To-day submits supplement of four.
In an assembly problematically capable
but indubitably dull, Mr. WEIR is a
precious possession. Verily his price is
above rubies. A drawback to perfect
enjoyment of his presence is the impos-
sibility of communicating its subtle
essence to outsiders. Nous autres look
upon his hairy countenance, recognise
its supernatural gravity, hear the voice
drawn up from his boots by hydraulic
process, the stream passing by the way
through roomy harbours of bagginess
about the trouser-knees. We delight in
the uniqueness of the rare aggregation;
are in despair when attempt is made
to convey to outsiders a sense of its
incomparable charm.
An additional attraction is the uncer-
tainty that ever haunts the looker-on as
to whether Mr. WEIR is really an un-
conscious humorist. Occasionally, when
his eye falls on the LoRD Advoc ATE, a
wicked light gleams under the shaggy
eyebrows, suggesting he is not quite
so simple as he looks. However it be,
the comedy, simple in unpremeditated
art, rich in quality, never palls. Towards
the close of a Sºssion that has lingered

“A gay young dog " throwing off a few
fancies about dukes.
through eight months, the constant ob-
server grows aweary of the steely sparkle
or the flashing light of parliamentary
stars. Never of Mr. WEIR.
The little comedy completed by collabo-
ration of LoRD Advocate. On the public
platform Mr. URE presents himself in the
form of a gay young dog who delights
in barking at the heels of dukes, making
feints to nip the calves of millionaires.
He is what Lord HAIsbury would describe
as “a sort of " cross between LLoyd
GEORGE and WINSTON. In the House,
replying to shorter catechism admin-
istered by Mr. WEIR, he is a dour Low-
lander, implacably matter-of-fact, doling
out ounces and half-ounces of informa-
tion in response to categorical enquiry.
Some men in Ministerial position would
attempt to thrust Mr. WEIR aside with
friendly joke. LoRD ADVOCATE treats him
with profoundest gravity, reading replies
of prodigious length. -
“Will the right hon. gentleman let me
have a copy of that reply 2” says Mr.
WEIR in deep bass notes that subtly
hint at criminal proceedings for wilful
perjury, or at least malversation of facts.
“Certainly,” replies the LoRD Advocate.
Mr. WEIR, casting upon him a sidelong
glance, eloquent in expression of sur-
prise that moral turpitude of unexampled
degree should escape the instant in-
tervention of thunderbolts, remarks :
“Ques-ti-on 55; the same right hon.
gentleman.”
“A dour Lowlander, implacably
matter-of-fact.”

House of Lords, Thursday.—Before,
and immediately after, Pip realised his
“Great Expectations” he suffered greatly
at the hands of Uncle Pumblechool, who
had unpleasing habit of dragging him
up from his stool set in a quiet corner
of the forge kitchen, putting him be-
fore the fire as if he were going to be
cooked, and observing to Mrs. Gargery,
“Now, mum, here 's this boy which
you've brought up by hand. Hold up
your head, boy, and be for ever grateful
unto them which so did do. Now,
mum, with respections to this boy.”
Then he rumpled his hair the wrong
way. -
Recall this domestic scene when look-
ing in on House of Lords through week.
Taking House of Commons as Pip,
regarding the hereditary Chamber as
Uncle Pumblechools (whom in other
aspects it occasionally resembles) there
has been a succession of hair-rumpling
processes. Budget is a thing apart,
slowly approaching hour of crisis.
There are other matters — Irish Land
Bill, Development Bill, Housing Bill, to
wit -in respect of which Pip's hair has
been sorely dealt with.
To-night Development Bill taken in
hand. By comparison with others men-
tioned it has been tenderly treated. It
forms one of succession of Government
measures that have fared badly at the
hands of Uncle Pumblechool. As soon
as Budget Bill is out of the way in
Commons we may look out for wigs on

FIRST PRINCIPLES FOR BABES.
WHAT TO SAY ON TRYING OCCASIONS.
THE average baby, born to find itself
the unhappy possessor of a body and
mind with which it has only the barest
idea what to do, is always open to receive
directions for use. The average author,
finding himself the possessor of unlimited
paper and pencils, always welcomes a
permanent subject for his lucubrations.
This series will appear, therefore, week
by week until the crack of doom.
[Sec conclusion.—ED.]
Forgive us, dear infant, for calling
you “It,” and turn your attention to the
necessity of saying the right thing on
the right occasion. The hair on your
head (or the lack of it) may seem to you
to be a grievance crying out for more
immediate attention. That, however,
age will remedy; not too much age, for
that tends to baldness. Again, before
we start I should like to ask you if you
have yet read The White Prophet? No?
Well, please yourself, of course; but I
do not think they will give you much
peace until you have. And now for the
conversation.
Though you will have but the merest
acquaintance with words and their
meanings, you will find yourself from
the beginning of things the centre of
admiring crowds, who will address many
unanswerable remarks to you in a quaint,
foreign-sounding tongue, and will pro-
bably look to you for some response.
Though goodness knows this language
of ours is intricate and difficult enough
to master, yet I am sorry to have to in-
form you that every step will be taken
during your first years to bring you up
in a form of speech which is understood
by no one and is only addressed to your-
self, the cat, the dog and that unfortunate
bird, the canary. I only know one word
of it myself, and that is “DiDDUMs.”
That word has no meaning, but it has
a multitude of uses. It may express
pleasure, surprise, approval, invitation
and refusal. It may be used as an oath H
and more especially as a last resource,
when something has to be said but
nothing intelligible offers. Ignore it,
dear child, from the first, and, if it is
hurled at you ad nauseam, protest by
tears and bites. I for one shall hold
you entirely justified.
The most trying circumstance with
which you will have to contend in early
life is a course of perpetual kissing.
Ladies, whom you have never met before

collect income-tax off you, will insist

who will come to refer to you as “that

amd demanding conversation of you.
What then are you to say? -
Young thing, you are doomed from
the first to disappointment. I cannot
tell you what to say; in fact, I must
strongly advise you not to worry your-
self about the matter at all. At the
moment any sound or even motion of
the arms or legs will suffice, and, if you
do go to the trouble of introducing your-
self to the art of conversation, you will
find that the more you are ready and
willing to talk the less they will care to
listen. Three years at least are neces-
sary for becoming an accomplished
linguist, and by that time they will be
informing you that “little boys should
be seen and not heard.” The same
remark is applied to little girls, with the
added restriction, according to the views
of the bitter majority, that they should
not even be seen. When you arrive at
the complete age of sixteen and feel that
you really know all about everything,
you will find your conversation less
popular than ever. In fact, the only
words which will then be required of
you will be such as will present little
difficulty either in the pronunciation or
the spelling. They are: “Yes,” “No,”
and “Indeed.” Take my advice, and, if
you may not join in the conversation at
table, do not listen to it, but keep your
eye on the food. You will not miss
much. If they talk about themselves
(as they probably will) their words will
be neither very true nor very interest-
ing. If they talk about you, it will be
either to correct or to prohibit.
They may even expect you to learn a
lot of dead languages, but never, I trust
for your sake, Esperanto. That is a
form of speech invented for the easy use
of all the world on all occasions. It is,
as a matter of fact, employed by about
ten persons twice a year, and then
without an audience. Probably by now
most people cannot so much as remember
what the word “Esperanto” itself means.
Personally, I never knew. At any rate,
if the Editor has any remark to make
at the end of this article, let us hope
that he will be man enough to make
it in English. Probably he will want
to remind you that there are going to be
lots more of these articles. Anyhow,
let us hear what he has got to say.

Under these circumstances I have
only one more thing to say to you, dear
child. If among your professed ad-
mirers there is an editor, for once let
him nurse you in liis arms. This would
be punishment enough for ordinary
persons, but remember what he is and
pull the short hair over his ears with all
your little might. You will never for-
give yourself in later life, if you let this
opportunity go by.

WHY I HAVE GEASED TO BE A NOVELIST.
THE fault was mine, so I blame nobody.
I made my characters too life-like--that
was the trouble!! I made them live,
and some of them were very nasty
over it. - -
It seems that mine is a vitalising pen
—one that endows the most subordinate
characters with life, and after what
happened last Thursday night I see that
I shall have to confine its use to diaries
and correspondence. * -
I was writing at home rather late, and
I had just put aside my half-completed
novel to outline a fancy trifle—a

opened.” - , - -
“Well, but Teddy's a real nuisance,”
continued Margaret. “Why, see, there
he is He even pesters me now when
we're off duty. But perhaps the time's
come round for another of our silly
dialogue interludes. I must go.”
There was a slight commotion near
the door, and Philip Vandale, my six-
foot hero, strode down the room. He
had an ugly contusion over his left eye.
“It's more than human nerves can
stand,” he cried. “This old idea that
one hero can rout half-a-dozen hooligans
a subtle stroke, and Philip had the grace
to blush. ... -
“Ah! selfish brute that I am, I–I
was forgetting,” he stammered. “I
cannot desert Margaret. No, I shall see
the game through.” - -
Would he? I had had about enough
of Master Philip, and of them all. Even
the old vicar presently spoke out in a
manner ill befitting his cloth or the
character with which I had endowed
him. - *
“One more year,” he said, “of visiting
the people I have to visit, and I go mad

little by-product—which had come
into my mind. This dealt with an
imaginary club or green-room to be
provided by authors for the use of
their puppets when off duty. In a
light-hearted yet scholarly vein I was
making good capital out of the way
in which, during the production of a
novel, the characters off the page
might amuse themselves at this sym-
posium, when something very dis-
quieting happened. I have said just ||
now how my pen gives life to my
| characters. Well, in describing
places it has an equally graphic and
animating touch, and before I quite
knew what was taking place this
Puppets' Club had become an actu-
ality, with a membership drawn en-
tirely from the characters of my own
novel ! I found myself entrenched
behind my little writing-table in a
corner of the Club's largest room,
and as I was not immediately observed
I had the listener's usual luck of
hearing myself freely discussed.
Margaret Deane, my heroine's
bosom-friend, came by talking in
animated tones to Norah, my heroine's
youngest sister. . - -
“Candidly, Norah, how do I strike
you? I don't feel a bit well drawn.”
“Why, you’re just sweet,” said
Norah, and my heart went out to
her. “But look at me! The stupid

said a querulous voice—it was that of
Margaret's invalid mother, “and of
always being house-bound. Two
pages ago I was left at home from

Margaret, “and there are worse troubles

going to be paired off with that fatuous
noodle, Teddy Boskins, just because Mr.
Beverton has such a craze for tidying up

Tidying up in the last chapter' Why,
my last chapters are little masterpieces !

NIGHTMARE OF A NEGROPUDLIAN AFTER THE BLACKPOOL FLYING WEEK.
If this represented the general feeling
towards me I felt that I had better
gather my papers and retire before I
| was observed. Just, however, as I made
a movement to do so, Detective Pierce
entered the room, and I knew that I was
too late. No other detective in all fiction
has the quick eyes or mental grasp of a
situation that my Pierce has, and in a
flash his glance had encountered mine,
and he was pointing a rigid finger at my
crumpled front.
“Ah, there he is—that's our man '''
he cried. “He thinks I am his—that
we are all his, but he is grossly mis-
taken. He is ours!”
In a moment they were all surging
about my small table. The heroine
seized and tore into fragments the loose
pages of my precious manuscript. (Mis-
guided girl, she was to have married a
lord in the next chapter') The hero
towered over me with clenched fists.
(Coward, to attack a single opponent!)
The vicar snapped his fingers in my
face (and snapped his chance of a
deanship at the same moment). A more
graceless set of people, or one more
blind to its own interests, I had never
encountered.
“So much for this trash!” cried
Hilda, and with the torn pages of my
novel crumpled in her hands she turned
to the fire-place. (It was July and there
was a good fire in the grate.) I rose to
stop her, but she had flung the script
into the blaze ere I could reach her.
“You suicide—you murderess' " I
cried, and, realising what she had dome,
her face blanched. As the fire caught
and destroyed the pages, the figures in
the room grew fainter and fainter; in
less than a minute I was alone and back
in my own room.

am afraid its intellectual side ripens
slowly.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF all the stories in Actions and Reactions (MACMILLAN) had
been as delightfully human as the first of them, or as delight-
fully doggy as the second, RUDYARD KIPLING would have
deserved much better of his many friends. He knows it as
well as I do, or he wouldn't have given the place of honour
to “Am Habitation Enforced '' (one of the best things he has
ever done), and the next place to “Garm—a Hostage.” But
he cannot bring himself to resign his position as Prince of
Cataloguers. He crams up, all the special terminology of a
bee-house or a flying machine, and we must endure the
appallingly brilliant results in the shape of “The Mother
Hive” and “With the Night Mail.” In the rest of the
stories—“The Little Foxes” is the best—we are spared
technicalities, but cannot quite escape from a sense that the
author has been striving after effect, or at least never meant
plague, then from the natives, who, as the result of an anti-
Christian riot, besiege the handful of European settlers,
English, French and German, in the house and compound of
the latest-joined member of the little community, a raw young
German merchant. When at last they escape in a boat down
the river, the young German is no longer a raw “griffin.”
He has been educated into manhood, partly by the common
danger, partly by the inspiring example of what I hope and
believe we may consider a typical Englishman of about his
own age. If only all Germans, while they are young—but
that is anotherand a less probable story. And my business
is to say what I think of Mr. RIDEOUT's. Well, I think this,
that STEVENSON would have revelled in telling of the dis-
covery of the plot and the siege of the Nunnery, and that
Mr. RIDEOUT, without being STEVENSON (he is, in fact, peculiarly
himself, with his pidgin English and the staccato, elliptical
style of his white characters), has made his men and women,
good and bad, very much alive, and his clean, wholesome
danger delightfully thrilling.

semblance of proba-
bility which the

qualified as I am for -
a paladinship, I can still wish to shield myself from such a
| ruthless gaze. Once granted, however, that it was worth
while to dissect Rye's character, I admit that the operation
has been triumphantly accomplished. Both as a cautious and
as a hasty lover Rye was unfortunate. First of all he marked
time with Esther Yorke, and when she was tired of his way of
counting the cost (and there was a cost) he found consolation
with Alice Godolphin. She, we are told, “was the seven-
teenth young lady who, beginning her career at the Jollity
Theatre, had soared into the peerage.” In this rarefied
atmosphere she dwindled away so rapidly that she had to
take a rest-cure. And the result was not a good adver-
tisement for rest-cures. Clever and brilliantly analytical
as the book is, it leaves me cold; but I have to thank
Mr. VACHELL for introducing me to a charming lady with the
uncharming name of Miranda Jagg.
“Clean and wholesome danger” is one of the phrases that
stick in my mind after reading Dragon's Blood (CoNSTABLE).
It exactly expresses the matter of Mr. H. M. RIDEOUT's book.
The danger—the Yellow Peril, on a small scale and at close
quarters—arises in a Chinese trading-village, first from the
administrative ab-
surdities altogether lacked; and his use, for the purpose
of his Nationalist revolution, of an Irishman's ferocity
and a casual Labour M.P.'s spite against everything English
has been largely justified in fact by the Young Egyptian
Congress at Geneva. As a romance, however, the book
imitates too slavishly the methods of Mr. CAINE, for whom
Mr. SLADEN in a wordy preface pronounces unlimited admira-
tion. The many who share that admiration will be satis-
fied with this narrative, for they will miss none of their
accustomed sentiment nor be denied their paragon hero
and heroine, who overcome by their own unremitting virtue
all the wickedness of mankind and the perversity of circum-
stance. But the mistaken few who have even less regard
for Mr. CAINE’s “psychological treatment of elemental ques-
tions” than for his political judgment will probably wish
that Mr. SLADEN had omitted altogether his romance and
confined himself to his admirable counterblasting.
Admiral Sir W.H.FAWKES is announced to speak at a meeting
at the Church House on November 5th, “if engagements will
allow.” There is, of course, a family anniversary to be
celebrated on that day.

And hardly anything at all occurs

The fox has couched within his private earth;
The partridge-bird has scooted off the stubble;
The cockatoo has checked his impious mirth;
All, save the fishes down below,
Have modified their status quo;–
Not thus do we, before the burst of thunder
Fixed in the programme for a nearish date,
Adopt an attitude of speechless wonder

SHADOWS FROM THE PAST.
The DANCE.
THERE was a good deal of excitement when the invitation
arrived. It was on a card, and it announced that Miss Harmer
was to be at home on a certain day at The Elms. In the
corner was the statement that there would be dancing from
8.30 to 11. It was the most grown-up thing that had ever
happened to the particular boy to whom the card was
addressed, and his fifteen-year-old soul glowed with pride at
the prospect of a real dance, at which he could wear his
swallow-tailed coat, his white tie, his new enamelled studs,
and his patent-leather shoes. Only one thing troubled him,
and that was the anticipation of having to conduct conversa-
tions with his partners, especially with Miss Harmer, who
was twenty-six years old and very beautiful. She had a lot
of fair hair, and she had a bold way with her. Should he
ever dare to ask her to dance, to put his arm round her
waist and actually to attempt a waltz with her? And what
could he talk to her about? The mere thought filled him
with bashfulness and blushes.
The optata dies came inexorably, and at 8.30 to the minute
he was set down at The Elms and was received by Miss
Harmer. Before he knew what had happened he had said,
“Good evening, Miss Harmer,” and she had said, “Good
evening, Ronald. So glad you've come.” He had meant to
stay and chat lightly with her for a moment, but something
had swept him on, and he was now standing aimlessly in the
middle of the room with a painful consciousness of his hands.
He felt, too, that his smile was becoming fixed, and he got
rid of it by a sort of dead lift.
There were a great many other guests in the room,
boys, girls, young men and young women. Some of them
he knew, but he had eyes only for the supreme goddess,
Miss Harmer. A man with black whiskers and an eye-glass
was standing beside her and talking to her familiarly with
great ease and composure. Why were men with black
whiskers so detestable? and what wouldn't he, Ronald, give
to be able to talk like that, and to bring those bright and
fascinating replies from the divine Harmer? However, he
must nerve himself to ask her for a dance in the orthodox
manner. He did so, brought his programme forward, and
advanced.
“May I have the pleasure of the next dance, Miss
Harmer ?” Was that his own voice, so prim and formal and
unfriendly? No, it must be some one else's. He had
intended to put any amount of warmth into the phrase, so
that he might show her with what respectful longing he
was yearning to lead her forth. “My dear Ronald,” she
laughed, “the next dance is the first dance. I can't dance
that or the next two or three, because I’ve got to receive
my guests, but I’ll give you the fifth—it's the Lancers.”
“Oh, thank you, Miss Harmer; and may I have a waltz too.
I can dance the trois-temps all right, and I > *
“There's nothing like asking,” said Miss Harmer. “If
you're a very good boy you shall have the seventh too.
That's a waltz.”
“And that's my foot,” said the black-whiskered man,
removing it from under Ronald's. “Don’t apologise. I like
it. Everybody treads on my foot.”
“There, there,” said Miss Harmer, tapping the black-
whiskered man with her fan, “we won't bother about a mere
foot.”
Clearly the black-whiskered man was abominable. Some-
thing painful and disgraceful ought to happen to him

(No reply; then, with some indignation)—Must say I think it was RAthen decent of him 1"
publicly. “Shake hands with Major Arkwright, Ronald,”
continued Miss Harmer. “He isn't as fierce as he looks.”
Major Arkwright! A hero of whose prowess Ronald had
read! His world was turned upside down.
The Lancers came and went successfully enough. Con-
versation during the Lancers is happily almost impossible;
but when they were over Ronald's troubles began.
“Shall I take you to the refreshments?” he began.
“Oh, we won't bother about refreshments yet. Haven't
done anything to deserve them.”
“I’m sure”—he hesitated and then plunged—“I’m sure
you deserve them, Miss Harmer.”
“Don’t be a complimentary little boy,” laughed the lady;
and the conversation died down to nothing till the blessed
moment came for the music to strike up again.
The waltz was a series of minor disasters. It had been
easy enough to dance the trois-temps at the dancing school,
but here there were scores of gyrating couples, and they
were always in the way. Finally Miss Harmer's dress was
torn. “There,” she said, “I knew that would happen.
Let's sit down for the rest of the dance”—and they did.
Having, so to speak, pumped up from the soles of his shoes
the Academy, the bad weather, the curious behaviour of his
head master, and other topics of conversation, Ronald had
come to the end of his resources.
“I’m not much of a hand at talking,” he said, desperately.
“Oh, you're much better than Major Arkwright,” said
Miss Harmer.
“But he can fight,” said Ronald.
“Pooh,” said the goddess, “what's the good of that in a
ball-room?”
Thereupon the Major came up and claimed her for the
next dance.
These violent conversational efforts had so grievously dis-
couraged Ronald that he resolved to fly. He didn't wait for
the carriage which had been ordered to fetch him, but
dashed for liberty and home on foot. So ended his first
dance. Last week it was his privilege to meet Mrs.
Arkwright with her three grandchildren, and he reminded
her of their dance a century or so ago.

it because Taxation without Representa-
tion is Tyranny.
Cecile (27, organiser) wanted it because
Men are Beasts.
Dorothea (18, organiser) wanted it
because for forty years we had asked
for it by peaceable methods, and now
the time had come for——
“My dear,” said Mary Merton, “that's
hardly a reason for wanting a vote
though it's an excellent reason for——'
“This isn't a question of l'eason,”
said Dorothea, haughtily. “It’s a
question of Justice.”
Mary Merton (22, organiser) wanted it
because of the poor girls in the factories.
Kate (19, organiser) wanted it because
if Men had it, why shouldn't——
“My dear,” said Mary Merton, “the
fact that——”
“Dolly darling,” said Kate quickly, to
Dorothea, “can you reach the biscuits 2
You pig, you've eaten all the sugar
ones.” - -
And Mrs. Trarers (35, organiser)
wanted it because the Women in Finland
had it. Besides, when you were her
age---
“Bother ' " said Dorothea, under her
breath. “Hope I never shall be.”
+ + + * +
“We must think of something new,”
said Miss Blagworthy, striding up and
down the room. Cecile looked straight
in front of her with wide-open eyes, in
the pretence that there was no such
thing as cigarette smoke. The others
thought deeply.
“What about going into a Cabinet
Minister's meeting and saying, ‘Votes
for Women’,” said Mrs. Travers at last.
“In the very middle of the speech, you
know?”
“They won't let us in now,” said
Mary Merton, “and if they do they
throw us out.”
“Men are beasts,” said Cecile, pressing
the red end of her cigarette on to the
ash-tray in order to remove the ash.
“Besides,” said Dorothea sarcastically,
“we want something new.”
Mrs. Travers thought again.
“We might go to a football match,”
she said at last, “what men would call
a very important match, and in the
middle of the over we could all rush on
to the field saying, Votes for Women.'
Men don't like having their games
interrupted.”

“Ugh !” said Cecile with a shudder,
“we should be killed. Beasts.”
“I want to be killed,” said Miss Blag-
worthy in a hollow voice.
“Let's inval—invali–validate another
election by pouring stuff over the ballot-
box,” suggested Dorothea. “I should
love to do it. Shouldn't you, Kate 2"
“It's no good. Men don't play the
game. They would pretend that the
election hadn't been invalidated.”
“It isn't cricket,” coughed Cecile,
“the way men retaliate on us. I
shouldn't mind, even though they are
beasts, if only it was cricket.”
“Why won't they give us the vote?”
cried Mary Merton.
“It will be bombs next time,” said
Cecile languidly.
Miss Blagworthy stopped suddenly in
her pacings.
“I have a plan,” she announced
gloomily.
1.9% what is it?” asked everybody
else.
“We will all go into the House of
Lords when they are discussing the
Budget and cry ‘Votes for x xx
“Yes, but how 2"
“There will be peers there who have
never been in the House of Lords
before—unknown even to the police-
men. We will go disguised as them.”
“Disguised as men 2" said Kate
excitedly. -
“No!” said Mrs. Travers and Mary
Merton firmly.
“We must remember our sex,” said
Cecile gracefully, from a cloud of cigar-
ette smoke, “even though men are
beasts.”
“My dear,” went on Mrs. Travers,
“when you are my age x *
“How ridiculous,” said Dorothea to
Kate, “she's twice as old.”
“I should say she was forty, shouldn't
you? It would be rather fun, I think.”
Miss Blagworthy bowed her head.
“The sense of the meeting is against
line. Very well. Then I have another
lan.” -
“That's better, dearie,” said Mrs.
Travers.
“In future there must be one of us
in attendance at every wedding in
London, to cry "Justice for Women l'
in the middle of the service.”
There was a pause for apprehension.
“Ernest wouldn't have liked that,”
said Mrs. Travers thoughtfully.
“Must we?” said Mary Merton sadly.
“I don't like doing it, but if we
must—”
“You know, I'm not at all sure that
I approve of the marriage service,” said
Cecile.
“Nobody would marry her, I should
say,” said Dorothea to Kate. “She's
too—well—you know.”
“And then when we are arrested——
“Ah!” said Mary eagerly.
“Could they arrest you for that ?”
asked Mrs. Travers doubtfully.
“Obstructing the vicar in the execu-
tion of his duty,” said Kate. “Or brawl-
ing. They'd think of something.”
“Well, then we would refuse to open
our mouths at all—not for anything or
anybody.”
“How about breathing?” said Doro-
thea.
“Through your nose, silly,” said Kate.
“I mean, of course, that we wouldn't
say a word in court—not to answer the
magistrate, or give our names, or any-
thing.”
“I should like just to tell him that I
refused to be judged by man-made
laws,” said Mrs. Travers wistfully.
“No. It must be absolute silence . . .
And now let us go out and begin.”
“It's five o'clock,” said Kate.

“There you are ' " said Cecile. “Look
at that.”
“We can get arrested,” said Miss
Blagworthy, “and begin the Silent
Treatment at once. To Parliament
Square' " -

Miss Blagworthy (34, organiser), hav-
ing been told twice by a police sergeant
to go back to her husband, knocked his
helmet off and cried, “Men of England,
what are you going to do for the
women º’’ The sergeant (speaking
chiefly for himself) sketched out the
immediate programme.
Mrs. Tracers (35, organiser) chained
herself to the railings, and cried, “Votes
for women ' " They got her loose just
as it was beginning to rain.
Mary Melton (22, organiser) pleaded
with a policeman to arrest her, and when
he simply said, “Lor-bless-yer-pretty-
face-no-Miss,” she proceeded to rescue
Miss Blagworthy. This had the desired
effect.
Cecile (27, organiser) stood in the
“NO-
middle of Parliament Square and
brooded upon the scene. “Cowards!”
she muttered to herself. “It is to the
death now,” she added. Then she took
a cab to her club and said, “Bring the
cigarettes, waiter.”
Dorothea (18, organiser), who was new
to London, lost her way and found her-
self in Victoria Street. She had a cup
of tea and half a scone and butter at an
A. B. C., and left a penny under the
plate for the waitress. It was quite an
adventure.
Kate (19, organiser) was ordered by a
fatherly policeman to go home. She went.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
I. The SERVANT IN THE House.
I Doubt if Mr. CILARLES FROHMAN would
have had the hardihood to present the
new Adelphi play if it had not been for
the success of The Passing of the Third
Floor Back, to which it bears a sort of
bastard family likeness. This is not to
imply that Mr. CHARLEs RANN KENNEDY,
who wrote The Serrant in the House,
owes anything for his idea to Mr. JEROME.
“I have waited three years for this
evening,” he told us in a first-night
speech; adding, in a burst of confidence,
“and, by G–, it was worth it.” Not-
withstanding this pious asseveration I
cannot altogether agree with him.
Perhaps he is more easily pleased.
Anyhow, I think him over-sanguine if
he anticipates a success like Mr. JEROME's,
though you can never gauge the hearing
powers of a theatre audience any more
than you can guess beforehand the
acoustic properties of a new building.
In Mr. JEROME's play you had to accept
a miracle, it is true, but, once you had
got over that, the rest was logical and
consistent enough. But The Servant in
the House is a veritable medley of
unthinkable prodigies. It seems an
extraordinary thing that, when the author
The Bishop of Lancashire Mr. J. H. BARNEs.
Robert Smith ... ... Mr. HENRY MILLER.
wants to inculcate a great Biblical
truth, it should be necessary to employ
the machinery of farce; to introduce a
Bishop, for example, disguised as a
native Indian butler, and another
Bishop with an ear-trumpet, and as blind
as a bat, sitting at breakfast with a
scavenger whom he mistakes for a
clerical brother-in-law. I don't know
which figure was the more grotesquely
improbable—this second Bishop, who
apparently had amassed a lot of
bullion by shady processes and frankly
advocated the principle that you
should give as little as possible, and
grab all you can get, or the drain-man,
seized with a sudden passion for making
the acquaintance of his little daughter,
though he might have given himself
this treat any time during the last
thirteen years if the idea had crossed
his mind. Indeed the only characters
that I could get myself to believe in at
all were the comic page-boy and the
very natural snob that was his mistress.
With the former I found myself in close
agreement when he complained, “I
never see such a lot of improbabilities
agoin' on in any house"—or words to
that effect. A very sensible boy.
Mr. KENNEDY was right when he
attributed his triumph—for the house
was very good to him—chiefly to the
merits of the actors, and Mr. HENRY
MILLER in particular. It was, indeed,
a remarkable performance throughout.
Constantly by sheer force of sincerity
they saved the situation when the senti-
ment threatened to be mawkish, or the
melodrama too glaringly Adelphic (old
style).
The author has gifts of humour and
irony, and even in a play so crude in
construction and so noisy in its con-
trasts one might catch imany subtleties
of thought; but no moral purpose is likely
to be achieved among thinking people,
or indeed deserves to be achieved, by
such means as are here employed.
As for his reckless ridicule of the
clergy—two out of the three either are
or have been a disgrace to the cloth—
there are black sheep in every profes-
sion, though not, I hope, in such lavish
proportion to the whole. But I am not
greatly concerned about the Church;
the Church is strong enough to look
after itself. I am more concerned about
the Stage—a much weaker institution.
It cannot afford to play this kind of
game, for ridicule that is obviously
unfair is apt to recoil.
I must not end without saying how
sorry I was for the villain of the
piece, the Bishop of Lancashire. By
some extraordinary oversight no place
was found for him in the scheme of
Universal Love and Brotherhood; yet,
being so uncharitable, he of all others
stood most in need of charity. O. S.
II. The LITTLE DAMozEL.
Have you ever (dear reader) pulled out
your cigarette case, planked it on the
table, and said to your friend, “Have
one of these—my own brand 2" Pro-
bably. But little did you realise then
that, seven years ago, the girl you were
in love with smoked one of them with
you and remembered the aroma so well
that in the next Act she would recognise,
in the husband of the girl who had
been jilted by the man she was about
to marry, no less a person than you, her ||
old lover.
If you don't realise this now—after I
have put it so plainly—it is because
you haven't been to see The Little
Damozel, by MoxckTON HoFFE. The
Little Damozel was Julie Alardy, and
she played the harp in the orchestra of
the Café Angélique. Her relations with
Captain Neil Partington were quite in-
nocent, but the latter had written some
very foolish letters to her, and when he
discarded her and made up to Miss
Captain Neil Parlington Mr. Lyle.
Recklaw Poole ... Mr. Ch.ARLES HAwTney.
Julie Alardy ... Miss MAY BLAYNEy.
Sybil Craven (of Craven Hall, Craven,
Cravenshire) he wanted these letters
back. It was not simply that he had
said, “I love you” in them—Sybil
would have forgiven that; not that he
had added vaguely, “I am not worthy
of you, darling”; but that (apparently)
he had explained in full detail, with
names and dates attached, why he was
not worthy of her.
Julie was dangerous, for she refused
to part with the letters. But Partington
thought of a plan (which never would
have occurred to me).
They were already fond of each other, and
the fact that IRecklaw had suddenly come
into money would weigh with Julie.
Once married, she would forget her
grudge against her old lover.
But [Act II.] Partington had forgotten
the cigarette (as I should have done).
Sybil meets Julie, the latter lights up
one of the old brand, and Sybil says,
“Where have I heard that cigarette |
before ? Yes . . . it is . . . You have
married the man I loved seven years
ago. His name then was Recklaw.”
“Yes,” says Julie, “but he changed it
to Poole when he was warned off the
Turf.” And so it all comes out. Julie,
in frenzy at the plot that was played on
her, leaves her husband for ever.
You see what a jolly lot they are.
But Recklaw has still one card up his
He bribed Reck- |
law Poole, the cigarette smoker, with |
£15,000, to marry The Little Damozel.

sleeve. With his last few thousand
pounds he insures his life in five
companies and prepares to commit
suicide, so that Julie shall have his
money. (Even Mr. MoxcKTON IIoFFE
seemed to think that this was a perfectly
honest thing to do; but perhaps I do
him an injustice. In any case I can
understand that some months in the
company of Poole and Partington would
dull any author's conscience.) Julie
hears of this, realises that Recklaw
really loves her (“I could not love thee,
dear, so much,” etc.), and forgives him.
(And presumably herself for her black-
mail of Partington, her mercenary
motives in marrying, and so forth.)
Much of the dialogue is delightfully
fresh and natural; it is a pity that it
should be partially spoilt by such a
theatrical setting. But Mr. HoFFE takes
his plot quite seriously, and there are
scenes of the utmost pathos in the Third
Act; alas that they should leave our
withers absolutely unwrung. I hope
Mr. HoFFE will write a plain straight-
forward comedy some day, for he has
the gift of easy dialogue.
Mr. Ch.ARLES HAWTREY, as Recklaw
Poole, was all that Mr. HAWTREY always is;
Mr. WANE TEMPEST was beautifully him-
self as himself, and Mr. ARTHUR PLAYFAIR
was particularly excellent as the Café
proprietor—he, at any rate, had stepped
straight from life on to the boards.
Miss MAY BLAYNEY gave a very promising
performance as Julie, but in trying to
be matural was too conscious of both
herself and us. In moments of passion
and pathos she was much more at her
ease. M.

I was glad to see Werradaile again, but I could not help
being sorry at the evident signs of his estrangement from
prosperity. Three years had made a lot of difference.
We talked for half an hour about the weather, the old

With my well-known presence of mind, I explained that

about his greeting the KING on his arrival I haven't placed
anything this time. I made over £20 on his first visit; my
story of how he had a Guardsman led to his nursery each
morning to play with was very popular, and his salute at the
sound of the National Anthem—do you remember?—that
went down splendidly. And I did fairly well out of his
other visits. But this time, after I have spent the last ten
days getting stories ready, the papers won't look at a thing.
It is very unfortunate for me.”
“And the stories that the papers published, and that
went straight home to the nation's heart, were not true?”
I asked, with indignation.
“Oh, they may have been. I kept quite close to the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE Diany of Toby, M.P.
IIouse of Lords, Monday, Oct. 25.-
Deathless originality of our hel editary
legislators, their lofty contempt of the
commonplace, illustrated afresh to-night.
Scorning delights, they have spent
laborious days with Irish Land Bill.
Have so cut it up in Committee that
SAINT AUGUSTINE, regarding the com-
pleted work, does not know his own
child. In genial effort to assist paternal
recognition, noble lords give it a few
more hard knocks.
To-day it comes up for third reading.
Agreed to without discussion ; and
there an end on’t, you suppose. Which
shows you don't know our House of
Lords. LORD CHANCELLOR, having put
question, “That the Bill be now read a
third time,” and declared “The Contents
have it,” up gat DONOUGHMORE and moved
quite new amendment. One of a dozen
that stood on the paper. Had something
to do with arrangement by which pay-
ment of purchases under Act was to be
made in cash, in stock, or partly in each.
MAYo, with characteristic directness
and candour, went to root of matter in
couple of sentences.
“Landlords,” said he, “do Lot look
with favour on payment by means of
stock. They look with very great favour
on cash payments.”
A murmur sounding uncommonly like
the smacking of appreciative lips ap-
proved this noble sentiment.
CREWE sat forlorn, conscious of
arid waste on benches behind him.
Pointed out that amendment would
endanger basis on which provision
was made for payment of purchase
money. But what would you? What
use any more walking through
lobbies, one of a maximum of thirty,
returning to await arrival of ultimate
Peer in jubilant throng of five score
or more coming back from Aye lobby ?
So amendment after amendment was
patched on travesty of Bill that left
Commons a few weeks ago in buoyant
vigour.
With respect to one of them. CREWE
pointed out how it would hamper
operation of Act, plaintively adding:
“But as the noble Earl sets great
store by it I will not detain your
Lordships by discussing it.”
Bang went another chunk of origi-
mal Bill. In the end motion made and
agreed to “that the Bill do pass.”
Business dome.—Wreck of Irish
Land Bill towed out on its way
back to Commons. |
House of Commons, Tuesday.—
Whilst Questions went forward,
uneasiness manifested on faces of
peaceful Members seated by Mr.
REMNANT. Learned Member, with foot
“Talk of remnants,” said Winterton, “if he
got hold of Ure—--”
crossed over knee, was rapidly passing
hand backward and forward upon
upper leather of boot as if sharpening
a knife. His lips moved; echo of refrain
RIMARKABLE PERSISTENCE OF TYPE IN LORD CHANCELLORs.
(Lord Loreburu or Lord Halsbury—which 2)
was heard. As far as it could be caught
it sounded like
Fee Fi Fo Fate:
I smell the blood of Lord Advocate.
Explanation forthcoming when REM-
NANT, jumping up, asked PREMIER “if
he would put some curb upon the
LORD ADvoCATE 2'' Picture of Mr. URE
with bit in mouth, led about by PREMIER,
bridle in hand, tickled fancy of House.
ASQUITH made no response to tempting
invitation. REMNANT mot to be disposed
of on such terms. As everybody knows,
LORD ADVOCATE, least emotional-looking
man on Treasury Bench, been going
to and fro saying things about Old Age
Pensions, Dukes and other folk, poor
but homest. REMNANT thirsting for
opportunity to be at him. The late
Earl Ch.ATHAM's earnest desire for closer
contiguity with Lord STRACHAN, a desire
reciprocated by his noble friend, was
nothing compared with Mr. REMNANT's
yearning to have his fingers in the Lond
ADVOCATE's flowing locks.
“Talking of remnants,” said WINTER-
TON, regarding with admiration his
bench companion, “if he got hold of
URE, the fragments would not fill any-
thing like six baskets.”
Receiving no encouragement from
PREMIER, REMNANT appealed to SPEAKER.
Asked if he would be in order in moving
adjournment of House in order to
discuss LoRD ADVOCATE's “scandalous
utterances.”
By strange coincidence, FIENNES, seated
on benches opposite, equally anxious to
discuss the subject. Has placed
notice of motion on paper. Doesn't
mention a day for bringing it on.
Practical effect the same. Other
Members desiring to hurry up the
matter find the way blocked. Thus
the SPEAKER ruled.
So REMINANT dropped back in his
seat, comforting himself with re-
sumption of chant and of the little
by-play with the top-leather of his
boot.
Business done.—Licencing Clauses
of Budget Bill dealt with in Com-
mittee. FABER draws blood-curdling
picture of Ministers on Treasury
Bench — a black-bearded, high-

and act with the I. L. P. In other words,
instead of continuing the service to their
constituents and the British Workman,
conspicuously and successfully rendered,
in BURT's case for thirty-five years, in
FENwick's for nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury, they shall become automata, toeing
the line where DON'T KEIR HARDIE
chalks it.
As might be expected, the sturdy
Northumbrians decline proffered posi-
tion. By overwhelming majority domi-
nant wire-pullers of the Association BURT
founded and has given the best years of
his life to nurture, bade them be gone.
Familiar axiom that there is no grati-
tude in politics. Latest testimony to
its truth goes far beyond modern ex-
perience. BURT was the first genuine
working man to take his seat in House
of Commons. The MEMBER FOR SARK,
returned in same year (1874), and like
the Member for Morpeth since uninter-
ruptedly representing same constituency,
well remembers sensation created. To
the working man it was of inestimable
value that the experiment should have
been initiated by such individuality.
What might have happened was later
suggested by return of another Labour
Member sent to Westminster by a
Staffordshire town. A vain windy
person, he represented the class of tub-
thumpers who occasionally (happily only
temporarily) enthral the guileless work-
ing man, nobbling Trade Associations,
using their machinery for displacement
of worthier men. : -
From the first, as unto this last, BURT
habitually kept himself in the back-
ground, though missing no opportunity
of coming to the front when interests
of his fellow-workmen were at stake.
He gradually won the esteem and con-
fidence of all sections of the House.
There is to-day no Member whose rising
in debate would be more warmly wel-
comed, whose counsels would have
weightier effect. When Mr. G. formed
his last Ministry he amid general ac-
claim made the Member for Morpeth
Parliamentary Secretary of Board of
Trade. Coming into his inheritance
four years ago, one of C.-B.'s first acts
was to add the name of THOMAS BURT
to the roll of Privy Councillors.
Thus, in Parliamentary debate and
on postal address, he became Right
Honourable. A proud distinction, suffi-
cient for Dizzy in his prime, serving
PEEL and GLADSTONE to the last. For
BURT it was confirmation by royal grace
of habitual circumstance. He was
right honourable when, at the age of
ten, he began to work as a pit-boy.

MR. STEAD's conversation with Dis-
RAELI, in the course of which the august
shade advised the Lords to pass the
Budget, is but one of many of his dia-
logues with the dead which, if not so
happy as Lucian's, are at any rate more

As a matter of fact, the spirits spring
up in Julia's Bureau with such rapidity
that even Mr. STEAD has difficulty in
keeping pace with them.
Of what CobdeN said to W. T. S. with
regard to the Bermondsey Election it is

genial JACK DUMPHREYs, and the rumour
that his last words to W. T. S. were
“Tell him on no account to shave" is
inexact.

be very dull if they do.
W. T. S. Why dull?

MORE ESSAYS IN EULOGY.
[Suggested by Mr. Lloyd George's magnifi-
cent panegyric of Mr. Balfour as one of the
greatest assets and luxuries of the House of
Commons.] -
SPEARING at the Annual Banquet of
Amalgamated Pianola Players, at which
Miss Carrie Morelli was the principal
guest, the toast of the evening was
proposed by Mr. Allcane in a speech
of extraordinary eloquence and effusion.
He said that the blind and doddering
tribe of reviewers, whose fatuous imbe-
cility would be contemptible if it were
not so malevolent, had always sought to
misrepresent the mutual attitude of
delicious experiences. In conclusion
she expressed her grave doubts whether
there was any country in which such
a speech could be delivered on such
an occasion and on such a subject
except this country; and whether any
man could have made such a speech
who was not a Manxman.
THE NEW GAMES.
The long evenings being upon us, an
emissary of the P. M. G. has been en-
quiring into what has been done to help
kill them by the ingenious brains that
make the nation's pastimes, and he has
discovered at least one treasure, entitled
near to satisfy the artistic conscience of
makers and players of games—to Mrs.
PANKHURST, and the Geese are Liberal
politicians. There is also a “Fox and
Geese,” in which the Fox is labelled the
Censor and the Geese are the Dramatists.
“Families,” that admirable friend of
our childhood, also breaks out in several
new forms. There is, for example, the
“Cabinet Family,” in which each mem-
ber of that body is supplied (purely for
festive purposes and entirely without
prejudice) with a highly-coloured help-
meet of grotesque appearance and three
comic children. To complete as many
of these apochryphal families as may be
is, of course, the object of the players.
Miss Morelli and himself and
to make out that one or other
or both were animated by a
spirit of internecine rivalry. So
far was this from being correct
that he was the first person,
many years ago, to lend his
sister artist a helping hand
and assist her in planting her
dainty but tottering steps on
the ladder of fame. He never
repented that service; indeed
he was proud of it. He and
Carrie—might he call her
Carrie?— (Terrific applause,
during which Miss Morelli sig-
mified her assent with a bewitch-
ing inclination of her tiara-
crowned head)—did not always
see eye to eye. There had
been occasions on which she
had not spared his feelings but
had castigated him with the
lash of a severe but salutary
criticism. But that did not
prevent him at this harmonious
feast from expressing with a
full heart his sincere con-
viction that Carrie Morelli was
one of the most remarkable
women who had ever lent
additional lustre to the solar
system. In the words of the
hymn:— -
“AVE, CAESAR
MORITURI TE SALUTAMU.S.”
The old “Family Coach”
has been brought up to date
under the title of “The Family
Aeroplane,” and no one can
emerge from the rigours of this
pastime without a considerable
knowledge of aerial engineer-
ing. Each child having assumed
his or her part—one being the
motor, one the lifting rud-
der, one the steering rudder,
one the left wing, one the
right wing, one the lever,
and so forth, the narrative is
read out and the trencher spun
exactly, as in the “Family
Coach.”
Among the new puzzles,
without the diverting assistance
of which it would be practically
impossible to get through such
a world of frustration and bad
weather at all, are some with
such attractive names as “Pop-
Wozzle,” “Inky-Winky,” and
“Solbobs.” “Pop-Wozzle” is a
convex board with four depres-
sions at each end and four steel
balls. The thing is to get the
balls from one end to the other
without touching them, merely
by raising and depressing the
board. As it is highly polished
and has no raised edge, the
Imagination's widest stretch
In wonder dies away
in the vain attempt to render justice to
her sumptuous intellect—(cheers)—her
mellifluous mentality — (Kentish Fire)
—her gorgeous and supra-tropical im-
agination — (prolonged and enthusiastic
plaudits). - -
Miss Morelli, rising with a swanlike
stateliness that greatly added to the
impressiveness of her reply, observed
that seldom, if ever, had a famous
authoress occupied a more embarrassing
position. But she was not going to
pretend to a mock modesty which she
did not possess. Praise to the face was
trying, but when it was laid on with
the trowel of merit to the mens conscia
recti of genius, there were few more
“Temperanzo,” which has been devised
for temperance people “anxious to com-
bine moral instruction with entertain-
ment. Played with a numbered dice (sic)
and black balls, after the manner of
most board games, the ultimate goal is
either ‘the happy home’ or ‘the work-
house'; much on the lines of ‘The Boy:
What will he become?’ showing the
various stages.”
Another game, called with equal wit
“Racecorso,” which has been devised by
Mr. Punch, is on similar lines; and
together they are calculated to sow
the most valuable seeds in whatever
nurseries they are played in.
An excellent topical variety of “Fox
and Geese’’ is now ready, in which the
Fox bears a resemblance—sufficiently
player spends most of his time on the
floor picking up the balls; and thus the
dreary day passes.
And Germany ? What are they doing
there? What form does the strenuous
life take with which we are thus frivolously
occupied ? Well, many of these games
are made in Germany.
“But it was a hopeless matter to try to drive
the camel of landlordism through a needless
eye.”
The humps of unearned increment would
stick in the least uncalled-for eye.

MEssits. Hutchinson, who publish it, are confident that
Mr. W. B. MAxwell's new book, Seymour Charlton, “will be
recognised as one of this popular author's finest efforts.”
That, for a publishers' announcement, strikes me as, un-
usually modest. They might have said much more without
going beyond the mark. Seymour Charlton is a powerful
satire on contemporary life in high places, which combines
the grand manner of better days with the keen insight and
extensive and peculiar information which is the boast, but
not always the possession, of the modern journalist. It is
for this, for I should feel far more confidence in using slang
myself if I were certain that it was not merely the language
of decadence, but the natural effervescence of these hardy
Suffolk salts.
In the tale of Denis Yorke's school life—which is not the
least impressive part of The First Round (METHUEN)—Mr.
St. John LUCAS starts “one up " on most writers of school
stories, and wins the realistic medal by about seven up and
six to play. Unfettered by the thought, that he is writing
for boys to read, he has not attempted to gloss over the
unpleasant side of school-life. Here, as he sees it, is a
faithful picture of a public school, and parents possessing
boys of artistic instinct may be advised to study it carefully.

breath before the breaker crashes on to the beach. Any
way, there is no denying that he has caught the “surge
and thunder” of his foreground, and is quite as much at
home on (or just off) the East coast as a herring would be.
Watchers by the Shore (METHUEN) is a novel of primitive
emotions and uneducated people, whose story has value
because it is touched with the rude grandeur of their sur-
roundings. The author has sternly resisted the temptations
of conventional melodrama, for the betrayer of his heroine, a
man with some very contemptible moments, turns over a
new leaf and marries her in the end, whilst her “adopted "
father, who threatens to murder the villain (and very nearly
does murder his brother as the supposed offender), becomes
finally his friend and boat-mate. The character of Joan is a
little colourless, but those of Gideon, her protector, Huldah,
his superstitious wife, and Knut, the “wise man” (I am glad
there are really people called “Knut") are excellent studies.
For the most part, too, Mr. PATTERSON's fishermen do not
unduly philosophise, and their verbal “ dialectic" is very
plausible. This makes it the more surprising to me that the
words “ripping,” “bounder” and “rot” are all put into their
mouths. I should like to know whether there is authority
temperament, and he
treats Bohemian London with both love and justice. The
First Round is by no means a short one, but I was far
from being tired at the end of it.
Richard Noy “divided women roughly into those who had

of course; that is merely a figure of speech). “It" was
something indefinable yet quite perceptible. The women
he felt he could be in sympathy with had It, and yet he
deliberately married one without. The Intruding Angel
(HURST and BLACKETT), by Mr. Ch.ARLES MARRIOTT, is |.
story, and whether because of his selection of the wrong girl,
or because of his rather tedious habit of introspection in
which the author encourages him, it failed to excite my very
deep interest. “The intruding angel” is the lady he ought
to have married, only she doesn't intrude until too late, and
then she is rather too soulful (though common sense is her
strong point), and a little bit of a nuisance. I found both
her and Richard unconvincing. Each is so terribly good
at answering the other's questions before they have been
uttered that I couldn't help suspecting that the author
gave them the tip.

THE QUESTION OF THE HOUR.
[It is rumoured that the better class of women are in revolt against
the “turban' style of coiſture, and desire to revert to the old system of
pin-curls.]
LET Liberals sing (or even roar
While I am till upon my feet)
The praise of Members who ignore
Fair Play when suffering from the heat;
Let Tory minstrels intimate
Whose was the shield that wanted cleaning
When Scot met Scot in grim debate
With yet a third Scot intervening;-
For me I loose a loſtier theme,
Shall live when Lethe's tides obscure
(Like memories of an ugly dream)
The episode of Mr. URE;
To wider issues I am wed,
Less crudely banal, less suburban,
And ask, Shall Woman have her head
Swathed in a horrid hairy turban Ž
Shall Woman take it lying down,
And cringe to Fashion's dumped decree,
Taught how to titivate her crown
By mannequins from over-sea?
What! shall our sisters take their tone
From stuff that France decides to sell 'em,
Reckless of what becomes their own
Peculiar style of cerebellum ?
I hear the hoarse appeal go out:—
England how long before we tire
Of twists and twiddles roped about
A sketchy scaffold-work of wire 2
Put off, put off your alien “swirls,”
Resume the arts that better fit you—
Those little inexpensive curls
With pins to keep 'em stuck in situ. O. S
AN INTERESTING LITTLE COUNTRY.
GREECE, a country which has been much in the public
eye of late, is a land of no little interest, with quite a history
of its own. -
Long before you and I were born, dear reader, its
inhabitants evinced an intelligence which, considering the
remoteness of their time from our own day, with its
intellectual advantages, must be designated as little short
of remarkable. Greece, in fact, is a veritable home of song
and story, and its artistic achievements might put to the
blush even the works of some of our modern artists.
This rugged little country, whose shores were then lapped
by the blue waters of the Mediterranean just as they are
to-day, had its poets, its authors, its philosophers, its artists
its orators, its dramatists, and its mil tary geniuses literally
thousands of years ago (this is no exaggeration), many of
whom would have compared favourably in their own parti-
cular callings with our own Mr. HARLD BEGBIE, Mr. WILLIAM LE
QUEUx, Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON, Sir HUBERT HERKoMER, Mr. URE,
Mr. So MERSET MAUGHAM, and Sir Robert BADEN-Powell.
The Greeks were not only a remarkably intelligent people,
they were physically a fine race of men. Although golf,
cricket, football, and other of cººr popular games were not
known to them, they devoted much time to athleticism, and
it is no secret that our own word Marathon had its origin
in Grecian legend.
If they were not altogether orthodox in their theological
outlook, they were distinctly religious, their multiplicity of
deities keeping them ever on the alert for the complete
performance of their devotional obligations. Certainly in
the temples that they reared they were not wanting in a
sense of the dignity that befits the building in which one's
public religious du'y is performed. The Parthenon is the
name of one of these temples, and, all things considered,
it does great credit to the somewhat primitive people that
erected it. It is a que tion whether many of our building
contractors of the present day, with their mortar-mixing
machines, steam cranes, and other modern inventions,
could greatly improve upon this structure.
Finally, in all matters of taste, the Greeks of old came
very nearly up to the standards of our day.
A STUDY IN LIGHT GREEN.
IN connection with the rumour that Mr. GLADSTONE is to
be appointed first Governor of United South Africa, The
Westminster Gazette has been rebuking The Times for its
“partisan attack” upon that gentleman. To the perfect
partisan, of course, all things are partisan, and it may not
have occurred to The Westminster that The Times might, in
considering this rumoured appointment, have conceivably
criticised Mr. GLADSTONE on his actual merits. It would be
instructive to apply The Westminster's methods of rebuke
to one of its own paragraphs appearing on the same day
and page, and running as follows:–
“Lord Tiverton, Lord HALSBURY's son and heir, who has been
adopted as Tariff Reform Candidate for Carmarthen, has hitherto shown
more interest in the stage than in politics. Under the name of
‘Oliver Bath,' it may be remembered, he wrote a musical comedy
ent tied Naughty Nancy, which was produced some years ago at the
Savoy Theatre without exactly setting the adjacent river on fire.
Perhaps, however, Lord TiVERTON, who is not yet thirty, will do better
at St. Stephens.”
Let us take ourselves very seriously and pay The West-
minster the flattery of imitation. Let us use its rebuke to
The Times for our model, and see what can be done by way
of rebuke for this “partisan attack” on Lord TIVERTON :—
“It seems to us that, since {º. will not be { Hºl.

No other paper, not even the penny ones on the Tory
side, had had wind of it. To The Daily News alone has
been confided the information that “three hundred Peers
have intimated to Lord Lansdowne their intention of voting
against the second reading of the Finance Bill.” One pictures

SOCIETIES WE ADMIRE (BUT do NOT BELONG TO).-No. 1.
The Society For securiNG UNDISTURBED MEALs For The wee BiRDIE8 of LoNDON.
A GAMBOLLING BEANO.
AN addition to the already existing
facilities for gambling has just been
invented, we regret to say, by Mr. CYRIL
MAUDE, and in the interest of so inno-
cent a charity as the Actors' Orphanage.
The proceedings are fatally simple.
Each sportsman first lassoes, bird-limes,
waylays, or otherwise catches a Mexi-
can jumping bean, which he then
matches against the other players' beans
in the middle of some concentric
circles drawn upon a heated plate.
The owner or trainer of the bean which
first jumps the outer circle takes the
pool.
We have here the alarming prospect
of our hitherto unsullied Englishmen's
Homes being turned into little Monte
Carlos by this insidious game of chance.
The blameless firesides of Baron's Court
and Golder's Green will alike rever-
berate with the hoarse cry of the
croupier announcing “La fêre est
sautée—rien me ra plus !”
The guileless mothers'-meeting of the
Smart Set known as a “beanfeast "will
henceforward acquire a sinister signifi-
cation, while to give a person beans will
be to consign him to utter perdition.
There are still other and darker
aspects of this most unhappy discovery
of Mr. MAUDE's. Think of the overstrung
nerves of the unfortunate maggot-occu-
pant, forced to imitate a cat upon hot
bricks, and of the unhealthy rivalry and
lowered moral tone of the beans in their
struggle for victory. There will be
doped beans and gingered beans, and,
we shudder to say, boiled beans—in fact
all the malpractices of the turf and the
gaming-table combined.
No, this will not do at all. Our un-
spotted purity has gone, and we are no
longer ignorant how many beans make
five. We can only suggest that all who
may be bitten by the jumping vegetable
should forward a shilling each to the
fund in question by way of conscience
money.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BEWARE I
O YOU that hold that Britain grows degenerate,
That all her fighting spirit's passed away,
That Luxury's the only god we venerate,
And War a thing that fills us with dismay,
Go, listen to the party politician
(Who clearly represents the common folk),
And there you’ll find the Briton of tradition
As loud a warrior as ever spoke.
The merest phase of controversial prattle
Is lifted to a military plane;
They never pass a day without a “battle,”
And everyone's engaged in a “campaign";
The Minister, whose conduct of the nation
Is hampered by the party that oppose,
Can hardly make a popular oration
Without “declaring war” upon his “foes.”
The stumper armed with demagogic speeches
Invariably strikes a martial chord,
And, calling on the mob to “man the breaches,”
Remarks that he s about to “draw the sword.”
“The fighting” will be fierce, no doubt, but glorious;
Ther “troops” are being “marshalled” to the field;
And all their ranks, agog to be victorious,
Are “marching on ” to conquer, not to yield.
The speaker means to keep the “colours flying.”
(He generally “nails them to the mast”),
And tells you straight that, if it comes to dying,
The ditch that he's selected is the “last.”
And every word is fully up to Cocker
And free alike of fear and of reproach;
With lots of “ammunition in the locker,”
As long as there's a lozenge or a troche.
Let no misguided Continental Caesar
Imagine that the country's on the drop,
When military phrases such as these are
The politician's ordinary shop.
For who can hear these martial voices welling,
And doubt that Britain's warlike at the core?
Tho' some among the brave were first in yelling
Against the country when she was at war.
It only shows it's well to keep an eye on
The mask our heroes on occasion wear;
That if you scratch the rat, you'll find the lion;
It takes a bit of scratching, but he's there.
And still the ancient spirit of bravado
Is breathed into our members—by the lungs;
And the meanest is a bloody desperado,
And a beggar in a Battle—of the Tongues.
DUM-DUM.

Livadia. At a subsequent luncheon Rifaat Pasha sat on His Majesty's

No doubt any little awkwardness that arose was soon
smoothed over; but another time RIFAAT must look where
he is sitting.
Extract from a letter to The Nation :-
“If the Lords have “climbed down' it will have taken all the steam
out of our boiler.”
Which looks as if their former position were on the safety-valve.
IN DEFENCE OF OUR FACES.
MR. J. A. MACDONALD, Editor of The Toronto Globe and
lately a delegate of the Imperial Press Conference, has been
publishing criticisms on England as he found her. The
following passage is representative: “The thing that stands
out as the background of every reminiscence was the
bloodless, mirthless, hopeless face of the common crowd";
in London he found “the hollow-eyed procession”; at Ports-
mouth he remarked “the human sediment that littered the
doorways”; at Sheffield he was staggered by the “stooped
shoulders, hollow chests, ash-coloured faces, lightless eyes,
and loose-set mouths with bloodless gums.” One letter of
protest has already appeared, and we are happy to be able
to present our readers with other correspondence on this
grave matter.
SIR,--I write on behalf of my poor wife, who is much
distressed by Mr. MACDONALD's remarks. She had intended
to be out in the lane in her Sunday best, which we had
specially redeemed for the occasion, when Mr. MACDONALD
passed. She pleads that she truly miscalculated the time,
so that she was engaged in washing-up when IT occurred.
She was stooping over the tub, so that her chest was
temporarily hollow, and if there was no light in her eyes
there was soap, and, if this is not sufficient excuse, let it
be added that I was not in the house. She objects to being
call d “human sediment,” but I tell her that this is a
common form of colonial greeting, and that affection in
Toronto always expresses itself in this way. She also bids
me to put in a word for myself, and to say that she has
conclusively proved, in a moment of (regretted) passion, that
my face is not habitually anaemic, and she would like to
make the same experiment on Mr. MACDONALD.
Yours, etc., ALFRED SMITH.
Rye Lane, Portsmouth.
SIR,-My solicitor tells me that I have no real case for
libel against Mr. MACDONALD, but I am convinced that his
unfair strictures refer to me. I was on the pavement close
to him as he passed into the White City, and I felt him
stare at me. My vertebral nerves tingled under his scrutiny:
the blood fled from my face to my nose, where it remains
to this day in spite of massage. When I returned home, my
wife told me I was the picture of misery, and called in the
doctor. I regret to say that at present no treatment has
availed. Is it right, Sir, that a man should abuse our
nation for the maladies which he himself has caused by
looking at us mperially? Yours, etc.,
Shepherd's Bush. ALFRED SMITII.
SIR,-On the day when Mr. MACDONALD inspected our works
I was not at my best. Things had upset me. The previous
evening I had had a serious political quarrel which ended in
a street fight. My mouth was much damaged, my front
teeth having been knocked out for the Cause. So far
from being hollow, however, my eyes were much swollen,
and I can only discredit the accuracy of Colonial observation
in this matter. Besides, I had been unable to get the water
to boil for my tea before starting to work; my baby had
cried all night; I had pinched my finger in the door; my
mate had taken sick leave, and his substitute was incom-
petent. All these things combined to make me a poor
specimen on that eventful morning when the Great Editor
LOOKED at me. But my usual nickname in the works is
Rubicund Alf, which, I think, amply disposes of the too-hasty
fictions published in Toronto. Yours, etc.,
Sheffield. ALFRED SMITH.

THE FIFTH.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I feel sure you
will like to hear of our Fifth of Novem-
ber celebrations. We always do our
best to have a jolly might; but this
year surpassed all expectations in two
ways, as I will tell.
We began, however, with a little
difference of opinion which I was afraid
might ruin everything. You see, we
always have to decide as to who the
guy shall represent, which is a matter
of no small importance. Well, we met
as usual to discuss this point, and found
to our horror that we were exactly
divided for and against Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE. Father, Cecil, and I were for
Lloyd GEORGE, and Uncle Dick, Horace
Campbell (the Vicar's son), and Norah
against him. So we called in the Vicar
to give the casting vote. He made an
impressive speech in doing so. His
own feeling, he said, was that it was a
mistake to have what he called topical
guys. The Fifth of November stood
for a real event, and should be per-
petuated as such, and for his part he
would like to see the effigy of GUY
FAWKES, and GUY FAWKES only. Con-
sidering everything, however, particu-
larly the distressing times in which
we lived, he should give his casting
vote for Mr. LLoyd GEORGE.
The point thus decided, we set to
work at once to make the guy, upon
which, lest there should be any mistake,
we fixed its name on a very legible label.
We them stuffed it full of explosives.
The great evening at last arrived, and
all the villagers came on the lawn, as
they always do, and Father made them
a little speech before we went to the
field where the bonfire was. They were
a little restless, and some of the boys
rather spoilt the effect of the oratory
by letting off crackers; but it was im-
pressive none the less. After welcoming
them, and saying that when the fire was
over there would be a barrel of beer on
tap – (cheers)— Father said that he
wanted them to be as happy as possible,
but not quite to lose sight, even in their
wildest moments, of what it all meant.
“The Fifth of November,” he said, “is,
with the exception of elections—and I
hope all you men,” he added, “are
going to vote straight when the elec-
tions come, probably in January—the
only occasion on which we are able
without hindrance to express our
opinion of tyranny, oppression, Social-
ism, robbery, and all other detestable
things. I trust you will all look very
carefully at our guy this evening, be-
cause it has been chosen and made with
great care. And now I wish you all a
jolly evening.”
Father finished there, but the Vicar,
I am sorry to say, was very cross with
him. “My dear Sir,” he said, “don’t
let them go without saying something
as to the real origin of the annual car-
mival.” But Father refused. “Next
year,” he said, “not to-night. Let them
be happy to-night;" and of course he
had his way.
We then all went to the field, where
a barrel of tar had just been poured
over the wood, and then Father lit it,
while we all cheered, and then the
villagers marched round it singing
“Rule Britannia,” “God Save the
“King,” “In the Twilight.” “Put me
among the Girls,” and other suitable
songs, and then, when the flames were a
little lower, we brought the guy out of
the summer-house, where it had been
put, and carried it to the fire.
We were carrying it round the fire,
while the villagers were all cheering,
when Father screamed out, “Stop !
Stop!” We stopped, of course. “Who's
been altering the name?” he roared.
The name ! And then for the first
time we saw that, instead of “Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE,” the label now read “Mr. BAL-
Four.” We were thunderstruck. “Who
did that?” Father roared again; but
no one said anything. “I demand
an answer,” Father cried again. But
still no one spoke ; and in a perfect
fury Father left the field.
Everyone was very uncomfortable, and
I don't know what would have happened
if the Vicar had not seized the guy, and,
tearing off the Mr. BALFOUR label, roared
out, “Three groans for GUY FAWKES "
We all groaned for Guy FawkEs with
great spirit and excitement, and the guy
was then flung on the fire and the songs
began again. Everyone threw squibs at
everyone else, and was very jolly.
So the evening was saved, and was
indeed, as I said, so far as fire and fire-
works were concerned, quite perfect.
We have not yet discovered who
changed the label; but I have more
than a doubt about Norah.
Yours sincerely, John Mowbray.

MUSICAL JOTTINGS.
The revival of the concertina by Mr.
Josef HolbrookE, who has restored to its
proper position this Cinderella of the
orchestra, has already exerted a most
encouraging influence on the prospects |
of other equally spiritual but even more |
cruelly neglected instruments.
Mr. Hamish McKeltie, the famous
Gaelic composer who was recently inter-
viewed by our representative, has an
unlimited belief in the orchestral capa-
bilities of the bagpipes, which he intends
to exploit in his new comic golfing opera
called Mairi of Machrihanish. Asked
why he had such faith in the bagpipes,
Mr. McKeltie replied that it was not
patriotism but aesthetic intuition that
inspired his admiration.
of the bagpipes,” he replied, “is fruitier
and more pungent than that of any other
instrument. Of course, the ordinary
bagpipes is practically a parlour tow, and
is apt to be submerged in an orchestra.
What I want, and what I am having
specially made for my opera, is an in-
strument of the dimensions of a full-
grown giraffe, with a bellows about the
size of a grand piano. Such an instru-
ment in the hands of a capable player
will simply electrify an audience. It
can emit a high snarl, beside which the
trumpeting of a wounded elephant sounds
tame. The timbre of its upper register
is curiously like the unearthly yell of
the gorilla, the most sinister of all sylvan
sounds.”
As for Mairi of Machrihanish, Mr.
McKeltie describes it as a psychical ex-
travaganza, standing midway between the [
mysticism of DEBUSSY and the pragma-
tism of RICHARD STRAUSS. Strictly, it is
termed an “ethico-lyrico-music-parable"
with a touch of subliminal bizarrerie
thrown in. The libretto is by the
Marquis of Mull, whose fine version of
The Ancient Mariner in the heroic
couplet recently created such a stir in
literary circles, and the composer has
assigned a leading motive to all the
principal characters, viz., Mairi, Hector
McPherson (+ 2), General McBogey
(scratch), Wullie (a Caddie), and Albert
Perkins of Tooting Bec, the villain of
the plot, who tries to brain Hector with
a miblick, but is foiled in his fell intent
by the devoted Wullie, and condemned
to spend every Sunday for two years in
Glasgow.
Mr. BAMBERGER, on the other hand, is
an enthusiastic believer in the tonal
potentialities of the Jew's-harp, which
he declares to be more ethereally sug-
gestive than any other instrument. As
he happily expressed it in an interview
with our representative, “There is an
“The colour !

exquisitely quangly-wangly flavour about
this much-maligned mouth-organ which
always fills me with ineffable delight,
and transports me in a moment to the
vine-clad summits of Palestine.” Asked
whether he thought that the harp that
once resounded in Tara's Halls was of
this pattern, Mr. BAMBERGER said that
Professor Kuno Meyer inclined to favour
the theory that it was more closely allied
to the Welsh harp. Anyhow, he is re-
solved to do what he can to revive the
glories of this superb implement, and at
his next recital will introduce a new
somata for piano and harp, in which he
will play the former with his mose and
left hand and the latter with his month
and right hand. A portrait of Mr.
BAMBERGER executing this remarkable
feat, painted by his father-in-law, Sir
Pompey Boldero, will soon be on view
at all the stations on the underground
and tube railways.
Lord Royal de Warden, the distin-
guished millionaire musician, has long
been anxious to exploit the possibilitics
of the comb. This charming instru-
ment, so sadly overlooked in the modern
passion for sonority, has a tender and
toothsome timbre which is all its own.
Intensified by a PARSONs' auxetophone,
it develops a penetrating quality un-
surpassed by any other instrument.
Lord Royal de Warden has now formed
an orchestra of one hundred performers,
fifty of whom are equipped with soprano
and fifty with tenor tortoiseshell combs.
The balance of tone is pronounced to be
extraordinarily perfect by those who have
been privileged to attend the perform-
ances of what is known at Dover as the
Royal Beach-combers' Band.
Mr. Archy Pelago, who is one of the
most prominent luminaries of the Young
British School, has just completed a
quartet for the somewhat novel com-
bination of Ocarima, mirliton, tenor
schreckhorn, and contrabass-Dudelsack.
The new work, which is exciting the
liveliest apprehensions in musical circles,
will be shortly produced at one of the
Bentwood concerts.
THE DILEMMA.
["I am in the unique and unfortunate position
that I am blamed if I speak, and cursed if I
remain silent.”—Lord Rosebery.]
PITY a puzzled peer
Whose duty is far from clear:
Whatever his action,
Grave dissatisfaction
Is hooted from far and near.
In days when that peer was young
His praises were loudly sung;
The world was delighted
And all were united
In praise of his silver tongue.
Client. “I wish To see oNE of YoUR PRINCIPALS, PLEASE.”
Clerk. “Yes, Silt; whar MATTER Is IT ‘RE’?”
But now if he breathes a word
The fury of men is stirred,
And everyone rates him
And bitterly slates him
As soon as his voice is heard.
He talks mere Tory rot;
He's all that he once was not;
He's stupid and mulish
And selfish and foolish–
In short, he's a bad, bad lot.
But, if he attempts to stay
At home in a quiet way,
They all grow abusive
Of one so elusive,
And terrible things they say.
Their energy all is spent
In finding their wrath a vent
On one who is skulking
And, coward-like, sulking
Alone in his shameful tent.
If silence is quite taboo
And speech is forbidden too,
If he's cursed for a clacker
And damned for a slacker,
What is a poor peer to do?
A Natural Error.
From “Notes and Queries,” in The
-Field :—
“About two months ago some workmen on
this estate noticed a fox carrying something
which at first they thought to be a cock pheasant.
On giving chase the fox dropped its breakfast,
which was found to be an eel.”
Possibly the fox also thought it was a
cock pheasant at first.

“Drawing Room” at which the heroine (U.S.A.) was pre-
sented is certainly far in advance of common experience.
Picture the following:— -
“A battalion [sic] of the Grenadier Guards was on duty in the palace
quadrangle sitting their horses like statues, their accouterments ſeven
the spelling has an exotic touch] gleaming in the moonlight.”
Nothing, however, is said of the veteran Earl Roberts
being in command of this magnificent squadron of artillery,
and, with his own rifle, setting the time for the feu de joie
which is so popular a feature at all our best Drawing Rooms. |

PUNCH,
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtracteD FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Novem-
ber 1st.—Advance of Mr. DUMPHREYS up
floor of House, escorted by Opposition
Whips, was marked by one of those per-
somal incidents that attract Members
even more than a clause of the Budget
Bill or a marrow squeak for Ministers
in Division Lobby. Time was when
House proudly reflected on circumstance
that among its Membership it owned
not one but two of the finest beards in
Christendom. One was cultivated (pro-
bably on a little oatmeal) by DoNALD
MACFARLANE, sometime Member for Ar-
gyllshire; the other by our dear John
AIRD, whose withdrawal from the Par-
liamentary scene is regretted on both
sides. Invidious to attempt comparison.
Suffice it to say that their combined
lengths, if joined hair to hair, would
have encircled St. Paul's Cathedral
fifteen times.
Their glory has departed from West-
minster. Save for Sir John KENNAway,
and he is about to leave us, the present
House is equally democratic and beard-
less. The new Member for Bermondsey
brings to consideration of State affairs a
pair of whiskers that will do something
to redress the balance between the old
House and the new.
His entrance hailed this afternoon
with tumultuous cheers from Opposition,
who see in result of Bermondsey Election
the writing on the wall which shall
direct Peers what to do with Budget
Bill. Often read of stormy cheers. For
first time realised appropriateness of
adjective. As applause swelled, the
current of air artificially created and
directed upon the person of new Member
caught his voluminous whiskers; waved
them up and down, as a pennant flouted
by a breeze at the masthead is tossed
to and fro.
Generally agreed that nothing like
it ever seen in House before. BAN-
BURY says it's a portent; means that
the Lords will blow the Budget Bill
into space as if it were a spare whisker
or a wisp of straw.
Business done.—Lords' amendments
to Town Planning Bill considered; most
important rejected.
Wednesday.—No one looking on scene
when SON AUSTEN rose this afternoon to
move rejection of Budget Bill on third
reading would guess that Parliament
and the country are on the eve of one of
the most momentous crises of modern
times. Benches not one-third occupied.
PREMIER and LEADER of Opposition
apparently paired: Anyhow, neither in
his place, an example liberally followed
by their colleagues.
No cheer greeted spokesman of
Opposition as he presented himself at
Lord Castlereagh's discovery.
“The Hon. Member for Showdon” addresses his constituents
from the summit on the Socialist triumphs () at the Municipal Elections.
(Mr. Philip Snowden.)
Table. Possibly sight of pile of manu-
script he laid thereon had something to
do with general depression. In this
month of November Members maturally
aweary of the Budget and all its works.
Good deal of fuss about women who
have flung stones through drawing-room
windows, or half blinded a harmless
official in the effort to destroy ballot
papers, being forcibly fed in order to
save their lives. What is that to what
we in the Commons have suffered
through full range of seasons of re-
volving year? Day after day, on second
reading of Budget Bill, in Committee,
on Report stage, have been forcibly fed
with what CARLYLE, describing Parlia-
mentary debate, called “thrice-boiled
colewort.” And here, in this merry
month of November, is the dish handed
round again as if it were as new as it is
innutritious.
Something almost fiendish in deliber-
ately setting aside three days for debate
on third reading. One hour would have
more than sufficed. In strictly business
assembly, as soon as Orders of Day were
called on, when Clerk at Table recited
the formula “Finance Bill ; third read-
ing,” CHANCELLOR OF ExCHEQUER would
have hopped up and remarked:—
“I move that the Bill be now read a
third time.”
The SPEAKER would have put the
question; Ministerialists would have
roared “Aye; ” Opposition would have
bleated “No ; ” Division forthwith taken.
All over in twenty minutes, with rest
of sitting available for work or play.
The State would not have been one
penny the worse; result of Division
would be precisely as it will stand at
close of three days—unless, indeed,
final process of recapitulation proves
equivalent to last straw, and some of our
elder and weaker brethren succumb,
reducing aggregate vote by so many
units. Among many frailties and short-
comings, no one can accuse House of
Commons of being a business assembly
in ordinary acceptance of term.
So we solemnly set apart three days to
saying over again what has been ten
times repeated during last seven months.

country.
Midway in sitting gleam of hope and
light flashed on jaded assembly. EvelyN
CECII, on his legs making loyal effort to
supplement any argument against the
Bill, any illustration of Ministerial de-
: pravity, Cousin RoRERT may by chance
have omitted from the one hundred
and seventy-nine speeches delivered by
him on successive stages. Audience,
counting in the Mace, exactly sixteen.
: A Member, yearning for seclusion and
comfort of the family circle, moved
a count. Paralysing prospect suddenly
presented. What would they say in
“What Is A MAN of STRAw?”
(The above—for Mr. Balfour's information-
is one that has proved immensely popular in
Unionist districts.)
The Nobile ART AT WesTM INSTER.
Things got almost too animated during the discussion of Mr. Ure's performances in the
England supposing, after long tirade
proclaiming importance, of Budget, de-
bate should stand adjourned because
not forty just men could be found to sit
out more talking?
Bells announcing count clanged
through corridors. Startled groups
gathered in dining-room, reading-room,
library and smoking-room. The Whips
hurried to and fro, driving in Members
as sheep are herded into the fold at
eventide. By time the sand had run
out of glass on Table there were
twice forty Members to be counted.
Having submitted to operation and saved
the State, they with one accord went
forth again, leaving CousiN EveLYN to
complete the sentence in which he was
demonstrating “how ludicrous it is to
talk of this as a poor man's Budget.”
Business dome.—Third Reading of
Finance Bill moved.
Thursday.—Always glad of opportu-
nity of extracting from Parliamentary
proceedings moral lessons useful for
guidance of the young. One just
cropped up. Everybody, young or old,
lost in admiration of PRINCE ARTHUR's
erudition. A little weak, perhaps, where
figures are concerned. Has not yet com-
pleted the sum he commenced to work
out in the spring, when Naval Estimates
were set forth, and he desired to show
how many more Dreadnoughts Germany
would have in year 1912 beyond possi-
bilities of British programme. But we
can't have everything. Numerals (includ-
ing dates) apart, his range of information
is marvellous. How does he do it?
Well—and it's here the moral lesson
comes in—by seizing every opportunity
to search for knowledge. In course of
observations on Town Planning Bill,
JoHN BURNS took objection to an amend-
ment which, he said, would enable a
landlord to let a house to a man of
straw. At the moment PRINCE ARTHUR
was sitting on Front Bench with elbows
on knees, his face buried in his hands.
Instantly he sat up alert. On his legs
as soon as J. B. had made an end of
speaking.
“What is a man of straw?” he
eagerly asked.
First impression, connected with cir-
cumstance that to-morrow is Guy Fawkes
day, was that PRESIDENT OF LOCAL GoverN-
MENT BoARD alluded to a structure
carefully compounded of inflammable
material and carried about the streets
preliminary to ignition. On reflection,
ſound that the context disposed of this
conjecture. Accordingly persisted in
enquiry, posing J. B. with reiterated
question, “What is a man of straw?”
Regret to say PRESIDENT of LoCAL
GoverNMENT BoARD showed himself un-
equal to occasion. Question remained
unanswered. PRINCE ARTHUR, once
athirst for knowledge on a particular
subject, not to be put off. Resolved, as
soon as he gets home, to look matter up
in dictionary.
Business done.—Resumed Debate on
Budget Bill.
Friday.—Third Reading of Budget
Bill carried last night by 379 votes
against 149. House adjourned till 23rd.
Business, really commences on day
before, when Lords take the Budget in
hand, possibly by the throat.

THE NEW ('HAUFFEUIR.
Employer. And now as to wages.
What do you want?
Chauffeur. Forty pounds a year and
all found.
E. And what do you expect to do for
that ? -
C. To keep the car in good order and
drive you out in it.
E. Yes. You must excuse me asking
so much, but you see I don't know you
at all. What kind of a temper have
you? -
C. Very good.
E. Yes, of course. But I mean what
kind of temper have you when you are
told suddenly, late on a wet night, to go
to the station?
C. Very good.
E. Alwavs 2
C. Certainly.
E. Well, I want you to be quite sure.
Is your temper so perfect that, if I were
to offer you andther £5 a year to secure
this point about unexpected runs in bad
weather and so forth, it woull make no
difference?
C. I think it might make a difference.
E. And you would stand by the
bargain? Never for a moment go back
on it?
C. No.
12. Then we will say £45. And one
other point. There are some chauffeurs
who are willing to go on an open road
with no danger at only, say, twelve
miles an hour. You are not like that,
are you?
C. Certainly not.
I. You are not willing to go slow 2
C. No. -
E. All then, that settles it, for a
chauffeur who objects to go slow is no
| good to me. You see, I often want to
go slow.
C. Yes; but, of course, if you wished
it——
E. You said you were not willing.
Now, an unwilling servant is the last
thing I require.
('. But——
E. You mean that you could become
willing to meet my wishes 2
C. Yes.
E. But willingness must be more
spontaneous than that. Suppose we were
to fix it up now absolutely, would you
continue in that frame 2 You would
always be willing?
('. Always.
12. Then shall we say another £5
a year? That makes £50.
('. Thank you very much.
I. Oh, no, not at all. It's a com-
mercial transaction. .I want what you
are prepared to sell. There is one other
point. What kind of an expression do
you wear when you are told by your
employer to take out for a drive certain

of his poorer friends who cannot afford
more than a small tip, if any?
C. I am perfectly content.
E. Perfectly?
C. Well, of course, one prefers to
drive one's own employer.
E. Ah!—but supposing I wished all
your passengers to be of equal import-
ance and interest to you? There is no
pleasure in a drive if the driver is sullen.
Have you ever thought of that?
C. Never. .
E. You see it now?
C. Yes, I see it now.
E. And if I were to add another £5 it
would guarantee the smile?
C. Absolutely. -
E. Very well, then, that makes it £55.
We will leave it at that. You will begin
on Monday. -
The Art of Entrenching.
“Some of his remarks were cheered by the
quondam cave-dwellers . . . entrenched in pro-
minent corner seats.”—P. W. W. in “The Daily
Neurs."
The Transmigration of Souls.
An advertiser in The Times who men-
tions that he is a gardener (and adds,
“head working”—always a good thing
in any man) calls attention to his—
“Life experience; eight years previous."
In his next existence he must really try
another profession. Otherwise he will
be looked upon as a man of one idea
only.
From a report of the Saturday Club,
Calcutta:-
“The Chairman announced that the Com-
:mittee had had under their careful consideration
the question of limiting the membership, this
matter having been brought up by a member.
After examining the figures of members resdent
in, and absent from, Calcutta during 1908 and
in view of the enlargement of the Ball room,
the Committee did not think it necessary at
present to recommend any action in this direc-
tion.”
Probably the member who brought the
matter up was misled by the figures of
one or two habitués.

DEAR SADIE,--I got your letter alright

again. It was real good of you to send
along The Bangpille Clarion, and we
all dug into it for a spell. It seems
queer, somehow, over here, to read about
hold-ups and lynching-bees, and all that,

much use for a man that talks about
breaking up a Marquis!
Cy has been having trouble with a
hotel man somewhere in the country.
It was this way. Cy had heard that
there was a room in this man's hotel
that a king slept in a few centuries ago,
so down he went to stay there himself.
Well, when Cy pulled up at the hotel—
it was an old-time place with a court-
yard, and matchboarding round the
rooms—he was too late to get the room
to see a football match. Well, this man
appears to have all his Saturday after- ||

We got back to London again and
to the meeting at last, and there
was a big palaver, but I don't quite
hitch on to the politics over here just
yet. Cy says things here are about the
same as they are in the States, only
simpler, because they haven't got nigger
trouble and dry States to worry with.
Anyway, the head push who did the

wasn't only the disappointment, but being
made a Willie of, that upset him.

is the latest collection; how calmly and sedately I close
the book--not a collar-stud burst, not a button gone.
And then I remember my limp and helpless state after
reading The Skipper's Wooing. Well, perhaps it is I who
am getting old; or is it that I have read too much JAcobs?
Every humorist has his own formula for being funny, and
one who works within such narrow limits as Mr. JACOBs is
bound to give his method away; with the result that his
admirers (subconsciously, perhaps) feel at last some slight
resentment against him. Now an atmosphere of that kind
is fatal to a humorist; the humorist must have his readers
entirely with him from the start, they must follow him
without question. All the time that I was reading
Sailors' Knots I was saying to myself, “Same old plot, which
recoils on the plotter; same old night-watchman, and the
same old jokes about his face.” Well, that simply didn't
give Mr. JACOBs a chance. I expect, really, he was as funny
as ever. In any case I must recommend the book if only
for one excellent ghost story which it contains.
One miracle to a novel is a fair allowance, and Mr. STEPHEN
REYNOLDs, while allowing his Alexander Trotman to move
Ramshorn Hill by an act of faith from Trowbury, Wilts, to
Acton, W., had clearly given him private instructions that
this must not become a habit. The conduct of all his
characters, after and with reference to that one supernatural
event, is entirely ordinary and intensely human. The Holy
Mountain (LANE), as a comedy of small minds concerned
in big mºvements, deserves nothing but praise; as a soi-
disant satire on tendencies it is open to objection. In the
apathy of his Trowburians, the wild but short-lived en-
thusiasms of his London crowds, and the ready adaptation
of the miracle to commercial ends by his newspaper king,
the author shows a nice perception of the self-conceit of the
marrow-minded and the ready intelligence of the self-seek-
ing. But when hereduces all the greatissues of life, including
religion, to mere farce, he displays an observation too super-
ficial and a spirit too frivolous. If it is the satirist's privilege
to ridicule, it is his duty to do so with understanding. ||
“There is many a true word spoken in jest,” he reminds you
on his title-page; but himself forgets that farce covers a
multitude of misconceptions.
abandon your optimism on its account, you cannot do better
than read the book for a clever story well told, and for an
endlessly amusing caricature of the petty side of life.
Messrs. GEORGE BELL AND SONS have done a bold thing in
issuing the libretti of four of the Savoy Operas. How it

move and mime bravely; yet he is never quite sympathetic
with the matter of his author. Not only does he make a
mistake in shirking the most whimsical situations, but there
is too little whimsicality in his execution; and whimsicality
should be be-all and end-all in illustrating work that is com-
pact of that quality. Another mistake Mr. FLINT makes, I
think, in deliberately ignoring the optique du théâtre; for,
however it may be with Willi AM SHAKspEARE, Sir WILLIAM
GILBERT is emphatically for the stage rather than the study.
Still, I want not to belittle Mr. FLINT's achievement, for,
granting him his point of view, he has produced a most
admirable set of designs, especially those dealing with Thc
Pirates of Penzance. With Patience he is least successful,
but for that he must blame his youth. One needs to have
lived through the time of those fantastic précieur of the
early eighties to be able to give just expression to Gilbert's
satire; and Mr. FLINT must have been in short frocks—if,
indeed, he were on the planet at all—when Maudle and
Postlethwaite first made their wail heard in the land. It
should be added that Sir WILLIAM GilBERT himself kindly
comes before the cur-
tain as Prologue, and
introduces his operas in
a few sentences of plea-

The story (from The Bodley Head)
Is told with insight, and discreetly;
It's readable, but, as I've said,
The moral baffles me completely.
After reading Miss EVELYN UNDERHILL's latest supernatural
novel, The Column of Dust (METHUEN), I am inclined to quote
the famous criticism upon Jaberwocky –“It fills me with
ideas, only I don't know what they are.” Nor am I wholly
free from the suspicion that the author herself was in no
better case. When, in
the earlier chapters,
Constance Tyrell makes
charcoal rings upon the
floor and sets herself to
catch ghosts according
to a printed formula
for that process, I was
mildly entertained. But
when it appeared that
an unborn spirit (called
here The Watcher) had
actually been trapped
by these means, and,
entering the soul of the
heroine, become part of
her being—I ceased to
smile. Frankly speak-
ing, such a conception
is altogether too big for
its present setting. One
can fancy it the motive
of a tremendous study
of human life and its
problems, but Miss
- UNDERHILL takes her
Watcher to a Kensington tea-fight and a musical comedy.
And even here I am in doubt whether she intends the effect
to be serious or farcical. There are other incidents in the
book—the scenes in the mountain chapel, for example, and
the death of Constance—where this impression of insincerity
becomes even more distasteful. In fine, Miss UNDERHILL,
having proved that she can write engagingly enough about
ordinary life (the Vince household is quite delightful), will
not, I hope, mind my advising her to leave the mysteries
respectfully alone. There are limits.
MIKE?”
For the occasion of the distribution of prizes at the Dar-
lington Technical College (we read in The North Star):-
“The committee decided that a quantity of nun's veiling should be
obtained for the purpose of draping a number of the statues in the
College.”
Life is full of these little difficulties, especially for nuns.
From an advertisement in The Church Times : —
“Church 3, Station 3}, and Bath 12 miles.”
This is cleanliness at a good distance from godliness.

[November 17, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW LIBERALISM.
[The Daily Neurs, in passing severe comments upon the retirement of
that stout buttress of Nonconformity, Sir Robert PERKs, permits itself to
make the following observation:-"The truth is that antagonism to the
Church is not a sufficient basis for Liberalism in these days."]
Ah, for the easy days of old
When there was no tough test to pass
Before you got your name enrolled
Among the Liberal fighting class;
One question served—'twas all you got :-
“Are you agin the Church, my hearty 2"
You said, “I am!” and on the spot
Became a pillar of the Party.
No candidate was ever ploughed
(The Limehouse test was still unknown)
Because he wouldn't curse aloud
All social castes above his own.
They didn't say, as now they do,
“Your claims we cannot yet determine
Without a guarantee that you
Regard our Dukes as simple vermin.”
Yes, those were easier days, for then
You might preserve a Liberal mind
And yet believe that honest men
Occur among the landlord kind;
You might, without undue alarm,
Be seen in converse with a brewer,
Or take a plural voter's arm
As though his soul was not a sewer.
It was enough in that fair age,
When PERKs's rose was still in bud,
If Liberals spent their pious rage
In shouting for the Church's blood;
But now in younger, hardier breasts
New forms of hate must have their places,
Or else the whole caboodle rests
Upon an “insufficient basis.”
O. S.
THE RE'S MANY A SLI P.
No prudent Commoner forgets,
When Lords are all the rage :—
“Kind hearts are more than coronets,
Nor iron bars a cage.”
Change the metre when you're pressed;
Ask for what you cannot reach ;
This is more than all the rest:—
NEVER PRActise what You PREAch.
THE point of the above quotation (selected at random from
a praiseworthy poem of my own, entitled Alone I Did It) is
in the last line. The remainder may be safely neglected.
The moral of it is this. If ever you descend to writing articles
upon the ease of travelling first-class with a third-class ticket,
and illustrate your theory with a purely imaginary instance,
let the matter rest there. Take what money you can get for
your article, but try to forget your beautiful theory as soon
as possible. Above all, do not do as I did.
The train intended to run from Paddington to Birming-
ham without a stop, and for all I know it did so. I intended
to go by that train to Birmingham, but, if the third-class
carriages became too full to hold anybody else, I meant to
be that somebody else. So I sat in the rear of the platform
on an empty milk-can (that was part of the theory) and
let the other passengers arrange themselves, facing the engine
or not as they preferred.
When it was getting somewhere near starting time, I
walked along the train to have a look at its fulness; and
never in my life have I seen so many vacant places in third-
class compartments. Possibly you would have boldly taken
your seat in a first-class carriage and chanced it, but I
happened to know that it was a corridor train, that an in-
spector examined the tickets en route, and that all the room
under the seats was occupied by the warming apparatus.
When I rather think of doing something, especially if
there is an element of wickedness about it, and upon inves-
tigation find it to be impossible, I at once become determined
to do it at all costs. So I had another look at the train and
found that the last coach was not connected by a corridor
to the rest of the train and that every third-class seat in that
particular coach was full. “Providence,” I said to myself,
“is engaged on this job,” and I started to enter the one
first-class compartment in the coach. But I did not get
further than the start, because I saw a man in uniform
hovering. On these occasions I hate talking to men in
uniform. Instead, I walked sharply out of the station for a
hundred yards or so, and waited there until there was only a
minute left before my time of departure. Then I sprinted
sharply for the first-class compartment of the last coach
a galll. .
sº is astonishing how many railway officials one can
interview in how short a time. I imagine that I had about
seven conversations before that train started to move.
The whole staff of one of England's greatest railways seemed
bent on nothing else but getting me out of my carriage.
They asked to see my ticket, but I was too exhausted by my
rush to catch my train to hear what they said. They
wanted to know where I was going and (so it seemed to me
from their gesticulations) why I was going there, what I was
going to do when I got there and when they might expect
me back. None of these questions seemed to me to be
worth answering. Besides, there was probably some catch
in them.
I only got rid of my interviewers when the train started,
and even then one of them stood on the step, so anxious
was he to finish what he had got to say.
“Where are you going, Sir?” he asked.
“What?” I said. After all I had to say something.
“Where are you going, Sir?” he repeated.
“Where are you coming to?” was my natural retort.
“I’ll tell you all about myself, if you'll tell me all about
yourself. Will you start first?”
- Before he could answer that he had to leave me. We
were very nearly clear of the station altogether, and, had he
put off the bitter parting any longer, he would have had
to wait until the next station for some more platform
to jump on. Rather than appear rude, I leant out of
the window to wave a farewell to him. “I forgive you,” I
shouted. “Take it from me that I am going to Birmingham.”
+ + + +
I alighted from my coach at Reading, because the coach
was a slip coach and Reading was the place where it slipped.
During the course of interviews with another score or so of
officials, I made two important announcements. The first
(which was inaccurate) was that I was about to report for
misconduct the guard, the ticket-inspectors, the engine-
driver, the stoker, all the officials at Paddington, all the
officials at Reading and all the signalmen on the inter-
vening system; the second (which was entirely true) that
Reading seemed to me the most loathsome spot I had ever
had the misfortune to visit.
“Lieutenant Shackelton's knighthood was inevitable, nevertheless it
will be heartily approved.”—Northern Whig.
This sounds generous; but, after all, the public gets quite a
fair proportion of surprises.

SOCIETIES WE ADMIRE (BUT DO NOT BELONG TO).-No. 2.
The Association FOR THE REvival of CLASSICAL DANCING.
PLEA FOR A “WORKING MAN."
When E'ER my morning sheet I scan
I learn that now the “Working Man,”
Proceeding on a novel plan
Of Give and Take,
For the first time since Work began
Is on the make.
His broad ideal seems to be
Getting his needs — and comforts —
free;
And as it's natural that he
Shan’t pay the bill,
The victim with the L. S. D.,
Put bluntly, will.
A game in which you're bound to win
Has charm for those that toil and spin,
Tho' to the man that has the tin
It may seem hard;
But whereabouts do I come in 2
I am a bard.
I grant you that my trade is low,
And wanting in the outer show
Of decent Toil, so let that go:
What I impress
Is, Dignity of Labour, No;
But Labour, Yes.
The proud exclusive Sons of Toil,
What reck they of the midnight oil,
Of barren labours that recoil
After they're done,
Of Editors who make one boil
To give them one *
They do their simple task per day—
The minimum—and pass away
To smoke, to drink, perchance to play,
Just as they like;
Men whom the poet's rate of pay
Would send on strike.
Why, when in envious moods I think
Of all they have to spend on drink,
While, for the bard, the household sink
Fulfils his need,
It is enough to freeze one's ink;
It is, indeed.
What tho' the hand the Muse employs
Is no more horny than a boy's 2
What tho' I wear no corduroys
On my two stumps?
(I tried to, but their creaky noise
Gave me the jumps.)
But what of that? I ask you, what?
I say, let class distinctions rot!
And if there's boodle to be got
By Working Men,
Am I a “Working” Man or not?
Very well, then.
By barren toil and meagre screw,
O Workers, I am one with you;
And, if there's anyone to do,
By all means do ’t ;
Only I mean to be there too
And share the loot. DUM-DUM.
Lessons from Life.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-If our weekly “illus-
trated” papers have long ago sacri-
ficed art to photography, no one can
complain that they have grown either
less instructive or less in touch with
the times. Week by week they teach
us more and more about the actualities
of the hour. Take the current number
of The Graphic. As I write (Nov. 11)
there lies before me a very beautiful
study—a photograph, I need hardly say
—of a pastoral valley in late autumn.
In the old days this might have ap-
peared at any time of the year, and they
would have simply called it “Autumn”
or “Late Autumn,” and left it at that.
But to-day we are informed in a foot-
note: “This picture represents a scene
now being enacted all over the country,
reminding one that winter is not far off.”
Don't you think, dear Mr. Punch, that
this kind of thing is very, very good for
us? Yours ever,
A Child IN THESE MATTERs.

THE LETTER N.
A TRAGEDY IN High LIFE.
1.
From the copy paper of Harold Pippett,
only reporter for “The Easterham
Herald.”
INQUIRIEs which have been made by
one of our representatives yield the
gratifying tidings that Kildin Hall, the
superb Tudor residence vacated a year
or so ago by Lord Glossthorpe, is again
let. The new tenant, who will be a
valued addition to the neighbourhood,
is Mr. Michael Stirring, a retired banker.

Inquiries which have been made by
one of our representatives yield the
gratifying tidings that Kildin Hall, the
superb Tudor residence vacated a year
or so ago by Lord Glossthorpe, is again
let. The new tenant, who will be a
valued addition to the neighbourhood,
is Mr. Michael Stirring, a retired baker.
III.
Mr. Guy Lander, Estate Agent, to the
Editor of “The Easterham Herald.”
DEAR TED,--There's a fearful bloomer
in your paper this week which you must
put right as soon as you can. Mr.
Stirring, who has taken Kildin, is not
a baker, but a banker. Yours, G. L.
- IV.
The Editor of “The Easterham IIerall ”
to Mr. Guy Lander.
MY DEAR GUY,-Of course it's only a
misprint. Pippett wrote “banker” right
enough, and the ass of a compositor
dropped out the “n.” I’ll put it right
next week. No sensible person would
mind. Yours, EDWARD Robb.
W.
Mrs. Michael Stirring to the Editor of
“The Easterham Herald.”
SIR,-My attention has been called to
a very serious misstatement in your
paper for Saturday last. It is there
stated that my husband, Mr. Michael
Stirring, who has taken Kildin Hall,
is a retired baker. This is absolutely
false. Mr. Stirring is a retired banker,
than which nothing could be much
more diſferent. Mr. Stirring is at this
moment too ill to read the papers, and the
libel will therefore be kept from him a
little longer, but what the consequences
will be when he learns it I tremble to
think. Kindly assure me that you will
give the denial as much publicity as the
falsehood. Yours faithfully,
AUGUSTA STIRRING.
WI.
The Editor of “The Easterham Herald”
to Mrs. Michael Stirring.
The Editor of The Easterlºam. Herald
presents his compliments to Mrs. Stirring
and begs to express his profound regret
that the misprint of which she complains
should have crept into his paper. That
it was a misprint and not an intentional
misstatement he has the reporter's copy
to prove. He will, of course, insert in
the next issue of The Easterham Herald
a paragraph correcting the error, but
he would point out to Mrs. Stirring that
it was stated in the paragraph that
Mr. Stirring would be a valued addition
to the neighbourhood.
Wii.
Mrs. Stirring to the Editor of “The
Easterham Herald.”
SIR, - Whatever the cause of the
slander, whether malice or misadventure,
the fact remains that you have done a
very cruel thing. I enclose a cutting
from the London Press, sent me by a
friend, which will show you that the
calumny is becoming widely spread.
Mr. Stirring is so weak and dispirited
that we fear he may have got some
inkling of it. Your position if he knows
the worst will be terrible.
I am, Yours faithfully,
AUGUSTA StirriNo.
viii. (THE ENCLOSURE.)
From “The Morning Star.”
SiGNS of THE TIMEs.
We get the new movement in a nut-
shell in the report from Easterham
that Lord Glossthorpe has let his house
to a retired baker named Stirring, etc.,
etc.
IX.
From “The Easterham Herald,” Sept. 9.
ERRATUM.–In our issue last week an
unfortunate misprint made us state that
the new tenant of Kildin Hall was a
retired baker. The word was of course
banker.
X.
Messrs. Greenery and Bills, Steam
Bakery, Dumbridge.
DEAR SIR,-After the offensive way in
which you refer to bakers in the current
number of your paper we feel that we
have no other course but to withdraw
our advertisement; so please discon-
tinue it from this date.
Yours faithfully,
GREENERY AND BILLs.
XI.
Mr. John Bridger, Baker, to the Editor of
“The Easterham IIerald.”
DEAR Robb, -I was both pained and
surprised to find a man of your prin-
ciples and a friend of mine writing of
bakers as you did this week. Why
should you “of course” have meant a
banker? Why cannot a retired baker
take a fine house if he wants to ? I am
thoroughly ashamed of you, and wish to
withdraw my advertisement from your
paper. Yours truly, John BRIDGER.
XII.
Mrs. Stirring to the Editor of “The
Easterham Herald.”
SIR,--I fear you have not done your
best to check the progress of your
slanderous paragraph, since only this
morning I received the enclosed. You
will probably not be surprised to learn
that through your efforts the old-world
paradise of Kildin, in which we hoped
to end our days, has been closed to us.
Yours truly, AUGUSTA STIRRING.
xiii. (THE ENCLOSURE.)
From “The Daily Leader.”
The TRIUMPH of THE DEMocracy.
After lying empty for nearly two years
Lord Glossthorpe's country seat has been
let to a retired baker named Stirring,
etc., etc.
XIV.
Mrs. Michael Stirring to Mr. Guy Lander.
DEAR SIR,-After the way that the
good name and fame of my husband and
myself have been poisoned both in the
local and the London Press, we cannot
think further of coming to live at Kildin
Hall. Every post brings from one or
other of my friends some paragraph
perpetuating the lie. Kindly therefore
consider the negotiations completely at
an end. I am, Yours faithfully,
AUGUSTA STIRRING.
- - xW.
The Editor of “The Easterham Herald "
to Mr. John Bridger.
DEAR BRIDGER,-You were too hasty.
A man has to do the best he can. When
I wrote “of course " I meant it as a
stroke of irony. You will be glad to
hear that in consequence of the whole
thing I have got notice to leave, my
proprietor being under obligations to
Lord Glossthorpe, and you may therefore
restore your patronage to The Herald
with a pure conscience.
Yours sincerely, EDWARD Robb.
XVI.
The Editor of “The Easterham Herald"
to Mrs. Stirring.
The Editor of The Easterham Herald
presents his compliments to Mrs. Stirring
for the last time, and again assures
her that the whole trouble grew from
the natural carelessness of an over-
worked and underpaid compositor. He
regrets sincerely the unhappiness which
that mistake has caused, and looks for-
ward to a day when retired bakers and
retired bankers will be considered as
equally valuable additions to a neigh- ||
bourhood. In retirement, as in the
grave, he likes to think of all men as
equal. With renewed apologies for the
foul aspersion which he cast upon Mr.
and Mrs. Stirring, he begs to conclude.

WILLIAM SMITH, EDITOR.
[The exciting revelations at the St. James'
Theatre as to the inner life of the successful
dramatist, with its interludes of plot and in-
trigue, may (we feel) cause the public to look
down upon an editorial career as in comparison
tame and insipid. We have endeavoured to
show here that, on the contrary, Romance may
invade the Editorial sanctum at any moment.}
Act I.
The Editor's Room in the Office of “The
Lark.” Two walls of the room are
completely hidden from floor to ceil-
ing by magnificently bound books :
the third wall at the back is hidden
by boxes of immensely expensive
cigars. The windows, of course, are
in the fourth wall, which, however,
need not be described, as it is merer
quite practicable on the stage. The
floor of this apartment is chastely
corered with rugs shot by the Editor
in his trarels, or in the Tottenham
Court Road; and in some cases,
presented by admiring readers from
abroad. The furniture is both ele-
gant and commodious.
William Smith, Editor, comes in. He
is superbly dressed in a fur coat
and an expensive cigar. There is
a blue pencil behind his ear, and a
sheaf of what we call in the profes-
sion “type-written manuscripts"
under his arm. He sits down at
his desk and pulls the telephone
towards him. -
Smith (at the telephone). Hallo, is that
Yes, it's me. Just
come up a moment. (Puts down tele-
phone and begins to open his letters.)
|Enter Jones, his favourite sub-cditor.
He is dressed quite commonly, and
is covered with ink. He salutes
respectfully as he comes into the
room.]
Jones. Good aſternoon, chief.
Smith. Good aſternoon. Have a cigar?
Jones. Thank you, chief.
Smith. Have you anything to tell me?
Jones. The circulation is still going up,
chief. It was three million and eight
last week.
Smith (testily). How often have I told
you not to call me “chief,” except when
there are ladies present? Why can't
you do what you're told 2
Jones. Sorry, sir, but the fact is there
are ladies present.
Smith (ſingering his moustache). Show
them up. Who are they 2
Jones. There is only one. She says
she's the lady who has been writing our
anonymous “Secrets of the Boudoir "
series which has made such a sensation.
Smith (in amazement). I thought you
told me you wrote those.
Jones (simply). I did.
Smith. Then why—
Jones. I mean, I did tell you. The
truth is they came in anonymously, and
I thought they were more likely to be
accepted if I said I had written them.
(With great emotion) Forgive me, chief,
but it was for the paper's sake. (In
matter-of-fact tones) There were one or
two peculiarities of style I had to alter.
She had a way of
Smith (sternly). How many cheques
for them have you accepted for the
paper's sake? - *
Jones. Eight. For a thousand pounds
each.
Smith (with tears in his eyes). If your
mother were to hear of this
Jones (sadly). Ah, chief, I have never
had a mother.
Smith (slightly put out, but recover-
ing himself quickly). What would your
father say, if——
Jones. Alas, I have no relations. I
was a foundling.
Smith (nettled). In that case I shall
certainly tell the master of the work-
house. To think that there should be a
thief in this office
Jones (with great pathos). Chief, chief,
I am not so vile as that. I have care-
fully kept all the cheques in an old
stocking, and—
Smith (in surprise). Do you wear
stockings?
Jones. When I bicycle. And as soon
as the contributor comes forward—
Smith (stretching out his hand and
grasping that of Jones). My dear boy,
forgive me. You have been hasty, per-
haps, but zealous. In any case, your
honesty is above suspicion. Leave me
now. I have much to think of. (Rests
his head on his hands. Then, dreamily)
You have never seen your father; for
thirty years I have not seen my wife
. . . Ah, Arabella!

again.
Jones (e.ecitedly). Did you say she
split her infinitives?
Smith. Yes. That was what led to
our separation. Why?
Jones. Nothing, only—it's very odd.
I wonder—-
[Enter Boy.]
Boy. Did you ring, Sir?
Smith. No. (To Jones) Did you?
Jones. Yes; you told me to. (Smith
shakes his head.) Well, anyhow, Sir,
what about the lady ?
Smith. The lady ? Ah, yes. (To Boy)
Show her up, please. (E.cit Boy.) You'd
better clear out, Jones. I'll explain to
her about the money.
Jones. Right you are, Sir. [E.cit.
|Smith leans back in his chair and stares
in front of him.]
Smith (to himself). Arabella!
[Enter Boy, followed by a stylishly
dressed lady of middle age.]
Boy. Mrs. Robinson. [E.cit.

seated on the sofa.
Arabella. I had begun to almost de-
spair. (Smith winces.) “Almost to
despair,” I mean, darling.
Smith (with a great effort). No, no
dear. You were right.
Arabella. How sweet of you to think
so, William.
Smith. Yes, yes, it's the least I can
say . . . And now, dear, what shall
we do? Shall we get married again
quietly 2
Arabella. Wouldn't that be bigamy 2
Smith. I think not, but I will ask the
printer's reader. He knows everything.
You see, there will be such a lot to
explain, otherwise.
Arabella. Dear, can you afford to
marry P
Smith. Well, my salary as editor is
only twenty thousand a year, but I do a
little reviewing for other papers. .
Arabella. And I have — nothing.
How can I come to you without even a
trousseau ?
Smith. Yes, that's true . . . (Sud-
denly) By Jove, though, you have got
something! You have eight thousand
pounds ! We owe you that for your
articles. (With a return to his pro-
fessional manner) Did I tell you how
greatly we all appreciated them? Ex-
cuse me a moment, love. (Goes to
telephone.) Is that you, Jones? Just
come here a moment. (To Arabella)
Jones is my sub-editor; he is keeping
your money for you.
[Enter Jones.]
Jones (producing an old stocking).
I've just been round to my rooms to
get that money—(sees Arabella)—oh, I
beg your pardon.
Smith (waving an introduction). Mrs.
Smith – my wife. This is our sub-
editor, dear—Mr. Jones. (Arabella puts
her hand to her heart and seems about to
faint). Why, what's the matter?
Arabella (hoarsely). Where did you
get that stocking?
Smith (pleasantly). It's one he wears
when he goes bicycling.
Jones. No ; I misled you this after-
noon, chief. This stocking was all the
luggage I had when I first entered the
Leamington workhouse.

Smith (shaking hands with Jones).
How are you? I say, Arabella, then
that was one of my stockings?
Arabella (to her boy). When I saw you
on the stairs you seemed to dimly re-
mind me—
Jones. To remind you dimly, mother.
Smith. No, my boy. In future, nothing
but split infinitives will appear in our
paper. Please remember that.
Jones (with emotion). I will endeavour
to always remember it, dad.

[The sighting of a sea-serpent has recently

AUGUST wept above our beaches,
Drew to its predestined term;
Still within secluded reaches
Lay the oceanic worm;
Never fluttered pinnace flying
Told of how his flank for miles
Coil on archéd coil was lying
Somewhere off the Scilly Isles.
Came September; flew the swallow ;
Autumn lanes were lined with mud;
Sere October saw us wallow
Waist-deep in an ark-less flood;
Still no daring news exploiter
Wakened from its ooze-girt zone
Amphitrite's portent: REUTER
Simply left the thing alone.
Shall we now (when dark November
Also brings its share of rain)
Thrill through every awe-struck
member
At the serpent of the main?
Shall we now, when parties writhe on
Rocks about the Budget's fate,
Care for something like a python
Spotted by the second mate?
No, if stout papas at Brighton,
Listening to the breakers' scrunch,
Needed not that scare to lighten
Lethargy succeeding lunch;
Polls, I think, to-day before us,
Peers a-tremble for their doom,
Rob the laggard Dinosaurus
Of his too late-flowering bloom.
Pressmen leave him wandering vainly
Where upon the fog-bound blue
Captain Binks perceived him plainly

Fancies, when we hourly shake
Under sheer delirium tremens
Fighting with the Fiscal snake?

THE DEATH OF EUCLID.
[“Euclid, we are told, is at last dead, after two thousand years of an
immortality that he never much deserved.”—“The Times' " Literary
Supplement.} ---
A THRENody for EUCLID !. This is he
Who with his learning made our youth a waste,
Holding our souls in fee;
A god whose high-set crystal throne was based
Beyond the reach of tears,
Deeper than time and his relentless years!
Come then, ye Angle-Nymphs, and make lament;
Ye little Postulates, and all the throng
Of Definitions, with your heads besprent
In funeral ashes, ye who long
Worshipped the King and followed in his train;
For he is dead and cannot rise again.
Then from the shapes that beat their breasts and wept,
Soft to the light a gentle Problem stepped,
And, lo, her clinging robe she swiftly loosed
And with majestic hands her side produced :
“Sweet Theorem,” she said, and called her mate,
“Sweet Theorem, be with me at this hour.
IIow oft together in a dear debate
We two bore witness to our Sovereign's power.
But he is dead and henceforth all our days
Are wrapped in gloom,
And we who never ceased to sing his praise
May weep our lord, but cannot call him from his tomb."
And, as they bowed their heads and to and fro
Wove in a mournful gait their web of woe,
Two sentinels forth came,
Their hearts aflame,
And moved behind the pair:
“Warders we are,” they cried,
“Of these two sisters who were once so fair,
- So joyous in their pride.”
And now their massy shields they liſted high,
Embossed with letters three,
And, though a mist of tears bedimmed each eye,
The sorrowing Nymphs could see
Q., E. and F. on one, and on the other Q. E. D.
But on a sudden, with a hideous noise
Of joy and laughter rushed a rout of boys;
And all the mourners in affright
Scattered to left and right.
Problems and Theorems and Angles too,
Postulates, Definitions, Circles, Planes,
A jibbering crew,
With all their hoary gains
Of knowledge, from their monarch dead
Into the outer darkness shrieking fled.
And now with festal dance and laughter loud
Broke in the boyish and intruding crowd;
Nor did they fail,
Seeing that all the painful throng was sped,
To let high mirth prevail,
And raise the song of joy for EUCLID dead.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, November 8th.
—House meets to-day with conscious.
mess that it is poorer by the cutting off
of one of its most modest and most dis-
tinguished members. Lord SELBy did
not take prominent part in its proceed-
ings. When he first entered it, stepping
from the exalted position of the Speaker's
Chair in the Commons, he characteris-
tically took a back seat, whence he
seldom rose to join in debate. He pre-
ferred the less obtrusive part of one
who gives “sage counsel in cumber.”
His views on current affairs were
sought with avidity by both sides.
When, at the instance of the present
Opposition, a Committee was appointed
to consider the possibility of reforming
procedure in the Lords, Ministers and
their few followers stood aside. Intent
upon drastic reconstruction, they de-
clined to dally with what promised to
be a mere plastering-up of the ancient
edifice. The LEADER of THE OPPosition
approached Lord SELBY with invitation
to “come over and help us.” Though
essentially mot a Party man, he was loyal
to his Party chief. He privily consulted
him on the question, and on receiving
cordial consent to follow personal inclina-
tion in the matter he joined the Com-
mittee and gave valuable aid to its
deliberations.
To the universal regreton his final with-
drawal from an arena which he endowed
with dignity is added the reflection that
the event happens on the eve of a crisis
in the history of the House of Lords
where his sound judgment, long ex-
perience, lofty moral and mental atti-
tude, would have been of price above
rubies.
It is an oft-told story how, nominated
to the Speaker's Chair on the retirement
of Mr. PEEL, Mr. GULLY was not known
even by sight to one-third of the
assembly. As Member for Carlisle, as
in other relations of daily life, he never
thrust himself to the front. Unexpect-
edly called to the Chair, he filled it
with a courteousness that graced without
weakening his unfailing vindication of
its high authority. His appointment on
the nomination of the meagre Liberal
majority under the leadership of Sir
WILLIAM HARCOURT was resisted by the
Opposition. The honour was won for
him by the narrow majority of eleven.
This happened in April 1895. In
August of the same year, the Unionists,
returning with a majority that made
them masters of the situation, and placed
at their disposal the prizes that are
the heritage of the victor, re-elected
him by acclamation.
Thereafter, through ten eventful years
he held the post, yearly growing in the
IIouse of Lords Footman. — “Per'aps I hought to tell you, m'lord, as those persons from
Mr. Hasquidge's hopposite are hall in the front of the 'Ouse again, a-throwin' down gloves,

tastes, sweet nature, high culture, and
supreme capacity, he added appre-
ciably to the splendid traditions of the
Speaker's Chair.

The beacon light is quenched in smoke,
The trumpet's silvery sound is still,
The warder silent on the hill.

From an advertisement:
“A gentleman writes: “After

reported to have had a strange vision
the other day during a hard-earned nap
between the Acts of Trilby. The re-
nowned histrion dreamed that Mr.
GEORGE ALEXANDER had abandoned the
Stage for Parliament, that Mr. MARTIN
HARVEY had become a Bishop, Mr. CYRIL
MAUDE an Admiral, and Mr. H. B. IRVING
a Judge.
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExCHEQUER,
like Sir HERBERT BEERBOHM TREE, is a
great dreamer. It is reported by a writer
in The Rational Review that Mr. Lioyd
GEORGE recently had a remarkable dream,
in which Mr. Asquith resigned the Pre-
miership and Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL
was appointed Viceroy of India. On
his communicating the dream to Mr.
Asq"ITH, the Premier remarked, with a
merry twinkle, “My dear DAVID, I am
delighted to hear it; you know that
dre ims always go by contraries.”
By a strange coincidence on the same
litterati, bookworms, and connoisseurs.
To meet this long felt want, we are happy
to announce that the aforementioned
publishing house intends to compile
and issue (once every blue moon) an
improved and expanded edition of the
gems of literature for the express benefit
of students and millionaires. Remember
that
“THE WoRLD's Books BETTERED ''
IS NOT A MERE REPUBLICATION.
It is a painting of the lilies of literature,
a gilding of the golden coin of fancy, an
enhancement of the noblest and greatest
works of the greatest writers that have
ever wrought.
How often have you not laid down
some massive volume with a sigh, and
said, “I wish there were more of it."
Well, that is just what there is going to
be. Try to imagine your Homer in duo-
decameters, an Inferno of twice its

It is only right to give these remedies
a fair trial before rushing into print
about them.

excursions into matrimonial arithmetic.

of which is of a most complicated cha-

simultaneously six husbands in six
different States. Four of them had
been married twice before, and the re-
maining two were monogams.
Another redoubtable novelist, Mrs.

pleted a charming tale called Mamie's
Relations. Mamie is a little girl of
seven whose mother has been divorced
seven, and her father eight times. With
that splendid tolerance which is such a
fine feature of the smartest American
society, Mamie's parents are in the habit
of sending her on a round of visits to
their previous partners. The confusion
caused in the mind of the little visitor

A charming book of reminiscences

the clou of this delightful entertainment
is the chapter in which she relates how,

played with the most brilliant success
her fifth husband's fourth pianoforte

That distinguished peer-elect, Admiral
Sir John FishBR, O.M., G.C.B., is so
deeply delighted, as he well may be,

to write a short biography of that illus-
trious publicist under the attractive
title of “The Whitest Man I Know.”
Mr. ARNOLD WHITE, it will be remembered,
used of Sir John Fisher the memorable
phrase: “He gives the impression of
being elemental man in the midst of

tion we understand that Messrs. Tussaud

“Welsh again found the Londoner's

this report was printed by oversight,
and that our contemporary had quite
intended to publish something like the
following:—“We are informed by a
press agency, which shall be nameless,
that another of the brutal displays, for
which the National Sporting Club is
notorious, took place last night. The
contestants were two fine, strapping
young fellows, Frederick Welsh, of
Pontypridd, and John Summers, of
Canning Town; and we cannot but
think that their glowing health and
splendidly- developed physique might
have been put to some better purpose.
It is not our intention to report this
event in any detail; we place on record
the fact that it happened, so that the
public may know that this so-called
sport of prize-fighting still exists in our
midst. Our readers, by the way, may
perhaps be interested to learn that

[November 17, 1909.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“LORRIMER SABISTON, DRAMATIST.”
I HAVE my grave doubts whether the
profession of British Dramatist is so
established and assured that it can
afford to make merry in the open at
its own expense. Nor am I certain that
the cynical reflections of a playwright
upon his own art—very right and
profitable, no doubt, in the private
circle—is likely to afford much enter-
tainment to the general public, for one
must not judge by the almost pro-
fessional sympathy of a first-night
audience. Yet if Mr. CARTON is not de-
pending for success on his exposure of
the humours of his trade, I don't quite
see what he is depending on; for he
makes no recognisable appeal to the
elemental emotions. In the whole play
there is only one moment of strong feel-
ing, and even then the processes that led
up to it had been conducted off the stage.
But, anyhow, his play suffers from a
fundamental flaw , which makes the
whole fabric shaky from the start.
Lorrimer Sabiston is a dramatist who
has hitherto taken the side of the angels
and grown rich beyond the dreams of
dramatic avarice by giving the public
what they want -- anaemic propriety
with virtue ever triumphant. But sud-
denly, taking the nether powers into
his confidence, he writes the real thing,
a veritable hair-raiser, entitled “One
Law for the Woman.” He dares not
produce this in his own name for fear
of alienating the British matron. So he
induces Noel Darcus, a starving young
playwright, to let it be fathered on him
under a mutual bond of secrecy. . It
never seems to have occurred to Sabiston
that he might just as well have produced
the play anonymously and saved himself
from the grossness of taking advantage
of the poor boy's extreme need. This
is not the first time—The Builder of
Bridges was another case—where the
character played by Mr. ALEXANDER has
cheerfully undertaken to behave in-
tolerably without any apparent sign on
the part of either author or actor that he
was being asked to do anything outside
the day's work of an English gentleman.
Well, the play had a great vogue (I
don't know how it eluded the Censor or
what the police were doing at the time),
and then came a very pretty touch of
irony. Sabiston's friend, Lady Cheynley,
with whom his prospects of elopement
were beginning to look quietly rosy,
throws him over for the supposed author
of the town-shaking play, whom she
assumes to be made of the same virile
fibre as his alleged creation. But even
this dramatic situation loses much of its
effect by the ill-judged humours of a
scene in which the aggrieved husband
presents a figure of farce.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER made up for
his regrettable absence from Mid-
Channel by being on the stage for the
best part of the whole three hours.
He threw off his almost continuous
speeches—consisting largely of meta-
phors, the kind that you have to think
out over night — with astonishing
fluency and good nature. But apart from
this feat he was not called upon for a great
effort. It seemed that at any moment
he might be required to do some acting,
but the moment never came, except that
just before the final Act he suffered a
brief spasm of depression on hearing
Noel Darcus (Mr.GoDFREY TEARLE) to Lorrimºr
Sabiston (Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER). “Mind, if I
accept it, it's only because I'm starving.”
[Note.—Noel Darcus is the hollow, attenuated
figure on the right.]
that he could never hope to be the
co-respondent in the Cheynley suit.
I ought to add that he wore a hornéd
moustache and a short pointed beard,
which went admirably with a certain
Mephistophelian quality in the character
of Sabiston. These trimmings were in-
accurately referred to as “whiskers” by
someone in the gallery who wished
“GEORGE” to take them off; but I sin-
cerely hope that Mr. ALEXANDER will not
be foolish enough to follow the advice of
this intimate humourist.
Miss BERYL FABER played the part of
Lady Cheynley very naturally, like a
woman of the world who has exchanged
her illusions for a little quiet philosophy,
and is therefore the very last kind of
person to want to run away with a half-
baked genius. Life with Sabiston and
with Darcus she compared respectively
to a minuet and a tarantella, and selected
the latter. Yet I could not bring myself
to picture Miss FABER as dancing so
frenzied a measure with any conceivable
partner. She spoke throughout with a
level calm which declined to distinguish
between what was worth saying and
what was not. Thus, to the popular
platitude, “There is nothing so certain
in life as its uncertainties,” she appeared
to give the same value as she gave to
the best of Mr. CARTON's novelties. -
Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE's performance in
the invidious part of Noel Darcus was a
sketch in the rough, showing strength
without finish. If Darcus had not as-
sured us with his own lips that he had
been at Harrow as well as Oxford, I
might have mistaken him for a RHODEs
scholar. Mr. LowNE, in his usual part
of friendly critic, was as delightfully
human as ever; and of Mr. ViviaN REy-
NoLDs, who played a Press interviewer,
I could have wished to see a great deal
more. Miss Rosalie Toller was a really
picturesque ingénue; but her young
man, the Rev. Everard Bayne (Mr. MARTIN
LEwis) looked more like a chorister than
a curate. , Mr. JAMES CAREw (as Sir Henry
Cheynley) did a kind of rude justice to
a part that: needed Mr. FREDERick KERR
to make it seem probable. ... . --
The play was full of happy turns of
phrase, but these hardly made up fºr
its transparent naïveté of construction.
There was no movement, except that
when two people thought that they had
exhausted our patience they got up and
changed their seats; or when one of
them had to be manoeuvred out of the
way the typewriter came in and an-
nounced the arrival of a dressmaker
or a call on the telephone.". Pipes and
eighteen-penny cigars were in frequent
requisition to tide over the embarrass-
ments of a sedentary life.
As for the metaphors already referred
to, I should have been better pleased if
their quality had been as generous as
their quantity. To Sabiston's reminder
that he has given him a stepping-stone
to fame and fortune, Noel Darcus,
recognising that his own fount of in-
spiration is likely to remain unpro-
ductive, replies: “What is the good of
a stepping-stone when the stream is
dry 2” I have taken this metaphor
home in my head and tried to work it
out, but it makes no sort of sense in the
context. They are not even talking
about the same kind of stepping-stone.
Wit and enterprise and many other
excellent features abound in Mr. CAR-
TON's new work; but I must have my
final snarl, and say that when a dramatic
author sets out to ridicule, with however
light a touch, the foibles of his fellow-
craftsmen—and in what is professedly a
play, not a lecture—he is bound to pro-
vide an object-lesson that is above re-
proach. The critic, on the other hand,
has no such responsibility. Hence these
brave strictures.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
NEXT to coming into closer touch with the South Pole than
the foot of mortal man ever before carried him, Lieutenant
SHACKLETON (whom the world to-day acclaims as Sir ERNEST)
achieved his most stupendous work when he completed
The Heart of the Antarctic (HEINEMANN). It is the biggest
thing recently produced in the world of books. By happy
chance the author, richly equipped by nature with the
qualities that go to make a great explorer, has a literary
style of rare excellence. In the story of a journey that
brought him within a hundred miles of the South Pole he
compels the least imaginative to realise very vividly the
marvellous things he experienced; and this with the apparent
absence of effort that is the perfection of art. Unaided by
subvention from the Exchequer, he raised a sum of money
sufficient to justify him in planning the expedition. The
work, upon perfection of whose details depended the safety
of his own life and those of his companions, was personally
supervised by him. Nothing was left to chance. The
reward of this care was gathered throughout the expedition,
there being at no point a break-down in the equipment.
What strikes one in reading the wondrous tale is the
deathless hope, the dauntless good humour that faced the
awful difficulties daily recurring. “When things seem at
the worst they turn to their best,” is SHACKLETON's favourite
axiom, the sure foundation of his philosophy. It proved
triumphant to the last. Famished, cramped, bruised with
frequent falls over sharp ice, cut to the bone by icy gales
that sometimes travelled at the rate of seventy miles an hour,
snow-blinded, frost-bitten, SHACKLETON and his two com-
panions who made the final Southern journey held on till,
literally, they fell down. They turned back for the simple
but sufficient reason that their food supply was exhausted.
“Whatever regrets may be we have done our best,” is
SHACKLETON's half-apology for giving up the quest for the
mystic Pole. The two sumptuous volumes are profusely
illustrated with photographs taken on the spot, and are
further enriched by valuable maps which mark new territory.
Clearly I ought to be grateful to certain publishers for
their friendly lead in the matter of criticism so kindly given
me upon the wrappers of their books, because if it could
ever happen that the reviewer were too unconscientious to
read— Happily, however, in the case of Mrs. HENRY
DE LA PASTURE such a contingency is little likely to arise,
and her latest story, The Tyrant (METHUEN), is as full
as ever of those qualities which have gained her so
many admirers. Personally, I always think of this charming
author chiefly as the chronicler of delightful mothers.
No one else can write of them quite so tenderly and
well. We all know how fortunate Peter was in this
respect, and now in Mrs. Kemys the author has given us
yet another wholly lovable parent. But poor Mrs. Kemys
had a husband, the Squire of Nantgwilt, and the “tyrant” of
the title, whose avarice and despotic temper made the
beautiful Welsh home a place of misery for wife and children
and household. Suddenly, however, Richard Kemys is called
away on a voyage, and a chance discovery (what that was you
must find out for yourself) enables his long-suffering wife to

turn the tables. This is huge fun. The house becomes
transformed, money is lavished, the sons are made happy,
the daughters sought in marriage. And while everybody
concerned, including the author, is having a thoroughly
happy time, the tyrant-squire returns unexpectedly. And
then comes yet another surprise, in the very tender and
beautiful ending to an altogether charming book.
Acting on the eponymous principle, when I took up
Above All Things (LoNG) and found that its author was
W. TEIGNMoUTH SHORE, I settled down comfortably for a four-
hours' journey into the West Country; and this was rather
foolish, for as a matter of fact a twopenny 'bus fare from
Charing Cross would have covered the whole geography of
the plot. And, to tell the truth, if it happened to be a wet
day and the vehicle a motor-bus, there might have been
the first part of her story describes Esther's efforts to make
a living after her ruined and disgraced father had departed
this life, leaving his wife and daughter to sink or swim in
the stormy seas of workaday London. The text of the book
is that adversity is the best discipline. But unless Armstrong
has seen fit since his marriage to bridle his temper I can't
help thinking that Esther will sometimes sigh for the
relatively easy trials of her pre-nuptial state.
John Ayscough, having recently published a book entitled
A Roman Tragedy and Others (ARRowsMITH), now states
that to have called his new book (San Celestino) a tragedy
would have been to challenge just castigation, “for its author
cannot handle tragedy.” Fortunately it is not for me to dis-
pute this. The protagonists of “A Roman Tragedy” devote
some seventy pages to a laborious development of their cha-
some more exciting incidents. Above
All Things is a very simple story of
racters and make little progress with
their plot until they are within thirty
the variations of sentiment amongst
some very ordinary people, the only|
entanglement being that one of the
ladies is already married, and it has
to be discovered that her husband is
really dead and being impersonated
by an impostor before her hand is
free. The author has made the mis-
take, I think, of trying to transfer
interest from one heroine to another.
It was no use to tell me (in so many
words) that Arthur began to find he
was really in love with Kate, and that
John, who was supposed to adore her,
underwent a similar cardiac change,
and fastened his affections on May.
May met Arthur at the beginning of
the book, and I was prepared to like
her, whereas nothing was done from
an artistic point of view to make me
feel interested in Kate. John was
dull, and he would have suited her
nicely. After all, it is my feelings
that have to be considered, and, waiv-
ing this, why, in the name of LoNG,
has the book been entitled, Above
All Things 2 If any of the people
had #.' in one of those very new
pages of their end. Then, realising
their unpunctuality, they achieve a
hasty climax of murder and sudden
death and leave nothing for the last
twenty pages but retrospective ex-
planations. Of the “others” the last
two only are good, a third, “Rever-
sions,” opening hopefully with a
lively account of a gallant captain's
matrimonial enterprise, but conclud-
ing dismally with a surfeit of oppor-
tune coincidence. Mr. Ayscough's
new book, San Celestino, is de-
scribed by its publishers (SMITH,
ELDER) as a work that throws fresh
light upon the career of CELESTIUS V.,
the man ever remembered for his
connection with the “gran’ rifiuto.”
It expressly disclaims any historical
intention, and so cannot be criti-
cised upon points of accuracy. It
denies itself the title of a novel,
and so cannot be blamed for lack
of sustained dramatic interest. But
even by describing it as “an essay
lin reconstruction” the author has
not avoided by anticipation all
fault-finding, for there is about
blocks of flats, or had owned an
aeroplane, I could have understood
it; but as most of the action takes
place in Vincent Square, Westmin-

a fearful spectacle when he was in a rage. The day after
they became engaged she paid him a surprise visit in his
studio, where she knew he would be working at his statue,
“The Bride.” And, lo and behold (horresco referens), she
saw two brides besides herself—the white marble statue, and
another white figure “with brown hair heaped upon its head.”
As she had never seen a model before, she fainted on the
spot. When she came to, Armstrong, after indulging in a
little Armstrong language, set to work to smash the beautiful

Forged in the smoke of her smithy an
Artful political rune,
Doubtless Arcadian villagers,
Heedless of omens of war,
Careless of far-away pillagers,
Followed their herds as before;—
So, when oracular offices
Send me their leaflets of doom,
All unaffected by prophecies
Calmly my cleek I resume;

Stolid of will as a serf,

Surface by dint of his clubs.

Fronting the infinite main,

Start on our cycle again.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Poiling with indig-

publicity of your columns to bring to
the light of day yet another scandalous
ca e of unemployment due directly and
entirely to the iniquitous system of Free
Trade under which Great Britain at
present struggles. Reading, a few even-
ings ago, my paper, I found the following
piteous demand for work:—
“Fat man wants job, age 32; 5 ft. 11; 21
stone; been on stage.”
What could provide a better example of
the handicap under which we labour
than this advertisement? To think
that this Briton, with his splendid
natural advantages, should be con-
demned to waste away in desuetude (is
that the word 2) while, in the many

advantage of our lax laws to dump their
mountains of flesh on our markets'
Here we have an important Blitish
industry strangled, while the home-
grown article advertises plaintively for
a job of any kind. How much longer
is this to continue? I naturally perused
the “Wanted" column of my newspaper
to see if I could find for our portly
friend-in-need the best market for his
wares. Alas, the most appropriate that
I could find was the following:—
“Trouser press and stretcher, new condition;
state lowest price; on approval.”
Even for this I fear he is ineligible. It
stipulates “new condition.” He con-
fesses to 32 years' wear.
Or again there is this:–
“First-class canvasser; no wasters.-Apply
7 to 9 p.m.”
It is brief and not explicit, but it might
suit.
A little further down I find the
following:—
“Overcoat, warm, grey, good condition, fit
ordinary man, 15s. 6d.”
This again brings home to us the hard
lot of our friend. Even the privilege of

[Hints for an Electoral address, following the line of argument adopted
by the Radical Press.]
WHAT' Men of England Shall it be
That you, a self-respecting nation,
Propose to crook a servile knee
And grovel at the Peers' dictation?
If so, you cannot be aware
What outrage you are asked to bear!
Then you shall hear the horrid truth.
We made a Bill, a perfect treasure;
We sent it up, and they, forsooth,
Said that on such a doubtful measure
(Here comes the insult) they preferred
That you should have the final word /
That Budget, simple, bright and terse,
They did not fling it back or flout it,
But, just to make you wince the worse,
Chose to invite your views about it !
Has Liberty been ever dealt
A nastier knock beneath the belt 2
Not for ourselves we raise a squeal;
Our case is rough, but yours is rougher;
It is for you we rather feel,
Guessing how sadly you must suffer
At being asked if you detect
Anything wrong in your Elect.
For such were we four years ago,
And such we should by rights continue,
And you should not be asked to show
A reason for the faith that's in you—
A faith that's got some years to run
Before you need another one.
Meanwhile, if you incline to hold
No further views on any matter,
'Tis your prerogative of old
Which no one yet has sought to shatter;
For in defence of such a right -
Even a worm would turn and bite.
So, if these self-anointed Peers
Challenge your claims (of which the sum is
That for a term of six full years
You're privileged to act as dummies)
And ask you what you really think,
Rise in your wrath and strike them pink.
Ay! this is Armageddon's eve!
To-morrow's fight shall mend or end 'em-
Stern chastisement, with no reprieve,
For that outrageous referendum ;
Henceforth no Peer will lightly choose
To dare consult the People's views!

WEEK END WISDOM.
[“We should be poor-spirited indeed if we did not welcome any
fresh departure in journalism whose aim is to afford our judges [the
British public], without prejudice and without favour, the clearest
means of estimating the value of our idea's, the extent of our
successes, even the depth of our shortcomings. . . . . . It is
an arduous task to be impartial, but it is worth the effort, and I fancy
that never more than now was the moment more propitious or the
need more urgent.”—Mr. Lloyd George on “Independence in Criti-
eism,” in “The Week End.”] -
It is with great pleasure that we are able to furnish our
readers with further extracts from special articles to be con-
tributed by other leading politicians to journals of note.
Thus, the LoRD Advocate, writing on “The Need of
Accuracy” in The Precision, will make the following
admirable and suggestive remarks:– +
“No politician, certainly no one implicated, however
humbly, in the Government of the country, can fail to welcome
the exact and diligent presentation of facts bearing on
current events. No doubt the prevailing tendency is to
accept opinions presented on customarily recognised
authority with too little scrutiny and often with a too un-
questioning obedience. Hence the paramount importance of
a paper which, aiming at impartiality as well as conciseness
of statement, may well be found to meet the requirements
of that vast body of the public which wishes to be guided,
informed, and helped concisely, promptly and clearly on the
great topics of the day—from the labourer pining in his
hovel to the Duke squatting on his unearned millions.
It is a difficult job to be accurate, but it is worth the effort,
and I am convinced that never more than now was the
moment more propitious or the need more imperative.”
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, discussing in The Moderator the
need of restraint, will make the following timely comments:—
“There is no doubt that many speakers are carried away by
wishing to make the meeting a success or to score a
point and leave a vivid impression on the minds of their
hearers; and they, therefore, sometimes cross the border-
line without realising the effect some of their remarks may
have. The busy age may to some extent account for this.
The man whose future depends upon his tongue cannot
always spare the necessary time to familiarise himself with
the meticulous minutiae of a tedious theme. He may even
find it difficult merely to ground himself in the broad
issues of any comprehensive policy, and the temptation to
economise time and thought by the simple process of look-
ing only at one side of a question is almost irresistible.
Again, the verisimilitude of an unconvincing statement is
always hugely enhanced by a liberal resort to decorative
polysyllables. In fine, to be accurate –hic labor, hoc opus
est; but it is worth the struggle, and I feel that never more
than at the present was the hour more opportune or the
need more clamorous.”
A COLOURABLE SUGGESTION.
TROUBLE is imminent in house-decorating circles, as there
seem to be theories abroad that wall-paper should harmonise,
or contrast with, a person's—and more especially a lady's
—mood, character and complexion. It will be no light
matter for the chatelaine of a country house, or the mana-
geress of a hotel, to adjust the various apartments to her
guests' idiosyncrasies, or vice-versá. What is going to happen
if the choleric individual “sees red” on getting up in the
morning, the hypochondriac has been quartered amid blue
surroundings, and the ingénue is bestowed in the pink
instead of the green bedroom? There will in all probability
be some highly chromatic passages over the breakfast
table, and the house party will be off colour for the rest of
the day. If such a contretemps is likely to happen, the

decided to forecast one or two of the
questions which will probably be asked
of them, and to set forth the answers
thereto in such a pleasing and instruc-
tive style as is bound to secure the
passing of any one of them who will
take the trouble to learn such answers
by heart. This indulgence I do not limit
to William, James, George, or Henry; any
examinee in the world is welcome to use
them in whatsoever subject he may be
examined, for one should never tie
oneself too closely to the subject matter
of the question actually asked. I have
chosen the subject of Law, because my
four weary and sourfaced friends are
going to be barristers, and I cannot
believe that they would submit to an
examination in Botany or Logarithms.
Question 1. “Distinguish a crime
from a tort.”

too careful in distinguishing crimes

“'ERE, come Along, 'ERB--wot's THE Good o' Looking AT THAT 2 CAN'T YER SEE IT's sold 7"
from torts. However much alike they
may at first sight appear to be, there is
that in their natures which is so totally
different, so, one might almost say, dia-
metrically opposite, as to lead one later
to wonder how the deuce
should have said, how in the world one
ever came to regard them as standing in
any need of being distinguished. The
short truth is this: crimes are crimes
and torts are torts all the world over.
Given a thing which might be either,
there is one efficacious and entirely con-
clusive test. Examine it minutely, and,
if the criminal element preponderates, it
is a crime; if the tortious, it is a tort.”
Question 2. “Does the Statute of
Limitations apply to parol contracts 2
Give your reasons.”
Winning Answer. On the one hand
a statute, being a statute, applies to
everything. On the other hand this
statute has, confessedly, its limitations.
Yet it was no doubt with a view to its
applicability, either to parol contracts or
something else, that the Legislature hit
on the happy device of a Statute of Limi-
tations. I feel it is not for me to look
too closely into the motives actuating a
body of men so vastly superior to myself
as the British law-giving authority, but
since I am pressed by my indulgent
examiners to state my opinion, I will
now proceed to do so, demonstrating
incidental y on what grounds I establish
the very definite conclusion at which I
arrive.” (Let me now inform you,
William, James, George and Henry, that
I the defeating of this question is a matter
of guile. Having contrived to be near
the bottom of a page by this time, you
finish off with the words:–“The ques-
tion, does the Statute of Limitations
apply to parol contracts, may be answered
decidedly in the .” Say that was
page 5, you number your next page “8,”
and proceed as under. It would be
unwise to make any reference to the
possibility of some of your pages being
lost before they reach the examiner. His
suspicions might be aroused. Much
better let him tumble to it himself.)
“Page 8.
“of Limitations. For those, among other
reasons, it will be clearly seen that the
answer stated above is the right one, and
the contrary opinion, though often urged
with apparent seriousness in our courts
of law, entirely mistaken.”
Question 3. “A. is the owner of a
house. B. also is the owner of a house.
The houses of A. and B. adjoin. C. is a
bankrupt, and has made a will in which
he leaves £4,000 to D. D. has applied
for debenture mortgage stock in the
E. Company, Limited, to which F. is
secretary. Upon investigation it turns
out that A., B., C., D., E. and F.
are all one person. Trace the several
effects upon the various civil and
criminal rights and liabilities arising
therefrom.”
Winning Answer. “Much might be
said on this most interesting point, but
this candidate prefers to deny himself
the pleasure of a minute examination of
the results of the circumstances de-
scribed. Rather he intends to confine
himself to a courteous appeal to the better
nature of his examiners, and to beg of
them as a personal favour that they will
let him through this time. The candi-
date is a married man, with twenty-five
children and no salary. He bears an
excellent character, and, if the Court
will only deal leniently with him this
time, there is bound to be such a burst
of enthusiasm in home circles as cannot
fail to result in a very pleasant theatre
party and a most substantial supper
afterwards at the Carlton, to which it is
as good as certain that the examiners
will be invited. This is mentioned as a
matter of interest, and in no way as a
bribe. Thank goodness, however Eng-
land may have sunk in other matters,
she can still boast the finest, least par-
tial, least corruptible and best-looking
examiners in the world.”

NERO AND NEROINE.
JUST as a matter of form I took a pair
of gloves and drove round to the
Galleries, but I did not expect to find
anybody there. However, there ap-
peared to be quite a lot of people.
“Then the dance has not been post-
poned ?” I said to the man who accepted
my coat.
“Hardly seems like it,” he replied.
“Perhaps they haven't heard the
news,” I said; and I bustled off to find
someone in authority.
A dear old friend, who used to share
my Latin proses at school, approached,
staggering beneath a weight of orders,
ribbons, garters, rosettes and what not.
“Look here,” I began at once, “this
is no time for dressing up. We can't
stand fiddling here while Rome is burn-
ing. You re a steward ”’’
“How did you guess?” he asked.
“Well, you must stop the dance. I
suppose you’ve heard what's hap-
pened 2"
“The question is, have you heard
what's going to happen? My boy, I'm
going to introduce you to the prettiest
girl north of the Equator. Ah, here
she is.”
| Mechanically I went through the
introduction, and with a heavy heart
| broke into what the Press calls the
“mazy waltz” with her. Feeling that
the whole thing was some horrible
dream I led her to a secluded corner,
and offered a meringue, an ice, a
cup of coffee, champagne cup, and a
marron glacé. She refused them all.
“Yes,” I said, “I agree with you. It
is a mockery to sit here eating, when in
the great world outside—”
“One can't begin after the very first
dance, I always say.”
“Sometimes I wonder if I shall ever
eat again.”
“Lots of people feel like that, just
after Oh, do let's talk about some-
thing else.”
“There is only one thing to talk
about,” I cried. “The Constitution has
been torn asunder— —”
“I don't think you're doing what I
asked you,” she said coldly. “Have
you been to many plays lately 2”
“Plays Haven't you heard the
news? The so-called House of Lords—”
“Oh, politics' Do you know, I don't
take much interest in them.”
“This isn't to be dismissed lightly as
‘politics,’” I said excitedly. “The
whole world—north of the Equator—”
“Isn't that the music beginning 2
Let's go back, shall we ?”
We went back; and I decided to
leave the giddy throng in order to strike
somehow a blow for freedom. Just
as I had got my coat my friend the
ambassador came up.
“A charming girl in green for you
here,” he said, taking me by the arm.
“The best dancer south of the Aurora
Borealis. Let me introduce you.”
Once more I found myself treading
the mazy whirl; once more I found
myself sitting on the sofa in the little
room on the right as you go downstairs.
“Have you been to many dances
lately 2” said the girl in green.
“Is this a time for dances,” I said,
sternly, “when all England is reeling
under a blow dealt by a handful of
hereditary irresponsibles? You have
not heard the tidings? They have kept
the ill news from you, fearing to mar
your innocent gaiety? Yet the time must
come when 2 x

“A revolution has begun, the end of
which no man can foresee.”
“Oh where 2 ”
“You ask me where?”
“Of course you mean in Spain. But

aren't they? I think Queen ENA is so
sweet, don't you? Isn't the floor good
to-might 2'
“Spain? What of Spain? We have
had a revolution forced on us in Eng-
land In England, yes; but all Europe
—south of the Aurora Borealis * >
“Shall we be getting back? It’s so
hard to hear the music from here. I
suppose you’ve heard about the Budget
being thrown out 2 ” she went on, as we
got up. “I’m so glad, aren't you? I
hate horrid taxes.”
As soon as I was alone again I dashed
to the cloak-room, struggled into my hat
and coat, and told the porter to get me
a hansom. I would shake the dust of
frivolity from my shoes, and
“Hallo,” said my friend the archduke,
“you can't possibly dance in all those
things. Leave 'em here and the man will
give you a ticket. I have a delightful
girl with golden slippers just round the
corner—the best talker west of Suez.
She wants to sit this out with you.”
Ah, here at last was a girl who under-
stood | She too had no heart for
dancing.
We sat in silence for some time in
the little room on the right as you go
downstairs. Then I looked all round
me, saw that we were alone, and said in
a hollow voice:—
“When our shords are seethed—
when our swords are sheathed there
will not be one Duke left.”
“Have you seen Smith ?” said the
best talker west of Suez.
“No. Are the chosen of the people
to be thwarted by a handful of irrecon-
cilables? Shall a degenerate——”
“Don’t you love MARIE LöHR2"
“Yes. Is the Representative House to

“Do you go to many plays 2"
“Several. The battle is joined; the
lists are set ; like a trumpet-call to

“Have you read any good novels

“Five. The revolution into which
the haughty backwoodsmen have entered
so lightly—”
“Do you rink a great deal 2"
“Moderately. Are the lords of Wal-
bottle, the patrons of the beer bottle, to
dictate —”
“Have you been to the Motor Show
yet?”
“No.” I sighed deeply. “Do you
mind if we stop for a moment?” I said.
“I’m getting rather giddy.”

“A ravishing creature in pink,” said
a voice after supper; “the jolliest girl
outside Pwllheli. She's been keeping
a dance for you.”
“This is the best tune in the book,”
said the ravishing creat re as we took
the floor. “Don tº let's lose any of it.
You start with the left foot–one, two,
three, one, two, three.”
“Which foot do you go on with ?
That's much more important. I shall
try the right . . . This is delightful.

“I expect it's me. What have you been
doing all day? Don't say “working';

“Just as you like, you know.”
“The truth is,” I said firmly, “I’ve

“All of them—even The Financial

“Yes. Oh, yes. Only—— I think I
must have read too many of them. One
loses one's sense of proportion.”
“I lose simply everything. Gloves,
fams, handkerchiefs.”
“Well, you very nearly lost me. I
all but went after the third dance.”
“Why? Did you have a very heavy
partner?”
“No, not exactly that; but
are you keen on — on politics and
things?”
“Why, of course.”
“Good. Then let's—let's talk about
them . . . some day.”
“Rather.”
“Only not just now.”
“Oh, no!”
“No, of course not. I say, have you
any more dances to spare 2"
“I think so. I'll see when we sit
down. I'm enjoying to-night awfully,
aren't you?” said the jolliest girl out-
side Pwllheli.
“Awfully,” I said with conviction.

“PICTURE PUZZLES.” HARDEST PUZZLE OF ALL–TO FIND THE HOSTESS.
PAIRED OPINIONS.
FREQUENT inquiries reach us from conscientious voters
as to the best way of arriving at an honest opinion upon a
debatable question like Tariff Reform, when so many
authoritative views are daily thrust upon them. Thus:–
(a) What Mr. BALFOUR thinks.
} What Mr. BALFour used to think.
% What Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL says.
(d) What Mr. WALTER LONG maintains.
(e) What the hired roughs at Bermondsey thought.
% What the hired roughs at Horley thought.
(g) What Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said in 1884.
(h) What Mr. DUMPHREYs said all along.
i) What Mr. BALFour declared about Old Age Pensions.
} What Mr. URE subsequently reiterated.
Our answer is that frigid and calculated organisation is
necessary; method alone will bring peace. Let the con-
scientious voter do as we do—paste on uniform cards all
the statements as they appear, put them in a drawer, go
through them every week, take out and destroy all pairs
(i.e., statements which cancel one another), and decide, for
the time being, by such arguments as remain, if any.
The above list appears, on the face of it, to promise great
confusion of conscience. Actually, it is quite simple, the
pairs being, of course, as follows:—a, b, c, d; e, f; g, h;
i, j. An opinion formed before these arguments were put
forth would therefore remain intact.
The filing system, thus adapted to politics, not only
brings mental quiet and ensures a right decision, but affords
pleasant recreation during the winter evenings, highly
instructive to the little ones. -

BOOKMEN AS CANDIDATES.
THE announcement that, like Mr.
METHUEN, Mr. HeineMANN also contem-
plates entering the Parliamentary arena
comes as no surprise to those who have
been watching the trend of ambition in
literary circles.
Mr. HEINEMANN's first intention, we
understand, was to offer himself as a
candidate for the Isle of Heinemann,
as his famous client, Mr. HALL CANE,
wittily calls it. Imagine his disappoint-
ment on ascertaining that the Isle of
Heinemann has no representative at
Westminster! Mr. HEINEMANN, however,
has since been greatly gratified by the
pressing invitation of the Bayswater
International As ociation that he should ||
come forward as an Independent candi-
date in the Humanitarian interest.
Enormous satisf ction is expressed in
Nonconformist literary circles at the an-
nouncement that Sir WILLIAM ROBERTSON
NicoLL, M.O.K., O.O., will contest the
Crockett division of Galloway in the
Kailyard interest. There was some
natural disappointment in the hop county
that Sir William was not going to carry
the banner of Lloyd-Georgian Reform
to victory at the head of the Men of
Kent, but it is generally admitted that
the claims of the Kailyard Caucus were
irresistible. Mr. DAvid LYALL and the
Reverend CLAUDIUS CLEAR have already
thrown themselves into the campaign
with extraordinary energy, and there is
hardly a hamlet in the whole division
which has not already been waked to
ecstasy by the intoxicating eloquence of
those two superb and pathetic orators.
Mr. John LoNG, on recently being
asked whether he was going to stand
for Parliament, returned a somewhat
enigmatic answer. “Whether I go to
Westminster or not,” he replied, “at
any rate I mean to stand by Wales.”
Mr. EveLEIGH NASH, it appears, also
favours the gallant little Principality, a
safe seat having been offered him in
Cardiganshire. Asked why he was
attracted to this particular locality, Mr.
NASH observed, “Cardiganshire has
always appealed to me through its pictu-
resque qualities and associations. What
should we do without Cardigan waist-
coats? The town of Cardigan, perhaps
you may not be aware, has two stone
bridges across the river Teifi, an old
and stately church, and the remains of
an ancient castle famous in Welsh
history. I feel that as its Member I
should be able to do much to restore
the fallen fortunes of this romantic
spot.”
Lastly, Mr. CLEMENT K. SHORTER, it is
freely bruited in Fleet Street, is con-
sidering the urgent request of the
Haworth Liberal Association to stand
for that division of Yorkshire.

Extracted from THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
AWFUL SCENE OF GLOOM AND DEJECTION, WHEN THE MINISTRY HEARD OF THE LORDS DECISION TO
REFER THE BUDGET TO THE COUNTRY.
House of Lords, Tuesday, Novem-
ber 16.-Something delightſully casual,
superbly English, about Parliamentary
manner at great crises. To-day climax
reached in first stage of one that promises
to exceed any that have shaken the
country since Reform Bill times. Inci-
dentally, but primarily, existence of
House of Lords as partner in legislative
machine is at stake.
Common knowledge that LANSDowne,
punctual in his place at 4.30, carries in
waistcoat pocket the final, irrevocable
challenge to fight to the finish. Yet
attendance limited to a score of Peers.
On front bench to right of Woolsack
CREWE and GRANARD sole representatives
of a threatened Government. For com-
panions on the other side of Table,
HALSBURY, CAwdor, LoNDONDERRY, SALis-
BURY, MARLBoRough, DoNough MoRE and
ASHBOURNE support their Leader.
Brief pause followed on striking of
half-hour. Silence broken by voice
of LANSDowne, discovered standing at
Table with fateful scrap of paper in
hand.
“My Lords,” he said, “I beg to give
notice that on the second reading of the
Finance Bill I will move that this House
is not justified in giving its consent to
this Bill until it has been submitted to
the judgment of the country.”
That was all. Had he been observing
across the Table into the languid ear of
Earl CREwe that it was a fine day, there
might have been more inflection of
emotion in his tone, more of flutter in
his manner. CREWE seemed on point
of replying, “Yes, but rather cold, don't
you think?” Itecognising irrelevancy
of remark he forbore.
No cheer burst forth from confident
Opposition, no sharp response from
jubilant Ministerialists. AMPTHILL put
a question as to position of British
Indians in Transvaal, and House pro-
ceeded to deal with the Orders of the
Day.
HALSBURY's imperturbability a cloak
for exuberant homest satisfaction.
“This 'll teach 'em, Toby, dear boy,”
he said, as we crossed Lobby by closed
doors of deserted, desolate Commons.
“Those Radicals, with URE at their
head, have been putting about stories
to effect that we, the old mobility, are
influenced in opposition to Budget by
personal considerations, strengthened
by sympathy with an honourable Trade.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
It is true LLoyd GEORGE, with Welsh
attorney instinct, mulcts landowners in
various ways. Increases the Death
Duties; invents a Super-tax specially
designed to catch a pensioned ex-Lord
Chancellor. Also puts up charges on
Licensed Victuallers. What of that ?
LANSDowne's amendment distinctly shows
that all we think of is the welfare of the
country. We are not going to sit by
and see it trampled upon by the vote of
300 so-called representatives of the
people. Lord Codlin is the friend of
every man who has a vote. Mr. Short
is a fraud.”
“But,” I asked, “isn't there some
little difficulty on a constitutional ques-
tion? Didn't you in 1897, when SPENCER,
KIMBERLEY, and other Liberal Peers
desired to move amendment to Voluntary
Schools Bill involving money question,
quote with approval Sir THOMAS MAY's
dictum that “all aids and supplies to
His Majesty in Parliament are the sole
gift of the Commons, not to be changed
or altered by the House of Lords?' And
didn't you thereupon declare SPENCER's
Amendment out of order?”

Wednesday night. — From darkest
depths of disputation round Irish Land
Bill the MEMBER FOR SARK has always
seen the stars. It seemed all up with
the bantling when the Lords almost
literally mangled it. Certainty of early
funeral confirmed when the Commons,
disdaining to discuss the Lords' amend-
ments seriatim, disagreed with them
en bloc. But there's money in it, and
SARK does not remember a case when
either Irish landlord or tenant refused
to take cash from the Saxon.
Facts of case simple. GEORGE WYND-
HAM's well-meant scheme for facilitating
transfer of Irish land from owner to
tenant has broken down owing to faulty
financial provisions. These St. AUGUS-
TINE proposes to remedy. The bonus
bestowed by the Wyndham Bill by way
of oiling the machinery of transfer was
twelve millions sterling. The Bill Lords
and Commons have been playing battle-
dore and shuttlecock with proposes
to throw in an extra three millions,
completing a total of between seventy
and eighty millions, for which the British
tax-payer, t at modern ISSACHAR, an ass
borne down by cruel burdens, will
provide.
Controversy between Lords and Com-
mons arose upon landlords and tenants
fighting each other for larger share of
the plunder. To-night, Bill comes back
for the consideration of Commons' reasons
for disagreeing with Lords' amendments.
The landlords, justly fearful of losing
the bone whilst snatching at its reflection
in the brook, cave in and agree not to
insist on their amendments.
That all very well if they stopped
there. Proceeded to carry others less
drastic but not more likely to be accepted
by Irish Nationalists. So Bill goes back
to Commons, still in peril. But, as SARK
insists, an additional three millions is
not to be wantonly chucked away.

FROM THE ETHICAL BILGE-TUB.
WE have received the appeal of
“The International Order of Ethics and
Culture,” which seeks to replace “our
crumbling religions” with a brotherly
friendship “founded on the mutual
inspiration of social-ethical actions.”
The “programm” of the new Order is
quite in keeping with these high aims.
It “prescribes moral and financial help
for all the progressiv currants [sic] as far
as they are in accordance with the
principles of the Order,” and creates
“a sort of cummunity whose meetings are open
for everybody, official speaches in the case of
funerals, weddings and in other important and
emotional events of life if somebody is asking
for it or if the clergyman refuses the attend-
ance.
The organisation of the Order is
absolutely democratic:-
“We are fighting dogmatism of any kind as
well as every worship of authorities. In our
circles there shall be cultivated but noble
friei dship. We remark that we exclude from
our meetings any a coholic beverage, doing so
or the sake of opposing the unreasonable
drinking costoms and in order to secure the
majesty and the earnestness of our work. We
akn weledge by this the full right of the
antialcoholic movement and other social and
ethical movements of the kind, but we dont
command our members any obligation of such
kind for their private life.”
After all, the best guarantee of the
seriousness of the new movement is
afforded by the list of its officers and
supporters. The President of the Inter-
national Central Committee is Miss
Gertrud Woker, of Berne, and amongst
others “the following personalities have
declared to be in accordance with the
aims of the Order”:—
Rev. E. Baars, Vegesack (Breme).
Prof. Dr. Odo Bujwid.
Paul Geheeb, Pedagogist.
Miss Mally Kachel.
Leopold Katscher.
Dr. A. Suter-Ruffy.
Dr. Saleeby (London).
Director Kiss, Budapest.
But the names of distinguished men
and women of science are not enough.
“Homes must be established every-
where . . . To found a Home we want
but 5 plucky persons who devote about
2 hours weekly to our cause.” We
sincerely trust, that this interesting
cummunity will lend such impetus to
the progressiv currants that they will
sweep away the vicious costoms of the
past in an avalanche of antialcoholic
enthusiasm.

LIEUTENANT SMITH.
[Territorial officers are sometimes mystified at the strange way in
which words of command are mutilated for the sake of smartness at the
Chelsea School of Instruction: the Guards, for instance, execute certain
movements on the word “Hipe."]
LIEUTENANT SMITH, a “Terrier,” fared forth to learn his trade;
Boldly he went to Chelsea School and stºod upon parade.
They rated and they humbled him; and then, when all was
ripe,
They crowned his efforts with a smile and taught him to say
“HIPE.” -
With rare enthusiasm filled, back to his corps went he,
IResolved that all should share his luck and learn this mystery.
He proved to all his N.C.O.s that any form or type
Of movement could be carried out by merely shouting, “HIPE.”
Amongst a batch of raw recruits he chanced to get to know
A butche with a splendid voice who hailed from Pimlico;
When evening fell this man was wont to shout the joys of
tripe . . . .
Smith made him sergeant on the spot, and changed the word
to “HIPE.”
Intox cated with success, he madly cast away
His whistle and his compass, and even his épée
And when on Company Parade bestowed an extra stripe
On Corporal Jones, who gave the word: “Move to the left
in--HIPE '''
At length the Adjutant, informed of Smith's insane career,
Took the young man apart, and said, “None of your Guards'
tricks here;
You've done your duty, passed your Schools; but now,
Sir, you must wipe -
Your military tablets clean: we can't put up with “HipH.’”
My tale is done: the maggot word liad camped within his
brain.
'Twas two years later when I saw Lieutenant Smith again;
I met him in a country place where I was shoo ing snipe ;
Poor chap, he scares the hungry crow ; and all he says
is “HIPE.”

archaeologists and historians.
The King of GREECE, for instance, is said to have expressed
his royal conviction that the ninth and tenth books of the
Iliad are both up to sample, and that the Odyssey was not
written by a woman ; he also exonerates Phidi As from the
accusation of having carved portraits of himself and PERICLES
on the shield of Athena. Just at present he is prep ring an
authoritative plan of the battle of Salamis (480 B.C.) in order
to clear up a few points that have puzzled historians.
King Victor EMMANUEI, again, has promised the Pope to
look round the galleries of the Vatican some afternoon and
settle the dates of one or two disputed pieces of statuary.
It will also come as a great relief to many hesitating

THE GOLD-FISH.
WHEN Saccharissa said she wanted
some gold-fish I naturally asked why.
These were her “reasons”:—
(a) I want them.
(b) They look so tweet and twinkly in
a dear little bowl.
(c) They are soothing to watch.
d) Their up-keep costs so little.
e) The water absorbs the gases in the
r00m.
(f) I want them.
I countered thus:–
(a) You don't really want them.
(b) The stars are tweeter and twinklier
“in that inverted bowl we call
the sky.”
(c) You can watch me smoking.
(d) When Tariff Reform comes their
food may cost us more.
(e) I can be no party to fish-poisoning.
(f) I don't.
She listened patiently, murmured
“Yes, darling, but—” at intervals,
kissed me resignedly, and said, “Well,
dearest, if you're determined . . . and
I had set my heart on them.”
So of course I bought a couple of the
little beggars next day.
Saccharissa greeted me rapturously,
dropped the bowl on the floor, and
screamed. William and Mary (I had
named them already) lay gasping.
“Oh, Jack, what shall we do?” she
wailed.
“Give them air!” I shouted. “Or,
rather, water. Quick ' '
She flew for a basin and returned
panting. Then, as she hates clammy
things, she picked them up with the
fish-slice and dropped them into their
native element. They looked almost as
relieved as Saccharissa.
“Will it hurt them, do you think?”
she quavered. “Is there anything else
we could do?”
“Well . . .

but—
“Cruel!” she flashed, “to make fun

“All right! Try them with an ant's-

A couple of ant's-eggs were admin-
istered, and, would you believe it? that
hog William snaffled both.
“Oh, poor Mary !” said Saccharissa.
“And I'm sure she's starving — see
how she keeps on opening and shutting
her mouth !”
“Merely bad language,” I said. “The
water deadens the sound.”
“Do you think so? . . . Well, I wish
she wouldn't—it looks perfectly beastly.
Jack, why don't they drown when they
open their mouths?”
“Because they breathe with their
gills, of course. Fancy not knowing that!”
we might put a dash of
in, to buck them up a bit,
“But their gills are open too,” she
objected. -
“How on earth could they breath

“Ye—s, but why-–”
“Mary is ready for anotherant's-egg,”
I said firmly. “Tempt her to beg—
see if she'll stand on her tail. I'll
keep William off with the paper-knife.”
Mary was uppish and refused to beg.
As for William, I was simply disgusted.
After several futile efforts to elude the
paper-knife he went to the bottom and
sulked—like a naughty child.
“Stir him up,” said Saccharissa.
“I'm sorry he has such a vile temper.
Stir him up !”
“Give me an egg-whisk,” I said,
“and William shall think he is helping
at a performance of “The Maelstrom' at
the Hippodrome.”
“No, we mustn't be heartless.

I gave him a “weeny’ poke, and
William simply hared round the basin,
looking as sick as mud.
“That's enough,” said Saccharissa
presently, “ or else he'll get curvature
of the spine. We mustn't over-tire him,
bad though he is. Oh, I am glad
you bought them, Jack! They will be
a perpetual source of joy!”
“H'm ' " I grunted.

She tended them zealously for three
days, “changing the water” whenever
she felt dull or had nothing special to
do. William had a near shave in the
sink once. If the grating had been a
hair's-breadth bigger, or if William had
eaten fewer ant's-eggs for breakfast, his
number would have gone up. The
fourth day she asked me to feed them,
as she was “busy.” The next day they
were forgotten altogether, and starved.
Saccharissa, on discovering her error,
wept bitterly and grossly over-fed them.
For a week they battened on a
generous diet; then she was “busy"
again and I had to feed them.
I fed them without protest for three
days. Then I reminded Saccharissa
that they were her fish, not mine. She
said–guite mildly—“Yes, dear.”
After a fortnight had passed without
change, I suggested that as the fish had
lost interest for her I might at least get
some fun out of the investment. Why
not a bent pin and a worm, or races
in the bath 2 -
The idea “did not appeal to her.”
Disgusted at such ingratitude, I advo-
cated a little dinner to our parcenus
friends, the Browns. Why not take the
shine out of them with an up-to-date
savoury, “Gold-fish on Toast” 2. She
said I was always thinking of my—of
food.
So I said, “Dash it! We are both
sick of them. Let's give them away !”

Jumps on his mare, and off he canters;

THERE IS Too GREAT A chANCE of The origiNAL BEING within EAR-shot.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT looks as if Robert HICHENs, in his recent trifle, Barbary
Sheep, was giving us a little of the superfluous material left over
from the preparation of his present larger work, Bella Donna
(HEINEMANN). In both novels he handles the same rather
distasteful theme, the passion of an Englishwoman for an
Oriental. But, while in Barbary Sheep the lady's infatuation
was abrupt and improbable, here, in Bella Donna, he is
dealing with a type that is clearly capable de tout. It has
been a weakness with Mr. HiCHENS to be too expansive.
Usually, instead of putting himself to the pains of selecting
the one right word or phrase, he gives us a round score to
choose from. And in Bella Donna he still seems to mistrust
the imagination of his readers and even to doubt if they
are giving him their full attention; for he is constantly
reminding them of his Nile background with its familiar
noises and movements. But, apart from this reiteration
of certain details, the old fault has been amended. From
the first page, where he introduces a most intriguing
portrait of a fashionable doctor, the story is told with
an economy of language which increases with the growing
interest of the action. In the last half, indeed, we are
scarcely allowed breathing-time for reflection; otherwise
we should perhaps wonder whether he has provided Bella'
Donna with an adequate motive for the attempted destruction
of her husband by poison.
is advanced to show that his elimination was an essential to
her freedom, she being the woman she was ; or that she
was likely to feel more comfortable in the rather variegated |
ménage of the Graeco-Egyptian Baroudi, if she had joined it
as a widow rather than as a runaway wife. But I was
too well entertained to worry much about this. What did
worry me a little was the author's reference to Robert BROWNING
as having carried his new wife away “to the peaks of the
Apennines.” There can no longer be any need for conceal-
ment in the matter; anyhow it is an open secret that he
took her to the low-lying plains of Tuscany to keep her
warm. To have exposed her on the snow-bound summits
would have been a cruel experiment, which might well have
justified the indignation of his father-in-law.

Messrs. METHUEN, “pure comedy from beginning to end.”

call it; tolerable and even amusing with lights and music

be good, it must be very, very good. Otherwise—but perhaps
I had better explain what the search party were after. It is

but the doctor's sweetheart seemed to think his disappearance
at all odd, but at last with great difficulty she persuaded the
M.P.'s wives, and the local Peer (there is always a local Peer
in Irish stories), and the rest of the local constabulary to join
in searching for the missing men. And when they found
them they were all playing leap-frog in their dormitory
prison, M.P.'s, doctor, sergeant, constable and buffoon, and
making no attempt to escape, though they knew that their
captor had got away in his motor-car fourteen hours before.
And the end of the comedy was that they all agreed to say

delightful women, very wise and modern and subtle, hold-
ing broad views upon life, and perhaps just a little too ready
to express them on all occasions, with special emphasis on
topics that must, some years ago, have been left untouched.
In her desire for sincerity the author has at times been (if I
may say so very gently) a little too contemptuous of merer ti-
cence. But, this apart, Happiness remains a notable achieve-
ment in modern fiction, and that sadly rare thing, a novel
that is worth buying to read and keep.
Upon the fifteenth page of The Last Lord Avanley (MILLs
AND BOON) I read, “Then, for the first time, she saw that his
face was not the face of a man, but of a wild b ast, and in
sp te of the pleading look in his large, lustrous eyes, a wave
of revulsion swept through the girl's whole frame.” And
afterwards, at great length, GERALD MAxwell describes
Millicent Tabor's struggle to like this unfortunate being
well enough to marry him. What, however, I feel most
forcibly about the book is the pity that so much labour has
been wasted upon such an un-

haps the least successful effort
is the firs', which deals with a
romantic episode in the grand
old days of Dec. Jun. Brutus
and J. Caesar, just before the
siege of Massilia (705 A.U.G., I
fancy). No doubt Gaulish galley-
slaves had their sentimental pas-

blood money for the solution of the “Mystery of the Manor

I wonder whether, when MAUD STEPNEY RAwson had written
her latest novel, she was a little at a loss what to call it. If
so, she had decidedly a happy thought in giving it the title
it now bears, because Happiness (METHUEN) is a story less of
particular events than of life in general, and compact of
“ a number of things "making for contentment or the reverse.
Naturally, however, this makes the book almost impossible to
describe in detail. I shall content myself with a record of
my personal pleasure in it, and the remark that of the
many characters that crowd a very wide surface I was most
in erested in that of old Telham, the oilcloth millionaire,
whose efforts to win happiness for himself and others meet

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON THE STUMP.
THE news that the House of Lords is
about to tour the country has been
received with great enthusiasm by both
parties. Mr. Punch, however, is afraid
that some of the peers may not live up
to what is expected of them, and he
has, therefore, prepared two or three
examples of the sort of speech that is
wanted. These speeches are not written
for Lord RosebERY's well-tried “Hundred
and Fifty,” but for the great mass of
Tory Peers who have not as yet taken a
prominent part in political affairs. To
those of them who insist on speak-
ing quite sensibly and articulately
Mr. Punch can only express his regret
that they should be willing to shatter
yet another national belief.
I.—For a Dull Duke.
My lords, ladies and—h’m, ha-gen-
tlemen. My — er—ladies and — er—
gentlemen, I have thought it my duty,
ladies and—h'm, ha—gentlemen, to
come before you this evening, or, as I
might say, to-night—to–er—on this
auspicious occasion – h’m, ha. And
when I say “auspicious occasion,”
ladies and gentlemen, I mean that the
occasion has come, has—h'm, ha-in
fact, arrived, when-h’r'r'r'r'm—it is an
auspicious moment to—h'm, ha-come
before you. * *
H'r'r'r'r'm. We are faced,
gentlemen, we are, I say, faced by a
constitutional—h'm, ha—crisis in the
—er—constitution, unprecedented, I say
without fear of --without fear of —of-
contradiction, wrprecedented, ladelmen,
that is, gentlies–hºr'r'r'r'r'm—gentle-
men, in the history of the—-h'm—consti-
tution. That will not be denied. This
constitution, this, I should say, crisis in
the constitution has not been provoked
by Us. We, ladies and gentlemen, in
the exercise of our—h’m, ha—established
right, what I might call—what, h’m, I
think it will not be—er—traversed—tra-
vestied—traversed, as I say, by our
bitterest opponent as our established
right, even by those who—h’m, ha—in
fact by – er—who seek to abolish us.
H'r'r'r'r'r'r'r'r'm. On the one hand we
have this ancient House, of which I have
the honour to-h'm, ha-to form no
inconsid—I should say some inconsid—
to in fact belong, whose hallowed rights
—h’r'r'r'r'm—whose rights, as I have
already—h'm, ha-established are hal-
lowed by the er—by undoubted—er—
h’r'm—by the-er-sanctity of centuries.
That will be admitted. On the other
hand we feel—and it is because I feel
it so strongly, ladies and gentlemen,
that I am among you to-night, in order
to put before you my views on this great
constitutional crisis. H'r'r'r'r'.m.
Our opponents have—h’m, ha-not
hesitated—they have not hesitated, ladies
and gentlemen, to allege that the basest
of motives are inspired, that, I should
say, we owe our inspiration to—that
in fact we are basely inspired by motives
which—h'm, ha-by-er–base motives.
Hºrr'r'r'r'm. To that motive, to that
allege—h'm, ha—allegation I give a
qualified--an unqualified denial. Gen-
tlemen, whatever our motives, and speak-
ing for myself I can claim that I have
been—h'm—actuated by, without any
qualification whatsoever—and when I say
qualification, ladies and—h’m, ha-gen-
tlemen, I do not mean to imply—h’rr'r'm
—but as I say to actuate—the, er, in-
evitable—inevitable consequences—con-
sequences set up by—er—as I have
said, to deny the allegation —h'm, ha
—without qualification of a-a-a-a-tish
—the motives—h’r'r'r'r m—of, in short,
the Budget. (Loud applause.)
II.-For an Irresponsible Earl.
Dear old souls, here we are, all the
whole jolly lot of us, met together in
solemn conclave about this dam rotten
Budget. What price “solemn con-
clave” 2 I thought of that in my little
bath this morning. “Archibald,” I said
to myself as I turned out for sponge
drill, “you’ve stepped right on to it!
“Solemn conclave.’ You're amongst
them, pride of the harem.” What?
Well now, about this dam Budget.
I mean, whose jolly old idea was it?
Give you my word it wasn't mine—
never had any sort of head for figures.
I know at school when they used to ask
me to prove that if two sides of a triangle
were equal then the squares on the
hypothen use were parallel, I always used
to say, “My dear old spot, if Euclid says
it is so, I take his word for it. He's
been in the business longer than I have
and he ought to know more about it.
But of course if dear old Algebra says
it isn't (and he's had his sign up quite
as long as Euclid, I should think), and
you want me to give a casting vote, well
then what I say is, Let's toss for it.
Heads Euclid, tails jolly old Algernon-
bra. Heads! There you are then.”
Yoicks!—gone away. Where were
we? Oh yes, the Budget. Well, I don't
profess to be much of a cheese at geo-
graphy, but I do know what Welshmen
are famous for. “Also ran–Benjamin
Trovato.” What? Keep your eye on me
and don't believe anything that the
six-and-eightpenny in re merchant from
Cambria tells you. “Cambria” is fairly
torrid—I got it from the Harmsworth
Atlas. “Wales, formerly called Cam-
bria”—sort of Polly Jones, née Smith,
don't you know 2
Well, as we were saying, dear old
souls, they passed along the Budget and
we hoofed it out; and nov. I've been
sent down here—and jolly glad I am to
see you all looking so chubby and well
-to tell you why we applied the boot.
Well, why did we? I'll give you two
free guesses. Walk up, ladies and
gentlemen, and try your luck. What,
no entries for the manicure set and
the hem-stitched handkerchief? Look
here, I'm simply giving them away. Oh,
all right then, I'll tell you myself.
We chucked out the Budget, ladies
and gentlemen, because it was a dam
rotten one. (Loud applause.)
III.-For a Backwoods' Baron.
Ladies—and–gentlemen, I have been
asked—to exp'ain to you—why we re-
jected—the Budget. When I was last in
London—in 1893—I helped to reject—
the Home Rule Bill—of the traitor
GLADSTONE. Ladies and gentlemen, I
was proud to have done my duty then—
and I am equally proud—to have done
my duty to-day. There are amongst us
- certain progressive spirits — upon
whom—all true patriots—must act as a
check. My father—opposed—as long
as he could—the introduction of rail-
ways—into this country. His advice—
was in the end—disregarded. When I
travelled up to London—last week—I
felt more than ever—that my father was
right. The country, gentlemen—has |
been spoilt. On my way yesterday--to
the Zoological Gardens—I was disgusted
to learn–that these vandals had bur-
rowed—even under the earth. Coming
back—from the British Museum—last
Monday–-I was horrified to discover–
that trams passed along the Embank-
ment. Had I not been ill—I should
have voted against that measure—as, I
understand—did many of my colleagues
—in the House. At Madame Tussaud's—
two days ago—I looked back—upon all
that has happened—in the last fifty years.
And all the misery—and unhappiness—
that is to be found—in the villages and
towns to-day—must (I decided)—be
put down to—the curse of elementary
education. Ladies and gentlemen, I
say—without hesitation—that the lower
classes—should have been left where
they were—that in raising them you
have raised a monster—worse than any
that Frankenstein brought into being.
Gentlemen, we rejected the Budget
—because it sought to create war
between the classes. England will never
be at peace—unless the classes keep to
their proper stations. The upper class
to rule—and the lower class to obey.
(Loud applause). A. A. M.
“By this process any radicals can in turn be
removed.”
The above appears in IIall and Knight's
Algebra; and since the introduction of
the Budget HALL's letter-bag has had
to be enlarged twice in order to meet
the daily flow of communications asking
for further particulars.

THE GIRAFFE HUNTER.
THE INTREPID TEDDY'S NARRATIVE–WITH A
FEW INTERPOLATIONS.
(Puzzle: Find them.)
EARLY next morning I went back to
camp, and soon after reaching there
again started out for a hunt. . In the
afternoon I came on giraffes and got up
near enough to shoot at them. . But
they are such enormous beasts that I
thought them far nearer than they were:
Too big to live, anyway. My bullet fell
short, and they disappeared among the
mimosas, at their strange, leisurely-
looking gallop. Of all the beasts in an
African landscape none is more striking
than the giraffe, and none more in need
of destruction. Usually it is found in
small parties or in herds of fifteen or
twenty or more individuals. Although
it will drink regularly if occasion offers,
it is able to get along without water for
months at a time, and frequents by
choice the dry plains, or else the stretches
of open forest where the trees are scat-
tered and ordinarily somewhat stunted.
Like the rhinoceros-—the ordinary or
prehensile-lipped rhinoceros—the giraffe
is a browsing and not a grazing animal.
The leaves, buds, and twigs of the
mimosas or thorn-trees form its cus-
tomary food. It never attacks anyone,
being the gentlest creature breathing.
Its extraordinary height enables it to
bring into play to the best possible
advantage its noteworthy powers of
vision, and no animal is harder to
approach unseen. This is, of course,
very unfair to the hunter. Again
and again I have made it out a mile off,
or, rather, have seen it a mile off when
it was pointed out to me, and looking
at it through my glasses would see that
it was gazing steadily at us. It is a
striking-looking animal and handsome
in its way, but its length of leg and
neck and sloping back make it appear
awkward even at rest; and no doubt it
ought to be exterminated. When
alarmed it may go off at a long, swinging
pace or walk, but if really frightened it
strikes into a peculiar gallop or canter
very difficult to keep up with. They
are defenceless things, and, though they
may kick at a man who incautiously
comes within reach, they are in no way
dangerous. This makes them the more
worthy of our soft-nosed bullets. An
ex-President shooting at them runs no
risks.
I was carrying the Winchester loaded
with full metal-patched bullets. I
wished to get for the Museum both a
bull and a cow. One of the three
giraffes was much larger than the other
two, and as he was evidently a bull I
thought the two others were cows. As
we reached the tree the giraffes showed
symptoms of uneasiness. One of the
smaller ones, being a coward, began to
make off, and both the others shifted
their positions slightly, curling their
tails. I instantly dropped on my knee,
and, getting the bead just behind the
big bull's shoulder, I fired with the
300-yard sight. I heard the “pack”
of the bullet as it struck just where I
aimed, and away went all three giraffes
at their queer rocking-horse canter in
the most contemptible way. Running
forward, I emptied my magazine, firing
at the big bull, and also at one of his
smaller companions, and then, slipping
into the barrel what proved to be a soft-
nosed bullet, I fired at the latter again.
The giraffe was going straight away,
and it was a long shot, at 400 or 500
yards, but by good luck the bullet broke
its back, and down it came. No need
to say how pleased I was. I had got
another specimen for the Museum. The
other bulls were now getting over the
crest of the hill, but the big one was
evidently sick, and we called and

beckoned to the two saices to hurry up
with the horses.
I rode full speed after the giant
quarry. I was on the tranquil sorrel,
the horse I much preferred in riding
down game of any kind, because he had
a fair turn of speed, and yet was good
about letting me get on and off. As
Soon as I reached the hill-crest I saw
the giraffes ahead of me, not so far off as
I had feared, and I raced toward them
without regard to rotten ground and
wart-hog holes: one must be reckless
sometimes. The wounded one lagged
behind, but when I got near he pu, on
a spurt, and as I thought I was close
enough I leaped off, throwing the reins
over the sorrel's head, and opened fire.
Down went the big bull, and I thought
my task was done. But as I went back
to mount the sorrel the cad struggled to
his feet again and disappeared after his
companions among the trees, which were
thicker here, as we had reached the
bottom of the valley. So I tore after
him again, and in a minute came to a
dry water-course. Scrambling into and
out of this I saw the giraffes ahead of
me just beginning the ascent of the
opposite slope, and touching the horse
with the spur flew after the wounded
bull. This time I made up my mind I
would get up close enough. Off Ijumped,
throwing the reins over my sorrel's
head, and opened fire once more, and
this time the great bull went down for
good. I had got two of these rare and
steadily disappearing creatures — no
small thing. Unfortunately both were
bulls, so I must go on prayerfully shoot-
ing all I can till a cow turns up.

We understand that the compositor's
reason for placing the full stop here was
that the little box with the commas in
was getting empty. But it seems a pity
to have stopped the sentence just as it
was getting into its stride so nicely.
We ought to add how pleased we are
to see that the dramatic profession
has reached the loftiest rung of the
social ladder, and that its leaders are
now “represented,” just like Monarchs.
This is the true Kingship of Art.
AT THE PLAY.
“BEETHOVEN.”
It would be easy enough to make
merry over the latest of Sir HERBERT
TREE's sporting experiments, but a much
harder matter to appraise it seriously or
even to classify it. It is neither drama
proper nor musical tragedy, but a sort
of series of tableaux parlants with inci-
dental music. The life of BEETHoven
could not well have furnished stuff for
an ordinary play, its chief tragedy being
the deafness which not only cut him off
from human intercourse but, by a cruel
irony, forbade him the physical realisa-
tion of the products of his own art. In
a sense the man is nothing; his music
is everything. But since this was not
to be an opera, and the orchestra was
SYMPHONIES COMPOSED WHILE YOU WAIT.
... Sir HERBERT TREE.
Beethoven ...
bound to play a subordinate part, it was
necessary for the stage action to enforce
the musical element, and this was
achieved by the risky device of pre-
senting the Master from time to time
in the throes of composition—always
a spectacle that threatens to come
perilously near to the ludicrous—with
the orchestra taking it down bar by bar.
Compromises of this kind are not likely,
however well handled, to satisfy either
brand of critic—the dramatic or the
musical.
The First Act introduced us, rather
naively, to most of the known features of
BEETHovex's career. The local atmosphere
might almost have been cut with a knife.
In a series of loosely-connected episodes,
taking place in some Public Gardens
near Vienna, we saw the Master ap-
plauded by his own circle, patronised
by the Court, ridiculed by his bourgeois
brother Nikolaus, attacked by a pre-
monitory spasm of deafness, jilted by a
second-rate lady, and finally improving
the occasion by sketching out, to her
memory, the scheme of a Symphony.
The Second Act was much better.
We had got to know him by now, and
to take the atmosphere for granted.
Here, too, the Master's egoism, the exces-
sive interest he took in himself and
expected every one else to share, seemed
more human and excusable. For the
physical tragedy grows before our eyes,
till, in the midst of a rehearsal, it
culminates on a sudden in a total loss
of the sense which was his very life.
After this, the Third Act, in which
we saw the dying of BEETHowes, was
almost an anticlimax. It was eked out
with certain painful family details which
somehow seemed to miss their ironical
purpose, and rather detracted from the
dignity of the scene. Nor did I care
very greatly for the introduction of the
Nine Symphonies in concrete female
form, with recitations for each—a touch
of artificial phantasy which was rather
worse than the sordid realism which
preceded it. A passage from “The Ode
to Joy,” which followed immediately
upon the musician's death, seemed
rather untimely in its gladness.
Sir HERBERT TREE must be compli-
mented three times over. First for
his make-up, which was marvellous;
secondly for his unusual success in
merging his own personality in that of
his character; thirdly for the art by
which he made us realise the pathos of
that physical infirmity which seldom re-
ceives a fair solace from men's sympathies.
The other parts were negligible. Mr.
EDWARD SASS as Nikolaus had most to
say ; but it was on very obvious lines.
The orchestra, under the clever conduct
of Mr. LANDON RONALD, who made the
selections, all from BEETHoveN, was per-
haps the best feature of the evening. I
am not sure that we should not have had
a better time if the music had gone on
all the while. Sir HERBERT, disguised as
the Master, might have conducted.
A Russian Tragedy, which concluded
the entertainment, was a sort of potted
Tosca. Mr. HENRY AINLEY, who had had
a small and colourless part in Beethoven,
was here himself again as a pallid
Nihilist. Mrs. PATRick CAMPBELL had a
moderate chance that suited her well;
but even her cleverness could not lend
plausibility to the fatuous “confidence
trick " by which the Governor of Pe-
trovolsk allowed himself to be tied up
for slaughter in the chains of his own
prisoners. A few gallery hisses of a
sympathetic character followed the fall
of the curtain, but whether intended for
the Governor, or his system, or a Tsar
whose portrait on the wall was the con-
stant recipient of loyal salutes, I am not
prepared to say.

THE SMALLEST MONSTER ON RECORD.
4 -
WITH reference to the “monster” demonstration of out-
raged Britons which occurred near the House of Lords
last Thursday, some uncertainty as to the exact numbers
will have been noticed in the daily press. The Daily News
says there were 9,000 present, The Daily Chronicle 5,000,
and The Morning Leader “about two or three thousand.”
The last-named journal should do better than this if it wants
to get on ; but meanwhile we follow our habitual practice
with regard to Radical demonstrations, and accept the
smallest figures admitted by any Radical paper.
Unless the People's indignation shows a marked improve-
ment, instead of a monster procession to Hyde Park, pro-
testing citizens will probably be invited to make their way
to the more suitable surroundings of the Eustace Miles
Restaurant.
There is a strong feeling in certain quarters that the
authorities should now recognise that demonstrations are a
necessary medium for the expression of opinion, and should
make proper provision for them. It is suggested that Parlia-
ment Square should be reduced in size by building exten-
sions to render it more cosy for these monster displays. In
cold weather the draughts are most uncomfortable, if you
are not properly crowded. It is also held that the police #
told off for duty at demonstrations should not be of the
ordinary kind that push one about and actually walk their
horses on the pavements, but should be picked men of mild
physique. - -

THE'SCARE-HEAD DIALECT.
JUDGING from the sensational contents-bills of the news-
papers and the hysterical head-lines of some of their leading:
articles, it would appear that the resources of the English
language are likely to be a little strained during the course,
of the impending electioneering contest. Lest any foreigners.
or simple-minded folk should be led astray through being
unable to discount the perfervid expressions of party phrase-
mongers, it seems advisable to subjoin a short vocabulary of
political idioms with their current interpretations :- -

possibly the worst) of a verbal

My dear Sir, I am almost
inclined to question the va-
lidity of your somewhat sweep-
ing assertion.
No doubt many similar flowers of speech will crop up and
wither during the next few weeks, or, as our political stylists
would put it, the full-fledged upas-tree of blighting metaphor
will deafen the open-mouthed electors with the Malebolge of
party invective. We can only hope that Truth will be
stronger than Faction, and wish ourselves a speedy issue
out of all our exacerbation.

everything but talk.
Dr. NAPIER, M.P., in The Daily News:–
“500 Liberals could be easily found who would esteem it an honour to

prise. Had heard of disproportionate
forces in rival camps. Prepared to see
Ministerial benches a wilderness, faced
by crowded Opposition seats. And lo!
there was not a vacant place on benches
to right of Woolsack. Above the Gang-

Below, a cluster of white-robed Bishops

For the Backwoodsmen, brought up at a

Nay, so thoroughly imbued were noble

before you go by one of England's greatest poets—Bromley-Davenport.”
CREwe played his part admirably, and
with pretty air of surprise heard
LANSDowne in what was the only acrid
passage in his speech denounce and
deride the procedure.
Quite in order after LEADER OF
Opposition had fired first gun that
Ministers should make response. Knew
where they were now. War openly
declared against dominant position of
Commons in relation to Budget. By one
of those fortunate accidents that occasion-
ally mark Parliamentary manoeuvring,
LoRD CHANCELLOR had brought down
with him a few notes suitable for
reply to LANSDowne's speech. These he
produced, and expanded them in mode-
rately brief discourse listened to with
breathless interest by assembly that
thronged a chamber usually half empty.
Odd to note, with full knowledge of
all the scene imported, that there was
almost total absence of demonstration of
feeling. Had the Commons been about
the business, storm of cheers and counter-
cheers would have interrupted and in-
flamed successive speakers. The rising
of LANSDOWNE, with a multitudinous
majority at his back, was greeted by
perfunctory cheer. His best points were
hailed with grudging approbation.
LORD CHANCELLOR for most part spoke in
equally chilling atmosphere. Only once
was there sharp cheer from the Liberals
leavening the lump of Backwoodsmen
invading their territory. It rose when
he read from his notes the evidently
well-weighed words: “It is impossible
that any Liberal Government should
ever again bear the heavy burden of

repetition of treatment such as our

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PROVINCIAL EDITOR'S LETTER BAC.
I.--From the Vicar.
DEAR SIR,--I have read the account in
the current number of The Gazette of
the opening of the new parish hall,
and am pained and surprised to find
how many excisions have been made.
Surely, when one who is in a position to
know everything and has some literary
skill goes to the trouble to provide you
with free copy, it is at once inexpe-
dient and ungracious to abbreviate and
distort.
That my own remarks on the platform
should be cut short is nothing to me;
but I think it very hard that the
admirable little speech of our Squire,
who had it typed expressly for me (and
for you) and altered his dinner-hour in
order to come down and deliver it,
should have been so heartlessly con-
densed. He spoke for at least ten
minutes; but all that you allow him to
have said might have been spoken in
two. This is more to be deplored than
you may think, for Mr. Bamber-Guy
stands to Boreham Green in the relation
of wealthy parent, and it is in his power
to make or mar the parish room. It
would not in the least surprise me to
hear that your cavalier treatment of his
address has caused him to reduce his
donations. Of Miss Pulham-Allways'
singing I said, according to the dupli-
cate copy of my MS. before me, “Her
voice is both pure and resonant, and she
rendered the aria with faultless pre-
cision and taste.” I did not write this
idly. The words expressed my deliberate
opinion, based upon a careful study of
music that has lasted many years. More-
over, Mrs. Pulham-Allways was seated
next to me and was aware not only of my
appreciation of her daughter's efforts but
also that I was for the time being your
representative. What, then, do I feel—
and what must she feel—to read in your
paper the bald statement that “Miss
Pullham-Allways contributed a pleasing
solo” 2 - -
It was with perfect cognisance of what
I was doing that I inserted the name
of the maker of the excellent bagatelle
board; but your ruthless pen goes
through it without a thought. I am not
one—as you ought to know—who does
things without a reason. If ever a
man has worn himself to the bone in a
good cause and for no possible reward
save the knowledge that he has done
his duty, it is Mr. Pykelet, my curate.
How natural and proper, then, that I
should single him out for praise ? But
what do you do? You merely group
him with half-a-dozen ordinary villagers
who may have lent a hand to move a
table, or done something purely per-
functory, and say that they were “a
willing band.”
So much for sins of omission, but
what of those of commission? Here we
are on more serious ground. It is all
very well, owing to exigencies of space,
to condense a contribution, but it is a
very different and graver thing to twist
and change a contributor's meaning.
This you have done more than once.
I wrote, for instance, very thought-
fully of Miss Larcom's voice, that
no doubt with practice it would greatly
improve and be a pleasure to listen to.
But what do I read in your report?—
“Miss Larcom aroused great and well-
deserved enthusiasm by her charming
morceaua.” How do you know that?
You have no right to go behind the
back of your accredited critic. Can it, I
wonder, be true that Miss Larcom is
engaged to your advertising canvasser,
as I am told is the case? If so we
have a very reprehensible suggestion of
nepotism at work.
Again, I find that you say of Mr.
Harry Wildmarsh's recitation that it
was “received with roars of laughter.”
That, I regret to say, is true; but what
you do not print is my opinion as to its
extreme vulgarity and undesirability.
I notice that you also say that Mr.
Arthur Corney had done “yeoman's
service in bringing the evening to a
successful issue.” I am aware of no
yeoman's or other particular service on
the part of Mr. Corney. You doubtless
have private reasons of your own, but
allow me to reiterate the opinion that in
such a matter as this the Vicar is more
likely to be well informed of the relative
value of each helper than you can
possibly be.
No doubt you will reply that a column
and a half is long measure for a parochial
event of the kind; but permit me to
inform you that this is not so. The
opening of a parish room is epoch-
making. Men who hitherto have been
in the habit of spending their evenings
in the public-house will now congregate
here in blameless pursuits, and nothing
but good can follow. A new civic life
will thus be set up, a sociability hitherto
unknown in Boreham Green. Indirectly,
if not directly, the very Empire must be
the gainer. •
I shall peruse with interest any reply
that you care to send, and meanwhile I
trust that some means will be found
to do justice, if not to Miss Pulham-
Allways, at least to Mr. Pykelet, in your
next issue. Yours faithfully,
GERALD AMBERLEIGH.

MOMENTOUS MEMORIES.
IN view of the intense interest attach-
ing to personal reminiscences of poets,
we are sure that the following report of
the charming address delivered by the
Hon. Amanda Guppy at the last meet-
ing of the Tupper Elocution Society will
be perused with rapt attention by our
readers:– -
“I knew MATTHEW ARNOLD quite well
by sight, and on one occasion, as I was
going to pay a visit at the house of a
friend, passed him on the stairs. I
remember that he wore a frock-coat and
carried a silk hat in his left hand and
an umbrella in the right. His was,
indeed, a striking personality.
It was one of my dearest ambitions to
meet BROWNING, and it was gratified a
few years before the death of the great
poet and thinker, when I sat next but
three to him at a luncheon party given
by Lady Löwenjäger in her charming
bijou residence in Bayswater. I noticed
that BROWNING wore a turned-down
collar and declined pepper with his
vegetables. . After lunch I think he
smoked a cigarette, but it may have
been a cigar. I cannot be certain
whether he partook of coffee or not, but
his general bearing was certainly most
affable.
I also knew ELIZA Cook's second
cousin quite well, a sturdy and interest-
ing personality, who thought nothing of
running upstairs two steps at a time
when he was over fifty. But curiously
enough he did not care for the poetry of
his distinguished relation, preferring
that of MARTIN TUPPER. By a strange
coincidence my first nurse's name was
Martha Tupper, and to this circumstance
I am inclined to trace my life-long
preference of blank to rhymed verse.
In this context I may mention that my
grandfather once saw BLANCO WHITE at
Liverpool, coming out of a grocer's
shop.
EDWARD FITZGERALD, alas! I never saw,
though I have read all that Mr. SHORTER
has written about him with the utmost
avidity and pleasure. How great is the
debt which we owe to the generous
enthusiasm of that industrious book-
man' But once when I was quite a
tiny girl, while staying with some
friends on the coast of Suffolk, we went
for a sail in a boat which was handled
by mone other than a man who knew
the famous Posh, FITZGERALD's trusty
nautical ally.
Of living poets one must speak with
due reticence, but I hope I am not trans-
gressing the bounds of literary etiquette
when I say that I once took part in
a spelling bee with Mr. Whitworth
WYNNE, and was present at a meeting of
the Primrose League when Mr. ALFRED
AUSTIN was among the audience.”

Youh BuTT, is IT considenEd correct to RETURN His FIRE 2
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF the author of Elizabeth and Her German Garden has
drawn the protagonist of her latest story, The Caravaners
(SMITH, ELDER), from life, I can only hope, in the cause of
international amity, that the original of Baron Otto von
0.tringel will never be confronted with his portrait. Per-
haps, however, his self-complacency would even then blind
him to the truth; but I am sure he would not enjoy the
book half so much as I did. It is an account of a holiday
tour in vans, taken by some delightful English and German
friends, who have rashly extended an invitation to Baron
and Baroness von Ottringel to leave Storchwerder in Prussia
and join their company. The result is disaster; for though
the rains of our unhappy summer are unable to quench the
courage of the voyagers the society of the Baron (who is at
once a bully, a snob and a fool) proves so appalling that
terror of it breaks up the party within a week. I think it
was DICKENs (or was it Mr. CHESTERTON ?) who once com-
mented upon the difficulty of making an unpleasant cha-
racter reveal itself naturally in the first person. The author
of The Caravaners has managed this with wonderful success,
for, though Baron Otto describes the tour from his own point
of view, we see him throughout—his conceit, his selfishness,
and, worse than all, his quite terrible idea of humour—as he
must have appeared to his disgusted fellow-travellers. It is
| this character drawing, and the gradual revolt, amid English
associations, of the down-trodden Baroness Edelgard, that
make The Caravaners one of the cleverest and most
amusing stories of the year.
Next, perhaps, to Lord EDWARD FitzGERALD, the romance of
revolutionary times in Ireland clings most fondly round
Robert EMMET. To this result the pathetic song written by
Tom MooRE doubtless largely contributed. His story is a sad
one, painful for an Irishman to write, pitiful for Irishmen to
read. It reveals the passionate patriot giving up fortune,
life, and what was dearer to him, love, to the task of freeing
his country from a hated yoke, baffled by the incompetency
of one section of his compatriots, betrayed by another.
There are some authorities who believe that, save for these
malign influences, EMMET's rebellion of 1803 would, at least
at the outset, have succeeded. Between knaves and fools it
came to the ground, and he to the scaffold. The condition
of his little force on the eve of the rebellion recalls our
unreadiness on the outbreak of the Boer War. There were
no guns ready. There were hand-grenades but no matches,
and at a critical moment means of transport failed. Worse
still was the atrocious treachery of EMMET's countrymen.
One to whom he handed sixty guineas, to buy guns withal,
bolted with the money. Another, entrusted with a packet of
letters, which, falling into the hands of the prison authorities,
would compromise EMMET's fiancée, handed them to the
Governor. A third secretly sold him to the Government for a
thousand pieces of gold. These things Mr. STEPHEN Gwyn N
tells in the form of a romance—Robert Emmet (MACMILLAN).
It is a class of narrative somewhat risky. The reader is, in
an ordinary way, disturbed by doubt where fact finishes and
fiction begins. Mr. Gwynn was fortunate in finding romance
prepared for him, and, closely following it, produces a book
of unfailing interest. But if I were an Irishman I should
not select EMMET and his times as a topic of conversation,
and should certainly not write of them.

PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Irish atmosphere and scenic effects of KATHARINE
TYNAN's new stories are of course unexceptionable, but one is
led to expect a rather more bracing lot of incidents and less
conventional situations than she provides. In Cousins and
Others (WERNER LAURIE), the first story, which occupies a
third of the book, relies on that very ancient device, the
discovery of a document which proves that the impoverished
but aristocratic family (A) is really the owner of the acres
occupied by the comparative partenus (B), the beautiful
daughter in A having previously engaged the affections of
the handsome son in B, though B objects to the alliance. A
lunatic is also brought into play in order to show that the
hero, with whom we haven't had time to get acquainted, is
worthy of his valuable prize. In another story a timely
young man delivers from a burglar the lady with whom he
has quarrelled at a ball; and in a third the sole complication
is the dressing up of a girl as a boy. One doesn't like to fall
out with one's cousins, especially when, as here, their sur-
roundings are so delightful; but until the CHANCELLOR of THE
Exchequer sees fit to tax literary plots for their hidden gold
or artistic designs I shall
something else which may seem to be more important.
Briefly, it tells the tale of a Dutch peasant boy, a born
artist, who, while his soul prompts him to paint his native
landscapes, yet deliberately seeks and achieves success at
portraiture. This comes about through the treachery of his
first patron, Odo Pareys, who, taking advantage of the boy's
sense of gratitude, steals his landscape sketches, passes them
off as his own, and wins with them the praises of the art
world. Mr. MAARTENs draws his hero, Lis Doris, and those
with whom he moves, with a vividness which, in spite of the
evidence of his former books, is a revelation. Of the many
characters, Odo Pareys and his servant Job are, in my
opinion, the least convincing, possibly because they are too
cruel. They may be lifelike, though I prefer to think that
they are the remnants of Mr. MAARTEN's earlier tendency to
be hard on his own people. Of that tendency there is not
very much trace in this book. There are unpleasant persons
besides Odo and Job, but there are many more pleasant ones.
Lis Doris himself is admirable. Yeta, who marries Odo to
get the means to assist Lis, is a very sweet being; and
- Jacob Raff, the Loksters,
continue to hope for some-
thing better in short stories
than the ordinary standard
of the magazine. Perhaps
the writer has some more
interesting second cousins
up her sleeve.
Western civilization is
apt to attach too much
importance to death, but
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT knows
better. In The Glimpse
(CHAPMAN AND HALL) he
treats of death as an event
no more final, as far as
the soul is concerned,
than the extraction of a
tooth. His Morrice Loring
is an aesthete with a fine
contempt for humanity and
the universe in general.
Believing that only the
minority possesses a soul
and that the souls of the elect
are poor and ephemeral -
things at the best, he lives in a world of disillusion and
sordid circumstance. He dies and comes to life again, and in
the realisation of his own death he learns the relative values
of the mortal body and the immortal soul. Henceforth he
can perceive the spirit in the most unlikely human envelope
(your most stolid parlour-maid not excepted) and is able
later to regard the passing of his dearest one less as an end
of things pleasant than as a beginning of things beautiful.
The author has expounded his philosophy in a subtle and
engrossing story, but has erred in interrupting the narrative
and weakening the exposition by the insertion of a too full
description of the soul's release from the body. He should
have credited his readers with some imagination and have
omitted half his mass of very earthly precision and most
mundane superlatives. Otherwise he has written a novel
very readable and comfortable to those who have seen or
feared death.

There are people to whom a new book by Mr. MAARTEN
MAARTENS is an event. I am one of them, and The Price of Lis
Doris (METHUEN) would convince me, if I needed convincing,
that this is as it should be. The story is not merely worth
reading for the pleasure of it; it is worth the putting off of

(DECEMBER 8, 1909.
A STRAIGHT ISSUE.
THE peculiar interest which is being taken in the forth-
coming General Election has encouraged Mr. Punch to send
round the country a Special Referendum Commissioner with
the view of eliciting answers from the electorate to the plain
question—Are you going to vote for, or against, the Budget 2
and, if so, why? From the replies so far received he has
selected at random a few specimens for publication. They
prove how thoroughly the British Public recognises that for
once it has before it a simple, clear and straightforward
ISSule.
I.—Why I SHALL vote FOR THE BUDGET.
1. Because I'm against the Lords for having let so many
rotten Bills pass. They want reforming.
2. Because I disapprove of the Budget, but disapprove of
my wife still more, she being a Militant Suffragette, and I
want to annoy her.
3. Because, though I regard the Super-tax as iniquitous, I
have my hopes of being made a Liberal Peer. [Private and
confidential.] -
4. Because, though the Budget knocks me hard, it knocks
my neighbour harder still.
5. Because I’ve tossed up and it came like that.
6. Because Tariff Reform “means work for all,” and I
don't want to change the habits of a lifetime. [“Weary
Willie.”]
7. Because, though the Budget does not actually mention
|. I am in favour of Welsh Disestablishment and Home
ule.
8. Because I can't get that Chinese Slavery poster out of
my head.
9. Because I hear rumours of ASQUITH's retirement, and
I'm an old man and don't want to miss the fun of seeing
LLOYD GEORGE and WINSTON fighting over the spoils.
10. Because Beer doesn't agree with me.
11. Because Tobacco makes me sick.
12. Because I have a cure of souls in the neighbourhood
of York, where the Archbishop comes from, and he voted for
the Budget.
13. Because I consider the Liberal Government much
more revolutionary than the Lords, and I love revolutions.
[“Red-cap.”]
14. Because, though I don't myself think the Budget a
good one, I have the most tremendous faith in Mr. URE's
passion for Truth. If he says it is so, then it is so.
15. Because all my poor relations in Ireland have an old-
age pension a-piece, and not one of them over 55 years of age.
16. Because I want to get the Anglo-German War over as
soon as possible, and then we can all settle down comfortably.
17. Because down Limehouse way we look on LLoyd
GEORGE as one of us.
18. Because our Tory Member didn't ask me to his last
garden-party.
19. Because a man's a man for a that.
20. Because I'm in favour of a Single Chamber.
21. Because I voted Tory last time, and I’m a pendulum.
22. Because my chauffeur is a naturalised anarchist and I
dare not neutralise his vote.
23. Because I love all foreign nations and would hate to
see 'em taxed for our benefit. I call it a beastly selfish
policy.
24. Because Mr. Punch is obviously against the Budget,
and, though I am also against it, I consider that he ought to
be impartial.
II.--Why I SHALL vote AGAINST THE BUDGET.
1. Because Mr. Punch is obviously in favour of the Budget,
and, though I am also in favour of it, I consider that he
ought to be impartial.
2. Because I have a living in the diocese of Bristol, and
my Bishop voted against the Budget.
3. Because, though I thoroughly approve of the Budget,
my wife is a Militant Suffragette, and it is as much as my
place is worth to go against her.
4. Because, after I'd subscribed a lot to the Party Funds,
Asquith refused to make me a Bart.
5. Because my Liberal paper seems to be taking Lord
RosBBERY under its protection, and I always make a point of
disapproving of him ever since he won the Derby.
6. Because, if they had had the pluck of a rabbit, the
Liberals would have gone for the Lords long ago.
7. Because I am a member of the I.L.P., and we made
this Budget, and LLoyd GEORGE annexed it without proper
acknowledgment, and so I shall vote against him just for
spite.
8. Because of the filthy weather we’ve been having under
this accursed Government. .
9. Because, though I am very fond of the Budget, I shall
support the Lords for having consulted my views in the
matter. - -
10. Because I'm a PERKs man.
11. Because I'm told that the Lords have “thrown the
Constitution into the melting-pot,” and this interests me very
much, being a plumber. -
12. Because our Liberal Member buys his meat at the
other butcher's.
13. Because I have eleven daughters of uncertain age and
the Budget puts no tax on bachelors.
14. Because I tossed up and it came like that.
15. Because, though the Budget suits me nicely, my wiſe
thinks it best for us to be on the side of the Aristocracy.
16. Because, being an intelligent Liberal, I can't stand
the hysterics of The Daily Chronicle.
17. Because I’m bored to death with all this bunkum
about Backwoodsmen. As if the regular Unionist Peers
wouldn't have had a thumping majority without them.
18. Because I voted Liberal last time, and I'm a pendulum.
19. Because the Budget puts no export duty on Wax
Busts.
20. Because my Liberal organ says that “the Lords have
declared war on the People,” and, though I know it isn't
true, I rather respect them for it, being a bit of a bull-dog
myself.
21. Because, man for man, in point of statesmanship,
| intelligence, and knowledge of affairs, the pick of the Peers
are as good, any day, as the pick of the Commons, notwith-
standing their hereditary disadvantages.
22. Because my chauffeur is an admirer of Mr. BALFour's
philosophic works, and I dare not neutralize his vote.
23. Because I am a plural voter, and the Liberal party, to
which I belong, thinks I ought not to use more than one vote.
So I shall just vote once for the Budget, and five times
against it.
24. Because on principle I disapprove of all Budgets.

WHAT TO DO WITH THE CRYSTAL
PALACE,
VARIOUS suggestions, have already
been made with regard to the future
of the great Sydenham glasshouse, one
of the most remarkable being that
which recommends its conversion into
a great aeronautic centre.
In old days, when a great man had
rendered conspicuous services to his
country, his grateful compatriots were
in the habit of rewarding him by the
gift of an estate as well as of a title.
This is a generous practice which
might well be revived, and assuredly
there never was a greater abundance
of eligible tenants for glasshouses.
Already we understand that a move-
ment is on foot for acknowledging the
unsparing and long-continued exertions
of the LORD Advocate on behalf of
social reform. Mr. ANTHONY HoPE, we
are informed, has decided to lay the
scene of his next and most extravagant
excursion into the realm of fiction in
the Kingdom of Uritania, and the in-
habitants of the canton of Uri–the
scene of the exploits of the heroic TELL
—are about to send a deputation to
congratulate their eponymous hero on
his magnificent assertion of the rights
of the democracy against their ducal
oppressors.
It would, we venture to submit, form
a fitting culmination to these graceful
tributes if the Crystal Palace were pre-
sented to Mr. URE as a residence
and recreation ground for that great
hierophant of the Higher Political
Criticism. The Palace, with a little
adaptation, would form a home stately
enough to answer the requirements even
of so august an occupant, and the
grounds might be laid out as a golf
course abounding in sporting hazards
and presenting every variety of lie.

LETTERS TO A MARTIAN.
MY DEAR SIR,--I quite agree with you that there is in the
whole universe no more distasteful and wearisome job than
that of canal-building. Still, as you say, one must live, and
if you don't build canals you will die for want of moisture—
a dreadful fate from which our happy climate in the mean-
time exempts us. It is good of you to suggest that I should
cheer your short periods of leisure by my letters. I’ll do my
best—no man can do more—but I ought to warn you that
we're not always so gay and irresponsible as you seem to
think us. We have Budgets and constitutional controversies
and riots about female suffrage, and discussions, not easily
settled, about the hundred worst books; and there are gloomy
and depressing dramas and many thousands of political
speeches; and Dr. BoDE, of the Berlin Museum, threatens us
with war because the late Mr. R. C. LUCAs, a sculptor, in-
serted two square feet of British bed-quilt in a wax bust
which he modelled son:e — — —- -
sixty years ago with the
plain and dastardly inten-
tion of deceiving German
connoisseurs into the belief
that LEONARDO DA VINCI had
had a hand—possibly two
hands—in its manufacture.
All these matters afflict us
strangely, so that we might
occasionally come to look
upon canal-building as an
agreeable dissipation; but,
when all is said and done,
we do manage to have our
lighter moments.
I wonder if I might tell
you something about
women 2 You've heard
about them, of course, those
stern, logical, silent directors
of our welfare. When the ,
French, more than a hun- -
dred years ago, wanted to
embody the abstract idea of THE vogue
Reason, they naturally chose

danced and shouted round —
her, calling her a goddess. What else could they have done?
I mention this little historical incident merely to show you
with what awe and respect we encompass the sex, and how
worshipfully we treat it. Bless you, my dear Sir, we men
know our own wretched qualities well enough. We strive in
vain to better them, and of course we never fail to recognise
how immeasurably those qualities are bettered by the com-
panionship and example of women.
Have you ever seen two or three women at tea together
and endeavouring to say good-bye and to part from one
another? No, of course you haven't—it was an idle question.
I'll wager that when your people have seen enough of one
another you just shake hands or rub noses or execute a
gambade (pardon me if I misdescribe your valedictory
symptoms), and so make an end quickly and separate.
That's how we do it, too, we men, I mean; but if you think
that’s how the women do it, you're very much mistaken.
Let me try to give you a specimen in brief.
You are to imagine, them, that four ladies have come
together for the sole purpose of settling the date and the
agenda for the annual meeting of the Women's Clothing
Guild, a parochial institution of the committee of which they
are members. They have been having tea, for the afternoon
is well advanced, and they have been discussing almost every
subject except the particular one that brought them together.
A mere man, a transient embarrassed phantom, has flitted
uneasily across the scene, but he has now vanished on the
plea of work or letters, and the ladies have the drawing-room
to themselves:–
Hostess. I never saw anything like it before. Diamonds,
you know, about half-a-dozen of them, in the middle of the
day, and a great blazing ruby thing dangling from her neck.
She really is, you know, isn't she?
First Guest. Yes, she is. You've hit her off exactly.
That woman's a public scandal—No more tea, thank you.
Well then, just the teeniest half cup : one lump-and the
extraordinary thing is that all the men run after her. I've
told John that, if I see him so much as nod to her, I’ll put
him on half rations. She's like a woman I read about in a
book the other day called Love the Wayfarer. Now that's
a book if you like.
- -----------— Second Guest. Isn’t it ! I
think the Vicar's wife — I
forget her name—is just a
perfectly splendid character:
family prayers twice a day
and ten children to bring up
on £300 a year. It's too
touching for anything.
Third Guest. I don't care
for these very good people
in books myself. And, by
the way — though I can't
imagine what put me in
mind of her — has anybody
seen Mrs. Porter lately?
The Hostess. Well, you
can't help seeing her hat,
anyhow. It's the most
awful hat in the world.
Third Guest. My dear, if
she were only half as re-
spectable as her hat I
shouldn't have anything to
say. Haven't you heard
about her?
The Rest (in chorus). No,
do tell us!
[I omit, the details of
- - Mrs. Porter's career.
The Hostess. I always knew there was something wrong
about that woman.
The Rest (together). So did I.
|At this point the guests, and lastly the hostess, rise in a
slow and lingering succession and then stand still
aimlessly.
First Guest. Well, I'm afraid I shall have to be going
now. It's John's time for getting home, and——
Second Guest. My dear, I always told you you spoilt that
º You never get anything out of a man if you pamper

Third Guest. I must get home too. I'm really much too
late already.

from the life. Some day I may give you one or two more.
Yours in space, AN EARTH-WoRM.
, THE DARK SIDE OF THE DRAMA.
[“We ask why we, alone among British subjects, are to be allowed
to exercise our profession only on the impossible condition that we hurt
nobody's feelings.”—Ertract from letter to the Press on the Censorship
Committee's recommendations, signed by the Dramatic Committee of the
Society of Authors.] -
You who would envy the dramatist's lot
Cherish this feeling no more, but dispel it on
Being informed that his cupboard has got
Quite an unusual skeleton.
Mark him as, flushed with success, or perhaps
Wearing excitement's peculiar pallor, he
Stammers his thanks for the cheers and the claps
Lavished by stalls and by gallery.
Seeing him thus, you'd suppose he enjoyed
Life with an almost unvarying cheeriness;
Yet with one grief is his pleasure alloyed,
Turning his triumph to weariness.
Others have licence to utter their mind,
Wielding a pen that is ruthlessly critical;
Now and again to say something unkind
Even of leaders political;
He, he alone, in this land of the free,
Forced to compose with meticulous nicety,
Wishing, like Balaam, to curse, must agree
Meekly to say Benedicite!
Is he just itching to serve it up hot?
Yet, like a parasite born or a cringer bred,
He must “hurt nobody's feelings—” that's what
Takes all the gilt off the gingerbread.
Couched upon roses, he feels but the thorns.
Must, then, his tongue never show its uncivil edge?
Must he alone spare his fellow-man's corns?
Dramatists, strike for your privilege'

A contemporary quotes the following from Life:—
“It may be all right for a man to wear padded shoulders, if he
doesn't forget, and pick a quarrel with a man who was born that way.”
But are men born with padded shoulders? “Nascitur non
fit,” says the poet.
“There was no money in the safe, and the burglars had to retire
bootless.”—Daily Record.
The necessity for removing the footwear before retiring will
be explained in our next instalment.

BOOKS FOR THE BILLION.
A BULKY OUTPUTTER.
(Special.)
SoME years ago one of Mr. A. Leveson
Tiles's admirers made an interesting
calculation as to the bulk of his output
and the measurement of paper and
ink used in its production. The figures
relating to one series alone were truly
momentous. It was found that if these
volumes were placed flat one upon
another they would form a monument
nearly one thousand times the height of
Greeba Castle, the loftiest private house
in the world ; that the paper used in
their production, if made into big sheets,
would suffice to wrap up the Himalayas,
the Andes and the Cordilleras in separate
parcels; and that the printer's ink em-
ployed would suffice to fill the Caspian
Sea ten times over.
Since that day more than three hun-
dred new books have emanated from
the prolific pen of Mr. Tiles, and at the
present day there are nearly one hundred
pages in the British Museum Catalogue
filled with entries under his name.
Messrs. Mark Marmion & Co., Mr.
Tiles's present publishers, are now
issuing a New Series of Glory Books
for Boys and Girls.

BALLADs of BRAVE BANTLINGs.-Edited
by Albert Leveson Tiles. Large crown

Ballads of Brace Bantlings is a fear-
less budget of poems suitable for reci-
tation in kindergartens, crèches, &c.,
while the binding renders it peculiarly
well adapted for all gatherings of a festive
and yappy character. It aims at cele-
brating the intrepidity of infants as
shown in the pages of history, on the
field of battle, in the fight for the
franchise, the cause of freedom and the
service of humanity.
“There is no better volume of reci-
tations with chits and counterchits for
their theme.”—MR. WILLIAM DE MoRGAN.
“Ballads of Brave Bantlings has con-
verted me to Baby suffrage.”—MR. JAMEs
Dougi.A.S.
“I estimate that if you sell twenty
million copies of your new book, your
output will then exceed that of the
authoress of East Lynne.”—THE EDITOR
of The Statist.
“Mr. Leveson Tiles is the finest out-
putter in existence.”—Golf Illustrated.
“The prolificacy of Mr. Tiles is truly
magnificent. Frankly, he is the Lope

task of exactly meeting the crying need
for good, witty, sparkling but withal
refined pabulum for the mind of the
ingenuous youth.”—CouxTESS SCHLick.

“To describe the new house one feels the
need of the advertising agent, but to say that
the window frontage is a vision of loveliness to
the woman of any and every grade of society
is to speak with only meagre justice.”—The
Westminster Gazette.
But what need of an advertising agent
when articles like this (in praise of a
certain shop) appear in the news
columns? And, by the way, isn't this
what Mr. GEORGE EDWARDEs wanted 2
“He holds a record for the bow and arrow,
having at the national meeting in France, to
the amazement of the assembled archers shot
an arrow thirty-six yards—no less than twenty-
seven yards furth r than the longest shot ever
known to have been made by an Englishman.”
Ideas.
We can but faintly imagine the scene.
The orgy of enthusiasm which celebrated
the occasion of the previous record of
nine yards must have been completely
outdone.
“Wasn't it Macaulay who wrote:—
Lives there a man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
Returning from some foreign strand :
‘This is my own, my native land?’”
So ends the patriotic and impressive
outburst (several pages long) of a South
African tradesman who wants to get an
air rifle off his hands. The answer is
* { No.”
Advertisement of a vacancy for a
teacher:
“The post is resident and the salary offered
from £40 (FoRTY Pounds) per annum, with
Laundry expe ses according to qualificatio...s
and experience of a candidate.”
B.A.'s are allowed as much as three
collars a week.
“Wanted an instructor or instructress capa-
ble of teaching the English language without
impoverishing it with the usual solecisms and
unintelligible jumble of French words. No
English need apply. Germans preferred.”
Advt. in French paper.
Another ruined industry.
NEW BUD(HET PROPOSALS.
THERE is not a man in this country,
excepting such as are happily penniless,
who is not sick and tired of Budgets.
It is not that people object to pay; the
trouble is caused by the Government
choosing how and when payment shall
be made, instead of leaving it to the
discretion of the individual. - -
Why should not the country be
financed by voluntary contributions 2
Everybody would then be happy: the
man who did not care to pay on beer
and tobacco could pay on what he liked
—or, rather, on what he didn't like—and
the black stain of income-tax perjury
would be removed for ever from the
country's escutcheon, if there is such a
thing.
In the front of every house a securely
locked money-box should be fixed. Any
householder or lodger or other responsi-
ble citizen not contributing to the box
with decent frequency would, of course,
be liable to criticism by his neighbours.
Indeed, public opinion would quickly
make the frequent insertion of coin in
this box one of the conventions of our
land.
The boxes would be cleared periodi-
cally by officials who would come round
in broad daylight and make no attempt
to conceal the contents from the in-
quiring gaze of the onlookers. Special
provision might be arranged for reporters
and press photographers on clearing
days.
It stands to reason that any man, in
the occasional moments of unusual joy
that come to the average person—such
as a discovery that the gas-meter has
been registering to the detriment of the
company—would be more inclined to
rush out to his Budget box and slip in
a shilling, out of sheer gratitude, than ||
to work out the figures on his tax paper
and (failing to make them wrong) write
a cheque in cold blood.
Sufficient guarantee that the funds
forthcoming would be adequate surely
lies in the oft-repeated assertion of the
tax-payer that he does not mind paying
his share towards the nation's expenses,
provided he can pay in the way he likes :
best. i
Finally, it must be remembered that
this is supposed to be a free country,
where even the notion of compulsory
Service in defence of our homes sends a
cold shudder down the backs of the
Sons of Liberty. Why not be con-
sistent, and bring both taxes and rates
into line with the admirable voluntary
system which makes our Army what
it is 2

avoid Australia.”—Beira Post.
He will have to be careful, though.

SCORN NOT THE BARD.
ScoRN not the bard. There is a folk
That treats him as a kind of joke,
A weak and tepid card,
The strong man's mocking and a shame;
He may be that, but, all the same,
Scorn not the bard.
The flowing mane that you resent
Is there for use, not ornament,
To help him in his song;
When gravelled in his dire employ,
A handy tress wherewith to toy
Gets him along.
His taste for turning things about
And wrong way on and inside out,
Is not to be denied;
An irritating trick, I grant;
But, as to helping it, he can't!
You've never tried.
It is the painful truth that he
Is prone to warble of the sea,
And overapt to cling
For ever to some hackneyed tune
Of ladies' eyebrows and the Moon,
Of Love, and Spring.
But, tho' his scheme is bound to pall,
Let us be candid. After all,
This is no fault of his;
However hard it be to stand,
The man must sing of something, and
It's all there is
You argue that you don't see why.
To tell the truth, no more do I!
I only know it's true;
Indeed, at such a point we touch
On things too deep for me and much
Too deep for you. -
Fate has inscrutably decreed
The presence of the poet's breed
In every time and state;
He is the fruit of Fortune's whim;
If you dislike it, don't blame him;
Go and blame Fate.
L'en you, I take it, don't suppose
That he deliberately chose
To tend his homely trade;
l, 's that that comes so bitter hard—
Poor beggar, he was born a bard!
He wasn't made.
Then, readers, far from showing scorn,
Remember that you both were born
Alike of common clay;
For you are you by Nature's laws:–
The bard is but a bard because
He's built that way. DUM-DUM.

AN acute French traveller wandering
observantly through England once re-
marked that every town seemed to have
several men named Job Masters, and he
wondered that no confusion resulted.
Alas, a time has come or is about to
come when no traveller, French or
otherwise, will ever say this again. For
Job Masters is dead. The game is up.
Where once was his stable is now a
garage; where once was his horse is
now an internal combustion engine;
where once was his “fly.” (strange but
cherished misnomer!) is now a motor
car. The end may not be quite yet,
but it draws near and nearer every
moment. And being so near, and this
being an age of haste and anticipation,
let his epitaph be written:—
SACRED To the MEMORY of poor
JOB MASTERS,
Who, patient as his great namesake,
waited steadily to be employed,
on no nourishment but a straw.
He was always ready to drive anybody anywhere,
in rain or shine, heat or cold.
His horses were old and his carriages
were older,
but they were all we could get
and we had to put up
with them.
His watchwords were Livery and Bait,
and he will be sadly missed.
His end was Petrol.
What an irony of circumstance it will
be if, when the melancholy day arrives,
Job Masters has a motor funeral'
Commercial Candour.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM The DiARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, November 29.
—Two fine speeches to-night, akin in-
asmuch that each was grievously handi-
capped by deplorable infirmity of acous-
tical properties of Chamber. Difficult
for audience to follow at full length
some eloquent passages in Lord MoRIEYs
stately oration. Lord JAMES in this
respect even less successful.
Enough caught to make it clear JAMES
was taking another important step in a
career which reflects pride upon English
political life. SARK knew him first
thirty-six years ago in House of Com-
mons. He chummed with HARCOURT on
Front Bench below Gangway. Mr. G. was
still Premier, his mighty majority won at
polls in 1868 having faded to nothing-
ness. His enemies were those of his own
household. None more artful and active
than his two young friends seated below
Gangway on his right hand. Indisci-
pline on part of really capable followers
had its not unaccustomed reward. In
recess of 1873, following on Prorogation
of a Parliament destined never to meet
again, HARCOURT was made Attorney-
General, HENRY JAMES Solicitor.
Must have been strange experience for
HENRY JAMES, speaking to-night amid
chilling silence of his later love, once more
to win the cheers of representatives of
Liberal Party. Temporary severance
from men he has worked with for just
upon a quarter of a century painful, he
admited. But where honest conviction
compels he is inflexible in obeying its
impulse. Neither private friendship
nor promise of personal aggrandisement
influences him.
There was a time, midway in his
career, when the greatest prize of his
profession was within his grasp. Had
he only stood by his old chief when in
1886 Mr. G. unfurled the Home Rule Flag,
the Woolsack was his. But, though for
HENRY OF NAVARRE Paris may have been
worth a Mass, for HENRY JAMEs the Lord
Chancellorship was worth naught com-
pared with the treasure of an unsullied
conscience. While still in the prime
of life he deliberately fell out from the
race for office. Now, at another critical
epoch, conviction forces upon him seve-
rance from long-time political friends.
Business dome.—LANSDowne's amend-
ment to Finance Bill further debated.
Tuesday.—At half-past eleven CREWE
having made an end of speaking, House
presented a scene beheld only half-a-
dozen times in half a century. Looking
down upon it, one was chiefly struck by
the superb reticence of our Old Nobility.
Here they were fighting for their legis-
lative lives. Within half-an-hour they
would take an irretrievable step fateful
to themselves. Yet there was no sign
“DEATH-BED THREATs.”
of turbulent emotion, mo cheers or
counter-cheers, such as would have rung
forth in the Commons had analogous
provocation presented itself.
Chamber more crowded even than on
opening night of debate. Every bench
on either side occupied. Late comers
stood packed together shoulder to
shoulder in the space behind and flank-
ing the Woolsack, just as if they were
mere Commoners thronging the Bar.
Privy Councillors were wedged in behind
the rail that marks off the steps of the
Throne. Difficult to say where the
throng of upstanding Peers terminated
and where the Privy Councillors began.
It seemed to be all one crowd.
In the front centre, only partially
guarded by the sanctuary of the
Woolsack, sat the LoRD CHANCELLOR,
submerged in the unwonted tide of
humanity. But for his full-bottomed
wig, a patch of light grey set in the
mass of black coats, his presence would
not have been recognised.
Round the side galleries, continuing
the length of the seldom frequented
seats behind the canopy of the Throne,
was flung a garland of fair women. For
the most part they added colour and
brilliance to the scene by the dainty
hues of evening dress and the sparkle of
diamonds. Some, taking their seats
when debate opened at half-past four,
still wore their morning dress.
CREWE spoke for an hour and a half.
A stern sense of duty led him to review
the arguments forand against the Budget
Bill. The effort not nearly so effective
as his first utterance in the historic
debate.
“I beg to move,” he then said in
response to the voice of the Clerk at the
Table who, citing the Order of Business,
remarked “Finance Bill ; second read-
ing.”
What was the use at this time of
night, or indeed at any time during the
past nine days, of defending the Budget
in detail? It was stillborn when laid
on the Table of the House; the sooner
it was buried the sooner to sleep.
Happily, if the first hour of CREWE's
harangue was undeniably dull, the last
half-hour made amends by its polished
irony. The half-hour would have amply
sufficed.
A murmur of applause from the
back benches followed his sitting down.
LORD CHANCELLOR putting the question
for the Second Reading of Budget Bill
in curiously business voice, a faint cry
of “Content!” rose on his right.
“Those that are of the contrary opinion
say “Not content l’”
There was nothing approaching a roar
from the serried ranks of the Opposition
350 strong. Still there was no doubt
the Non-contents had it, and the LoRD
CHANCELLOR, not mincing matters, said
In the Commons, when division takes
place upon motion made from Treasury
Bench, SPEARER invariably declares that
“ the Ayes have it.” In this respect the
Lords have the advantage in the matter
of admission of actual fact.
Odds overwhelmingly against the
Bill. The forlorn hope gallantly ied by
CREWE resolved to die fighting. Division
challenged, the crowd slowly moved
towards the Bar that gave exit to the No
lobby. So dense was the throng it
seemed it would never squeeze through.
But no one was in a hurry. Those le-
hind refrained from crying “Forward ' "
Those in front were too well bred to cry
. . Back ! xx
The faithful few supporting the
Government kept their seats for fully
ten minutes after the opposing host
began to melt away by the Bar. Why

should they hurry 2 There was room
and to spare in the Aye Lobby, through
which they would presently stroll at
leisure.
The Primate, quitting his corner seat
below the Gangway, turned sharp to the
left; looked as if he were going out to
swell the scanty numbers supporting
| the Second Reading. Halting by steps
of Throne, he took sanctuary within
neutral quarter. Finding at hand the
familiar rail reminiscent of the altar
enclosure, in another place, he laid his
hands upon it and regarded the moving
scene. As he stood there, with gold
cross gleaming on his white robe, he
looked as if he were about to say a few
words to his dearly beloved brethren.
He refrained, and from this coign of
vantage heard the figures of the Division
announced—For the Second Reading,
75; against, 350.
So the Budget upon which the Com-
mons spent seven months' hard labour
finally sank into the abyss. No shout
of triumph rose from the victorious host;
no groan of despair testified to the dolour
of the defeated. Just a buzz of conver-
sation as Noble Lords, unused to the
exercise, tried to work out in mental
arithmetic the little sum setting forth
the precise majority.
The day's work was done; midnight
boomed from Big Ben ; thing was to go
off home to bed; which Noble Lords
proceeded to do.
Business done.—The Budget's.
House of Commons, Thursday.—On
Tuesday Lords flung down gauntlet.
This afternoon Commons pick it up,
amid outbreak of enthusiasm in Minis-
terial camp unprecedented during ex-
istence of present House.
Great muster of Members, overflowing
into side galleries. Strangers throng
benches allotted to them, some sitting
in couples on Gangway steps. Peers
crowd their gallery, sitting silent,
apparently unabashed whilst PREMIER
utters a few plain words on their recent
conduct.
Nearly two-score Questions on Paper.
Put and answered amid buzz of ani-
mated conversation that made their
purport unintelligible. Presently a
rousing cheer burst forth. Members
below Gangway on Ministerial side
sprang to their feet waving hands and
hats. It was a greeting to ASQUITH enter-
ing blushing from behind SPEAKER's
Chair.
A moment later another cheer from
benches opposite heralded the approach
of PRINCE ARTHUR.
have encountered each other at the
private entrance behind the Chair. Pro-
bably halted to talk for a moment about
the weather. -
At ten minutes past three PREMIER
discovered standing at Table. Again a
storm of cheering rose and fell. Open-
ing sentences indicated fine fighting
form. Speaking in louder tone than
customary, with added deliberation, he
drove home the charge embodied in the
Resolution he was about to submit,
“That the action of the House of Lords
in refusing to pass into law the financial
provisions of this House for the service
of the year is a breach of the Constitu-
tion and a usurpation of the rights of
the Commons.”
Salvos of cheering punctuated his
sentences. They reverberated from all
sections of Ministerialists. For once
British Liberals, Labour Members, and
Irish Nationalists are united against a
common enemy, represented by the
quiet-looking, evidently amiable gentle-
men seated in the Peers' Gallery,

Socialist holiday.
PRINCE ARTHUR's appearance on scene
an agreeable surprise for both sides.
Reported he would not be able to leave
the room to which for some days he has
been confined by sickness. But if there
is fighting to the fore he is not the kind
of man to keep out of the front line. So
he came, and if his speech fell below
the level at which it invariably flows
the House, recognised the cause and
sympathised with the plucky sick man
accordingly.
Business done.—Resolution vindicat-
ing Privilege of Commons carried by
349 against 134.
Friday.-Prorogation preliminary to
Dissolution.
A Bridge Problem in The Westminster
Gazette :
“Y deals and leaves it to Z who declares
hearts. . . . Z's (dummy's) hand was: Hearts,
5, 4, 3 . . .”
The great question is whether Y, having
executed justice upon his partner, may
plead the unwritten law.
“A small piece, rather indistinct in form and
colour, as the name, “Reflets sur Peau, indi-
cates, by Debussy, completed the programme.”
It sounds even more indistinct than
DEBUssy’s “Reflets sur l'eau.”
“Mr. Pound still hugs his affectations. . . .
We are afraid, however, that affectation will
overwhelm everything else in the long run
unless Mr. Pound bewares.”—Evening Standard.
The writer should keep on bewaring too.

THE 9.43 A.M.
“The bathroom pipe is leaking again,”
said the business man's wife at break-
fast; “I wish, dear, you'd call at the
plumber's on your way to the station.”
The business man glanced at the clock.
He caught the 9.43 every morning. It
was now 9.20, and the plumber's was
not on his way to the station, but two
hundred yards further on ; still, the
business man had only been married
three months, so he smiled and nodded
and said he should have to run for it.
Old Mr. Jones from lower down the
road saw him shoot by as he came out of
his gate. Mr. Jones was also on his way
to the small suburban station. He also
travelled by the 9.43, and he became
troubled. He looked at his watch but
distrusted it, and remembered all the
Watchmaker had said when he (Mr.
Jones) recently declined to believe it
Wanted cleaning. Mr. Jones was a
Portly person, but he had a passion for
Punctuality, and he began to run. It
Was his rule, and he never broke it, to
give the crossing-sweeper at the corner
a penny every morning, and to-day in
his hurry he gave him half-a-crown by
mistake.
When young Robinson, also bound
for the 9.43, saw Mr. Jones running, he
knew the old gentleman would not risk
apoplexy or an aneurism if there were
any time to spare. So gripping his
pipe in the corner of his mouth he
started after his puffing leader at a
young gallop. Taking the corner at a
sharp angle he collided with the butcher
coming for morning orders. His pipe
shot out of his mouth with the impact
and broke in fragments on the pavement.
It was a nicely coloured meerschaum.
Its owner glanced at the wreck, and ran
on, his empty lips gibbering.
Thirty seconds later, Mr. Brown, a
pasty-faced stockbroker with a per-
manent frown, turned into the station
road and saw young Robinson, his daily
travelling companion, sprinting for the
train. The sight deepened the furrow
on the stockbroker's brow, and he
debated how the leakage of time could
have occurred. It must have been either
when he broke his bootlace, or when his
wife had asked him for a cheque and
would not take “No” for an answer.
In any case he started jogging, though
he felt seedier than usual that morning,
and jogging was particularly painful.
Five other men, all 943 habitués,
saw him running and caught the con-
tagion. Two typewriting girls, who
always ran when the men ran, formed
the tail of the procession, and scuttled
gasping on to the platform clutching
their sides and their large wobbling
head-gear.
When the business man walked calmly
on to the platform at 9.42, he wondered
why everybody was out of breath.
A lady having ordered Paris Fashions
over the telephone, received the follow-
ing answer by post:— - -
“Madam, with reference to your order for
‘Tariff Passion,' the Chief Office advise me
they are unable to hear of this work, and I
should be glad if you could kindly let me have
publisher's name and address, and further en-
deavours will be made to procure.” -
The book should be written at once—by,

AT THE PLAY.
I.—“THE House Opposite.”
“MURDERs,” said pretty Mrs. Calthorpe
in the Second Act, catching my eye
across the footlights, “are committed
for various reasons, but four-fifths of
them, I believe, from sheer boredom.”

Whereat I smiled sheepishly, put back
my pocket-knife and gave up wondering
how to get at them over the orchestra.
Obviously I was discovered . . . .
The story of The House Opposite is a
well-known one. Richard Cardyne sees
from Mrs. Rivers' room, at 2.30 A.M., the
figure of a dark and sinister man lit up
in the window across the street. The
man carries a dagger, and Cardyne,
watching him steal into the best bed-
room with it, comments, “Odd, very
odd.” Some people would have thought
even more of it.
Home Department (whose job I had
never properly understood before) con-
sults the Right IIon. Henry Rivers
(ex-Home Secretary) about a knotty
murder which has taken place at the
house opposite in the early hours of the
morning. Cardyne is calling too, and
when he hears that an aged housekeeper,
Ann Carey, has been arrested on sus-
picion, he realises that he has dropped
right into the middle of a Hard Case.
He cannot give evidence that the mur-
derer was a man without also giving
evidence that Mrs. Rivers is an unfaith-
ful wife. What shall R. C. do?
Richard was a bad man, but he drew
the line at letting an innocent woman
die. He decides to wait until the last
possible moment—that is, until Ann

Carey has been condemned to death and
the petition for her reprieve has been
refused—and then to reveal what he saw
through the window. He waits, in fact,
ten weeks; and if Mrs. Rivers, whose
emotions we are allowed to witness,
suffered a good deal in that time, I
think it may safely be said that Ann
Carey, whom we never saw at all,
suffered even more. However, it is only
at actual death that Richard draws the
line. Well, the last day having arrived,
Cardyne and Mrs. Rivers prepare to inter-
vene. It is arranged that the latter
shall first tell everything to her husband.
The Right Hon. Henry Rivers, K.C.,
M.P., is very busy with his evening
paper when his wife begins her con-
fession, and at the end of it he looks up ||
and apologises: “I’m sorry, dear;
what were you saying 2" Just as she
is about to tell him again, he drops
his paper and says casually that, by the
way, if he might interrupt a moment,
and knowing how interested she had
been, the real murderer at the house
opposite has been discovered, and it was
a man' - -
And there you have the final situa-
tion. Her own confession was, after all,
unnecessary. Has he heard it? Will
she ever know how much he knows?
Or will he--— But he comes back again
for a final word before the curtain
descends, and makes it fairly plain (I
think) that he has both heard and for-
given.
I have hinted that there were moments
of sheer boredom, and when I tell you
that this story was spread over four
Acts, you will understand. At least
three characters were dragged on in
order to fill up time; and to one of them,
Mr. Stuart Fillerby, I owe an apology.
Mr. Fillerby was a dark young man who
defended Ann Carey over the tea-cups
with great eagerness, saying that he
knew she was innocent. Well, that
looked very suspicious and I really
thought then that I had found a clue
But no, nothing came of it.
Miss Eva MooRE as Mrs. Rivers played
a very trying and emotional part in a
very able way, but somehow I can never
quite believe in her. The evening
showed her to be an ideal actress rather
than a real Home Secretary's wife. Mr.
H. B. IRVING made an excellent Cardyne.
Cardyne had an enormous success with
women, but his love-making on the
stage to Mrs. Calthorpe was (for an es-
tablished Don Juan) a most inept per-
formance. Yet Mr. IRWING made it seem
almost credible. Mr. HERBERT WARING
as usual gets all that is to be got out of
his part. Only to see him look at his
watch on the stage is a joy to me;
there is nobody else who can put half
as much into this impressive piece of
business.

able review.
“Juliet,” I wrote, “is delightſully
drawn; the most lifelike heroine I have
I had the pleasure of seeing sweet Miss
MARIE Löhr play the part did I realise
fully how delightful Juliet was. '
“Clarence,” I said, “ had a habit of
setting his under teeth below his upper”
—(of course I was quoting, Mrs. MANN.
She must see now that - it would be
absurd to set them above)—“and pro-
jecting his lower lip when angry. I
found myself doing this all through the
book with Clarence—I suppose one gets
into it at last.” . My doubt was justified;
one never gets into it. Mr. KENNETH
Douglas, like a wise man, did not do it
once last Thursday. I suppose he had
discovered the difficulty of it during
rehearsals. -
“She (Mrs. MANN) should not have let
the mother-in-law die,” I ended. “One
has no time to get in the mood for it,
hateful though that person was.” Ah,
but how true that is; for in the new,
stage version the mother-in-law doesn't
die! However, I cannot, I am afraid,
claim this as the result of my criticism.
It is obviously the result of asking Miss
Lottie WENNE to play the part of Juliet's
mother. And shall Miss Lottie die?
Not for forty thousand Mrs. MANNs, or
we'll know the reason why.
Yet my review, I confess modestly,
was not flawless—the mistake was in
the last sentence. How could I have

called Mrs. Cummin hateful? Exas-
perating she was, certainly. That she
nearly broke up Clarence's happy home
I admit. But no one who has had
the joy of seeing Miss WENNE play the
mother-in-law will call her hateful.
All young couples should go to the
Playhouse to see this jolly little farce of
newly-married life. And old persons
and single persons may go too—to see
some extremely good acting, not only
from the delightful people I have men-
tioned already, but also from the six
other players in the cast.
The Visit (by the same authors) pre-
ceded Little Mrs. Cummin. It is a
pathetic story, intentionally full of farcical
moments, and some of us didn't quite
know whether we were supposed to
laugh at them or not. I think perhaps
it is better to keep the laughter for the
later piece. You don't want to grow
too fat.

HOW A HERO DINED.
(With acknowledgments to “The Daily News.”)
THE Budget was being assassinated.
But how did its outraged author fare on
that momentous evening? I will tell
you. Whilst the massacre was in pro-
gress he was sitting quietly in an or-
dinary Strand restaurant, where I had
the inestimable good fortune (owing to
the fact that the seat opposite to him
was vacant) of being his vis-à-vis at
dinner. I could not take my eyes off
the man: I was fascinated. I thought
of the great heroes of history. I
thought of JULIUS CESAR, of HANNIBAL,
of NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. He had a
companion, to whom he spoke. His
every gesture seemed eloquent. He is
a typical Celt. I noticed that he took
sauce with his fish and crumbled his
bread ever so lightly with his left hand.
His eyes flashed fire, his long hair
covered his collar (its size I could not
gauge) at the back. I thought of
BYRON, of SHELLEY, of St. FRANCIS of
Assisi, of CoNFUCIUs, of YoshidA ToRAJIRo.

The fish passed, and he came to the
meat. He had no evening wear, but was
quietly, plainly dressed, a man of the
people, without characteristic eccentri-
cities, unadorned by rings or other
fopperies of elegance. He took salt: he
sipped his wine. And meanwhile the
Budget was being done to death in cold
blood. Yet there was nothing to indi-
cate in his manner the tremendous issues
for him and for England that were
about to be decided.
And now the meal was over: he lit a |
cigar, he called for the waiter, he paid
his bill. He was gone. And thus lived
the man on the night of the Lords' great
act of treason to British liberty. I
thought of JEREMIAH, of AMOS, of MAHER-
SHALAL-HASHBAZ. Almost mechanically I
gathered up some of the spent crumbs
from his plate, put them in my vest
pocket, and passed out into the night.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Letters of John Stuart Blackie (BLACKwood), addressed
to his wife and edited by his nephew, ARCHIBALD STODART
WALKER, make delightful reading. One is admitted to the
intimacy of a brilliant mind confiding its impressions on
daily life to a sympathetic companion. The letters have all
the breezy frankness that marked BLACKLE's conversation, and
ccasionally disconcerted individuals among the company
favoured by it. He came in touch with most of the leading
lights in Literature, Politics and Scholarship illumining
the last half of the nineteenth century. GLADSTONE, the
late Duke of ARGYLL, TENNYSON, BREWSTER, John BRIGHT
(whom he greatly admired), BROWNING, BUNSEN, CARLYLE,
Iord DUFFERIN, Dr. GUTHRii., HENRY IRVING, Jowett, KING-
LAKE, CIIARLEs KINGSLEY, LECKY, NoſtMAN McLEOD, THEODORE
MARTIN, Lord RoseBERY-these are some of his associates,
a galaxy which in combination of variety and brilliance it
would be difficult to
excel. Among many
gifts BLACKIE possessed
one that enabled him,
sometimes in a single
sentence—he rarely took
more than three — to
draw a living picture of
a man or woman. The
portrait was complete,
not only in respect of
personal appearance, but
also of character and
intellect. It is tempting
to quote, but the har-
vest is rich and, re-
garded as a granary,
the Booking-Office is
small. The gentle
reader is bidden to go
a-gleaning for himself.
He will not regret the
enterprise.
I hesitate to describe
Godfrey Marten, School-
boy, as a classic, lest to
certain minds the term should convey an odious sugges-
tion of XENOPHON and CESAR (J.); but I may safely say
that no book has ever dealt more faithfully with the open-
ing years of public-school life, and that any work from the
pen of its delightful author, CHARLEs TURLEY, is assured
beforehand of a wide welcome amongst boys, young and
old. If in The Mincern Brothers (NELSON) he has not achieved
quite such a tour de force as in Godfrey Marten, where he
succeeded brilliantly in the perilous task of making the school-
boy tell his own story, Mr. TURLEY's hand has lost none of
its cunning. There is the same variety of types, the same
sense of character, the same fidelity to life. Those who
know his work need not be told that he has no use for the
rather morbid sentimentality of the little-hero-business which
delighted a former generation. It is enough for him to keep
our sympathies always unconsciously on the side of whatever
makes for the right public-school spirit; beyond that he
never moralises. Naturally our interest is strongest in the
earlier and more irresponsible period, while these twin
brothers were still going through the plastic stages of
development; but our attention is held to the end, and that,
too, by a story that seldom goes outside every-day life, and
only includes such adventures as put no strain upon our

credulity. “Boys,” we are told, “will be boys,” and cer-
tainly I, for one, look to remain in that happy and primitive
state as long as CHARLEs TURLEY continues to retard the work
of Time by that alchemy of which he holds the secret.
There is a Provençal form of wit known as a galégeade—so
Ilearn from The Diverting Adventures of Maurin, translated
from the French of M. JEAN AICARD by Mr. ALFRED ALLINSON
(LANE)—and its acquaintance is a good thing to make. It
involves, in a way, the same kind of notion as pulling a
person's leg. One can give a brief instance which suggests
something of the idea. The phrase “mom de pas Dieu"
is a favourite expletive among Provençals who want, so to
say, to swear in fun. The negative pas neutralises the oath
from the moral aspect, but the Devil, who is on the look-out
for such lapses, doesn't realise until the words are out of
your mouth that you are not really swearing at all, and he
finds himself sold. There are a good many more galégeades
in the story of Maurim. Maurin is one of thcse happy-go-
lucky fellows who know every inch of the countryside, and
- - can guarantee you fine
sport with your gun if
you are in their good
books; who have a fund
of humour mingled with,
a shrewd commonsense
which is valuable to
more people than care
to own it; who have a
rare liking for a bright
eye; and who lead the
gendarmerie the deuce
of a dance and yet
always come out top-
dog because they have
everybody's sympathy.
To some extent the type
is existent in England,
but I doubt whether it
could ever attain the
perfection which it
cº-orsº reaches in the atmo-
~ . sphere which M. AICARD
reproduces.
THE MIDDLE AGES.
In Airy Nothings
–" (ELKIN MATHEws), a
volume as modest in size as in title, JESSIE PoPE justifies the
many critics who recognised the high claims of her first
volume of light verse. Neat and nimble and fluent as ever,
she has now gained that command of technique which makes
a most difficult art appear as easy as the shelling of peas. A
very gentle satirist, her shafts are never barbed, but they
always arrive if she wants them to. Among women writers
in this kind she still has no rival; and, if the rest of her sex
had her sense of humour, I should be tempted to join in
the cry of “Votes for Women,” knowing full well that we
others would be safe in their hands. Meanwhile I commend
this little volume to all who can appreciate a clean and pretty
wit when they see it; and am glad that these “airy nothings”
have been fixed in so pleasant a “habitation.”
“Big Ben was tolling the hour of midnight. For hours before that
the House of Lords had throbbed with excitement.”
“There was none of the excitement which attends a critical division
in the House of Commons, but instead an air of stately calm.” -
When the historian of the future writes about the Great
Day, he will be glad to have for his guidance these con-
temporary extracts, both, by the way, from the same column
of The Daily Mail.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ELECTION CORRESPONDENCE.
“SINGLE CHAMBER.”—You touch upon a very real danger.
As a distinguished Labour Member remarked the other day
on being asked if he was in favour of the abolition of the
Lords:—“What!” he said, “and let loose all those fellows
on the electorate? Not me!” The prospect indeed gives us
pause. Not only would all these Peers secure the franchise,
which at present is denied them, along with women, aliens,
and lunatics, but they would be allowed to stump the
country during Election contests and actually enter the
House of Commons. We should say that one hundred
would get there easily on their merits (lots of them have
been there before), and another hundred on the strength
of their titles, for the British public still dearly loves a lord.
These would form a very strong Tory element in the
Commons, and your alarm is most reasonable; for, as you
remark with great propriety, the idea of a Single Chamber
is only thinkable on the assumption that it would be
permanently Radical. Our present deplorable system, by
which at worst the Lords only check legislation without
initiating it, is infinitely to be preferred to a Single
Chamber strongly impregnated with the decadent and
putrefying influence of the Peerage,
“BRITISH HUMoUR.”—“That the crowd (in Trafalgar Square)
was moved by a serious determination did not destroy the
sense of humour which is never absent from a gathering
of Britishers. The production of a turnip, deftly carved to
represent a vacuous face surmounted by a peer's coronet,
raised shouts of laughter when it was hoisted on a stick
with the inscription, ‘The eldest born,’” You say that
this passage, taken from The Daily Chronicle, makes you
despair of British humour. Bear up ; you have missed the
point, which is really quite a good one. You have forgotten
that that great Organizer of Monster Demonstrations, Capt.
HEMPHILL, of the National Liberal Club, only escaped a
turnip face through his elder brother, Lord HEMPHILL, being
born before him.
“CHAOS IN THE CUsTows.”—If you particularly want to go
to the Head Office of the Customs to make a sketch for your
threatened masterpiece in the manner of the late M. GUSTAVE
DoRÉ, we have no doubt that Mr. LAWRENCE GUILLEMARD,
Chief of that Department, would give you every facility for
studying Primeval Chaos on the spot. Indeed, thanks to the
present smooth working of his Office, he would, I am sure,
spare time to give you a personal sitting as “The Prince of
Darkness,” or, possibly, as “A Dragon of the Prime.” .
“FREE TRADER.”—Are you down-hearted ? Don't be
that. The prayers of every good German are being raised
on your behalf, that “the glorious institution of British
trade freedom may be triumphantly vindicated ” at the polls
(Berliner Tageblatt). As for Herr DELPRUECK, who says, in
defence of German protective tariffs, “Under our present
fiscal régime our industry has conquered the entire world,”
I should not pay any attention to such language. It is true
that he is the Imperial Secretary of State for the Interior,
but he is thinking of his own Interior and not yours.
“PENDULUM.”—Yes, we have read Mr. BIRRELL's quotation
from Mr. BURKE to the effect that “a change in the national
spirit” is “the most terrible of all revolutions,” but we cannot
help you. Mr. BIRRELL may have been referring to the
Elections of 1906, or, again, to those of 1910. It is not
always possible to see clearly into the mind of a Cabinet
Minister. Mr. BART KENNEDY, however, has that power, and you
should consult him. But he is very busy talking just now.
“NATIONALIST.”—If you have any doubt as to whe her your
Irish Representatives are on the side of the People in the
great struggle now impending, you cannot do better than read
Mr. John REDMOND's open letter to Mr. T. P. O'Coxxon, who
has been going round America with the hat (dear old
U.S.A.!). In that pregnant communication he says that the
House of Lords has “challenged the immemorial right of
the people's representatives to fix the taxes and to control the
finances of the country.” We can well understand that
your faith was a little shaken on the occasion when the Irish
people's representatives refused en masse to vote for the
Third Reading of the Budget, thus declining to exercise
their “immemorial right to fix the taxes.” But words speak
more strongly than actions, and this letter should restore
your confidence.
“ONE OF THE PEOPLE.”—Your brain must be on the soft
side if you really suppose that the coming contest is between
the Peers and the People. If it were it would be over before
it had begun, since there are only a few hundred Peers and
I don't know how many millions of the others; and, besides,
the Peers can't vote. Of course the match is really People v.
People, as it always is—each team playing at home. I see
you are on the side of the People. Well, so are we. And,
with any luck, we ought to win. O. S.

The LEAGUE for The ENCOURAGEMENT OF SILENT INFLUENCE.
Till bloated, sullen, desperate, I let them do their worst,
Hoping, before the crack of Time, with any luck, to burst.
Shame on the callous mob that cheered Shame on the
coward host
That fought to gain the privilege of who should hurt me
most ;
And shame on him that shaped me as an orange, to my shame,
Not as my eggy kinsman of the Rugby Union game!
It is men's task to raise him up; from hand to hand he flies,
Or, folded in their warm embrace, calm as a babe he lies;
They spare to kick him in the wind, save with a courteous
race
That lifts him through th' empyreal air, soaring aloft in space.
Ah gods, the swelling joys of such a flight! What pride to see
The world below, the wild hands stretched in welcome! And
- what glee
To flatter the expectant back, and then, with impish change,
Dash edgeways down, and leap, in lively error, out of range'
What cheers attest his prowess as he travels high and far !
What hush of awed suspense awaits his Crossing of the Bar!
And ah, how sad to think that aught so vital should depend
On being made all over round, or pointed at the end.
For we were both of like estate; but Fortune's fell employ
Has made of me a rolling drudge, and him an eggy toy.
And very much I would the boot were on the other leg—
Th’ Association Orange he, and I the Rugby Egg.
DUM-DUM.
LITERARY NOTES.
The success of Mr. William DE MoRGAN's new novel, with the
snappy title, It Never Can Happen Again, is said to be likely
to inaugurate a new era in fiction. Novelists, who have ever
been quick to discern the trend of public favour, assisted by
their publishers, never renowned for an adamantine and
pedantic reluctance to assimilate their rivals' methods, have
settled down to invent titles of similar discursiveness. Thus,
Mr. JACOBs' new collection of short stories will be called Those
who go Down to the Sea in Ships; Mr. HEWLETT's new novel,
They Lore Too Much who Die for Lore; while Mr. DE MoRGAN is
at work upon I Always Said the Thing was Extremely Unlikely
to Recur.
The recent decision of the circulating libraries to manage
their own business in their own way has, it is well known,
drawn from the Librarian of the House of Lords an eloquent
protest. There is, however, no truth in the statement that
Mr. GossE's letters to The Times have been bound in crushed
levant as a gift to Mr. Lloyd GEORGE with a view to so placating
him that he may relent and permit the House of Lords–
and its Librarian—to exist, after all.
The notoriety procured for Mr. WILLIAM WATSON by his
chivalrous description of a London hostess as “The woman
with the serpent's tongue,” has borne good fruit, and we are
already promised by other bards “The man with the camel's
hump,” “The woman with the elephant's ears,” “The girl
with the hare's lip,” and “The boy with the frog's march.”
Meanwhile, following time-honoured custom, “The woman
with the serpent's tongue” is to be arranged as a more or less
unclothed dance at the music-halls.

LETTERS TO A MARTIAN.
MY DEAR SIR,-You have heard, of course, that in this
happy country of ours we are soon to be plunged into the
turmoil and terror of a General Election. Already in every
constituency the electors are being adjured with every varia-
tion of menace, entreaty and cajolery to march shoulder to
shoulder to a certain triumph, and to allow no rust to dim
the brightness of their flashing swords. Not a single stone
anywhere is to be left unturned, for who knows what stone
may conceal a mass of votes sufficient to determine the issue?
The party pamphleteers, too, are busy with their wares,
highly spiced and admirably composed. It would surprise
you to read their efforts and to find how infamous we all are.
Within the next five or six weeks six hundred and seventy
men, all, according to one view or the other, criminals of
The chairman has had his ten minutes and has called on.
“our esteemed and popular candidate, Mr. Butterfield.”
Butterfield is on his legs. I pass over his preliminary
compliments to the intelligence of his audience, and plunge
into what I may call the thick of his speech:—
Butterfield. Why am I appealing to you? Why are we
to have a general election ? Because the House of Lords,
in the exercise of its undoubted right—(Mustn't say they
rejected the Budget. That would be giving the show away) —
decided that the revolutionary proposals of this Government
ought not to be passed into law without—(This sentence is
getting a bit miced. However, now that I've begun it, I must
finish it)—a consultation, I mean, without submitting it to
the judgment of the people. Is there anything wrong
in that? Why, it is the Lords who are the true friends
of the people.—(A voice: “Down with them!”)—If my friend
a peculiarly atrocious kind

Theirs is the speech-making º ſº the people — (The voice:

must travel from place to
place in the pursuit of a
majority of votes, and every
night they are to be seen
and heard on platforms.
There is my friend Butter-
field, for instance. Butter-
field is a good, honest, solid
man, a member of the
London Stock Exchange,
who has been selected to
contest a County Division
in the interest of Tariff
Reform and the House of
Lords, two great objects
which divide him and his
from the rapscallions who
support Free Trade and
the democracy. Butterfield

very proud of the Budget—

years, and the poor crea-

=- (That rascal has put it out
Fº of my head. . What was I
Tºº saying?)—eventually they
can only complain that the
grapes are sour. Now if the
Budget is such a miracle
of fairness as they say —
stead of which’’ he now runs
about the country neglecting his business, abandoning his
wife and family, and addressing political meetings. He
tells me he has held more than thirty meetings in the past
three weeks and hopes to hold fifty more before his polling
day. He is no longer a man; he is an inexhaustible
reservoir of words and phrases, which he pours out twice
a night for more than half-an-hour without stopping. I
heard him last week, and I am bound to say he did it
admirably well.
What interested me, however, was not so much his speech
itself as the thoughts that must have been passing through
his mind as he uttered it. You'll say, perhaps, that a man
like that can't think. You're entirely mistaken. While
the pat phrases are tumbling out of his mouth he is thinking
furiously, and his thoughts play him the most fantastic
tricks. Let me give you an example to show my meaning.
Butterfield's actual speech shall stand in the ordinary roman
letters, while his thoughts shall appeal to you in italics.
You are to imagine a schoolroom in an agricultural village
and an audience of fifty or sixty of the free and independent.
(There's a chap in the third
row who looks like a Nonconformist minister. Wonder
if he'll be down on me)—why do they tax the working
man's whiskey and his tobacco–(Voice from the third row: :
“That's better than taxing his food") —and how—(The
Chairman ought to stop these interruptions and keep these
fellows in order)—do they dare to come to you and call
this a poor man's Budget 2
There—I’ve given you a mere extract, of course, but
it will serve as a sample of the rest. At the end the
Chairman said that Butterfield would be only too glad to
answer any number of questions. The questions were put
right enough, but I never saw anybody look less delighted
than Butterfield at having to tackle them. And this is the
sort of thing he has to do every night.
Yours to a turn,
AN EARTHworm.

Damp is very injurious to pianos. It
is a mistake to clean them with a hose.
Foreign bodies in the eye should
never be removed with a pin. Loosen
all clothing about the neck, remove
artificial teeth, and keep patient amused
till the doctor arrives.
Trousers will last nearly as long again
if worn only half the time.
To tell if a poker is really red-hot,
breathe on it and apply it to the back of
the hand.
Freckles can be removed with a file,
but it is a tedious process.
Earwigs will not attack dahlias if you
smother them in tar—either of them.
To avoid a pimple while shaving,
cover it with luminous paint, and shave
in the dark with a safety razor.
There is no law in this country against
dropping a penny stamp into a pillar-box,
unattached to a letter or other missive.
A kick from a mouse would pro-
bably not even waken a sleeping elephant.
A kick from an elephant, on the other
hand, would probably injure a sleeping
mouse for life.
Geysers are met with in Iceland,
where some of them throw up fountains
of steam and hot water 200 feet high.
In England they are mostly used for
heating bath-water, and are seldom more
than 3 to 3 ft. 6 in. high.

BARBARA'S PRESENT.
“If you should happen to be in
Regent Street to-morrow at four” (ran
the assignation), “just where what's the
name of that street comes into it, and a
lady in a very pretty new mauve coat
and skirt bows to you, raise your hat
and say, ‘Crisis,' and she will let you
help her with her shopping.”
My guess at the name of the street
was successful. I raised my hat and
said, “Good afternoon.”
“But you had to say “Crisis,’ ” said
Miss Middleton. “That's the password.”
“I can't. I’ve sworn I'll never say
it again. I took a most fearful oath.
Several people heard me taking it, and
swooned.”
“But how do I know you're the right
one if you don't say it? Well, I sup-
pose I shall have to let you come. I’ve
just lost mother; she went in at the
silver department and out at the art
fabrics—like people when they can't
pay for their hansoms.”
“Yes, that's bad. The accused, who
appeared to feel her position acutely,
gave a false address. What are you
going to buy?”
“Well, I thought I'd just help you
get your presents first.”
“I’m not giving any this Christmas.
I gave a lot only a year ago.”
“Oh, but haven't they paid you any
wages since then 2''
“Yes, a few trifling sums, only—
Quick, there's your mother ' " I pulled
Miss Middleton hastily into the nearest
shop and shut the door.
“What fun!” she said breathlessly.
“Mother loves hide-and-seek.”
Mrs. Middleton hurried past, covered
with parcels, and dived into another
door.
“It’s quite safe now,” I said. “Let’s
go and 3 y
“What can I have the pleasure of
showing you?” said a soothing voice at
our backs.
We turned round in alarm.
“Er—we only just—let me see, what
was it you wanted P’’ said Miss Middle-
ton to me.
“I don't really want anything. I was
going to help you buy one of those——
you know.”
“Yes, but I’ve got that. I know
there was something you said you wanted
very much.”
“Probably tea.”
“Tiaras,” explained Miss Middleton
hastily. “Of course.”
“Certainly, madam,” said the shop-
walker. “If you will just sit down,”
he continued, leading us to a little room
out of the main stream of shoppers,
“I will send somebody to attend to
you.”
We sat down mechanically. I leant my
|
stick against a show-case and balanced
my hat on the top of it.
“Now you've done it,” I said. “How
many tiaras shall we have? I've got
nearly four pounds.”
“We needn't have any. We can say
we don't much care about their selec-
tion.”
“Or that we wanted one specially
built for us.”
“One goes into dozens of shops with-
out buying anything,” said Miss Middle-
ton cheerily.
“I never do,” I replied gloomily.
“Hush, here he comes.”
An attendant advanced briskly to-
wards us. I put my hands in my
pockets and tried to count my money.
“Tiaras, madam? Certainly. About
what price?”
“Tell him about three pounds eight
and six,” I whispered to Miss Middleton.
“Three pounds nine,” I corrected, as I
ran another sixpence to ground.
“Here is a beautiful one at two hun-
dred and fifty pounds.”
“Too much,” I prompted softly.
“Oh,” broke in Miss Middleton
brightly, “I’m so sorry—such a silly
mistake! We wanted neck-chains, not
tiaras' Barbara has a tiara already,
hasn't she?” she appealed to me.
“Two,” I said quickly. “If not
three.”
“I’m so sorry,” said Miss Middleton
again, with a dazzling smile. “The
first gentleman must have misunder-
stood. Of course we gave her a tiara
last year.”
The man was disappointed ; I saw
that. But the smile melted him, and
he went off in all friendliness.
“Tiara doesn't sound very much like
neck-chain,” I remarked after a pause.
“Oh, don't you think so? It depends
how you say it. Same as Beauchamp
and Cholmondeley.”
“And what is it when pronounced
properly?”
“It's a chain that hangs round your
neck, and when you don't quite know
what to say to anybody you play with it
carelessly. Or else you finger it absently.
Like men smoking cigarettes, only better
for you.”
“I see. Well, here comes a hundred
of the best.”
The attendant got to business at once.
“This one,” he said, holding up
rather a jolly one, “comes out at ten
guineas.”
“Tell him,” I whispered to Miss
Middleton, “that we’ve only come out
with three.”
“That's very pretty,” she said. “Are
those moonstones?”
“Yes, madam. The fashionable stone
this year.”
“It's more for next year that we
want it.”
“I should say this season. I don't
think you will find a prettier one than
this, madam.”
“It's very sweet. But aren't they
unlucky, unless you happen to have
been born in the right month P’” She
turned to me. “When is Barbara's
birthday?”
“May,” I said unhesitatingly. “I
mean March.”
“Anyhow,” said Miss Middleton, “I
know it's wrong for moonstones, because
I was thinking of giving her some two
years ago, and it had to be opals instead.”
“We both thought of it,” I said.
Miss
admiringly that I began to get reckless.
“Besides, we don't know the size of
her neck,” I went on. “And she never
smokes—I mean she never doesn't know
what to say to anybody. So I think we
should be making a mistake if we gave
her this. I do indeed. Now if it had
been anybody else but Barbara—”
The man looked from one to the other
of us in bewilderment.
“If you could show us some hat-
pins instead P’’ said Miss Middleton
hurriedly, before he could open his
mouth.
“This is excellent,” I said, as he
retired in confusion; “we’re working
down well. All we've got to do now is
to wait till he comes back and then say
that we’re sorry but we meant hairpins.
With hairpins you're practically there.”
“Supposing they only had gold ones.”
“Then we should point out that they
wouldn't go with Barbara's curiously-
coloured hair. You leave this to me. I
can finish it off now on my head. At
the same time I'm sorry I'm not going
to spend anything.”
“Oh but you are,” said Miss Middleton.
“You’re going to give me and mother
tea.”
“Of course I am,” I agreed.
After tea I went back to the shop by
myself.
“I want,” I said, “a trifle for about
three pounds. A moonstone pendant or
something. Yes, that's very sweet. No,
I'll take it with me.”
They packed it in a pretty little box
for me, and I’m going to send it to Miss
Middleton on the 24th. I am putting
in a card with the words “From
Barbara’’ on it. As I said, I am not
giving any presents myself this year,
but I do think that Barbara should
repay at least some of the kindnesses
which have been showered upon her so
wantonly. A. A. M.

Mr. Punch has not seen the work in
question, but knowing the tendency of
the day to false delicacy he ventures to
suggest a few questions which are pro-
bably omittel from it, but could not fail
to add to the liveliness of the happy
season which is upon us:—
Who was your father?
How often was he a bankrupt?
Who was your mother?
What is her real age?
Do your parents get on together?
If not, whose fault do you think it is?
When were you born ?
Were you ever expelled from school?
What is your income?
Have you now become temperate?

[“What greater pleasure can there be to a
private gentleman,” says CARL HAGENBACK in
his Beasts and Men, “than that of maintaining
and establishing personal friendships with a
collection of foreign animals?"]
For years I led a dreary life;
The days passed slowly, one by one ;
I fed the ducks, reproved my wife,
Played HANDEL's Largo on the fife,
Or gave the dog a run.
I neither realised nor knew
The pleasures of a private Zoo.
I never loved a dear gazelle,
To glad me with its soft black eye,
Nor ever to my lot it fell
To know a penguin really well,
Till, early last July,
I bought a small menagerie,
And oh! the difference to me!
Now, when my spouse, perverse or cold,
Induces an attack of dumps,
I feel encouraged and consoled
When in their manège I behold
My camels' greater humps;
I fly from dear mamma-in-law
To Kate, my talkative macaw.
When statesmen's speeches are disgraced
By vulgar insults which denote
A lamentable lack of taste,
I seek my monkey-house in haste
To find an ant.dote;
I turn for manners to the lair
Of Bosco, my performing bear.
Those “lions” whom we fête and feed,
Heroes of sword or brush or pen,
Are they more dignified, indeed,
Than creatures of that nobler breed
- Which decorate my den?

The more I love my private Zoo !

THE FALL OF THE BLOOD.
I HAVE scarcely got over the shock yet,
although it happened more than twenty-
four hours ago.
We called the youth “The Pedigree
Pup.” He traced his ancestors back to
the CoNQUEROR. Not that there was
much harm in that, but he was always
ramming the allegation down our throats,
and it used to get on our nerves. Other-
wise he was a harmless well-dressed
idiot. With regard to his pedigree, as
a matter of fact, mone of us believed in
it—and in any event it seemed an in-
sufficient excuse for him—and you may
be sure his trusted intimates never lost
a chance of telling him so.
But two of us felt sorry about this
yesterday.
Yesterday we were out with him when
on a sudden he fell heavily on his back on
the pavement. A confounded piece of
banana skin had done it. And when the
Pedigree Pup tried to rise he couldn't.
With a groan he fell back again. At
first we thought he was trying to draw
us, but when we bent down to help him
up we saw a sight which made us feel
queer. Blood was trickling from the
side of the Pedigree Pup—and its colour
was blue.
You never saw such shame-faced
sceptics as we were then. “We’re
sorry, old chap,” we said, just before he
noticed what we had seen. Then
he looked at us reproachfully, and
swooned . . . It was the work of a
minute to call a cab and to rush him to
a hospital.
Our feelings during the diagnosis
may better be imagined than described.
We had to wait only ten minutes, but it
seemed as many hours. “If he gets
over this, we'll never chaft the poor old
fellow again,” we said.
At last the doctor—much too young
for his job, it seemed to us—appeared.
“Well?” we asked in unison.
“Your friend has sprained his ankle,”
he said.
“But the blood, doctor?”
“What blood P’’
“Why, the blue blood.”
“Ah, I had forgotten that,” he said,
and smiled in what we regarded as a
callous manner.
“We were fond of our friend,” I said
reprovingly. “In falling, he surely
broke an artery 2”
“A very natural mistake,” he said
kindly. “So many amateurs find a
difficulty in distinguishing between an
artery and a fountain pen.”

in The Blue Bird. And there was are put up again the graves are seen
him, for, after all, it was he who
provided the matter to work
upon. But he would have fared
indifferently without the assist-
ance of these others. I do not
complain that his work was a
medley of pantomime, fairy-tale
and allegory. New dramatic
forms are always welcome if they
lend themselves to presentation
on the stage. My complaint is
that this is not good pantomime
nor right fairy-tale nor sound
allegory. As pantomime it has
not stuff enough in it to go
round, and it has too little
“relief" for what stuff there is.
As fairy-tale it lacks cohesion and
really provides no story, as Peter
Pan does, to hold the imagina-
tion of children. As allegory,
it is wanting in the logical con-
sistency that is demanded of
symbolic work.
The main idea, I am authori-
tatively informed, is the search
of Mankind after Happiness. But
this quest is conducted in the
most unlikely quarters—now in
a graveyard, and now among
the cavernous haunts of the
spirits of disease and war and
death. And, when one has the
Idea symbolised by two little
innocent children in search of a
Blue Bird, the unlikelihood of
this course of inquiry almost
touches the limits of the grotesque.
The fact is that a few disconnected
ideas have occurred to M. MAETERLINck,
some of them drawn from the realm
of poetic phantasy, others founded
on hard fact: as that there are no
dead; that those whom we call the
dead are just asleep, and wake up
to the old life whenever the living
remember them—a very gentle thought;
that Nature—both the animal and the
vegetable world—is the enemy of man;
that the dog is a beautiful exception; and
so forth. A fairy poem might possibly
have been built up round these ideas,
with everything left to the imagination.
But when you try to stage them; when
you try, in the prosaic atmosphere of a
theatre, to illustrate your fancy by

(the critic of The Times pauses in his
rhapsody to give a catalogue of their
Latin names). A poet, just using words
without pictures plain or coloured, and
trusting a little to my imagination,
might trace for me, in the flowers that
spring from a grave, the symbol of
immortality, and I should be content.
But this stage-mechanism leaves me
cold and sceptic.
I may add that the subsequent
exhibition of a dancing skeleton in
Act V. did not help much to confirm
M. MAETERLINCK's statement that there
are no dead.
Take again the pretty fancy of a
region inhabited by unborn children
waiting for their birth. Realized in
concrete form, the scene invites to

impious laughter. Two children, blue
and unborn, are already in love with
one another; a third informs the little
human boy, Tyltyl, who is only half his
size, that he hopes shortly to become
his baby-brother. Father Time seeks
to relieve the situation with some mild
facetiousness; but it is really the
splendour of the scenic background
that saves it.
I know I shall be called profane and
a Philistine. I know that, if I were
a good critic like the others, I should
M. MAETERLINCK, too. I must not forget covered with stiff rows of funereal flowers
approach a work by M. MAETERLINck
with the awe due to a Master
of Symbolism, and attribute any
apparent failure on his part to
my own want of poetic insight.
Well, I must bear these reflec-
tions with what meekness I can
command, and meanwhile invite
the others to go and see Peter
Pan once more, and recover their
childhood.
The performance was excellent.
Little Miss Olive WALTER, as the
boy Tyltyl, was the best child I
have ever seen on the stage. She
maintained an admirable interest
and curiosity in the various
wonderments which it was her
business to investigate, and did
not attempt to conceal her very
natural indifference to the lectures
of which she was from time to
time the innocent victim. I can-
not share the general enthusiasm
for the dog and cat, not caring
much for half-human hybrids.
Give me the uncompromising
actualities of Drury Lane.
Next to the extreme beauty
of the scenery (and I wish,
by the way, that more gauze
had been used to give the
right vagueness to things of the
imagination), I cherish most the
memory of Miss INA PELLY as
Water, a charming study in the
manner of the nymphs of Mr.
WATERHOUSE's pictures, and her
exquisite dance in the Third Act. If
only some of our “classical” performers
had her youth and litheness and grace
of limb.
As a great admirer of Mr. HERBERT
TRENCH's enterprise, I wish I could
forecast a long success for his latest
presentation. But, in spite of its many
delightful fancies, I am afraid that the
children will want a more enthralling
tale, and one with less of death in it, and
that their elders will feel that in this
effort to realise abstract ideas the stage,
not for the first time, has overstepped
the limits proper to its art.
But I am grateful to M. MAETERLINCK,
for, until I had seen his Blue Bird, I
never appreciated at its full worth the
genius of Mr. BARRIE.

I MET him, where one meets most of the
odd characters, in a public-house. He
was drinking the national beverage, now
reduced once again to its traditional
| price, and drinking it not the less readily
| on that account. -
We had no introduction save the
circumstance that we chanced both to be
taking refreshment at the same time—
and, after all, is not that a bond? He
did not begin to talk at once, and very
Jikely would not have done so had not a
little man come hastily in, received his
drink, laid his money on the bar without
# a word, also without a word drunk it,
j and hurried out again.
“You might guess a hundred times
| before you could say what that man
| does,” said my neighbour.
I gave it up at once. He might have

there are so many varieties of such pro-

was too busy and taciturn; a com-
mission agent, but he was alone; a cheap
| oculist, but he would not be free at this
| hour.
I therefore gave it up at once.
“He’s a conjurer,” said the man.
“Not on the stage: goes out to parties
and smokers.”
I expressed the necessary amount of
surprise and satisfaction.
“Odd what different things men do,”
he continued. “There's all sorts of
trades, isn't there? I often sit for hours
watching men and wondering what they
are. Sometimes you can tell easily. A
carpenter, for instance, often has a rule
pocket in his trousers that you can spot.
A lawyer's clerk has a certain way with
him. Horses always leave their mark
on men, and you tell coachmen even in
plain clothes. But there's many left to
baffle you.”
“Yes,” I said (for I, too, am
a “bromide"), “it needs a Sherlock
Holmes.”
“And yet there's some to puzzle even
him,” said my man. “Now what do
you think he'd make of me?”
Upon my word I couldn't say. He
was just the ordinary artisan, with a
little thoughtfulness added. A small,
pale man, grizzled and neat, but the
clothes were old. The shininess and
bagginess of the knees suggested much
kneeling; nothing else gave me a hint.
“I give that up too,” I said.
“Well,” he replied, “I’ll tell you,
because you're a stranger. I'm a
worm-holer.”
“A worm-holer?”
“Yes, I make worm-holes in furniture
to make it seem older and fetch a better
price.”
“Great heavens !” I said, “I have
heard of it, of course, but I never
thought to meet a worm-holer face to
face. How do you do it?”
“It's not difficult,” he said, “to make
the actual holes. The trick is to make
'em look real.”
“And what becomes of the furniture?”
“America chiefly,” he said. “They
like old English things there, the older
the better. Guaranteed Tudor things
will fetch anything . . . we guarantee
all ours.” -
“And you have no conscience about
it?” I asked.
“None,” he said. “Not any more.

satisfaction that a chair which QUEEN
ElizaBETH might have sat in is theirs at
last. Just think of their excitement
and joy. No man who brings such
simple and honest feelings to his fellow-
beings is a rogue. You admit that’ ”
I am no casuist. “Tell me how you
came to be a worm-holer,” I said.
“It was out of gratitude,” he replied,
“to a dealer who had been kind to me.
I wanted to repay him. I had no money,
only ideas and some ability. He had up to
that time been on the straight, as we say.
I showed him how to make much more
money and save himself and his family
from ruin. He had no chance in the
ordinary way; as a purveyor of spurious
antiques—always, mark you, giving
pleasure and happiness – he could
succeed. “Because,” he added, as he
finished his beer, “it’s not what is that
counts but what one thinks it.”
He wished me good morning and
walked out.
“Good heavens !”
“Where am I?’”
And I am still wondering.
I said again.
A SPORTING TRAGEDY.
[“Athletics,” according to Miss MAY SUTTON,
“are the best antidote for premature love
affairs.”]
IN early youth he loved and wooed,
And oh! his ways were wondrous
gentle;
For sports, which he considered rude,
He did not care one continental ;
But, though her heart he strove to gain
With many a tender word and deed,
he
Found all his amorous efforts vain
Because she thought him fartoo weedy.
“The man who marries me must show
Some skill at outdoor exercises,
Have scored his century or so
And won his share of sporting prizes.
In time, perhaps, I'll love you well,
And may consent to have you by me,
But now you cannot even tell
A cut past cover from a stymie.”
He strove to bang the hefty four,
He learned to bowl the googly twister,
To lean upon the lusty oar,
Disdainful of the frequent blister.
All sports proved potent to delight
One who had been so limp a lover,
From over-flying WILBUR WIRIGHT
To under-studying a shover.
But, though the prospect of her hand
First turned his taste in this direc-
tion,
Sport's fascination gripped him, and
Stifled his premature affection.
The passing years have left him free ;
Her words on Man are simply cutting;
A solitary spinster she,
While he's-improving in his putting.
AT THE KNEE OF AN IDOL.
By ALBERT DE ToMPKYNs, M.P.
[With acknowled, ments to Mr. Arthur Pon-
sonby's fascinating treatise on the iniquity
of riches, “The Camel and the Needle's
Eye.”]
. . . BUT while the possession not
merely of riches B. D. A. (Beyond the
Dreams of Avarice), but of wealth beyond
the standard of a full competence, has
been shown to be damaging to the
owner and dangerous to the community,
it would be undesirable to enforce an
abstinence from the amenities of life
calculated to interfere with the happiness
of the Enlightened Unit.
In arriving at a clear definition of the
sumptuary limit, nothing is more help-
ful than the concrete instance. Let us,
therefore, begin with boots. Man is a
walking animal, but unhappily, deprived
of his pristine horny-footedness by the
enervating influence of an advanced civili-
sation, cannot dispense with these cum-
brous and costly leather cases. Under
Socialism, as WALTER BAGEHOT once
acutely surmised, every man would have
one boot. Possibly, if he were alive
now, he might be tempted to add “and
one roller skate.” But setting aside
this solution as alas! too Utopian, we
have to ask ourselves the following
soul-shaking (or shall we say sole-
shaking?) question: How many pairs
of boots ought the Enlightened Unit to
possess without becoming a danger t
the community? -
Here the opinions of experts are in
acute conflict. Lord ALTHORP, that stal-
wart Radical, has pronounced the irre-
ducible minimum for a self-respecting
single-chamber man to be sixteen pairs,
and absolutely condemns the use of elas-
tic sides. Sir JESSE Boot, on the other
hand, places the figure as low as six. We
shall probably not be deviating from
the norm of sociological exactitude if we
split the difference, and say that the
Enlightened Unit should not possess
more than eleven pairs of boots and
shoes.
Another cognate question of vast im-
portance for the community is that of
camels. How many camels may a man
possess without incurring the stigma of
opulence and passing into the dread
limbo of mirthless misery, for, as Mr.
ANDREW CARNEGIE remarks: “A mil-
lionaire seldom smiles.” Statistics com-
piled by Mr. GRAYSON reveal the terrible
fact that the son of a peer recently kept
a private menagerie. In Paris it is a
common practice for decadent gentle-
men and ladies to perform in a private
circus. But the associations of the
camel are such as to repel the sympa-
thies of all right-minded humanitarians.
The camel suggests Egypt, that ever-
present witness of our tyranny and
oppression. The camel has been cele-
brated by Mr. Kipling, the apostle of a
debased Imperialism. And lastly, in
the witty language of that great theo-
logian, BERNARD SHAw, “The man who
keeps a camel generally gets the hump.’’
Taking all these considerations into
account, it will, we think, be readily
admitted that there is no urgent need
for a Self-respecting and Enlightened
Unit to keep camels at all, but that, if he
does, he should not run to more than
four, or say two dromedaries. As the
great NAPOLEON truly remarked, “Il faut
se borner.” Before we quit this branch
of the subject let us say that the ques-
tion whether peers should or should not
keep private menageries is implicitly
answered in the title which collectively
symbolises the credentials of our heredi-
tary legislators—Lord No Zoo. "
Another question of poignant interest
at this moment is that of yachts. How
many yachts, for example, may a baronet
or, to be concrete, may Sir THOMAS LIPTON
possess? Yachting, when the owner is
a genuine seaman, is a healthy and in-
vigorating pursuit? We think we shall
not be deviating from the standard of
good taste and economy if we say that
no person possessing a full competence
ought to own more than one steam
yacht, one racing cutter, and three motor
launches. A larger numberwould probably |
lay the owner open to a charge of osten-
tation, which, if he is a man of humane
views and a supporter of the land taxes,
might prove embarrassing to his amour
propre. In this context we would also
suggest with all respect that no Radical
M.P. ought to give more than sixteen
Fragonard dinner-parties in the course
of a single season.
When we approach the discussion of
the bi-cameral system in a fitting spirit
of dispassionate detachment, a number
of problems of vital interest literally leap
to the eyes. How many times ought a
“backwoodsman " to go to a Gaiety
burlesque to justify his being denounced
in The Chronicle as the “ne plus ultra
of devilish decadence” 2 How many
times must a peer succumb to inebriety
before he is entitled to be called (1) a
drunken helot, (2) as drunk as a lord?
These are only a few of the perplexities
which beset the path of the earnest
sociological inquirer in search of the
sumptuary limit. Sauerbeck's Index
Number is no doubt a useful but by no
means an infallible guide, and an emo-
tional stimulus can always be obtained
by the perusal of the treatises of Crit-
tenden, Blamphin, Orella Corre and
Alpheus Boker. But in these, as in all
other psycho-political investigations, the
honest observer should rely chiefly on
his own prepossessions, eschewing the
mirage of statistics and the fata Mor-
gana of fact . . . .

My private belief is that MAUD DIVER became so strongly
attached to that excellent former creation of hers, Captain
Desmond, V.C., that she wrote Candles in the Wind (BLACK-
wood) solely for the pleasure of bringing him into it. And
small blame to her. Accordingly, when her latest hero,
Alan Lawrence, has been brought to the last limit of human
endurance, suddenly there enters, the god from the car, an
English officer “whose fine-featured face seemed oddly
familiar.” So that was all right! Desmond locked away
He has an eye for types of men;
He does not hug the beaten track;
He starts his story well, and then
He somehow seems to lose the knack.
The sex problem, it is true, looms frequently in Love and
the Wise Men (METHUEN), but Mr. PERCY White has treated
the subject so amusingly and discreetly that it will shock
the puritanical as little as it will entertain the prurient.
“Modern education,” says Spenser Kirke, “is suffering from
the blight of a false delicacy which makes schoolmasters
ashamed to teach the young that they are as much a part of
the world as kittens,” and obsessed by this idea he sends
the too-tempting revolver, nursed
Lawrence through a sharp attack
of fever, and generally straight-
ened things up all round.
Amongst other worries, Lawrence
was vexed with himself because
he had fallen in love with the
wife of Somebody Else. I do
not think he can have read
many Anglo-Indian novels, or
he would have known that they
seldom have any other founda-
tion. Eventually, however,

This is quite wonderfully well
done. Miss DIVER's pen-pictures

tier bring all the romance and
terror and mystery of this finge |

the two boys became intensely
alive to the emotions which were
to have been subdued. Mme.
Bard, along with Patricia Har-
court, a charming girl who lived
| inconveniently close to the In-
* stitution, played ducks with all
- educational theories, and David
and Philip left Rouen precipi-
tately. After this set-back Philip
went placidly to Rugby, and as
he managed to go there in his
sixteenth year and also suc-
ceeded in watching a Gentlemen

more than his ordinary share of
luck. David's education in the
meantime was supervised by his

“In many respects,” Mr. HENRY ARTHUR
Jones told the members of the Kit Mar-
lowe Club, “SHAKSPEARE was a very plain,
ordinary, straightforward person.” Mr.
HALL CAINE, however, denies indignantly
that he was very Pºiº.
Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN expresses sur-
prise that Mr. ASQUITH should have made
no mention of National Defence in his
pronouncement on Liberal policy. Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN forgets that the PREMIER
has to consider the feelings of his sup-
chartered accountant, a piano-
forte maker, and a number of clerks
and tradesmen. Peers are evidently too
proud to give their. cºrrect designation.
*
Rumours of a grave political scandal
reach us. It is said that a certain
Liberal M.P. who is going about the
country predicting an enormous majority
for his party has entered into a competi-
tion, started by a contemporary, which
offers a large money prize for the most
accurate guess at the result of the
election. The scandal is that he there
predicts (on dit) a majority for the
Conservatives.

INTERVAL FOR REFRESHMENT.
CoME let us call a sacred truce'
So shall the hustings' hideous hum
And lips that bandy loud abuse
Respect The Season and be dumb,
Silenced by pudding of the stodgy plum.
Here's Christmas on us with its brood
of ancient memories, dear and tried,
When decent souls may well exude
A goodwill not to be denied
Even to people on the other side.
Let us adopt a festal cheer,
And, for a little breathing-space,
Admit that even in a Peer
There may be points of saying grace ..
Lurking behind his lordship’s “ turnip-face.
Let us allow that even LLOYD,
For all the bricks he loves to heave,
Is not so hopelessly devoid
Of manners as you might believe,
But has a small behaviour up his sleeve.
Let us presume that SANDY URE
Is grievously misunderstood,
Having a conscience quite as pure
As little WASHINGTON's, the Good,
Who couldn't tell a whopper if he would.
Let us give out that WINSTON C.
Is loyal and would still remain
A Jonathan to David G., -
Although the Tories (come to reign) . * >
Askel him, like WHITTINGTON, to “turn again.
Let us infer that Mr. Bung
Has got no privy axe to grind,
But simply prays to serve among
The benefactors of his kind, -
And views the Budget with an open mind.
Let us ignore the Navy ghost,
Nor count for gospel all we've read
About the Teuton’s “Am Tag” toast,
But follow REGGIE's lead instead,
Sleeping in natural places, such as Bed.
Let us believe that, in his heart
Grateful for bounties we bestow,
John REDMOND cannot bear to part,
To leave our well-loved isle, and go
Away from where the Old-age Pensions grow.
Let us, in fact, not judge at all.

And with a temper purged of gall

Telepathic Suggestion.
“The electrical equipment of the car is so arranged that the mere
fact of wishing to inspect any of the high-tension apparatus causes the
whole of this to be connected to earth, and thus made safe before it
becomes acce-sible.”—Railway News.
Supposing three passengers in the car wished to inspect the
apparatus, three didn't want to at all, and one hadn't thought
LETTERS TO A MARTIAN.
MY DEAR SIR,-I like to fancy you pegging away gallantly
at your particular section of the Amalgamated Martian Canal
Works, Unlimited, and still finding time in the midst of these
absorbing tasks for the consideration of matters that interest
us on this circulating ball of ours. You tell me you're death
on Psychical Research, for instance—isn't there a dash of
levity about the expression ?—and you want to know if
we're doing anything in the matter. Well, I'll do the best
I can for you—though I ought to warn you that I’m a
philistine in these things. I'm without the proper amount
of reverence or credulity—you can call it what you like—and
the spirits will not come when I do call them, either from
the vasty deep or from anywhere else. - * .
The truth is you ought to apply to Sir Oliver LoI-3E.
He's a Professor and a Knight, having attained to the latter
dignity on account of his eminence in the former. He can
tell you all that may be learnt about the subject. What he
doesn't know isn't knowledge. You could write the par-
ticulars of his ignorance within the circle of a threepenny-
piece and have plenty of room left for the Kings of Israel
and Judah and the iniquities of Germany according to that
war-desiring Socialist, Mr. Robert BLATCHFoRD. Sir OLIVER
has written and published a fat book. Its price is 7 s. 6d.
(net) and its title is The Surrical of Man: a Study in
Unrecognised Human Faculty. What is this outcast Faculty
which the heartless mass of men has hitherto refused even
to bow to ? It is the Faculty of communicating with the
greater mass which, not to put too fine a point upon it, has
died and been buried. Sir OLIVER LODGE, however, hasn't
lost courage—not he. He keeps pegging away, just like
you. Listen to him —“The boundary between the two
states—the known and the unknown—is still substantial,
but it is wearing thin in places; and, like excavators
engaged in boring a tunnel from opposite ends, amid the
roar of water and other noises, we are beginning to hear row
and again the strokes of the pickaxes of our comrades on the
other side.” It sounds all right, doesn't it? . The mention
of water is particularly comforting, but it must be confessed
that it doesn't carry the humble investigator very much
further.
However, you mustn't be put off by a little thing like that,
you must go on, or rather I must go on for you, and then
we shall discover a vast amount of assorted beliefs. There
was once in our land of the living an amiable and cultivated
man named MYERS who took a deep interest in spirit mani-
festations, and believed firmly that after death he would be
able to communicate with his surviving friends. To prove
his good faith and to test subsequent investigators, he wrote
out a message and sealed it up in an envelope, proposing
to communicate its contents to his friends after his death.
He died, and his friends set to work with a properly authorized
and duly entranced medium. The medium delivered her
message all right, but when the envelope was opened her
version was something hopelessly different from what MYERs
had written.
You would have thought that this fantastic fiasco would
have settled the whole thing. Not a bit of it. They've got
some ladies to take fresh messages from MYERS in what they
call automatic script. Two of these initiates, it appears, have
the power of reproducing on paper what MYERS thinks, and
they do it in the queerest crabbed language, in scraps of
Latin and far-fetched allusions; and then the two scripts are
put together, and by long puzzling you get the authentic
stroke of the pickaxe and you realise that the boundary is
wearing thin in places. Was there ever such a farrago of
rubbish 2 In truth they are worrying MYERs, not to death,
but beyond it, and if the mediums may be relied on he 's
about it much, what would happen?
losing his patience, and no wonder. Less than six months

after his death he was appealing to them “not to break him
up so"; and “NELLY,” a famous, but not a cruel, medium,
said some very severe things about her mother (also a
medium), who, it appears, wouldn't let MYERS go to sleep as
he desired. “You must tell her not to,” added NELLY.
If you want to know more about NELLY and her mother
(whose fleshly name is Mrs. THOMPSON), and if you would
learn about Mrs. PIPER, who is a sort of chief prophetess—she
comes from Boston, Mass.-you had better try to get Sir

“A very easy way to place coal on a fire at night to avoid the usual
noise, especially in a sigk room, would be to have a black velvet glove
made large and easy (the shape of baby's first glove with just the
thumb), and one can then pick up any size piece of coal and place it
where one needs it without a sound. A hook to hang it on near the
corner of the mantelpiece would be a sure way of knowing where to
find it.”—Woman's Life.
How simple! Having placed the piece of coal on the hook
you would be quite sure where to find it next morning; no
need to say to yourself, “Let's see, where did I put that
piece of Wallsend ?”

LATEST NEWS FROM THE HOP MARKET.
This winter, according to the views of the best experts, we
are to be “tarantulated" by a number of new dances of the
most alluring and catchy description.
Old composers have redescended into the arena to com-
pete with their youthful rivals, and the hitherto despised
native-born melodist is gradually coming by his own.
One of the features of the hour is the number of amateurs
who have sprung to fame as composers of dance tunes.
Thus, Mr. Nathaniel Buffles, a venetian-blind-maker of
Harringay, has composed a delicious waltz, entitled “Crème
de Menthe,” and Miss Nettie Tibbitts, who keeps a poultry-
run at Moreton-in-the-Marsh, is responsible for the favourite
“Cluck, Cluck” barn dance.
Of successful foreign importations it may suffice to men-
tion that Moritz Wern, a Hungarian bandmaster, has written
a “Réve de Dalila,” that Odón Klingsor, a Croatian con-
ductor, has perpetrated a “Messalina Two-Step,” and Joris
Sweelinck, of Dubbeldam, a “Jezebel Polka.”
Not only are the names of all the famous heroines of
history being requisitioned, but living luminaries are also
being called into service. Mr. Caradoc Ap-Jenkins of
Criccieth has celebrated the prowess of the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExCHEQUER in his “Budget Break-down,” and Professor
de Rougemont has dedicated his “Yours Truly" waltz to
the Lond ADVOCATE, who also is honoured in a set of lancers
entitled “A Merry Winston and a Happy New Ure.”

CAMPAIGN NOTES.
[These Notes have been supplied by im-
partial representatives of both Parties. Mr.
Punch prints them here in the hope that every-
one of his readers will find among them some-
thing to make the Christmas holiday happier.]
A Great Opportunity.
MR. THOMAS TUTTLEBoy, who has just
been chosen as the People's Candidate
for Wopham, has a splendid chance of
snatching a notable victory for progress.
At the last election the reactionaries'
majority was 8,834 in a poll of close on
twelve thousand. Should Mr. Tuttleboy
wipe this out he will have achieved one
of the most stupendous personal suc-
cesses of the election. He is enthusiastic
at the wonderful opportunity of distinc-
tion which has been afforded him, and
is brimful of confidence that he will at
any rate reduce his opponent's majority
by several hundreds.
The East Willylebone Split.
It is early yet to prophesy who will be
returned for East Willylebone, but it
really looks as if the unfortunate split in
the Unionists' ranks will be the means
of losing a safe seat to the Socialist and
Pro-German party. The patriotic can-
didates for last week were Mr. Rupert
Gubb (U. and T.R.) and Mr. Seaper
Touchwood (U. and T.R.), but in order
to admit of a straight fight against the
Radical they have both retired, and Mr.
James Sporran (U. and T.R.) and Mr.
Hope Billson (U. and T.R.) have been
selected in their place. On Monday
of next week the claims of Sir Archibald
Hemp (U. and T.R.) will be considered,
while efforts are being made to secure
The Evening News man for Tuesday, if
he should be disengaged.
The Pensions Lie Again.
Once more the heartless lie about old-
age pensions is going the rounds, and
once more Mr. BALFOUR with consummate
skill has nailed it to the counter. Mr.
H. E. Bulge, the candidate for the Chiltern
Hundreds, recently wrote to his leader
as follows:–
“DEAR MR. BALFour, -A small boy has
been spreading a rumour here to the
effect that you and all your colleagues on
the front bench voted for the Old Age
Pensions Bill on the second and third
readings, and that the House of Lords
was enthusiastically in favour of it.
Please nail this dastardly lie to the
counter.”
Mr. BALFOUR replied yesterday:
“My DEAR BULGE,--The report is un-
doubtedly a lie. Only a fool would
believe it, and only a knave would say
it, and I have no hesitation in nailing it
to the counter. Yours very sincerely,
A. J. BALFour.”
An Earl's Warm Reception.
The contempt felt for the Peers by all
thinking men was well shown at Upperby
yesterday, when the Earl of Aldwych
attempted to speak on behalf of the Food
Tax and Revolutionary Candidate. The
result was entertaining to a degree.
“Ladies and Gentlemen—(Hooray)—I
have come here to-night—('00 stole the
common from the people?)—That was a
long time ago, I'm not going to speak
about that now—(Well, we're going to)—
A man is not responsible for what his
ancestors may have done—(If it wasn't
for your ancestors you wouldn't be a
hearl)—That's nothing to do with it—
(Yes it 'as; don't be so ungrateful)—
Are you going to listen to me? I've
got my back to the wall—(Walbottle, 'e
means)—Damn it, will you—(Naughty!)
—Ladies and Gentlemen—(That's right,
Hughie, don't you mind the horrid men.
You begin all over again, dearie)—I only
ask for fair play—(Did you give the
Budget fair play?)—Yes, we did—(Oh,
Percival, 'ow can you? and on your
birthday too!)—Look here, do you think
I want to talk to you?—(Do you think we
want to listen to you?)—Evidently you
don't—('Ow bright Little Stanley's get-
ting)—Very well, then, you needn't—
(That's right, ducky, you get along to bed,
Perkins will bring your tea up in the
morning)—But I'm just going to say
one thing; if your beastly Radical gets
in and the Germans come, don't ask me
to defend you—(Ow, mercy, mercy!)”
Pinking and the Elections.
An interesting situation has arisen at
Little Froglands. One of the industries
of the constituency is that of pinking,
and much doubt has been expressed as
to which way the pinking vote would
go. Last week the National Society of
Pinkers asked the following questions of
each Candidate:
(1) Will you, if elected, do your
utmost to further the interests of the
pinking trade 2
(2) Do you approve of State aid to
inkers ? -
The Liberal Candidate has
(1) By all means.
(2) Certainly.
The Unionist Candidate's answers
Were :-
1) Yes.
§ Yes.
After considering these replies at a
meeting which lasted some hours, the
Society decided to recommend that its
members should vote for the Liberal
Candidate. The pinking vote is there-
fore gained for progress.
A Cessation of Hostilities.
The two Candidates for N.E. Sparkton
have decided to observe a truce during
the Christmas holiday, and no meetings
will be held between the 23rd and the
27th. It is the proud boast of Englishmen
that they are always ready to sink

political differences in the face of a great
national festival. But, as soon as the
armisticc is over, Sir Moses Hoggenheim
and Mr. Otto Steiner will be figuting as
fiercely as ever !
The “Voice” again.
“A Voice” was in deadly form again
last night at Craven Ash, and quite
spoilt the effect of the Radical's attack
on the House of Lords. For instance:
“. . . We have been accused of bring-
ing in this Budget from motives of re-
venge. That is a baseless accusation.
Our one motive was revenue.”
A Voice. “Wot O !”
Later on it interrupted with even
more deadly point.
“And while we are pledged to eco-
nomy,” the Candidate was saying, “we
are none the less absolutely determined
to maintain the Navy in a condition of
invincible superiority.”
A Voice. “Yus, I don't think!”
The effect of this was withering.
Shot and Shell for the Campaign.

MOTORBIKOLOGY.
I AM the possessor of a motor bicycle
which is distinguished (as witness
printed documents in my possession)
by being “the most unrivalled motor
bike on the market.” I therefore feel
well within the mark in stating that my
pattern of machine is extremely unique,
and that what is true of mine is more
than true of other motor bicycles. On
the strength of this fact I come forward
as a Discoverer in a science which has
been called, I regret to say, “Motor-
bikology.” My root discovery is: (a)
that no correct estimate of the speed
and running cost of a motor bicycle has
yet been published; and (b) that the
popular belief that a motor bicycle
travels at a speed ranging from twenty-
five to forty miles an hour, at a cost of
less than a farthing a mile, is entirely
erroneous. I will give my conclusions,
and the scientific evidence upon which
they rest, without comment.

bicycle 6,654 miles. Time occupied,

A PRESENT FOR A G00D BURGLAR.
A STUDY IN ADVERTISEMENT FICTION.
CHAPTER I.
“BUT,” said I, stepping rather sud-
denly into the dining-room, “either I
am dreaming or you are a burglar.”
“Of course it is not for me to say,”
he answered, toying idly with a jemmy,
whatever that may be, “but I should
guess that you are dreaming... I notice
that you have got pyjamas on.”
“Have I?” I said.
Asbestos Pyjamas do not shrink in
the wash.
CHAPTER II.
“I notice,” I continued, “that you do
not directly deny that you have come
here to do something naughty.”
“I may be a burglar,” he answered,
“but I am no liar.”
The Boston Syndicate will teach you
any profession in three lessons.
CHAPIER III.
“Burglar,” I said, “I do believe that
you meant to burgle my Christmas-tree.
I could have forgiven you anything but
that.”
“Given 2'' he said quickly.
“Forgiven,” I corrected. “As it hap-
pens I have no tree to burgle. To think
that I am a nephew and yet have not
been given a Christmas-tree, and that,
if I had, you would have burgled it!”
“Say, what you like about your
aunts,” he said, “but for myself I only
dropped in to see if I could pick up
a Christmas card or two.” He tried to
look me in the eye without laughing.
“Let us rather drink each other's
health,” said I. “An excuse like that
deserves something wet. After all, I
suppose that I was wrong. Of course
there is no such word as “burgle.’”
Insure your Christmas-tree against
Fire and Dishonesty at the Moon Office.
CHAPTER IV.

Drink and Enjoy (if you can) Smith's
Non-intoxicant Gooseberry Squash.

CHAPTER W.
“A merry Christmas to you,” said I,
in my cups.
“Thanks,” he answered.
“No trouble,” said I, deprecatingly.
“Nor expense,” he added, sarcastic-
like. “This liquor has a nice golden
tint about it. I suppose there is no
more gold in the house, is there?”
“Lots down the cellar,” I said, rising.
“A man who takes a hint as quickly
as that,” he said, commanding me to
be seated, “ought to take the right
hint. . . . Now, try and guess this one.
When you are playing bridge and you
dare not go no trumps, hearts, clubs
or spades, what do you declare? And
if so, where are they, and is the safe
door locked or only just pushed to?”
“The safe is locked,” I told him,
“and it is only a meat safe. Personally
I should leave it to dummy.”
“No diamonds worth declaring !” he
sighed. “And yet you wish me a
merry Christmas. But I suppose that
every cloud has. . . . .”
“Not this cloud,” said I. “The
forks are only electro, and bad electro
at that. By the way, when I said that
about Aunts, I did not mean to include
Aunt Mary. Though she has not got a
silver lining, she has at least remem-
bered what a good nephew I am to her.
After all, what is mere silver compared
with the kind thought?”
Buy Brumjum Forks and Spoons.
They are not worth stealing.
CHAPTER VI.
“In the cupboard above your head is
the handsome vase which,” I continued,
“was sent to me by Aunt M-"
“Thanks,” he said, rising to go, “but
I happen to be a nephew myself.”

So, anxious to avoid collision,
And feeling death involved a bore,
I acted with extreme decision,
And two-stepped to the right once
In Ore.
That did the trick: his shoulders shrug-
ging,
The pachyderm (a great release)
Departed thence and left me plugging
My wounded lioness in peace.
But still it made my hair untidy;
It seems a shame one cannot make
A simple bag of large felidae
(Such as are found in Afric's brake)
Without this ever-present trammel—
The risk that, from another track,
Some utterly extraneous mammal
May want to barge one in the back.

ONCE more the silly season comes
When grown-ups overload their tums,
And self-respecting babes must school
Their saner selves to play the fool.
We moderns are not quite so green
As our poor parents must have been,
Nor can we view as aught but bosh
This silly Santa Clausy tosh.
The ancient myth's a bit too thin'
I've seen the van-man handing in
All Santa Claus's gifts. What's more,
The bills were settled at the door.
Oh, if my poor dear parents knew
The modern infant's point of view,
And learnt that it was shared by me,
How disappointed they would be
It pleases them to talk a lot
Of fairy tales and tommy rot
And make a most mysterious fuss–
It pleases them, and don't hurt us.
On Christmas-eve they love to tread,
Like stealthy burglars, round my bed—
I never knew what pure delight meant
Until I saw their young excitement.
As stage conspirators they creep,
Poor darlings, thinking I'm asleep,
Though I can scarce control my features
While watching these pathetic creatures.
So once again I make pretence
To bid adieu to common sense
And, just to humour these good folk,
Play once again the worn-out joke.
And this must be my lame excuse
For putting stockings to a use
For which, though meant to be suspended,
The bally things were not intended.

“We don’t know,” he said. “He

Just as I was passing on, the band-

“Hullo!” he said, looking at me.
“Hullo!” said I, recognising his voice.
“You? What on earth are you doing
here? What's the matter?”
“But where am I?” he asked, and
then took in his surroundings. “Great
Scott, it's a hospital' "
“Of course. You're hurt. You must
have had an accident,” I said.
He thought silently for a little while
and then remarked, “Of course. I
was thrown out of the Town Hall at

He began to laugh.
“But you're not a Suffragette,” I said.
“No,” he said, “that 's the joke. I
called out, ‘Down with women' and
they thought I said, ‘Votes for women''
and threw me out. I must have put
the accent on the wrong word, and all
they heard was “women.'”
“What is that you ’re saying?” a
feeble voice inquired from the next bed.
My poor friend repeated the story.
“It’s true enough,” said the feeble
voice. “I ought to know, because I
was sitting next to you. ... I know it was
a mistake, but it didn't help matters a
bit, and one of the stewards broke my
head. And,” he quavered piteously,
“the stupid thing is that I'm a Liberal

PIANISTIC PERILS.
Awful. ExPERIENCEs of MR. BAMBERGER.
THE reality of the perils to which
magnetic artists are subject has once
more been vividly brought before us in
the poignant narrative of the attempted
kidnapping of a young pianist by an
infatuated countess which appears in
the columns of The Daily Chronicle, a
paper notoriously averse from sensation-
assailant. The confusion caused by the
incident was terrific, but by a happy
thought I improvised an intermezzo
religioso of so narcotic a nature that the
Amazons were all thrown into a state of
comatose impassivity, and were success-
fully removed on stretchers by the
attendants.
“I had another narrow escape,” con-
tinued the great virtuoso, “in Tiflis,
where a Circassian Duchess, after I had
lightning velocity we plunged down into
the waters of the Caspian. Five minutes
afterwards I was picked up by the yacht
of the Khan of Khokand, which hap-
pened to be cruising in the vicinity,
but the Duchess was never seen again.
Entangled in the wreckage of the car
she sank like a stone to the blue depths
of the Caspian.”
Mr. BAMBERGER wiped away a tear and
proceeded : “Having refused a duke-
alism of every kind.
That this is no new
danger is abundantly
made clear in the thrill-
ing recital of his own
experiences with which
Mr. BAMBERGER has gra-
ciously condescended to
regale our representa-
tive.
Mr. BAMBERGER, who
was reclining in a sump-
tuously upholstered
armchair at the house
of his father-in-law,
Sir Pompey Boldero,
was clad in a dazzling
kimono surmounted by
a tasselled Zingari
smoking-cap. His clear-
cut features indicated
genius; his brow ex-
haled the sublime.
Mrs. BAMBERGER, a petite
figure clad in a shim-
mering gown of some
soft material, crouched
pictures quely on a
cinque-cento saddlebag
stool at the feet of her
sultanic spouse. When
our representative had
recovered from his
natural nervousness at
the proximity of these
two superhuman figures,
Mr. BAMBERGER began
his recital:—
“One of the most
extraordinary experi-
ences which I ever
underwent was when
fulfilling an engage-
Phyllis (up from the country). “BUT, Dick, Tais is JUST LIKE THE LAST PIECE You
BROUGHT ME To see HERE.”
Dick. “My DEAR Phyllis, DoN'T BE ABSURD.
AND THE OTHER WAS The Grasse Widow. SURELY YoU KNow That NICE AND GRAsse
ARE Two ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLACES.”
This Is The NAUGHTY Girl of Nice
dom in Circassia, it was
not to be expected that
I should accept the offer
of a mandarinate in the
Yang-tze valley. But I
had more than all my
work cut out to escape
from the minions of
Prince Pung, who was
bent on securing me as
the husband of his aged
stepmother, a venerable
lady of some ninety
summers with a singu-
larly lurid past. Suffice
it to say that, at the
suggestion of my faith-
ful tuner, I was
smuggled out of the
palace in the interior of
my Bluthstein grand
and conveyed in a junk
for several hundred
miles down the river,
until it was safe for me
to emerge from my lair.
During all that time I
was fed through an
orifice in the top of the
piano and had nothing
to eat my food with but
a tuning-fork.
“The story of my
capture by Nihilists in
Odessa you know al-
ready. In all I have
been kidnapped twenty-
nine times — a record
amongst living pianists.
Indeed, I doubt whether
Liszt himself equalled
this number. Most of
my kidnappers were
ment at a Court concert
in Dahomey. The performance was
attended by the whole corps of Ama-
zons, with their generalissima, the
Princess Ju-Juba, a superb brunette.
Mrs. BAMBERGER, who was sitting in the
front row, suddenly became conscious of
a sense of acute compression in the
region of the jujugular vein and dis-
covered that she had been lassoed from
behind by the Princess! With a violent
effort she disengaged her neck from the
noose and, removing a diamond-hilted
hatpin—the gift of the Emperor MENELEk
—from her toque, drove it with un-
erring aim through the hand of her
declined her offer of marriage sixteen
times, resorted to drastic measures to
break down my opposition. At my last
recital, while I was playing CHOPIN's
Funeral March, a bomb was exploded
on the platform. The room was filled
with an asphyxiating vapour, and when
I recovered consciousness it was to find
myself in the car of the Duchess's
dirigible balloon, heading straight for
the Caspian. “Be mine,’ cried the
infatuated Circassian. “Never,' I re-
plied with implacable disdain. Swift as
thought she severed the cords that
attached the car to the balloon, and with
Countesses, but I had a
most humiliating experience in Man-
chester, when I was abducted by the
widow of a Jubilee Knight.”
From The East Anglian Daily Times
we extract the following clerical intelli-
gence:–
“Whereas the Rector of St. Giles' has a net
value of about £90 a year, the Vicarage at the
village of Newport has an endowment of three
times that amount.”
A scheme for the official valuation of
Rectors should certainly be tacked on
to the next Socialist Budget.

A PANACEA.
[Mlle. CLAIRE DE SERVAL recommends us to fast for two days a week
regularly, as a cure for diseases of the mind and body. She herself has
fasted for as long as forty days, during which time her brain was more
active and clear than usual; anxiety, worry, care were all suspended,
and she was able to regard a precarious future with serenity.]
IF ills of the flesh should assail me,
If to thache should rage through my head,
If I’m seized with bronchitis,
Sore throat or gastritis,
And ready to wish I were dead;
I know that all physics will fail me—
The days of the doctor are past—
I only desire to
Be left to retire to
My own little chamber and fast.
In peace and silence there
I watch the weeks slip by:
No chop, no steak, no ales, no cake
Come near to make my organs ache;
I munch a little air,
A little light I try,
And day by day I grow more gay,
And fleshly sorrows fly.
When ills of the spirit depress me,
When the future seems dark and forlorn,
When I'm filled with misgiving
And can't earn a living
And wish I had never been born ;
When fortune declines to caress me
And shows me a face overcast,
There's only one favour
I’d trouble to crave her—
A month or two's nice quiet fast.
And as the moments flew
I'd learn to raise my head,
For this great thought with joy is fraught:—
Now I've been taught to live on naught,
The future I may view
Without a trace of dread;
If food's de trop, what matter though
I cannot earn my bread!
No doubt there are some who would quail at
The rigorous cure I commend.
Some people would label
The joys of the table
Life's principal object and end.
Even I, when I started, would pale at
The thought of a forty-day fast;
But the comforting fact is,
With plenty of practice
I've come to enjoy it at last.
Yet every now and then
I feel my courage slump;
There comes a fear that spoils my cheer
And bids the tear of grief appear:
Suppose some silly men
To this conclusion jump
That they have met a Suffragette—
Suppose they ply the pump!
Our Overworked Judges.
A contemporary on the need for more of them:—
“But perhaps the most convincing evidence of all is the practice
nºw pursued by several of the judges of sitting half an hour, or even
longer, every day but Saturday, in order to keep pace with the business.”

DEAR MR. HEDGES,--I am venturing to send you a box of
cigars to smoke during the f stive season. They are, I
think, not bad, and I know that you are one who can
appreciate tobacco when you meet with it. May I con-
gratulate you on vour article on the prºposed iniquitous
diversion of the Charton Road 2 It seemed to me admirable
both in substance and manner, although, if a criticism might
be found, it would probably be ºr upon the lenience of your
pen and your too kind generalisations. But a busy man
like yourself, with a thousand duties, many of them small
and vexatious, to perform (and, indeed, Mrs. Scrase and I
often marvel you can get through it all), and a new-comer
among us too, cannot of course be in a posit on to know,
as I, for example, must, with premises right on the present
road, how utterly unnecessary and contrary to public
interest this step is.
You look at the case from the broad standpoint of a
publicist; whereas I, who have lived here all my life, see
it also as a born and bred Eastburian. To me and mine,
and I assure you to most of the town, this change would be
a blow too severe to contemplate without emotion. Call us
sentimentalis s if you will—-there is no disgrace in that—but
we, like yourself, are something more too. We stand for
what is right and just against the new and predatory
faction which follows Mr. Garner. It is therefore that I say,
More power to your elbow ! -
The cigars, I ought to tell you, are of the famous 1899
crop, and are absolutely ready for smoking. But you
should keep them in a warm place. If you have a cupboard
near a chimney so much the better.
With all the compliments of the season, believe me,
dear Mr. Hedges, Yours cordially, SIMON SCRASE.
III.
MY DEAR HEDGES,-Christmas being on us, I take the
opportunity of sending you a case of sherry, a wine which
is, I am glad to say, coming into fashion again. So far as
I am concerned it never went out, and my father before
me was true to it too.
If you would bring Mrs. Hedges to supper on Boxing
Day it would give Mrs. Garner and myself very great
pleasure, and we would have a jolly evening and forget
for once that there were any troubles or differences of
opinion on anything, or that there existed so trumpery
an affair as this Charton Road diversion, on which I see
you take a surprising and, for you, not too well-informed line.
I wish you had consulted me before writing that article,
as I am probably the only man in Eastbury who really
knows all the facts. No doubt certain persons on the
present road will suffer, but the public good is the only
thing to be considered—the welfare of the greatest number.
Moreover Lord Aberley gives the land, and that means much,
especially when you remember how important is his good-
will to Eastbury as a whole. But this is talking shop, and
that I have no wish to do.
Let me have a line saying that Mrs. Hedges and you will
honour us, and hoping that the wine will be to your taste
believe me, with all good wishes for a Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year, Yours sincerely, RUFUs GARNER.

"As A GRUDGE AGAINST OTHERS, AND DOES IT
CHRISTMAS REPARTEES.
THERE is a painful lack of originality
about the replies to the usual salutations
on December 25th and January 1st, and
the British Public collectively does not
appear able to devise a more brilliant
reply than “The same to you and many
of 'em!” on these occasions. We think
there is room for a more delicate exhibi-
tion of tact and recognition of our ac-
quaintances' amour propre at this season
of the year. Some familiar phrases may
be made to do quite well and perhaps
gain additional point when serving to
rebut the inevitable greeting. As witness
the following brief list of rejoinders:—
Toa Policeman.—“Passalong, please!”
To a Bridge-playing Friend.—“Leave
it to you, partner.”
To a Public-house Acquaintance.—
“Give it a name !”
To an Army Man.—“Pass visiting
rounds,” or “Pass grand rounds” (if a
Field Officer).
To a Railway Employee.—“By your
leave, please!”
To a Member of the Profession.—“So
long, old dear!”
To the Driver of a Metropolitan Stage
Carriage.—“Higher up!”
To a Domestic Servant. — “It’s
granted . "
To a Crossing-sweeper or Coster-
monger.—“Not 'arf. "
To Mr. URE.-"Tu quoque !”
To an M.P. (actual or prospective).-
“Many Happy Returns !”
To a Newspaper Proprietor.—“Not
Too Many Returns !”
To a Teuton Fire-eater.—“Am Tag'."
To a Candidate for Charity.—“Don’t
mention it !”
To a Colonial.—“Bully for you
To John Bull generally.—“Wake up,
England . "
These repartees might also be judi-
ciously interchanged where the assailant
is smaller or less pugnacious than your-
self, and quite a pleasing element of
| ??
surprise and briskness would be thus
imported into a somewhat stale conver-
sational gambit.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE is at least one adjective that can with propriety be
applied to the work of WILLIAM DE MoRGAN–prodigious.
As a mere record of achievement the thing disarms criticism.
Not, I think, that his latest book, It Never Can Happen
Again (HEINEMANN), is quite equal to the best of what has
gone before. Indeed, my personal feeling in reading it was
one of slight disappointment, and even a slight disappoint-
ment that lasts throughout two volumes becomes a serious
matter. The tale is told with all, and more, of the now
familiar charm, but in itself is a poor, unfascinating thing.
Alfred Challis had married, apparently, his Deceased Wife's
Sister, so that when subsequently he fell in love with Judith
Arkroyd he determined to elope with her in a motor before
the passing of the Bill could make him an errant husband.
But being upset out of the motor H
he lost all memory of Judith
(a catastrophe to which Mr. DE
MoRGAN's characters seem pecu-
liarly liable), and returned to
the domestic but illegal hearth.
And, after all, not only did it
transpire that poor Marianme
was not the sister of his deceased
wife, owing to that lady's having
previously married someone else
who was still alive, but that, on
account of an irregularity in her
own family, she was not even the
sister of anybody. So there you
are; though you do not arrive
there without innumerable di-
gressions and pleasant irrele-
vancies, which those who love
Mr. DE MoRGAN's work for this
very quality will much enjoy.
Others perhaps will be tempted,
as I was, to urge the author (in
the words of the old Lancashire
story) to “get eendways wi' the
tale!” Still, a pleasant enough
book, and now that Mr. DE
MoRGAN has once more proved
that such can be written and ap-

Landlady. “I Do 'ope, SiR, You Ain't one o' THEM 'Erbaceous

House, and, from a psychological point of view, the narrator's
evident conviction that blackmail may become a solemn and
sacred duty. As for the Bishop of Lerchester, I frankly do
not believe in him, and should recommend Mr. Brown to
study some more probable types of the prelacy, beginning,
let us say, with his Right (though eccentric) Reverence of
Rum-ti-foo in The Bab Ballads.
Among the saddest experiences of life is the feeling that
one grows every day more and more proof against the allure-
ments of life with a single companion on an island in the
South Seas. I can remember the time when nothing could
have suited me better than living as HERBERT STRANG's two
young heroes live in Palm Tree Island (HENRY FRowdE and
HoDDER AND STOUGHTON). How I should have rejoiced in the
circumventing of that mutinous crew; how gladly would I
have braved the terrors of the shipwreck and the unknown
perils of the land to which the raft floated; with what enthu-
siasm would I have entered into
the making of tools from flint,
the building of the hut, the
cultivation of bread-fruit, the
domestication of wild pigs and
wild poultry. It says a good
deal for Mr. STRANG's story that,
having long since resigned my
share in such delights to the
younger dogs, I should have
been moved with a desire to live
it all over again. This is due
very largely to the discovery that
the desert island idea was still
capable of original treatment.
I hope that Mr. STRANG, having
turned his skilful hand to it,
has not exhausted its possi-
| bilities. Meanwhile I commend
Palm Tree Island to young ad-
venturers, and advise them not
to let the excellent coloured
pictures distract them from the
uncoloured ones, which show
them how to make all sorts of
useful things out of the most
unpromising materials. .
I have not yet got at the
preciated in these bustling days
I hope he will give the lie to his title and let it happen many
times again.
Bold, bad bishops are rather uncommon in present-day
| fiction, though one has been appearing before the footlights.
VINCENT BROWN, however, has portrayed a prelate who is a
villain of the first water. I imagine Mr. BRowN, a weary
| toiler through miles of unprofitable villainy, in search of a
thoroughly rousing plot, bursting suddenly upon the Epis-
copal.Bench and exclaiming, like XENOPHöN's people, “The
See The see!" The supposed autobiographist of The Screen
(CHAPMAN AND HALL) is the natural son of the man who
becomes Bishop of Lerchester, and the plot turns upon a
rood-screen erected by the hero's mother, to which exception
is taken by this militant Low Church divine with a past.
His son has become the proprietor of The Lerchester Observer,
and after a period of fruitless negotiations threatens to
publish “The Love Letters of a Bishop” in his responsible
organ, which is “a power in three counties.” Although
the Bishop feels compelled to resign, the sensation fizzles out,
and there is no very stirring incident in the book. Possibly
its most interesting features are the wrangle in the Chapter
literary and artistic contents of
Mr. ToM SMITH's Christmas publications, for that would
mean the premature destruction of their gorgeous bindings;
but if you can judge of crackers by their outward show, then
indeed ought these to be all glorious within. Of sterner
stuff, good for business men and housewives, are the practical
diaries of Messrs. T. J. and J. SMITH. They confine them-
selves to facts and open spaces for more facts. On the other

“YER DON'T SAY so |

1910 : A FOREWORD.
ForewARNED is forearmed. Thank me
for that information and push on with
this article. Its perusal will repay you
a thousand-fold. -
Forewarned is forearmed. Beware,
you cannot be too ware, of 1910. Dur-
ing your recent past, while dancing,
sticky hand in sticky hand, round the
Christmas-tree, spilling the candle-grease
on your best suit and wondering how
much this show was going to cost you,
you may have tried to forget the inevit-
able future. You may, in a foolish
optimism, even have brought yourself to
regard it as evitable, have even hoped to
escape 1910 altogether by going to bed
on December 31st, 1909, and staying
there for 8,760 hours. This is a de-
lightful idea, but impossible of execu-
|tion. However well trained your servants
might be, it is certain that one of them
would be officious enough not only to
come and call you, but to see that you
got up, long before you had got into
three figures. I regard my own staff
(one charwoman) as a model of discre-
tion and discrimination, but even she
would not let me stay in bed much
beyond April without doing something
| drastic and overbearing. Have I ever
told you about this charlady of mine 2
No 2 Then I will not do so now. She
| can talk for herself.
Nineteen Ten is so called because it is!
the nineteen-tenth. It was pushing
enough to get ahead of Nineteen Eleven,
but not being on the spot at the end of
Nineteen Eight it was superseded by
Nineteen Nine. A little more attention
to business, a little more promptitude on
its part and we might have finished
1910 by now and never so much as
heard of 1909. Think how nice and
dry we might have been
In its number of days and nights 1910
will bear a curious resemblance to other
years you have known. There will be
three hundred and sixty-six or three
hundred and sixty-five of both, accord-
ingly as the number 1910 is exactly
divisible by four or not. That you will
have to find out for yourself. Personally
I cannot do this sum in division, and so
am only going to have three hundred
and sixty-five. Take it for the present
that you are only going to have that
number yourself and wait till you get to
February the 29th to find out for sure.
If you never get there, you can tell that
you are going to be done out of the
three hundred and sixty-sixth day. If
you have not touched it by the time you
are Maying, you probably never will.
February the 29ths do not occur in any
other month than February. Thank
goodness there is only going to be one
February in 1910.
The year will be chiefly famous for
the fact that grouse shooting will begin
on August the 12th, a thing which will
delight you if you are a sportsman, but
depress you not a little if you are a
grouse. There will be a Scottish Quarter
Day on November the 11th, and Fire
Insurance Policies will expire un-
lamented early in January. I keep the
best for the last. In the first place, on
one of these three hundred and sixty
something days, best known to yourself,
will occur the umpty-umptstanniversary
of your birthday. In the second place,
we are going to have fifty-three Saturdays
but only fifty-two Mondays.
For the rest, I wish you a happy, a
very happy New Year. The year, I take
it, remains “new” till about the end of
the first week in January. After that
it is just “the year,” and you can be as
unhappy as you like.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RECEIVED WITH THANKS.
CHRISTMAs is all very jolly (and so is
Boxing Day), but there comes a time on
Tuesday or Wednesday, if you're well
enough, when you simply must sit down
and write to Uncle John and Aunt Maria
to thank them for their kind presents.
It will save a lot of trouble, I think
— not to mention blotting-paper -
if I compose the letters for you, and
them you can just copy them out in no
time; taking care, of course, to alter
John into Herbert (if necessary), and
steam engine, or whatever it is, into
bicycle lamp. And as quite elderly
people hate writing letters just as much
as you do, I'll put in some for them too.
The first Wednesday after Christmas is
no day for original composition.
I. From Archie (10) to Uncle Dick.
DEAREst UNCLE Dick,--Thank you
awfully for your book with Rupert the
reckless on the Orinoco it is a riping
book. Rupert and his intreppid band
go scearching for treasur on the Orinoco
it is riping, Rupert says the tressur is
but a cable's length from us my
intrepped comrades we can toss a buiscit
to it, but Elastic Six the Indian sqor puts
him on a beastly false sent. I have just
got up to the false sent it is riping.
Thank you awfully for sending it to me.
I hope you have had a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year, we have had a
riping Xmas we are just going skating
so I must stop now. I will let you
know about Rupert when I know if he
bagged the trejjur I bet he scalps the
squar for putting him on a beastly sent.
It is a riping book, thank you awfully.
Love from ARCHIE.
II. From Nancy (8) to the same.
DARLING UNCLE Dick,--Thank you,
darling, for the lovely book. I think it
is lovely. I like it very much. I hope
you will have a happy Xmas darling,
my book is lovely. We have had a very
happy Xmas and are quite well. I hope
you are quite well. How is your darling
dog Rags, have you told him about my
lovely book? You must see, darling, that
I have nothing more to say, so I must
stop, mustn't I? Good-bye, darling
Uncle Dick. Your loving NANCY.
P.S.–It is lovely about my book.
III. From Mary (13) to the same.
MY DEAR UNCLE Dick,--Thank you
for your truly kind present which I
shall enjoy reading very much. I have
had many nice presents this Christmas,
including a work-basket from Mother, a
writing-desk from Father, a violin-stand,
and many other nice presents. I am a
very lucky girl, am I not ? I must now
tell you about Christmas. Well, we
had a very nice Christmas, including a
Christmas-tree and a dance, and I think
the children enjoyed it very much
although Archie overate himself and
had to go to bed early. I myself enjoyed
the dancing best, it was a very pretty
d unce, and I had some nice partners.
I think dancing is so delightful, I could
dance all night. I shall soon be coming
out and then I shall go to proper dances,
which will be delightful.
Now I must close as the children want
me to come and skate with them. Hoping
you are quite well, I remain,
Your affectionate niece, MARY.
IV. From Harold (23) to Aunt Eleanor.
DEAR AUNT ELEANort, How perfectly
ripping of you! As Kipling says, “A
merciful man is merciſul to his hot-water
bottle,” and this waistcoat which you
have worked for it is just the thing for
the cold weather. No, I certainly won't
send it back, it fits splendidly. The least
bit tight across the shoulders perhaps,
but it will soon work that off.
We have had a very jolly Christmas
here: lots of mistletoe (not that I care
for that sort of thing myself) and dancing
and theatricals. Some of us were going
to have skated this afternoon, but young
Archie has just come in dripping, and
says that the ice doesn't bear after all.
He's got to go to bed and have hot
blankets and brandy, which makes the
second time he's been to bed this Christ-
mas. Bar the ordinary times, of course.
He says he doesn't mind much, because
he can finish his book; one Dick gave
him, which, from all accounts, is horribly
exciting. They are filling a hot-water
bottle for him; but I'm blest if it's going
to borrow your waistcoat, Aunt Eleanor.
I expect, though, it has a trousseau of
its own.
With my love and again very many
thanks, Ever yours affectionately,
HAROLD.
W. From Dorothy (2) to the same.
(Dictated.)
DARLING GRANNY,+I love you. You
good granny, I fought you comed by ve
train and you wasn't. Pussy runned
away. My sweet old granny, I love you
a happy new ear. Dear old granny,
how is Rags? I dreamt Rags was red
and he didn't. I love you ninety-nine,
Dorothy.
VI. From Thomas (4th) to the same.
(By prory.)
DEAREST MUMMY, -You are too good
to me! The sweet little gaiters are just
what Baby wants when he takes his
motor out! They are beautifully made,
and it is so kind of you to have thought
of it. I have shortened him this week,
and the length over-all will be 23 for that
frock you are making. How good of you!
Baby and I are so happy. Perhaps you
had better make it 24, and I can easily
put a tuck in. The width you wanted
for the bonnet is three and a-half—how
nice of you to think of it ! Baby will
be pleased. He has plenty of socks,
dear, thank you, but if you have actually
begun them the size will be the same
as last time. Thank you so much,
Mummy darling. Baby is grateful.
How funny! I was just saying that
I must buy him some more gloves, and
now you tell me you are wondering if
he wanted any. It is sweet of you.
Now it's no good asking me to measure
his hand, because it's too tiny and dear
for anything, but you'll know about
what size. How proud Baby will be '
Good-bye, and will write about the
things for Dorothy to-morrow. Baby
sends his love, and so do I, and we both
thank you very much.
Your loving ELAINE.
P.S.–-I enclose a letter from Dorothy.
VII. Archie (10) to Messrs. Hamwich
& Co.
DEAR GENTLEMEN,+Will you please
forward on appro., as per catalouge, your
five shilling Latham monoplane, gar-
renteed to fly 50 (fifty) yards for which
I enclose five shi lings (5s. 0d.). It's the
one on page 187 of your cataloug that
you wind up, and it flies. I enclose the
money. Can you forward it at once as
I want it to-morrow, and please forward
instructions how to fly it; I will pay
carriage forward when I get it and I
enclose five shillings (5s. 0d.) (In a postal

Hopping that you will forward this
at once as per my esteemed order,
I remain, Yours affectionately,

[Among the season's novelties in ladies' furs
are a coat of lion skin and a monster muſt of

TIME was, if anyone expressed
A fixed resolve to cross the main,
To compromise the jungle's rest,
And give its fauna needless pain,
The thought would flash across my
mind:—
“This gentle youth is far from happy;
Corinna must have proved unkind,
Or Sophonisba somewhat snappy.”
But now appears a puzzling doubt.
My pity may be misbestowed
On one whose taste for dining out
Is merely martyred to a mode.
The girl will name the wedding morn,
When he enables her to try on
The latest thing in furs, as worn
By every leading bear or lion.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[DECEMBER 29, 1909.
THE MYSTERY OF AN
UMBRELLA.
It was quite an ordinary umbrella to
look at, with a silver-studded bamboo
handle, but the very first night Maurice
brought it home I noticed a change in
him. All through dinner he tried to
avoid my eye, and, when he failed,
began to talk hurriedly about the news
on the posters, and for the first time in
our hitherto happy married life he
retired to his study immediately after
the meal. Mamma was staying with us,
certainly, but that did not explain
Maurice's flight, for he was genuinely
fond of her, and it was our custom after
dinner to discuss some subject for the
improvement of our minds, for Mamma
had given us a beautiful Encyclopædia
in twelve volumes as an aid to culture.
On this night Mamma and I discussed
the Milky Way alone. We had got to
“AstroNOMY " in the “A’s.” But it fell
flat, and when I heard Maurice's foot-
step outside I whisked to the half-open
drawing-room door to ask him to join
us. He did not see me, and I drew
back in amazement. He was in his shirt-
sleeves and his stockinged feet, his hair
was ruffled and his face flushed. He
approached the umbrella-stand on tiptoe,
carefully abstracted the new bannboo-
handled umbrella without making a
sound, and then, with a queer uncanny
gleam of cunning in his eye, tiptoed
softly back to his study.
Full of forebodings, after Mamma had
gone to bed I went to the study door,
but before I could turn the handle I
heard Maurice's voice raised in sudden,
violent anger. He was talking to the
umbrella, for I heard him address it by
name. Then his rage changed to plead-
ing, and after that silence. I crept
away to bed and cried myself to sleep.
Next day was Saturday; Maurice did
not go up to town, but remained locked
in his study with the umbrella from
breakfast to lunch. I had occasion to
pass the study door several times, and
heard him talking to it, sometimes in
the form of entreaty and sometimes with
a wild outburst of anger. In the after-
noon he took it out with him, though
the sky was unclouded, and spent the
evening alone with it in the study.
On Sunday morning he declined to
come to church, and I went alone. The
house stifled me. What was the matter
I did not know, I dared not think.
Mamma met me on the doorstep when
I came back. She was very white.
“My dearest child,” she said, “Maurice
is mad. Come and look at him.”
I followed her with trembling limbs
into the garden, to the study window
which opens on the terrace. I peeped
into the room. There sat my poor
husband at the table with his umbrella
up ! As we watched, horror-stricken,
he rose and began to pace up and down
the room with his head thrown back
staring up into the umbrella, which he
slowly revolved above him.
“We must get help,” said Mamma,
and we went together to Dr. Jackson,
who plays golf with Maurice, and told
him all about it.
“A curious form of dementia,” he
said, “but not uncommon. I'll come
round at once and have a talk will
him.” -
As he opened the study door I heard
a click, as Maurice hastily put the
umbrella down. The interview began
with a gentle hum of talking, then
Maurice's voice was suddenly raised in
anger and a chair fell over with a crash.
I rushed in. * .
“What the dickens does he mean
by asking if I've got madness in the
family?" cried Maurice. “I’m sane
enough, aren't I?”
“Yes, my dear chap,” said Dr. Jack-
son; “but we're all mad in one par-
ticular, and yours is-—”
“The umbrella ' " I sobbed, throwing
my arms round my husband. “Has the
umbrella bewitched you, darling, that
you won't be parted from it, and talk to
it and sit holding it above your head 2’’
Maurice burst out laughing.
“Well,” he said, “it’s a good thing
you've found me out, for I believe I
should have gone mad if I'd tackled it
alone much longer. I've been trying to
paste one of the new umbrella star maps
into the inside of the beastly thing for a
Christmas present for you, dear. You
see, each section of the map fits a section
of the umbrella and will be a great help
in our astronomical studies, as we can
always have a portable stellar universe
above our heads. But the wretched
umbrella wouldn't keep still, and then
I got the sections mixed up—and look
here, Doctor, now you are here you may
as well lend me a hand.”
The Doctor did ; but Mamma and I
retired to shed tears of thankfulness
and wash away the traces with eau-de-
Cologne.
From a letter in Country Life –
“It may be useful to those who suffer by
frosts to know that wood ashes sprinkled over
the leaves of a plant—say cucumber – which is
frosted will be quite unharmed.”
Luckily there are less troublesome ways,
if the need is imperative, of preserving
wood ashes from frost.
“Miss I)ruce fortunately did not have much
plate about, having had a large quantity stolen
while in London some time ago."—Mid-Suss r
Times.
Some people have all the luck. For
ourselves, we are constantly losing our
plate for want of previous burgling.

The proposal has often been made.

in a few days. From early proof-sheets
which have been sent to us we make

It was the Early Worm that lay
Serenely tucked in bed.
He said, “I know that it is day,
But I'll not raise my head
Till I have heard the Early Bird
Fly far away,” he said.
“The benefits that may be gained
By rising with the sun
Have been too artfully explained,
And may be overdone.
Upon my word, the Early Bird
Gets more than half the fun.
“Some proverbs when they are reversed
Are every bit as true,
And early rising may be worst
For me, though best for you.
Dear Early Bird, I have preferred
To wait an hour or two.

Fired by the enterprise of The Daily

AT THE NEXT TABLE.
[“For doth he not only show the way, but
giveth so sweet a prospect into the way as will
entice any man to enter into it.”—Sir Philip
Sidney on the Functions of the Poet.]
SITTING as I did at the next table, I
could not help hearing a large part of
his conversation with the waiter. That
is, after it had begun; but it was a long
time before the waiter served him at all.
He had come in so anonymously, so
to speak, and had begun reading his
book, and groaning, so quickly, that the
waiter, who was busy, had some excuse
for attending to others first.
At last, during a lull, he approached
the reader.
“You’ve been a long time,” the reader
said, dejectedly rather than with anger.
“Yessir,” said the waiter. “Great
pressure of orders, Sir. Very sorry,
Sir.”
“It doesn't matter,” said the reader.
“One may as well dine late as early.
Or, indeed, why dine at all ?”
“Oh, Sir!” said the waiter in shocked
tones. “Better dine, Sir. If we don't
dine, Sir, we die.”
“Well, and why not?” asked the
reader. “We’ve got to die sooner or
later: why not sooner? It's only a
moment in all time, anyway—even if
you live to be ninety. And one is the
sport of Chance all the while, the play-
thing of Destiny, the toy of cruel
Fate.”
“Oh, Sir,” said the waiter, “you're
hungry, that's what it is. And when
one's hungry one's spirits sink. Let
me get you something tasty. What do
you fancy now? Calves' head? Very
ood to-day.”
“Calves' head 2 " said the reader.
“Why not? Any head will do; I leave
it to you. Get me your ‘something
tasty.’”
“Yessir,” said the waiter.
wine, Sir?”
“Wine? Ah, yes! Get me wine,”
said the reader. “Let it be strong and
bemusing. Let it induce oblivion.”
“Yessir,” said the waiter. “But not
here, Sir. Oblivion not allowed on the
premises, Sir. We should lose our
licence, Sir.”
“All right,” said the reader. “Let
it produce oblivion—but only at the
proper time and in the proper place.”
And he turned to his book again and
sighed.
I watched his face as it grew more
grey and weary and hopeless. “It must
be a corking book,” I thought.
By-and-by the waiter brought the
calves' head (why don't they call it calf's
head, I wonder?) and a bottle of what
looked like Burgundy, but whether from
France or the land of the Wellingtonia
gigantea I could not see.

“MARY, Miss SMITH Told Us This MoRNING THAT Eve was given to ADAM BECAUSE IT's
NOT GOOD FOR A MAN TO BE ALON e.
BRING Your work ANd sit with Me.”
The man ate and drank listlessly, still
reading and groaning.
By-and-by the waiter came for his
plate.
“Did you like it, Sir?” he asked.
“No,” said the man.
“Oh, Sir, I'm sorry, Sir,” said the
waiter.
“It's of no consequence,” said the
reader. “It will doubtless nourish me—
keep me alive till to-morrow—and, after
all, isn't that the idea 2 ”
“I suppose it's part of the idea, Sir,”
said the waiter. “But we like our cus-
tomers to enjoy theirselves too.”
“Enjoy myself ' " said the reader.
“Great heavens ! do people still talk
like that? Enjoy—in this world of
despair and frustration' "
“I’ll bring the sweets,” said the
waiter, tactfully disappearing.
“Oh, sweets '' exclaimed the reader
to himself, smiting his forehead.
He struggled with them, however,
and soon after went, still the picture of
WOe.
He left his book behind, and before
he hurried back to reclaim it I had a
glance at its title. It was Mr. HARDy's
new volume of poems.

AERO-GOLF.
A compINATION of two popular sports
is suggested in Flight. It is to be called
“Flight Golf,” played with model aero-
planes. The competition consists in the
attempt of each operator to fly his model.
from hole to hole in a less number of
separate flights than his opponent.
According to its originator, for the mo-
ment there is no need for the more
enterprising of his readers to wait for
any rules at all. We think this is a
mistake, and hasten to supply some
rules, and for the real article, in pre-
| ference to mere toy machines:–
1. A full-sized course shall consist
of eighteen holes from fifty to one hun-
dred miles apart, the holes consisting of
any convenient chalk or gravel pit.
2. The aeroplanes shall tee off from
the race-course or football ground nearest
to the previous hole, the use of pylons and
starting-rails being disallowed.
3. Aviators shall be permitted to
address their machines, their mechanics,
or the bystanders in any language they
preſer, always provided that it is not
calculated to provoke a riot.
4. False starts, apologies for failure of
the motor, or running along the ground
for more than a hundred yards, shall be
deemed to be “foozling,” with a penalty
of the loss of a flight.
5. If the aeroplane lie in water, the
driver, unless drowned, may take it out,
rinse it if he pleases, and play from
behind the hazard, losing a flight.
6. Whatever happens to an aeroplane
by accident, such as colliding with a
tree or chimney-stack, coming to pieces
in mid air, etc., must be reckoned a
“rub on the green,” and submitted to.
7. If the driver or his mechanic strike
the opponent's machine in any manner,
that side loses the hole.
8. In match-playing, an aeroplane
lost entails the loss of the hole, unless
any machine that has started off without
an occupant be recovered within twenty
minutes.
9. If an aeroplane be completely
invested with fog, brushwood, hay-
stacks, etc., only so much thereof shall
be set aside as will permit the player
to have a view of the landscape before
he plays.
10. No houses, growing trees, railway
embankments or other impedimenta
may be removed when a machine is
bunkered.
11. If an aeroplane splits in two or
more pieces, a fresh machine shall be
put down where the largest portion lies.
12. Any aeroplane that stymies
another must be wheeled aside and
carefully replaced.
13. On all occasions a two-plane
match may pass a party playing three
or more planes. ZigZAG.
FESTIVE AMENITIES.
It seems that the mottoes of Christmas
Crackers take more doing than one
might suppose, otherwise authors and
publishers would not append their

This is the time, O Muse, . . .
When man at large looks back,
And mourns the past that he reviews
In ashes and a sack;
It also brings the date,
Unless I've counted wrong,
When you and I must celebrate
Our century of song.
Yes, with the turning year,
Qur hundredth Punchian Op.
Will, barring accidents, appear;
And, if you give the crop
A moment's retrospect,
You'll find on every page
A barren tale of gross neglect
Of duty to the Age.
It is the poet's rôle
The stormy heart to calm,
To brighten up the suffering soul
With what is known as balm,
To bid men shun the base, -
To execrate the low,
And, broadly, teach the human race
To give the Good a show.
Thus, from his purer height,
With deep and subtle lore
He brings them nearer to the light
Than where they were before.
That is the poet's use:
That is his task—and I've
A motion it's his one excuse
For being left alive.
But, if these hundred lays
Contain one song to set
The feet of man in loftier ways,
I haven't found it yet;
If they can show one thought
Of solace or rebuke,
One moral lesson, nobly taught,
It got there by a fluke.
No. From the very start
We have not sought to guide
The reader's morals, or his heart;
Indeed, we haven't tried.
How much he might have stood
Is neither here nor there;
If we had ſailed to do him good,
That would be his affair.
Muse, at this crucial time,
Come, let us take a pull,
And henceforth stick to the Sublime,
The Deep, the Beautiful;
Come, let us build anew,
Reform our readers' lot,
Teach them, in fact, a thing or two,
And show the Age what's what.

Friend (to depressed son of the House, whose Father is giving a little amateur conjuring entertainment). “Buck Up, old chap. It
ISN'T Your FAUlt your Guv'Non 's MAking such AN Ass of himself.”
THE SHADOWS.
SPOKESDY-ON-Ooze is a delightful town
—not perhaps quite so busy as your
metropolis—but replete (yes, “replete"
is good journalism) with refined culture
and polished society. At this season of
the year, too, Spokesby is at its gayest.
Spokesbians never leave their town at
Christmas for the Riviera—can you say
as much for your Londoners? We have
before us the prospect of the Primrose
League Annual Ball and Supper,
the Social Club Whist Drive and Hot
Pot Supper, and a Dramatic Entertain-
ment by the junior members of the
Amalgamated Order of Ancient Shep-
herds, followed by a Supper. Yet with
all these gaieies in view we are uneasy.
Our mirth is forced, our anticipations
are nervous, even our appetites are
ſailing. Across our ancient constituency
the shadows of Jubber and Snooks have
fallen. I heard Jubber first. He was
tremendous : —
“This d. tax on undeveloped land is
the thin end of the wedge. When it is
driven home, as driven home it will be
unless the honest, intelligent, upright
impartial toilers of Spokesby come to
the support of a sympathetic House of
Lords–and on the heart of each peer
is written the words, “The Rights of
Spokesby'—what shall we see? Your
ancient parish church will be given up
to the impious gambols of atheistic
Socialists. Your wives and daughters
will be redistributed according to the
dictates of Trades Union agitators.
Think of that as you sit by your fire-
sides and gaze on your beauteous wives
and sweet babes. You working men,
gaunt and half clothed, will stagger
down the streets of your historic borough
looking with pathetically intelligent eyes
for the work that is not there. Your
great colonies, proud hitherto of the
mutual attachment between Spokesby
and themselves, will leave you with
loathing. The Crown, the Church, the
Country and the Empire, may even the
Corporation of Spokesby itself, will all
be submerged beneath the ignis fatwus
of a devastating Socialism. And when
the German Invasion comes, as come it
will, as you lie under the iron heel of a
German conqueror, the nations of the
earth will declare in chorus, “Spokesby
betrayed the virtuous peers and richly
deserves its fate.’”
That settled me. I was determined
that nothing of the kind should happen,
so I went to Snooks's meeting the ſol-
lowing night with an impartial mind
and a brick-bat in my pocket.
But Snooks was just as tremendous.
“What does this 2s. tax on corn
mean? Pause and think, I beseech you,
enlightened and intelligent toilers of
Spokesby. If it be forced cn you by
the autocratic action of an irresponsible
House of Lords let me tell you calmly,
quietly, and with a full sense of respon-
sibility, what the consequences will be.
Your old-age pensioners will barter the
bounty given them by a generous Liberal
Government for a single meagre loaf of
rye bread. Your good wives will starve
themselves to save the scanty morsel of
horse-flesh, which will constitute your
mid-day meal, for their puny, crying
babes. The wail of the starving will be
ever in your ears. And all the time fur-
coated Peers will hover over you in
expensive aeroplanes drinking the cost-
liest brands of champagne and crying
out, “We have taken the Spokesby
toiler's food and land—now let us annex
his air.’”
I took my brick-bat home with me.
This is the awful problem that darkens
our festal season—Starvation-and-Jubber
or Ruin-and-Snooks. Even if they run
a dead-heat the mayor has a casting vote.
My only hope was in the Unionist Free
Traders; but can they with only six
candidates get a working majority in
the House of Commons? I fear not.
Still the time calls for action. As a
Briton I must do something. I have
therefore resolved in view of the pre-
vailing uncertainty to defer paying my
Christmas bills till after the General
Election.

“Miss Meehan again appeared a d sang
‘Sweet is True Love.' . . . The words are very
nicely strung together.”—Mayo News.
It is all very well to praise TENNYSON
now that he is dead. But what did The
Mayo News do for him in his lifetime?

TWIN SOULS.
NoNE can deny it: when a wanton par
Announces that your boyhood's queen has chosen
To get engaged elsewhere, it is a jar, -
You feel as if the pumps of joy were frozen ;
Yes, Clara, when I found that news, amid
The talk on togues and tippets,
A wet, wet tear descending from its lid
Watered the social snippets.
I thought of all the tâte-à-têtes we'd had
Since both of us were young (and slightly tubbish)
The golden memories of the past, egad!
The times they told us not to talk such rubbish;
Of how we'd watched the lamplight's glimmering sparks,
The cloud-hung dawns together,
And made precisely similar remarks
Disparaging the weather.
I thought, ah yes, I thought of lots of things,
Of shattered toys, of dainties that we'd gobbled,
Of how we'd hankered for the moon or wings,
And most of all how frequently we'd squabbled;
And, as I mused, the envy passed away;
And so, in this poor ditty
Congratulations to the brute, I say,
Blent with a touch of pity!
One that has only wooed when skies are fair,
Flattered your every charm with praises fulsome,
Toyed with the tangles of your golden hair,
Little he knows your temper when one pulls 'em;
He has not seen the sulks, the rising squall,
He has not pierced the riddles
Of what, I think, your nurse was wont to call
Miss Clara's taradiddles.
Lawks, when he does' but still one never knows;
He may be just that paragon of mortals
Who never treads on other people's toes,
And, when they tread on his, serenely chortles;
If that be so, I feel the less aghast
That fate divides two figures
Who, still remembering their childish past,
Would fight, no doubt, like niggers.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-In the poem in your last number, The
Plaint of an Association Football, I was surprised to read:
“And ten stern men on either side stood hungrily around.”
I always thought there were eleven a side. Yours, PUzzled.
[If “Puzzled" will kindly read a little further on he will
come to the goalkeepers. They weren't hungry.—ED. Punch.]
“There has been talk for years about constructing a subway from
the Temple to the Law Courts. When a bencher or a popular K.C.
has been killed, perhaps the quarrels, will be arranged and the subway
be constructed. It would be a great boon to lawyers.”
—Scottish Law Review.
We regret this imputation as derogatory to the high tradi-
tions of the Bar.

RINKOMANIA.
The wild furore creatcd by
the vogue of roller-skating
may be best measured by
the enthusiasm with which
its devotees are taking up the
idea of applying foot-wheels
to other popular pastimes.
The coming Spring, for in-
stance, is certain to see a num-
ber of golf-rinks laid out, and
though flºate-football has not
yet caught on (partly owing
to the quarrel between the
Amateur Tumblers and the
Professional Castors Associa-
tion on the subject of the
back-charge) Lord Montagu
of BEAULIEU and the Hon.
!. S. Rolls are already prac-
tising with a 60-swallow-
power motor-boot at Brook-
lands.
The literature of a sport
is another sure index to
its popularity, and no more
tasteful brochure has appeared
for some time than Rink
Wrinkles, which gives a full
history of the pastime and an explana-
tion of its fancy figures, the prettiest
of which perhaps is that in which
the rinker has wheels attached to
both hands as well as to his feet. It
has been cleverly called the quadrupe-
dalogram.

My dear Mr. Simpson, I've

That unmarried females

If I merit the charge this
must be my excuse,
That in matters of heart
you're extremely obtuse.
You call twice a week and
subside in a chair,
And fasten upon me a lam-
guishing glare,
But the words will not come
though I see that you try;
Oh, dear Mr. Simpson, why
are you so shy?
As you've noticed, young
Footleby fancies me too;
I admit that he can't hold a
candle to you ;
But yet he may win if you
will be so slow ;
I can't be kept waiting for
ever, you know.
Oh, Edwin, for so I may call you in ink,
I'm not nearly so hard to approach as
you think,
In fact, I just crave for the chance to
confess
That the aim of my life is to be Mrs. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
“His memory will always abide with me as that of the
most unswervingly conscientious politician I have known.”
Thus Mr. G. W. E. Russell in his Memoir of Sir Wilfrid
Lawson (SMITH, ELDER). Those privileged to study the
character of Sir WILFRID at close quarters will acquiesce in
this judgment. Honest conviction, possibly to some degree
constitutional aversion from intoxicants, made him an inflex-
ible teetotaler. From early years he devoted himself to a
crusade against the drink traffic. As a rule the zealot who
devotes his finest energies to “putting down" something or
other that has attraction for his neighbours is not a peculiarly
pleasant or a widely popular man. For at least a quarter of
a century WILFRID LAWSON was not only one of the most
highly esteemed but one of the best-liked men in the House
of Commons. In his denunciation, whether of the Trade
fervid interest in their love affairs, or in the account of a
Rugby football match, played with all the pomp and circum-
stance of a public-school story, between Colombo and
Up-country. The heroes, and the ladies who applaud them,
are harmless and nice enough, but if ever I go out to court
the spicy breezes that have inflated so many collection bags
(though I am told that it is over “Java's isle,” and not
Ceylon's, that they “blow soft" in the more correct version
of the hymn), it will be the prospect of meeting Mr.
Tanqueray, tea-planter, that will please me most.
The other day, in the hope of finding out whether real
Americans talked like the man who married The Submarine
Girl (PAUL)—he called himself “Theo Throckmorton of New
York every time”—I patronised the Savoy, and, disguising
myself with a toothpick, a cock-tail and oysters à l'Ameri-
caine, sat and listened to the conversation of my neigh-
bours. And, lo and behold, not one of them said “Shake,”
or “Say now,” or “I guess,” or “Every time,” and
or of what he regarded
as meddlesome foreign
policy, he spared no one,
not even his beloved
leader, Mr. GLADSTONE.
But he was ever so good-
humoured,often so witty,
that his animadversions
left no sting behind.
With due modification
he acquired the position
in Parliament held in
ancient Courts by an
astute jester. He op-
portunely said things
that would have been
suffered from no one
else. “Gay wisdom” was
the happy phrase by - º-s,
which DisrAELI de- - - º - -
scribed his contributions - º
to debate. I think, on
the whole, he was wittier
in private conversation
than in his studied
speeches. For these his
impromptus werealways

written out in his study,
and there was no attempt at concealment of the MS. notes
on which they were written. In the give and take of
ordinary conversation his humour flashed forth with the
added delight of unexpectancy. A considerable portion of
the volume is made up of a diary Sir WILFRID kept, in which
he noted down the course cf Parliamentary events. The
narrative is marked by shrewd judgment and lightened by
many stories.
I forgive Mr. EDMUND SELLAR for putting a bull and a red
parasol into his first chapter, and for making unabashed use
of a knowledge of tea-planting in Ceylon for the purposes
of novel-manufacture, because he has introduced a gentleman
clothed in the mantle of Mr. Pickwick into Where Every
Prospect Pleases (BLACKwooD), a title which ought, in fairness
to the reader, to have continued, “And man is none so vile.”
Mr. Tanqueray (no relation to other literary parties of that
name) is a middle-aged, good-hearted Englishman who gets
into such absurd scrapes that the heart of the reader is
warmed to him, especially when he starts for the voyage to
Colombo, equipped with no other luggage than his eloping
daughter's wedding trousseau. The young people in the
sory are not very stimulating, and it is hard to beat up a
American's submarine,
and only escaped from Popplepoff's myrmidons by submarin-
ing off round the world. On the way they bumped up against
the real original Flying Dutchman, made friends with Van-
derdecken and his crew and sailed in her to Capetown,
where Vanderdecken passed as an eccentric British nobleman
(really the poor peers are not quite so behind the times as
all that), and Popplepoff married the Dutchman's mother-in-
law. I am afraid I am like Popplepoff. I don't see where
the joke comes in. Perhaps I am taking The Submarine
Girl too seriously. But then so does Mr. EDGAR TURNER, the
author of her being.
“An otter was shot at Exmouth yesterday by George Holman, a boat-
man, a boatman, while reclining on a Holman, a boatman.”—Western
Morning News. -
It sounds an easy shot. (Now then, chorus, please, gentle-
men, “Holman, a boatman, a boatman.”)
“GRAND Classical Landscape. By Deleneavit after Pietro de Cortona.
The only landscape done by that old Master.”—From a Catalogue.
On the contrary, Deleneavit (or Delineavit, to give him his
usual spelling) was notoriously one of the most strenuous and
catholic of the Old Masters.

- FA. 9ne, another in their corner seats, they had the air of commis-voyageurs, journeying in great comfort at other
people's charges. It was something in the cut of their cloth caps that bewrayed them. By still more subtle signs I
determined that one was travelling in laces and the other in hose or legwear.
A third person, in the corner opposite to mine, was concealed behind a copy of The Times; but he, too, might be a
commercial, and indeed, judging by a large bookish parcel in the rack above him, I guessed that he should be travelling
in literary goods, possibly some illustrated series such as was pressed upon me in my freshman's year—The Abbeys of
England, perhaps; or Wits and Beauties of the Court of Louis Quatorze.
I am always glad to pick up pearls of wisdom from my fellow-passengers, and when Laces and Legwear attacked
the question of the hour I threw out a prehensile ear in their direction.
“Well,” said Laces, “and what's your fancy for the Elections?”
‘‘Tariff Reform should just about pull it off," said Legwear. (I deduced that Legwear was a Conservative.)
A. but what about the Lords?" said Laces. “The country is sick of 'em.” (I gathered that Laces was a
Radical.
h rº Lords have always been popular,” said Legwear, “and they've only added to their popularity by this appeal
to the People.”
“You may call it that,” said Laces; “I call it war on the People and on the rights of Parliament. The hereditary
system is played out."
- “It's as good a system, any day, as the system of Parliamentary Elections. One would think, to hear you fellows
talk, that the Commons were the flower of the country, instead of consisting of just anybody who happens to come alºng.
Who are they? Men who chance to have a little more money or leisure than they know what to do with: men on the
make; men who want to join a better club than they could get into otherwise; men who like to hear themselves talk; out
of the whole pack not fifty who stand because they simply want to serve their country; scarcely a score who are chºsen
because they are the absolutely best men for the job.”
“Anyhow," protested Laces, “they are chosen; they don't get there simply by the accident of birth.”
“There's a good deal to be said for the accident of birth and upbringing,” said Legwear, “if your father happens
to be a distinguished man of affairs. And if the distinction dates further back there is at least family tradition to help
to keep you right. In any case a Peer is independent of popular favour. He hasn't to lick a voter's boots, or slobber
over his babies, in order to get a seat in Parliament.”
“Which means that he represents nobody.”
“Well, and how much are we represented by our so-called representatives? The minority—they're nearly half the
country-never get represented at all. And who are these people who represent the slightly larger half? What are the

facts about the men that you and I voted for, last election ? We both voted for men we had never clapped eyes on—you
for the Squire's eldest son, who was nominated on the ground that he was a likely chap for subscriptions to clubs and
happened to be a Liberal because his father was; and I for a carpet-bagman from Lord knows where, sent down by
the Caucus. And these are the men whom you describe as the heaven-sent choice of the People. They are nothing of
the sort. The People vote for party posters, not for men.”
“Well, we've got some good posters this time.” -
“Nothing so good as the Chinese Slavery posters of 1906, though I see that you have a fairly smart one to
illustrate the Old Age Pensions lie. That ought to do some useful work among the timid and ignorant.” -
“My dear fellow, if I were you, I shouldn't talk too much about Old Age Pensions. Your Tories weren't very
enthusiastic over that Bill.” - - - -
“They preferred a contributory system, and quite right too. But they won't shirk national obligations. The
real danger for Old Age Pensions comes from your party. If you get in again and let your Socialists cut down
the Navy, good-bye to Old Age Pensions. A crushing war-indemnity won't leave us with any spare cash for charity;
and you can hardly expect the German Government to pay ‘em.” -
“You’re surely not raking up that old bogey P” said Laces. -
“In the first place,” said Legwear, “it’s not a bogey, but just the most substantial object under our noses;
and in the second place it's not ‘old.' It was only born a few years ago, and most of its growing has been
done under the present Liberal Government. There's not much point in claiming the credit for Old Age Pensions
if you neglect to insure them with an invincible Fleet.” -
During the last part of this discussion I had observed a tremor of emotion passing over the figure opposite
to me. The Times was now lowered, and I beheld a countenance of extraordinary geniality and benevolence.
“Gentlemen,” said its proprietor, “I will not take sides in your argument, but I do beg to endorse the view
of the last speaker, namely that a strong Navy is a necessity for the insurance of our Old Age Pensions, Yet
we need a further insurance if Old Age is to be not only pensioned but happy. Such an insurance I carry with me.” . .
On that he rose, and, turning to reach up to the rack, discovered a hump, by which I had no difficulty in recognising
the Sage of Bouverie Street. Taking down his parcel, he undid it and exposed a number of goodly tomes; of which he
selected two identical specimens. These he handed with a very captivating smile to the two politicians, saying, “ Gen-
tlemen, this is my insurance for a happy Old Age; usually of a contributory character, but in your case tendered gratis
by way of compliment. Permit me to present each of you with a sample of my
Öme jumbreb and Chirty-stbenth tolume.

TIME'S REVENGES.
[A straight talk addressed by a middle-aged bachelor to the love of his youth.]
No. Honoria, I am greatly flattered
When you cast a soft, seductive eye
On a figure permanently battered
Out of shape by Anno Domini;
Yet, you'll take it please, from me,
It can never, never be.
Vainly—and you mustn't be offended
Should a certain candour mark my words–
Vainly is the obvious net extended
Underneath the eyes of us old birds;
Nor are we--it sounds unkind––
Taking any salt behind.
You have passed, you say, the salad season,
Growing sick of boyhood's callow fluff;
You prefer the age of settled reason—
Men with minds composed of sterner stuff;
All your mature, now so ripe,
Yearns towards the finished type.
Yes, but what about your full-fledged ſogeys?
Youth is good enough for us, I guess;
Still we like it fluffy; still the vogue is
Sweet-and-Twenty—ay, or even less;
(Only lately I have been
Badly hit by Seventeen.
I have known my heart to melt like tallow
In the company of simple youth,
Careless though its brain was clearly shallow,
Beauty being tantamount to Truth:
Give us freshness, free of art,
We'll supply the brainy part.
Thus in your hands I was soft as putty
Ere your intellect began to grow,
When we went a-Maying in the nutty
Time–it seems a thousand years ago;
Then I wished to make you mine;
Why on earth did you decline?
You declined because you had a notion
You could choose a husband when you would ;
There were better fish inside the ocean
Than had come to hand—or quite as good;
So, until you reached the thirties,
We were treated much as dirt is.
Then you grew a little less fastidious,
Wondering if your whale would soon arrive,
Till your summers (age is so insidious)
Touched their present total -45;
Well, then, call it 38;
Anyhow, it's far too late.
You may say there's something most unknightly,
Something almost rude about my tone *
No. Honoria, when regarded rightly,
These are Time's revenges, not my own;
You may deem it want of tact,
Still, I only state the fact.
Yet, to end upon a note less bitter,
You shall lear what chokes me off to-day:
'Tis the thought (it makes my heart-strings twitter)
Of a Young Thing chasing nuts in May:
'Tis my loyalty to Her,
To the Girl that once you were. O. S.

Ah, thanks. Good morning.
That was the old method, governed
by one consideration only : to get out
of the shop as soon as possible. The
scientific toy-shopper will take many
other things into account.
CHAPTER I.
The Boy.
In toy-shopping for a boy the first
consideration is this : What is the
mature, temperament, habits if any), and

changed the toy soldiers for a box of
rural deans; but owing (it may be) to
the fact that a minor canon had slipped
in amongst them . . . However, we
need not go into that now. It is suffi-
cient that you should realise how im-
portant it is to be in sympathy with a
child's feelings.
The question of what the child is
going to be is of equal importance.
In these days of Get On or Get Out the
boy cannot begin too early the struggle
for existence. His toys should help
him, therefore, to prepare for his pro-
fession. Luckily this is now possible,
thanks to the enterprise of the firms for
whom I am writing. I may mention-

lad to whom this is presented
will find two things necessary:—
(1) Suitable climatic condi-

(2) The permission of the Aero

room, however, is in no way
dependent upon the weather,
though the second condition is
still imperative.
Having taken the aeroplane
out of its shed, the young operator
releases a spring, which empties
the petrol tank over the radiator,
and so renders a flight for that
day impossible. The aeroplane
then returns automatically to its
shed. A short time having
elapsed, the doors of the shed open again
and the aeroplane pitches forward on to
its propellor and breaks the mainstay,
thus rendering all chances of a flight for
that day absolutely impossible. Once
more the aeroplane retires backwards into
its home. . There is another interval,
during which a hammering noise issues

Although books cannot, strictly speak-
ing, be called toys, yet it is undeniable
that suitable ones can be bought at all
toy shops. An overpoweringly useful
adventure book has been issued this
year, entitled The Pirate
Chief. I have only time
to give the briefest
synopsis of the story.
“Mackerel Fiend is
the leader of a desperate
band of pirates. After
a short but fierce en-
gagement, he captures
the good ship Ruritania,
which is carrying bul-
lion from the Cape.
There are 2,198.360
bars of gold altogether,
each of which weighs
1 lb. 13 oz. Gold is
now, according to the
computation of Mac-
kerel's dare-devil lieu-
tenant, Halibut Hopps,
at 21s, an ounce. Hav-
ing made everybody

and his band returned
to London and invested
the proceeds of their
villainy in Rio Tinto Six per Cents. at going to say.

(which is sealed, and deposited safely
in the strong-room of the shop which
collaborates with me) discloses the sub-
sequent life of ease and independence
led by Mackerel Fiend, who took twice
as much as everybody else.
£100 is offered to the first
solver of the questions:
“(1) What was M. Fiend's
income 2
“(2) Will Rio Tintos go
up?”
You will agree with me
that this is just the Christmas
present for the thoughtful lad
who is destined for the com-
mercial life.

Instead of doing that, I will now narrate
a very amusing story.
“Once upon a time there was a sweet
child called Little Red Betsy–oh, so good
and gentle ! And her mother said, ‘Betsy,
don't get up to breakfast this morning
because Grandmamma is coming through
the wood to see you.' So Betsy stayed
in bed. - - - -
“It was a fine frosty morning when
Grandmamma began to walk through the
wood. She had a little hamper on her
arm for Betsy, and she was tripping
along when suddenly she met a Wolf,
who gobbled her all up.
“And the Big Bear said, ‘Who IIAs
BEEN EATING MY PORRIDGE’’
“And the Medium Bear said, “Who
has been eating my porridge’’
“And the Little Bear said, ‘Who has
been eating my porridge?'
“And they all lived hap-
pily ever afterwards—except,
The LITTLE GIRL's Jigsaw.
(Emily's first attempt
at negotiating this
tricky puzzle.)
(Final and correct
solution by Emily
and Aunt Maud.)
I may be wrong, but personally I have
always felt that those toy dogs which
jump make a delightful gift to an infant.
By squeezing a rubber bulb you can
make their back legs move, and in this
way it is quite possible to race them
along the billiard table. The baby will
prefer that you should give him two of
them, so that his father may work one
and his uncle the other. I have taken
part in many an exciting contest of this
nature, and I may say that my dachsund
—my nephew's albino dachsund Fritz is
the longest white loser that I have ever
seen upon the green baize.
There can be no doubt, though, that
the gift of a box of bricks is the one most
eagerly welcomed by any well-brought-
up babe.
I should like to tell you about a little
house called “The Rabbit Hutch,” which
I built the other day. It was
in the Early Norman style,
of course, Grandmamma.”
For the middle of this
delightful and original tale
for little girls you must buy
the new story-book, Little
Brown Bear, by Ernest Tup-
ham. An entirely new thing
in whimsical romances.
('HAPTER III.
The Babe.
In giving presents to a boy
or girl, it is (as we have seen)
necessary to consider the re-
cipients; in giving presents to
a babe, it is our duty (fortu-
nately) to consider nobody but
ourselves. Lucky, indeed, is
the man or woman who has a
relation of less than one.
For a baby of six months,
the best present is a ball.
Generally speaking, this is of
soft india-rubber, big
and round and highly
save the east window, which
was Gothic. 'or various
reasons there were only two
stories; the bottom floor was
the tiled bathroom, which was
used for goldfish, and the top
was where the people lived.
In the suite of apartments
on this upstairs floor one
noticed immediately the nu-
merous facilities for shooting
arrows at the enemy outside
without getting any of them
back; the 2 loopholes were
to be found on every wall,
being indispensable to the
very early Norman style.
There was also a trap-door
in the floor through which you
could suspend a line into the
fish-pond, thus combining old
English sport with fin de
siècle luxury.
There was a castel-
lated roof, supporting
coloured. The disad-
two white chimneys
vantages of such a ball
are obvious; you can-
not drop-kick properly
with it, and if you are
trying to punt over the
chimneys in a high
wind, the gale generally
takes it right away on
to the greenhouse roof.
The enterprising firm
which I have mentioned
once before in these
pages realised this, and
is now stocking some- ||
thing much more sen-E
sible. It is oval in shape,
and has a stiff leather
case; you will see it in
the windows of all their
shops, marked, “For
which from a distance
looked rather like two
cigarettes. A nearer
view convinced you that
this, in fact, is what they
were. Further more
there was a doorstep, a
scraper, and a mat with
Salve written on it. Two
sparrows and a cat
perched upon the roof,
a red-coated rabbit was
at the door to welcome
you in. . . .
And then, just as I
had put the finishing
touches to it . . . that
wretched baby . . . to
whom I was giving
it . . . kicked out sud-
denly . . .

recommend them too
strongly.

OUR MODERN SCEPTICS.
“Excush, ME, SIR, Your Bootl AcE IS UNDONE.”
TO THE FOURTH ESTATE.
O Fot RTH Estate, whose soaring pens have mounted
To a pure height where none may dare to climb,
whose comparison are kings accounted
Nothing, the lords of Spirit and of Time
Puppets that cower at thy deific nod;
The majesty of whose imperieus prime
Shadows the cringing commons like a god:
Thou that alone art strong, alone art free
Almost to licence, hear, oh, hear my plea.
Thou that with tireless ardour penetratest
Through the obscure in such audacius wise
That whispering walls divulge the very latest
And keyholes ope like caverms to thine eyes,
Whose myrmidons, for ever on the track
Of a new thing, with jealous enterprise
Creep up the front stairs or infest the back;
O Thou that knowest all, that layest bare
Skeletons in grim cupboards, hear my prayer.
Thou at whose newsy fount the thirsting many
Absorb their mental viand and consume
Draughts of intelligence at two a penny;
Thou Trumpeter of the Unknown, to whom
Art, Science, Letters, Dogma, and the Stage
(Fresh apple-blossom, blushing for a boom)
Kneel for due favour; Thou whose patronage
Quickens a pyrotechnic flash, and fame
Bursts with a sharp report on even the humblest name,
Hear me, oh, hear! I wince, I shrink, I tremble,
That seek a boon, but not as others seek.
Lo, I am mean yet how may I dissemble
In thy dread sight? Or what that I am meek 2
For, as the elephant's continued nose
Plucks up the pin or piles the squdgy teak,
So to the scheme of thine embracing prose
The least thing does. Yet, O promiscuous One,
Thou in whose ear the faintest rumour blows
Loud as a clarion, thou that, like the sum,
Beholdest all, oh, hear me, lest I be undone !
For lo! by machination of mine enemies
I am entangled in the Law’s dread reach;
They have appointed me—so great their venom is—
Defendant of an imminent deadly “Breach,”
Suited by one that vowed to hold me dear,
And now cries Damage And I do beseech,
Thou wilt restrain thyself when I appear.
There are some letters which the lady filed
(Prudent!) whereat the ribald mob would jeer;
And some poor foolish numbers, far too wild,
Too sacred, for perusal, woe is me !
Then, O great Press, I pr’ythee draw it mild !
Ignore my frailty, that my song may be
That Thou, tho' Fourth, art First And blow the other
three ' -

It fell about the blithe Yuletide,
When the purse-strings all hang loose.
Bill Bowsprit sware by his binnacle
His crew should dine off goose.
As tough a salt Bill Bowsprit was
As ever in brine did soak ;
One leg he had of bone and brawl,
And one of the British oak.
ited was his nose as the rising sun,
: His speech like the sunset-sky,
His hair of the golden tow, his face
Of the brown mahogany.
His roll was the roll of the rolling sea;
Like a sea-cave was his mouth ;
When his right eye looked to the north,
his left
Looked east-south-east by south.
A good hard-swearing man was he,
A fault all landsmen loathe,
But glare or gloom, come death, come
doom,
He always kept his oath.
They had not sailed a league, a league,
A league but barely three,
# When a hurricane took 'em abaft the
! beam
And they shipped a howling sea.
The good ship righted her apace
With creaks and shrieks and groans,
But the bos'n, the cook and the carpenter
Was gone to Davy Jones.
“The bos'n, the cook and the carpenter
Was gone to Davy Jones.”
“The bos’n and the carpenter,"
Quoth Bill, “I well could spare:
There's many a man aboard this bark
Would blithely eat their share.
“There's many a hungry mariner
He was welcome to have took,
But what's the use of a Christmas goose
When you hasn't got no cook 2
“But I'm not a-going for to break my
oath,
Though it cost me body and bones;
So by hook and crook I must rummage
for cook
In the locker of Davy Jones.”
He's jumped into the heaving main,
A ChrisTMAs YARN.
With the salt brine gurgling in his ears
And bubbling o'er his head.
He s waded through weeds and slimy
things,
Through wrecks and dead men's bones,
For all the gear that 's lost at sea
(oes down to Davy Jones.
+
“And if I lets that cook come back
Your vittles for to dress,
First tell to me what now shall be
The order of your mess.”
+ + + +
“Oh, first we polishes off the goose,
But and the stuffing rare,
Then we polishes off the plum-pudding
And the rest of the Christmas fare.
“He’s jumped into the heaving main.”
“And then we drinks his Majesty,
Like every good sea-dog,
And we sits a-smoking of us pipes
And a-mixing of us grog.”
“Now swear to me, Bill Bowsprit,
By all you holds most dear,
When you've polished off the Christmas
goose
And the rest of the Christmas cheer,
“May Bet and Prue and Sal and Sue
Have never a kiss for your cheek,
May your baccy all pay the King's penny
And your rum-keg spring a leak,
“If you doesn't come back to me, the
cook
And yourself, you old sea-dog,
When you sits a-smoking of yous pipes
And a-mixing of yous grog.”
He has ta'en the oath and they've waded
both
Through weed and slime and wreck,
And they've swarmed aloft up the anchor-
rode
He's sunk like the sounding-lead,
And scared the watch on deck.
HOW BILL BOWSPRIT KEPT HIS OATH.
And first they polishes off the goose,
And the cook he heaves a sigh,
Then they polishes off the plum-pudding,
And the cook he pipes his eye.

“They've swarmed aloft up the anchor-rope."
And Bill he fills his long long clay
And lights it with a match,
And his eyes they has a solemn look
As he bids 'em pipe the watch.
And he ups and says: “We’ve eat
that goose,
And the boy is a-picking of the bones;
We've had our spree, now cook and me,
We settles up with Davy Jones.
“I’m a good hard-swearing man,” says
he,
“A fault all landsmen loathes,
But glare or gloom, come death, come
doom,
I always keeps my oaths.
“And we've swore,” says he, “has cook
and me, -
To go back to the musty dog,
When we sits a-smoking of us pipes
And a-mixing of us grog.
“So hark ye, my lads—and I grieves to
