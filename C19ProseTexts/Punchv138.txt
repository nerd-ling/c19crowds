“LIVES OF GREAT MEN ALL REMIND US,” &c.
Now that nations live as sweethearts in a long, unselfish peace,
And the harmony of statesmen's lives is making them obese,
Readers, pull yourselves together; let your private quarrels
cease.
Since the Teuton and the Saxon are so happily at one
And the Dreadnought competition s only carried on for fun,
Let there be no further sparring 'twixt the father and the
son.
Let the mother and the daughter live in unison together,
Since our Sea Lords and our Admirals are linked in friendly
tether
| And agree on every point that might be moot, except the
weather.
As our Ministers and Suffragettes are walking paw-in-paw,
| And the least reproach of either gets the other on the raw,
So let each of us embrace with zeal his least beloved in-law.
Let the snowballs of our combatants be innocent of stones,
Since the Lords address the Commons in such amiable tones
And all possible contention is deceased for lack of bones.
Now that Une and Balfour love to take each other's word on
trust,
And the Stock Exchange and Lloyd-AP-George would share
their final crust,
And the Vinci-men and Lucas-ites have gone upon the bust,-
Let us likewise keep our private disagreements in subjection
And so re-arrange our feelings that the General Election
Be a universal pageant of our general affection.
Ungallant Journalism.
“In the next compartment was the wife of a prominent politician,
off to the Riviera. Her husband, seeing her off, looked wistfully after
the train as it pulled slowly out of the station with its heavy load.”—
Daily Mail.
Well, as long as no names are mentioned it's all right.
A young Greek woman of the dangerous name of MARIKILLI,
having stabbed a man severely at Bacos (where the local races
are presumably held), was sentenced, according to The
Egyptian Gazette, to
“three months' imprisonment only to take effect if she commits
another crime."
“One woman, one free stab.” Nevertheless, we warn
Clement's Inn against trusting to the motto, “One woman,
one free punch.” -
Metamorphosis.
The pretty picture of a lady's face in The Daily Dispatch
bears above it the legend:—
“BRIDE OF RUGBY'S NEW HEAD.”
Mr. Punch presents his compliments to the Bride of Rugby
and records his opinion that, if a new head was really
necessary, she could not have chosen a better one.

THE LIB-LAB LEAGUE.
[A moderate Liberal addresses a member of the Labour Party.]
Give me your so-called horny hand
Here in the enemy's sight;
'Tis well to wear a genial air,
But do not squeeze too tight;
Press me a little, palm to palm,
And not with all your might.
Give me your horny hand, I say,
And you may guess what for;
It is to oppose the common foe's
Designs upon our gore;
I should not love you, mate, so much,
Only I loathe him more.
Strange fellowships, in fact, are those
Our passing needs devise;
But, should we come back from the scrum
Big with the victors' prize,
We can arrange to readjust
Our temporary ties.
Frankly, I do not hold with your
Iconoclastic views;
At times I trace a certain grace
In things that you abuse;
You are too much upon the make,
And I’ve too much to lose.
* -
You'd have all forms of property
Crippled without redress;
While I would not attack the lot
With equal heartiness;
I simply want to paralyse
The sort I don't possess.
You look upon the House of Lords
With murderous intent;
I'd raise its tone up to our own,
And might indeed consent
To serve that end by being made
A Peer of Parliament.
I'd have the Navy not too big ;
You'd have it far too small ;
For you the soil of men that toil
Requires no frontier-wall;
While I am really, in my bones,
A patriot, aſter all.
These confidences kindly keep
In petto (in your breast);
Meanwhile I'll sing that tasty thing,
“The Land-Song,” by request;
I'll join your hooligan brigade
And bellow with the best.
But aſterwards—well, that can wait;
Let rivalries be mute
As hand-in-hand, a brother-band,
We step to the martial toot.
Who knows? We may be spared the pain
Of fighting over the loot. O

LETTERS TO A MARTIAN.
MY DEAR SIR,--Since all the world here is talking and
writing about political affairs, and since, as I suspect, you
are not interested in the iniquities of the House of Lords
or the multifarious and ever-changing virtues of Tariff
Reform, I shall not afflict you with my views on these
sublime matters. I propose instead to tell you something
about a dog who has recently joined my family circle and
now rules it as a dictator.
When I speak thus about a dog your imagination will
conjure up I know not what gigantic canine specimen—
a St. Bernard tramping majestically over the lawns, a Deer
Hound with a delicate step and muscles of steel set to
a gear of almost incredible speed, a noble and massive
Newfoundland, or a Great Dane, statuesque, deep-voiced and
magnificent. Banish these sedate and glorious pictures
of size and power from your mind's eye. My latest dog
is not of that sort. He is, in fact, one of the smallest of
the canine kind, a Pekinese spaniel of high quality and
lengthy pedigree. It is true that Mandarin—for by that
name he is summoned through the house and across the
wintry wastes of the garden in which he takes his lordly
pleasure and his exercise—it is true that he is only eight
months old, and he will grow, but his increase cannot be
great. His mane will doubtless develop and his tail will
become more thickly feathered, but in most other respects
he appears to be already a fully-formed dog with his coat
of red-brown fur, his long body shaped in miniature on
a leonine model, his curved inch or two of front legs,
which he lifts, in walking, with an unconscious sort of
arrogance, and his absurd face with the domed forehead, the
black and bulging eyes and the ridiculous fierceness of his
eminently turned-up snout, through which he snores on
occasion an obbligato of disjointed tenor notes.
A more grotesque and fascinating object never moved about
on four legs or imagined himself to be a terror to domestic
cats. Indeed, the curiosity of the cats in regard to Mandarin is
insatiable. Evidently they cannot believe—why should
they 2—that he is a genuine dog. I have seen two of them
follow him closely along the garden paths, sometimes dart-
ing ahead, concealing themselves behind bushes, and then
springing out upon him a l'improviste to test his dog-hood
and his courage. Whenever this happens he is unappalled.
He makes at the intruder with a perſectly dauntless gal-
lantry. His eyes gleam with the joy of battle; he pricks
his ears, curls his tail on high and hurls himself at the
foe, and the humorous cat always plays into his paws by
galloping away or clawing herself swiftly up a tree. His
nose has been scratched only once.
With the larger dogs of the neighbourhood he is on terms
of a somewhat haughty familiarity, never abasing himself
by lying on his back and waving his paws in the air, or by
grovelling and cringing, but always bearing himself serenely
and even defiantly in their presence. To see him, when en-
gaged upon a cutlet-bone, furicusly growling off a St. Bernard
of some eleven stone to a respectful distance, is a tremendous
lesson in animosity and pluck. We have a Great Danish
lady who is devoted to him and lets him gnaw her ears or
tug her tail without a murmur. Withal he is the most
submissive and affectionate friend to the little girls whom he
acknowledges as his mistresses, reserving for them the
treasure of an immeasurable and almost pathetic adoration.
How profoundly changed is his lot from that of his ancestors.
They spent their little span of life in the halls and corridors
of a Chinese palace. Lying at ease on silken embroideries
or pit-1 atting over floors of curious wood, they accepted
the endearments of almond-eyed beauties or listened to
the strange intrigues of supple courtiers, in whose
ample sleeves a little dog might sometimes sleep. What

aimed against ill-scented and overbearing foreign devils by

nature granted them the hateful gift of speech? But, as it
was, they ate their portion of rice and remained silent and

honourable scion of their ancient race has become in the
vicissitudes of time the darling of a little band of fair-haired,

CHAPTER I. —ONE of THE PLAYERs.
“Do I know everybody?” I asked
Myra towards the end of dinner, looking
round the table.
“I think so,” said Myra. “If there's
anybody you don't see in the window,
ask for him.”
“I can see most of them. Who's
that tall handsome fellow grinning at me
now 2 ''
“Me,” said Archie, smiling across at us.
“Go away,” said Myra. “Gentlemen
shouldn't eavesdrop. This is a perfectly
private conversation.”
“You’ve got a lady on each side of
you,” I said heatedly; “why don't you
talk to them 2 It's simply scandalous
that Myra and I can't get a moment to
ourselves.”
“They're both busy; they won't
have anything to say to me.”
“Then pull a cracker with yourself.
Surely you can think of something, my
lad.”
“He has a very jealous disposition,”
said Myra, “and whenever Dahlia—
Bother, he's not listening.”
I looked round the table again to see
if I could spy a stranger.
“There's a man over there—who's
he 2 Where this orange is pointing.” "
“Oranges don't point. Waggle your
knife round Oh, him 2 Yes, he's a
friend of Archie's—Mr. Derry.”
“Who is he? Does he do anything
exciting?”
“He does, rather. You know those
little riddles in the Christmas crackers?”
“Yes?”
“Yes. Well, he doesn't do those,
because he's an electrical engineer.”
“But why———” . . .
“No, I didn't. I simply asked you if
you knew them. And he plays the
piano beautifully, and he's rather a
good actor, and he never gets up till
about ten. Because his room is next to
mine, and you can hear everything, and
I can hear him not getting up.”
“That doesn't sound much like an
electrical engineer. You ask him sud-
denly what ampères are a penny, and
see if he turns pale. I expect he makes
up the riddles, after all. Simpson only
does the mottoes, I know. . . . Now
talk to Thomas for a bit while I drink
my orange.” - -
Five minutes elapsed, or transpired
(whichever it is), before I was ready to
talk again. Generally, after an orange,
I want to have a bath and go straight
off to bed, but this particular one had
not been so all-overish as usual.
“Now then,” I said, as I examined
the crystallized fruit, “I’m with you in
one minute.”
Myra turned round and looked ab-
sently at me.
“I don't like it,” she said to herself.
“That's all right, you aren't going to
have it. The green ones are for me.”
“Can you eat that and listen to some-
thing serious 2"
“I’ll try. . . . Yes, I can eat it all
right. Now let's see if I can listem. . . .
Yes, I can listen all right.”
“Then it's this. I’ve been putting it
off as long as I can, but you've got to
be told to-night. It's—well—do you
know why you're here?”
“Of course I do. Haven't I just been
showing you?”
“Well, why are you here?”
“Well, frankly, because I'm hungry,
I suppose. Of course I know that if I
hadn't been I should have come in to
dinner just the same, but Hang it,
I mean that's the root idea of a dining-
room, isn't it? And I am hungry.
At least I was.”
“Stave it off again with an almond,”
said Myra, pushing them along to me.
“What I really meant was why you're
here in the house.” -
This was much more difficult. I
began to consider possible reasons.
“Because you all love me,” I started;
“because you put the wrong address
on the envelope; because the regular
boot-boy's ill; because you’ve never
heard me sing in church; because—stop
me when I'm getting warm—because
Miss Fortescue refused to come unless I
was invited ; because—”
“Stop,” said Myra. “That was it.
And of course you know I didn't mean
that at all.” -
“What an awful lot of things you
don't mean to-night. Be brave and have
it right out this time.” -
“All right, then, I will. One, two,
three—we're going to act a play on
Saturday.” -
She leant forward and regarded me
with apprehension.
“But why not? I'll promise to clap.”
“You can't, because you see you're
going to act too. Isn't it jolly?” said
Myra breathlessly.
I gave what, if I hadn't just begun
the last crystallized greengage, would
have been a scornful laugh.
“Me act? Why, I've never
don't do it—it isn't done—I don't
act—not on Saturdays. How absurd ' "
“Have you told him, Myra 2 ” Dahlia
called out suddenly.
“I’m telling him now. I think he's
taking it all right.” " -
“Don’t talk about me as “him,'” I
said angrily. “And I’m not taking it
all right. I’m not taking it at all.”
“It's only such a very small part—
we're all doing something, you know.
And your costume's ordered and every-
thing. But how awfully sporting of you.”
I.
After that what could I say?
“Er—what am I?” I asked modestly.
“You’re a-a small rat-catcher,” said
Myra cheerfully.
“I beg your pardon ?”
“A rat-catcher.”
“You said a small one. Does that
mean that I'm of diminutive size, or
that I'm in a small way of business, or
that my special line is young ones 2"
"It means that you haven't much to
say."
“I see. And would you call it a
tragic or a pathetic part?”
“It’s a comic part, rather. You're
Hereditary Grand Rat-Catcher to the
Emperor Bong. Bong the Second.
Not the first Bong, the Dinner Bong.”
“Look here, I suppose you know that
I've never acted in my life, and never
been or seen a rat-catcher in my life.
It is therefore useless for you to tell me
to be perfectly natural.”
“You have so little to do; it will be
quite easy. You have to approach the
£mperor very nervously xx * * *
“I shall do the nervous part all
right.” -
“And beg him to spare the life of his
mother-in-law.”
“Why? I mean, who is she?”
“Miss Fortescue.”
“Yes, I doubt if I do that part so
well. Still I'll try.”
“Hooray. How splendid!”
“A rat-catcher,” I murmured to myself.
“Where is the rat 2: The rat is on the
mat. The cat is on the rat. The bat is
on the cat. The-–" - *-
“Mr. Derry will go through your part
with you to-morrow. Some of it is
funnier than that.”
“The electrical engineer? What do
they know about rat-catching?”
“Nothing, only——”
“Aha! Now I see who your myste-
rious Mr. Derry is. He's going to
coach us.”
“He is. You've found it out at last.
How bright green sweets make you.”
“They have to be really bright green
sweets. Poor man! What a job he'll
have with us all.”
“Yes,” said Myra, as she prepared to
leave me. “Now you know why he
doesn't get up till ten.”
“In the rat-catching business,” I said
thoughtfully as I opened the door, “the
real rush comes in the afternoon. Rat-
catchers in consequence never get up
until ten-thirty. Do you know,” I
decided, “I am quite beginning to like
my little part.” A. A. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 5, 1910.
LITERARY SELF-VIWISECTORS.
IN preparing a new and complete
edition of her novels, with introductions
describing the circumstances in which
they were written, Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD
has set a precedent which will shortly
be followed in more thorough-going
fashion by her famous confrère, Mr.
Halley Coraine. To each of his epoch-
making and soul-devastating romances
Mr. Coraine will contribute an introduc-
tion of 250 pages, giving full details
of his mentality both before, during,
and after, the throes of composition.
Special features will be (a) an exact
reproduction of the temperature chart of
the author when he was approaching
the climax of each work, (b) a faithful
record of the diet on which he subsisted,
and (c) a complete list of the number
of tears shed by him during the elabora-
tion of the more tragic passages.
Thus it will be found that when
dictating the terrific dénoîment of Tin
Gods Mr. Coraine's temperature went up
to 107, while his pulse could not be
counted. Tim Gods, it will be remem-
bered, is a tale of Cornwall, and was
mainly composed on St. Michael's Mount,
which Mr. Coraine rented for the
summer at the fabulous price of 500
guineas a week. It was written on a
diet of plover's eggs and Jerusalem
artichokes, washed down by draughts of
ketchup and ammoniated quinine, and
in a special costume designed for the
author by Sir LAWRENCE ALMA TADEMA.
An antique peplon draped his opulent
torso, his locks were confined with a
classic fillet, and his mether man was
garbed in a pair of accordion-pleated
knickerloons.
Peculiar interest attaches to the new
and biographical edition of The Purple
Emperor, which will contain no fewer
than thirteen photographs of Mr. Coraine
as he appeared at different stages of the
work, in which the strain on his
physique is painfully illustrated. Thus
while engaged on the famous poisoning
scene, in which , Cardinal Spaghetti
pours prussic acid into the Emperor's
fine champagne, Mr. Coraine's weight
went down to 8 st. 11 lbs., and he was
only enabled to complete his task by
constant resort to oxygen and a special
brew of shandy-gaff compounded of
sparkling Moselle and the strongest
audit ale. The Purple Emperor was
partly written in a portable Swiss châlet
(which Mr. Coraine obtained permission
from the King of ITALY to erect on the
summit of the Mole of Hadrian), partly
in the catacombs, but mainly in the
beautiful Byzantine pagoda in the
grounds of the novelist's castle in the
Scilly Islands. Before its publication
he was interviewed eleven days running
for eleven different papers by the famous
publicist, Mr. Roland Begthwayt, and
all the eleven interviews are now
reproduced in the Introduction, together
with photographs of Mr. Begthwayt
playing temperance bridge with Mr.
and Mrs. Coraine and Lord “Billy”
Scilly, the youngest son of the Marquis
of Mullion. -
The Introduction to The True History
of Sarah Lunn tells at great length the
arduous exertions undergone by the
author in the quest of the fitting local
colour for this poignant recital. Mr.
Coraine not only spent six months at
Bath making historical investigations,
but worked for eight weeks in a biscuit
factory at Reading to master the tech-
nique of confectionery. He then took
several trips to Grindelwald, Norway,
and the Greek Archipelago with Dr.
LUNN, to glean authentic information
from the most distinguished descendant
of his heroine before writing a single
word of the narrative.
The illustrations include a charming
three-colour print of Mrs. Coraine at her
tea-table; a snapshot of Mr. Sheeny-
mann, Mr. Coraine's publisher, diving
into the sea at Blackpool; a view of the
Pump Room, Bath; a sketch of Dr. LUNN
steering a bobsleigh at Montana; and
a pastel of Mr. Coraine singing Sally in
our Alley to the pianola accompaniment
of Mr. Begthwayt.

THE PASSING OF ROMANCE.
[“The English cow has lost the pleasing
atmosphere of interest and charm which
rightly belongs to her—an atmosphere made
up of buttercups and three-legged stools and
milkmaids.”—Country Life.]
TIME was, if intra-mural
Delights began to flag,
I rhapsodized the rural,
And packed a carpet bag.
I left the lures of London,
And, pining for the plough,
Made many a brief but happy jaunt
To study in her native haunt
The captivating cow.
I took (three bob the fare is)
A ticket to a scene
Where damsels decked the dairies,
The daisies graced the green.
Mid buttercups and beauty
I seldom failed to feel
The “lowing herd” proceed to wind
A spell around my simple mind,
Like packthread round a reel.
But gone are all the features
That used to charm me then ;
The cows are common creatures,
The milkmaids mostly men.
The bovine brings no longer
A joy, however brief,

HOW TO COPE WITH CHRISTMAS
INVALIDS.
(By a Specialist.)
THE difficulty of amusing the modern
invalid is greatly enhanced by the com-
plexity of the modern temperament,
and can only be surmounted by great
patience and ingenuity. Much, however,
can be done by judiciously harmonising
the treatment with the peculiar exi-
gencies of the sufferer.
Take, for example, the case of the
luckless individual debarred by illness
from lunching, dining or supping at his
favourite restaurant. For such as these
an excellent thing to tempt the ap-
petite is to clothe the patient in fancy
dress. For breakfast in bed a Japanese
kimono and motor goggles make a
most exhilarating combination. Beef-
tea, again, never tastes half so sweet as
when it is sucked through a narghilé.
Here appropriate local colour can be
Secured by placing a tarboosh on the
invalid's head and disguising the nurse
in a yashmak.
Again, if the sufferer is an Alpinist,
nothing promotes recovery so much as
to lay his climbing kit—boots, rope,
alpenstock, etc.—on the bed by his side,
and decorate the room with edelweiss
and other Alpine flora.
Music, as the faculty are beginning
to admit, exercises a most beneficial
therapeutic influence on most invalids.
If, for example, the patient is inclined
to be drowsy, a few high notes on the
piccolo have a wonderful effect in dis-
pelling somnolence. On the other hand,
if insomnia has to be combated, there is
no more effectual remedy than a quartet
of muted strings or a Chlorale of BACH.
Certain Composers have a peculiarly
salubrious effect on certain maladies,
while others are to be carefully avoided.
RiMSKY - KoRSAKOFF is invaluable in
bronchial affections.
On the other hand HUMPERDINck is
positively dangerous to persons suffering
from German measles and mumps.

DEAR SIR,--I have now waited for
two weeks to see my letter in your
columns; but as it is still absent even
in the current number—which is, of
course, owing to Christmas, difficult to

you can never have received it, and
therefore I have copied it out again and
shall register the envelope.

To the Editor of “The Easterham

SIR,-Having occasion not long ago
to visit Easterham on a wet day, I was
distressed to find that the two cabs
which wait outside the station on the
chance of getting a job were standing
in the wet with no shelter from a pitiless
rain. It is true that the drivers might
either sit inside or stand in the booking

"office” being a good enough term for
M.F.L. (at a check, riding up to Young Stranger who has been right among hounds, if not
in front of them, during the run). “Excuse ME,
SIR, BUT ARE You The Fox 7”
the same place in my youth), but the
horses had no protection whatever. Now,
Sir, I ask you as a humanitarian to do
what you can to remedy this gross
abuse. The horse is the friend of man,
and should be treated accordingly. If
a fund can be started for the erection
of a covered shelter for these patient
creatures my mite is at your service,
Believe me, Yours faithfully.

The Editor of The Easterham Gazette
begs to return Mr. Scrimgeour's letter,
which he does not consider of such gen-
eral importance as to merit publication.

DEAR SIR,-Your letter annoys both
myself and Mrs. Scrimgeour. My pro-
posal was humane and necessary and
peculiarly fitted for publication at this
season of the year. Your decision seems
to me more callously incompetent than
anything I ever remember, and I shall
not forget it. Yours faithfully,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“ALADDIN” (DRURY LANE).
The morning after Boxing Day, pain-
ful as it is for the reaction which it
brings, might easily be worse. We
might wake up and fail to find in our
morning papers the annual statement,
gaudily embroidered, that the Manage-
ment of Drury Lane had once more sur-
passed itself. Happily this tragedy has
never yet occurred within the memory
of the oldest inhabitant; but if ever
such a day should dawn for England
it would be the beginning of the end,
and the Germans might come as soon
as they care to. There seems, however,
no immediate risk; for Mr. ARTHUR
CoLLINs has left himself a very bright
chance of improving on this year's
pantomime, at any rate in the matter of
novelty. It is really an extraordinary
thing that Mr. WilkiE BARD should have
been given no better clou than the old
one of last year; that he should again,
and twice over at each performance, be
found trying to teach his audience to
sing after him; and that, too, after
this faded novelty has been further
staled, as I understand, at a Music-hall.
Truly, a British pantomime audience is
not hard to please. And to sit and watch
its fat and stolid satisfaction is to under-
stand something of that immunity from
ideas, and from the very desire for ideas,
which has made us, as a nation, what we
are. For the stalls of Drury Lane are
surely an epitome of those middle classes
of which the backbone of the country is
constructed. I would hazard that that
quiet and observant humourist, Mr. BARD,
gets almost as much fun from the study
of his audience as they get from him—
which means a very great deal.

Miss MARIE GEORGE.
MR. GEORGE GRAves.
Changes seem to have come over the
spirit of pantomime. One misses the
burlesque of manners and vogues; one
misses the Aristophanic flavour so
proper to a democracy. I could only
catch one political allusion (Mr. CHURCHILL
was chosen for that honour), and its
unique intrusion saved a very dull song
about a barometer, by pretty Miss RENé,
from being a frost. No doubt the
omission is made out of deference to
the impending crisis. Of bad puns
there was a pleasant lack; and I was
content to be spared the rough-and-
tumble phase of humour. But I should
have liked a little more piquancy in the
lyrics. Legs, though admittedly tanta-
mount to human nature, seem to have
gone out of fashion, and the pas seul
with them. As for the concerted
dances, they tend to sacrifice rhythm
to intricacy. The dresses and the
scenery show a closer study of harmony
in line and colour, but the note of
barbaric splendour is still too insistent
and the eye is seldom allowed to rest.
I think perhaps the total sum of
change is not for the worse. If the fun
is less boisterous, and the house hardly
ever rocks to its foundations, the level
of humour is more equably sustained
and there are very few intervals of
absolute dulness. Now and then an
inveterate wheeze occurred, such as that
of the “whereabouts” that went to the
wash, or the rather long story of the
boots that disturbed the invalid in the
flat below. On the other hand there
was freshness in the duologues between
Mr. GEORGE GRAVES and his fluttering
heart. Of the two leading comedians
he had much the harder task; but he
went through it nobly. I judged,
however, of the strain that was put
upon his invention by the number of
times he removed and replaced his hats.
I think it must have run to four figures.
Miss MARIE GEORGE had no particular
chance, but she took what there was
with her customary lightness of heart.
I could have done with much more
dog, for Mr. GEORGE ALI is very perfect
in this character, and the way in which
he went for a live cat that strolled on by
the footlights proved how thoroughly he
had divested himself of his last year's
rôle in the service of Dick Whittington.
But, as some critic has very properly
pointed out, the dog has no locus standi
in the story of Aladdin.
Finally, I know that if I had a spark
of the right critical spirit in me, I
should say that Miss TRULY SHATTUCK
“made a superb Prince Pekoe,” but I
shan’t. I have met many men —less
superb, I grant—who could have looked
much more like a Prince than she did.
What remaining compliments I have at
my disposal I shall assign to the joint
authors of an entertaining book that
was creditably free of vulgarity; to the
painters of the Pekin scenes; to Mr.
GLovER for some bright music which
never failed to get itself heard; and to
whoever it was who thought of making
real people bathe in a cinematographic
seascape. O. S

makes it clear that the house of Tem-
perley is in danger of falling, owing to
the extravagance of its master, who has
lost thousands at cards to Devil Hawker.
Seconded by his mother, the Temperley
Pet (Mr. BEN WEBSTER) makes up to his
| rich cousin, Ethel. His young brother,
| Captain Jack, is also staying at Tem-
|perley Manor, but on this occasion he
‘draws a bye, for Ethel accepts Sir Charles
in order to save the house. Imme-
diately afterwards she discovers that her
secret love for Jack is indeed returned.
It is too late, however—she is affianced
to another.- They clinch and break
away, Ethel feinting. Jack returns
to his corner, having first extracted a
promise from Charles that for the girl's
sake he will give up cards and dice.
Round II.-Devil Hawker jumps into
the ring. Will Sir Charles cut him at
cards for a thousand guineas a cut 2 Sir
Charles will. They begin, and Sir John
is just getting in a very nasty upper cut
when Jack reminds his brother of his
promise. The Temperley Pet apologises
and side-steps. But it appears that
Sir John has not been using a straight
left by any means—in fact he has been
marking the edges of the Kings when
pretending to shuffle. One Jakes, a
bookmaker, lands upon the mark, but
agrees to be silent if paid sufficiently
well. Charles takes the ring again and
fixes up a sporting wager with his
opponent—a fight between Sir John's
nominee and his own. The claret is
tapped and healths are drunk.
Round III.-Sir John again hits
below the belt. He kidnaps Charles's
man at the last moment. The fight will
be off and Charles will have to pay
forfeit. But no, brother Jack will take
the absent one's place, and fight for
glory and the House of Temperley. He
does so with great success.
Round IV. —Jakes exposes Devil
Hawker, who is counted out of the Club,
and throws up the sponge. Sir Charles
then saves his brother's life at the
expense of his own, in order that Jack
should marry Ethel. Time!
That is the story of the play, but
of course the great attractions are the
two incidental fights—one with gloves,
in the Second Act, and one without,
in the Third. These are splendidly
stage-managed, and should be seen by
everybody. To the fighters, Messrs.
CHARLES MAUDE, EDMUND GwenN, A. S.
Homewood, and REGINALD DAvis, I offer
my congratulations—they were delight-
fully in earnest. Much of the acting by

say that she too is conscious of her good
fortune.

A question which has often been
asked but never answered—and the
repetition of which would seem to be
very distasteful to the official ear—is
what has become of the statue of Lord
Wigram which used to stand at the
corner of Pulteney Place. One day it
was there, and the next it had dis-
appeared. It is significant that the
removal occurred not very long after
the publication of a motorious book of
reminiscences of a scandalous type, in
which Lord Wigram played no small
part, and that the house in Pulteney
Place nearest to the statue is inhabited
by one of the straightest-laced of the
leaders of Society.

The profusion of diamonds worn by
a certain queen of musical comedy is
a continual source of curiosity to many
of her admirers who are unaware of
the secret marriage that she recently
contracted with an exalted personage of
foreign extraction. Those who know,
however, have nothing but felicitations
to offer.

A recent advertisement in The Times
emanating from an address in the West
End, and announcing the loss of a black
poodle, a reward being offered for his
return, may have worn to the casual eye
an innocent enough air; but those who
are in the know are smiling at the
success of the ruse, especially when they
read of the enormous haul which those
responsible for the recent burglary at
Foston Magna succeeded in making.

DEAR Jack, the book of verses
You borrowed yesteryear
Came back to-night by Parcel Post,
And I was grieved to find it most
Distinctly worse for wear.
On each white page there lingers
A blob of something dark
From your much-moistened fingers—
John Jones, his mess and mark.
And so it gives me pleasure
To think how folk affirm
That, when the turning finger-tips
Have previously sought the lips,
They gather up the germ.
No deadly germ I wish you;
May one of milder mould
Torment you with “a-tishoo.”
I hope you have a cold.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
In the Grip of the Nyika (MACMILLAN), is the name of
Colonel PATTERSON's new diary of sporting adventures in East
Africa, but it was really the Nyika that was in the grip of
Colonel PATTERSON, so firmly does the gallant author seem to
have grappled with the wilderness and its astounding fauna,
to say nothing of the unruly members of his caravan. Life
“on safari” in the Northern Game Reserve, for which
Colonel PATTERSON set out to fix an official boundary on the
East, may not differ very greatly from itself one day with
another, but it does not make for monotony. With lions
occurring at almost any moment, and with a constant stream
of charging rhinos, nobody need be really dull in these
parts; and should the more offensive beasts be engaged
elsewhere there are always kongoni, or impala, or wildebeeste
or eland or oryx or antelope to play with ; or you may
stalk JACKSON's harte--
beeste, or Coke's; or
Avonlea School whose quaintnesses, whether they behave
as “limbs” or as budding laureates, are a mixture of
distraction and joy to their elders. Anne herself retains,
along with her old quality of romantic imagination, her no
less charming liability to awkward and amusing scrapes,
as, for instance, when she falls through the roof of an
outhouse up to her arms, and (whilst waiting to be rescued)
composes a “garden idyll.” It will be seen also from the
portrait on the cover that her hair has somehow gained that
earnestly desired shade of auburn, and is no longer the
“life-long sorrow " she announced it to be in her childhood,
so that, all things considered, Gilbert Blythe will be con-
gratulated as a very fortunate young man by anyone who is
not too jealous.

at every turn of the

of his travelling companions diverted the charge of a furious
rhino by “shooing ” her umbrella—her only weapon at the
moment—right in the brute's face; a simple expedient
often adopted, with less happy results, in the attempt to
arrest the progress of a motor-bus.
If there is anyone whom the lavish display of agricultural
produce in emigration office windows has failed to convince
that Canada is a land flowing with milk and honey, he
should read Anne of Avonlea (Pitman), and learn that there
is at least one settled portion of the Dominion where life
runs as sweetly as maple sugar. Anne, of course, lives
at Green Gables with Marilla, and if L. T. MontgomeRY
has not been able to make her quite so charming at “half
past sixteen” as she was at eleven, her experiences as a
school marm and as the mentor (if a girl can be a mentor)
of Davy and Dora (Marilla's newly-adopted twins) are quite
worthy to be compared with the days when she so
unfortunately dyed her red tresses green. For Davy is
a lineal descendant of that Western child-race that began
with Toddy and Budge, and there are many other children at

humour of it is by now not so good as it was at first. (Mr.

A LAMENT FOR KING PANTOMIME.
[“So far as we can observe the tendency of the time, the old-fashioned
pantomime is on its last legs; and, naturally, we mean by the old-
fashioned pantomime the Harlequinade, with its attendant spirits of
Clown and Columbine, Harlequin and Pantaloon . . All praise to
Mr. Barrie, who began the beneficent revolution by devising his im-
mortal hero, Peter Pan.”—Daily Telegraph.]
ONCE more, ye laurels, and once more,
Ye myrtles brown (see MILTON's Lycidas),
Your mournful help I must implore.
Let all enjoyment be dismisséd as
I drain the cup of sorrow to the dregs
For one who's on his last expiring legs.
Anticipating that sad day
When nought is left us but his phantom, I'm
Constrained to pen a funeral lay
In honour of our lord, King Pantomime.
To think that, one fine Christmas, all in vain
We'll listen for his “Here we are again!”
From boyhood I've been wont to make
Unto his court an annual pilgrimage;
And little did I think to break
This venerable custom till grim age,
Laying his chilly finger on my chest,
Disabled me from chuckling at a jest.
For years, past all remembering,
I’ve joined with fervour in his revelry,
Allowed my sentiments full fling,
Roared at the Clown's amazing devilry,
And nearly died with laughter when he met
The abandoned baby in the bassinette.
Then, when the Harlequin appeared,
How eagerly we'd crane our necks to see
The Pantaloon's devices queered,
And with what undiluted ecstasy
We'd lay our fulsome tributes at the shrine
Of that entrancing fay, the Columbine!
But what avails it to recall
Joys that were destined for eternity
Had not our youth been seized in thrall
By that strange spirit of modernity
Which frowns upon the sausage-stealing joker
And sees no humour in the red-hot poker?
So let us tearfully prepare
A royal wake, and, inter alia,
Summon the mirthful monarch's heir
To don His Majesty's regalia;
And, when our King has fully served his time,
Proclaim, “Long live King Peter Pantomime!”

THE PATRIOT AT THE POLLS.
My Countrymen' Upon the eve
Of such a fight as I believe
Will most severely test your moral sinew,
Each man of you (if I am right)
Will hold aloof from party spite,
And act according to the light
- Latent within you.
Yes, if I know your ways of old,
You will distinguish dross from gold
By just the gleam of those internal tapers;
No private aims, no egoist views
Will blur your conscience or confuse
That blessed spark when you peruse
Your ballot-papers.
Though selfishly you may incline
To have Britannia rule the brine
And never, never be a Kaiser's slavey,
Yet if you feel, deep in your breast,
This latter state would suit her best,
You'll vote at conscience's request
Against a Navy.
So, if you find the Budget good,
If to your sense of brotherhood
It seems a lovely thing, a dream of beauty,
The fact that you are fond of beer
And think the stuff is far too dear—
You'll never let that interfere,
But do your duty.
And if, upon the other hand,
Your soul abhors the tax on land
As tending to facilitate our ruin,
Then, though your neighbour (whom you hate)
Happens to own a large estate,
You'll tell the Liberal candidate,
“We can't have you in!”
If in your inmost heart you know
The Second Chamber ought to go,
Vote like a man for calling in the wrecker;
Don't let the thought that, if you scored
Your many virtues' just reward, -
You would, in time, be made a lord,
Weaken your pecker.
You'll vote as Right and Reason bid,
Not just the way your father did,
Nor go by what your leader (B. or A.) says;
You'll track the Truth—the trail is stiff–
And never turn your nose to sniff
The red, red herring's devious whiff
Crossing her traces.

THE DUTY OF WORKING MEN.
Stirring Appeal by Famous Novelist.
MR. Hewlett TAKEs to THE OPEN CouxTRY.
WE publish below in its original form the rough draft of
the appeal to the working men of England from Mr. MAURICE
HEWLETT, the famous novelist. Mr. Hewlett is only one of
several distinguished writers who have boldly leaped into
the arena at this great crisis in the affairs of the nation. The
notorious charm of his literary style, it will be observed, is
not at all submerged in the force and directness of this
clarion call to action :-
“Let me say that I belong to no recognised political party,
unless it be the party per pale. I am neither Socialist,
Liberal, nor Conservative, Fabian nor Fontarabian, but a
straight-cut, bouncing, belligerent working man; no chopper
of chirpy paradoxes, but a swart-haired, sanguine, square-
built, sloe-eyed, and square-chinned Salamander! Ay, and
a working-man who reasonably desires to see his class get its
rights. - - . .
I intend, then, to vote for anyone who will help me in
those things which I want to see settled by law.
What, then, gentlemen, do we want, as workmen, hus-
bands, and fathers of families, out of the Parliament which
we are going to choose?
(1) That every Hodge-King should have at least one
white-and-green surcoat, one gold baldrick, one suit of plain
black mail, three white palfreys and a milch cow.
(2) That no labourers' cottages shall henceforth be builded
without having each a buttery hatch, an outer bailey, and a
phalanstery hung with black arras. -
(3) That all and sundry, irrespective of social status,
shall be christened by names likely to voice their inherent
claims to natural respect. I believe that access to a romantic
nomenclature is absolutely necessary to every honest and
able member of the state. Names like Mellifont, Pietosa,
Malise, Spiridion, Osric, and Fulk should no longer be the
monopoly of orgulous lordlings, but be available for every
working-man, Heaven help us, like you and me.
(4) That heraldry should be a compulsory subject in all
provided schools.
. . . All this vapouring and stressful blustering about
Empire and All Red maps is the most ineffable Panjandrum-
blather that was ever exuded from the limbo of a pseudo-
Goliardic gallimaufry. The only All-Red colour that counts
is the bloom of healthy blood in the ruddy cheeks of some
dark woodland elf. . . . -
The so-called Colonies are of no commercial value what-
ever to us, and only a source of interminable chaffering.
There is no more danger from the GERMAN EMPEROR than
from the Soldan of Babylon. . . .
There, gentlemen, that's all I have to say. But I hope
you will not ask me what it means, or what the moral of it
should be. My sole affair is to put the argument dispas-
sionately. Every man must seek his salvation in his own
way; and what I mean precisely by salvation is of little
account save to inarticulate theologians. I have achieved my
own personal, particular thrill. I have clouted the Tory dogs
in the big bowwow style with my own big stick. Erplicit
liber ineptiarum mearum. O tempora, O Maurice Houp-lä.”
“The religious convictions of one prisoner could not be ascertained
as he was unfortunately suffering from de irium tremens.”
This hardy annual from Whitaker's Almanack distresses us
afresh every year we read it. Surely in all this time the
sufferer must have had one lucid moment in which he might
have been tempted to reveal the great secret. Incidentally
we may say that the “previous convictions” of the prisoner
would make a more useful document.

CHAPTER II.--ALARMS AND Excursions.
I was, I confess, very late the next
morning even for a rat-catcher. Mr.
Derry was in the middle of his break-
fast; all the others had finished. We
saluted, and I settled down to work.
“There is going to be a rehearsal at
eleven o'clock, I believe,” said Derry.
“It must be nearly that now.”
“I shall be there,” I said, “if I have
to bring the marmalade with me.
You're going to coach us?”
“Well, I believe I said I would.”
“Though I have never assumed the
buskin myself,” I went on, “I have of
course heard of you as an amateur
actor.” (Liar) “And if you could tell
me how to act while I am finishing my
bacon I should be most awfully obliged.”
“Haven't you really done any ?”
“Only once, when I was very small.
I was the heroine. I had an offer, but
I had to refuse it. I said, ‘Alath, dear
heart, I may not, I am married already.’”
“Very right and proper,” murmured
Derry.
“Well, as it turned out, I had made a
mistake. It was my first who had been
married already. The little play was
full of surprises, like.”
Derry coughed and began to fill his
pipe. “Let me see,” he began; “what's
your part?”
“I am a-er—a rodent collector.”
“Oh, yes—the Emperor's rat-catcher.”
“Grand hereditary,” I said, stiffly.
“It has been in the family for years.”
“Quite so.”
I was about to enlarge upon the
advantages of the hereditary principle
when the door opened suddenly to
admit Myra and Archie.
“You don't say you're down at last!”
said Myra, in surprise.
“I hardly say anything at breakfast
as a rule,” I pointed out.
“What an enormous one you're
having. And only last night * >
“On the contrary, I'm eating practi-
cally nothing. A nut and one piece of
parsley off the butter—the fact is, I
glanced at my part before I went to
bed, and there seemed such a lot of it,
I hardly slept at all.”
“Why, you don't come on very much,”
said Archie. “Neither do I. I'm a
conjurer. Can any gentleman here oblige
me with a rabbit? . . . No, Sir, I said
a rabbit. Oh, I beg your pardon, I
thought you were coming up on to the
stage . . . Any gentleman—”
“Have some jam instead. What do
you mean by saying I don't come on
very much " I took the book out of
my pocket and began to turn the leaves.
“Here you are, nearly every page—
‘Enter R.,’—‘Exit I?.,’—‘Enter L.,'—I
don’t know who he is—‘Eaceunt R.,’—
why, the rat-catcher's always doing some-
thing. Ah, here they're more explicit
—‘Enter R.C.' Hallo, that's funny,
because I’d just—— Oh, I see.”
“One of our oldest and most experi-
enced mimes,” said Archie to Derry.
“You must get him to talk to you.”
“No secret of the boards is hid from
him,” added Myra.
“Tell us again, Sir, about your early
struggles,” begged Archie.
“He means your early performances
on the stage,” explained Myra.
“There's one very jolly story about
ELLEN TERRY and the fire-proof curtain.
Let me see, were you Macbeth then, or a
Noise of Trumpets 2 I always forget.”
I drank my last cup of tea and rose
with dignity.
“It is a humorous family,” I apolo-
gised to Derry. “Their grandfather
was just the same. He would have his
little joke about the first steam engine.”
Outside in the hall there was a large
crowd of unemployed all talking at once.
I caught the words “ridiculous” and
“rehearsal,” and the connection between
the two seemed obvious and frequent.
I singled out Thomas, abstracted his
pouch, and began to fill up.
“What is all this acting business?”
I asked. “Some idea about a little play,
what ? Let's toddle off and have a
game of billiards.”
“They've let me in for a bally part,”
said Thomas, “alid you needn't think
you're going to get out of it. They’ve
got you down all right.”
“Thomas, I will be frank with you.
I am no less a person than the Emperor
Bong's Hereditary (it had been in the
family for years) Grand Rat-catcher.
The real rush, however, comes in the
afternoon. My speciality is young ones.”
“I’m his executioner.”
“And he has a conjurer too. What a
staff' Hallo, good morning, Simpson.
Are you anything lofty 2"
“Oh, I am the Emperor Bong,” said
Simpson gaily; “I am beautiful, clever
and strong * ,
“Question,” said Thomas.
“'Tis my daily delight to carouse and to
fight, and at moments I burst into song.”
I looked at him in amazement.
“Well, just at present,” I said, “all
I want is a match . . . A lucifer, Emp.
Thanks . . . Now tell me—does any-
body besides yourself burst into song
during the play ? Any bursting by
Thomas or myself, for instance?”
“Nobody sings at all. My little poem
is recitative.”
“If you mean it's very bad, I agree
with you,” said Thomas.
“I made it up myself. It was thought
that my part should be livened up a
little.” -
“Well, why hasn't it been 2"
“If you will give me two minutes,
Simpson,” I said, “I will liven up my
own part better than that. What rhymes
with rat-catcher?”
“Cat-catcher.”
“Wait a bit. . . Yes, that's got it.
“‘Oll, I'm on the Emperor's staff
I'm a rodent-collector (don't laugh)-
My record (in braces)
Of rats and their races
Is a thousand and eight and a half.’”
“May we have that again?” said
Myra, appearing suddenly.
“‘Oh, I'm on——’”
“No,” said Thomas.
“‘Oh, I'm on x * x
“No,” said Simpson.
“There is no real demand, I'm
afraid.”
“Well, I did just hear it before,”
said Myra. “I wish you'd make up
one for me. I think we might all
announce ourselves like that, and then
the audience will have no difficulty in
recognising us.”
“They'll recognise Thomas if he
comes on with an axe. They won't
think he's just trotted round with the
milk. But what are you, Myra 2"
“The Emperor's wife's maid.”
“Another member of the highly-
trained staff. Well, go on, Simpson.”
“‘Oh, I am Her Majesty's maid,’” de-
claimed Simpson. “We all begin with
‘Oh,' to express surprise at finding our-
selves on the stage at all. ‘Oh, I am
Her Majesty's maid, I'm a sad little
flirt, I'm afraid.’”
“I’m respectable, steady, and staid,”
corrected Myra.
“No,” I said; “I have it—
“‘Oh, I am Her Majesty's maid!
And her charms are beginning to
fade—
I can sit in the sum
And look just twenty-one
While she's thirty-six in the shade.’”
Myra made a graceful curtsey.
“Thank you, Sir. You'll have to pay
me a lot more of those before the play
is over.”
“Will I really 2”
“Well, seeing as the Grand Hereditary
One is supposed to be making up to Her
Majesty's confidential attendant * >
Miss Fortescue came pushing up to us.
“It is too ridiculous,” she complained;
“none of us know our parts yet, and if
we have a rehearsal now—what do you

myself. “I’m all for a rehearsal at

mark on the stage, for already (such
is the inherent mimicry of the normal
dramatist) we hear of several new plays
in which ordinarily inanimate objects
play lively parts.
The casts of cne or two such works
reveal how strong the Belgian influence
is. Thus:– -
The BrowN Dog.
An Anti-Vivisectionist Morality.
Rorer, the hero, a brown dog, the friend
of man.
Poos, a cat with nine lives, and therefore
the despair of the vivisectionists.
Several Surgeons, all named and all
villains.
Blood, continually running from dog.
Battersea Park, who ultimately offers the
dog a home.
Law
Order -
Public Opinion, an agitated female.
Stevecole, an eloquent opponent of vivi-
section.
Scorn, his friend.
* } His constant companions.
Ink p
} Twin sisters.
Policemen, Town Councillors, Paper-
boys, Outside Shouts, etc., etc.
And here is The Blue Bird method as
applied to melodrama pure and simple:—
The BLACK HAND.
A Sensational Drama of Modern Life.
Jasper Maltravers, the hero, an author.
Grace Lovelace, the heroine.
Sir Dyrke Devious, the villain, played
by a bulldog in evening dress.
Lady Devious, his unhappy wife, played
by a white cat with black paws.
Ursula Davenport, an adventuress,
played by a dress-stand on castors.
Guy Badminton, a spendthriſt.
Limelight, who accompanies hero and
heroine.
Applause, who enters after every heroic
speech.
Waste - paper Basket,
Jasper's MSS.
A Dishonoured Cheque, friend of Guy
Badminton.
A Deaf Waiter.
Postage Stamp, who assists hero and
heroine in clandestine correspond-
ence.
The Marble Arch, a friend of the family.
Sleuth, a detective, in the following dis-
guises:- a tramp, a boy scout, a
gentleman, a curate, a doormat, a
postman, a sack of potatoes, a 'bus
conductor, an Egyptologist, a pup,
a caddie, a keyhole, an organ-
grinder, a draught.
Jim Pincher, an obsolete burglar.
who devours
Jack Snaffles, thief and gentleman, the
super-hero.

Crowd of Good and Bad Motives,
Grced, IIate, Joy, Virtue, Vice.

Press, and The White Lie.
OUR IMPARTIAL HISTORIANS.
A STUDY IN CONTEMPORARY JOURNALISM.
EXTRACT from newspaper report of a
meeting addressed by the Tarifferendum
Candidate, at the Corn Exchange, Poop-
ton-on-the-Push, on Thursday last:—
“At this point Mr. Glibley urged upon
his hearers the vital necessity of finding
work for all. :
A Voice. When was your last job?
(Laughter.)
Continuing, Mr. Glibley said that in
the spring of last year no fewer than one
able-bodied male in forty was on the
1ates. . .
A Voice. We don't want your personal
reminiscences. (Loud laughter.)
Mr. Glibley made one more strenuous
attempt to hold the audience; Irish
affairs, he said, could not be permanently
projected into the obscure perspective of
an elusory futurity, but at the same
time——
The Voice. Has anybody here seen
Kelly 2 (Roars of laughter.)
The Chairman (interposing). Will you
give Mr. Glibley a fair hearing 2
The Voice. No. (Loud and prolonged
laughter.) -
Several members of the audience then
mounted the platform in a spirited and
determined manner that would be denied
nothing, and a resolution proposing a
vote of confidence in the anti-Tariffer-
endum Candidate was carried with the
most wonderful enthusiasm. Meanwhile
Mr. Glibley and his friends, evidently
thinking discretion the better part of
valour, made a hurried escape by way
of a back door, which, when it became
known, provoked unbounded merriment
amongst the audience. The magnificent
Bread Song – Bread, bread, it's bread
we want, not work’—was then sung,
to the tune of Oh! Oh! Antonio, after
which the proceedings terminated ‘in
the most admired disorder.’”
Extract from the same paper's report
of a meeting addressed by the anti-
Tarifferendum Candidate, at the Corn
Exchange, Poopton-on-the-Push, on
Friday last :—
“Continuing, Mr. Glumley pointed out
that a levy of only nineteen shillings in
the pound on all treasure trove would,
at the end of twenty years, provide all
bond-ſide trade-unionists over the age
of forty-three with red bandana handker-
chiefs free of cost. But at this point
it became only too evident that there
was a plot on foot to break up the
meeting by an organised gang of hooli-
gans, and worse. The Chairman's ap-
peal for order was greeted with un-
English catcalls and ribald snatches of
song. Ultimately the platform was
rushed by hired bravoes, who had gained
admittance by means of forged tickets.
Providentially, no lives were lost, but
several legs (Windsor chair) were broken,
and, amid scenes of brutal violence,
cheers were given for Mr. Glibley and
his policy of universal fratricide. It
now rests with Poopton to clear up this
scandalous affair, and to remove the
stigma that at present rests upon its
name. A foul blow has been struck at
the Englishman's inalienable right of
free speech; terrorism and rowdyism
stalk openly and unashamed in our
midst, and we cannot leave the matter
there. What were the police doing?”
Etc., etc., etc.
BALLADE OF THE OPEN MIND.
FROM every hustings 'neath the sky
The stream of talk begins to run;
To fierce and windy warfare fly
The Tory Goth and Labour Hun;
And as I hear each mother's son
I wonder which is worse than t’other—
It seems to me it's six of one
And half-a-dozen of the other.
Each morning is the pensions lie
Exposed by some great Tory gun;
Each night the Food Tax fallacy
Is settled and for ever done.
And as I watch the sorry fun,
Where each must vilify his brother,
It seems to me it's six of one
And half a-dozen of the other.
“Tariff Reform,” the Liberals cry,
“Would surely end in work for none.”
“No, no,” good Unionists reply,
“It's bread for all—perhaps a bun.
The only way our fate to shun—”
“The only way our trade to smother—” |
It seems to me it's six of one
And half-a-dozen of the other.
ENVOY.
Votes, could I have you by the ton,
I'd give you all to wife or mother,
Till they, too, learn it's six of one
And half-a-dozen of the other.
“Leigham Court II, beat Wallington II. by
13 goals to nil. Wallington were unfortunate
in being two short, but two spectators filled the
gap ; one got hurt and retired and the other
put her knee out, and so could only stand in
goal the second half."—The Ilockey Field.
After all, Wallington II. were not so
very unlucky. These accidents might
have happened to the actual team.

RICHMOND PARK.
Oh, have you been to Richmond of a windy April morning,
When the loose white clouds are flying and the blue i
washed and clean, -
When the beeches on the hill-top don a diffident adorning
And the river twines its silver through the shimmer of
the green,
When the cuckoo flings his notes
And the thrushes crack their throats
And the boatmen at the eyot start a-varnishing their boats?
Have you seen its gallant vistas in the splendour of a June
day,
Oh, the rhododendron thickets and the water and the wood!
When the stags are still in velvet and across the hush of
noon-day
Comes the throbbing of the motors past the Gate of Robin
Hood, -
When the bracken by the ponds
First unfolds its crinkled fronds
And the dragon-flies are dancing round the slender willow
wands?
Have you been to royal Richmond when the year is growing
mellow,
And October, mild and fruitful, on its woodland sets her
mark,
or PERHAPs, on second Thoughts, TAILoR-MADE.
When the footpath—of her bounty—has a carpet red and
yellow,
And the great harts roar a challenge as the twilight meets
the dark,
And at half-past five or so -
There are lights that flash and glow,
Thrilling upward in the quiet out of Kingston down below?
Have you ever been to Richmond when the days are short
and chilly, -
When a red December sunset has been swallowed in the fog,
When the wanderer, belated in the frosty air and stilly,
Sees the tree-trunks full of goblins, and he whistles up
his dog,
And turns to look again
- At the firelight on the pane,
In the keeper's cottage window, going home by Clarence Lane”
If you've not, then, and would know it, with its pools and

MY CANVASS.
My conscience compelled me to come
to the rescue of the Constitution, and
when I demanded a canvassing book the
agent beamed on me. -
“You take Nelson Street,” he said.
“It’ll need tactful management. Tell
'em all in confidence that Clump is
certain to be in by two thousand. If
we can get 'em bettin' on our man
they'll back their bets with their votes.”
“Is there any special constitutional
point I should emphasise?” I asked.
“Don’t talk too much about work for
all,” he said cynically. “Last thing
they want down there is a job.”
When I looked at the gloomy dwell-
ings of Nelson Street I thrilled with
enthusiasm. I resolved that if one
man's eloquence could
mark. Wait till I've done washin' my-
self, an' I'll show yer what a true
Englishman thinks o' the likes o' you.”
With exceeding promptitude I marked
Mr. Progers as “doubtful,” and departed
for No. 13.
There Mr. Kenworthy received me
with open arms. He agreed with every-
thing I said. He listened with delight|d
to my exposition of the constitutional
crisis. So when I rose to go I said,
“Then I may put you down as pledged
to Mr. Clump?” “Not me. I'm a-votin'
for 'Iggins. Yer see it's this way. My
missis's maiden name was 'Iggins, an'
there'd be trouble if I voted agin a

Mr. Clewer suddenly gripped the
poker and stood between me and the
OOr. - -
I looked at Mr. Clewer and the poker,
and placed five shillings on the table.
As he jumped for it I jumped for the
door. . .
When I was safely at the end of the
street, I resolved to let the Constitution
look after itself. I marked all the
remaining voters at random “dead,”
“removed,” or “doubtful,” and was
just going off in disgust when I saw
another canvasser approach. He glanced

looking lady. “Could
I see your husband for

“I’d like to see 'im

open the door and draw

As Mrs. Budge's attitude was dis-
tinctly threatening, I hurriedly marked
her husband as “removed,” and hastened
to interview Mr. Progers at No. 5.
Mr. Progers was washing himself in ||
a bucket, and looked up at me with a
soapy face.
“Called for Clump,'ave yer? Now’ow

After this bitter disappointment, it
was a relief to find that Mr. Abbott of
No. 19 was in gaol and could take no
interest in the constitutional crisis for
at least six months. But when I called

surprised at the warmth of my recep-

“I quite understand your very proper

Lost is my faith in man! I have been robbed
By those for whom I sought the Crown of Fame;
Were times I could have flung me down and sobbed,
Though mine was but the sorrow, theirs the shame.
Ah! 'twas my inborn modesty forbade
That I myself should seek the fadeless bays;
Enough could I all gloriously be clad
In the shed lustre from another's rays.
I chose an author, one of claims distinct;
I clung to him like tendrils to the oak ;
Our names, I vowed, for ever should be linkel
In reminiscence, anecdote, or joke.
A closer friend than I he never found ;
I wooed his favour with my every breath. . . .
Did he achieve distinction ? Selfish hound !
He cultivated style, and starved to death.
I chose a painter, one whose lofty brow
Gave bounteous promise for the years to be;
Where Fortune's gilded apples weighed the bough,
I leaned a golden ladder 'gainst the tree.
Then, loving-handed, led him nigh to show
How, ready to his reach, the Fame-fruit hung. . . .
Did he ascend the ladder? Curse him, no!
He had ideals' and never rose a rung.
I chose a politician, one of parts;
His star, I felt, was rising ne'er to set;
His purple diction swayed the people's hearts,
His person early graced the Cabinet.
“This man,” said I, “makes Hist'ry; its fair page
Shall laud a friend who nobly shared the cost.” . . .
Did he retain the centre of the stage?
The ass developed scruples, and was lost.

Mr. ALFRED AustiN has addressed a letter to his fellow-
countrymen, dealing with the political situation. Our Poet
Laureate has begun the New Year well by writing prose.
“M.P. Fights for his Seat in a Sick Bed,” said the placard
of a halfpenny paper. We don't know who was disputing
his right to a seat in his own sick bed, but while sympa-
thising with his indisposition we feel it is a case where he
should have taken the trouble lying down.
Sir WILLIAM BULL, M.P., is reported to have punched a
heckler for remarking, “I am not a solicitor who is paid to
tell lies.” There is no truth, however, in the rumour that
Sir Willia M has offered to take on three dukes, seventeen
other peers, and 240 Unionist Candidates because of their
lack of respect to another solicitor—a Welsh one.

[JANUARY 12, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A VICTIM OF TYRANNY.
EVER since the Tyrant set his foot
upon my neck I have had to give up
jig-saws, aeroplaning, the dodging of
split infinitives, and all the gentle tasks
that go to fill the days of a simple and
useful life.
At ten this morning, for instance,
just as my fountain-pen had begun to
work without blobbing, my chief re-
tainer put her head in at the door and
said explosively: “Please, master—
you're—wanted '''
I had already entertained a mild
suspicion that this might be so; for
there had been five knocks and three
rings during the preceding two minutes,
and a proud champing of bits and the
stertorous breathing of a Daimhard
sounded at the outer postern. So I cast
a lingering fond glance at a still wet
chapter-heading—“How Henry Pressed
his Suit”—and went dejectedly down-
stairs.
“Which room?” I asked. My chief
retainer made a circular sweep with
a plump mottled arm. -
“All of 'em,” she said aggrievedly,
and tumbled down the kitchen stairs
to relieve the tension of over-stimulated
nerves by breaking coals below.
I went first into the grand salon,
where a young man with a gardenia
and an a'r of loving me rather more
than a brother gripped my hand
cordially and spun about me a dark
ckoud of words, words, words, from
which there presently emerged, although
mistily, the central idea that, given
certain eventualities and right conduct
on my part, my food would cost me less.
I believe I told him that the matter
couldn't affect me, that I had no time
for meals at all during these days of
oppression. Somehow, at any rate, I
got rid of him ; and then I went to the
banqueting-hall.
Here, his gnarled fist resting on the
table—my table, the board sacred to
hospitality—stood an uninvited stranger,
with basilisk eye and a Scotch Presby-
terian beard. He flung forty fiscal facts
and Heaven knows how many rows of
figures at me, till—dim at first and
nebulous—there grew slowly into shape
the suggestion that, given unrighteous
conduct on my part, my food would cost
Ille Ill Ore.
I know I told him that in that case I
should have to work harder, and that it
might be the making of me; for work
alone is noble. (It is worthy of note that
any argument which does not fit into a
well-worn groove will put the mind of the
partizany instantly out of gear.) We
parted, more in anger than in sorrow,
and I telephoned down the kitchen stairs
to ask who was in the Blue Room.
As I am not a Cabinet Minister there
was nothing to fear, really. But I did
my breathing exercises in the hall, went
hurriedly through my physical drill, and
then swung jauntily into the room,
humming a merry stave.
But the music died on my lips as her
eye fell upon me. For twenty minutes
by the clock, and with only two semi-
colons, she told me that my sisters and
my cousins and my aunts, as well as
my fourteen daughters, were slaves and
helots. “And now, Sir,” she said, con-
sidering my plate-glass windows with
an interest I did not at all care for, –
“and now, Sir, have you made up your
mind to do us justice at last 2"
“Madam,” I replied, seeing my open-
ing here, “Madam, it would be difficult
indeed to do you justice.” She looked
by turns mollified, doubtful, and then
dangerous; and I had to warn one of
my varlets, who was sweeping imaginary
leaves into heaps outside, to take
particular heed that she did not indulge
an all-too-likely propensity for roof-
climbing. Then I went to the Red
Room.
I have an idea that he once mis-spent
a day putting my bath-taps out of
order, under pretence of being a
plumber. But he was quite ready to
mend the constitution, and he talked of
how our forefathers bled—Heavens !
how they bled !
So they did— every spring. The
practice, I reminded him, has been
abandoned in modern medicine, theugh
the principle remains; and if, as seemed
evident, he needed a cooling mixture,
my good friend, Dr. Bolus, three doors
down the street——
He shed a stream of pamphlets
entitled “The Dukes: Who the Deuce
are they 2” all the way to the front-door.
“Are there any in the box-room, the
bath-room, or under the beds?” I
telephoned downstairs.
“There's her in the Yaller Room,”
came the resentful answer. So I went
to the Yellow Room and sat down
beside her on the sofa. -
“My dear lady,” I said—for she was
young and very, very beautiful, -“my
dear lady, if I have a vote doesn't it
strike you that I have made up my
mind how to use it years and years ago?
I am whole-heartedly for a Tarifferen-
dum, and these visits, though pleasant,
seem to a busy man so unnecessary x *
Her eyes swam, and the mute reproach
in them stabbed me. “I only came,”
she faltered, “at the cost of much
violence to my not unnatural feelings of
diſlidence, to thank you a thousand
times for giving to the world that
beautiful, beautiful book, The Heart that
Overflow-th.”
And I had so often wondered who
had bought it—the sole copy of a still-
born masterpiece that did not figure in
the publisher's statement under the
head of “free copies.”
But she was gone—and for ever!
And so it has come to this: that a
man cannot tell friend from foe in the
privacy of his own castle.
They come and go, canvasser and can-
didate, big loafer, little loafer, word-
spinner, crank. And “Lor! the sweep-
ing up after 'em!” as my head servitor
justly remarks. And it is all the fault
of the ruthless oligarchs, who will have ||
it that I must be consulted about
the taxes I pay ! (Tyrants of course
they’ll have to go after this.)

THE EXEMPLAR.
ONCE upon a time there was a little
boy who had a fit of naughtiness. He
refused to obey his nurse and was, as
she said afterwards, that obstreperous
that her life for about half-an-hour was
a burden. At last, just as she was in
despair, a robin fluttered to the window-
sill of the nursery and perched on it,
peeping in.
“There,” said the nurse, “look at
that dear little birdie come to see what
all the trouble 's about. He's never
refused to have his face washed and
made clean, I know. I'd be ashamed
to cry and scream before a little pretty
innocent like that, that I would.”
Now this robin, as it happened, was a
poisonously wicked little bird. He was
greedy and jealous and spiteful. He
continually fought other and weaker
birds and took away their food; he
pecked sparrows and tyrannised over
tits. He habitually ate too much ; and
quite early in life he had assisted his
brothers and sisters in putting both
their parents to death.
None the less the spectacle of his
pretty red breast and bright eye shamed
and soothed the little boy and very
soon he became quite good again.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The sub-title of Garryowen (FISHER UNwiN) is “The
Romance of a Racehorse.” If you expect something on the
lines of Black Beauty or The Life-story of a Partridge (vide
popular magazines) you will be agreeably surprised.
H. DE WERE STACPoolE's novel is an ordinary comedy of men
and women. Of course there is a racehorse in it, Garryowen
himself, no less, but his part is largely a thinking one. Mr.
French, of Drumgool, owed more than he could pay, and
his effects (including Garryowen) were to be seized if he did
not meet a bill by a certain date. Now Garryowen was a
dead cert for the City and Suburban, which was to be run
a week after that date; and French expected to get fifty
to one about him, for this was a very dark horse indeed.
Was this chance to go begging for want of seven days'
grace? Well, there was one way of saving the situation
—Garryowen must be kept in hiding. The story tells how
Mr. French and his horse, household, little daughter, pretty
governess, and faith-
might have been is shown by the delightful thrills of the
end, which is worthy of the best traditions of the craft. The
secret of the cryptogram, when revealed, indicates a sliding
panel in the wainscot, behind which are narrow stone steps
leading downwards, and only to be descended with caution
because “the air may be foul down there.” (Don't you always
love that bit?) And at the bottom they found—— Ah, that,
I think, you must find for yourself; but I advise you to pay
the author the compliment of skipping his middle chapters
in the process.
If this were an appropriate moment to suggest a holiday-
task for politicians I should recommend Mrs. EveRARD Cotes's
The Burnt Offering (METHUEN) to their notice, because it shows
very clearly the harm done by men who would rather talk
about subjects of which they know nothing than not talk at
all. Vulcan Mills (I like his name), M.P. for Further Angus,
goes to India, not so much in search of knowledge as of
evidence that the British are a race of oppressors. Stuffed
with prejudices and accompanied by his daughter he is soon
surrounded by people who regard him—and her—with
veneration. Here, in

her mind, but I
think she will take Dashwood. When I read this pleasant
book I felt very grateful to Mr. STACPoole for it, because I
really thought it was going to be the life story of a partridge;
that gratitude made me overlook the fact that it might quite
easily have had a larger share of fancy and sunny humour.
As myself something of an epicure in stories about buried
treasure, I lay down this general axiom—that no author
starting with a ruined mansion, an impoverished family, and
a mysterious cryptogram, has any business thereafter to go
wandering off into Germany and wasting time over foreign
domestic comedy. If “JANE WARDLE” had only observed
this simple rule he would have made a far better job of The
Pasque-Flower (ARNOLD). Nothing indeed could have been
more promising than the early chapters. Old Mr. Palrerson,
with his courtly poverty and the tradition of an ancestral
hoard, is the very character to welcome of a winter's evening.
But the Teutonic part, however well drawn, and however
true to life the hospitality, kindness, and general amiability
of the inhabitants, only irritates a reader who, like myself, is
anxious to get on and discover what really was hidden at
The Queen's IIouse. Especially as I was a little worried all

“O TO BE IN ENGLAND.”
[To a retired Member of Parliament, in his villa at Cap Martin.]
WHAT time, my friend, I picture you
(So distance yields to Fancy's wand)
Against a sky of sapphire blue,
With sea to correspond,
Envy of your Elysian lot,
A bitter envy, gnaws my breast,
Prisoned at home when home is not
Behaving at its best.
Here under wintry skies and gray,
Selling our little remnant souls,
We bite and scream and scratch our way
To victory at the polls.
But you, in your enchanted air,
You miss our mud-pies, rich and thick,
Discharged at random with a prayer
That some at least may stick.
You miss our nausea (vide note*),
When BEGBIE, moist with unctuous pride,
Pledges his word that Heaven shall vote
- On his (on HAROLD's) side.
Ah, how I pine and even pant
After your dusk-green olive groves,
There to escape from sickly cant,
Black lies and ditto loaves;
To pace the shore by those “reservºs.”
Where residential oysters are,
Or up the woodland way that curves
To lovely Castellar.
Or Monte's Shrine of Chance for me,
Where a great peace and silence reign,
And any loud remark would be
Resented as profane.
I picture you in that fair scene
Putting your mille-note on the red;
See your resigned and gentle mien
When black comes up instead.
“'Tis Luck,” you say, and bear the blow,
And put a brace of mille-notes on,
And still preserve a genial glow
When they likewise are gone.
O what a lesson there for us !
You turn no hair, your lips are dumb,
While we make all this beastly fuss
About a pendulum—
So much the sport of every breeze
That none who brags of rise or drop
Knows where (to forty-five degrees)
The thing intends to stop. O. S.

If the number of leaflets, etc., distributed up to last
Saturday were placed across Westminster Bridge, it would
take six men a considerable time to remove them, and would
probably cause a temporary stoppage of the tramway service.
The 670 members who will comprise the new House of
Commons would, if packed close together in the Serpentine,
displace about 38 tons of water. [Note.—The SPEAKER is not

FIRST CoMMissionER of WoRKS would allow the experiment to
be made.
As the names of at least two women have somehow crept
into the Register, we have the curious result that of the

WhAT do I hear? Another meeting 2 No!
Oh, Sir, be merciful! Consider, Sir,
I have had sixty meetings; and two more
Are on the programme for to-night, and you
Would add a third one to the hideous list.
No, Sir, I can't, and that's the truth of it.
My reservoir of phrases has run dry;
The leaflets are exhausted: I have said
All that is printed there a hundred times.
You've heard me say it, you yourself have heard,
One hundred times, and now at last I strike.
Was it for this that I have left my home,
My humble but my comfortable home 2
Was it that I might be, what now I am,
The dull retailer of machine-made words,
The cheered, the groaned, the questioned Candidate 2
Pluck up, you say, your spirit; be a man;
Two days remain, two paltry little days,
And voters thronging from ten thousand homes
Shall make you victor in the dreadful fray.
But think, Sir, there's the Voice that interrupts,
The fearful, mocking, ever-present Voice.
Lºst night it came as usual. I had said,
“Your bread,” and there I paused; and then the Voice:
“Will cost us more unless we keep you out,”
And then the meeting laughed and I was dumb.
On other nights when I have praised the Lords,
“We've had too much of them, too much of you,”
Broke in the Voice, and I was done again.
And, oh, the questions! When, my speech at end,
The Chairman rises blandly and declares,
“Now, gentlemen, you've heard the Candidate;
If any here are still dissatisfied,
Up with you; put your questions to him straight.
He'll gladly give you answers, never fear.”
And so the torture-chamber is prepared,
And I, the victim, fixed upon the rack
Three times a night, and I must smile as though
My keenest pleasure lay in being there.
No, Sir, I've had enough. I'll do no more.
And when the two remaining days are past,
And even the shouting's over, I shall fly
To some deserted island of the South,
Where never men hold meetings, since there are
No men, thank heaven, to hold them; and no Voice
Nor any question comes from any throat
To break the sunlit silence of the shore.
“But we must look on this war with Germany as not a thing im-

ruination of the Island. It would kill all chances of a successful
season, upon which the Island depends. But there is another view to

in the right-hand side and the red ink
in the leſt. No 2 Dear, dear, the hippo-
potamus must have been a bad one.”
“Be an altist, Thomas,” I said, “and
open a vein or two. Do the thing pro-
perly, Beerbohm. But soft, a winsome
maid, in sooth; I will approach her. I
always forget that sooth bit. But soft,
a win —”
“Why don't we begin?” asked Simp-
son; “I can't remember my part much
longer. Oh, by the way, when you
come up to me and say, ‘Your Majesty
e'en forgets the story of the bull's-eye
and the revolving bookcase——’”
i Go away; I don't say anything so
silly.”
“Oh, of course, it 's Blair. Blair,
when you come up to me and say——”
They retired to the back of the stage to
arrange a very effective piece of business.
“Any card you like, Madam, so long
as it is in the pack. The Queen of
Hearts 2 Certainly. Now I take the
others and tear them up—so. The card
remaining will be yours. Ah, as I
thought—it is the Queen of Hearts.”
“Archie, you're talking too much,”
said Dahlia, “and none of it comes into
your part really.”
“I’m getting the atmosphere. Have
you an old top hat on you, dear, because
if so we'll make a pudding. No top
hat? Then pudding is horf.”
“But stay, who is this approaching?
Can it be I say, mind the foot-
lights. When are we going to begin P’’
“There !” said Thomas proudly.
“Anybody would know that was blood.”
“How perfectly ripping,” said Myra.
“Only you want some notches.”
“What for 2 º’
“To show where you executed the other
men, of course. You always get a bit
off your axe when you execute any-
body.”
“Yes, I've heard that, too,” I agreed.
“Notches, Thomas, notches.”
“Why don't you do something for a
change? What about the trap or what-
ever it is you catch your bally rats
with ? Why don't you make that?” .
“It isn't done with a trap, Thomas
dear. It's partly the power of the
human eye and partly kindness. I sit
upon a sunny bank and sing to them.”
“Which is that?”
“If we don't begin soon—” began
Simpson. -
“Hallo, Emperor, what's that you're
saying? Quite so, I agree with you.
I wonder if your High Fatness can lend
me such a thing as a hard-boiled egg.
Simpson, when this rehearsal is over,
that is to say to-morrow, I'll take you
on at juggling; I’m the best xx.
Derry finished his conversation with
Miss Fortescue and turned to the stage.
“Now then, please, please,” he said.
“We'll just take the First Act. “Scene,
The Emperor's Palace. Enter Rat-
catcher.' You come on from the left.”
I coughed and came on.
My part was not a long one, but it
was a very important one. I was the
connecting link between the different
episodes of the play, and they wanted
some connecting. Whenever anybody
came on to the stage, I said (supposing
I was there, and 1 generally was—the
ratcatcher of those days corresponding
to the modern plumber)--I said, “But
who is this?” or “ Hush, here comes
somebody.” In this way the attention
of the wakeful part of the audience was
switched on to the new character, and
continuity of action was preserved.
I coughed and came on.
“No,” said Derry, “you must come
on much more briskly.”
“I can’t ; I’ve been bitten by a rat.”
“It doesn't say so anywhere.”
“Well, that's how I read the part.
Hang it, I ought to know if I’ve been
bitten or not. But I won't show it if
you like; I'll come on briskly.”
I went out and came on very briskly.
“That's better,” said Derry.
“His Majesty ordered me to be here
at the stroke of noon,” I said. “Belike
he has some secret commands to lay
upon me, or perchance it is nought but
a plague of rats. But who is this?”
“Oh,” said Myra, coming in suddenly,
“I had thought to be alone.” º
“Nay, do not flee from me, pretty one.
It is thus that—— I say, Myra, it's
no good my saying do not flee if you
don't flee.” -
“I was just going to. You didn't
give me a chance. There, now I'm
fleeing.” - -
“Oh, all right. It is thus that the
rats flee when they see me approaching.
Am I so very fearsome 2"
“'Orrid,” said Archie to himself;
from the wings. ,
“One moment,” said Derry, and he
turned round to speak to somebody. '
“Puffickly 'orrid,” said Archie again. :
“Nay, do not frown,” Myra went on,
tis only my little brother who is like
unto a codfish himself, and jealous
withal.” :
“Ay, ay, and I thought it was a cod-
fish. So that I had e'en brought the
egg-sauce with me.”
“Trouble not thyself for that,” said
Archie. “For verily the audience will
supply thee with all the eggs thou
wantest. I say, we are being funny.”
“I’m not, I'm quite serious, I really
did think it was a co–– But tell me,
fair one,” I said hurriedly, “for what
dost the Emperor want me?”
“Yes, yes,” said Derry, “I’m sorry I
had to interrupt you. I think perhaps
* * *
we had better begin again. Yes, from
the beginning.”
The rehearsal rolled on.
+ + + + +
“I think it went splendidly,” said
Myra. “If only we had known our
parts, and come in at the right moments
and been more serious over it.”
“If there's any laughing to be done
it will have to be done by us. The
audience won't laugh.”
“Mr. Derry having explained that the
author was not in the house, the audience ||
collected their cauliflowers and left
quietly. I think it's a rotten play.”
“Well, it isn't frightfully funny,”
said Myra, “but we can put that in
ourselves.”
“It’s so jolly hard to say the lines
properly—they're so unnatural,” com- |
plained Thomas. “Truly thou hast
created a favourable impression with
the damsel’ — well, I mean, that's
absurd. Any ordinary person would
say, ‘Truly thou art amongst them, old
spot,' or something of that kind.”
“Well, you say that, Thomas; you'll
be all right.”
“We might put a few songs in,” said
Dahlia, “and a dance or two.” -
“I think you've forgotten that we’ve
only done Act I.,” remarked Archie.
“His Majesty's conjurer doesn't really
let himself go till Act II. Still, I'm all
for a song and a dance. Simpson, come
and Apache with me.” -
They dashed at each other fiercely.

[JANUARY 19, 1910.
DUAL PERSONALITY.
WHEN a thing goes astray, as it frequently may,
And is not to be found where I put it away,
I seem to become, says my dimidium, .
More blind than a bat in the light of the day.
She is seized with the blues at the places I choose
To search for a trace of my second-best trews,
And she frowns as I grope with a vanishing hope
Through her blouses and skirts and diminutive shoes.
I can see her nerves shrink when I venture to think
They may be in the box with her ermine and mink,
And she’ll probably ask, as I give up the task,
If I've looked in the scuttle and under the sink.
But when I'm at the office I am quite another me;
I can declare
Precisely where
Each thing I want should be.
There all is ordered sweetly,
And tidied up completely,
And docketed as meatly
As one could wish to see.
At least, that is the tale I drum
Into my dear dimidium.
When I'm making a hole in my hot buttered roll
It will frequently chance that the half of my soul
Will say, “You will 'phone to the Stores, ownest own,
And order a ton of the best kitchen coal.”
“Very good,” I reply, and I carefully tie
A knot in my hankie, and Citywards hie——
In the evening—great Scott!—I discover that knot
And wonder whoever has tied it, and why.
I puzzle my brain in attempts to explain
The knot and its meaning, but all is in vain
Till my ownest comes in and I hear her begin,
“Oh, silly, you’ve never forgotten again P’’
But when I'm at the office I am quite another man,
For there I find
I bear in mind
As much as mortal can.
There I’ve no need to coddle
With tricky knots my noddle;
My memory's a model
Of order and of plan.
At least, that is the kind of tone
I practise on my ownest own.
When troubles appear, and the cook becomes queer
Regarding such questions as outings and beer,
When the porridge is clumps of impossible lumps
And I'm told to complain by the lady I fear,
Though I’m vastly impressed that she dares to suggest
A course so heroic, I haste to protest
That the stuff is all right, that I fancy it quite,
Then when it 's like that it agrees with me best.
Then with masculine guile I endeavour to smile
As I start to absorb the detestable pile,
While my queen's upturned nose all too pointedly shows
That she knows that I know the mixture is vile.
But when I'm at the office I am not like that at all:
The clerks obey
Whate'er I say,
The typists rush at call;
The office-boys deliver
Their errands with a shiver,
The porters quake and quiver
When I pass through the hall.
At least, that is the kind of scene
I try to picture to my queen.
THE REMONSTRATOR.
I.—“DESIRABLE.”
“Good morning,” I said to the house agent. “I have
come about that house with your bills in the window in
the Upton Road.”
He became intensely polite and placed a chair for me.
“Oh, yes,” he said; “you could not have made a better
choice.”
“I don't say that I have chosen it,” I replied.
“No, perhaps not exactly chosen—yet,” he said heartily.
“But–well, you want to ask some questions about it.”
“That's just it,” I said. “I do.”
“There's not a more desirable house in London,” he ran
on. “It’s—" I}ut I interrupted him.
“You’ve come to the very point,” I said. “‘Desirable.”
You call it a desirable residence, not only in speech, but in
your bills. This desirable residence.’”
“Naturally,” he answered. “How could we do other-
wise?”
“Well,” I said, “how long has it been empty 2 º'
“Oh, I don't know exactly,” said he. “Lighteen months,
perhaps.”
“Just over two years,” I said.
He looked at me narrowly. “Is it so long?” he remarked.
“Well, what then 2''
“What is your definition of ‘ desirable'?” I asked him.
“‘Desirable'?” he said. “Why, to be desired, of course;
something that people want.”
“And yet,” I said, “it has been empty for more than two
years. But to proceed,” I added. “I have been walking
about this neighbourhood for some time, just out of curiosity,
looking at the bills in the windows, and I have found no
fewer than forty-five of your bills. They were on houses of
every variety—big and little, meat and slovenly, detached
and in rows, old and new—and every one is described as
‘desirable.' Now surely you could do better than that ?
The English language is not so bankrupt as that?”
He edged nearer the door.
“How,” I asked, “can one epithet describe accurately
forty-five totally different houses 2"
He began to groan, which encouraged me.
“And think,” I said, “how foolish it looks. To go on
year after year calling this empty and forlorn house
‘ desirable.’
No wonder your business does not flourish. No wonder
your paint is so dirty. It’s a confession of failure.”
He writhed. “What do you suggest?” he asked at last.
“Well,” I said, “ something nearer the truth. Such as
‘'This well-built if empty residence which sensible house-
hunters would desire if they really examined it.’ Something
like that. You see I have kept ‘ desire in. I know you
couldn't get on without that.”
He groaned again.
“Or,” I continued, “‘This small but comfortably arranged
residence; ' ' This warm and inexpensive residence; ' ' This
residence with six bedrooms and three reception rooms; '
‘This conveniently-planned residence; ' or even, as a last
resource, “This residence.' But, I implore you, not ‘ this
desirable residence’ when it isn't desired.”
He rose at last and thanked me.
“Any way,” he said, “ you'll let me give you an order
to view 2''
“No, thank you,” I said.
“But you should look over it,” he said.

“But how did you know,” he asked as an after-thought,

For Dot's disdainful feet to flatten,

Where drugs and drills appeared to cosset
A breast increasingly concerned
To bring the buttons home across it,

THE WITAL ISSUES.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,--The attitude of
“Perplexed Patriot” in a recent issue
of yours fills me with unmitigated com-
passion. But why worry about conflicting
issues? His course should be as clear
as mud. Take my case. Here am I, a
resident in Kensington, where the Candi-
dates were Lord CLAUD HAMILTON and
Captain McIlwaine. I couldn't possibly
vote for the Captain because he supports
Woman Suffrage, and nothing will ever
induce me to give the vote to a sex
which prefers the music of Chopin to
that of HANDEL. I suppose you will argue
from this that I supported Lord CLAUD
HAMILTON. Wrong again. He is Chair-
man of the Great Eastern Railway Com-
pany; the climate of Norfolk always
affects my liver, and I never go to Liver-
pool Street station without losing my
temper. In those circumstances the
duty of a patriot to abstain from the
polling-booth was absolutely imperative.
Yours complacently,
REsolute MUGwu MP.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-As a convinced
humanitarian and member of the Feline
Deſence Society, I have made it my
business to extract, if possible, pledges
from the Liberal Candidates in the five
divisions in which I have a vote to
support the grant of a Government
subsidy to the Society in question. So
far I have entirely failed to obtain even
an acknowledgment of my letters. Per-
haps you will suggest some more effectual
means of inducing them to listen to the
voice of reason.
Yours faithfully,
ANti-DREADNOUGHT.
The Nest, Calford Bridge.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-As the father of a
family which I am attempting to bring
up in an atmosphere of culture and
refinement, will you permit me to lodge
a protest against the unspeakable vul-
garity of the Tory literature that is
being daily foisted upon my household 2
To take only one example, a few days
ago my little boy, Theobald Athanasius,
aged seven, brought me a leaflet which
had been insidiously thrust into my
letter-box, bearing upon it the following
couplet:-
“If you want to cheaply smoke
Then kick out the Liberal bloke.”
Whatever my political opinions may be,
is it not a gratuitous insult to imagine
that this revolting instance of the split
infinitive would appeal either to me or
to any other member of my family 2
Indignantly yours,
DisgustEd Householder.
Worple Road, Wimbledon.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-May I count upon
your well-known love of fairplay to give
prominence to the following. Though
I detest Home Rule and the Land Taxes,
I am so firmly convinced that the true
solution of all national problems is to
be found in the scientific study of
Phrenology that I shall be reluctantly
obliged to withhold my vote from the
Unionist Candidate in this Division, as
he has refused to support a Bill making
that subject compulsory in all elementary
schools. The Liberal Candidate, on the
other hand, promises that if the PRIME
MINISTER introduces such a measure into
his programme he will give it his
benevolent consideration.
Faithfully yours,

CHRISTMAS DRAMA IN 1959.
WHAT we ARE CoMING To.
THE Yule-tide attraction at Tonge's
Theatre this year, a play performed
entirely by grown-ups, is certain to
draw large audiences, if only by reason
of its piquant novelty. Spectators at
the opening performance were enthu-
siastic over the quaint spectacle, and
when at its conclusion the manager
appeared before the curtain, leading by
the hand a lady who could not have
been a day less than thirty-five, the
applause was tremendous. Now that
the parents have a play written and
acted especially for them, they will
assuredly clamour to see it, and Mr.
Tonge has very wisely arranged to give
two performances daily of The Herodians
till further notice.
Peter Pan celebrated his fifty-sixth
birthday at the Citizen York's Theatre
last evening, and is apparently as fresh
and popular as ever. We are relieved
to notice that at least one line in Act III.,
inexcusably mutilated in (we believe)
the edition of 1934, is now restored to
its original form. Another victory for
the most enlightened government of
modern times!
At other London houses the usual
theatrical fare of the season continues
in brisk demand. Drury Lane, now
more than ever the nursery of the British
drama, has again followed the precedent
of the last twenty years in producing
a spectacular kindergarten play, an-
nounced as the work of the youngest
littérateur yet living. The entire book
of the piece has, we understand, been
dictated to a staff of nurses, the talented
author being at present unable to read
or write. As usual, a noteworthy feature
is made of the orchestra, this year
augmented by a number of rattles and
coral bells, an innovation for which the
audience on Boxing Night testified their
approval by their hearty reception of
Master Glover, minimus, on that talented
youngster being lifted into the con-
ductor's seat.
Meanwhile a striking echo of bygone
taste was afforded last Sunday evening
at the Galsworthy Hall, where a dis-
tinguished gathering of serious play-
goers assembled to witness the much-
talked-of revival of Cinderella, a Christ-
mas Pantomime, by members of the
Defunct Drama Society. The perform-
ance, if a trifle esoteric for popular
enjoyment, proved on the whole unde-
niably interesting, care having been
taken to ensure absolute accuracy of
mounting — even to such details as
coloured fires and the introduction of
a genuine contemporary moon ſcoon 2)

was so archaic as to be unintelligible

superior members of the audience
affected to laugh hugely over such
passages as the Baron's reference to
tired kippers, or the demand by his
eccentric wife for female suffrage, or-
dinary individuals might well be excused
for wondering what it was all about.
The experiment, though of some his-
torical value, is hardly likely to be
repeated.
“The terms were tempting, even for Madame
Sarah Bernhardt: £4,000 for twenty-four per-
formances in a month, each performance in a
sketch to last ten minutes. This works out at
a good deal over a guinea and a half a minute.”

It does indeed. What a lesson in
moderation might be drawn by Candi-
dates from the restrained methods of
this statistician.
Fashion Hints.
“It is becoming usual now for men when
calling to leave their hat and stick in the hall,
except when foreigners.”—Daily Mail.
Even in the case of a native the hat and
stick may be taken into the drawing-
room if it is understood that the visitor
has called with the express purpose of
thrashing his host. The hat, replaced
on the head, will serve as a protection
against retaliation.

was broken into during Friday night. . . . The

It must have been a brisk affair while
it lasted. Why should canvassers have
it all their own way? -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
ELECTIONS AND THINGs.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--There's not much
left of your Blanche, after a strenuous
time working to save the country. But
I don't complain. One's country doesn't
have to be saved very often, and saving
it makes quite a nice break in one's
ordinary amusements. It behoves us all
(isn't that a lovely phrase? I
begin almost everything with
it now !) to stand together,
and join hands, and stem the
tide, and all that sort of thing,
don't you think?
We were having a rippin'
time down at the Middle-
shires' when Norty told us
we'd all got to go to town
and help to save the country.
It was in this way. His old
constituents in the North have
turned out to be pigs of the
first magnitude. They say
they don't want him for their
Member any longer, that he
hasn't kept the promises he
made them or introduced any
of the measures he said he
would, but has flourished away
on his own, making speeches
on subjects they don't care
tuppence about. He says
they're a rotten crowd, and
that they may—but never
mind about that. So he's
standing for Grimy Green, a
weird North-Eastern suburb
of London that I'd never
even heard of, and there I've
been working myself half
dead for a fortnight. Oh, the
dingy little parlours I've
penetrated to and the immense
amount of information I've
given in these two weeks'
The big loaf, the little loaf,
the tall loaf, the short loaf,
the black loaf, the white loaf
—I’d no idea I knew so
much about loaves or any-
thing else! (D'you want a
wrinkle in canvassing, my
would be that their election colours
might be more becoming to her com-
plexion.
Talking of colours, my darling Pom-
pom is a bit affaissé now that doggies
have to match frocks, and I can only
wear him when I'm dressed in brown.
At the place I go to for match-dogs
they're awfully clever at dyeing them.
One of my canvassing days I was in
blue, with a blue dog, and another day
together as they used to be. She's
taken to writing impressionist stories
and plays, and she does such queer
things and goes to such queer places to
get local colour and first-hand impres-
sions that Bosh says he won't stand
much more of it. One thing she did
when she was writing Lurid London
was to get herself up en pauvresse and
go and sit on a seat on the Embankment
one evening. She got into chat with

wit ºf Anº
a pcor man, who told her he
was out of a job and hadn't
had anything to eat for a fort-
night. This was a simply
rippin' bit of local colour for
Wee-Wee. She didn't know
people could go so long with-
out food. She said she was a
needlewoman who couldn't
get any needling to do, that
she'd been turned out of her
lodgings that day—and she
went on yarning till she gave
herself away (just like her l),
and the man who'd had no-
thing to eat for a fortnight
turned on her and said,
“You’re a fraud I know
you now. You're Wee-Wee
Tresyllyan, and I shall get no
local colour from you!” And
Wee-Wee said, “And I know
you—and you're a fraud—
and I shall get no local colour
from you. You're Ray Rym-
ington.” And so it was, and
he was out to get first-hand
impressions for his poem,
The City of Terrible Tears.

THE ERNEST SMILES SELF-
HELP RESTAURANT.
(Extracts from Prospectus)
“ExpºRIMENTUM IN CompoRE SMILI.”
MR. ERNEST SMILEs, before resorting
to the Self-Help regimen, suffered from
cramp, club feet, diplopia, elasmobrar-
chitis, pongo-pongo, the gorbles, and
many other incurable ailments. He has
now eliminated them all from his system
and has demonstrated that he has benefited
mentally as well as physically from the
new treatment, by writing: (1) Spiritual
Law in the Vegetable World; (2) Suction
Gas Breathing (the standard work Cn
the subject); by composing his famous
Honey Pudding Polka, dedicated to Mrs.
Tita Bedale, and by winning back the
Vegetarian Spillikins Championship in
his forty-third year.
TRIAL TRIPs by FAMOUs FEEDERs.
Before Mr. SMILES opened his Self-
Help Restaurant to the public he had his
recipes tested at sample meals by no
fewer than six hundred private guests,
with striking results. Among those
guests were the Head Master of ETON,
the Countess RATz, Mr. Victor GRAYSON,
Mr. STEwART GRAY (the famous Hunger
marcher), Mrs. Chickering Chipp, Mr.
ARTIIUR PONSONBY (author of The Needle
in the Camel's Eye), the Countess of
WARwick, Archdeacon SINCLAIR, Miss
TRULY SHATTUck, ALGERNoN ASHTON, Esq.,
Mr. ALEXANDER URE (the Lord Advo-
cate), Dr. Bodie, Mr. Cody, Mr. P. G.
KONODY, and others. -
AN ATTRACTIVE INTERIOR.
As you enter you see on both sides
and in front of you various books
by Mr. and Mrs. Smiles on theo-
logical as well as culinary topics;
also their famous batterie de cuisine
(including the motorious Collectivist
Colander, the Esoteric Nutmeg Scraper,
the Deep Sea Biplane Fryer with poly-
phonic gear) and various food specialities
(such as Desiccated Infants' Soup Snuff,
Proletariate Palatinoids, Salsify Galan-
tine, Beet-root Chocolate, Mud Bath
Buns, Iceland Moss Méringues, etc.).
Beyond are the tables gay with bunting
—Sir PERCY is himself an occasional
visitor—and the waitresses with their
deeply spiritual lineaments, magnificent
checelures and rich meatless fruity
contrºllto voices.
STRANGE MEAL-FELLOWs.
As Mr. Harold Bulbo once happily
remarked, the Self-Help Restaurant is
the Cranks' Clearing House. Here you
may see a notorious Mayfair roué
mingling his tears with those of a re-
tired bath-chair proprietor from Rother-
hithe; a prize-fighter unaware that his
next-door neighbour is in the running
for the Laureateship; an archdeacon
hobnobbing with a fruitarian secularist;
a famous actress terrified by the proxi-
mity of Mr. Willia M ARCHER; an inter-
national Rugby three-quarter fascinated
by the adjacence of a militant Suf-
ragette; or an athletic musician sharing
a salmi of toad-stoo's with an anaemic
musical critic.
Societies which PATRONISE THE
RESTAURANT.
Among the Societies that have held
meetings at the Self-Help Restaurant
are The Universal Interference League,
The Vegetable Marrowtime League, The
Scilly lslands Suffrage Association, The
Banbury Cake Walkers, The Anti-Tannin
Tea Tasters, The Cryptic Skipping-
rope Guild, The Teetotal Ballet-dancers'

Vegetarian Sandwichmen, The Phreno-
logical Temperance Wind Band, The
Christian Science Sea-kale Club, The
Anti-Bootlace Association, The Side-

tarian Lion-food Institute, The Society
for the Promotion of Kindness to Crimi-

SOLVING THE SERVANT PROBLEM. |
GENTLEMEN, will you be good enough
to range yourselves outside the door for
a moment, while I explain, for the bene-
fit of anybody who happens to be
reading this, who you are, who I am,
why you are on one side of the door and
I on the other. At the end of that time
I hope to be in a fit condition to admit
you. -
What happened, as counsel says, was
this : —William and I agreed to share a
flat in the Temple, and, having so agreed
and told each other how nice that would
be, we proceeded to take the flat and to
occupy the same. Being mere men,
we were a little surprised and pained to
find no furniture in the rooms when we
got there, for we had always imagined.
that rooms would at least furnish them-
selves. With the assistance of a West
End firm, who had been established in
the year 2 A.D. and on this occasion did
most of the talking as befitted their age,
we overcame that difficulty and settled
down to hive our happy life. But there
were other surprises waiting for us.
Rooms, it appears, are not only too lazy
to furnish themselves but will not even
take the trouble to clean themselves.
Breakfast neither cooks nor lays itself,
and things, speaking generally, do not
happen unless they are made to. -
Realising this with the utmost diffi-
culty, we set about cooking and arrang-
ing a meal for ourselves, about which’
processes the less said the better.
Suffice it that we managed to allay our
immediate hunger and to nourish our-
selves sufficiently to be able to smoke
our pipes. Packing, lighting and com-
busting tobacco is the one process that
men can satisfactorily manage for them-
selves. |
They were ample pipes, but eventually:
even they gave out. We felt physically:
comfortable but morally anxious as to
why the remnants of our food stayed
on the table so long. At last we were
forced to the reluctant conclusion that
the clearing of breakfast tables is another
of those things which do not happen
but are done. Food, plates, knives and
forks will apparently sit on as you left
them for ever unless menial pressure is
brought to bear on them.

Chorus of Unemployables. “What O !”
“William,” I said, “this table ought
to be cleared by now.”
“It ought,” he answered. “I will
ring the bell for the servants.”
“There is no bell,” I reminded him,
wearily, “and there are no servants.”
“Then,” he said, “you must get a
servant,” and forthwith went off to stay
with his people in the country. That
was a week ago.
At first I could not think how one
gets a servant. Now that I have men-
tioned the matter to my lady friends, I
cannot think how one does not get fifty
servants. It almost appears that these
ladies do do something sometimes. Can
it be the fact that they do not spend all
their days idling in armchairs and look-
ing beautiful? Can it be the truth
that, when we men regard ourselves as
going off to work in the morning, we
are in reality being turned out of our
own homes to go and do nothing but
look important somewhere—where it does
not matter, while the women are busy
managing that part of the world that
does matter? Anyhow, I had only to
mention my servant difficulty to a few
of the leading members of the sex to be
besieged by applicants. A word in
your ear, before you make any invidious
remarks: the gentlemen outside the
door are the said applicants. Let m2
tell you why they are outside.
It is now ten o'clock a.m., the
appointed hour for the interviews of
candidates. The first knock woke me
up. Why I was still then in bed was
because last night was the first occasion
on which I had succeeded in making a
bed possible to sleep in. If I was thus
unpunctual, it was not likely that one
of the fifty competitors for the post of
honour would give himself away by
being late on the first morning, so that
before I had nearly completed my bath
they had all arrived. There then they
all are on the other side of the door
clamouring for admittance. “But,”
you will say, “surely it is the servant's
job and not yours to open the front
door?” My dear friends, you show that
you are no more intelligent than William
by the way you harp on servants that
do not exist. The whole of my potential
staff is on the wrong side of the latch,
and I . . . But that was in my ludicrous
and almost indecent past. Now I am
dressed and physically capable of open-
ing a door.
Welcome, gentlemen, to my modest
premises. One of you is to be my loyal
if incompetent manservant. The ques-
tion is, which 2 Come, you shall all
set yourselves to work. Cook this morn-
ing's breakfast, wash yesterday's break-
fast things, clean the seven pairs of
boots that are waiting to be cleaned and
remove the débris of a week from my
sitting-room. The man who does his
work best is the successful candidate.
Set to, gentlemen, for I have the hunger
of a week in me. Once that is satisfied,
I shall be most genial and easy to get on
with. Who knows that I may not be so
happy and pleased with life as to engage
the whole fifty of you on the spot?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Although a good deal of the plot of The Settler (HopDER
AND STOUGHTON) is laid, as the name suggests, on virgin soil,
I must confess that I prefer, as being more thrilling, that
lesser part which is enacted in the outskirts of civilised
Winnipeg. Some twenty-five years ago, I gather, Winnipeg
had a colony of Slavs of all varieties–Polak, Croatian,
Magyar, and the rest—and they enjoyed nothing so much
as a two days' marriage feast in true native style, with
unlimited beer and a fight and a fair sprinkling of knife-
wounds to finish up. Some of the members of this colony
were anarchists with a great yearning to liberate Russia
from the yoke of the tyrant—men who had escaped from
Siberia, or just missed going - -
mountain, the scene of a tragic episode in the story. Great
grey crags, “massed in the grim indifference of everlasting
strength.” Pamela, the heiress, is a charming study of the
American girl. More subtle is the portrayal of her father,
patiently but unwillingly dragged by the chariot-wheels of
a vulgarly ambitious wife who doesn't mean to go back
“home” and face her friends until she has captured at least
the eldest son of a peer. By a pleasant paradox Faces in
the Mist is a breezy book, full of life and colour.
When I was a child I found many disadvantages in my
condition. I looked forward with confidence to growing up
and becoming important. Now authors and playwrights
combine to make me ashamed of being no longer a child.
To-day it is not the thing to be grown up. Indeed, Mr.
ALGERNoN BLACKwood suggests and warmly advocates a cure
- - — for adultness. The Education of
there. There are exciting times
in such company, and Mr. RALPh
CoNNOR provides these liberally.
We are introduced to a blood
feud (I will kill him. I have
sworn the oath ! Aha!), and
things are lively until Kalmar,
the avenger, is whipped away by
the strong arm of the law. But
of course an ordinary prison
cannot hold him, and one looks
for a brisk renewal of hostilities.
The author, however, has a lot
of local colour about settlers to
work off, and so there is a long
interval of settling, of a peace-
able nature, during which one
waits patiently for the reappear-
ance of Kalmar and the fulfil-
ment of the oath. At the end
of the book he comes, but with
a disappointing explosion-scheme
which backfires and does for
him as well as his victim. I
was rather sorry about that, be-
cause, though Kalmar was an
unpleasant customer, he was
better than the other man, and
I had a sneaking regard for him.
But I daresay that is my bad taste.
Uncle Paul (MACMILLAN) is under-
taken by Niece Nizie, and
directed to this point: that you
can be a child even up to the
ripe age of eighty provided you
take the right view of things.
You must, as Uncle Paul soon
learns, stop trying to look serious;
you must realise that clouds and
dreams are the things that mat-
ter, that politics and meals are the
things that do not. Niacie herself
is the sweetest child, full of
imagination and affection, wis-
dom and inconsequence. As a
teacher she is less satisfactory,
even tiresome. She knows too
much; she explains too logically.
Children, I know, can find their
way “through the crack which
divides yesterday from to-day,”
but when they discuss that pro-
cess metaphysically they cease
to be children. Thus, charmed
though I was with the phantasy. ||
and the poetry of the book, I
came at the end of it to three
prosaic and rather dismal con-
clusions. The first, that we
tend nowadays to spoil the
The characters revolving
round the Faces in the Mist – `-
(CLARKE) are not wholly unfamiliar to the novel reader.
There is the nouveau riche American who comes over to
the still Free Trade market with a marriageable daughter.
There is the heir-apparent to a peerage who in consulta-
tion with his father, impecunious equally with himself,
comes to the conclusion that the million sterling under-
stood to be the dowry pertaining to the imported article is
worth annexing to an ancient barony. Lastly, there is the
British lover, untitled and not too wealthy, who enters the
lists against the embarrassed heir of the noble backwoods-
man, in the end unhorses him and carries off the prize.
These are the puppets of the play, of a class not specially
attractive. That makes the more creditable the success
achieved by Mr. STEUART. He tells a rattling good story,
artfully set in succession in the effectively varied back-
grounds of the Highlands and Egypt. He has a great gift
of presenting in a few strokes a scenic picture. Through the
centuries prose and verse have been lavished on the eternal
hills; yet I do not remember anything more briefly or more
finely phrased than Mr.SIEUART's passing impression of a Scotch

that about 30 per cent. of the contested Liberal boroughs had gone over

boroughs have with hardly an exception proved true. It now only
remains for the counties to do the same, and the grandest victory of our

The well-informed elector's eye,
Then I can only say, “O Fil”
Or else “Tut, tut! AUGUSTINE.”
The West, to which your message flew,
Defying facts as well as distance,
Is not the Wild West; it can do
These little sums of two and two
Nicely, without assistance.
Not only clever clerks on stools
But fat-head ploughmen in the furrows,
Recalling certain simple rules
Imbibed in elementary schools,
Had totted up the boroughs.
Your West, in fact, had got to know
(You can't deceive these Occidentals)
That three in every ten or so
Who held The Faith four years ago
Had changed their fundamentals.
“Scarce an exception ?” Ah, the touch
That lends to Truth a gloss and glamour !
I only hope you did as much
With those “exceptions”—verbs and such—
In your Hellenic grammar. -
Still, you are just the same to me,
Thanks to old ties I would not dissipate;
And, after all, these things must be
In every famous victory
Like that which you anticipate.
So in the West where this occurred
May Charity extend her bounties,
Saying, “The wish begot the word; "
But please don't make the same absurd
Mistake about the counties' O. S.
Taking German Leave.
The North-German Gazette, anxious to conceal the eager
desire of the Germans for the victory of the Liberal Party,
says:—“To whichever side, whether Conservative or Liberal,
the majority of the British people gives the preference, we
have, for our part, always regarded it as a matter for the
British people to decide.”
Many thanks for this very gracious concession.

stance connected with the elect on result. If the figures for each

ogether with 741, the figure by which Mr. Knott beat Mr Stuart, the

SIR,--I have received your letter and have made enquiries
of the driver of my car. He tells me that on Monday last
he was driving very slowly and carefully owing to a fog, and
was sounding his horn at frequent intervals. According to
his account he was hardly moving at all when he met your
cows, and he was on his right side of the road. No
accident appears to have happened, but one of the cows
slightly grazed the motor when it was almost at a standstill.
It is plain that you were not exercising sufficient control over
your cows, and under the circumstances I cannot see that
you are entitled to any compensation, more especially as my
man assures me that the cow was in no way injured and
immediately rejoined her companions.
Yours faithfully, RONALD CAMPION.

Rumoured Deafness of a Colonial Premier.
The Canadian House of Commons has overwhelmingly
rejected a motion to abolish the Second Chamber. In
opposing this motion Sir WILFRID, LAURIER is reported to
have said that he had “never heard it suggested, even by the
most Radical of Radicals, that the House of Lords should be
done away with.” If Sir WiLFRID has failed to catch the
trumpet-notes of our Radical Press, we are afraid that he
must be suffering from a serious defect of the tympanum.
THE BOY IN THE STREET.
TheRE's an undersized tyrant who governs our lives,
From whom the police have no power to protect us,
A cynic whose sarcasm always “arrives,”
Who, though we’re his betters, declines to respect us;
The hurling of gibes is his principal joy,
And the “man in the street” is no match for “the boy.”
With hands in his pockets and jaws on the munch
He comes, an unwashed but intelligent creature;
On his mouth the remains of his breakfast and lunch
Form a permanent crust round that flexible feature;
His manners are easy though hardly discreet;
He's the crudest of critics, the boy in the street.
In taste he's a Tory, impatient of change,
And the costume that marks an inflexion of fashion
Is greeted as soon as it comes into range
With a gesture of scorn or a start of compassion;
His comments are rude and his juvenile squeak
Brings a frown to the brow or a blush to the cheek.
Oh, child' you are hardly aware of the power
Of the sceptre you wield in sartorial matters;
Your influence governs our taste in the hour
When we're making a choice at the hosier's or hatter's;
And the “latest creation” or “ultra smart line,”
With you at the back of our heads, we decline.

JEBBOMANIA.
A STUDY IN OBSEssiox.
[Extracted from “The Mou ning Post " of
April 1, 1911.]
NoticF.
THE proprietors of this journal have
decided to change its title from The
Mourning Post—the name assumed on
the ever-memorable date of January 18,
1910—to The Daily Jebb.
[E.ctract from Leading Article.]
The year opened ominously for
England with the abolition of the Second
Chamber, the disfranchisement of all
persons with incomes of more than
£5,000 a year, the disbanding of our
regular army and the inauguration of
the Irish Republic. But it is always
desirable to retain a due sense of per-
spective in politics, and these disasters,
serious as they undoubtedly are, have
been altogether dwarfed and eclipsed
by the imperial catastrophe which it is
our painful duty to announce to our
readers to-day. Mr. RICHARD JEBB is
suffering from an attack of influenza,
and although the latest reports point to
his speedy recovery from this depressing
ailment, at least two, possibly three,
days must elapse before he is restored
to the full exercise of his unparalleled
and superhuman powers. Meantime
all that we can do is to assure our in-
comparable leader that the hearts of all
his devoted followers go out to him in
his affliction, and that they are more
than ever resolved to spare no effort
and stint no endeavour until the
nefarious plague-spot of crypto-Cecilian
Frce Trade has been everlastingly eradi-
cated from the body politic.
ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
Polling in the South Salford division
—where a vacancy was caused by the
appointment of Mr. BELLOC to the Vice-
royalty of India – took place yesterday,
with the following result:-
J. PERKINS (Lab.) ...... 6,120
F. Evans (U.) ............ 6,104
R. JEBB (Jebbite) ...... 310
Mr. RICHARD JEBB, in an interview
with a representative of The Daily Jebb,
said that he was entirely satisfied with
the result. Not only had he purified
his poll by fifty per cent. since his last
candidature, but he had succeeded in
rescuing the Unionist Party from the
humiliation of being represented by a
man who was tainted by the Free Trade
heresy. It was true that Mr. EVANs
declared his adhesion to the principles
of Tariff Reform, but it was none the
less true that Mr. EVANs's wife's step-
sister had once been engaged to the
brother of a dºctor who had attended
IMPERIAL VERSE CoMPETITION.
The adjudicators in this competition
have awarded the prize of £100 to Sir
HENRY MORRIS, who sent in the following
set of verses:—
“Two heroes in the selfsame country
born
The Channel and East Marylebone
did adorn.
The first with ocean's wildest waves
did wrestle
The second overthrew Lord Robert
CECIL.
Nature, improving on great Captain
WEBB,
When England's fame was at its
lowest ebb,
Produced the ever-glorious RICHARD
JEBB.”
NATIONAL TESTIMONIAL.
The subscriptions for the National and
Imperial Testimonial have now reached
a total of £2,409 16s. 11d. Amongst
the latest subscribers are the following:

The Committee entrusted with the
task of determining the form of the
testimonial have now unanimously re-
ported in favour of the erection in
the courtyard of the Hotel Cecil of a
colossal group of statuary representing
the modern Rich ARD COEUR DE Llox
slaying the Dragon of Free Trade.
NEWS FROM ALL QUARTERs.
We have received the gratifying in-
telligence that the University of Wool-
loomoolloo has conferred the honorary
degree of D.I.T. (Doctor of Imperial
Thought) on Mr. RICHARD JEBB for his
noble services to the Empire.
Telegrams from New York state that
the re idents in the post-hamlet of Cecil,
Washington Co., Pa., by an overwhelm-
ing majority have resolved to change its
name to that of Jebbville, as a tribute of
their undying respect to the greatest
Imperialist of the Twentieth Century.
We have received a message signed
by three hundred prominent Tierra del
Fuegians conveying their deep and loyal
sympathy with the policy of this paper
and stating that at a public meeting Lord

II.-ABANAZAR.
ALIIIotch when I saw him on the
previous night he had been covered
with grease paint and was dressed out-
landishly, I recognised him instantly
by his voice, a mellow, fruity organ, in
which he said everything four times–
that being at once one of his humorous
tricks and a device to conceal the fact
that he had never allowed his part to
distress him, if indeed a part had been
written for him at all—a voice, too, in
which he said without thinking again most
of the things that ran through his nimble
and exceedingly sophisticated mind.
“I am glad to meet you,” I said,
“because I saw your performance last
might, and one or two things you said
perplexed me a little.”
He laughed. “That often happens,”
he replied. “You see, I say a few
things at most performances purely for
a few friends in the stalls, or even for
the other actors.”
“Oh, do you?” I remarked. “That's
very interesting. How do the authors
like it 2 ”
“Authors!” He was really amused
this time. “I never act in plays where
the authors count.”
“Well, then,” I said, “how do the
audience like it?”
“Oh, they like it, of course. Look at
the crowded houses.”
“Yes—but look at the crowded cast
too. Is it all for you?”
He let that pass.
“Any way, ' I said, “granted the
fascination of hearing a comedian say
things that one cannot understand,
surely there must be a certain residuum
who rather like to see the point of every
joke.”
He admitted it.
“And isn't it a children's panto-
mime 2 ” I added.
“Of course.”
about this.
“And if a grown-up person misses
some of the inwardness, wouldn't a
child miss even more?”
He had to agree.
“Well, is that quite playing the
game 2'' -
“Oh, come,” he said, “one can't say
everything for children.”
“Why not?”
“Well, it's a grown-up show too, you
know.”
“But don't such grown-ups as go
willingly reduce themselves to children?
Isn't that rather the idea? Especially
nowadays with so much confessedly
purely childish competition ?”
He did not argue the point.

children will be made happy : "

“It's simple enough, isn't it?”
“Well, that's just it. If it is really
simple it's anything but humour for
children. It either means something or
nothing. If it means nothing it's no
great shakes as a simile; if it means
anything it means too much.”
“Oh, I say, aren't you overdoing the

“Not a bit—at a children's panto-

one does not get them, I should say
nothing. But not at a pantomime.”

of Abanazar consistently—if you really

audience know your purposes and
reasons, that plea might stand; but you
don't. In a pantomime notable for the
realistic faithfulness of the Aladdin and

SOME SEASONABLE TABLE
DELICACIES.
1. The St. KILDA Hold-ALL.-It is
not always wise to transplant a local
dish, but the following instructions will
afford, if carefully carried out, an
excellent imitation of a favourite luxury
of the Lonely Isle. Take two strips
of seasoned old leather four inches
wide and about nine in length. Cut
up a bar of yellow soap into little
cubes, mix these with tasty odds
and ends from the pantry (scraps of
cheese-rind, potato-peelings, or jam-
labels), add three penny pieces of
indiarubber, shredded finely, and spread
the mixture thickly over one of the
strips. Pepper it well, cover carefully
| with remaining strip, then let a saddler
or a shoemaker machine the two edges
thoroughly—the lockstitch will be best
in case any of the contents try to escape.
Bake in a stewpan for ten hours and
serve hot. Get a good grip and bite
well into it, and the result will be most
satisfying.
2. PLUM PUDDING.-Put a quart of
water into a saucepan (press it in
tightly) and set on a quick fire. Pour
in two currants, having first sorted
them and wiped them well with a damp

cloth; have a piece of wood handy to
hit them if they should get nasty and
try to hop out. Colour with one
teaspoonful of red sandstone. Now
make a thick paste of brickdust and
flour and stir it in. Brood over it for
twenty minutes or so, and when the
whole thing begins to set, arrange the
two currants in any pretty pattern on
the top, and leave it to cool. Chop
it out of the saucepan and serve as
required, garnished with holly and
onions. This pudding will keep for
months.
3. TURNIps A LA RUSSE.—Hollow out
two large turnips as though you
intended to construct a turnip-lantern,
rub the insides with camphorated oil,
and prepare the following ingredients:
One carriage candle shaved down
finely, wick removed ; half-a-pint of
sawdust (to give consistency); a pound
of suet, and the shells of six walnuts.
Melt the wax and stir in the sawdust;
melt the suet and stir in the walnut-
shells (which must be smashed up well);
melt the lot, and add whatever flavour-
ing you prefer — a peppermint-drop
gives piquancy, but many persons use
a pinch of acetylene gas. Then, while
the mixture is still semi-fluid, stuff it
into the turnips, and glue a piece of
wood over the apex. Boil for one hour,
remove lids, cut in slices and serve
at once. If any are left they make
splendid fire-lighters.

A TALK WITH ONE OF OUR
DUMB PETS.
“How would you like it yourself?”
said a peevish voice.
i I looked carefully round the room
but saw nothing. The voice continued,
however. - - -
“It’s no use your trying to see me—
I'm too small; but you can talk to me
if you like.”...
“Very well,” I replied ; “to begin
with, what are you?”
“I’m a microbe,” was the disconcert-
ing answer. “Oh, it's all right; I
shan't hurt you, old chap; I'm not as
bad as I'm magnified to be, and I've
taken a fancy to you.”
My first impulse was to shrink from
the speaker, but in the absence of any
idea as to his position, I kept my seat.
“You haven't answered my question
yet,” the microbe continued -“how
would you like it yourself?”
“Like what?”
“Why, all this badgering and moving-
on business | It's making life unbear-
able for us microbes.”
I nodded sympathetically in the direc-
tion of the voice.
“In the old days one could have some
fun What with fevers and wars and a
decent plague every few years, one could
put in a pretty good time; but now it’s
all medical congresses and carbolic acid
It's simply sickening.” -
I acquiesced vaguely, as the speaker
seemed to expect something from me.
“I tell you, I’m fed up with life in
this country, and if I only get a decent
chance I'll clear out of it. Why, what
do you think happened last week 2 A
snuffy old fool in a frock-coat and spring-
side boots shut me up in a beastly little
test-tube and lectured on me ! If I had
not been fairly spry I shouldn't be talk-
ing to you now, for if you'll believe me
the brute gave orders to have me put in
boiling water | Fortunately the servant
dr pped me instead, and I managed to
escape. But it was a near thing, I can
tell you ! I’m shuddering now, but of
course you can't see.”
As a fact, I was myself feeling any-
thing but comfortable, but refrained
from making any observation.
“Perhaps I ought not to grumble too
much, though,” continued the voice ;
“I’ve had some gºod times, I must
confess. I had the happy luck once to
spend the best part of a year in a sar-
dine tin. It was grand ' There was a
Colony of us, and we were as sociable a
lot of bacilli as you'd wish to meet. All
friendly and jolly and as thick as —well,
very matey, anyhow. But of course it
wasn't to last. I think there must have
been a Jonah among us. What do you
th nk happen, d? An inspector fellow
cane along and condemned us! Yes, it's
a fact, I assure you; he simply opened
the tin, glanced at us in a most casual
way, and ordered us to be destroyed
That's the sort of thing that makes
microbes wretched.”
“You escaped, however,” I observed,
somewhat unnecessarily perhaps.
“Rather I escaped, and retired to a
slum that I know of. I should be there
now, no doubt, but some interfering
council or board came and pulled me
down . The alley, I mean. I hung
about the neighbourhood as long as I
could, but it was no good, I had to
shift again. Now I'm here.”
There was an awkward pause.
“Oh, you needn't look so panicky,”
continued the visitor; “as I said before
I rather like you, but I couldn't dream
of staying here permanently. Why not?
Well, if you must know, there's a con-
founded draught in this room, and a
great deal too much sunshine to suit me.
I hate to say rude things to a host, but
it's the truth . . . .
“I lost my best friend not long ago;
and it's wretched for a microbe to be
alone in the world, I can tell you. Dear
old Rex, he and I were the best of pals
and never had an angry word. We
were spores together, and were brought
up in the same glycerine. Ever lived in
glycerine? No? Well, it isn't all it's
cracked up to be, you can take it from
me. Poor Rex is gone now—sterilised
to death ! He hung on as long as he
could, but I could see the end was near,
when he became an attenuated virus.
Rex absolutely wasted to nothing, and
couldn't even look at a guinea-pig! He
was one of the best.” -
My visitor was silent for a few
moments: when he resumed he spoke
in a more hopeful tone.
“Now the winter is here,” he said,
“I intend to have a change. One can’t
go on for ever in laboratories stuck be-
tween sheets of glass. It's too narrow
an existence for me. Where am I going?
Ah, that's telling; for all I know you're
an inspector person yourself! Still, I
don't mind saying it's in the country,
and it's a pond with any amount of
weed and stuff on it. Perhaps I shall
have a quiet time there, and not be
chased about from pillar to post. It
seems too good to be true, but I'll give
it a trial anyway. Good-night.”

The encyclopedia fell from my hands
and I looked at the clock. It was four
in the morning and there was a draught
in the room.

“But I can't,” I cried in agony.
“How awful! Is she in the house

“Yes, she's waiting in the drawing-
room—I came to fetch you.”
“Well, I suppose I'd better find the
picture-loto,” I said. -
In the old days picture-loto had been
the great resource in all our French
lessons. It was a very convenient game
because you only had to say things like
“Le lapin–comme il est grand ' " and
“Loiseau—comme il est joi!” and you
got through the hour in fine style.
“Don’t be si ly,” said my sister.
“We can't ask Madmasel to play
picture-loto now. She hasn't come in
her professional capacity—she’s come
to tea.” -
I shook hands thoughtfully with the
air. “Bon jour, Madmasel’—'com-

quite carelessly that we were just going
to play a game of picture-loto when she

But outside the drawing-room door
I stopped, for I had come to a great

The oNLY AMUsing PERson was THE MAN IN THE FANCY DREss.”
The worst had befallen me. I was
solemnly to relate a little story of my
morning promenade. I thought des-
perately. I would say I never took
walks, or I would say that I was not at
liberty to make my adventures public—
anything to escape.
Meanwhile Madmasel repeated the
request, and my sister threw in a little
unnecessary translation, adding insult
to injury, for I lealised only too clearly
what was before me.
“Alors,” I began cautiously.
vu un chien, vous savez—”
“Et qu'est qu'il faisait ce chien.”’’
This was unfair. I had not thought
of that.
“Il—il—il marchait, vous savez.” It
seemed a trifle weak as a story, so I
tried again. “Il voulait traverser la
route et puis un—une–un automobile
squashaitle chien.”
“O—o-oh, pauvre petit—mais ces

I felt I had gone too far. Madmasel's
feelings had been needlessly harrowed.
I tried to modify the narrative.
“Est-ce-que j'ai dit un chien 2'' I
asked. “J'avais tort. C'était un chat
tout-le-temps—le chat comme il est
méchant, n'est ce pas ?”
Madmasel had never liked cats.
“A propos des moutons,” I continued,
the subtleties of the language coming to
me as I gained confidence. “Laissons
mous tous jou, run parti de picture-loto,
quoi? Qaserait bien gentil pour le sake
d'Auld Lang Syne, n'est ce pas?”
Madmasel seeming at a loss, my sister
endeavoured to explain that I had a
great longing to play the game again.
“Oui, oui,” I said, “le lapin comme
il est grand, vous savez, n'est ce pas ?
Je cherche.”
I honestly did go to look for it, but
somehow it seemed impossible to return,
and I hid in the box-room until the
front-door had closed behind her.

“Sir Herbert Tree could scarcely
have made a more interesting announce-
ment than that he has acquired a new
play from Mr. Zangwill's pen,” says
The Westminster Gazette. We venture
to differ. He could have announced
(to give only one instance) that he was
about to grow a beard, and oppose Mr.
WINSTON CHURCHILL at the next General
Election.

THE LAST LAP.
[For the benefit of Orkney and Shetland and
other belated constituencies Mr. Punch pub-
lishes the following gems which a correspon-
dent his forwarded with the request that they
may be distributed among suitable organs of
the Press.]
For The Manchester Guardian.-
There has been no such crisis in English
constitutional history since the last
occasion on which the Peers struck an
effective blow at the People's rights, in
the memorable contest of 1066.
For The Daily News –A spirited
brochure, under the leading of “The
Duke Goes Caravanning” (showing how
the Duke travelled a whole week without
going off his own LAND) is about to be
issued (1) in pamphlet form, (2) as a
poster 47 feet by 3, (3) as a private
telegram from Mr. CLESTERTON
For The Daily Express.-We publish
to-day a remarkable cablegram from Our
Special Correspondent in New York,
showing that the custom of giving away
grand pianos as Christmas gifts is
rapidly spreading among the working-
class population of America.
For The Daily Chronicle. —Lord
LANsdowne's letter, as we read it—we
may be wrong, but it isn't likely—means
not only that Old Age Pensions will be
discontinued under a Unionist Govern-
ment; there is in it, we think, a hidden
threat of an endeavour to recover the
money alread v spent by TAXING old AGE.
For The Westminster Gaze'te.—The
Bread Line in New York on Saturday
Was FOUR MILES LONG.
For Reynolds'.-Lord LANSDowne is
threatening to rear pheasants in Hyde
Park—the People's playground.
For The Observer.—We sav once more
—and it won't be our fault if we fail to
make you believe it—that it is entirely
a matter of taste. The German work-
man prefers the fruity, positive flavour
of biack bread to the insipid, negative
flavour of wheaten bread. The latter,
indeed, of which there is no lack in
Prussia, is largely used for feeding
horses, and this fact in some measure
accounts for the admirable flavour of
their horse-flesh, so different from that
of our own bus horses.
For The Daily Chronicle.—Every vote
for the Tory is a vote imperilling Old
Age Pensions. [We fear it is no use
sending this to The Daily Chronicle. It
used these very words as headlines only
the other day during the elections.]
For The Morning Leader.—The truth
about KRupp's. Their enormous output
of sewing-machines explained. They
Have NO OTHE., WORK TO DO.
For The Daily Express. –Tariff
Reform means cheaper boots, meat for
half-price, and BREAD GRATIS.
For The Star.—Tariff Reform means
SUDDEN DEATH.
For The Daily News.-Vote for the
Liberal and Old Age Pensions at 50.
For The Daily Mail.-Vote for the
Unionist and Old Age Pensions from
the cradle to the grave.
“THE TITS' INTELLIGENCER.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am in a difficulty,
and I need help. I have hung up in
the garden a number of cocoanuts with
one end sawn off, revealing the most
alluring and appetising cavern; but no
birds come. They have been hanging
there for a month; but no birds come.
The cocoanut meat is white and juicy;
but no birds come. What shall I do?
It seems that some bird gazette—some
Tits' Intelligencer—is wanted to spread
the news. But how prepare and dis-
seminate it? Mun is very clever: he
can talk from London to Paris; he can
fly; he can make telescopes and micro-
scopes; he can telegraph without wires;
but he has no means of telling titmice
that if they care to stroll his way they
will find cocoanuts and fat in his garden.
This is very absurd, and in a way
humiliating, is it not?
Yours faithfully, BENIGNUs.

An American gentleman visiting this
country is vastly amused at the un- |
scientific way in which we carry on our
elections. He declares we are babies in
the art. To mention but three points.
If you are a Conservative, and a Radical
canvasser calls on you, you should, it
seems, not dismiss him at once, but
detain him in argument as long as pos-
sible, so as to prevent his canvassing
other persons. Ultimately you should
tell him that you will vote for his man,
and so make him over-confident. And,
on the day of the election, you should
get the Radical agent to send a vehicle
to take you to the poll, keep it waiting a
good hour, and then vote Conservative

ROBERT SUPERMAN.
Wild chaos ruled it in the Strand,
Folly and frenzy hand-in-hand;
Now rowdy Radicals with jeers
Answered the Tories' raucous cheers;
Now hooligans from Stepney, E.,
Jostled young clerks from Battersea;
Now West-end toffs and bounders
bounded—
All was confusion worse confounded.
Amid this seething sea, serene
In all the hurly-burly scene,
Unmoved like some great rock I saw
A god-like guardian of the law.
Though history was in the making,
Though
quaking,
ſet “he was more than usual calm—
He did not give a single dam.”
There in the throng, alone, aloof,
I marked him, sphinx-like, passion-
proof;
No joy, no sorrow showed a trace
Upon that moveless marble face.
Tariff Reform, Free Trade, the fates
Of pettifogging Candidates,
For these he did not care a tittle;
It all was infinitely little.
To such as he what matter what
Amazing lies are nailed or not ?
What matter if we pygmies eat
Black bread of rye or white of wheat 2
Does the great lion heed the mole
That's crushed beneath his royal sole?
The forest oak-tree deign to mark
The ants that crawl upon its bark?
As when a sacrifice is brought
Before some carven Juggernaut,
The struggling victims shriek and cry,
With yells the howling mob reply—
Above the grim and gory scrimmage
Unmoved remains the graven image—
So, following the godhead's plan,
Unmoved was Robert Superman.
THE REASON.
I HAD always expected that when the
Semiramisof Streatham married Smithers
he would be made to drop poor Blithers.
This intelligent anticipation was not
founded upon the fact that Blithers was
an old bachelor friend, dating back,
indeed, to an epoch long before Theodora
Trotter had been even thought of by
Smithers, at all events. Such a record
might doubtless have prejudiced an
ordinary girl against him. But Theodora
stood upon another plane. What other
advanced young woman, when she found
that the wearing of green, white, and
violet in stripes caused her to be left
strap-hanging, would have thought of
wearing these colours separately on con-
secutive days? But she had the Cause
none the less at heart because she thus

And, when he thinks—good easy man—full surely
They're coming up quite nicely, nips his roots.
I have ventured
cozened barbaric man upon the Under-
ground into giving up his seat to her.
And Blithers was barbaric — not, of
course, in externals, but in ideas; and
with so intellectual a girl I felt sure that
ideas alone counted. His views upon
Theodora's pet subjects could only be
described as oriental, and he was brutally
frank about them. A great traveller
and a keen yachtsman, he was commonly
credited with being able to give any
professional sailor points in the number
of ports wherein he had moorings of a
more or less sentimental character. That
one of the first official acts of Mrs.
Smithers née Trotter would be to put
the name of Blithers upon the Indea:
was a foregone conclusion. I was
agreeably confirmed in my belief by his
conspicuous absence from her very first
dinner-party. But his name cropped up.
“You know him, of course?” I asked.
“He called, of course,” murmured
Theodora, “once.”
“Blithers' point of view,” I began
softly.
“Delightfully old-world, and all that,”
said Theodora; “I loved it.”
“And his principles,” I persisted.
“Beautifully naive,” she smiled;
& . but——”
“But 2 " I echoed.
“He started teaching Geoffrey topsail-
halyard bends and things—knots you
know—with a piece of picture-cord.”
“Sounds innocent enough,” Iventured.

“To enjoy garden work thoroughly, the gar-
dener must keep the proper posture. Do not
bend your back and work with all muscles

to keep the hands smooth and clean.

the House of Lords is to be overcome
there will need to be more Lib Earls than

“IT'S AN ILL WIND, ETG.;"
OR, THE OBITUARY ADVERTISEMENT.
Now that death duties threaten to
become almost prohibitive, it is clearly
the business of those who inherit pro-
perty to turn to profitable account every
opportunity offered to them by a family
be eavement. We have pleasure, there-
fore in providing our readers with a
few samples of obituary advertisement,
modelled, to the verge of plagiarism,
upon originals that are frequently to be
found in the provincial Press:–
THEODORE PUFE.
The death of Mr. Theodore Puff, which
occurred yesterday at his residence, Cran-
berry Lodge, Cherry Drive, removes from
our midst one of the old guard of the
pastry trade. Born in 1856, he was one of
the brightest examples of the old adage,
“'Tis stodgy as does it.” Educated at
Edgbaston Grammar School, he rapidly
showed remarkable leanings towards
pastry and a pretty taste in confectionery,
and when at the age of eighteen the
death of his father left him an orphan
he decided to seek his fortune without
parental assistance. The deceased used
often to tell how he arrived at Knockham
with nothing but a halfpenny bun in
his pocket. By a stroke of fortune,
which he regarded as fate, he disposed
of this appetising morsel for thre far-
things, and so laid the foundations of
the enormous business in Main Street,
which will in future be conducted by
his two sons, William and John. He
became early celebrated for his dough-
nuts, which are still justly admired, and
are sold for the reasonable price of two
a penny or five for twopence. Mr. P. ff
(père) always prided himself on the
purity of his confectionery, the standard
of which is maintained to this day. In
later years his sons, under deceased's
directions, opened a restaurant business
at the back of the shop, where the best
lunch in Knockham may be obtained at
such moderate prices as: fillet of sole,
4.d.; steak, Sd. ; cutlet and tomato
sauce, 6d. ; cold meats, 6d. ; cup of tea
or coffee with roll and butter, 4.d.; and
so on. His motto was “Tip-top tea
and no tips.” Smoking aſter 3 p.m.
Deceased leaves two sons and three
daughters, who survive him. The
funeral, which will leave Main Street at
3 p.m. to-day, will be furnished by Silk,
Brass & Co., No 14, The Ridgway.-
—The Knockham Star.
W. B. BANNER.
We regret to announce the death, on
the 14th instant, of William Bright
Banner, our esteemed townsman and
a member of Salem Chapel, Dewlap
Road. Deceased was in his 60th year,
having been born of humble parents
in a Northumberland mining village
and educated privately. When he was
scarcely in his teens his parents left the
North, taking him with them to Leicester,
where, in deference to their wishes, he
entered a boot factory. In the same
year that the Prince Consort died, the
late Mr. Banner, in conjunction with
Tobias Flog, opened a small boot re-
pairing establishment at the corner of
Meadow Lane. Deceased, by his untiring
energy and determination, which he
owed to his mother's influence when
still a child, raised the business step by
step until he was able to erect the es-
tablishment on Pigskin Hill which is
known to the locality as one of the
best for high-class foot-wear in Little
Mocester. The deceased gentleman, who
by the way took much interest in muni-
cipal affairs, having a running contract
for the repair of the boots of the Borough
Police, used often to recall that when he
started business, boots were 16s. 0d. per
pair, whereas he supplied a trustworthy
article in all sizes at 48. 11d., or in
patent leather 5s. 11d. His business,
which has passed into the hands of his
nephew, the deceased being a strict
bachelor, will be conducted as heretofore.
and for one week, to commemorate the
decease of his relative, his heir, Mr.
Montague Ephraim Banner, has deter-
mined to sell all goods at a reduction of
two-pince in the pound delivered free in
Little Mocester. The premises, we need
not remind our readers, are the first on
the left as you turn the corner out of
Hurdlegate. For further particulars see
advertisement on page 3. Deceased left
instructions in his will that the sum of
£50 should be expended on a tomb-
stone, the order for which has been
placed in the hands of Cockle, Lucas,
Limited, The Crescent.—Little Mocester
Guardian.
A correspondent writes to the Liver-
pool Daily Post:–
“Sir, There are two remarkable coincidences
in the figures of the Aberdeen (North) I)ivision.
The votes cast for the Liberal Candidate are
exactly the same as the combined votes of the
Conservative and Socialist . Further than this,
the Liberal majority over Socialist is exactly

Wait ! There is yet a third over-
powering coincidence ' ' The Liberal
majority over the Tory is exactly the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
My feeling about The Anger of Olivia (MILLS AND Boon) is
that under less discreet management than that of Mr. THOMAS
Cobb it would probably have developed into a much more
serious affair. Because undoubtedly Olivia had a grievance.
She had been brought up to consider herself the daughter
of a widowed mother whose husband had lost his life
heroically at sea. Whereas her real parent, Dick Banister,
had disappeared to America, without going through the
formality of marriage. So that when this Banister suddenly
turns up in London, very rich, and proclaims his intention
of righting everything on the better-late-than-never system,
well, one sees how upsetting it must have been for poor
Olivia. If she had lived in Wessex, for instance, almost
anything might have happened. As a matter of fact, nothing
does—which I take to be one secret of Mr. CoBB's popularity
as a novelist. Olivia herself, a thoroughly nice girl, is
admired placidly by F-
two well-bred swains;
Oblivious apparently of the unhappy predicament of his
brother Peers, Lord de Lys, who is the hero of Mr. H. B.
MARRIOTT WATSON's Romance at Random (HUTCHINSON), occu-
pied his time with a series of mild amatory adventures in
different parts of the country and varying ranks of society,
behaving always with that extreme chivalry which marks
the knight-errant of monthly magazines, even if he happens
to be a burglar. Not that Lord de Lys was that ; I would
trust him with a whole deer-forest if I had one, and if he stole
anything it was merely the hearts of a procession of heroines,
none of whom he met again, and none of whom I found
particularly stimulating. The method of this rather watery
Prince Florizel was to walk into strange houses and mix
himself up with other people's concerns, generally love-
affairs, and then, after having played Providence or made
the place too hot to hold him, to disappear suddenly without
leaving his card. Only once does an adventure border on
the serious, and though these stories are pleasant enough
reading they do not put any very exhausting strain on the
emotions. I think Lord de Lys ought to have been roped in
- - — by his fellow-back-
woodsmen to serve
one the insolvent but
quite nice heir to a
title, the other an
artist and even nicer.
Banister (who ap-
pears, somewhat un-
expectedly, to be
really as nice as any-
body), seeing that
an unmarried Olivia
must remain an ob-
stacle to his own
belated nuptials,
offers the first suitor

few chances to learn much about them. Miss SILBERRAD is alive-
to the humours of Netherford, but she has not insisted upon
them. Instead she has drawn a picture of the place which
I, at any rate, feel to be true. We get a real insight into
its little snobberies and cliques, so real indeed that were I
to be suddenly planked down in Netherford I know exactly
at which house I should hope to eat my early Sunday
dinner. Mr. Crickelby, John Cobham and Mrs. Toller are
typical Netherfordians, and (incidentally) my familiar friends.
The book is perhaps unduly prolix, but in compensation we
get to know these humdrum people and to realise that a most
ordinary man may have at least one incident in his life
which redeems him from commonplace. I regret that
a touch of melodrama should have been added to John
Cobham's love-story, for — to use a word of which Miss
SILBERRAD is too fond—it is somewhat incongruous.

According to The Exeter Express and Echo, Mr. LAN

from the window of the Liberal Club, spoke as follows:—
“We will take our defeat like ladies and gentlemen. What we
have got to do is to get ready for the next one (Loud cheers).”

THE ALTRUIST AT THE POLLS.
[ON the front-window of The Christian World the total results of
the elections have day by day been recorded, not under the natural
headings, “Liberals” and “Unionists,” but “For the People” and
“For the Peers” respectively. The Westminster Gazette pictorially
supports the same pleasant illusion with a slight variation—“Commons”
and “Lords.” If these categories mean anything, they mean that about
half the British People have voted for the Peers instead of for them-
selves—a very noble performance.]
Most Christian England . They who deemed you selfish,
Who in the shape of poster, print, or song
Implied that your ideals were low and pelfish,
Have done you grievous wrong. -
They pictured you as passing keen on spending
Your giant strength to strike the Tory dumb,
Moved by a single passion for distending
Your pocket and your tum.
They called on you to crush the vile encroacher,
To amputate the Peer's rapacious hand,
Laid like the paw of some insidious poacher
On your (the People's) land.
They trusted you would send to sheer perdition
These bloated Lords who longed to see you bled,
Who had designs, destructive of nutrition,
On your (the People's) bread;—
Monsters, whose bulging maws had ever fattened
On unearned increment of wine and oil;
Rodents whose teeth habitually battened
On your (the People's) toil.
And yet, with cheek presented to the smiters,
Taking a purely altruistic tone,
You beamed forgiveness on these belted blighters,
And made their cause your own |
Yes, in your myriads, drawn from every station—
Workers in towns and he that tills or delves—
You voted, like a really Christian nation,
For them and not yourselves'
I speak of England. Pawky Scots rejected
The claim of noble sentiments like these,
Choosing the primrose path where they expected
To pouch the most bawbees.
And “gallant little Wales” ignored the moral
Which in her bardic hymns you find rehearsed—
That noble knights should waive a private quarrel
And think of Others first.
(Erin's intentions I can scarce determine;
With Home Rule and the whiskey-still at stake,
IIer manner towards the gentlemen in ermine
Is markedly opaque.)
Yet when the totalised results are sorted
We find this creditable fact (loud cheers)
That roughly half our populace supported
Its natural foe, the Peers.
Nay, though the Lords abused their light authority,
Consulting wantonly the People's will,
You justified 'em by a clear majority
Against the Budget Bill.”
* The result of the Irish Elections must be regarded as unſavourable
to the Budget since the Natio...alists voted against its Second Reading.
So that, without prejudice to the future action of the Irish Party, we may
say that the United Kingdom, by a substantial majority, has justified
the Peers' reference to the People.
So, lest we hear the voice of aliens crying
That you have let your chivalry go to seed,
Spent with the one desire of gratifying
Your own peculiar need,
Within our glorious annals be it noted,
And laid for future reference on our shelves,
IIow large a portion of the People voted
For Others, not themselves. O.

• I ENCOUNTERED him in the train, some scores of feet below
the ground, and he interested me, for instead of regarding
the periodical outbursts of poster-scenery or endeavouring
to evade the stony stare of the people opposite he was
deep in the perusal of a little book. Not that there was
anything extraordinary in this fact ; but he read as though
his life depended on it. As we stepped off the car, faced
the wind, and huddled into the liſt, I noticed he had a
dreamy look. He trod on a lady's dress and met her glance
calmly, while I, who saw that glance only as an innocent
spectator, was compelled to shudder at its lightning. I stood
near him as the cage went up, and my curiosity perhaps
attracted him, for he liſted his eyes from the volume—
the page had been kept by his ſinger—and met my gaze. He
smiled; I smiled too, encouragingly; too encouragingly, alas!
“I never waste a single minute,” he remarked.
“It is well,” I said, “to occupy one's moments profitably.”
“Yes. To that end I carry with me literature in lengths,
if I may so term it, suitable for any emergency of the day.”
“May I enquire . . . . 2” I asked, as we tripped over the
step and fell into the street. -
“With pleasure. In this pocket I have five Peeps at
Parnassus-twopence a peep-each containing material for
a ten-minute journey. In ten minutes I can read one of
DickeNs' sonnets, one lyric of Johnson's, and one compressed
edition of BUTIER's Decline and Fall. For longer journeys
I have the Quick-Lunch Edition of Assorted Authors:
No. 1 comprises ‘Nibbles at NEWTON,’ ‘Snips from SHELLEY,”
and ‘Chips from CHESTERTON'—it can be read through in
twenty minutes; No. 2 contains a page from Pope's Essay
on Man——”
“Pardon me,” I interrupted maliciously, “you mean
THACKERAY, of course—THACKERAY's ‘Essay on Man.’’
“Of course—thank you. Also two of CARLYLE's short stories,
and HENRY JAMEs's “Ode to Melancholy’; this will take up
about half-an-hour. ‘Fritters of Fancy'—another helpful
idea—contains fifty three-minute touches, for use while I
wait for liſts, wait to cross Piccadilly Circus, wait for the
telephone, wait, in fact, for anything; it is so arranged that
each item can be absorbed at a glance. Just to show you
what can be done—yesterday was a busy time with me, and
yet I managed to get through the “Sonnet to a Grecian Urn'
(you know that glorious thing of MILTON s?); WoRDswoiti's
‘Tiger, Tiger, Burning Bright'; KEATS’s “La Belle Dame
Sans Merci’——”
“I have always thought VERLAINE’s “La Belle Dame' one
of the loveliest things I ever read,” I murmured.
“VERLAINE, of course—the title should have told me—t me

Three Men in a Boat, by EMERSON, and a chapter of Omar.
Not bad for a busy man, eh? There is absolutely no ex-
cuse for the shameful modern ignorance of the world s best
authors. In th’s way I regain the lost hours of youth, and
incidentally become a brilliant conversationalist; my friends
are astounded at the unerring manner in which I can fix a
quotation. Allow me to illustrate——” -
It w.s at this point that I wished farewell to this admirable
representative ... age we live in.

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE “CELTIC FRINGE’’-CUM-CORDUROY.
Design for an appropriate composite costume for the “Ministerial Boy” returning from the wars with his “wild harp slung" all over him.
A REIGN OF TERROR.
INTIMIDATION, from all accounts, has
been the salient feature of the recent
Elections in the provinces. Several
flagrant cases have been reported, notably
from Carnarvon Boroughs and High
Wycombe.
In Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's constituency
two Carnarvon ladies had the effrontery
to sport the Unionist colours, in-
tending thereby to overawe a crowd
of about two thousand adherents of
the opposite party, chiefly quarrymen
from Bethesda. These staunch Lloyd-
Georgites—what a lot of “staunch”
individuals there are at election
time ! — were driven to desperation
by such dastardly tactics (another use-
ful political phrase) on the part of a
supercilious pair of aristocratic hooli-
ganesses. The latter, not content with
parading the badge of domination in
public, carried their audacity to the
point of exhibiting the same to the down-
trodden descendants of the ancient
Britons from the threatening portals of
a Saxon post-office. To finish with, they
attempted to carve their way with feudal
arrogance, aided by an escort of their
minions, the police, through the huddled
masses of natives, who were now goaded
by panic and recklessness into protest-
ing against this last act of tyrannical
aggression and raising cries of “Kill the
devils' " We are glad to say that this
show of independence on the part of a
cowering concourse, now swollen to some
five thousand, had its effect in putting
an end to the reign of terror inaugurated
by the pair of female despots. Feeling
themselves now their match, the justly
exasperated inhabitants swept aside the
police-escort and nearly stripped the
clothes from the backs of their would-be
oppressors. -
Truly, with such a display of courage
and spirit, there is yet hope that free-
dom may be won.
At High Wycombe also, the audacious
promoters of a dump-shop went, for
once, too far in their campaign of in-
timidation. The collective Radical worm
began to turn at last and the emblem of
serfdom was overthrown, gutted, and
generally dispersed to the winds. The
populace arose in their might and chased
the pro-peeriff proprietor from their
midst.
England has discovered at the
eleventh hour how to deal with the auto-
crat, since a thousand sturdy patriots
can now summon up courage to deal
with one (or even two, if of the oppo-
site sex) who would enslave them by
sheer force of terrorisation.
These examples of intimidation should
suffice for those who have hitherto been
in doubt as to the exact political appli-
cation of that word. But if further illus-
trations are needed we may say that
(according to a speech of Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE, delivered a few days after the
Welsh episode described above) it was
intimidation “when great landowners
came from outside to canvass their
tenants” in these same Carnarvon
Boroughs. Again, it was intimidation,
in the view of a writer in The West-
minster Gazette, when “the farmers and
the landowners told the labourers that
if the Budget passed and Free Trade
continued there would be less work.”
On the other hand, it was not intimidation
when Radical Candidates told the
labourers that Tariff Reform would
mean dearer bread.
So now we know all about intimidation.

“HAs anybody here seen Kelly 2”
asked Dahlia, putting her head in at
the billiard-room door. “I mean Archie.”
“I’m waiting here for Kate,” I said.
“I mean Myra.”
“Oughtn't you to be dressing 2 It
doesn't matter about me—I’m not on
for a long time.”
“A rat-catcher's best suit is not an
elaborate one; I can put it on in about
five minutes. It is now 7.15; we begin
at 8.30—hence the billiard cue. More
chalk.”
“Oh, why aren't you nervous? How
you can stand calmly there—”
“I am nervous. Look.” I aimed
carefully and put the red into a pocket
some miles away. “There you are.
Have you ever seen me do that in real
life 2 Of course not. If my hand had
been steady I should have been a foot to
the right. Still more chalk.”
“Well, I want Archie, and I shall cry
if I don't find him. That's how I feel.”
She sat down and got up again.
“My dear Dahlia,” I said solemnly,
“now you can understand a father's
feelings–I mean, now you see what
you women have brought on your-
selves. Who suggested a play ? The
women. Who dragged me into it?
The women. Who said rat-catchers
always wore whiskers ? The women.
Who is designing me a pair of whiskers
at this moment? The wom — Simpson.
Who but for whom (this is going to be
a difficult sentence) would be just think-
ing of dressing leisurely for dinner,
instead of which we had a hasty snack
and have now got to put on Heaven
knows what? The women. Well, it
serves you right.” - -
“Don’t be horrid. I want Archie.”
She got up for the third time and driſted
out of the room. -
I chalked my cue and went into
a pocket without touching anything.
When I say I went in, I mean that the
ball I was playing with went in. You
do see that? Very well then. I took it
out and began to squint along my cue
again, when two hands came suddenly
over my eyes and a voice said, “Guess
who it is.”
“The Queen of Sheba,” I tried.
“Right,” said Myra.
I turned and looked at her.
“Golly, you do, you really do!” I said
at last. “Did they always dress like
that in the Bong era 2 Short skirts,
long pigtail, bare arms lovely.”
“‘I can sit in the sun and look just
twenty-one,’” sang Myra as she dropped
into a sofa.
“Well, just at present you're sitting
in the billiard-room and looking about
ſifteen . . . How are you getting on
with your French this term 2 I had a
very bad report in the holidays, from
your governess. The extra ninepence
a week seems to have been simply
thrown away.”
“Aren't you excited ?” said Myra,
looking at me with sparkling eyes.
“As for Callisthenics, well, what I say
is, ‘My daughter is Church of England,
and if you don't like it she can come
away. I'm not going to have her stuffed
up with all that nonsense.’”
Myra jumped up. “Aren't you ex-
cited 2 ” she insisted.
“Feel my tongue—I mean my pulse,
it's quite normal. And why? Because
I've forgotten my part and I’m going
to bed.”
“It’s a great
beginning the play.”
“It is. Have you ever thought that,
if we refused to begin, the play couldn't
continue, and then the audience would
be able to go home 2 My idea was to
tackle the people as they arrive, and
come to terms with them. I'm sure
there’s money in it.”
“You aren't bothering, are you?”
“Of course I am. I’d give a hundred
pounds to be out of it. No, I wouldn't
—I’d give a hundred pounds if you'd
always wear that frock, and do your
hair like that. Will you? And you
shall go on with your French, child.”
Myra curtsied prettily.
“And I'll go on with my whiskers.
You haven't seen me in those yet, have
you?” There was a loud noise without.
“Here they are, coming in.”
It was not the whiskers, however, but
Archie and Thomas in full costume:
Archie in green, and Thomas in black.
“Hallo,” said Archie, “I feel just like
a conjurer.”
“You look just like a grasshopper,”
said Thomas. -
“My dear friend,” said Archie, patting
him kindly on the shoulder, “is that
you? But you oughtn't to be here, you
know. You came up the hot-water pipe,
I suppose? Yes, yes, but they mis-
directed you—the blackbeetle depart-
ment is in the basement. Well, well, it
will be easier going down.”
“Archie, Dahlia's looking for you.”
“It's all right, she found me. She
was nearly in tears. She said, ‘Is that
my Archibald or an onion ?' I said
‘Fear not, fair one, ’tis but the early
crocus.’ Myra, don't you think they've
overdone the green rather ? To be
quite frank I don't see why a conjurer
should be dressed in green at all.”
“To distinguish him from the rat-
catcher in brown, the executioner in
black, and the Master of the Gold Fish
in red.”
“I had thought that perhaps a certain
aptitude for legerdemain might so dis-
responsibility our
tinguish him. But I perceive that I am
wrong. Hallo, why aren't you in brown,
then P’’ - -
“I’m going on like this,” I explained.
“I was going to have changed, but now
I’ve seen you two I don't think I will.
With my ordinary clothes, one whisker
—probably the starboard one — and a
little insouciance, I shall be a great
success.” :
“What annoys me,” said Thomas,
“is that in the early Bong age they had
no bally pockets. I've simply got no-
where to keep a handkerchief.”
“Keep it behind the scenes; and
then if you blow your nose immediately
before the execution, and again imme-
diately after it, you ought to be all right.”
“It isn't for that ; it's in case I want
to cry.”
“It’s all right for me,” said Archie.
“I’ve simply got to say, ‘Now can any-
body in the audience oblige me with a
handkerchief?’ and I shall get dozens.”
“Then I shall probably touch you
for one. Great Irvings, is this really
Simpson?”
The Emperor Bong was making a
splendid entry, looking (except for his
spectacles) exactly like an emperor.
“Itise, rise,” he said. “Stop grovelling.
Oh, look here, you fellows, when I say
‘On the stomach ' ' then you must
Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Mannering,
I didn't see you were there.”
“Where are my whiskers?” I asked
sternly. -
“My dear old chap, I couldn't do
them; there wasn't enough to go round.
I made two nice little eyebrows instead—
you'll find them on your dressing-table.
‘Oh, I am the Emperor Bong, I am beauti-
ful, clever and strong. I am beauti »
Do you think I ought to wear my spec-
tacles or not?”
There was a loud shout of “No 1 ''
“Oh, all right. But I shall probably
fall over the sunset or something.
Thomas, if you see me wandering into
a new moon, tap me on the head with
your axe. Why isn't my rat-catcher
dressed ?”
“He was waiting for his whiskers.”
“That's perfectly absurd. You could
have grown a pair in the time. Go and
dress at once.”
“I refuse to do anything till quarter-
past eight,” I said. “If I get into my
things now all the atmosphere will have
worn off by the time we begin.”
“It's worn off me a long time ago,”
said Thomas dismally. -
“And me,” said Myra, with a shiver.
“Well, we're all very miserable,” said
Archie; “let’s have a bottle of some-
thing. What? Oh, hush | Simpson, just
ring the bell, and I'll show you a little
conjuring trick. There's nothing on the
table at present, is there? No. Well
now, you watch.” A. A. M.

HOW TO BE HAPPY THOUGH BEATEN.
[A foretaste of the Cheery Optimism which
we may expect to see in the Radical Halfpenny
Press at the Next Election 'J
THE Beef Taxers are beaten and they
know it. The Unionist Party is dead
and buried and will never be resurrected.
Yesterday ninety-eight seats were con-
tested. Of these it is true the Black-
Breaders won twenty-four, and the Anti-
Peerites only won two, but one has only
to glance at the names of the con-
stituencies which have changed their
political faith to appreciate the true
significance of the stupendous Liberal
victory with which the country is ringing
to-day. Here they are:–
PARTY GAINs.
Beef Tazers. Anti-Peerites.

Liverpool. 2 -
Swansea . 1 Total . . 2
Bristol . . 2
Edinburgh .. 3

Sheffield . . 2

It will be seen, as Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
remarked contemptuously in his magni-
ficent speech last night, that the gains
of the Beef Taxers are mainly in the
industrial towns of the provinces. Let
them make as much of these so-called
gains as they like. HAMMERSMITH
(large caps, please !), where the great
heart of London again beats true to
Liberalism, is ours Hammersmith has
sealed the fate of the Beerites for ever.
Rochester, our other gain, is magnificent!
By the superb majority of ninety-
eight (only two less than a hundred')
this typical centre of cathedral culture
in the Home Counties has sent the Pro-
Peers packing!
To show how hopeless is the case of
the Beef Taxers, we have only to look
at the

PROMETHEA.
BEFORE the February day
Yellows the window-pane once more,
I hear her on her slipshod way
Clatter outside my bedroom door,
Unshrined and all unknown to fame—
To me a goddess just the same !
Hers was no columned Grecian grove,
Hers no be-fermed Sicilian fount;
No shepherd of the white-fleeced drove
Adjudged her fair on Ida's mount,
Nor did she in the dusk unbar,
The dawn gate for the sun-god's car!
Yet, ere the laggard milkman cries,
Ill-nurtured nymph of household care
She comes, poor child, with heavy eyes
Adown the creaky lodging stair,
To struggle with the Stygian gloom
Of fog that fills the dining-room
Coarse-fingered, grimy as to face
From scuttle, pan, or window-sill—
Well, was the very rosiest Grace
So fit to merit man's good-will
As she, who comes in low estate,
Poor little drudge, to lay the grate?
And when the glow of kindly flame
Leaps 'neath her touch to warm and
cheer
The cockles of the human frame,
Its little handmaid doth appear,
For sheer humanitarian worth,
His equal, who brought Fire to Earth !

A GREAT public demonstration was .
held last Saturday in Belle Vue Gardens, F.
Manchester, to record the indignant ||
protest of Lancashire against the publi- tº
cation in The Spectator of an article
signed oëris, contending that London |
was always right in politics.
Mr. Bellairy Hilloc, M.P., who took
the chair, was greeted with enthusiastic
cheers, showers of French beans and other
appropriate floral tributes. When order
had been restored, Mr. Hilloc said that in
his long and arduous career he had
often been stirred to righteous indigna-
tion, but never had his blood broiled
with a fiercer fury than on the present
occasion. Speaking as a rate-payer
(Cheers), a tax-payer (Loud cheers), a
patriot (Cries of “Chers for LLOYD
GEORGE | ") and a father of a family |
(Immense enthusiasm, and cries of “A bas
BALFour !” “Conspuez Kensington") he
did not hesitate to say that this insult to
Lancashire wounded him to the quick.
For London—the home of the idle and
rotten rich—to insinuate that she led
Lancashire was a monstrous perversion
of fact. The direct contrary could be
proved in a thous nd ways. If the
Thames was “liquid history,” the Irwell
was “clotted wisdom.” Did not the
proverb run : “What Lancashire thinks
to-day, England thinks to-morrow"?
Was it not the case that what Orkney
and Shetland, said to-day, Lancashire
said the week before last? Had not
Lancashire elected him (Mr. Hilloc) one
of its Members? (A voice: “Rub it in!”
and confused howls from the gallery).
Had not London borrowed the names |
of Piccadilly and Oxford Street from
Manchester 2
Mr. Hiſloc concluded a brilliant speech
by declaring that he never went to
bed without drinking two pints of
Lancashire botanic beer.
Dr. HANs Rio TER, who spoke with a
strong Lancashire accent, said that he
associated himself with what had fallen
from the lips of the previous speaker.
Manchester was the Me ca of British
musicians, and the Hallé Concerts, which
he had the honour to conduct (A voice:
“ Cheers for LLoyd GEORGE | "), were the
best human approximation to the music
of the spheres (Cheers for Hallé's Comet).
The scenery of the Manchester Ship
Canal was superb and fully equal to that
of the beautiful blue Danube. (Dissent.)
Miss HoRNIMAN added a few eloquent
words on the interest shown by the
people of Lancashire in the drama. In
Manchester the theatre was a democratic
institution, whereas London showed its
enslavement to obsolete feudal prejudices
by naming one of its new theatres “The
Coronet” (“Down with the Peers!”).

Second Politician. “I DAREs Ay They would, Miss, but TheN, you see, we ARE LED Away IN The Right DIRECTion l’”
in a polished address called attention to
the euphony of Lancashire nomenclature.
London and its environs could boast no
such names as Chowbent or Bootle,
where the historic Baby came from.
Even the streets in Manchester had
Christian names, e.g. John Dalton Street.
If he were not a Mancunian he would
infinitely rather be a Liverpudlian than
a Cockney. In conclusion he said that
though they were all for cotton he hoped
they would never be worsted (Cries of
“Help!” and “Chestnut”).
Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT, the famous
novelist, said that, speaking as a work-
ing-man with some knowledge of DANTE,
he repudiated the contention of O3, is,
with all the Goliardic bravura at his
command. Mr. HEWLETT then quoted
a long passage from GUICCIARDINI in
the original Italian, punctuated by con-
tinuous cries of “Rub it in l’’ and ended
a brilliant peroration by denouncing
Lord LANSDowNE as a desiccated guasta-
mestiere.
A resolution to the effect “that Lom-
don's claim to be superior in political
intelligence to Lancashire is a gigantic
and impudent imposture" was then
carried by acclamation, and after the
Chairman had sung, “Partant pour la
Syrie,” to the accompaniment of the
Besses o' th' Barn Temperance Reed
Band, the huge audience dispersed in a
state of comatose complacency.
“Mr. McKean said he did not wish to add
to the bitterances of the contest, and he would
be glad if any words of his which would tend to
bitterness would be forgotten.”--Dublin Eren-
ing Herald.
But he must not try to improve on that
delightſul word “bitterance.”
Spare the Rod.
“There is too much sugary sentimentality
in our dealings with our children. There is an
overwhelming desire to shield them from the
present woe at the expense of the future weal.”

“The doxology and further refreshments

Observcr.
We can quite imagine that the spiritual
refreshment had to be supplemented.
“The large comet was seen by a resident in
the heavens in the direction of the Forest.”—
The Football Echo and Sports Gazette.
“The resident in the heavens” may
well have been Venus; and, if so, we
think Mars ought to be told about it.
The Observer states that among the
dances which Lady CONSTANCE STEwART-
RICHARDSON gave was, “Grieg's ‘Ass's

piece to the tune the old cow died of.

THE REMONSTRATOR.
III.--THE SUB-EDITOR.
“You are the sub-editor, aren't you?”
I asked.
“Yes,” he said.
“May I have a few minutes' conversa-
tion with you?”
“Certainly, if it's important.”
“It's about the paper,” I said.
“Oh, all right then,” he replied, “fire
away.”
“This article,” I said, unfolding yester-
day's issue. “‘Astounding Revelations.'
I suppose you had a hand in that?”
“Only to cut it down and insert cross-
headings,” he answered, “and to give it
its title, of course.”
“That's just it,” I said. “I guessed
it was you. Did you read it?”
“Read it? My dear Sir, I have just
told you I cut it down.”
“Then you were astounded ?”
“Well... I don't know exactly that
I was a stounded.”
“But you must have been. Here's
the title—added, of course, after you had
finished the cutting down –“Astounding
Revelations.' A man doesn't deliberately
say that unless he has been astounded,
does he ”''
“Put it that I was surprised.”
“Oh, no-'astounded.' You said so.
So amazed—to be literal—that you were
struck dumb as by a peal of thunder.”
He laughed.
“Then it's not true?” I said.
“No, of course not. It's journalism.”
“And journalism isn't true?”
“Well, not minutely and meticulously
true in every point. How could it be?
There isn't time.”
“But why ‘astounding,’ anyway?
Why not ‘surprising’ or “unexpected'?”
“So tame. Besides, where should
we be beside the other papers? You
evidently don't know much about even-
ing papers. There are certain words
which every sub-editor must use if he is
to satisfy his employers. “Astounding'
is one of them. We have to be careful,
of course, not to overdo it, but “astound-
ing' once in every ten days makes a
great difference to the sales.
“Then there’s “sensational.’ You
have seen that, of course? “Sensa-
tional' is almost as good as “astound-
ing,' but not quite. “Scene' is a seller,
too: “Scene in Court,' ‘Scene at a
Theatre,’ “Scene in the Strand.’ You
can't go wrong with that. After we
have used “Scene' often enough we say
“Disturbance'; but “Scene’’s much
better.
“‘West-End' also is valuable. “Scene
in a Church,' for example, would not
catch the reader half so surely as “Scene
in a West-End Church.” The other day
there was a row in a wretched little
club in the Italian Quarter in Soho;
but do you suppose I hesitated to call it
‘Raid on a West-End Club 2 Certainly
not. “Raid on a Club' means nothing.
“Then ‘shocking." In a way every-
thing at all violent is shocking, but we
keep the word for accidents and murders,
alternating it with “terrible' and ‘hor-
lible.' No murder is anything but
horrible, of course, yet we find that to
continue to say ‘horrible murder' is
profitable. “Brutal murder' pays well
too. ‘Disgraceful' also is a good friend
to us; the public lay down their coppers'
for it nobly—even more readily than for
‘thrilling.’” -
He ceased.
“Thank you,” I said, having caught
the inſection, “for your astounding
revelations. I quite understand now."

[“I do not wish to make it (the Navy) a Party thing, but one has to

Give it a rest, my CHARLES: it hasn't paid.
The meetings that declare you good and old,
Hearing the clamour of your whirling words,
And all the pretty touches of your style;
The innuendoes and the strange abuse
Of those who see not eye to eye with CHARLES;
The panic-moving phrases, and the froth
Stirred by the windy methods of your speech—
These meetings cheer, but, oh, they disbelieve.
“Somehow to Parliament!” Is that your cry?
Quocumque modo rem—you know the tag—
Si possis lecte, and the rest of it.
But where's the recte of your latest mood?
You doubt the Navy and the Navy's Lords,
Not being one of them—ay, there's the rub—
And so to gain your petty private end,
“Navy l’’ you cry, “It’s going to the dogs.
Few ships we have, and those not fit to float;
Few guns, and those not fit to fire a shot;
And men too few to man our ſailing ships;
And fools (or traitors) at the head of all,
Foo's since they will not all agree with me,
And traitors since they scout my plain advice.”
And so the Navy's made a Party thing,
And Charlie B. is sent to Parliament.
Well, there's a level there for all to find,
For CHARLEs and others, and the words that shake
The platform leave the benches undisturbed.
And PERCY Scott perchance might give a hint
Of CHARLEs, the breezy sea-dog, and his ways.
Therefore, while yet the Fates allow, perpend ;
Since BERESFORD too is mortal he may make
Mortal mistakes like any other man.
Give it a rest, my Charles : it hasn't paid.

II.
I’AD a couple o' Suffrajits in my keb
the other day. They 'ails me near the
Benk, an’ says, “Drive 'ard to Traffalgy
Square.” An' the 'ole way they was
cryin’ “Votes for Wimming,” an’
jumping about like a couple o' per-
formin' fleas. Which reminds me. 'Ave
you seen them performin' fleas they're
showin' in the Edgweer Road 2 They’re
well worf seein'. There's one on 'em
does sech tricks as 'd make 'is fortune,
I should say, on the Music 'All stage.
Might call 'im “Little Itch.”
wife, an' they started discussin' what
the fare'd be. 'E says, “Heighteen-
pence,” an’ she says, “No, certingly not
more than a shillin',” at which they was
almost startled out o' their lives by
suddingly 'earin' a loud voice from the
top shout, “Ye're both wrong; it's a
couple o' bob ” Ha-ha! They didn't
know the trep-door was jess open.
Same bloke was a-drivin' a gent with a
habnormally large nose one day, an' it
comes on to rain. “Let down the
glawss,” says the fare. “All right, Sir,”
savs my friend; “lean back, Sir,” for 'e
sees 'is nose a-stickin' out. “I am
leanin' back as far as I can,” hanswers
the fare. Ha-hal
right enough. 'E 'ad carroty 'air—an'
a turnip nose. The deesign of that
nose is goin' to be haltered.
No, my opinion o' people is they're
deteriatin’ all round. For one thing
you don't meet with the same respec'
as you used to. They fink nothin' of
insultin' a 'orse kebby now. T'other
night I says to some gents as was
walkin' along, “Keb 2.” an' one o' them
hanswers, “No thenks, we're in a 'urry.”
That was Yewmour, I suppose. Then a
lidy asks me if I cou'd tell 'er where
she could find a taxi-keb. There's
exquizzit delicacy for you ! I needn't
tell you where I told 'er to go for 'er
taxi-keb. Then there was two genter-
men as 'ailed me in the Stran’.
Well, I was goin' to tell you
about these Suffrajits. When
they gets to Traffalgy Square—
all the way from the Benk to
Traffalgy Square—they gets out,
an' gires me a shillin', an' cries,
“Votes for Wimming!” “Votes
for Wimming 2" I says; “Oats
for 'Orses, that's what I want.
'Ere 'ave you been usin' my keb
as a featre, an’ then you offers
me a shillin' for its 'ire " '' But
there, what's the good of argu-
fyin' with that sort 2 I chucks
the shillin' after 'em, an' drives
hoff amid the cheers of the popu-
lice . . . My opinion of 'em is
they're mad. They're tryin' to
prove that they ought to 'ave
the vote by showin they ain't
wurvy of it.
Votes for Wimming, indeed!
My old 'ooman started gettin'
uppish one night—I 'spec’ some
of them Suffrajits 'ad been talkin'
to 'er—but I don't stand none of
'er truck. I puts my foot down

Furriners I took 'em for—Parly-
voos, or Yah-yahs. There ain't
nuffink but furriners in Town
nowadays; it makes you fair
start to 'ear a word of Henglish.
“Gabnan,” they says, “vill you
please drife us to ze Al'ambra.”
So they jumps in, an' I thinks,
“I’ve got a bit of all right 'ere.”
An' when they gets out they says,
“Gabrman, 'ow mooch, please—
vot is your fare?” “’Alf-a-
Sovring,” I says. “Right,” they
says, “there's a shillin' towards
it, you lyin' ole scoundrel!”
This in Hinglish, so that I
almos' fell off my box! You see,
they was only purtendin’ to be
furriners. More Yewmour, I
suppose. . . You bet I give my
'orse a whippin' for that
THE TESTING OF THE
TARMAC.
THE Tarmac pond—it is short

been the outcome of the curler's
repeated disappointments. After

when I was a young man we'ad the Wim-
mings' 18ights meetin's. An' I recollec'
a werry good tale they used to tell about
'em. There was a Wimmings' Rights
meetin' at the St. James's 'All, an' the
lidy speaker she says, “After all, we've
often 'eard of a Perfec' Woman, but oo's
ev, r 'eard of a Perfec' Man 2" At that
up jumps a miserable little second-and-
lookin' feller in the body of the 'all, an’
'e says, “Hif you please, I've 'eard of a
Perſec'. Man—'ear of 'im every day in
my life.” “Ho!’ says the lidy speaker,
“an' pray oo's 'e?” “Why, my wife's
first 'usbang,” hanswers the little man.
Ha-ha! That's my idea of a good story.
Which reminds me—a bloke as I knows

Let's see, what was I a-talkin' about?

seemed to have never the ice and the
cup and the players all together, he set
about him to discover the best means
of economising the frost, so that the
game might be played with the least
possible support from the forces of
nature. The Tarmac is sprayed with
the merest skin of water, and if it is
freezing at all the ice is made in half an
hour and the game can at once begin.
It will readily be understood that the
main requirement of a Tarmac pond is
that it should be level. Fer it is not
the water level that one plays on but the
level of the surface itself.
I suppose I made a mistake in em-
ploying a local man. One generally
does. Anyhow the pond was finished,
the bill was sent in, and the contractor
paid me a last visit to inspect his

*
handiwork before the transaction was
concluded.
There had been a heavy shower of
rain during the night, and it seemed to
me a relevant question to put to him—
why, if the Tarmac was dead level, was
it covered with puddles? Was it not
an established fact that water ran to the
lowest point?
“Weel,” said McHogg at once, “that
is a very interesting obsairvation. The
| truth is that the leveller a pond is the
mair puddles there are. If there was a
slack place anywhere there would just
be the one puddle.” He seemed to have
me there. But I insisted that each
separate puddle represented a depression.
“I do not believe that the water in
any of them will cover a penny,” said
he. He was a little disconcerted when
on this being tested a column of no
fewer than three pennies was com-
pletely submerged.
“Aweel,” he said, “it’s everyway
likely that that'll level oot of itself,
owing to the contraction.” I have not
yet the faintest idea what he meant by
that. Then he shifted his ground.
“Thae Tarmacs,” he remarked, “are . .
a grand thing for the game o' curlin'.
Ye may say they have introjooced new
and scientific elements. It's just the
fact of theyre no being quite level that
adds a zest.”
“But you said this one was dead level.”
“Hoots, ay. In a sense, that is. But
I was speaking to an auld curler in the
train this morning. He tells me they
have grand sport on the Tarmac at
Crashie Howe. It's that onlevel that it
requires a special skill. They are fair
delighted with it.”
“But you undertook——”
“Ye see the game's getting too simple
for thae guid players. Ony fule can play
straight on a true board. But on the
Tarmac they have the advantage of a' thae
wee ups and doons. There's no mistake
it adds an interest. Some o' them are no
so very carin'aboot the deep water noo.
They find it kind o' monotonous.”
I cut the excellent McHogg short by
pointing out that what I wanted was a
level Tarmac, and that he must fulfil his
contract by making good all the de-
pressions before his bill would be paid.
He turned to me almost in horror.
“Man,” he said, “ye canna' patch
her the noo.”
“Why not?” said I.
“Ye'll spoil the business entirely.
We'll never get a fair surface if we
begin to tamper wi' her. She's settled
noo into her final form.” -
“But did you not tell me that the
hollows would level out owing to con-
traction ?”
“Oo ay, in a sense. I dinna say just
her final form. But we daurna patch
her. That's fatal.”

“But I tell you she's not level.”
“Weel, they're awfu' queer things,
levels. They're not to be depended on.
But,” with growing enthusiasm, “ye'll
get grand ice on here. The pond 's fine:
there's nothing ails her. Div 'e think
Sandy'll win the cup the 'ear?”
I admit that McHogg here succeeded
in involving me in a lengthy discussion
of curling prospects, but I brought him
back at last and finally appealed to the
evidence of the spirit-level which pro-
jected from his waistcoat pocket. This
he was quite willing, even anxious, to
apply. He supported it on a plank
six or eight feet long, and it did
not occur to me till aſterwards that
by this means he was bridging over
the smaller depressions. According
to this test there was no fault to be
found, and McHogg further strength-
ened his case by a final statement that
it was the oil on the surface that
gathered the water. It had nothing to
do with the levels. “In a manner o'
speaking,” he concluded, “the water is
no lying doon below the surface. It's
standin' up above, by capeellary attrac-
tion. In a sense.”
On further testing I found that one
could only draw to the tee by taking
a line a yard outside the seven-ſoot
circle. But meanwhile McHogg had got
his cheque.

Too wildly flowers, unless we trim it;
All happiness may turn to pain
And prove “the limit.”
And music rare, whose rising swell
Enchants the soul, may soar, my

Till someone has to go and tell
The brutes to stop it.
Such is the case, I trow, with you;
Those lees of elegiac ferment,
That ripe luxuriance is due
For disinterment.
Not once nor twice my so-called friends
Have chaffed the swan-song in your

(Poor smokers of inferior blends,
Their pipes are scrannel).
Little I care for what they say;
But I myself have found your wheezes
A thought too rich, too rare to-day—
Like German cheeses.
So with the fond regret of one
Who finds the blesséd daylight struck

Because his heart's adored, his Sun,
Has been and chucked him,
And, though his life henceſorth must be
Hollow and tasteless, tries to scrimmage
Out of the gates of memory
Her glorious image,

THE BORN ORATOR.
A MAN with Burke-Brown's gift of
eloquence was not likely to circumscribe
its value by attaching himself to any
one political party. Unhampered by
convictions, he was ever prepared to put
his unequalled talents at the service of
either side. I never knew an orator
who could carry away his audience so
easily or to such a distance from the
facts. It was not what he said, it was
the way he had of saying it. He not
only revelled in the sound of his own
voice, but was the cause of revelling in
others. In constant request on rival
platforms, he threw off at least twice as
much oratory as any partisan during
the Elections. Towards the close of the
conflict his impartiality began to tell
upon him ; yet the influence of his
persua-ive manner upon the emotions
of his hearers lost nothing of its mag-
netic quality. His final speech was
perhaps his greatest triumph. My notes
of it run as follows:—
“Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentle-
men, it is now eight o'clock (Cheers) on
the twenty-sixth of January, nineteen
hundred and ten. (Applause.) Gentle-
men, this is an hour of deepest import-
ance to the welfare of our land. The
House of Lords, because they trust the
People, have asked the People to decide
whether a revolutionary budget shall
become law. (Lowl cheers.) Gentle-
men, are we going to submit to that?
(‘No!') The greatest Government of
modern times have asked the rich of the
land to contribute their fair share of
taxation. This great Government—in
which any man might be proud to serve
—has declined to put a penny piece upon
your food. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I ask
you again, are you going to submit
tamely to that? (Loud protests in the
negative.)
“Are we sunk so low that we are
going to submit to do the bidding either
|of Mr. Lloyd GEORGE (Laughter) or of
Mr. BALFour 2 (Renewed laughter.) Do
we propose to use our intelligence?
(Dissent.) Is the working man going
to stay idly by while the price of his
bread is reduced from sixpence to a
miserable fourpence three farthings 2
(Cries of “No 1") Am I, are any of us in
this room, going to admit to these pretty
purple peers (Loud laughter) or these
little Welsh attorneys (More laughter),
I say, are we going tamely to admit to
these men that we will willingly bear
the burden of a knowledge of what we
are talking about? (Cries of ‘Not we '')
+ + + + +
“Gentlemen, I will close, for the hour
is getting late. (A voice," Go on, cocky 1')
But I cannot leave you without saying
that I do not doubt that, when the day
of the election comes, you will go to the
poll and by your vote show your opinion
of this jerrymandering Administration
and of the miserable and paltry oligarchy
enthroned in the House of Lords! (Lowd
and prolonged cheers!)
When is a train like a steamer? This
knotty riddle has at last been solved
by an Edinburgh correspondent of The
Daily Mail, who writes:—
“I had a splendid view of Drake's Comet
this evening. The head of the comet was
bright, and the train, nearly three degrees in
length, was broad, and like a steamer.”

[We have the authority of a weekly paper

The lady wove a pleasant spell
Around my callow heart;
On being introduced, I fell
A prey to Cupid's dart;
But, ere the conquest proved complete,
My resolution swerved—
What if she only seemed so sweet
Through being well preserved 2
Time's footprints are not always clear
Unless the light be strong,
So, tortured by a panic fear
That I was choosing wrong,
I would not make my passion plain,
But hovered round the spot
In search of means to ascertain
If she were young, or not.
I saw her greet a friend, and lo
I shuddered at the sight;
She actually kissed as though
She would not rather bite.
Forthwith her fascination palled;
My love was overcast; -
I knew that she was what is called

SCIENTIFIC HISTORY.
(The Up-to-date Historian Speaks.)
Did any man of old desire
To strum a tune on Clio’s lyre,
Full easy was his task because
He simply strummed, and there he was.
No need for him with toilful pain
To cultivate a special brain,
No need to study in the schools
The latest scientific rules,
Nor did he make the least pretence
To learn the laws of evidence.
HERODOTUS, for instance, glories
In idle tales and fairy stories;
Whatever yarns of headless men
He clianced to hear, he seized his pen
And wrote them down upon his tables,
No matter whence he learnt the fables.
There's scarce a word of his that I
Could not pronounce a monstrous lie—
In short, a child could show the man
Was either fool or charlatan.
THUCYDIDEs was little better:
He was Imagination's debtor;
He had no motion in his pate
Of what is meant by “accurate.”
His own unaided fingers wrote
The speeches which he loved to quote,
How NIKIAS spoke, how KLEoNanswered—
He had no Times nor files of Hansard.
GIBBON, again, but little knew
What history is meant to do:
Instead of scientific facts,
State records, legislative acts,
He gives a pageant highly tinted
By spectacles through which he squinted.
CARLYLE, MACAULAY—if one tries,
To talk about their brazen lies,
One's words and patience quickly fail—
They both are quite beyond the pale.
How different am I. How thorough
The care with which I delve and burrow
To trace a fact. They were content
Simply to read a document;
They did not know the keen, ecstatic
Joy of the art of diplomatic.
My parchments carefully I pass
Beneath a magnifying-glass,
And every inch I scan to spot
What parts are genuine, what not.
When all the good has been selected
And all the spurious rejected,
I test again and then prepare
To weigh the evidence with care.
The various readings I collate,
The pros and cons at length I state,
And for each line of text I quote
A page or two of priceless note,
Wherein, meticulously traced,
You read on what my facts are based.
And yet this curious thing I find :
Despite my scientific mind,
Despite my vast superiority
In dealing with an old authority,
GIBBON and Co. are studied still
While my admirers number nil.

Possibly, if Mr. J. E. BUCKRose had written A Golden
Straw (Mills AND Boon) as his first novel I should have appre-
ciated it more. At least I should not then have been forced
to compare it, not quite favourably, with other previous work
of his. Here is the same easy charm of description; but
the tale itself strikes me as a machine-made thing, and the
characters are unconvincing. For example, Averild, the
heroine, wishing to go to Germany to study music, exclaims,
“I’ll come back, but I must wander first. It's the Holder-
ness blood. We're made so. They were wanderers who
first landed here—whom we've all sprung from,” etc., etc.
Now it is one of my most cherished convictions that nobody
ever talks like this in real life. And I charge Mr. BUCKROSE
with knowing it.

With regard to the story, of course Averild
has succeeded in adding a useful and attractive book to
contemporary history.
I received a great shock about two-thirds of the way
through Mrs. HUGH FRASER's Giannella (METHUEN). It is the
story of an orphan girl (the daughter of a Scandinavian
painter) who owes her upbringing, when stranded in Rome,
to the kindness of a peasant woman ; and, after emerging,
so to speak, from the rather arid campagna of the heroine's
early years, I had just got to the pleasant piazza of her
love-affair (and a very pretty affair it is, with pigeons that
carry messages, and balconies of flowers, and a lay figure
of a cardinal used for painting portraits for foreigners),
—I had just got to this point, I say, when suddenly the
eyes of Masiuccia (Giannella's benefactress) snapped. I felt
as if something had suddenly gone too. This terrible form
of ophthalmia is creeping gradually over all our English
fiction, and the circulating libraries ought to do something
about it. For the rest,

had been secretly married
abroad to the unpleasing
Winship, and had repented
it ever since. Eventually
her husband follows her
home, and is drowned in a
convenient flood, thus ful-
filling a dream about
“dark water" which had
been hanging about sus-
piciously since the begin-
ning of the story. In
this way Averild is left

From time to time through recent sessions I have read in

that the record shall be free from political party bias. The
Editorial Column may in most cases be trusted to supply
full measure of such spice. Mr. KiNg is void of offence
in this matter. Dr. Johnson, the best known, if not quite
the earliest, Parliamentary reporter, candidly admitted that
in preparing his narrative of a day's sitting in the House of
Commons he took care that the Whigs did not have the
best of it. (He inserted an adjective permissible only in a
lexicographer.) Mr. KING writes with equal frankness and
fairness of all sections of parties in the last Parliament. His
thumb-mail sketches of the Labour Members, most of them
new-comers to the vineyard at Westminster, are particularly
interesting. With a shrewd sense of character, a keen
eye for colour, and a sharp ear for a good thing, Mr. KING

My HERBERT, I have marked with much emotion .
How round your precious head blows every wind,
Like AEolus, his pack, let loose on Ocean–
The Lib, the Lab, the Soc, the Nat, the Ind;
Enough to make your hair .
Go by the roots and leave the summit bare.
While you're away, supposed to be enjoying
A little azure sea for private ends, .
I can conceive of nothing more annoying
Than to be lectured by such lots of friends,
All giving loud advice
In all directions; no, it can't be nice.

Patro's his villa (ah, these splendid Peers!),
Prepared, behind a military cordon,
To slit the office-seeker's nose or ears;
Nevertheless I doubt
If all his care can keep the papers out.
Your Liberal prints (myself, I never read 'em,
But each, I'm told, intends to be your guide)
Must play Old Harry with your judgment's freedom

Well, if you lack for honest sympathisers
To give your harried heart a little ease;
If, in the multitude of your advisers,
There 's none that whispers, “Go what way you

Strange though it seem to be
I can assure you, you may count on me.
I have no wish, not I, to speed your exit;
Don't think I envy you your pride of place;
I'm in no sort of hurry to annex it,
Needing a year or so for breathing-space;
So I shall use no guile
Not for the present, not just yet awhile.
Time is required for you to make fresh errors,
And me to test my newly-mustered ranks,
To preach the food-tax and disperse the terrors
Due to that gospel down in Yorks and Lancs;
I own—and I’m no dunce—
I failed to grasp its beauty all at once.
So for a bit I'll bide my hour in statu.
Meanwhile, if any section, one or more,
Of your assorted crew gets up and at you,
I'll come and save your skin across the floor;
Trust me, I will not stand
And see you perish—till it suits my hand. O. S.

THE RUBBER EPIDEMIC.
I AM, he said, a very miserable man. My life has become
a burden to me. I dread the dawn of every day. I never
open a paper without wincing; I never see a postman with-
out shuddering. How long it will continue I cannot think;
but let me tell you. - -
Three months ago I did a foolish thing. It was not
wicked; it was merely foolish ; but the consequences have
been awful. I did not think at the time that it was even
foolish; merely perhaps a little impulsive, and yet a thing
that anyone might do. I will tell you what it was: I bought
thirty shares in a rubber company. Some one—I know
now an enemy, but thought then a friend—advised me to do
so. They would go up, he said, in the casual way in which
so much of life's evil is done. So I bought them—a mere
thirty, and should have forgotten all about them had
circumstances permitted.
How many things one can do secretly in this London of
ours I have never counted; but this is certain, that one
cannot buy thirty shares in a rubber company and expect
the news not to leak out. What the organisation may be
I know not, but it seems to be perfect for spreading such,
as you might think, trivial and unimportant tidings. Some
herald, I take it, carries round the information, “Mr. Blank,
of Dash Street, has bought thirty shares in the Pandamanan
Rubber Co.' "
This announcement falls apparently on very greedy ears,
designed, one imagines, and kept open and alert for nothing
else in the world; for the next day what do I receive but
the prospectus of the Ponkalong Rubber Co.' This is
rather odd, I thought, coming so soon after the last, but I
dismissed it as an ordinary chance of life. On returning
home in the evening I found, however, another long envelope
containing the prospectus of the Boomoo Rubber Co. The
next morning came that of the Bandarman Rubber Co., and
the next evening the Antananarivo Rubber Co. .
What has come to the world? I wondered. Where is
all this rubber to go when it is made? Are we in future
to eat rubber? Is rubber to be our only wear? Still
asking myself these questions, I opened two more long
envelopes and revealed the allurements of the Singalay
Rubber Co. and the Guava löubber Co. :
They were all alike in two respects: no matter how distant
the plantations, all offered unparalleled opportunities to
the investor, and all wanted my money. Why they should
conclude so spontaneously that because I had idiotically
(as I now began to know) ventured upon thirty shares in the
Pandamanan Rubber Co., I had therefore spare cash for every
other Rubber Co. existing, I have no idea; but they did.
That was eleven weeks ago, and every post since has brought
me (I swear I do not exaggerate) new Rubber prospectuses.
I no longer open them; I throw them instinctively into the
waste-paper basket.
But the situation provokes statistical reflections. I believe
that if all the prospectuses of all the Rubber Companies that
have come to me since the fatal moment when I first took the
wrong turning were spread out they would cover Lord's
Cricket-ground. I believe that if all their capitals were
added together they would more than pay the National
Debt. I believe that if all the directors were gathered to-
gether they would fill Holloway Prison. I believe that if
all the promises of wealth were collated they would be
found to contain exactly the same words.
I believe—— But I am tired of the subject. I hate
rubber. I can't bear to see a motor-car, because of its tyres;
I can't bear to see a policeman, because of his soles; I can't
bear to see an artist, because of his eraser. It is nothing to
me that my thirty shares have gone up; I have done with
rubber for ever.

A RAMSHACKLE ROOM.
WHEN the gusts are at play with the trees on the lawn,
And the lights are put out in the vault of the night;
When within all is snug, for the curtains are drawn,
And the fire is aglow and the lamps are alight,
Sometimes, as I muse, from the place where I am
My thoughts fly away to a room near the Cam.
'Tis a ramshackle room, where a man might complain
Of a slope in the ceiling, a rise in the floor;
With a view on a court and a glimpse on a lane,
And no end of cool wind through the chinks of the door;
With a deep-seated chair that I love to recall,
And some groups of young oarsmen in shorts on the wall.
There's a fat jolly jar of tobacco, some pipes—
A meerschaum, a briar, a cherry, a clay—
There’s a three-handled cup fit for Audit or Swipes
When the breakfast is done and the plates cleared away.
There's a litter of papers, of books a scratch lot,
Such as Plato, and Dickens, and Liddell and Scott.
And a crone in a bonnet that's more like a rag
From a mist of remembrance steps suddenly out;
And her funny old tongue never ceases to wag
As she tidies the room where she bustles about ;
For a man may be strong and a man may be young,
But he can't put a drag on a Bedmaker's tongue.
And, oh, there's a youngster who sits at his ease
In the hope, which is vain, that the tongue may run down,
With his feet on the grate and a book on his knees,
And his cheeks they are smooth and his hair it is brown.
Then I sigh myself back to the place where I am
From that ramshackle room near the banks of the Cam.

[Second Series.]
CHAPTER W.--THE NIGHT.
THE play was a great success ; I
know, because many of the audience
told me so afterwards. Had they but
guessed what was going on behind the
scenes, the congratulations would have
been even more enthusiastic. For as
near as a touch we had to drop the
egg-proof curtain and hand the money
back.
I am going to give you the opening
scene as it was actually said—not as it
was heard across the footlights—and
then you will understand. As you may
remember, the Ratcatcher (Me) and the
Maid (Myra) take the stage first, and
they introduce themselves in the usual
way to the audience and each other.
The scene is the palace of the Emperor
Bong (Simpson). Very well then.
Maid (sweetly). Truly his Majesty is a
handsome man, and I wonder not that
his people love him.
Ratcatcher (rather nervous). Thou
surprisest me. I saw him in the wings
—in the winter garden just now, that
is to say anon, and thought him plain.
But hush, here he comes.
[They salaam, or whatever you call
it, and stay there.
Ra'catcher (still salaaming). What's
the silly ass waiting for 2 I can't stick
this much longer; the blood's all going
to my head like anything.
Maid (in a similar position). He must
have forgotten his cue. Can't you say,
“Hush, here he comes,” again 2
Ratcatcher. I can't say anything out
loud in this position. Do you think I
might come up for a breath 2
Maid (loudly). His Majesty tarries.
Ratcatcher (sotto voce). He does.
You've got it.
Maid. Whatever shall we do 2 Do
think of something.
Ratcatcher. Well, I'm going to rise to
the surface. I'm tired of being a sub-
marine. [They both stand up.
Maid (brilliantly). Perchance it was a
rat we heard and not his Majesty.
Ratcatcher (with equal brilliance). Fear
not, fair damsel. Behold, I will investi-
gate. [Proceeds to back of stage.
Archie (from wings). Come off, you
idiot.
Ratcatcher (always the gentleman—to
Maid). Tarry a while, my heart, what
time I seek assistance. [Eacit.
Maid (confidentially to audience—to
keep the thing going). Truly he is a
noble youth, though he follows a lowly
profession. 'Tis not the apparel that
proclaims the man. Methinks . . .
Me (annoyed). Who's an idiot?
Archie. Didn't you see me wink?
That ass Simpson's banged his nose
against a door-post and is bleeding like
a pig. Says it's because he hadn't got
his spectacles.
Me. More likely the champagne.
Archie. They’re dropping keys down
his back as hard as they can. Will you
and Myra gag a bit, till he's ready ?
Me (excitedly). My good fool, how on
earth——
Myra (coming to back of stage). But
behold he returns ! [Frowns imperiously.
Ratcatcher (coming on again very un-
willingly). Ah, fair maid, 'tis thee. I
bring thee good tidings. I met one in
the ante-room, a long-legged scurvy
fellow, who did tell me that his Majesty
was delayed on some business.
Maid. That must have been his Con-
jurer — I know him well. (Aside)
What's happened?
Ratcatcher. Let us then rest a while,
an it please thee. (Seizing her by the
arm.) Over here. That ass Simpson's
hurt himself. We've got to amuse the
audience till he's finished bleeding.
Maid (sitting down, with her back to
audience). I say, is it really serious 2
Ratcatcher. Not for him ; it is for us.
Now then, talk away.
Maid. Er—h'm. (Coyly) Wilt not tell
me of thy early life, noble sir—how
thou didst become a catcher of rats?
Ratcatcher (disgusted). You coward
(Aloud) Nay, rather let me hear of thine
own life. (Aside) Scored.
Maid. That's not fair. I asked you
first. (Modestly) But I am such a little
thing, and you are so noble a youth.
Ratcatcher. True. (Having a dash
at it.) 'Twas thus. My father, when I
was yet a child, didst—did—no, didst
—apprentice me to a salad binger
Maid (with interest). How dost one
bing salads?
Ratcatcher (curtly). Ballad singer.
And I would frequent the market-place
at noon, singing catches and glees, and
receiving from the entranced populace
divers coins, curses, bricks, and other
ornaments. One morn, as I was em-
barked upon a lovely ballad, “Place me
amidst the young gazelles,” I was seized
right suddenly from behind. (Bored to
death.) I'm sick of this. We're sup-
posed to be amusing the audience.
Maid. Oh, go on, I’m getting awfully
excited. i
Emperor (audibly, from green-room).
Confound it, it’s begun again. -
Executioner (bitterly). And to think
that I spent hours putting red ink on
my axeſ
Maid (with great presence of mind).
What's that ? sºft that was a rat 2
Ratcatcher (greatly relieved). It was.
(Getting up.) Let's have Archie on, and
see if he can amuse them a bit more.
(Aloud) I must finish my tale anon.
Stay here, sweet child, what time I fetch
my trusty terrier. [E.cit.
Maid. 'Tis a strange story he tells.
How different from my own simple life!
Born of proud but honest parents . .
Archie. What's up? Stick to it.
Me. Have you got such a thing as a
trusty terrier on you?
Archie. Don't be an ass.
Me. Well, the audience will be ex-
tremely disappointed if I don't bring
one back. I practically promised them
I would. Look here, why don't you
come on and help? Everybody is
getting horribly bored with us.
Archie (delighted). Oh, all right.
Enter Ratcatcher and Conjurer.
Maid. But behold he returns again /
Ratcatcher (excitedly). Great news,
fair lady, which this long-legged scurvy
fellow I told you of will impart to us.
Maid. Why, 'tis the Conjurer. Have
you news for us, Sir?
Conjurer (with no illusions about the
Oriental style). Absolutely stop press.
What is it you want to know? Racing?
The Bong selling plate was won by
Proboscis, McSimp up. Immense enthu-
siasm. Bank rate unchanged — quite
right this cold weather. Excuse me a
moment, Sir, your moustache is coming
off . . . No, the left wing—allow me to
lend you a postage - stamp. Do you
prefer red or green 2
Maid (biting her lip). Will you not
give us news of the Emperor 2
Conjurer. I will. His Majesty las
met with a severe accident whilst out
hunting this morning, being bitten by
a buffalo.
Maid. Alas, what will my mistress say?
Conjurer. She has already said every-
thing that was necessary. Her actual
words were, “Just like Bong.”
Ratcatcher (seizing the opportunity).
His Majesty ordered me to meet him
here at noon. Methinks I had better
withdraw and return anon.
[Makes off hurriedly.
Conjurer (seizing him). Not so. He
bade me command you to stay and sing
to us. ſº
Ratcatcher (huskily). Alas, I have for-
gotten my voice—that is, I have left my
music at home. I will go and fetch it.
[Has another dash.
Listen!
[They all listen.
Simpson (in wings). Thanks, thanks,
that will be all right now. Oh no, quite,
thanks. Oh, is this your key? Thanks,
thanks. No, it doesn't matter about the
other ones; they don't feel at all uncom-
fortable, thanks. Yes, I think it really
did stop it, thanks.
Conjurer. I'm off. (Aloud) His Ma-
jesty has regained consciousness. [Erit.
Simpson (apologetically). Oh, Archie,
I’ve got the billiard-room key in my—

OUR BOY.
Not to be outdone by The Evening
News and the highly variegated and
gratuitous exploits which its “Man,”
Mr. ARTHUR GooDE, is daily and nightly
performing on behalf of our contem-
porary's readers, Mr. Punch has recently
bought a Boy, and has been over-
whelmed with a rush of applications
for his services. He is an extremely
intelligent and versatile Scout, as will
be gathered from his first six days'
programme. As yet barely twelve years
of age, he has outgrown his position as
Patrol Leader of the Wolves, and has
decided to devote his talents to a more
universal use. We have purchased our
small Factotum for a mere song, but,
before exhausting his capabilities we
confidently expect that the bright little
fellow will have solved most of the
problems which are now perplexing
society. He confesses, however, his
inability to make a North Country
audience understand what Tariff Reform
really does mean, and to render the
present comet visible from Bouverie St.
Subject to these limitations, we give a
short diary of his engagements for the
coming week:-
Monday.--Do a day's charring for a
bed-ridden countess. In the evening,
draw up the King's Speech for Mr.
Asquith, and help to rearrange the
Cabinet.
Tuesday. — Before breakfast, test a
gas-meter for an over-worked curate.
Morning, teach a defeated Radical Can-
didate how not to be a “bad loser.”
Afternoon, convert Lady BLOUNT to the
globular theory of the earth (tough job,
this). Later, cure a young lady of
chilblains and do up the back fastenings
of her dress for dinner. Evening, edit
The Times and put it to bed.
Wednesday. — Photo Mr. McKENNA's
heir, and investigate cause of Paris
floods. Offer suggestions for further
postponement of Chanteeler, and later
in the afternoon adjust differences
between Turkey and Greece. Invent a
new motto for the KAISER to put up in
his bedroom, and persuade a Suffragette
to give up the silly practice of chalking
the pavement.
Thursday.—From 10.0 to 1.0 reconcile
Mr. WiLLIAM O'BRIEN and Mr. John RED.
Mond. In the early afternoon relieve bow
in the Cambridge Eight and find Dr.
Cook. Devise a musical instrument to
represent hair standing on end in
STRAUSS's Elektra. After dinner, help
Mr. EUSTACE MILES digest a pumpkin
soufflé.
Friday.—Give advice to Curzon Street
crossing-sweeper on development of his
pitch. Afterwards, conduct a Labour
Exchange, and explain to delighted
crowd how twenty-five jobs are to be dis-
tributed among five thousand claimants.
Run down to Swinford Old Manor and
assist the PoET LAUREATE in his latest
ode with a new rhyme to “throstle.”
After dinner, give lessons to Messrs.
LLOYD GEORGE and WINSTON CHURCHILL
on “Meiosis and Litotes, or the Art of
Understatement.” *
Saturday. — Regulate the traffic in
Piccadilly, and act as understudy to ||
Mr. TitouTHEck at an inquest. After
lunch, regulate the traffic, i.e. referee,
in a football match, and subsequently
visit hospital.
It will be seen that Our Boy has a
pleasantly varied time of it, but that he
conscientiously avoids taking girls to
skating rinks, or assisting at concerts
and fancy-dress balls. Applications for
his assistance should be sent to the
Punch office, marked “Boy.”

ART FOR ART's SAKE.
LET the maiden of ambition listen well
While I tell
Of a lady who arose to sudden ſame
From a wild desire to shine
In the literary line;
She is quite a friend of mine,
All the same.
Knowing nothing of the labour of the pen,
There and then
She determined, in a sunny way she had,
That she never would depart
From the highest form of Art,
Which, considered as a start,
Wasn't bad.
Much uplifted by that laudable intent,
Off she went
To attain to fame and fortune at a stroke,
And in time produced a book
Which the public wouldn't look
At, and all the critics took
As a joke.
Did she cry aloud in horror? Did she tear
Off her hair?
Did º ºppointment stab her like a
art :
Not a bit of it. She said,
She was far above the head
Of a mob who never read
Works of Art.
As an Artist, to be slighted by the crowd
Made her proud;
And she begged to be permitted to
Suggest
That, as long as sales were low,
That was all she cared to know ;
And the multitude could go
And be blest.
But she made a second effort.
hold
It was sold
By the thousand, by the million
she struck
And be-
And
(To the undisputed gloom
Of her rivals) on a boom t
That should last her to the tomb,
Given luck. i
Every year (when Christmas present time
is due)
Something new
Will be offered from her never-failing
store;
And the universal mob
Gives a sympathetic throb,
And, with something like a sob,
Asks for more.
There are cavillers who sneer at her
technique
(Which is weak)
And her style (which it is easy to assail),
But it's credibly averred
That her powers are never stirred
Save at half-a-crown a word,
On the mail.
And, if questioned on the cause of her
success,
She'll confess
That her victory is merely what she owes
(Putting genius quite apart)
To the Public's love of Art,
For the Public (bless its heart!)
Always knows. DUM-DUM.
OPERATIC NOTES.
The programme of Mr. Oliver
Codling's forthcoming Grand Opera
season is remarkable for its catholicity.
It will include Parsifal, The Bohemian
Girl, Fidelio, The Merry Devil, Tristan
und Isolde and STRAUss's Electrocuta—
the last-named subject to the approval of
the Censor. Besides these standard
works Mr. Codling hopes to produce
A Suburban Hamlet by Mr. Archie
Pelago, the famous Anglo-Hellenic com-
poser; Ulat Tamalarezul, an Etruscan
Fantasy - opera by Mr. Quantock de
Banville; and Jack the Ripper, a grand
opéra comique by Mr. Ole Brok.
Some notion of the initial difficulties
to be faced by Mr. Codling may be
gathered from the fact that each per-
formance of The Suburban Hamlet will
cost £2,000, irrespective of the com-
ser's fee for conducting his work,
which is £500 a night. Again, for
M. de Banville's work the orchestra will
be increased to 200 performers, while
in Mr. Ole Brok's masterpiece no fewer
than 1,200 instrumentalists will be em-
ployed, including 300 contrabass bulbo:
phones with reciprocating nozzles and
Harveyised placket-flanges.
But the preliminary outgoings reach
their high-water mark in the case of
Electrocuta, where the insp'ssated gloom
of the story and the appalling display

i
of blood-boltered ferocity in the last Act
render it necessary for the management
to retain the services of a whole army
of medical men, ambulance bearers and
nurses to attend to the needs of the
terrified spectators. Sir Hector Parsley,
Bart., the famous brain specialist, will
attend every performance at a fee of one
thousand guineas a night, and it is
hoped that his mere presence will exert
a restraining influence on neurotic
auditors.
The team of artists already engaged
challenges attention, not merely for the
talent of the singers but their widely
different nationalities, viz., Mesdames
Cara Cass, Materna Seigel, Maria Joly,
Camma Miles, Varalette Archdeacon,
and Pallida Pinker, sopranos; Mesdames
Casta Royal, Sanna Tojen (the famous
Finnish artist), Milka Metchnikoff and
Plasma Tabb-Lloyd, contraltos; MM.
Sidney Doan and S. M. Kaps-Yule,
tenors; and MM. Pulvermacher, Galli-
poteaux and Barbroux, basses.
Some personal particulars relating to
these redoubtable artists will perhaps
be of interest to our readers. Madame
Materna Seigel, who is of Bessarabian
extraction, is a woman of colossal build
and Amazonian physique. Her shrieks
in the death-scene, as STRAUss once
generously observed, are more like the
cries of an inspired macaw than those of
a human being. Even in private life
hers is a formidable personality, and
DEBUssy is reported to have said that
she reminded him of a mammoth who
had swallowed a peacock.
Madame Camma Miles is another singer
of Titanic proportions, and her fore-arm
is quite the finest on the lyric stage.
For fifty years her voice has caused
indescribable emotions in the hearts of
the habitués of the Grand Opera at
Odessa. Madame Pallida Pinker is a
superb Californian brunette, and Madame
Varalette Archdeacon, who was born
at Varallo, is noted for the exquisite
effervescing quality of her high notes.
Madame Milka Metchnikoff studied suc-
cessively under Herr Sauer and Dr.
Bacillin, the famous Russian voice-pro-
ducer. She has a Grecian profile and
belongs to the sect of the Doukhobors.
On the other hand, Madame Sanna Tojen
is a Mennonite with Bollandist proclivi-
ties, while Mr. Kaps-Yule affects the
Palatinoid heresy.
Another operatic venture which is
exciting deep interest is that of Signor
Fabiani Mercanzia, who announces a
short season at the Imperial Theatre.
The remarkable, indeed unique, feature
of this enterprise is that only one opera
will be performed and only one vocalist

The Resurrection of a Riddle.
A correspondent sends us the following extract from the
February number of The Contemporary Review:—“Troubles
and rumours of troubles in the confused world of inter-
national politics ushered in the first year of the second
decade of the twentieth century.” He also sends us a
letter of seven closely-written sheets pointing out that
1911 will be the first year of the second decade of the
twentieth century. He adds that it is difficult to prove
this in a brief letter, but that he will be pleased to
write an article on the subject so that we may place the
truth before our readers. He goes on to make unkindly
references to the intellectual condition of an editor who
permits such a gross misstatement to appear in his review.
The question of the exact date of the beginning of the
century is one of those great questions which have ceased to
move us deeply. We had quite enough of it, one way and
another, in 1900, and hoped the matter was ended; and we
don't want any articles or correspondence whatever about
this hoary riddle. We may add that if people would call
the year simply “1910," instead of “the first year of the
second decade of the twentieth century,” a lot of trouble
would be avoided.

Nervous Suitor. “I HAVE, SIR, AND-ER—ER—I still wish to MARRY Your DAUGHTER,”
GOOD NEWS FOR PATRIOTS.
EVERY one really interested in the
well-being, intellectual and political, of
Londoners will be delighted to hear
that another music-hall larger than any
at present existing in Great Britain
is now in course of construction at a
cost of £200,000 for variety entertain-
ments twice daily.
This is as it should be, and the pro-
moters' patriotic efforts to get frivolity
into a people that otherwise might be
doing themselves harm by thought cannot
be too highly applauded. More particu-
larly should they be thanked for the
wise boon of a regular afternoon per-
formance, coming at a time, as it does,
when so many persons are tempted to
weary, if not positively injure, them-
selves with work.
A country isolated and protected, as
we are, by that great natural rampart
the sea, is in a position different in every
respect from a continental nation with
no such advantage. Were we to be
told, for example, that Berlin was adding
to its present inconsiderable number of
places of entertainment a new music-
hall vaster than anything already exist-
ing in Germany, we should shake our
heads in some anxiety and disapproval.
For Germany has no physical guarantees
of immunity from attack, such as we
have, and therefore it behoves her to
think rather of technical schools and
gymnasiums, rifle clubs and studious-
neSS.
Again, France would be ill-advised to
overdo recreation and live entirely on
the memory of greatness, with her
frontier so beset by Teutonic guards.
But a nation like ourselves, which is at
the top of the tree and so obviously the
darling of the gods, may be permitted
its hours of ease in very considerable
profusion; we have indeed earned them.
It is therefore that such an announce-
ment as this concerning the new music-
hall for Oxford Circus, capable of hold-
ing its thousands every afternoon and
evening (to be opened next September),
fills us with satisfaction. London needs
all the gaiety it can know, the total of
music-halls at this moment being so
small—only thirty-six in London proper
and thirteen in the suburbs, with a
beggarly forty-six theatres in London
and twelve in the suburbs, not to
mention a poor sprinkling of skating
rinks and cinematograph-halls in addi-
tion.
If we had a criticism to make, it would
be that morning performances should be
given too—beginning, say, at eleven,
when work often is getting so tiresome;
but even such a suggestion as that is
ungrateful when we recollect what this
new enterprise really means.
One word more. Mr. GIBBONs, the
benefactor who is preparing for London
the new hall, is at present, he says, in
doubt whether to call it “The Palla-
dium ” or “The Arena.” Both names
are excellent; but would not “The Lotus.”
or “The Siren’’ be even better?

YUss, you meets some queer cards.
A nole lidy 'ires me by the hour last

I glanced across at the mild-looking

who smiled pleasantly to himself, and
hummed a little tune, as he turned over

jotted down figures in a big note-book.

that section of the newspaper where the
latest figures appeared, and now, poor
fellow, he misses them dreadfully, and
can't get over it. He makes a cheerful
best of it, however, and, failing election
figures, you see, he contents himself
with others.” º
Just then he was adding up the lines
in a column, and as we watched him he
proceeded to multiply them by 17,095,
being the number of the issue of the
paper. Turning the pages rapidly, he
entered other figures in his note-book,
finally casting the paper aside and
adding up the grand total, which
appeared to give him every satisfaction.
“I can show you something very
interesting,” he said, addressing me.
“Do you mind counting the number of
pages in this newspaper?” and he
handed me his Daily Telegraph. The
number was twenty.
“Now watch me,” he said, and ſolding
the paper in two he cut it through with
; his knife. “Now count the number of
pages,” he said triumphantly, handing
| me the two halves together.
|
“Forty,” I said.
“Now you understand how twenty
gains count forty on a division,” he
explained.

Reggie was a small boy with ideas.
He had read the newspapers intelli-
gently during the Elections, and he had
noted the terrible effect that could be
produced by quoting what some great
Politician had said years ago.
Keeping his own counsel, he went to
| the stationer's and bought a threepenny
" note-book. He headed the pages as
follows: “What Father said,” “What
Mother said,” “What Beryl said,”
| “What Tom said,” leaving some dozen
! pages for each section. -
|: . He has already begun his entries,
| giving the exact date to each. In a fit
j; exasperation his father called out to
| him the other day when Reggie was
# strumming for his own amusement:
“You must not play that piano!” Reggie
has put it down, thinking that it will be
| useful to quote when the practising of
scales seems to have no charms for him.
“I don't want you to go to church in
the rain," his mother said on Sunday,
| when Reggie, in spite of a heavy cold,
begged to be allowed to go and hear his
friend the fat curate preach. It is now
in the book, ready for a wet Sunday
when the Vicar will hold forth. “You’re
a nasty boy, and I don't want you ever
to play with me again,” is entered under
Beryl's name, and should successfully
counter any appeal at an inconvenient
moment; while Tom's latest offer is
noted thus: “I will give my knife for
one of your skates,” an option which
Reggie proposes to exercise when the
winter is over.

LITERARY NOTE.
The latest cinematoscope, device is
the pictorial arrangement of short stories
from the magazines, with enough ex-
planation to make the author (should he
be present) flush with pride.
The idea should spread, and indeed is
spreading, a mass meeting of literary
agents (who, it is well known, now far
outnumber the authors) having been
held in the Albert Hall to agree as to
a line of policy.
As an outcome we are informed that
the film-makers are hard at work pre-
paring a strip 8,000 miles in length, or
a third of the distance round the world
—the longest ever made—for the ade-
quate pictorial treatment of It Never
Can Happen Again, Mr. DE MoRGAN's
latest trifle.
This, of course, will mean for a while
a film famine, but directly that is over
the audiences of London may expect to
see bioscoped several recent fictional
successes, including some amusing
fancies of Mr. HeNRY JAMES, while it
is probable that many authors will in
future write direct for this public, and,
in the present state of literary mutiny,
let the ordinary readers go.
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, for example, is,
it is alleged, already at work upon a
cinematoscope romance on a film that
would reach from London to West Herts
and back again, entitled (to touch the
sympatheticchords of themusic-hall audi-
ence) A Boy's Best Friend is His Mother.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE O'FLYNN.”
WHEN the Actor-Manager of His
Majesty's finds himself with a part that
suits him, more than half the battle is
already won. And there can be no
manner of doubt that the inconsequent
character of The O'Flynn was admirably
adapted to Sir BEERBOHM's methods. Swag-
gering yet courageous, swashbuckler and
poet, egoist and altruist, Falstaff and
Cyrano in one, sighs behind the laughter
and laughter behind the sighs, and
ESPRIT d'ESCALIER.
The O'Flynn (Sir H. B. Thee) extemporises
for the benefit of the Lady Benedetta Mount-
michael (Miss EvelyN D’ALRoy).
the right Irish humour playing over
all—it was a figure (for professional
purposes) after his own heart. As for
the play, which, after all, is the thing,
it has its good moments, as in the
duel of swords, when The O'Flynn
forbears his own advantage and swallows
a bowl of punch between thrust and
parry, so as to put his drunken adver-
sary on level terms with him; or in
the duel of drinks — with Burgundy
this time for the medium—between the
hero and Van Dronk. But Mr. JUSTIN
McCARTHY's design is rather naive, and
the dialogue and action have their thin
patches, notably in Act I. and the
first scene of Act III. It showed, too,
a certain poverty of invention to make
The O'Flynn masquerade twice over
in other men's wigs.
My pleasantest memory is of Miss
EVELYN D'ALRoy. To every word and
motion and mood she brought an exqui-
site grace and dignity. I shall not soon
forget her loyal anger in defence of Lord
Sedgemouth, who had been challenged
an pinked for using her name lightly
in public. “He is my lover: he may
say of me what he chooses.” I doubt
if we have any living actress who could
have played the part of The Lady
Benedetta with a more perfect charm
and distinction.
As for Mr. HENRY ANLEY, lie is in-
capable of poor work; but I think the
audience never quite recovered from the
shock of finding that he had been cast
for the leading villain of the piece. If
possible he should always be a hero,
doing things as handsome as his face.
Mr. Edward SAss, as Van Dronk, gave
an admirable study in bibulous Dutch,
and Miss AURIOL LEE, in the part of a
strolling comédienne, known as Fancy
Free (though never found in strictly
“maiden meditation”), did full justice
| to her name, and to the extreme candour
of her part. I could have wished that
Mr. NIGEL PLAYFAIR, as a mournful buf-
foon, doomed to suffer from toothache
and a necklace of sausages, had had
more scope for his talent.
Perhaps the most effective figure of
all was that of Mr. FAY, who, as the un-
crowned Majesty of Munster, did the one
real piece of Irish work in the play.
As with so many of his race, there was
a strain of unforced pathos under his
brave show of humour.
Altogether, I have to thank everybody
for a very pleasant entertainment which
never taxed my intelligence beyond its
simple powers. And in any case I could
never have the heart to find fault with a
play in which the author has shown so
generous an appreciation of the merits
of punch. O. S.
“DR. JEKYI.L AND MR. HYDE.”
MR. CoMYNS CARR's play at the Queen's
Theatre is “founded on ” STEVENSON's
book, and provides a score of parts; if
it had been “adapted from " it, then it
would have been a one-man play, and
we should have had an uninterrupted
evening of Mr. H. B. IRWING. That is what
I should have liked. We should, of
course, have needed.a. certain number of
walkerson, for Hyde to strangle; supers
with thinking, or rather dying, parts;
possibly a child or two. For the rest,
Mr. IRVING—now as Jekyll, now as
Hyde; soliloquising, transfigurating,
murdering.
Mr. CARR, as a practised playwright,
knows better than to allow this; there
would be nothing dramatic about the
death of an odd super; Hyde must have
some splendid reason for killing. So
Jekyll is provided with the usual
entanglement. An old intrigue with
Lady Carew is about to be revealed to
Sir Danvers, the injured husband, by
a discharged butler who has obtained
possession of “the letters.” (Yes, actu-
ally “the letters” again! Why will
people write? And now they talk
about a Sunday post as well!) Lady
Carew appeals frantically (Act I.) to
Jekyll to save her. Jekyll is filled
with wild and wicked thoughts about
Sir Danvers and the butler (particularly
Sir Danvers) . . . and behold, he has
automatically changed into Hyde As
Hyde, of course he has no difficulty
in putting things on a more secure
basis (Act II.); strangling Sir D. and
cutting the but'er's throat.
So far Mr. CoMYNs CARR. In the last
two Acts STEVENSON has much more of
a show. Here we do see Hyde hiding
(I'm sorry, I can't help it) from the
police in his Soho lodgings, in a fury
of impatience for the arrival of the drug
which will restore him to the form of
Jekyll. Mr. IRVING was magnificent in
this Act—a very devil (if devils are
cowards too) as he gloated over his
past orgies and trembled for his present
danger. (But why such a miserable
Dr. Jekyll (Mr. H. B. IRVING). “I am ill, I.
am ill—I must have a complete change.” * *
(Makes it in the next Act.)
lodging? You can do more in the orgy
way, I should have thought, with luxu-
rious surroundings.) Magnificent he
was, too, in the last scene of all;
where (as in the book) the spirit of
Jekyll is finally imprisoned in the body,
of Hyde, and there is no way out but
death. These two Acts were inde-
pendent of Mr. CARR’s “plot,” and they
could not help being the better for it. . .
Of course Mr. CARR had an impossible
task; it is not his fault that STEVENSON's
strange case does not go into a play.
But if you will not see a great play at the
Queen's you will at least be properly
horrified. Mr. IRVING will make you'
shudder—he may even make you dream.
As a contrast you will enjoy the curtain-
raiser, The Plumbers, a music-hall sketch
which cannot fail to make you laugh.
Thus in one evening you can experience
most of the emotions. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
J. PLUvius (as the sporting papers style him) has been
accused of constantly popping out of his machine to ruin
top-hats and test matches, and to interfere in even more
important human affairs. Yet, from the classic case of
Dido and AEneas, whom he drove into the fated cave, to the
more modern instance of Ralph and Phyllis, the protagonists
in A Winter's Comedy (LAURIE), for whom the god arranged
a first meeting in a Yorkshire farmhouse, he has assisted at
more love-affairs than Venus herself. J. P. and Mr. HALLIWELL
SUTCLIFFE were so pleased with the success of their little
experiment with Ralph and Phyllis that they agreed
to repeat it in the shape of a heavy mist which cut the
happy pair off from the rest of the world, when they
were out hunting on the moors, and forcibly convinced
Ralph that I'hyllis was his only joy. Ralph belonged to
story. “Ah,” he says, with bated breath, “if only I dared tell
you the horror at which I must only hint; ” and all the time
you are saying cheerfully to yourself, “What, poor old Pan
again 2 Never !” No. 19, in fact, can be recommended to
readers with a sense of humour as a pleasant and harmless
little story of the blackest magic.
The range of subjects in Mrs. MANN's volume of short
stories, Bound Together (Mills AND Boon) is so wide that if
you have a weakness of any kind she is almost certain to
gratify it. Granted that you are a pre-Rafflesite and no
worshipper of burglars, you can still take your choice
between Sabbat urians, cats and people who “love the
mystic.” If you are not excited by the stupidities of a
jealous wife, you may still be interested in the antics of a
silly husband. To take the two best stories—Old Billy
Knock is a simple tale, which tells of a great love of home
in the heart of a labouring man; but it also reveals a
nobility and a firmness of mind which those who regard

and bore a wonderful and mysterious likeness to Ralph's

through Mr. SUTCLIFFE's simple but pleasant little story with
exceeding smoothness. Everything, in fact, goes as right as
Talll.
If a man may say that he was “disappointed in the
Atlantic” perhaps I may be allowed to confess that I am fed
up with the great god Pan. Pan comes trotting into EDGAR
JEPSON's book, No. 19 (MILLS AND BOON), and he is sur-
rounded by all the dear old mysteres. The dead woman,
the horrible smell of the goat, the cloven footsteps in
the gravel, the man who has lost his reason and can only
mutter, “Pan is not dead”—these are all here; yet Mr.
JEPSON pretends to leave his hero, John Plowden, absolutely
mystified as to the happenings of the night. John cannot
have read much contemporary fiction. Of course I don't
mind if the hero of a novel seems to be a fool, but I object
to the assumption that the reader is too; and I am annoyed
when an author appears to plume himself on some quality
which is entirely absent from his book. You can almost
hear Mr. JEPSON shuddering at the awful mysteries of his

"THE FEMALE VETO.
L'homme propose: la femme dispose.
BETTY, I have borne enough
Comes a time, I’d have you know,
When the worm, however tough,
Has to let his feelings go ;
When the People, suffering long
'Neath the upper crust (or stratum),
Turns at last to right the wrong
With a manly ultimatum.
Sound proposals I indite;
Hand them in on bended joint;
You reject the things at sight,
Or amend the crucial point;
“Wiſe,” a most important word
(This is where I get so gloomy),
“Wife” you cancel as absurd,
But you'll be a “sister” to me.
Well, it's more than I can stand;
Must my manhood still be mute,
Humbled by a woman's hand,
Bested by a woman's boot ?
Shall they make me drink the dust–
Such a tiny hand and wee toe 2
No, my Betty, I will bust
Up your antiquated veto.
I have swallowed bitter rue
All these barren, blighted years,
Now I mean to deal with you
As the Commons with the Peers.
Every Valentine I've shot
At your heart, you chose to flout it;
Now I'll have my way, if not
With your leave, why, then, without it.
Twice, within a certain space,
I propose to press my claim ;
Twice (I give you ample grace)
You are free to spurn the same;
But—for I decline to spend
Half my life in looking silly—
At the third time I intend
You shall wed me, willy-nilly.
“What!” you say, “if I refuse
Still when you have thrice appealed,
Is it your design to use
Savage force to make me yield 2"
“Go to Asquith,” I reply;
“Scoop the secrets of the Caesar;
Bring them here, and then will I
Tel you what my “guarantees’ are.”
The Very Latest Rumour.
From a bright young contemporary:
“It is not improbable that another vacancy
may be caused by the retirement of Lord
Wolverhampton from the Duchy of Lancaster.”
And if Mr. BRYCE would only retire from
the Irish Secretaryship there would be
yet another vacancy.

HORAE PETRINAE.
WE note with natural satisfaction that
Mr. PETER KEARY has now so far modi-
fied his original views on Success as to
admit that you cannot always “get it in
one.” But there are some obvious omis-
sions in his new work, Success after
Failure, and these we now propose to
remedy in Mr. KEARY's best manner.
HANNIBAL.
HANNIBAL began life as a donkey-boy
at Biskra. He was a wild young rip,
and so given to practical jokes that he
soon got the chuck and enlisted in the
Carthaginian Hussars.
Nature, while generally true enough in
the long run, sometimes wobbles a bit
on the start, while she is getting her
bearings, but dear old HANNY wasn't long
in getting on the job. * *
He introduced elephants into the
Carthaginian cavalry, patented a new
army boot, and not long after won the
battle of Cannae against the Romans.
HANNIBAL was the first man to cross
the Alps. It was a tough job, but he
did it, assisted by HASDRUBAL, HIMILCO,
HITHERTO, and other Phoenician bosses.
Then came Capua and the fleshpots of
Campania.
Capua ' What a moral that word
teaches | | Old HANNY was a bit of an
epicure and the restaurant life was too
much for his constitution.
He and his soldiers got “fed up,” and
FABIUs and Scipio knocked spots off him
in the long run.
Then he started as a financier and
company-promoter in the East.
He worked hard, but good intentions
without results failed to fill the bill and
he perished by his own hand.
Poor HANNIBAL!
When he died he was
volcano.
If he were alive now I'd offer him
£20,000 down for his reminiscences.
Mirrored in the pages of his deadly
enemies, HANNIBAL still fairly knocks us.
And, after all, no greater book has ever
been written than Livy's History.
He makes the most wonderful people
and happenings live before us just as
they were in those golden days. No
an extinct
S. man who has any sort of mental ambi.
tion can afford to be without this master-
piece of luscious narrative.
If you haven't read it get it at once.
If you can't read it in the Latin, buy,
borrow, or steal a crib.
I mean to read it as soon as ever I
stop writing books.

had not as yet dawned upon the world.
The Muses were sick, the Pierian spring
had lost its fizzle, and people were won-
dering if the “tuneful nine” would ever
pipe up again. -
Then came Milton and altered every-
thing. -
There was no “blue blood" in John
Milton's veins. From the “Smart Set’”
of his day he was as far removed as he
was from the inhabitants of Mars.
He wrote Paradise Lost, the greatest
epic in the English language, a work
that is especially necessary in this
hustling, commercial age, when the
material is so overshadowing the
spiritual, and when pretty nearly all
life's values dwarf before that of the
banknote. - -
But Milton did not merely write
Paradise Lost. He sold it for £10 !!!

he kept up his pecker to the end, and
gave his daughters “what for ” on the

THE CUPBOARD VALENTINE.
O Mary, in this month of Lent,
Although the motley minstrel feels
It hard upon his native bent,
An Anglo-Saxon never squeals,
And I adhere to my intent
Of cutting down my monstrous meals.
And so these Cupids on the wing,
This lover's bow I did not choose
To mail to any sweet young thing
Who fires my amatory Muse,
But her who makes the kettle sing—
A somewhat different pair of shoes.
There may be beauty more divine
Than that to which I fondly look,
But yours is that resplendent shrine,
With saucepans hung on every hook,
That claims from us this Valentine—
Accept it pray, O Mary, cook!
For yours it is with constant care,
And well-tried culinary plot,
To furnish me with pluck to bear
(Egeria of the basement grot!)
The rigours of my Lenten fare,
And make me seem to gorge a lot.
You help me through: your art is such
That (granted the correct receipt)
It makes the little like the much,
The plain as toothsome as the sweet;
Your fingers have the fairy's touch,
Whatever size you take in feet.

Interviewed yesterday, Sir HERBERT
BEERDOHM TREE said he was delighted
with his part of the plaice, as it afforded
great opportunities for the display of
varied emotions. A plaice indicates
these by changing the colour of its
spots—a mode of expression not confined
to the chameleon, as is popularly sup-
posed.
A strong part is provided for the
villain, a sinister devil-fish, to be played
by Mr. LYN HARDING.

“She is a dear,” Dahlia whispered to

It was Simpson who saved the situa-
tion and made us merry and bright
again. He hastily trotted out the sugges-
tion that we should tour the country
in the summer, playing cricket in the
day and Bong the Second at night.
Archie backed him up at once.
“Only I'm off Bong Two altogether,”
he said. “Of course, what we want is
a cricket play. We shall have to write
one ourselves, I expect; there aren't any
really good ones about. Act I. : Rupert
Vavasour, a dashing bat and the last
descendant of an ancient but im-
poverished house, is in love with the
beautiful but equally impoverished
Millicent. Milly is being pursued by
a rich villain of the name of Jasper
Fordyce, the said Jasper being a bowler
of extreme swiftness, with a qualification
for Essex. . . . Go on, Simpson.”
“In order to restore the fallen for-
tunes of the house, Rupert plays for
Kent as a professional – Binks (R.)—
and secures talent money in six succes-
sive matches. Jasper hears of it, and
(Act II.) assassinates the scorer; brib-
ing a hireling of his own to take the
deceased's place. In the next match
Rupert only scores 49.”
“Rupert,” continued Thomas, “who
had been counting his own jolly score,
and made it 87, was furious, and deter-
mined at all costs to foil the villain.
Accordingly he went on to bowl in the
next innings and took five wickets for
239, thus obtaining talent money.”
“A little love interest, please, Dahlia,”
said Archie.
“Now the captain, who was in the
secret,” said Dahlia, “was in love with
Rupert's sister, which was why he put
Binks (R) on to bowl. As soon as
Binks had collected his five wickets,
Blythe went on, and took the other five
for three runs. In this way Kent just
managed to win, and so Rupert got
more talent money.”
“The next match was against Essex

and Jasper Fordyce was playing for the
As he put on his spurs
before taking the field, and brushed his
sleek black hair, he smiled sardonically
to himself. Had he not overnight dug
holes in the pitch at the pavilion end,
and was not the wicket fiery, and he
notoriously an erratic bowler?”
“Everything points to Simpson play-
ing Jasper,” I said, and continued.
“‘Heads,’ cried Jasper. It was heads.
“I put you in,’ he remarked calmly.
‘What!' said the other in amazement.
Ten minutes later Binks (R.) and Hum-
phreys were at the wicket. Binks took
first ball with a touch of nervousness at
his heart. All depended on this match. If
only he could make 450 to-day, he would
be able to pay off the mortgage and marry
his Millicent ... “Play.’ Jasper rushed
up to the wicket and delivered the ball.
Then before anybody could see how it
happened, Rupert was stretched full- |
length upon the sward.”
“I had rather thought of playing
Rupert myself,” said Archie. “But I'm ||
not so sure now.” r
“Five for 239,” I reminded him.
“The part was written for you.”
“But what of Millicent?” said Myra.
“Fearing lest some evil should overtake
her lover she had attended the match
clad in a long ulster, and now she flung
it off, revealing the fact that she was in
flannels. With her hair tucked up be-
neath her county cap she looked a slim
and handsome boy. To rush on to the
field and take the injured one's place
was the work of a moment. “Who is
this?’ said the umpires in amazement. ||
“Fear not,’ whispered Millicent to
Humphreys, “I have a birth qualifica-
tion for the county, and the gardener ||
coached me for an hour last night.’” -
“Once more Jasper rushed up to the
crease, and the spectators held their
breath.”
“I’m going to be a spectator,” I said,
“with a breath-holding part. Sorry–
go on, Blair.”
“Then Millicent's bat flashed, and,
behold, the ball was on the boundary !
A torrent of cheers rent the air. Again
he bowled, again the bat flashed. Jasper
ground his teeth.”
“The curtain goes down here to re-
present the passing of an hour. When
it rises again Millicent's score is 423.
- There was dead slence for a
moment. Then Millicent swung her bat.
And at that the cheers broke out, such
cheering as had never been heard before.
Maclaren's record score was beaten at
last ! ‘Now surely he will knock his
wickets down,' said the spectators. Little
did they know that until 450 was upon
the tins the mortgage could not be paid
off 430–440–449—a sharply run
single—450! From the pavilion Rupert
heard the cheers and fainted again.”
“It was “over' and Millicent had the
bowling. Jasper delivered the ball, a
fast half-volley——” -
(“Oh, Simpson simply must play
Jasper.”) -
“— and Millicent drove it back hard
and true. Jasper tried to duck, but it
was too late. He was dead.”
“Act IV. All his mºney went to

married Millicent, and they lived happily
ever after. But, though they are always
to be seen at the Tonbridge and Canter-
bury weeks, they have never played
cricket again . . . Curtain.”
“And bedtime,” said Myra suddenly.
“Good-night everybody.”

LITTLE ARTHUR'S INFLUENZA.
SCENE–A sitting-room; TIME-5 P.M. Little Arthur, heavily
wrapped up, is in an armchair with a clinical thermo-
meter in his mouth. Mamma is attending to him.
Mamma. Arthur, you really mustn't try to talk with that
thing in your mouth. ... I shall never be able to get your
temperature properly if you do. Keep it, well under your
tongue. There, that's better. , Half a minute more, only
half a minute. For Heaven's sake don't cough. You'll bite
on it and break it, and then where shall we be? (Little
Arthur grows purple with the effort of suppressing a cough.)
The child will burst, I know he will. There, that's enough.
She takes out the thermometer and examines it.
Little Arthur. Ough, ouch, wouf, wouf, ouch !
Mamma. If you cough like that, I can't possibly read the
thermometer. Yes, I know you can't help it, poor boy,
but—— Ah, 100. Come, that's better. You were 101 this
And now I'll give
You'll be better off there, and you shall have a nice hot cup
of beef-tea later.
L. A. Mamma.
Mamma. Yes, dear.
L. A. Must I take the medicine 2
Mamma. Of course you must. How do you think you’re
going to get rid of the influenza if you don't take the
medicine? Besides, what will Dr. Pollard say if he finds
you haven't taken his medicine 2 (She pours a dose of pink
medicine into a wine-glass.) There — it's the prettiest
medicine I ever saw.
L. A. It may be pretty to look at, Mamma, but it's the
beastliest medicine I ever tasted.
Mamma. Arthur, that is not a nice way to speak of
Dr. Pollard's medicine. You ought to be thankful to him
for his kindness. Think of all the poor children who can't
have a doctor when they're ill.
L. A. Yes, Mamma, 1 do, and I think they’re very lucky.
But, Mamma. -
Mamma. Well, what is it now 2
L. A. Ought everybody to drink medicine when the doctor
sends it to them 2
Mamma. Of course, everybody ought—that is, if they're
not foolish and wilful.
L. A. Well, I know Papa didn't drink his when he had
his gout three weeks ago—you remember, Mamma, when he
threw a book at Uncle John. It was called The Complete
Golfer, or some name like that, wasn't it, Mamma”
Mamma. The name of the book doesn't matter.
L. A. Doesn't it, Mamma 2 I thought perhaps you'd like
to know, and it might help you to remember.
Mamma. Help me to remember what?
L. A. That Papa didn't drink his medicine. I was sitting
with Papa, and just after Uncle John had gone out quickly,
you came in with the medicine, and you poured it out your-
self, and Papa said he’d be hanged if he'd take any more of
Pollard's filthy stuff. It never did him any good, he said,
and it was bad enough having the gout without having to
ruin your constitution by drinking a mixture that tasted like
the smell of rotten eggs and old cabbage stalks.
Mamma. I'm sure your father never said anything of the
kind.
L. A. Oh, yes, he did, Mamma: he said all that and a good
deal more, too. And when you came up to coax him he
made you give him the glass and the medicine bottle, and he
told me to open the window, and he chucked them out. He
said it was p or man's gout that he had, and he was going
to have a good glass of port that very night; and you know
h was much better the next morning. Do you think Papa
was foolish and wilful, Mamma 2
Mamma. I've told you a hundred times at least that you
mustn't always compare yourself with your father. It's a
very bad habit. Your father s a grown-up man, and you're
a little boy, and that makes all the difference. |
L. A. But you were very angry with Papa. -
Mamma. Yes, and I shall be very angry with you if you
don't drink your medicine quickly. I’ll hold your nose for
you if you like.
L. A. No thank you, Mamma. I think I’ll hold it myself.
But I'm quite sure it won't do me a bit of good. I should
get on much better without it. -
Mamma. I daresay you think so, but you're not fit to
judge in these matters. You know I wouldn't do anything
that wasn't for your good. .
L. A. No, Mamma, but—— *
Mamma. Come, drink it up quick. I can't wait here all
day with a glass of medicine in my hand. (He drinks.)
There s a brave boy. And now I'll read to you for a
quarter of an hour or so.
L. A. Thank you, Mamma, but I don't feel up to it after
the medicine. I think I'll go to bed. *

I failed, and failed by fathoms, to express
My depth of feeling either more or less.
When it had rung its fifty-seventh ring,
That was, I knew, a summons to obey
Or listen to an endless summoning.
I rose in anger; after much delay,
“Are you a pºliceman 2" said the silly thing.
I said, “I am a bard,” and came away.

The Great Play is having a considerable effect upon
fashions. It is true that Messrs. WoRTH have informed The
Daily Telegraph that ladies are unlikely to attempt to rival
Madame SIMONE in the street, which is regrettable in these dull
days; but every hat with a feather in it, even a sham ostrich,
is now called a Chantecler hat.
More than one attempt has been made to give the correct
moral of the play; it may perhaps be summed up in this
advice to those about to take themselves too seriously-

HOW TO SEE HALLEY'S GOMET.
MANY earnest correspondents ask us
to reassure them as to the great Comet's
visibility. They gather from the news-
papers that the “unique celestial dis-
play” will be difficult to find. One old
gentleman says that he was born in
1759, just three days after the comet's
disappearance. He lived with feverish
impatience until 1835, when it was
timed to reappear, and, as luck would
have it, he was the first English victim
of influenza, which kept him on his
back during the whole period of transit.
He did not, however, despair. Since
that date he has taken care of his eye-
sight and bought a pair of spectacles,
only to be filled with misgivings aroused
by the vague predictions which he is
justable to read in the daily press. “Am
I,” he asks pathetically, “to have lived
all these years in vain?”
Another gentleman, writing from
Hampstead, inquires what the London
County Council are doing. If the comet
is to be visible a' Greenwich, why not
at Hampstead? Would it not be more
just to the ratepayers to select without
prejudice some central spot (such as
Parliament Hill) whither all might go
for the occasion?
We hasten to relieve the minds of
both these correspondents. To the first
we may mention that facilities for comet-
seeing have made great strides since
1835, and the pastime is now possible
even for the bedridden if they will go
to the very slight trouble of having a
glass roof made to their house. This
idea occurred to astronomers after the
erection of the Crystal Palace, and has
found great favour with scientific in-
valids. The Hampstead resident will
be glad to hear that the term “visible
at Greenwich" is a quite obsolete techni-
cality. Many years ago it was found
convenient to extend the radius of
observation for the benefit of those
astronomers who, though engaged in
star-gazing at Greenwich all day, had to
get home to dinner in other parts of
London by 8.15. Nowadays most of the
stars which are visible in Greenwich
are also visible in several other suburbs,
including Hampstead. Before long it
is hoped to complete the service by ex-
tending it to Haverstock Hill, Camber-
well, Belgrave Square, Houndsditch, and
the Admiralty.
Another correspondent is more confi-
dent of success in his observations, but
thinks that he might make assurance
doubly sureiſ he had a telescope. “Are they
expensive” he asks. This question is
rather out of our province, but luckily a
paragraph in that enterprising weekly,
The Young Galileo, furnishes an adequate
answer. “Very serviceable telescopes
| can be made out of the cardboard tubes

which are used for packing photo-
graphs. A number of these fitted into
one another and supplied with suitable
lenses will be found, in capable hands,
quite as useful as many of the highly
priced instruments bought by the inex-
perienced.”
The following general directions will
be valued by many other correspondents
with whom we have no space to deal
separately. To find Halley's Comet,
stand so that Mars and Saturn are in a
line running due N.N.E. by E. from the
parallax, and making an angle of 34
degrees with an imaginary line drawn
S.E. by E.S.E. (approximately) from the
Pole Star, Venus or the constellation
of Orion. Taking then the mean distance
between any two of these points and
Greenwich, draw a pentagonal focus-line
directly opposite to the base of observa-
tion. This will give the required
altitude, and the curve of contact will
be instantly apparent. It should be
noted that after 6 A.M. the tangent of
co-ordinated coefficients should be re-
garded as equal to the sum of the
differences of the two equations squared.
“Turnips are very much damaged by being
eaten by hares, and they travel such a distance
that they are difficult to deal with.”—The
Scotsman.
To see the whole field in full cry after a
turnip is one of the most inspiring sights
of Scotland.

INSTEAD of Fowel: "UNDERD, As Is My Share.”
“THE

I've oNly hit 'UN DREE 'UNDERD AN' FIFTEEN TIMEs
THE COMING CREATION.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am rich beyond
the need of further avarice, and from
time to time I have liberally fed the
Party coffers. I should therefore in
the ordinary course of things have a
claim to be one of the few selected for
the rare honour of a Peerage. But if
the Upper Chamber, upon which I have
been careful to direct only modified ridi-
cule, is going to be swamped by the
creation of five hundred outsiders from
the Lord alone knows where, what be-
comes of my well-earned nobility ?
Every new Peer will become a laughing-
stock, without distinction of persons.
Yet I dare not vote in the Commons
against the removal of the veto, lest I
should get into trouble and not be
included even in the five hundred. It
is a rotten dilemma, isn't it?
Yours faithfully, Vox CLAMANTIS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-We all know that
when people have been going about the
country abusing the House of Lords and
the Hereditary System we Liberal Peers
have been regarded, for the purposes of
this attack, as non-existent. But it
seems to me that the time has come for
us to protest against this assumption.
We may be a small and virtuous body,
but we do exist. And, while I love my
Party well enough, I love my Order a
great deal more. Now, if there is any
idea of its being made a laughing-stock
or having its constitutional powers re-
duced to the level of a school debating-
society by the creation of five hundred
new anti-veto Peers, then I give fair
warning that I for one shall be found
voting on the other side, the side to
which our Liberal creations (and with
much less reason) have got into the
habit of drifting. I should like you to
ask my respected leader, Lord CREWE,
what he thinks about it. He wouldn't
tell you what he really thinks, but you
might just ask him.
Yours mutinously ORDER! ORDER!
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Placing my coun-
try's interest before my own, I should
not hesitate, if asked, to become
one of the five hundred. But these
new peerages ought to be heredi-
tary. You see, the custom among both
parties of buying titles tends to make
a new peerage ridiculous; but a brave
man is prepared to put up with that,
because he thinks that by the time his son
inherits his nobility its origin will have
been forgotten. But if he is only made
a Peer for life, he has no such hope to
buoy him up between his creation and
the grave.
Still, as I said, one must think of one's
country first, and for England's sake I
propose to take what I can get.
Yours, in the spirit of sacrifice,
PRO PATRIA.
“It is doubtless the case that, if Tariff Re-
form had been submitted to the people as the
single issue, it would have swept the field. But
the Government, well knowing the deep un-
popularity of Free Trade, were careful to con-
fuse the issue. They complicated it with the
Budget.”—Daily Mail.
Yet there are dear old gentlemen of the
Early Edwardian era, with memories
stretching back to November, 1909, who
can still recall the legend, current at
that time, that the Lords “referred the
Budget to the people”! Yes, the

THE NEW PANGLOSS.
ISEE by the papers, with deep concern,
that my friend X has been run over by
a motor-bus and killed, at the age of
only thirty-eight. I wish I could find
someone who helped to pick him up,
just to see if he said anything about his
end : because—
But I will tell you about him. His
foible was to believe that everything
that happened was for the best—for
himself. Not for mankind; he had
none of the great Dr. Pangloss's satis-
faction that everything that was was
right for everybody, that this is the best
of all possible worlds—none at all;
but he was persuaded that his own
fortunes were being vigilantly and
tirelessly watched by tutelary powers—
that he was, in short, a darling of the
gods.
And in this creed he had grown very
ingenious. I remember once hurrying
with him to catch a train, which, he
said, he must not lose at any cost.
Well, after seriously injuring ourselves
—or at least myself—by running with
a heavy bag, we lost it.
“Never mind,” he said calmly, “I
was evidently intended not to catch it.”
“Then why on earth did you drag me
along at that infernal pace?” I asked.
“Oh, well,” he said “one has to try;
one does not know what fate's game is.”
“What do you think it is ?” I
inquired coldly.
“I expect the train will meet with an
accident; if so, we are well out of it.”
I took the trouble to find out, when
we did at last reach the London station,
if that train had come safely in.
“To the minute,” said the porter.
“There,” I said to my friend, “what
do you make of that?”
“Oh,” he said, “I daresay someone
with an infectious disease had been
sitting in our compartment and we
should have caught it.”
What are you to do with a man who
talks like that ?
Your ordinary fatalist who thinks
that, everything being ordained and
fixed, no effort of his own can matter,
is bad enough ; but the fatalist who
is also an optimist and secure in the
knowledge of his own prosperity is
worse; and yet it was rather fine too.
The hardest rebuffs (as I should call
them) left him smiling.
One day he lost a lot of money in an
investment.
“That's very serious,” I said.
“Not so bad as it might have been,”
he replied. “It was done to teach me
not to speculate. I am not naturally
speculative; I was going against my
genius when I did it. Now I have lost
£500. But if I hadn't I might have
lost £5,000 later on.”

kind of inverted Christianity was at
work had he only known it. But he
prided himself on his paganism.
Well, now he is dead and can find
no extenuating circumstances; but I
have no doubt he would have explained
the catastrophe perfectly, had it been
anything short of fatal.

probably have said, “ and needed rest.

[FEBRUARY 16, 1910.
“UBIQUITY JOHN.”
MR. John BURNs, it has just been
stated by an Essex vicar, last summer
spent some days pea-picking in that
county, in pea-picker's clothes, in order
to inquire into the conditions of that
industry. As is well known, he recently
spent a week-end helping with the Paris
floods. Other narratives of his excur-
sions into the life of the workers during
the past week now reach us from sources
which we have no reason to consider
other than what they are.
MoNDAY.
The Central News informs us that Mr.
John BURNs, wishing to test for himself
the earning capacity of the ordinary
taxi-driver, spent Saturday on the box
of one of these vehicles, beginning at
nine in the morning and continuing
until one a.m. the next day. In an
interview with a C. N. representative he
stated that he had in that time twenty-
eight fares, and took, according to the
meter, 48s. 4d. In tips he received
6s. 9d. Mr. BURNs says that these
figures, he fears, are not typical, being
above the ordinary takings owing to the
fact that he spent only half-an-hour
over his dinner and a quarter-of-an-hour
over his tea, as against the two hours
for dinner and four hours for tea of the
ordinary chauffeur.
TUESDAY.
Not the least interesting figure among
the many forlorn objects who spend the
daylight hours in examining the dust
heaps of Wanstead Flats, picking over
the refuse of London, deposited there
by the dust-carts, to see what can be
retrieved of value, was the sturdy thick-
set figure of Mr. John BURNS, who, try
as he might to disguise himself in rags,
was patently “Ubiquity John” to the
practised eye. On realising that the
game was up, Mr. BURNS readily granted
our representative an interview, and
admitted that he had come, not for what
he could find, but to observe for himself
the conditions under which dust-heap
picking was carried on.
WEDNESDAY.
Acting upon information which recently
reached him as to the social amenities of
Saffron Hill, Mr. JoHN BURNS has just
spent a day of investigation disguised
as an Italian organ-grinder. With
this instrument, his beard carefully
blackened and wearing a heavy som-
brero, Mr. BURNS perambulated many of
the streets of London, both poor and
rich. As the result of twelve hours'
work he is in a position to corroborate
the oft-told tale that the needy are more
generous than the affluent; for whereas
in the wealthier districts, although play-
ing, “Let's All Go Down the Strand,”
“Charley Brown,” and “Boiled Beef
and Carrots,” with the expression of a
maestro, he was warned off, or at most
received a surreptitious penny from cook
or housemaid, in the mean streets (so
called) he reaped a copper harvest. Mr.
BURNS is of opinion that the Italian
organ-grinder has quite as good a time
in London as he ought to have, and no
redress is necessary.
THURSDAY.
Chancing, writes a correspondent, to
have a plague of rats in my warehouse,
I recently engaged a ratcatcher to assist
in ridding me of these pests, and,
descending last night to the cellar to
see what success he was having, I found
him accompanied by an assistant, a
middle-aged, grizzled man, whose zeal
and ability appeared to be commensurate.
What particularly struck me was the
attitude of deference which he seemed
to inspire in the ratcatcher. Judge of
my surprise when I discovered later that
he was no other than Mr. John BURNS,
who was inquiring for himself into the
ratcatching profession in order to be
satisfied that it was carried on with
humanity and skill.
FRIDAY.
Being wishful to learn at first hand
if the reports as to the extraordinary
eloquence of the Billingsgate fish-wives
and other assistants in the fish-market
are true, Mr. John BURNS has just com-
pleted a day's work as a porter at that
place, and the results, he tells a Press
Association interviewer, have transcended
the wildest flights of rumour. “I con-
sidered,” he said, “that I had myself a
fairly useful vocabulary for London
street difficulties; but I now know that
I know nothing. There are ladies here
who could make even DEMOSTHENES look
foolish.”
SATURDAY.
Actuated by a very natural desire to
do all that is humanly possible for the
great band of readers in the British
Museum Reading Room, Mr. BURNS
spent Saturday in that institution, says
a correspondent. He arrived at ten, dis-
guised carefully as an habitual reader.
That is to say, he carried, in direct
defiance of the rules, his lunch in a
newspaper, and had an exceedingly bad
cold. He immediately surrounded him-
self with books, many of which other
readers were seriously needing, and
having erected a huge rampart around
him, he drew forth The Morning Leader
and subsequently fell asleep, awaking
only to sneeze. In this way, varied by
lunch, he remained until closing time,
so successfully escaping recognition that
he had at last to take a reporter into his
confidence. He is satisfied, he says, that
the Reading Room is kept sufficiently
warm, and that, at present at any rate,
no legislative reform is called for. He
thinks, however, that the Rowton Houses
have a distinct case for infringement of
copyright if they care to take it up.
THE SILENCING OHAIR.
It is stated that the new FIRST SEA
LoRD has had removed from his room in
Whitehall all the chairs excepting his
own desk chair, his purpose being the
discouragement of bores.
This seems to us rather hard lines on
those callers who are not bores. A better
way perhaps would have been to fill
the room with chairs, scores of them.
Nothing takes the heart out of a bore
more easily than having to climb over
stacks of chairs before he can get at his
victim. When a welcome visitor ap-
peared at the door, the climbing would
readily be done, of course, by the
Admiral. -
An Editor, whose experience has
been consulted on the matter, writes as
follows:—
“Your idea is sound, but a meat little
thing which we have in our own office
would be better still. It is a cosy chair,
of the kind that a bore would be sure
to make for. Immediately above it is a
handsome piece of plaster ornamentation
in the ceiling, which nobody would
suspect to be the exit of a cistern.
When the bore becomes troublesome,
the manipulation of a small lever under
the desk sets the shower-bath to work.
If the bore persists, another lever will
close the arms of the chair across the
occupant's body and lower a hood over
his head, and by the pressure of a small
pedal the door can be opened auto-
matically and the chair and contents
shot out and down a few of the stairs
until it stops. The chair is strongly
made for its arduous work, and its cover
is waterproof. Any - water that may
miss the bore and fall on the floor runs
away through a grating underneath. ,
This really useful scheme of furniture
is supplied by the Last Word Office-Fur-
nishing Company. We used to have one
of their chloroform sprays which, while
effectually silencing the bore, did not
remove him; and this meant a lot of
heavy work for the hall-porter. We
also tried a trap-door arrangement which
let the bores through the floor; but the
disadvantage of this is that one so easily
forgets to release them when leaving
for the night. As a matter of history
there are two down there now who were
unfortunately overlooked.
No, the Silencing Chair is the best
thing we have come across yet, and we
recommend it to Sir ARTHUR WILSON as
preferable to his ingenious plan.”

HALOLOGY.
DR. TALMAGE DoREN, lecturing at Nor-

in The Daily Telegraph of Feb. 8),
stated thatevery human being is equipped
with an aura or halo radiating from his
body for two or three feet and usually
drab in colour. Sadness, however, may
cause a purple halo, jealousy a green,
and anger a red appearance. The aurae,
he says, are so powerful that two
persons with ill-matched ones cannot sit
beside each other comfortably in a rail-
way carriage or associate in married
liſe.
This being the case, Mr. Punch, ever
anxious to benefit humanity and smooth
things over, has started a Halo Registry

on his books:–

invite Tenders for the repair of various

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE followed STANLEY PortAL HYATT across the wild
places of the earth, on perilous expeditions through the
hinterland of Portuguese East Africa, in guerilla warfare
with the Filippinos, at carrier-work with a Rhodesian trans-
port-rider, and have found him possessed of high gifts of
observation and a most effective manner of telling a story
simply and vividly. From his Marcus Hay, The Little
Brown Brother, and The Marriage of Hilary Carden I
derived great profit. But he is a writer who has little profit—
for me, at any rate—when he is in his own country or among
his own people unless they are at the other end of the world.
In more than one of his previous books I had suspected,
from such glimpses as they offered of English society, that
he was much more at home in exotic surroundings. And
his new novel, Black Sheep (LAURIE), which is confined to
certain phases of purely English life, endorses these
suspicions. I should not cavil at the almost uniform dulness
and sordid provincialism of its characters if only they lived
But on the whole they talk too much
To suit my humble liking.
Some of them marry, some do not,
But neither consummation
Achieves itself without a lot
Of verbal explanation.
In fact—and here I speak as one
No stranger to reviewing—
I never knew so little done
With such a deal of Dewing.
There are two things about A Will in a Well (STANLEY
PAUL) that have rather perplexed me. First, I should like to
ask E. EveRETT GREEN whether a bride really would wear
white satin and a veil when being married privately in a
London flat. The second point is this: when Val Acryngton
and the boy Bosh, having tracked the villains to the Savoy, seat
themselves beside them “at the small table set for four,” and
presently thereafter are bidden to share a box at the Gaiety,
I cannot help feeling that they found the patrons of that
in an atmosphere of reality.
hotel in a mood more gre-
But from the first we are
asked to accept an improb-
able hypothesis — that the
relations of Jimmy Grierson
(I don't know why the
author should have chosen
to give his “black sheep”
the well-known name of a
distinguished officer com-
manding a division at Alder-
shot) would, on his return
after ten years' knocking
about the world, have wanted
to treat him like an ado-

own experience. Still, these
are small points, and it
would be ungenerous to fix
upon two incidents in a story
that supplies them with so
lavish a hand. A peer, a
persecuted heroine, two dis-
puted successions, a rascally
lawyer, and a hypnotic ab-
duction, all compressed into
three hundred pages of large
print, is at least liberal
measure. Added to which,
the resulting tale is itself an

ably well told. It is far too

Dead Soul, under the tragic -

which recalls his treatment of the woman at Beira in his
Marcus Hay. But his virtuous types are commonplace.
The fact is that it takes more skill to give freshness and
vitality to familiar things than to reproduce conditions
which have a freshness and a vitality of their own. Let
me therefore implore Mr. HYATT to pack up again and go
far afield for his themes, in search of the colour and move-
ment of new worlds. Frankly he is not yet so complete a
master of literary style that he can afford to choose his
material just anywhere.

founded and beauty victorious. It is all capital fun,
though I think the title might be improved upon; it makes
it just a little difficult to be properly astonished at the end.
The Truth About Solomon.
“Nethersole was Solomon reincarcerated. When two mothers both
laid claim to Quong Yuen, and a father, three sisters and eight cousins
failed to settle the dispute, Miss Nethersole whispered in Judge
Murasky's ear that the elder woman was the real mother because the
other bulldosed too much.”—Vancouver World.
Those were SolomoN's very words, you remember.
Mr. R. H. PARR, opening a Unionist Club at Bristol, is
reported by The Bristol Times and Mirror to have said:
‘Weekly meetings would be held at that club, and no pains would be
taken to keep interest alive in that district (hear, hear).”
But this is quite the wrong spirit.

A FABLE OF THE CRISIS.
“There was a young lady of Riga.”
0'd Limerick.
[Efforts have been made by some of the
Liberal Press to put a gloss upon the luncheon
given last week to Mr. Joli N REDMOND and other
Nationalists by the CHANCELLOR at his official
residence. The Daily Chronicle expresses a
doubt as to whether “he saw the Irish leaders
on that occasion at all,” while The Westminster
Gazette speaks of Mr. It EDMoND as having
“waited on ” the author of the Budget.]
THERE is a legend, freely sung
Where Limerick harpers sit at mess,
About a Lady, sadly young,
And Riga was her home address.
Great nerve she had and knew the game
Of handling large and savage brutes;
Even the Tiger, turning tame,
Would wait on her and lick her boots.
(These cats, you say, affect the East,
And Riga sounds too cold by far?
I know ; but this peculiar beast
Was not as other tigers are.)
One day, when lunching off the grill,
She tos. ed him many a tasty snack,
And not a hitch occurred until
She started riding on his back.
In what direction went the twain;
Whether the brute obeyed her whim,
Or, feeling shaky, she was fain
To leave the choice of route to him;-
Whether he galloped lithe and gay,
Or trickled at a funeral trot,
I should not hesitate to say
Were I aware, but I am not.
One thing is certain : human sight
Failed at the rest, but this is known-
That, when the Tiger, late at night,
Came padding back, he came alone;
Alone, that is, to outward view,
But purring softly all the while,
His tummy big enough for two,
And on his face a fat, fat smile.

“When Big Ben boomed out the hour of two

resenbled much more closely.

The nearest underground station to
Westminster is Westminster.
You should see that your letters are
addressed to “House of Commons, Op-
posite Underground Station,” and not to
“Near Pimlico.”
The large building opposite the Houses
of Parliament is St. Thomas's Hospital.
The large building opposite St. Thomas's
Hospital is the Houses of Parliament.
The seat you secure on the first day
will be yours for the Session. There
are no early doors and it is not permissi-
ble to have your place in the queue or
your seat in the House reserved for you
by a messenger boy, unless he be a duly
elected Member of Parliament.
Of the six hundred and seventy
recent elections your own has been by
far the most important and the most to
be talked about. Do not be led to
think otherwise by the conceited re-
marks of other Members.
If you have been committing burglaries
on the strength of the M.P.'s privilege
of freedom from arrest for forty days
before and after the meeting of Parlia-
ment, you will be disappointed to learn
that that privilege does not extend to
indictable offences.
It is a tradition of the House that all
Members know each other without an
introduction. Of course, everybody else
will know you, but you must also appear
to know everybody else.
Thus, if you cannot avoid conversation
with a mere Labour man, salve your
pride by regarding yourself as a
philanthropist taking a kindly interest
in the well-being of the lower classes.
Possibly your chief object in putting
up for one of the best clubs in London
was that you might be thrown into the
society of Mr. Victor GRAYSON. We
regret to have to announce that that
gentleman has decided to sever his con-
nection with the House. It is said
that in coming to this decision he was
largely influenced by the expressed
opinion of his electorate.
II. –PARTICULAR INFORMATION.
(1) For Members of the Majority.
However much you dislike the food
provided for you by the Kitchen Com-
mittee, your chief expects you to refrain
from making any complaint. Remember
that you have pledged yourself to oppose
any attempt at Tariff Reſorm.
You are further expected to enter the
House by the Free Tradesmen's entrance
only. —
Mr. Asquith solicits the favour of your
vote on all divisions, but finds himself
unable to fetch you to record your vote
in a motor. --
Remember that at critical moments
of high policy Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL
has a great deal of complicated thinking
to do. He must consider the interests
of the Government as opposed to those
of the Opposition; the interests of him-
self and Mr. Lloyd GEORGE as opposed
to those of the Government; the interests
of himself as opposed to those of Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE. Any remarks you may
desire to make to him upon the struc-
tural merits or demerits of the House,
its upholstery or heating apparatus,
should be postponed.
In 1772 a Bill was rejected, thrown
over the Table by the SPEAKER, and
kicked out of the House by the Mem-
bers, because it had been returned from
the Lords with an amendment to a
money clause. Be sure always to have
a pair of football boots and an old suit
ready to don at a moment's notice.
Temperance advocates among you
will be glad to learn that there is no
Off-licence and no Bottle and Jug
Department attaching to the Bar of the
House of Commons.
In demolishing the House of Lords,
please be careful not to hurt the char-
women and other members of the staff,
whom necessity, and not the inherent
viciousness of aristocratic birtli, brings
upon the premises.
(2) For Nationalists only.
In making yourself comfortable in
the quarters specially reserved for you
at Westminster, do not forget that your
main object in life is to cut yourself off
from the place for ever.
“The Bishop of Bristol was the sole occupant
of the Episcopal Bench. He, having said
prayers, stayed for the event of the day. The
other Lords just looked in, swore, and went out
again.”—Irish Times.
We think the Prelate should have made
some protest.

NEVER a whine escaped me, not a whimper
Through all those weeks of weariness and fuss,
When every morning found the lyre grow limper,
As LLoyd said this and CHURCHILL laboured thus.
Who heeded songs meanwhile? What oats had Pega-

Here were the papers stripped of half their glory,
The subjects which delight the Muse and me;
What do we care for Liberal or for Tory
So we preserve a Press that's fancy free,
Ranging the whole wide world (through REUTER's agency)?
The sun was blotted out with facts and figures,
And through the darkness, desolate, opaque,
Perspiring rhetoricians toiled like niggers
As though some solid issue were at stake.
Poor innocents! And yet I neither moved nor spake.
And now, as when the last straw comes and smashes
The overburdened dromedary's spine,
: They hint at more elections. Dust and ashes!
Am I to take this tyranny supine *
Is there no end to politics, no anodyne?
Must I again be numbered with the readers
Of awful economic rigmaroles 2
Admire the spectacle of party leaders
For ever climbing up their slippery polls?
And hear the “Last Results” sound forth like funeral

If it be so, then, Ministers, take warning!

Out I shall go (accomplices suborning)
And wreck the panes in Downing Street, and squall,

Gloomy Outlook in U.S.A.
There are times when one despairs of the American's sense
of humour—not his own humour, of course, but other people's.
Here is The Outlook, of New York, whose “Contributory
Editor” is no less a man than the great TEDDY himself, re-
printing (without acknowledgment) a large slab of Mr.
Punch's recent burlesque of Mr. MAURICE HEwlFTT's Election
Manifesto, under the impression that it has got hold of the
original. If all British humour is to be taken like this,
aw grand sérieux, we can understand the cause of some of
those misapprehensions which are popularly encouraged over
there in regard to this admirable commodity. Fortunately
The New York Sun, less because it loves Punch than because
it has its own private quarrel with The Outlook, has exposed
the latter organ of culture as having liſted, in ignorance of
the nature of its swag, “the delightful imitation of Hew-
lettian precocity published by the London Punch.” So
we'll leave it at that.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MATTERS OF CRAWE IMPORTANGE.
[We greatly regret to announce that the
mind of our Special Correspondent Behind the
Scenes has become unhinged by the stress of
1ecent events, and that he is evidently obsessed
with the idea (among others) that Punch is a
daily paper. At any rate, he has been sending
us veracious reports each day from Downing
Street of an extremely topical mature; reports
which, when collected at the end of the week
into volume form, necessarily lose much of
their apparent veracity. Still, even so they
seem to us to be at least as readable as the best
efforts of rival correspondents.-Ed. Punch.]
Monday.—The situation has now be-
come very tense.
The question of Budget or Veto first
is still exercising the minds of Ministers
to the exclusion of all other matters. At
this moment, therefore, it may not be
out of place to recall the words of Mr.
ASQUITH at the Albert Hall, at the end of
last year. Mr. Asquith said:—
“We shall not hold safeguards, neither
shall we assume safeguards, until we
have received the experience which Par-
liament shows to be necessary in the
office of a single lifetime.”
Remembering these words, and the
further pledge of the PRIME MINISTER to
retropose reimspectively all the taxes
without a single comma as from this time
forward, we have no hesitation in saying
that the policy of the Government may
be summed up in two words : —
BUDGETOE FIRST.
Tuesday.—Mr. Asquith had a busy
day yesterday. His time-table was as
follows:—
11.30 Meeting of the Cabinet.
12.30 Audience of the KING.
3.30 Meeting of the Cabinet.
5.0 Second audience of His MAJESTY.
6.0 Meeting of the Cabinet.
7.0 l'eceives Mr. REDMOND.
8.0 Meeting of the Cabinet.
9.0 Receives Mr. BARNEs.
10.0 Meeting of the Cabinet.
11.0 Receives Mr. BELLoc.
12.0 Final meeting of the Cabinet.
One of the first to arrive at 10, Down-
ing Street, was Mr. J. A. PEASE, the new
Chancellor of the Duchy. He reports
that the Duchy is looking extremely
well after the recent rain, and says that
he quite expects to like the life.
It is now generally agreed that the
situation has lightened considerably,
and attention is called pretty generally
to the words of Mr. ASQUITH before the
dissolution of the last Parliament. It
may be as well to set them down here:
“We shall not assume experience
neither shall the will of the elected safe-
guards prevail until we have shown
Parliament the single office which a
Wednesday.—As we announced yester-
day the policy of “VEDGEdo FIRST, THEN
TEEBIV "is rapidly gaining ground, and
it is felt that unless Mr. Asquith is pre-
pared to sacrifice his own inclinations
to this end his hand may be forced.
His own view of the situation was
different, as will be remembered if we
recall his famous declaration at the
Albert Hall:—
“We shall not hold lifetimes, neither
shall we experience lifetimes, until we
have elected Parliaments within the
limits of a single safeguard which
necessity shows to be assumed.”
Yesterday's diary was as follows:—
12.0 Mr. Asquith receives Mr.
PéLIssier.
1.30 Mr. W. O'BRIEN dissolves Par-
liament.
2.30 Mr. REDMOND receives Mr. T. P.
O'Cox'Nor.
4.0 Mr. GARVIN dissolves Parlia-
ment.
5.30 Mr. BYLES receives Mr. BELLOC.
6.0 Mr. HAROLD Cox dissolves Par-
liament.
(N.B.--Cabinet Councils every half-
hour. Refreshments provided.)
TIDGEBow FiRST.
Thursday.—The situation has sud-
denly taken a startling turn. A brief
synopsis of yesterday's happenings will
best show the course which events are
taking; but in view of the exceptional
nature of the crisis it is well to restate
first Mr. Asquith's pledge as given by
him at the Albert Hall towards the end
of 1909:—
“We shall not assume lifeguards,
neither shall we, hold lifeguards, until
we have received those limits within the
experience of a single safetime which
Parliament shows to be elected.”
(Cabinet Councils every three minutes.
Season tickets must be shown on demand.)
100 Mr. REDMOND reaches Downing
Street.
10.5 Mr. Asquitli produces gua-
rantees.
10.6 Mr. Asquith produces safe-
guards.
10.7 Mr. REDMOND leaves Downing
Street.
11.0 Mr. REDMOND calls on Mr.
O'CoNNort.
11.1 Mr. REDMOND shows safeguards
to Mr. O'Connor.
11.2. Mr. REDMOND shows guarantees
to Mr. O'Connon.
12.0 Mr. O'CoxNon calls on Mr.
BARNEs.
12.1 Mr. O'Connor shows guarantees
to Mr. BARNEs.
12.2 Mr. O'CoxNor shows safeguards
1.2 Mr. BARNEs shows guarantees to
Mr. BYLEs.
1.3 Mr. BARNEs shows safeguards
to Mr. BELLoc.
2.0 Messrs. REDMoND, O'Connor,
BARNEs, BYLES, BELLOC, and
Pélissieſt call on Mr. ASQUITH.
3.0 Wedgebo First.
Friday.—The situation is now at its
tensest. All depends on Mr. CLAUDE
HAY. Mr. HALDANE's pledge not to re-
main single within the lifetime of an
elected Parliament is generally thought
to have little bearing on the situation.
Mr. HAROLD Cox called on Mr. Pélissier
at an early hour yesterday. Mr. Pélissieſt
subsequently left for Paris. The Seine is
reported to have risen again. The Chi AN-
CELLOR of The DUCHY declared war on
Ireland at 3 P.M. and the Duchy's fleet
sailed for Dublin. Mr. W. O'BRIEN
called on Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER to
enquire after his new trouser-press.
Lord Roberts called at Downing St. to
inspect the Royal Safeguards (The Blues).
BUDGEdo FIRSt.
Saturday.—We are in a position to
announce that a settlement has at length
been arrived at, and that all the rumours
of the past week may be dismissed as
wholly unauthorised. By an arrange-
ment come to between Messrs. Asquith,
BALFotR, REDMOND, BARNES, O'BRIEN,
O'ConxoR, BYLEs, BELLoc, HAY, PéLis-
sieſt, ALEXANDER and Cox, the following
sequence of events will be observed in
Parliament next week :--
. King's Speech.
. Address.
Budgetoe.
Weebidge.
Todgebit.
. Safeguards.
. Chaos.
. Vidgebodge.
Gobo.
10. Limits.
That this is the most satisfactory way
out of the impasse will be generally
admitted, even by the most violent
partisan; it will be admitted also that
Mr. Asquith has shown great tact in
dealing with the situation. And now
that the crisis has at last been overcome
there will be many who will not fail to
recall the memorable words of the PRIME
MINISTER at the Albert Hall in the closing
days of the old year:—
“We shall not guard safes, neither
shall we assume small holdings without
limiting side-shows within the experi-
ence of a single comma.” A. A. M.
From a lecture on the Irish drama :-
“Monarchy is really a painted wooden figure-
head, which reached the zenith of its splendour

This is now taken to mean

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
meaning of the colour-changes.
REMARKABLE MARTIAN
OBSERVATIONS.
[Whilst the British Press has been making
special reference to Professor Lowell's dis-
covery of a new canal in Mars, it is remarkable
that this extract from The Martian Astronomical
Times has not been quoted by a single British
paper.]
SUMMARY of Professor Zzchoote's
special observations on the curious
variations in colour of the One Moon
Star.
At an early period in this year, careful
observers noticed that the colours of the
portion of the star under observation
showed a tendency to alter. The strong
red which was characteristic of the bulk
of the area began to alternate violently
with blue. The most plausible expla–
nation of these colour-changes is that
they are caused by violent ebullitions of
gas. Advocates, however, of the inter-
esting theory that the One Moon Star
possesses inhabitants assert that the
colourings are produced by human
energy. Gradually the blue colouring
covered a larger portion of the surface,
though towards the north, near the polar
cap, the red colouring seemed excep-
tionally persistent.
For the moment the changes appear
to have ceased, and now the visible area
of the One Moon Star is almost equally
divided between red and blue, though
on one side there is a patch of bright
green colouring. According to the
keenest observers, there has been a ten-
dency on the part of the red gas to
amalgamate with the green. It is quite
possible, alleges Professor Zzchoote, that
such a chemical combination may result
in an awful explosion, which may sepa-
rate entirely the area held by the green
from that occupied by the other colours.
Amongst scientists who adopt the
theory that the One Moon Star is
inhabited opinion is divided as to the
One
section argues that the red area, being
situated nearer the polar cap, is the
scene of the keenest struggle for ex-
istence, and that its inhabitants must
therefore be more intelligent. There-
fore they conclude that the encroachment
of the blue on the red is a sign of a suc-
cessful inroad by savage barbarians.
On the other hand, other scientists
argue that the colder climate and
constant rainfall of the northern area
must be absolutely inimical to the
growth of civilization. Hence any spread
of the blue at the expense of the red
indicates that the area of civilization is
extending in the One Moon Star.
Professor Zzchoote, though declining
to commit himself to any definite opinion
on these points, declares that he antici-
pates more remarkable developments on
the One Moon Star at an early date. It
is impossible that the various floating
gases can continue in their present
condition. Either a peaceful amalgama-
tion or an explosion must take place.
He notes further that the curious
groove on the surface of the One Moon
Star, which has only appeared at intervals
for the last fifteen years, is once more
visible. It will be remembered that
the Professor very happily named this
groove “The Lonely Furrow.”
THE DULNESS OF DOWNING STRRET.
THE extremely prosaic character (duly
reported in the Press) of the scene
in Downing Street on the arrival of
Ministers to attend the recent series
of Cabinet meetings, suggests that
something might be done to reward
the patience of the usual crowd by in-
creasing the interest of these occasions.
This could easily be done if Cabinet
Ministers would use a little imagination,
incidentally furnishing the Press with
light material of the following order:—
Looking very fit in his smart running
pants, the PRIME MINISTER, who had left
Windsor four hours earlier and followed
the Marathon route, was seen rounding
the corner into Downing Street just as
Big Ben was striking three. Great
crowds cheered the fine sprint which
terminated a splendidly-sustained effort.
At 3.5 the CHANCELLOR, who had
come up after spending the week-end
in Carnarvon, arrived over No. 10 in
his well-known dirigible, “Belle of
Blaenau Festiniog,” and, descending by
parachute to the level of the street,
passed through the man-hole, and so
gained entrance to the Cabinet chamber.
The next familiar figure to be seen
was that of Lord CREWE, who arrived in
a wheelbarrow, propelled by another
member of the doomed House.
The IRIsh SECRETARY followed, amid
loud cheers, in a well-equipped jaunting-
car, followed by a taxi in which Mr.
CHURCHILL figured at the driving-wheel.
Interest deepened when it was observed
that the chauffeur was seated inside.
“It occurred to me,” remarked the
ex-PRESIDENT of THE BOARD of TRADE to a
Kodak-operator, “ that on the way here
the man and I might very well make a
labour exchange.”
“Dr. Hinckley, who is well known from his
astronomical observations, dwelt on the planet
Mars.”—Meriden (Conn.) Record.
There you are, that settles it. His
reminiscences of how he fell into a canal
when a small boy will be of extra-
ordinary interest.
“Visitors are sometimes concerned about the
spelling of the name of this station. 'Moul-
mein,' 'Moulmein,’ ‘Moulmein’ and, rarely,
‘Moulmein.'”—Rangoon Gazette.
Of the four we prefer “Moulmein.”
HOME ADVERTISING.
[“Mr. D. Stewart Dawson said he too owed his
success to advertising. He could tell stories
about advertising that would electrify them
and induce each one of them to go home and
advertise.”—Westminster Gazette.]
REGGIE perused the above, and after
a moment's quiet reflection went softly
from the room and up-tairs into his
father's study. The study was the
place where Reggie's father read the
paper or gently slept when he was not
busy at golf. Just now he was up to
his neck in golf, so Regaie turned the
key of the door, gathered together a
bundle of newspapers and some large |
sheets of white paper, and set to work.
By a piece of great good for, une there
was red ink in the ink-pot marked
“Red,” besides a blue pencil and black
ink, a dried-up paste-brush, and a small
amel's-hair brush which his father kept
for painting his throat when the golf
had tried it too severely.
Parts of the advertisements he copied
from the newspapers; parts were the
creation of his own brain. They made
a brave show when he had thoroughly |
inned them to the backs of the books
n the shelves. When Reggie's father,
feeling very comfortable, entered his
study after dinner, he suddenly stopped i
humming to himself, took the cigar
from his mouth, and said he was—what
we venture to hope he never will be.
Here are some of the advertisements:–

MATERNAL cAREs.
“Dolly, Do You KNow I AM sometimes ALMost TEMPTED To wish YoU HAD NEVER BEEN Born ?”
THE UNIVERSAL CRITIC.
A CoRRESPONDENT of The Northern
Tribune has been complaining that the
reports of weddings are so much alike
that they ought not to be printed in
extenso at all. Perhaps he would prefer
criticism. We offer two examples for
him to choose from.
I. THE BLAND.
A successful and crowded wedding
was held yesterday at St. Julien's
Church, when Mr. Gabriel Santander
and Miss Esther MacNiven were well
married by the Rev. Aloysius Pond.
The church had been decorated with
skill and judgment, although possibly
the note of red was a little too prominent.
The bride, who was supported by a
very capable bevy of young ladies, wore
a white satin dress, on which no pains
had been spared, and the bridegroom
charmed everyone by his manly bearing
and “he excellence of his frock coat. He
spoke a.a lines with perfect enunciation,
ºtherein setting an example to the bride,
who was not, we regret to say, distinctly
audible in every part of the church, and
had she been a public speaker would no
doubt have been adjured to be more dis-
tinct. In a wedding, however, whether
rightly or wrongly, it is agreed that these
little defects may be overlooked.
The clergyman's sermon was a sterling
if somewhat hackneyed effort; but, after
all, what is there new to say? Save for
two or three rather feeble passages here
and there we have nothing but praise
for the organist's rendering of the
Lohengrin “Wedding March,” while
the quality of the confetti thrown at the
happy couple seemed to us of the best.
II. THE EXACTING.
We have been present at many
weddings in our time, but never at a
more disappointing function than that
which we saw yesterday at St. Peter's
Church. To begin with, the bride was
late, an unpardonable error—so late,
indeed, that the bridegroom was only
too patently fearful that something seri-
ous had happened, although why a
man should fret at having his married
life abbreviated we cannot understand.
Then, when the lady did arrive, she was
observed to be in a state of nervousness
highly unbecoming to herself and highly
unflattering to her future husband. Her
veil was awry, and, to add to her mis-
fortunes, her clumsy fool of a father trod
on her dress and tore it. The brides-
maids were an ordinary-looking lot, and
whoever designed their costumes ought
to know better.
The bridegroom did his best to carry
off the ceremony with éclat, but he was
in poor voice and his difficu ties with
the ring were unceasing. The bride
was discovered to have no voice at all;
but the easy-going clergyman was evi-
dently satisfied with her whispers, for
he pronounced them man and wife amid
perfect silence on the part of the audi-
ence, and the event was over. We came
away convinced that a few more re-
hearsals would have made a wonderful
difference.
Lord RosebERY as reported in The
Manchester Guardian:—
“I sometimes venture to winder in the
audacious moment of soliture—and perhaps you
will allow me to consider the present as one of
those.”
By all means.

Who means to be rich by investing in Rubber.
Each morn with my letters I go to my lair,
And peruse every glowing prospectus with care.
They have all got their buildings, their trees and their labour,
And each gives a better report than its neighbour.
“Walk up and walk in and you'll all be content
With your twenty or thirty or forty per cent.' "-
That's the sense I collect from the rub-a-dub-dubber
Whose drum sounds the rapturous glories of Rubber.
There's a proverb I heard as an innocent child
Which warns you of cats ferae nat. (when they're wild).
No matter; I'll scrape up a thousand or two
And invest them in trees in Brazil or Peru.
To neglect such a chance is the part of a dunce;
I intend to be rich, and I'll be it at once;
For my trees, as a whale makes you rich with his blubber,
Shall provide me with millions by yielding their Rubber.

gredients neither sand nor sawdust plays any part at all–
not even so much as a walking part.

THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FRow the DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, Feb. 15.
—Was it a blush on ingenuous counten-
ance, or was it merely the tan on the
sensitive cheek one brings home at this
time of the year after brief sojourn on
the sunny Riviera? Difference of opinion
remains unsettled. Certainly when
PREMIER entered just now from behind
SPEAKER's Chair the rousing cheer from
crowded benches of faithful followers
that hailed his coming brought flush to
his cheek.
A minute later cheer taken up from
other side as PRINCE ARTHUR lounged in
with that air of studious casualness he
preserves for these occasions. Happen-
ing to be passing by thought he might
as well look in. And here he is, his
white locks a never-ceasing surprise to
us who remember him as far back as
Fourth Party days. Makes no sign of
recognition of the gladsome shout of
welcome. Cannot fail to recognise in it
the loudest that for full four years has
greeted his ear on entering House. The
camp where his friends gather, a Deserted
Village in the last Parliament, now holds
a teeming population, glad they are alive
and safely seated.
No SPEAKER in the Chair, for, like the
Spanish fleet on a memorable occasion,
he is not yet in sight. No Mace on the
Table. Presently enters BLACK RoD, a
vision in courtly garb that awes new
Members who have never looked on the
like before. At times when House is
fully constituted, with SPEAKER en-
throned, BLAck Rod advances to table
with carefully counted steps, thrice
making low obeisance. This afternoon,
his goal a Maceless Table, an empty
Chair, he with nice discrimination bows
only once as he crosses the Bar.
Brings a summons to this “honourable
House immediately to attend the House
of Peers to hear the King's Commission
read.” The Clerk of the House, like
Cophetua with a difference, steps down
in wig and gown and leads the way.
The PREMIER promptly follows. Finding
himself alone, he looks shyly round and,
seeing PRINCE ARTHUR, awaits his coming.
So they walk out, side by side, in friendly
converse, as if the General Election had
vanished like a frigid nightmare, or as
if all the hard words spoken had been
calculated benisons.
After brief interval flock of Members
who followed their Leaders to Bar of
House of Lords stream back again. They
have received instructions to “repair to
the place where you are to sit and there
proceed to the choice of some proper
person to be your Speaker.” “Some
proper person,” forsooth ! “Repair to
the House where you are to sit,” quotha.
In the phrase is uncanny echo of the
“So they walk out, side by side.”
Asquith. “Well, my dear Arthur, this is better than climbing up those confounded ladders,
anyhow !”
Arthur B. “Yes; but there's no telling how soon we shall be on 'em again, that's the
worst of it !”
formula occasionally heard in criminal
courts of justice, where the prisoner in
the dock is ordered to “return to the
place whence you came” as a prelimi-
nary to being “hanged by the neck till
you are dead.”
However, DoN'T KEIR HARDIE says we'll
change all that by-and-by.
The Resolution “that the Right Hon.
JAMES WILLIAM Low THER do take the
Chair in this House as Speaker” com-
mitted to charge of PAPA BURT, who,
somewhat late in life, finds himself
Father of a family 669 strong. A little
embarrassed with sudden situation and
unwonted responsibility. A proud posi-
tion for the pit-boy of sixty years ago to
be hailed Father of the House of Com-
mons, its honoured spokesman in pro-
posing the election of the SPEAKER.
Embarrassment only temporary. PAPA
BURT, content to be himself (than who
there is no better chap), delivered speech
that had the charm of earnestness, the
winsomeness of simplicity.
By flash of dramatic instinct, PRINCE
ARTHUR “presented” HARRY CHAILIN to
second the motion. Inmpossible to con-
ceive a wider difference in individuality,
honourable to both, than here came to
the front. Strikingly illustrative of the
universality of the House and the rigidity
of its democratic principle of the equality
of man when duly elected M.P.
Murmur greeted one sentence of the
ex-Squire of Blankney's speech.
“I am confident,” he said, “I shall
have the support of every single gentle-
man who is present in the House to-day”
in extolling the SPEAKER-lect.

t
Why this invidious distinction? Why
should married men be ostentatiously
excluded from the computation ? Per-
haps nothing meant. Nevertheless it
rather chilled enthusiasm for the moment.
Welled forth again when Mr. Lowther,
Dick Whittington of the Parliamentary
story, thrice Speaker of the House of
Commons, returned to his old familiar
place.
Business done—SPEAKER elected.
Wednesday.—Process of swearing-in
Members occupied sitting. A dull per-
formance, growing in weariness as
the hours passed and resembled each
other. At four o'clock it seemed feebly
dying out. There were not more than
half-a-dozen Members waiting their
turn. Suddenly there was quickened
movement at the Table where the Clerks
sat. One rose, and approaching Sir
CourtENAY ILBERT, who stood by the brass-
bound box administering the Oath and
overlooking Members as they signed the
roll of Parliament, made whispered com-
munication.
At this moment there slowly emerged
from behind SPEAKER's Chair a bent
figure leaning on the arm of SoN
AustEN, in his left hand a
stick, behind him Lord
MoRPETH, newly appointed
Whip of a non-existent
Party long ago merged in
the ranks of Toryism. Mur-
mured conversation among
the few Members present
abruptly hushed, when,
looking up, they beheld
what seemed the wraith of
the once foremost, fiercest
fighter in the Parliamen-
tary lists.
It was, in truth, DON
José come to sign his name
(or see it signed for him)
on the roll of the new Par-
liament to which he had
been triumphantly elected.
Painfully pacing the pas-
sage between Table and
Treasury Bench, he by
chance dropped into the
scat next to that usually
occupied by the Leader of
the House. Time was when
he was accustomed at criti-
cal epochs to rise thence
from the side of GLADSTONE
and break the serried ranks
of Conservative Opposi-
tion with irresistible dash.
Later, from the same place,
he leaped to his feet amid
thunderous cheers from
Conservative colleagues to
prod old political friends
with remorseless lance.

circumstances, he dominated
House.
Now he sat there whispering the
words of the Oath recited to him by the
Clerk, touching with trembling pen the
signature another wrote for him on the
roll of Parliament. This done, he slowly
a crowded
position, under whatsoever by a visit to “The Follies" at the Apollo Theatre.]
Go AND SEE ‘The Follies.'”
With acknowledgments to the talented designer of the famous poster.
[On Thursday night Mr. Asquith attempted to shake off the cares of state
passed out, and the curtain fell upon the
most pathetic scene witnessed on the
Parliamentary stage within the memory
of living man.
Business dome—Members sworn in.
Thursday.—Every one glad to see the
BROTHERS WASON back again. Pleasure
furtively increased by observation that
during General Election neither has
added a cubit to his stature. As their
united heights aggregate 14 feet 9 inches,
and their weight brings the scale down
at 26 stone 5 pounds per brother, such
unearned increment would be super-
fluous. But when a habit is formed
one never knows when it may not sud-
denly assert itself.
Their good nature, kindness of heart,
and popularity on both sides of House
are equal to these manly proportions.
A little incident, perhaps not known
outside House, dwelt upon with pleased
reflection by old Members, is charac-
teristic of their consideration for
others. When CATHCART was returned
for Orkney ten years ago, BROTHER
EUGENE was already seated as Liberal
Member for Clackmannan. Obvious
danger of overdoing things if both
sat on same side. House
might heel over, like ship
whose cargo had shifted
to starboard or to larboard.
Accordingly CATHCART took
his seat on Unionist side,
almost exactly balancing
EUGENE on t'other.
After a while, having
made cautious experi-
ments, they discovered that
their fears were illusory,
and CATHCART crossed over
to join his brother. Takes
same position in new Par-
liament.
SARK had some uneasy
moments previous to open-
ing of campaign in Orkney.
It was rumoured that
LUGENE, triumphantly re-
elected at Clackmannan,
was going North to help
his brother. As SARK said,
in such case the little island
would forthwith have been
proclaimed as a Congested
District.
Happily idea was aban-
doned. Clear that brother
CATHCART, whether he posed
as Unionist or Liberal, was
the man for Orkney, need-
ing no extraneous assist-
ance. Thus it proved, and
the Bounding Brothers
from Brobdingnag, each
returned by his old consti-
tuency, are back again.
It is understood that the
SPEAKER has ruled that, as

FURTHER DEALINGS
PETER.
WF, have given some account of the
gospel of Peterism, in our reference last
week to MR. PETER KEARY's new book,
Success after Failure, the sub-title of
which is Some Men who have Got Out
and Got On : enough perhaps to indicate
what an admirable and satisfying creed
PETER's is. To make money : that is
getting on. To fail to make it : that is
getting out. You can conceive of his
scorn for the non-arrivers, so to speak,
only by reading his pages.
PETER cannot get over his adoration
of the men who as boys began by doing
the wrong thing and then found their
true walk in life and succeeded in it.
He calls that getting out and getting on.
But his book is otherwise so American
that one marvels at this insistence on
such a commonplace of existence; for
no American of twenty-five is doing
what he was doing at twenty; and no
American of thirty is doing what he was
WITH
doing at twenty-five. The change from
a youthful mistake to a congenial course
is not anything to write books about,
PETER. That is not necessarily admirable.
Nothing so infuriates PETER as soli-
taries and lovers of nature. Borrow,
for example, enrages him—BoRRow, the
“useless tramp,” who dared to waste
his life in roaming about this interesting
world studying men and adding language
to language. No money in it, says PETER ;
and then, hypnotised by the fame of
Lavengro, he drags Borrow into his
pages, all unconscious that the reason
he wrote Lavengro and got on was
purely his systematic getting out (in
PETER's phrase) while he was preparing
to write it.
THOREAU, too, the recluse of New
England, whose ear was so near to
nature's heart—PETER cannot do with
him ; he calls him a tramp too, and yet
finding that THOREAU, as well as Borrow,
wrote books which are among the best
hundred, into his tin Walhalla THOREAU
also is kicked forthwith. “In with
you,” says PETER, “you're a feckless
ass, and you never paid income-tax in
your life, but in some extraordinary
way you made a reputation, and I can't
afford to appear ignorant of you.”
But, PETER, it won't do. You can't
have it both ways. You don't care
a fig for BoRRow and Thor:AU. Have
you ever read either? Anyhow you are
not going to presume on their genius to
patronise them without a protest. How
dare you say they got out? You know
they did not, any more than HEINE, or
DARwiN, or NEWTON, whom you also
beslaver. You know perfectly well they
did not get out, they merely developed
slowly in a non-Petrine way.
So back to your real heroes—your
GAMAGES and CARNEGIES and Rocke-
FELLERs—and leave the quiet and the
great alone.
After such a bewildering example as
THOREAU, one wonders that PETER did
not overcome his disgust for St. FRANCIS
of Assisi and drag him in too. Because,
although this Italian gentleman gave up
all he had and was so anti-social and un-
Petrine as to found an order of mendi-
cants, wasted his time and brains in
being kind to animals, had no banking
account whatever—no rows of shops in
Assisi, no villa just outside with a
double coach-house; although this was
so, yet he made the Fioretti, and one
feels that, had PETER been told of the
popularity of the Little Flowers, he
might have relented. For a book that
has gone into many editions always

brings him to his knees. Then we
should have had : “Eccentric Italian
who after years of wasted meditation
and unprofitable charitics writes a book
that has consoled thousands.” For that
is PETER's way. But no one told him of
the Little Flowers, and so the Saint
escapes. -
ORDEAL BY PLETHYSM0ſ:RAPH.
AN emotion-indicator has just been
invented by an American, who has given
it the pretty name of “plethysmograph.”
As illustrated in last week's Sketch, it
consists of a dial connected by tubing
with an india-rubber bag which is filled
with water and drawn tight after the
insertion of the patient's hand. If the
heart is stirred, in spite of this damp
proceeding, by the recital of any name
or otherwise, the involuntary acceleration
of the pulse will be shown by the index.
If this ingenious device is generally
adopted, we think a lot of trouble will
be saved and breaches of promise
avoided. Every properly equipped
young woman who contemplates getting
married will have this apparatus and
a jug of water within easy reach in
the front parlour when a possible choice
is paying a call. It is true the opera-
tion somewhat resembles the pouring of
a can of water down the sleeve of the
Boy Scout who is caught using bad
language, but the lady must not flinch,
even if the experiment might result in a
similar flow of eloquence. She must
request her visitor to turn up his shirt-
cuff and take a plunge into the lucky
bag. (If he is restive or maladroit, she
had better conduct him to the pantry
or places where there is a sink.) She
will then repeat to him all the feminine
names she can think of, and at the same
time keep an eye on the index. If her
own name scores the highest reading,
she may accept his attentions as serious.
If inconstancy is suspected, it would
be as well to take a weekly test, and the
figures could be neatly inscribed on a
card, as is done by the gas-inspector.
This will put an end to the “He-loves-
me-he-loves-me-not” state of mind. An
identical programme can be carried out
by the gentleman, if he can inveigle the
girl to play at being wet-bob.
In the law-courts, too, the plethys-etc.
bids fair to be invaluable. A secretive
witness with his fist in the water-bag
will, in the intervals of sneezing, reveal
by the gyrations of the indicator when
the opposing counsel has dealt him a
home-thrust. Any attempt at perjury
will, so to speak, let the cat out of the
bag, and be recorded on a chart for the
inspection of the jury. We are, in fact,
going back to the good old Anglo-Saxon
ordeal, and shall have to wear our hearts
upon, or rather, inside an india-rubber
sleeve.
AT THE PLAY.
“TANTALISING ToMMY.”
MR. CYRIL MAUDE's new production at
the Playhouse (by PAUL GAVAULT and
MICHAEL MoRTON) is not a notable addi-
tion to the British drama, but it is a
very pleasant after-dinner entertainment.
I should have enjoyed it still more
if Miss MARIE Löhr had not made an
entirely unnecessary appearance in
pyjamas at the end of the First Act.
This, I have no doubt, will be spoken
of as the great feature of the play; even
now it may be on posters all over
England; but there will be many to
regret this appearance of the musical
comedy touch in connection with Miss
LöHR. Mind you, I have nothing against

several pretty pairs of my own, and
having had for many years the privilege
of gazing at a sufficient number of
others through shop-windows; what I
object to is the cold-blooded manner in
which they are introduced to us on this
occasion.
The Great Pyjama Scene is reached
in this way. James Cottenham, an
elderly young clerk at the Colonial
Office, is spending the week-end at his
country cottage with his friend, Harry
Killick. Late at night a car breaks down
outside the cottage; the station is miles
away, and there are no other houses near.
James, greatly to his disgust (he is a
shy, old-fashioned person), has to offer
hospitality to the owner of the car, Miss
Pepper, commonly called Tommy. He
gives up his room to her, and sleeps on
a sofa downstairs. Also he lends her a
pair of pyjamas. The curtain might
have fallen here, but it does not.
Tommy retires to her room, and some
minutes later appears at the door of it
in the pale blue silk ones. . . . Tableau,
Curtain, Posters, etc., etc.
(Looking at them from another point
of view, do elderly young clerks in the
Colonial Office wear blue silk pyjamas?
I think not. Do they wear pyjamas
at all? I should doubt it very much.
Ten to one anybody who has to spend
the day in an old-fashioned Government
office spends the night in an old-fashioned
nightshirt.)
If you care to remain after the great
scene is over, you will find much to
amuse you in Tommy's wooing of James
(Mr. CYRIL MAUDE) under the watchful
eye of Killick (Mr. KENNETH DOUGLAs).
Mr. Douglas's Killick is the best per-
formance of the evening. He, more
than anybody, enters into the spirit of
the farce, and makes no pretence to take
it seriously. But, though I did not take
it seriously myself, I should like to believe
that the lunching scene at the Colonial
Office was really possible. You see
from the picture how jolly it would be.

HEREDITARY MINSTRELS.
GREAT excitement prevails in Parnas-
sian circles over the forthcoming banquet
of the Poetry Recital Society to be held
early in April. What lends peculiar in-
terest to the gathering is the fact that
the guests will include as many of the
descendants of the greater poets as
possible.
Already the attendance is assured
of descendants of WoRDsworth and
BROWNING, but we understand that the
following eminent personages will also
grace the gathering by their presence.
Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN, as the spiritual
descendant of the illustrious laureate,
Pye.
Miss CHRISTABEL PANKHURST, by virtue
of her Christian name.
The Proprietor of Scott's Restaurant
as representing SCOTT, CRABBE, SPRAT
and SHELLEY.
Mr. LEwis WALLER, as a descendant of
the famous lyrist.
Mr. SIDNEY LEE, as writer to the
Cygnet of Avon.
Mr. LEwis SIDNEY, as representing Sir
Philip of that ilk.
Miss JESSIE POPE on behalf of the Sage
of Twickenham.
Mr. ArtHUR Colliss, the great-great-
grand nephew of the author of the Ode
to the Passions.
Mr. John BURNS has readily signified
his intention of attending the banquet
and will recite a poem of which the first
stanza runs as follows:–
“Rads, wha hae wi' Gladstone bled,
Rads, wham “Honest John' has led,
Strike the caitiff Tories dead—
Hech for Battersea l’
Another interesting feature of the
feast will be the recitation by the Right
Hon. Sir ALEXANDER ACLAND-Hood of The
Song of the Whip, a poignant ballad
which opens with these memorable
lines : —
“Whip ! Whip ! Whip !
With a weary and aching head,
Till you long to give your Party the slip
And go straight home to bed.”
The Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL's contribu-
tion to the post-prandial programme
will take the form of a stirring appeal
to the conscience of City men, entitled
The Battle with the Baltic.
The admirers of Eliza Cook have
addressed an urgent appeal to her polar
namesake to attend on her behalf, but
no answer has yet been received. We
understand, however, that Mr. FRANK-
FoRT MOORE will be present, and sing a
song entitled Paradise and the Peary.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE have been a great many ingénues (mock or real) in
modern fiction, and doubtless one or two in actual life; but
there was never one inside a book or out of it who came
within a four-mile cab-radius of Margarita. She had been
| brought up on a desolate strip of Atlantic beach by shadowy
and mysterious parents, and when Roger Bradley met her
on Broadway her innocence was positively sky-scraping.
She did not even know her own surname, but she was
marvellously beautiful, and Roger, like a sensible fellow,
married her immediately and then started educating her.
The method adopted by INGRAHAM LovELL in telling the story
of Margarita's Soul and by Mr. John LANE in publishing it is
rather unusual. The book bears the sub-title of The Romantic
Recollections of a Man of Fifty (supposed to be the hopeless
adorer of the heroine and bosom-friend of the hero); it
is profusely illustrated, and the chapters are prefaced by
extracts (also illustrated) from Sir Hugh and the Mermaiden;
three, if you include the village idiot, the “fool” of the title—
Hilary Gibbon, an Irish lad with gray eyes and a brogue,
and Gillian Clarkson, who was living at the vicarage during
the absence of her husband. Gillian had flame-coloured |
hair and an appreciation for Celtic poetry; she and Hilary
used to go and talk it together in a wood, and when they
missed the last train home the Suburb said some sharp
things about them. Quite rightly, too. Eventually Hilary
is drowned in trying to rescue the idiot, and with the return
of Gillian's husband the book ends, sadly or not as you like
to take it. Personally I did not much mind either way, as
its only effect upon me was to rouse a kind of irritated common-
sense which made me almost ashamed of my most cherished
beliefs—even of the times when Tinker Bell has been revived
by my applauding palms. It is all very unfortunate.
No, you are quite wrong about The Prime Minister's
Secret; you're thinking of a different Prime Minister. This
one was Lord Penshurst. For three years he carried a secret
document about with him (instead of sending it to Chancery
Lane, like a sensible man), and at last it was stolen by Captain

and the writer has a
curious way of intro-
ducing well-known
names, sometimes
with letters omitted,
as, for instance,
General B––H, and
sometimes not, as
in the cases of
WhistLER, STEVENSON,
and DU MAURIER. The

way, made a picture

white work has not entirely convinced me that this young
prima donna (bless your soul, of course she became a prima
donna) was quite worthy of the adoration she aroused in
Winfred Jerrolds. Much the cleverest feature of the
story, of which I should guess a good part to be tran-
scribed from actual experience, is ſo be found in the
letters from Sue Paynter to the narrator; and for these
alone the book is well worth reading.
It was once my lot to accompany a small patriot to a
performance of An Englishman's Home, from which he
returned with the unexpected remark that the funny young
man who refused to defend his country was “jolly decent, but
the volunteer was a prig.” Something like the same un-
fortunate result seems to have attended my own reading
of The Fool of Faery (MILLs AND Boos). It is clear that
M. URQUHART meant it to show how a knowledge of the
unseen world about us, and belief in its mysterious influence
could distinguish the Elect, even amid the prosaic life of a
suburb. That, I am sure, was the idea; but it pains me to
confess that after reading it my sympathies went entirely
on the wrong side. Brutally put, the behaviour and con-
versation of the Elect seemed to me a peculiarly annoying
form of psychic snobbery. There were two of them—or
against his right
temple.” “Instantly two men jumped from their
seats and put their backs against the door. As they
stood there they drew their knives.”. . . “But Melun
was first, and the revolver which he had whipped out
covered the other man's breast.” . . . . “Driven hard
up to the hilt, straight through the man's heart, was
a knife, which Westerham instantly recognised as one of
his own.” . . . “Lying on the top of a little pile of
shavings was a human ear. ‘Oh, God,' cried the Premier,
‘it’s my daughter’s.’ ” (I always love that.) . . . “Then
as he stood there with his eyes bent on her hair he heard the
sickening thud as Melun's body fell on to the stones below.”
- So it all ends happily—for it was the wrong ear,
and the secret had not been revealed to Germany after all.
If you like this sort of thing as much as I do you will
certainly read Mr. WHITE's book in one breathless sitting.
“In the pockets of a thirteen-year-old Arbroath boy found crying in
the streets of Glasgow were an electric lamp and £30. He left home
on Monday to start upon the career of a highwayman.”
To have collected £30 in a couple of days—and in Scotland
too—was not bad work, and we don't see what he had to
complain about.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“FREE-FOODER.” — I have it on the authority of the
Monagasque Vice-Consul at Baden-Baden that offal is the
habitual food of the so-called working-classes in the Protected
Fatherland. At the same time I am assured that it is the
very best offal.
“DUB:ous.”—You say you cannot make up your dear mind
whether you would sooner be made an hereditary peer with-
out a veto, or a life-peer with one. This is indeed a horny
dilemma; but you must bear up. After all, it is just
possible that you mayn't be made either.
“RADICAL.”—Of course, if you got into Parliament by
telling your constituents that the hereditary principle must
be done away with, and now find that your leader hopes to
go shortly to the country with the cry, “The hereditary
character of the House of Lords must be preserved,” you are
certainly in a very awkward position. -
“PROSPECT:VE PEER”—If you have made it quite clear to
the PRIME MINISTER that you are prepared to become a Peer,
under any conditions, even the most humiliating, you can do
nothing further for the present. Unless, perhaps, you might
join the Radical cave, and be so nasty to him that he might
have to shove you into “another place" to get rid of you.
“CAVEAT EMPTOR.”—No, I cannot recommend Asquith
Guaranteed Stock. Why not try Rubbers?
“ONE of THE GREAT MAJORITY.”—It is a very difficult case.
As you say, if the Nationalists had carried their conscientious
approval of Tariff Reform to the point of supporting Mr.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN's amendment, instead of merely abstain-
ing from voting, there would have been a majority of 50
against the Government. And the same thing may be said,
prospectively, about the Budget. Your best course would be
to go about the country saying that the People were never
consulted on either of these two issues, but simply on the
Lords' Veto. Only I don't advise you to start on this tack
in the “Great Industrial Centres" of the North.
“PRO-TIBET.”—Yes, you are quite right about the DALA
LAMA. He is a biped. With two more legs he could have
run away much quicker.
“SPECULATOR.”—I cannot account for the boom in Rubber,
unless it is to be explained by the wet season causing a run
on goloshes.
“PARISIEN.”—I, too, have been reading M. RAYMOND
RECOULY's En Angleterre, and have remarked that, after long
residence in England and much intelligent observation of
our manners, he still labours under the impression that an
English gentleman habitually dines en smoking. My poor
friend, it hurts me to destroy one of the most cherished
illusions of your countrymen, but we don't dine in a
“smoking" (whatever that may be) any more than you ride
in the Bois in pyjamas. (). S.
The Perils of the Country.
A correspondent writes to The Reading Mercury:—
“Sir, – May I ask (through your Paper) whether something cannot
be done to prevent men in the village of Tilehurst from firing off guns
in cottage gardens, too near the cottage entrances? I was frightened
yesterday morning while in my bedroom by witnessing a man in the
next garden firing off a gun perilously near (although in the opposite
direction) to the place where I should in a few moments later have
leen standing in my garden.”
A pretty near thing, that.

ACT I.
ScENE–A Churchyard not far from the Workhouse. As the
curtain draws up John Wilson and Nancy Arden are
discovered inspecting the gravestones.
Wilson. Here is another, Nancy. Listen. (He reads the
inscription on a gravestone.) “Beneath this store is interred
all that was mortal of Abraham Ballinger, Alderman and
Justice of the Peace. Venerated and loved by all who knew
him, a good husband and a kind father, he died on April 2nd,
1909, in the 75th year of his age. Go thou and do likewise.”
Now I knew that man—you knew him, too, Nancy - and I
have no hesitation in saying that the operative part of the
inscription is a lie from beginning to end. He drove his
wife into a lunatic asylum by his brutality; his son and
his daughter rightly hated him, and he sanded an absolutely
incalculable amount of sugar in his grocer's shop. And then
he dies, and this mendacious record is carved for the decep-
tion of posterity. Pah! * - - -
Nancy. Oh, come, John J Poor old Uncle Abraham wasn't
so bad as all that.
Wilson. Yes, he was, and much worse, too. But it's all
part of the system on which this life of ours is based. I've
made up my mind to expose that system. I mean to crush
it. I'm going to begin on it directly, and I want to feel that
your love and your sympathy are there to sustain me.
Nancy. You can be sure of me, Jolin ; but what do you
mean to do?
Wilson. Do you see that Workhouse? (He points off R.)
Well, that is the symbol of the system, the embodiment of
all the maddening hypocrisy of existence. I shall introduce
myself into it as a tramp, learn its ghastly secrets and publish
them to the world. Then the system will come to an end.
Nancy. Take care, John. That's what father used to say
many years ago. -
Wilson. Your father, Nancy, is one of nature's noblemen,
but a sad sufferer.
Nancy. He was a powerful man once, and very cheerful;
but that was before he set himself up against mother's
system of household management. He didn't struggle long,
and you can see for yourself what a wreck he became. If
you'll take my advice you'll leave systems alone, John.
Wilson. Never! How could I look you, or, for the matter
of that, myself, in the face if I did 2 And now embrace me,
and, for a time, farewell.

the curtain falls.

The Master's Room in the Workhouse. At the back is a door
leading into the Casual Ward. Josiah Merridew is seated
at a table with a large ledger open in front of him. Two
attendants bearing a stretcher are passing through from
the Casual Ward to a door on the right.

you to-day at four, between the School Management Com-
mittee and Mrs. Hanson's garden-party.
Merridew. That'll do very nicely. Hallo, who's this?
[An attendant enters, escorting Wilson disguised as a
tramp and heavily handcuffed.
The Attendant. He's as deaf as a post, Sir, and as I
couldn't make him hear I thought it best to slip the brace-
lets on him.
Merridew. Quite right, quite right. No doubt a very
dangerous fellow. (To Wilson) Now, Sir, you listen to me.
You've not come here to amuse yourself. You'll have an
hour under the pump first, and then we'll see what we can
do with you. Do you hear?

ago.

Merridew. Well, dear.
Grace. Don't send that man away. There is something in
his face that bespeaks my pity. [She smiles at Wilson.

atmosphere of this place must be maintained. -

We merely sketch this Act. The scene is laid in the
padded room occupied by Wilson. He is mercilessly beaten
by attendants and dies just as Grace enters with an order of
release. She dies on seeing what has happened; and finally
Nancy, entering through the window to rescue Wilson, dis-
covers the attendants gazing at the two dead bodies, and
also dies.

the deaths in his ledger and arranges with Mr. Nash for

AFTERNOON SLEEP.
[“In the afternoon they came unto a land
In which it seemed always afternoon."]
I AM like Napoleon in that I can go
to sleep at any moment; I am unlike
him (I believe) in that I am always
doing so. One makes no apology for
doing so on Sunday afternoon—the
apology indeed should come from the
others, the wakeful parties. . .
“Uncle?”
“Margery.”
“Will you come and play wiv me?”
“I’m rather busy just now,” I said
with closed eyes. “After tea.”
“Why are you raver busy just now?
My baby's only raver busy sometimes.”
“Well then, you know what it's like;
how important it is that one shouldn't
be disturbed.”
“But you must be beturbed when
I ask you to come and play wiv me.”
“Oh, well . . . what shall we play at”
“Trains,” said Margery eagerly.
When we play trains I have to be a
tunnel. I don't know if you have ever
been a tunnel? No; well, it's an over-
rated profession.
“We won't play trains,” I announced
firmly, “because it's Sunday.”
“Why not because it's Sunday?”
(Oh, you little pagan') -
“Hasn't Mummy told you all about
Sunday ?” -
“Oh, yes, Maud did tell me,” said
Margery casually. Then she gave an
innocent little smile. “Oh, I called
Mummy Maud,” she said in pretended
surprise. “I quite fought I was up-
stairs' "
I hope you follow. The manners and
customs of good society must be observed
on the ground floor where visitors may
happen; upstairs one relaxes a little.
“Do you know,” Margery went on
with the air of a discoverer, “you
mustn't say ‘prayers' downstairs. Or
‘corsets.”
“I never do,” I affirmed. “Well,
anyhow I never will again.”
“Why mayn't you?”
“I don't know,” I said sleepily.
“Say prehaps.”
“Well — prehaps it's because your
mother tells you not to.”
“Well, 'at’s a silly ſing to say,” said
Margery scornfully. -
“It is. I'm thoroughly ashamed of
it. I apologise. Good night.” And I
closed my eyes again. . . .
“I fought you were going to play
with me, Mr. Bingle,” sighed Margery
to herself.
“My name is not Bingle,” I said,
opening one eye.
“Why isn't it Bingle 2"
“The story is a very long and sad
one. When I wake up I will tell it to
you. Good night.”
“Tell it to me now.”
There was no help for it.
“Once upon a time,” I said rapidly,
“there was a man called Bingle, Oliver
Bingle, and he married a lady called
Pringle. And his brother married a
lady called Jingle; and his other brother
married a Miss Wingle. And his cousin
remained single . . . That is all.”
“Oh, I see,” said Margery doubtfully.
“Now will you play with me?”
How can one resist the pleading of a
young cheild 2
“All right,” I said. “We’ll pretend
I'm a little girl, and you're my mummy,
and you've just put me to bed. . . .
Good night, mummy dear.”
“Oh, but I must cover you up.”
She fetched a table-cloth, and a pram-
cover, and The Times, and a handker-
chief, and the cat, and a doll's what-I-
mustn't-say-downstairs, and a cushion;
and she covered me up and tucked me in.
“’Ere, 'ere, now go to sleep, my darling,”
she said, and kissed me lovingly.
“Oh, Margie, you dear,” I whispered.
“You called me ‘Margie’ſ ” she cried
in horror. -
“I meant ‘Mummy.’ Good night.”
One, two, three seconds passed rapidly.
“It's morning,” said a bright voice
in my ear. “Get up.”
“I’m very ill,” I pleaded ; “I want to
stay in bed all day.”
“But your dear uncle,” said Margery,
inventing hastily, “came last night
after you were in bed, and stayed 'e
night. Do you see? And he wants
you to sit on his chest in bed and talk
to him.”
“Where is lie? Show me the
bounder.”
“'Ere he is,” said Margery, pointing
at me.
“But look here, I can't sit on my
own chest and talk to myself. I’ll take
the two parts if you insist, Sir HERBERT,
but I can't play them simultaneously.
Not even IRVING——”
“Why can't you play ven simrul-

“Well, I can't.

“Nope,” said Margery, shaking her
head.
“You should say, ‘No, thank you,
revered and highly respected Uncle.’’
“No hank you, Mr. Cann.”
“I have already informed you that
my name is not Bingle; and I have
now to add that neither is it Cann.”
“Why neiver is it Cann 2"
“That isn't grammar. You should
say, ‘Why can it not either ?’”
“Why?”
“I don't know.”
“Say prehaps.”
“No, I can't even say prelaps.”
“Well, say I shall understand when
I'm a big girl.”
Margie, will you let
“You’ll understand when you're a
big girl, Margery,” I said solemnly.
“Oh, I see.”
“That's right. Now then, what about
going to sleep?”
She was silent for a moment, and I
thought I was safe. Then
“ Uncle, just tell me—why, was 'at
little boy crying vis morning?”
“Which little boy?”
“We one in 'e road.”
“Oh, that one. Well, he was crying
because his Uncle hadn't had any sleep
all night, and when he tried to go to
sleep in the afternoon——”
“Say prehaps again.”
My first rejected contribution' I
sighed and had another shot. “Well,
then,” I said gallantly, “it must have
been because he hadn't got a sweet little
girl of three to play with him.”
“Yes,” said Margery, nodding her
head thoughtfully, “’at was it.”

ONE OF THE OLD GUARL).
I wrote the other week of my poor
friend, the New Pangloss, as I called
him. And now I hear that another
friend has gone to the Land of Shadows.
He was one of those dear men who
never pick up a new idea or use a
new phrase. Sometimes one wonders
whether one admires most those deter-
mined conventionalists or the acquisitive
modernists who are picking up wrinkles
all the time. This friend, now dead,
certainly was a magnificent example of
his type. I will wager that during the
past twenty years of his life he never
referred to the French in any other way
than as “our lively neighbours.” He
never entered a hackney-carriage with-
out asking if there was “room for a little
one”; he never opened the door for a
guest without saying, “age before
honesty”; he never remarked upon his
last night's repose without saying he had
“slept the sleep of the just,” or parted
with a friend without saying, “be good.”
If you asked him how he was, he
said, “right as a trivet,” although he
had no more idea than you or I what a
trivet is. He always told children that
“stinging - nettles do not sting this
month,” and that “fingers were made
before forks,” and it never rained hard
but he mentioned that it was good
weather for ducks. -
In short he never disappointed the ear,
and I am inclined to think that a man
of whom this can be said is, in the sum
of things, more to be desired than your
most original and tickling wit. Ile was
a human cuckoo-clock. And now he is
dead—run down—and I shall mourn him
as another lost landmark, another solid,
tangible link with Simplicity and the
Past.

Rippindorf-awf-Schneegebirge.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-I’m just beginning
to buck up a bit, since coming here with
Bosh and Wee-Wee. My dear, I was so
prostrate and my nerves were in such a
state after my election exertions that Sir
Henry Kiddem said I must go away
at once and have perfect rest. Josiah
said he 'd take me away next day; but
dear Sir Henry, who's the best doctor that
ever felt a pulse and understands people's
constitutions à merveille, said emphati-
cally, No; in my present state I must be
quite away from those dearest to me.
So Josiah didn't come.
All of us election victims here are
agreed never to mention votes or polls
or beastly politics again as long as we
live. Poor dear Norty has got to leave
us to take his seat for Houndsditch; but
he 's been doing his best while here to
forget that there is such a place.
Oh, my dearest and best you don't
know all that can be got out of life till
you ski! It’s sailing on the sea, and
flying in the air, with a heavenly some-

and so on. He’s distinctly inclined to
be a darling, pale and fair with curly
flaxen hair and an awfully good figure.
Norty says he's an “anaemic ass” and
that his ski-ing is “flukey’”; but, entre
mous, Norty never got his ski-legs; they
were buried in the snow and he couldn't
find them—hence his bitterness. I said
to Olaf yesterday that ski-ing teaches
one how it feels to be an angel, and he
told me I needn't be ski-ing to feel that.
He talks the prettiest English, not
exactly broken, only a teeny bit chipped.
There's a fly in the ointment, however.
Josiah keeps on writing to know if I’m
stronger and if the “mountain quiet”
is doing my nerves good, and if he may
come. What time have I to answer
letters, I'll ask you, with ski-ing and
bob-sleighing all day, torchlight skat-
ing in the evening, and dancing and
pillow-fights nearly all night? I’ve
managed to send him a few words,
however, telling him I’m a weeny bit
better, but that my nerves won’t yet
stand the excitement of seeing my dear
ones. There's no doubt this place has
a wonderfully curative effect on those
suffering from strain, as most of us have
been. Fluffy Thistledown broke down
quite suddenly while she and Thistle-
down had a big house party of relatives
with them, and had to leave him to see
to them, and come off to this place in a
life-and-death hurry. And now she
seems quite recovered, and is bob-
sleighing with Jack Hurlingham all day.
Talking of bob-sleighs, you should
see Princess Poppolinsky's (autrefois
Clytie Wandollarbilt)! It's all of ebony
and silver, with the Poppolinsky cipher
and coronet wherever there’s room for it,
guided by a big moujik or Tartar or
something, with the cipher and coronet
again on the front of his fur cap, and
Clytie herself in such sables, Daphne,
that I hardly dare to look at them for
fear I should be tempted to slay her.
There’s an aloofness and chilliness about
her, now she’s a Highness, that I find
quite delicious. I said to her the other
day: “I suppose you came to the
Schneegebirge, my dear, from a fellow-
feeling, because it also is cool and a
highness!”
I don't see much of Stella Clack-
mannan. Since her arrival a week ago
with her broom and stones, she's given
herself up to practising her curling
like mad for the Bonspiel. She doesn’t
want to lose her rep. as the best woman
curler of the day. She's already got
“curling face,” which, Norty says, isn't
as nice as curling hair.
Oh, my dear, such fun! Bob Aislabie,
M.F.H., has actually chucked her be-
loved hunting for a week and joined us.
Of course, f. Ninian follyott has
come in her wake, though he doesn't go
in for any of the sports and can't stand
the cold. He still says they’re engaged,
and she says they’re not. Bob's for
ever tobogganing down all the most
horribly dangerous slopes she can find,
while Lord Ninny, wrapped up to the
eyes and shivering, looks on, bleating
out: “Tweetie, you cruel girl! You ll
break your neck and my heart! Dearest,
do be careful ?” And Bob shouts back:
“Shut up, Ninny, and clear out, you
blitherin' little idiot!”
C'est un couple comme il my en a
point.
I gave such a perfectly lovely Snow
Picnic last week. Everyone said it was
immensely well done and quite quite.
We all dressed up as Eskimos and
pretended to be an Arctic ICxpeditiºn.
I borrowed a lot of dogs, and tried to
get some penguins, but Bosh says
they’re not necessary at the North Pole,
and we set off with sledges and every-
thing en rêgle. Oh, it was the squeakiest
affair Olaf looked most awfully busi.
ness-like; the Arctic get-up suited him
right down to the snow. We pretended
to make all sorts of discoveries, and
Norty said he should send our data to
Copenhagen We had lunch in the
snow; the cham was splendidly frappé,
of course. “But the worst of it is,”
said Bob Aislabie, “all the grub's
frappé, too !”
Kºr lunch we’d a glorious snow-
balling rag, and just as we were think-
ing of going back we missed that absurd
Wee-Wee. We had to explore in
earnest then, and we'd all got into quite
a nervy state before she was found ever
so much higher up the mountain, stuck
fast, and unable to go up or come down.
It was local colour again. She wished
to imagine how it would be to be lost on
the mountains, that she might write
about it; and she got her wish, and
something over; while as for local colour,
my dear, her poor little nose was blue
with cold and terror! Bosh was angry
with her. He said she'd end by going
to look for first-hand impressions at the
bottom of a crevasse, and then they
wouldn't be any use to her
Adieu, chérie. Come and learn to ski.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
The Latest Fashionable Cure.
“High above the heads of all in the narrow
gallery unbroken lines of peresses ran along
the dark oak sides of the House beneath the
great stained glass windows.”—Evening News.
Exercise, that's the best thing for the
figure.
“The spot at which the accident occurred
runs parallel with the sea.”—The Scotsman.
See above. The most energetic spot we
have heard of lately.
Tales of the Old Gaiety.
“The Church and the stage have but little in
common, but St. George's late choirmaster,
Meyer Lutz, composed many vivacious airs for
the old Gaiety, where for a considerable period
the conducted the orchestra. It was there, also,
that the first Archbishop of Westminster,
Cardinal Wiseman, was enthroned.”
Pall Mall Gazette.
Hardly the place, we should have said.
“As a result of a recent conference in London
a gigantic international map of the earth is
planned on a scale of a million kilomètres to
the centimetre.”—Continental Daily A. ail.
|This works out at about one and a half
million miles to the inch. It scarcely
seems worth while.
“The above article will appear every
Friday in the ‘Suffolk Chronicle and
Mercury,’” is an announcement made
by that paper. In a year or so the
superstition that Friday is an unlucky
day should be firmly established. t
From a bookseller's catalogue:—
“Cod Liven Oil.--A Comparative Study of
the Nose upon the Nutrition of Enormal and
Tuberculous Pigs.”
We always though there was something
sinister in cod liver oil.
From a placard :
“The Sphere HAs No PEER.”
Cheer up, Mr. SHORTER; there's hope yet.

D–D TYRES OUT
THE VETO.
By MR. Robert BART KENNEDY-BLATCHFord.
A PALE-FACED throng sit in the Parlia-
ment House. They are in conclave.
They are obsessed by a burden. A
heavy burden. They strive to throw
off the fetters that nullify their legisla-
tion. Their legislation.
What fetters them 2 In two words I
answer, The Veto. It presses on them,
and, through them, on the People. To
the People the Veto is the question of
the hour. The all-important question.
Men who think, men who toil, men
who toil not, ay, even the little children
of the slums, on each the Veto presses
like an incubus. It presses sore.
Away with it! And with it the
Lords. The Lords must go. The
country is too full of Lords. They
crowd out the down-trodden and the
hungry. Because of the Lords the
bitter struggle for the scanty crusts of
life grows ever more severe, ever more
fierce.
The crusts are few. The Lords are
many. Therefore must they go. Why?
Because it is decreed. It is decreed by
the People.
Where must the Lords go? It does
not matter. There are so many places.
The choice is infinite.
The objective of the Lords may be
left to the future. The future can take
care of itself. The Lords can take care
of themselves. They always do.
Who are the Lords?
They are born in the purple.
silver spoons.
With
Silver spoons in their mouths!
They are a race apart.
They are the back-numbers in the
Marathon of Life.
What is Life? What is a Marathon 2
It does not matter. The Lords must
go.
If there were no Veto there would be
no Lords. It is essential to abolish the
Lords. Therefore it is first essential to
abolish the Veto. The one thing is a
corollary of the other.
The Lords must go. They must be
ended . . . [So must this. Ed.
E.
THE TURN OF THE WHEEL.
[It is state 1 that the bicycle is to become
fashionable again.]
TIME was (I do adore that phrase)
When, keen as mustard, I bestrode
The metalled horse of modern days
And took the king's high road.
A very bird, adown the slope -
With lifted feet I'd lightly drop,
Or toil till I was heliotrope -
To reach some mountain-top.
Yet, over and above the speed
I liked the splendour and the fuss
About my old velocipede,
My tin Bucephalus
The reverence of the hind to win,
To pause, a Person of account,
While ostlers hurried from the inn
To hold my prancing mount;
To flabbergast the village hens;
Against the hedge-row (neatly spiked)
To urge pedestrians by tens—
These were the parts I liked.
Now it is otherwise; a wail,
A whirl of dust that makes you blink—
The road-hog passes in a gale
And leaves behind his stink.
He is the undisputed lord
Of whatsoe'er may roll or run ;
By him the farmer's carts are bored,
By him the hens fordone.
Not TURPIN in his palmy prime,
Hero of ale-house host and wench,
Achieved a kingship so sublime
(Also he lacked the stench).
Therefore, I say, I do not yearn
To mount the pump-inflated hack,
To grip the wobbling bars and turn
Blue in the face or black.
I that of old was “upper crust,”
To whom the yokel used to cringe
In days when he imbibed his dust
Without that petrol tinge;
Am I to hear his loud guffaw,
To feel, when shaving past his spine,
The transference of the ancient awe
From me to motor-swine? Evoe.

ES S E N C E OF PA R L I A M E N T.
ExtaacTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
MORE “DELICACIES” OF DEBATE.
In response to a polite request from Mr. Austen Chamberlain “to prove any single statement he made on the Fiscal Question during the
Election,” Mr. Lloyd George showed that Mr. Chamberlain had omitted very vital words from a quotation, and proceeded to lay about him
pretty freely. He incidentally introduced some fresh items from the appetising Protectionist menu of the German working-classes. To
the famous “horse-flesh” and “black-bread" he added donkeys and dogs!
House of Commons, Monday, Feb. 21.
—House thronged in anticipation of
what is spoken of as the PREMIER s momen-
tous announcement on course of busi-
ness. Four o'clock fixed for commencing
work. Every bench on floor, side
galleries, and over clock occupied. As
at Epsom a dog sometimes casually
crosses course, with field in sight, so a
few laggard Members seized on the
opportunity to be sworn in. This inter-
lude, unlike the Derby diversion, delayed
debate on Address, which was further
postponed by debate on Standing
Order which forbids Peers to meddle
with Parliamentary election.
House in quaint moment of magna-
nimity resolved to annul the Standing
Order. Been debated for years; whenever
division taken, majority mustered against
it. Now it goes without even a division.
SARK sees in it the touch of nature that
makes the whole world kin. Just as in
the good old time gentlemen condemned
to death, halting on their journey to
Tyburn, had pressed on their acceptance
the flowing bowl, so noble lords des-
tined to decapitation in respect of
legislative powers have this century-
old ban removed. Jockey of Norfolk
may at next General Election indulge
in his passion for correspondence with
“my dear PROFUMo,” none daring to
make him afraid.
Momentous occasion aforesaid turned
out to be surprisingly dull. Possibly
this natural result of overstrained
expectation. Certainly PRINCE ARTHUR,
who led the attack, was decidedly
prosy. Nor did light of battle flash
from the PREMIER's eye. Contrary to
habit he brought down mass of MS.,
from which at times he closely read.
Overloaded with detail, Members had
difficulty in grasping his plan of proce-
dure. When fully mast red, it had
chilling effect upon numerically large
section of Ministerial force who want
Veto first. Enthusiasm that found vent
in mighty cheers when PREMIER rose
gradually died away.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
On the whole a dispirited opening of
what promises to be epoch-making
fight.
Business done.—Address moved and
seconded.
Tuesday. — House had advantage of
assisting at realisation of something
approaching debate in Irish Parliament
when it shall be re-established on College
Green. Full flavour restrained by foreign
surroundings. Encircled by cold-blooded
Saxons, scene and action lacked the
inspiriting atmosphere breathed in
Dublin. But they served.
WILLIAM O'BRIEN, with his bodyguard
of ten bould bhoys, has come to West-
minster with avowed intention
of wiping the floor of the House
of Commons with the limp body
of John REDMOND. In PARNELL's
time and later, Irish National-
ists were united in opposition
to Government of the day what-
ever its political colour might
be. Now, by comparison with
his feelings towards the Red-
mondites, WILLIAM O'BRIEN
almost worships the Chief SEC-
RETARY to the LoRD LIEUTENANT.
The foes of Ireland, he laments,
are those of her own household,
sons nourished at her bosom.
O'BRIEN, after long interval re-
turning to political life, has
devoted himself to the task
of driving forth the traitors.
Brooding over their iniquities,
he chants in the ear of Ireland
a variant on LovELACE's death-
less couplet addressed “To
Lucasta on going to the Wars”:
“I could not love thee, Dear, so much,
Loathed I not REDMOND more.”
Opportunity came to-day in
debate on Address. He seized
it by the hair, as they say at
Boulogne. Lost no time in
preamble or parley. Went
straight for REDMOND, and (in
Inglish Parliamentary sense,
of course) got his head in Chancery and
punched it with resounding blows.
Ferocity of attack rather increased by
studious quietude of manner, laboured
polish of phrase. From time to time
the volcanic emotion that underlay the
surface manifested itself in fierce out-
burst that raised the voice almost to a
shriek. Instantly he recovered himself,
and succeeding sentences were whispered
in a voice so humbly low that it was
sometimes difficult to catch all the
syllables. -
As he went forward the countrymen
he denounced sat restless on the two
back benches. Only a narrow strip of
neutral territory divided them from the
accuser. Had the incident happened on
College Green, this bench would not
long have served as barrier. As things
were, the restraint of place and circum-
stance was borne with heroic self-control.
Once or twice, at some exceptionally
vicious assault from the grey-bearded
spectacled man on his legs almost within
hand-grip, murmured exclamations
formed a sort of chorus. For the most
part O'BRIEN ignored this commentary.
Once he turned round and the melli-
fluous voice in which he addressed the
House suddenly changed to fierce
hissing whisper as he enquired,—
“Is there anybody behind me who
says different 2 ”
Later, on renewed provocation, he
turned again to face the music, with the
the pages of the placid Dod “A Radical
and Home Ruler.” He was, in truth,
raucous in his Radicalism. The great
Liberal upheaval that had just placed
GLADSTONE in power was in his opinion
nullified by Whiggism prevalent in the
Cabinet. He wanted to do away with
most things, especially the House of
Lords and Royal Palaces.
One day in the spring of the session
of 1892 ALPHEUS CLEOPHAs, then in his
prime, raised debate in Committee of
Supply on expenditure upon the latter.
With that largeness of mind, that
almost reckless generosity that marks
the action of gentlemen dealing with
other persons' property, AL-
• PHEUs suggested that Bucking-
ham Palace or Kensington

care which, should be set aside
for the purposes of a British

gentlemen in the quarter of the
House where to-night he stands
applauded.
“The PRINCE OF WALES and
the rest of the Royal Family,”
he said—and Members at first
thought he was going to pro-
| pose a toast—“are well able to
pay for the maintenance of their
| residences. It is shabby of them
not only to occupy their palaces
rent free, but to sponge upon the
public to keep them in repair.”
Twenty-nine years later,
SAMUEL, once more called, comes
back, as he plaintively says,

incomplete declaration, “If there is any
articulate observation--—”
What in such case would follow was
left to the imagination. Whatever the
threat veiled it succeeded for a time in
quelling the growing disturbance on
the back benches.
Business done.—Debate on Address
continued.
Thursday. — “But that's another
STOREY,” said the MEMBER FOR SARK, un-
consciously quoting familiar phrase
reiterated by KIPLING in his early and
better days. He was listening to the
new Member for Sunderland, who, like
bread thrown upon the waters, has
returned after many days.
Remember him twenty-nine years ago,
when he first appeared on Parliamentary
stage, proudly writing himself down in
ever again to be the strong
Party man I once was.” So he
seats himself among the Elect
behind Front Opposition Bench,
and, amid continuous cheers
from country gentlemen to
whose fathers and uncles he
was anathema, delivers a strong
Protectionist speech.
A strange tendency this on part of
extreme Radicals to blossom—or is it to
fade?—into ultra-Toryism. Save with
stupendous exception of Mr. G., in early
manhood the rising hope of stern un-
bending Toryism, one does not recall
a notable parallel case in the other
camp. (Mem.—Write a treatise on this
subject, with photographs, showing emi-
ment Radicals at various stages of their
journey to North Pole of Toryism.)
Business done.—Debate on SoN AUS-
TEN's amendment to Address in favour of
Tariff Reform. KETTLE wittily described
it as an effort to nail not his colours but
his captain to the mast. PRINCE ARTHUR,
as usual, fenced with admirable skill.

MODEL ADDRESS FOR AN
L.C.C. CANDIDATE.
[Recollect that the mere word “election'
fills the voter with nausea, and, in composing
your election address, tread lightly.]
LADIES, GENTLEMEN AND WHAT-Nots,
| Here we all are again, faced by another
of these tiresome elections. Here am I
being polite to you, and promising you
all the good things that you can possibly
want in this world or the next, on one
small condition. Yes, you have guessed
right the very first time. It is your vote
I want.
I offer myself as your candidate for
three reasons. In the first place I want
to see for myself what the inside of the
L.C. Council Chamber is like. In the
second place I want a free pass over all
the L.C.C. tramways. In the third
place . . . . but I have forgotten the
third reason. It was, I think, something
beginning with an “S,” but whether it
was Socialism, Steamboats, or 'Stounding
'Stravagance, I cannot say.
I ask you for that which you cannot
possibly want for yourself, your vote.
-
It has been suggested to me that in
asking I should give you some inkling
of my policy. In the first place I stand
here for the sacred principle of building
Dreadnoughts ad libitum, and making
the foreigner pay. One man, one Dread-
nought; one foreigner, one bill for one-
and-a-half million sterling, with five
per cent. discount for cash. That is my
motto. In the second place I am happy
to be able to say that I have made the
following statement upon affidavit:—“I,
Richard Roe, make oath and say as
follows:–To the best of my knowledge
and belief I want Tariff Reform. The
black bread and dear loaf arguments
can be reduced to an absurdity by
eating biscuits. I make biscuits.-
(Advt.).” But I am told that the L.C.C.
concerns itself with neither Tariff
Reform nor Dreadnoughts. More shame,
say I, to the L.C.C. However, as my
Agent is looking over my shoulder as I
write, I pass on.
He tells me, this Agent, to “come to
you on Belgian Tram Rails.” I fail to
understand him, but I obey. What we
want is Belgian Tram Rails and more
Belgian Tram Rails. What we want
them for I cannot think, but I am told
that you do want them, and what you
want I want to want. Gentlemen, we
will have these rails, even if I have to go
on my knees to Mr. GEORGEALEXANDERhim-
self for them. But I beg your pardon;
I am now told that you do not want
Belgian Tram Rails. Though I should
like to see you make up your minds once
for all at the start as to what you do
want, I confess that I think that your
second thoughts are the more sensible.
What could you do with a Tram Rail if
you had one? It would only fill up
your drawing-room, and no one would
really think it looked pretty, even
though Belgian. I proclaim myself,
therefore, an I.A.B.T.R., an Independent
Anti-Belgian Tram Railer, and await
the favour of your further orders.
I am told that the only other matters
of first importance are Education and
Sewers. For the present I confine
myself to the statement, evolved upon
my own authority and upon the inspira-
tion of the moment, that in 1809 the
average of our education and sewers

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
was one per cent. ; to-day it is cent. per
one. For the rest I will do myself the
honour of calling upon you personally
and chatting about these things when
I have found out something about them.
May I take this opportunity of warning
that what, on my part, would be an act
of courtesy in personally visiting you
will, on the part of my opponent, be
gross intimidation ? When therefore
he calls and tells you that he wants
a Belgian Tram Rail, say to him,
“We have given you education. We
have given you a sewer. Now you
want a tram rail. I conceive” (ironically)
“that a man of your extensive claims
can have no use for my poor little vote.
I shall thus have much pleasure in
giving it to your opponent” (me).
I should like to have concluded this
address by telling you to which party,
Moderate or Progressive, I belong.
Unfortunately my Agent has this
moment left the room. A rough-looking
gentleman, one of our workers, at
present engaged in licking envelopes,
tells me that he suspects from the
colour of our posters that I am a
Moderate. But I do not trust or ask you
to trust this man, suspecting as I do
that under cover of his employment he is
making a free meal off gum for which
I have paid, and wilfully engendering
in himself a thirst which it will be my
inevitable privilege to assuage.
Thus, when my opponent with great
pomp and to-do proclaims that he is
a member of this or that party, I shall
preserve a discreet silence. But, gentle-
men, I can do better than he. I can
and do, in the blessed absence of my
Agent, say that I will attach myself to
whichever party you prefer. Could any-
thing be fairer than that ? Can you, in
the face of that manly offer, go and elect
my opponent who entertains biassed and
partisan opinions on these matters, which
he is determined to thrust down your
throats if he can 2 No. Don't be
bullied, gentlemen. Choose your own
municipal politics, tell me what they are
as briefly as you can, and I will repre-
sent them for you, whether I understand
them or no.
On one thing only have I am opinion
which cannot be altered or improved.
I am strongly and unswervingly in
favour of myself. I hope you will all be.
If you are, poll early and poll often.

AT THE PLAY.
“JUSTICE.”
If any alien accuses our nation of
having ceased to take its pleasures
sadly, let him go, on three consecutive
nights, and assist at Elektra, Jekyll-
Hyde, and Justice, and he will be
bound to withdraw that cruel charge.
I try to think how Mr. FROHMAN (which,
being interpreted, is Mr. Merryman) was
ever persuaded to start his Repertory
scheme with so gloomy a play as that
of Mr. GALsworthy. “This will test my
public,” he must have said. “If they
can stand this, they can stand anything.
Let Justice be played, though the gallery-
gods should fall on us.” Fiat, in fact,

His BRIGHT SMILE HAUNTS ME STILL.
William Falder (Mr. DENNIs EADIE) informs
Counsel that he could remember nothing of the

to a certain resentment at being treated
like a child that has no imagination
and needs an easy object-lesson to be
put before his eyes. Mr. GALsworthy
will argue that, if he sent a letter to The
Times urging that crime on the part of
a neurotic should be treated as a disease,
and that solitary confinement is brutal-
ising, no one would pay any attention
to him. But let him illustrate his
views on the stage with a concrete
instance, and we shall be staggered.
Well, I grant that the stage is the place
for exposing moral abuses and social
scandals which might otherwise escape
our notice. It gives us a new perspec-
tive : we learn to see ourselves. But it
is different with those conditions in our
public life, well-known and admitted,
which have already engaged the earnest
attention of specialists not less wise or
sincere than the playwright himself. I
The nicely-balanced arguments which
have determined their choice of the least
of many evils are unsuited to a form of
art whose first business is not with
abstract Truth but with the emotions of
an audience. Mr. GALsworthy knows
all this, and so he flings the plain
pitiful facts at us, as if they were the
sole and unanswerable argument.
It seems that such a question as the
law's hopeless lack of elasticity in
dealing with individual cases requires
a more adaptable medium for its presen-
tation. Robert BROWNING (though he
would not have hesitated to argue on
both sides in any medium) recognised
this in his treatment of the case of
Caponsacchi, a case not so very unlike
that of Mr. GALsworthy's William Falder,
for the Court of Judgment in each
instance declined to accept the plea
that the prisoner had been tempted
by the need of saving a helpless woman
from the brutality of her husband.
All the same, Mr. GAISworthy has
come near to justifying himself of his
Justice, because he has done his best
to avoid special pleading, except, of
course, where it was to be expected—
in the speech of the Counsel for the
defence. And even here he admits
that there might well be abuses of the
clemency of the law. It would never
do for a man to be able to excuse
himself for having committed murder
on the ground that he was not feeling
quite well at the time—was, in fact, a
bit below himself. But a kind of
special pleading was shown in his par-
ticular selection of the circumstances
which provoked the crime and made
a contributory appeal to our pity.
And I noticed, too, that the worst
case of inhumanity, not here the fault
of the law's machinery, but of men's
hearts, was almost ignored. Falder,
coming out of prison, gets a chance
in a new situation. It was the cruelty
of his fellow-clerks, when they dis-
covered his history, that ruined his
chance of redemption. Much, and to
much purpose, might have been said of
the need for that charity which covers
up the past, but it would not have
suited the author's book, and so he let
pass the very theme on which he could
have done most service. But this is
not to suspect his sincerity, which was
manifest.
The play was admirably put on ; and
the performance throughout showed the
fine restraint of which the author set
so excellent an example. The trial
was perhaps a little protracted, and the
scene in the cell hardly conveyed the
actual horrors of solitary confinement.
This was in part because we had seen
and heard a good deal about them
already from the outside; in part

because it was hard to persuade oneself
that the prisoner could not easily have
walked out over the footlights if he had
only thought of it.
The play held the house, though I
confess to having been a little tired
of too much Cokeson. And this was
strange, for he was the comic relief.
Anyhow, I sympathised with the
prisoner, who declared that he could
recall nothing of the period of his
temporary aberration except the fact
that “be thought of Cokeson's face.”
This was put forward as a point in his
favour, since it argued that he could
not have been responsible for his actions
at the time.
A word about the costumes; though
the play perhaps hardly lent itself to quite
the smartest sartorial effects. Still, Mr.
Walter How 8 silk hat was a good
model, and Mr. James How's frock-coat
in the last Act hung well on him; but
the attachment of his eye-glass should
have been an invisible cord. Silk has
an air of affectation. Cokeson's office
coat (these should always be loosely cut)
was serviceable, and the judge's scarlet
andermine (each in just the right nuance)
made a happy contrast with the sombre
hues of counsel's robes. The detective's
lounge suit was not in perfect style, but
well enough adapted to his station. On
the other hand, a Norfolk jacket for a
prison chaplain is in bad taste. O. S.
“THE TENTH MAN.”
More politics—this time at the Globe.
George Winter, financier and scoundrel,
is the Liberal Member for Middlepool.
The Liberal Government has been in
power for six years, and is now going to
appeal to the country on (Help!) the
question of Conscription. The contest
is expected to be very close, so that
every seat is of importance. Apart from
that, his own seat is naturally of some
importance to Winter, guileless specu-
lators being more ready to trust their
money to one who can sign himself M.P.
Now Mrs. Winter is about to divorce
her husband, and a divorced man is
no sort of candidate for Nonconformist
Middlepool. At all costs she must be
prevented from bringing the action
before the election. Winter accordingly
threatens to counter-petition. His wife
has indiscreetly visited Venice and other
places contemporaneously with that
rising Under - Secretary, Mr. Robert
Colby; and, though Winter knows their
relations are innocent, he points out
that the mere fact of being “cited” in
the case will ruin Colby's chances of
Cabinet rank. To save her lover Mrs.
Winter withdraws, assuring the leading
Liberal lights of Middlepool that she is
on the best of terms with her husband.
But Winter has forgotten the “tenth
man.” Nine men, we are told, can be
bribed or flattered, but the tenth is
honest. James Ford is the tenth, and
he has discovered the truth about one of
Winter's companies. Nothing can move
him. At the moment of the Liberal
victory at Middlepool he announces his
intention of going to Scotland Yard.
The financier tries all his blandishments
in vain . . . and then poisons himself.
The first by-election! (Another is
imminent, because Mr. Colby has been
promised the War Secretaryship).
There is really more finance than
politics in the play, but I have dwelt
chiefly on the political motif—partly
because I have no head for finance, and
should get it all wrong if I tried to
describe it, partly because politics on
the stage always make themselves felt
so enormously. In this case they give
an undue appearance of theatricality to
the play. Mr. So MERSET MAUGHAM does
not seem to have taken any trouble
to make them real, and The Tenth Man
suffers in consequence. Yet it is an
interesting play, well handled, and con-
taining one or two excellent characters.
Mr. Bourchier as George Winter was
magnificent; he had a part which suited
him perfectly. Mr. EDMUND MAURICE as
a noble director was also very good,
and Mr. HoLMES-GoRE nearly made me
believe he was the Prime Minister. But
I am afraid I had no confidence at all in
Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE as the rising hope
of Liberalism. M.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. DESMOND Coke has assured me (on the title-page) that his
last book, Beauty for Ashes (CHAPMAN AND HALL), is a comedy
of caste, and I should like to believe him ; but, in all the
“comedies'' I know, the hero and heroine, whenever the
author has encouraged us to like them, are left to get married
at the fall of the curtain ; and, if a novelist is superior to
were I could take you across the hog-backed bridge between
them straight up Whispering Street till we came to the
House of Blind Fortunes. But as I don't know where in the
South country the twin towns are, and as it all happened
two hundred years ago, I can only tell you that it makes a
pretty picture in my mind, and that because I like it I can
almost believe that I am still young and unsophisticated.
Of them that write “mystery” novels, some, determined
to work a good mystery off their chests, use the novel as a
the playwright's conventional endings, he should also, I mere medium; others, bent on writing a good novel, invent a
think, dispense with the playwright's terminology. Humphrey mystery solely as an excuse for so doing. Judged by the ſar-
Scott-Mahon, who prided himself on being an individualist, fetched nature of his plot and the title of his book, Why Did
left Burcot Priory, where he was in the position of steward He Do It? (METHUEN), Mr. BERNARD CAPES is of the latter
to his father's impoverished estate, and after some vicissi-' class. “He " is Professor Urchin, head of the archaeological
tudes, admirably reported, succeeded in making a boy's club department of a London Co-operative Stores. “It" is an act
in the East End “go.” Incidentally he became engaged to
a fellow-worker, but realised that he wasn't genuinely in
love with her at about the same time that she discovered her
heart to have been all along in the possession of a former
admirer. (And this on page 300 out of 330 !) So Humphrey
returned to “the county’ and a possible marriage with a
very shallow poseuse (if there are poseuses), having heard the
West—or, at any rate, the aristocracy—a-calling. Now if
of treachery by which the practical joke of his bobbish young
friend, Mandrake, is allowed to be taken for an attempted
theft and discussed in a police court as such. The problem
is set in the three first and solved in the three last chapters,
and those six seemed to me the only dull ones in the book.
I found so much more pleasure in the behaviour of the minor
characters than in the progress of the main theme that, when
they became obsessed with the duty of being mysterious and

Humphrey had been a bit more of a prig, or if Rosa had been
more obviously middle-class (it didn't come out very plainly
until after they were engaged), or if the lady at home had
been even faintly attractive, I should have felt happier, but
as it was I had, I suppose, to laugh “sardonically,” and
that is so difficult to do outside a feuilleton. As usual, the
author has dissected his characters' brains beautifully and
has delightful flashes of humour, but in romance I am an
iron sentimentalist, and, unless there is a suitable princess in
the background, shall justify King Cophetua every time.
It is a refreshing change from the reek of motor omnibuses
and problem novels to the early eighteenth-century repose of
Cousin Hugh (METHUEN), by “Theo Douglas.” Not that
there is any lack of incident in Mrs. H. D. EveRETT's
pleasantly-written story. It is a tale of treason and mystery,
of the surreptitious barter of French prisoners for counter-
feit coin and real old lace and brandy, of sleep-walking and
sudden death, of ghost-impersonation and amateur burglary,
all deftly woven together to form the background of a pretty
old-world love story, which ends as all love stories should.
Mrs. EveRETT has a happy knack of making her places and
people real. I know just what Hugh looked like, and kind
Dr. Fleetwood and his rascally half-brother, and selfish old
Lady Marrable, and sweet Alice North, and I know just
how the river flowed past the Red Deeps, and if only I
knew where red-roofed Loxhall and its twin-town Loxleigh
paused to ask each other and themselves from time to time
“Why did he do it?” I felt more irritated than intrigued.
Even the ultimate solution, though it involved the Philoso-
pher's Stone and the Tree of Knowledge itself, left me com-
paratively cold. However, without the mystery we should
not have had the novel, and I would have put up with a
much worse plot rather than be deprived of so entertaining
a story. Had one found the style of its telling less attractive
and unusual, one might have been more excited about getting
to the end of it.

Of Drake and Duck—there's no mistake
About the ships and shipping part;
Stokeholds and engine-rooms and such
Are open books to MAURICE D.,
And I am bound to say his touch
Has made them quite appeal to me.
Afloat, his writing gets a grip;
You feel the spray across your cheek;
But when the hero leaves his ship
The salt's unsavoured, so to speak;
The strenuous life aside he flings;
He finds a faithless girl to woo,
He writes, he's made M.P.-all things
Which almost anyone could do.

MILK FOR BABES.
To the Parliamentary Correspondent of “The Daily Chronicle."
[Commenting on the suggestion of Lord Hugh Cecil that in order to
check the present criminal waste of the nation's money a resolution
might at least be passed legalising the collection of income-tax, the
Parliamentary Correspondent of The Daily Chronicle makes the follow:
ing observation :-"If the Conservative party had its way the House of
Commons would soon be shorn of all its noblest attributes. The old
sentiment of pride in the House of Commons seems to have perished in
Tory bosoms."] -
STERN moralist, the guide of those in sore doubt
Luminous sign-post on the tricky way
But for whose counsels, liberally poured out,
Our feet infallibly would walk astray–
Surely in your above remarks, dear Sir,
Surely, for once, you err.
Those “noble attributes” that make the glory
Of the great Commons—there are still a few
Which even he, the tough and hardened Tory,
Treats with as much respect as even you;
Of which if Parliament were shorn (or sheared)
His bosom would be queered.
One such there is, conspicuous for its beauty,
Which, with your kind permission, I will name:
It is the high, imperious sense of duty
Which calls on Governments to play the game;
Especially to see at any cost
That Budgets don't get lost.
You'll tell me how the Peers (those bloated nincom-
poops) are to blame for England's empty chest;
Theirs the unique offence if dues on income
Remain in people's pockets by request ;
And May still finds us gathering, in arrear,
The nuts of yesteryear.
I know that parrot-wheeze: it sounds familiar;
At first it seemed a fairly poignant cry,
But, growing sillier by degrees and sillier
As, week by wasted week, the time goes by,
To-day its credit, always rather small,
Is less than none at all.
Twelve months, by customary computation,
Make up a year. One on the polls was spent,
After some six required for explanation
Of what the Budget actually meant;
But where the rest have gone, or hope to go–
That's what I want to know.
My brother-journalist, I shall be happy
To wait your answer; meanwhile let me hint—
Since “noble attributes" are on the tapis—
How I adore simplicity in print;
How well I like your trust, profound, immense,
In others' innocence.
But oh, beware ' The nation's not so guileless;
This England, whom you take to be a fool,
Prefers to have her teaching in a style less
Adapted to an unweaned infants' school;
She's getting quite a big girl now, and knows
l'ar more than you suppose.

“If retreat is impossible for the Ministry, it now obviously is hardly
less easy for the Nationalist leader.”—The Scotsman.
Hardly; in fact we cannot imagine anything less easy to
perform than an impossibility.
BIRD CULTS.
[“Maeterlinck's poetic idea of The Blue Bird for Happiness has been
taken up by a number of clever and well-known women in the worlds
of Literature, Music and Art, who have banded themselves together into
a Dining Club with one object, the Pursuit of Happiness.
The rites and ceremonies practised by the ‘B.ue Birds' at their
meetings are kept a profound secret.
The membership is strictly limited in number, and no man is
permitted to join this feminine freemasonry.”
Circular Letter from Haymarket Theatre.]
Mr. Punch is very happy to be able to announce that the
Blue Birds are not to be alone. Already plans are afoot for
rapidly forming a band of the best gushers among the
women in London society, to be known as the Pink Geese,
who will devote their too considerable leisure to the pro-
motion of Sloppiness. This they will seek and foster in
whatever sphere they may find it, whether music, literature,
the drama, or the social circle. The name of the president
of the Pink Geese is at present, like all their rites and cere-
monies, a profound secret, but doubtless it will be revealed
in time.
News comes also of the Green Owls, a society of learned
ladies who are banded together in a league for the acquire-
ment of culture, or, in other words, Fra Lippo Lippiness.
Where they meet no one outside the charmed circle knows,
but you may tell them by their jargon.
Another coterie of a most exclusive and esoteric type is
that of the Purple Pipits, formed into a luncheon club with
the sole aim of cultivating abject Pipiness. Each member
is bound by the rules of the society to bring her own pipkin
to lunch, at which pipless oranges form a regular feature.
The members are divided into two grades, known as the
Pipians and the Quipians, following the terminology of
CAYLEY, and a variety of quaint ceremonies are practised at
their meetings.
Latest advices from Mayfair describe the foundation by a
number of brainy and well-bred girls of a charming Asso-
ciation called the White Wagtails, who will concentrate their
brilliant talents on the diffusion of unutterable Waggishness.
Animated by a beautiful altruism they will not seek to con-
sume their own gaiety, but are resolved to communicate it as
widely as possible to all classes of the public.
As a protest against the levity of the White Wagtails,
several leading Society women have formed a Club to be
known as the Magenta Magpies. The prime object of this
confraternity is the pursuit of Magpiety, and their rites are
of a deeply devotional character. The name of the Grand
Mistress of the Magenta Magpies has not yet been revealed,
but it is rumoured that she and her troupe will shortly appear
on the boards of a West-End Theatre in order to collect funds
for the education of destitute twins in the mysteries of the
two-step.
In view of the incalculable value of deportment in
modern life, great satisfaction is felt at the public-spirited
action of the ladies who have organised a Dining Club under
the inspiring title of the Fiery Flamingoes. It is their
purpose to cultivate a eupeptic condition by making it a
rule to eat standing on one leg. This beautiful idea has
met with the cordial support of the authoress of The Scarlet
Pimpermel, who has kindly consented to act as Patroness of
the society.
Lastly, we may note the formation of the Incorporated
Society of Iridescent Ibises. This is a body expressly de-
voted to the interests of young girls, and according to the
prospectus will make a point of encouraging Flappiness in
every form.

THE COMING OF THE GROCUS.
“It's a bootiful day again, Sir,” said
my gardener, James, looking in at the
study window.
“Bootiful, James, bootiful,” I said,
as I went on with my work.
“You might almost say as Spring
was here at last, like.”
“Cross your fingers quickly, James,
| and touch wood. Look here, l'll be out
in a minute and give you some orders,
but I'm very busy just now.”
“Thought you'd like to know there's
eleven crocuses in the front garden.”
“Then send them away—we've got
nothing for them.”
“Crocuses,” shouted James.
| I jumped up eagerly, and climbed
| through the window.
“My dear man,” I said, shaking him
warmly by the hand, “this is indeed a
day. Crocuses! And in the front
gar—— on the South lawn' Let us go
and gaze at them.”
There they were—eleven of them. Six
golden ones, four white, and a little
mauve chap.
“This is a triumph for you, James.
It's wonderful. Has anything like this
ever happened to you before?”
“There’ll be some more up to-mor-
row, I won't say as not.”
“Those really are growing, are they 2
You haven't been pushing them in from
the top 2 They were actually born on
the estate?”
“There'll be a fine one in the back
bed soon,” said James proudly.
“In the back—my dear James! In
the spare bed on the North-east terrace,
I suppose you mean. And what have
we in the Dutch Ornamental Garden?”
‘If I has to look after ornamental
gardens and South aspics and all, I
ought to have my salary raised,”
said James, still harping on his one
grievance.
“By all means raise some celery,” I
said coldly. “Take a spade and raise
some for lunch. I shall be only too
delighted.”
“This here isn't the season for celery,
as you know well. This here's the
season for crocuses, as anyone can see if
they use their eyes.”
“James, you're right. Forgive me.
It is no day for quarrelling.”
It was no day for working either.
The sun shone upon the close-cropped
green of the deer park, the sky was blue
above the rose garden, in the tapioca
grove a thrush was singing. I walked
up and down my estate and drunk in
the good fresh air.
“James!” I called to my head gar-
dener. . -
“What is it now?” he grumbled.
“Are there no daffodils, to take the
winds of March with beauty’."
x -
“There's these eleven croc
“But there should be daffodils, too.
Is not this March 2"
“It may be March, but ’tisn't the
time for daffodils—not on three shillings
a week.”
“Do you only get three shillings a
week 2 I thought it was three shillings
an hour.”
“Likely an hour !”
“Ah well, I knew it was three shil-
lings. Do you know, James, in the
Scilly Islands there are fields and fields
and fields of nodding daffodils out now.”
“Lor'!” said James.
“Did you say ‘lor’’
asked suspiciously.
“To think of that now,” said James
cautiously. -
He wandered off to the tapioca grove,
leant against it in thought for a moment,
and came back to me.
“What's wrong with this little bit of
garden—this here park,” he began, “is
the soil. It's no soil for daffodils. Now
what daffodils like is clay.”
“Then for heaven's sake get them
some clay. Spare no expense. Get them
anything they fancy.”
“ It's too alloovial—that's what's
the matter. Too alloovial. Now cro-
cuses like a bit of alloovial. That's
where you have it.”
The matter with James is that he
hasn't enough work to do. The rest of
the staff is so busily employed that it is
hardly ever visible. William, for in-
stance, is occupied entirely with what
I might call the poultry; it is his
duty, in fact, to see that there are
always enough ants' eggs for the gold-
fish. All these prize Leghorns you
hear about are the merest novices com-
pared with William's protégées. Then
John looks after the staggery; Henry
works the coloured fountain; and Peter
paints the peacocks' tails. This keeps
them all busy, but James is for ever
hanging about.
“Almost seems as if they were
yooman,” he said, as we stood and
listened to the rooks.
“Oh, are you there, James? It's a
beautiful day. Who said that first?
I believe you did.”
“Them there rooks always make a
place seem so home-like. Rooks and
crocuses, I say; and you don't want
anything more.”
“Yes; well, if the rooks want to
build in the raspberry canes this year,
let them, James. Don't be inhospitable.”
“Course, some do like to see prim-
roses, I don't say. But——”
“Primroses—I knew there was some-
thing. Where are they 2”
“It's too early for them,” said James
hastily. “You won't get primroses now
before April.”
“Don't say ‘now,' as if it were my
or “liar '2'' I
fault.
earlier 2
Why didn't you plant them
I don't believe you know any
of the tricks of your profession, James.
You never seem to graft anything or
prune anything, and I'm sure you don't
know how to cut a slip. James, why
don't you prune more? Prune now—I
should like to watch you. -
your pruning-hook? You can't possibly
do it with a rake.” -
James spends most of his day with a
rake—sometimes leaning on it, some-
times working with it. The beds are
always beautifully kept. Only the most
hardy annual would dare to poke its
head up and spoil the smooth appearance
of the soil. For those who like circles
and rectangles of unrelieved brown,
James is undoubtedly the man.
As I stood in the sun I had a brilliant
idea.
“James,” I said, “we’ll mark the
croquet lawn this afternoon.”
“You can't play croquet to-day, it's
not warm enough.”
“I don't pay you to argue, but to
obey. At the same time I should like to
point out that I never said I was going
to play croquet. I said that we, meaning
you, would mark the lawn.”
“What's the good of that?”
“Why, to encourage the wonderful
day, of course. Where is your grati-
tude, man 2 Don't you want to do some-
thing to help ? How can we let a day
like this go past without some word of
welcome? Out with the marker and the
mower, and let us hail the passing of
winter.”
James looked at me in disgust.
“Gratitude!” he said indignantly to
heaven. “And there's my eleven crocuses
in the front all a-singing together like
anything on three bob a week!” -

|The stage-directions and descriptions are taken, in a reduced form,
from the printed book of the play.]
- Act I. -
A December night in the County of Bucks, some thirty-five
... miles from London. It is an agricultural district domi-
nated by the village of Arden Constable, which in its turn
is dominated by Arden Court, Major Manifold's residence,
a red brick building in the Georgian style, situated in a
park of a hundred acres, and approached by an avenue
of elms now swaying and creaking in the December
storm. It is 11 o'clock, and the ladies have just retired,
ostensibly to bed, from the drawing-room, while the men
have filtered into the Major's smoking-room. This room
is brilliantly lit with electric light. On its walls are
arranged the ferocious heads of buffaloes, hippopotami,
moose, tigers and giraffes, formerly alive in various
African or Asiatic solitudes, but now consigned by Major
Manifold's rifle and the art of the tazidermist to an in-
(lefinite period of dead and glassy contemplation. Major
Manifold is standing by a table of spirit decanters and
siphons of soda-water. He is a man of forty-two, with
a grizzled moustache, a bald head, an aquiline mose and a
chin denoting a weak sort of obstimacy. Captain Wigram
is sitting in an arm-chair. He may be thirty years old,
and has the unintellectual air of trifling decision ordi-
marily associated with a mounted military career, a pink
complexion, a heavy fair moustache and thin blond hair
irreproachably parted. Mr. Wandeleur has loose lips
and dark whiskers, and is about fifty-three. He is
standing in an aggressive attitude in front of the fire as
though he were crushing a member of the Labour Party
by quoting statistics from a Blue Book. Dr. Bonamy, a
distinguished specialist in merce troubles, is clean-shaved
and abrupt. He appears to be perpetually on the watch
for symptoms, amºl is in good athletic condition in spite
of his sixty years. He is in another armchair.
Manifold. Whisky-and-soda for you, Wigram. Here you
are (he hands it to him). What's your mixture, Vandeleur 2
Vandeleur. Just the least touch of whisky in hot water.
Manifold (heartily). Oh, come. That won't do here. No
temperance men here, you know. Must give you two fingers
of whisky at least. (He gives him the steaming mixture.)
Bonamy, what do you say?
Bonamy. Soda meat, please.
Manifold. That's easily done. You doctors have to keep
your hands steady, I suppose. It's a curious thing, though.
I never stinted myself in liquor and my hand 's always as
steady as a rock. Good constitution, I suppose.
Bomamy (significantly). Ah!
[Wigram looks earnestly at Bonamy, who, unseen by
Manifold, taps his shirt front in the region over the
heart.
Wigram (aside to Bonamy). Bad case?
|Bonamy shakes his head.
Manifold. There now, you're all provided, and we can
have a good talk before we turn in.
[He makes for an armchair and prepares to sit down in
it. As he does so he gives a sharp exclamation of
pawn.
Bonamy. What's the matter? - -
Manifold. Nothing, nothing. A mere touch of rheumatism
in the shoulder-blade. My old wound, you know. I shall
have to get you to overhaul me, Bonamy. We're none of us
so young as we were. That's the sort of thing you begin t
find out when you come to my age.
Vandeleur. Pooh, pooh. What's all this talk about age?
You're a mere boy, Manifold, a mere boy. Personally, I
think we ought to pass an Act forbidding a man to marry
before he's forty. A man under that age hasn't lived.
Bonamy. Why not forbid it altogether at any age? You'd
save any amount of unhappiness.
Wigram. Hear, hear. It’s a mug's game—saving your
presence, of course, Manifold—I mean it’s no manner of use
to a fellow who's got all his life in front of him. There’s a
chap I know in the Bays, a youngster of twenty-five, got
married a year ago, and now he's the father of twins. Well,
there he is, you know. How’s he going to get any hunting
or shooting or anything? He's done, I tell you.
Manifold. Nonsense, Wigram. I can't listen to that sort
of cynical talk. A man isn't a man until he's married. I
thought I knew a lot, and I was always laying down the law,
just like Wigram, but I give you my word of honour I was
a mere fool. - -
Wigram. Freedom for me.
Manifold. Now that's just where you're wrong.
until a man's married that he knows what freedom really is.
Take my own case—
|At this moment the door of the smoking-room opens, and
Mrs. Manifold and Althea Manifold come in. An
air of gentlemanly surprise and pained discomfort
settles upon the male occupants of the room, who all
get up from their chairs. Mrs. Manifold is dressed
in a pink frock, cut low. She has a good deal
of fair fluffy hair, is thirty years young, and
frequently pouts at her husband.
haired, dark-eyed and stormy-looking. She is twenty-
sia, and is Major Manifold's sister by the second
marriage of their father, Lord Justice Manifold,
now deceased.
Manifold (after a few moments of blankness). Why, my
i. I thought you'd gone to bed. What brings you
ere :
Mrs. Manifold. Oh, sit down all of you, do. We're not
going to stay. We thought we'd give you a pleasant little
surprise, didn't we, Althea 2 Oh, do sit down. It's per-
fectly awful to see you all standing up like statues. (They
sit down with an appearance of great reluctance and under
protest.) The fact is, Augustus, I've come for you (she

PUNCH,
MORE THAN MEETS THE
EYE.
THE Parliamentary Correspondent of
The Daily News, writing of a recent
debate, said, “The cheer that greeted
the Liberal leader was long rather than
loud. The cheering of the Commons is
the most varied and expressive music in
the world. It is never the same and it
always means things. The cheer to-
day meant personal loyalty, blended
with certain inevitable misgivings, now
happily removed.”
This is fine analytical work. But I
think the writer must have allowed his
attention to wander as the debate went
on. For he seems to have thrown away
several other opportunities that occurred
of remarking and interpreting the feeling
of the House. To any one gifted with
the true Parliamentary frame of mind it
was an eventful evening. Mr. ASQUITH
had not proceeded very far in his speech
before a smile lit up the faces of his
followers. It was long rather than loud.
Now the smile of the Commons is the
most varied and expressive grin in the
world. It always means things. The
smile that I speak of meant—if you
will believe me—intense personal affec-
tion wedded to sundry overwhelming
sinkings of the heart, subsequently
obliterated. But this was not all. As
the evening wore on a close observer
might have arrived at the conclusion
that one of the Irish Members was asleep.
His -siesta was loud rather than long.
But the slumber of the Commons is the
most varied and wonderful repose in the
world. It means things. On this
occasion—you must take it from me—
it can only have meant a deep personal
devotion, marred by repeated crush-
ing disappointments, eventually assimi-
lated.
While I am in the mood for explaining
things there is another matter that
I should like to draw attention to.
These trifles are so apt to be over-
looked. I refer to the behaviour
of one of the Labour Members, who,
finding that no mention was to be made
of the Budget, grunted. The grunt
was long rather than loud. Indeed, it
was almost inaudible. But I cannot too
earnestly emphasise the great truth that
the grunt of the Commons is the most
varied and expressive utterance in the
world. It means things. This one
meant—curiously enough—a passionate,
almost insensate enthusiasm, tempered
by a barren sense of disillusionment,
which might have done much to counter-
act its influence had it not been wafted
away by the reconciliation of palpable
discrepancies. At least, that is how I
read it.
Of course it must be admitted that it
is only the old Parliamentary hand that

Grannie (after seeing an aeroplane for the first time). “AH, well, This FLYING IN THE AIR

understands these things. Those of us
who are without his peculiar instinct
are bound to miss a lot. For example,
a startling incident occurred towards
the close of the debate, when a
Member on the Opposition benches was
heard to sneeze. It was loud rather
than long. But, though you may find
it rather hard to believe me, the sneeze
of the Commons is the most varied and
expressive spasm in the world. It means
things. Can it have meant in this case
that the hon. Member was sitting in a
draught?

adversary and brings down the curtain.”

Why don't they leave all that to the
stage hands?
We were surprised to read the follow-
ing advertisement in the Buenos Aires
Standard:—
“An English Government requires holiday
engagement for six weeks.”
Really, it has quite as much as it can
take on in England.

WHAT IF THE JIG-SAW
EPIDEMIC SPREADS 3
|NFLUENZA.
IMUST candidly own that occasions I've known
When I rather enjoyed having “flu”;
I recall pleasant days when they urged me to laze
And I'd nothing whatever to do
But to watch the flames leap, half awake, half asleep,
Or to smile when my Abra came up
With some nice chicken broth on a dainty white cloth,
On which she would woo me to sup.
But if Abra, poor dear, should herself become queer,
And retire to her bed for a spell,
While the housemaid and cook have both taken their hook
And there 's no one to answer the bell,
If you find that you are boots-valet-cook-char-
Nurse-doctor-and-patient in one,
While your agonised head simply hankers for bed,
Then “flu" is the poorest of ſun.
If you struggle from town with a tongue that's as brown
And as dry as a bit of old leather,
While your once rosy cheek is as green as a leek
And your knees are both knocking together,
It will make you rejoice when you hear a weak voice
From the bedclothes say, “Soul of my soul!
You are ill?–Well, you can't go to bed—no, you shan't,
Till you've brought up a scuttle of coal.”
Then the dogs come and bark for a walk in the Park,
And their eyes are all hopefully bright:
“Take us out for a run We want cats!
We want fun
We are bored and we spoil for a fight!”
But their tails will drop low when you sadly say, “No!”
And you feel you're a selfish old brute . "
When their confident trust is all turned to disgust
And their joyous ovations fall mute.
What a chill, like a breath from the cold lips of Death,
Seems to strike through your vitals at eight
When you painfully fare down the cold kitchen stair
To tackle the cold kitchen grate. - - -
There are dampers about which you push in and out,
But your pains end in nothing but smºke,
And you creep back to bed rather more than half dead,
Convinced that the “flu” is no joke.
“A candid critic,” says The Daily News, “comes forward
in The British Medical Journal with strong views on the
London matriculation English.” This critic is then quoted
as follows:— - -
“The student is driven to go to the crammer to be taught the slippets
of information which are the stock-in-trade of he who aspires to win the
so called competitions.” -
We can mention one snippet of information which this
writer might well have been taught.

Mrs. ATHERTON on the Englishman, as quoted in
1. The Daily Telegraph:
“He is far and away the most interesting type of the genus homo."
2. The Daily Mail:
“He is far and away the most interesting type of the genius of home."
We prefer the more expensive penny version. -

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Feb. 28.
—Since the days
When Malachi wore the collar of gold
He won from the proud invader,
Irish Members never been so surprised
in their lives. Sitting full of dramatic
turns culminating in one in which they
figured. Some years ago an eminent
French writer was accustomed to con-
tribute to a Paris newspaper a weekly
causerie that came to
be known as his Lum-
dis. PREMIER also has
his Mondays, not quite
so pleasant as SAINT-
BEUVE's. One last week,
when declaration of
Ministerial policy was
followed by mutiny.
Another to-day, when
it falls to his lot to
announce that the tail
has successfully wag-
ged the dog; that
stubbornly cherished
plan of “Budget first.”
has consequently been
abandoned; and that,
as soon as urgent need
of money for starving
Departments is sup-
plied, question of
Veto will be pursued
to end, howsoever
bitter.
Even this surrender
did not revive enthusi-
asm that bubbled over
Ministerial Benches
before PREMIER, in
mood of Benedick, ad-
mitted that, when he
said he would rather
die than forego guaran-
tees, he did not think
he would live to re-
nounce them.
PRINCE ARTIIUR, re-
covered from apathy
of last Monday, made most of oppor-
tunity. Chaffed PREMIER in brightest
style. , Presented entertaining picture
of forlorn Cabinet, at issue upon ques-
tion of House of Lords, striving to reach
compromise that would avoid absolute
break-up. But were they not men and
brethren? Was it for a magnanimous
Qpposition to take advantage of their
dilemma and turn them out on a com-
monplace motion to take time necessary
for voting Supply? Perish the thought!
House chuckled genially at this pre:
sentation of the patriot rising above
Party considerations.
“PRINCE ARTHUR's a child in these
matters,” said the MEMBER FOR SARK.
“But not so infantile as to take a step
which, however tempting, would bring
upon him responsibility of getting
country out of financial mess into which
it has been plunged by reference of
Budget to the country.”
Then came along REDMOND AINé, more
magisterial in manner than ever, with
slight suggestion in pose and arrange-
ment of necktie of recent study of
personal appearance of WARWICK THE
KINGMAKER. Like PRINCE ARTHUR, situ-
ation forces upon him peculiar condi-
tions. Whilst PRINCE ARTHUR whacks

the Government within an incli of their
life, carefully observing limit marked
by necessity of avoiding immediate Dis-
solution, REDMOND AINé, preserving atti-
tude of austere independence varied by
blustering threats, is bound to exert his
utmost power to keep Ministry on its
legs till it has come to grips with House
of Lords on Veto question.
With TIM HEALY sitting watchful on
bench below, he dare not openly display
complete complacence towards Govern-
ment. So he finishes up with threat that
unless categorical pledge is forthcoming
that, if promised Veto Resolution be
rejected by Lords, PREMIER will go to
CROWN asking for guarantees, and failing
them will resign, he will lead his men
into Lobby against Ministerial Resolu-
tion now before the House.
LLOYD GEORGE gave pledge demanded.
Irish Members thereupon retired from
House to consider fresh situation.
|Clock marked a quarter to eight. For
three-quarters of an hour they de-
liberated, finally coming to conclusion
that they would show themselves as
merciful as they were strong. They
would spare the Government yet a
while, refraining from executing their
leader's threat of voting against motion
to give up all time to
the 24th March to
Ministerial business.
Hurrying back to an-
nounce this agreement,
possibly to receive
meed of humble grati-
tude from a Govern-
ment saved as it were
on the steps of the
scaffold, they discover-
ed that a strange thing
had happened. Whilst
they, jealously locked-
in in a Committee -
room upstairs, were
discussing fate of the
Government, lo! it had
been settled. PREMIER's
motion had been car-
ried without a division.
Irish Members came
back to find House in
Committee prosaically
discussing Resolution
authorising Govern-
ment to borrow money.
Business done.—
Another crisis fizzled
out. Four weeks' truce
proclaimed.
Tuesday.—At single
bound Captain Cooper
leapt into position of
prime favourite in
second Parliament of
King Edw ARD THE
SEVENTH. Yesterday
unknown, his name is
spoken to-night at many dinner-tables
in tone of admiration mellowing into
personal affection. Whether achieve-
ment result of accident or design, who
shall say? It does not matter, since
triumph was complete.
Happened in that unexpected manner
not unfamiliar in evolution of notable
events in the Commons. BANBURY much
to the fore lamenting financial chaos
consequent on Lords' rejection of Budget.
Cannot conceal from himself or the
| House that “situation is entirely, directly,
due to four-and-a-half years of Radical
Government.” Pondering this paradº
House got into Committee on S.
mentary Estimates.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PLYMOUTH Ho 1
“When I first put this uniform on.”
(Mr. C. E. Mallet, the new Financial Secretary to the
War Office.)
At this stage Cooper emerged from
obscurity. Interposing, he claimed in-
dulgence for delivery of his maiden
speech. Incidentally he mentioned the
pleasing personal fact that he is the
youngest Irish Member in the House.
Then there was a pause, Cooper visi-
bly growing more aged. Committee sat
silent awaiting the oration. A propos
of nothing, Cooper, drawing himself to-
gether, asked somebody “What steps
are being taken to render the men who
got the land which is being acquired
efficient cultivators?”
Another pause, quite long enough for
anyone who really knew to answer this
riddle. The gallant Captain stood look-
ing round at the Committee. The Com-
mittee sat looking at the Captain. Being
another half-minute older, he resolved
to make clean breast of business. Fact
was, he explained, he had prepared a
most elaborate speech on work of Con-
gested Districts Board.
“I filled it,” he said, “with quotations
from Irish papers and from the Chief
SECRETARY's speeches. But I was told
the vote would not be taken to-day, so I
left the speech on my dressing-room
table.”
Amid murmur of generous sympathy,
warmer by reason of under-current
of satisfaction at escape, gallant
and youthful Captain, manfully
controlling his emotion, resumed
his seat.
“If,” said the SPEAKER when,
progress being reported, he heard
of the incident, “that method of
dealing with a speech were more
common, we should have shorter
sessions and more work to show
for them.”
St. AUGUSTINE did a really nice
thing... Retiring to the Library
and, with that delicate touch that
indicates fine nature, selecting a
sheet of black-edged paper, he
wrote a note to CoopFR saying how
much he would appreciate oppor-
tunity of reading the speech if it
were found intact on the dressing:
table on the Captain's return to
his room.
Episode had such effect on
course of events that by a quarter
to eight the whole of business set
down was accomplished and House
adjourned in time for dinner and
the conversation alluded to.
Business done.—Quite a lot.
| Thursday.--DUDLEY WARD, mak-
ing first appearance as Treasurer
of the Household, stood at Bar,
, bearer of a message from the
KING. Looked very well in his
uniform, carrying in right hand
the wand of ancient office. Called
upon by the SPEAKER, he with
due obeisance advanced to Table,
with clear voice pronounced His MA-
JESTY's satisfaction at the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne.
This sufficiently commonplace. Crisis
arrives when, message delivered, Mer-
cury withdraws. Etiquette forbids the
turning of the back on the SPEAKER.
In present strained relations of two
Houses, any breach would be excep-
tionally resented. Must retire backwards.
Interest of House in this performance
always breathless. Members on both
sides look on as if fate of Empire
depended on successful accomplishment
of manoeuvre. A few paces showed
that DUDLEY WARD was all right. As he
reached first appointed halting - place
and bowed low to Chair, ringing cheer
burst forth, renewed as he unfalteringly
made his way backward as far as the Bar.
Here ordeal is usually completed.
Messenger turns about and walks forth
face foremost. Not so DUDLEY WARD.

THERE is a flower, the lesser celandine,

Its innocence, simplicity; in fine,

That may, as Wordsworth gazes on its

And cause the child to check his happy
race -
And pick a posy for his nurse's hair.
But, after all, there's something else
besides
A flower's appearance:

And this the lesser celandine provides
In such profusion as I wince to tell.

“Mis ALLIANCE.”
“TALK, talk, talk,” says the revolting
young lady in Mr. SHAw's play, after
silently assisting at a protracted sym-
posium on just any subject that oc-
Curred to anybody; “talk, talk, talk,
and nothing ever happens.” I was
with her there, very heartily, for she
reflected, with great accuracy, my own
indignation; but these favourable senti-
ments were modified when she seized

Hypatia Tarleton (Miss Miriam LEw Es) to
Joseph Percival (Mr. CHARLEs BRYANT). “Hand-
some man, chase me in the heather l’’
company to talk at an appalling length
on her own account. Nobody, of course,
can ever be angry with Mr. SHAw, be-
cause he is sueh a dear, ingenuous child,
opening large eyes on the world with
an innocence apparently unqualified by
experience of things as they actually
are. But the trouble is that, like a
spoiled child, he has got into the habit
of taking himself too seriously. He sees
himself as an Institution, and, therefore,
like all established things, a fit subject
for ridicule and burlesque. I don't so
much mind his making merry with the
Bible, for instance, because that kind of
bad taste defeats itself; but I do object
to his treatment of himself as an equally
recognised Institution.
I never found out what the title of
his new play, Misalliance, referred to.
I think it must have been the unholy
wedlock which Mr. SHAw had arranged
between mere dialogue and the stage.
Still, I got a good deal of fun out of the
farcical third Act, though here Mr.
SHAw committed an unforgivable error
in introducing a situation which closely
recalled a recent tragedy in actual life.
The author owed much to the uni-
versal excellence of the performance, in
which nearly everybody said the most
improbable things with a great air of
probability. Mr. LowNE was particularly
happy in his easy transmission of the
sort of paradoxical humour which has
long enjoyed the hallowed sanction of
antiquity; and Miss FLORENCE HAYDON
was admirable, as ever, with her cor-
rective pathos.
THE TRIPLE BILL.
I confess that I prefer Mr. BARRIE in
his moods of fanciful sentiment. The
whimsical habit of thought which is
the great charm of his lighter manner
seems to produce a sense of insecurity
when he deals with terrible things.
Neither the head nor the heart of me
could accept the tragic element in Old
Friends. The reformed drunkard was
sound enough, but his young daughter,
the confirmed dipsomaniac, was (apart
from all question of physiological science)
unbelievable, and so was the mother,
with her vindictive cruelty to the father
who, as the supposed cause of their
child's hereditary taint, has to submit to
a bitter tirade on the subject before the
child's very face. Nor could the old
maxim, here repeated, to the effect that
men often imagine they have conquered
their vices when it is really their vices
that have grown tired of them and left
them, have ever conceivably been applied
to the vice of alcoholism. A more trivial
fault was the insistence with which the
author, by aid of irony and other sugges-
tions, foreshadowed the retribution of
the gods. It made the play (for all its
brevity) drag a little in the scene between
the father (Mr. SYDNEY WALENTINE) and
the rather stagey parson (Mr. HUBERT
HARDEN). There were moments of effec-
tiveness (for which no small credit was
due to the dim light); but the pity and
terror of it all were never purifying,
because one's intellect remained uncon-
vinced. I don't really think it was
worth while to have done it. -
On the other hand, The Twelve-Pound
Look, a half-farcical comedy by the same
Mr. BARRIE, was wholly delightful, and
showed the author in his happiest vein
of genial cynicism. Also it gave Miss
LENA Ashwell her first decent chance in
the Repertory series, and she used it in
the quiet way which suits her manner
and her voice so much the best, if she
would only believe it. Mr. GweNN was
a superb Sir 'Arry, gorgeous in his
contented Philistinism, though, perhaps
excusably, he a little overplayed the
part. The only reflection that I venture
to pass upon this charming sketch is
that, while hinting that the second
wife may one day seek the same relief
as the first, Mr. BARRIE has not thought
of providing her with a similar motive.
The two women have nothing in com-
mon except the fact that they have mar-
ried the same man. The one had no
fear of him, but simply could not toler-
ate the tedious banalities of life with a
too-successful man. The other shows
no sign of this form of annoyance, but
is merely cowed by her husband's
overbearing egoism. If she ever goes
type-writing on her own, it will be with
a different motive for escape, and I think
the motive should have been the same.
But I don't much mind how her face
is going to get “the twelve-pound-look,”
the hunger for stenography-with-free-
dom, because the first wife, in the course
of explaining how she got her own
twelve-pound-look, afforded me just as
much mirth as I was capable of accom-
modating. - - - - -

of the -dialogue. (I except from my
approval the costume of Professor
Spiral, which was more suited to a
mature Corinthian buck than a connois-

play, it was “talk” and nothing “hap-
pened": but such talk; such quality
of phrase; a wit so fine; a gallantry
so lyric In the first scene, where
the humour was less elusive, there
was some very pretty jesting and
exchange of preciosities over the Pro-
fessor's homily on the charms of the
young widow Astraca. Here, too, Miss
JERRold, as the over-married Lyra,
made a most piquant figure, and
Mr. DENNIs EADIE, as Uncle Homeware,
interpreted his part with a nice appre-
ciation of its humour. The dialogue
of the second scene was not so seizable,
and of great distinction—did not make
for clearness; in part because the senti-
partly because its form—blank verse,

ment moved on a higher plane, in an
atmosphere more rarefied; in part, too,
because Miss FAY DAvis (welcome back
to the stage) rather hurried her words.
It must be added regretfully that with
all her charm she was not quite in the
picture. Mr. CHARLEs MAUDE, as her
lover Arden, brought to the delivery of
his lines a very noble quality of voice
and expression.
Altogether, I have to thank Mr.
FROHMAN for a most sporting evening.
If the feelings of some of us were har-
rowed by Old Friends, and our in-
tellects a little strained by The Senti-
mentalists, at least The Twelve-Pound

faces; and I for one have pleasure in
putting “Received with Many Thanks”
to the last two items of The Triple Bill.

SEASONABLE STARVATION.
(With acknowledgments to the Féminine Press
At this season, of course, we are all
studiously careful to keep “the larder
lean, and clean From fat of veals and
sheep,” as dear old HERRick — how
sweetly lavendery the name is — so
quaintly puts it. Asceticism has in-
vaded even the smartest of the smart
restaurants, and to such a length is
principle carried in the fashionable
world that I know of one grande dame
who will not even allow her Pekingese
anything but vegetarian biscuits be-
tween Shrovetide and Easter.

that the matutinal rasher would lie
heavy on the consciences of her guests

ing out for little plats sufficiently morti-
fying to the flesh, yet containing enough
nourishment to prevent actual collapse.
For such I have copied out a few taste-
ful recipes, and which will be well
within the means of the most thrifty.
Cotel ETrE CHANTECLER.—Take a pint
of shrimps. Trim off their whiskers and
slap till tender. Break a dozen golden
eggs, G.W.R. brand, into a saucepan,
and add a piece of butter the size of a
cocoa-nut. Whisk with a whisker. Dump
in a pound of flour. Stir all together.
Slice with a sharp miblick, fry a nice
brown, and score heavily. Sufficient for
one ascetic.
Poulet LLoyd GEORGE.-Bone a chicken
from the nearest hen-roost. Stew till
tender in dry champagne, taking care
to skim off the increment every time it
appears. Set aside the liquor—the flesh,
of course, must not be eaten. Add two
quarts of calipee and twelve large mashed
potatºes. Now have ready some nice
forcemeat. Bake in a fast oven, and
stuff well. (For two persons take double
quantities of each ingredient.)

sensitive consciences may partake of it

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The easiest way to criticise anything is to condemn it
because it is not something else. It would not be difficult,
for instance, to point out by how much The Ball and the
Cross (WELLs GARDNER, DARTON) fails to be this, that and the
other which its author, G. K. CHESTERTON, never intended it
to be. For myself, I should have enjoyed reading it more
had it been pure romance, devoid of symbolism; but Mr.
CHESTERTON would not have enjoyed writing it so much, and
it is his book. I don't think he can ever have enjoyed him-
at any rate like that. But, if you have any affection for
London, you will like his history. Nothing much ever
happens in either, but there is about both a pervading air of
movement and adventure. It is a pity that either the author,
MARKALLERTON, or the publishers, Messrs. METHUEN, could not
have hit on a title less inane than Such and Such Things for
so pleasant a book.
Personally, were I on a secret mission to Peking, and sur-
rounded by rivals anxious to steal my plans, I think that, if
a strange lady fainted attractively on my verandah, I should
at once take steps to change my hotel. Almost certainly, I
should not permit myself to sit in the dark in company
self so much as on this occa- -
sion; towards the end, in fact,
he has quite carried himself
away. For three-quarters of
the book I followed him with
breathless eagerness—for the
last quarter I had to confess
that I was lost; but I was
comforted by the feeling that
probably he was lost too. The
Ball and the Cross, a splendid
mixture of Mr. CHESTERTON's
two enthusiasms, fighting and
religion, tells of the duel
between an Atheist and a
Roman Catholic, and of their
wanderings in search of a
quiet spot in which to finish
their battle. Their adven-
tures are delightful, until they
find themselves in an asylum,
when, as I have said, Mr.
ChESTERTON appears to lose his
grasp of the story. At one
moment, indeed, I had an un-
easy suspicion that he was
working off on me some of
his well-known scorn of the
prison system and the inde-
terminate sentence. I hope
he wasn't. -

Peter Kerr had followed these
simple rules he would have
succeeded better over the af-
fair of the Chinese Railway
Concessions. But, on the
other hand, The Human Cob-
web (MACMILLAN) might never
have been written; and I
should have been genuinely
sorry about that. The Cob-
web that Mr. PUTNAM WEALE
has spun is by no means the
slender affair that its title
suggests; on the contrary, it
is a novel almost, as regards
size, in the antique manner,
and full throughout of the
most interesting and enter-
taining matter. Frankly
speaking, I found the Eng-
lish chapters sometimes a
little tedious, but they are
few, and once Mr. PUTNAM
WEALE lands his hero in
China, amid the cosmopolitan
crowd of diplomatists and
concession-hunters which he
himself obviously knows at
first hand, then the thing
fairly sparkles. Indeed, I
think I have never read a
story of which the local
colour was more vividly
presented; so good is this
that the reader emerges as
from an actual “week-end in
picturesque Peking” for six
rives at Euston or Charing
Cross lusting for a career, bent upon subduing. Pre-
pared to overcome every obstacle, they are all, as was
David Logan, confronted by one least dreamt of but most
insuperable. London offers no obstacle for them to overcome.
There is no resistance; the Londoner is polite and apathetic.
I do not remember seeing this point made before in fiction.
The attitude of the about-to-be-conquered, when it is men-
tioned, usually oscillates between violent opposition and
abject admiration; when not mentioned, I suspect it of being
one of complete indifference, for heroes who condescend to
business careers are generally inhuman, nearly always dull,
hardly ever romantic. Darid Logan has none of these faults.
He has no unfair start in his race for greatness, his progress
never fails to provide amusement, and he has three very
probable but quite unprosaic encounters with the Sex. You
will dislike him personally, for he is stolid and mean. That
was why he got on, and one does not like people who get on,
shillings. It should cer-
tainly stimulate the tourist traffic to so fascinating a spot.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW CHRONOLOGY.
IMPORTANT NEW DEPARTURE By “The
DAILY JEBB.”
THE method of computing time by
reference to the age of some prominent
politician recently outlined in The Daily
Mail in its comments on Lord HALSBURY S
return to the Bench is, we are interested
to learn, about to receive an important
extension. The Daily Mail, it may be
explained, merely confined itself to the
relative method, noting the fact that
Lord HALSBURY became S licitor-General
while Mr. Is AACS was still at school, and
that he was a “silk" of seven years'
standing when Mr. F. E. SMITH, K.C.,
was born.
The system of chronology, however,
which will in future be adopted by The
Daily Jebb (late The Morning Post) has
been drawn up by Mr. FABIAN WARE on
a positive basis, and will be known as
the Jebbian Calendar. Mr. RICHARD JEDB
having been born in the year 1874, which
is taken as the starting-point of the new
era, 1910 now becomes 37 anno Jebbii.
The names of the months will remain
as heretofore, with the exception of
February, which, by Mr. JEBB's gracious
consent, will in future be known as
Jebbuary. At the request of the As-
tronomer-Royal the planet Jupiter has
been rechristened Jebbiter, a name at
once far more euphonious and infinitely
more in accordance with the imperial
destiny of our solar system. Mr. JEBB,
it will not easily be forgotten, was edu-
cated at Marlborough and New College,
Oxford. By a unanimous resolution of
the governing bodies of these two insti-
tutions, it has been decided that they
shall henceforth be known as Jebborough
and Jebb College respectively. (Dr.
SpooxER, the Warden of New College,
we may note parenthetically, has by a
deed poll now assumed the style and
title of PhilojFBB FABIAN SPOONER.)
Funds are being collected by Marl-

NATURE NOTES.
(A little in the manner of too many journalists)
IT is good news that the Zoo has at
last acquired a specimen of the Cactus-
stomached Spandril. The absence of
this animal has for too long been a blot
on the otherwise admirable administra-
tion. A denizen of Rangoon, it is occa-
sionally met with and killed by hunters,
but the natives preserve it on account of
its utility as a destroyer of the deadly
Blue Grease Snake, which it lies upon
and extinguishes. There has been no
Cactus - stomached Spandril in the
Regent's Park reserve since 1863.

The reference in the papers recently
to talking parakeets would suggest that
for these birds to be accomplished in the
way of speech is a rarity. On the con-
trary, I have known scores. The only
thing needful is to begin early with their
training—before the bird is fledged, in
fact. Its vocabulary then comes with
its feathers. I had one in 1901 which
I taught by reading to it every morning
a page of Webster's Unabridged Dic-
tionary. Thus accustomed to the use of
words, it soon put them together, not
always perhaps with perfect discretion
or even propriety, but vastly to the
amusement of my friends.
× * * *
Apropos of birds that talk, I remember
that in the year 1905 I was on board a
steamer bound from Melbourne to Hono-
lulu, when we were followed for about
250 miles by a shark which sang several
selections from ToSTI's operas. I recog-
mised the mellow tones of MELBA, and
CARUso's bell-like tenor; but having
assured myself by marconigram that
both artists were alive and in America
at the time, I came to the conclusion
that the shark had swallowed a gramo-
phone.
+ + + *
Talking of swallowing, it is wonderful
what can be done by practice. I once
kept a tame ostrich, a charming bird,
gentle, kind to children, and altogether
a most delightful companion. At first I
fell it, according to the usual custom,
with broken bottles, coke, and rusty
nails. But after a while it lost its appe-
tite and began to pine away, until some
one suggested my trying the disused
blades of a safety razor. Immediately it
begun to pick up, and in a fortnight was
in the pink of condition. -
+. * + +
Is, a correspondent asks me, a bird in
the hand worth two in the bush 2 The
question opens up a wide prospect. The
late Lord DUNDREARY, a nobleman with
whom I was on terms of some intimacy,
held that if the bird in the hand was a
wobbling redbreast, as he put it, and
the birds in the bush a brace of plump
partridges all ready for the oven, then
the proverbialist was a prevaricator.
But in my opinion the old saying refers
to the advantage that comes from actu-
ally possessing something of even small
value above the possibility of acquiring
greater wealth. In other words, certainty
versus potentiality. This being so, the
proverb is sound.
LAUDER ON THE LINKS.
(Allegro.)
I LovE my brassie,
My bonnie bulger brassie,
It's the finest club that ever yet
W.A.S. Seen.
Over ev'ry bunker sailing
With energy unfailing
It lands my Dunlop deſtly on the
green.
I love my brassie
When the lie is not too grassy,
Or obstructed by the bushes of the
whin,
And escaping altogether
From the pitfall of the heather,
I find my ball is lying by the pin.
(Pensieroso.)
I loathe my brassie, -
For I'm not a BRAID or MASSY—
My handicap's a very bad eighteen—
And I whack the purple heather
For hours and hours together
Without ever getting nearer to the
green.
Yes, I loathe my brassie–
My cleek-shots are not classy,
My putting would demoralize a
dean ;
But for foozling and for fluffing,
For slicing, topping, duffing
My brassie play's the best I've
ever Seen.

“You ser, Mum, I Ain't 'Al' No vote sixcE MY 'usbAND DIEd.”
AT PUT NEY.
WHEN eight strong fellows are out to row,
With a slip of a lad to guide them,
I warrant they'll make the light ship go,
Though the coach on the launch may chide them,
With his “Six, get on to it! Five, you're late!
Don't hurry the slides, and use your weight!
You're bucketing, Bow; and, as to Four,
The sight of his shoulders makes me sore!”
But Stroke has steadied his fiery men,
And the lift on the boat gets stronger;
And the Coxswain suddenly shouts for “Ten'
Reach out to it, longer, longer!"
While the wind and the tide raced hand in hand
The swing of the crew and the pace were grand ;
But now that the two meet face to face
It's buffet and slam and a tortoise-pace
For Hammersmith Bridge has rattled past,
And, oh, but the storm is humming.
The turbulent white steeds gallop fast;
They're tossing their crests and coming.
It's a downright rackety, gusty day,
And the backs of the crew are drenched in spray;
But it’s “Swing, boys, swing till you're deaf and blind,
And you'll beat and baffle the raging wind.”
They have slipped through Barnes; they are round the
bend;
And the chests of the eight are tightening.
“Now spend your strength, if you've strength to spend,
And away with your hands like lightning !
Well rowed "-and the coach is forced to cheer—
“Now stick to it, all, for the post is near!”
And, lo, they stop at the coxswain's call,
With its message of comfort, “Easy all!”
So here's to the sturdy undismayed
Eight men who are bound together
By the faith of the slide and the flashing blade
And the swing and the level feather;
To the deeds they do and the toil they bear;
To the dauntless mind and the will to dare;
And the joyous spirit that makes them one
Till the last fierce stroke of the race is done. R. C. L.
Modesty.

THE POET AND THE BOY.
“Oh, how shall I travel to Arcadie,
The land that the poets sing,
Where the fairies dwell in a flowery dell
And dance in a fairy ring?
“Shall I make my trip in a golden train
With ivory tickets and rainbow steam,
And an engine flying with might and main
That doesn't know how to scream 2
And shall I recline on a silken seat,
With plenty to look at and lots to eat?
Oh, Uncle, Uncle, is that the way?”
“Nay, child, nay.
I've told you once, and I tell you again,
You won't get there if you go by train.”
“But how shall I travel to Arcadie,
The land where the fairies are?
Should I find the way if I went one day
In a wonderful motor-car 2
In a silver car with a crimson hood
And wheels of velvet and sandalwood,
With a horn that murmurs melodious airs,
And a big green bonnet like Auntie wears?
Shall I dash in a flash through the purple dusk
To that halcyon land of bliss,
With odorous petrol of myrrh and musk
And roses and ambergris,
And lamps like a tiger's eyes, that blink
And gleam with a basilisk glow:
Would that be a likelier plan, d' you think?”
“Oh, do what you like, but go!
But I don't mind saying, you won't get far
To Arcadie in a motor-car.”
“But Uncle, Uncle, I wa-ant to know ;
Shall I soar in a big balloon
Like a beautiful shimmering bubble, and——”
“Oh I
Why don't you try the Moon,
Or the shores where the mermaids dip?
You'd find out a way to them just as soon.
Young man, you can take my tip :
This quest of yours is a hopeless case,
For there's no such place—there's no such place.”
“But, Uncle—” “Be quiet, I want to write!”
“But you told us about it yourself last night!”
“I didn't. I'm busy. So don't talk trash.”
“But you did!”——“I didn't!”—“You di-id!”—-‘Oh,
dash!
Come hither, you shrimp, to your uncle's knee
And I'll give you a lesson on Arcadie.
There's an exquisite vale in the Isle of Dreams,
A land where it's always cool,
A lazy land, with meandering streams,
And lilies on every pool,
And the meadows are sunny the whole year round,
And quiet the whole day long,
Except for the dove's low croon and the sound
Of a pipe and a tuneful song;
And that is the song that the shepherds sing
Of lambs and lovers and lasting Spring.
And the winds are fragrant with waſted spice,
And the heavens are always blue,
And it's just a poetical paradise,
Which isn't the place for you !
A poet's paradise, mark you that!
And, whatever a place might be,
If it harboured a little inquisitive brat,
It wouldn't be Arcadie!
And, now you're satisfied, go to bed!
If you don't stop crying, I'll smack your head."
DUM-DUM.
A GLANCE INTO THE FUTURE.
1911. Another General Election. No change in the com-
position of parties, save that Sir GEORGE Doughty is returned
for Pudsey. Country pronounces itself decidedly against
the Budget and Tariff Reform, Free Trade, and the Lords,
Little Englandism and a Big Navy. Mr. Asquith takes a
firm stand–Budget first. But on receiving a resolution
from the Radical Members for Clackmannan, Oxplains that
this really means Veto first. The CHANCELLOR borrows
£100,000,000 at four per cent. Mr. BYLEs created a peer
to terrorise the Lords.
1912. No great change occurs at the annual General
Election. Pudsey returns Mr. BERNARD SHAw. Mr. Asquilii
puts his foot down firmly, and says, “Veto first.” Torch-
light procession from the National Liberal Club to Downing
Street. The CHANCELLOR borrows £80,000,000 at six p r
cent., as no majority can be found for the four-year Budget.
To the consternation of the Peers Mr. CADBURY is created
Lord Bouh Nvil LE.
1913. Interest in the General Election concentrated on
Pudsey—the index constituency. Pudsey returns Mr.
HAROLD Cox. Mr. Asquith says that the time for talking is
over—the time for action has arrived. Banquet at the
National Liberal Club to celebrate this epoch in our history,
CHANCELLOR borrows £40,000,000 at eight per cºnt., and
strikes a deadly blow at the House of Lords by omitting
the salaries of its door-keepers from the estimates.
1914. Great interest in the General Election as the
PREMIER announces that it is to be fought on the Veto
question, and that he will not take office unless this is
settled once for all. Pudsey returns the Rev. R. J.
CAMPBELL. Mr. Asquith retains office, and declares em-
phatically that the six-years Budget must come first. On
cross-examination by Mr. REDMoND, he explains that this
means “first after the Veto.” Congratulatory address pre-
sented to the PREMIER by Mr. Sir As K. Hocking on behalf of
the National Liberal Club. Mr. Lloyd GEORGE reduces the
LoRD CHANCELLOR's salary by half, and this blow at the Peers
proving ineffective borrows £20,000,000 at fifteen per cent.
1915. At the Albert Hall meeting before the General
Election Mr. Asquith declares with emphasis that he will
not hold office for one moment if subject to the humilia-
tions of former years. Pudsey returns Sir HENRY Noſ. MAN.
This is regarded as a sign that the country demands the
Budget first. The PREMIER announces to the House that
their first duty will be to put the finances of the country
in order and that the Budget shall have priority over
everything except the Veto. Bonfires blaze outside the
National Liberal Club. Mr. Lloyd GEORGE borrows £5,000
at eighty per cent. for urgent national purposes—the
payment of the CHANCELLOR of The ExCHEQUER's salary.
1916. Extraordinary migration of people assessed for
Income Tax. Hundreds of people crushed to death at Charing
Cross and Victoria, sinking of six overcrowded Channel
steamers, and downfall of eighty packed aeroplanes.
Address presented to Mr. Asquith by the National Liberal
Club, congratulating him on his patriotic self-denial in not
clinging to office when he had not a majority

[MARch 16, 1910.
A LOST PLAY OF SHAKSPEARE;
OR, The NEw PRELIMINARY PUFF.
SuE was a fairy with three gifts to
bestow on whomsoever she would, and
the first person that she would was an
Author.
He had just been reviewed under the
heading of “The Pertinacious Plagiarist,”
and his heart was heavy withal, for the
reviewer had put an unerring finger
upon his great weakness. He could not
be original. No sooner did he think of
a really strong plot than he found some
other man had already used the idea
long ago.
“Be of good heart,” she told him.
“I have a wondrous gift with which to
help you. Henceforth, when you write
a story, all remembrance of similar
works shall fade from the minds of
men.”
“But,” he objected, “what about the
printed copies of such works? Do you
not know that we live in an age of cheap
reprints?”
“'That,” she replied, “you can safely
leave to us. You write the story and
we do the rest.”
Whereupon he thanked her and em-
barked on the creation of three guineas'-
worth of healthy fiction.
Shortly afterwards, the Fairy called
upon a Journalist. He had just returned
from the first night of a children's play,
and knew exactly how to entertain
fairies. In due course she mentioned
her three giſts and the munificent dona-
tion to the Author, which had been the
first of them.
“My dear girl,” he said in horror,
“do you realise what you have done *
This Author is doubtless an estimable
person, but his work will hardly com-
pensate us for the loss of the World's
Best Books.”
“Surely he does not split his infini-
tives?” she asked anxiously.
“Perhaps not; but that is not every-
thing.”
“Oh, well, don't worry,” she said
soothingly. “You shall have my second
gift, and shall remember what the rest
of the world forgets.”
In the calmer light of the morning
the Journalist dismissed the interview
as a dream, and thought no more of the
matter until a review, in which he
likened the last Surrey drama to King
Lear, was returned with a polite request
that he would abstain from erudite and
unintelligible references. “I’ven I my-
self,” wrote his editor, “am at a loss to
comprehend the allusion to Lear.”
Then he realised what had happened.
The wretched Author had hit upon the
same plot, and a work hitherto deemed
immortal was forgºtten by all the world
save one man. And he, by the way,
had never actually read it.
An endeavour to remedy the mischief
not only seemed a public duty but
offered excellent copy, and within two
hours his article, “Disappearance of
King Lear,” giving the full details of
the fairy's ill-judged charity, was on its
way to the offices of the paper with one
of the largest circulations.
The effect of the article was instan-
taneºus, for everyone was beguiled into
reading it by its taking title. It sounded
so like a Balkan detective story: people
thought of it as the latest (if there is
a latest) Le Queux. The booksellers
throve mightily on the Shakspearean
boom which it produced, and, though
no one could find any evidence of the
existence of King Lear, everybody
profited by reading some of the other
plays.
But with the boom came indignation.
Correspondence poured into the offices of
the paper, a mass meeting in Trafalgar
Square was mooted, and violence to the
Author was being freely hinted at—may,
more than hinted at-when a parti-
cularly sane editorial relieved the
situation.
It pointed out the perils of violence,
since it was by no means certain that
even a fairy's powers would be equal to
undoing the evil, unless she found the
Author intact on her return. “Rather,”
it concluded, “let our esteemed con-
tributor endeavour to get in touch with
his and the Author's lady friend,” and
it offered the use of its Missing Relatives
Column for the purpose.
Through this means the Fairy and the
Journalist were brought together once
more, and he put the facts before her.
“I don't sce that I can do anything,”
she said.
“Can't you take your gift away?”
“That would be very hard on the
Author.”
“It will be much harder,” he told her
grimly, “if my patriotic countrymen rise
up and lynch him. They've already
broken his win 'ows and let in a draught.
Only Actor-Managers are allowed to
tamper with the text of SHAKSPEARE.”
He thought for a while and then
continued : —
“Can't you blot out all recollection of
these unfortunate happenings from the
mind of the Author and everybody else?”
“Including you ?”
“Yes, including me,” he said, rising
to a sublime height of self-sacrifice.
“Don’t you see the injustice of your
gift.” It is robbing the world to benefit
the Author . . . Now, if you can give
him a little real originality as your third
gift . . .”
“I can,” she interrupted, and in a
moment the thing was done.
Look out for the Great New Serial,
by A. N. Author. Something really
fresh in fiction.
AT THE PLAY.
“The MADRAs House.”
It will be a great relief to put the
story of Mr. GRANVILLE BARKER's “comedy
in four Acts” down on paper. The play
began at the Duke of York's at 8 o'clock
last Wednesday, and I seem still to lear
them talking; when I have sorted my
mind out I shall feel better.
Henry and Catherine ll wartable lived at
Denmark Hill with their six daughters.
Henry was in the drapery , business,
having part control of “Roberts and
Huxtable” in a suburb, and “The
Madras House” in the West End.
Philip Madras, another partner and the
son of Constantime Madras the founder
of the business, drops in on the Hua-
tables one Sunday morning with his
friend and colleague, Major Thomas. In
the course of conversation - it appears
that an American has made an offer for
“The Madras House.” This is accepted.
It also appears that a girl in the sub-
urban shop has “got into trouble.” A
Mr. Brigstock is accused, but it turns out
that the guilty man is Constantine, who is
on a temporary visit to England; he had
left his wife for the East a long time
ago, in order to embrace Mahomme-
danism and all that Mahommedanism
allows a man to embrace. Meanwhile
Mrs. Philip had been flirting with Major
Thomas, and our Mr. Windlesham was
introducing into the fashionable world a
new hat made of an inverted fish-basket
encircled by a pair of garters. . . .
Yes, that is the story, and why Mr.
BARKER ever bothered about it I do not
know. Nor do I know why he called it
The Madras House. He might just as
well have called it The Fourth Miss
IIwatable, or Fishbaskets, or The Indis-
cretion of Major Thomas, or anything else
you like. But what it s ould have been
called was Barker on Women—A Debate
in Four Acts, the last one being much too
long; then we should have known where
we were. I was particularly unfortunate
in not knowing where I was, because I
missed the first few moments of the
play; and for two and a-half Acts 1
reproached myself bitterly. All the
missing clues to the plot I placed as
having occurred in those first moments—
a very hot three minutes. Not until the
Third Act did I discover that there was
no plot.
Though The Madras House is not a
play, it might eventually become three
good plays; I would suggest to Messrs.
FROIIMAN and BARRER that this be done
for the next Triple Bill. First Play-
An expansion of Act One, “A Comedy
of the Suburbs”; Second Play–Act
Two and a little of Act Four, “A Tragedy
of the Living-in System”; Third Play–
Part of Act Three, “A Conversation
about Women.” With what eagerness

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I would go to any one of these three
Yet because Mr. BARKER is full of real
ideas and because his people (as played|
by the excellent Repertory Company)
are real people, it was impossible not
to enjoy The Madras House; impossible
not to feel that it was something very
much better than the stage carpentries
which so often pass as leal plays. The
pity is that Mr. BARKER was not strong
enough to control his ideas; he has let
them carry him very far from the promise
of The Voysey Inheritance.
Of the players it would be enough to
say that all were excellent; but I think
! must pick out Miss MARY JERRold and
Messrs. E. W. GARDEN, DENNIs EADIE and
CHARLES MAUDE as the best. And even
that leaves me with a dozen others whom
I should like to mention by name. Most
of them only appear in one Act each;
well, they will have greater opportunities
when my suggestion for the new Triple
Bill is adopted.

The shadow of your rampart high
On afternoons when hill-tops blend
Their blue with sister blue of sky,

That in the middle distance stand
Are little Pictish moorlanders,
A painted, cautious, skin-clad band,
That creep and crouch in slow retreat,
And watch, with flint-tipped dart on
string,
The Legion's skirmishers that beat
Methodically through the ling;
While by the river's broken banks
Again the sun's aglint upon
The Eagles, and the ordered ranks,
Behind their tall centurion.
They fade; and now each ragged spruce
Becomes a dhuimewassal stern
Who goes to strike a blow for BRUCE
And break a spear at Bannockburn.

The while he gazes o'er the shaws

“Yes, SIR.”
“No, Sir ; BUT You Li, see it on his door.”
You've seen the ruffian side of things,
Fights grimly settled man to man,
Red cattle-raids and moss-troopings,
The robber, and the cateran.
And yet perhaps most crude, you'll find,
Of all you've watched go down the
Pass,
Are those to-day who leave behind
Their sandwich papers on your grass.
An Explanation.
The Vicar of SouthEND writes to Mr.
Punch to point out that the paragraph
in last week's number which referred to
his (the Vicar's) alleged offer to newly
married couples was based on a mis-
understanding. The Vicar did not de-
finitely promise an indefinite wedding
present to those whom he united, but
promised generally one particular pre-
sent—to wit, a missionary box. Although ||
this offer was only made to the newly-
wed Mr. Punch has no doubt that the
Vicar of SouthEND would be glad to send
equally good missionary boxes to any
single ladies and gentlemen who would
undertake to fill and return them.

DEAR MRs. GREEN, -I find I have still
that most interesting book, Parabola of

so kindly lent me. I intend to return
it on Sunday next, as I have nothing to
do on that day. I will bring it round

DEAR MRS. GREEN, -I must confess I
think it is a pity to consign so valuable
a book to the rough usage of the mere

damage that it may suffer will not, I
hope, be put down to me nor prevent
your lending me another book to help
me pass away my unoccupied Sunday.

DEAR JAMES,--Are you lunching any-
where on Sunday next? If so, I will
lunch with you.

DEAR MRs. PERKs, I know you are

DEAR Mrs. JENks,—My laundry having
adopted a dull grey tint which, if un-

than put you to the trouble of writing
me a letter, I will just drop in for a

DEAR MRs. PERRs, Let me accept with
pleasure. It is most kind of you to ask
me to make a day of it. I am not High
Church, and by no means insist on
playing games on Sunday. I make a
principle of neither working nor playing
on Sunday.
II. .
DEAR MRS, JENKS,--I am most annoyed
at having to cancel our engagement for
Sunday. The truth is that I have a
sudden access of work that will keep
me hard at it all Sunday. So full are
my chambers of briefs that there is
barely room for me, and the ever-
increasing queue of solicitors waiting
outside for consultations threatens at
every moment to create a breach of the
peace. Moreover, on second thoughts I
begin to like the grey tint of my linen,
if only for its originality. . . .
P.S.–I am not certain how one spells
“cue,” but feel that I have made two
very good attempts, one of which must
be right.
III.
DEAR JAMEs, OLD MAN,+Of course I
meant it as an invitation. You didn't think
I was cadging, did you? Unfortunately,
however, it is all off owing to an im-
portunate aunt in the country. But I
insist on your coming and taking a little

am able to sit up and take a little

DEAR MRS. GREEN, -Thanks very much

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.

This makes the
more noble attitude
assumed to - might
by House of Lords
in connection with
Budget. Situation
was described by
LoRD CHANCELLOR in
course of debate.
“We are,” he
said, “in a very
lamentable financial
condition, and the
country has to suffer
for it. How was it
created 2 It was
created wholly and
solely by the un-
precedented and, as
I think, constitu-

this House by throw-
ing out the Budget

their so-called sin 2 No, Sir. They
turn upon the Government and the
majority in Commons, and with wither-
ing indignation denounce their conduct
in not immediately setting aside all other
business (including question of Lords'
adverbs apart, that
is plain statement
of historical fact.
The Budget being
hung up (as if it were a leg of
mutton), the Exchequer is empty.
Daily necessities of Departments have to
be met by borrowing, at a cost to tax-
payer, CRomER estimates, equal to £1,200

ing this unparalleled situation noble
lords have for weeks and mºnths been

by mischievously smiling countenances

“The finest conception of high comedy

cheer. Unfortunately in excitement of
moment Gilhooly started too soon. The
rest hurried up, but never succeeded in
achieving fulness of chorus. Seemed to
be all shouting for different men. Effect
rather comical than impressive. Never-
theless Redmondites knew what it por-
tended, and trembled in their shoes.
To-day fresh panic seized them when,
questions on paper disposed of, O'BRIEN
interposed with one of which he said he
had given PREMIER private notice. Hush
of expectancy fell over House. What
was to the fore now 2 About William
O'BRIEN's appearance, his voice and
manner there is a touch of the tragic
that invests even the commonplace with
awe. Tradition records how Mrs. SIDDONs,
having at a repast been served by mis-
take with unsolicited refreshment, turned
upon the servant and remarked, “I said
beer, boy.” According to testimony of
those present, effect of voice, of gesture
and flash of eye, whilst flattening out
the erring servant, created unforgettable
impression upon the guests. O'BRIEN's
ejaculation of the ordinary phrase, “Mr.
SPEAKER,” sends thrill through nerves of
least sensitive.
“When I look at him and hear his
voice,” said SARK, “I recall leading
character in the Pirate of the Porous
Deep, a moving drama cherished in
childhood. Only, somehow, whilst in
appearance living up to suggestion of
the character, O'BRIEN subtly manages
to convey impression that he is a re-
formed Pirate. No more sanscullotteism
for him. Fully garbed, gravely spec-
tacled, grey-bearded, deep-voiced, he in
these later days essays to personify the
wrong s and woes of Ireland, chiefly con-
tri uted to by John REDMOND. That
hapless Irishman has concentrated upon
him all the suspicion and hatred that
a quarter of a century ago simmered
round the rugged figure of Buckshot
FoſtSTER.”
Question this afternoon seemed at
first sight unconnected with his country-
men on back bench. Ostensibly related
to operation of Irish Land Act of
last year.
O'BRIEN with SPEAKER's tacit permission
conducted somewhat prolonged debate
with PREMIER on working of Act; As-
QUITH remaining steadfast in refusal to
give day for discussing it, the seething
SHEEHAN flashed torchlight on real object
of episode.
“Is this decision,” he sternly asked,
“the result of an interview with Mr.
John REDMOND?”
Ha! that was it. Whilst PREMIER sat
with folded arms in guilty silence, the
Eleven of All Ireland, temporarily over-
coming hoarseness, stuidently cheered.
Business done.—Got into Committee
on Army Estimates.
Thursday.—Undeterred by threaten-
ing Resolutions, undismayed by prospect
of enforced self-reform, House of Lords
continues to assert its domination of
the Commons. Has heard something
of alleged disposition of NAPOLEON B.
HALDANE to avoid appearance of con-
densation in remarks on current topics.
On Monday GEORGE WYNDHAM delicately
alluded to the matter when he congratu-
lated him on having occupied only two
hours in exposition of army Estimates.

WASTED LAVA.
Mr. Ramsay Macdona'd in full eruption,
tearing passion to tatters with his accustomed
transpontine vehemence, was blissfully un-
conscious, of the effect of his oratory on Mr.
Joseph King, of North Somerset.
Certainly N. Bonaparte HALDANE in
his public addresses is wont to exceed
length of bulletins of his famed proto-
type. But that is no more an affair of
the House of Lords than is the Budget.
Yet by carefully planned, nicely timed
manoeuvre it managed to bring to un-
timely close brief speech just opening.
It was in reply to question about
pension drawn by disabled gunner. Had
just completed introductory sketch of
progress of gunnery since the Siege of
Sebastopol, was proceeding to enlarge
on the status of the gunner then and
now, when enter BLACK Rod with message
from the Lords “desiring attendance of
this hon. House” at the business of a
Royal Commission. In the middle of a
sentence, nay halfway through a sylla-
ble, N. B. H. stopped and sat back on
Treasury Bench speechless, what time
the SPEAKER, escorted by SERGEANT-AT-
ARMs bearing Mace shoulder high, pro-
ceeded to obey the summons.
As far as immediate effect was con-
cerned, it must be admitted the strategy
was successful. But it is not the sort
of thing to soothe growing feeling of
irritation between the two Houses.

Fair form and fairer face.

declared himself elected, while the Lord Mayor
gave his casting vote for Councillor O'Flynn,
and declared that gentleman elected. An
attempt was then made to go on with the
business of the Public Health Committe, but
owing to the confusion and disorder which pre-
vailed the proceedings came to an abrupt end."
It was up to Councillor O'FlyNN to
straighten things out. He should have
given his casting vote for Sir Edward,

“WELL, are we going to do a charade?”
said Gerald suddenly, in the drawing-
room after dinner.
“Guess again,” I suggested.
“Come on, it's great fun. You'll
come, won't you, Miss Sanders? And
you, Mary 2 Four—that will be enough ;
we can do anything with four.”
“Yes, we could play Bridge,” I said
wistfully.
“Nonsense. Come on.”
And so we found ourselves in the hall.
“I don't know if we play it the same
way as everybody else,” said Gerald.
“You take any well-known person or
place you like, say Nero * *
“But I don't like Nero —he was a
bad man.”
“And then you do each letter in turn.

“Nebuchadnezzar,” I suggested.
“That would take all night.”
“And we can't spell it. We want a
short, easy one.”
“Jehu,” I tried again.
“Why Jehu ?”
“I don't know; it just came to me,”
I said modestly.
“All right—Jehu.

“John,” said Mary. “Signing Magna
Charta. Or Joan of Arc. I'll be Joan.”
“I’ll be the Arc. I mean, what about
Jason, and Gerald can be the Golden
Fleece 2''
“Jack and Jill,” suggested Gerald.
“That's too easy,” I said. “And too
wet. No, I've got a brilliant idea—
Jamshyd.”
There was an anxious silence.
“Which of the many incidents in his
crowded and notorious life shall we
represent?” asked Mary at last.
“There is only one—
“They say the lion and the lizard keep
The º: where Jamshyd gloried and drank
(leep.
I thought that if I were a lion perhaps
Mary wouldn't mind being a lizard with
me, and then Gerald could glory and
drink deep for all he was worth. Miss
Sanders would be the attendant who
hands him the foaming bowl.”
“That's splendid. How do you glory,
by the way? I've almost forgotten. It's
such a long time since I did it.”
“Oh, you just – glory,” explained
Mary. “Oo-oo-oo-ooh 1–like that.”
“We ought to do it in two scenes,
really. You two go in and glory first,
and then the curtain falls to denote the
“Now
Now then, what
passing of a few hundred years, during
which the audience are requested to
remain in their seats. Then Mary and
I come in and keep the courts.”
It was a great performance. I was
the best lion outside Regent's Park,
pretty well, but Mary was a little too
much on one note as the lizard. Of
course, if you knew she was being a
lizard, then I can quite see that she was
a good lizard, but anyone not in the
secret might have admired her equally
as a Channel swimmer. Of Gerald's
glorying it is impossible to speak too
highly.
“E,” said Gerald, in the hall again,
as he put down the loving-cup. “No,
I’ve drunk it all, old friend. What
shall we do for E 2''
“There are all the Edwards. Let's
do Edward VII.”
“Isn't that contempt of court, or
something?”
“Endymion,” I said. “He was kissed
by Selene. I thought we might do
that scene. . . . Any competition for
Selene? . . . No rush at all.”
“ Endymion,” said Miss Sanders
so freezingly that I felt quite cold,
“was a very beautiful youth.”
“Let’s be Etukishook,” I said, with
a shiver, “ or Little Eva, or—— ”
“Etukishook—good idea. I'll be
Cook.”
“Like Gerald to take the fat part,”
said Mary. “Will you be the last dog,
or the North Pole?” she asked Miss
Sanders. - - -
Miss Sanders, who is rather tall, de-
cided to be the North Pole. At the last
moment I threw up the part of the
faithful Etuk for that of the dying
hound. They are much alike, but I act
better on four legs. -
“H,” said Gerald, when we had dis-
covered the Pole. “There 's Hercules.”
“And there's Hobbs,” said Mary.
“He’s really been more in the public
eye lately.”
“Hamlet. ‘’Tis not alone me inky
cerloak, good mawther.' I saw an inky
cloak somewhere.”
“Hero and Leander,”
Sanders.
“They'd think it was Holbein and
the keeper of the Calais lighthouse,” I
objected. “Some people are so dull.
What about Hengler ? Then Mary and
I could be animals again. We can keep
on coming in as different ones.”
Hengler was a great success. Gerald
played the name part with a whip and an
eyeglass—obviously Hengler to the life.
I was in turn an elephant, a land crab,
and a white ant. Mary was a lizard
again (she ſancies herself at this appa-
rently), a humming bird, and Mrs.
Hengler. Miss Sanders thought it was
rather silly, but didn't mind being a
flamingo. She was a perfect flamingo.
said Miss
“Una,” we all said, as soon as we were
outside again. “That's the only one.”
“Except Ulysses and Uncle Tom's
Cabin,” we added.
“We could do Ulysses all night,” said
Gerald. “He was simply made for this
game. Let's do something harder.
Una's the boy. I'll be St. George.”
Well, there we were. Mary, of course,
with her weakness for reptiles, was the
Dragon, I was the Lion, and Miss
Sanders was Una. It was a spirited
scene, not at all marred by the fact that
we were all rather vague as to the plot.
The great point to bring out, it seemed
to me, was the docility of the Lion. I
was very docile.
“Now we’d better do Jehu himself,”
said Gerald, “ or they'll never guess.”
“They're bound to guess if we do,”
said Mary. “Can't we make it awfully
diſficult 2' -
“Jehu drove furiously,” I said. “I’ll
be Jessop, Mary is Strudwick, Gerald
is Lees, and Miss Sanders is in the deep.
Then I'll drive like anything. That
might give them a hint, which is all
they want.”
* + * +
“Splendid,” said Mrs. Gerald, when
we had brushed our hair and come in
again.
“Did you all guess?”
“Oh, rather. Kent, of course.”
We looked at each other blankly.
“The first,” went on Mrs. Gerald,
innocently, “was Miss Kellerman, the
swimmer.”
“I told you so,” I murmured to
Mary.
“The next was Etukishook.”
“I’m glad you guessed that,” said
Mary. “That was me.”
“The third was Noah; and the fourth
Thomas à Becket.”
“How — how did you guess the
fourth 2 ” I asked.
“You, chiefly. The penitent king,
| after Becket had been murdered. You
looked so penitent; it was a delightful
bit of acting.”
(Penitent, indeed! Can't they re-
cognise docility when they see it?)
“And the last of all,” said Mrs.
Gerald, “was of course obvious. You
were Hutchings.”
Do you know, I think it was that that
hurt me most. My numerous lions and
Mary's lizards may be misunderstood;
well, let them go. But that a grown-up
person should be unable to distinguish
between Jessop and Hutchings at the
wicket—--
“Yes,” we all said sadly, “it was
Kent.” A. A. M.

THE FIRST FLIGHT.
WHILE there's one on his feet with a tale to repeat, and
another is sampling a drink,
The eager First Flight have a girth to draw tight and a
chain to let out by a link;
While the boisterous laugh in that circle of chaff the opening
music has drowned,
You will hear the First Flight as they whisper, “That's
right!” to the note of a favourite hound.
When a holloa makes sure that his flight is secure and
dispels every doubt of a run,
When the crowd gallops straight to the obvious gate with
the latch that is never undone,
You will see the First Flight cram a topper on tight, catch a
willing old nag by the head,
And, clapping on sail at the blackthorn or rail, take the line
of the robber in red.
They thunder away over stubble and clay, over roots or the
level o lea,
The gallant First Flight that are soon out of sight while the
slow ones are sadly at sea.
The crash of a rail in the deep of the vale is to them but a
matter of mirth,
And the avalanche fall of a hoof-rattled wall but the merriest
music on earth. -
There are gaps, there are gates, for the coward who waits;
there are roads for the fellow who fears;
Not to left nor to right go the gallant First Flight, save to
veer with the chase as it veers.
No field has a fence so dark-looming and dense, or a rail
so unyielding and stout
But if once the First Flight have got in it all right you may
trust them to find a way out.
Now the men who ride first may be frequently cursed as
they press on the faltering pack,
But we’re all of us loth to pull up for an oath when it comes
from a field or two back,
And the Master may blame and the jealous declaim, but the
weakest must go to the wall,
And it's plain the First Flight have the premier right if the
hounds may be hustled at all !
Come, drink with me, then, to the big-hearted men who have
pluck to sit down and go straight!
Whether farmer or squire, may they keep out of wire and
be spared a lift home on a gate!
Fill your glasses to-night to the gallant First Flight! Let
us wish them the luck of the line,
And to-morrow's recall to the best game of all and the wind
that is better than wine!

THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is a hard thing to lose one's cherished romances, but
harder still to have one's favourite bugbears destroyed; and
this latter blow I have very narrowly escaped in the case of
WillIAM of ORANGE. I never liked the fellow, I don't know
why, but four-fifths of MARJoR1E BowFN's I Will Maintain
(METHUEN) had made me a red-hot convert to the House of
Nassau, and I was on the point of breaking my pen and
handing it respectfully to JAMES THE SECOND when the terrible
deaths of John and CoRNELIUS DE WITT (whom the Stadt-
holder could easily have saved) opportunely damped my
enthusiasm. The authoress of The Viper of Milan has
accomplished a great deal in this book, and possibly
attempted a little too much. She has written, entirely
without love interest, an historical romance that is absolutely
thrilling (wait till -
It's packed with gert good sense and wit,
Like those he've written back along;
JAN MURRAY be a-zellin' it,
And I should zay it's goin' strong.
The loss of an election is always due to the bribery
practised by the other side. Similarly, when our dis-
tinguished amateurs take to the stage, they fail only because
of the jealousy of the Profession and the chicanery of agents.
This I take to be the suggestion of HoRACE W. C. NewTE in
Calico Jack (Mills AND Boon). “Calico Jack,” Miss Cellini,
Lilly and others are mere “pros.,” panto and legitimate.
Their merits are few and accidental, their faults overwhelming
and innate. Gisburne and Susie are gentlefolk (the latter
“surrounded by an intoxicating atmosphere of amorous-
ness”) driven on to the boards by force of circumstance.
Their virtues are glaring, their only failing an excess of
loyalty and unselfishness. Together these all experience
you come to the part
where they open the
dykes), and the con-
trast of the splendid
pride of the young
prince with republi-
can idealism on one
side, and the swag-
gering insolence of
the French and
English Courts on
the other, is very
finely maintained (to

take the rough with the smooth and do much to add to the
cheeriness of things: I own to an intense dislike for the
giſted amateur, usually a tiresome creature who has all the
fun and none of the hardship and does everything to exhaust
the pocket and patience of the all-important play-goer. Mr.
NEWTE, however, thinks differently.
“As we expected, the release of the deportees is considered to be a
‘sop in the pan" by a certain section of opinion in Bengal.”—Indian
Daily Telegraph.
It should never be forgotten that a sop in the pan is
worth two in the bush, besides being a mere fleabite in
the ocean.
“Oh! how vividly I remembered my conversation with the bride-
groom who was a mere lad of five years. I queried him ‘My dear,
why do you marry so soon?" At this he looked liquet at me, and
letored in a shrill tone, ‘Why what the devil do you m an by sº ch
a nonsensical query? I must marry 7 I must Lave a wife.’"–Lahore,
Tribune.
It was rather soon, but we don't wonder he looked piquet,
rather than let the lady look old maid.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
a nature lover, Perilla is a
NATURE FOR NATURE's SAKE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am aware that
you have kept pace with your con-
temporaries in giving to the world an
occasional column of “Nature Notes,”
but are you sure that they have been
| written in the right spirit 2 Do you
look upon the subject from the correct
point of view? Are you really kind to
dumb creatures, or have you not rather,
on the contrary, still some pitiful,
sneaking regard for human convenience
in this connection ?
In the event of your conscience Smit-
ing you at all in the matter, Perilla and
I would be glad to offer ourselves as the
humble instruments by whose means
a nobler gospel could be promulgated
from time to time in your pages. I am
him from the cornice before we went
to bed.
Retrieving is one of the keenest of
the pleasures one derives from animals.
If Perilla yearns in summer to show the
tortoise to a friend, the five minutes
which I get in the nasturtium tangle
under the monkey-puzzle makes spilli-
kins seem comparatively tame; whilst,
in the event of disappointment there,
the corner where you squeeze between
the laurels in your clean flannels is
certain to produce a result of some kind.
I never grudge the time spent in this
pursuit, for, as Perilla says, the only
real thrill you get from a tortoise is in
finding him, and, as she has invariably
gone back into the house before this
happens, I get the thrill all to myself,
and can furthermore take the first
command and blind to the proximity
of fragile articles—she can still enjoy
her nights in the servants' bedroom,
to which her raucous snuffle and
stertorous sleep have necessitated her
relegation. -
In insects I must admit one failure.
We secured a number of cockroaches
with our lease, but they did not answer:
they never learnt to come to me, and
Perilla never learnt to go to them. They
are almost the only animals we have
ever had which did not worship the
ground Perilla trod upon, but this may
have been partly because she never trod
on the ground at all if she thought
there was one within sight.
I hope I have said enough to convince
you of our fitness to expound the
humane in terms of the relative unim-
nature maniac, and our friends
consider us both in this respect
perfect naturals. We start,
therefore, mentally well
equipped for the crusade, and
my immediatedbjectin writing
this letter is to satisfy you
that we have also the neces-
sary experience.
I may say, then, that I have
always been devoted to ani-
mals. So has Perilla. Perhaps
I like them best in the right
place, and Perilla in the
wrong, but the distinction is
trifling, and, at any rate, the
result is animals everywhere—
which is just what the curate
said when he fell over the
mastiff on to the hedghog
merely because the porcupine
brushed against his leg in the
garden. Our garden is not
large, and Perilla always fret-

portance of the merely hu-
man; and I subscribe myself,
Yours to command,
LUCAN LovEITT.
THE B E A R - G A R D EN
THAT I LOVE.
THE house is full of Teddy
bears;
They creep upon me unawares;
They catch my feet upon the
mat
And make me think I've
squashed the cat;
‘I sit upon them during meals
And shiver at their long-
drawn squeals;
I find them in my bed at
night,
But luckily they never bite.
The house is full of woolly
rabbits; -
One never masters all their
ted lest we were keeping the
young emu short of exercise; but to me
it seemed to sprint over the flowerbeds
with frequency and zest, whilst the way
in which it habitually ran at and chased
the small boy who brought the gar-
dener's dinner was enough in itself to
acquit us of any such charge of incon-
siderateness.
And talking of emus reminds me of
Reckitts, our blue-tit, who is so tame he
will bathe in the slop-basin at breakfast
and shake himself over the omelette
afterwards; but Perilla did not of
course succeed in training him to this all
at once. “If you only keep quite still
for long enough,” she had said on the
first morning she opened his cage, “you
can get any wild thing to come to you.”
Presumably a short December day did
not afford the requisite scope, for I
remember it was not Perilla's immo-
bility, marked though that was, but a
butterfly net and an acrobatic feat of
my own which ultimately retrieved
step to another by losing him again at
Once.
We have several dogs, but none, I
can assert, whose dispositions have been
spoiled by repression. Even the mastiff,
under a promise which I made to Perilla
when she first purchased him at the
Dogs' Home because he was suffer-
ing from rickets, is never confined to
the yard, but has the run of the drive—
or at least, if he is in high spirits, he
and the more timorous of our visitors
have the run of it between them. Our
terriers impress everybody with their
implicit trust in mankind, and the
manner in which they will fearlessly
leap into the laps of afternoon callers
who are balancing their tea and cake,
is a standing testimonial to the humanity
of our methods. Perilla never spares
trouble with her pets, and by unremit-
ting care we have kept our dachshund
to a phenomenal old age, in which—
though in the daytime she is deaf to
habits;
They seem to have their little holes
In sofa-backs and china bowls;
I find them in the queerest places
With woolly smiles upon their faces,
But they are quiet as a mouse
And gentle-mannered in the house.
The house is full of golliwogs
In rather loud and baggy togs.
They follow me with button eyes
Unbuttoned in a mild surprise.
Their hair is black and very sleek;
They always seem about to speak,
But change their minds when I come by
And fix me with that button eye.
The house is full of funny things,
And every week some new one brings;
I'm never certain in the least
When I may meet some savage beast.
But though I growl a lot about them,
I couldn't bear to do without them;
For all these bits of rag and fur
Are tried and trusted friends to Her.
WOL. Cxxxviii.

s 'E's WANTED FOR Thi
HINTS TO HOUSE-BUNTERS.
By an obvious Amateur.
At this season of the year many
people are looking out for new homes
to move into at the approaching quarter-
day. It is hoped that to those who are
unable to afford the advice of a qualified
surveyor the following hints may be of
Some use:-
1. Avoid a house which advertises
“Ancient Lights.” They may be pic-
turesque, but they are sure to lead to
litigation in the long run.
2. Never think of taking a house
with “Dilapidations.” Tell the landlord
that you propose to bring your own and
ask him to remove his.
3. Make a careful note of the thick-
ness of the walls, more especially if the
house is one of a row. Where your
prospective neighbours are in the habit
of giving parties, an extra thick, or
“Party Wall,” as it is called, is essential.
4. Beware of “Picturesque Rough-
cast Villas." Remember what Siſk-
speARE says about jerry-built villas,
“rough-cast them how we may.”
5. If you are a lover of dogs and
purpose taking your pets with you to
your new home, make a point of ascer-
taining whether the walls have ever
had “distemper.”
6. Never take a “beautiful Eliza-
bethan half-timbered house” without
first ascertaining what the other half is.
7. Do not be allured by the house
which is advertised to be “within a
stone's-throw of the station.” Most rail-
way companies have now a by-law against
this pastime, and charge 40s. per shot.

Sardines.'”
“Moscow.—Hotel, BERLIN. – English home

Chastened Youth.
The Globe is responsible for the fol-
lowing statement:—“It is further pro-
posed, in conjunction with the Board of
Agriculture, to encourage the breeding
of horses suitable for Army purposes,
and to buy the foals at three years old
instead of four. These are steps in the
right direction, and are to be com-
mended.” We understand that the War
Office has decided also not to purchase
calves for the food supply of the Army
at a younger age than four years, nor
lambs younger than three years. It is
also in contemplation that no boys shall
be taken into the Government Service at
a lower age than thirty-five.
“Any Member may at any time determine
his Membership by notice in writing to that
effect, sent to the Secretary not later than the
thirty-first day of December in any year.”
This is “By-Law 14” of the Society of
Chemical Industry. By-Law 15 certainly
ought to announce the granting o"
day's grace in leap years.

THE PoliticAL SITUATION.
(By our Special Correspondent underneath the
Mace)
The political situation is increasing
every day. Although it is now certain
that the Budget, as such, is dead, it is
possible that the Veto, as which, may
survive. If this is so we shall see some
very interesting developments shortly.
The crucial date will be May 13, when
Supply gives out. Thereafter the pro-
gramme is expected to be as follows:–
May 14. No money for the Civil
Service. Indignation meeting at Post
Office. Rising of the Parcel Bangers.
Massing of the Postcard Readers.
May 16. Somerset House in arms. The
Inland Revenue Irregulars mobilise.
Forced march to Gaiety Restaurant.
May 17. Mr. Asquiſh refused safe-
guards, guarantees, injunctions, rules
nisi, and statu quo's. Resignation of
the Government. Mr. BALFourt sent for.
May 18. Mr. BALFour refuses to take
office; Mr. REDMosd sent for. Mr. RED-
Mond refuses to take office. Mr. HAROLD
Cox sent for. Mr. GARVIN sent for.
Lord Northcliff E sent for. Mr. C. A.
PEARSoN sent for. Mr. L. J. MANSE sent
for. Mr. MAXSE reſuses to take office.
May 19. Deadlocks.
May 20. The Grand Army of Civil
Servants muster in Trafalgar Square.
After interval for usual siesta they march
upon Downing Street. Mr. HALDANE
captured by a detachment of Telegraph
Boy Scouts and held for ransom.
May 21. Mr. Asquith r ceives parcel
containing Mr. HALDANE's ear. Unfortu-
mately there is twopence to pay upon it.
Mr. Asquirii is greatly shocked and
consents to assume office again.
May 23. Dissolution of Parliament.
Should events shape themselves after
this fashion our readers will know what
to expect. As far as can be seen there
are only two ways out of the threatened
deadlock. One is that the House of
Lords should hastily pass a Home Rule
Bill, and the other is that the Govern-
ment should introduce a large and
comprehensive scheme of Tariff Reform.
Where To Go Fort IIIE EASTER Holidays.
Such a variety of places innmediately
suggest themselves to the eager tourist
in need of rest that it may safely be said
that the choice becomes harder every
year. Owing to the enterprise of our
great railway companies many places
formerly out of reach of the week-ender
are now within easy distance. Penzance
on the Cornish Riviera, Weymouth or
(as it is generally called) the English
Naples, the Northern Nice (Blackpool),
the British Vienna (Sheffield), and the
Palestine of the West (Maida Wale) may
all be reached by the holiday-maker in
a minimum of time.
A glance at our advertisement columns
will reveal to the reader the opportuni-
ties for a pleasant stay at these and
other delightful spots which are now
placed at his disposal. We might, for
instance, call attention to the promise of
comfort contained in this:
“SouthEND.— Board res. Jib. tab. bſh. pno.
cnry. sth. asp. inc. tims. Th. to Tu. crt. extr.
mgufe. wws.-Mrs. Hggns. Wverst.”
Without wishing to influence our
readers' minds unfairly, we feel it our
duty nevertheless to point out that,
should a holiday at the delightful re-
sort of Southend be meditated, Mrs.
Higgins (or Huggins) of Wavecrest
appears to offer a boundless hospitality.
Take this again :

How delightful to be made so wel-
come, even after the comparatively
short journev in the luxurious carriages
of the South-Eastern and Chatham
Railway! (see p. 7).
TIIE UNIVERSITY BOAT RACE.
To-day for the 395th time repre-
sentative crews of the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge will meet in
friendly rivalry on the historic course
from Putney to Mortlake. The race has
not always been rowed upon this course
—indeed upon one occasion it was from
Mortlake to Putney, but the spirit of
good sportsmanship has always been
the same. Our “special correspondent
under the thwarts” sums up the chances
of the respective crews in another
column (another nine columns, to be
exact), and all we need say here upon that
point is that two more evenly-matched
eights have not been seen upon the
Tliames since the last occasion. We
append statistics of the race for the last
few years, together with some interesting
facts about some of the crews.

Some Interesting Facts. -:
One of the most notable Oxford crews
was that of 1732, all the members of
which ultimately sat on the Bench :
with the exception of the cox, who ſell
overboard during the race, never re-
covered the entire use of his faculties,
and eventually became a Bishop.
A curious coincidence occurred in the
historic race of 1806. “Seven '' in the
Oxford boat was twenty-one years old
(3x7), had seven letters in his Christian
name (Herbert), and eventually married
a Miss Isabel Wordsworth, said to have
been a relation of the WoRDsworth who
wrote that famous poem, “We are
Seven.” What makes it more remark-
able is that this athlete only obtained his
seat in the boat at the very last moment.
LATEST FROM THE Lobby.

Party’ in the House of Commons, con-
sisting of Messrs. Asquith, A. J. BALFour,

Mr. O'BRIEN.
Pergola Surveyor and Warden of the
Sponge–Mr. BELIOc.
Keeper of the Cutlets—Mr. BARNEs.
Cover Point—Mr. BALFour.
Though they do not propose to take
any action at present which may embar-
ra-s their leaders, they will at the same
time keep a sharp eye upon the situation.

Tell me the blushing thoughts you dream
There by the Irwell's silvery torrent:
Why do you flout the pagan fair
Whereon our halls of music batten,
Why did you spurn the millionaire
And place your feet upon a PATTEN ?
Is it perchance (as I divine)
That filled with equal rage you view it,
When mortals overstep the line,
And when they merely underdo it?
Is it your aim to steer between
The twofold vice, and practise what'll
Exactly fit the golden mean
So much admired by ARISIOTLE2
Thus when the living statue stooped
(Compare the ads.) to aid our culture,
You not unnaturally swooped
Down on the notion like a vulture:
Art you adored in any guise;
With none at all it seemed improper,
And so you veiled averted eyes
From marble hoax and classic hopper.
Not otherwise you deem the man
Who, fearless of the frown of Nemesis,
Collars and pinches all he can,
Meet to be hooted off the premises:
You mobbed the Transatlantic bull
Who hoped, maybe, to corner cotton,
Showing your intellectual pull
O'er Liverpool (where life is roºten)!
This is the purely moral side:
But all things have commercial issues,
The best of creeds may be applied
To raw materials and tissues:
And types that make the market mad
No doubt inspire the selfsame loathing
In spots that spin, as those whose fad
Is chucking up all kinds of clothing.

IN the very far beginning, when our fathers lived in caves,
And the glacier rolled and shuddered where to-day you
roll the lawn,
Then the forests and the rivers, and the mountains and the

Were the haunts of troll and kelpie, gnome, pishogue and
leprechaun; -
Long ago—oh, long ago,
Little feet went to and fro
In the hushed and solemn moonrise, or the silence of the
dawn, - *
Weren’t they just the prowling otter or the fox-cub or
the fawn 2
If the panting hunters plodded on the hairy mammoth's
trail, - --
Till the flint-tipped lances laid him in the twilight stiff and
stark, - - * - -
If the yelling tribesmen lingered at the stranding of the
whale
Till the sledges were benighted in the demon-haunted
dark, • * *
Each untutored scalp would rise
At mysterious woodland cries,
And they’d glance across their shoulders, with a shudder
and a “Hark!” - - -
Though 'twas probably the screech-owl or some startled
roebuck's bark!
If the neolithic lover in a neolithic June
Met at nightfall, 'neath the hawthorn bough, a neolithic
maid, - -
Then, despite the ministrations of a full and friendly moon,
As it caught the clumps of blossom in a net of light and
shade,
They would hear with knocking knees,
Come a kind of grunting wheeze,
For they'd think some spook had spied them, and their
cheeks would match their jade,
But they never saw the badger rooting truffles in the glade!
Go you out along the chalk downs, and you'll see our fathers

With your rod inside its cover and your cast around your

When the beetles boom like bullets, and the bats are hawking

And the night is in the meadows, and the mists are on the

Past some darkling belt of pine,
While you've felt all up your spine
Run a sort of icy shiver, and your heart's gone pit-a-pat—

CONTEMPT.
DEAR SIR JAMES,-Forgive me making a guess at it, but,
during the fifty-seven seconds over which our acquaintance,
I might almost say our intimacy, extended, I had not the
opportunity of enquiring what actual name your god-parents
had originally deemed most suited to your peculiar merits.
If I have made a bad shot and you do not like the “James,”
I feel that you cannot but be flattered by the “Sir.”
It was, you will remember, at the Booking Office of the
Charing Cross Underground Station at about 7.15 P.M. on
March 18 that we ran or rather walked up against each
other. Over that booking office there are the words “IN.”
and “out,” and I confess freely that I, with some six other
intending passengers had entered by the “out" side and
showed every sign of going out by the “IN.” side. You alone
were entering by the “IN.” side and passing out by the “out"
side. You alone were gloriously and monumentally right.
You were, I think, putting yourself to unnecessary exertion
in trying to compel me to pass out by what was at any rate
the unfashionable, though technically correct, way. Confess,
in your cooler and less florid moments, that, whether the
credit be due to the elasticity of the barrier or to the adapt-
ability of my—shall I say diaphragm 2—I performed a
notable feat in forcing my mere 10 st. 5 lbs. past your 13
stone odd.
Now let me explain my motives. Firstly, on general
grounds, I am a member of a large but not incorporated
society pledged to resent actively all deeds of public inter-
ference committed by fussy middle-aged gentlemen who, we
feel sure, have no other qualification for managing other
people's business Save that they have grossly mismanaged
their own. Secondly, I am by profession a barrister, and
have been informed and verily believe that I must get into
the habit of not being bounced by anybody, whether I am
in the right or in the wrong. Thirdly, lastly and most
importantly, I believe and hope that you were a judge.
. Even in my very short and insignificant career I have
suffered sufficient snubs and rebuffs from the Bench to
make me long for the opportunity of meeting a judge in
an open field and no favour. Had I been in a position to
see less of your back and more of your face, I could have
spoken with more certainty as to your judgeship, but there
was ample evidence of it in your manner of commanding me
and never doubting but that I should obey you unquestion-
Ing. My Lord, I could then and there have addressed to
you a learned argument directed to the point that in
Underground Railway Stations you had no jurisdiction, that
you were functus officio, that you were almost that thing
which you are so fond of calling other people, a man of
straw. I could have whispered, “Ultra vires 1’’ in your ear
in such jocular tone as would have made your blood boil
over. . I think I did better than that merely by flouting
silently but deliberately your order and making you wish–
you!—that you had the judicial powers and authority of a
mere railway inspector. Though you spoilt my shirt-front
and did not improve my left lung, though I appeared to the
bystanders to be something of an ass, I feel that as between
judge and counsel, counsel is avenged.
In my young breast I cherish much satisfaction and two
distinct hopes—one, that you appreciated then and will
never forget that if I was squashed physically, you were
squashed morally; the other, that at the decisive moment
you saw as little to recognise of me as I did of you, and that
that little is the part that will be hidden by my wig when I
next have the honour and misfortune to appear before you
in the High Court, or in whatever Court (if any) you control.
I subscribe myself, if your lordship pleases,
Yours, till our next merry meeting,
JUNIoR NATU MINIMUS.

TACTICS.
The gentle reader is asked to understand that one morning. IIarold, haring been orer-corrected, ran away from home in order to
teach his parents a lesson; but, with the approach of night, he changed his mind and slunk back, reckoning on a fine fatted-calf welcome.
To his disgust his absence has not been noticed, and after some thou
remarking, “I see You've still Got The same old cAT.”
ght he draws attention to his desperate and disciplinary measure by
SELF-PHOTOGRAPHY.
“With a new portrait of Mr. Shaw, photo-
graphed by himself."—From a Publisher's
Adrertisement. - - - -
'The famous playwright entered the
famous photographer's room, and, stand-
; before a mirror, began to chat with
III]. - -
“I am beginning to think it is time
for me to have another portrait taken,”
he said.
“I certainly think so,” said the
photographer. “Some of the public
would like it, and the rest ought to like
it; and you know as well as I do that
it pays to give the public what it wants
and what it ought to want.”
“There is nºthing in the world that
accomplishes that end so successfully as
SHAW. Whether on the platform or on
the stage, or on the printed page, give
them Shaw; and when they're tired of
listening to SHAw and reading Shaw,
let them look at SHAw.”
“But I do not like to think they
weary of listening to and reading me,”
said the famous author-dramatist.
“Anyhow, it won't do any harm to
“t out a new portrait for them to look
at. And, by Mephistopheles! it is a face
worth looking at,"—and the famous
photographer gazed admiringly at his
vis-à-vis, turning his head and moving
his position to cateh different aspects of
his features. “My boy” (it should be
explained that the photographer was on
the best of terms with the playwright),
“it is a face in ten million. Let me
photograph it ! A splendid idea—a
great man photographed by a great
man | Won't that fetch the Shavians !”
The dramatist smiled at the notion,
then briskly assented, helping with the
Camera.
“Now, I wonder whether it would be
best, for once, to assume a natural pose,'
mused the eminent photographer.
“No ; on the whole, I think an un-
natural one suits me, and will please
the Shavians better,” was the opinion of
the other.
The camera was ready. The distin-
guished playwright was again before the
mirror practising varieties of facial ex-
pression. “Please look as unpleasant
as possible,” was the injunction of the
photographer; and when an expression
suitably weird was found, the popular
author hurried to the chair before the
strange light in his eye died away.
The ball was pressed, the pneumatic
shutter did its work, and the great
author-dramatist shook hands with him-
self—I mean with the photographer—
congratulating him on the achievement
of another scoop.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March 14.
— Nothing less like a lonely furrow
could be conceived than appearance of
House to-night when RoseBERY, quitting
his seat on Cross Bench, advanced to
the Table. The red leather benches,
ordinarily a wilderness with here and
there a rose in person of a stray peer,
thronged to fullest capacity. Bright
eyes rained influence from side galleries
whence Peeresses looked down. The
Commons fought for places in congested
districts allotted to them in corners of
Gallery over the Bar. Steps of Throne
flooded with Privy Councillors. The
brilliant scene presented striking testi-
mony to a commanding personality. Only
RoSEBERY could have created it. Since
the MARKISS passed away he is sole
possessor of magic wand whose waving
draws together eager multitude to House
of Lords.
His theme was reformation of what is
distantly alluded to as the Second
Chamber. Whilst majority of Com-
mons are eager and resolved to depose
the Lords from position of supremacy,
Rosh BERY would have them put their
House in order with their own hands.
To that end proposes abolition

The SACRiricial, KNIFE.
Lord Rosebery. “Well, it's plain that we're
Pretly unpopular in some quarters, so there is
no help for it—some of YOU chaps have got
of heredity. A
bold suggestion to
make in its very
stronghold. Noble
lords of Victorian
era shake their
heads in grave dis-
sent. What is to
become of the
country if they,
their sons and
heirs, no longer
assist at moulding
its destinies? HALs-
BURY has great es-
teem for RoseBERY,
more especially
when he engales in
active opposition to
policy of former
Cabinet colleagues.
But blue blood (in
this respect only),
like murder, will
Out.
Alluding to re-
commendations of
Select Committee
appointed two
years ago, RosebERY
described them as unanimous and spon-
taneous in favour of abolition of heredit-
ary right to sit in Parliament.
“Not unanimous,” growled HALSBURY,
from front bench before which the
apostle of hara-kiri stood. RosBBERY
lastened to make reparation.
“My noble and learned friend,” he
said, “a valued member of the Com-
mittee, opposed all our proceedings with-
out any exception whatever.”
HALSBURY glowed with just pride
at this tribute to his high character.
Bad enough for inheritors of the posi-
tion of the Saxon Witenagemot, “de-
scendants of the men who wrung the
Charter from John on the plains of
Runnymede,” to be threatened with dis-
establishment. Too much to have it
stated that he, Baron HALSBURY, Wiscount
TIVERTON, Constable of Launceston Castle,
had been accessory to anything favour-
ing such Revolution. RoSEBERY's prompt
disclaimer, his adroit adulation, smoothed
over what threatened to develop into
angry incident. Thenceforward HALS-
BURY suffered in silence outburst of
her, sy that threatened to undermine
foundations of ancient Constitution.
Most significant feature of situation
was the chilling reception of magnificent
speech. During earlier portions, de-
voted to scornful treatment of Minis-
terial plans in respect to Veto, cheers
were frequent from overflowing Oppo-
sition benches. When it came to re-
commendation of specific Resolutions,
enthusiasm subsided. After speaking
for two hours, the orator concluded
to go!”
Hamid faint tribute of applause, which
a more perfectly impartial political tribunal than myself!
No “HARA-KIRI " For IHIM
Lord Halsbury. “Why, if you tried for a century you couldn't produce
Sayonara !”
subtly conveyed acknowledgment of
intellectual pleasure received as distinct
from approval of the cause pleaded.
Business done.--Lord RoseBERY pro-
poses Resolutions for reform of House
of Lords on basis of abolition of
Hereditary Right to sit and vote.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—ANEURIN
Williams is still new to Westminster,
coming hither for first time at General
Election. That event fruitful in
WILLIAMSEs. Six bear the honoured
name. But there is only one ANEURIN,
and the SPEAKER, who knows most
things, is not certain how to pronounce
the word or what it means when uttered.
When, as happened to-day, he has to
call upon the Member for Plymouth, he
judiciously hedges, naming him “Mr. A.
WILLIAMS.”
A great occasion for ANEURIN. Has
balloted for place with scores of others.
Chances at least twenty to one against
his turning up in group of most favoured
three. Anyhow will see the business
through. Finds a seat on furthest
Cross Bench. Favourable position for
viewing the scene. Whilst others flank
it, he commands it. Almost immedia'ely
faces the SPEAKER. Can look down the
parted hosts—Liberals to left of him,
Unionists to right of him—with absolute
impartiality. Wouldn't be at all a bad
thing, now all corner seats are appro-
priat, d, to mark this one as his own.
(Forgets, or never knew, that being
beyond the Bar it is technically out of
the House. No Member seated there
may catch the SPEAKER's eye, nor, rising
thence, may address him.)

slept for two nights in his house”—(Laughter)—“and he was proud of the fact"—(More
laughter.)
. “It was just as well to remember what was written of him by a great historian,
namely, that he could govern neither with nor without Parliaments"—(Laughter).
Ballot opened. Clerk at Table thrusts
land in lucky bag containing numera-
tion of Members taking part in it.
Calls out the figure from first paper
abstracted. The SPEAKER holds in hand
a list of Members balloting, each num-
bered. At second dip into lucky bag,
out comes number corresponding with
that attached to name of Member for
Plymouth. It was then the SPEAKER
called upon “Mr. A. WiLLIAMs.”
With a start ANEURIN jumped up ;
hastily produced from breast pocket a
scrap of paper.
“I beg leave to give notice—” he
said in the profoundest bass voice that
ever rumbled through the reformed
Parliament.
Instantly half-a-dozen brawny arms
thrust him forth from Cross Bench.
Would enquire later into meaning of
this outrage. Meanwhile must get
along with business. Standing outside
the Cross Bench a good stride in rear
of the Bar, he began in basso more pro-
fondo than before,
Lord Ribblesdale in the IHouse of Lords.)
“I beg leave to give—”
Straightway found himself bodily
bundled across the Bar. Voices ex-
plained to dazed ear that he was out of
bounds and out of Order. Anyhow he
was safe now. Steadying himself with
left hand on back of Front Cross Bench,
he, in voice that began to show signs of
breaking down, began again. “I beg
leave to——”
Once more there was a rush. A
Member seated on Front Bench below
Gangway in proximity to Cross Bench
hastily surrendered his place, and before
ANEURIN knew where he was he found
himself standing by it. His third
attempt to address the Chair had been
made from space outside the thin red
line beyond which Members addressing
the SPEAKER may not stray.
Really safe at last; no mistake about
it this time. Mopping his brow, casting
hurried glance behind as one who did
not know what a moment might bring
forth, ANEURIN spread out the crumpled
paper on which his notice was written
and began for fourth time his recita-
tion.
Lo! a strange thing happened. Next
to interest in watching the gymnastic
process by which the new Member was
brought into ordered line, lookers-on
were struck by remarkable profundity
of voice in which fragmentary sentence
was declaimed. Now it heard quite
another voice, a faltering falsetto, a
piping treble, remark: “I beg leave to
give notice that upon this day fortnight
I will move a Resolution in favour of a
more perfect representation of electors
in this House and other public bodies.”
Business dome.—McKENNA, after able
fight, deſeats by rattling majority the

House where such eccentricity of moder-

The noble Baronet has beaten the
record. Sudden eruption the more
striking since it comes from unexpected
quarter. A busy man of affairs, con-
stitutionally modest, the MEMBER FOR
Bosworth Field rarely thrusts himself
upon attention of House. Confines him-
self to speaking on subjects of which he
is master. On such occasions is equally
lucid, considerably briefer, than was his
illustrious uncle, John BRIGHT. All of a
sudden, without other notice than is
imposed by Standing Orders, he de-

arms literally full of Bills, for which he
asks first reading.
A glance down the list suggests that
they are designed as component parts of
a woman's Magna Charta. When they
are added to the Statute Book, Woman,
single or married, will be delivered from
that galling, worse than Eastern, condi-
tion of inequality under which, as we
all know, she labours. She will find
herself elevated to the legal and social
status of a man and a brother.
PREMIER feels his position a little em-
barrassing. Has declared several times
that, pending settlement of Veto question
with the Lords, he cannot promise to
introduce legislation on any subject.
And here is a Private Member bringing
in at single sitting no fewer than nine
Bills of far-reaching consequence.
Business done.—Lords decide to go
into Committee on RosebERY's Resolu-
tions. HALSBURY, in delightful speech
overflowing with unconscious humour,
remarked, “I am concerned at present
to show that in voting for the noble
Earl's propositins I am not committing
myself to any one of them.”
INDIVIDUALISM.
[“Modern conditions have created a keen
Socialistic movement. We are all agreed that
riches are not so fairly distributed as we should
like, but all present are agreed that the kind of
di-tribution some people propose is not one on
which any society can exist.”—Mr. HARold Cox.]
0 reader, I approach with stealth
| The trite but touchy topic “wealth.”
I, pulling up my poet's socks,
Proclaim the praise of Mister Cox.
I dot my p's and cross my q's,
And advocate Childe HAROLD's views.
I thump my tub and shake my fist
And cry, “I am no Socialist.”
You ask me, Sir, to tell you why?
“I don't,” you say. “You do,” say I.
You need not smeer: you need not scoff,
You simply cannot put me off.
Don't yawn or look the other way.
Be kindly good enough to say:—
“With Socialism there would be
More wealth for you: more wealth for
Ime.
“The present state of things is such
That neither of us have as much
As we should like.” I tell you flat
I have no fault to find with that.
I'm open, I admit, to more,
For wealth's a thing which I adore.
It’s when you press for more for Us
That I presume to make a fuss.
The object which I have in view
Is more for me but less for you.

MUSICAL NOTES.
THE immense success of Elektra and
the triumphant vindication of the prin-
ciples it embodies has encouraged the
composer and librettist to take another
momentous step in the emancipation of
the lyric drama from the fetters of an
effete formalism. We understand that
Hugo von Hofmannsthal has already com-
pleted his new version of Othello, and
that STRAUSS has sketched out his score,
which the great modern Greek critic,
Pó8‘pros Makaupiðns, pronounces to be the
resemble the splendid simians whom
they will be privileged to simulate. But
it is the earnest and confident hope of
both composer and librettist that in a
very short time it will be possible to
have the opera entirely performed by
animals. In this hope they are strongly
encouraged by Professor GARNER, who is
at present conducting some interesting
experiments with a view to teaching
baboons how to play the double-bass.
The volume of sound which Professor
GARNER's pupils already produce is quite
most magnificent piece of *
—l round the world, and on three sepa-
meeting a vote of censure was unani-
mously passed ag, inst Mr. HENRY J.
Wood for the “monstrous obscurant-
ism” displayed by him in framing the
programme of the last Symphony Com-
cert, which was entirely devoted to the
compositions of “the Bonn impostor”—
that being the title by which BEETHoven
is habitually referred to by membels of
the Society.
Mr. BAMBERGER, the famous pianist, is
shortly about to publish his reminis-
cences. As he has more than once been
that the world has ever known.
How just this criticism is will be
readily admitted when it is stated
that in the new version Othello is not
a man at all. He is a colossal gorilla.
Desdemona is a superb chimpanzee,
and Iago is a supple and sinuous
orang-utan. Again, in Hugo von
Hofmannsthal's improved rendering
of ShakspeaRE's crude and uncon-
vincing narrative the play ends in a
tremendous fight between Othello and
Iago, in which the latter is torn
literally limb from limb and the bits
are scattered not only over the stage
but throughout the auditorium. The
episode of the suffocation of Desde-
mona is quite superbly repulsive.
Indeed, in the happy phrase of Dr.
Schweinfleisch, of Munich, “anything
more magnificently beastly it is im-
possible to imagine.”
The text of the libretto marks a
most astonishing advance upon any-
thing that even Hugo von Hofmanns-
thal has yet perpetrated With a
view to getting down to the absolute
bedrock of elemental passion, he has
eliminated all inteligible phrases or
words, and confined himself exclu-
sively to phonetic transliterations of
rate occasions has been captured by
cannibals, his book ought to contain
much appetising reading.
“PURPLE, GREEN AND WHITE.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I think politics
are silly things, and I don't want a
vote; but in spite of that, the way I
have been forced into touch with the
Suffragettes lately has been most
painful, and might have ended in
tragedy but for the intervention of
the public. To start from the begin-
ning, I must tell you that being
always hard up and short of credit,
I can only afford one toilette at a
time, and have to wear that or
nothing till next quarter. My spring
costume, however, was quite chic—
one of the new foulards, you know,
shot with emerald and amethyst,
with a broad knee band and back
panel of blue and white violets em-
broidered on eau-de-nil cashmere-de-
soie. You can guess how duckie it
looked; but you can hardly picture
my misery when, wherever I went,
my own sex shrank from me, while
the other one glared at me with re-
pugnant curiosity, and the street boys,
almost without exception, shouted,
“Votes for Women” when I passed,
the bellowings, howlings, trumpet-
ings, snortings, squealings of wild
ONE of the things which the SPRING weathen
WiLL REMOWe From OUR ACHING WISION.
and I realised, too late, that my cos-
tume was a subtle manifestation of
animals as recorded by him at
various zoological gardens and mena-
geries. ---
By the kind permission of Mr.
Zamrock, the eminent music publisher,
we are enabled to present our readers
with two lines which, in the opinion of
STRAUSs, are the most beautiful and
inspiring that he has ever heard:—
Gach Udeluchuma! Jabelubeli,
Amawacker, lauten, sthlafunas, slelethcarriu !
They form the climax of the touching
scene in which, after dilaniating Iago,
Othello execrates ShakspeaRE for blacken-
ing his (Othello's) character as well as
his complexion.
As at present arranged, the parts will
be played by human beings, made up to
remarkable, owing to the prodigious
strength of their arms, and is likely to
satisfy even Strauss's exorbitant demands
for intensity and sonority of tone. Human
performers on wind instruments have
always been unsatisfactory owing to
their lack of lung power. Experiments
are accordingly being conducted by Mr.
FRANK T. BULLEN, who for some time
past has been engaged in instructing a
school of right-whales how to blow tubas,
double-bassoons, saxophones, sarruso-
phones, dinosaurophenes, and other in-
struments of tympanoplectic enormity.
We are informed by the Secretary of
the Anti-Beethoven Society that the
membership has enormously increased
during the past month. At the last
Suffragette opinions in purple, green
and white.
I bore it for three days, then I kept
indoors and wrote an account of my
impossible position to our leading daily
paper. Whether the public most wished
to relieve a deserving case or to show
their antagonism to the Suffragette move-
ment, I cannot say. What I do know
is, that I have received fifteen new
frocks from unkrown sympathisers, and
I hope you will let me say, through the
medium of your columns, that I don't
want any more, as I've no pegs left to
hang them on, and to add, in your
private ear only, that though purple,
green and white may be unpopular
colours, I at least owe them, indirectly,
a debt of gratitude.
Yours sincerely, “Stock Size.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PULP 1
OUR readers are, we trust, alive to the
extraordinary change which is to be ob-
served between the paper on which the
present issue of Punch is printed and
that in use hitherto. With the aid of a
magnifying glass of quite ordinary power
they will see that the new paper con-
tains a fibre totally distinct from that
of the old. Sensitive fingers and thumbs
will also detect a marked difference in
surface texture. In fact, it is a new
paper; Punch, for the first time in its
history, is being printed on a product
of the woods instead of a product of
rags. Heretofore we have at great
expense used a paper manufactured
solely from the old clothes of peers.
But times are changing; peers are
becoming out of date; and we have
now fallen into line with other journals
and acquired forests of our own.
At first we tried to get an island,
and our special commissioners examined
and reported upon enough of these
things to make an archipelago. But in
the end we purchased an immense tract
of land in the neighbourhood of Punches-
town, in Ireland, and at once set about
planting it with trees. Here again was
a difficulty: what tree to plant? The
spruce, the larch, the Norwegian pine,
the Beerbohm, the Christmas tree—all
came under the attention of experts.
The araucaria, or monkey-puzzler, was
con-idered too, but dismissed as being
disrespectful to our readers; the chest-
nut was discarded as offering too easy
an opening to this world's Plowdens.
In the end the plane-tree won it, partly
because we want to be unambiguous and
crystal clear, and not a little because
Punch is not coloured.
The next thing was to secure the
rapid growth of the plantation, and this
was done quite easily by rubbing into
the roots day and night the world-
famous preparation “Grohare,” so fami-
liar on our hoardings.
It is, indeed, a romantic story—that
of the progress of the tree to the copy
of Punch in your hand. The felling,
the hauling, the sawing, the pulping—
all are processes which deserve treat-
ment from eloquent pens, and get it.
We have at this moment an army of
descriptive writers and photographers
hard at work at Punchestown doing
their best; and the results will be
terrific.
But this is not all. No journal of
to-day can leave the matter there. We
are not only makers of paper, but
ameliorators of the lot of woodmen and
pulpers, carters and clerks, the sailors
who make the perilous voyage across the
Irish Channel bearing our precious com-
modity, the railway men who have to
get it to Bouverie Street, the people who
|

Sadie. “Do TELL Us The JAPANESE for “How Do You Do,” MR. KATSU.”
(Noise like foot being pulled out of swamp.)
Sadie. “ARE You sure ?”
see it pass by—in fact, everyone. This
revolution in paper has also made a
revolution in our character: we are now
philanthropical busybodies. We have
built Institutes and Reading-rooms,
Lecture Halls and Athenaeums (golly, what
buildings!), gymnasia and swimming
baths. We have a staff of lecturers and
instructors, a football ground and a
polo ground, a Bridge Club, and several
restaurants. There is nothing that we
deny our pulpers, for we know that the
man who pulps the forest rules the
world.
Some of these details may strike the
reader as superfluous, but we assure
him that experience teaches that this is
a subject on which no amount of trum-
pet-blowing is de trop; and we are
making arrangements for a much wider
publicity of what the peers, not un-
naturally, call our “high treeson,”
by means of supplements to the illus-
trated papers, animated photographs,
and so forth. The world, in short,
cannot be too much instructed in the
art of paper-making. It has got to
listen.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Camera Adventures in the African Wilds is the title of a
thirty-shilling book, published by HEINEMANN, beautifully
printed and got up, and illustrated by the most wonderful
photographs imaginable. Observe, for instance, the rhino-
ceros on page 6. He was “snapped at a distance of fifteen
feet in the act of charging the author and his companion.”
When vou look at him, his tail and ears well up, you will be
thankful that you were somewhere else at the time. “Hippo-
potamus and a crocodile” is another cheery picture; and so
is the flashlight photograph of a lioness, taken when she was
facing the camera, and only ten yards away from it. The
intrepid author and photographer (if anyone so far from the
Pole may be called “intrepid.”) is A. RADCLYFFE DUGMORE,
and many people will prefer Mr. DUGMORE as a sportsman
to—well, to others whom it would be inopportune to men-
tion. His main object was not to kill, but to study; I hope

shoot a bad sitter
in order to save the
camera (not to men-
tion the photo-
grapher); but this
was done only in
self-defence—never
in anger because
the subject failed to
keep the expression.
Mr. DUGMORE's ac-
count of his adven-
tures is nearly as
to The End of the
Rainbow (CHAPMAN
AND HALL); and I
think that her book
would have gained
in attractiveness if
she had treated her
heroine a little more
mercifully. Lilith

I fancy The Cumner's Son (MILLS AND Boos) was among
other South Sea folk whose acquaintance Sir Gilbert PARKER
made when he lived and worked in Australia, not dreaming
of the House of Commons, much less of Westminster Abbey.
He is fortunate in having at an impressionable age found
his lines cast in pleasant places in the rich lands of Canada
and Australia. Continent and island share the advantage,
since one does not recall any writer who possesses in larger
degree the gift of being able to reproduce glowing scenery
by a few strokes of the pen. This quality is supple-
mented by a greater one, the power of creating and
describing human character. Sir GILBERT is indeed the
BRET HARTE of the South Seas, telling in a few pages
moving stories of the rough-and-ready folk who people
its islands. It is probable that these vivid sketches
were his earliest efforts in literature, were published in
Australian papers and magazines, and have now been
collected for the edification and pleasure of gentlemen
(and ladies) of England who live at home at ease. How-
ever that be, it is a charming volume, full of life and
light and colour.

sympathy. I can-
not, however, sympathise with Lilith when she returned
home and made what I must call matrimonial hay of her
kind, vulgar family. Her sisters' “young men”—a dissent-
ing minister and a shop-assistant (pomatumed)—worshipped
at her shrine, and it seemed strange that she did not guess
what they were doing. She lived in an orgie of unsatisfied
longings, and her flights in search of religion had such
peculiar results that Mrs. Somers was quite right to be
alarmed by them. The author has drawn a most difficult
character with considerable skill, but I can well understand
that the many “imperfections” of Lilith may be an offence
to those who prefer their heroines to be of the first water.
Anyhow, I never read a truer preface.

Mr. Anthony Faith will shortly
publish through the firm of

with similar effusions from another pen,
it is as well to state, that though a
strong family resemblance is noticeable,
the names of the characters and of the
country in which the scene is laid are

“At night, unless we resort to artificial illumination, all rooms are
dark . . .
As is well known by most people, the photographer's dark room is
not actually dark, but is illuminated by red light only. . The best way

MR. R., whose CIIARMING RESIDENCE ON THE PortsMoUTH Road was UTTERLY UNINHABITABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOTOR DUST, HAS
SUPPLEMENTARY CRITICISM.
A RECENT issue of The Pall Mall
Gazette initiates a new and fruitful
method of dramatic criticism. Under
the head of “Theatrical Notes" we read
the following:–
“The following extracts from the letter of a
very experienced and shrewd playgoer giving
his impressions of a visit to the Duke of York's
Theatre to see Justice will perhaps be of
interest : — .
“If, as I suppose, Galsworthy thinks weak
criminals should be treated as patients, I do
not agree with him, but it is a horribly difficult
question and I think he sets forth his case with
admirable moderation. Falder, alas! . . . .
could never have been any good. The play
left me with a feeling that an alteration in
prison discipline was most desirable. The trial
ºcene was finely managed. Eadie was very
fine, though I think there was too little
difference between the boy before and after
imprisonment. Boucicault, Hersee, and Bryant
I thought li elike. . . . . Cokeson appeared to
me a blot on the play. He was a weak imita-
tion of a character out of Dickens, and a
Dickens' character in twentieth century sur-
roundings must be a caricature. The part
was theatrical, and I thought Gwenn played it
very theatrically.'
In the same letter the writer gives his im-
pressions of The Tenth Man, concerning which
he is I think, in agreement with most critics
in declaring his George Winter the best thing
Mr. Bourcher has ever done. ‘He was the
man,’ he writes, ‘and his technique was a
delight.'”
We venture to afford some further
specimens of this vicarious criticism in
which the impressions of the anonymous
but inſluential outsider are quoted to
supplement or correct those of the
regular representative.
From “The Daily Telegraph.”
A famous athlete and ex-Varsity Blue
thus summarises his impressions of the
performance of Othello by the Sicilians.
The freshness and originality of his
point of view will better be understood
when it is explained that he had never
read or seen a representation of SHAK-
SPEARE's version:—
“What the show was about or what
the actors were driving at, of course I
hadn't the foggiest notion whatever. I
always thought Othello was an Italian,
but it seems that he was a black man
with a very bad temper and absolutely
no knowledge of the Queensberry rules.
He had a scrap with a Johnny called
Iago, a most decent quiet sort of chap,
and mauled him shockingly. And finally
he had a row with his wife, a quiet sort
of woman, strangled her, and then killed
himself. Personally I can't understand
why people want to see this sort of a
play. I only know that it took away
my appetite, and I couldn't eat a bit of
supper afterwards at the Savoy.”
From “The Times.”
We offer no excuse for laying before
our readers the subjoined vivid appre-
ciation of the latest Levity success from
the pen of a distinguished Greek Pro-
fessor: —
“What ARISTOTLE would have thought
of Our Miss Dibs is a rather difficult
question to answer. But if it be the
function of tragedy to purify the soul
of the spectator by pity and terror, so,
it may be urged, musical comedy ought
to elevate the intellect by refinement and
wit. And I am certain that HomeR
would have appreciated the all-pervasive
smile, the dvipiduov yaaoua, of Miss
Goethe Schiller in the name part. Com-
pared with the score of Elektra, it is
true that the instrumentation of Our
Miss Dibs betrays a certain tenuity of
texture. But the melodic charm of the
songs is undeniable, and when we come
to the lyrics—the joint work of Mr.
Harry Prance, Lionel Greenwood, Ha-
drian Boss, Peter Epstein, and Orlando
Meldon—it is not too much to say that
they equal, if they do not surpass, the
aloxpokoyia of ARISTOPHANES in his most
unbridled mood. All things considered,
then, this is a very rare and vital enter-
tainment, in which topical allusiveness,
temperamental vivacity, and a sumptuous
mise-en-scène combine to titillate the
auditor with superlative success.”
IFrom “The Nation.”
A distinguished member of the Cabi-
net has kindly furnished us with the
following interesting comments on Mr.
SHAw's Misalliance : —
“'The true significance of Mr. Shaw's
brilliant satire has so far been entirely
misapprehended. In the first place it
shows the danger of prolonged politieal
discussion without resort to a more
drastic application of the closure than
is at present possible. Secondly it is
an overwhelming condemnation of the
hereditary system as illustrated by a
neurotic youth and an anarchic girl.
Lastly it is a superb indication of the
sanity and wisdom of the Minority
Report of the Poor Law Commission and
foreshadows the speedy establishment of
a model city organised on the eugenic
system, and bearing the inspiring name
of Webbville.”
From “The Morning Post.”
The greatest living Imperialist—we
had almost said the greatest man since
NApoleoN–has generously placed at our
disposal these poignant observations on
Elektra :-
“No one who has witnessed this
magnificent work can have failed to
notice the extraordinary political parable
which underlies the contest between
Elektra and Clytemnestra. Elektra, sus-
tained throughout all the years of servi-
tude and misery by the thought of
retaliation, typifies the cause of Tariff
Reform, while Clytemnestra, plastered

PERILLA PROTESTs.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,-Under the leading
“Nature for Nature's Sake,” you printed
the other day a letter from Lucan,
evidently intended to convey the impres-
sion that he and a certain Peilla named
in it had carried the worship of animals
to a point when it became a nuisance.
Now, Mr. Punch, I am the Perilla con-
cerned, and I know I need only mention
that fact to sºcure from your well-known
gallantry the opportunity of putting
things in the right light.
So far from animals being any
nuisance here, we suffer from the want
We actually still cut our
tennis lawn with a horrid noisy mowing-
machine because of Lucan's refusal to
buy the dear little baby donkey with
which I fell in love in Connemara two
years ago, though it would have grazed
it beautifully, and could easily have
stood in the knife-house whilst we were
playing. Moreover, I have had to fill
our dovecote with the pigeons, which all
our neighbours say damage their
gardens so much, because Lucan would
not bring home the four young cor-
morants we found in their nest in Skye.
He didn't deny they would be perfectly
sweet in the garden if we re-built the
pigeon-loft and sank the sitz-bath in the
tulip bed, but he made excuses about the
difficulty of transportation—as if he
could possibly have forgotten the parra-
keets we brought right across Europe
from Vienna * much nicer little
darlings than those at the bird-fancier's
round the corner here), or the tarantula
we should certainly have got safely home
from South Africa if Lucan hadn't
suddenly refused in the Red Sea to keep
it any longer in the corner of his berth.
Of course I know he was feeling ill at
the time—I mean Lucan was, not the
tarantula; that must have been perfectly
right and healthy, poor little thing, for
it bit a sailor's bare foot only the next
morning, and the cruel wretch killed it.
Then there was the pelican we saw at Jam-
rach's, which was a perfect duck and would
have been really useful too, for the man
said he would only eat absolutely fresh
fish, so that if you offered him what the
fishmonger sent for your dinner, and he
ate it, you could be sure it wouldn't have
done you any harm. And there was the
baby alligator, the succetest little mite,
which I had on approval from Crosss
one day, until Lucan happened to come
home hot and dusty in the evening and
got into the big bath with him in the
dusk—but, as I said at the time, you
must put alligators in water, and where
else was there?
The fact is, most people get cross
with animals if they don't behave better
than Christians; like Aunt Caroline,
who annoyed the parrot every Sunday
for five years by wagging her horrid
false front just outside his cage, and
then altered her will because he took it
in at last.
I had heaps more to say when I sat
down, but Dicky is singing so glori-
ously I can't remember it; and if I don't
soon take Lucan's book of artificial flies
away from the puppy I'm afraid he'll
hook himself. I think if one keeps
animals at all one ought to look after
them, don't you?
Yours confidently,
PERILLA Loveitt.

With Stella cool and very smart
At double turns on rollers,
I fain would skate; she's won my heart;
I'm anxious to cajole hers.
But when the maid my signal sees
She “two-steps” by like winking;
I follow, though I'm not at ease.
When rinking, rinking, rinking.
My feet feel rather out of hand,
Half measures don't content them,
They leave me even when Istand
Nor can I circumvent them.
Their treachery results in spills;
My dear avoids me, shrinking,
She finds no fun in thuds and thrills
When rinking, rinking, rinking.
When other maids I would induce
To skate with me and chance it,
They spurn me with a cold excuse
As cutting as a lancet.
And so my secret hope grows weak,
As to the ground I'm sinking,
Of rousing Stella's jealous pique
When rinking, rinking, rinking.

REAL REFORM.
[This article was apparently intended for
Halsbury's Hebdomadal Review. Having mis-
laid that paper's address and not knowing
where the offices of Wemyss's Weekly are, we
print the article ourselves.]
The news that Lord RoSEBERy’s “re-
form resolutions” are purely academic,
and that in any case his indictment of
the hereditary principle didn't mean
what you thought it meant, has been
received in the country with feelings of
relief and thankfulness. Our reputa-
tion as a nation of sportsmen would be
gone for ever if once our faith in the
House of Lords as an impartial revising
bºdy were shattered. The urgent busi-
néss before us now is that reform of the
| House of Commons to which more than
one moble speaker in the Upper House
has called attention. Let us see what
Kean be done in this direction.
It is obvious in the first place that
º extreme difference of opinion be-
tween the two Houses must result, as
things go at present, in a deadlock,
which is bound to bring about a con-
siderable disturbance in the business of
*the country unless one or other side
gives way. For the House of Lords to
give way would be to render its labours
null and void, and it is doubtful if their
Lordships would consent to give their
-services to the country if these were to
be spurned at the first moment of crisis.
| For the House of Commons to give way
appears at first sight to be the natural
solution of the diſliculty, and it has
worked perfectly well for hundreds of
years; but we must move with the
times, and the times are ripe for a
change. What change, then, is possible?
Plainly it would be better to prevent
the deadlock than to set about curing
it when it had arisen. That is to say,
we must bring the two Houses more
into line with each other, so that differ-
ences of opinion may be made im-
possible. The Socialist (and Anarchist)
would do this by altering the compo-
sition of the House of Lords: that
House which saved the Empire only
a short time ago by postponing the con-
struction of tram lines along the Em-
bankment until the country was ripe for
the extraordinary innovation. He would
attack the hereditary principle, and by
so doing strike a blow at the Throne
itself. That is the Socialist remedy; but
the great heart of the country would not
tolerate it for a moment, particularly
when it sees before it another remedy,
delightful in its simplicity.
It is simply this: Alter the composition
of the House of Commons, so as to bring
it into line with the House of Lords.
How shall this reformed and impartial
House of Commons be constituted 2
That, of course, will have to be a matter
for careful thought by a Select Com-
mittee of the House of Lords; but we
may venture to draw up a rough plan.
The House of Commons should con-
sist of 555 members; 250 to be nomi-
nated and 300 to be elected, together
with 5 life members.
The nominated members should be
chosen as follows:—
Selected by the House of Lords 100
Specially nominated by Lord
HALSBURY (counting four each
on a division) --- ... 50
Nominated by Lord Rothschild. 30
Nominated by Lord BURTON ... 30
Nominated by the Archbishop of
CANTERBURY ... - - - ... 20
Nominated by Lords CURZON,
MILNER, and CROMER (six each) 18
Nominated by Lord RoseBERY... l
Nominated by Lord CREWE ... 1
250
These 250 impartial members should
sit in the House of Commons for a
period of twenty years; that is to say,
for two Parliaments. Every ten years
300 members will be elected as follows:
One hundred special qualified mem-
bers, commanding the confidence of the
country, will be elected by the House of
Commons. These will be chosen from
(a) Municipal Reform Aldermen.
% Defeated Unionist Candidates.
c) The Stock Exchange.
(d) The Trade.
(e) Brighton.
Two hundred will be elected by the
constituencies in the ordinary way; a
Redistribution Bill having first been
passed by the House of Lords, by which
England will be divided into 197 con-
stituencies—Scotland, Ireland and Wales
returning one member apiece.
Five Life Members will be chosen by
some high and impartial authority (e.g.,
the Duke of Norfolk). These would
be moderate and independent men, be-
longing to no party. The first five
might be: -
The Editor of The Times.
The Secretary of the Navy League.
The Secretary of the National Service
League.
The Secretary of the Property Defence
League.
Lord TorphichEN (if he'll be good).
We venture to say that a House of Com-
mons constituted on these lines would
receive the approbation of all right-
thinking men in the country. It would
also act in harmony with the House of
Lords—that House which for its im-
partiality is the pride of every true
sportsman in Britain and the admiration
of the whole world. Were the House
constituted thus, there would be no
putting of party before country, indeed
no considerations of party at all.
Can it be doubted that such a state of ||
things would commend itself to the
nation at large? Can it be doubted
that such a state of things will only
be decently brought about by a true
and patriotic reform of the House of
Commons ? A. A. M.

Ah, that result were fine, if it were real;

THE PEN ( ; UIN THAT FELI, ON ITS MARCH !
(A tragic picture suggested by the simile of Mr. Lloyd George )
House of Commons, Monday, March 21.
-In Lords to-night discussing Rose-
BERY's Resolution for reform of House,
RiDLEY in fine sentence declared, “It is
necessary that we should march with
the times and have a fresh current of
air.’
In the Commons this hygienic desire
was lavishly realised. Current of air,
in fact, amounted to brisk breeze. Began
to blow on motion for second reading of
Consolidated Fund Bill. SIEEL-MAIT-
LAND began it with indictment of Govern-
ment for financial chaos following on
rejection of Budget by Lords.
Special feature of lively debate was
its wealth of literary allusion. STEEL-
MAITLAND likened action of Government
in matter of additional spirit duty to
the incident of JACJB wrestling with the
Angel. Lloyd GEORGE, he said, had
wrestled with the distillers, refusing to
let their spirit go until they had stumpel
up the added three-and-nine.
FLUELLEN LLOYD GEORGE went to
SHACKLETON's book for his parallel. The
almost-discoverer of South Pole tells
how, when penguins carry their young,
if one falls on the march, all the rest
tumble over it, and in their anxiety to
set it on its legs, tear the little one to
pieces.
“That is what is happening now,”
said FLUELLEN, ever apt at parallels (you
remember Macedon and Monmouth).
“The poor old Budget has fallen in its
march, thrown down by a cruel House of
Lords, and all the penguins are pecking
at it. There is one,” he cried, pointing
at SoN AUSTEN seated on t'other side of
Table. “And I can see another lying in
wait,” he continued, indicating blame-
less Cousin HUGH below the Gangway
wringing his hands in ill-subdued in-
dignation.
When Cousin HUGh's turn came he
found his illustration in “Jackanapes,”
which tells how a perverse little boy sat
in a puddle with deliberate design to
soil his trousers.
“It is the same with the Govern-
ment,” said Cousin HUGH, performing his
favourite trick, at which Labour Members
never cease to wonder, of seizing his
left wrist with right hand and turning
it completely round. “They are anxious
to sit in puddles and make as much dirt
as possible, so that they may charge the
|House of Lords with having spoiled their
fine clothes.”

Next to this profusion of literary lore

FLUELLEN retorted that 130NAR LAW was

calculated to unnerve the most reck-

STORIES OF GREAT CRIMES.
I.-HUGH Worxot's GUILT.
CHAPTER I.-I Introduce Myself.
READER dear, I will lay before you my
soul in all its naked candour. You
shall know all my innermost feelings,
all my self-doubtings, my self-suspicions,
my self-loathings, as upon a day in
November last I went into the Bank to
cash a cheque.
I am a tall man with light wavy hair.
My nose is aquiline (whatever that may
be), and my mouth is just about per-
fess the truth, I had no very great
belief in it. Do you ever believe that
you are entirely innocent of everything
when you go into the bank to cash a
cheque?
I came to the conclusion, after some
thought, that I must be guilty of
frudulently, maliciously and goodness-
knows-what-else-ly impersonating Hugh
Wotnot. The defence that, “Dash it
all, I am Hugh Wotnot,” did not, it
seemed to me, deserve consideration.
No wonder all the nice rich men on the
other side of the railings looked at me
askance!
He intended to compare the signatures'
I took up the pen, and, when he was not
looking, I deliberately copied my signa-
ture from the other side. Oh, yes, I
am a criminal all right now. I have
forged my own signature, and forged
it very badly, too.
CHAPTER VII.-The Escape.
This is how I escaped. After examin-
ing the signature for, I should say, two
hours and forty-five minutes, he thrust
five golden sovereigns at me. I could
have told from the way he did so, if
I had not already known, that I had
fect, fitted with a supply of teeth -
and every modern improvement. On
second thoughts, I don't think that
I will be a tall man with light wavy
hair. I will be a short man, with
black straight hair and not too much
of that, and a figure inclining to
stoutness. I will stick to the original
nose and mouth. On third thoughts
I will be a plain, ordinary English-
man, just the sort of man who would
be going into a bank to cash a
cheque. -
CHAPTER II.-The Dedication.
This sad story is dedicated to all
who have suffered as I have in the
matter of cashing innocent cheques
in a suspicious manner. The dedi-
cation should have come earlier, but
the drayman who brought the 1,897
miles of paper on which this periodi-
cal is printed got the rolls out of
order. The 1,895th mile got in before
the 1,894th ; hence the confusion.
CHAPTER III.—Finance.

vant, the breadman, the cigarette-man
and the man at the desk to whom I
confide daily and with shame what I
have eaten for lunch, and who then

but-I-shall-be-coming-back-in-a-

II.--THE CRIME of LADY LINNET.
The question was, whom had Lady,
Linnet murdered 2 It could not have
been Hugh Wotnot, because he was
the hero of our last story and this
is the beginning of our new one.
Lord Linnet was suspected, but not
the keenest cross-examination could
shake him in his sworn statement
that he had not been murdered. Who
then was it? That is a question
which must ever remain unanswered.
Frankly, we do not know.

bread, cigarettes and hush for a day.”
How right they were ! It was the work
of the moment to sit down and write a
cheque. -
CHAPTER IV.-Black Suspicion.
The position was this:—I was Hugh
Wotnot, and the Bank had £75 of my
money. I wanted five pounds of it back,
so I had written on a suitably-coloured h
piece of paper, “Pay Self, if you please,
five pounds. (Signed) H. WotNot.” Im-
mediately upon entering the Bank I was
a suspected person. Moreover, I was
only too glad that they did not call
upon me to defend myself then and
there, for I could not have asserted my
innocence with any emphasis. To con-
I selected the man with the least
railing and askancity about him. To
him I addressed my plea. “I want to
cash this cheque, please. I swear to
you that I am not naughtily impersonat-
ing Hugh Wotnot. I beg you to believe
that I am Hugh Wotnot. I am trying
hard to believe so myself. . . . If you
are going to make a fuss, please, please
ave me arrested as quietly as you
possibly can.”
I may add that I said all that with
my eyes. My tongue was too parched
to be of any real use.

observation or experience of ordinary
stay-at-home people, not lion hunters or
polar explorers or special correspon-
dents. * . . . . . ."
“Well,” said I, “one of the most
surprising things I ever saw I saw last
evening. It was in a third-class carriage,
into which came a soldier. He was a
tall handsome fellow, with some stripes,
and from his conversation with another
soldier at the door, until the train started,
I gathered that he was a bit of a dog
among the ladies too. Well, no sooner had
the train started than he produced from
somewhere or other about his person
a spectacle case, took out a pair of
spectacles, rubbed them with his hand-
kerchief, put them on, and began to
read the evening paper.

working man with a single eye-glass
would be one of the most extraordinary
possible sights that could be imagined;
but an English soldier in spectacles
runs that very close.”
“My surprise,” said Eastlake, “was
like this. It was all the more surprising
because I was surprised by myself. I
must tell you that I have an unfortunate
habit—I try to fight against it—of ap-
pearing to be more interested in a sub-
ject about which someone is talking to
me than perhaps I really am. I did not
know this formerly. I know it now.
If, for instance, I met the Dean of
Arches at a dinner-party he would pro-
bably—if I did not take due precautions
—go away under the impression that
my hobby, apart from my profession,
was ecclesiastical law. Similarly an
owner of racehorses would suppose that
in my spare moments my thoughts ran
entirely on the Turf. This weakness is
strongly emphasised, I'm afraid, by the
fact that, being a journalist, I have been
trained to make the best strategic use of
my information.
“Well, when I was staying once in
Wiltshire I had a most agreeable con-
versation about birds in a house where
I had been invited to luncheon. My
host was full of information, and I
threw such light as I could on the sub-
ject by telling him about birds I had
noticed in my own county of Cheshire.
. You understand that I know very little
about birds, except that robins are pug-
nacious and kill one another, and that
cuckoos generally prefer hedge-sparrows'
nests, and such commonplaces as that.
A day or two later, this host I am telling
you about asked me to luncheon again
—quite a pressing invitation. When I
arrived, he said, ‘I am delighted that
you could come. This is Mr. —— [in-
troducing me to a well-known orni-
thologist], who particularly wished to
meet you. I told him about our con-
versation the other day. He is most
anxious to compare his notes with yours
on certain points of detail. In fact he
has long been trying to meet with an
observer of the Cheshire birds—” It
was terrible. I can see now the pene-
trating, ornithological glances of that
man through his spectacles. And he
had come half across the county to meet
me.”
“But, my dear Eastlake,” I said sym-
pathetically, “this might happen to you
again any day.”
“Too true!” he said. “But, as I have
told you, I take precautions. It has
almost become a habit with me to say
‘I am intensely interested in this subject,
but I really know nothing about it.’”
“My pet surprise,” said Latimer, “oc-
curred about two years ago, and nothing
has happened since to beat it. We had
been asked to dinner at a neighbouring

country house occupied by very swagger
people. We got a lift there in a friend's
motor, but arranged to be fetched at
half-past ten in the village fly—one of
the finest extant specimens of a vehicle
which will soon be in existence only in
museums. Everybody for miles around
knew it and its octogenarian horse; but
there was nothing else available.
“Very well: the dinner passed off
as such things do: I was between a
Countess and a Lady : my wife was
hedged about by peers. Then came an
hour or more of hard talk in the drawing-
room, all very strange to me. And then,
to my profound relief, I heard the sound
of wheels as the venerable fly arrived,
and a footman with powdered hair flung
open the door and announced, ‘Mr.
Latimer's car !' Car ! The unexpected-
ness — the grotesque unsuitability — of
that word—its impact on my brain—has
still to be beaten.”

To err in the direction of reprinting in book form miscel-

topics, a member of the Imperial Defence Committee, over
which the PREMIER presides, his dicta on military concerns
will receive respectful consideration in the quarters most

Mr. C. E. MoxTAGUE, having his laugh at journalism in
general, chips the race of reviewers upon their accustomed
use of “the good, round, eulogistic sentence, readily detach-
able for each book's publisher to quote in his advertise-
ments.” Merely personal reasons, therefore, prevent me
from calling A II ind Let Loose a brilliant novel, a most read-
able book, one of the destined successes of this publishing
season. Without prejudice, I may say that it concerns itself
with the newspaper enterprise of a big provincial town, and
introduces Mr. Pinn, of The Stalwart (Liberal), and Mr.
Brumby, of The Warder (Tory), the one priggish, the other
pompous, both revelling in a vicarious reputation for literary
ability. The shocking truth is that the stirring leaders of
both are written by deputy: the humour of it, that their
deputy is the same wild Irishman. Of the discovery of this
fact, the righteously indignant dismissal of the double
deputy, the shamefaced but inevitable re-instalment of him
in both editorial sancta, it is less to ke said that they are
well told than that they happen in the most natural and
laughable way in the world. True, there is little love
interest, but that only shows that one can be merry and
bright and even interesting without being in love. In other
circumstances I would have said with all solemnity that the
reader would not put the book down until he had finished
the last page. Instead, I point with meticulous care to a
fault of affectation on page 154, but add that this one fault
is too trivial to be worth the finding. I hope Messrs.
METHUEN will find that last sentence detachable and eulogistic
enough to quote, if a book of such merit stands at all in
need of advertisement.
Unreserved praise could be given to Quaker Robins
(STANLEY PAUL) if Mr. Wilfrid RANDELi, had laid less stress
upon the love-story, and had allowed Ethelberta (the cat) and
Quintus Horatius Flaccus (the dog) to remain dumb. One
feels that the book has been puffed out with some unnecessary
and inferior padding ; for Mr. RANDELL's real business is with

I hope that Mr. T. A. Cook will pardon me for saying that
his book, International Sport (CoNSTABLE), is a hotch-potch,
when I add that I ſound it a delightful one. Mr. Cook dis-
arms me when he says in a preface, “This modest volume
has no pretensions to be a very serious contribution to the
history of sport or travel; ” but as regards sport, at any
rate, I venture to say that he has no cause to be so
apologetic. I'or its variety of information—given in a
manner far from pedantic—International Sport is both
useful to read and valuable as a book of reference. Not only
do we get the history of the Olympic Games and the names
of those who won wreaths of olive in 1906, but also we
are given a list of “all the winners” in the Games of 1908.
In these days, when one hears so much groaning over our
athletic decadence, it is a pleasure to meet an author who
has a whole-hearted enthusiasm for amateur sport, and some
very pertinent remarks to make about it.

[APRIL 6, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A QUIET HOUR.
“HUNDRED up?” suggested Frank,
linking his arm in mine.
“No, thanks, old chap,” I said. “I’m
going to have an hour's quiet reading.”
Frank disengaged himself, gazed at
me sadly, and went his way.
There are authors who resemble
certain winding roads or dangerous
hills—if you try them at too great a
speed you come a cropper. For the
safe negotiation of their works I am in
the habit of retiring to my hermitage.
It is a delusion in the household that
nobody dares interrupt me there. In
an easy-chair I settled myself comfort-
ably and read for five splendid minutes;
then it occurred to me that a cigar
would be particularly pleasant. My
case was in the pocket of an overcoat
downstairs. 1 fetched it and resettled.
“George, dear,” enquired a clear voice
(ſhe cigar had a half-inch of beautiful
white ash), “have you seen Dorothy's
doll's deck-chair 7” I turned to con-
front the usually delightful person who
peered at me from the half-opened door.
“I have not seen Dorothy's dol's
deck-chair,” I replied formidably. “Nor
have I perceived the pen-wiper of the
lamp-lighter's nephew. Really.”
“But you mended it only this
morning.” -
“I never touched his pen-wiper in all
my life.”
“Gh. . . . Are you reading 2"
“No ; I am papering the room,
darling. The room needs papering.
Do you like the paper? The husband
of the gardener's wife has not any paper
in his room, poor chap—not even The
Daily xx -
“The curate's just called. Shall I
send him up 2"
“Leave me!” I exclaimed—but the
door had already closed.
Particularly fine was the ensuing
paragraph of the volume, and greatly
proud was I, as I sank into the deep
cushions, of having grasped its main
idea. A serene glow of satisfaction took
possession of me. What grand fellows
these old philosophers were ! What
anchor-chains of thought they forged
from their white-hot conceptions! Listen
to this: —
“Got a stamp, old boy 2”
It was the lady who is popularly
known as Auntie Nell. Marking my
place, I set the book aside.
“Helen, ' I said, “I will not deny it;
I have a stamp. Do you want one º'
“No. I came in for the fern-pot.”
We regarded each other steadily.
“Small I lick it?” I enquired meekly.
“And affix it for you?”
“Yes, pease.”
“Would you like me to run to the
post, Helen?”
“No thanks. Pay you to-morrow.”
“Numerous considerations,” observed
my author, when I had regained the
sense of the argument and become calm,
“ pointing towards deep, unfathomable
regions, present themselves here.” The
consideration which presented itself to
me, after a few minutes had passed, was
that one of my fingers was sticky. You
can't read decently with sticky fing, rs.
I rose, sought the bath-room, and washed
my hands. Returning, I made to re-
plenish the fire, and discovered that
there was no coal. Ringing the bell, I
waited until fuel had been fetched.
“Nature does not make all great
men,” pursued the luminous unturned
page, “in the selfsame mould. ADDISON
Says * >
“Daddy!” (This must have been
ADDISON's earlier manner.) “Daddy!
You don’t know what I’ve got.”
Dolothy climbed on my knees and sat
on the book.
“Go away,” I said austerely.
“Open your mouf and shut your
eyes,” commanded Dorothy. . . . It
was a sugar-almond, and I nearly swal-
lowed the thing.
“Let me look at it.”
(I opened my
mouth.) “O-oll ! The pink's almost
gone. Now suck hard and you come to
the nut. Is it nice? Put your cigar
away, or you can't suck proper.”
“Dorothy,” I said, “I want to read.”
“Why?"
“Because—h'm—because it improves
my mind.”
“Don’t you ever want to play wiv
me?”
“I played with you this morning.”
“But that was hours and hours ago.
Can you feel the nut yet?”
“No. Call Mummy. Where's Miss
Smith ? She ought to put you to bed.”
“She’s teaching Unky Frank to pay
brilliards.” (Ah, Frank!) “Just one
game.” I smiled, sighed, succumbed.
“What shall it be?”
“Bl'man's-buff. You be bli’man
first.”
“In all times and places,” my author
murmured between the shut pages, “the
Hero has been worshipped.” Am I not
a Hero? Dorothy worships me; and
Dorothy's mamma once said ––
“George, have you seen Dor— Oh,
you darlings ' ' Being bli’man, I
couldn't dodge the kiss.
“Good night, daddy, fankyou. Is the
nut froo?” And, as the nut w is through,
and I seemed by now to have mislaid
the thread of my author's argument, I
went off to relieve Miss Smith.
“The Recorder ultimately adjourned the
case to enable the Crown to have he law in-
volved by senior counsel.” – Dub in Evening
II erald.
How often this happens.
TOO MANY DAYS AGO.
(With apologies to the auth r of “A Few Days
Ago" in “The S, here.”)
If any of my readers—if I have readers
—should feel surprise at the remark-
able antiquity of some of the paragraphs
in this column I hasten to assure him
that it is no fault of mine. I hold myself
guiltless of a system which makes it
necessary for a writer to pen on the 16th,
say, of the month, the article which his
readers will not see until the 25th.
That is one of the penalties of demand-
ing pictures along with text.
One of the most interesting episodes
in connection with Queen ANNE's funeral,
which I could not he p witnessing, as
my taxi was held up for an hour by the
procession (at great expense to me), was
the unhorsing of one of the officers.
Why it should be so humiliting to be
thrown from the saddle I leave to
psychologists to decide. Enough for me
that I felt, and knew that every one
else was feeling, a mortification and
grief equal to the rider's own : surely a
remarkable example of sympathy.
To return to the question of taxis,
surely some day a taxi-cab builder will
arise with enough brains to devise some
system of com uunication with the driver
less clumsy than opening the door and
less awkward than speaking, like Pyra-
mus and Thisbe through a hole in the .
wall. My own liabit—and, as my readers ||
know, I now live entirely in these vehicles
—is to arrange with the driver (before I |
get in) a cºde of taps on the glass; and
then all is well. One tap = turn to the
right; two taps == turn to the leſt;
three taps = stop ; and so on.
When are we to be provided with a
lift at the National Gallery 2 It is a
scandal that in this treasure-house of art
the visitor should be expected to put
one foot before the other to climb the
steps. Art that is worth seeing is worth
seeing in comfort.
The cricket season is, thank heaven!
upon us again, and the boring pursuit
of the football will cease for a while.
None too soon. But how pleasant it
would be if someone in authority could
assure us that at Lord's it would be
possible to get something to eat at lunch-
time on the big match days, and that
the tea interval was to be abolished for
ever. Has Mr. FRY chosen his new
county yet, I wonder? W. W. W.
“MATRIMONY. A young gentleman wishes to
meet a young lady.”—Scºtsman.
Yes, that's how it begins.

“THE GRIP.”
CoNCElving that the wit and wisdom
of Messrs. GRANville BARKER and BER-
NARI, Shaw are as undeniable as their
inability or reluctance to introduce move-
ment into their dramas is regrettable,
Mr. ARTHUR Collins has, we are de-
lighted to learn, arranged with these
authors to collaborate with Messrs.
RALEIGH and HAMILTON in the next great
Drury Lane production. Of the won-
derful quadruple masterpiece that will
result, and is now in process of con-
struction, we are privileged in being
able to give the following advance
synopsis. The play will be entitled The
Grip, in four Acts.
Act I.-A desolate strip of the L. and
N. W. Railway line between Berkham-
sted and Tring. There are four sets of
metal tracks, and between each pair of
rails is an armchair, on which are
seated Lieut.-Col. Robinson (an ex-officer
now in the hardware business), Mrs.
Brown (his housekeeper), Miss Brown
(her daughter), and Mr. Thomas Jones
(her fiancé).
discuss
Socialism,
The Canals in Mars,
Plural Voting,
Confucianism,
Bedspreads.
In the middle of Bedspreads the Car-
lisle express (real) arrives suddenly and
carries off Mrs. Brown. (Curtain.)
Act II.-A peak in the Alps. The
survivors of Act I., accoutred with axes,
alpenstocks, ropes and spectacles, are
scaling a difficult pitch, and continuing
the adjourned discussion on Bedspreads.
From this they drift naturally into
Anti-vivisection,
Vegetarianism,
Christian Science,
Bimetallism,
Japanese Art.
During the last topic the Lieut.-Colonel
is seized with vertigo, and plunges into
a bottomless abyss (real). (Curtain.)
Act III. — A tight-rope over the
Niagara Falls (real water). On this the
two protagonists are balancing. After
The quartette proceeds to
some brisk repartee on Tariff Reform
and the Sex question, during which the
fire-proof curtain is twice lowered and
raised rapidly, Miss Brown invites Mr.
Jones to chase her. This he proceeds
to do, but misses his footing and falls.
In an agony of remorse she plunges
after him. (Curtain.)
Act IV.-The interior (profusely de-
corated) of St. Paul's Church, Knights-
bridge. The two lovers, both with bad
colds after their recent wetting, and
in convict's dress (they have been im-
prisoned, as it transpires, for giving an
unlicensed acrobatic entertainment with-
in the boundaries of the British Empire),
are about to be married. They wrangle
for some twenty minutes on Eugenics
and the Divorce Law, and the ceremony
proceeds. Just as it is over and they
are on the point of being conducted to
separate solitary confinement by the
prison warders, a King's messenger
arrives up the aisle in a motor-car with
a free pardon from His Majesty. Re-
joicing and National Anthem. (Final
Curtain.)

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[APRIL 6, 1910.
MR. ROOSEVELT IN ENGLAND.
(Extracted from the “Ilebdomadary Journal of the Roºsevelt
Round-Trip.")
I.
To-DAY (Monday) Mr. RooseveLT, having arrived at Charing
Cross on the previous night, addressed the members of the
London County Council at the County Hall in Spring
Gardens. Mr. RooseVELT was received in state by the Chair-
man and the Aldermen, and was conducted to his place by
Mr. HAYES FishFR and Sir John BENN. In an impassioned
speech, which occupied two hours in delivery, he adjured the
Council to neglect party, not to bother about the rates, and
to sound the death-knell of municipal trading of all kinds.
What, he asked, did a tram-line more or less matter, and
why should nºt all needy parents of at least twelve children
be fed and clothed at the expense of the rat payers? At
this stage Mr. HAYES Fisheſ and Sir John BENN left the Hall;
but Mr. RooseVELT, nothing daunted, continued his address.
Eventually the meeting adjourned in confusion after an
enthusiastic vote of thanks to the distinguished visitor had
been passed by a majority of one on a total vote of three.
- II.
To-day (Tuesday) Mr. RooseVELT paid his long-promised
visit to the Houses of Parliament. Members of both Houses
had assembled in Westminster Hall to do him honour, a
mixed guard of honour being furnished by the 1st Regiment
of Life Guards and the Middlesex Yeomanry. The SPEAKER
of the House of Commons and the LORD CHANCELLOR led Mr.
Roosevelt to the brass plate commemorating the position of
STRAFFORD during his trial; and Mr. Roosevelt then began
his harangue by dwelling in scathing terms on the contrast
between the material splendour of an Archbishop and the
needy wretchedness of a labourer out of employment. No
Archbishop, he thought, should receive a stipend of more
than £100 a year paid quarterly in advance, and both of
them ought to be compelled by law to pass at least eleven
months of every year in a slum dwelling. At this point the
Archbishop of CANTERBURY was unfortunately called away by
a long-standing previous engagement. Mr. RooseVELT, con-
tinuing, poured scorn on such efforts as might from time to
time be made by the Bench of Bishops to preach and enforce
the superannuated doctrines of peace amongst mankind.
Having thus cleared the Hall of all the Bishops, Mr.
Roosevelt went on to deliver a glowing panegyric on War as
the reinvigorator of nations. He was himself, he said, no
supporter of the obsolete privileges possessed and exercised
by the House of Lords, but at the same time he felt Dound
to commend that House for throwing down the gauntlet
to an upstart and ignorant assembly like the House of
Commons, who, for their part, deserved nothing but praise
for the way in which they had determined to assert their
privileges against a most unwarrantable encroachment.
Both these Houses ought, he thought, to wield a perpetual
Veto against one another. They might then combine to
build ten Dreadnoughts a week and to make every man,
woman and child a solier—a course which he himself had
determined to pursue when, if ever, he returned to the
United States. Let them use the big stick on one another
and on foreign nations and all might yet be well. Finally
Mr. RooseVELT shook the hand of his remining audience (a
deaf peer whose name did not transpire), and left West-
minster in a taxi-cab.
- III.
Unfortunately, Mr. ROOSEVELT's promised lecture at
Windsor. Castle on “The Duties and Rights of Royalty”
h s had to be postponed, Mr. RooseVELT having been sum-
moned to Berlin by the KAISER and the In perill Chancellor
to settle the vexed question of the Prussian Iranchise.

[One result of the rubber boom has been to raise the price of the

BANG in the blessed spinney there he goes!
(Was ever round so rottenly begun ?)
The last survivor of my “silver crows,”
He shall not leap into the morning sum,
He shall not through the bristling bunkers roam,
Nor gambol in the furzes any more;
Now he has journeyed to his long, long home, |
Peace to his hand-made core. º
We shall not look upon his like again,
That pallid face with cicatrices marred,
That sometimes in the reedy swamp has lain,
And sometimes in the meadow primrose starred
All but an inch or so has tucked away,
And answered nothing to the niblick's call-
What? Did you speak, my caddie? Yes, you may
Put down another ball.
But not his equal, Edward, not his mate;
In former days I might have dared indeed,
Cheered by the rosy chance of hitting straight,
To sacrifice a second of his breed.
Silvanus only knows what flowery nooks
Have stifled, ere to-day, the dying throb
Of countless unremembered “daws” and “rooks”
Costing the bard two bob.
But now the skyey brutes have grown more dear
And vendors hope to rush me half-a-crown,
I draw the line; there is no patent sphere,
No airy creature of approved renown
For whom I mean to pay that famine price.
The good old tax I'll bear, but naught above,
Not for a glittering bird of Paradise,
Not for a Paphian dove.
l’ile me the mound again; and let us place
A feebler victim on the altar-top,
Some poor concoction of a hybrid race,
How slow to move, how resolute to stop !
See where the wretched thing has gone and rolled !
You say the party next behind us swears:
Ah well, it may be just : perhaps they hold
A heap of rubber shares.
Apropos of the newly revived “Parade of the Black
Knight,” at Ashton-under-Lyne, The Daily Mail says: —
“The Black Knight was a tyrant in the fifteenth century who lived at
the Old Hall, Ashton, now demolished. He w is notorious for the large
number of wives he had, and his summary method of disposing of them
by rolling them down a hill in a spiked barrel. Left to individual
enterprise, the custon had of late years fallen into decay.”
Perhaps it was as well. In the hands of a really enterprising
individual it must have been a very unpleasant custom for
the wife.

THE DEPARTMENTAL SYSTEM.
(By the Solicitor's Clerk.)
I sit in a vast marble hall, filled with
electric light, heated to a nicety by the
most expensive heating apparatus, sup-
plied with liſts and every modern con-
venience. I am in the Land Registry
Office, and asking myself, “Where does
the money come from ?” I am also
wondering whether the Client, who is
by a gracious legislature compelled to
patronise this institution every time he
wan's to transfer his London property,
is a wealthy man. I hope he is, because
he has to pay for the conveyance of his
land by the good old system which
works well, and the nice new system
which does not. This imports variation
into life; it is an e'fective bar to mono-
tony; but it is costly. Yet he must be
wealthy, or how could he be a client?
I am ushered into the Official s room.
There is a nice fire in the grate, and the
Official is just about to read his morning
paper. I have cºme to see him over a
matter of a 7s.6d. stamp. We converse
about stamps generally, this Official
and I. By a natural and easy process
we get from the abstract to the concrete,
and I am informed bit by bit that there
is something about my stamp that only
Somerset House can properly appreciate.
* * - º º
Somerset House and I are old friends.
We understand each other. “I have no
difficulty in gathering, during the course
of conversation, that the Land Registry,
modest creature, is reilly the connoisseur
of this particular stamp. Let the Land
Registry only condescend to initial the
stamp, and Somerset House will then do
the dirty work.
The walk between the two places is
pleasant and beas repetition.
+ * + *
The Official is stoking his fire when
I enter. I explain what Somerset House
want, and explain it again. The Official
summons another Official. We are in-
troduced, we pull our chairs up to the
fire, and for the third time I explain.
They at once grasp the outline of the
idea, and pencils are produced. The
second Official returns to his nest, the
first to his paper, and I to Somerset
House.
+ + + +
There is another man at Somerset
House. He is proud, and cannot con-
ceive what his colleague was up to. He
'feels that Somerset House ought to
have done the initialling and the Land
Registry the dirty work. But, as I
have said, the House and I are old
#friends, and I know how to take a joke.
+ º - * +
The fire in the Official's room is
getting, perhaps, a little too hot. How-
ever, “How are you getting on with
Mother (visiting son at preparatory school). “WELL, MY DARLING!"
Son. “I say, Mother, Don't Look so Ghastly pleased BEFore ALL TIESE FELLows.”
that stamp of yours?” says the Official.
I explain that, having made a little
investigation of my own, I have dis-
covered a special Stamp Department in
this very building. I have left it there
for a week, so that they may see if they
can think out something for me. “Do
you know,” says the Official, “I am
becoming quite interested in that stamp
of yours. What exactly is the matter
with it? I am afraid I did not listen
very carefully when you first told me
about it.” I explain that I want it
cancelled and the 7 s. 6d. back. Why
do I want it cancelled ” Because it
ought never to have been put on. Then
why, if he may ask without seeming
rude, was it put on ? Because he, the
Official, told me to. “Did I really
now 2 " he says. “How very inter-
esting ! But tell me, how did you ever
come to find out that it ought never to
have been put on ?” “They told me so
at Somerset House.” “Ah,” he said.
“Well, they probably know.”
+
+ + +
The week has elapsed. The Stamp
Department have thought the matter
over. The Land Registry has exchanged
messages with Somerset House. (I have
been the messenger.) There has been
no hurry, no hustle, no bickering, no ill-
feeling. Once only the Official inter-
vened, courteous and quiet as ever.
Consideration has shown him that
Somerset House was quite right. The
stamp ought never to have been put on
the registration. How he knows this is
because the registration on which the
stamp was put ought never to have
been made. Finally I sign several
documents and get the seven and six-
pence back in penny stamps.
I say good-bye to the Official, won-
dering whether the Client is possibly
rich enough to stand it. The Official says
good-bye to me, wondering whether to
put another lump of coal on or not.

often proved fatal, but it must be borne in
mind that consumption might have killed them

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NAPOLEON AT WORK.
WHEN I am in any doubt or difficulty
I say to myself, “What would NAPOLEON
have done?” The answer generally
comes at once : “He would have bor-
rowed from Henry,” or “He would have
said his aunt was ill”—the one ob-
viously right and proper thing. Then
I weigh in and do it. -
“What station's this?” said Beatrice,
as the train began to slow up. “Baby
and I want to get home.”
“Whitecroft, I expect,” said John,
who was reading the paper. “Only
four more.” "
“It's grown since we were here last,” |
H observed. “Getting quite a big
place.” º
* “Good; then we're at Hillstead.
i Only three more stations. Hooray!”
I looked out of the window, and had
• a sudden suspicion. -
“Where have I heard the name
Byres before?” I murmured thought-
fully.
“You haven't,” said John. “Nobody
has.”
“Say “Byres, baby,” urged Beatrice
happily.
“You’re quite sure that there isn't
anything advertised called ‘Byres'?
You're sure you can't drink Byres or
rub yourself down with Byres?”
44 Quite.”
“Well, then, we must be at Byres.”.
There was a shriek from Beatrice, as
she rushed to the window.
“We're in the wrong train— Quick |
Get the bags!—Have you got the rug?—
Where s the umbrella?—Open the win-
dow, stupid!”
I got up and moved her from the door.
“Leave this to me,” I said calmly.
“Porter –porter!!—PORTER 11–Oh,
guard, what station's this?”
“Byres, Sir.”
“Byres 2"
“Yes, Sir.” He blew his whistle and
the train went on again.
“At any rate we know now that it was
Byres,” I remarked, when the silence
| began to get oppressive.
“It's all very well for you,” Beatrice
burst out indignantly, “but you don't
think about Baby. We don't know a
bit where we are—”
“That's the one thing we do know,”
I said. “We’re at this little Byres
place.”
“It was the porter's fault at Liverpool
Street,” said John consolingly. “He
told us it was a through carriage.”
“I don teare whose fault it was; I'm
only thinking of Baby.”
“What time do babies go to bed as a
rule 2"
“This one goes at six.”
“Well, then, she's got another hour.
Now, what would NAPO, EoN have done?”
“NAPOLEON,” said John, aſter careful
thought, “would have turned all your
clothes out of your bag, would have put
the baby. in it diagonally, and have
bored holes in the top for ventilation.
That's as good as going to bed—you
avoid the worst of the evening mists.
And people would only think you kept
caterpillars.”
Beatrice looked at him coldly.
“That’s a way to talk of your
daughter,” she said in scorn.
“Don’t kill him,” I begged. “We
may want him. Now I've got another
idea. If you look out of the window you
observe that we are on a single line.”
“Well, I envy it. And, however
single it is, we're going away from
home in it.” -
“True. But the point is that no
train can come back on it until we’ve
stopped going forward. So, you see,
there's no object in getting out of this
train until it has finished for the day,
as it were. Probably it will go back
itself before long, out of sheer boredom.
And it's much better waiting here than
on a draughty Byres platform.”
Beatrice, quite seeing the point,
changed the subject.
“There's my trunk will go on to
Brookfield, and the wagonette will meet
the train, and as we aren't there it will
go away without the trunk, and all baby's
things are in it.”
“She's not complaining,” I said.
“She’s just mentioning it.”
“Look here,” said John reproachfully,
“we’re doing all we can. We’re both
thinking like anything.” He picked up
his paper again.
I was beginning to get annoyed. It
was, of course, no good to get as anxious
and excited as Beatrice; that wouldn't
help matters at all. On the other hand,
the entire indifference of John and the
baby was equally out of place. It seemed
to me that there was a middle and Napo-
leonic path in between these two extremes
which only I was following. To be con-
vinced that one is the only person doing
the right thing is always annoying.
“I’ve just made another discovery,”
I said in a hurt voice. “There's a map
over John's head, if he'd only had the
sense to look there before. There we
are,” and I pointed with my stick;
“there s Byres. The line goes round
and round and eventually goes through
Dearmer. We get out at Dearmer,
* we're only three miles from Brook-
e .”
“What they call a loop line,” assisted
John, “because it's in the shape of a
loop.”
“It’s not so bad as it might be,”
admitted Beatrice grudgingly, after
studying the map, “but it's five miles
home from Dearmer; and what about my
trunk 2''
I sighed and pulled out a pencil.
“It's very simple.
wagonette and trunk to wait for us at
Dearmer station.’”
“Love to mother and the children,”
added John.
Our train stopped again. I summoned |
a porter and gave him the telegram.
“It’s so absurdly simple,” I repeated,
as the train went on. “Just a little
presence of mind; that's all.”
We got out at Dearmer and gave up
our tickets to the porter-station-master-
signalman. ,
“What's this
no good to me.”
“Well, they're no good to us. We’ve
finished with them.”
We sat in the waiting-room with him
for half-an-hour and explained the situ-
ation.
thought of Byres, we had not wantonly
tried to defraud the company in order to
get a sight of the place; and that, so far
from owing him three shillings apiece,
we were prepared to take a sovereign to
say nothing more about it. ... And still
the wagonette didn't come.
“Is there a post-office here?” I asked
the man. “Or a horse?”

There's no post-office.”
“Well, I suppose I could wire to

“Not to Brookfield.”
“But supposing you want to tell the
station - master there that the train's
off the line, or that you've won the
first prize at the Flower-show in the
vegetable class, how would you do it?”
“Brookfield's not on this line. That's
why you've got to pay three shill—”
“Yes, yes. You said all that.
I shall go and explore the village.”
I explored, as NAPOLEON would have
done, and I came back with a plan.
“There is no horse,” I said to my
eager audience; “but I have found a
bicvcle. The landlady of the “Lion’ will
be delighted to look after Beatrice and
the baby, and will give her tea; John
will stay here with the bags in case the
wagonette turns up, and I will ride
to Bookfield and summon help.”
“That's all right,” said John, “only
I would suggest that I go to the “Lion’

We left him in disgust at his selfish-
ness. I established the ladies at the
inn, mounted the bicycle, and rode off.
It was a windy day, and I had a long
coat and a bowler hat. After an ex-
tremely unpleasant two mil's some-
thing drove past me. I liſtel up my
head and looked round. It was the

OUR POET PEERS.
THE newspapers have been full of the
contributions to a bazaar-book of maxims
prepared by the Garelochhead (Dum-
bartonshire) Golf Club. These included
a rhymed eulogy of golf by the Duke
of ARGYLL, which opens with the noble
lines:–
“It gives to the bad the sleep of the just ;
It lays the proud low in the bunker of dust;
It raises the humble to sit in the lap
Of tortune made kind by a fair handicap.
For the man of adventure 'tis balm to his soul
To get himself happily into a hole. . . .”
The same high level of achievement
is maintained in the melodious verses
of Lord PENTLAND, the Secretary for
Scotland:—
“So I said it, and think not l said it in jest,
For you'll find it true to the letter,
That the only thing old people ought to know
best
Is that young people ought to know better.”
Wiscount GIADSTONE of LANARK, the
new Governor-General of South Africa,
sends:–
“Fear not for the future;
Weep not for the past.”
This couplet, we believe, has since
been expanded to a stanza by a brilliant
addition from the pen of Lord DUNEDIN:—
“On the Scottish lute, URE
Cannot be surpassed.”
Amongst later delightfully humorous
contributions to the bazaar-book is the
following from Lord CARRINGTON, the
giſted President of the Board of Agri-
culture, whose serious speeches are
always listened to in the most awe-
stricken silence in the House of Lords.
It is surely not too much to say that this
exquisitely pathetic morceau combines
the poignancy of CATULLUs with the
simplicity of Hene:—
“I'd like to be a Viceroy
º And with the Viceroys reign;
Home Agric lture gives no scope
To my colossal brain.
“I'd like to be a Viceroy,
In fact, I'm quite prepared;
But the dear old Daily Chronicle
Asserts I ‘can’t be spared.’”
Lord Piarie, K.P., evinces his wide
culture in the subjoined brilliant im-
promptu :—
“Non omniA possumus OMNES.
The scholar versed in classic Greek
May be unskilful with his cleek.
The smartest, lest set-up Bimbashi
May be a duffer with the mashie.
Lloyd George, that very gifted Taffy,
ls not a flyer with his baſſy.
Ev’n I, who write these deathless rhymes,
Have missed the blooming ball sometimes."
Another amazingly coruscating con-
tribution is the following quatrain from
the polished pen of Lord EveRSLEy, who,
as Mr. SHAw-LEFEvite, was known as the
wittiest of our aediles:–
“Though never partial to the Muse,
Your kind request can't refuse.
I therefore beg you in these lines
‘Make hay while good old Phoebus shines.’”
Lord Court.NEY originally forwarded
an epic poem on Proportional Represen-
tation, but afterwards generously substi-
tuted this dainty little stanza:–
“In my youth men studiel
Commerce, letters, law;
Now they spend the live.ong day
Over the Jig-saw." .
Lastly, the Earl of GRANARD sends the
following pithy distich fraught with a
world of wistful meaning:–
“If life's sometimes a burden to a baronet,
Uneasier lies the head that wears a coronet.”
“A camel corps was in waiting, but Colonel
Roosevelt and Mrs. Roosevelt . . . elected to
travel to-day in a dog car. Others of their
immediate parly mounted horses or donkeys.”
Boston Transcript.
The Colonel modestly waving away the
herds of camels, horses and donkeys, and
selecting the humble dog-what a pic-
ture for a Landseer! (By the way, you
did recognise him as “Colonel,” didn't
you?) -

LONDON CHARIVARL
PUNCH, OR TH
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, March 29.
—To-day House preserved its unique
record as the place where the unex-
pected happens. At length Lords and
Commons have actually come to grips
on question Who shall be predominant
partner. The ring is cleared. Round
the roped enclosure gathers crowd
eagerly watching. Natural to expect
that the champions would comport them-
selves in manner suitable to historic
occasion. They were the piek of the
fighting men. Now we should see some
pretty play, some swift attack foiled by
smart manoeuvre, feigned retreat leading
up to sharp attack.
To tell the truth there was nothing of
the kind. Had the matter at issue been
an ordinary amendment to commonplace
clause, the manner of PREMIER and
LEADER of OPPosition could not have
been less emotional, the passion of
the opposed hosts less deeply stirred.
Asquith struck keynote by studiously
restrained manner, unbroken moderation
of phrase. Throughout he was frigidly
argumentative. Made no appeal to
passion or prejudice.
FLUELLEN LLOYD GEORGE, seated next
to him, dumbly marvelled. How dif-
ferent would have been the scene had
The FLIPPANT “A Risto.”
“Ah, my dear Asquith ! so this is your
Revolution 1 Most interesting, and so impres-
sire—what?!!”
[“The Leader of the Opposition made an
attempt in a flippant manner to laugh these
Resºlutions out of court.”
Mr. Winston Churchill.]
Counsel, Fon. The PRosecution.
Mr. Asquith's speech in moving his Anti-Veto Resolution, while a powerful and eloquent
indictm ht, was voted a shade too “frigidly argumentative.”
he been standing at the Table on such
occasion Before he had reached his
ſifth sentence this decorous crowd would
have been transformed into a seething,
shouting mass of humanity.
PRINCE ARTHUR, fresh from southern
sea and sunlit clime, was in lighter
mood. House gratefully laughed when
he spoke with high scorn of “these
piebald Resolutions,” “this harlequin
scheme.” No one listening, otherwise
ignorant of real state of affairs, would
have conjectured that the House was
entering upon battle round a great con-
stitutional question, the issue fraught
with the fate of the Government and the
making of history.
Only time PREMIER really stirred an
audience to which the United States,
France, Austria-Hungary and Japan con-
tributed the presence of their Ambassa-
dors, was in the final passage, where
he dealt with position of the Crown in
respect of the Veto. Recalling how
Queen ElizaBETH in a single Session
vetoed 48 out of 91 Bills that had re-
ceived the assent of both Houses of Par-
liament, he emphatically declared “That
royal veto, then and for long afterwards
an active and potent enemy of popular
rights, is dead as Queen ANNE.”
All eyes were turned upon the Heir
Apparent to the Turone of the Tudors
and the Stuarts, who, with elbows
leaning on front of gallery over the
clock, intently listened to this lesson in
history.
And has monarchy suffered ? The
loudest cheer of the sitting greeted the
PREMI R's answer to his own question.
“There is not a man among us, in what-
ever quarter of this House he sits, who
does not know that the Crown of this
realm, with its hereditary succession, its
prerogatives adjusted from generation to
generation to the needs of the people and
the call of the Empire, is held by our
gracious Sovereign by a far securer
tenure than ever fell to the lot of any of
his Tudor or Stuart ancestors.”
Cheers broke forth again, rattling with
fierce energy along the crowded Minis-
teral benches, when the PREMIER, point-
ing the moral of his story, roundly
declared, “The absolute Veto of the
Lords must follow the Veto of the
Crown.”
This was the one flash of fire in the
long night's talkee-talkee.
Business done.—PRIME MINISTER moved
House into Committee to consider rela-
tions between the two Houses of Parlia-
ment.
Wednesday.—Cousin HUGH inadvert-
ently put his foot in it just now.
Learned, if he did not know before,

QUEEN Elizabeth Exercises her Royal VE-To.
i “Queen Elizabeth in a single Session vetoed forty-eight out of ninety-one Bills that had
received the assent of both Houses of Parliament."
that the House is exceedingly sensitive
about attack on any one of its sacred
Membership whose constitutional mo-
desty habitually withdraws him from the
front of the stage and whose gentleness
of manner indisposes him to withhold
his right cheek from the hand that has
smitten his left. -
Episode strayed into delivery of
speech against PREMIER's proposal to go
into Committee on Veto question. Pic-
turing the dreadful state of things that
would accompany realisation of Minis-
terial scheme, Cousin HUGH genially re-
marked : “There is no greater hypocrisy
than to represent the House of Commons
as a free assembly.”
This fell a little flat. Everyone knows
Cousin HUGII's stingingly epigramatic
way of putting things; accepts it as
a matter of course. This disappointing.
Cousin High out for a shindy; not to
be disappointed.
“Everyone knows it is not,” he
asserted.
Still no one moved to tread on the
conveniently outspread coat-tail. Cousin
HUGii grew desperate.
“Does any hon. Member deny it?”
he asked, looking searchingly along
Labour ranks.
It's a painful story, but must be told.
Nobody moved. The coat-tails flapped
unrewarded on the unsympathetic floor.
At this monent Cousin HUGH’s flaming
eye fell upon the winsome WINSTON
seated on Treasury Bench smiling in
innocence of middle-aged youth. Here
was his chance. Citing case of HAROLD
Cox, driven from House, as he said,
because he was too independent to
please its prejudices, he, casually as it
were, remarked, “The Home SECRETARY
had not courage and high principle
enough to stand up in Mr. Cox's
defence.”
Then the storm burst. If such wanton
attack had been made on FLUELLEN
LLOYD GEORGE, he might have been left
to repel it unaided. But WINSTON! It
was, as J. WARD remarked from under
the eaves of his brown felt hat, like
hitting a woman.
Instantly uprose angry cries of
“Order! Order 1" “Withdraw . With-
draw ' " Cousin HUGII, quickly per-
ceived he had made a mistake.
“I did not,” he inconsequentially said,
“mean to throw any doubt on the right
hon. gentleman's moral character,” of
which nobody had been thinking.
“What did you do for Mr. Cox?”
asked the voice from under the roof-
tree of J. WARD's hat.
“I wrote a letter,” said Cousin HUGH,
“ publicy and openly defending him.”
Then came JoHN DILLON's opportunity
and his triumph.
“That killed him,” he said.
This is the shortest speech J. D. ever
addressed to the House of Commons.
The fact that it was also the most
effective suggests a useful moral.
Business done.—Debating Veto Reso-
lutions. -
Thursday.—RUNCIMAN, though young
in years as Scotchmen count, has had a
varied, always distinguished, career in the
Commons. Little more than ten years
since he entered the charmed circle. To-
day is a Cabinet Minister in charge
of important D partment. Sits at the
Council Table close by WINSTON, who,
before he found salvation, routed him
out of Oldham and for a while seemed to
have wrecked his Parli mentary career.
Two years ago, in charge of the latest
Education Bill he seemed within an
ace of succeeding where BiRRELL first,
McKENNA aſter, failed. On a certain
afternoon, over tea and muffins in the
parlour of Lambeth Palace, the wester-
ing sun looked upon the preliminaries
to signing and sealing a concordat that
would finally settle this long-vexed
question. The sun set; so did the for-
tunes of the Education Bill. The con-
cordat proved to be a mirage.
Of late MINISTER OF EDUCATION
relegated to background. Enjoying
period of well-earned leisure. Suddenly
dragged to the front and (in Parliamen-
tary sense, of course) beaten insensible
by question from Mr. Clough. The
Yorkshireman, gloomy of countenance,
stern in attitude, wants to know, “What
is the portion of any expenses incurred
by the Lindsey County Council, in
respect of capital expenditure on account
of the provision of any public elemen-
tary school, charged on the parish
served by that school in accordance
with Clause 18 (1)(c) of the Education
Act, 1902.”
Read this backward and forward and
see what you make of it.
RUNCIMAN gallantly stood up to reply.
Murmured words inaudible across the
Table and dropped back in his seat.
“Will the right hon. gentleman,”
asked the implacable Clough, “let me
have a copy of that answer?”
“Yes, Sir,” feebly answered RUNCI-
MAN, glad to be let off so cheaply. Let
to-morrow look after itself. Sufficient
to the day is the question thereof.
I3usiness done.—WINSTON nails colours
to the mast once more.
“Mr. Byles asked the Premier if any treaty
existed between this country and France by
which there was assured to both countries in
case of conflict the absolute mastery of the
Mediterran an.
Mr. Asquith. --No treaty of convention of the
nature specified exists between this country
and France.”—Daily I aper.
Still, don't blame the Government
hastily. It's a difficult sort of thing to
arrange off-hand. (N.B. The printer
has, with our connivance, put one of the
words in what are technically known as
italics, with the object of making the
joke leap more swiftly to the eye. We
are always ready to do anything like
that for you.)

Court of SNEFERU, of the fourth dynasty of
Egypt, is six centuries older than any known

man recently discovered in the Dordogne may
be 20,000 years old.] -

Immune as a gherkin from waste,

Embalmed in a resinous paste,
Or ever the sistrum of Isis
Was shaken (for all that I wot),
Aware of the world and its vices,
And up to a lot.
If the fates had permitted your bogey
(Surviving along with the clay),
And by now a respectable fogey
Of fiſty-six centuries, say,
To be gummed with the spice of your
cerements,

Of fightings and feasts and endearments
(RA-NEFER, you dog!)
And Iween, like all elderly parties,
The changes of Time you’d deplore,
For the truth of what love and what art is
Wassacred to Dynasty IV. ;
And the feeble and spiritless flavour
Of notions that afterwards grew
May have started, perhaps, with some
shaver
Like RAMESES II.
“Long years,” you would say, “ere a
varlet
Invented your pyramid style,
The Red Sea was something like scarlet,
We did have some floods of the Nile;
In days when no suitor was craven,
What amorous sighs we would mix!
What letters of love would be graven
On barge-loads of bricks!
How absurd are these mummified minxes
Compared with the maids I have met;
We knew how to answer the sphinxes
When Egypt was Egypt, you bet;
I wonder where SNEFERU's column is:
You call that a scarab, good lawk |

—Yes, that's how you'd ta.k.
But, my bow, you are merely a stripling
Compared with that stony antique,

Some cycles before you could squeak;
For an era of peace and of plenty,
When all things were fair, let us go

our great feat of opening the keyless safe. I
have taken off my coat so that my fingers may
be unhampered, while he has also discarded his
waistcoat and collar to enable him to strike
matches with ease and comfort.”
in the train between Buffalo and—I can
only remember Buffalo, whereupon
Jimmy came up and threw him out of
the window. She repays him by per-
suading her uncle to grant him a free
pardon, and her father to give him a
post in his bank. Valentine, I must
say, had always sworn that he was inno-
cent of the crime for which he was con-
victed; so emphatically, indeed, that he
quite deceived Miss Lane, and the
Governor, and me, and Mr. Lane, and, in
fact, all of us.
But Doyle, the detective, knew all
about him, and wanted him for another
little job done years and years ago.
Three years after Jimmy's release, Doyle
tracks him down to Springfield (Ill.),
where he has become (under the name of
Randall) a reformed and diligent assis-
tant cashier at the bank, and the promised
husband of Rose. Jimmy is ready for
him with a most convincing alibi, which
includes a faked photograph of himself
(IRandall) at a public dinner-taken when
Valentine was in prison. Then, just as
Doyle is reluctantly admitting that le
is mistaken, the watchman dashes in
with the news that Rose's little sister
has got locked in the new safe, and they
don’t know the number which opens it.
This was Valentine's speciality: open-
ing safes by the sense of ouch. (Don't
ask me to explain — I can't.) Shall
he do it and betray himself, or do no-
thing and let little Kitty die? Well, of
course you can guess which he does.
Doyle watches him go through his per-
formance, arrests him, sees his parting
from Rose, and . . . lets him go. “Her
need is greater than mine,” so to say.
Of the three burglar plays, Mr. ARM-
STRONG's contains most play and least bur-
glary. Had the scene been laid in Eng-
land I should have probably called it
unreal; but I am always able to believe
anything I am told about America. Con-
sequently I had an extremely pleasant
evening, for which I have chiefly to
thank Mr. GERALD DU MAURIER. But his
was not the only acting which was good.
Messrs. D. J. Williams and FRED CREM-
LIN gave extraordinarily clever little
sketches of old gaol-birds; Mr. C. M.
HALLARD came out with an inspired ren-
dering of a part quite strange to him
(Red Joclyn, no less): Mr. GUY STANDING

HINTS ON BIRD's NESTING.
THE time is now drawing nigh when
the birds of England make their nests
and lay their eggs in them, and it
behoves every manly boy to be up and
doing, lest these feath red creatures,
which already do so much damage to
buds and fruit, and even the mortar
between the tiles, multiply excessively
and do much more.
Exactly how much damage is done
by each bird I cannot say ; but gar-
deners and farmers will assure you that
they are a pest, one and all ; while as
for nightingales, it is notorious that
they are the best friends to that in-
sidious malady, insomnia, father of
madness and despair. Plovers do not
perhaps work much evil, but is it
reasonable that a wise provi'ence would
have made their eggs exceedingly good
to eat if man was not to eat them? Tooks
disfigure the neighbourhood ; owls
shriek in the night with disastrous
results; hawks kill young chickens (or
so it is said); and wrens and robins
increase holes in the wall, which leads
to expense. In short, the bird's-nester

can very easily, if he tries hard and has
any gift for sophistry, come to look
upon himself as a national benefactor;
and what is pleasanter than that?
Birds build in all kinds of places,
even on the ground. Plovers, for ex-
ample, and the irritating lark (so diffi-
cult to see in the sky and so easy to
lose again) lay their eggs where anyone
can step on them. How much bett r to
remove them and place them in the col-
lection (or, in the case of the plover, in
the cuisine) than to leave them to be
smashed beneath the foot of man or
beast ! Thrushes and blackbirds build
in hedges, and take almost no precau-
tions to prevent discovery. Treat them,
therefore, as they deserve. They ask
for no quarter: give none. After all,
the young birds, if allowed to hatch out,
would merely become only so many more
tiresome fluters and whistlers at evening
and consumers of worms and slugs.
Sparrows build in gutters and pipes
or under the roofs, and often their nes's
cause stoppiges and overflows, but since
the eggs are not pretty and very com-
mon, you need not trouble to take them.
Concentiate your energies rather on the
rare birds and the singing birds. The
nightingale, for example. You can get
a shilling etch for these eggs, so take
all you can find and ensure quieter
nights. Swallows again—these are not
English birds, any more than the night-
ingle; they are emigrants who settle
here (like the Germans) and eat our
food. You know, be ng m honest Eng-
lish boy, how to deal will foreigners.
So get your climbing irons out, my
brave young fellow, and your cotton-
wool, and your box, an | your blowpipe,
and start forth on the great annual ad-
venture. And particularly remember
what I have told you about nightingales.

THE frequent records in our daily Press
of the enthusiastic fecundity of certain
fowls, together with sundry notes con-
cerning conversational starlings, loqua-
cious p rrots, beavers who beave, and
other remarkable members of the animal

cial envoy to undertake a little research
into what may be termed abnormal
developments of natural history.
In several oat-of-the-way spots he un-
earthed items of such genuine interest
that they may well be presented in their
curt catalogue form. What a smart and
conscientious sub-editor could make of
them may perhaps be left to the imagi-
nation of our readers:–

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Robert W. CHAMBERs threatens to grow a little too easily
satisfied with his fluency. He began well with some ex-
cellent historical fiction, and then seems to have got caught
in the fringe of New York society and lost his head over it.
He deplores its decadence, but always with a sneaking pride
in the luxury that makes its vices so easy. In The Fighting
Chance (a good story), The Younger Sct, The Firing Line,
and last ği least) his new book, The Danger Mark (APPLETON),
he has drawn pictures of this society with an impressive air
of authority which is just good enough to impose upon the
foreigner, but can hardly be taken quite seriously by his
fellow-countrymen. Not content with choosing four titles
which all scan alike, he has now returned to the theme of
The Fighting Chance, which may be briefly described as the
struggle between Love and Alcohol. This time it is a young
and innocent girl, as in Mr. BARRIE's Old Friends, who suffers
from hereditary taint—never a very pleasant subject. The
book is overloaded -
portraits of that pathetic pair of Royalist exiles, the Duc and
Duchesse de Lille, patiently awaiting at Newmarket the
restoration of their beloved monarchy.
It is not, however, given to everyone to share Mr. CoopFit's
enthusiasm for the Turf. The sainted Lord Shaftesbury, who
unwillingly attended Queen WiGroRIA to Ascot in 1841,
summed up his experience in a few words: “It was a dull
affair, and I hope harmless.” Thirty years later the Shah of
PERSIA's criticism of Ascot Week was no less crushing. “That
one horse can run faster than another is certainly true,” he
wrote, in that account of his visit to England which he com-
piled for the edification of his subjects, “but why make a.
journey to see it?” Mr. G. W. E. RUSSELI, recalls these
comments, together with much else that is entertaining and
interesting, in his latest volume of essays, Sketches and
Snapshots (SMITH, ELDER). It would be a dull publishing
season indeed without some new book of anecdotal memoirs
from Mr. RussFLI's prolific pen. Happily, the store of his
recollections seems inexhaustible; his acquaintanceship with
the illustrious living and the mighty dead is so wide and
with characters
varied that it
sketchily occupied
in being rich and
conducting little
contemptible flirta-
tions; the narrative
is desultory; the
dialogue thin. Yet
Mr. CHAMBERS has
in him the stuff of
a maker of tales, if
he would only wait
till he has some-
thing to say, and
give himself
enough time and
trouble to say it
well.

is not a dialogue
as the formula
might suggest. It
is not a history, an
essay, nor even a
Treatise. It is just
chatter, and any
who have heard
for the affections –
of a man who is unworthy of either is no new theme for
the novelist. Indeed, the plot of Mr. Edward H. Cooper's
last book, A Newmarket Squire (SMITH, ELDER), if not
actually as old as the hills, is at least as old as that famous
hill at Epsom, which in many respects it resembles. Like
that popular eminence, it forms the basis of a kaleido-
scopic series of those vivid race-course scenes so dear to
the heart of every Briton. As Englishmen we must all
feel (or simulate) a deep interest in that noble animal the
horse, whether regarded merely as a channel for losing
fortunes on the Turf, or in its more domestic moments as a
means of exercise or beast of burden. No lover of horses
can peruse A Newmarket Squire without his love being
stimulated and intensified. As he lays the book down his
thoughts revert with more than usual tenderness to the book-
maker to whom he is accustomed to remit his Monday
cheque with such commendable regularity; he even regards
the Club tape with kindlier eyes. It is devoutly to be hoped
that Frank Vaughan is not typical of his class. He vacillates
so persistently between Mrs. Landon, the wealthy widow with
whom he has long philandered, and Peggy Estcourt, the pretty
girl with whom he has fallen in love, that it depresses rather
than surprises us to find him proposing to the former and
marrying the latter. We turn with relief to the charming
Gee Gee vocally
indulge in that method of conveying information or amuse-
ment, know it is exceedingly good. Like the Brook we wot
of, he chatters over stony ways in little sharps and trebles;
he bubbles into eddying bays, and babbles on the pebbles.
To put the case more completely in prose, he jots down any
odd reminiscence that may occur to him. There is happy
deliverance from sequence, more than compensated for by
constant flow of genial humour. And all for a shilling; but,
mind you, net.
Commercial Candour.
The motto of a certain hotel in Munich is
“Sie werDEN GUT BEDIENT."
A very proper sentiment. Unfortunately for the benefit of
English visitors it has been translated as
“It serves Yoj Right.”

It doesn't sound as though it's going to be very easy. The

TO MR. HALDANE IN MUFTI.
[The War Minister was put up to introduce the first of the “Veto
Itesolutions.”]
As when a man with breast of steel,
Who many a time through seas of blood,
Sabre in hand and spur at heel, -
Has dealt the foe a fearful thud ;
Alone in dongas, after dark, -
Has mown the rebels down in batches,
And been the object of remark
In various picturesque despatches;–
As when a warrior such as that
Puts off his military gear,
Assumes the sombre suit and hat
That fit a plain civilian sphere,
And, posted in a clerkly pew,
His task to check accounts and file 'em,
Subsists as secretary to
A club, or lunatic asylum ;-
Reared in a sternly virile school,
Where discipline comes first and last,
He does his duty, as by rule,
But oh, his dreams are with the past;
Visions of gore that will not wash
Smile from the blood-red office blotters;
His heart is still at Stellenbosch
Tracking DE WET's elusive trotters;–
So I have seen you, Dog of War,
Shin down from off your fiery barb,
Undo your trappings, aft and fore,
And don an academic garb ;
Have seen you slough your martial pride
As though I saw a lion doff its
Pelt for a lamb's civilian hide—
HALDANE among the Veto prophets!
Those “Resolutions,” doomed at birth,
Like “good intentions,” graven fair,
Which form, to make Olympian mirth,
The paving-stones of we know where—
How could you join this paper feud
Which members of a parly gang wage,
You with your figure stoutly thewed, -
Your soldierly command of language?
Indeed, on such a doubtful case
Your lips were never meant to speak;
You have the warrior's open face .
Your soul is stamped upon your cheek;
Stick to your game—the clean, bright blade—
“R. B. for England ' " on your banner,
And leave the politician's trade
To men who lack the Army manner!
O. S.
From The Calcutta Gazette Extraordinary:-
“Whereas it appears to the Lieutenant-Governor that certain dhotis
(waist-cloths) having on their borders a poem entitled “Farewell

“And whereas . . . the said dhotis (waist-cloths) are documents
within the meaning of section 2, clause (b) . . .
“Now therefore . . . the Lieutenant-Governor hereby declares all
copies of the said documents wherever found in Bengal . . . to be for-
feited to His Majesty. . .”
We can imagine an indignant Bengali explaining volubly
to a policeman that it didn't mean “Farewell Mother” at
all, but “All wool, unshrinkable.”
MR. ROOSEVELT IN PARIS.
RAPTUROUs WELCOME.
(Fron our Special Representative, Signor Piccolo Magico.)
MR. Roosevelt's tour, as it goes on, fully justifies my
description of it as a unique tribute to a personality which
has deeply impressed the whole world, vegetable and animal,
as well as human. His reception in Paris has been some-
thing pyramidal. As for the scene at the Comé lie Française
last night, it was such as I have neither seen nor heard of
before. The house was largely filled with students from the
Latin Quarter, and between the Second and Third Acts of
Frou-Frou loud cheering was heard. Happening to notice
that Mr. Roosevelt was not in his place, I left my box and
quickly hurried along the corridor. I found him making a
speech to the students on the Latin g nius as exemplified
by the histrionic profession. One pass ge which struck me as
singularly impressive was the following:— -
“The energies of the actor, if they are continuously
devoted to the realistic portrayal of mean, ignoble or un-
desirable characteristics, cannot but react disadvantageously
on his moral fibre. Contrariwise, if the actor, or actress,
exclusively devotes his or her best talents to the imperso-
nation of such characters as are only noted for their integrity,
honesty and piety, it is more than probable that in the long
run his or her soul will be braced and toned up to a higher
level of moral achievement.” - -
The students were hypnotised by Mr. RooseVELT's vehe-
mence, and by his sledgellammer sincerity. Strong women
wept like men; several fascinating soubrettes were reduced
to hysterics; and a young French nobleman, renowned for his
command of English slang, observed in my hearing, “Golly!
What a corker ' ' Mr. Roosevel T wound up a speech which
lasted for thirty-five minutes, and contained sixty thousand
words, by a poignant and soul-shaking appeal to the students
to be true to the ideals of the ancient l'omans. “Rome,”
he said, “was not built in a day, and the Latin Quarter
cannot be adequately described in a quarter of an hour.” As
the Third Act of Frow-Frou was now approaching its con-
clusion Mr. Roosevelt reluctantly returned to his box.
Friday morning.—I have just returned from witnessing
one of the most beautiful and touching sights that has ever
fallen to the lot of a modern journalist. I refer to the visit
paid this morning by Mr. RooseVELT and his son to the
Jardin des Plantes. Never since the memorable preach-
ment of St. FRANCIS to the birds has a great man exhibited
such gracious condescension to the brute creation. In such
circumstances some men would have gone armed to the teeth,
but Mr. RooseVELT did not take with him even a revolver.
The note of perfect friendliness towards the inmates was
set at the very beginning of the proceedings when Mr. KERMIT
Roosevºlt was lowered into the bear-pit, climbed to the top
of the pole, and ate several buns with an exquisite courtesy
and grace. Confidence being thus established, Mr. Roose- |
velt went the round of all the cages and enclosures, address-
ing a reassuring sentence and in some cases a pithy and
stimulating exhortation to each. What, for example, could
have been happier than this genial address to the giraffe?—
“Your height exposes you to great danger, for, as a witty
writer has said, giants are generally their own killers.
Console yourself, however, with the reflection that the pos-
sess rs of long necks are seldom subject to apoplexy.”
Very felicitous, again, was the mode in which Mr. Roose-
VELT introduced his son to the oldest lion in the gardens : —
“Monarch of the forest, allow me to present to you my
cub KERM it.” -
Great satisfaction was expressed in the monkey-house at
the friendly admon'tions which the Ex-PRESIDENT addressed
to its agile occupants:–

Quite sufficient to intimidate the boldest referee.
Now it may have been our nervousness at such a stringent
test,
Or it may have been the subtlety the other side possessed ;
But, at any rate, the fact remains, when half the game was
done
They were actually leading us by three good goals to none.
When we went to the pavilion for a breather and a rub,
We were sad at such a blot upon the 'scutcheon of the club ;
And we felt the sorrows people feel when every hope departs,
So we busted out a-weeping fit to break our little hearts.
And the tears were so effective that the match's latter bit
Saw our eyes a little reddened but our feet exceeding fit;
And, before the final whistle put a limit to the score,
We had vigorously walloped them by seventeen to four.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CITY CHAT.
“I waxT to be rich,”
thoughtfully.
“Then buy rubber,” said Algernon
from behind his evening paper. “Sell
your holding in Tapiocas and buy
rubber.”
“How do you buy it?”
“I don't know. I'm a child at
business. I think you go to the tele-
phone and just buy it. You don't want
any money—only a loudish voice.”
“Have you ever made money on the
Stock Exchange or anywhere?”
“Never. Ol), well, I once made a
penny on the Post Office Savings Bank.
My father, with the idea of encouraging
thrift, put in a pound for me when I
was fourteen. Nothing further hap-
pened until I was fifteen, when I drew
it out again. Interest of a penny had
been accruing all this time . . . but I
never applied for it.”
“In a thousand years that penny
will come to—to-to quite a lot at com-
pound interest.”
“Yes, we used to work it out at
school. It was about four million
billion pounds. I shall leave it to you,
Charles; and in the event of your death
to the Middle Classes Defence League. I
trust that they will spend it wisely.”
Charles was silent for a long time.
“I don't understand,” he said at last,
“what this rubber boom means. Why
should rubber keep on going up in price
so much 2''
“Because so many more rubber trees
are being planted,” suggested Algernon.
“No, that must be wrong,” he admitted
generously.
“What is rubber used for except for
tyres and golf balls? There's no new
demand for it, is there?” -
“Mats with ‘Welcome' on them are
always made of rubber. I'm ordering
one with ‘Good-bye' on it. It will be
placed just inside the door where it
catches the eye at once, and will be made
entirely of rubber.”
“There are goloshes, of course.”
“And sandwiches. ‘A thin slice of
india-rubber and two pieces of dry
bread, please, Miss.' Yes, there are
plenty of ways of using it.”
“But these are all the same old ways.
That's what worries me.”
“Why be worried about it at all?”
asked Algernon. “All you've got to
do is to take advantage of it, and buy
shares in the "—he referred to his paper
—“in the Burra Burra Development
Company, Limited.”
“Oh, is that a good one 7"
“The very best. Our old friend
Colonel John Tench, late of His
Majesty's Indian Army, and now of
Ravenscourt Park, is a director. Also
Lieutenant Wilbraham of the Royal

Navy and Addison Road. Also Mr. Fritz
Oppenstein. Those names always in-
spire me with confidence.”
“I’ve never heard of them before.”
“Neither have I. But they sound
exactly right. Probity and shrewdness
simply ooze from them—probity from
the first two, and shrewdness from the
other.” -
“Yes, but how much rubber oozes
from them 2 That's what I should want
to know.”
“Dear Charles, you are very hasty.
How can rubber ooze before the trees
are grown up 2 How can trees grow up
łefore they have been planted 2 How
can they be planted before the estate
has been cleared 2 How -— ”
“But if there's no rubber
“I hadn't finished. How can the
estate be cleared before it has been
bought? How can it be bought before
you, Charles, have come out with the
money 2 Now you see.”
“Then it will be years before any
rubber is ready for sale at all?”
“Years. But what a harvest when it
comes. In 1920, it says here, they
expect to produce 500,000 lbs. of rubber.
Putting the net profit on rubber at four
shillings a pound ——”
“Why?” asked Charles.
“Well, they must put it at something.
Putting the net profit at four shillings
a pound, you get—well, there you are,
that's what you get.”
“But I can’t possibly wait till 1920.
Hang it, that's an awful long time. I
always thought one made money on the
Stock Exchange much more quickly
than that.”
Algernon looked at him compassion-
ately.
“My poor friend, how little you seem
to know. You talk as if you really
wanted a piece of india-rubber, and
would have to wait ten years for it.
Never mind about the rubber; you buy
the shares.”
“Look here, I suppose you know that
I don't want to spend money, I want to
make it.”
“Quite so; and I didn't say you
pay for the shares, I said you buy
them.”
“And then what do I do?”
“Then you wait. To-morrow, per-
haps, some refreshment contractor lays
in a new stock of sunlwiches, or there
is a great demand for wedding-cakes,
or I buy my mat; naturally the price of
rubber goes up. Naturally, also, the
price of your shares. Next day the Burra
Burra manager cables that they’ve been
having perfectly glorious weather out
there, with just a few nice showers to
bring up the rubber trees if they had
been planted. So sensitive is the Stock
Exchange that the shares shoot up
still further. Next morning there is a
photograph in The Daily Mirror of a
man who has made £10,000 in three
weeks over rubber; of course, hundreds
of its readers rush in to do the same;
up go your shares again. In the
afternoon somebody discovers that there
really is a place called Burra Burra, and
that rubber trees have been known to
survive there. Once more the shares
go up. At the end of a week or so you
sell—and there's your money.”
“There's the money,” echoed Charles.
“And not only the money, my dear
Charles, but the feeling that you have
earned it nobly, that you have done
something for the Old Country with it.
You have helped to expand the Empire;
you have served your time as a captain
of industry; you have been a landed pro-
prietor and an employer of labour. Ah,
Charles, Charles, it is men like you who
make the world go round.”
“Y-yes,” said Charles doubtfully.

FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.
WE were in the compartment next to
the engine and there were five of us.
There was myself (first always). There
was the Old Man, who looked as if he
owned a large estate in Herefordshire,
but probably did not. There was the
Daughter, who despised her father but
was not going to let you despise him.
There was also the florid Business Man,
who was trying to look as important as
his despatch case. We were strangers,
but we felt we must be talking, so fell
to abusing the Great Western Railway
Company. I love the old G.W.R.' I
abuse and abuse and abuse it, and it
gets fatter and redder in the face and
more prosperous every day.
This time it was the heating of the
carriages. Personally I had been think-
ing that ours was much too hot already,
but the Daughter was as headstrong as
she was handsome, and insisted that it
was not hot enough. The Old Man
obviously had no feelings of his own; I
sank mine in the good cause, and it
newer transpired what the feelings of
the Business Man really were. It was
clear that he had very strong feelings,
and that was enough for us. So we set
to, and said whatever occurred to us;
and any other railway company but the
G.W.R. would have just stopped its
train then and there, and have gone and
wept in its goods-yard before we had
finished. But the old G.W.R. merely
rushed through Warwick shrieking and
rocking with laughter, and that just
about finished the Business Man. He
started with insinuations of gross care-
lessness, went on to impute dishonest
motives, and concluded with a shout
that steps must and should be taken in
the matter. At that we all puffed our-
selves out and determined to make the
most of ourselves by fair means or foul.
The Business Man had the first go,
because it was his idea. He said he
knew the Traffic Manager of the District
(I have no reason to suspect that he was
telling the truth), and would let him
have a piece of his mind. Being a man
in complete control of his temper, he
had only done this once before, and on
that occasion the traffic had been com-
pletely reorganized in the railway uni-
verse, and the manager in question had
taken to his bed for three critical weeks.
The Business Man would have liked to
develop the incident, but we all wanted
our turns, and the Daughter showed
signs of getting hers by force. So he
briefly recapitulated the circumstances
and bound himself to raise—what I
must not mention—in influential circles.
His speech could not have been more
interesting had we even known whether
º complaining of the heat or the
COICl.
The Old Man began muttering about
the station-master at Leamington, whose
intimate friendship he was just about
to claim, when the Daughter started in.
I could not help being curious as to
what official she was going to know.
He was, I do not doubt, a carriage-
cleaner of sorts to begin with, but I saw
the lucky fellow being promoted all
the time the Business Man was talking.
He ended by being something vague
but imperial, the reigning monarch at
Paddington. She would send George
(George came as a blow to me) round to
Paddington the first thing on Monday
morning, and we need not have any
doubt that reigning there would become
at once quite a different affair. She was
not going to be put upon in this dis-
graceful way. George would see to that
all right. I felt when it came to my
turn that I must go one better. I must
know a Director. But why confine my-
self to knowing one? Trying to look
as much like a person used to Directing
as possible, I said, “I am myself a

LITERARY GOSSIP.
(By our INDEPENDENT CRITIC)
THUS far the books of the Spring have
been somewhat lacking in personal
interest; but this reproach will be re-
moved by the publication of Mr. Thody
Lyon's Reminiscences of the Upper Ten.
It is a remarkable fact that the only
commoners mentioned in this charming
narrative are Mr. GLADSTONE, Mr. BALFOUR
and Robert BRowNING. The dramatis
personae, so to speak, include two em-
perors, seven kings, thirty princes and
seventeen dukes, and one chapter has
the significant and impressive heading,
“Ego et reges mei.”
The World's Worth iEs.
Famous luminaries of the past corus-
cate in the pages of the numerous new
memoirs and historical books promised
by the famous firm of Scriven and Scoop.
Fascinating Fairies is the bewitching
title of a volume from the vivid pen of
Mr. Paul Corporal, in which the inner
life of Byzantine Society beauties is set
forth in glowing colours. Mr. Peter
Prior has edited the Diary of Semiramis,
and Mr. James Tibbitts has written a
monograph on CLEOPATRA, showing the
deep interest evinced by the Egyptian
queen in social reform and the emancipa-
tion of women. A fantastic sociological
romance, entitled Blue Beard's Wives,
by Miss Clarissa Richardson, is also
imminent, which the publisher's reader
pronounces to be teeming with ineffable
bonhomie.
GIANTS AT Home.
Dr. Gabriel P. Dreffler writes of The
Patagonians at Home, in a book shortly
to be published by Messrs. Odder and
Strange. As a colonist in that country,
Dr. Dreffler has enjoyed peculiar facili-
ties for studying its inhabitants and
noting their ways, and he has embodied
his observations in a thrilling volume
telling us how the Patagonians play and
fight, what they eat, how they dress and
dance. The volume will be enriched by
an appendix on Patagonian music by
Mr. BAMBERGER, and a photograph of a
giant sloth listening to Mr. BAMBERGER
playing the violin in a captive balloon.
BRic-A-BRAC. -
Mr. Alexander Nibbs has completed a
novel which he quaintly and effectively
christens, Hindhead Let Loose. A famous
man of letters who has read the manu-
script pronounces it to be “at once
scintillating, contumelious and abysmal.”
Messrs. Flathers and Bluff are the for-
tunate publishers of this impending
masterpiece. -
Following on The Mystery of Barry
Ingram, by ANNIE Swan, which Messrs.
CASSELL announce, we note the promise
of The Enigma of Clement K. Longman,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the DiAny of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 4.
—In old Fourth Party days there was
a Parliamentary game much in vogue
known as “drawing" GLADSTONE. Three
or more could take part in it. As a rule
GRANDolph led off, putting to the PREMIER
highly controversial question more or
less subtly devised in form of common-
place search for information. Mr. G.
having replied, Wolff nipped in with
supplementary query. This also met
with painstaking courtesy. Then up
gat John o' Goºst, who, with profuse
acknowledgment of the great goodness
of the PREMIER to humble Members of
the House, made engaging appeal for
further enlightenment.
In this way some minutes of valuable
time were lost. Occasionally Mr. G.,
beginning to smell the rat which every-
one else saw moving through the air,
grew angry. Then followed a scene
which crowned the achievement of
obstruction.
As compared with current opportuni-
ties the Young Men of the 'Eighties
were hampered by the wholesome re-
striction, then and for many years later
operative, strictly limiting the range
of supplementary questions. The old
barrier removed, we may, as appears
at every sitting, have a brisk little
debate on any question that appears on
the Paper.
This afternoon, by concerted action in
which no fewer than fourteen Members

took part, some interposing half-a-dozen
times, elaborate attempt at “drawing"
Asquith was watched with amusement
by crowded House. The morning papers
brought their readers to tiptoe of ex-
pectation. “Awkward Questions to the
Premier” was a common headline
pointing to anticipated dilemma.
But HENRY HERBERT does not lend
himself to this game with the enthu-
siasm that marked the acquiescence of
emotional Mr. G. He underwent the
process with the equanimity that marks
a duck's submission to ablution by water.
In crispest tone, shortest sentences, chil-
lingly matter-of-fact manner, he replied
in succession to the fusillade.
“Will the next Vote on Account be
taken before the Parliamentary recess?”
asked EvelyN CECIL.
“Yes,” said the PREMIER.
“Arising out of that answer”—and
CECIL went on to put another poser.
“I do not think that arises out of
my answer,” remarked the imperturbable
PREMIER. “I said, ‘Yes.’”

junction that your conversation be Yea,

ing into verbosity, the PREMIER met
persistent curiosity with the remark:
“The hon. gentleman had better wait
and see.”
This such a success that he from time
to time repeated it, till the performance
developed into what HALSBURY would
call “a sort of" duet. Cousix HUGH,
STANLEY WILSON, LONSDALE, Hope, WIN-
TERTON and CASTLEREAGH popping up in
succession chanted a query to which
came from Treasury Bench the bass
refrain, “Wait and see.”
The phrase thus accidentally evoked
stuck. Has already established itself
amongst small wits as a catchword.
Nothing new under the sun. The MEMBER
For SARK recalls a curious coincidence.
Twenty-four years ago, the eternal
Irish Question breaking out in fresh
place, OLD MoRALITY, not yet Leader of
the House, was despatched by the
MARKISS to make personal investigation
at Dublin. During his absence the
Government were pestered in the Com-
mons with enquiry as to what course
they intended to pursue. The stock
reply from the Treasury Bench deve-
loped into the formula: “Wait till we
hear from Mr. Smith.' Asquith charac-
teristically puts it with fewer syllables.
But it's the same thing.
Thus doth history repeat itself.
Business done.—By majority of 106
in House of 608 members Opposition
amendment to proposal to go into Com-
mittee on the Lords' Veto deſeated.
Tuesday.—Having what FABER called
“a very nice Tuesday afternoon.”
Nothing but tea and muffins lacking to
domestic charm of gathering. Suddenly
bolt falling out of the blue tumbled into
the teacup and there was deuce of a
storm.
It was the WINSoME WINSTON who
launched it, apparently without design.
Supporting motion to suspend Eleven
o'clock Rule in order to get forward
with the Veto Resolutions, he dropped
hint that as soon as Resolutions are
carried through Commons they will be
introduced in Lords.
Arrangement, as more than ever mean-
ing business, enthusiastically cheered
from Opposition Benches. Correspond-
ing depression in Ministerial camp. The
House half empty whilst WINSTON spoke,
began to fill. GEORGE WYNDHAM on his
legs, lamenting subjection of Govern-
ment to Irish masters. PREMIER sent
for. PRINCE ARTHUR hurried in. In-
formed of new turn of events, plunged
into fray. CotsIN Hugh followed with
shrill demand to “ have done with this
foolish mystery-mongering.” .

ing. As forty years ago citizens gather-

obviously carried recommendation of
saving time. What was the use of
introducing a Bill in the Commons?
Aſter spending weeks upon moulding it
into shape it would go to the Lords and
be rejected. Let the Lords fire first.
CARSON, weeping at fresh evidence of
Ministerial duplicity, would not be com-
forted.
“We are being humbugged,” he
crooned, as if he were assisting at a
wake; “humbugged.”
Business done. — House sat up late
with Veto Resolutions.
Thursday.—The long, occasionally
draggled debate on first Veto Resolution
closed amid turbulent scene. Arranged
that at half-past ten knife of the guillotine
should fall, lopping off amendments and
speeches. PREMIER spoke early in sit-
ting. FLUELLEN LIoyd GEORGE before the

... Strangers in crowded Gallery looked

carried by 339 votes against 237.
A SPRIG OF EDELWEISS.
The sun was setting; the snow moun-
| tains were pink in the glow. In the
valleys the pines came down to the edge
of the lake, whose surface was smooth as
a mirror. In the distance came the
thud, thud of a lake steamer homeward
bound. -
Suddenly the door opened and the
Count entered my room. He was radiant.
He struck an attitude denoting triumph.
The Count was a tall lean man and
quite frank about his appearance. He
knew he was lean. He revelled in it.
He said that without leanness his poses
would be absurd, and without poses life
would be unendurable. He sometimes
stood outside himself, and laughed at
the figure he cut. But usually he re-
mained within and supervised all the
important features of the pose. “A
successful pose,” he used to say, “always
trembles on the verge of disaster. At
the very height of the dramatic one may
touch the ludicrous, and there's an end
of it.”
The Count was triumphant but calm.
I saw it was the Napoleonic pose, the
strong will and terrific personality. I
offered him a chair. The Count relaxed
so far as to smack me on the back.
“My friend,” he said solemnly, “it is
done. To-morrow I introduce you to
the future Countess de la Croix.”
I congratulated him warmly, but with
all the deference due to the dignity of
the situation.
“What a woman,” he, murmured,
“what spirit, and yet what tenderness!”
He mused a moment in silence.
“Don’t say romance is dead,” he cried,
and glared on me.
I hurriedly deprecated any insinuation
whatever. The Count softened. The
curtain had dropped on the Napoleonic
pose. He was now the ardent lover,
ready to face anything. He lit a cigar-
ette and blew rings airily.
“Listen, my friend,” he began; “I
went to her yesterday morning. She
received me kindly, but not as I had
hoped. I offered her my heart, my title,
my very life. She asked the last. Ah,
you may well start. What a woman'
What a mother of lions ! I too was
taken aback. “Mademoiselle,' I cried,
throwing myself at her feet, “it is a poor
thing, but take it when you will.’ My
friend, I was magnificent. And she-
she was superb. Quite calmly she said
no man could win her hand who could
not win her admiration. -
“What shall I do?' I cried. I was
ready to swim the lake, to do anything.
“There is edelweiss on the moun-
tains,” she said quietly, and hummed a
tune.
“But, Mademoiselle,' I gasped.
‘Since you are afraid,' she began
coldly.
I rose with dignity.
“It is certain death,' I said with
admirable composure, “but it is nothing.
It is already done. Mademoiselle, good-
bye.”
That I think you will admit was a
fine scene. If I had closed the door
and gone away at once, it would have
been unequalled, but I could not resist
a little glance back, so I reopened the
door and peeped in. She was reading
the newspaper. What a woman'
I hired six guides and started.
‘Where you will,' I cried. It may
have been the Matterhorn. Possibly it
was only Mont Blanc.
‘Ach,' they said, “it is dangerous.'
I frowned gloomily on them.
“Ach,' I replied, ‘the edelweiss I |"
must and shall have at all costs.'
‘Schaffhausen ' ' they cried; “the

I hooked the nearest
guide with my alpenstock. Saved –at
least I was. But I will not weary you
with all the details of that perilous
journey. Besides,” added the Count as
an afterthought, “modesty forbids.
At last I saw the edelweiss pure and
white as newly-fallen snow. I uncon-
sciously struck an attitude full of simple
dignity. I expected the guides to burst
into song. They would not meet my
eye. I admit it was a grave risk.
‘Cowards,” I shouted, ‘who will come
with me?” Not a man moved.”
There was a dramatic pause. The
Count shrugged his shoulders. “What
would you?” he said. ... “I went alone,
yes, I, Rupert de la Croix went—alone.”
I took his hand, unable to speak.
With an effort he continued, “At last I
touched—I held it in my grasp. I hate
to talk of these exploits. Some of us
will do anything for the glory of it.”
I squeezed his hand.
The Count was now the bored hero of
a hundred fights.
“Let us speak of something else,” he
said wearily. . . . - - - -
“The Countess,” I murmured, “what
of her ?” . . . . . . .
He was again the ardent lover.
“Ah, my Angela, ma petite! Tired
and travel-stained though I was, I
hastened to her. I slowly opened the
door. I began to feel weak with the
strain. She rose to greet me. On my
knees I took her hand and in it laid the
sprig of edelweiss. -
‘You’ve brought it,'
paled. -
‘Yes, Mademoiselle, I answered
quite quietly, ‘you mentioned your
desire, n'est-ce-pas ?’
She stared at me in a daze. I rose,
and looked down into her eyes that can
gleam like cold steel, but were now as
soſt as a deer's. -
‘Angela, I whispered, “it is nothing.
Believe me, I would do more, much
she cried and
more; only, when you look at it, think
sometimes of the risks it took to win, of
the solitary heights in which I sought
it before it came to this fair Lucerne.’
She burst into tears. It may seem
foo ish, but I too wept like a child.”
“And then 2'' I queried.
The Count raised his eyebrows and
smiled quite naturally.
“My friend,” he said, “what could I
do but take her in my arms ?”
+ + + * +
There is a little shop in Lucerne that
has had four sprays of edelweiss in the
window for many weeks. As I passed
it next day with the Count, I observed
that there were only three. I turned to
my companion.
But the Count at that moment was
preoccupied.
-
AN INN SCENE.
It was a longer walk from Hendon
than I had expected, and I was not at
Hampstead till half-past eleven ; and it
was therefore with satisfaction that I
noticed the words, “Hot Suppers,” on a
strip of paper in the window of the
“Crown.” That was exactly what I
wanted and should be too late for by
the time I reached London.
While I was sitting in the friendly
bar, reading the evening paper, the door
opened and an inquiring head was
thrust in. A body followed, lurched a
little, and leaned against the wall. It
was a tall man of forty or so, plainly but
well dressed. His right hand clutched
a stick, his left waved a cigar. A
good-natured weak face, regular enough
to be called handsome by a poor judge.
Black bright eyes. After looking at me
for a few moments with the benignity
of the slightly unmanned, the stranger
asked, “Are you the boss?”
“No,” I said.
“Then,” he inconsequently replied,
“give us a tune.” (There was an auto-
matic melodion in the corner.)
Before I could answer, the host ap-
peared, bringing supper, and stood in
the middle of the room watching my
approval.
While he was waiting the stranger
crossed the floor unsteadily until he was
within two feet of him. “Are you the
boss?” he asked.
“Yes, Mr. Freeman, I'm the boss,”
said the landlord. -
The man was puzzled, as his face
showed.
“Mr. Freeman!” he repeated. “How
d' you know my name?”
“Ah, I know more than that, Mr.
Michael Owen Freeman,” said the land-
lord inscrutably.
“Why, who are you?” the stranger
asked. -
“Ewell,” replied the landlord.
“Cheedle's farm. The Blue Posts.”
The stranger's mental feelers grasped
vainly at these hints, and the landlord
smiled the smile of a clever sober fellow
with a tippler at his mercy.
“Emily,” said the landlord.
The name was illuminative. “What,”
cried the stranger in a warm flush of
recognition—“what, you're not Harry
Evans?”
“Yes,” said the landlord, with a touch
of embarrassment, for it is difficult to
share this kind of effusion.
“Not Harry Evans of Ewell – old
Harry !” (He pronounced the first
syllable of “Harry” as though it rhymed
to “bar.”)
“Yes,” said the landlord, almost wish-
ing he wasn't.
“Then give us your hand,” said the
stranger. -->
They shook hands.
“Straight?” the stranger inquired a
little suspiciously. --
“Straight,” said the landlord.
“Then give us your hand.”
They shook hands again.
“You’re not kidding
-
me?” the
stranger asked in another visitation of
doubt.
“Honour bright, I'm not,” said the
landlord.
“Then give us your hand.”
They shook hands again.
“Well, I'm dashed, 'said the stranger.
“What'll you take 7" suggested the
landlord, perceptibly eager to end these
demonstrations. “Say the word and
you can have what you like—champagne,
port, whisky—” * -
“A drop o' Scotch, cold,” said the
stranger, adding, “Is it really old Harry
Evans? Well, I'm Here, shake
hands once more.” - - - -
But the landlord had gone for the
drinks. -
Mr. Freeman rocked insecurely from
toe to heel for ten seconds; then he
turned to me. “’V' you read DickeNs?”
he asked. - -
I said I had.
It must have sounded curt, for
“You’re not cross, are you?” he asked,
with a touch of anxiety. . .
“No, I'm not cross,” I replied.
“Then give us your hand,” he said.
We shook hands. -
“DICKENs is full of take-backs, isn't
lie 2 " he remarked. - -
“Full,” I replied. * -
“You’re not cross, are you?” he
asked again. . . . . .
I said I was not in the least cross.
He appeared satisfied, and resumed.
“Well, of all the take-backs in DickeNs
there isn't one to beat this. . . .”
He was silently ruininative.
“To think,” he began again—“to
think of meeting—-- You're not cross,
are you? You didn't mind me mis-
taking you for the boss?”
I satisfied him again, and we shook
hands on it.
“To think,” he continued, “of meet-
ing old Harry Evans. After all these
years too. We used to court the same
girl. That was at Ewell. And to think

of him landlord of the ‘Crown' and
me with thirty bob a week. You're
not cross, are you ?”
“Cross? No,” I said with emphasis.
“Then give us your hand.”
We shook hands again.
Mr Freeman looked at me cunningly
and began once more. “He owes me
four shillings,” he said softly. “He
lost it to me at Nap twelve years ago.
and I mean to have it. And now I
know where he is, I'm going to work
this place for all it's worth. I haven't
used a bad word to-day, but, if you 'll
excuse me, I don’t mind saying that I'm
going to give this place blanky socks.
Old Harry Evans, the landlord of the
‘Crown,” is he? All right.”
He became more confidential. “I
don't mind telling you,” he said, “that
I've had too much to drink. In point
of lact, I’m drunk. But I shan't let old
Harry know. O crikey, no! I mean to
do him for that four bob. Every penny
of it. You see.”
He wandered out, and the landlord
came back with the glasses.
“That's a rum thing,” said the land-
lord to me. “I haven't seen that man
for these twelve years, and we used to
be always together. We courted the
same girl. Strangely enough, she's
coming to tea to-morrow with my wife.
We was as sharp and clever a young
fellow as you'd meet. An architect
doing his five hundred a year easily.
But he took to drink and flung his
money about. Tre ited everybody. And
then he was sacked—he was surveyor
to a Local Board—and disappeared.”
Here Mr. Freeman returned and shook
hands with the landlord again and
taked of old times. They recalled larks
together, lark after lark, until very
skilfully Mr. Freeman led the conversa-
tion to cards, and suddenly remarked,
“By the way, Harry, do you know you
owe me two-and-eightpence 2"
The landlord was incredulous.
“Yes,” said Mr. Freeman, “at Charley
Perrott's one night, Number 13, Hamil-
ton Crescent. When we left off you
owed me two-and-eightpence. Ask
Charley.” -
“Very well,” said the landlord, “I
always pay my just debts. Here you
are,” and he counted out two-and-eight-
pence.
Mr. Freeman drew himself up with
dignity, and, standing as steadily as
might be, fixed an offended eye on his
companion. “What ' " he said, “do
you think I'm a man that takes paltry
gambling debts twelve years aſter they're
made 2 No, Sir. I may be low, but
I'm not so low as that. Put it in the

some more whisky.

pounds, but if she’s agreeable she can

staggered to the door and out into the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The scheme of two pairs of lovers who execute a chassée
croisée has already been used by ANNE SEDGwick in her
remarkable book, Valerie Upton. In Franklin Kane
(ARNOLD) she makes a variation on this well-established
manoeuvre by re-redistributing her couples, and so restoring
the status quo. The process is not really so absurd as it
sounds; for the author is almost painfully sincere in her
analysis of motives, and allows no one to speak or smile, or
even breathe, without so many good reasons that you are
sure it must be right. And, if she had seen well to extend
her story—rather too long as it is—and arranged a re-re-
redistribution, I am convinced she would have found means
to persuade me that everything was still all right. For, to be
frank, I take her word for the behaviour of types which I
never quite realise. Gerald, with his contented egoism, is
the easiest to believe in, being the least complex; yet I have
my doubts of a man of quick intelligence who, all his life,
can keep up the closest of friendships with a woman of his
own kind without once suspecting that she wants something
closer still. Helen, again, -
child of the moors and ||
mists, who nurses her un- || ||
spoken passion, and drifts||
desolately and cheaply
about the continent with-
out any taste for its attrac-
tions, her heart being in
the Highlands all the time,
is a character that appeals
warmly to the heart but
coldly to the intellect. Al-

“standards” and her ter-lº

for a hero of 1645, the date of the tale. Having slain his
disreputable father in a wrecker's brawl, he runs away to
sea, takes part in the sack of Cartagena, is made a slave,
liberated, becomes the beloved of a Spanish dame, then a
refugee again, and finally a successful buccaneer—from
which last phase he returns to Devonshire, flinging his
ill-gotten gains overboard, and landing as poor as when
he left. A life so crowded with incident would have (one
thinks) small leisure for the moods and subtleties and the
yearning for “self-realisation ” from which we are told that

simpler, and would sooner walk the plank to an accompanº-
ment of oaths than of philosophy. But for all this I have
my prophetic eye upon Mr. NIVEN, of whom I think to hear
more in the future.
Accomplished master of the matrimonial hunt as Mr. PERCY
WHITE is, I wish that intriguing men and women could be
protected from him by a close time. In An Averted Mar-
riage, an extremely outspoken tale which gives the title to
his volume of short stories (MILLS AND BooN), the author
devotes eighty pages to an old gentleman in search of a
young wife; and I don't think it was worth while. One

|| this story very easy to
write, and as an admirer
of his I should like to add
that I found it very difficult
to read. I am tired, in fact,
of Mr. White's characteris-
tic vein, and my thankful-
mess to him is great when
he gets away from it, as
in some stories here which
make ample compen-
sation for “An Averted
Marriage.” “Abdoolah,”
“The Model” and “The
Janary” are pathetic and
haunting, and to-day, when
an unmarried political can-
didate would seem to be
incompletely equipped for

is a type which I am certain that ANNE SEDGwick has drawn
with authority, yet I can only accept her blindly on trust.
Finally, with Franklin Kane, admirable creature that he is,
the author has not quite succeeded, as Miss SINCLAIR succeeded
in The Divine Fire, in converting a ridiculous object into a
figure of high romance. Probably this was not her intention,
for she can do most things that she wants to. But if she has
failed in this or any other purpose I confess I would choose
her failures rather than the success of a hundred others. She
is, of course, in the first rank of modern novelists, and nobody
who cares for good work can afford to miss one line that she
WriteS.
When, upon the second page of The Island Providence
(John LANE), an experienced reader finds the warning, “Now
this is no milk-and-water tale, but a tale of salt seas,” he
will probably think that he can give a fair guess at what
will follow. “STEVENSON ' " says he to himself, already
scenting blood. By-and-by, however, he will find, with
some natural bewilderment, that though Mr. FREDERICK
NIVEN hints at battles and murders in plenty the leader he
follows is not R. L. S., but rather MEREDITH, or even perhaps
JAMES (HENRY). The result, as I say, is confusion. An
introspective pirate, however possible, is so little what usage
has led us to expect as to be by no means easy of belief.
Further, John Upcott strikes one as unconvincingly modern
the fray, “The Stockings”
comes as a delightfully humorous warning to tactless wives.
But it is “The Swimmers” which really has my vote, and
makes me certain that Mr. WHITE is something more than a
rather flippant and clever novelist.
Among the convenient realities which form the stock-in-
trade of romantic novelists the Foreign Legion occupies a
position of very much the same value as the Sargasso Sea.
As to this may drift all marine derelicts, so to that may drift
all human ones. With the writer of fiction nothing, in its
kind, is too extraordinary for either; and, so far at least as
one of them is concerned, Mr. ERWIN RoseN's book, In the
Foreign Legion (DUCKworth), proves that the writer of fiction
is amply justified in giving himself a good deal of rope. For
Mr. Rose.N's book is not fiction. It is a fascinating, vivid
record of actual experiences. In a brief “Prologue,” curiously
strained and self-conscious compared with the remainder of
the work, he explains how, having led a roving, eventful life,
he lost “the jewel happiness,” and decided to enlist. The
Prologue off his chest, he gives a wonderfully illuminating
account of the existence of the legionaries, and of the training,
quite cheap, which produces splendidly efficient mercenaries
who march well, shoot well, use common sense, and are able
to act independently. It is a fine book, and to novelists who
wish to follow, say, Mr. A. E. W. MASON, it should be as
useful a volume of reference as Debrett to the tuft-hunter.
Anyhow, I like my pirates |

The fashion for a bride to be

a “best girl” has now been
inaugurated, and promises to
become popular. Let us hope

POLITICS AND THE POSTER.
[The coloured announcement of the Army Pageant, to be held at Fulham
in June, represents a Union Jack borne by what appears to be an ancient
Briton, if one may judge by his state of partial nudity.]
HoRSEMAN on your charger sitting
Practically “in the buff,”
Save for socks and loosely-fitting
Wherewithals of homely stuff-
Pelt of wolf or other vermin rudely tailored from the rough ;
So of old you faced the weather,
Fought the best that Rome could raise,
In the almost “altogether”
With CARACTACUS's Greys,
Or with BoADICEA's Cow-boys kept the streets on levee days.
Thus I fancy you, my trooper,
Turning foes and nursemaids pale;
But what fills my brain with stupor,
Makes my shattered reason quail,
Is the Union Jack you carry in a ninety-knotted gale.
I allow it helps the picture
With its pattern micely spread,
Yet, if I may pass a stricture
Based on books that I have read,
You are previous: you are eighteen hundred years or so
ahead. -
Was your second-sight so mimble
You could clearly visualise
Yon superb heraldic symbol,
Could foresee those sacred ties
Which the REDMOND-Asquith bargain beautifully typifies 2
Could you adumbrate O'BRIEN
Letting LLoyd beside him lie,
Cheek to muzzle, lamb and lion,
In the blessed by-and-by,
With the common flag above them in a perfect pageant sky?
No, my brave but early Briton,
No such dream occurred to you;
'Twas the artist's head that hit on
This sublime prophetic view,
Showing in a simple poster what Creative Art can do.
Still, I hope to see your circus
On the Fulham Palace track,
But if you attempt to burke us,
If you chuck your Union Jack,
I shall call upon the Bishop and demand my money back '

Or, of course, for 2s. 6d. you can have the gas alone. The

From the instructions given away with a certain “Lightning

“Take Cough Cure every two hours for six doses, then every
three hours until completely cured.” [Pause here by the way and ob-
serve the “lightning.” “Keep yourself warm and free from draughts
and before retiring take hot onion gruel, and put your feet in hot water
and mustard for a few minutes. The atter is an important part of the
treatment and must not be neglected.”
Our own “Lightning Broken Leg Cure" is now on the
market. Take it every two hours and have your leg well set
by a good surgeon. The latter is an important part of the
treatment and must not be neglected.
MAXIMS OF THE MONTH.
[In the Leonine manner of The National Rerieur.]
It would not be easy to describe in adequate language the
condition to which Great Britain and Ireland and the Over-
seas Dominions have been reduced by the incompetent
aggregation of shouting charlatans and molluscous mounte-
banks who are at this moment masquerading as Ministers of
the Crown. There was a day, from 1895 to 1905, when
patriot statesmen, earnestly devoted to the public welfare,
strove to make their country glorious without regard to their
own interests. Our readers can remember as well as we do
the magnanimous galaxies of genius, marred here and the e,
it may be, by a few examples of talent, that succeeded one
another on the Treasury Bench. Most of them still live and
are only too anxious to serve their King once more. How
long will the country tolerate the criminal ineptitude of the
Cabinet of Cowards which now hangs like a millstone round
the exhausted neck of the Empire?
Take, for instance, the prolonged debate on the so-called
Veto Resolutions which the Government, with their usual
arrogant disdain of the democracy, cut short by the most dis-
graceful use of the guillotine known to history. Those who
listened to the superb and convincing eloquence of a BALFoup,
the ardent and generous invective of a CHAMBERLAIN, the su;-
tained and tremendous philippics of an ANSON, or the glowing
and decorative periods of a LAURENCE HARDy, and then con-
trasted them with the shuffling inefficiency of an Asquith, the
limping and lamentable efforts of a SAMUEL, and the col-
temptibly brazen balderdash emitted by the self-seeking
demagogue at the Home Office, must have realised the pitch
of degradation to which we have sunk under the rule of the
hucksters and traitors who for the ruin of their country draw
large salaries, for which they never did an honest day's work,
from the long-suffering purse of the public.
If the contrast between the two front benches was striking,
what word can be used to express the difference between the
rank and file on the two sides 2 It may be said without the
least exaggeration that the records of Parliamentary oratory
may be searched in vain to find parallels for the massive
and magnificent speeches made by men on the back benches
to the left of the SPEAKER. One of these—we regretfully
forget which—soared to an all but unsurpassable height of
constitutional splendour. On the other side we had nothing
but the raucous bleatings of pot-house politicians and the
“kept "party who happen for the moment to be leagued with
them for the abolition of honest dealing between man and man,
though, for their own interest and that of the country which
they continue to misrepresent, they would be better advised iſ
they frankly accepted the predominance of the Unionist party
and joined its members in promoting a policy which holds a
promise of untold benefits for Ireland and the Irish.
It may be true—we have never sought to deny it; indeed,
we have affirmed it in so many words—that the House of Lords
contains some of “the most blatant bounders on the planet'; ''
but we have yet to learn that Canada has faltered in her
firm offer of a preference which, by banishing unemployment
from our midst, will cause the sun of prosperity to rise upon
a distracted and misgoverned land. Sooner or later the
Radicals themselves will recognise this, in spite of the
ravings of the Cocoa chorus. There is in all Englishmen—
we wish we could include Scotchmen and Welshmen – a
natural spirit of fairness which makes them suspicious of
those who employ abuse in the place of argument. They
will thus, in spite of themselves, be drawn into association
with the great Unionist Party, which can alone offer them a
conjunction of courteous amenity of manners with sound and
permanent political views.

It is Beatrice, is it not?—in Much

About Nothing, as the programme boys
outside the Lyceum in its great days
used to call—who says that a star danced
and under that was she born. What
then of the members of the Espérance
Club, who, with Miss NEAI, as their mov-
ing spirit, have been working so hard
and gaily for several years now to bring
about a revival in England of the old
songs and dances? Were they not born
under dancing stars too? Surely. And
if they had their way this planet of ours
might look to the other planets and stars
as if it danced too.
Miss NEAL has just compiled The
Espérance Morris Book (Curwen AND
SoNs), with a history of the movement
since 1905, when the girls' feet first began
to be too much for them as they danced
and sang while ordinary dull persons
walked and talked, down to the present
time when they have to their credit hun-
dreds of villagers all over England in
whom the old melodies and happinesses
have been implanted. This admirable
achievement is recorded; instructions as
to the songs, dances and singing games
are given; and a selection of them follows,

And if, in the see-saw of human events, they

treatment than they have given us. We must
not retaliate. On the contrary, we should resist
all attempts to degrade them, and let equality
be our motto then as now."—Lady Cook.]
Sisters-IN-ARMs, the fight is done,
The glorious cause of Woman won,
And conquered Man now quakes to feel
Upon his neck the high French heel.
Yet, in our great triumphant hour,
Shall we, like Man, abuse our power
And make of him the hapless victim
He made of Woman ere she licked him?
Nay, sisters, be it our desire
To heap his head with coals of fire
And let him find a foe in us
Not merely just but generous.
The vanquished tyrant sees at length
That we possess the giant's strength;
But, if he do not prove defiant,
We will not use it like a giant.
The light and tender touch, the heart
Of mercy—these are Woman's part,
And in the age that dawns to-day
All thoughts of vengeance shall away.
We will not, in vindictive spite,
Degrade the foe, as well we might;
But let us rather in he sequel
Treat him as though he were an equal.
We don't propose to bar the spheres
Of all professional careers,
But unto men shall be committed
The work for which we find them fitted.
The Church between us we'll divide,
An equal share for either side,
Apportioned in the proper way
The rectors we, the curates they.
So, also, will we leave ajar
The door that leads one to the Bar
And freely let them take their places
As devils unto us, the K.C.'s.
The world of business too we'll throw
Ope to our conscience-stricken foe,
And leave who can to make his mark
As office-boy or junior clerk.

ANTI-STARVATION LEAGUE.
GREAT MEETING OF PROTEST.
AN indignation meeting of London
restaurateurs was held at the Mansion
House on the 18th to protest against the
advocacy of starvation as a means to
perfect health in an article by Mr. UPTON
SINCLAIR in the current Contemporary
The Chair was taken by the r−
Review.
Prime Warden of the Butchers Com-
pany, and the audience included Sir
J. CRICHTON - BROWNE and some of
the best nourished members of the
Stock Exchange.
The Chairman in declaring the
meeting open said that they were met
as rational human beings and as busi-
ness men to put on record their ex-
treme hostility to any movement that
might depopularise the pleasures of
deglutition. The Roast Beef of Old
England was in danger, and they
were there to protect it. (Tremendous
enthusiasm.) He would first read a
little correspondence which had been
triumphs a mathematician would indicate
with a curve. (Loud laughter.) Very
well, then, let their motto continue to be,
‘Eat on, eat ever.’”
Mr. EUSTACE Miles said that, though he
did not hold with hippophagy, he was a
strong supporter of eating something and
therefore wished to record his opposition
to the SINCLAIR doctrine. If he had be-
she give us teeth but to tear good ſcod
apart with?—and where could you get
better or cheaper food, without the
irritating impost of tips, than at-
(Cries of “Order I " . " Orderſ ”).
Nature, he said, did nothing without
a reason, and why did she give us
e'aborate digestive systems but to
digest? If he miqht venture upon a
witticism, Nature said digest, and
collected by their indefatigable hon.

A letter was read from the Secretary
of the Royal Society, stating that
every member of that body—which
included some of the most learned

A letter was read from the Secre-
tary of the Asinaeum Club to the effect
that no fasting man had ever been
a member of that distinguished and
sapient club. (Cheers.)

|Mr. Upton SINCLAIR said just die.
(Loud grief.) He begged to move
that The Contemporary Review be
called in future. The Contemptible
Review. (Applause, followed by “For
he’s a jolly good Joseph.”)
Mr. WiLLIAM HARRIS begged to
support Mr. LYONs. What he said
about Nature was true. Nature
would not have packed a sheep full
of ten-ounce chops it she had not
meant them to be devoured by hungry
men. Pigs, too. Nature made the
flesh of pigs with an eye to the
sausage, because she knew that the
sausage was a sustaining article
of diet to human beings. Speaking
not as one of the uninitiated but
with all the weight of a Sausage
King, he said that, Mr. SiNCLAIR,
when he recommended starvation,
talked nonsense. (Cheers.)
Sir JAMES CRichTon-BROWNE having
delivered an impassioned eulogy on
beef-steaks as the cure of every ill, a

Henry. In the impression retained by the memory,
“Many years ago, when an insurance
case was being argued before a bench of
of Dental Surgeons wrote to urge
upon the meeting the need for energy
and venom in its attack upon the
new heresy.
Lord CourTNEY of PENwith wrote
to say that in his opinion a car-
mivorous diet was not incompatible
with adhesion to the doctrine of
Proportional Representation.
The first speaker was M. GUSTAVE,
of the Savoy Hotel, who riddled the
SINCLAIR theory with shafts of Alsatian
wit. “Look,” he said, “at the Savoy:
shades have ceased to count: it stands, sharply, for a
few estimated and chemished things, rather than,
nebulously, for a swarm of possibilities.
silhouette, in a word, out of the curious confusion of
it all, I save and fix the outline, and it is with my eye
on this profiled distinction that as a critic I speak. It
is the function of the critic to assert with assurance
when once his impression has become final; and it
is in noting this circumstance that I perceive how
slenderly prompted I am to deliver myself on such
an occasion upon the merits or attractiveness of the
entertainment so generously provided for the diver-
sion of myself and friends.
[Lady visitor before swooning has sufficient presence
of mind to ring the bell for assistance.
I cut the
seven judges, the late Lord Craighill re-
marked, in answer to something said by
counsel: “But 2 and 2, you know, don't
always make 4.” “If 2 and 2 don't make 4,'
snorted Lord Young, “I don't know what
we are sitting here for.” Whereupon, to the
great relief of Lord Craighill, Lord McLaren
replied. ‘If the things don't b long to the
same denomination they don't make 4; 2
candles and 2 tons of coal don't make 4.'”
This story appeared in The West-
minster Gazette on April 11th, and
again on April 13th. We under-
stand that it will only appear once
the size of it, the beauty of it, the cost
of it; and then consider the sanity
of a man who suggests that we
are better without banquets. (Ap-
plause.). And an American too!
After what the Savoy has done for
Americans, this is indeed base. (Hear!
Hear!) No doubt if the ideal man
was to be a scarecrow the starvation doc-
trine was sound. But was it? He asked
them, was it? (A voice: “No!”) No,
certainly not. The ideal man was
well nourished, a man whose edacious
lieved in starvation he would have opened
a Starvation Salon, where it could be done . . .
with tact and refinement, under the per-
sonal superintendence of Mrs. EUSTACE
MILEs. But he did not believe in it;
hence his salons were for other purposes
but were no less under that lady's control.
(Wild enthusiasm.)
Mr. Joseph LYoNS stigmatised the
doctrine of starvation as both cowardly
and crude. Nature, he pointed out,
did nothing thoughtlessly; why did
7m.0)'e and then . . . . if
the House of Lords remains obdurate
it will (ter-remble!) be placed upon
the statute book. (What we really meant
to say was that, even if 2 and 2 don't
make 4, once and once makes twice, with
the very best story.)

CRICKET CHAT.
[Just to encourage the weather.]
The CouxTY CHAMPIONslip.
Titº possibility that there is to be a
new method of scoring points for the
Championship has aroused general in-
terest and not a little criticism. The
suggestion is that draws and losses
should equally be ignored, and the per-
centage taken of wins to matches played.
Most of you know by this time what
“percentage” means, so I need not go
into that; but I should like to point
out what a ridiculous system this new
one really is. The futility of it will
become obvious to the meanest intelli-
gence (e.g., yours) if I take an imaginary
example of the records of two counties:–
P. W. L. D.
Kent 26 1. () 25
Surrey 26 10 8 8
Under the new system Kent would be
below Surrey, although all its twenty-five
draws might have been overwhelmingly
in its favour, and only brought about by
rain ' This is absurd. On the other
hand, under the old system Kent would
have been above Surrey, even though all
its twenty-five draws might have been
overwhelmingly in favour of its oppo-
nents' This is still more absurd. The
futility of this or any system, in fact,
becomes ridiculously clear. What, then,
is the remedy ? Obviously—but I must
leave this for another week.
By the way, have the authorities con-
sidered what would be the position of a
county with the following record 2–
P. W. L. D. Abandomed
Lancashire ... 28 () () () 28
Or this?—
P. W. L. I.). A ly, 'I’io
Somersetshire 18 0 () () 0 18
No. And yet, unless every possible
result is brought under consideration,
how can a fair system of scoring possibly
be arrived at 2
FASHIONS Foſt The SEASON.
The changes which have been decreed
by the sartorial experts of the Strand
this year in gents' cricketing outfits are
as usual very slight, but no well-dressed | . . .
man can afford to disregard them. |.
Flannels will, if anything, be worn
whiter than ever, the trouser being
shaped a little closer to the leg, and the
shirt cut full. Messrs. H. and O. Willis
are showing a very smart blazer in red
and yellow vertical stripes which looks
particularly well upon short stout
figures, and is sure to be generally
popular. The price is reasonable and
well within the reach of all.
Bats are again having a splice, and
though the varnish on the back certainly
gives them a dressy appearance, it will
not this year be absolutely de rigueur.
A correspondent writes to ask me if it
is a necessity to have a set of bails of
one's own. It is not a necessity, any
more than it is a necessity to carry about
one's own soap; but it will certainly be
found in the bag of every man who
wishes to be thought really smart. The
same remark applies to the leather
gauntlets and buckskin safeguards which
are indispensable to the well-groomed
wicket-keeper-about-town.
ETIQUETTE or THE GAME.
The success of the player depends
(undoubtedly) a good deal upon what
he does, but it depends, at this time of
the year, even more upon what he
says. On the cricket field, more than
anywhere else, it is necessary to sav
the right thing. Speaking for myself,
I have always found that the following
conversations carry me through the first
match without loss of dignity. At the
beginning of a new season every young
player should commit them to memory.
As a Batsman.
“No, sixth wicket down. . . . Well,
it's my first game this season. In fact,
I asked Bill to— . No, haven't
touched a bat at all. . . Yes, I was
seeing them rather well at the end of
last season. Oh, I never keep
my average. I always think— . .
Well, no, not quite so much as that.
. . . Hallo, there goes Gerald ! What
did he make—ten ? . . Hard luck,
Gerald. I don't wonder at anybody
getting out to-day. Ah, well, I
haven't touched a bat this season, you
know. . . By Jove, Robinson's out. . . .
Bad luck, Robinson. I expect we shall
all get out pretty quickly to-day. . .
Perhaps not you others, but I haven't
touched a bat myself, you know. . .
You in, James? Mind you make some.
- No, take mine. It won't matter
much what I have; you see, this is my
first— . . . No, not for a long time.
. Oh, I asked Bill myself. . . .
“Yes, I'm in next . . . Oh well, I
'shan't keep you waiting long . . . No,
last season I did pretty well. But I
always think that in one's first game—
No, simply haven't touched a bat.
. It is rather absurd, only Old Bill
wanted me to play . . . Oh no, I don't
expect to—it's just for the ſun of the
thing . . . Hallo, Brown's out. . . .
Well, see you again soon. . Hard
luck, Brown. You know I haven't
touched— . . One leg, please. . . .
Yes, we are going out rather quickly.
We don't get much practice, you know.
I simply haven't touched a bat myself.
. Is that right, umpire 2 . . .

it must have come back a lot. -

it only wants hitting. Of course not

CULTURAL HINTS FOR APRIL.
(By “HIGHLY CoMMENDED.")
WATERING.—During a dry April the
garden requires at least one thorough
soaking. A little ingenuity will enable
you to effect this without incurring the
arbitrary exaction which the water com-
panies impose upon the use of a hose-
pipe. Open the back door; remove the
stair carpet; and by means of a small
chip of wood (a match will do very well)
wedge down the ball which automatically
controls the bath-cistern tap. In the
course of an afternoon the water will
find its way into the most remote corners
of the garden, thus not only saving you
many hours of laborious work but
affording a very pleasing spectacle in its
descent.
To MAKE A HoT-BED.—The simplest way
is to pour a kettleful of boiling water
over the selected bed. The treatment
should be repeated as long as it is de-
sired to keep the bed hot.
THE KITCHEN GARDEN.—The vogue of
“natural gardening,” which has revolu-
tionised the flower department, need not
stop there. I continually practise it in
the kitchen garden with the happiest
results. Discard all formal beds. Pur-
chase a guinea collection of vegetable
seeds and without reading the labels
pour the contents of all the packets into
an old hat and mix thoroughly. Sow
broadcast over the entire kitchen garden,
rake well in and light roller. By this
process the ingredients of a mixed salad
can be gathered in the dark. New
combinations of unsuspected piquancy
are being daily reported. Insects, too,
are completely baffled by an arrange-
ment which they cannot understand, and
they invariably leave the garden in a
body.
MULCH. —I have frequently come
across this name in gardening manuals,
but I have never grown it. Possibly it
is an implement. If an insect, strong
gas-lime would certainly be effective.
NoveLTY of THE SEASON.—The Theodore:
a new pumpkin; a sport of the old
President stock, with a tendency to
revert to type every four years. Throws
out immense shoots, which continue to
increase if they are encouraged. A
sound cropper, if rather crude in
colour; it should be cut back repeatedly
or it covers too much ground to be
effective.
“Water fell to 36 feet 4 inches on the lock
sill. On Monday the height was guaged at
38 feet 4 inches, a difference of six feet. During
the height of the flood the water measured fully
35 feet, so that there has been a fall of 9 feet in
4 days.”—Montreal Daily Star.
Go on ; don't be downhearted; “guage”
it again.

Then, somewhat softening the blow,

THE DRAMA OF TO-MORIROW.
(A rosy anticipation.)
Why look at living actors? Why
bother about personalities on the stage 2
Come to the Cinematophone Theatre
instead.
It has long been the great drawback
of English drama that plays are written
around the figures of popular actor-
managers, to the detriment of true art.
The Cinematophone Theatre will change
all that. When the player no longer
appears before his audience in the flesh,
the desire for individual ovations will
naturally cease.
What is the Cinematophone? It is
an ingenious combination or rather
correlation of the cinematograph (which
has already abolished the necessity of
going to see races and motor accidents
in person) and the gramophone. The
former flings the movements of the
drama on a screen, whilst the latter,
placed in the wings, reproduces the
voices of our very best actors and
actresses. The standard of these voices
will be higher because none but the
best will be used. A couple of picked
voices, one for the men's parts and one
for the women's, can, with various
modulations, speak the whole play into
the instrument. Dramas need only be
acted once, and that before the camera,
when nobody will be nervous. Every-
one, in fact, will be benefited – the
actor, because he will have plenty of
time to spare for more useful avocations,
such as politics and philately; the
public, because they will get more for
their money, for the Cinematophone can
be made to go twice as fast as the
original performance; the playwrights,
because they will write better plays
(there will be no one-part pieces now);
and the Cinematophone Theatre, because
the box-office will be beleaguered all
day. There can be no doubt that the
Cinematophone Theatre has come to stop.

the wildest inaccuracies and indiscretions, some
of which even the Chancellor of the Exchequer

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM The DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 11.
—Just before the clock pointed to
quarter to four, signalling automatic
closing of series of debates that daily
arise upon process of questioning Minis-
ters, PRINCE ARTHUR strolled in. At
sight of him storm of cheering burst
from Irish camp. Echoed from below
Gangway on Ministerial side.
This really very nice. An old Par-
liamentary hand, hardened to varied
emotions of Parliamentary life, PRINCE
ARTHUR not prone to display emotion.
But at this spontaneously hearty re-
ception a faint blush crimsoned his still
fair cheek, a pleased smile illuminated
his countenance. Not quite clear what
it all meant. Natural to suppose that his
late arrival, blooming with health and
gaiety after week-end spent in the
country, had relieved apprehension.
They thought he wasn't coming, and
here he was. Hence these cheers.
As he dropped into seat on Front
Bench, cheering uprose again, continuing
to interruption of business. Very odd.
Must be more in it than met the eye or
the ear. Whispered enquiry addressed to
LONG solved the mystery. Just before his
arrival there had been animated exami-
nation and cross-examination of PREMiER
with respect to literary exercise of Sir
Robert ANDERSON, sometime head of
A BUDDING PRIMRose.
Mr. Neil Primrose delighted the House of
Commons (and Lord Rosebery in the Peers'
Gallery) by delivering an admirable maiden
speech.

The MUsio of The FUTURE
A blood-curdling little ballad of the Proletariat
by Mr. Hilaire Belloc.
Criminal Investigation Department at
Scotland Yard. Writing in a monthly
magazine, he casually mentioned — as
who should say, “On such and such a
day I bought a horse or a house”—
that he had contributed to epoch-mak-
ing series of articles published twenty-
three years ago entitled “Parnellism
and Crime.”
Irish Members naturally wanted to
know what a trusted confidential Govern-
ment servant was doing in what printers
might call this galley? In reply PREMIER
did not mince matters or phrases.
Denounced excursion into field of
journalism as “gross breach of official
confidence,” “action contrary to Fules
and traditions of the Civil Service.” All
done without consent or knowledge of
his chief.
Even whilst these words of stern
reproof rang through House, PRINCE
ARTHUR, with unconscious dramatic
effect, lounged in. At the period in
question he had been Chief Secretary
for Ireland. It was under his régime
that the contributor to venerated Maga
had been engaged by the Castle authori-
ties on Secret Service work. Putting
two and two together and making five,
quick-witted Irish Members saw their
opportunity, and by inarticulate accus-
ation associated the blameless LEADER of
the OPPosition with the old unsuspected
scandal that had just leapt to light.

Second Veto Reso-
Tuesday.—According to Orders of the
Day and general expectation, debate of
sitting will wander round Veto Resolu-
tions. Actually that highly respectable
but, as it turns out, somewhat stolid busi-
ness plays a part that WILLIAM O'BRIEN,
alluding to his friend John REDMOND in
relation with his esteemed compatriot
John DiLLON, calls “avery cracked second-
hand fiddle.” As hinted above, in these
days of a still young Parliament it is
what is ironically called the Question
Hour that produces liveliest debate, in-
creasingly attractive by reason of variety
of topic. Time was when, in deference
to spirit and letter of Standing Order,
Questions addressed to Ministers might
be put only after due notice. In rare
cases it was permitted to seek elucida-
tion of answer by further enquiry. What
are called supplementary questions, cal-
culated to place Minister in embarrass-
ing position upon probably delicate
matter of state, were sternly repressed
by the Chair.

“It shall be called Bottom's Dream, because it hath no bottom.”
To-day, under new ordinances, suc-
cession of skirmishes swept the House
in its opening hour. First to come
under fire was SEELY. Catechism about
the MAD MULLAH brief compared with
fusillade of questions re-opening old con-
troversy touching Chinese and Kaffir
labour in South Africa. SEELY has not
been to the wars for nothing. With his
back to the wall, attacked by hon.

men opposite, who fire at each other
through his body, he comes out of scuffle
not only alive, but kicking.

shake him. ADMIRAL (of the Blue) BUR-

quarters. Charlie BERESFORD chips in
with enquiry as to what Austria is
doing on the Danube in the way of
launching Dreadnoughts 2 LEE hauls
to leeward and fires shot across bows

comes alongside with searching ques-
tions about German cranes and other
strange birds. He is permitted to fire
right off a volley of six arguments or
assertions thinly veiled in form of ques-
tion.

SEYMOUR Foster, à propos of nothing,
slips in a hit at “unpopular Cabinet
Ministers,” and MACWEAGh, readiest,
wittiest of Redmondites, gets back a
nasty one about “Company promoters
in the City.”
Now and then in comparative pauses
of the turmoil sounds a shrill “Hear!
hear!” from under Gallery immediately
behind REDMOND aimé. This is Mr.
REDDY giving vent to overcharged feel-
ings. He doesn't mean anything, whether
in the way of approval or dissent. But
excitement must find vent, and it is
quite Parliamentary to cry, “Hear !
hear!” However grave may be the
business to the fore, however high angry
passion may have risen, Mr. REDDY's piping
falsetto “Hear! hear!” with its under-
current of almost childish delight is
answered by roar of laughter. This
clears the air for a moment. Then the
hounds of interrogation are off again on
fresh tack, having caught scent of CHAN-
CELLOR OF EXCHEQUER.
“Such larks!” as Joe Gargery used
to say to Pip. The only persons in-
clined to regard situation with appre-
hension are the Members, considerable
in number, who, having in obedience to
Standing Order given notice of ques-
tions which appear on printed paper,
find themselves at a quarter to four
swamped by flood of controversial acri-
mony. ... "
Business done.—Lively miscellaneous
debate in Question Hour. Later, dull
discourse on Veto Resolutions.
Thursday. — Dull debate droning
through four days suddenly flamed up.
At 7.30 blade of guillotine would fall.
PREMIER intervening proposed to state
what would be done in event of Lords
throwing out Veto Resolutions. PRINCE
ARTHUR objected on point of order.
Difficult position for CHAIRMAN OF CoM-
MITTEES. Mr. EMMoTT as usual rose to
occasion. -
“I have not,” he said, “yet arrived
at what the right hon. gentleman is
going to say.” -
Could not therefore judge whether he
was or was not in order.
“What I was going to say," the PRE-
MIER explained, “is this. If the Lords
fail to accept our policy as embodied in
these Resolutions——”
| PRINCE ARTHUR up again, still object-
ing. CHAIRMAN deferred to obvious
technicality. Asquith postponed state-
ment till motion for adjournment.
At eleven o'clock PREMIER made his
statement. Announced that if Lords
throw out Veto Resolutions “we shall
feel it our duty immediately to tender
advice to the Crown.”
This note of battle echoed with
enthusiasm on Ministerial side. Here
was proclamation of war. Houseroused
to state of frantic excitement. Earlier,
when Resolutions were agreed to and
PREMIER brought in Bill founded upon
them, Radicals had sprung to their feet
and vociferously cheered. This nothing
to scene that followed on adjournment.
Once more Members on Ministerial side
rose en masse, madly cheering. Oppo-
sition vigorously replied. It occurred
to some 'twas time to go out and look
for taxi-cabs; still as they passed forth
they wildly cheered.

passed by majorities that steadily main-
tained the average of the round hundred.
A Rumour.
Mr. LEVER's present soap case (Hudson
v. Gossage) has, we hear, caused much
heartburning in Carmelite House. The
Brethren complain—and we think the
complaint quite reasonable—that, after
their long and close association with
Mr. LEVER in so many of his trials, their
ungenerous exclusion from participation
in the present one is an act that almost
savours of discourtesy.

which have been kindly placed at his

cussion of Venus suggests the kindred
case of Mars. This must be my excuse
for obtruding on your notice a curious
personal experience which recently fell
to my lot while staying with my old

friend, Professor Schiaparelli. The Pro-
fessor, as your readers are doubtless
aware, is a great expert on the subject
of Mars, and amongst other artistic
trophies is the proud possessor of a fine
portrait by CANALErro. Looking at it in
a strong light one day, I was startled to
observe a complicated cipher on the
upper right-hand corner of the picture,
and, examining it carefully through an
astigmatic myoposcope, I made out
clearly the initials R. J. (Richard
JEBB 2) surmounted by an imperial
crown and supported by a coronet.
May I suggest that, after completing
their investigations into the signature
of the Rokeby Venus, your committee
should proceed to Bologna to settle the
question of the Canaletto Mars. It is
by such acts as these that international
amity is promoted.
Yours, etc., PIPSTON Rivers.
SIR,-Anyone can sign a picture, but
to paint one in the manner of WELASQUEz
is, as SHAKSPEARE says, quite another
story. For instance, I never sign my
pictures, but their problematic character
renders them recognisable at a glance,
and I am quite certain that your com
mittee would never fail to distinguish
them from those of SARGENT, ORPEN,
Bosboom, or MARIs.
Yours, etc., John CokeR.
SIR,-The Committee you have invited
to inquire into the alleged presence of
markings or ciphers on the Rokeby
Venus is by no means bad so far as it
goes. But there are some unaccountable
omissions which I trust you will remedy
before the work of inspection is seriously
begun. The National Gallery is an
imperial asset, and it is impossible fully
to master the great lesson how to think
imperially without knowledge of the
treasures enshrined beneath that ma-
jestic cupola. Hence the paramount
importance of including representatives
of the Imperial Evolutionary Idea on the
Committee. To supply this crying need,
I should suggest the addition of the
names of Mr. Richard JEBB, Mr. Pipston
Rivers, Mr. FAbiAN WARE, the Hon. A.
BATHURST, and possibly Mr. ALGERNoN

SIR,-I think I can throw a little light
on the mystery which has been puzzling

hatchet face hurrying along carrying a
large roll several feet in length. As he

little doubt that when I saw him, still
smarting from his defeat at Blackburn,
this unscrupulous opponent of the Im-

strange marks debated by Mr. GREIG.

“THE NAKFD TRUTH.”
Though Mr. Ch.ARLEs HAWTREY always
plays the sort of man whom in real life
I detest, yet I must conſess that I find
him, as played by Mr. HAwtrey, irre-
sistible on the stage. In this play, by
GEORGE PASTON and W. B. MAxwell, at
Wyndham's, Bunny Darrell is the usual
man-about-town-and-in-the-city, with
this difference: that owing to the
influence of a magic ring (which his
uncle has brought home from India) he
suddenly finds himself forced to tell the
truth on every proper and improper
occasion.
At the end of twenty-four hours of this
he is practically ruined—libel actions,
divorce actions, and every other kind of
action are hanging over him; the girl
he loves is leaving him, the woman he
philandered with is threatening to stay
with him. But he has gained one
friend. His uncle is struck by the
noble way in which he denounces the
fraudulent company of which he is
secretary, and promises to give him
a fresh start (with legacies in prospect).
At this happy moment Bunny manages
at last to get the ring off his finger.
To the satisfaction of himself and all
his friends, the fatal gift of truth leaves
him; quarrels are made up and every-
body is happy again. (Even, no doubt.
the cook, who had been told that her
omelettes always seemed as though they
had sat up all night.)
Now, shall I put the discarded ring on
my own finger, and say that the idea is
old to the point of stiffness; that an
unpleasant atmosphere of bowdlerised
intrigue hangs over some of the action;
that at times, particularly in the First
Act, the humourisattenuated toadegree?
Never! Let me rather say, as I said
before, that Mr. HAwtREY is as irresistible
as ever; that he has a way of saying the
most ordinary thing so that it sounds
extraordinarily funny; and that in the
last two Acts he really has a number of
funny things to say.
Let me call attention also to some
splendid acting by other members of the
company. Mr. ERIG LEwis is always
amusing; but, in addition to his, there
were two excellent performances by
Mr. GEORGE BELLAMy, as Prosser, a stock-
broker's clerk, and Mr. ERNEST THESIGER,
as Teddie Lestrange, the usual over-
dressed idiot, with in th’s case the most
delightful lisp. (Mr. ERIG. LEwis, by
the way, was Mr. Hayter, “the biggest
flirt in the Royal Society.”) Mr. ARTHUR
PLAYFAIR and Mr. LYLE, too, who were so
good in The Little Damozel, were good
again. You understand that I do not
need to take the ring off to say that all
these help to provide a very enjoyable
evening's entertainment. -

if you're afraid of being a coward that shows you wouldn't

time. (This is too like the blind lady story, and also perhaps
a little too gruesome.) But the author's “shock tactics” are
not confined to situations. He never allows us to forecast
his next swift turn of phrase or fancy. Of course he
cannot always conceal—what jester can 2—that his humour
is designed; that he means, in fact, to be funny. But he
seldom gives away his processes. For the rest, what malice
lurks in his satire remains impersonal and hurts nobody. A
really charming volume, and one of the rare sort which
makes you feel that its author has paid you a compliment in
hoping that you will enjoy it.
Before I came across Messrs. DUCKWORTH's helpful hint
that The Diary of an English Girl is the genuine article, and
so “free from literary artifice,” I took it for an elaborate
satire on the old-fashioned critics who were blind to the
virtues of certain other diaries of yesteryear, chiefly remark-
able for the unpleasant impression they gave of the modern
maid. I imagined the anonymous --
author saying, “We have piped
unto you, and ye have not danced.
You object to strong meat. Bien.
I will give you milk-and-water,
and see how you like it.” But it
seems I was wrong. The book is
a human document, a real bond-
fide diary, “the delicate self-por-
trayal of a girl of eighteen,” and
its record of picnics, riding expe-
ditions, dances, Christian Science
“treatments,” unrequited love and
tears—especially tears—must be
judged accordingly. “He loves
me, he loves me not ” (“he” being
a stalwart undergraduate of Cam-
bridge), sighs the maiden over and
over again, and, with each fresh
petal that she plucks from the
innocent daisy of her poor little
attachment, weeps bitterly.

sake when she learnt the sad truth
from the very last petal, and

few men are better qualified for the task of producing such
a record. Its performance is hampered by the exhibition of
strong personal feeling displayed, with exceedingly rare
exception, against his former colleagues. An unconscious
humour runs through the long story. At least a dozen times
Mr. O'Donnell presents himself to the consideration of the
reader as the impartial historian. The remark is generally
preliminary to an exceptionally savage attack on PARNELL
or his Parliamentary Party. But, though sedulous in
endeavour to depict the Irish Leader as a lath painted to look
like an iron bar, he refuses to others the joy of recrimination.
In fact, their indulgence in that habit is seized as opportunity
for dealing a whack all round. In one of his vitriolic attacks
he thus describes the attitude of PARNELL's followers when
disaster fell upon the chief:—“They used to escape penury
by blind obedience to Parnell. They could now throw
Parnell to the wolves who ravened for his ruin and feel com-
placently satisfied that they could afford themselves that and
- – other luxuries.” This is said more
Hibernico. In the altered circum-
stances of to-day we see it break-
ing forth again in the compliments
publicly exchanged between Mr.
REDMoND on one side, and Messrs.
O'BRIEN and DILLON on the other.
Making due allowance for it, stu-
dents of the history of one of the
most remarkable and far-reach-
ing evolutions of home politics
achieved in the last half-century
will find Mr. O'Donnell's book
rich in information and suggestion.
I am sure that if KATHARIXE

it is, I leave them feeling that they
are scantily equipped with ex-
perience for life in a complicated
world. Take the case of Dolly

number of petals. (If you work the sum out you'll find that
I'm right.) But our Niobe — for her wealth of tears is
almost classical–has her consolations. She writes nice little
verses, quite good enough, to judge from the samples in her
diary, for the evening papers, and short stories which bring
grateful letters and cheques from the editors of the maga-
zines. And, in spite of her passion for crying, she is much
nicer than the “literary artifice” girls who write those other
diaries. -
In his day FRANK HUGil O'DoNNELL, one of the most
brilliant of the Irish Parliamentary Party that came to West-
minster under the leadership of Isa Ac BUTT and were sub-
sequently captained by PARNELL, was also its Ishmaelite. A
quarter of a century ago, resenting the action of the Land
League, he withdrew from the arena. He reappears, bringing
with him two portly volumes labelled A History of the Irish
Parliamentary Party from 1870 to 1890 (LONG MANs). As
for a dozen years he lived and worked behind the scenes,
herself with a local bounder possessing motor-cars and a
dangerous fascination, who was instinctively avoided by the
almost equally beautiful Betty. The affair was harmless,
but Dolly was cut by the county. Then came the great
cricket match, where, after being publicly snubbed (and
even refused a cup of tea) by several rich parvenues, the
victim of social spite was dragged gloriously from Coventry
by Lady Castledown herself; and, right on the top of this, had
the luck to rescue the child of her most venomous assailant
(the bounder's wife) from death at the mouth of a mad dog.
There are some very pleasant, likeable characters in Betty
Carew, and I am glad to have met them; but a maſſ dog

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PEERACE MUTUAL SELF-RESPECT INSURANCE CO., LTD.
[Motto: Nolo nobilitari.J.
This Company is to be formed immediately after the
Spring Recess, for the purpose of providing Insurance
against the risk of an offer of a Peerage under the Asquith
Guarantees Scheme. It is felt that, though the Liberal Party,
as a whole, may be in favour of correcting the political balance
in the House of Lords by the creation of 500 new Peers
individual members of the Party will naturally recoil from
the prospect of receiving an invitation to the Peerage under
conditions so subversive of self-respect. The Company's
Policies are therefore expected to appeal to a very wide circle,
embracing in particular:
1. Liberal Members of Parliament.
2. Liberal Candidates recently defeated at the Polls.
3. Gentlemen who, from motives of simple loyalty, have
generously subscribed to the Liberal Party Fund, the Budget
League, the Gladstone League, and other subsidiary Party
organisations. - * /*
4. Editors and other gentlemen of the Press who as a
matter of conscience have supported the Liberal Party,
whether right or wrong. ** - ** * *
5. Gentlemen not already included in this category who
by other services to the Liberal Party have inadvertently
rendered themselves liable to Official Recognition. i.
6. Baronets of Liberal creation, who, by their proximity
to the Peerage, are peculiarly exposed to the above insidious
assault upon their dignity. -
7. Knights of Liberal creation, similarly exposed, but in
a less degree. -
Insurance will be effected upon a sliding scale according
to the risk indicated. Thus a Liberal Member who has been
returned by a large majority will be invited to pay a much
higher premium than a Member whose seat is regarded as
shaky. Subscribers, again, of large sums to the Party
coffers will not be accepted at the same attractive figure as
subscribers of a comparatively modest amount. . . .
Favourable terms will be allowed to those who limit their
risk to the offer of an Hereditary, as opposed to a Life,
Peerage. At the same time it must be understood that such
offer, though implying the recipient's eligibility for association
with a degraded Second Chamber, will not be regarded as
constituting a sufficient insult on which to found a claim
upon the Company's benefits, unless the offer specifies in-
clusion among the 500. Gentlemen, therefore, who antici-
pate appointment to a Colonial Governorship, entailing the
penalty of a Peerage, are warned that they will not be ac-
cepted as Policy-holders. In any case, as set out below, their
claims would be invalidated by the acceptance of a Peerage.
As a measure of precaution, claimants of the Company's
benefits will be required to prove in black and white the
receipt of an invitation to the Peerage, signed by the
Prime Minister, and witnessed jointly by a Justice of the
Peace, a Mayor, and a Chartered Suffragette.
Claims will be invalidated—
1. By the actual acceptance of a Peerage.
2. If it can be shown that the Policy-holder, after taking
out his Policy, has committed some conspicuous act of loyalty
to the Liberal Party with the object of securing the insult of
an invitation to the Peerage, and so enjoying the Company's
benefits.
3. If it can be shown that a Policy-holder, after taking out
a Policy, offers a bribe to the Party Chest with the object of
securing the said insult and so pocketing the difference
between his bribe and his insurance money.
4. If any announcement of the said insult, appearing in
the Press, can be traced to the recipient's initiative. Rights
of publicity will be confined to the Company's books, which
... be open to inspection by Shareholders and Policy-holders
only. t
Among its many other attractions, the Company will offer
special facilities to any group that may desire to take out a
Policy en bloc against the risk of a general invitation to the
Peerage: e.g., a company of the Guards, the Staff of The
Daily Chronicle, or the congregation of the Rev. SILVESTER

DEAREST DAPHNE, -The most sensa-
tional wedding of the season, so far, has
been the Marquess of Midlands and
Gwendolen Carruthers's. When it got
about that the bride was not an Ameri-
can, and not from the Merriment Theatre,
but just an English gentlewoman, a
huge crowd collected, stormed the
church, and blocked all the streets near.
It was all Midlands and Gwendolen
could do to reach their brougham after-
wards; and there was such a dreadful
fight among the camera-men trying to
snap-shot the bride that poor Gwen
almost fainted. The dowager Midlands,
who has an old-fashioned horror of
publicity and bruit, says she's inclined
to be sorry her son has done such an
outré, conspicuous thing as marry a
countrywoman of his own and his equal
in birth; but Midlands says his only
regret is that he didn't charge ten-and-
six a head for admission to St. Agatha's!
I gave a most enormously successful
dinner-dance for the Hairy Ainus the
other night. People were ready to kill
each other for invitations to meet them.
There was such a frightful crush on the
staircases after dinner that I'm quite
certain hundreds got in who weren't
invited.
The Ainus are simply quite We
couldn't have any knives or sharp things
at dinner—they're not to be trusted with
them. Isn't that a dilly idea? We're
all tremendously gone on one of them,
the Hairiest and Ainuest of the lot. A
charming creature, my dear! I hear
he had some brothers even sweeter than
himself, but he killed them before leav-
ing wherever it is they come from.
During the evening, Popsy, Lady Rams-
gate, who is a good deal éprise, asked
him to dance. She was trying to make
him understand, when a Hairy Ainu-ess
(she looked awfully chic-you couldn't
see anything of her face but her lips,
and they were tattooed) became so
threatening and violent that Popsy was
frightened and backed out.
Stella Clackmannan (you know what
a clever amateur artist she is) had this
particular Ainu to Clackmannan House
to do his portrait. But at the first
sitting, just as Stella was “putting him
in,” as she calls it, something put him
out. He lost his temper all of a sudden,
and when the Hairy Ainus lose their
tempers, my dear, they do lose them'
Stella screamed and ran out of the
studio. The man who manages him
couldn't manage him; the duke came
in to help; but in spite of the man and
the duke he smashed almost everything
in the studio. Isn't he a sweet creature?
He's going to be the rage in London
this summer.
We're all rubber-mad still. I’ve had

I gave a rubber lunch at the Recherché.

her parties. It won't last, of course.
As I said to Norty yesterday, as soon as
the boom 's over, they and their parties
will be dropped. “That won't matter,
though,” he said. “Their parties being
rubber balls, the more you drop them,
the more they'll bounce up again.”
Descendants have been a good deal
in the air lately. I’ve been whipping
my brains up trying to arrange a pageant
or kick-up of some kind with descen-
dants in it. I thought of descendants
of highwaymen and descendants of
Derby winners; but I can't make up
my mind which of the two would make
the snappiest show.
Pity me, dearest. I've a young
cousin from the wilds of Devonshire on
my hands. It's all my absurd good
nature. Her people pleaded with me on
the bended to take her, lick her into
shape, and erase the memory of some silly
love-affair with a young wandering artist.
And so behold your poor Blanche

fixed colour and an immense capacity

things, and has a funny little set of

child blushes! Isn't it a funny arrange-
ment that the people who have last
cause for blushing, do it all? I've
taken her to task on this point and some
others. “You must not blush, Rose-
mary,” I tell her. “Blushing is quite
out. And you must talk, my child.
Even if you've nothing to say, you
must say it. The old saying, Silence
is golden, certainly doesn't apply in the
marriage market — silent girls never
fetch good prices there. And another
thing — you mustn't sit and think.
Thinking is not done. And with regard
to this little affaire-de-coeur of yours,
no girl ought to think seriously of an
artist unless he's an R.A.—and them
he's too old to think of at all.”
It's a boresome rôle, “With a little

GETTING READY.
We walked through the Park and
observed the rank and fashion of London
—none of them (as I pointed out to Miss
Middleton) more beautiful than our-
selves, all of them richer.
“Speak for yourself,” she said quickly.
“None of them more beautiful than

“I meant the ‘richer' part.

“What do you do with it?”
“I don't do anything; they do all the
doing. James gave it to me, and said
that if I kept it till I was——”
“Seventeen——”
“Yes—and them sold it, I should
make a lot. But I don't think I ought
to sell an uncle's present, do you?”
“I know you mustn't look an uncle
in the mouth, but I don't think there's
anything about selling his rubber shares.
Sell them, and buy me a -anything.”
“Oh, I've got plenty to buy just
now,” said Miss Middleton, confidently.
“It is an expensive time of the year,”
I agreed. “I simply must have some
new summer suitings.”
“You should have your old ones put
away carefully at the end of the summer.”
“I do. And then when I ask for
them at the beginning of May I’m told
that the moth has got them. Moth l’’
I said, bitterly. “What does a moth
want with a pair of flannel trousers?”
“I expect it wants to play for The
Butterflies. Sorry; I simply had to.”.
We walked on in silence for a time—
I gurgling at Miss Middleton's joke, she
brooding over my wrongs. No, that
can't be right. She gurgling at her
own joke, I brooding over my wrongs—
that’s what I mean. - -
“You seem very happy about some-
thing,” I said at last. - -
“But I'm happy about everything.
Aren't you?” - -
“Well, I'm not wnhappy about any-
thing—except that moth, and I do like
seeing you look like this. Otherwise
I'm just about ordinary.”
“Oh,” said Miss Middleton reproach-
fully, “what a shame to say that on a
day like this—with cricket just going to
begin, and dances and everything. Oh,
I'm going to do such a lot this time.”
“I say that at the end of every April,”
I remarked. “And then it rains.”
“But it won't rain this year.”
“Thank you very much.”
“It isn't me, it's Negretti,” she con-
fessed generously. “So now you'll be
happy, won't you?”
“If you're sure it will be fine,” I
said cautiously. “Don’t think me a
doubter, but last year does want some
forgetting. The week-ends in the wet;
the fielding in the cold; Lord's in the
rain. When I think of it I feel that
I've got
I've lost a whole year of my life. 1909
simply doesn't count.”
“But you can't only count the finc
days or what about the farmers?”
“True. Besides I should only be about
five that way. Still, blow the weather.”
“But I’ve promised you this summer
is going to be fine,” protested Miss
Middleton. “Don’t go back on that.”
“Right; I'm a believer. One of the
elect. Hooray!” :
“Hooray! Now, what are you going
to do? Are you getting lots of invita-
tions 2 ”
“Millions.” -
“I simply love getting them.”
“I simply hate answering them.
I generally wait until I've lost them,
and then I've forgotten the day and the
address and everything.”
“You should ask your nurse to buy
you one of those ‘Where is It books.”
“I should never know where it was.
No, you'd better let me go on in my old
way. I get there in the end—generally
on the wrong night.”
“You’ll come to our dance on the
right night, won't you?”
“If I’m asked.”
“Oh, I expect mother will ask you.”
“Yes, she's a nice woman, isn't she?
I must ask her to come to the Oval with
me one day.”
“I’m going to Henley, and the
'Varsity match, and Eton and Harrow,
and the Tonbridge week, and the Army
Pageant, and Ascot, and the Shakspeare
ball,” said Miss Middle on in a breath.
“I’m going to the Surbiton Lawn
Tennis Tournament, and Derbyshire v.
Northamptonshire, and the bazaar at
Leamington, and the opening of the
Kettering baths, and the Polytechnic
bicycle races,” I said in two breaths.
“Oh, anybody can go to all the things
I’m going to,” said Miss Middleton
modestly. - - -
“It’s rather difficult to get into the
enclosure at Kettering,” I said. -
‘ I suppose you know the mayor.
How jolly! Well, we shall meet some-
times, I expect.”
“Halfway between Leamington and
Ascot, perhaps.” -
“Even that might be rather nice.
But it's a long time to wait. I ll
give you an invitation now, if you like.”
“Do. I'll promise to answer at once.”
“Well, come and have lunch with me.
I mean really “with 'me, because of my
rubber share. Besides, I'm awfully rich,
anyhow. We'll begin the season well.”
The sun came out from behind a
cloud and made believe it was June.
(I don't mean June of 1909, of course.)
Miss Middleton took a deep breath and
looked round the Park. |
“Oh, hooray for everything that 's
coming,” she said soſtly to herself.

FISCAL FANCit.S. -
[Being Letters to any Editor who may care to print them.]
1.
SIR,--In the article which appeared in your columns yester-
day, Mr. John Welbore puts the following question to Tariff
Reformers. Supposing, he says, that the imports of raw
materials are balanced by the exports of manufactured goods,
what will be the effect of a duty of two shillings on wheat,
allowance being made for the cost of freight and insurance
wherever the rebate is equal to the prime value of the piece
goods reckoned in the currency of the country of origin
together with all the charges of carriage from place to place
f.o.b. and c.o.d., no account being taken of the incidental
effects (this is important) of climate and the habits of the
importers? I think I have stated Mr. Welbore's question
fairly, though for the sake of convenience I have summarised
it. The answer is easier than Mr. Welbore seems to imagine.
Since piece goods, according to his own admission, are a
variable quantity, freight and insurance must necessarily
rise to the level of the demand for wheat (in quantity, not in
value) and the resultant is the mean expenditure multiplied
pp. 15, 16 and 17, and the note on p. 26). It is clear, there-
fore, that a duty of two shillings can only decrease the cost
to the consumer; and the same is true of all sums up to
twenty-eight shillings. At that point another factor comes
into play, and we have to consider how the miller is likely
to be affected by the rise in the price of offal.
I have now shown that Mr. Welbore's conundrum, which
was intended to demolish Tariff Reform, is in reality one of
, the most convincing arguments in favour of that great con-
structive policy. Yours, etc., ALBERT E. Bolus.
II. -
SIR,-Mr. Albert E. Bolus, in his haste to support the
tottering fabric of Tariff Reform, has omitted to state or to
answer one of the most essential points in my argument, and
has added to it an assertion which I never made. I said
nothing at all about manufactured goods. My whole
argument depended on the rate of exchange between two
countries of which one uses gold as a medium, while the
other uses either beads or silk handkerchiefs. On the
other hand, I maintained that, ceteris paribus, the available
capital of a country varies in an inverse ratio to its foreign
trade in partially manufactured goods. The price of bread
in a protected country is, therefore, necessarily double the
price in a country which enjoys free imports. Politzky's
well-known inference from the wage-tables of agricultural
labourers has nothing whatever to do with this. Iſ Mr. Bolus
had extended his reading to page 300 of the “Averages” he
would have found the statement that “the fact that wages
tend to disappear under a protective tariff cannot be gain-
said.” Why did Mr. Bolus suppress this important passage?
Finally, let me ask Mr. Bolus to consider the following case.
The population of a town in Bengal wishes to buy an
elephant, but finds that the home article, owing to the
operations of the elephant trust, is too expensive. The
elephant is therefore purchased in Africa at a saving of
10,000 rupees, shipping and food included. What is the
result 2 The inhabitants of Africa are immediately enabled
to buy a Pengal tiger for 5,000 rupees. Thus Bengal gets
its elephant, and can, with the saving of 10,000 rupees, plus
the 5,000 obtained for the tiger, purchase loin-cloths or other
commodities, while Africa possesses the tiger and can give
employment to a considerable number of hunters and trackers
who would otherwise become a charge on the poor-rate. If
Mr. Bolus had his way Bengal would have to purchase her
lose 15 000 rupees, and some 10,000 natives would have to
by the numbers of the population (see Politzky on “Averages,” | .
elephant at home, the manufacturers of loin-cloths would ||
go naked, while Africa would lose her tiger as well as the
purchase-price of the elephant, and would have to see the
gradual starvation of her hunters and trackers owing to
unemployment. Can any sane man doubt which of these
two systems is the better? Yours, etc., John WELBORE.
III.
SIR,-I, have no desire to pursue a correspondence with a
man capable of such statements as appear in Mr. Welbore's
letter to you. I merely want to point out that Politzky's book
contains only 259 pages, and that the statement quoted by
Mr. Welbore from page 300 is therefore as mythical as the
rest of his assertions. Free Trade must indeed be in a bad
way to need the support of such a champion.
Yours, etc., ALFRED E. Bolts.
; IV.
SIR,--Mr. Bolus of course has the Tariff Reform edition of
Politzky. If he will consult the original and only genuine
edition he will find that it has 360 pages and that the state-
ment I quoted duly appears on p. 300. Mr. Bolus must try
again. Yours, etc., John WELBolte.

"The Daily Mail's article on Mr.
REDMOND by his nephew suggests a
departure in personal journalism which
may rapidly develop into something
like this:—
- UNCLE EDWARD.
By William Hohenzollern.
He has been called the uncle of Europe
(Hoch!), but since Europe has no indi-
vidual pen let me, as a nephew, see
what I can do for him. And who could
do it better? To be uncle of Europe is
no small thing, as I can tell, although I
have never tried it. Enough for me
to be its enfant terrible. Well, he is
courteous, my uncle, tactful (Hoch (),
quick, bon garçon, and yet always the
King. I admire him intensely. May
the day be long distant when it is neces-
sary for me to eclipse him
UNQLE DAvid.
º By a Nephew.
Oh, he is charming at home, charming.
You should see him with his golf clubs
—all so jolly. And nothing like so
good at sums as you might think, or so
keen on money. I have often seen him
give coins to beggars; and he has even
tipped me. His language too in private
life is quite refined: you would hardly
know him. And his wit—when we
were all with him the other day about
the scandalous attack on his veracity—he
said, “Oh, never mind: it’s only one of
O’BRIEN's breaches.”
UNCLE TIM.
By a Nephew.
Few men in the political world are at
once better and less known than Mr.
HEALY, the Irish statesman. The im-
pression of the world is that he is a
caustic and witty critic of men and
measures. On the contrary, he is the
mildest and sweetest of creatures. His
witty speeches are written for him (I
may not tell by whom), and he commits
them to memory only with tears and
sobs. It is as though a grasshopper
had to use the sting of a wasp. You
may ask in surprise, Why does he do
this? The answer to which is, You do
not know my Uncle Tim; his passion
for Irish liberty is so great that he would
go to any personal suffering rather than
not serve her—even to being sarcastic.
UNCLE ARTHUR.
By a Nephew.
Few men in the political world are
more successful in concealing their true
identities than Mr. BALFour, or Uncle
ARTY, as I cannot help calling him. For
example, when I was at school, I had
to open a debate in favour of Free
Trade, and, being ignorant of the subject,

“D’You RECoLLEo' old wor's—'Is-NAME?”

DiDN'T ARF GIT IT, I Don't think!”
“’ADN'T You 'EARD THEN ?” “I DID 'E
“REELY : *
AR SoMEFINK, BUT No DETAILs, Not AFoRE Now.”
I wrote to him for advice, with the result fond of bird's-nesting, but it is charac-
that he sent me a speech which enabled
me to secure a handsome majority.
Mr. BALFOUR has been and may again
be PRIME MINISTER, but his real passion
is dancing. To see him at his best you
should see him in the ballroom. He is
the best two-step dancer in Haddington-
shire. Music is another of his accom-
plishments, and he always plays the
organ in church at Whittingehame when
he is at home. As a boy he was very
teristic of his kindness that he will never
touch lobsters because they are caught
alive. He is much addicted to puns and
practical joking, and taught me how to
set a booby-trap before I was ten. He
is a great believer in breakfasting in bed.
UNCLE MICHAEL.

ceeded the late Mr. JAMES LowTHER as

manner of man the new-comer was. Lord
MoRRIs at once replied, “Well, now, every
wan called LowthER ‘Jimmy,' but I'd
like to see the man that 'd vinture to
call Hicks-BEACH “Micky.’”
As a matter of fact, this anecdote only
illustrates the strange barriers that divide
the political from the domestic personali-
ties of our statesmen. Speaking without
the slightest nepotistic bias, I can assure
the readers of The Daily Slop Pail that,
although his relatives do not call him
“Micky,” a vast number of the younger
generation affectionately refer to him as
“Uncle Mick.” And, indeed, he is at
his best with children, teaching them
the fine old game of knucklebones, play-
ing hunt the slipper, or singing nursery
rhymes in a rich fruity baritone, which
often makes the tears glisten in the eyes
of the ladies who are present. He is also
very fond of reciting the fairy tales of
HANS ANDERSEN with appropriate gestures,
and can still throw the boomerang as
well as most Australian aborigines. In
the political arena he sometimes shows a
certain forbidding hauteur, but in private
life he is the sweetest of men. It is this
antinomy that led to the saying that he
combined the manners of a brigand chief
with the nerve of a nursery governess.

understands in these days when poetry does
not pay.”—Mr. George Wyndham.]
O SCORNFUL of shawms and of sackbuts,
O slow as the slug on the lawn,
Flat, flat as the bilge in your back-butts,
Deaf adders whose hearts are as
brawn,
Dull reptiles who cheer not the charmer,
O Public, we cry to you now
To shake off dull sloth and to strap on
your armour , ,
And rise from the slough I
With troubadours dead as a haddock

'And Pegasus penned in his paddock,
And withered the Rose of Romance,
From the lute and the lyre of Apollo
You turn as a bird from the toils,
And shake off the Muses and Minstrels,
to wallow -
In Rubbers and Oils!
O comrades of youth, who could render
In form-rooms that faced the grey
quad
The rolling hexameter's splendour,
In Augment and Aorist shod,
You've quitted, you renegade rotters,
“The Royal high service" of song,
The bays are a burden, the ink-bowls
and blotters
Can go to Hong-Kong!
From the mesh of the Mart that would
choke you, -
Come-back,-for, neglected and glum,
We bards in abeyance invoke you
And crave for a comforting crumb;
Come back to the niche where the Nine
are,
The spacious, the sweet, the succinct,
Ere Phoebus and all of the laurel-linked
line are -
As dodos extinct!

“It is settled for Dillon to ride Lemberg in
the Two Thousand. Dillon was the first jockey
to ride both this colt and his illustrious ha f-

We saw DILLON (or somebody) do some-
thing like this in a circus years ago.
A contemporary refers to the airship
garage at Wormwood Scrubbs as “pro-

out that the garage is also the smallest
of its size. Special pleading of this
kind is valueless.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRoxi rii: DIARy of Tory, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 18.
—As not infrequently happens, realisa-
tion of stirring scenes in House of Com-
mons fell far short of anticipation. It
is the unexpected that holds the secret
of success. To-day popular theatre was
crammed in pit, stalls, boxes, and top-
most galleries. Not since the introduc-
tion of Home Rule Bill in 1903, when
chairs were ranged on floor of House, has
there been such a gathering. Royalty
regarded the moving scene from seat
over the clock. On one side flanked by
muster of Foreign Ministers; on the
other the Peers crowded, the PRIMATE
standing forlorn amid a group of late
comers by the doorway.
Revelations expected. Particulars
looked for of CHANCELLOR OF ExchEQUER's
midnight assignations with rebellious
Irish Members who demanded a price
for sale of the dearest interests of the
Empire. Didn't care much about the
internecine quarrel between O'BRIEN and
REDMOND aimé. But if FLUELLEN LLoyd
GEORGE could be caught out, or shown
up, or what you will that would
damage his personal reputation, and
possibly confound the Government in
a common ruin, here, truly, would be
nuts.
O'BRIEN spoiled superly opportunity.
At outset sympathy of House decidedly
with him. As far as Opposition was con-
cerned he was as enthusiastically cheered
as if he had torn down the Home Rule
flag, declared himself a Unionist, and
handed TIM HEALY over to Castle autho-
rities with intent that he should be in-
prisoned in cell beneath its deepest
moat. Had he been satisfied with half-
an-hour's speech, he would have re-
tained, as at first he commanded, atten-
tion. Temptation proved overwhelming.
Never since he entered House had he
had such an audience. Why should he
let them of 2
At end of first three-quarters of an
hour, smiting with right hand his
left palm as if it contained the head of
John REDMOND, he remarked, “And now
to sum up.” Then he went on for what
seemed another half-hour, though it
º have been less by Westminster
cºo k.
Throughout he was in the manner of
Mrs. SiddoNs. At times he hissed accu-
sation in blood-curdling whisper. Anon
he thundered denunciation at top of
strident voice. Ostensibly he was there
to say, “You’re another!” to ChancELLOR
of ExchEQUER who accused him of gross
untruth and disgraceful breach of con-
fidence. As he proceeded with his
task the head of John REDMOND ever
thrust itself under his arm; finding it
there, he stopped to punch it. His ear
“Jhere.Moi AH.”
(Mr. MacVeagh, the humorist of the Irish
Party.)
was alert to whisper or movement of
compatriots on benches behind. At
slightest interruption he faced about
and slew one or other with fierce stare.
Poor Swift MACNEILL, in lightness of
heart at finding himself back in old
familiar scene, once gurgled with laugh-
ter. Turning swiftly upon him, Siddons
O'BRIEN announced in tragic tones that
he was “not to be disconcerted by apish
interruptions.”
The , whole affair more mearly
approached three - cornered duel of

and bred a Nationalist.”

MARRYAT's fancy than anything ever seen
at Westminster. Difference was that,
whereas his three controversialists,
placed on triangular lines, blazcq away
at each other's backs, O'BRIEN, having
had first shot at FLUELLEN and REDMOND
aimé, they in turn riddled him.
Best performance in the serio comedy
was TIM HEALY's. REDMOND aimé smiled
contemptuously at O BRIEN's hate-em-
bittered references to himself. The thing
was overdone, the animus too obvious.
Different in case of TIM. He played
with his victim as cat with meuse,
rolling him over with swift stroke of paw,
setting him up again for further frolic.
All done so easily, with almost fiendish
good humour. His patronage of the
PREMIER, who had “sized up the Member
for Waterford at his proper worth and
measure and found him a man without
an ounce of political backbone,” was so
unaffectedly hearty that to suggest male-
volence were hypercriticism. But, as the
charmed audience felt, there underlay
the banter the cruellest form of malice
in the assumption that the object of attack
was not worth making a fuss about. For
the rival aspirant to the Leadership of
Irish Nationalists this more scorching
than the brimstone flames, more hurtful
than the thunderclaps, of O'BRIEN's
tempestuous oratory.
Business done. — Time allocated for
dealing with Budget.
Tuesday.—Talk about Empire Day,
this is Captain CRAIG's day. Member
for East Down has for ever destroyed
illusion obscuring his Parliamentary
position. Understood his gifts of speech
did not go beyond capacity for inter-
rupting with pointed remark orations
in process of delivery by one of his
fluent countrymen below Gangway. In
this art he finds a generous rival in
Mr. MooRE, the twin Orangeman who ||
represents another division of Ulster.
To-night MooRE illustrated its efficacy
by getting in a nasty one about Pigott.
That renowned person, who in his day
drew from GRANDOLPH a well-known
passionate adjuration, has cropped up
again in connection with the literary
excursions of the gentleman whom
TRUCULENT TIM was yesterday, without
rebuke from the Chair, permitted to
allude to as “that ass Anderson.”
Attempt being made in Redmondite camp
to exploit the blundering forger, MooRE
quietly asked whether Pigott was not
born and bred a Nationalist, and was
he not long time in pay of the Party?
Shot went home; subject dropped
like a hot potato.
CRAIG's flight was loftier, longer sus-
tained. He not only made a speech.
He brought in a Bill, and would have
carried it over its first reading only
for a hostile majority of 92. Wants to
create new anniversary to be known as

Empire Day. As far as could be made “can be applied to any purpose the
out does not aspire to share Lord
AVEBURY's place in history by adding
to the number of Bank Holidays. All
he desires is that, as the years revolve,
on the 24th of May the British flag
shall be run up at the offices of all
Departments of State and on every
National School. In a glowing passage
he told how if this were done
“foreigners chancing to visit these
shores would see that we had the greatest
Empire in the world,” whilst the youth
of the country “would be taught the
true meaning of the flag and what was
the meaning of Empire Day.”
DiLKE, unmoved by this patriotic
sentiment, took matter-of-ſact view of
situation, pointing out that adoption of
the measure would stir up hostile feel-
ing in Canada, South Africa and India.
On a division first reading was refused.
But that a fate common to other great
measures eventually added to Statute
Book.
Business done.—Old friend the Budget
back again. Though lost to sight it
has for four months been to memory
dear. Its unprecedented history fully
maintained in this last chapter. Turns
out to be the marvel of the age. Have
daily, weekly, morning and evening,
read how the country was on the verge
of bankruptcy. . Disaster postponed by
hand-to-mouth policy of borrowing.
Turns out there has been some loss to
national purse consequent on rejection
of Budget by Lords. But it does not
exceed £1,300,000, a mere fleabite to a
country irretrievably gone to the dogs.
When all is squared up, instead of a
deficit there will be a surplus closely
approaching £3,000,000. Which, as
CHANCELLOR OF ExCHEQUER cheerily says,
House of Commons may direct.”
Thursday. — The Harp that once

discord raised suddenly broke out again

that commanded attention of crowded
House, moved to reduce amount by
sum representing pension of ex-Civil
servant who, having contributed article
to monthly magazine, woke in the
morning to find himself more than
famous. Debate carried on by series of
speeches of considerable length contri-
buted by Home SEC.ETARY, LEADER of
OPPosition, and PREMIER. Though not
lacking in liveliness, House for long time
kept clear of unruliness. Just before
ten o'clock Members, having dined, re-
turned, thronging benches in anticipa-
tion of division.
Ex-ATToRNEY-GENERAL FOR IRELAND pre-
sented himself at Table.
In appearance and forensic manner of
speech, Mr. CAMPBELL does not notably
differ from Mr. URE. This makes it
more amazing, as SARK says, how these
Law Officers succeed in covering the
Parliamentary green with dishevelled
wigs. At this hour, making the sixth
of interminable talk round the subject,
Members on both sides inclined to resent
interposition of a somewhat dull ex-Law
Officer. For five minutes CAMPBELL
sustained his alleged character. Sud-
denly, without inflection of voice or
approach to gesture, he turned an almost
somnolent audience into tumultuous mob.
Allusion to PARNELL in connection
with Phoenix Park murders flung the
fat into the fire. In Committee Room
No. 15, subsequently elsewhere, the dis-
crowned King of Ireland suffered much
contumely at the hands of former col-
leagues, upon whom he retorted by:
genially describing them as “gutter-
snipes.” But, if colleagues and com-
patriots may fling mud on their former
idol, they will not permit one whom they
call a Castle hack to take a hand in the
game." Angrily insisted upon CAMPPELL
withdrawing what they denounced as
insulting remark. . . . . . . . .
Ex-ATToRNEY-GENERAL FOR IRELAND, like
LoRD Advocate oF Scotland, stubbornly

MR. A. Kipling CoMMON has written
an eloquent letter to The Evening

Sir HENRY Howorth has written a pro-

a special Supplement of eight pages, for
the anniversary of the date of his first
letter in that journal just fifty years
ago. In it he pays a very generous and
gracefully worded tribute to Cobden,
PEEL, and BRIGHT. “That these politi-
cians were misguided, mischievous and
unpatriotic,” he writes, “cannot be
denied. The damage that they inflicted
on the prestige and prosperity of the
British Empire is of mammoth dimen-
sions, and will not be obliterated in
this or even the next century. But
this much must be at least set down to
their credit. Had they not inspired me
in my generous youth to combat their
poisonous heresies, I doubt whether I
should ever have entered on that long
and arduous series of letters, none of
them less than one and a half columns
in length, which, if paid for only at the

door, whereat his brightness becomes
almost vulgar. It becomes quite vulgar
when he fancies he hears his own name
mentioned in a colloquy without. “If,”
says Algernon, “a brief gets as far as
this room and is not for me, I shall die.”
Constantine, when he really overhears his
own name being bandied about outside,
allows his joy to get the better of him,
and he says, “If the brief is for me I
will stand you a dinner.” It is there-
upon agreed that on the first brief
coming into that room the lucky re-

cost ten per cent of the fee. Algernon
makes the only clever legal move of his
life, and gets that down in writing.
Amidst a tense silence Constantine is
hailed outside, while Algernon affixes a

into the hand of Constantine. The
latter endeavours abortively to combine
a boast about his success with a denial
of liability for dinners; but Algernon,
having spoken a few gracious words of
formal congratulation, insists politely
but firmly on seeing the fee. This the
Author, no less generous than his own
solicitor, has put at two hundred guineas;
and Algernon, in a thrilling and dra-

and demands a dinner to cost twenty
guineas. Constantine produces a series
of arguments, contra, from which one
gathers that he will have to improve

Algernon, with the object of accustom-

as there are on an average five barristers

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL (the other one) is a magician.
Just as it was said of GARRICK that he “could act a gridiron,”
so Mr. CHURCHILL can write about an American Society-
woman and make one sympath se. Honora, the heroine of
: A Modern Chronicle (MACMILLAN), is what would be called a
Fascinator. Beginning in St. Louis, where she is the adored
of an uncle and an aunt, several callow youths, and inci-
dentally an ex-office-boy, Peter Erwin, she marries Howard
Spence, a young stockbroker from the East (U.S.A.). Thence-
forward a large section of the book is a record of her pro-
gress, financial and social, towards Fifth Avenue. It is told
in such careful detail as to leave one with the impression of
having known New York Society intimately at first hand—
and with no desire whatever to renew the experience. Then,
that the chronicle might be truthfully modern, there comes
along Hugh Chiltern, the strong, passionate lover; and
Honora, weary of her uninteresting husband, obtains a
money-down divorce, and marries Hugh. What follows, the
story of her failure to build up a secure and honourable
home upon such foundations, is not only the best part of the
book, but, I incline to think, the strongest thing Mr.
CHURCHILL has yet done. The tragedy of such defeat is
intensely realised. Mercifully, Hugh's sudden death cuts
short the lingering punishment of their joint degradation,
and Honora, changed and chastened, escapes to Paris, where,
IMPENDING.
-
five years later, Peter Erwin, now famous, but with his old
devotion unaltered, takes her in his arms. Peters, in the
novels, always end that way. Yet I found the finish the least
convincing part of an unusually clever book.
If you are a crusty old bachelor, own a mile of house-
property in a provincial town, collect your own rents, and
live on next to nothing in a tiny cottage, you will save
roughly about £5,000 a year. But if your charming step-
great-niece, hitherto estranged from your avuncular bosom
by a family feud, suddenly alights in the midst of your
solitude, cooks you a ravishing kidney omelette on the spot,
and throws up her position as a Board School teacher to
come and housekeep for you, then you will begin to find
out what the world looks like when it is upside down.
At any rate that was what old Mr. Ollerenshaw discovered
when Helen With the High Hand (CHAPMAN AND HALL) came
down on him like a Lloyd GEORGE on the publicans and
dukes, dipped her pretty fingers into his cash-box and
gently but firmly began to drag the old hermit-crab out of
his shell. The friendly duel between the shrewd old man
and his high-handed young relative is described by Mr.
ARNOLD BENNErt with delightful and subtle humour, and his
book is the most diverting I have come across for many
a long day. Parry and thrust follow each other with
lightning rapidity, till in the final bout the once miserly
old man, after he has been cajoled into buying the big
show place of the district, responds by quietly marrying
its wealthiest widow. Uncle and niece are both lovable

with a firm hand; and I, for my part, have found Mr.
BENNETT's story a most agreeable relaxation from the tedium
and annoyances of a too political world.
A rather ragged game of Rugby football played on a wet
ground and seen through a fog is the nearest simile I can
find for the raging activity of Mr. H. C. BAILEY's Storm and
Treasure (METHUEN). People (and especially the hero) are
constantly being seized from behind, flung to the ground,
pinioned, trussed, and dragged through the grass or under-
growth to some dark place of captivity, to be hauled up to
the light again with the regularity of a tube-lift, just when
all hope seemed at an end. The Vicomte de Jan, a French
&migré, is persuaded to return to his château of Tiffauges, in
La Vendée (that is where the ingots are hid), in order to
assist the fortunes of “the Grand Army" against the
| Republic. Here is one of the Wicomte's exploits: “But

Don Estebán, a Spanish aristocrat, took to wife Magdalen

riage three sons, Guillen, Pepé and Frazco. On the death
of the father and the second marriage of the mother, the

of it; they are more brilliant than ever, even when lying
helpless, and covered with dirt in a cave or imprisoned at

to which the reader looked forward, tails off into a hasty
digression, misconceived and inaccurate on the face of it.
Finally and quite unaccountably he becomes the greatest

H. B. DevEY had a letter in The Times announcing the attitude which
he proposes to take up in the matter of aviatory trespass. Fliers who
descend upon his trees and shrubs will be sued for damage, and those
who attempt to come through his roof will be received on spikes and
prongs attached to the chimneys.

“The Leader of the Opposition played the part of Clytemnestra in
the tragedy which is now unfolding itself. IIe prophesied nought but
evil.”—Daily Chronicle.
We had heard of Cassandra as a prophetess, but had
never had our attention called to Clytemnestra's achieve-
ments in this line. Certainly she hinted at the murder of her
husband, but then she knew she was going to do it herself.

He. We're in very good time. Let's get out here. He'll
be an hour getting to the entrance.
She. Right. It's only a few yards.
[They get out of the taxi and walk on.
He. Hurry up. It's crammed already.
She. Just a moment. My hat—
He. Oh, it's always your hat. (To a young man) Bride-
groom's side. (To her) Let 's go in there. (To various
people). So sorry. I beg your pardon. (To her) There we
are. Lucky to get such good seats.
She. There's Mrs. Holbeach. Fancy her coming all that
way. Oh, and there's Mary Tressider. (Nols and smiles.)
I didn't know she knew them—but she never misses any-
thing of the sort. Who's that dark-haired man? No, not
that one. The handsome one. -
He. Captain Oakley, Gerald's uncle.
She. Gerald's uncle, is he? He doesn't look like an uncle,
somehow. -
He. What do you expect uncles to look like?
She. Oh, I don't know. Whiskers and turn-down collar
and a malacca cane with an ivory handle—something of that
sort. -
He. I'm a bit of an uncle myself, you know.
She. So you are. How funny.
|She turns round, recognises a lady behind her and begins
whispering to her.
He. It's no good your trying to whisper. You can't get
within a yard of one another. Tell her she'd much better
whisper to me. She could get quite close to me.
She. Don't be silly. She told me the bride's dress was three
inches off the ground and only a yard and a quarter round
(Stir and animation. A burst of music.) She's come. . . . How
well she looked—a little pale and nervous, but that's natural.
He. Ripping pretty lot of girls. Nice idea that, to send
'em along without hats.

A Voice in the distance. . . . let him speak now or for

He. Wouldn't it be awful if somebody didn't hold his
peace and just chipped in 2

He. What, the vestry? Much like any other vestry, 1

She. They're coming now. Here they are. Ah! -
He. Did you see them?
She. Not much. Did you ?
IIe. Just the tip of Gerald's nose. Very handsome and
manly I thought it. Let's make a move.
[They squeeze out slowly, and proceed in a taxi to
another place.
She. What a crush ! Is my hat——
He. Yes, it's as big as ever.
She (to a lady). I congratulate you so much.

you. Just a little piece. (To him) Charles, you must have
a piece of the cake.

HE AND SHE.
Where gloom of laurels flanked the dusky glade
And no rough sound the summer silence jarred,
I saw the wanton where she pierced the shade
With amorous regard.
Bold, brilliant eyes played their familiar part,
But I refused to flinch or turn aside,
And, with a cold pang at my angry heart,
Her insolence defied.
I knew so well for whom she lingered there,
To charm him while he listened—and she lied,
Seeking with soft appeal or brazen air
To move his manly pride;
Discreetly veiling other lawless loves
In artful talk and little tender cries—
Her voice the murmur of the cooing dove,
Her eyes the serpent's eyes.
Awhile we gazed, hate answering back to hate;
Then suddenly my wrath took fire and flared;
Her baffled glances proved she knew her fate—
I'd kill her if I dared.
With that the dusk cut off her half-told tale;
I lost the blurred line, tawny gold and white;
It vanished with a long-drawn sibilant wail
Into the summer night.
Swift as a dream she melted into space,
An elemental passion veiled in fur,
A thing of evil, but of wondrous grace,
Soft as a velvet purr;
A homeless stranger, careless of her fame,
Unpedigreed, unfaithful, most untrue;
And he, the owner of a royal name,
My Champion Persian Blue.
“WANTED, new pair of football boots, for a good young Fox-terrier

On second thoughts we will have the good young cricket

by the bears, covering an area of sixty square feet.”—Daily Graphic.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND.
HE came down to breakfast one
morning to find two letters on his plate.
The handwriting on the envelopes being
strange to him and the postmarks re-
vealing nothing, he decided, after some
minutes' thought, to see if there were
any clues to be found inside. Accord-
ingly he picked up the first letter and
opened it. It was written from the
highly aristocratic address of 99a,
Curzon Street, Mayfair, W., which
fact was naturally a source of some
pleasure to him. He was still more
gratified and intrigued to discover
that the writer was no less a person
than Reginald St. John Berkeley. The
actual letter, however, was something of
a disappointment.
99a, Curzon St., Mayfair, W.
DEAR SIR,--I write to inform you that
I am prepared to advance upon your
note of hand alone, without any security
whatever, sums ranging from £10 to
£10,000. Hoping to hear from you
shortly, Yours faithfully,
REGINALD St. John BERKELEY.
He put the letter on one side and
poured himself out a cup of tea. Then
he opened the other envelope. This
proved to contain a communication
from (Mrs.) Matilda Ascot. A little
surprised at hearing from her, for he
had never been introduced, he pro-
ceeded to make himself acquainted
with the contents of her letter. She
wrote, he was distressed to find, from
an unfashionable address in Notting
III'l.
23, Spa Road, Nolling Hill, W.
DEAR SIR,-You will be surprised at
hearing from me, but I can mo longer
keep silent. This is the third day
that the children have been without
boots; their father is again out of
work, and I am alone in the world.
You will be interested to hear that
I have been trying to get a little
money together with which to start a
small stationer's shop, and if I can do this
I can make a living and keep my four
children and my husband in comfort.
Will you not help me? Lord —,
Colonel John —, C.B., and the
Rev. William —— have already sub-
scribed small sums, and if I can only
get five pounds more I shall be able to
buy the shop and start earning an
honest living for myself and my
dear ones. I have appealed to you
because I feel sure you have a generous
heart, and because I think you would
like to be associated with Colonel John
—, C.B., Lord and the Reverend
William in this work of true
charity. Will you kindly forward this
small (and necessary) sum of five
pounds by return so that I can buy the
shop and begin work at once 2 Thank-
ing you for past assistance, -
Yours very gratefully,
(Mrs.) MATILDA Ascot.
“Dear, dear,” he said. He put
both letters carefully away, and took up
his morning paper.
A week later he came down to
breakfast and found two letters on his
plate. He recognised the writing at
once. After a little hesitation he de-
cided to read Reginald St. John Berke-
ley's mote first.
99a, Curzon Street, Mayfair, W.
DEAR SIR,--I must confess that I have
been somewhat surprised at not hearing
from you, in answer to my communica-
tion offering to advance you sums ranging
from £10 to £10,000 upon your note of
hand alone, without any further security
whatever.
Can it be that you are not in any want
of money? The expenses incidental to
the opening of the season are numerous,
and it frequently happens that gentlemen
of your position are in temporary need
of assistance. It is not always possible
to sell out stock at a moment's notice,
nor is it always quite convenient to
borrow from one's friends. It is on
such occasions that most gentlemen are
glad to seek my aid, and it would sur-
prise you if you were to look at my books
to see how many of the nobility and
gentry are willing to accept money from
me. There are men in the very highest
position in lºngland among my clients,
and I am prepared to treat you with just
the same consideration.
Now, cannot I send you a trifle 2
You want a new motor-car, you desire
to go in for aeroplaning, your wife
wishes to spend a week in Paris–well,
why hesita'e? You can return the
money when you like (with, of course,
such small interest as will repay the
incidental expenses of the negotiation),
and you will have the satislaction of
knowing that you have not (perhaps)
missed the opportunity of a lifetime
through a temporary shortage of ready
capital.
Now let me hear from you at once on
this subject. You will, of course, under-
stand that I cannot undertake to advance
you a larger sum than £10,000 upon
your mere note of hand. Should you
therefore require more than this it will
be necess ury for me, in order to protect
myself, to receive some security.
I enclose a stamped envelope, ad-
dressed to myself, so that you can
inform me at once of the amount you
require, and remain
Yours faithfully,
REGINALD ST. John BERRELEY.
“Well, well,” he said, “this is very
sad.” He wiped away a tear and turned
to (Mrs.) Matilda Ascot.
23, Spa Road, Notting Hill, W.
DEAR SHR,-You have wounded me
deeply by your silence—how deeply I
trust you will never know. In my
bitterness I said to myself, “Never again
will I show my confidence in him by
giving him the opportunity of being
associated with such noble Christians
and true gentlemen as Lord , Colonel
John , C.B., and the Reverend
William in a work of real charity.”
But afterwards I relented; I told myself
that possibly you had been ill or away
upon a holiday; and I decided to give
you one more chance.
I am about to start a small registry
business on which to support my dear
little children (5), who are quite alone
in the world, their poor father being
unfortunately no more. General Sir
Rupert —, K.C.B., is interesting
himself in the matter, and many other
gentlemen of position are helping me,
among them the Bishop of ;
while Lord ——, Colonel John --,
C.B., and the Reverend William
have again shown a true Christian spirit
in contributing. I only require ten
pounds more, and this sum I have
decided to let you subscribe. You will
want to send the money at once, and I
am therefore enclosing a stamped
addressed envelope, so that you may not
be vexed by any unnecessary delay.
Trusting to hear from you to-morrow,
and thanking you for past assistance,
Yours very gratefully,
(Mrs.) MATILDA ASCOT.
He gave a deep sigh.
“What a lot of unhappiness there is
in the world,” he reflected. “I don't
seem to be doing any good at all; I
don't help anybody. They all write to
me and tell me their troubles—why
don't I do something?”
He thought for a moment, and then
a noble idea occurred to him. He took
Mrs. Ascot's letter and put it in Mr.
Berkeley's stamped addressed enve-
lope; and he tºok Mr. Berkeley's letter
and put it in Mrs. Ascot's stan ped
addressed envelope. As le poured
himself out a cup of tea he looked
fatuously pleased with himself.
“They ought to have been introduced
to each other a long time ago,” he said.

POTTED PAPERS.
I. The New Age.
NoTEs of THE WEEK.
The Government continues its disas-
trous career towards the rocks, every
day bringing it nearer to destruction.
As we have always foreseen and said,
the Cabinet is at sixes and sevens and
only by Herculean efforts can the PREMIER
hold his team in check. Never did a
stern brow mask so absolutely woolly
a personality as that of Mr. Asquith.
There is one way, and only one, to-
wards the salvation of England. It is
the democratic way. Demos carries the
light and it must be followed. The
Lords may survive the present storm,
but another and another will follow,
and ultimately they will be whelmed.
The creation of five hundred peers will
hardly postpone their annihilation a
moment. Who will they be? Ask
yourselves. And how long will they
remain Liberal? Ask yourselves that
too.
Books AND PERSONS.

I have been reading Hopeless Idiocy,
by Schnetchkernoff, in the translation
just issued by the only publisher in
England who has any brains. You who
read this volume have, of course, never
heard of Schnetchkernoff, but let me
tell you that you will. For he is a
coming man; he is one of the men that
count. I discerned this the moment I
had smelt the cover of the book, and
five minutes after I had opened it I was
gasping with the ecstasy that one artist
feels for another. On my recent visit to
England I made every effort to meet the
translator of the novel, but he was never
at home. But I shall be in Moscow next
week, and shall then sip my vodka with
the novelist himself, and tell him a few
facts about this England of ours.

Looking in recently on Milan, I was
delighted to find the industrious and
not despicable young Italian who trans-
lated my novel into his language, which
I understand perfectly but have not time
to write in. I asked him what Italy did
before he began his labours, but he was
unable to tell me. “Corpo di Bacco'''
he said, and shrugged. But I under-
st od. Still, all that is now changed.
I then told him a few startling things
about Italy which he had not dreamed
of, and showed him how very like geese
were most of the swans which his
countrymen admired.

By the way, there is in England at
this moment only one man who can
write decent journalism, and that is
the leader writer on The Bournemouth

ART.
Let me resume my indictment of the
obscure lumber-room in Trafalgar Square
called the National Gallery. Last week
I demolished the claims of VELASQUEz,
TITIAN, RAPHAEL and LEONARDO. I wish
now to drºw your attention to that in-
credible example of bad drawing and
vulgarcolouring called ANDREA DELSARIO's
portrait of himself. How could such a
feeble thing be admitted into any collec-
tion, one asks. But there are no limits
to the incapacity of the trustees of this
institution.
[And so on.]
Why Not SURRENDER to Russia?
By W. R. Titlerton.
Last week I proved that, as we had
already virtually surrendered to Ger-
many long ago, it was only by a formal
surrender that we could get a quid pro
quo for our humility. But England's
need is not only one but several fresh
conquests. Accordingly I plead this
week for another conquest—this time
by Russia. Here again we should only
be regularising the fait accompli, for we
have already surrendered to Russian
ideas. TschAikowsky has conquered us;
ToLSTOI has conquered us; all right-
minded people are the slaves of caviare
(a Russian product), and Jacob Tons ºn
is passionately addicted to vodka. The
Russians have the deepest bass voices
in the world. ANNA PAvlova is the finist
dancer in the solar system, and I have
recently mastered the balalaika. Quid

A lesson I have to impart
On one of your principal duties,
The noble equestrian art.
The horse, you may know, is a creature
Which prudence would bid you avoid;
He bites with his principal feature,
And kicks when he's feeling annoyed.
But here, by our latest invention,
We free you from any alarm;
Approach him without apprehension ;
Nay, pat him; he cannot do harm.
Henceforth you need never be wary
Of handling the beast as you like ;

Which comes, in particular places,
Uncommonly hard on the “buff; ”
His temper is highly capricious;
He bucks and he jibs and he rears,
And likes, when he's playful or vicious,
To hurtle you over his ears.
But mark, what a lasting improvement! :
This excellent Pattern you'll find
A thing of luxurious movement
And woodenly docile in mind;
You sit with a foot in each stirrup;
You needn't hang on by his head ;
The motion 's as soothing as syrup
And grateful as cocoa or bed.
Then rock you, my gentle recruities,
And try (if you can) to enjoy
The simple and dignified beauties
Of soldiering learnt on a toy.
Come rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye! Faster!
Come upsey-down, upsey-lown So!
Ride on without fear of disaster
Come, rock-a-bye!—Lord,what a show!

to strive for; a healthy appetite a sign
of a healthy mind; poor or undiscrimi-
nating eaters the enemies of Society;
teetotalers and vegetarians the worst
pariahs; restaurants and the civic ideal;
the educational value of talking to
waiters; the importance to waiters and
other employés of having conversation
for guests; the way for hotel managers

DEAR ladies, the season approaches

AEROPLANES v. GOLF
WRITING to The Field Mr. U.P. JENRINS (can he, by chance,
be the originator of the celebrated game of “Up, Jenkins”?)
voices his dread of low-flying aviators, who, he says, would
obstruct his tee shots, and claims that he is entitled to a
sufficient amount of air, if paying a subscription of fifteen
guineas to his golf club. This is very sad, but we are afraid
there is no help for it, now that England has gone aviation-
mad. The mere fifteen-guinea golfer had better resign himself
to being bunkered by coveys of bird-men, swooping over the
sandhills after mammoth prizes and pursued by droves of
motor cars conveying sporting journalists. -
By judiciously topping his ball the asphyxiated enthusiast
may yet be able to creep from hole to hole beneath the stream
of aeroplanes playing the low-down game foreseen by Mr.
JENKINs—or, if he does not mind his fees being considerably
enhanced, he may still breathe his quantum of air on a course
fenced and roofed in with close-meshed wire in the manner
of a chicken-run. The royal and ancient game would then,
of course, be better played with croquet mallets, and suffi-
cient variety could be obtained if a few new shapes were ||
introduced, such as a knobkerrie, a bandy-stick, or a pavior's
beetle. If aviators persist in their vulgar habit of ricochet-
ting from tee to tee, there will be little left for the plane-
flapped golfer but to follow the mole and pursue his game
in a network of tubes underground. Still, he might always
play from aeroplanes and defeat the air-hogs in their own
element. So cheer U. P. JENKINS 1. Zigzag.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 25.
-—The Admirals are out on a fresh
cruise. Having seen that the Navy is
as well provided as is possible under an
incapable, corrupt Administration which,
when it is not truckling to Germany, is
on its knees to John REDMOND, they have
turned their attention to the number of
guests entertained on board the Ad-
miralty yacht, with particular enquiry
as to who pays for their grub.
Off and on have for some time been
firing in this direction with object of
finding the range. To-day concentrate
attack. Owing to misunderstanding
WICE-ADMIRAL BURGoyNE is left to conduct
it single-handed. His consort, REAR-
ADMIRAL MIDDLEMORE, like the Spanish
Fleet on historic occasion, “is not yet in
sight.” Too literally construes his title.
“All very well to be a Rear-Admiral,”
says the WICE-ADMIRAL snappishly, sling-
ing his telescope round to wrong eye
and surveying offing in Palace Yard;
“but on a day like this he need not
keep so far in that direction as to be
below the horizon.”
Fact is, MIDDLEMORE is down at his
ONE of THE GREAT UNCHASTENED.
(Mr. Will Thorne)
There is a growing tendency among those
who worship at the shrine of “Labour’ to
resent any application of the rod or birch to
any of those tractable little scions of the Pro-
letaliat who are turned out, with such engaging
manners and so much self-control, by the
Elementary Schools of the country. Is it not
conceivable that a practice which is borne with
sturdy submission by Public School boys and
others might in some cases work well ? Is
there not a risk, for instance, that in sparing
the rod you may spoil the Member of Parlia-
ment?
*

marine residence (Arethusa Lodge, Top-
sail Lane, Stourbridge), rigging up a
flagstaff in the back-yard. In addition
to a vane designed to show Stourbridge
which way the wind is blowing, he will
have a Union Jack run up on Empire
Day with intent, as CRAIG put it the
other day, that “foreigners chancing to
visit these shores will see that we have
the greatest Empire in the world.” The
REAR-ADMIRAL rather thinks that, with
this flagstaff and a few big stones lime-
washed in coastguard fashion, Arethusa
Lodge, though situated in the Midlands,
will have about it a decidedly naval look.
Odd how these two authorities on the
policy and minutiae of naval matters
have developed from what on the face
of it seemed unlikely sources. Out-
side Parliamentary arena WICE-ADMIRAL
BURGoyNE is something in the wine
business. REAR-ADMIRAL MIDDLEMORE,
entering life with intention to follow
the medical profession, drifted into a
solicitor's office and rose to the high
estate of a Birmingham City Councillor.
Yet—and the lesson should not be lost
upon new Members—by patience and
perseverance in the Question hour, they
have come to number themselves among
our most authoritative naval experts,
each ready at an hour's motice to take
command of Channel Fleet. No secret
that when JACK FISHER, recalling memo-
ries of TEMPLE at Sheen, retired to his
country seat to cultivate his roses, there
was some disappointment in family
circles that neither of the Admirals was
“sent for ” to take his place. Due
entirely to political animosity; PREMIER
ever ready to sacrifice best interests of
country on altar of Party.
Didn't make much out of this new
cruise. House inclined to regard en-
quiry as petty, not to say impertinent.
But the WICE-ADMIRAL will haul about
and attack again when his consort comes
in sight.
SARK says the best thing for FIRST
LoRD to do would be to ask the Admirals
down to Sheerness and give them a
cruise in the Admiralty yacht. He
ſancies that, should the sea be a little
choppy, the table expenses of the guests
would not be excessive.
Business done.—Budget read a second
time by majority of eighty-six.
Tuesday.—The licence of the Question
hour, with its irrelevancies, its self-ad-
vertisements, its personal animosities,
and its Party controversies, strikingly
illustrated in a query in to-day's long
list standing in name of WILLIAM THoRNE.
That explosive gentleman, who, like Mr.
BELLow (South Salford), always goes off
at half-cock when rising to address the
Chair, desires “To ask the President of
the Board of Trade, whether any inquiry
has been held into the disappearance at
sea, on 2nd October, 1909, of an Asiatic
fireman named Lai Yu, whilst serving
on the steamer Bellerophon, of Liver-
pool; whether he was on duty at the
time; whether he was medically ex-
amined before joining; how long he
had served on the vessel; whether he
had had any previous sea service.”
“The answer to the last part of the

question ” (to quote a familiar Treasury
Bench formula) “is in the negative.”
SYDNEY Buxton, shrewd middle-aged
young man, is rarely at sea. Why
Thoſtne supposes that PRESIDENT OF THE
BoARD of TRADE might have been on
duty at moment of disappearance at
sea of an Asiatic fireman; that he
was medically examined before joining;
and that he served some time on the
vessel, are among the things no fellow
can understand. They are at least con-
sonant in coherence and genuine desire
for information with nine-tenths of the
supplementary questions put at an
average sitting.
Business done. — Budget Bill went
through Committee and reported with-
out division.
Wednesday.—To-night, amid shout of
triumph from embattled Ministerial host,
Budget Bill read a third time. Final
scene up to mark of historic occasion.
Ordained that at eight o'clock the blade
of guillotine should fall, debate be cut off,
and division taken on amendment moved
from Front Opposition Bench for re-
jection of measure. Long before hour
approached, benches on both sides
thronged. - - -
SIDDONS O BRIEN's rising to fling last
curse at Bill and, incidentally, to run
amok among “the mass of conspirators
in the background responsible for the
unconditional surrender of the rights of
Ireland,” led to dramatic incident that
profoundly stirred crowded House.
Hitherto the Leader of Nationalist Party
has been the chief, almost exclusive, ex-
ponent of its views. Tollowing O'BRIEN
to-night came DEVLIN, who replied in
speech of equal fire and fury added to
considerably more point. It disclosed
the priceless possession by the Red-
mondites of a second TIM HEALY. Whilst
lacking the sardonic humour which
flickers through TRUCULENT TIM's ob-
servations, DEVLIN has all his fighting
power. The Leader of the Nationalist
team will do well to give this young colt
his head. -
PREMIER, who met with enthusiastic
reception from his followers, summed up
facts of situation with the pellucid
phrasing, the pitiless logic, that are at
his command. Then came division
which in House of five hundred and
fifty-five Members negatived hostile
amendment by majority of ninety-three.
Bill thereupon read a third time without
division.
Business done.—Budget Bill carried
across corridor to Lords. No one there
to receive resuscitated infant. Couldn't
very well leave it on doorstep. Standing
Orders moderately require quorum of
three for transaction of business. After
five minutes' active search quorum
roped in, and Bill solemnly read a first
time.
Thursday.—To young persons about
to enter upon Parliamentary career,
Wiscount CASTLEREAGH serves as awful
example. Young, rich, heir to a marqui-
sate, squire to one of the most charming
of English dames, he has sunk into a
condition of despondency that positively
blights the benches in his immediate
neighbourhood. Only four years have
sped since he was returned Member for
Maidstone. Sufficed to bring about this
transmogrification.
Accidental position occupied vis-à-vis
Treasury Bench has something to do with
it. Is ever in full view of LLoyd GEORGE,
WINSTON, and other Members of a Ministry
“The IMPORTANCE of BEING EARNEST.”
“Suffusing with greyness what should be a
youthful countenance, bowing his shoulders
with gruesome grief.”
(Lord Castlereagh.)
for which, in respect of lack of all the
virtues, the ages provide no parallel.
Cheered the other day by hearing WINTER-
ToN genially describe Government as “a
man-eating tiger that has tasted blood.”
Elation only temporary.
A sort of withering influence emanat-
ing from Treasury Bench subtly possesses
him, suffusing with greyness what should
be a youthful countenance, bowing his
shoulders with gruesome grief, hamper-
ing his stride with symptoms of patriotic
paralysis. His noble father has his trials
in another place. By comparison with
his son-and-heir's lot in the Commons,
life in the Lords is at least bearable.
With untamed spirit, not always subject
to the discipline of Party, Lord LoNdoN-
DERRY (using the phrase in strict Parlia-
mentary sense) kicks out afore and
ahint. Generally attacks attenuated
minority on benches opposite; if need
be does not spare his diplomatic Leader
on front bench below. On Lord
CASTLEREAGH in the Commons the sun
never shines. Ever he sits in the
shadow of the supremacy of a man-
eating Radical Government hurrying on
to abysmal depths of Socialism.
His condition brought under direct
notice of sympathising House by not
infrequent habit of putting questions
designed to floor FLUELLEN or to take
the wind out of WINSTON. A small
matter, curious in its way and significant
of the situation, to note how when he
slowly rises from front bench below
Gangway to put a question he looks as
old as his father. When, having re-
sumed his seat, he listens to reply that
inevitably reveals fresh duplicity on
part of the Government, he looks ap-
preciably older. -
Business done. — Lords, suspending
Standing Orders, pass Budget, if not
“without alteration of a comma,” yet, as
PREMIER says, “in all substantial respects
unaltered.”
Friday. — Budget received Royal
Assent ; both Houses adjourned for
Spring Recess.

Life assumed a brighter hue for me
to-day, when for the first time this
season I took my flannel suit from my
wardrobe (let us call it a wardrobe, at
any rate) and put part of it on my lack,
part on my chest, and the remainder on
my legs. “If we cannot have adventure

wore this suit was in September, 1909.
I then invited myself to stay with my
sister, who, owing to the fault of her
husband, is married. He becoming
obstreperous, I informed my go d

with him on my way South, and thence
made my way to my reverend uncle's

there, I returned to London, wrote an
article derogatory to all brothers-in-law,
Georges and uncles, and sadly placed
the flannel suit in the wardrobe, from
which I this morning took it for the
first time this season (life then assuming
a brighter hue).
Putting my hand in the trouser pocket,
I drew forth to the gaze of an astonished
mirror no other thing than a key. To
you a key may be an every-day affair,
to be regarded neither with excitement,
suspicion, joy, nor even curiosity. There
may be chained to your person a dozen
or two of these treasures, each unlocking
some private drawer, each excluding an
inquisitive public from the secrets of
your amours and finance. For me there
are no keys, no private drawers, no
the business of Edward THE CONFESSOR
or the foolish attributes of 2 plus 2.
If nay, then it is George's stable key.
Picture George s corpulent horse
smiling through the stable window,
through which food can be passed in
but wild horses cannot be dragged out.
Men must have walking exercise. Dumb
animals must be protected. Stable doors
were made to be locked, and locked
before the horse is gone.
“George,” I shall say, “what a nice
figure you have got! You must have
been doing a lot of walking since I last
saw you. Once I thought you were
going to be fat.” I shall have him at
my mercy then, for he is a bad arguer
even when he is cool and collected.
Failing him, there only remains my
her equality, not by acquiring her vote |
but by getting rid of her husband's. In-
asmuch as that woman is my sister,
how shall I not rejoice?
Ah, little sister, I see you sitting
before your fire, secure in the possession
of your warder-off of burglars, happy,
contented and independent. But do I also
see your head swelling a little with this
new independence? Do I see familiarity
breeding contempt, security begetting
carelessness? Yes, I fear I do, and the
general outlook becomes on that account
less pleasing.
You will take to the unwomanly
pastime of thinking, and sooner or later
your thoughts will light on me. At
once you will connect me with the key
and, in a light-hearted moment, you will

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ALGERNoN GissiNG has a very engaging way of making
Love in the Byways (F. W. White). Here are a dozen short
stories of the marriages and givings in marriage of country
folk, each opening with its little dilemma, each concluding
to the happy sound of the right wedding bells. Here honest
yeomen make progress with comely lasses. Trouble sets in,
but nice-spoken gentlemen intervene and all is well. Now
and then an old-fashioned tune is played on the village
violin; occasionally there is a note of tragedy; once there is
almost murder. For the most part the moral is that the course
of true love may not run smoothly, but does eventually get you
there. The author treats his simple, obvious themes with an
easy grace. His style, marred only by an excess of “com-
mencements,” itself suggests the sunlight and single aim of
rustic life. Not for him is the movement, the dust and the
thrill of the town. None of his characters deals in subtle
sex problems or the intricate detection of crime. Only one
of them even smokes a cigar. Let me recommend you, after
the rush of a busy day and in your less complex moods, to
read the book. You will not sit up half the night to finish
it. More probably you will retire at the decent hour of ten
under the temporary illusion that you are in the country
yourself.
It has long been the mournful habit of publishers to
maintain that short stories appeal but little to the popular
taste. We live, nevertheless, in an age of literary dram-
drinking; the public displays a passionate desire for snippets,
loves to assimilate its literature in small doses, and enjoys
the classics in compressed tabloid form. Even the student
of biography would appear to share Mr. ALFRED LESTER's
preference for “a short life and a gay one.” If, therefore,
the short stºry has fallen into disfavour, brevity cannot be
regal ded as its sole excuse for unpopularity. The writers
of short stories are as numerous as the sands of the seashore,
and, alas ! too often as arid. Against their bleak and dreary
background a few clear-cut polished gems shine out, like
broken bottles on the beach, with redoubled effulgence. In
Corporal Sam and Other Stories (SMITH, ELDER) “Q” once
more proves his right to a place, with KIPLING, JACOBs,
CoNRAD, and perhaps one other, in the very front rank of
modern story-tellers. - He is a past-master of his craft,
dramatic, deft, full of humour and imagination. The reader
who is depressed by the somewhat morbid ending of the
story from which this collection derives its title will be
relieved by the cheerful sentimentality of “Colonel Baigent's
Christmas,” or “My Christmas Burglary.” He will join
with Troy in the laughter evoked by the discomfiture of the
facetious Mayor Pinsent, and share in sympathv the sorrows
of Sir Felix Feliz-Williams. For all who delight in tales
of adventure and romance “Q” provides a rich and whole-

It is a very gallant period (“Od's heart” for the gentle-
men, and “La ” for the ladies, you know) that Mr. RAFAEL
SABATINI has chosen for his Anthony Wilding (HUTChinson);
but I don't think he has made the most of his cavalier.
He should either have flung him (dragging me behind)
whole-heartedly into the cause of MonMoUTH, which I admit
would have been a pretty difficult job, or else have painted
such an attractive portrait of the man that I could forgive
the rather ineffectual rôle he plays in the Protestant rising of

the West. As it is, Mr. Wilding (an accredited agent of the
Duke) is not present at any action, and escapes the charge
of treason at the end, through the circumstance that he holds
a letter compromising SUNDERLAND, which he ought to have
delivered to the invader. But (shade of MonTRose!) this is
not the stuff of which my idols are made when they work for
a hopeless cause. On the other hand his love-affair was
brisk and breezy enough. He forced Ruth Westmacott to
marry him at the beginning of the book by promising to
spare her brother's life (the young man had insulted him),
and she fell in love with him afterwards during a series of
exciting and mutual rescues, of sufficient h.p. to have carried
the unfortunate pretender to victory. On the whole I think
I was most attracted to Mr. Nick Trenchard, the hero's
friend, a very raffish rake-hell, whatever that may be, who
remarks in one place, “Not thirsty ? Why, lad, it's the beast
that drinks only when he thirsts. And in that lies one of
the main differences between beast and man,” a sentiment
almost worthy of Athos in his unregenerate days.

Wilding invites him to
I am not quite certain which of the many problems con-
tained in Mrs. PARRY TRUScott's new novel is the special one
that gives its title to The Question (WERNER LAURIE). One
might suppose it to be the choice between musical fame and
domestic happiness that Rupert May had to take, or rather
that Josephine, the ambitious, took for him. Or again, it
may refer to the doubt as to which of her two lovers, Rupert
or Pemuel, this same Josephine will finally accept. What is
more to the point is that Mrs. Truscott has written about it
all in a manner that makes a usual story unusually charming.
She has an appreciation, half humorous and half tender, for
muances of character, and a gift of translating them into
language that is both fresh and delightful. The Question
is a book of which no page can be missed without loss. But
because I have enjoyed it so much, and shall look forward
with interest to its successor, let Mrs. TRUSCOTT pardon me if
I entreat her not again to illustrate it with a “photographic
study” of her heroine. This is a growing practice with
novelists, against which the protests of the sentimental should

Mr. John BARNETT,
the author of Eve in

is too much given to
the trick of talking to
his readers about his

he the potter. When
he says, “I believe

she looked older than

she was startled,” he

viting me to peep'
through the chink. But Mr. BARNETT, seeking, I suppose,
to make his puppets extra lifelike, only seems to me
to make more visible the strings by which they are
pulled. Apart from this flaw, which may not irritate
others as it does me, there are good points in the book,
notably the picture of Eve's old father, who, engaged on a
magnum opus which dulls his conscience to the duty and
necessity of writing pot-boilers, throws the whole weight of
the household on to Eve's pretty shoulders. However, after
blushing and working unseen through twenty-three years'
existence in Bloomsbury, she visits a worldly aunt in the
Garden of England, and is introduced by Mr. BARNETT to a
rather second-rate Adam and a modified Eden. Unfortu-
nately Adam, like some other young Members of Parliament,
has a swelled head and is not too pleasant to live with. So
Eve runs away to Bloomsbury, and it is up to Mr. BARNETT to
devise some means of reconciling the once fond pair; which
he does, on the principle that pity is akin to love, by
afflicting Eve with poverty and Adam with temporary blind-
ness as the result of a railway accident; after which it only
remains to present them with two single first-class tickets
back to Eden.
An author who has an intimate knowledge of the country
and of village life appeals to me so strongly that I am loath
to find fault with MARY J. H. SKRINE’s A Stepson of the Soil
(ARNOLD). The tortuous sentence is, however, Miss SKRINE’s
trouble, and one specimen—on page 132—has got com:
pletely out of hand. But having made my grumble I
can honestly add that much enjoyment is to be obtained
from this book. For the most part the story is of humble
people, and without an exception the characters of the
peasants are admirably drawn. Phil White, the heroic waif,
both in his hero-worship and his gratitude for kindness, is
a lovable child, and for Jane Dallins I have a most sympa-
thetic admiration. The smell of the soil must come to any
lover of the country who reads of Phil White, and, after all,
it is as difficult to create a wholesome atmosphere as it is to
be a stylist.

SoME alarm was caused in Ireland
last week by the statement, published
in all the leading newspapers, that the

A SUGGESTED PRECAUTION.
IN VIEw of PRESIDENT Roosevelt's visit To LoNDoN.
MUST MEETINGS.
YoU hear a great deal just now about
May Meetings; let us tell you some-
thing about Must Meetings.
One of the most frequented centres
for Must Meetings is Bow Street Police
Court. There is generally a full and
orderly attendance; some of the most
eloquent and talented speakers are to
be heard there, pleading worthy causes
or denouncing desperate evils, and the
remarks of the gentleman presiding are
always sure of respectful attention.
A collection is a feature of these meet-
ings; it frequently occurs that someone
present, obviously not well-to-do, will
contribute as much as forty shillings.
A notable Must Meeting took place
at the Law Courts (King's Bench IV.)
last week, Mr. Justice CHANNELL pre-
siding. The principal speaker was
Mr. HALL CAINE, who dealt with the
interesting subject of “The Unwritten
Law.” The meeting ended quite
amicably, Mr. HALL CAINE shaking
hands with one of the speakers who,
earlier in the meeting, was evidently at
variance with him. It was noticed by
the audience that no collection was
taken, but we understand that a num-
ber of solicitors and barristers who
happened to be present will attend to
this matter in due course.
It is not unusual, excepting in the
month of May, which is unlucky for
the purpose, for Must Meetings to take
place in churches. We ourselves took
part in a meeting of this kind in a
country church not long ago. The
vicar presided. The meeting had been
brought about by a young man of our
acquaintance, who, however, strangely
enough, at the last minute was re-
luctant to attend, urging as his excuse
that he couldn't face all the trimmings.
“You must,” said his counsellors, and,
pushing him into a cab, they got him
at last to the church. In proof of the
wisdom of their efforts they found that
the meeting had waited ten minutes,
refusing to proceed without its insti-
gator. The young man was persuaded
to say a few words during the pro-
ceedings. There was also an attractive
young lady speaker; the organist played
some well-written compositions, and
the vicar's address will not readily be
forgotten by those who paid attention
to it.
The last of the series of Must Meet-
ings for which we have space took
place in the quiet of the study of the
headmaster of a well-known boarding
school for young gentlemen. Only two
persons attended, the headmaster and
one of the young gentlemen, who had
proved himself to be more young than
anything else. The subject of the
meeting was the effect of arboriculture
on the human anatomy, with experi-
ments. The younger of the two took
the chair, and was much affected by
the proceedings.
According to a local paper the Beck-
enham Urban District Council has
“decided to meet for three months
every three weeks.” This spirit is all
very well at the start, but it doesn't last
long.

[May 11, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TAXATION WITH MISREPRESENTATION.
AT any moment now I may get a
letter on blue paper from my friend
Mr. R. H. Penton, Surveyor or what
not of Taxes. It is certainly his turn
to write. My only doubt is as to what
he will say. If he says uncompromis-
ingly, “Please remit”—oh, no, but he
won't say “Please"—“Remit at once
£17,806 3s. 2d., the amount of income-
tax due for the year 1909-10,” then I
shall be all right. But if he simply asks
me to “Remit income-tax,” and makes
no mention of the amount, then I am a
doomed man. The whole truth will
come out, and I shall waste the best
years of the rest of my life in Portland
or Dartmoor. I hope that there will
be a choice, for I certainly prefer Port-
land.
+ * + +
I am the only man in England who
pays his income-tax with the utmost
cheerfulness and yet invariably pays the
wrong amount. If the Judge is a
gentleman he will take into conside-
ration the fact that the wrong amount
is considerably in excess of the right
amount. But I am afraid the law is no
gentleman. I put it, however, to the
JBritish public that this is an ex-
tenuating circumstance. You who read
this will, I am sure, feel that it is a fact
which justifies you in signing the peti-
tion to the Home Secretary for the
| condemned man's reprieve.
To begin at the beginning we must
go back a few years—to the day when
I received my first letter from my
friend Mr. R. H. Penton. It was a
long letter, rather involved, and full of
difficult words like “schedule.” Mr.
Penton had left a lot of spaces in this
letter, into most of which (when once
I had mastered the idea of the thing)
I had no difficulty in putting the word
“None.” But there was one space
which seemed to require figures. The
actual figures being left entirely to me,
I hastened to think of some.
What was wanted, of course, was
my estimated income for the ensuing
year. The }. way of estimating
this (I am told now) is to examine your
paying-in book for the previous three
years, add all the amounts together,
and divide by three. There were diffi-
culties in the way of my doing this,
however—even if I had known that it
was customary. The first was that I
had lost my paying-in book a long time
ago; the second was that I had earned
practically nothing the two previous
years. It would have seemed rather
cheap to return, as my estimated in-
come for the approaching year, only a
third of the glorious income which I
was then receiving.
You understand that it was some-
thing of an event to be allowed to pay
income-tax for the first time; a mile-
stone on the road to success to receive
a letter from Mr. R. H. Penton. There
had been two barren years during
which he had ignored me entirely.
Each morning that I sat down to
breakfast there was a frigid silence, an
utter absence of communication from
my friend the Surveyor. Now at last
I could bask in the smile of his friend-
ship. “Let me,” I said as I read his
letter again eagerly—“let me"—and I
hurriedly looked up “schedule” in the
dictionary—“let me really do the fellow
proud.”
I began to do him proud by getting
out my pass-book. A pass-book differs
from a paying-in book in two important
particulars, the more important of the
two being that the Bank looks after
your pass-book for you and sees that
you don't lose it. The other difference
is this: that, if you did happen to keep
and fill in a paying-in book, your cheque
of £10 from The Poultry Keeper's
Gazette would be entered “I’oultry
Reeper's Gazette, £10,” whereas in the
pass-book it is recorded simply as
“Cha. 3:10.” Now “Chd. 210’’ might
just as well be a birthday present from
an uncle or the return of a loan from a
friend; that is to say, you cannot be
certain whether it was part of your
income or not. Consequently I could
only get a rough idea of my earnings
from my pass-book—all I could say
was, “ They were not more than a
million pounds” (or whatever it was).
Very well; at the outside I had
earned a million F. in the last
year. But surely I hoped to earn more
than that in the ensuing year, or what
was Life, where was Ambition? The
least I could anticipate (if genius was
ever to be recognised) was two million
pounds. Now you cannot return
exactly two millions pounds as your
estimated income, or they will know
you are lying ; I added therefore (and
have added ever since) one pound eight
shillings and threepence for the sake of
verisimilitude. Two million and one
pounds eight shillings and threepence
was the amount of my return, and I
left it to Mr. Penton to work out the
tax due . . . Which he did very
quickly and accurately.
Ce n'est que le premier pas qui cáute,
as M. PAULAN said to the reporter. My
first step on the downward path (to give
the proverb a slightly different meaning)
has proved very costly since. A year
later I had another jolly letter from my
old college friend, Mr. R. H. Penton,
asking me again to think of an income.
Again I found that I couldn't possibly
have earned (or, rather, received) more
than a million, and by this time I knew
that genius wasn't being, and wasn't
going to be, recognised. But was
Penton, R. H. Penton, to think that I
was a failure? Was I to wear my
apparent decrease of income on my
sleeve for Pentons to peck at 2 Never!
Pride would not stand it. Two million
five-hundred-thousand and one pounds,
eight shillings and threepence, Mr. Sur-
veyor, and make what you like of that!
+ + : ::
And so it goes on. But here is my
difficulty, here is where prison threat-
ens me. I can never remember what
the amount was which 1 swore last
year to be a true estimate of this year's
income. I find fairly easily a sum
which is certainly greater than my
latest earnings; then I add some round
figures to make it more than my return
of the year before; and then one pound
eight and threepence (I think) for veri-
similitude. A total obtained so subtly
can never be duplicated. If I am asked
for the figures again I am done.
Up till now there has been no trouble,
Mr. Penton is a gentleman and accepts
my word. But with the rejection of
the Budget I began to be afraid. If he
demands now a certain sum (any sum),
all is well, but if he begins all over
again, and asks me to declare my in-
come afresh, I shall have to tell him
that I haven't the least idea what we
decided it was. For of course I lost
his ante-November letters on the sub-
ject a long time ago.
Well, I can only hope that it isn't a
serious offence to pay too much income-
tax. As I say, I pay it very cheerfully,
I get a lot in return for it, really—mice
fat policemen, and beautiful lifeguards,
and cheap stamps, and (above all) the
knowledge that, if ever I did happen to
want eight and be unable to wait, I
should be in a position to shout for
them. And I have one thing, anyhow,
for which to be thankful. In my
return to Mr. Penton I did not (so far
as I can remember) claim rebate for
any children under sixteen. Had I
done so, 1 should certainly have for-
gotten by now upon how many children
I had claimed. A. A. M.

A SHORT WAY WITH PROPHETs.
I Found him in his laboratory affecting
to be busy.
“I want to know about the summer,”
id. “You are a weather expert?”
“Yes.”
“And you have discovered and an-
nounced that the summer is to be a cold
and wet one’’’
“Certainly,” he replied smilingly.
“Unusually so.”
“How do you know?” I asked him.
“The law of averages,” he said.
“What has happened will happen, you
know. The Gulf Stream . . .”
“But how do you know?” I repeated.
“Well, of course it remains to be
seen if we really know,” he replied;
“but probabilities . . .”
“My dear Sir,” I said, “do you mean
to tell me seriously that you consider
yourself justified, after collecting a few
measly probabilities—all the wrong way,
mind—in publishing to the world at
large your depressing conjectures?”
“But I am a man of science,” he
answered —“a professional meteorolo-
gist.”
“Professional Dismal Jimmy' " I ex-
claimed. “Why are you? Who wants
you to be one?”,
“I assure you,” he said, “I am greatly
in request. Journalists are continually
calling to interview me.”
“Yes,” I said, “in the hope that you
will have something decent to say. That
would be some good—cheer people up.”
“But science . . .” he began.
“My dear Sir,” I said, “do you remem-
ber last summer ?”
He shivered.
“Very well, them. You remember last
summer, and what a ghastly failure it
was ; and yet here in May, on the
threshold of things, when hope runs
high, you dare to come forward and say
you have reason to believe, from some
twopenny-halfpenny statistics regarding
the Gulf Stream, that the forthcoming
summer will be cold and wet too? You
can do that?”
“Science . . . .” he began again.
“Ha,” I cried, “if it were not so ex-
pensive—twenty shillings and costs—I
would apply to such science the only
epithet it deserves. My point is that
when a man does not know we can do
without his morbid conjectures. You
don't know ; how can you? No one
knows. Very well, then, hold your
tongue, or say something nice.”
He smiled tolerantly.
“You haven't held your tongue,” I
continued, “and you have said some-
thing rotten. I am going to make you
take it back. My wretched countrymen
have suffered too long; they must have
hope, and you must give it to them.”
“But science . . . .” he began once
more, “by
tation . . .
“Prophets can always hedge,” I said,
“and you are going to; ” and so saying
I drew from my pocket a window-clean-
ing syringe of enormous calibre, and
began to play upon him with it from a
reservoir fastened to my shoulders. He
was in a corner and could not escape.
“Now,” I said, as he squirmed and
struggled, “you know something of
what a cold and wet summer means.
Write a new forecast. Quick.” -
And he did so. –
So, if you see in the papers next wee
that the summer, after all, is to be a good
one, you will know whom to thank.

THE WOCAL CURE.
[A distinguished expert has recently given it
forth as an undoubted fact that the exercise of
the vocal cords is extremely beneficial to the
general health.]
WHEN I feel a trifle “off,”
With a headache or a chill, I
Do not call in METCHNIKoff
And his legions of bacilli; t
No opposing millions execute a scrum
In my tum. -
But I exercise the cords
, Of my voice (if I may so call
That arrangement which affords
, Certain sounds, remotely vocal,
Like the night-song of the tabby who
reviles
On the tiles).
When I shiver in the grip
Of the “flu”—you'll think me
faddy,
But I loudly utter “Yip,”
Followed quickly by “iaddy,”
And the baffled germs with one
despairing cry
Do a guy.
When sea-sickness makes me crave
For the funeral bark of Charon,
I just hymn the ocean wave
And the life that men lead thereon;
Which I fancy turns the others that
are ill
Sicker still.
s
When the savage thrills of gout
Rack my body with their malice,
Ivociferously shout
For the whereabouts of Alice;
It's surprising what a different man
I feel
For the squeal.
Not for me the weary tour
Of those Continental places
Where you take your costly cure
With the dismallest of faces.
I can purchase all the health for
which I long
For a song.
JAPAN AND THE JAPANESE.
A FEw words, dear reader, on the
gallant, Japanese, who are to entertain
us at the Bush of the Shepherd during
the summer, will not be out of place.
For to visit the Exhibition totally ig-
norant of this people would be an im-
mense mistake. The more one knows
of a nation whose exhibits one is to
study and admire at a charge of a
shilling a head, the better wilt one be
instructed. And not only its products of
commerce and art, but its pleasures too;
for how could one rightly be amused on
the Flip Flap, that ancient-Japanese
device for depriving the tourist of his
silver, if one did not know its history?
Listen therefore to a discourse on the
Japanese as profound as it is timely and
as veracious as it is brief. -
Japan—but first a word should be
said about the extraordinary contradic-
tion of a famous line by one of our best
poets—not Mr. Swinburne, as it happens
this time, nor Mr. RhoADEs, but Mr.
KIPLING himself—that is about to be
established. Mr. KIPLING, in a moment
of what was then considered inspiration,
but is now recognised by all the best
intellects as error, once wrote that
“East is East and West is West, and
never the twain shall meet.” How false
that is—no matter how fine as poetry—
one has only to go to Shepherd's Bush
to ascertain. For no one can say that
Japan is not in the East: its very flag is a
representation of the rising sun : hence
the new and witty description of Shep-
herd's Bush as the land where the sun
never sets (which has been ascribed to
Mr. SHAw, but was really said by Lord
CARRINGTON). Very well, then, here are
the Japanese, an essentially Eastern
crowd, mingling with English sight-
seers in London, which is as essentially
the West; and, what is more, at Shep-
herd's Bush, which is in the West of
London. What do you think of that?
Mr. KIPLING's reply will be eagerly
awaited by many thousands of readers.
Japan has sent its best to the exhi-
bition, and what Japan's best means I
leave you to guess. For few nations are
busier in the production of works of
utility. Every man in Japan, for
example, wears clothes of some sort, and
those have to be made; every woman
has her ornaments, and these have to be
made also. Here we have at once the
nucleus of considerable industry. Then
there are the utensils of life, decorations,
furniture, and so forth, all peculiar to
Japan, as our own are peculiar to
England. Not that interchange is im-
possible. On the contrary, it is not an
infrequent experience, on entering a
Japanese house, to find an English
article, or, on entering an English house,
to find a Japanese one. (I am, for

; example, using a Japanese fan with my
left hand at this moment to correct the
heated state into which the exercise of im-
parting so much information has thrown
me.)
One other little point about the East
and West question, if I may be allowed to
return to it. Japan, although it is the
East to us, is of course the West to any
one on the other side of it. By moving
one's position rapidly, in, say, a very
swift aeroplane—whether a bi- or mono-
is immaterial—one could, you observe,
make an absolute fool of the compass.
To do so would, of course, be wrong,
since one must not tamper with science;
but there it is. Nothing to our English
way of thinking is so West as America.
“To the West, to the West, to the land
of the free,” we sing. The American
Exhibition, a few years ago, was called
* The Far West.” But how does a
Japanese think of America? As the
East. That's very extraordinary, isn't
it? It just shows how careful men and
poets must be. Standing on his strand,
which may or may not be made of coral,
and looking towards California, he says,
in his own language, which I will not
give here, but will translate literally,
“See the East !” But that is not all; for,
standing on the strand on the opposite
side of his profoundly important and
picturesque country and locking to-
wards China, he exclaims in his own
tongue, which again I translate, “See
the West " " And yet how do we refer
to the Chinese? As Orientals, by the
word Oriental.
So you see what an interesting people
the Japanese are, and how valuable to us
all, morally and mentally, should their
exhibition be.
“Mr. Briand was speaking at a political
banquet at St. Chamond when a mob of social-
ists smashed the windows of the hall and
stoned the Premier and his party as they were
leaving. Several were hit. M Briand was
quite calm throughout. He was not hit.”
Reuter in “The Allahabad Leader.”
Certainly it was easier for him to keep
calm in these circumstances.
THE MONTHLY SWEEP.
The Major seldom broods or thinks
About the little sums he sinks
In Bogey pools, nor cares a whack
When not a farthing flutters back;
Although his profits are so meagre,
Month after month he turns up eager,
And hope gives birth
To the forlorn sixpennyworth.
His luck, of course, is always rough,
Yet, for some holes he has enough
Philosophy to disregard
The frequent minus on his card;
Also its paucity of plusses
Engenders only casual cusses;
Hopeful and keen,
He hacks along from green to green.
'Tis at the twelfth, beyond the furze,
Where oft the ultimate occurs;
He takes his card and with a frown
Observes that he's a dozen down ;
Whereat the ineffectual sniter
Utters some comments (which the writer
Wisely omits)
And tears the beastly thing to bits'

THE GOOD BEASTS' BOOK.
THE benevolent interest in (so-called)
dumb creatures which has always been
evinced by The Daily Mail has recently
culminated in The Harmsworth Natural
History—a work whose first number,
we are told, “has opened the eyes of
thousands to the extraordinary fascina-
tion of this subject.” Much more im-
portant, however, than mere human
ecstasy is the attitude of admiration
adopted by those immediately concerned.
To put it briefly, this brilliant under-
taking has created a furore throughout
the whole animal world. The first
fortnightly part was eagerly devoured
by an Indian rhinoceros at Regent's
Park, whither our special representative
journeyed with a bundle of copies; and
so marked was the enthusiasm of the
monkeys that they actually tore several
numbers to fragments in their eager
rivalry for the possession of these per-
sonal records. A chimpanzee chattered
incoherently on beholding his simul-
acrum in a coloured plate, and the
duck-billed platypus and the South
American armadillo were prostrated by
a violent rush of blood to the head—
always a symptom of extreme joy among
these species. A thoroughly reliable
keeper asserted that he had never seen
the larger cattle so moved by the sight
of any printed publication—not even
The Evening Gnus.
Outside the Gardens also The Harms-
worth Natural History is the sole topic
of conversation among domestic animals.
Several cab-horses have been noticed
wistfully eyeing the bookstalls, and
Newfoundland dogs particularly are
walking about with an unusual perki-
ness, in the belief that the paper em-
ployed for this venture was made from
the wood-pulp of their own native isle.
Everywhere humanitarians are to be
found busily tearing up copies and
strewing them with the morning crumbs
for the sparrows, in order that our
feathered friends may line the walls of
their ideal homes with suitable literature
and works of art. There is also some
talk at Carmelite House of issuing an
élition-de-lu.ce on currant buns for the
benefit of the Polar bears.
“A Maidenhead fruiterer set a duck on hen
eggs, from which eleven ducklings were
hatched.”—Newbury Weekly News.
At Marlow they think more of the
local poulterer who gummed a mar-
malade label on a pear tree, and hatched
eleven oranges.
ANOTHER SHATTERED ROMANCE.
(Aeroplane is the name of the latest colour
for women's dresses.)
SHE wrote to her Thomas to meet her
On Saturday evening at eight,
And knew, in his ardour to greet her,
The gentleman wouldn't be late;
But, fearing the crowd that is often about
At corners of streets which are “main,”
She added, to guide him in picking her
Out,
“I’ll come in my aeroplane.”
But now their attachment is ended;
Their parting was painful and rude;
For he was extremely offended,
And she was much misunderstood.
He blamed her for arrogance paltry and
mean,
And made a ridiculous fuss,
Because she had mentioned her flying-
machine
And really arrived in a 'bus.
Financial Candour.
From an “Appreciatory Letter,” pub-
lished by way of testimonial, in the
prospectus of a firm of money-lenders:–
“GENTLEMEN, - I have reason to be much
indebted to you for the manner in which you
dealt with me.”

AUTHORMOBILITY.
THE evidence recently given by Mr.
HALL CAINE as to the strange behav-
iour of his car has caused great excite-
ment in motoring circles. It will not
easily be forgotten how, in his own
words, in order to avoid colliding with
a boy driving a cart “the chauffeur
tobogganed into the bank, and the
heavy car, with its great momentum,
hurled itself into the air—and landed
on its feet.” As though this were not
enough, later in the same month
(August, 1908), as he was on the point
of stepping into his automobile at the
top of the drive at his house, “the car
broke away from the brakes and ran
down the slope. Many women and
children were in the park. I was in
fear that the car, which weighed two
tons, would kill someone before it came
to a standstill.”
As the result of careful inquiries we
have ascertained that this eccentric be-
haviour is by no means unusual in cars
owned by literary men and women.
On the other hand Mr. MAx PEM-
BERTON writes that his car, though only
weighing three tons, is extraordinarily
sensitive. He distinctly remembered
how once, after nearly running over a
pig on the Great North Road, it sat up
on end and cried like a child. Mr.
PEMBERTON adds that the drive to his
house is three miles long and that on
his birthday as many as fifteen hundred
people have picnicked in his grounds.
Miss PHYLLIs DARE recounts a thril-
ling adventure that once befell her
while on her way to her photographer.
As she was passing by a farm, a spring
chicken, attracted by the sound of “Pip
Pip,” suddenly ran out in front of her
car. She was herself at the wheel,
and, hastily porting the helm, was
thrown from her seat into a haystack
in an adjoining field. The chicken was
so grateful for its rescue that it insisted
on following her home, and had re-
mained with her as a pet ever since.
But for several days she was unable to
fulfil her photographic engagements
owing to a sharp attack of hay fever.
Sir ARTHUR ConAN Doyle's chauf-
feur, on being interviewed by our repre-
sentative, said that his master on one
occasion in a fit of absent-mindedness
put his motor at a ha-ha in his park,
with the result that the car, weighing
four tons, turned a complete somersault,
alighting on its bonnet. His master's
park contained 400 acres, and the deer
were much excited by the incident.
Mr. PéLISSIER describes a curious
incident that occurred to him as he
was reading The Contemporary Review
in his car a few days ago. His car is
fitted with a horn which can sound all

Mr. FRANCIS GRIBBLE, in reply to
our representative, related an exciting
incident which occurred while he was
finishing The Love Affairs of Chris-
topher Columbus or else The Sweethearts
of Confucius, he could not remember
which. As he was approaching a level
crossing at the rate of fifty-five miles
an hour, he suddenly became conscious
that an express train was coming along
at full speed. He applied the brakes
with great force and the car leapt clean
into the air over the advancing train,
landing on its feet at the other side.
The accident fortunately did not affect
his health in the slightest; he completed
the Love Affairs of Christopher Colum-
bus that night, and before going to bed
began to work on The Courtships of
Methuselah.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.

Park Lane, May.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--This is going to be
a Japanese summer, and those who
aren't lucky enough to have dear little
tucked-up eyes, a mysterious smile, and
an inscrutable manner, by nature, must
get them by art, or be out of the picture,
my dear, voilà tout. Madame Blagueuse,
the beauty-doctor, is simply most im-
mensely successful with her new Japanese
treatment, and we poor things who, for
our sins, have nothing of the Far East
in our appearance or our ways, go to her
three times a week to have our eyes tucked
up and to learn the mysterious smile and
the inscrutable manner, also the correct
oriental mode of waggling a fan. She
says my progress
resents this attitude on the part of her
own aristocracy, and especially com-
plains, I'm told, of Lady Lacksiller, one
of her countrywomen (you remember
Portia Blogg's wedding last year to Sir
Angus Lacksiller of that Ilk). The
Bunker woman attacked Lady L. in the
lounge at the Recherché and demanded
an explanation in terms like unto these :
—“You hadn't need to put on frills
with me, Portia Lacksiller, and leave me
on the mat. Weren't we class-mates in
old times?—and wasn't I the better
scholar of the two?—and hadn't I more
mentality than you? What's the
matter with me and Silas anyway?”
But it was of no avail. The baronet's
better half continues to treat her old
class-mate to what she calls the cold mit.
Well, but about my grievance. The
T. Silas Bunkers have rented Fewacres

thing. (Next to getting into society,
there's nothing Americans love better
than going to law.) This is not the only
instance this season of a sort of habeas
corpus way of letting one's town house.
I hear that old Lady Needmore is making
a very good thing of letting Needmore
House, with herself in it, to some pickle
people. - -
You'll be sorry to hear that George
and Babs have scored a failure with
their Social Bureau. They were getting
on quite nicely, when an unlucky thing
happened that wrecked the Bureau.
Mrs. T. Silas Bunker is in this story too.
She has got through about the average
amount of marrying in her own country,
and T. Silas is her fifth husband, I
believe. Well, when Mrs. B. gave her
first party, she went to George and

I'm a good deal vexed with my
respected parents just now, and if I
weren't the most dutiful of daughters—
but never mind about that. This is
what has happened. Among the new
Americans in London for the season are
the T. Silas Bunkers (of “Bunker's
Dime Bazaars,” which are to be found
in every quarter of every city of every
State of the Union). They're rich beyond
the dreams, and are enormously anxious
to be “on the premises.” The few people
they do know in London are English,
I believe, for with true republican
exclusiveness their compatriots over
here, those who have as many as two
generations behind them, let them
severely alone. Mrs. T. Silas bitterly
House this summer, the London home of
your own Blanche once upon a time, and
the other day I had a letter from Old
Court, in which Mamma tells me that
“these Bunker people are willing to pay
quite a fancy rent for the season, if you,
my child, will sign the enclosed agree-
ment promising to go to Mrs. Bunker's
parties. You were always a good-natured
girl, Blanche, and I feel sure you won't
refuse to use your social popularity to
help your parents. (When the money's
once paid, of course you can do as you
like about going to the parties.) What
with this wicked Budget and every-
thing going down in value and every-
thing else getting horribly expensive,

And now, my dear, what do you think

A good many people are going in for
the No-food cult, the Dick Flummerys
among others. Indeed, dinners and
suppers seem to be by way of becoming
extinct functions. Dick says that till
you've been without food for a week
you don't know what you're really
capable of. I don't think that would
be a very reassuring thing to hear from
anyone looking as wild and haggard as
Dick does now, if one happened to be
tête-à-tête with him and some knives!
Dotty tells me that, with their tiny
house and small means, they find enter-
taining much easier now they belong to
the No-food set. Their little rooms will
hold twice as many no-fooders as ordi-
nary people, she says, and then there's
no expense of feeding 'em. - No, indeed.

Got Down To his work ALREADY.”
My little Devonshire coz continues to
distinguish herself. People have been
awfully sweet to her for my sake, and
Lady Manoeuvrer's girl, Violet, asked
her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding
next month. I found, if you please, my
dear, that she had actually refused I
asked what she meant by doing such a
thing. “Oh! please, please,” she said,
“I couldn't be bridesmaid at such a
dreadful wedding. She can't love that
fearful old Lord Lucre; no girl could ;
he's seventy and lame, and has a glass
eye. Please, please, cousin Blanche,
don't make me be a bridesmaid—because
I won't!”
Pretty good for an eighteen-year-old
rustic, ell?
“You absurd prehistoric chit!” I
said. “Many girls think seventy more
fascinating than thirty. Lord Lucre is
a most charming man. He's not lame
—that's simply the hereditary Lucre
walk; and as for his having a glass
eye, to a certain type of face a glass eye
is immensely becoming. It's exceedingly
forward of you, Rosemary, to talk to me
about love in this way. Girls have
nothing whatever to do with love. All
they have to think of, quand il s'agit
des moces, is duty.”
But I make no progress with her.
Few people realise the amount of pig-
headed obstinacy and power of won't
that's waiting till called for in your
blushing, white-muslin, yes-and-no girl.
If it weren't that I hate to own myself
defeated, I'd turn her out of training at
once, for she'll never win even a selling

BLANCHE.
From a story in the “Union Jack
Library”:—
“There was, in fact, a ghastly silence after
Plummer's last remark. Not a sound came
from the room, not a word from either of the
men. Tinker knew that kind of silence. It
was the kind that ushers in earthquakes, that
creeps up the spine and pants noiselessly in the
small of the back—the kind that only comes to
any man, especially to any two men at the same
time, when catastrophe grips them unexpectedly
by the gizzard.”
If this is what Christian Science means
by the “silent treatment,” no wonder it
is effective.

If the wrestlers are the villagers referred
to, we do not agree that they are un-

they are shockingly pampered.
A CROESUS BY PRESUMPTION.
[Baldness is said to be on the increase as the
result of motoring.j
My obvious tendency to moult
Has caused me such unpleasant shocks
In former times that I would bolt
And purchase lotions for the locks.
It always made my spirits low
To realise that I, who rather
Aspired to be Dorinda's beau,
Was being taken for her father.
But now a mild contentment dwells
Within my breast, for I can snatch
Some solace, though my mirror tells
A constant tale of thinning thatch.
Folk deem my lack of hair to be
A witness, silent but emphatic,
That I'm a motorist, i.e.
A person who is plutocratic.
Extract from an advertisement in The
Allahabad Leader, entitled, “A Genial
Hint to the Titulary Magnates or their
Equivalent Contemporaries”:—
“With this an uncommon advantage of train-
ing and remodelling the physical and mental
morality of the youth is also declared and
assured. By this is meant the formation of
such noble character, as may consistently be
rational to refer to common sense.”
You see exactly the sort of youth that
the system turns out.

AT THE PLAY.
“HELENA’s PATH.”
To those of us who had read the
delightful story of Helena's Path in
Mr. ANTHONY HoPE's book, Tales of
Two People, its production, dramatised
by Mr. CosMo GoRDON LENNox, at
the Repertory Theatre, was a distinct
disappointment. To the others who
had not read it, and who expected
(probably) something powerful and
gloomy, the whole thing must have
come as a surprise. I feel sure that
there were a good many people present
on the first might who were taken by
surprise, with the result (as it seemed
to me) that a pretty but delicate
comedy found itself in the wrong
atmosphere, and was asphyxiated at

the start. Certainly on several occa-
sions, when the whole house might
have been expected to ripple with
laughter, I found to my horror that I
was doing all the rippling myself.
The audience was not alone to blame,
of course; the play in any case was
not so good as one expected it to be,
although as it stood it didn't have a
fair chance. The Second Act, “The
Willage Cricket Ground at Fillby,” was
the failure. Too much had to happen
here in too small a space and in too
short a time; towards the end it all
became so unreal that one could
almost imagine it was a musical
comedy. I don't think Mr. CHARLES
BRYANT as Lord Lynborough (the hero)
improved matters by wearing a high
collar for his cricket; this is only done
}. very smart young men at Syden-
8. Lll.
his Parasites.
The story concerns the quarre?
beween Lynborough and Helena (Mar-
chesa di San Servolo) over a right-of-
way. In the book the man gradually
wins over, the supporters of the
woman, and the woman those of the
man; in the play this has to be done
rather quickly. In the book, they take
some time to fall in love with each
other; on the stage we cannot see this
gradual process. In the book (though
this is a small point) the gallant Lyn-
borough leaps a 5ft. 6in. gate and knocks
down a bailiff who opposes him; on the
stage the jumping is elementary, and the
ju-jitsu obviously dependent on the com-
pliance of the bailiff. These are some
of the reasons why, after the play was
over, I went home and read the book
again with increased enjoyment.
Mr. BRYANT makes a very handsome
Lynborough, though I think as a
charmer he “presses” rather; and
Miss IRENE VANBRUGH was charming
without any effort as Helena. But the
best written, and therefore the best
played, part of all was that of Lady
Norah Mountliffey, which was delight-
fully given by Miss MARY JERROLD.

The situation in the
First Act took a tedious long time to
explain itself, and it was greatly to the
credit of Mr. BourcHIER that his appear-
ance at the last moment should have
dissipated our ennui and put us on
tolerable terms with ourselves. Four
months’ retirement in gaol had not only
left Colonel Bridau's sword-arm as agile
as ever, but had given him enough:
stored energy to carry the rest of the
play through on his broad back. One
thinks of the reserved and massive
strength of that earlier PAUL POTTER’s
“Bull" at the Hague. But other
qualities beside brute vigour went to
the making of this swashbuckler, and
chiefly an undefeated gift for farce.
Yet the swift and windy humour of the
part never quite condoned its brutality,
and the two together made a jarring
discord when they came to clash with a
tragedy that broke a woman's heart.
The bustling fun, noisy enough to
deaden for a time our sense of the fit-
mess of things, had worn off by the
end; we were rather shocked to finds
how little there was to choose between .
the virtue of the hero and the vice of
the villain ; and the final curtain left
us critical and cold.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
In any struggle between a brilliant slacker and a dull
plodder, I am all for the slacker; in real life he is so much
more interesting. If I had actually met Harry Belfield at
the Savoy (where he was generally to be found of an evening)
I expect I should have been loyal to him as against Andy
Hayes, the other protagonist of Mr. ANTHONY HoPE's novel,
Second String (Nelson; 2s.). Not having experienced his
charm at first hand, I am prepared to acquiesce in his
dethronement by Andy, but without prejudice to my general
feeling about his kind. Harry, though, was something
more than a slacker; indeed, in his relations with women it
was his pace which was his undoing. He was never really
happy until he had begun, a new flirtation; and even when
he was engaged to Vivien he must needs be making love to
her companion, Isobel. When this came out he was done
for in the county. He fled back to the Savoy, his place as
I never quite realised before what a good thing it is that
so many people will ask questions about things which don't
really concern them. If that had not been a widely-spread
human characteristic, I gather that Mr. and Mrs. ThorSTON
would not have written Leaves from an Afghan Scrapbook,
or, at any rate, that the leaves would not have been taken out
and published by John MURRAY. The authors say modestly
that they have “endeavoured to supply answers,” and, since
the chapters each consist of more or less detached notes on a
variety of topics, the book may perhaps be regarded simply
from that unassuming standpoint. But there is a good deal
more to it than that. Collectively, these chapters provide a
very fascinating survey of a country which is practically un-
known to Englishmen. Mr. THORNTON managed a tanning
and bootmaking factory for the AMIR, and Mrs. THORNToN
taught one of his wives drawing, gardening, and other
subjects. Incidentally, the pair were successful in intro-
ducing skating, treacle pudding, and other British sports
into the highest circles of Kabuli society. The book is
written with a simplicity, which lends value to the many
Vivien's lover and the Division's
surprises inevitable in a land which
candidate being taken by dear old
dull Andy. Mr. HoPE has drawn
Harry Belfield's character very care-
fully and very cleverly; in the end
we have to admit that the pride of
Meriton is a waster who will never
do any good. Isobel Vintry, who
brings about the great collapse, is
not seen so clearly ; still, she was a
woman, which was always enough for
Harry. But “The Nun" (a dear
person from the music-halls) “in-
trudes” almost as delightfully as did
Peggy in a former book of Mr. HoPE's ;
indeed, putting aside that book, I
cannot remember any which has given
me greater pleasure to read than
Second String.
To say (as people almost certainly
will) that Mr. CHARLEs MARRiott, the
author of Now! (HURST AND BLACKETT)
owes a considerable debt to Mr. G. K.
is at once modern and mediaeval.
Almost anything might happen in
a country whose ruler rewards his
doctor for curing an attack of gout
by promoting him to be Brigadier-
General of Sappers and Miners.
If DoRoi HEA DEAKIN had provided
The Goddess Girl (CAssell) with a
local “Who's Who” I should have
been grateful. A few complications
are well enough, but by the time I
had been introduced to a poacher
who didn't poach, and a gardener
who wasn't really a gardener, and a
only the Goddess thought he was a
rich man in disguise and fell in love
with him—I was thinking that a list
of these people's amusements and
occupations would have saved a lot
of perplexity. All these men, it is
true, eventually explained themselves,
ChESTERTON, is neither here nor there.
The Worm (turning and rising to the occasion, after
but the title of the book remains a

trifle of added interest. Admittedly,
in “The Goddess,” Phillida Gale, and
though it will not be for all tastes; it is too modern for that.
The scheme of the thing indeed is so subtle that even I, who
am far, far cleverer than most, found myself at times irritated
by it, and inclined to suspect the author of affectation; so
that I doubt very much whether the circulating libraries will
make head or tail of it. The plot—what there is of it—is
concerned with the question whether Julia Kenwyn-Brown
shall marry Wilfrid Lambert, an every-day young man, or
Conrad Lowe ; the point about Conrad being that he be-
longed to a great secret society, the “Droppers Out,” whose
development and aims and general significance form the
real subject of the book. These Droppers Out, organised by
one Morrison from a headquarters in Cornwall, have for their
object to regenerate society by disintegration, or, in shorter
words, to take their own line and let everything else go. It
is all a little vague, and, as I say, I am not sure of having
rightly got the hang of it even now; but the results as told
by Mr. MARRiott are undeniably amusing. The scene in
which Julia and her delightful family discuss the question|.
of her engagement in the presence of the rival suitors would
make the fortune of a BERNARD SHAw comedy. So, if you like
that, you'll like this. Otherwise, don't worry.
although she stuck to her game-
keeper I can only think of her as a primitive American,
who said “vurry,” “cayn't,” and “I guess' far too often.
There is, however, another girl who was as natural and
human as Phillida was tiresome and divine. The Parson's
Sally has my unstinted admiration, and whether she was
controlling her father, her “general,” her ducks, or her
lover's relations, she had just that spark of "vivacity and
charm which makes a character unforgettable. As an act of
homage to Sally I should like this book to be rechristened
“The Very Human Girl.”
“The widow sighed and said, ‘How cold you English people are : If
you had been Spanish you would have kissed me.'
The young man promptly imprinted a kiss on the lady's lips.

Discontinued" we should hope (and expect) in the “Stop
Press” column.
“At the sixteenth Miss Titterton's ball unluckily trickled into the
bunker, which she lost.”—Daily Mail.
It didn't matter much, for, after all, there's no rule about
replacing hazards.

He was to give his kingly gage to-day; Our pleasure darkened and our sun gone down; Humbly before the Eternal Heart we bring,
And silent on our hearts the sorrow falls All thoughts are turned to where he bears the cross That of His grace and pity God may spare
Which only faith may stay. Who should have worn the crown. And give us back our King !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
To HIS MAJESTY KING EDWARD.
A CORONATION ODE, 1902.
My Liege and Sovereign Lord,
First of your line whose legend marks the might
Of Britain's Ocean-wide domain
Ere yet to-morrow's light
Beholds you leave her high memorial fane,
By that irrevocable rite
Of solemn oath and lifted sword,
Of holy oil and sacramental cup,
Crowned and anointed King;-
Before the dazing splendour blinds our sight,
And in our ears the gathered shout goes up
Of homage won from half the world;
And back from bended skies,
Flecked with the countless ripple of flags unfurled,
The shattering echoes ring and ring;-
While still our suppliant breath may rise
Like incense on the waiting air,
For you what vigil shall we hold to-night !
With what compelling prayer
Importune Him, the King of Kings,
To grant you health and years' increase,
Wisdom to keep your people's love,
And, other earthly gifts above,
The long-desired, the gift of Peace,
Alway to shield you with her shadowing wings 1
Little he dreamed, the last who bore your name,
Our boy-King Edward, dying ere the prime
Of that adventurous age
That fixed his royal sister's fame—
Little he dreamed how fair a heritage
Should fall to England's crown in after time.
Beyond the seas that ringed his island realm
Scarce any owned him Lord;
Great kingdoms stood that yet should reel
Beneath the clash of English steel,
Instant to overwhelm ;
Far lands were yet to win from out the waste
By patient courage strong to tame
Wild natures, earth's and man's, and make
On rude inhospitable shores
New English homes for the old England's sake.
And of their toil who lightly faced
Danger and death for this their best reward
To-day the garnered fruit is hers and yours.
So stands your Empire; over such a race,
Fearless and proud and free,
Whose hands have laid your Kingdom's base
Upon the outmost edges of the sea-
Loyal all times and now
Fresh-proven in the fierce assay of war,
You take the seal of lordship on your brow.
Small seems the labour, light the task
Of empery over lands that crave no more
The meed of conquering arms, but only ask
For silent annals after storm and strain.
And yet not easy is the weight to bear
That claims your kingly care.
To guard, unsullied still, that dear renown
Our fathers handed down;
To help us hold, through peace, our warrior-rights
Won in a thousand fights,
And sacred by our blood and tears;
To see we use, against the coming years,
Before its memory fade,
The lessons of the past, and draw
Knowledge from failure, and from loss a gain;
To humble arrogance, the curse of ease;
To make their consciences afraid
Who bid your England fold her hands in sleep;
To be of truth the mirror, and a law -
Of honour unto men of all degrees;
To champion the Faith and keep
The fear of God before your people's eyes;–
Such royal service we, who gladly bring
Our own to greet you on your festal way—
We ask in turn of England's King !
And, so your heart be set on this,
Then let whatever need arise,
And come what perils may,
Be well assured you cannot miss
God's and your Country's love to be your stay !
O. S.

TO HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE.
SIRE, while the heart of grief is not yet dumb
For him we loved, how well can scarce be said;
While still the music of the muffled drum
Rolls in the solemn requiem of the dead;
For you, on whom the instant duties lie
Which were ordained of old for Kings to bear
And may not pause for death—we lift our cry,
“God keep you in His care!”
It had to be that your first steps should fall
Within the dreadful shadow thrown across
The path you take at Destiny's high call,
Lonely alway, and lonelier by your loss;
Yet if our prayers, where Hope and Memory meet,
If loyal service laid before your throne,
Can lend you comfort and confirm your feet,
Then are you not alone.
Nay, there is set beside you, near and dear,
Your Queen and ours, the gentle, brave and wise,
Tit Consort by the claim we most revere—
Her English love of home and homely ties;
And there is that Queen-Mother, who is fain
Through bitter tears to bless your work begun ;
To whom, though King and Emperor, you remain
Just her beloved son.
Nor comes it strange to you, this realm of yours;
Your eyes have seen it, crowned with large increase,
IIave ranged the circuit of its seas and shores,
Canopied by the covering wings of Peace;
Such is the gift he guarded close for you,
Your royal Father, such his fair bequest,
Who. saw the promise of his task come true,
And so lay down to rest.
Yet may we pay for Peace too dear a price
If, lapped in confidence and careless ease,
We let the summoning need of sacrifice
Find us with sinews soft and feeble knees;
Sire, it is yours to lift the nation's life
Out of its languor ere it be too late,
And make her win from Peace that nobler strife
Which keeps a country great.
The ancient splendour falls upon your brow!
Take up your heritage with both your hands !
Call us to shake ourselves, betimes and now,
Free of the snare of slumber's silken bands!
See, we are true men still, a patriot breed;
Still to our storied, ame and fame we cling;
Give but the sign, º llow where you lead,
For G. and for the King !

[MAy 18, 1910.
ESSENCE OF
ExTRACTED FROM THE
House of Commons, Wednesday, May 11–Less than a
fortnight ago House broke up with jubilation to enjoy
a real holiday, a real four weeks' holiday in May-time.
Members hurried off by land and sea, the SPEAKER
to distant Constantinople, PRIME MINISTER (in keeping
of FIRST Lord of THE ADMIRALTY) to Gibraltar. The
rest, Ministers and private Members, scattered far and
wide over Continent and Home islands, trying not to
think of the date that would recall them to Westminster
for the grim fight with the Lords.
To day, a fortnight before the appointed term, Members
assemble. With strange silence they re-people the old
familiar scene. Everything is changed, even the motley
of work-a-day garb. The KING is dead, and the faithful
Commons have come to pay a tribute to his memory and
swear allegiance to his Son.
The universality of KING Edward's sympathies was
especially shown in connection with House of Commons.
In the stirring days and nights of the early Eighties
his gracious presence, his smiling countenance, were
familiar in the seat over the clock in the Peers' Gallery.
During times of storm and stress, on one occasion ex-
tending over a period of twenty-six hours, he was as
constant in attendance in his allotted seat as was the
SPEAKER in his Chair immediately facing him.
On an afternoon in April thirty-five years ago he
played passive part in historic scene. Accompanied by a
number of Peers whose faces were well known at Epsom
and Newmarket, he came down to hear his friend HARRY
CHAPLIN move a Resolution affecting the breed of horses.
It was a great occasion, to the height of which the then
Member for Sleaford was prepared to rise. He had
forgotten Joseph G.ILLIs BIGGAR, whom a few days earlier
he had ruffled by stately rebuke. But Joey B. remembered,
and saw his opportunity.
As soon as CHAPLIN, called by the SPEAKER, rose to
declaim a cherished oration Mr. BIGGAR “spied strangers.”
In those good old days a single Member, however
obscure, was master of the situation. The SPEAKER, tied
and bound by time-honoured ordinances, was obliged to
order strangers to withdraw. Accordingly the HEIR
APPARENT to the British Throne, the GERMAN AMBAs-
SADoR, who sat at his right elbow in the Diplomatic
Gallery, and a group of Peers representing the bluest
blood in England, withdrew at the bidding of a Member
of the lower middle classes.
H.R.H. accepted the situation with the impregnable
good humour that sweetened his long and busy life.
Another accident, personally more startling, befell His
late MAJESTY whilst yet a Peer of Parliament. In course
of debate YouNG WEMYss rose from his favourite coign
of vantage on the Second Cross Bench in House of Lords.
Commanding full view of congregation on both sides,
glowing with his own eloquence, swinging his sword arm
PARLIAMENT.
DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
about as if he were again at Bannockburn, WEMYss,
in course of driving home an argument, brought his
clenched fist down upon crown of hat of Prince of WALEs
seated immediately below and in front of him.
On another, less familiar occasion, chance was run of
similar disaster. Lord TEYNHAM, who had lately succeeded
to peerage, presented himself to make maiden speech. By
accident or design he strayed upon bench whence YouNG
WEMYss is accustomed to discourse. In the corner seat
was the Prince of WALEs. Few, if any, knew the Peer
whose plaintive voice rose from the Cross Bench. Glancing
in that direction their Lordships beheld a white-haired
gentleman with pallid face flushed by excitement of
oratory—a tall, swaying figure with peculiar habit of
occasionally turning its back upon audience and address-
ing imaginary friend in recess of Strangers' Gallery.
Among other convulsive movements the orator frequently,
with sweeping gesture, brought his hand in perilous
contiguity to the hat of utterly unconscious Royalty. At
the end of quarter-of-an-hour of painful apprehension,
disaster was averted by Motion made “that Lord TEYNHAM
be no longer heard.”
In common with other Princes of the blood royal, his
late MAJESTY never joined in debate. With one excep-
tion, he refrained from taking part in divisions. This was
found in connection with that once hardy annual,
the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill. When it came on for
Second Reading in the Lords H.R.H. frequently pre-
sented a petition in its favour, and invariably voted for it.
He lived to give his royal assent to its addition to the
Statute Book.
One other of the Peers' privileges claimed by his late
MAJESTY was that of introducing new Members. Twenty
years ago, the Earl of FIFE being elevated to a Dukedom,
his royal Father-in-law took part in the quaint procession
which accompanied his re-introduction. In this same year
the Duke of CLARENCE, taking his seat in the Lords, was
introduced by his Father and the Duke of EDINBURGH.
Three weeks ago the corner seat on the Front Cross
Bench, where through the long reign of Queen Victori A
the late KING was accustomed to sit, was occupied by his
Son. Next time the new KING appears in the House of
Lords he will take the vacant chair under the royal canopy.
For several days the Commons have been crowding
round the tables set on the floor of the House, repeating
the oath of allegiance taken as recently as January.
There is a new name inserted in the formula. Members,
momentarily undivided by political faction, know with
sorrowing hearts that King Edward, beloved by the
Commons, “will come back to Lochaber no more.”
Eloquent tributes have to-day been paid in the House to
his late Majesty; an address voted to King GEorge,
assuring him of loyalty; and a message of sympathy sent
to the QUEEN-Mother.

THE REGENERATION of CoRA MARIGoLD.
PIPPLEswick.
Mr. Samuel Pippleswick is already
a household word in two hemi-
spheres, and his new work bids fair
to extend his fame to the remaining
third. In the realm of theological
romance he has long reigned su-
preme, and his benevolent tyranny
over the minds of the cultured
million has been attended with
countless spiritual boons. Never
before has he asserted his daemonic
talent with such superlative foree
as in his new book, “The Regeneration of Cora Marigold.”
It is not only his longest but his strongest novel. Yet it
may safely be placed in the hands of the most blasé man of
the world, while no harm can possibly accrue from it to
infants of less than two years old.

ON MY TEN Toes. By UTHER PELLEAs BAggs, author
of “The Main with the Blue Chin,”
“A Sanctimonious Sinner,” “In
Quest of Crime,” etc. -
Uther Pelleas Baggs has long
been a name to conjure with, but
the magic of his genius has never
been exerted with a more potent
spell than in his latest creation, “On
My Ten Toes,” which has the fresh-
ness and fragrance of new-mown
hay. In it Mr. Baggs transports
his reader on his magic cloak from
Battersea to Benares, from Clacton-
on-Sea to Calcutta. In a word it is the work of a thorough
artist who combines the demands of poetic justice with the
relentless claims of realism, and for the reader who desires
to steal a few hours' oblivion from mundane preoccupa-
tions no better soporific can be recommended than this
bewitchingly sedative romance.

“SELF-HELP For SMILEs.” By JonAH Dolor UM, author
of “The Silly Ass,” “How to be

It has long been a commonplace
among literary men that there are
more laughs to the square inch in
Jonah Doldrum's stories than in
those of any other author living or
dead. His stories are the favourite
reading of the Ex-Sultan ABDUL
HAMID, Lady Cook (née TENNEssee
CLAFLIN) and Mr. HENNIKER HEA-
ToN, M.P., thus showing the wide
humanity of his outlook. His new
book “Self-Help for Smiles,” is one prolonged guffaw.
But the work is not all comedy “The sense of tears in
human things" occasionally emerges with poignant in-
sistence, and amid the most breezy or facetious surround.
ings we are suddenly confronted with the horrors of
elemental passion. In a word Mr. Doldrum has once more
scored a resounding and prehensile success.

THE ConquEst of Cowes. By ALFonso Diggle.
As has been justly said, what Mr. HALL CAINE is to the
Isle of Man so is Mr. Alfonso Diggle to the Isle of Wight.
His new story, “The Conquest of
Cowes,” is an account of the in-
vasion of the island in question
by a horde of Amazons from Da-
homey, and tells how it was re-
pelled by a corps of Girl Scouts.
But the book is not all carnage.
Amid the crash of arms and the
rattle of Winchester repeaters is
heard the tender pipe of sentiment,
on , which Mr. Diggle performs
with a limpid bravura which is all
his own.

“The Perfect Cure,” “No Earthly
Use,” “The Wicked Week-Enders,”
etc. -
Hilary Bardolph is already a
veteran, having no fewer than forty-
five novels to his credit. But he
preserves the ingenuous charm of
the eternal child, and his new
story, “Little Miss Mephisto,” is
* the sort of book which braces the
fibre of a nation to nobler aims
and doughtier deeds. The character
of the heroine is a wonderful study
of infrahuman cruelty. Indeed the perusal of these thrilling
pages accelerates respiration and keeps off somnolence.
Finally the book is written in good grammatical English,
with very few split infinitives, thus showing the author
to be both well educated and fastidious.
JESSICA's JAMBoree. By Joskin WAMP,
“Tiffany's Wedding,” “Angels on
Toast,” etc. - -
Among the younger generation
of penmen few have leaped to fame
with a more confident stride than
Joskin Wamp. He is the writer of
five novels, each more vivid and
vital than its predecessor. In the
fifth, “Jessica's Jamboree,” there is
a subliminal religiosity in the con-
ception of the hero which is little
short of sublime. In a word Mr.
Joskin Vamp has once more proved
--- *

himself to be a benefactor of the deepest dye.
DIANA THE SHE-DEVIL. By JULIAN DE WERE Cooney.
Mr. Cooney's new novel—like all
its predecessors, a novel with a
purpose—is designed to expose the
appalling wickedness of the fox-
hunting set. “Diana the She-Devil.”
is the charming name of his new
venture, which describes the con-
version of the Master of the Pytchley
Buckhounds from a career of un-
imaginable depravity to a life of self-
| sacrifice in the slums of Monte Carlo.
It has been well said of him by his
publisher's reader, “No writer since
Juvenal is so superbly moral as Julian de Were Cooney.”
MR. Julian de Vene Cooney.

ANOTHER TRIUM.PH
OF SCIENCE. 1910.
HERODIAs of HANGER HILL : A
GoL FING Rom ANC E. By ELSA
PoddLE.
Miss Elsa Poddle has long been
regarded as one of the most inspired
delineators of ultra-smart society.
Her new romance easily eclipses
the steepest exploits of her rivals
and will probably win for her the
sobriquet of “Casanova Rediviva.”
A Holy HoR-
RoR. By MEs.
SALINATIBBITTs, author of “A Saint
in Cerise.”
Miss Tibbitts had no reason to
complain of the reception of her
first book, “A Saint in Cerise.” Her
second venture, however, is a far
more serious undertaking, and, being
imbued with that subtle current of
magnetism which is the sign-manual
of genius, will electrify Bayswater
and titillate Pimlico.
Miss Elsa Poddle.
Miss MEssalix A Tidbitts.
CHEops AND ToMAto SAuce. By MARMIon BRUMFIT.
Mr. Marmion Brumfit has written
a superb historical romance of the
days of Cheops, under the fascin-
ating title of “Cheops and Tomato
Sauce,” and, as historical facts have
been adhered to as much as possible,
a wonderfully realistic notion is given
of the Court life of a great Pyramid-
builder, with allits splendour, ferocity
and callous disregard for human life.
Indeed Mr. Brumfit thinks that it is
the finest thing he has done since
“The Love Affairs of Cato of Utica.”
MR. MARMion BRUMF it.

That I should be potted in Eve and her Era,

[May 25, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CITIZEN'S DUTY.
“You are hereby summoned,” said
the notice, “to attend and serve as a
Juror, in this Court, at the hour of
eleven in the Forenoon upon the trial
of any Action or Actions to be then and
there tried by Jury; and in default
of attendance you will be liable to a
penalty of Five Pounds, under sect. 102
of the County Courts Act, 1888.” So
of course I went.
10.45. Though I have never been on
a Jury before, I feel that it is as well
to be punctual. Is this the County
Court, policeman? Thank you. First
come, first serve, is the juryman's
motto. If I am sworn in for the open-
ing action I may yet be down at the
Oval for lunch.
10.55. Upstairs there seem to be a lot
of jurymen about, most of them without
collars; I wish I knew the etiquette.
And where do I go now 2 Perhaps if I
show somebody my summons . . . In
there? Thank you very much . . .
Oh, is this the dock 2 Thank you.
Oh, yes, over there. Thanks.
11. In the jury box. Evidently I am
very late. We are in the middle of the
action, and I haven't taken an oath of
any kind. I ask the juryman next to me
for a rough synopsis or résumé of the
case as far as it has gone, so that I can
give a right and trusty verdict. He
explains that our action hasn't begun
yet, and that this one is being tried
without jury. Most sensible—that 's
how all actions should be tried.
Having nothing else to do I listen to
counsel. As far as I can make it out,
“We” (by which, I take it, the littleman
in the wig means himself and his friends)
have been unable to obtain reasonable
access to the bathroom of our lodgings
for the purposes of bathing, the land-
lady having pocketed the key of the
same. No wonder we are annoyed.
On the other hand, as the fat man in
fancy dress rightly points out, “We’”
(meaning him and the landlady) have
only locked the door between the hours
of 11 A.M. and 8 P.M., the fact being
that his learned friend was in the habit
of washing his clothes in the bathroom.
(Disgraceful.) We are only too de-
lighted to allow him to bathe in the
morning and at night, but it must be
fair bathing.
His Honour thinks this reasonable.
The Little Man says he will undertake
not to wash his clothes in the bathroom;
but suppose he wanted a warm bath in
the afternoon 2
His Honour thinks that any reason-
able man or woman might want a warm
bath in the afternoon—say between
three and four.
The Fat Man says that if his learned
friend really wants a warm bath in
the afternoon, say between three and
four, he is prepared to allow access to
the room for that hour.
His Honour thinks this noble.
The Little Man urges that he might
possibly want his bath at five. (True.)
After much argument His Honour
suggests 4.30 as a reasonable com-
promise. Agreed that the Little Man
shall be allowed to bathe from 8 P.M.
to 11 A.M. and from 3 P.M. to 4.30 P.M.
Now for our action.
11.45. We stand up in twos to take
the oath. Having read all about germs
I decide to kiss my thumb, instead of
the book which I and the man next
to me are holding together. In m
nervousness, however, I kiss the other
man's thumb. I hope he won't mind.
Before our case begins the usher
announces that all the other actions
have been settled out of court and that
the rest of the jurors summoned are
therefore dismissed. This is very
annoying. If I had only come late
enough I needn't have come at all.
And they're just beginning at the Oval.
12.0. Matthew Pringle kept a small
fishmonger's shop in Commercial Road.
One day he was horrified, gentlemen,
to see a motor car come into the shop.
A week later, having recovered from
the shock to his system, he estimated
the damage as follows:
Damage to shop . . . . £2
Do. to fish . . . .
Do. to bicycle (which was
leaning against shop).
Loss of business
:
:
:
Total £30 0 0
I make a note of the figures and
yawn, and wonder what on earth the
defence can be.
12.45. Counsel for Defence is cross-
examining. Roughly his line seems to
be that the damage to shop was
fourpence, damage to fish tuppence,
damage to bicycle an improvement,
and loss of business nil.
“Now take , the fish,” he says.
“What sort of fish had you in the
shop? Had you salmon?”
Mr. Pringle admits that he had no
salmon.
“No salmon, gentlemen,” Counsel
says to us scornfully.
It occurs to me that salmon was out
of season at the time of the accident,
but as it doesn't seem to occur to
anybody else I say nothing.
Counsel continues. Under relent-
less cross-examination witness con-
fesses that he had also no sturgeon,
red mullet, trout, octopuses, whales,
sardines, or dog-fish in his shop at the
time of the accident.
“Well, what had you got?” asks
Counsel, absolutely at a loss.
“There was kippers and
“Kippers' " sneers the Defence.
Having had a couple of kippers for
breakfast that very morning, I resent
the sneer and decide to give a verdict H.
for the plaintiff.
2:30. We have adjourned for lunch
and resumed, and are still at it. I
expected to be locked up and given
lunch at the expense of the county, but ||
had to go out and pay for it in the
usual way. The Defence is now con-
centrating on the bicycle, which is in
court. Counsel is prepared to admit
that it is a bicycle, but produces an
engineering expert (without a collar) to
tell the whole truth about its past.
“You see that—bicycle 3 '' Counsel
says contemptuously, as if it had had no
right ever to have been a bicycle. Cer-
tainly it doesn't look much like one
now.
“I do.”
“And for how much would you be
prepared to mend it 2."
“'Arf-a-crown.” (Sensation.) “And
I'd give 'im a new one as good as
that was for five shillings.” (More
sensation.)
3.30. The man next to me is very
conscientious. He has been putting
down all the figures in the case. As I
feel that I have been ratherinattentive,
I ask him to let me refresh my memory
by studying them. After all, I have
kissed his thumb, so we are not alto-
gether strangers.
He has added them all up so as to
save me bother.
Fish in shop . - - - . 250
Breadth of road at scene of accident 27ft.
Gear of bicycle
Average cost of kipper ; : . 1d.
Number of motor . LC 97896
Train I want to catch 46p.m.
Total damage . LC 98262.6 ftdpm.
“Thanks very much,” I said, “but I
doubt if you catch your train.”
4.15. We retire. We are all very in-
dignant. One stout bald man explains
that he was going to have been married
or christened or something this after-
noon, and now he has missed it. He
must try again to-morrow. We are
all agreed that it is perfectly wicked
that a whole day should be wasted in
this manner. We are all busy men. I
am (I say) a particularly busy man.
“Plaintiff, of course?” says the bald
man casually. Of course. “Damages?
He claims thirty—say twenty-five 2"
Our confidence in the bicycle being a
little shaken, we all say twenty-five
with alacrity.
4.30. Justice is done.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARf.
“T. P.” AMONG THE POETS.
THE gentleman who dispenses “Lite-
rary Help” in T. P.'s Weekly was
recently asked by “B. (York)” to criti-
cise an original musical setting of
Canto cxxx. of “In Memoriam.” By
a stroke of superb luck the poet's
name was omitted from the score, with
the following captivating result:—
“I do not know whether the verses are
original, but I have been wondering what the
song is all about. The song says 'I cannot
Suess,' and I am inclined to agree. I do not
catch the meaning of ‘Though mix'd with God
and nature thou,' and there is apparently a
syllable missing in the line ‘I have thee and I
rejo.ce' at the foot of page 4.” -
It is when our Literary Helpers thus
fail us—and delight us—that we realise
that we have not lived in vain. The
missing syllable, by-the-by, is “still.”
Perhaps the critic will turn to his
Tennyson, and, applying a wet towel to
his head, try to get a glimmering of
the crystal meaning of four of the most
beautiful stanzas ever written.
Meanwhile we shall look confidently
in our T. P. for the following:—
H. (Lincoln). —Your blank verse is
undoubtedly blank. Let me tell you
once for all that to invert the true
order of words is not poetry, though
too many tyros think it is. You
begin –
“Of Man's first disobedience and the fruit
Of tha' forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Broºght death into the world and all our
woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us and regain the blissful seat,
Sing, heavenly muse . . .”
Now, there are two glaring faults here.
One is to begin with a preposition,
which no good writer would do, and
the other to be so long in coming to
the point. The point is that the
heavenly muse is invoked to sing of all
these things; but if you count the
words before we arrive at that invitation
you will see that there are thirty-eight.
How much better to have begun,
“Sing, heavenly muse,” and so forth.
M. H. (Brighton).-Your lines are
not altogether bad. I like the descrip-
tion of the marigold as going to bed
with the sun ; it is pretty and poetical.
And the epithet “bold" for oxlips is
good, and “pale '' for primroses—un-
doubtedly they are pale.
“Violets, dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes”
is far-fetched; but there is a certain
courage in it. But what to make of
“Daffodils
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty,”
I cannot think. What does “take”
mean? Surely it is a misprint, but I
cannot imagine for what. How can
you take a wind with beauty 2 You
can take a walk, you can take a cup of
tea, you can take cold ; but how can
you take a wind with beauty 2 This
is, of course, if not a misprint, sheer
affectation, and I advise you to dis-
continue it.
Lastly you write:
“Beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
And death's pale flag is not advanced there,”
This will never do. “Ensign" is far
too technical : “ banner'’ would be
better. Then “crimson '' is a crude
and violent word. The last line doesn't
scan. Besides, you don't “advance" a
flag; you hoist it.
TERMINOL0ſ:IGAL EXAGTITUDE.
[Witness. “He is under the L.C.C.”
Judge Bacon. “What is that ?”
Witness. “The London County Council.”
Fragment from a case in the Whitechapel
County Court.]
So different from the elder BAcon
Whose cryptograms were horrid hard
(And thus his verses got mistaken
For those of BILL–a minor bard),
The namesake of that nimble beak
Repudiates the verbal freak,
He will not have the language shaken,
The wells of English marred.
To him abbreviated titles
Are crude as crimson to a bull,
He stipulates for long recitals
Because they are so beautiful;
The nom de guerre or name for short
Annoys him like a legal tort;
Contractions corrugate his vitals
And nicknames warp his wool.
Suppose a felon, forced by famine
To pilfer crumpets for his tea,
Were brought before him to examine,
How pained his gentle heart would be
To hear that solecistic use,
Whereby, in circles sadly loose,
A shop for eating bread and jam in
Is called an A.B.C.
Where other men would come a cropper
By asking how to reach the Zoo,
He'd buttonhole the nearest copper
And bid him state a case (or two)
On travelling by the Underground
To Regent's Park (the Northward
bound),
And bridle (as is only proper)
At words like Bakerloo.
Then, England, while you have such
judges
The toupet and the robe to don,
Whoever fakes, whoever fudges, --
The law shall not be put upon ;
'Tis men like these in every sphere
Who still uphold by acts sincere
The British flag that never budges,
The glorious Union John.

A VISIT TO MR. PUNCH'S FARM.
WE feel bound to say that of all our
adventures in the wider journalism—
and we have gone pretty far afield at
times—none has been crowned with so
conspicuous a success as the sporting
enterprise of Mr. Punch's Farm. Nothing
has pleased us so much as the triumph
of our now famous fifteen acres. It is
no small achievement to have revolution-
ised British agriculture—as we claim to
have done—in the course of a couple of
years; and you can have no idea how
jolly it is to feel that we are landed pro-
prietors. There is always a pleasant
stir and bustle in the office when rent-
day comes round.
But the farm has proved its value—
quite incidentally, you will understand
– in yet another way. And this is the
beauty of it. It furnishes us with a
continuous supply of first-class copy.
Of course we feel some compunction
in exploiting the farm in this manner.
But what would you have? We cannot
bring ourselves to disappoint the burning
curiosity of our readers. Nothing goes
º so well as a little column of accounts.
ur readers love to know the cost of the
garden rake, and to deduct it from the
price that was obtained for the Brussels
sprouts. They discuss all the bearings
of the fact that sixpence each is allowed
for empty superphosphate bags, if re-
turned in good condition. It is our
claim—and we are justly proud of it—
that our fifteen acres provide food not
only for the body but for the mind.
Last Tuesday our representative
dropped in quite unexpectedly. He has
lodgings in the village, as we found
this cheaper and more satisſactory than
always paying for railway tickets. He
remarked, to his surprise, that it was
washing day, and noted the fact, of
obvious interest to all small holders,
that the amount of soap used for the
wash should depend not so much on the
heat of the water as on the number of
the clothes. In spite of the bustle inci-
dental upon this weekly festival there
were already several visitors on the
premises. Our cattle expert was measur-
ing the new calf with a tape, and a
high official of the Beekeepers' Associa-
tion might be seen delicately skirmishing
round the hive with what looked like a
toasting-fork. The Simple-Life reporter
was knocking off a poem under the
apple tree, and a market-gardener,
specially imported from Holland, was
grubbing about with a note-book in the
potato-patch. Our tenant's wife com-
plained of being short-handed, as one
of the photographers had turned up ||
without an appointment, and the chil-
dren were being taken in a group round
the pump. While I was waiting, writes
our representative, a parcel arrived from

the station which proved to be a new
handle for the turnip-cutter. You will
remember that I pointed out in my last
report that a flaw had been discovered
in the old one, and anticipated that
some steps would have to be taken
shortly.
Our tenant was at last discovered
watering the honeysuckle at the gate.
“Hullo!” he remarked. “Here we are
again.”
“Yes,” said I. “Anything new 2°
“Sparrer's nest in the water-spout,”
he replied without looking up ; “put
it down.”
Taking a note of this new instance of
the alarming increase of the sparrow
pest in rural England, I proceeded to
put a few leading questions to our
tenant, according to my custom.
“Do you really think that we have
succeeded in proving to the world at
large that old pasture is not necessary
for cows, or is it all spoof?”
Our tenant grinned.
“It must be a satisfaction to you that
the accounts continue to show a balance
on the right side.”
Our tenant winked.
We were interrupted at this point by
the arrival of the poultry expert with
his egg-testing apparatus. Our tenant
flung down his watering-can and picked
up his coat, and I had only time for a
final question.
“What do you intend to do at the
termination of your lease?”
“I’m looking out,” he replied firmly
and calmly, “for a bit o' land on a
desert island.”
Answer to Correspondent.
“DISTRICT PASSENGER.”—You com-
plain that “neither of the platforms at
Earl's Court station—that most popular
of junctions—contains a single time-
table of the Wimbledon service.” We
think you are hard to please. The
Directors have very generously studied
the convenience of passengers : they
have provided them with two tobacco- |
shops, and a quarter of a dozen estab-
lishments for the sale of nougat, and
you have no right to expect more than
this from any railway company.

IT's oh, but I'm dreaming
Of grey water streaming,
Great rivers that go gleaming
Where brown the heather blows,
Ere May's southern graces
Rub out the last white traces
From high and mountain places
Of stubborn, storm-packed snows!
The chill wind that searches
The low-lying birches,
The old red grouse that perches
And swaggers in the sun,
I'm fain for its blowing, . . .
I'm restless for his crowing,
And it's I that would be going
Where the Spring salmon run
And oh, were they bulking
Bright silver, or sulking—
In the snow-broth a-skulking,
I would care not at all,
I'd hear the falls ringing,
I'd see the pine-tops swinging
In a wind that's filled with singing
When the green plover call ! .

AN ADDED TERROR.
. A prominent Motoring journal announces that the touring department of the R. A. C. is arranging a scheme to supply motorists in
touring centres such as Cornwall, etc., with guides well acquainted with the local objects of interest.
Tourists IN THE Districts MENTioned—Especially DRIVERs – HAVE Mr. PUNCH's sympathy.
THE JOKE WITHOUT A POINT.
The RE was once a Joke. And the
point of it was that it had no point; so
that everybody could see it as well as
his neighbour.
It was hatched by a Cynic with an
established reputation for saying funny
things. But the Cynic was furious with
the world because it refused to take him
seriously, regarding him as a Humorist
and not as a Philosopher. So he deter-
mined to have his revenge, and hatched
the Joke.
He let it loose upon the Town at a
frigidly calculated moment, and it was
received uproariously. It went the
round of the Clubs, and no dinner-party
was complete without it. After a time
not to have heard it was to argue oneself
on the wrong side of the Fringe. People
were now more convinced than ever that
the Cynic was a prince of Humorists;
but the Cynic only laughed in his sleeve,
now the left and now the right; which
was bad for the fit of his clothes.
At the summit of its success it was
told to a young Colonial at one of the
greatest gatherings of the Season. It
was told to him within the hearing of a
galaxy of distinguished men and women.
They had all heard it before, and they
now crowded round to see how the new
arrival would take it. In anticipation of
an accident, a young doctor was in
attendance; many were prepared to
see the Colonial leave the room on an
ambulance.
But a strange thing happened. Not
only did he fail to see the Joke, but he
said so.
They told it him again and again, and
still he didn't see it. He even asked
them to explain it to him. Gently and
with due consideration for his Colonial
disabilities they explained that it was
one of those Jokes that could not be
explained; you either saw it or you
didn't. “But what is there to see ?” he
asked.
They could not answer that, and they
gazed at one another in embarrassment.
Then one of them, whether stricken in
his conscience or out of pure courtesy,
confessed that he never had seen any-
thing in it; and several others reluct-
antly testified to the same effect. To
clear the matter up it was resolved to
send a deputation to the Cynic. A
select few of the bolder spirits waited
upon him in the small hours of the
morning and stated their case. The
Cynic regarded them with a malevolent
smile, and slowly answered :-
“The point of it was that it had no
point. I made it like that on purpose.
The Joke was mine. Good night.”
The Cynic achieved part at least of
his desire, for he ceased to be accepted
as a Humorist. But when he found
that he was no longer received in the
best houses his philosophic stock-in-
trade dwindled to nothing. So he be-
came merely a Cynic; which is a dog's
life.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“CHAINS.”
I HAD always kept a warm corner of
sympathy in my selfish heart for the
dull routine of those who drag out their
lives on office stools in the City. I
had imagined that
“The noisy laugh
And ill-bred chaff
Of clerks on omnibuses”
was only a brave bluff designed to veil
the thwarted ambition of adventurous
souls. But I was wrong and my sym-
pathy wasted; for I gather from
ELIZABETH BAKER's play that these poor
slaves actually hug their “chains.”
You cannot persuade them to throw
up a safe thing for the risk
of enterprise in the open.
Anyhow, the dashing in-
trepidity of Fred Tennant,
who is resolved to break
loose and try Australia,
seems to have staggered his
fellow-clerks. “Have you
heard about Tennant's new
departure?” says someone.
“What, is he going to be
married?” they all cry, con-
ceiving of nothing else that
could be expected to cause
a convulsion in his ordered
existence. When the thril-
ling truth comes out, they
are divided in opinion;
some holding him to be a
madman, others a hero; but
all agreeing that he is
something hors ligne. Only
one of his fellows, Charlie
Wilson, is so bitten by his
example that he is determined
to follow it; but he is
married, and this is another
and more deadly “chain.”
All his wife's family, with a
single exception, support her
tears and regard him as an
unfeeling brute. So the thing must
be done secretly. He will make a
show of starting for the office, and
join Tennant's ship at Plymouth.
Then comes a stroke of force majeure;
his wife announces that he is about
to be a father. The blow goes home, and
he sallies forth to his toil, in silk hat and
frock coat, a doomed man, destined to
wear his “chains" for ever and ever.
I am not sure that I much care for
this intervention of fate; but I cordially
admire the author's courage in employ-
ing it for the further confusion of
her original text. There are chains
which are the handiwork of society,
and there are those which are nature's,
but it seems a mistake to confound the
two kinds in one and the same homily.
For the argument seems to be that
Charlie Wilson... ... ... ...
Alfred Massey (father-in-law)
Mrs. Massey (mother-in-law) ...
Lily Wilson (wife) ...
the deliverance of his soul is stiffish
work for a clerk without complica-
tions; for a married clerk it is appre-
ciably harder; for a clerk who is not
only married but lies under the threat
of fatherhood it is hopeless. There
may be a moral in all this, but it looks
bad for the census.
However, moral or no moral, Miss
BAKER has handled her milieu with
an extraordinary sense of reality, to
which the whole cast most loyally
responded. It was not to be antici-
pated that a middle-class suburban
atmosphere, properly unrelieved by
farce, should afford much scope for
humour; and the audience greedily
seized on what spasmodic fun there

was. I could wish that this had not
included the apparent attempt to raise
a laugh over the singing of “Abide with
Me,” a hymn which mustatany time, and
especially now, have its sacred associa-
tions. One other particular flaw I have
to find in an excellent play. It was Lily
Wilson's method of informing her hus-
band that a child was to be born to
them. It took one back to John
Halifar, Gentleman and the false shame
of mid-Victorian times. Surely we are
clean-minded enough by now to treat
such matters, even in fiction and on
the stage, with the frankness which
nature demands and the decencies of
actual life approve.
I suppose that, like that other

faintly recalled to me, Chains was
designed to show the need of medicine
for a social evil. But, once again, no
good prescription was vouchsafed.
There was little to show that the
Colonial experiment, even if it was to be
crowned with success, would entail less
chain-work in the process. And there
is much to be said for the conten-
tion that a bird in the hand is worth
two in the Australian Bush. What was
needed was not so much a plea for
emigration as a demand for more colour
and broader intellectual ideals in
the hum-drum, third-rate existence
which this play so admirably repro
duces. -

If Miss BAKER had it on her
chest to present us with the
social problem of clerkhood,
she might have claimed our
better gratitude by suggesting
a remedy that should begin'

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE ought to be a statutory limit to the competence
of heroes. Raimbaut of Vacqueiras was the most inspired
and sweetest-voiced troubadour of his contemporary
Provence; that much is permissible. He was also the
most handsome youth of his time; that, too, may be for-
given him. He was a knight infallible and invincible in
the joust; here is matter for complaint. He was further
a model of chaste demeanour, not to be led astray by
amorous châtelaines, proof against the open offers of
Bellisenda, most attractive of them all; the thing is be-
coming intolerable. Add to all this the last remaining virtue
of modesty, intense almost to the point of oppressiveness,
and you have a grave public scandal, a crying need for a
redistribution of merits. For the rest, I found The Severed
Mantle (METHUEN) a charming book. Its plot, based on
the paragon's search for the perfect love, is too vague to
summarise, and not sufficiently memorable to reproduce
in extenso. The author in his preface as good as confesses
that he thinks little better of it than I. What we both
like so much is its theme. “I have tried,” says
WILLIAM LINDSEY, “to picture Provence in the time of the
troubadours, to show the land of the nightingale and rose
when Idealism reigned supreme, with Love, Joy and Song
her counsellors.” He has succeeded, say I. Indeed, he
carried me body and soul into France and Italy of the
twelfth century, and left me thinking of Avignon and
Ventimiglia as homes of music, the tourney and romance,
instead of tiresome stations where officials wake me up to
demand my ticket or my keys.
Many books have been written recalling pilgrimages in
the footsteps of CHARLEs. DICKENs and some of his immortal
creations. In Rambles with an American (MILLS AND
BooN) CHRISTIAN TEARLE has achieved the distinction
of producing one of the worst. Had he been content
to tread the old familiar ways, more or less modestly
describing his impressions, it would have been exacting to
expect anything new ; but the book might have been
devoid of irritation. Mr. TEARLE invents the machinery
of a pert, self-satisfied London solicitor and a client from
Chicago, “whose countenance, though remotely suggestive
of the Red Indian type, was refined and gracious; his
more than fifty winters have dried him up rather than
aged him, and his tall form was spare and willowy.” This
person, who apparently cannot be described in a single
tense, is in the habit of producing from his waistcoat
pocket a sheaf of notes containing extracts from ForstER's
Life of Dickens and other accessible works. With this in

T
hand the couple visit Hatton Garden, the Marshalsea, and
other quarters of London associated with DICKENs. When
they come to appropriate spots the client pulls out the
sheaf of notes and reads an extract, and the solicitor makes
humorous and penetrating remarks. “‘Richard and Francis
Lovelace were both colonels,' said the American. “Only
two colonels' 'I exclaimed with much sympathy. “Dear,
dear." Good patriot though he was, a gleam of amuse-
ment sparkled in his eye.” Well, it doesn't in mine. Nor
does one beam in looking through other chapters dealing
in the same airy fashion with SHAKSPEARE at Stratford-
on-Avon, GoLDSMITH in Green Arbour Court, and Scott at
Abbotsford.
Mr. CHARLEs PEARs, known to the world as a delightful
artist, is also a sailorman of high skill, resource, and courage.
He owns a yacht “of registered tonnage 2.65, and of yacht
measurement 4 tons—which means that she was 26 feet long

Mr. PEARs' account of his doings and of the admir-
able behaviour of his little yacht is a direct and
graphic piece of work, breezy and briny as such an
account should be. To be sure, he is occasionally, shall
I say, a little impressionist in his dealings with French
genders, but, on the other hand, his eye for colour is
unfailing, and his renderings of the beauty he saw on sea
and land are amongst the most brilliant and fascinating
things ever done in this kind. Indeed, Mr. PEARs is an
artist enragé—I use the word in a sense as highly compli-
mentary as it can be made to bear. When he was suffer-
ing tortures from a toothache at Abbeville and was hunting
elusive dentists through the streets of that city, he could
stop in his vain and maddening chase in order that he
might contemplate and admire and sketch the beauty of
the Somme Canal, “a weird view of sombre still water
reflecting gloomy trees, a mysterious bank upon either
hand, and a few gas-lights . . . Looking into the water
below it seemed as deep as the sky is high.”
I congratulate Mr. PEARs on his yacht, his pluck, and
his book.

justice to a style of which the quaint irrelevancies and

not perfectly sure, though, that towards the end Mr.
THURSTON has not permitted that same playſul charm to run
away with him for some little distance, to the extent, indeed,
of giving possible offence to those for whom matters of

AN APPEAL.
THE following Round Robin has, we
understand, been received at Bow

To the Magistrate, Bow Street.
DEAR SIR,-We the undersigned Old
Offenders have a request to make,
which we trust you will consider in the
spirit in which it is proffered. For some
years past we have been in the habit
of riding from Bow Street to Holloway
and other places in Black Maria, as
every self-respecting lawbreaker must
——, be prepared to do some day or
other; and the police and gaol
attendants will bear us out when
we say that we have done our
best to be cheerful on the ride
and have behaved ourselves like
gentlemen and ladies.
But, Sir, although we are
prepared to go on doing our best,
we think the time has come for
a change. Look at the progress of
science all around us. Look at
the aeroplanes flying the Chan-
nel and the Marconi wireless
system; look at the cinemato-
scope and colour photography.
Most of all, look at the im-
provements in traction; which
brings us to our point, and that
is, as we humbly submit, that
the moment has arrived for Bow
Street to fall into line with other
high-class establishments and
substitute petrol for horses. In
other words, what we want and
what we believe we are entitled
to have, is a motor Black Maria.
The advantages are easily
enumerated and are all on your
side—
(1) We should get there
quicker.
(2) In busy times one engine
would cost less than two horses.
the buildings in the Japanese
Willage at Shepherd's Bush have been
greatly admired by lady visitors. There
are dreadful rumours that a few smart
people have bought options on them

Professor. On the contrary, we remark
with satisfaction the modern growth of

any ridicule in a noble cause.
“Miss Emily Brown,” we read in
one of our well-informed newspapers,

was nothing doing, the engine would
not be eating its head off.

more rapidly we should have more time
in prison. We do not want more time
in prison, but we are proud of Bow
Street and jealous of its good name,
and we don't like to see it lagging
behind like this.

TO MY LADY ROSEMARY.
[NotE.--Rosemary, from ros marinus, dew of
the sea. The name is here used to signify
the Unseizable, though the author admits that
he has not had an opportunity of consulting
the famous specialist, M. MAETERLINCK, as to
the propriety of this symbol.]
MY Rosemary, or sea-dew
(Observe the note above),
How very much I need you
When I indite of love
You are to me a mental prop,
A sort of guiding star,
And, but for you, my brain would drop
Some distance under par.
Precisely as the tom-tit
(I take a simple type),
Without a theme to prompt it,
Neglects to tune his pipe,
So it would be with this poor breast;
Without you, I should hush
My twittering larynx, or, at best,
Throw off the saddest slush.
Yours are the feet I follow ;
Your beauty, none but yours,
Can fill, in me, the hollow
That Nature so abhors;
And, if to other lips and eyes
I turn a rhyme or two
For courtesy or exercise,
I mean it all for you.
Some women I could mention
Might easily have erred,
Misreading my intention,
Taking me at my word;
But you, thank Heaven, are not of such,
Not of their foolish brand
Who miss the light Platonic touch,
And never understand.
I speak as if I knew you,
But that is not the case;
Merely my thoughts pursue you
Content with just the chase;
I may not realise my dream,
Not in this tearful Vale,
But anyhow I have a Theme
Wher other topics fail.
Unlike the sailor's Nancy
Palpable on the quay,
You flit through realms of fancy,
Dew of a fairy sea ;
And I may safely sing and sing
Yoºr charms that cannot pall,
Bect...ce ve: are The Perfect Thing,
Ana ſo, t eat, at all !
O. S.
Conscription.
We draw the attention of middle-aged
spinsters to the cheering statement of
a witness before the Divorce Com-
mission that “he would make it com-
pulsory for everybody to be married at
a registry office.”
THE TARIFF THAT WAS REFORMED.
THERE was once (there was indeed
a Commercial Traveller who believe
some things (not, of course, all) that he
was told. There was also a Firm which,
because it was an American firm, was
the Greatest Ready-made Clothes Firm
in the world. The beautiful suits, which
the Firm sold wholesale to the retail
tradesmen, were eventually bought
by lucky and grateful individuals at
20 dollars apiece. Sometimes there
was a discount for cash, but that dis-
count was always small even for a
discount, and as often as not a little
bit was added on to the price before
the little bit was knocked off. In the
end the individual paid his 20 dollars,
whether he knew it or not, and his
friends, relations, female admirers, and
business acquaintances never failed to
hazard a guess that that suit was a very,
very beautiful suit and darned cheap at
the price.
The Firm sent the Traveller forth to
book orders, warning him that the
retailers were a rapacious class and
that the suits could not be made with
profit at less than 15 dollars. That
price was to be the minimum he should
accept in booking orders. There need
be no maximum. Thus instructed, the
Traveller set forth and, after some
negotiations of a minor sort, he came
to a Big City, where he was offered an
order for 500 suits at 14 dollars apiece.
“Your offer,” he said, “is an absurd
one. It leaves no margin of profit for
the firm.” Nevertheless, after a long
argument, consisting of false deduc-
tions from inaccurate facts, he was per-
suaded to wire to his Firm. The Firm
wired back, not after the manner of
men incurring a heavy loss, “Accept
offer.”
At the next Big City he was offered
an order for 700 suits at 13 dollars
apiece. “We may,” he said, “sell
suits at cost price, but we are not
philanthropists.” Yet, upon wiring for
instructions, he was again told to accept,
and no mention made of philanthropy.
And so, as he passed from Big City to
Bigger City, the price fell from 13 to
12, from 12 to 11, and from 11 to 10
dollars, and all the while his private
letters from home continued to refer
to the Members of the Firm as pros-
perous, well-dressed, overfed men, very
happy and given to continuous smiling.
Finally, when in the Biggest City of
all he received instructions (unaccom-
panied by foul language or even mild
complaint) to accept an order for
1,000 suits at 8 dollars apiece, he walked
out into the street in a mizmaze and
was run over by a car.
The hospital doctors said his case
was hopeless and asked him if he had
any last wish he would like to mention,
supposing that he might have some
domestic affair with which he would
like them to deal. “Wire to the Firm,”
said the Traveller, “and ask them to
tell a dying man, who won't give the
show away, what is the lowest price
they really would take for those there
twenty-dollar suitings.” -

[Halley's Comet has proved a bitter disappointment. All that could
be seen of it in most parts of the world was an insignificant object,
fainter than an ordinary star, surrounded by a slight filmy haze.]
CELESTIAL vagabond, you've come at last,
Preceded by long columns of advertisement
That told us, pointing to your lurid past,
That by your visit some unlooked-for hurt is meant.
We took your splendours willingly on trust,
And read religiously those chatty articles
In which expectant scientists discussed
The composition of your caudal particles.
And now we've seen you in the flesh; but, oh,
The bitter tale of Time's relentless ravages!
Candidly speaking, Sir, your present show
Should not alarm the most untaught of savages.
Where is that fiery “dagger in the sky"
That could so thrill the ancients and bamboozle 'em,
That once (unless the annal-mongers lie)
Spoke far from comfortably to Jerusalem 2
Where is that blaze that hovered o'er the ship
Of Conquering BILL when, gazing at the heavens, he
Discerned a helpful omen for the trip
That landed him one fateful morn at Pevensey?
Must we believe that you are getting old
And past your work? Or have you been meandering,
Since last we saw you, in some amorous fold,
With countless bright-eyed planet-loves philandering?
Or, dallying in some Rum-and-Milky Way,
Or where the Three Stars make one chronic night of it,
Have you come staggering from the festal fray
Back to the Sun, but blinking at the sight of it?
Go, seek some skilled physician of the skies
And tell him what an awful state your head is in ;
Show him your furry tongue, your bleary eyes,
And drain a brimming bumper of his medicine.
Then do another seventy-five years' slope;
And when your health is in its normal state—if I've
The fortune to be living still—I hope
To see you quite yourself in 1985.

GOSSIP OF THE WEEK.
“WE live in stirring times,” said
Charles as he folded up his paper.
“Roosevel.T has received a degree at
Cambridge * >
“That's nothing. So have I,” inter-
rupted Algernon.
“Edwardes Square is in a state of
siege, Northamptonshire has made a
record score of three hundred, and The
Daily Mail publishes a special article
urging the young men of England to
emigrate.”
“Is it called ‘The Flight from Free
Trade '2" asked Algernon innocently.
“That was last week—how very old-
fashioned you are, Algernon. By the
way, do you realise that there must
have been a meeting at Cambridge
yesterday as noteworthy as that be-
tween LIVINGSTONE and STANLEY, and
that the papers say nothing about it 2."
“I remember when I met my credi-
tors for the first time x *
“I refer to the historic meeting
between Colonel THEODORE RoosevelT
and Mr. A. C. BENson. What volumes
they must have had to impart to each
other after all these years' What a
comparing of copy-books! How very,
very plain the obvious must have
become after they had thrashed it out
together "
“It reminds me of my efforts to
bring HENRY JAMEs and BART KENNEDY
together,” said Algernon. “I wanted
them to collaborate in a novel, but
there was a little difficulty. HENRY
suggested that they should write alter-
nate sentences, but BARTHoLoMEw
thought that he ought to be allowed
thirty-eight to every one of HENRY's.
So it fell through.”
“I always suspect BART of being
Bradshaw, and JAMEs of drawing up
leases and things for solicitors; but I
may be wrong.”
“Of course,” said Algernon magnani-
mously, “it’s very easy to rag Roose-
VFLT, but if one goes about making
speeches all over the world one can't
say anything very new each time.”
“On the other hand, it is quite possible
only to make one speech, and yet for
that one to be very old.”
“I suppose I've got to hear about
it,” said Algernon resignedly.
| “You have. It was at my private
school. We had what was called an
Impromptu Debate; each boy in turn
drew a subject out of a hat and ad-
dressed the school upon it.”
“Upon the hat?”
“Upon the subject. I drew ‘Gym-
nastics,' and stood up absolutely speech-
less ; until the boy next to me, who
thought he knew what ‘Im-prompt-u’
meant, well, he – er — whispered
to me, “Gymnastics strengthens the
muscles.’ So I said very distinctly,
“Gymnathticth thbrengthenth themuth-
leth,' and sat down with the air of one
who has disposed of the question.”
“How interesting. Did they give
you one good mark for neatness?”
“I’m not quite sure. I rather fancy
the whole school had potted meat for
tea . . . . I did tell you, didn't I, that

“I wish I lived in Edwardes Square,”
sighed Charles. “Or Marloes Road, or
near the Mayor, or absolutely anywhere
within a walk of Edwardes Square. Oh,
how I'd stare and stare and stare!”
“It's very rude to stare,” said
Algernon. “But your little song re-
minds me of something. I don't know
if you ever happen to talk about me to
any of our friends * x
“Never. I think
them.”
“Well, if my name should happen
to come up—”
“It's all right, we should laugh it
off somehow.”
“I wish you'd say that when you
first knew me I had a house in Edwardes
Square. Because I’ve been telling
everybody that I used to live there. I
find it gives one a sort of position.”
“Is that quite as true as—as some
of the things you say?”
“It isn't a question of truth, but a
question of manners. You know that
story of you and Lord RoseBERY 2’
“You mean that one about the
pheasant, when he and I * x
“Yes. Well, whenever I tell that
story I always tell it as of me and
Lord Rose BERY. It seems such im-
pertinence to drag your name into a
story told to somebody who has never
seen you and has expressed no desire
to hear about you. I can't insist on
introducing my stray friends to every-
body I meet.”
“I may be your friend, though I
shall have to re-consider the matter
seriously after what you have just told
me; but I am certainly not stray.
And anyhow, what have these dredgings
from the past got to do with Edwardes
Square?”
“Why,” said Algernon, “there is
such an intimate note about the little
stories of the Square which I tell, that
they can only be assigned to some
it would bore
resident who knows every stone and
blade and leaf in the place. And, as I
object to dragging an absolute stranger
into a private conversation for no better
reason than that he lives at Edwardes
Square, I have to assign them to my-
Self.”
“Overcome as I am by your con-
fession,” said Charles, “I have still
strength left to ask you, who is the
resident at Edwardes Square whose
stories you are stealing 2" -
“In this case,” said Algernon, “no-
body; I make them all up myself.”

THE EOUALISER.
I was struck by his crafty little face
and the interest which he showed in
my friend's conversation. My friend
was talking about the difficulty of
getting level with life: with the people
who charge too much, and with bad
management generally; the subject
having been started by a long wait
outside the junction, which made our
train half-an-hour late.
“How,” my friend had said, “are we
ever going to get back the value of this
half-hour? My time is worth two
guineas an hour; and I have now lost
a guinea. How am I to be recouped 2
The railway company takes my money
for a train which they say will do the
journey between 11.15 and 12.6, and I
make my plans accordingly. It does
not get in till 12.36, and all my plans
are thrown out. Is it fair that I am
not recompensed ? Of course not.
They have robbed me. How am I to
get equal with them 2 ”
So he rattled on, and the little cun-
ning eyes opposite us became more
cunning and glittering.
After my friend had left, the little
man spoke to me.
“Why didn't he take something 2"
he asked.
“What do you mean 2" I said.
“Something from the carriage, to
help to make up 2" he said. “The
window-strap for a strop, for instance?
It's not worth a guinea, of course, but
it's something, and it would annoy the
company.”
“But he wasn't as serious as that,”
I said.
“Oh, he's one of them that talks but
doesn't act. I've no patience with
them. I always get some, if not all,
of my money back.”
“How 2 ” I asked.
“Well, suppose it's a restaurant,
where I have to wait a long time and
then get only poor food. I calculate to
what extent I've been swindled and
act accordingly. A spoon or two, or
possibly a knife, will make it right. I
am scrupulously honest about it.” He
drew himself up proudly.
“If it's a theatre,” he went on, “and
I consider my time has been wasted, I
take the opera-glasses home with me.
You know those in the sixpenny boxes;
I've got opera-glasses at home from
nearly every theatre in London.”
“No 1 '' I said.
“Really,” he replied, “I’m not
joking. I never joke. You tell your
friend when you see him next. Perhaps
it will make him more reasonable.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AVE, CAESAR '
FULL in the splendour of this morning hour,
With tramp of men and roll of muffled drums,
In what a pomp and pageantry of power,
Borne to his grave, our lord, King EDWARD, comes!
In flashing gold and high magnificence,
Lo, the proud cavalcade of comrade Kings,
Met here to do the dead KING reverence,
Its solemn tribute of affection brings.
Heralds and Pursuivants and Men-at-arms,
Sultan and Paladin and Potentate,
Scarred Captains who have baffled war's alarms
And Courtiers glittering in their robes of state,
All in their blazoned ranks, with eyes cast down,
Slow pacing in their sorrow pass along
Where that which bore the sceptre and the crown
Cleaves at their head the silence of the throng.
And in a space behind the passing bier,
Looking and longing for his lord in vain,
A little playmate whom the KING held dear,
Caesar, the terrier, tugs his silver chain
s: º: 2: º: ::
Hail, Caesar, lonely little Caesar, hail!
Little for you the gathered Kings avail.
Little you reck, as meekly past you go,
Of that solemnity of formal woe.
In the strange silence, lo, you prick your ear
For one loved voice, and that you shall not hear.
So when the monarchs with their bright array
Of gold and steel and stars have passed away,
When, to their wonted use restored again,
All things go duly in their ordered train,
You shall appeal at each excluding door,
Search through the rooms and every haunt explore;
From lawn to lawn, from path to path pursue
The well-loved form that still escapes your view.
At every tree some happy memories rise
To stir your tail and animate your eyes,
And at each turn, with gathering strength endued,
Hope, still frustrated, must be still renewed.
How should you rest from your appointed task
Till chance restore the happiness you ask,
Take from your heart the burden, ease your pain,
And grant you to your master's side again,
Proud and content if but you could beguile
His voice to flatter and his face to smile 2
Caesar, the kindly days may bring relief;
Swiftly they pass and dull the edge of grief.
You too, resigned at last, may school your mind
To miss the comrade whom you cannot find,
Never forgetting, but as one who feels
The world has secrets which no skill reveals.
Henceforth, whate'er the ruthless fates may give,
You shall be loved and cherished while you live.
Reft of your master, little dog forlorn,
To one dear mistress you shall now be sworn,”
And in her queenly service you shall dwell,
At rest with one who loved your master well.
And she, that gentle lady, shall control
The faithful kingdom of a true dog's soul,
And for the past's dear sake shall still defend
Caesar, the dead KING's humble little friend.
R. C. L.
* It has been announced that Caesar will henceforth be cared for by
the QUEEN-Mother.
THE OLD GENTLEMAN.
I CAN hardly describe to you the queer shock of surprise
it gave me to meet him—after all these years. Of course,
in a vague way I had always expected it, as a thing that
was pretty well certain to take place some time or other.
I had even gone so far as to form an idle picture of what
he would probably be like; a flattering picture, I see now,
wherein a venerable and almost patriarchal benevolence
was choicely blended with the good-humoured sagacity of
the philosopher. As I say, the idea of our meeting was
one for which I was not altogether unprepared. But to
find myself at last actually in the same room with him—
I think I could have encountered the Pope of Rome with
less emotion 1
The manner of it was thus. I was calling that afternoon
upon Marjorie's Aunt. Not that the fact of Her being
Marjorie's Aunt had anything to do with my visit. So far
from it, indeed, that until about halfway through the call I |
was even unaware of Her very existence in that capacity. |
There were, however, a thousand reasons why I should
call upon Her which (in view of what happened later) need
not now detain us.
Anyway, at one point in the conversation She said,
smiling,
“I don't think you've met my little niece, Marjorie?”
I admitted the misfortune.
“She's the funniest little person 1" said my hostess,
smiling again (I am obliged to mention this; in my place |
you would understand why), “and keeps us all in fits. |
She's staying here at present.”
“Indeed " I said, thinking about something else.
“Yes, I hope she'll come in before you go. She's so
delightfully quaint about the people she sees in the street.
She's only seven, you know.”
“Of course,” I said heartily.
“Only yesterday,” continued Marjorie's Aunt, “she con-
vulsed the household with a really wonderful piece of
acting. You know how windy it was 2 Well, if you'd
seen her imitation of an old gentleman running after his

you!”
I said at once and fervently that nothing could give me
greater pleasure. It was a lie, but I said it.
speaking, the prospect bored me. Even then, before I had
any suspicion that the subject of the promised performance
was the Old Gentleman himself. (Perhaps, to avoid mis-
apprehension, I ought rather to have called him my Old ||
Gentleman.) However—
“I know it would appeal to you,” said Marjorie's Aunt. |
“You have such a keen sense of humour.”
And then, before we could discuss this really interesting
topic for more than a few precious minutes—
“Why, here is Marjorie,” exclaimed her Aunt, to my
extreme disappointment, as the door opened.
I am prepared to accept Marjorie's age at seven years,
as stated. She gave me further the impression of con-
sisting largely of white fluff, balanced upon a pair of black
silk legs slightly too long for her. But I may be prejudiced.
“Well, darling,” She said (not Marjorie, of course).
“Had a nice walk? Come and say “How-do-you-do?’ to
Mr. Smith.”
Marjorie came forward at once. She may be an obedient
child, but her smile is not a patch on her Aunt's.
She did not say, “How-do-you-do?” She said, speaking
very distinctly, “I saw you in the street yesterday. You
didn't see me. You did look funny running after your
hat l”
So that is how I first met the Old Gentleman.

WHAT CAMBRIDGE MAY
EXPECT.
(An Anticipatory Review from “The Daily
Donald,” Nov. 5, 1910)
CAMBRIDGE, like Oxford, is a many-
facetted gem, and while other writers
have dwelt on its spiritual and intellec-
tual charms it has been reserved for
Mr. Frank Screever in his Chatter from
Cambridge Commonrooms to reveal to us
a wholly unsuspected but none the less
delightful aspect of his Alma Mater.
Good as he is in other respects, Mr.
Screever is at his best in his accounts
of the vagaries of those members of the
University who afterwards became
distinguished members of the Church.
Truly exquisite are the account of the
collection of door-knockers made by
MILTON in his unregenerate days, and
the humorous but little-known sonnet
to his “gyp,” which begins:—
“Jenkins, of frowsy parents frowsier son.”
The episode of MILTON's rustication,
again, is told with a minute particu-
larity which is quite bewitchingly
sloppy. Anyone can write of dons and
deans in their official and ceremonial
aspects, but to present a true picture
of them in mufti, or in the delicious
dishevelment consequent on prolonged
potations of audit ale or '34 port—that
is a task which calls for the tasteful
and alluring pen of Mr. Screever. For,
after all, these are the things that
matter—not class lists or prizes or the
cloistral seclusion of the student, but
strings of jolly stories revealing the com-
mon humanity that pulsates below
the mortar-board and palpitates beneath
the gown. So Mr. Screever, with a
sure instinct, tells us about ERASMUs
and the tobacconist's daughter; why
GRAY was ducked in the Cam; how
many men ToDHUNTER invited to share
a bottle of grocer's sherry when he be-
came Senior Wrangler; why WHEweLL
threw LIGHTFoot out of the window ;
how GRAY climbed back into Peter-
house after attending a masked ball at
Audley End; and what THOMPsoN (the
Master of Trinity) said after reading
Mr. HALL CAINE’s first novel. On all
these points Mr. Screever is mar-
vellously well informed, and, addressing
himself primarily and frankly to an
audience who want not archaeology
but apocryphal anecdotes, he caters
for their needs with an assiduity and
irrelevance that are truly and wholly
admirable. Books like these are the
great lubricants of life. As a noble
master of unction has beautifully put
it, “they oleaginise the bearings of our
horribly complex mental machinery.”
Only a gownsman and a man of super-
lative taste and good feeling could
have given us that memorable vignette
of the late Professor CAYLEY's first
experience of a safety razor.
Extract from the Closer Settlement
(Amendment) Act, 1909, of New South
Wales.
“Where the value so determined is greater
than the amount of the offer or valuation
referred to in paragraph (a), but is less than
the amount of the claim of the owner aforesaid,
the Crown shall pay to the owner as costs the
amount to be fixed by multiplying the owner's
taxed costs by a fraction of which the numer-
ator is the amount by which the value determined
by the court exceeds the offer or valuation afore-
said, and the denominator is the difference
between the amount of the claim of the owner
and the amount of the said offer or valuation.”

FASHIONS FOR THE
2. *
SEASON. N.O. 1.
It is RUMoURED THAT THE MAN About Town MAY possibly Adopt the PRActice, so FAshionABLE AMoNG LAD1Es, of CARRYING A DOG;
BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE, THE RULE BEING—The LARGER THE DoG THE SMARTER THE MAN.
THE “BACK TO THE LAND THEATRE.”
WE are in the position of being able
to announce the decision of a millionaire
impresario, who for the present wishes
to remain anonymous, to organise and
finance a theatrical company on entirely
new lines.
The Aldbourne Players are actuated
by the noble desire of leading our
urban population back to the sweet
simplicity of rural life. The nameless
millionaire is impressed with the neces-
sity of supplementing this salutary
process by educating the dwellers in
remote villages up to the level of the
most advanced and sophisticated metro-
politan culture.
To this end he proposes to send out
his Missionary Theatre to play the
most emancipated dramas in villages
of not more than five hundred in-
habitants.
Interviewed by our representative at
his noble mansion in Park Lane on
Friday, Mr. X. thus briefly outlined
his intentions.
“My repertory,” he began, “includes
the leading plays of TolsToi, IBSEN,
ECHEGARAY, HAUPTMANN, SUDERMANN,
D'ANNUNzio and MAETERLINCK, all of
which I propose to present in the
tongues in which they were originally
written. As the company embraces
Russians, Scandinavians, Spaniards,
Germans, Frenchmen and Italians, the
claims of linguistic efficiency will be
fully met.”
“Will not this involve considerable
expense?”
“Undoubtedly. I estimate that my
salary list alone will come to £10,000 a
week. Fortunately money is no object,
and I am prepared to lose £300,000 in
the first year of my enterprise.”
“How do you propose to find suit-
able theatres in these small villages 2"
“Very easily. I have already ordered
a travelling theatre to be constructed
capable of accommodating the largest
audience likely to assemble in any of
these centres. But even if the attend-
ance is only a hundred or so I antici-
pate most valuable results as affecting
the art of my company. To play
habitually to large audiences is de-
moralising. As GIBBoN says, solitude
is the school of genius.”
“Will any new plays form part of
your repertory?”
“Certainly. I have commissioned Mr.
MAURICE HEwleTT to write a play on
the working man. Then I have been
promised a Burlesque Tragedy by
Mr. SHAw called King Lear of
Limerick. I am also in treaty with
Mr. Roosevel.T for a Homiletic Ex-
travaganza, and with Mr. GRAHAME-
WHITE for a Comedy of the upper air.
“Will music enter into your scheme?”
“Oh, yes! I have retained the
services of a German Conductor,
an orchestra of 100 players, and a
Russian Corps-de-Ballet headed by
Mmes. Tchitchikoff, Goremykin, Cerito-
ski and MM. Bobolinski and Popoff.
On this alone I expect to lose £15,000
in the first few months. But, after
all, wealth has its duties as well
as its privileges. To inoculate the
down-trodden victims of our tyrannical
squirearchy with a tincture of cosmo-
politan culture is at least a noble
aspiration, and my scheme has the
approval, amongst others, of Mr. LLOYD
GEoRGE, Mr. IMRé KIRALFY, PIERRE
Loti and Mr. John PAGE HoPPs.”

STORIES FOR SKIPPERS.
The LEGEND OF GRAYLING TOWERS.
ON the edge of a forest, beyond the
fair fringes of which a city's smoke
curled like dream-vapours, separated
from a sheet of rush-bordered water by
three terraces and a sun-dial, its lichened
wings facing all points of the compass,
stood Grayling Towers. If the heroic
eyes that lined its walls could have had
their sight restored to them, they would
scarcely have recognised the corridors
“Sir Hugh Mapleson, baronet, gen-
tleman, and blackguard,” thundered a
voice behind them, “may I show you a
remarkable white poppy that grows at
the far end of the lake 2" . . . . .
| Two shots rang out as one. A night-
bird rose from the rushes, adding its
weird music to echoing death. Then a
stifled voice hissed, “Curse you!”
It was Sir Hugh's voice—the voice of
the blustering braggadocio who, only a

FOG GOLF.
[Author. When are you going to publish my
fog story? * .
Editor. Too late. The fog season's over.
Author. Well, why didn't you publish it
during the season? ... " " -
Editor. I was waiting for a fog, and there
weren't any. -
Author. Perhaps there aren't ever going to
be any fogs again. So there's no sense in
waiting any longer.
Editor. Oh, very well.]
For this sport there are three essen-
tials—a fog, a golf-course, and two
enthusiastic lunatics. My uncle is
neither a golf-course nor a fog, but—
well, every Saturday morning he is
accustomed to meet his old friend Bolter
in a round of golf & outrance. Both are
twenty handicap men, but the affair is
conducted with the solemnity of a
championship. The stake, half-a-crown,
never varies, and forfeit is exacted if
either combatant is absent.
One Saturday he remarked at break-
fast, “I want you to help me with my
clubs to-day, my boy.” (My uncle does
not care for professional caddies. He
dislikes their manner of smiling, in
Mr.
Bolter's must be either a greater nature
or a more callous one.)
We were breakfasting by gaslight,
owing to the thick yellow fog that rolled
I seldom argue
“Yes, yes, I know!” he said testily.
“There is a little mist. Well, it may
frighten Bolter into paying forfeit. He
is five shillings up !”
+:
The fog seemed to have thickened
when we reached the clubhouse. It
crept into your eyes and stung. My
uncle found his clubs, and we groped
our way towards the first tee. As we
approached it, a muffled voice came to
our ears out of the clinging vapour.
“I shall wait five minutes more, my
lad,” it said triumphantly, as though
in answer to a protest. “After that, I
shall claim forfeit !”
Two nebulous figures, a large and
a little one, became discernible. They

resolved into Mr. Bolter and a small,
red-haired, shivering caddy. At sight
of each other the faces of my uncle and
Mr. Bolter fell. It appeared that both
had hoped for forfeit. I know that I
had, and I fancy that the caddy had
been clinging to a similar wistful
aspiration. -
Our principals bowed coldly to each
other. Off the golf-course they are old
and dear friends; upon it they assume
the bearing of duellists. Mr. Bolter took
the honour. He is the untrammelled
type of driver that rises slowly upon
both toes, and then leaves the ground
altogether at the moment of problemati-
cal impact with the ball. His whole-
hearted style tends to variety. Upon
this occasion chance willed that he
should hit the missile. -
“It felt straight and clean,” he re-
marked to his caddy with pleasant
optimism. “We should have no diffi-
culty in finding it.”
The child answered unemotionally
that Mr. Bolter had achieved a short
high slice. He added that they might
find the ball, and then again they
mightn't. It struck me that there was
probably Scotch blood in his puny body.
Mr. Bolter appeared annoyed and dis-
appointed.
My uncle relies for his drive (with
perhaps misplaced confidence) upon
a short, quick, powerful jerk. The
tawny, remorseless fog engulfed his ball.
“A clinker, Harry !” he cried exult-
antly. “One of the very best, wasn't
it?”

left. Both of us, despite his incurably
sanguine nature, knew that in all human
probability he had pulled. He always
pulls—except when he clean misses, or
when there is more danger in slicing.
Before we had gone six paces Mr.
Bolter and his small victim were
invisible. -
My instinct had not failed me. Un-
erringly, like some trained and patient
hound, I led my uncle along the left-
hand hedge, and there in the ditch we
found his ball. He did not appear
over-grateful to my instinct. * ,
That first hole is always a long one.
To-day it seemed somehow to have been
lengthened. Sooner or later you should
come to a pond across which you have
to play. Everything looked altered and
unreal in the fog. I will say for my
uncle that we did not have much
trouble in finding his ball after each
stroke.
“Short, straight, steady play is needed
to-day, Harry !” he kept saying .
But somehow we did not come to the
pond.
The next thing that I remember is
finding ourselves upon a green. I re-
moved the pin, and my uncle holed out
and picked up with some quiet triumph.
Nothing in the least offensive, you under-
stand. But — “Where's Bolter?” he
asked, with just a trace of superiority.
“Where's the pond P’’ I rejoined, for
a horrid doubt had come to me.
“We must , have gone right round
it,” my principal answered hopefully.
“Good Lord! . . . I do believe this is

It was, and my uncle had handled his
ball and lost the hole. We made a wide
cast to the right, my uncle frankly
grumpy, and I more than ever convinced
that a compass and someone who under-
stood the use of it were essential.
“We must be near the pond,” he said
at last.
ing and violent language? Yes, by the
Lord, there's someone in the water " '' .
It was Mr. Bolter. It appeared that
he had walked straight into the pond.
Fortunately, from a humane point of
view to which Mr. Bolter neglected to
give expression, his caddy had been
warned in time by his first scream.
Mr. Bolter cheered up on hearing that
we had lost the hole; his caddy seemed
to think that even tears were vain.
“You are very wet, Bolter,” my uncle
said solicitously. “If you would rather
abandon the match and pay forfeit——”
“I am one up !” Mr. Bolter answered
very curtly, and led the way vaguely
| towards the second tee. We found it

search.
Both of them drove, apparently in the
same direction, but we could not find
my uncle's ball. Mr. Bolter, a being in
“Do I or do I not hear splash-
whom golf brought out the basest
instincts of humanity, made but a half-
hearted effort to assist us in the search.
He went back to his own ball and
played it three times within a space of
twenty yards. As we searched on, my
uncle suddenly gave a short shriek of
pain. A ball had sailed out of the fog
and had struck him a stinging blow.
A blurred shape came running towards
us. It was Mr. Bolter.
“I am sorry for hitting you,” he said
triumphantly, “but I am afraid I must
claim the hole! You were in ſront of
me, and the rules are clear upon the
point.”
My uncle could only gobble with
excusable rage. I, too, felt that the
case was hard. Then his eye fell upon
the missile that had struck him, and he
gave a yell of triumph.
“By heaven, Bolter, you've played
with my ball, more than once!” he
howled. “It's my hole, after all.”
Mr. Bolter's jaw fell. “I’m afraid
you're right,” he admitted dolefully.
“That makes us all square, and—and I
fancy my caddy has run home !”
“Mine is still here,” responded my
uncle, glancing at me with the com-
placence of a successful trainer of lions.
“However, I will accept no advantage
over you, Bolter 2 x
“Perhaps he can carry for us both 2"
suggested Mr. Bolter hopefully. . . .
And it was then that I followed
slavishly the example set by that in-
telligent, red-haired Scottish child.

La Argentina heads its account of
the re-played Cup tie (if you can re-
member as far back as that),

—apparently because, in the report as
cabled in English, it said that “Barnsley
played a bustling game.” The account
ends up—
“Shepherd hizo un juego magnifico.
Burst, segundo, ſue multado.”
In case you have forgotten your Spanish
we may say that this means:
“Shepherd played a magnificent game.
Burst, second, was fined.”
Burst, however, was not really fined for
being second; the explanation seems
to be that SHEPHERD scored the second
goal with a fine burst. -
It is now your turn to help us. In

said, addressing himself to the staff in

tection for the individual against the
oppression of the fountain pen. Man, as
I confessedly am, of few principles
and unaccustomed to hard swearing, yet
have I taken my oath that upon principle
I would not be compelled by advertise-
ment into the purchase or perusal of
halfpenny papers, the buying of
notorious tooth-pastes, the burdening of
my person with never-to-be-sufficiently-
overrated fountain pens. With shame
I confess . . . I say, I confess with
shame . . .”
“Fetch the gentleman a glass of
water,” said the Attendant.
George drank and continued: “I was
weak. The hoardings were persistent
and merciless. I bought the paper
once. I bought it again, and then it took
to coming of itself to my front door
every morning. Finally I even read
it. Did that concession to my weak-
ness save me? Did I thus effect a
compromise with the tyrant? No.
That very paper, whispering insidious
eulogies into my ear in my more genial
and less vigilant moments, itself in-
duced me to take the second step on
the downward stage. Briefly, I fell
again, and the teeth which I cannot
mention without showing are now daily
corroded with the compound in question.
So far, so bad. But my waistcoat pocket
is yet innocent of fountain pens. May
it not remain so? Of the once false
step which brought me into this shop

resolutions taken by you on January

January the second, you I implore to
let me leave this shop a self-respecting
citizen, a man of my word, proud in the
possession of mothing worse than a lead
pencil, fitted with a reversible lead,
made in England and patented abroad.”
Amid a buzz of applause, the At-
tendant buttoned his coat to reply. “It
is with the greatest pleasure and not a
little feeling of personal unworthiness
that I rise to thank our distinguished
customer for his eloquent address. It
is with increased satisfaction—and I am
certain that I speak as well for my
colleagues as myself—that I now proceed
to show him a selection of those fountain
pens which in happier circumstances
he might already have bought and
waited in vain for years to catch leaking.
It would be an insult to his intelligence
and an unnecessary reflection upon our
own methods, were I to add that we
make this display only for his entertain-
ment and with no desire to force him
into an unwilling purchase.”
Thus, after a brief but shameful cere-
mony, George left that shop, forsworn
and unprincipled, bulging, moreover,
with ten-and-sixpence worth of vulcanite.
Further, owing to the unnecessary length
of the Attendant's speech, he arrived at
the Town Hall to find William gone out
to his lunch.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN Fortune J. C. SNAITH has chosen an attractive title
for a captivating tale, an adventure-story of mediaeval
Spain; and the allowance of fights, escapes, and general
swashbuckling in his pages would be generous at three
times the price (2s.). The hero, Miguel Jesus Maria de Sarda
y Boegas, setting out in chapter one to conquer fate
on a capital of ten crowns, an old horse and an older
sword, is a figure assured beforehand of at least one easy
‘Jim' engraved upon it in a feminine writing. I have no
idea who gave it him; perhaps he bought it. His right
hand held a small round Turkish cigarette” — which
leaves me vaguely wondering whether good Catholics smoke
large square Virginia cigarettes, and if so, where on earth,
or even beyond it, they procure them.
The Bolster Book (MILLS AND Boon), in offering itself for
judgment, presents a difficulty. It is admittedly a “funny”
book, containing forty-four prose articles, with here and
there a rare—a too rare—verse. It is conceived in a vein of
cheery sarcasm and naïve familiarity with great persons of
victory—over the hearts of the reading public. His perils
the moment. It abounds in jokes, good, bad and in-
different. But who shall say
are legion, and all of the right
breathless variety. Falling in
by the way with two fellow-
adventurers, a Cornish giant,
Sir Richard Pendragon, and a
mysterious Count de Nullepart,
the young Spaniard journeys to
the castle of Countess Sylvia, in
whose service the three perform
many strange exploits, amongst
them the kidnapping of the King
of Castile in a sack. Almost
every chapter seems to begin
with the comment, “We were
now indeed in dire straits,” nor
do I think that the promise of
these delightful openings is ever
falsified. Sir Richard Pem-
dragon himself is an entirely
priceless person, and, as I am
sure Mr. SNAITH's love for him
equalled my own, I have hopes
that our parting at the end of
the book is but temporary.
Meanwhile, for author and pub-
lisher (NELsoN), Fortune should
be as good as its name.
There is, it appears, quite a
number of nice people in this
country, and they are all
Roman Catholics. Most of
them are just ordinary nice
people, but a few, a very few,
have a call for the life religious
which they are bound to obey;

chosen on its merits as an aid
to slumber.” He demands, in
short, to be tried by a jury of
those “who toss feverishly upon
wakeful couches, vainly wooing
slumber throughout the inter-
minable hours” of night. So I
leave the case to a jury of insom-
niacs, strongly advising them, if
they have an occasional doubt,
to give Captain GRAHAM the
benefit of it.

lessly frivolous and shallow.
Accept these premisses and I can guarantee that you will
thoroughly enjoy A Winnowing (HUTCHINSON), which is
the title of Robert HUGH BENsoN's latest novel; in any
case you will admit the cleverness of the writer's descrip-
tions, whether of scenes or psychological crises. Nor is
there any lack of excitement, for in the first few pages one
of the principal characters dies for a few moments as the
result of a fall (it is this that leads him to fancy erroneously
that he is fitted for monastic vows) and then comes to life
again. I do not think that this has been done in a romance
before. I feel compelled to state, however, that if you are
as cantankerous as I am, and reject Father BENSON's
primary assumptions, you may be annoyed now and then
at the bitterness with which he paints the portraits of
unbelievers. Take, for instance, Mr. Fakenham. “He
carried in his left hand a small silver match-box with
Forest, I had also a feeling that I did not wish to go, and
—as regards guide-books—I knew of only one living author
who could at once saturate me with information and delight
me with his humour. But now that the book is read I
agree with the publishers that it is “an ideal companion,”
although when I set out upon my pilgrimage I shall want
C. E. HUGHES in a pocket edition. Another country has
been added to the lands of desire, and for this I offer my
gratitude to the author. He is a collector of, and an
epicure in, legends, and his remarks about them are in-
variably quaint and amusing. He knows well enough how
to mix fact with fancy, and just as routes and roads are
making you feel hot and weary you will find yourself
wafted away to some cool and romantic spot. Two maps
and numerous excellent illustrations add to the enjoyment
of a bulky but delightful book.

[JUNE 8, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. ROOSEVELT AS ART-CRITIC.
WE are indebted to a contemporary for the statement
that Mr. Roosevelt, on having his attention drawn to
FRITH's “Derby Day,” at the Tate Gallery, exclaimed,
“Ah ! Tempora mutantur !’” ”
In connection with this alleged remark of the ex-Pre-
sident's, we are in the happy position of being able to
furnish our readers with three appreciations of Mr. Roose-
velt, two of a critical nature, favourable and unfavour-
able, and the third characterised by good-humoured im-
partiality. - -
I. APPRECIATION BY A stroNG PRO-Roosevelt.
[It is not pretended that the following criticism reproduces the
actual style of that inexhaustible chronicler, Mr. SYDNEY BRooks, but let
us hope that it is animated by the same spirit of veneration.]
The man's driving-power is stupendous and unappeasable.
It might have been thought that after his monumental and
epoch-staggering speech at the Guildhall Mr. Roosevelt
would have taken a day off, merely permitting his secre-
taries to read the newspapers to him, that he might gather
the impressions which his speech had made upon the
chancelleries of Europe, and the electric change it had pro-
duced in the basal principles of the Imperial Idea. Not he.
Before lunching as the guest of the leaders of the Irish
National Party—itself a prospect which might well have
impaired the vitality of a smaller man—he insisted upon
passing in review the whole range of British Pictorial Art.
And it was in front of FRITH's picture of Derby Day
that his masterful criticism culminated in the memorable
phrase—Tempora mutantur (Times change).
Envious natures—and greatness ever provokes envy—
have traced an element of the platitudinous in some of
Mr. Roosevelt's world-orations. Yet the highest truths
are the simplest; and it is the mark of genius to find the
right word for the thoughts that seethe in the universal
breast waiting for someone to give them articulate utterance.
Thus, though the spirit of change is widely recognised as a
feature of every age, it was left for Mr. Roosevelt to
crystallise this feeling in the imperishable phrase, Tempora
mutamtur.
It is true that the words are borrowed from an
ancient Roman writer, but this is only another proof, if
one were needed, of Mr. Roosevelt's modesty and re-
pugnance to self-assertion, and further illustrates his
instinct for tempering the Republicanism of the New World
with the finest traditions of the Old. The fact that the
words he chose are in Latin (one of the noblest of the
dead languages) shows that Mr. Roosevelt's culture is
above that of the ordinary lion-hunter; at the same time
they are not so recondite as to suggest affectation, for he is
above all things a true democrat.
It will be noted that he did not extend his quotation so as
to include the words, mos et mutamur in illis (and we change
with them—literally, in them). It is characteristic of the
Colonel that he always knows when he has said enough.
He has the gift of speech, but he has also the rarer gift of
reticence.
It was remarked as not without significance that Mr.
Roosevelt uttered his great dictum before the picture of
Derby Day, on the very morning of the great race for
the Blue Riband of the Turf. The coincidence shows that
he was not at Epsom. And for those who remember with
what courage he set himself during his various Presidencies
to exterminate the habit of gambling which was once so
* We have it on the highest authority that Mr. Roosevelt denies
having made any such observation. We cheerfully accept this démenti,
and rejo ce that our symposium will now stand on its own merits, with-
out the trivial assistance of facts to support its main theme.
rife in Wall Street, it would be impossible to picture him
as assisting at an event like the Derby. For there is no
virtue preached by him in public which he does not practise
strenuously in his private life.
Mr. Roosevelt is due in a few days to depart from our
shores. We predict a great future for him. In any case,
when we reflect upon those unassailable truths which he
has told us, or has yet to tell, we may safely say that he
leaves England a better country than he found it.
II. APPRECIATION BY A STRONG ANTI-Roosevel.T.
[In the manner of Mr. William RANDolph HEARST, editor of The New
York American, and former candidate for the Governorship of New
York State. See his recent letter to The Daily Mail.]
It was not enough that this windy swashbuckler, this
self-appointed butcher of defenceless lions, should interfere
in British politics, of which he knows nothing; he must
now rush in and make another exhibition of himself on the
subject of British art, of which he knows less than nothing.
And what was he doing anyhow, this so-called Trust-
buster, this anti-gambling crusader, in front of a picture of
Derby Day? --
“Tempora mutantur,” he says. In order to ingratiate
himself with the brutal imperialism of a decadent nation
that governs in the sole interest of the oppressor, he
adopts the language of an effete Empire, reared upon the
same ideals of blood and iron. If his own American
tongue was not good enough for him, he might at least
have employed that of the great sister Republic, France,
and remarked: “Autres temps autres maeurs.” -
The fact is that this self-appointed representative of
American institutions is not a true American at all. He
repudiates the very creed which has made Americans what
they are. That creed claims that a just government is
based upon the consent of the governed. Why should
we have massacred one another by countless myriads in
the war of North and South unless for the purpose of prov-
ing the excellence of this Christian and American doctrine?
“Times change,” indeed, and quickly. Yesterday, prior
to luncheon with an English Lord Mayor, he was urging
the British Government to throttle at its birth the budding
passion for freedom among the down-trodden races of
Egypt. To-day he lunches with the leader of the Irish
National party and hypocritically professes a whole-souled
sympathy for their struggles to emancipate themselves
from the crushing heel of the same tyrannical Government.
Why this volte-face on the part of our Rough-and-tumble
Rider? The answer is obvious. He wants the Irish vote
for his next Presidential campaign. The Egyptian vote is
relatively negligible.
To be candid, yet without overstepping the limits of
American political courtesy, Roosevelt is a born advertiser
of himself—another characteristic wholly uncongenial to
the national temperament. The sooner he gets back to
Oyster Bay with his stuffed rhinos and giraffes the better
for everybody. At home we know his value and are nº
to be bluffed. True and self-respecting Americans should
give this posturing imperialist a warm reception.

SUPERSTITION.
“SUPERSTITION,” said the night
watchman, spitting thoughtfully—
[Editor. Is this story by W. W.
| Jacobs, or you ?
| AUTHoR. Me. I made a mistake.
| May I begin again *)
They had been telling each other
tales of Derby winners and lucky bets
all night, and the quiet man in the
corner had sat silent but engrossed,
drinking it all in. At last the flow of
stories ceased. With one accord they
turned enquiringly to him, as if wait-
ing for his contribution. He sighed,
and then in a melancholy voice began
to speak. -
“I never have any luck myself,” he
said. “I drew a horse called Kensing-
ton in our club sweep this year. I had
never heard of Kensington before, nor
had anybody else in the club; in fact, I
don't know how his name came up at
all. The most positive information I
ever got about him was that there had
once been a horse of that name who had
died. I even went so far as to take a
bus down to Kensington to see if they
knew anything about him there, but
they didn't. Finally I put him up
to auction, but when the bidding had
gone slowly up to ninepence I with-
drew him. Sentiment has always been
my curse. . . . .
“Funnily enough, my young brother
drew Lemberg. The first prize was
fifty pounds, and he sold half of him
to Travers for ten pounds. When
Lemberg won by a neck they had a
great argument as to which half
Travers had bought. My brother said
it was the end or tail half, which
had been beaten, and insisted that he
had kept the front or winning half for
himself. I forget how they settled it. . .
“Some of you were talking just now
about dreams coming true. Thinking
of that and of my poor horse, Kensing-
ton, reminds me of a very curious dream
which a superstitious friend of mine
had some years ago. His name was
Willson, and he knew nothing about
racing at all, except that there was a
contest called the Derby which horses
went in for. In fact he seemed to
think that it was the only race in the
year, or else that they ran it every
week—I am not quite sure which.
Well, he had this dream one night a
week before the Derby, and next morn-
ing at the office he was extremely
thoughtful and mysterious. At last
he took one of the other men into his
| confidence.
“He said casually: ‘Is there a horse
called Armadillo running in the
Derby?’
“‘I don't think so,” said the other
man. “Anyhow, he isn't one of the
favourites.’ -
“Willson was silent for a long time,
and then he said in quite an ordinary
voice: “I think of putting my shirt on
Armadillo.’ -
“The other man was extremely sur-
prised, because Willson had never
talked like this before. Willson's
lunch was generally a small dry ginger
ale and a nut cutlet, followed by half a
non-throat cigarette. So the friend
took him on one side and begged him to
ease his mind by confessing all.
“Well, it appeared that Willson had
had a very vivid dream about a horse
called Armadillo. He had seen the
horses cantering past, and he had
picked out one of them and asked his
companion (who was the Sultan of
Zanzibar) what its name was. And
the Sultan had said ‘Armadillo—put
your shirt on him.’ And then Willson
had found to his horror that he had
been in such a hurry to catch the train
that he had only got his night-shirt on ;
which so appalled him that he woke up.
Coming up to the office next morning
he found out from an acquaintance
what the expression ‘putting on your
shirt’ meant; and he had already
given instructions to his stockbroker
to sell out everything, so that Armadillo
might be properly supported.
“‘Of course, there is a good deal in
dreams,’ his friend admitted. ‘I’ve
no doubt you're right, if What
was this horse like 2'
“‘Just an ordinary horse. One of
those brown ones.’
“‘Oh! You didn't happen to notice
the colours of the jockey 2'
“Willson hadn't. He had a sort of
impression that the jockey was the
King of the Belgians, but he couldn't
say what he wore. It was all rather
hurried. Still he was absolutely certain
that Armadillo was going to win the
Derby.
“‘And I’ve got two thousand pounds,
and that means twenty thousand when
he wins.' He had a vague idea that
all horses started at 10 to 1.
“Well, he made a lot of inquiries, but
nobody had ever heard that Armadillo
was starting or had even been entered
for the Derby. For two or three days
he pottered about riding-schools and
stables, and talked to ostlers and people,
in the hope of hearing something
about this horse. He was not always
successful in making them understand
what he wanted, for in the course of
the week he was offered on ridiculously
cheap terms several horses which were
called Armadillo, and several more
which could be so called if necessary,
and one genuine armadillo from South
America which would answer equally
well to any name . . .
“The day before the Derby he had
another talk with his friend at the
office. **
“‘I have been thinking it over,’ he
said, ‘and I have come to the con-
clusion that it is just possible I did not
catch the name with complete accu-
racy. The Sultan spoke rather rapidly.
What horse has a name most like
Armadillo 2'
“They got a Sportsman and went
through the list of starters. There
were two hopeless outsiders called
Armiger and Zenatello, and it really
looked as if Willson would have to
put his shirt on one of these. They
had a long argument as to which one's
name was most like that of the dream
horse, and finally decided on Zenatello,
which Willson thought was some kind
of animal itself, but which Willson's
friend felt was either a flower or a
musical instrument. Anyhow, what:
ever it was, it carried two thousand
pounds of Willson's on the next
day. . . .
“Well, most of you will remember
what happened on that Wednesday
afternoon. I don't quite know how to
explain it. Sometimes I think that
dreams do go by contraries, and that
the fact of Zenatello coming in abso-
lutely last justified Willson's faith in the
reality of his vision. Sometimes—"
The quiet man paused for a moment.
“Yes?” said everybody who was
awake.
“Well, Willson had never been on a
racecourse, and he seemed to have, as
I said, a sort of idea that the Derby
was the only race that was ever run.
This race that he saw in his dream may
not have been the Epsom Derby at all.
For we discovered afterwards that
there was a horse called Armadillo
which in a field of two had won the
Steeple Bumpstead Stakes on a foul
at the Little Yeldingham Summer
Meeting.”
“Then Willson was right, after all?"
“Ye-es. Except, you know, that
the Little Yeldingham races took place
just a week before he had his dream,
It was a good dream, but I'm afraid
there was never any money in it."

DEAR SIR AND CoMPANY, LTD., Let
us respect each other's anonymity. I
am concerned to make public less who
you are than what I am not. Forgive
me, but I do most emphatically deny
that I am or ever have been “a small
lager.” Small, possibly; light or dark,
probably; small light (or dark) lager,
most certainly not.
Let us get the identities clear to start
with. You are the proprietor of most
of the brightest and best feeding houses
in the City and County of Bondon (we
will not let the real names leak out)
and I am your customer. The matters
complained of took place in one of your
restaurants a year ago last Saturday.
I have allowed that interval to elapse
before declaring myself, so that all
coffee-stains and other important clues
might be removed by competent
laundry - women in the meanwhile.
You must, therefore, give up all hope
of tracing the affair to its origin, and I
am left with a free hand to deal with
the narrative as I see fit, without fear
of detection or correction.
Right in the middle of the Grill
Room of this restaurant there is a very
pleasant table, meant to seat four appe-
tites. This table is deservedly a favour.

thing that is going on and yet not hear
too much of the, pardon me, music. - I
know, and the Superintendents know,
that, if a solitary feeder once gets seated
there, nothing will induce others to
join him. Nevertheless, on the Satur-
day night in question, I made up my

tendents didn't like it. Lots of jovial
quartettes didn't like it. I, however,
did like it, and there accordingly I
stayed. - -
We will not revive the memories of
that very happy meal, but we will note
that what I was treating myself for
was not thirst but hunger. When,
therefore, the drink question arose, I
inclined to water, but to drink that in
a public restaurant is to court universal
suspicion and hatred. So I thought
of the cheapest fluid consistent with
dignity and popularity, and ordered
beer. Moreover, because I love my
country less than my liver, I chose
the German brand and ordered a small
Pilsener.
As the meal neared completion, in
came the most important man ever
. made, a Plenipotentiary Autocrat (I
gather) of your Company's Board. He
came, not for noise, people, food or
merriment, but business. He came to

Gathering the latter round him in
degrees of humility varying from the

Sir, this great man in the victuals and

is still on the very high seas, so I
waited lowly to hear what particular
sort of a wastrel I was going to be.)

(From T. Hatherley, Barton Lodge, Dilston Magna, to
Augustus Bond, Esq., J.P., Reppington Hall, Dilston Magna.)
DEAR SIR,--I hope you will pardon what may, but I
trust will not, appear an intrusion upon your domestic affairs,
but the rapidly approaching wedding of the daughter of
our High Sheriff (yourself) with Sir Mallaby Boxley, Bart.,
is an event of such universal interest to Dilston and the
surrounding districts that I cannot forbear myself from
sending you the enclosed tribute to the auspicious event in
verse. Pardon me if I have made a mistake as to the
number of the bridesmaids. -
Yours fly,
(Enclosure.)
ODE IN CELEBRATION OF THE MARRIAGE OF
Miss Rosa Mond Bond To SIR MALLABY BoxLEY, BART.
On the Fifteenth of July of this present year
It is most earnestly hoped that the sky will be clear,
And that the Sun in bright effulgence will cast down his ray
On the pair who will walk to the hymeneal altar on this day.
T. HATHERLEY.
May Heaven shower blessings on fair Rosamond
Whose honoured sirname is known to be Bond.
With her husband beside her, that ancient Baronet, Sir
Mallaby,
May she have all the joys which, alas, have been denied
to me.
A proud man and glad is Sir Mallaby Boxley, Bart.,
At any rate he ought to be at having won her heart.
And our noble High Sheriff and his matronly wife,
Though parted from their daughter, will look after her life.
We will all of us shout just as loud as we can
When the bride and the bridegroom issue forth in the van,
And the six (?) lovely bridesmaids, like a herd of young deer,
March out covered with blushes and bring up the rear.
At the Church of St. Matthew's the ceremony will take place;
It is the Parish Church of this celebrated place.
Every pew will be filled with beauty, rank and grace
To do all the honour that can possibly be done
To the two whom the Vicar will marry and make one.
T. HATHERLEY.

DEAR GENERAL HATHERLEY, I can assure you that we
have all been deeply touched by your kindness in sending
us your beautiful Ode in celebration of Rosamond's
approaching wedding. Both my wife and the young
people themselves have read the charming lines with
sincere gratitude and appreciation, and Rosamond bids me
say that the Ode shall always be preserved amongst her
most valued family records. I was not aware that your
busy career had left you leisure to cultivate the Muse to
such good purpose. If I might express a preference where
all is admirable, it would be for the third stanza. We shall
indeed feel the parting from our daughter, but the thought
that she will not be far from us and that we may still be
able, as you so well put it, to “look after her life,” will
sustain us. With renewed thanks, I am, dear General
Hatherley, Yours very truly, AUGUSTU's BoxD.
III.
(From Major-General Hatherley to Augustus Bond, Esq.)
DEAR MR. Bond,-I have received your letter, but you
must forgive me for 'saying that I am totally at a loss to
understand it. I have never written an Ode in my life.
Of course you have my good wishes, but I prefer to express
them in honest prose.
Yours very truly, F. HATHERLEY.
IV.
(From Augustus Bond to Major-General F. Hatherley.)
DEAR GENERAL HATHERLEY, Your letter has astonished
me. I enclose herewith the letter which I supposed to be
from you, together with the Ode, so that you may see that
I had some warrant for a mistake which is most annoying.
On re-reading these documents I notice that the hand-
writing is quite different from yours, that the signature is
slightly different (T. instead of F.) and that the letter is
dated, not from Barton Park, but from Barton Lodge.
There is some mystery here.
Yours very truly, AUGUSTU's Bon D.
V. -
(From Major-General F. Hatherley to Augustus Bond, Esq.)
DEAR Mr. Bond,-You are right: there is some mystery.
I need hardly say that I am in no way responsible for the
Ode, nor have I the remotest knowledge of the writer who
has presumed to masquerade in my name. If I can dis-
cover him I shall certainly bring the law to bear upon him.
I do not profess to be a poet, but I cannot help thinking that
if I tried I could produce something better than the pre-
posterous and impudent rubbish which has been so falsely
attributed to me. I cannot agree with you that the Ode is
beautiful or the lines charming.
Yours very truly, F. HATHERLEY.
VI.
(From Augustus Bond to Major-General F. Hatherley.)
DEAR GENERAL HATHERLEY, I owe you my apologies
for having supposed that you were capable of writing what
you truly call preposterous rubbish. You will admit that
while I was labouring under this mistake it was natural
that I should invest the lines with merits which they do
not possess. I have made enquiries of the Dilston post-
master, and have discovered that the personage calling
himself T. Hatherley came here two years ago. He was
originally known under the name of Spraggs, but a few
months ago he changed it to Hatherley and at the same
time converted his semi-detached cottage from “The
Minchins’’ to “Barton Lodge.” I fear this imitation is
likely to cause you great inconvenience, but as he holds
his cottage on a long lease from Bottrill, the Radical mill- |
owner, I do not see that anything can be done.
Yous very truly, AUGUSTU's Bond.
VII.
(From T. Hatherley to Augustus Bond, Esq., J.P.)
SIR,-More than a week has passed by since I sent you
my Ode on the approaching marriage of Miss Bond, and I
have not heard from you in acknowledgment of same. I
am sure it arrived, as I sent it by hand. This is not the
conduct that one gentleman has a right to expect from
another. I do not wish to stand upon punctualio, but may
I press for a reply or a return of the poem. Otherwise I
shall know what to think, for High Sheriffs are not every-
body. Yours fly, T. HATHERLEY.

'' Tobacco AND Au ABOUT m.
To the young man about town start-
ing upon the thorny path of life, nothing
is more important than to know from
the first the true inwardness of tobacco.
Many a City clerk has worked his way
through his ten fags without the faintest
idea who the young lady may be whose
photograph accompanied the packet. I
even count among my acquaintances a
middle-aged man, of otherwise stainless
character, who has coloured three meer-
schaums without knowing how to spell
one of them.
Having no acquaintance amongst the
poets or their well-fed descendants, I can
yet say this much without fear of con-
tradiction. Tobacco is like the poet in
that it is born and not made. (Nascitur,
mon fit.) Otherwise their methods differ,
and the distinction is all in favour of
tobacco. Not a word of complaint; not
a sign of impatience; not a movement of
disgust or insubordination. The plant
stands quietly there, handing out tobacco
with unfailing precision and courtesy,
modestly unconscious of the joy it is
conferring on humanity.
The chief object for which tobacco
was discovered was to keep the mouth
occupied between meals. -
Once past the age limit, you may
smoke a pipe, a cigarette or a cigar.
You may even, if you are an unscru-
pulous person, smoke a calabash. Your
pipe may be of cherry-wood, briar, clay
or the unspellable ware of foreign origin,
but you cannot hope to get on in life if
it has not a piece of silver on it some-
where. Given that passport to gentility,
you may without fear of a scandal smoke
it in the broadest of daylight. I do not
absolutely prohibit your smoking in the
dark, but I suggest to you that you will
not enjoy it or, at any rate, know that
you are enjoying it. To get rid of dark,
buy a match and rub it lightly on the
trousers.
Cigarettes may be bought by number
or by weight, may be purchased in
packets or tins. They cannot be hired.
When you borrow a cigarette from a
friend, he will not take offence if you do
not return the bit at the end for which
you have no use. As for the proper
disposal of the ash, that is one of the
most keenly debated subjects in the
world. Some say it should be thrown
on the carpet, arguing tentatively that
it is good for the carpet, and asserting
with more conviction that at any rate it
shows by its absence or presence next
morning whether or not the room has
been swept since last night. Some say
it should certainly not be thrown on the
icarpet, adducing no arguments, but
generally prevailing nevertheless. You
must decide for yourself between the
two points of view. The former is

backed by the authority of men who
have the largest experience of cigarettes,
the latter by the authority of women
who have the largest experience of
carpets. The practical solution of the
difficulty is to drop your ash on the
carpet, but to avoid ostentation and, as
far as possible, detection in so doing.
As to cigars, there are four degrees of
strength: the claro, the colorado claro,
the colorado, and the no-thanks-I-think-
I-will-smoke-a-pipe-if-you-don't-mind.
Be ever on the alert.
There remains only the question of
feminine smoking. Much has been said
in private and written in public on this
burning question. For my part, I do
not object to ladies smoking. It would
make no difference if I did.

WHEN roses first begin to bud
And twigs grow green and sappy,
A raging fever fills my blood
And I become unhappy.
“Back to the land!” is then my sigh,
“A curse on chains!” I always cry
About this season of the year
When dew-dipped roses first appear.
But when my spirit thus is spurred
To fly from smoke and houses,
Then is the voice of wisdom heard—
It is my prudent spouse's :

Has left each creaking sinew.
I frown and fretfully complain
Until the voice is heard again:
“If you desire the land, why not
Begin upon the garden plot?”
The mower from its shed is drawn
And to and fro I travel;
Most carefully I plant the lawn
With weedlets from the gravel.
I hose each individual root
In hopes that it may learn to shoot,
And on each drooping plant I try
The finest guano cash can buy.
I dig until the blood o'erflows
My apoplectic cranium,
And here I plant a rambler rose
And there a pink geranium.
Aching and sore at length Istand
To view the labour of my hand,
And as I take my well-earned rest
Hope springs eternal in my breast.
But, though with richest fare I feed
My precious plants and pet them,
I cannot make them take the lead
That cheerful Hope has set them.
They still refuse to spring; they choke
Amid the petrol-laden smoke,
Till, beaten by the smutty mob,
The very chickweed chucks his job.
So, after weary weeks of toil
And planting many a seedling,
I gaze upon a patch of soil
That cannot boast a weedling.
And yet, no doubt, when next year's
spring
- Once more the earth-desire shall
bring,
Still hopeful, up and down I'll go
Trundling the mower to and fro.

MR. ARGYLL MULLET's CoNCERT.
A NotEwoRTHY feature of Mr.
Mullet's concert on Thursday last at
the Broadway Hall was its linguistic
versatility. To sing songs by such
diverse composers as Monteverde,
Lully, Napravnik, Smetana, Sinding,
Vincent d'Indy, Gomez, Wagner and
Stephen Adams is in itself no small
achievement. To sing them in the
languages to which they were origin-
ally composed is something of a
miracle, and, as a matter of fact, it
proved rather too much for Mr.
Mullet's powers. His somewhat glu-
tinous tenor voice has been diligently
trained, and there are moments when
he produces a comparatively agreeable
tone. But his technical equipment is
still inadequate to the demands of
such bravura songs as Napravnik's
“Chanson de Phagocyte” or Stephen
Adams's “Serenade to Mrs. Eddy.”
Here the articulation was indistinct,
whereas the one thing needful in such
songs is that every syllable should be
enunciated with perfect distinctness.
Nor again was Mr. Mullet above re-
proach on the score of intonation;
indeed it was only occasionally that he
deviated into tunefulness. This last
remark also applies to Miss Winolia
Turtle, who assisted in the recital,
singing songs by Field (of Lambeth),
Cyril Scott-Gatty, and Windsor-Brown,
Senr. The programme also included
recitations by Miss Vanessa Blurt, who
has a powerful voice and vigorous
gestures, but would be well advised to
modify her methods. The bulls of
Bashan were doubtless valuable on the
pasture lands of Og, but they are out
of place in a London concert hall.
The accompaniments were played by
Mr. Harry Jaggers with good inten-
tions, but a far too liberal abuse of the
loud pedal. There was a large but
unimpassioned audience, of whom at
least two-thirds were girls of between
thirteen and seventeen years of age.
MRs. BINDONY Tosher's CoNCERT.
The programme of Mrs. Bindony
Tosher's concert at the Lovelian Hall
on Saturday was entirely made up
of her own compositions. A test
from which the greatest masters do not
always emerge unscathed is a somewhat
severe ordeal, but it must in fairness
be admitted that the majority of the
audience enjoyed—or, at any rate, suc-
cessfully simulated enjoyment of this
unmitigated succession of pseudo-
oriental ditties. Three new cycles, en-
titled “The Cobra's Courtship,” “By
Balmy Bangalore,” and “In Spot Cash-
mere,” were introduced, with the com-
poser at the piano, and Miss Silence
Towers, Miss Pinkie Pilotelli, Miss
Lenore Spink and Messrs. Kedger Rea,
Horatio Tank, and Bungalow Dawkins
as vocalists. The artistic quality of these
songs, if measured by the number of
artists engaged in their performance,
must be considerable; and as a musical
alternative for confectionery of the
sweetest and most cloying kind they
undoubtedly have their merits. Mrs.
Bindony Tosher, who was arrayed in a
white jibbah with esoteric Lama fril-
lings, Afghan sandals and a Senussi
turban, accompanied her songs with
obvious zest.
JonAH QUIGLEY ORCHESTRA.
The programme of the Jonah Quigley
Amateur Orchestral Society's concert
at the Elephant and Castle Philhar-
monic Hall on Tuesday last had at
least the merit of containing very few
pieces which are frequently heard.
Whether it is in the interests of art
that they should ever be heard at all is
another question. The most important
work was Erasmus Rumpelmayer's
fifteenth symphony (in F major),
which, in spite of its inordinate length,

seldom, if ever, surpasses a level of
blameless banality. A place was also
found for Kosloff's piccolo concerto,
the solo part in which was played by
Mr. Chickering Pepys. Mr. Pepys is
an agile performer, but the tone which
he elicits from his instrument is occa-
sionally disconcerting. The vocal part
of the programme consisted of a group
of Patagonian Folk Songs, arranged by
M. Polydore Lalouette, and sung by
Mme. Hilmi Pingouin. The songs are
in themselves exceedingly insipid, but
might have sounded better if Mme.
Pingouin had delivered them more
imaginatively and with a greater com-
mand of tone colour. These qualities,
however, were unhappily quite lacking
in her rendering, which combined with
the indifferent ventilation of the hall to
produce a state of somnolence in the
auditors quite distressing to witness,
M. Lalouette accompanied with an
excessive self-restraint, for he controls
his tone even in fortissimo passages.
We venture to suggest that it would
become more weighty and dignified if he
developed the muscles in his upper arm,
which are obviously deficient in fibre.
THE NEW AERATED BREAD.—Hot
Cross-Channel Rolls.
LIGHT ON THE EMIN ENT.
At a time when no detail of the
lives of successful persons is considered
superfluous, especially in connection
with the grandest of English sports, it
is well to set down all that can be col-
lected concerning some of the more
remarkable of the winners of Derby
sweepstakes all over the world.
The great Calcutta Turf Club sweep
fell, as every one must now know, to
an officer of the Indian army now on
leave in this country. Jº is also com-
mon history, since most of the papers
have devoted space to the matter, that
he sold half of his chance to a London
syndicate for £7,500, and that Lemberg
thus brought him only £33,000. We
are in a position to state that with this
sum the lucky speculator has bought a
radium safe.
The Motherland Club sweep at
Melbourne was won by Mr. Michael
Swinton, a prominent Australian sheep-
farmer well known for his love of sport.
Little did he think that the five-pound
note that he flung down so carelessly
some few weeks ago would be bringing
him in ten thousand of the very best—
or to be exact 9995. Mr. Swinton is
fifty-three years of age and has four
sons and two daughters. The sons are
still under age. The eldest is intended
for the Australian Bar and ultimately
politics. The second is going into his
father's business. The others will pro-
bably come to England to be educated.
The daughters, Cicely and Gertrude,
play and sing with great spirit. Mrs.
Swinton (who gets a new bonnet out
of this windfall) is a favourite in society
at Ullalongville, where their home is.
Captain Fossetter, who drew Lem-
berg in the Grey Watch sweep, is an
active soldier of thirty-two, keen and
ambitious. From Sandhurst he went
to Aldershot and thence to South Africa,
where he was shot right through the
head (at Paardeberg), without, how-
ever, any permanent damage. On the
anniversary of the injury the wound is
said to open again, so that one can see
right through the gallant officer's brain;
and both in 1907 and again in 1909 a
committee of medical men visited him
and reported on the phenomenon to The
Lancet. Captain Fossetter is unmarried.
On drawing Lemberg in the Jermyn
Club, Mr. “Ronny" Withers was natu-
rally the centre of an excited crowd,
and he received many offers of sums
varying from £5 to £100 for his chance.
He had, however, the good sense to
stick to his ticket, and is now the richer
by £699. Mr. Withers is one of the
most versatile young men in London.
He plays the balalaika with much taste
and feeling, is an expert golfer, can
handle the bat, dines out with skill
and discretion, and reviews fiction for
The Literary Post.
Lord Arthur Way, who drew Lemberg
in the sweep at the Newmarket, is said
to have devoted a cool fifty of it to the
evening's entertainment, beginning with
the Empire and passing on to a restau-
rant in the Strand, outside of which he
was to be observed, in the small hours,
delivering an admirable Romano's lec-
ture to his friends and a number of
unattached spectators.
Quite different was the course of
action followed by Miss Hilda St. Just,
who won the sweep at the Ladies'
Grille Club. On hearing the glad news
of Lemberg's victory she is said to have
at once taken a taxi and driven to the
studio of M. Sigismund Goelzi, her
favourite artist, and commissioned him
there and then to paint a picture in
green, purple and white, symbolical of
the cause of women's suffrage, to which
her young and charming life is for the
moment devoted.
Sam Briggs, who won the first prize
in the sweepstakes at the Union Arms,
Lad Lane, Hoxton, called all his mates
to join him in a feast and spent the
whole five shillings on winkles and
beer. Mr. Briggs is a fine, well-made

man of forty-two, and though he has
been gambling in a small way all his
life this is the first success that has
come to him. He was educated at the
Board School in Ivy Place, but he did
not take a degree. He then entered a
grocer's as errand boy, but becoming
dissatisfied with the quality of the
sugar he left, and, after a roving life of
four or five years, he married and
became doorkeeper at the New Road
Empire, where he has remained ever
since. His hair is dark to medium.

Of glory's end and good.

The breed of lesser states—

What hope of holidays for sport
On well-remembered dates?

And half their shores as well,
Where Britain's flag has braved the

And Britons fighting fell,
Are charted with historic pleas
For knocking off a spell.

Its lordship of the deep !

PROGRESSIVE WHIDGE.
Luckily for me there were two men
in the hat-and-coat room whose hair
parted down the middle. They spent
so long over the mirror that I had time
to learn the rule on the back of the card,
expressed in simple yet nervous English:
“When partners or no partners the
Lady with the highest score moves up
and the Gentleman with the highest
score moves down — but should two
Ladies or two Gentlemen score an equal
number of tricks in a no partners' deal
they shall cut—the lowest to win and
move.” By the time that the bald man,
who nipped in just in front of me, had
satisfied himself once more that two
parallel wisps of hair, being produced
ever so far at right angles to their
common paths, will never meet, I was
word-perfect. So I moved up to the
hair-brushes and then moved down to
the drawing-room, which seemed just
large enough to hold seven card tables
or twenty-eight people, but not both.
“Good evening,” said Mrs. Pomphrey.
“Delighted you could come.”
“Thank you very much,” I answered.
“‘But should two gentlemen score an
equal number of tricks in a no partners'
deal they shall cut—the lowest to win
and move.' Would you mind telling
me how the lowest can make sure of
winning? There's some catch about
that rule.”
“Oh, we've dropped that rule. It
seemed rather complicated. Wasn't it
scored out on your card?”
“No ; and I've learned it by heart
and don't believe I can ever forget it.”
“Never mind,” said Mrs. Pomphrey.
“We’re going to progress just in the
ordinary way. This is your first partner,

Mrs. Tarbut, and she will tell you all
about it.”
Mrs. Tarbut said it was very cold
outside, but quite warm in here, and
that she was glad I knew the rules for
Progressive Whidge, because she didn't,
but that she had been to The Blue Bird,
and thought it quite as nice in some
ways as Peter Pan, but not perhaps
quite so nice in others. At the same
time both were nicer than Elektra, the
story of which was hardly quite nice.
Recalled to business, Mrs. Tarbut said
she believed that we were to progress
just in the ordinary way, winners to
move on, and either change partners or
keep the same partner all the evening.
Mrs. Pomphrey had said which way it
was to be, but Mrs. Tarbut never had
had any head for figures. But we could
see what the other people did.
“Let's find our table
taken by spades counts 8. Copyright;
entered at Stationers' Hall.’”
“Perhaps that very last bit you read
isn't in the game.”
“Well,” said Mrs. Tarbut cautiously,
“there is a line drawn just above it, but
that may be for adding up the score.”
“I wish we were adding it up now.”
“That's not very polite, when we
are partners.”
“I know, but the fear of losing you
spoils everything.

Progressive Whidge * >
“If you were arranging,” said Mrs.
Pomphrey, thrusting two people by
force into the other two chairs, “you'd
want to get begun as soon as possible.”
At supper Mrs. Tarbut was rather pre-
occupied. She had scored 54, and the
highest lady's score was 61. And the
man on the other side of her wanted to
discuss whether, when you are playing
“Defeat” and hold the Queen of Spades
and three others, you should play it in
the second round or hold it up on the
chance of throwing it away. It seems
to require a special kind of mind to play
and sit down, and that
will make room for
other seven or eight
people. Here it is.
Will you sit with your
back against the fire-
guard or your elbow in
that pot of hyacinths?
Yes, you will be more
comfortable there. Now
I wish you would ex-
plain the inside of this
card to me : ‘Total
number of tricks taken
to be scored.’ Is that
meant as a hint against
cheating?”
“No,” said Mrs.
Tarbut. “It means that
you score all the tricks
you take, and not just
the ones above six—

Progressive Whidge, for
nobºdy quite normal
would hold a thing up
just to throw it away.
After supper we had to
play again until a bell
rang, and then we were
all allowed to stand up
and try to move about
the room, till the prizes
were distributed. Mrs.
Tarbut was an easy first,
which meant that Mr.
Tarbut had a large
flower-pot full of daffo-
dils to carry home. I
got into a corner, where
there was a good view
of the clock, but Mrs.
Pomphrey found me out
there and presented me
with a brass donkey.
I thought it was a
way you used to do at whist.”
“But this isn't whist. It's Progres-
sive Whidge.”
“But some of it's whist with varia-
tions.”
“So it is,” said I, consulting my card.
“I say, you know, this first thing is
rather serious. It says, “Auld Lang
Syne: Ordinary Whist'—and I haven't
brought my music. And if we sing
‘Auld Lang Syne' now, it will break up
the party.”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Tarbut. “This card
doesn't seem very well arranged. “Auld
Lang Syne' should come at the end
instead of ‘Wealth.’”
“Wealth ! I haven't come to that yet
—I mean, it hasn't come to me.”
“‘Wealth,’” said Mrs. Tarbut very
impressively, reading from her card,
“‘Wealth, Partners, count all tricks, no
trumps, each trick taken by hearts counts

trick taken by clubs counts 4, each trick
taken by diamonds counts 6, each trick

thing on the card—between “Defeat' and
‘Robbery’?”
“What is it 2 ”
“‘ESCAPE.’ It can't be true, though.
Nobody ever gets away so early as ten.”
“No. It's just another way of play-
ing. If you score the odd trick you get
nothing and your partners get 7, and if
you score more than the odd trick each
side scores all tricks.”
“That's quite simple. Suppose we
score 8, then each side puts down 13
and nobody moves. That will be jolly,
if we get to a really comfortable table,
with nice people.”
“I don't think that’s quite what it
means,” said Mrs. Tarbut, doubtfully.
“Perhaps not. But we mustn't take
the rules too literally. For instance,
look at ‘Defeat.” “Whoever holds Queen
of Spades when game is finished loses
all tricks (no partners).' That's non-
sense, for if you lose all tricks you lose

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
In his new book, The History of Mr. Polly (NELson),
H. G. WELLs seems to have set out to do two things not
easily compatible: to present honestly a certain pitiful
phase of life, and to be funny at all costs. I would not
question his success in either effort; but the result of both
is this, that, when we have followed the career of his hero
from draper's to publican's assistant, through its varied
stages of shopkeeping, arson, and tramphood, and grate-
fully appreciated the author's fidelity to human nature,
in the end we are left with a suspicion that the whole
thing is a fantastic and even farcical caprice. The pathos
of a romantic nature struggling vainly against the banality
of its environment was too obvious and trite for Mr. WELLs;
so he invented, in Mr. Polly, a character who, for all his
yearning after the colour of life and the sound of high
phrases, remains so much a figure pour rire that the tragedy
of the contrast between what is and what might have been
is almost hopelessly lost in the absurdity of things. So
vague and futile is his ardour for expansion that it takes
him fifteen years of monotony with the dullest of women
in the dullest of shops to discover that you can “change
the world” by the simple process of burning down your
establishment, deserting your wife, and taking to the open
road with a light conscience. Mr. WELLs' attitude towards
his hero is no doubt sympathetic, but the chance of com-
municating this sympathy is sacrificed at times to a wilful
and persistent humour. Still, it was worth while, for he
has given us some extraordinarily good scenes of low
comedy; but some of his fun is rather forced (I could
seldom get a laugh out of Mr. Polly's verbal malapropisms),
and too often he relies, in the old-fashioned manner, upon
a wealth of epithets. Somewhere he tells us, incredibly,
that Mr. Polly had little taste for cheap fiction, because
“there was no epithet" in it. Of course Mr. Polly had not
heard of his author's own contribution to Messrs. NELSON's
admirable two-shillingsworths; but, even so, his views are
against common experience. -
Mrs. C. A. DAwson Scott, the author of Madcap Jane
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), has reversed the usual practice, and
treated a farcical theme in the manner of high comedy.
Jane was the new wife of Sir Julyan George, an elderly
widower; and Mrs. Scott wishes me to believe that her
heroine, having quarrelled with Sir Julyan, runs out of the
house and incontinently takes service as third housemaid
in the establishment of a pious neighbour, whom she had
offended at an afternoon call that very day, and who
happens moreover to be the first mother-in-law of her
husband. Also that she remains in this situation, un-
suspected by the autocratic Mrs. Angel, for the space of
three days. Well, frankly, I can't manage it. But the
skill with which the atmosphere and intrigues of the

which so wild an argument leads you to expect, you
presently find yourself among a collection of very real
human beings, in whose actions you must take an almost
breathless interest. At least, that is how I felt about
them. Of course, Madcap Jane being married already,
there could be no Young Marlow in this modern version of
She Stoops to Conquer (one of the footmen did look upon
her with an approving eye; but it came to nothing), and
the adventure ends, inevitably, with her restoration to the
arms of her adoring husband. I can only hope that other
people will be as sorry when this happens as I was myself.

well drawn as these lovers are, I was so exhausted with
hatred of the arch-villain that I had no emotion left in
reserve for them. Should your taste in villains be the
same as mine, I commend this novel to you.
Mr. H. B. MARRIOTT WATson describes his hero as
“Richard Ryder, otherwise Galloping Dick, sometime
Gentleman of the Road;" the publishers advertise him as
“a tobyman with a reckless, cheerful spirit and a generous
heart;" my own opinion of him is that he is a passably
good fellow with a most ingenious tongue and an amazing
gift of getting into and out of impossible scrapes; his rivals
and victims declare him to be “a swashbuckler,” “a tavern
knight,” “a gamecock,” “a bully captain,” “a rat that
would gnaw his betters,” “a windbag,” “a Beelzebub,” “a
belly-crawling, oath-mincing Southron,” and “a Bobadil."

Her own diet, by the way, seems to have consisted mainly
of whisky and tobacco. For the rest the book is chiefly
remarkable for the sane and breezy humour that we expect
from stories of the Dominion, and for a rather ultra-con-

with the emancipated behaviour and almost Shavian intelli-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MOOD OF CONCILIATION.
[The Daily Chronicle's Parliamentary Correspondent, while admitting
that “it is the duty of the Government of the day in a grave constitu-
tional struggle to exhaust all possible measures of conciliation before
unsheathing the sword,” says that “Liberal Members are asking
what their leaders can have to give away, and if there is nothing to
concede what possible good can come from a conference except to
conjure up illusive hopes.”]
IN really grave and pungent crises,
| Such as are apt to crease the patriot's brow
(And I suppose the dullest eye sees
That something of the sort is on just now),
Whoever truly loves his land,
Whose thoughts, like ours, are solely for the nation,
Is almost bound to take a hand
In pouring oil upon the situation.
A Government that knows its duty,
That has the finer conscience which can feel
A solemn, sacrificial beauty
In self-effacement for the common weal—
A Government, I say, like that,
Eager that Peace should stand secure and stable,
Will rightly call a parley at
A Round (or, anyhow, an Oval) Table.
So let us now proclaim a truce full
Of rosy promise for the public good,
One that (by Heaven's aid) should turn out useful,
But, be it very clearly understood,
Be it regarded as a cinch
That, though our appetite for Peace is hearty,
If anybody yields an inch
It won't be our side, not the Liberal Party.
We may assume the glove of velvet,
But, should the foeman show a naughty pride,
We shall not hesitate to shelve it
And loose at large the mailéd fist inside;
'Tis well, to wear a gentle cheer
And let our talk be sweet as sugar-candy,
But we must have our fighting-gear
Hung in the neighbouring cloak-room, nice and handy.
LOCAL COLOUR.
I once knew a man who was engaged in writing a novel.
There's nothing very surprising in that, of course. Lots
of men constantly write novels, and lots of other men go
on knowing them. The remarkable thing about this par-
ticular novel was that the scene of it was chiefly laid in the
Malay Peninsula. Garfield—let us call my novelist Gar-
field—had never been nearer than Yarmouth to the Malay
Peninsula, but he was very obstinate about it. He said
he wanted to describe the clash of civilisation and bar-
barism, and the consequent changes and developments in
various characters; and the Malay Peninsula, about which
he knew nothing, was the only place for him. Besides, he
said, he liked the sound of the name, and saw his way to
some tremendous situations which would make, his pub-
lisher and the public sit up. “If,” he continued, “I can
only get some of the real local colour—the place must be
simply chockful of it—I shall have letters from all the
present and retired Malayans in the Empire telling me how
marvellously true my descriptions of life in the Peninsula
are, and asking me how many years I spent there, and if
I'm any relation of the Garfield who suppressed a native
rising there in 1882.” Anyhow, he refused to abandon
the Malay Peninsula. Novelists are often like that.
Now at Brillstone-on-Sea, where both Garfield and I
happened to be spending some of the so-called summer
weeks, there was resident at this time a man called
Borden. A queer-looking party he was. His battered
panama was always cocked jauntily on his bald head; his
clothes were shabby. He had only two fingers on his right
hand; his walk was a curious mixture of a shuffle and a
swagger, and there were permanent traces of a somewhat
blood-shot youth in his face and eyes. I got to know him,
while Garfield was cooped up in his lodgings with his nose
to the grindstone of his novel, and one day I chanced to
mention to him that I had a friend who was busy on a book
destined to be immortal. • - - .
“One of those writing johnnies, hey 2”
“What's he writing about?” -
I said it was the Malay Peninsula. -
“Funny place to write about. I spent ten years there,
and—” - -
“You spent ten years there? - - * - - -
“Yes, more's the pity, ten blessed eternal years, and I
never thought there was anything to write about. All I
wanted was to get away from the mouldy place.” -
“Why, you're the very man,” said I. -
I then explained to him that Garfield required local
colour, and when he understood what local colour was he
undertook to supply it in buckets. “He’ll find that what
I can't tell him about it ain't worth writing about,” was
what he said. So I undertook to bring Garfield and Borden
together. - * .
said Borden.
When I told Garfield about this he was very enthusiastic.
He had been mugging up a great many books about the
Peninsula, but he said they didn't give him just those little
intimate touches that he wanted, and he thought he could,
get them from Borden. So Borden was asked to dine with
us at Garfield's lodgings—you know the kind of dinner;
fried sole with paste-sauce, beefsteak, and something called
lemon pudding. Garfield was very tactful with his guest.
He didn't want him to think he had been asked merely
from motives of self-interest. During the fish they talked
about London theatres, and Borden got off a long story
about an actor he knew twenty years ago. It wasn't until
the middle of the beefsteak that they started on the Malay
Peninsula.
“I hear,” said Garfield, “ you've been good enough to
promise to tell me something about the natives. I'm
writing a book, you know, about them.”
“Well,” said Borden contemplatively, “to tell you the
truth I never had more truck with the natives than I could
help-a rascally lot. I remember old Dick Tozer—you've
heard of him, of course, Dick Tozer of the Police, rum old
cock with one eye—I remember him getting hold of one
of the chiefs—quite a civilised chap, the chief: wore a top
hat and a pair of shepherd's plaid trousers, and took in
brandy as if it was swipes. Well, you couldn't beat Dick
for a yarn. He told me some of the best I ever heard.
There was one about his uncle and a broker's man. The
uncle rigged the broker's man up in a footman's livery and
made him wait at a dinner. That was in Chelsea. Not a
bad place, Chelsea. Poor old Dick | Cards settled him.
He couldn't keep off 'em.”
“I suppose,” said Garfield anxiously, “he couldn't play
cards much in Malacca 2"
“That,” said Borden, “is just where you're wrong. Not
play cards? Why, we started at ten o'clock one night and
we didn't get up till nine o'clock on the next morning but
one. There was Dick and myself, and old Cornford of the

Bodyguard, and Tom Harfield of the Education Department.
That was how I lost my fingers"—he held up his claw—
“fell over a doormat coming out in the morning and cut
my hand on the scraper. Blood-poisoning set in. Yes, it
does look as if I'd had 'em chopped off with a kris, but it
was only a rotten scraper.”
Garfield was beginning to be a little desperate. “As to
the seasons, now,” he said; “I suppose they're very
different from ours, aren't they?"
“I don't know,” said Borden. “All seasons are good
for a drink anywhere. That's what smashed up Tom—
that and the Government. They never know when they've
got a good man. Tom woke up one morning—no, I'm
wrong; he never woke in the morning; kept it till the
afternoon. Well, he woke up and found they'd put a mere
boy from Oxford over his head. You can't expect decent
fairness from a Government: they're all the same. Tom
never recovered from it. Got D.T. and went off in a day.
It's just the same here in England. Why, I’ve been at
the Colonial Office about once a week for five years now,
and a precious poor job I've made of it. They owe me
over a thousand back pension, and if I cared to throw in
my fingers I could make it up to fifteen hundred ; but I've
as much chance of getting it as I have of winning the
Derby.”
And that was practically all the local colour that we got
out of Borden. He talked till close upon midnight, and
I'm sure he thoroughly enjoyed himself. “Don’t mention
it,” he said to Garfield. “I’m only too glad to give a chap

that makes all the difference.” Garfield had to finish his
book as best he could, and Borden speaks of Kris and

Peninsula, and I put in all those bits for him "-which is
partly true.

I AM aweary of the frequent blob,
Sick of the fours that follow as I bowl
A length o'er which I cannot keep control,
And make the batsman's task an easy job.
His are the hefty smites that please the mob,
While I, whose “egg" remains for ever whole,
Would find a “single” soothing to a soul
That shrinks in terror from the merest lob.
Oh, waft me where (if such a place exist)
Each ball is pitched securely off the stumps,
Where catches are invariably missed,
And I can safely make my favourite clumps;
There, when my century at last is won,
Put me on bowling in a rabbit run.

A CORRESPONDENCE WHICH WENTWRONG.
1. LITERARY NotE.
“INSPIRED by the success of those
recently published books, Letters to a
Salmon Fisher's Son and Letters of a
Modern Golfer, a well-known firm of
publishers will bring out in August a
realistic work on the same lines, by
Mr. SAMUEL WITHERs, entitled Letters
to a Porcupine - Hunter's Nephew, in
which will be found set out in genial
form the whole art of Porcupine hunt-
ing; interwoven, for the sake of the
ladies, with a charming and entrancing
love story. One of the most delightful
characters in the book is Stanley
Mertens, the recipient of the letters...”
II. THE LETTERs.
MY DEAR STANLEY,+It is a long
time since you had a letter from me,
but I have been so busy writing to
another of my friends, a certain Lionel
Blathers, whose second cousin plays
water polo for Wiltshire—(Letters to a
Water Polo Player's Second Cousin,6]-)
—that I have scarcely had time to
think of you at all. Now at last I
have a few months to spare, and I
cannot doubt that you will be glad to
hear from such an old friend of your
uncle's as 1 am. But what, I ask
myself, shall I write to you about?
Your uncle, as you cannot fail to be
aware, was one of the greatest sports-
men of his age. Equally agile in the
pursuit of the jerboa, the dromedary
and the mountain goat, his most
superlative skill was shown in his
dealings with the porcupine. It
occurs to me that a few hints to you
upon his methods, such as may lead
you eventually to emulate his skill and
equal his reputation, may be of service;
for I assume that your ambitions, too,
have always lain in this direction.
I shall write to you, then, from day
to day, putting down such scraps of
advice as occur to me, and discussing
any points which you may care to
make in reply. I do not, however,
insist that you should answer my
letters; I should go on writing just
the same however impenetrable your
silence—a duty which I owe not only
to you but to my publishers. But, of
course, I should welcome any criticism,
if you see fit to make it.
One word more. In case you should
find the reiteration of sporting techni-
cality wearisome I have decided to
introduce into these letters from time
to time the story of my very latest
love affair; hoping that in this way your
zeal for big-game and your passion for
romance may equally be stirred.
Your affectionate friend,
SAMUEL WITHERs.
DEAR STANLEY, You will be sur-
prised at hearing from me so soon—
that is until you get used to it; but
you understand that if I am to make a
book of these letters by the beginning
of August, I must write to you every
dav.
} have been thinking over what you
said in your last—what I mean, you
would have said if there had been time
for a reply—and I have come to the
conclusion that where you are wrong
in your method of catching porcupines
is in your carelessness. If they are to
be tickled successfully they must be
tickled in the right place—at the back
of the neck where the quills are short;
and you must exercise discretion in your
selection of a victim. SHAKSPEARE speaks
of the “fretful porcupine,” and some of
them are very fretful. These should
be stroked with care or you will find
that much of them will “come away
in the hand,” as the expression is. All
the same, having once made a start
you should continue. Your dear uncle
always used to say that it is better to
bear those quills we have than fly to
others that we know not of.
Speaking of this reminds me that I
was introduced to a most charming
girl last night. Henrietta – it is a
pretty name, I think. Am I in love?
I can hardly say as yet.
Yours ever, SAMUEL WITHERs.
MY DEAR Boy, I am afraid I can-
not take your telegram seriously. You
must want to hear all about porcupine
hunting. There is simply nobody else
left to whom I can write about it.
Blathers made himself impossible over
the last book, when he claimed half
the profits on the ground that he had
had to give the postman an extra large
gratuity at Christmas. Of course, if
you really don't care a if, I mean,
you are really not interested in the
porcupine, I am only too ready to talk
about some other branch of sport. Have
you any feeling for hippopotami or silk-
worms? Your dear uncle had a way
with these that I have never seen
equalled. He used to take them be-
tween the finger and thumb (I am
referring now to the silkworms) and
transfer them to his collecting box with
an imperturbable calm.
If you don't take any interest in any
animals, for Heaven's sake and that
of my publishers at least keep silence
about it. I can go on writing with
practically no encouragement at all,
but I cannot put up with a flow of in-
sulting opposition. Let me therefore
beg you as a favour to remain passive
in the matter. In return for this I
will, if you like, insert your photograph
in my book as a frontispiece. I had,
of course, intended to put my own—

DEAR MERTENs, I was disgusted by
the brutality and profanity of your re-
peated messages to me yesterday. For
Some time I considered whether I
should not punish you by ceasing to
write to you, though I felt that this
would perhaps be rather a severe line
to take. After consultation with cer-
tain friends in the publishing business
in whom I have implicit confidence,
I have decided to go on with this cor-
respondence; but in future I shall
write from the point of view of a
modern athlete, assuming you to be
as interested in the game of Halma as
I am. The Letters of a Modern Halma
Player, in this case, may be looked for
in September, and I am sure you will
be proud even to take only a sleeping
part in the great work. º
To-morrow, then, I shall give you a
short account of the history of the
game, and at the same time recom-
mence the story of my little love affair
with the captivating Henrietta.
Yours sincerely,
SAMUEL WITHERs.
SIR,-Kindly return me my letters
at once. S. WITHERs.

THE ANNIHILATOR OF ANEGDOTES.
MIDw1NTER, the man with whom I
share chambers, is a very good fellow,
manly, straightforward and extremely
sane. But he has the defects of
his qualities. He is unimaginative,
severely logical and altogether steeped
in dry light. One of his peculiarities is
the rooted conviction that all anecdotes
are apocryphal. Personally I have a
weakness for anecdotes and cling to
my belief in their veracity. But most
of them have been pulverised by his
analysis. For example, the other night
we were talking about the inconsi-
derateness of railway travellers, and in
a moment of expansion I started out
on a story about SoTHERN père, the
creator of Dundreary.
“SoTHERN arrived at a London Ter-
minus one night just as the train was
starting, and was bundled into a com-
partment with one other occupant.
This gentleman, it appeared, had
specially engaged the compartment for
himself, and was extremely indignant at
his privacy being disturbed. SoTHERN
expressed his regret most courteously,
explaining how important it was for
him to catch the train, and how he
never had the slightest intention of
trespassing on the privacy of a stranger,
and so on; but the other man refused
to be mollified. On the contrary, he
continued to make the most injurious
and offensive remarks about SotherN's
behaviour. This SoTHERN stood for a
while without saying anything, but at
last he jumped up, lifted his dressing-
bag down from the rack, opened it,
took out a razor and began stropping
it with feverish energy. The stranger
dried up in a moment, and hurriedly
quitted the compartment at the first
stop, leaving SoTHERN in undisturbed
possession. Of course the other man
took him for a maniac. Rather smart
of SoTHERN, wasn’t it?”
“No,” said Midwinter; “extremely
idiotic, I think.”
“Why?"
“Well, to begin with, if the other
man had engaged the compartment,
the railway people would never have
put SOTHERN into it. However, that's a
mere trifle. But about that razor. If
the other man really thought SoTHERN
was mad, he would have grappled with
him, if he was a fool. And if he
wasn't he would have humoured him
until the train stopped and then quietly
informed the railway authorities. In
that case SotherN would have been
collared and locked up, instead of being
left in undisturbed possession of the
No, it won't work, your
story. Besides, SoTHERN probably used
a safety razor.”

“My dear Midwinter,” I exclaimed,
“SoTHERN died in 1882, long before
safety razors were invented.”
“SoTHERN,” replied Midwinter, who
has a diabolical memory for dates,
“acted in the United States from 1852
to 1860, and I am pretty sure that the
first patent for safety razors was taken
out there in 1858.”
Not having a hardware encyclopædia
handy I went to bed.

I Joined the Territorials; I saw the need was great;
And here the chance was ready to my hand
To learn to play the citizen, to hold a rifle straight,
And win the right to serve my native land.
My leisure was but little, but I did what in me lay,
While Dick and Tom and Harry wandered free;
My holidays were labour, labour, labour all the way,
hile they were idly loafing by the sea.
They didn't see their duty, or they thought it well to shirk
The trouble and the discipline behind;
They knew—if they did nothing—there was none to make
them work,
When I–who did do something—might be fined.
They hugged their independence, as the Briton only can ;
Their freedom, which was far too dear to touch;
Forgetting that a citizen may be a better man
For learning to behave himself as such.
But I, the Territorial, said, those can laugh that win;
For if the time should come—as come it might—
When Britons have to battle for their country or their skin,
They'll neither have the power—nor the right.
E
I've left the Territorials. A little while ago,
The notice of a billet caught my eye;
I entered for the job, but the employer answered, “No:
For Territorials need not apply.”
He owned that we had merits. But for purposes of trade -
He liked a man of more pacific stamp,
Who didn't ask for Saturdays and evenings for parade,
And didn't want an extra week in camp.
He'd take us on—and willing—if his rivals did the same;
But competition kept him on the run;
And Harry, Tom and Dick must have priority of claim
Till all were Territorials, or none.

I'm not a Territorial. I tried to do my best.
But, though I'm just as loyal as before,

Till Tom and Dick and Harry do their duty with the rest,
I'll be a Territorial no more.

Will never lack employers to select him;
But gets the very billet from the patriotic hand
That loses it by learning to protect him. DUM-DUM.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Wednesday,
June 8.—There is a fine restraint
about House of Commons that endears
it to looker-on. Met to-day under mem-
orable circumstances. Since we parted
for what was planned as brief Spring
holiday, great things have happened.
KING EDwARD is dead and a fifth KING
GEORGE has come to the Throne. Only
a week or two before adjournment the
alert presence of the then PRINCE of
WALEs surveyed scene from Gallery
over Clock. Next time he appears on
parliamentary stage he will take his
place on the Throne.
Meanwhile men's minds full of con-
cern as to next move in game for
high stakes opened last year between
the two Houses. When will the Veto
Resolutions be taken 2 What will the
Lords do with them 2 What will follow
thereupon?
: These are questions Members meet-
ing in the Lobby or the reading-rooms
leagerly put to each other. The public
intently listens, at the door; . Reas:
isembling of Parliament looked forward
to with certainty that a sign would be
forthcoming. The PREMIER expected
to make statement indicating course of
public business. Between its lines we
should surely read how matters stand.
Thus the environment of the scene.
On the stage itself scarcely any move-
ment; certainly no turmoil; pretty
full attendance, but no cheering or
counter-cheering. The PREMIER enters
unnoticed. PRINCE ARTHUR does not
think occasion sufficiently important to
claim his attendance. In his absence
HARRY CHAPLIN gracefully drops into
seat of LEADER OF OPPosition and
regards show through single eye-glass.
A pair would, you know, be making too
much of it.
SPEAKER having read judgments upon
election petitions, we take our coats off
and get to business. First, we read a
third time the Charnwood Forest Rail-
way Bill. Next we pass through final
stage the Farnham Gas Electricity Bill
and eke the South Hants Water Bill.
For a moment there seemed prospect
of equable stream of legislation being
ruffled by a breeze. ALPHEUS CLEoPHAs,
rising from unfamiliar back seat, pro-
posed to offer a few observations.
Whether they related to the affairs of
Charnwood, Farnham or South Hants
no man knoweth. House did not desire
to hear ALPHEUs on any subject, and
unmistakably indicated lack of desire.
CLEOPHAs showed disposition to insist.
Storm rose to angry height; after brief
struggle ALPHEUS CLEOPHAs bent his
head before it.
Thereupon House read a third time
. Standard Life Assurance Company
Bill.
Above crowd at Bar waiting to
be sworn in, head and shoulders of
Owen PHILIPPs, Chairman of Royal Mail
Steamship Company, towered. Since
House last met he has bought another
fleet. 'Tis his custom of an afternoon.
On the average pays a million-and-a-
half sterling for goods received.
“My dear PHILIPPs,” said CHARLIE
BERESFORD, looking up to him as if he
were a mainmast that might presently
be swarmed, “there's only one thing
left for you. You must buy the British
fleet.”
“Odd you should mention it,” said
Sir Owen. “To tell you the truth, I
had been thinking of it. If the deal
comes off I'll ask you to take com.
mand.”
“Done with you,” said CHARLIE,
hitching up a pair of trousers preter.
naturally wide over the foot.
Business done. — Parliament reas-
sembled after Spring Recess.
Thursday.—Both Houses met again
to-day. Gravely proceeded to do busi-
ness as if nothing had happened out-
side or was in process of happening.
A poor make-believe not long kept up.
The Lords, approaching Orders of the
Day at 4.30, adjourned at 4.35. Shut-
ters up in the Commons at 25 minutes
to 6.
Meanwhile JAM MAcDoNALD had
buttonholed SEELY on subject of sub-
sidised bananas. Alleged that, in spite
of subsidy of £20,000 a year paid to
steam-fleet owners, Jamaica bananas
drifted to the broad bosom of the
United States, leaving England forlorn.
SEELY pleaded things weren't quite
so bad as that. Ministerial crisis averted
only by promise that before contract is
renewed House shall have opportunity
for fully discussing it.
All this done with delightful gravity,
as if no one knew anything of the talk
that fills the crowded Lobby, that
throbs through the Tea-room and
hurtles over the Terrace. All about a
Conference in course of arrangement,
designed to avert battle-royal between
Lords and Commons on Veto Question.
“Very nice indeed,” said MEMBER
For SARK, peeling one of the bananas
SEELY sent round by way of additional
rejoinder to MACDoNALD's attack upon
Colonial Office, “but I'm old enough
to remember the Round Table Confer-
ence that took place 24 years ago, with
SQUIRE of MALwood presiding. It was
designed to bring DoN José back to the
GLADSTONE fold. What I don't re-
member is his return.”

been killed by kindness.

“Not long ago a party of ststesmen—it seems

Perhaps our contemporary would kindly
give us a hint as to the fashionable way
of pronouncing this word “ststesmen.”

AT THE PLAY.
“GLAss Houses.”
IF Smith Tertius were asked to trans-
late “Connais-toi,” and gave the
answer “ Glass houses,” he would al-
most certainly receive correction on
the ground that his rendering was too
free. Mr. KENNETH BARNES, who is
grown up, has a perfect right to take
liberties with his French original, but
I do think he ought to be required to
attach the right meaning to an English
copy-book phrase. Most of us have
been taught to believe
that the proverb about
people who live in glass
houses can only mean
that those who are them-
selves vulnerable (in a
moral sense, for instance)
should be careful how
they attack the faults of
others. Yet this is not the
main idea in Mr. BARNEs’s
play. General Sir Paul
Carteret, apart from a little
habit of brusqueness, has
no vices to make him vul-
nerable. He cherishes strict
views, in the abstract, about
conjugal infidelity (whether
of thought or deed) and
the proper treatment of
erring wives. In a case
that is brought before his
notice he recommends that
the woman should be
treated as an outcast, and
that the “officer and gen-
tleman” who compromised
her should make the only
possible amends by mar-
riage. When the “officer
and gentleman" turns out
to be his own son, he
modifies his views. The
woman is still to be an
outcast, but the co-re-
spondent is not to sully
himself by marriage with
so contemptible a person. Later still
he finds his own wife unfaithful (in
thought only), and his views are still
further modified in favour of reconcilia-
tion, after the reflection that he might
have been a gentler husband. All this
merely illustrates the obvious truth that
we are apt to readjust our abstract
opinions as the personal element enters
more and more deeply into the concrete
case. The original play may have been
well suited with the title Connais-toi,
but the adaptation has very little to do
with a conservatory.
The play is one of those familiar
comedies which become really tragic
when one pictures the state of things
that is bound to ensue after everything
has been temporarily cleared up against
the fall of the curtain. Not that I
cared a brass button what became of
any one of the characters. I took at
first a fleeting interest in . Captain
O'Brien (played by Mr. NoFMAN TREvoR
with a most determined immobility),
but after he had been wrongly suspected
of being a villain and then wrongly
suspected of being a hero, I took no
further interest in his career.

whose tragic emotions I am expected
to find a poignant interest. Everybody
in this play seemed to be a protagonist.
The whole cast (always barring the
butler, a negligible figure) consisted
either of illegitimate lovers or injured
husbands. Even for a military station
(on the stage) this seems in excess of the
average. Then, again, I was disturbed
by the medley of English and French
sentiments. Your Frenchman takes
his cocu lightly; your Englishman is
serious over a breach of the marriage-
covenant; and the audience was invited
to be dispassionate and assume both
attitudes in turn.
Mr. NorMAN TREvor.
Miss VioleT WANBRUGH.
The dialogue did not do much to
relieve matters. I can only recall one
happy phrase, where Mr. BourcHTER
remarks, “If I've said anything that
I'm sorry for, I'm glad.” But he had
given us this very phrase only the
other day in Parasites. I don't know
if he deliberately retained it as a pious
souvenir of the past. Certainly there
were moments which were reminiscent
of his farcical manner in that unfortu-
nate failure. For the rest his acting
was very sound. Miss WIoLET WAN-
BRUGH’s performance as Lady Carteret
showed nice feeling: but, as with Mr.
GEORGE ALEXANDER, I could wish that
she would confine herself
to light comedy, where
regular employment might
be found for the smile which
it costs her so much to
repress. Mr. BEALBY was
rather amusing in his
anxiety to get the right
advice from the head of the
family as to the proper line
of conduct for an outraged
husband. But Miss MURIEL
BEAUMONT found little to
suit her (except her gowns)
in the part of this gentle-
man's erratic wife. She
looked much too healthy
and honest.

man. - The trapper ought somehow

down anyhow, and so this point of
irony was lost. But as a mere study
in the Grand Guignol manner the
little sketch was not ineffective. Miss
MAY HollanD was a very passable
low-comedy gossip, and Miss DAISY
MARKHAM as the girl Nell, her heart
torn between loyalty to her man and
the horror of sharing in his crime,
played her tragic part with a nice
discretion. - - O. S.

CROEsus
“A Fiven for youn Tiloughts, NURSE.”
JUNIOR.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
DoRSET is not, I believe, one of the first-class cricket
counties. But, to judge from some of the novels of Mr.
THoMAs HARDY and “M. E. FRANcis,” in the sterner game
of life, in which the implements are not bats and balls, but
love and jealousy and sudden death, its rustics must be
well in the running for championship honours. The Wild
Heart (SMITH, ELDER), Mrs. FRANcis BLUNDELL's new
book, touches the same note of tragedy as Far from the
Madding Crowd. It begins with a manslaughter and ends
with a murder, all because a many years ago certain long-
tailed birds were introduced into Europe from the neigh-
bourhood of the river Phasis, since when they have had
their revenge by bringing many a promising youth to the
gallows. They did not quite do that for David Chant, of the
wild heart, but one shining night he was so unlucky as to
kill a keeper who would otherwise have brained one of his
fellow-poachers, and got twenty years' penal servitude as
his share of the bag. Within a few months he was an
escaped convict with a price upon his head, and three years
later returned to his native village, disguised in a beard and
a false name, and married the girl-farmer who had helped
him to escape. Then, unluckily for them both, just when
he was beginning to yearn once more for the delights of
poaching, the widow of the man that he had killed guessed
his secret, and in a fit of jealous rage, because he had
refused her offer of her heart and hand, first betrayed him
to the police, and then, to save trouble, with her own fair
hand pulled the trigger that stilled the beating of his wild
heart. The story, though its plot may sound melodramatic,
is told in the quiet pastoral manner which Mrs. BLUNDELL
has made her own.
Before we start bone-picking, let it be clearly understood
that The Heart of Marylebone (HUTCHINson) is no amateur
story of North-Western love, but an expert study, subtly
developed and most ably written, of husbands and wives
and even third parties in health and in sickness. Leila Gay-
thorne (even if she was a Celt, she need not have shouted
so much about the Celtic merit) and Henry Palmerston,
whose manners are so exquisite as almost to have eliminated
his manhood, marry in haste and fall in love at leisure.
Mrs. D'Arcy Wauw and Captain Vandaleur love each other all
the time, but are married, as ill luck will have it, otherwise.
Sickness brings Leila on the one hand, and the Captain on
the other, to a nursing home in Marylebone, and from that
point of vantage their respective situations are reviewed by
themselves, their nurses, their doctor, and their anonymous
author, “HANDASYDE.” All hold bright and diverse views
on love and the other emotions as they should be, and
express the same in a manner most attractive and con-
vincing. Now for the bones. I suggest that a little more
movement is needed to justify a novel of three hundred and
forty closely printed pages. I deny respectfully that the
Scot, with all his virtues, is quite the paragon of quick
imagination and perfect understanding that he is here said
to be. I assert positively that, when “Sheridan” furniture

is mentioned, something else is meant. There are, besides,
a thousand moot points in the book; but that, perhaps, is
its charm. It makes you think and pine for discussion.
Yet, however argumentative you may be, you will not
dispute the warm tribute paid to the personal devotion as
well as technical skill of the medical profession, a tribute
richly deserved and long overdue.
Anna and Astrid Avelan, the heroines of Mr. PAUL
WAINEMAN's new novel, The Wife of Nicholas Fleming
(METHUEN), resembled each other so closely that even their
own mother could scarcely tell them apart. It was there-
fore not to be wondered at that Count Nicholas Fleming, a
Finnish nobleman with more money than intelligence,
after falling in love with Amma, should commit the pardon-
able error of marrying Astrid. One morning, however, the
two sisters happened to go down to the sea-shore for
a swim. Astrid confided her wedding-ring to her sister,
while she practised some high diving, and in a momen-
tary absence of mind Anna slipped it on to her own
finger. Scarcely had
cleverness of the author is undiminished. Indeed the great
singer, Margarethe Styr, and several of the minor cha.
racters are drawn with such brilliant skill that I am
reluctant to say that from my masculine point of view the
hero, John Ordham, is thoroughly contemptible and unin-
teresting. Ordham's fascinating manners failed to fascinate
me, and as-until nearly the end of the book—he seemed
unable to show any durable feeling except hatred of his
elder brother and his young wife I longed very sincerely
to kick him. He was fortunate, perhaps, in spending
nearly all his time with feminine admirers, but I wish that
we had been given more opportunity to see what men
thought of him. While recognising the remarkable ability
with which parts of Towers of Ivory are written, I cannot
recommend the book to the squeamish. In the description
of Munich society Mrs. ATHERTON might, on one occasion,

A DREAM OF PLAIN WOMEN.
[Mrs. CARL MEYER, responding to the toast of “Fair Women” at
the Grafton Galleries, is alleged to have stated that all women in their
hearts colsider that they ought to be classed under that category.]
How many women, far from fair,
I have observed and wondered why
f They challenged with a conquering air
The homage of the passer-by ; -
Or else assumed a modest mien,
Shunning with shy averted glances
The outrage of a gaze too keen,
Too full of vernal fancies.
Untouched I've sauntered through the spell
And kept my eye serene and cold,
Having no flattering tale to tell,
No hint of ardour overbold;
And still the marvel grew and grew
Why women, built with hopeless faces,
Won't rest content to worry through
With just the moral graces.
But now I know. By instinct taught
The homeliest woman likes to think
(The wish is mother to the thought)
That she is beauteous as a pink;
From this obsession all in vain
Her bosom-friends conspire to free her,
She will not see herself as plain
As other people see her.
Ah! Harriet, you remember how
I overlooked your lack of charms,
Ignored your narrow spotted brow,
Your tilted nose, your tawny arms;
Moved by the ſate that marred your life
(And Love is Pity's near relation),
I meant to let you be my wife
By way of mitigation.
But if, of course, by Nature's light
You felt that beauty from you shone
Almost too perilously bright
For naked orbs to gaze upon,
I see exactly why you sniffed,
Treating the golden chance like pewter,
Gave to your nose an extra lift,
And lost a priceless suitor.

“William,” said I, “this is a matter of extreme delicacy
and importance. The great text-books of the law are
silent on the point and give me no advice, so I turn to you.
I am about to engage a cook. There is an applicant for
the post. She has written to me and F have written back.
I should have liked to engage her without further to-do,
but I am told that a preliminary interview is essential.
Under pressure I have made an appointment for four
o'clock this afternoon. It is now a quarter to, and I am
still in complete ignorance on all matters domestic, menial,
economical, purveyoral and culinary. What shall I say
to her ?”
“Ask her, Sir,” said William, simply,–" ask her if she
can cook.”
THE AVERAGE-ADJUSTER. :
SoMEHow his appearance seemed quite familiar to me,
but for the life of me I couldn't say where I had met him
before. There was a curious look in his face—something
which struck me as being both indefinite and universal. It
didn't make any one special impression, but seemed to be
trying to make all sorts of impressions at the same time.
His clothes were of no particular age or cut. Nondescript
clothes, I should call them. He wore a bowler hat, a black
tie and a pair of brown lace-up boots. During the whole
of our conversation, which, by the way, took place in the
Strand, he was smoking a briarwood pipe, or, rather, his
pipe was always going out, and he was continually light-
ing it again. He must have spent at least fifty woodeh
matches in ten minutes. - . . . !
It all began with the blowing off of my hat. He was
good enough to capture it and restore it to me. ,
“Pray don't mention it,” he said when I thanked him.
“If it hadn't been yours it would have had to be mine.”
“What do you mean?” said I. -
“Well, you see,” he answered, “our people are compiling
statistics about hats for a private investigator, and if there
hadn't been one more hat blown off in the Strand at this
very moment, all his tables would have been wrong. I
was ordered to watch, and if somebody else's hat hadn't
been taken mine would have had to go. It had to be an
actual hat: we never fake our results.
“You’ve done me a good turn to-day—nothing makes a
man more ridiculous than running after his own hat—so I
don't mind telling you who we are and how we work. Our
people are Average-Adjusters, the greatest organisation in
the world. There's nothing in America to match it. They
don't know everything over there, not by long chalks.
How do we work? Well, I'll give you an example. I
daresay you’ve noticed paragraphs giving an account of
the things left by passengers in railway carriages—so many
umbrellas, so many handkerchiefs, so many babies' feeding-
bottles, so many cuckoo-clocks, etc. Then there’s a state-
ment of the total number of passengers carried by all
the companies, and from that they calculate the forget-
fulness per thousand. Most of it's our doing. We work
for the companies, of course. Last year, for instance, they
wanted something striking, so we had two hundred of our
best men told off to litter the rolling stock of the United
Kingdom with dogs, pictures, mowing machines, kangaroos,
musical boxes, boots, bangles and purses stuffed full of
sovereigns. We were at it for a week. There was an article
about the whole thing in The Moonbeam. You wrote it,
did you? Well, I couldn't have done it better myself.
“I daresay you've wondered why the consumption of
beer and spirits has been going down. No, it isn't the
Budget: it’s our organisation. Two of our Directors have
turned teetotalers, and the consequence is all the employés
have had orders to give up alcohol and drink water or dry
ginger-ale. You can't cut off a couple of hundred thousand
steady drinkers without making a difference. I forget the
exact decrease in gallons per head of the population per
annum, but it's something pretty substantial. Personally
I don't like the change. My imagination doesn't seem to
work so well on ginger ale; but I daresay it's a good thing,
take it all round.
“Then there are the traffic accidents. We do a lot in
that; it's one of our best lines. Not the deaths, you know
—we don't touch them, except now and then on very

THE PENALTY OF GENIUS.
(An Interview in the grudging manner of
Mr. Bram Stoker.)
SIR GULLIVER Stodge, who on Sun-
day entered his sixtieth year, was sitting
in the picturesque pagoda in his garden
at Edgingham, the residential suburb
of Brumchester, wherein he often works
when the weather is fine. Contrariwise,
when the weather is inclement, he
prefers to exercise his mighty brain in
the seclusion of his own
sanctum. The day being
somewhat chilly, Sir Gulliver
wore a heavy “caped
Munster” coat. But his
cloth cap had been laid aside
and revealed the noble pro-
portions of his superb .
bellum in all their opulent
immensity. Sir Gulliver
Stodge is a huge man—even
huger than I am. Six feet
three inches he stands in his
stocking vamps, to use a
picturesque Hibernianism
pardonable in one who has
made a special study of
vampires, and he is strongly
built, though not fat. His
general appearance im-
presses, carries conviction
with it; but his head is
Olympian. It is a massive
cupola, high and broad and
long, with all the great
phrenological faculties seem-
in gly well developed.
Naturally with a man of
such deep study he is rather
bald ; what hair remains is
fine and close-growing. His
features are somewhat mas-
sive, as becomes the great-| –
ness of both body and mind.

il streaked with white and
grey, conveying the im-
pression of , a colossal
humanised magpie, endowed
with preternatural sagacity.
and finally settled at Chowbent, where
Sir Gulliver first honoured the light.
Since then his life has been one
long carnival of transcendental intel-
lectuality. Indeed, it is hard to under-
stand how a man who has launched
the new Brumchester University on
its dizzy career of prosperity could ever
have found time for such a constant
succession of strenuous mental efforts.
He is interviewed on an average three
times a day. Casts of his head are

gorgeous peacock, waking strange
echoes with his strident voice. Two
tall, beautiful young daughters, straight
as lances, sprint gracefully across the
lawn to their handsome mother who is
picking a bunch of flowers. The air is
full of music; thrush, blackbird, night-
ingale, peacock, owl and chiff-chaffinch
sing emulously, and their pellucid
piping seems to give resonance, and
flavour to the far-off roll of wheels on
the roadway beyond the belt of beech
and flowering alder. Some-
how eye and ear alike yield
themselves in this cosmic
background to the thoughts
of the great student of the
mysteries of life and nature.
I must premise the record
of our conversation by stating
that though in places I try
to give Sir Gulliver's actual
words, it must be under-
stood that I aim at the
general effect of the conver-
sation produced upon myself.
“I notice,” I said, “that in
your book, Subliminal Swith-
erings, you state that the
conjugation in very great
masses of conglutinative
gladiobes conduces to apla-
natic as well as contrapuntal
modifications of the medulla
oblongata. Are we to take it
that the centrifugal conscious-
ness exerts a reciprocal action
on the metatarsal bascules?”
He assented with a grave
nod of his Olympian occiput.
“Then,” I queried, “if
memory and individuality
remain, and if in virtue of
your claim of sentience for
the grouping of groups, the
collocation of atoms can be
indefinitely postulated, are
we not already on the way to
produce at will an astral
body?”
“Pardon me,” interjeated
the bulbous-browed philo-
This magpie simile, by the
way, never occurred to BEGBIE, who
once also did his worst with Sir
Gulliver. It is there that I get the
bulge on the saponaceous HAROLD.
Sir Gulliver's grandfather, who had
twenty-four children, was, domiciled
for several years in Co. Tipperary,
famous for its big men, but Lemuel
Stodge outbulked them all. He was
six feet eight in height, weighed thirty
stone and wore a number nine hat.
The epithet “stodgy,” Sir Gulliver
assures me, was first coined to desig-
nate the massive and monumental
corpus of his eminent ancestor. Ulti-
mately the Stodges migrated to Bootle,
taken almost hourly, and there are
times when the click of the camera,
snapshotting his Olympian features and
his wonderful magpie beard, is heard
continuously from morn till dewy eve.
Now, as he sits in his garden-house
looking out over the emerald lawn, all
glistening with late rain, with fine trees
and luxuriant shrubs budding every-
where and flowers in rich profusion, it
is hard to realise that this serene, big-
browed man is talking of things of
which the very thought is still in a
state of inchoate semi-adumbration in
the untrodden limbo of the future.
Over the wet grass walks daintily a
sopher, gently agitating his
massive dome of anything but
silence, “I didn't use the expres-
sion ‘grouping the group.’ Such a
process is only fit for astral acrobats.
What I do assert is that we are each
of us only a part of a larger personality
than is here displayed—of a bigger

“A bigger You,” I exclaimed in a
fit of abject incredulity. “Why, Sir

some three-quarters of an hour, I placed

figure less than a third that which is
asked for the well-known brands. Our
substitute for champagne, which we
have called “Weuve Groseille,” is a
perfectly pure product of fermented
fruit, and so skilfully is it compounded
that blindfolded experts have been
utterly at a loss to detect which was
the imitation and which the (so-called)
real. We do not claim that a gourmet
would not be deceived; but for all
practical purposes “Weuve Groseille”
does the trick. We can offer it at 24/–

DEAR MADAM, -You may not per-
haps have seen a recent number of The
Medical Journal, in which
attention is called to a new and subtle
danger of domestic life, the irritation
to the lungs caused by inhaling minute
particles of pungent dust that arise
from the canister whenever a spoonful
of tea is taken out. So fine as to be
almost imperceptible, this dust is none
the less a violent irritant, and many a
cook and parlour-maid, and even lady
of the house, have suffered in conse-
quence, all unconscious of the insidious
cause.
Taking this serious matter into con-
sideration, as also the high price of
tea, we have placed upon the market
a perfectly satisfactory substitute for
the famous and fragrant, but dutiable
and dusty, Chinese herb, which will be
known, we trust, in every family in
the United Kingdom as “Cad-Ton "
(Caddy Tonic), a product of natural
growth which, however, while smelling
like tea and looking like and tasting
like tea, contains no tannin, does not
unduly excite the nerves, makes no
poisonous dust, and, being non-dutiable,
can be sold for sixpence a pound and
still yield a just margin of profit to all
grocers.
Trusting that the enclosed ounce
sample will give you joy,
We remain, Yours hopefully,
& Co.

From a letter in The Daily Chronicle:
“A clergyman once complained to me that
nine-tenths of his parishioners went away from
Saturday to Monday, one-fifth of the remaining
tenth took advantage of the Sunday trips, one-
fifth remained at home, and the remainder
made up the congregation. I am glad to say
there are some exceptions. Fortune guided
my steps past the Carmelite Church last
Sunday. . . .”
That, we gather, is the complaint.
PAT-BALL.
“You 'LL play tennis?” said m
hostess absently. “That's right. Let
me introduce you to Miss–er—um.”
“Oh, we’ve met before,” smiled
Miss—I've forgotten the name again
now. a
“Thank you,” I said gratefully. I
thought it was extremely nice of her to
remember me. Probably I had spilt
lemonade over her at a dance, and in
some way the incident had fixed itself
in her mind. We do these little things,
you know, and think nothing of them
at the moment, but all the time
“Smooth,” said a voice.
I looked up and found that a pair of
opponents had mysteriously appeared,
and that my partner was leading the
way on to the court. \
-“I’ll take the right-hand side, if you
don't mind,” she announced. “Oh,
and what about apologising?” she
went on. “Shall we do it after every
stroke, or at the end of each game, or
when we say good-bye, or never? I
get so tired of saying ‘sorry.’”
“Oh, but we shan't want to apolo-
gise ; I'm sure we're going to get on
beautifully together.”
“I suppose you've played a lot this
summer ?”
“No, not at all yet, but I'm feeling
rather strong, and I've got a new
racquet. One way and another, I
expect to play a very powerful game.”
Our male opponent served. He had
what I should call a nasty swift ser-
vice. The first ball rose very suddenly
and took my partner on the side of the
head. (“Sorry,” she apologised. “It’s
all right,” I said magnanimously.) I
returned the next into the net; the
third clean bowled my partner; and off
the last I was caught in the slips.
(One, love.)
“Will you serve 2" said Miss–I
wish I could remember her surname.
Her Christian name was Hope or
Charity or something like that; I know,
when I heard it, I thought it was just
as well. If I might call her Miss Hope
for this once? Thank you.
“Will you serve?” said Miss Hope.
In the right-hand court I use the
American service, which means that I
never know till the last moment which
side of the racquet is going to hit the
ball. On this occasion it was a dead
heat—that is to say, I got it in between
with the wood; and the ball sailed
away over beds and beds of the most
beautiful flowers.
“Oh, is that the American service?”
said Miss Hope, much interested.
“South American,” I explained.

else.”

being pressed; it went to the shop
yesterday to have the creases taken
out. Don't you find that with a new
racquet you—er—exactly.”
In the third game we not only got
the ball over but kept it between the
white lines on several occasions— I
though not so often as our opponents
(three, love); and in the fourth game
Miss Hope served gentle lobs, while I,
at her request, stood close up to the
net and defended myself with my
racquet. I warded off the first two
shots amidst applause (thirty, love), and
dodged the next three (thirty, forty),
but the last one was too quick for me
and won the cocoa-nut with some ease.
(Game. Love, four.)
“It’s all right, thanks,” I said to my
partner; “it really doesn't hurt a bit.
Now then, let's buck up and play a
simply dashing game.” -
Miss Hope excelled herself in that
fifth game, but I was still unable to find
a length. To be more accurate, I was
unable to find a shortness—my long
game was admirably strong and lofty.
“Are you musical?” said my part-
ner at the end of it. (Five, love.) She
had been very talkative all through.
“Come, come,” I said impatiently,
“you don't want a song at this very
moment. Surely you can wait till the
end of the set 2'
“Oh, I was only just wondering.”
“I quite see your point. You feel
that Nature always compensates us in

some way, and that as
“Oh, no!” said Miss Hope in great
confusion. “I didn't mean that at all.”
She must have meant it. You don't
talk to people about singing in the
middle of a game of tennis; certainly
not to comparative strangers who have
only spilt lemonade over your frock
once before. No, no. It was an insult,
and it nerved me to a great effort. I
discarded—for it was my serve—the
Hampstead Smash; I iºd the
Peruvian Teaser. Instead, I served
two Piccadilly Benders from the right-
hand court and two Westminster Welts
from the left-hand. The Piccadilly
Bender is my own invention. It can
only be served from the one court,
and it must have a wind against it.
You deliver it with your back to
the net, which makes the striker
think that you have either forgotten
all about the game, or else are apolo-
gising to the spectators for your previous

'exhibition. Then with a violent con-
tortion you slue your body round and
serve, whereupon your opponent per-
ceives that you are playing, and that it
is just one more ordinary fault into the
wrong court. So she calls “Fault l”
in a contemptuous tone and drops her
racquet . . . and then adds hurriedly,
“Oh, no, sorry, it wasn't a fault, after
all.” That being where the wind
comes in.
The Westminster Welt is in theory
the same as the Hampstead Smash,
but goes over the net. One must be in
very good form (or have been recently
insulted) to bring this off.
Well, we won that game, a breeze
having just sprung up; and, carried
away by enthusiasm and mutual ad-
miration, we collected another. (Five,
two.) Then it was Miss Hope's serve
again. -
“Good-bye,” I said; “I suppose you
want me in the fore-front again 2"
“Please.”
. “I don't mind her shots—the bottle
of scent is absolutely safe; but I'm
afraid he'll win another packet of
woodbines.”
Miss Hope started off with a double,
which was rather a pity, and then
gave our masculine adversary what is
technically called “one to kill.” I saw
instinctively that I was the one, and I
held my racquet ready with both
hands. Our opponent, who had been
wanting his tea for the last two games,
was in no mood of dalliance; he fairly
let himself go over this shot. In a
moment I was down on my knees behind
the net . . . and the next moment I
saw through the meshes a very strange
thing. The other man, with his racquet
on the ground, was holding his eye with
both hands !
“Don’t you think,” said Miss Hope
(two, five—abandoned) “that your over-
head volleying is just a little severe?”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 13.
—High comedy founded on projected
Conference on Veto Resolutions carried
a stage further. Only two characters
in the piece. There is the British
Public, represented by House of Com-
mons, burning with desire to know all
about it; and there is the PREMIER,
PREMIER commences to appropriate
particular work to successive days of
week. Mentions Consolidated Fund
Bill; alludes to Census Bill, Small
Holdings (No. 3) Bill, the Civil List,
a Regency Bill, “and on Friday we
will take a Local Government Board
Bill.”
Then, positively, he sits down l Not
a word about the Conference. House
gasped with astonishment. In another

about terms of question. For moment
PREMIER sat unresponsive; evidently
turning them over in his mind and
wondering what specific matter they
might allude to.
Ah! the Conference, of course. It
must be that. Suppose he must say
something in reply.
This he did in two sentences. In
the first chaffed the omniscient news-
papers for “their illuminating revela-
who cannot conceive why anyone should second SPEAKER would have called on 'tions; ” in the second confirmed this
be interested in a matter so
infinitesimal in importance that
it would never occur to him to
mention it.
House crowded in anticipa-
tion of “a Statement.” Papers
full of the subject; where two
or three are gathered together,
in Clubs, at street corners, in
the Lobby, the Conference is
sole topic of conversation.
Buzz of excitement runs along
crowded benches when PRINCE
ARTHUR strolls in, flushed with
the June sun and victory on
the golf links at Sandwich.
The PREMIER, earlier in his
place, sat sorting notes, doubt-
less presently to be elaborated
in the momentous “Statement.”
Scores of questions printed
on paper. With exception of
one group their slow progress
impatiently watched. Excep-
tion relates to arrangements
made for Members to view
procession at Funeral of late
KING. Lou LU, brought to task
in his capacity as First Com-
missioner of Works, takes
cover behind EARL MARSHAL.
Naturally manoeuvre inade-
quate. A good deal of Loulu
seen above head and shoulders
of his Grace of NorFolk, whom
he describes as being “in sole
control of arrangements.”
Very well; House not pedan-
tic about details. If it were the
EARL MARSHAL who arranged
position of Parliamentary stand
where little could be seen, if it
were he who forbade ex-M.P.'s,
albeit Privy Councillors, to enter West-
minster Hall during the Lying in State,
then let the EARL MARSHAL's head be
brought in on a charger. Clamour of
supplementary questions having this
object in view was rising to dangerous
height, when SPEAKER interposed. Con-
sequently EARL MARSHAL still lives.
At last, in response to enquiry from
PRINCE ARTHUR as to course of busi-
ness, PREMIER on his legs. A hush
falls over impatient House: now all
shall be told, rumour laid to rest, con-
jecture silenced. Referring to notes,
“Loulu TAKEs cover behind EARL MARshal.”
(The Duke of Norfolk and Mr. Harcourt.)
Orders of the Day. Happily DALziel,
is on his watch-tower on back bench
below Gangway, to see that Liberal
Party is being run straight, and that,
speaking generally (as BRowNING did in
quite another connection), “all's well
with the world.”
“Does the PRIME MINISTER,” he
asked, leaping to his feet, “contemplate
making any statement in regard to
certain reports as to negotiations
proceeding between the two Front
Benches 2"
Delightful non-committal vagueness
particular one.
Poor realisation this of ex-
travagant expectation of dra-
matic disclosure. But it served.
Business done.—Miscellane-
ous. In opposing issue of writ
for East Dorset MARKHAM gave
welcome new turn to hackneyed
figure of speech. Represented
Lady WIMBORNE, in anticipation
of Mr. GUEST standing for the
constituency, saying to herself,
“My son has fought and lost
three elections. Now at last he
has come down to fight under
my own doorstep.” Quite time
the old fig-tree was uprooted.
Tuesday.—A pretty episode
varied prosaic course of busi-
ness. Questions disposed of,
the DEPUTY-SPEAKER (presiding
in place of Dr. LowTHER, who
has business at Cambridge to-
day) called on “Mr. BURt.”
From the bar, where he had
stood unobserved, the Member
for Morpeth responded.
“A message from QUEEN
ALEXANDRA.”
House long known respected
and esteemed colleague whose
proud record is written in the
pages of Dod: “Commenced
working in the coal mines at
ten years of age.” Has watched
with pleasure his advance to
Ministerial office, his promotion
to the Privy Council. Never
imagined it would behold him
as a Queen's Messenger, the
authorised - medium of com-
munication between the QUEEN-
MoTHER and the faithful Com-
mons. Yet here he was in his Sunday
suit, reciting with broad Northumbrian
burr her MAJESTY's words: “I thank
you with all my heart for the address of
condolence you have presented to me.”
Having read the document, the
representative of Royalty made due
obeisance, advanced to Table, and laid
it thereon. Here it seemed was end
of scene watched with keen interest by
crowded House. BURT might have
wheeled to left or right, or turned
about to regain his place by the Bar.

is accustomed to do it thoroughly.
During thirty-six years' membership
has had many opportunities of observing
the uniformed Envoys of the Sovereign
discharging duties akin to that com-
mitted to him. Has often seen BoBBY
SPENCER, when Vice-Chamberlain, sup-
ported by native dignity and highly
starched collar, advance and retire with
his “Message from the QUEEN.” In later
years has had the advantage of studying
the MASTER of ELIBANK on the same
errand, performed with equal grace and
skill.
As successive Black Rods have
learned, it is no easy task (not being a
crab) to make a bee-line backwards
from Table to Bar, conscious of the
critical scrutiny of four humdred pair of
eyes. But Thomas, “son of Peter
Burt, miner,” did not spend boyhood's
ears among devious turnings of
Northumberland coal-pit for nothing.
Having delivered his message he, to
consternation of House, began to walk
backward. As with sure foot he made
his way, consternation changed to ad-
miration. When he reached the Bar
and made final obeisance to Chair, a
hearty cheer burst forth from both
sides.
Incident rather spoiled opportunity
of PRIME MINISTER and CHANCELLOR
of ExchEQUER. As it chanced they
also were charged with Royal messages.
LLoyd GEORGE came first with one from
the KING, concerning the new Civil List.
The PREMIER, bearing a second dealing
with Appointment for Regency, at-
tempted to exalt his mission by mention-
ing that his message was “signed by
the KING's own hand.” BURT took the
shine out of all, and the House does
not care for more than one sensation
at a sitting.
AsquitH is above mean jealousies.
He knows now where, in case of
vacancy in the Household appoint-
ments, he can find a suitable Treasurer
or Vice-Chamberlain. We may yet see
THoMAs BURT uniformed, belted, epau-
letted, carrying the white staff of office,
the bearer of yet unwritten “Message
from the KING.”
Business done. — Several Bills ad-
vanced a stage. In respect of one of
them order made that without consent
of Urban District Council Portrush
shall not play golf on Sundays.
Thursday.--Towards close of busy
week Members still asking themselves,
Who is DoRE 2 and what his well-
known case ? - Introduced to notice by
WINTERTON. Question arose upon
appointment to desirable position in
India Office. Members behind Front
Opposition Bench have heard that
CHANCELLOR OF Exchequer, a “sort
of " Lord HALSBURY, has marked the
prize down for a protégé. Hence the
quickened and sustained interest in the
affair.
Several questions put and answered,
up gat WINTERTON with searching en-
quiry, addressed to UNDER-SECRETARY,
“Will the honourable gentleman
bear in mind the well-known case of
Mr. DOBE 2 ''
House stared in blank amazement.
“Who 's DoRE 2'' men asked each
other, and there was no reply.
The MEMBER FOR SARK fancies WIN-
TERTON was thinking of Dowb and the
famous message transmitted by the
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR to the
CoMMANDER-IN-CHIEF of the hapless
army in the Crimea, “Take care of
Dowb.” Disclosure of this domestic
injunction convulsed the nation with
sardonic merriment, Dowb being a
young kinsman of the WAR MINISTER.
Half a century ago, when WINTERTON
was at Eton, it was still the talk of
town and country. Out of rich store
of historical erudition he brings up the
old catchword and applies it to modern
instance, with effect partially marred by
mispronunciation.
Business done.—A good deal, and
House up at 7.40 withal.
The right word at the right moment.
Habeas Corpus was a dull-looking
chap, not over-shaven. Once he walked
into a shop, stole some boots, walked
out again, but was unfortunately over-
taken by the shopman, to whom he
remarked, “It is a fair cop.” At the
Police Station he was duly cautioned
and asked if he desired to make any
statement. “It was a fair cop,” he
said, and was eventually committed
for trial at Quarter Sessions. It was
when the Clerk of the Peace had said,
“Habeas Corpus, you are charged for
that you on the first day of this month
feloniously did steal, take and carry
away one pair of boots of the value of
seven shillings and sixpence, the pro-
perty of Archibald Stone. How say
you, are you guilty or not guilty?” it
was then that Habeas Corpus summed
up the whole situation in one priceless
remark. “It was,” said he, “a fair cop.”

I've got something that will make
you laugh. I'll fetch it in.”
I feared the worst as Mrs. Tally
hastened away; and I knew the worst
when she returned bearing the Visitors'
Book.
“There," she said, “I often have a
good laugh over that of an evening.
Such funny bits there are in it. Some
of the gentlemen we get here are such
wags. Look at this"—and she placed
her fat finger on a drawing of a young
man in a straw hat, leaning against
the bar while he blew kisses to an
enormous figure behind it.
“That's me,” she said, pointing to
the enormous figure. “I remember
that young gentleman so well. He
came with two others, on bicycles, and
they stayed from Saturday to Monday.
So bright they were, and so full of
jokes. See what he wrote underneath.”
I read: - “Dook Snook, Lord Bob,
and the Hon. Billy came and saw and
were conquered—to-tally' "
“Do you see the joke in that last
word?" she inquired. “Rather smart,
wasn't it? But they're full of fun, all
of them. Here's another amusing
one. I remember that gentleman very
well. He was always so witty.”
I looked and read: “I was sent to
the Red Lion by my doctor for change
and rest. The waitress got the change,
and the hostess the rest.”
“Isn't that good?” the Red Lioness
inquired.
I said it was.

“This is a bit of poetry,” said my
hostess, proceeding to read it :—
“‘Of all the girls that are so smart,
There's none like Mrs. Tally,
How could I dash
her
She is the darling of my heart,
And lives in our alley.

“Don't you think it's wonderful to
be able to make up poetry"—she called
it poytry—“like that?” Mrs. Tally
continued. “I do. I've tried, but I
never could do anything worth repeat-
ing, and as for writing in a Visitors'
Book! . . . Don't you agree with
me?” she asked.
“Most cordially,” I said. “It’s a
real gift, there's no doubt about it. A
gift.”
“Yes," she said, “a gift. That's
what it is. Here's another funny
one,” she added.
I read: “The Ten Thirsty Tiddlers

teenth time. Everything A 1 as usual.”

“But of course,” said Mrs. Tally,
“although these are amusing and make
the book such good reading, it's the
serious compliments we like the best.
All comic wouldn't do at all. Some
people, indeed, actually dislike it. There
were two lady artists here not long ago
who asked me to remove the book from
the room, as it was so vulgar. Fancy
that—“remove the book ' ' No, it's
the serious things that do the most
good in the trade, of course. Like this,
for instance”—and Mrs. Tally pointed
to the following, one after the other:—
“Mr. and Mrs. Wilson Flower, of Dunedin,
N.Z., spent a week here very pleasantly in
July. The cooking was excellent and every-
thing was most comfortable. They hope to
return on their next visit to the dear old
country.

“Well,” said Mrs. Tally, “I must
go now ; but I'll leave the book with
you. And there's an earlier volume if
you like to see it. It'll cheer you
wonderfully, and you'll just die of
laughing.”
The honest kindly soul! There are
moments when one is more ashamed of
what is called culture than any one can
ever be of ignorance. -
POMP.
WHEN Arthur John Robinson,
Esquire, was made a borough J.P.,
and appointed to sit and dispense
judgment in a court of summary juris-
diction, he determined to do the thing
properly. So, before his first appear-
ance on the bench, he attended all
the accessible assize courts and studied
with great attention the methods of the
Judges of the High Court. Particularly
was he impressed with their manner
of sentencing convicted murderers, but
not so impressed as to doubt that he
could do it as well himself, when
occasion arose.
The first matter with which he was
called upon to deal was a charge of theft,
a first offence and not a very ambitious
one at that. Bearing himself with
great dignity and decorum, he discussed
the sentence with the Magistrates'
Clerk, and suggested a longish term of
penal servitude. But the Clerk, who
knew not only his business but also his
limitations, tactfully pointed out that
the most that could be done for the
prisoner by that court was three months'
hard.
The next case was a summons against
a father for not sending his child to
school, for which offence Robinson, J.P.,
without consulting anybody, ordered
him to be imprisoned in the second
division for six months. But the Clerk
arose again, and declared in a useful
whisper that, though the father deserved
every day of his sentence, the law did
not permit of his being imprisoned at
all. So the sinner was recalled and
his sentence commuted by a lenient
Bench to a mere fine. “I do not
know,” said Robinson, J.P., to himself,
“which I find more tiresome, the inter-
ference of magistrates' clerks or the
incompetence of the law. Next time I
will have my go.”
The next item was a “drunk and
disorderly,” and the Bench prepared
itself to deal with, this in its most
judicial manner. This time, however,
the Clerk was consulted first as to
the maximum sentence; which done,
the utmost silence was commanded
throughout the court and sentence thus
delivered :—“Prisoner at the bar, you
have committed one of the most serious
and most dastardly offences a man may
commit. You have been guilty of one
of the worst crimes possible against
your country, your borough, your
family and yourself. Justice must
exert, unremitting, its every effort to
suppress you and your abandoned
kind, that so the State may be rid of
its most dangerous enemy. I sentence
you to twenty-one days' imprisonment
with hard labour; and may the Lord
have mercy on your soul!”
IMMUNITY BADGES.
OWING to somebody's bright idea, a
long-suffering section of the com-
munity—those generous souls who
are inveigled into bazaars—may
now breathe again, and continue to
do so on and after July 1, when the
“Please don't ask” badge is to be
introduced at the “Country Fair” in
the Botanic Gardens in aid of Our
Dumb Friends' League. A large bright
red disc labelled “Immunity Badge,”
at a cost of a mere ten shillings, will
warn off all stall-holders, bran-pie mer-
chants, and raffle-mongers from the
wearer, who will then be enabled to
take a dispassionate view of the pro-
ceedings, and even have to beg for a
cup of tea at the market price from the
presiding duchess at the counter.
This brilliant invention might with
advantage be carried a stage further.
A laborious and crowded afternoon
would be saved if “Absentee Tickets”
were issued, say for a guinea, by the
purchase of which those who figure on
Charity Patrons' lists would be enabled
to stay away altogether from any
particular Fancy Fair.
By a further extension, stall-keepers
might be excused from exhibiting any
wares whatever, and, if this privilege
were universally and quite reasonably
taken up, the whole show could be:
omitted. This would effect a marked
economy in time, temper, postage and
printing, while the funds of the approved
institution would be proportionately
enriched. It would be a matter for
skilled actuaries and determined philan-
thropists to settle between them. In
fact the logical deduction seems to be,
that bazaars may now be entirely
eliminated from the social scheme.
THE GREEN GRASS.
My garden's my pride and my glory,
It gives me employment from dawn,
But the part that is turning me hoary
Is the bald-headed state of the lawn.'
With grass I proceeded to sow it
And longed, unsuspectingly blithe,
For the time when I shortly should
mow it -
And looked up the price of a scythe.
Though I rolled it, and watered it daily
With tears and the sweat of my brow,
Discomfiture shadowed me greyly,
The grass wouldn't grow anyhow.
My dogged endeavours were routed,
My patience was shattered to shreds,
The seed on the lawn never sprouted, i.
But came up in weeds on the beds. :
Then I scattered the seed, growing wary,
Round my bedded-out seedlings i.i.
night, º
Convinced that, still being “contrairy,”
It would grow on the lawn out of spite.
!
Not a chance The bed fostered its
powers, t
It grew with an impudent growth.
And rooted so strong round the flowers
I had to pull neither or both. -
So I think this well-proved information
Should be added to gardener's books
For the amateur's edification :

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
To the rich and popular Simon de Gew life was a comedy
at which he looked on with a smile, for all that he was
troubled with a little pain inside. One-day he consulted
a doctor about this pain—after which he realised that
even comedies come to an end some time and that this one
had only six months more to run. Thereupon he started out
to play Providence for the short time that was left to him;
very confidently setting himself the task of earning happi-
ness by making others happy. Somehow it did not seem
to be as easy as he had expected; he brought only
unhappiness to those whom he thought to befriend. So
when his time was come, and he realised bitterly that
even as a Good Fairy he was a failure, he was glad
to die. But Fate denied him even this—he recovered.
Then, penniless and friendless, he began again; helping
others humbly this time, not in his own way, but in theirs.
It was by this means that Simon the Jester found happi-
ness. You must read Mr. W. J. Locke's story (LANE)—
a novel of wit and wisdom and tenderness and under-
standing. My task, you see, is easier than Simon's ; I
have only to recommend this book to earn my reward.
The Outliers are a forest race, skilled in woodcraft,
nomad, and all the better for not being civilized. The Far
Folk, though they prefer the bleak hills, are just such
another race, equally brave but not quite so honest. The
House-livers (you and I are House-livers) are beneath
contempt. Now the Outliers once held The King's Treasure,
which the Far Folk wanted very badly. And because the
latter wanted it so badly and had been guilty of no little
treachery on its behalf in the past, the Outliers determined
that they should not have it. So they buried it in a secret
place and set as ward over it one of their young maidens,
changing the same periodically. As each maiden came off
duty, she was made to drink the Cup of Forgetfulness,
for even in Outland (MURRAY) women are not expert
secret-keepers. Over the winning and losing of the Treasure
by divers means, not omitting the use of the romantic side
of the fair ward's youth, Mr. GoRDON STAIRs has contrived a
dainty yet exhilarating romance, told in a simple eloquence
which becomes an atmosphere so little complex. He would
not have had any truck at all with the despicable House-
livers, had he seen his way to telling his tale without them.
As it is, he only admits one of either sex, and those not too
civilized. I suspect him of being a bit of an Outlier himself,
from the way in which he bursts into the middle of his
delightfully impossible tale, as who should say, “Don’t let
us bother with houses and reasons and surnames and pro-
babilities and all the other tiresome by-products of polite
society.” And, when I had got used to doing with quick
movement, lots of fresh air and no explanations, I came to
wish heartily that I, too, had been born an Outlier.
The book entitled George Meek, Bath Chair-man, by
Himself, which is published by Messrs. Constable, with
an introduction by Mr. H. G. WELLs, has made me feel

rather proud of myself, because I am certain that I am the
only critic who will resist the temptation to describe it as
a human document. GEORGE MEEK is a real living man
who has pursued many callings with indifferent success.
He was a shoeblack, a baker's assistant, a club servant, a
political registration agent—to select at random from the
list. Finally he became a bath chair-man at Eastbourne.
As by-play during many of these occupations he tried his
hand at writing, and Mr. WELLs, to whom he applied for
advice, seems to have urged him not to worry out schemes
of Utopian Socialism, which he was rather inclined to do,
but to tell the story of his own life. Mr. WELLs says he
thinks he remembers writing something to this effect:
“You must know no end of things, and have felt no end
of things, I, as a writer, would give my left hand for. Try
and set them down.” Well, Mr. MEEK has done it, with a
good deal of frankness, and the result is undeniably inter-
esting. I have only to express
If you like to search for improbabilities in The Girl with
the Red Hair (CASSELL) you will find a whole crop of them;
but, although I do not believe in MAx PEMBERTON's under-
graduates—and least of all in the one who tells the tale—I
swallowed their adventures at one sitting. The trouble is
that the author (late of Caius) has learnt a lot since his
Cambridge days, and meanwhile has forgotten how ignorant
a Varsity man can be. But if Mr. PEMBERTON likes to
handicap himself by writing as an undergraduate it is no
concern of mine; for his business is with intrigues, plots,
perils by land and sea, and hair-breadth escapes, and his
art is to make us believe the incredible. So when he gets
his characters away from Cambridge and shuts them up in
an old Swedish castle, I am with him (and them) whole-
heartedly. At various times the hero is in danger of being
drowned, starved to death, murdered in his bed (no marks
for that), and shot, and my only regret is that he had not
time to do a little flying. Still
the hope that Mr. WELLs will be
satisfied with the written record,
and not go bartering one of his
hands for a chance of the actual
| experiences. At any rate I am
glad he is not prepared to am-
putate the hand he writes with.
According to Maria, the whole
duty of woman is to climb. If
you start, as she did, from the
dead level of Brixton, and going
round by the safe and easy Bays-
water Road mount steadily up-
wards, with your eyes glued on
the shining peaks of Park Lane,
you may get there or thereabouts
in time, provided that you are
not overburdened with a sense of
humour and have a large enough
reserve force of innate vulgarity.
Those are the Alpha and Omega
of the great gospel of Getting On.
Also, you must not be unduly
sensitive about the smiles and
pin-pricks of your dearest friends
and rival mountaineers. In all
these respects Maria was ad-
mirably equipped for the enter-
prise. The story of her struggles
with society and her ultimate -
triumph (as told by Mrs. John LANE), and her Brixton-
cum -Bayswatery views on marriage, wedding-presents,
etiquette, charity, art, and all the common objects of
the wayside on the well-worn track by which she
travelled, makes up a clever and amusing satire. The
book is like a composite photograph of all the Marias
that ever were ; a merciless exposé of all the wrinkles
and blemishes of their suburban souls. Not one of
them has escaped Mrs. LANE's eagle eye. And yet the
result is not—what shall I say?—not quite up to The
Champagne Standard which she set herself. It is a good,
sound-bodied, wholesome wine, but, considering that it
comes from the cellars of that famous hostelry, The Bodley
Head, and bears the Mrs. John LANE label, it seems to
me to lack the sparkle and freshness that I should have
expected. For Mrs. John LANE has a very pretty, wit
of her own. But so many people have written about
Maria before her that, on this occasion only, her re-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHERE'S WHERE 3
OR, GUIDEs To BEAUTY Spots.
It was just a fortnight ago, with barely two clear months
in which to make up his mind, that my friend Raoul Tren-
cham, of His Majesty's Civil Service, began to wonder where
he was to spend his summer holidays. He is not easily satis-
fied. He wants a spot at once warm and bracing, in the
neighbourhood of at least two golf courses, and preferably
near the sea, for he likes his sand-bunkers to be the work
of Nature; yet not too near, for ozone is unsympathetic
to his digestion. He also hankers after inland woods and
pastures, with a trout stream ; and, at the same time, his
heart is in the Welsh Highlands. The North appeals to his
nerves; the South calls him with the call of the blood.
He has a preference for privacy; yet he likes to see the
Pageant of Life (as he puts it) passing before him.
You will guess the chaotic condition of his mind, when
I say that he tells me he has been resorting to the study,
on railway platforms, of pictorial advertisements of Beauty
Spots, although he has a sensitive nature, quickly offended
by crudity of form or colour.
The first to arrest his notice was a poster of Messrs.
Cook, who offered to take him anywhere on a magic carpet.
But he disliked the look of the people with whom he would
be expected to share the carpet, some of them being dressed
in the very loudest taste; and he also took exception to
the moustaches of the genie.
He was at first rather drawn to a Swiss summer scene,
but the only man in the picture wore a sort of semi-hunting
kit, and Trencham makes it a rule never to ride to hounds
in the Alps during August.
A trip on a Nord-Deutscher-Lloyd's Weekly might have
had attractions for him, but he did not care for the colour
of the tea which the hatchet-faced gentleman in the deck-
chair was pouring out; and the slabs of bread-and-butter
had a repellent aspect. The girl with the sad sea eyes
wouldn't touch them.
The Kyles of Bute, again, were out of the question, for
the steamer was nearly the same size as the islands, and
seemed almost certain to get jammed in the narrows which
abound in that neighbourhood.
The Norfolk Broads, on the other hand, were more
roomy, but the moon in those parts is far too big and yellow.
Yellow does not go with Mrs. Trencham's complexion. •
From a distance his heart was moved by the portrait of
a nice bright Irish girl, clearly anxious to give him a
welcome. But when he drew closer he found that she was
saying “Come back to Erin.” Now, Trencham tells me he
has never been to Erin, so he cannot go back there. If he
went he would be deceiving the poor girl; and he would
find that all the other visitors were old hands—since nobody
is ever asked to go there for the first time.
He was very disappointed with the Golf Resorts. A
Lincolnshire Spa offered him Salt Bromo-Iodine Waters,
and this was a great temptation, for there is no brand of
casual water that is more stimulating to the rubber-core:
but he shrank from the girl in the bunker who was playing
with her eye on her caddie instead of on the ball. This
meant wild work, and if you are going to be knocked over
on a golf-course it doesn't help you much to know that
you have been hit in the “heart of TENNYSON's country.”
At Bridge of Allan you also get mineral waters; but
there is a woman there with a bright blue skirt and scarlet
coat (always a combination that is obnoxious to Trencham)
who carries a driver with a head partly of wood, partly of
iron. My friend has no club of that description and he
does not care to be out of touch with local sentiment. He
also had his doubts about the quality of the climate; for the
legs of the young man in attendance went with rather a
trailing movement.
At Boscastle he did not like the way in which fishing-
tackle was left lying about the links. Otherwise he might
have been persuaded by a printed quotation from Sir
HENRY IRVING in favour of this spot. Trencham often
admired Sir HENRY in tragedy.
Among popular watering-places Southsea was not to be
thought of, if it contained any more women in yellow like
the one in the seascape. Trencham tells me that he much
preferred another woman in yellow that sits on a terrace
near Harrogate, though the wreath of pink roses which
she wears in place of a picture hat would have been better
in the same nuance as her gown. But Harrogate, he says,
has a choice of eighty different mineral waters, and this,
to a man of Trencham's indecisive character, would have
proved insufferable.
At Swanage he found the children far too noisy and
united. No fewer than five of them were holding hands
as they raced along the shore in an ecstasy of glee.
Trencham, though a family man, is easily oppressed by
excessive happiness in the very young.
Tunbridge Wells seems to have a good hotel; but the
Cambridge Blue who shares the garden seat with a lady
friend is clearly better placed than the solitary Oxford Blue
in the background; and Trencham is a loyal son of Isis.
At Ryde the fatal feature was a mermaid. Strangely
supercilious for so indifferent a figure, it was not only her
contour that distressed my friend. Ever since he first read
The Forsaken Merman of MATTHEw ARNOLD, he has
steadily set his face against the female of hat species.
And this reminds me that, in addition to his artistic
sensitiveness (the gaudy colours of the people who punt at
Staines nearly made him riversick), Trencham has a nice
literary feeling, not less quick to take offence. Thus, he was
hurt when he came to look at the little bathing boy who is
being retrieved from the surf at Sunny Clacton by a paddling
lady. It was not the harmless title—“A Morning Dip”—
that annoyed him; it was the inverted commas. Trencham
is very severe upon superfluous inverted commas.
Nor was he better pleased with “Bright, breezy, bracing,
beautiful Bexhill.” He told me that he thought that this
example of alliteration was wanting in subtlety. True art,
he said, should conceal itself.
On the other hand, the picture of the three rabbits on
the Underground (only one of them is really underground;
the other two are sitting out in the open) appealed to both
his sporting and literary tastes. He was particularly
pleased with the legend, that ran thus: “Fresh woods and
pastures new.” He tells me it is the first time he has ever
seen this passage quoted correctly.
My friend saw a great number of studies of trains going
at full steam, but got little inspiration from them. After
all, as he rightly said, they are the means rather than the
end. There was one that showed the footboard of a Great
Central engine with the stoker stoking; but—and I can
well understand this attitude—Trencham always prefers
to travel in an ordinary compartment.
At present his mind still remains open. Two adver-
tisements have impressed him favourably. One is of a
washing-establishment in the suburbs, where two very
lovable laundresses pass across a nice green field. He
would rather like to stay there. He says you might
almost call a laundry a watering-place, and he doesn't mind
whether they use bromo-iodine or not. The other is of
the Japan-British Exhibition; and there is some talk of
his taking a furnished house in Shepherd's Bush for the
month of August. - - -- - O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 29, 1910.
CHARIVARIA.
WE consider that Mr. John BURNS
has been unfairly chaffed for accepting
a salary of £5,000 a year after stating
that no man is worth more than £500.
In making that statement he expressed
no opinion as to what a superman might
be worth.
:: *:
::
We were not sorry to see Mr.
BYLEs, M.P., protesting against the
upward tendency of Ministerial salaries.
It almost looks as if he had resigned
himself to the prospect of an unofficial
career. :: *:
“Tory" writes that the
general opinion about the Con-
ference seems to be that the
rank and file of the Liberal
Party will never submit to a
compromise. We have corrected
“Tory's" spelling; “rank and
file” should not be spelt with a v.
With reference to the hint
that, in the event of the Govern-
ment making any concession,
Mr. REDMoND will kick the
Government out, we suspect
that the boot to be used for this
operation is merely a shop-
window boot. Wide “Boot Trade
Tricks,” in the Press.
Mr. Asquith, it is realised,
displayed considerable wisdom
in arranging to see the Suffra-
gists and the Anti-Suffragists
on the same afternoon. That
no attempt to kidnap the
PREMIER was made by the
former is said to have been due
to the knowledge that there
was a powerful force of the
latter within call.
The members of the Société
d’Economie Politique de Bel-'—
gique, upon the occasion of their visit
last week to this country, were shown
the grave of Cobden, their hosts being
members of the National Liberal Club.
This is the first time that the National
Liberal Club has admitted that CoBDEN
is dead. :: :::
Mr. CHURCHILL has explained that
the young man who was reported to
have been fined £1 for using the word
“Damn" really made a stronger re-
mark. While the actual expression
has not transpired, we understand that
it was really something of a bargain
for £1. --
From Geneva comes the news that
a Swiss curé has forbidden members of

his congregation to wear open work
blouses during service in the church.
We are not surprised at this. Open
work on the day of rest is peculiarly
unseemly. :: ::
“For the present it is the German
Emperor who stands at the head of
the family of monarchs," says Asahi of
Tokio. “There is no question as to
the peaceful intentions of the KAISER,
but in him the new King of GREAT

in his work for the maintenance of

The swing of the pendulum ? The

the rise in the price of meat, and now
from Christie's comes the news that
t
The Regent Street Polytechnic's
steamer Viking met with what might
have been a nasty accident last week
when she ran aground in Geiranger
Fjord, near Bergen. The two hundred
passengers, who betrayed no panic,
were having breakfast at the time, and
it is thought that, if the impact had
been a little harder, some of their
coffee would have been spilt.
Some remarkable incidents were re-
ported during the recent heat wave,
the strangest being the case of a house
in Great Ormond Street, Bloomsbury,
-- which suddenly fainted.
Of interest to botanists:–
“Cricket,” The Sunday Chroni.

camelia, constantly changing."
Interviewed on the subject
of the new coinage which he
has been commissioned to
design, Mr. MACKENNAL stated,
“I cannot at present give any
indication of the form the coin-
age will take." A little bird
tells us, however, that their
shape will almost certainly be
round. In any case they are
sure to be much sought after by
art-lovers, and others.
MORE ENTENTE CORDIALE.
“The French Ministry of Public
Instruction has conferred the Order of

Napoleon in 1808, and is conferred on

As do those artists who are weekly hired
To limn you mated with a Bill that's Beery,

Is filling up at an alarming rate;
Whipped at the post, or in the village pond ducked,
You'd still have one offence to expiate.
We knew already how you fostered habits
Which honest folk consistently forswear,
Disdaining not to help yourself to rabbits
And other wildfowl which belonged elsewhere.
We knew that all the livelong day you pitted
Your wits against the law; and had no doubt
That in the night you brazenly committed
The last and greatest sin of “sleeping out.”
But, having passed the usual moral stricture,
We might have schooled our judgment to condone
If only you had kept within the picture
And harmonised your tints to Nature's own.
Your clothes, for instance; where's the touch artistic
In what you call by courtesy a “frock”?
Could anything be more antagonistic
To picturesqueness than your billycock?
Your customs, also, show you do not follow
The worship of the Beauty which is Truth;
No woodland herbs fill your recurrent hollow,
But salvaged mutton that has lost its youth.
And when the pangs of thirst assail your throttle
No crystal fountain serves for your carouse;
You soil the landscape with a blatant bottle
Filled at the last-encountered public-house.
In fact, friend William, it's beyond denial,
And amply proved by other pens than mine
(See the above quotation), that on trial
You stand condemned both rogue and Philistine—
As out of tune amid the country's graces
As those egregious advertising bills
Which noise abroad, in ill-considered places,
The benefits of Someone's Liver Pills.

THE PAY'S THE THING.
MY DEAR YoUNG MAN,+I am sorry to hear you are on
your beam-ends again. There's no doubt about it: pub-
lishers are a hard-hearted race and editors are no better.
Between them they manage to clap an extinguisher on
any spark of genius that may be doing its little best to
twinkle and keep alive. The publishers return your novels,
the editors send back your articles, and there's no appeal
against their infamous and immoral decisions. Your only
satisfaction, not a very nourishing one, is to read the novels
and articles that are actually printed and published, and to
realise that your own were a thousand million times more
brilliant and deserving. To praise yourself by comparison
and to go on starving appears to be all that is left to you.
You say you've tried everything from a golf-novel up to
a historical essay on handkerchiefs. I’ve watched your
career pretty closely, and I'm sure there's one field of
literary endeavour in which you have not yet set your
plough. I propose to recommend it to you. I know you
won’t like it at first. You'll
of tolerant contempt with occasional moral reproof. You
will not exactly preach. To do that might alienate your
readers. But you will show them, as it were incidentally,
how un-English all these amatory adventures are, how
poor and weak a thing is a French queen or a German
poet, and what a high moral purpose you have had in
showing them up under the cold light of the English
language written by a master.
Finally, you may set to work on something more intimate
but not less attractive. Write in brief the life-story of some
celebrated foreign literary man. Show how, after having
been buffeted by fortune, he at last found a refuge and a
home in a family not his own and lived with them during the
remainder of his life. Explain how, according to you, this as-
sociation, far from having made him happy, actually dragged
him down, seeing that he and the lady of the house in which
he lived were, in all human probability, not merely friends,
but lovers. The fact that the lady has recently died full
of years and honours, that her children survive and may be
pained by this attack upon her memory, that friends who
loved and respected her may
put forward all kinds of pleas
about good taste and decent
reticence and honourable absten-
tion from malicious tittle-tattle
resent it—none of these trivial
considerations must be per-
mitted to interfere with your
design. Be cold and lofty,
and that sort of thing. Pooh,
my dear boy, pooh! Are you
going to sacrifice the certainty
of seeing yourself in print and
receiving fat cheques to such
silly, old-fashioned, exploded,
early-Victorian scruples? You
can't afford to do it, and when
you’ve looked at the business in
an enlightened way you’ll see
clearly that no sentimentalism
must be allowed to stand be-
tween you and your income.
Here's my suggestion, based
on the reasonable assumption
that there is a section of the
A SUGGESTION FOR NEXT YEAR'S NAVAL
TOURNAMENT. -
logical, convincing and denuncia-
tory. Remember that where
you cannot prove you can
always hint, and be sure that
you will be rewarded by the
approval of your editor and the
interest of your readers—not to
speak of the extra capital that
you will be able to add to your
store. Your article will be
picked out by the critics as being
“both entertaining and instruc-
tive,” and all fear of a future of
penury will be removed from
you. There you have my
suggestion. Try it at once, and
you will live (in luxury) to bless
public, depraved, you may say,
but still considerable in number, which desires to have
its palates tickled by brisk gossip about the private
lives of distinguished people, chiefly about such liaisons
and immoralities as may have been attributed to them. I
advise you to select your distinguished people from
foreigners who are dead. Tales about living Englishmen
and Englishwomen would, of course, be very spicy and
interesting, but libel actions and big sticks have to be taken
into account, and, for the present at any rate, I advise
you to abstain from your fellow-subjects. Foreigners don't
matter. The essence of their being is that they have no
real homes, that they hold family ties in abhorrence, make
a practice of breaking the seventh commandment (of which
they have never heard), and are altogether fit subjects for
the virtuous indignation of any true-hearted and domestic
English writer who may be minded to expose their alleged
frailties in a monthly review or in book form.
Your best plan will be to begin in what I may call a
general way. TYou might start, for instance, with The Love
Affairs of the French Queens, and proceed, after an interval
of six months or so, to trounce The Indiscretions of the
Archduchesses. This you might follow up with The Pecca-
dillos of the German Poets, devoting the greater part of the
volume to GoFTHE. For your style I recommend a mixture
−'me for having made it.
Lives of the Lowly, by Themselves.

of Autobiographies of the Obscure is to be published, with
prefaces by the Well-known, on the model of that recent

Exth ACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Gommons, Monday, June 20.
—Great thing this hot weather to have
in charge of Bill a Minister of artis-
tic temperament. Such is Edward
STRACHEY. Natural gift displayed to-
night in manner equally striking and
pleasing. Order of the day, Vote on
Account. Debate arises on conduct of
Board of Agriculture. Hottest day of
the year. Outside, sun registers 122
degrees. With Amaryllis in the shade
it is 81 degrees. Attendance moderate.
PRINCE ARTHUR in retirement, meditat-
ing on possibilities and probabilities of
Conference.
Questions sleepily put fail to stir

aloud upon Government to “deal in
determined manner” with the proclivi-
ties of our neighbours in Holland who
sell their cheese as prime Cheshire.

And he did. At a quarter-past eight

and laid out to cool on the Terrace.
Business dome.—Vote on Account
discussed.
Tuesday.—Nice question, suddenly
sprung on House, varied debate on
Regency Bill and the Census. Is a
man who, whilst riding a bicycle, is run
over by a vehicle, with the result that
his right ear is nearly torn off, his
collar-bone broken, his legs badly
bruised—is such an one within his
right as a free-born citizen in remark-
ing “Damn"?
It appears that, case being submitted
to Ivybridge Sessions, magistrates ruled
in the negative, adding a fine of one
pound and costs to damages already
sustained by the bruised bicyclist. It
was MARKHAM who propounded ques-
tion, addressing it to HoME SECRE-
TARY. WINSTON, whose watchful eye
sleepeth nor day nor night, had not
overlooked the case ; had indeed
devoted to it prolonged considera-
tion. Came to conclusion that the
judgment should not be disturbed.
Pressed for reasons, darkly hinted that
there was more in the observations of
the bicyclist than met the eye in the
newspaper report.
Decision not universally acceptable.
Obviously the matter has
wider range than is defined
in question. There are golf
links as well as king's high-
ways. Temptation to exple-
tive is, in certain circum-
stances, common to both.
Cannot be one law for the
battered bicyclist and another
for the bunkered golfer.
Two leading cases may
be cited. That of Mr. Chucks,
the bo'sun with whom Peter
Simple sailed. He, it will
be remembered, conscious of
infirmity in direction re-
buked by the Ivybridge
magistrates, gave a pleasing
turn to expletive. “Bless
your eyes and ears, you
attractive son of a worthy
widow,” was with him an
engaging form of remon-
strance addressed to any
of the crew who tempo-
rarily failed in discharge of
duty.
A more modern instance
is that of Lord MILNER, who,
calculating possible result of
the Lords throwing out
Budget Bill, emphasised his
patriotic contempt for the

ship being mulcted in fine and costs.
Question full of difficulties. Perhaps
a Conference between the two Houses
would be most convenient method
of solving it. Wiscount ST, ALDwyN
might represent the Peers.
Business done.—Regency Bill read

Bill.
Thursday, June 23. — Attempts to
draw PREMIER on subject of Conference,
rife at beginning of week, now inter-
mitted. Asquith much less easy to
draw than is a middle-aged badger.
Old stagers recall GLADSTONE's
manner when, for State reasons, mum
was the word. Posed by awkward
questions he briskly approached Table
and answered “my honourable friend
below the Gangway" or “the right
honourable gentleman opposite ” with
bewildering mass of detail. So anxious
was he that the honest searcher after
truth should be satisfied that he
prolonged explanation beyond cus-
tomary limits. His sentences were in-
terminably lengthened by qualifica-
tions, definitions and hypotheses. Effect
heightened by his courteous bearing,
his almost passionate desire that no-
thing should be hidden.
When at end of five or six minutes
he resumed his seat the mind of hap-
less enquirer was in such
bewildered state that he was
incapable of framing on spur
of the moment a Supplemen-
tary Question. When, after
gasping for breath, he had
constructed a formula more
or less suitable to the occa-
ºf sion, next Question on paper
was called and his opportunity
had sped.
Asquith says nothing in
quite different fashion. When
inquiring minds like those
which animate the manly
framework of DALZIEL or
WEDGwood place on paper
elaborate questions designed
to pierce the secrets of the
shuttered Conference room
he in a sentence effectually
waves them off. In addition
to saving public time the
stern brevity of reply is
disheartening. There has
been elaborate preparation

ment in all the morning

old traditions are dear... For more
sessions than man remembers the Par-
liamentary scene has been lighted up
by the glow of MARK Lockwood's
carnation. Owing in considerable
measure to MACAULAY, the white plume
of HENRY of NAVARRE is a prominent
feature in reminiscence of fights and
forays. The carnation in our Colonel's
buttonhole, though its record is
more modest, is ever equally promi-
nent. Whatever Party be in power,
whatever be the shortcomings and
iniquities of hon. gentlemen on benches
opposite, there is the carnation, blush-
ing upon the just and the unjust.
With varied emotion Members re-
mark that it has not been seen since
sittings were resumed at close of Spring
Recess. The first hurried rumour
attributed omission to the Budget.
It was said that, with super-tax staring
him in the face, MARK Lockwood could
not be expected to go on cultivating
carnations that bloom not only in the
Spring but the year through. - Item,
there was cost of postage for their
delivery in town every morning through

That a reasonable inference, adding
heavily to crushing responsibilities of

on wrong tack. Simple explanation ac-
counts for everything. We are still in

are not permissible. So MARK goes
about the Lobbies and sits in the

boas, and a Mexican mastiff, all of which
are fed exclusively on Quaker cocoa.
The PoET-LAUREATE has a trained
canary which drinks nothing but sack.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw has a lowbacked
Dachshund which he calls “Barker.”
Mr. GRAN VILLE BARKER is the proud
possessor of a magnificent St. Bernard,
which he calls “Shaw.”
Sir H. BEERBoHM TREE's insepar-

“Hamlet.”
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE has a winsome |
Welsh rabbit, which he has wittily

Mr. BRAM StokeR has a tame buffalo
with a cupola - shaped head, which
answers to the name of “Oliver.”
Mr. T. P. O'Connor has a double-
breasted Fountain Penguin which takes
sardines from its master's hand and is
called “ Brian Boru.”

RUSTIC YORKSHIRE TAKES THE FIELD.

[Mr. Thomas Hardy has approved the produc-
tion of a series of Dorset ware illustrating his
novels. The various designs, including a
sketch portrait of Tess, were provided by Mr.
Hardy himself who wrote several couplets.
Beneath a line drawing of Tess are the words—
“No girl in Wessex rivalled Tess
In beauty, charm, and tenderness.” . . . .
The Times]
OTHER novelists and public persons
have not been long in following suit,
and an enormous output of ornamental
pottery may be expected. Among the
new series in a forward stage of com-
pletion is a delightful set of Manx
Mannikins from the famous Greeba
red clay, depicting the better known
characters in the charming stories of
Mr. HALL CAINE. Each bears a coup-
let hot from the massive brain. Thus,
under John Storm we read:—
“I win lost souls from deepest Hell;
Millions of readers love me well."
And under Glory Quayle:—
“Bewitching, candid, noble, free:
Not Shakspeare's self drew such as she.”
From Stratford-on-Avon, which is
already the home of statuettes and
every variety of china and earthenware
memento, is to come a new batch, not,
as it happens, devoted to the trite
Bard of Bards, but to the gifted author
of some of the most successful tracts
of our time, Miss CoRELLI. Beneath
these figures she also has placed suit-
able lines. Under an exquisitely
dainty miniature of Mavis Clare, you
may read:—
“‘The World's Desire' is she indeed :
Ah! great your fortune, you who read!"
And under The Master Christian :-
“The past, ah, yes! 'twas great, we know,
But don't run down the present so.
Avon inspires her darling still:
This Hero grew beside her rill.”
The Shorter Pottery will take the
form of a number of statuettes of illus-
trious authors with definitive summaries
of their achievements and position in
the literary firmament from the pen of
the famous critic. These statuettes
have been made from a fine clay dis-
covered by Mr. SHORTER (or, as he is
now known by his intimates, “Buck-
some Clement”) in one of his rambles
in Buckinghamshire.
Mr. G. B. SHAw has sanctioned the
miniature reproduction of his bust by
RoDIN in a new kind of leadless glaze
pottery to be known as Fabian Ware.
These statuettes will each bear an in-
scription from the Master's hand con-
sisting of the single word SHAW in
facsimile autograph. “Thus,” as Mr.
SHAw wrote recently in ambiguous
French to the promoters of the latest
RoDIN banquet (these meals have be-
come so frequent as to resemble a table
d'hôte), “thus will your great sculptor
endure, linked to me, long after his own
name would have perished.”
A somewhat similar bust of Mr.
HALDANE, made of the best black and
Tanagra Terrier cotta, is also to be
placed on the market. It bears the
appropriate inscription:—
“I who once worshipped SchopeNHAUFR
Now own, Great Mars, thy sovereign power!"
An admirer of Mr. BELLoc has ar-
ranged with a pewterer for the manu-
facture of a large number of “Hilarious
Tankards,” each to hold a quart of the
very best beer that Kent or its substi-
tutes can produce, and each to bear
round the rim a couplet or triplet frºm
Mr. BELLoc's pen. ". those which
have been already engraved on the
pewter are these:— -

“What chance for him who ſaints and stops?

“No legislator e'er can fail
Who fortifies himself with ale—
Whether in tankard or in pail.”
Meanwhile Mr. BELLoc's twin bro-
ther, G. K. C., has arranged for a supply
of “Chesterton China,” reminiscent of
the day when he played Dr. Johnson
at the Chelsea Pageant and expressed
the wish to consume eighteen cups of
tea. In accordance with this aspiration
the “Chesterton China” will be sold
only in sets of eighteen cups; at the
bottom of each will be found a senti-
ment or distich of the great man,
among which are the following:—
“Go where you will the world to see.
. The tourist starts and ends with T.”
“It is as impregnably and incontestably true
to say that black tea is green as to say that
green tea is black.”
“There is nothing in the world more remark-
able than tea-time, and there is nothing in the
world so utterly commonplace as tea-time.”
Birmingham, already so rich in
manufactures, is about to add another
to its artistic products in the new
Lodge Lustre, which is being turned
out in great quantities at Edgbaston.
The favourite shape is a life-size replica
of the great scientist's head, with the
following inscription on the base:—
“Three interviewers in three seasons came
And guided me along the path to fame.
BLAthwayt of bunkum had the largest share,
But BEGbie's trumpet had a louder blare;
Then Nature played her very grandest slam
And sent me StokeR, the portentous BRAM.”
Yielding to the entreaties of in-
numerable applicants the leader of the
Follies has made arrangements for the
establishment of a Pélissier Pottery.
(Mr. PéLISSIER, it may be remembered,
traces his descent from the famous
potter, BERNARD PALIssy, the spelling
of whose name varies greatly in dif-
ferent authorities.) Each piece of
Pélissier pottery will bear the motto,
“Laugh and grow fat,” and an ap-
propriate couplet or quatrain. Among
them we may mention the following:—
“Some make their pile by 'striking ile,”
And some by fleecing jays;
The cueist scores by playing pots,
And I by potting plays.”
“Figures as Illustrations.”
From a letter in The Morning Post:
“A Suffrage argument: Ten thousand women
and girls marching in the streets of London.
An anti-Suffrage argument: Eleven million

their homes.
(The female population of the United King-
dom over fifteen years of age is estimated at
eleven millions).”

The following application for a place
has been forwarded to us:–
“Dr Madman have heard has you are in
want of a Housemaid and has I am in want of
a place has Housemaid would like to give you

“On the other hand, the Tilbury ferry is
much less inconvenient than the Woolwich, and
therefore we have selected the latter as being
by far the more convenient.”—The Autocar.
Until the explanation is actually set
down before one, it is often puzzling
to know why people do things.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ExcEPTING, perhaps, the conduct of the three hundred
before Thermopylae, and that immortal remark of the gen-
tleman who proposed to treat the Persians' arrow-flights
as a parasol, I do not know a finer thing in romantic
history than the language and behaviour of the French
aristocrats whilst awaiting the guillotine. And, though I
sometimes think that more smiling heroes and beautiful
heroines have ridden in the tumbrils of fiction than ever
actually perished even in the orgies of the Revolution, I am
always ready to hear of more. For half its length at least
A Marriage under the Terror (MELRose) does justice to
the raging excitement of its period, and it would be hard to
give it higher praise than that. But when PATRICIA
WENTwoRTH takes her aristocratic heroine out of Paris
after her first rescue from l'Abbaye, and sends her hero,
But he spins a yarn of this dull to-day
And packs it with people from U.S.A.,
Who, forced by motives of love or cash,
Cut a pretty exciting dash,
Full of twists and surprises, planned
With such a masterly, forthright hand
(Our Robert's, to wit) that you're bound to wake
From your dream (see supra) if only to make
Sure that the things described aren't true
And liable daily to happen to you.
That's, at least, how the book strikes me.

HUGH WALPole specialises in Cornwall, and although
Maradick at Forty (SMITH, ELDER) does not entirely fulfil
the expectations raised by his first book, The Wooden Horse,
I can still ask all lovers of the Duchy to read it. Here he
lays his scene in Treliss, a little seaside town with some-
thing in its air which made the stuffiest people “do things.”

Mr. WALPOLE de-

drag a little, since it
is immediately ob-
vious to the wary
and bloodthirsty
reader that there
must be yet another
hair-breadth 'scape
from the knife's edge
before the finale of
happiness, and he is
obliged to possess
his soul in patience
till it arrives. The
authoress, however,
| partly atones for this
by the insertion of
a burning château
and a fresh love-
affair, so that, as I

was carried through
with all the honours, it would be churlish indeed to
complain. A Marriage under the Terror has been awarded
a prize, I gather, by a committee of expert lady novelists,
and, if it only won by a neck or so, there must have been
a very talented field.
If you've an idea at the back of your head
That life's a blank and that thrills are dead,
That this year of grace one-nine-one-0
Is a milk-and-watery, one-horse show,
That you've lost, if you ever had, the knack
Of getting a shudder all down your back,
And feeling your tresses stand up on end—
If this is your state of mind, my friend,
It's fairly clear that you've not yet struck

phere of Treliss with
remarkable subtlety,
but I am not alto-
gether on his side
when he begins to
show the effects of it
upon his characters.
Maradick was a
dull, virtuous, wife-
trodden man until
the intoxicating air
got into his head.
Then he boomed,
and there were in-
cidents in his boom
which were un-
pleasant. More
stress is laid upon
his sensual side than
is necessary, and his
philanderings with
Mrs. Lester were, I
feel, an insult to
the atmosphere of
Treliss. But in case
wives with dull hus-
bands should be frightened I must add that Treliss was
eventually the salvation of the Maradicks, although their
cure is not one which can be unreservedly recommended.
I hope that Mr. WALPoLE will continue to write of
Cornwall; and if he will devote more attention to the
natives and less to the visitors I shall have no fears for him.

HEY had discussed the weather, the latest novel, golf, and the Army Pageant, until the resources of conversation
seemed to be exhausted; and still they sat on.
“Well,” said HERBERT, pulling himself together with an effort, “about this little—er—Veto business.”
“Yes,” agreed ARTHUR cautiously; “there's that."
“There seems to be a feeling that if we could settle our differences in an amicable way, the country would not
be sorry. I don't know if you have any suggestions as to how this could be done?” -
“The idea,” said ARTHUR, “has been adumbrated that something in the way of compromise—”
At the word “compromise” there was a sudden silence.
“Compromise," said HERBERT at last, after much thought, “in the result might be compared to two girls.
exchanging lovers. Each would feel that she had made a tremendous sacrifice, and yet the other wouldn't be happy.”
“There were once,” said ARTHUR reflectively, “a man and a woman who couldn't agree where to live–one.
preferring London and the other Manchester. Compromise suggested that they should buy a house at Rugby, which:
| neither liked; but being sensible people they decided to spend alternate years at the two places. In politics that is
called the Party system.” He paused for a moment, and then added, “It works very well.”
“No,” said HERBERT firmly; “not with the present House of Lords.”
“Ah,” groaned ARTHUR, “now we've begun.”
“If this conference is to come to anything we must begin some time. And if we go on it can only be on the
lines of compromise of some sort—which means giving up something. We may not like it, but there it is. There's
no harm in trying. Now then, tell me what you’re prepared to give up.”
“That's just what I was going to ask you,” sighed ARTHUR.
“Pray begin,” said HERBERT courteously.
The other yawned and stretched himself and began.
“I am willing to admit that you have a grievance,” he said. “For some years I must confess that I never
noticed particularly the composition of the House of Lords nor remarked that there were seven Conservatives in it to
every one Liberal. Or, if I remarked it, I did not think that it could possibly be a matter for complaint. But now
that my attention has been called to it. I do see that this state of things may not be so satisfactory to your party as it
is to mine. Suppose, then, I say,” he went on slowly, “that I am prepared to agree to an equally divided and
impartial House of Lords—suppose I am prepared to make this very great sacrifice, what will you on your part
give up 2"

“What do you want?”
“I want you to admit the principle of an Upper House which has real control over the Lower House; an
assembly which has the right—and, more than that, the duty, to refer any important measure to the people; such right
to be exercised, as I have said, impartially as between the two parties.”
HERBERT was silent for a long time. -
“Well?” said ARTHUR impatiently. “We must each give up something.”
“But, the two things are so different. You ask me to concede the right of a Second Chamber to refer any
measure to the people. After all, that is a question which admits of argument. Some may hold that it is wise, some
not; many will say that anyhow it should not apply to Finance; the further question as to how, and how often, this
right is to be exercised arises out of it. Imagine a gathering of the most distinguished men in the five continents
drawing up a constitution for a Model State—you may be sure that this question would at least be discussed. But
is it conceivable that it would occur to anybody for one single moment to make the obvious suggestion that the two
chief parties in the State should be treated alike? Surely that would be taken for granted 1"
“Yet,” said ARTHUR, “if one has enjoyed certain powers legitimately for a long time it is hard to lose them,
however reasonably they be taken away. And, though it is one thing to start two competitors equally, it is another thing
to level them up every time one gets a little ahead.”
“Well, yes, that is true. And it may be that without either of us giving up very much we can find a way out
in the manner you suggest. Another little idea had occurred to me, though, and what you say about referring
important measures to the people emboldens me to mention it. Our programme was to refer our Veto Bill to the
people, and, if it was approved, to obtain powers to pass it through the Lords. Now, however, there is a strong
feeling in the country against our seeking such powers at this time. On the other hand, your party has suddenly
taken up with the idea of leaving important measures to the judgment of the people. Well, then, why shouldn't
you give us guarantees that if our Veto Bill is approved by the country, the House of Lords will accept it?”
ARTHUR assumed an air of detachment. . . .
