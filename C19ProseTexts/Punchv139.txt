OLD FRIENDS.
Few things have given me such real
pleasure as the recent announcement
that plans have been made for the issue
of a new coinage. This will meet a
long-felt want, and however soon the
issue is made it cannot be too soon.
Not that I wish to disparage the
dear old coinage. I don't know as
much about the subject as Lord Roth-
schild or ANDREw CARNEGIE, I must
admit, but I think the time is oppor-
tune for a good word to be said about
it and, as neither of these gentlemen
has come forward (it is little to their
credit, I consider), I feel no hesitation
in attempting to fill the breach. Indeed,
it is part of a journalist's daily work to
write about things of which he has little
or no experience.
What romance surrounds our old
coinage ' What thoughts are stirred
up by it! Look through your pennies,
if any. Is there one dated 1883?
That was the year in which Lord
WINTERTON also saw the light. Think
of all the gladness that both have
brought to many a heart. Have you
one dated 1874? The thought in-
evitably comes, how thin it has grown
in the service of man, while Mr. G. K.
CHESTERTON, who came into the world
the same year, has altered too.
Let us not slight the old coinage.
Remember, an old penny will buy as
many wax matches as a new one, and
The Daily Mirror you receive in ex-
change for an old half-penny has quite
as many pictures as the one you would
obtain if you presented a new penny
and the boy forgot to give the change.
And the same rule obtains with
shillings, and (as I have been told)
with coins of higher value whose names
I am not familiar with.
Yes, the issue of a new coinage fills
me with joy; I only hope they'll issue
enough. But all the same I have a
warm corner in my pocket for the old.
Overdoing it.
“A message from Marrakesh states that five-
quarters of the business part of the city have
been destroyed by fire.”
You can't get the insurance people
like that.

[JULY 6, 1910.
TO SOPHONISBA, OF BEDFORD COLLEGE.
[The Duchess of MARLBorough, in advocating a scheme for the
removal of the Bedford College for Women from Baker Street to Regent's
Park, is reported to have said that “it was difficult to comprehend
why there should be such rooted objection on the part of Englishmen to
the higher education of their wives. There must be some secret fear
that, hard as they found it to understand a woman now, it would be
absolutely beyond their ken were she highly educated.” The way to
conquer opposition was for women to be “tactful enough not always to
worst their husbands in argument.”]
ERE the vows at which the bravest falter
Make you my irrevocable bride;
Ere I feel the nuptial noose or halter
Round my throttle permanently tied;
While the hour is open for repentance,
Hear the following prayer which I despatch
Else, before the priest pronounces sentence,
I propose to scratch.
-
I implore you not to be too sniffy
Should my lack of culture cause you pain;
Do not petrify your Albert if he
Fails to fathom your unusual brain;
Promise you will temper your ideas
To the taste of just an average man;
Promise, Sophonisba, not to be as
Clever as you can.
Fostered at the fount of higher knowledge,
You enjoyed a chance denied to me;
I was never schooled at Bedford College,
I was nursed at Balliol's homely knee;
Therefore make allowance for the mental
Lapses which invite your lips to laugh,
And, as you are strong, be very gentle
To your feebler half.
Epigrams, in private, I could swallow;
If you made my manly pride to flinch
From a wit too fleet for me to follow,
I could always smack you at a pinch ;
But in public, when you take the trophy
For the finest table-talk in Town,
Do not knock me sideways, O my Sophie;
Let me softly down. O. S.
AN EXAMINATION PAPER FOR JUDGES.
[A Bill providing for the appointment of two more Judges of the
High Court is now before the House of Commons. Mr. Punch
ventures to suggest that no barrister should be raised to the Bench
unless he can answer the following questions satisfactorily. Knowledge
of the world is, after all, as important as a knowledge of Law and the
rules of procedure.]
I. WHO is HARRY LAUDER 2 Where and when and how
often does he do what? Has he ever travelled abroad 2
If so, state where and how he travelled and how many
bouquets of flowers were presented to him, by whom.
What costume does he look best in 2
II. Write short life - histories of G. B. SHAw, A. B.
WALKLEY and G. K. CHESTERTON.
III. If Mr. SHAw, Mr. WALKLEY, Mr. CHESTERTON and
Mr. BELLOC were locked up in a room together for an hour,
what do you consider would be the probable result, on the
assumption that all type-writing machines, pens, pencils,
ink and paper had been previously removed and that only
three gags had been provided for the four of them 2
IV. What are the favourite drinks of (a) Mr. BELLoc,
(b) Mr. CHESTERTON ?
W. Give a short working definition of “back-chat,” with
examples of its use, (1) by a music-hall singer, (2) by three
occupants of a box plus six bottles of champagne with
liqueurs to follow,
VI. What, if any, is your theory of “chuckers out"?
If A., a chucker-out, measures six feet four inches, and B.,
a noisy member of the audience, measures only five feet
five, what in your opinion will be the upshot of a meeting
between them on the top of a stone staircase leading to a
granite pavement 2
VII. Explain the meaning of the following expressions,
giving examples of the use of each, and mentioning in every
case the status, age and profession of those who use them :—
“Quisby, my boy”; “He’s got all the fat"; “It’s a
perfect frost "; “Not 'arf”; “He’s got bubbles in his
think-tank”; “She’s a fair knock-out”; “A sockdolloger
on the jaw"; “The Field a monkey"; “ Dormy two ";
“None o' your lip ’’; “I’ll push your fice in "; “The
spondulicks”; “’Arf a thick 'un.”
VIII. “This Court is not a theatre.” Examine the
truth of this statement in the light of some recent trials.
Give the names of four jocose Judges, with examples and
brief analyses of their jokes.
IX. Can you quote Latin and French 2 If so, quote
some of each and translate into idiomatic English.
X. State what you know about Dresden China; Dress-
makers' Bills; Ladies' Hats; Turf Accountants; Journa-
lists' Salaries; Publishers' Readers; Railway Porters;
Mining Royalties; The Stock Exchange; The Price of
Coals; Grammar; Deportment; and the Duties of Bishops.

(With acknowledgments to a widespread advertisement.)
WHAT is more silent and lonely than the life of a
bachelor 2 Even with married couples or in large families
there are frequently moments of almost intolerable dull-
ness, gaps in the conversation, hiatuses of sound. Buy
the Crypts of Clamour and make your existence a melodious
and a cheerful thing. What are the Crypts of Clamour 2
They look like the ordinary furniture castor; but are they 2
No. Every one of them conceals a miniature barrel-organ
that plays in rotation all the popular airs of the day. Fit
them to your tables and chairs, fasten them to your otto-
mans and settees, clap them to your bedsteads and your
book-cases; let the sofa become tonic and the dumb-waiter
burst into song. The pianola will be instantly superseded
and the gramophone a thing of the past. Straddle across
your chair and ride round the room, and you can enjoy all
the finest music of the hour at a minimum of expense.
Spring-cleaning becomes a vast orchestral symphony and
the drawing-in of chairs to dinner produces the blare of a
restaurant band. The little ones will love them. Fastest
over polished boards and linoleum, they give an exquisite
if softer rendering on Axminsters and Turkeys. Papa will
never go to the Club now. Ten-and-sixpence each, they
last for a lifetime, and can be procured of all pianoforte-
dealers and ironmongers in the United Kingdom by
enclosing a coupon from this paper. Notice our trade-

AT THE PLAY.
“PRISCILLA RUN's Away.”
You know the dear old story of the
“Prince's Wooing ”: how he had to
contract an alliance with a Princess
whom he had never seen, how he dis-
guised himself as an ordinary subject
and made love to her in the ordinary knew, I am sure, that the Fourth Act
way, and how, finally, when they met
as Prince and Princess, they discovered
that they had given their hearts to
each other long long ago. It is one
of the four magazine stories of the
world. Well, I thought that this
comedy of ELIZABETH ARNIM's, which
Mr. TRENch presents at the Hay-
market, was going to be that
story. It begins in the usual
way with the official betrothal
of Henry, Prince of Lucerne, to
the Princess Priscilla of Lothen-
Kunitz. Priscilla, who is as
pretty and proper a girl as you
will meet on a summer's day,
refuses to be handed over like a
parcel to Henry, and runs away
to England; settling down in
Creeper Cottage, Symford, with
her maid, Annalise, and her old
tutor, Fritzing. Act II. opens on
the cottage, and of course I
expected Prince Henry to turn
up in disguise; he could have
done this for all stage purposes
by shaving off his diminutive
moustache. But to my intense
relief he didn't, and the reaction
was so great that, had the re-
maining scenes been much less
funny than they were, I should
still have enjoyed them to the full
and felt grateful to their author.
The Countess ARNIM, in fact,
had a more subtle idea in her
head. Her heroine was filled
with the desire to do good—to
dwell among the poor and help
them at first hand. Living in a
castle at home, she had amused herself
by building cottages in the air; now
was her chance of making her dreams
come true. “Helping" went forward
merrily at Symford. Money was
showered on the villagers till there was
none left to pay the real bills; the
Symford Sabbath, as established by the
Vicar's wife, was broken with a tea to
the children; the ears of the Vicar's
son were boxed and the heart of the
young Squire captured. And so on
and so on. By the end of a fortnight
our dear I’riscilla's well-meant chickens
were coming home to roost. Sadly she
began to realise that she could not get
out of her class, that she could neither
help nor be happy in her new sur-
roundings. Instinctively her heart
went back to home. . .
Princess Priscilla
Prince Henry
And then the Prince comes in. You
see he had guessed all along what
would happen.
It is a pretty comedy, which drops
perhaps too easily into farce. I am
afraid that Countess ARNIM plays for
the laugh; she is inclined to pursue a
good joke just a little too long. She
(at Lothen-Kunitz) was a mistake, but
the temptation to be funny (and she
was very funny) about the official in-
fluenza of the truant Princess was too
strong for her. It is a pity; for much
of the play was so good that one feels
that it might all have been so much
better.
Once again I am convinced that,
whatever else they may tell me is
wrong with England, there is nothing
the matter with English acting. Nor
with English beauty, I may add, when
Miss NEILSON - TERRY is to be seen.
For so young a leading lady she was
astonishingly at ease on the stage;
her success in a long part upon which
everything depended was triumphant.
Perhaps her face expresses her emotions
rather too obviously—I make the sug-
gestion diffidently, for where all is so
pretty it were churlish to complain.
To mention all the other good per-
formances is impossible, but one or
two must be singled out. Mr. LYALL
Swete as Fritzing gave the play im-
mense assistance; he was a tower of
strength in the two English Acts. Mr.
Miss NE1 isox-TER
Mr. CHARLES MAUDE.
CHARLEs MAUDE made a perfect German
prince—he has acquired a habit lately
of fitting perfectly every part he plays.
Miss SYDNEY FAIRBROTHER has only to
speak to make the elect laugh; it was
an additional joy to find that the author
had provided her with so many good
things. But perhaps the best study of
the evening among the smaller parts
was the young Squire of Mr. DoNALD
CALTHROP-a name to be looked out
for in future programmes. And, re-
membering appreciatively these and
other performances, one must not forget
how much of one's enjoyment was due
to Mr. NorMAN McKINNEL's skill in
casting the play.
“Sitting on the doorstep he cut it
open º and read it, leaning
against the lintel in the sunlight.”
“Daily Mail "Feuilleton.
The context shows that he didn't
really cut the doorstep open
(fastidiously or otherwise); but ||
there is nothing to explain how
he got his head successfully on
the lintel, unless he was a very
tall man indeed.
From “Commercial Notes” in
The Dundee Advertiser:-
“Sºrain whisky is slightly more cheer-
ful, there always being a certain demand
for this description, but at best it is of a
hand to mouth character.”
[EDITOR: “I don't think you
need rub this one in.”

often get such a chance, but of
course if you wish me to spare
them—well anyhow let me put it

in quieting over-strung nerves, to the
undoubted benefit of the affairs of the
Nation, it is being asked, Why should
the Conference come to any decision ?
why not let it become a permanent
institution 2 -
“The Persian cake,” says the Tig-
liche Rundschau, “probably will soon
come to be divided. What is it that
Russia and Great Britain are still
waiting for 2 Is it Germany's per-
mission ?” The answer is in the neg-
ative.
“The Royal Academy holds its own
as one of the most attractive exhi-
bitions of London,” says Black and
White. Yes, those persons who prate
about our becoming decadent and soft
forget the crowds of people who still
go through every room at Burlington
House without flinching.
It is good news that, after all, we are
to see Sir Joh N HARE on the stage
again. But he has said good-bye to
long runs, he informs us. We hope
that this does not mean that he is no
longer quite himself. “To run like a
Hare " had almost passed into a
proverb. ..: :::
“The methods of our telegraph
service are remarkable,” says Mr.
HENNIKER HEATON, the apostle of
cheap postal communication. “For
instance, no one can understand why
the words ‘St. Pancras' and ‘St.
Giles' count as one word, while other
words, such as ‘Charing Cross,’ are
charged as two.” It is rumoured that,
now that this anomaly has been
pointed out, the Post Office will set the
matter right by treating “St. Pancras”
and “ St. Giles" like “Charing Cross.”
The French Ministry of Public In-
struction, as recorded in last week's
I’unch, has conferred the Order of Les
Palmes Académiques on “Little Tich,”
and he thus becomes an officer of the
Academy. Is it possible, we wonder,
that the French Ministry confused
The Oxford, where our distinguished
countryman is now appearing, with
the University of that name?
It is now rumoured that the honour
bestowed on “Little Tich '' is to be
followed by two others no less sensa-
tional. The Emperor MENELIK and
the MAD MULLAH, to signalise the fact
that Death cannot kill them, are to be
lected honorary Immortals.
Reference was made in the press, the
other day, to a member of the staff
who was known as the “Father of the
British Museum.” And the young
men who run up the ladders in the
Library are, we presume, known as
the Step-sons?
The policeman's substantial foot,
which has so often been the subject of
happy jest, has at length been justified,
and may yet be sung by the poets. A
constable who was bathing, not long
ago, near Molesey Lock, felt some-
thing clutch him. It turned out to be
a boy who had got into difficulties
while bathing, and had sunk for the
third time when he felt the policeman's
foot, seized hold of it, and was brought
to land.
The Earl of YARMoUTH has produced

Among the passengers by the Ortega,

THE APPROPRIATOR.
LIFE has not been quite the same
since Lambert joined my club. He
was elected about a year ago and just
before the ballot Henderson told me
he was going to pill him. When I
asked why, he said, “Oh, he's a poison-
ous fellow,” but did not explain where-
in this toxic quality resided. As a
matter of fact Lambert has no poison
in him at all. He is a dapper little
man, with a well-trimmed beard, a
persistent smile and a beaming eye.
He exudes amiability, and if he does
shave his forehead to look intellectual,
as some malicious people say, the
effect is quite impressive. He has
rather a florid taste in socks, but that is
not exactly a deadly sin, and he affects
a hat with a flat brim, which I per-
sonally detest. By profession he is
an architect, but he is a man of inde-
pendent means, and his real calling is
that of a collector — a collector of
friends, other people's friends.
In my own case it began with Moly-
neux. I have known Molyneux for
about fifteen years, and if the truth be
told I was rather proud of the friend-
ship, for Molyneux is quite a big gun
in his way, a distinguished artist and
author, and a great traveller. Well, it
appears that Lambert met him in Italy,
where Molyneux had been smashed up
in a motor accident, nursed him for a
fortnight, and escorted him home.
Since then I have hardly ever been able
to approach Molyneux except through
Lambert. If ever I produced any
evidence of my friendship, Lambert
promptly went one better. Suppose
I had heard from him a week ago,
Lambert would show me a letter re-
ceived that morning. Did I volunteer
the statement that he was looking |
much better, Lambert would explain ||
that he had persuaded him to take up ||
fencing again. If I expressed surprise
that he had not been at the club of |
late, Lambert would observe, “Haven't ||
you heard 2 Old Alec's gone down to
Norfolk for a week to shoot with the
Greshams.” I think it was that “Old
Alec ’’ that finished me, so far as
Molyneux was concerned.
My next loss was Blandy. Blandy is
something of a celebrity too—an F.R.S.
who has played cricket for his county
and written a couple of capital novels.
I used to play piquet with him a good
deal at one time, but that is ancient
history now. Blandy, like many robust
people, is a bit of a hypochondriac, and
periodically thinks he has got some
mortal complaint. Lambert met him in
a country house in one of these fits and
recommended the new starving cure.
Blandy tried it with success, and now

THE SUFFRAGETTE THAT KNEw Jiu-JITsU.

Lambert is permanently installed as
his dietetic adviser. Blandy has given
up piquet for Swedish gymnastics,
never comes to the club, and any drib-
lets of information that reach me about
him come through his hygienic father-
confessor.
Still there was Jefferson left—the
life and soul of the club, whom I re-
garded as my particular friend. But I
use the past tense, for Lambert has
collected and appropriated him also.
Six months ago he had not even a
nodding acquaintance with him. Now
they call each other by their Christian
names. Still, I am bound to admit
that Lambert showed remarkable tact
at the outset. A seedy man called at
the club one day and asked to see
Jefferson. The porter sent a page-boy
in pursuit, and shortly afterwards
Lambert came into the hall, on which
the seedy one promptly accosted him on
the assumption that he was Jefferson.
Lambert instantly spotted the man as a
cadging impostor, never revealed his
identity, but disposed of him in about
three minutes at the cost of the usual
half-a-crown. Naturally Jefferson was
grateful. All the same I am beginning
to think that Lambert is a poisonous
fellow, quite apart from his flat hat-
brim and florid hose.

PUNCH,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Exth Acted FRoM rii E DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday, June 27.
—It is a not uncommon thing to take
the work of a popular author, select
sentences or passages, and present his
wit and wisdom in sort of potted meat
form for refection of the public. Why
should practice be confined to books?
Why not apply it to speeches delivered
in Parliament? They are reported at
greater or less length, are more or less
closely read, and disappear with the
putting away of the morning paper.
These reflections occur after listen-
ing to Lord CARRINGTON. Does not
obtrude himself on debate. Never
speaks without uttering things the
world would not willingly let die. His
utterances present rare combination of
practical knowledge, worldly wisdom,
sly humour and perfect phrasing.
“As a family man,” he remarked the
other day, “I do not think that dry-
nursing is the best way of bringing up
an infant.”
There you have, in less than a score
of words, the whole ethics of the
nursery.
This afternoon his singular gift of
manipulating words and phrases served
to deliver Department over which he
presides from what, on face of it,
seemed dire dilemma. CLIFFORD OF
CHUDLEIGH brought under notice of
House case where cattle food had been
sold which, according to report of
official county analyst, contained 40
per cent. of wood saw-dust. County
Council desired to prosecute the honest
tradesman; Board of Agriculture re-
fused necessary consent.
Affair certainly looked pretty black.
Adulteration of food bad enough in
case of human beings. They, at least,
can make articulate protest. When,
as LoNDONDERRY puts it, you come to
dumb animals, or to horses whose con-
versation is “Neigh, neigh,” fraud is
unpardonable. Here we find Board
of Agriculture in collusion with the
criminal.
CARRINGTON speedily put new aspect
on things.
“My Lords,” he said, “the article
in question consisted of a mixture of
molasses and some absorbent material.”
Delightful ambiguity about the
phrase, “some absorbent material.”
A less bold man would have stopped
there, leaving noble Lords to form
individual opinions as to the compo-
sition of the absorbent material. Not
so CARRINGTON. Out hunting, when he
comes to a five-barred gate, he takes it,
leaving others to find safer ways round.
Carries the principle into Parliamentary
affairs.
A Ristoci: ATIC “MATERIAL DERIVEn FroM "
SMITH.
Earl Carrington defends saw-dust as a pala-
table food for dumb animals.
“This absorbent material,” he con-
tinued, “is no doubt derived from
wood, and it is understood that some
chemical treatment, which is secret, is
employed whereby it becomes to some
extent digestible.”
Note the shrewdness with which he
introduces suggestion of secrecy. By
subtle intimation implies that if we
only knew the process we should recog-
nise in it one that made saw-dust more
palatable than hay, more feeding than
Oats.
While their Lordships pondered on
this hidden beneficent process, beside
“Napoleon B. Haldane . . . visibly shrank.”
which Aladdin's manipulation of old
lamps was nought, the MINISTER of
AGRICULTURE resumed his seat. As he
did so it struck him that perhaps the
brevity of his remarks might seem
lacking in full measure of courtesy.
Half rising, and with airy wave of
hand, “I shall be happy,” he added,
“to consider any new points that may
be submitted to me on the subject.”
This considerateness was superfluous.
House felt he had really left nothing to
be said. Forthwith proceeded to dis-
cuss question of the over-insurance of
ships.
Business Dome.—Lord CARRINGTON
defines saw-dust as “an absorbent
material derived from wood.” The
compilers of that monumental work,
The Orford Dictionary, happily have
not yet reached the letter S. Will
doubtless avail themselves of this con-
tribution to their labours.
Thursday night.—Ministerialists
jubilant at LLoyd GEORGE's fairy-tale
of Finance told to-night on introducing
his second Budget. Expenditure going
up by leaps and bounds. What with
Old Age Pensions and more Dread-
noughts, it almost touches the round
200 millions. Compared with last
year's realised income, this looks like
more taxation. Not a bit of it. With
trade expanding in all directions, the
CHANCELLOR is able to anticipate in-
crease of revenue that will not only
meet full expenditure but make pro-
vision for reduction of National Debt
by over nine millions and a half, pay
for more Dreadnoughts, hand out Old
Age Pensions, and provide for the early
stage of extension of system to Old
Age paupers.
And still SoN AUSTEN is not happy.
Laments over wasted time and oppor-
tunity.
“Why,” he asks, “did you not bring
in a Resolution authorising collection
of Income Tax last year 2 It could
have been carried during two of those
wasted hours when we went away and
dined at home.”
“Wasted hours when we dine at
home !” exclaimed MEMBER FOR SARK.
“It seems only the other week I was
present at his wedding. How early
comes to some men disillusion.”
Dealing in detail with provisions of
new financial scheme, SoN AUSTEN's
apprehension of the future deepens.
Sees no gleam of light anywhere.
“A Jeremiah who has been found
out,” LLOYD GEORGE calls him, as he
gloats over the prospect of expanding
trade and growing national prosperity.

lant. Additional whiskey tax of 3s. 9d.

HUNT dismisses the force as “nothing

dity, a deliberate
fraud used to de-
ceive and humbug
the people of this
country.” What
is wanted is con-
scription.
“Every conti

new house?” “Does old Blank still
... ?” “What kind of team have you
this year?” And so forth. And here
I would ask why it is that, even when
the interval since one last was there is
comparatively short, one is surprised to
find the people still living? Do they
too marvel that you are alive? Per-
haps it is not so with every one, but
with me it certainly is. But one feels
it more in a town than in a village,
and more of people that one knew only
by sight than of real acquaintances.

That is one of the inevitable
phenomena that attend my
periodical returns to a certain
large town where I once lived
at the most acutely noticing
age; another is the accuracy
with which I recognise merely

In time, as we ran over this

Arthur Seal, who used to be a
wild fast bowler and spread
terror over the neighbouring
clubs. I had known him as a
long and weedy, impetuous and
rather quarrelsome lad who
slammed them in without think-

none the less. Very strange that to such
a lad should fall so responsible a post.
That he should have become a con-
stable was all right, I know, for I
chanced to meet him once on a Bank
Holiday, not long after he had joined
the Force, and I could see. He had
come down to visit his people for the
day: his poor overworked, overtired
faded mother; his not too steady father
(does it ever happen that a young
constable has to take his father into
custody ?—not by any means an im-
possible contingency);
and sisters, all on the land. A group
of his old companions were with him—
satellites, admirers, marvellers—when

But I cannot accept the detective so
readily. To an outsider a detective is
a very different creature from a police-
man. His methods are different :
massiveness goes and sagacity comes
in, or should do so; the slow processes,
the ponderous civility, of the policeman
would stand in the way of a man
whose business it was to insinuate, to
persuade, to deduce. I once watched
a policeman at a critical moment in
his brothers the grip of indecision: it was the most
horrifying moment of my life, for a top
window in a poor street was emitting
flames and smoke, and a frantic mother
had just flung one child forth,
to be killed on the stones below,
and was preparing to throw
another. I was in a hansom
and saw it all in a flash, and
º saw too a policeman at the

I detective – detectives should
have a mind prepared to act
at once on any emergency; and,
this being so, it perplexes, one
to find that they have been
policemen first.
Are there, then, no little
detectives 2 one wonders. Are
all detectives six feet in height?
Yet the little men should be

ing, and who a year or so ago
had become a policeman in London.
Since then, however, he had been
promoted. “Arthur's a detective now,”
they said; “a plain-clothes man.”
Now here was a surprising thing,
and at the same time a problem solved,
for I had always wondered how detec-
tives came about. Ten years ago,
had anyone asked me to look round
the field and pick up the cricketer who
was destined one day to be a detective,
I should have passed over Arthur in-
stantly. Not he, at any rate, I should
have said. Yet there he is, in plain
clothes, at Scotland Yard every morn-
ing, waiting to receive his mysterious
orders and set forth on his man-hunting
expeditions into strange streets—most
obviously, as I would wager, a detec-
tive to every one with an eye in his
head, particularly an eye for boots, but
unavoidable and terrible and inexorable
we met: I was struck by his increased
size, his carriage, his importance, in
short.
-- :: º: º:
The uniform, you see, had been at
work. Belt, buttons, badge, tunic,
helmet, leviathan boots, truncheon,
waterproof cape, gloves—all had been
busy these few months to get import-
ance, self-respect, authority into Arthur
Seal; and they had done it, when prob-
ably everything else would have failed.
He stood there, the idol of his awk-
ward rustic contemporaries, a triumph
of uniform's power, literally the crea-
tion of clothes. Other influences had
helped too, no doubt: drilling, a marti-
net inspector, the fear of disgrace, the
craven attitude of small children; but
to uniform, to clothes, I attributed
most of the victory. Looking at him
and talking with him, I understood that
the evolution of a policeman was com-
doubtless knows best ; and
there Arthur Seal is, six feet and more,
a plain-clothes man, dedicated to the
unravelling of mysteries and the appre-
hension of criminals. But if there is
anything in the theory that the child
'is the father of the man the best kind
of detective work will not be extracted
from that wild fast bowler who used to
slam them in without thinking and
retire from the club in a huff after
every third match.
And another thought comes in, too.
Can plain clothes undo the work of

THE BACKGROUND.
THERE was something about the man
in the railway carriage that puzzled me.
His face seemed strangely familiar and
yet I could not place him. He looked
up from his paper at me with a twinkle
in his eyes.
“Not sure whether you know me?”
he said.
For one moment the thought flashed
across my mind that he was the
rate-collector—an estimable gentleman
whom I have only glanced hurriedly at
through a window—but the twinkle
reassured me. Rate-collectors have a
glare, but they never twinkle.
“Seen you somewhere,” I said, “but
I can’t settle where.”
“Perhaps you’ve seen my portrait.”
“Ah!” I exclaimed, letting my mind
go back to my morning paper. “Let
me see, are you the Tariff Reform
Candidate for Chipping Sodbury, or the
new croquet champion, or the gentle-
man who brought an action to recover
insurance of an elephant?”
“No, no,” cried the stranger; “I’m
far more important. You've seen my
portrait hundreds of times.”
“‘SPRING ONIONs,’ RoberT BLATCH-
Ford, Mr. PLOWDEN ?” I hazarded
rapidly.
“No, Sir,” replied the stranger with
dignity, “I am the background.”
“The background !” I exclaimed.
“Yes, Sir. When photographic illus-
trations became an important factor
in the newspaper world many splendid
prints were spoilt by the gross mis-
conduct of spectators. I recall an
illustration of Sir Isambard Griffin
opening the Camp Hill Lunatic Asylum.
This splendid print was ruined because
a miscreant standing by was yawning
at the moment the photograph was
taken. Now if I had been posted by
Sir Isambard I should have assumed
an expression of intense civic en-
thusiasm like this.”
I accepted the background's state-
ment as to the meaning of his facial
contortions.
“You see my point, Sir. If the
spectators in the background of a
picture look intensely interested the
paper readers think they ought to
be interested too. Perhaps you re-
member me now. I am the man who
shook hands with PAULHAN when he
alighted in Manchester. You recall
my look of glowing enthusiasm and the
French flag I held in my left hand. I
saved the situation, Sir, for the other
spectators were all stodgy. They
would have ruined the print. You saw
me at Oxford the other day. The
undergraduates were grinning at Mr.
Roosevel.T and would have spoilt the
effect. Happily I was there gowned—
you will recall my expression. I tried
to make it one of scholarly admiration
for a man of action.
“Of course these are simple things—
I have far more difficult subjects. It
is often my duty to be on the steps of
the Law Courts when a painful case
has been tried. You will remember
how gallantly I raise my hat when the
pretty witness, who has been so severely
cross-examined, leaves the Courts. I
try to give myself the air of a sympa-
thetic stranger, eager to come forward
and protect beauty in distress. Ah, I
get out here. Important business at
Westminster. Keep your eyes on the
press and you will see me. Good
morning.”
When I glanced at the next number
of The Cackler I saw a snap-shot, “The
Marquis of Carabas tells Lord Pogmore
a funny story.” From the faces of the
Marquis and the Peer I should have
judged that the story concerned
funerals, the super-tax or some other
painful subject. But a yard in the
rear was the background writhing with
convulsive laughter. Once more he
had saved the situation.

our BookING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. Rich ARD DEHAN's name is new to me, and so, to
some extent, are his methods. He belongs to a school of
novelists which seems to be growing—a school which is
giving a welcome new life to the DickPNs, tradition. Mr.
WILLIAM DE MoRGAN is its leader. Mr. J. C. SNAITH, on
the strength of his novel of some years ago, Broke of
Covenden, might be counted of it. Mr. MALLock's novel of
last year—to name no more—should entitle him to a place.
The school has two chief virtues. It gives you brains, and
it gives you good measure. Mr. DEHAN's characteristics,
apart from these two, are, first, a skill in weaving a great
network of interests, all of which, however unimportant
apparently, are essentially parts of the whole; and,
secondly, what I must call a very wide human sympathy
which at times makes - - - - - - - - -
him a little melodra-
.
briefest, of the sketches that go to make up A Matley
(HEINEMANN). There is much else in the book that is
more worthy of its author; and in its varied “moods and
patches” will be found something, as the advertisements
say, to suit all tastes. Personally I confess that Mr. GALS-
worthy is a writer from whom I can snatch at best a half-
fearful joy. He is so easily offended. I love him dearly
when he is trenchant, and a trifle malicious, about other
people. “A little man in a long coat, with a red nose and
very long arms, always half-drunk—a sort of desperate cha-
racter, and long since, of course, a schoolmaster,” is the kind
of appreciation which would make me, who have known
many schoolmasters, chuckle delightedly, if I could only be
sure that something equally trenchant about reviewers was
not waiting on the next page! Still, admirers of Mr. GALs-
worthy's always thoughtful and nearly always distinctive
work will certainly welcome A Motley, and none the less
for retrieving in it many pieces, hitherto fugitive, which
- - - they will be glad to find
matic. The Dop Doctor
(HEINEMANN) is full of
incident and surprise.
If you rattle through it
superficially you will
think that Mr. DEHAN
has a supreme con-
tempt for the accepted
ideas of form and
balance in a novel. You
will catch yourself
wanting to say to him,
“Look here, you can't
do this. You've killed
off one of the principal
people. How on earth
are you going to get
through the three hun-
dred odd pages that
remain 2" But you'll
be rash to ask questions.
If you skim and skip
you will be throwing
away a chance of en-
joyment which novel-
reading nowadays sel-
dom presents. Nearly '-
all the characters are so thoroughly worked up that they
might be principals, and one more or less killed off-
you can kill off a good many folk if you plant them at
Mafeking during the siege—makes little difference.
LITTLE WORRIES OF
As to
the story, to put it very crudely, and pull only the
stoutest thread from the network, it deals with a
doctor who loves and is thrown over, drinks hard and is
reclaimed, loves once more and is at last happy. That
sounds commonplace, but whatever else The Dop Doctor
may be it is not that. -
One of these days I shall write a little story about a poor
exile who works hard to save enough money for his return
to his native land. He shall work and save, and at last
the needed sum shall be attained. Then he shall go to a
tavern, and there over a bottle shall display it exultingly,
all the crisp notes of it, to his envious companions. And

caught and caged for

I recommend The
Diary of a Soldier of
Fortune (WERNER
LAURIE) to the notice
of those who regard
Rhodesia merely as a
country from which to
extract wealth. Mr.
STAN L E Y Po R T A L
HYATT spent seven
years in Rhodesia, and
although he was dead
broke when he left he
can still write, “And
yet I love the country
and I believe in the
country.” The diary
is a record of failure,
but it has a value
which is wanting in
many records of suc-
cess. It will teach us,
at any rate, to appre-
ciate the services of
men who do pioneer
work and eventually see others—less courageous than them-
selves—step in and grasp the rewards. Here is to be found no
self-glorification, but an excellently written account of the
lives of men who have been down to the bottom of things
and who have done sound work on the journey. Mr. HYATT
has causes for bitterness, and in spite of his efforts to
restrain himself he shows his feelings; but if he cared to be
less self-restrained he could, I think, write a book of revela-
tions. Here he reserves too much of his scorn for the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HUMOROUS JULY.
[Dedicated gratefully to the Worshipful Master of the Salters' Company.]
THERE was a time, too far to trace,
Ere almanacks became absurd,
When Seasons kept their proper place
And even Summer still occurred;
And there were dog-days—every dog had one—
When in the blue you sported like a puffin,
Or lashed the long-hop till your skin was done
Brown as a muffin.
'Twas then that, as the shadows fell,
And earth took on her loveliest mood,
You loathed to lose the evening's spell
And go and stuff yourself with food;
So fair, in fact, the face of Nature shone,
So well the outer world eclipsed the inner,
Strange as it now seems, you'd have gladly gone
Without your dinner.
What joy could oxtail (thick or clear),
What bliss could pigeon-pie convey
Compared with punting by the weir
Down the long beams of dying day ?
Dearer, I take it, in the sunset glow,
Your toying with Belinda's tangled chignon,
Than relatively vulgar riz-de-veau,
Or filet migmon.
But, ah! those halcyon days are dead,
Killed when the weather-monger's schools
Romped in where seraphs feared to tread,
And tampered with the Seasons' rules;
We that were wont to live on dew and air
Now lurk indoors to dodge the gelid blizzard,
And Satan finds a deal of mischief there
For idle gizzards.
We never worried how to feed
When Summer used to prank the sward;
We should have mocked the gourmet's greed
For pleasures of the groaning board;
Now, thanks to blithering slush and blinding sleet,
When all the sun-forsaken ways are wet,
There is no earthly solace save to eat
A City banquet.
Thither my sodden fancies swoop
Like hungry “dragons of the prime”;
I shah be ready for the soup
Whole hours before the usual time;
God bless the Guild, whose noble halls to-night
Shelter my head from skies morose and dirty;
Worshipful Master! I'll be there all right
(“Six for six-thirty.”)
O. S.
The Arrivals.
To the Editor of “Punch" and all other His Majesty's
loyal subjects.
GENTLEMEN, If on Friday, July 8, you were concerned
to notice two new families in London, whereas the list
of arrivals in your Times of that date only mentioned
one, you may set your minds at rest and go about the City
with light hearts, upon learning that the second family,
which got out of the train at Vauxhall and is not staying
at the Piccadorf Hotel, belongs to
Yours, as truly as usual, MYSELF.
HORSES AND OLD AGE.
THE windows of my room look out on an asphalted
street, where the traffic, such as it is, is never busy. Here
at intervals may be seen pairs of omnibus horses, detached
from their gaudy omnibus and trotting gaily to or from
their work. One is bestridden by a man who, having no
saddle, bounces awkwardly enough on his patient mount,
and thus they clatter along the asphalte, ready to undertake
the burdens of the day, or faring homeward to some
neighbouring stable when their heavy toil is over. Close
by, in another and a busier street, the motor omnibuses
rattle and creak and roar. Soon the last horsed 'bus will
have vanished, and the trotting pairs, with their jolly
india-rubber riders, will no longer disturb the silence of my
own retired thoroughfare. I wonder what will become of
the horses, and in what haven they will spend the years of
old age that fate may grant them?
Many years, I fear, they cannot have. The strain of
the load they draw is too great for that. When they are
young they come to their task fierily enough, but the last
spark is quickly extinguished, and in no long time their
limbs begin to stiffen and their heads to droop. Three or
four years of constant stoppages and continual starting are
theirs, and then, if they escape the degradation of a Covent
Garden vegetable van, they may perhaps contribute in an
altered state to the sustenance of cats or dogs. A Master
of Hounds the other day declared that if he were a horse
he could conceive no nobler end that to feed and invigorate
the hounds whose sport he had shared in life. As he has
no chance of assuming pasterns, fetlocks, withers, a mane
and a docked tail, his opinions are, perhaps, not specially
valuable as a guide to the ambitions of a horse. -
Quite recently, as I learn from a newspaper paragraph,
“the oldest racer in the world came in first at Rosenheim,
Bavaria, winning easily by four lengths over a course of
about a mile-and-a-half. The veteran "-so the reporter of
his prowess continued—“is twenty years old, and of
English origin; but for over sixteen years has not been out
of Germany. He has carried his various owners' colours
to victory no fewer than thirty-four times.” Before this
hero, I will undertake to say, all talk of cats' meat or of
hounds' meat is hushed. I imagine him in a gilded and
garlanded stall, where the children of his owner visit him
twice a day, bringing corn in silken bags and stimulating
his appetite with carrots and apples and cubes of beet-
sugar. He, at any rate, is not too old at twenty.
Like other animals, horses live their lives to the very
last (and the last generally comes long before twenty years
have passed) without apprehension of death. Long ago I
remember seeing a horse that had broken its leg on a
country road. The knacker had been summoned, and had,
as he thought, given the death-stroke with his knife. The
horse lay very still, and the knacker was chatting with the
surrounding crowd. Suddenly, with a convulsive heave,
the poor beast raised itself on its three sound legs, and
then, hobbling painfully across the road, began to nibble
grass from the bank as if nothing had happened. The
next moment it had fallen again and was dead. -
Horses as pets suffer under increasing disadvantages,
Amongst ladies, at any rate, the rage is now for the
infinitesimal. Everywhere you see Poms or Pekinese
Spaniels, the most minute animals in the world, peeping
out roguishly from ladies' arms, or following their mistresses
on a lead with absurd importance. One breeder, I believe,

rejoices in the possession of the Princess Wee-Wee, a
Pekinese weighing only three pounds. Obviously horses
cannot be carried about in arms, or retire for the night to
a wickerwork cathedral in the corner of a bedroom.
Yet horses as friends have a thousand attractions. They
are humorous and understand a joke. They are innocently
mischievous and will play with their intimates. Moreover,
they have a high sense of dignity. I remember a grey pony
that could not bear to be laughed at. The boys of the
family knew his weakness and used to go to his stall and
laugh heartily. His fury and his flashing teeth, as he laid
back his ears and strained at his halter to get at them, are
a picture ineffaceably impressed upon my memory. And, .
lastly, there is about a horse a noble and uncomplaining
patience which should move even the heart of a butcher-
boy driving headlong over the rough country roads.
COMPANY FOR BREAKFAST.
(From Mr. Punch's List of Domestic Norelties.)
AN ingenious invention for boiling coffee has recently
been put upon the market. It whistles when the beverage
is ready, and, in fact, does all but speak and ask to be
drunk from. We take this opportunity of announcing that
we have several attractive ideas of the kind up our sleeve.
For instance, we expect a large demand for our new
Eggophone (provisionally protected), which starts crowing
as soon as the boiling-period is passed. We have great
hopes, also, of the Reveillé Frying-pan, which, when the
tasher is done to a turn, emits heart-rending squeals, and
keeps on till the most leisurely over-sleeper is forced to
spring from his bed in order to save his bacon. Our
Train-catching Teapot can be timed to explode at the
precise moment when its owner ought to leave for the
railway station. We have a Muffineer too that rings its
own bell if it thinks its contents are turning chilly. In
short, we can promise some cheery society for the solitary
bachelor.

Tuesday—my chest;
Wednesday—you said I lacked my share of marrow—
I had no zest |
And, though indeed I thought it was a pretty size,
Thursday, my biceps you saw fit to criticise.
As Friday came
I flew in shame
My King to serve—what nerve
Yes, dear, for you I scorned my Folkestone fortnight;
Gamely at camp
I broiled the long, long day, and writhed the short night
With cold and cramp !
“Sergeant ' " I cried, “I’m Bertie; make a man of me !
Set me to work, use ev'ry ounce you can of me !
No need to shove—
I fight for Love'"
And—phew He did No kid
Loved one, good-bye! I did my level best—
Only too well!
Here at the Hydro doctors will attest,
Nurses will tell,
Of this round cheek you stroked, how seared and thin it is;
That, that alone would shatter two affinities
But, worst of woes,
A scarlet nose !
Farewell, dear heart! We part |

| THE ELECTORAL REFORMER'S
MARSEILLAISE.
[Proportional Representation has now defi-
nitely entered the sphere of practical politics.
This is an electoral method, dreadfully abstruse
and involving long mathematical calculations,
by which Parliament is to become a faithful
miniature of the electorate. Its exponents,
headed by Lord Avebury, are moving heaven
and earth for its adoption. The following will,
we trust, enable them to give articulation to
their burning zeal.]
Sons of a noble race, arise!
Our country sorely needs us;
On us Britannia turns her eyes,
A man of title leads us ! -
Unsheath we then our trusty,swords
(By which we mean statistics);
The earth shall mark our weighty words
And learn our cabalistics. -
Once more, aux armes / The promised
land
Is reasonably near us;
The people cannot understand
Our facts, but they will cheer us!
The opposition may be strong,
But only for a season—
No man can argue with us long
And still retain his reason.
Then let's prepare to shed our blood
(In metaphoric diction),
Nor grudge the sacrificial flood
(Continuing the fiction);
And at our mast this signal float
To strengthen our endeavour,
“The Single Transferable Vote—
And Algebra—for ever!” -
THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER.
AN unenthusiastic meeting of inquiry
and protest took place in the nursery
one wet afternoon last week. Norman
organised the meeting, took the chair,
and was the principal speaker, and in a
limited capacity acted as steward.
Standing on the table, among a regiment
of leaden infantry and the underclothes
of a junior doll, he cleared his throat
and began :
“Ladies and gentlemen "
“That's not fair, Norman; why leave
out Peter ?” asked Margaret. Peter
at once showed that he was no gentle-
man, and after the disturbance had
subsided Norman began again.
“Is it fair, is it just—” he said.
“Is it honest, is it manly 2” said
Margaret. - -
“Look here, Margaret,” said Norman
hotly, “you agreed to play, so don't
Peter, you might listen!”
“I don't know what you're talking
about,” said Peter, genially. .

“Don't use long words you don't

taking up a book and settling down
comfortably in the window-seat. Peter
was already busy with a paint-box and
a highly-coloured copy of a railway
engine.
“What I say is, Father ought
to afford a bit more than threepence a

audience reduced to fat Joan. “Of

turning a page.

[JULY 13, 1910.
THE OLD, OLD STORY.
Miss MIDDLEton sighed, helped her-
self to an almond, and tried again.
“Did you go to the Horse Show 2"
she asked.
“No,” I said.
“Oh dear, I did think you would
say ‘Yes’ that time. You know, you
don't give conversation a chance if you
keep on saying ‘No’ to everything I
ask you.” -
“Have you ever fallen off the top of
St. Paul's Cathedral 2'' I asked.
“Yes,” said Miss Middleton at once.
“Heaps and heaps of times. There's
quite a crowd at the top of Ludgate
Hill now, when they know I'm going
up.” - -
“Oh ' " I said, rather taken aback.
“Go on.
I mind much, and what it feels like
when I get to the bottom. And then
you'd find that you knew a man who
slipped off the Albert Hall once, and
we should compare notes and get
awfully interested. And perhaps I
might ask you to come and see
mother.”
“I have met Mrs. Middleton,” I said,
and returned to my thoughts.
“Oh, what 's the matter? You
won't talk, and you aren't eating—at
least, not like sometimes. Has your
favourite son run away to sea 2"
“He has not. And if you want to
know what's the matter, it's this. I'm
bored, and disgusted, and—and—
“Desiccated,” suggested Miss
Middleton.
“No, that's not the word at all.”
“It’s a nice little word, though ; I
read it the other day. “Transmogrified’
—that 's bigger.”
“Well, simply sick to death—of the
weather.”
Miss Middleton turned away and
gazed in the other direction with great
interest.
“I’m not looking at you,” I said.
“But I should like to know, before I
go on ; are you blushing?”
“Of course not. Well, sort of colour-
ing up a little, perhaps.”
“You may well. Do you remember
a certain day in April, when we talked
about the summer, and you solemnly
promised me that this year it would
be fine? And you implored me to
believe, and I said that I would.”
“Did I ?”
“I might have spent the summer in
New Zealand, where it's always fine,
or in bed, where it doesn't matter; but
you persuaded me to give the thing
just one more trial. And now where
are we ?”
“You know,” said Miss Middleton
timidly, after a pause, “it isn't being
Now you should ask me if
such a bad summer, after all, according
to the papers.”
“Oh, that 's what's so mean about
it. The rain stops now and then, and
the sun comes out perhaps, just so as
they can both get a good place in the
statistics. As if we didn't know we
were having a beastly summer! as if
we cared a hang how many inches of
rain or hours of sunshine there were
when we can see that it's spoiling
everything!”
I finished my glass fiercely and
waved away the bird.
“And the worst of it is,” I added,
“I haven't an umbrella.”
“Mightn't you buy one 2" suggested
Miss Middleton.
“How can I, after I've promised
you to believe in the summer ? Of
course if I had my old one—but I lost
that at a wedding. They're tricky
things, weddings. They take your
umbrella as soon as look at you.”
“I always use one of mother's.”
“Couldn't I too?” I asked hope-
fully.
Miss Middleton was silent for a little,
and I supposed that she was consider-
ing my offer. However, it appeared
that she was thinking of something
else.
“I do think we are all awfully nice
about the weather,” she began seriously.
“I am often even nicer than this,” I
said, in some surprise.
“Oh, I don't mean you — you've
been a pig; when you know I did
want you to have a nice summer so
badly. I mean all of us. We have a
fortnight of rain, and then, when we
get one fine day at last, we're all as
grateful as anything, and we go about
smiling and saying thank you, and ||

“Yours.”
“But how nice of you ! Well then,
in mine, and you'll think it's the very
jolliest world that ever was made, and
what a lucky man you are to be given
such a wonderful morning.”
I considered this carefully; and I
also considered the last fortnight. I
decided to concentrate on the last
fortnight.
“Meanwhile,” I said, “here we are,
and it 's time something was done by
way of protest. The only difficulty is
to know what to do. In America,

“Right,” I said. “I’ll remember

SoME say that I got inside the train.
Anyhow, there was a luncheon-car, and
that was where the porters threw me.

So I prayed that I might have no cis-

man in and he was put to sit opposite |
me. We just frowned sourly and made
it quite clear that we detested the
sight of each other. I was led to

“A vile thing!” my expression was
meant to convey. “I wonder if It will
make a noise with Its food.” Then he
got behind his Telegraph to protect
himself from infection, and, in returning
the compliment, I managed to unfold
my Morning Post in such a way as
to cause him a maximum amount of
draught and discomfort.
With the beginning of lunch and the
arrival of the fish he said, “I hope I
may never set eyes on you again, but
will you take a little salt 2 ”
“Sir,” I answered, “you are a con-
temptible worm, but permit me to pass
you the pepper.” Later I continued,
“Odious creature, I cannot help con-
fessing to you my surprise that out of
a kitchen 2 ft. by 1 ft. they can pro-
duce a meal apparently without limits.”
“Cad though you are,” he replied,
“I quite agree. Further, it may interest
you to know that I am by profession an
inventor.”
IN THE PUBLIC
EYE.
“IT's ONLY 'Is BLOOMIN' SIDE.
It did interest me a little. It came
to interest me very much. I laughed
at his mild jokes, and he leant across
the table to tap me on the chest.
“Yes, my dear Sir,” he said, “I go to
my office at nine every morning and
invent. Sometimes it is a vacuum-
cleaner, sometimes a needle-puncher,
and sometimes an antiseptic tooth
wash.”
“Really, old man,” said I, “if you
don't mind being overheard by the
cads and the contemptible worms in
this car, you might tell me all about
it.”
He practically climbed over the table
to embrace me, as he told me all about
it. At any rate, his boots managed to
wipe themselves on my trousers. “Oh,
but I'm sorry,” he said. “Not at all,”
I answered.
On arriving at Euston, “Good-bye,”
said I. “It has been a real pleasure
to me to travel with such a perfect
gentleman.”
“Nonsense, Sir,” said he.

pleasure and privilege have been mine.
Good-bye; we may never meet again.”
We met again about five minutes
later in the Tube, and somehow I wished
we had not. It's all very well being
amused in a luncheon-car, but, when
you're in London, you always stand
the chance of being seen by people who
know you and are apt to judge you by
your friends. Besides, the man talked
too much. Reaching Charing Cross,
we parted with some more good-byes,
and met again on the top of a Liver-
pool Street bus. At Chancery Lane
he said, “I don't know whether to get
off here and patent some inventions, or
to go to my head office in the City and
invent some patents. Where are you
oing?”
“That all depends,” I said, and as
he eventually decided to get off there
I went on to the City, not because I
wanted to go there, but because . . .
Oh, well, I have come to the conclusion
that people are detestable, after all,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday, July 4.—
After two hours spent in Commons
strolled across corridor intent on dis-
covering whether on the green earth
there were a duller place. Found it in
the Lords. SAYE AND SELE on his legs
moving Second Reading of Bill de-
signed to regulate foreign traffic in
broken-down horses. About a score
of Peers present in subtly sympathetic
state of decrepitude. Had they just
learnt that Conference had decided to
recommend abolition of Veto could not
have presented more funereal aspect.
To this state of affairs SAYE AND
SELE contributed speech that raised
him at a bound to first rank of orators.
Object of his measure commends itself
to every kindly heart. Amid clash
of more pretentious business success
needed nice management. This forth-
coming. As in low voice, occasionally
faltering accents, with doleful counten-
ance, he pleaded the cause of the dumb
and destitute, one could almost hear
the footfall of the doomed horse on the
hard pavement as it slowly wended its
way to the docks to take ship for
Antwerp; could see its work-worn
frame; observe its wistful regard of
the occasional sausage shop passed en
route; recognise its pained conscious-
mess of conditions under which (if
ever) it would return to its native land.
The DERby FAvourite.
“We recall his breezy manner in the Lobby
as he went about the business of the Whip.”
(The Earl of Derby.)
A LITTLE QUIET CHAT with MY FRIEND BIRRELL.
“I conſidently hope that ere long Mr. Russell will be sitting by my side again.
nothing would give Mr. Russell greater pleasure.
I know
(Loud laughter.)”
(Mr. Birrell's speech on the temporary disappearance from the Hourse of Commons of Mr.
T. W. Russell.)
Speech a masterpiece of artistic con-
ception, flawless rendering.
Effect on Earl of DERBY, who fol-
lowed, remarkable. For years we knew
him in the Commons as Lord STANLEY.
Recall his breezy manner in the Lobby
as he went about the business of the
Whip, his brief but pointed speeches
when, on return from South Africa,
having seen active service as Chief
Press Censor (Dispatches), he was ap-
propriately promoted to the War Office.
To-night, seated almost opposite SAYE
AND SELE, he relapsed into forlorn atti-
tude familiar when he was Postmaster-
General worried by demands of work-
ing staff for shorter hours and longer
pay. Interposing in debate he spoke
as one who had come to bury the horse,
not to mount it. Like other noble lords
who followed, he heartily approved
the principle of measure which is
about to be commended to friendly
care of Commons.
Over scene thus artistically shadowed
one gleam of light flashed. Came from
unexpected quarter of Orders of the
Day. These are circulated for infor-
mation of Peers. For title, paper bore
the legend, “Notices and Orders of
the Day for Monday the 4th of July.”
This on first page. Turning over
leaf one found set forth in black letter,
enclosed in double lines so as to mini-
mise chance of its being overlooked by
the most casual backwoodsman, the an-
nouncement, “There will be no Evening
Sitting of the House on Thursday the
30th of June.”
Frequently admitted by most cen-
sorious critics of House of Lords that
in comparison with Commons it is the
more business-like assembly. Here
was crowning proof of its orderliness,
its prevision, its observance of detail,
matters which, apparently unimportant,
go to build up orderly, effective business
system.
Business done.-Officially announced
that the House will not sit last Thurs-
day. Bill dealing with Continental
traffic in broken-down horses read
second time.
House of Commons, Tuesday. —
Period which sufficed for the accom-
plished work of to-day shows what
House can do when it puts shoulder
to wheel. Progress made exceeds
a week's achievement under ordinary |
conditions. After usual cloud of
questions, for practical purposes signify-
ing nothing, entered upon Committee
on Regency Bill. Came to the front
thoseeminent constitutional authorities,
KING and LUTTRELL, with many amend-
ments designed to correct what AshLEY,
with tears in ordinarily inquisitorial
eyes, described as “the magnificent

work standing to credit of the Regency
Act during the last 100 years.”
PREMIER, in charge of Bill, received
valuable support from Sir FREDERICK
BANBURY, whom strangers in gallery
were shocked to hear alluded to as
“the junior Member for the City of
London.” There's nothing junior
about FREDERICK unless it be in
personal appearance suggestive of per-
ennial youth. As a statesman he is
senior to most of his contemporaries in
present House. With his assistance,
. Bill passed through Committee with
immaterial amendments.
Item. Accidents in Mines Bill, in
charge of MASTERMAN READY, passed
second reading amid chorus of approval.
Judicial Bench next stormed. Bill
proposing to add two Judges to King's
Bench Division of High Order of
Justice came up on Report stage.
MARKHAM moved new clause requiring
Judges to make annual return of num-
| ber of days they have sat. Principle
| familiar at dockyards and other large
| labour establishments where time -
keeper ticks off hours of attendance.
MARKHAM, acknowledging that our
Judges are all honourable men, re-
frained from insistence on that in-
| widious condition.
“Leave it to the Judges,” he said
in effect. “Here and there may pos-
sibly be a generous enlargement of
view. What, according to the clock,
has been half a day's labour, or even
a quarter, may, in the hurry of the
moment, be entered as full time. On
the whole, their Lordships may confi-
dently be counted upon to make full
and fair returns.” -
(Wait till they catch him in one of
their courts!)
PREMIER, whilst objecting to this
way of putting it, admitted laxity with

Majority of Members preceding in de-
bate had more or less confined them-
selves to subject. John DILLON, by
exception turning aside to deal with
Whisky Tax, bitterly complained that
the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
had “burned his boats in such em-
phatic manner.” If it must be, John
likes that sort of spiriting done gently,
with absolute freedom from emphasis.
Possibly it was mention of boats
that turned CHARLIE's gaze seaward.
As GoLDSMITH tells of his Traveller, in
all his wanderings “his heart un-
travelled fondly turns to home.” So
our plump sailor-boy, having with more
or less emphasis burned his boats and
come ashore, cannot control the way-
ward trend of his heart towards the
unplumb'd, salt, estranging sea, and the
additional Dreadnoughts that ought to
be afloat upon it.
Unfortunately, in making for blue
water, CHARLIE got under influence of
various undercurrents. These were,
inter alia, the domination of the Irish
Members; the possibilities of Socialism;
and proposals for reforming the House
of Lords, which led him to remark
that “the House of Commons itself
wants reforming.”
CHAIRMAN interposed with quiet re-
mark: “I think it is time the noble
Lord came to the Budget of the year.”
“Ay, ay, Sir,” chirruped CHARLIE;
“starboard it is,” and slewed round to
consideration of Ministerial Naval pro-
gramme.
Getting on very well till it flashed
across his mind that “the Budget of
the year is voted by the House of
Commons, the House of Commons is
elected by the people, and if there
are 53,000 voters sending one man to
the House, and 1,700 sending another
man —”
“Order order!” cried the inexora-
ble CHAIRMAN. “The Budget has no-
thing to do with the Franchise.”
It was here that CHARLIE made his
moan about the “difficulty of getting

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
FASHIons AND A ScANDAL.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,- I've a simply
thrilling bit of news for you. People
are actually beginning to walk, my
dear—and in town' It's getting quite
quite usual to send away one's car and
walk home from shopping or calling,
even as much as two or three streets |
Par consequent, there's been a slump,
as far as certain people are concerned,
in smart, small-sized boots and shoes
that they could only wear to sit still in,
and, as SHARSPEARE says, Those walk
now who never walked before.
Partly we've been frightened by
what Professor Dimsdale told us in one
of his Thé Causeries at the Fal-lal.
The series was on Lost Arts, and he
chose Walking for one of his subjects.
He said that if people continued getting
about by motoring and aeroplaning and
all that sort of thing the race would
gradually alter; everyone would get
enormously stout, and legs and feet
would at last become extinct ' Wasn't
it a ghastly idea? Whatever sort of
fashions would be worn then | Of
course I don't undertake to dispute the
whole of the prediction, but it seems to
me, as far as my own observation of
my dear friends goes, that feet, at all
events, are in no danger of becoming
extinct—quite the reverse! However,
we've all been horribly frightened, and
now we're walking.
Some had forgotten how to do it,
and had to be taught all over again,
like old babies, the Duke and Duchess
of Dunstable, among others. Being
both stout and stodgy, and not nearly
so young as they'd like to be, they took
fright badly at the dear Professor's
hideous prediction, and now that
they've learned to walk again they're
always at it. When it's too wet to
walk out of doors, as it generally is,
they trudge up and down the big ball-
room at Dunstable House; and I hear
each is so aggravated at seeing the
other grinding away, they're on worse
terms than ever.
And the craze doesn't stop at walk-
ing. None of the chaperons will sit
still or play bridge at parties now.
They've all caught the exercise-panic
and insist on dancing. I gave a boy-
and-girl dance for my little cousin,
Rosemary, the other night, and I
simply couldn't prevent the chaperons
from dancing. Those that were too
old and too weird to get real partners
danced with each other. They entirely
spoilt the look of my rooms.
Madame Blagueuse is another who's
been giving Thé Causeries. One of

them was on Beauty, and the room
was packed at five guineas a head.
She told us all women were beautiful;
that all they had to do was to accentuate
their individuality and cultivate charm;
and that no woman need ever grow
old; wrinkles and grey hair and
stoutness were merely the result of
mismanagement It was simply dilly
to see ces autres drinking it all in with
their tea and swallowing it with their
ices, and going away quite pleased and
perky.
I was telling Norty about it after-
wards, and he said if all women are
beautiful then those who are really
nice to look at must find a new word
for themselves, and that I'm to find
that word. He too had a Thé Causerie
(anyone who has anything or nothing
to say makes a Thé Causerie o jit now)
at the Recherché the other day on
“Nature the great Anti-Socialist.” He
did make us laugh. He said there
were no inequalities of fortune so glar-
ing as Nature's inequality in the dis-

He 's a funny boy.
Oh, my dearest! People are whisper-
ing such a quaint little storiette about
—guess—guess—and guess again l—
about Stella Clackmannan, of all
women She's had the reputation for
being absolutely immaculate, you know,
as our nicknames for her, The Saint,
and The Icicle, show. There 've been
plenty of stories about everyone else,
but about her there's always been the
most extraordinary story of all—that
there was no story ! It's true that
some people have said her straight
running was owing to the fact that the
Duke is a mere demon of jealousy, with
all the furious fierceness of his forbears,
the old Chiefs of Clan Kiltibeg, as
shown in the Clackmannan crest and
motto, a drawn claymore and “Slay
and spare not,” and that poor Stella
has always been afraid that if he found
her out in the teeniest little piccadilly
he'd catch up the family crest and act
the family motto; but I don't know
about that. Anyhow, here's the story.
You remember a mannequin we
noticed when you were with me last
summer, and we went to “Olga's" one
afternoon—a tall, pale, statuesque girl,
with a deliciously haughty way of
saying, “Yes, moddom,” and “No,
moddom.” Oh, you must remember
her She showed two creations that I
bought—“The Dream and the Wak-
ing,” poppies worked on black mousse-
line-de-soie, and dawn and sunrise
suggested in the shaded colours of the
train ; and “Arrière Pensée,” in mauve
and white charmeuse, with a hint of
tears in the touches of crystal em-
broidery and a big bunch of purple
pansies on the left shoulder, and
another tucked behind the left ear.
We remarked that, allowing for her
being five or six years younger than
dear Stella, and having perhaps half an
inch more height and less waist, she
was almost her double. Everyone
used to talk about the startling like-
ness. Stella herself was amused at it,
and made a sort of protégée of the girl,
and, according to les chuchoteuses,
made use of the extraordinary likeness
to send the mannequin to fulfil some
of Stella's own philanthropic engage-
ments (opening and shutting things,
you know, and giving away prizes and
so on), at one or two boresome, out-
lying places that didn't matter much.
And then something happened. Oh
no I don't mean that the girl broke
down and gave the show away. I
believe she played the Duchess d
merveille, and completely imposed on
the savage tribes; but on one of these
occasions a letter was in some way
AN ILLUSTRATED POSTER.
conveyed to the fictitious Stella, a letter
meant for the real Stella, a love-letter,
my own Daphne, showing that our
dear Saint not only had an admirer,
but didn't exactly frown on him.
Now, isn't that absolutely 2 As to
what happened afterwards, opinions
are divided. Some people say the girl
still has the letter, holds it over Stella's
head like somebody's sword, and black-
mails her. Others say Stella had
copies made of the Clackmannan
jewels, sold the real ones, bought the
etter, and sent the girl to New
Zealand, or British Columbia, or Fiji,
or somewhere. Anyhow, “Olga's"
tall, statuesque mannequin vanished
utterly, and Stella did a long rest-cure.
Of course, we 're all most enormously
amused, and—well, yes—just a teeny
bit pleased, that our dear Saint should
have stepped down from her little stone
niche and taken off her halo. Halos
must be wretchedly cold, heavy, head-
achy, heartachy things to wear !
IEver thine, BLANCHE.
EVOE VICTIS :
(By our Sloptimist.)
THERE is nothing that marks the
onward progress of humanity, in spite
of many lapses, more nobly than the
treatment of the conquered. In ancient
Rome the situation was tersely summed
up in the iron phrase, Wae victis—“Woe
to the vanquished.” Conquered kings
adorned the triumph of their victors,
and languished in dungeons until death
put an end to their sufferings.
Nor were the Greeks more con-
siderate. SocRATEs, who in our time
might have been a popular and success-
ful preacher, was obliged to drink
hemlock simply because he failed to
convince his judges of the excellence
of his intentions.
Even in “the so-called nineteenth
century” this evil tradition lingered
on, and NAPoleoN, instead of being
allowed to share the Waterloo Stakes
with his victor, was brutally banished
to St. Helena.
Happily we have changed all that
now. It is no longer the inhuman
practice of civilised countries to trample:
on the defeated.
- JACK JoHNSON, the champion prize-
fighter, has pocketed £24,000 as the
reward of his prowess. But JEFFRIEs,
the defeated giant, gets more than
£23,000 as his share. -
Dear friends, if we cannot always be
top dog, let us at least strive to render
the position of the inferior animal
financially endurable.
From a Catalogue:–
“1 New Zealand Kea Parrot (Nestor, Nota-
bilis), very fine specimen. These are the birds
which devour sheep alive. This specimen is
very tame and feeds from hand, also very
amusing.”
We can well imagine its being extremely
funny—with somebody else's hand.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Sir Drummond must have been the hero of many another
novel than The Laird of Craig Athol (CoNSTABLE). At any
rate, when he comes into an estate, left to him by a cousin
in default of any nearer of kin turning up, he knows that
he is in for a poor thing. Though it has been made
abundantly clear that there is no nearer of kin in existence,
previous experience tells him that “there ain't going to be
no " default. So he enters into possession with a heavy
heart, and the merest effort of speering into the future by
the local second-sighter drives him to wire in despair for
his London solicitor. Had I been Sir Drummond, I should
not have thus given in at the beginning of the first chapter.

On the title-page of Mr. EveRARD Hopkins' novel, Lydia
(Constable), appears the dedication “To my Wife.” I
cannot help wondering whether there is not something
rather more in this than the ordinary tribute from an author
to the person whose sympathy may most properly have
encouraged him in his work. Because a more essentially
feminine book I never read. If it be true, as they say,
that the success of a novel depends upon its appeal to the
softer sex, then Mr. HoPKINs is assured of half-a-dozen
editions at least. Women will delight in Lydia ; the
phases of her wooing by various suburban swains will be
to them episodes of intense interest, all the more for being
recorded by the author with a wealth of detail which some-
times I myself (if the secret must come out) felt to be a
little over-elaborate. But then I hated all the young men
so, which probably accounted for it. Lydia's married

Spots in the hope of getting some guidance as to the best
place in which to spend his summer holidays. The quest,
futile in itself, has had a strange development; for, having
tasted blood, he has now acquired a habit, amounting almost
to a mania, of studying posters in general, and drawing the
most unwarrantable inferences as to the wares which they
are designed to commend. -
He has been peculiarly obsessed by the advertisements of
a firm which announces its Whisky through the medium
of two symbolic terriers. These terriers usually have their
attention riveted upon a rat, either in a cage or on a river
bank. Trencham has no quarrel with the dogs' taste,
which no doubt obeys a law of nature, but personally he
detests rodents, whether on land or water; and he cannot
see why any beverage, short of rat-bane, should require
one of these little brutes to advertise its merits.
He assures me that he has nothing against this par-
ticular Whisky; but in future he is going to take to Lime-
juice, because the girl in the poster where the limes grow
thick as gooseberries is rather presentable at a distance,
and there are no rats in the picture. There were the same
arguments in support of a certain Irish Ginger Ale, for the
yachting lady (whom he presumed to be addicted to it,
though there was no Ginger Ale actually in sight) had her
good points, and again there were no rats in the picture;
but, on consideration, he felt sure that the bull-dog was
out of place on a sailing-yacht, and this decided him in
favour of Lime-juice.
Having made up his mind on this point—perhaps a little
too hastily—he could review without emotion the picture
of yet another dog (Trencham's studies have given him a
veritable surfeit of dog) which has knocked over a pewter-
pot of Stout, and in the act of recoiling makes the remark–
“What would Master say?” Trencham now knows what he
would say if he were the master of this vocal hound. He
would ring the bell and say, “Clean up this mess, and bring
me some Lime-juice.” º
My friend suffers at times from dyspepsia and constantly
from agrowing tendency to obesity. Had he the choice(which
he has not) of these two ills, he would prefer the former.
That is why he instantly rejected the advances of a poster
which portrayed the pale victim of a wasting indigestion,
who, after testing the virtues of a certain Syrup, became
“always merry and bright.” Nothing is so hateful to
Trencham as the man who is “always merry and bright.”
But there was worse. In his after-state, in addition to this
terrible mirth (of which indeed it may have been the cause),
the Object had acquired so ridiculous a rotundity that
Trencham at once resolved not to give the Syrup a trial.
Then again there was a poster of a Beef-extract, in
which one of the noble creatures from whom the fluid is
drawn was represented as labouring under a presage of
approaching doom. This spectacle, to one of Trencham's
imaginative temperament, had in it an intolerable pathos.
And yet I have known him to eat a beefsteak without
flinching. But in that case the victim was not allowed to
have a premonition of his end; whereas they somehow
seem to get to know their fate beforehand in the case of
Beef-extracts. Trencham supposes that thoughtless people
leave the bottles lying about.
His logical mind was rufiled by a picture of two cooks—
the one erect and holding a pot of Custard, the other
prostrate among the ruins of his eggs. The second chef is
the object of ribald laughter on the part of his more stable
colleague. Trencham regarded this ridicule as being in the
worst possible taste; but he was also strongly of the opinion
that the artist has begged the whole question. Custard,
he contends, is every bit as brittle as eggs, and why should
not the cook with the Custard have fallen and spilled it, and
the cook with the eggs have remained upon his feet? In
any case, Trencham's chivalrous nature inclined to sym-
pathy with the weaker vessel, and he proposes to continue
his diet of cooking-eggs.
On another poster my friend observed a lion sampling a
bottle of Somebody's Brandy. Outside the Zoo, Trencham's
experience of the habits of big game is but slight,
but he is quite firm in his intention never to carry with
him any brand of spirits that is likely to excite the curiosity
of wild animals.
So much for goods intended for internal consumption.
Of a certain famous Polish, to be applied externally,
Trencham harbours the gravest suspicion. If the monstrous
calves, encased in pink stockings, of the flunkey who
advocates the claims of this Polish are any indication of its
physical effect, Trencham means to have none of it. The
tendency to obesity, on which I have already touched, has
not yet invaded his lower limbs, and he wishes still to retain
a grip upon his trusty cob.
Trencham tells me that, when weighing the attractions
of any article, he is easily influenced by the character of the
people who employ it. Thus he would like to treat his
rheumatism with salts, but he shrinks from being classed
with the person behind the towel in the Anti-rheumatic
poster. His appearance is so abhorrent to Trencham that
he would choose to suffer the worst agony rather than be
associated with such a type in the adoption of any remedy
however infallible.
It is the same with the swarthy gentleman who keeps
on losing and recovering his Fountain Pen. Trencham
cannot make up his mind whether he finds the fellow's
expression more detestable in the hour of despondency or
at the moment of ecstatic relief.
On the other hand, he was attracted by the face of a lady
who is shown reading a weekly edition of a great London
daily newspaper. On closer inspection, however, he found
that she was not actually perusing it, but allowing her eyes
to wander over the top of its pages and out of the picture.
He therefore got little assistance from her as to the
character of the readers of this periodical. A clearer line
was obtained from a really earnest student of the same
paper—a bald and bellicose warrior in scarlet, his shoulders
covered with chain-mail surmounted by two biscuits indi-
cative of his rank. He is seen smoking furiously a cigar
with its red band still in situ, and Trencham concluded that,
though an officer, he was no gentleman. My friend has
therefore resolved to stick to his Spectator. He says he
is convinced that no officer in uniform would ever read
The Spectator with a band on his cigar. O. S.
“The turf is excellent, and being composed of sand the rain does
not lie.”—Tatler.
It may not actually tell a falsehood, but if it calls itself rain
and is really composed of sand, we feel that it is not deal-
ing quite frankly with us.
“Following the collapse of the Campanile of St. Mark's, Venice . . .
the basilisk and other portions of the famous building are now seriously
threatened with destruction.”—Daily Mirror.
We do trust that nothing will happen to the Unicorn and
the Cockatrice.

called forth the wonder and interest of all who see it, is now attracting
the attention of the authorities.”—Daily Mail.
We felt sure they'd notice it sooner or later.

“HUMBLY SHEWING.”
IN the dear old days, when a good
and kind and beautiful lady said to me,
“Oh, there you are Are you busy 2
I just want you to do something for
me," I used to reply gladly, “Why, of
course I will !” And then I would
dash off to fetch her a sprig of edel-
weiss from the top of Mount Everest
(or whatever it was) and lay it at her
feet and say, “Fairest of your sex (and
much fairer than any of ours), I only
live to serve you. Ask me something
more difficult."
But now when, still good and kind
and beautiful, she says to me, “Oh,
there you are Are you busy 2 I just
why, now I turn very red and
cough, and, murmuring that I have
a train to catch, dash for the door.
I wish the dear old days were back
again.
The first time that I got badly
mixed up with the new movement was
about a month ago. I had just finished
an exhausting game of croquet, when a
good and kind and beautiful lady came
up to me and said:
“Oh ' " I said stiffly.
In a general way I didn't want to.
Some people have the knack of signing,
others haven't. About once a week I
sign a cheque for a pound, payable to
self or bearer, and that is really about
all the signing I do.
“What's it for?” I said, to gain time.
“It's to the KING, praying him to
bring about " I forget now what it
was, but I know I didn't agree with it.
May I be forgiven if what I did was
wrong. I could not refuse her invi-
tation without entering upon a long
and (on my side, anyhow) heated dis-
cussion as to the rights of the question,
and I hate discussing important things
with strangers. I could not escape,
for she was nearer the door. But she
was ignorant of my name, and I began
to feel that after ten minutes, when I
should have a train to catch, I might
never see her again. So I wrote,
“Albert Tompkins,” which isn't me, in a
bold round hand. I cannot believe that
the support of Mr. Tompkins will turn
the scale one way or the other, and I
am sure that he would have liked to
oblige so charming a lady.

“Oh, there you are,” she said. “You're
just the man I wanted. Will you sign
my petition ?”
“Help!" I groaned.
“What did you say?"
“The fact is I'm not very good at
signing petitions. I signed one just
now, and it seems to have affected my
wrist. I think it sprained it slightly.”
“For whom was that ?”
“For the KING. Nothing less.”
“I meant who asked you. Was it
Mrs. Williams ?”
I decided, for the sake of Albert
Tompkins, not to pursue the subject.
“It was really when I was playing
croquet with you that I hurt my
wrist,” I said. “I-I fell on it going
through that second hoop.”
“Then sign it with your left hand;
it doesn't matter about the writing.”
“Wouldn't that spoil the page
rather? And when the KING got down
to me wouldn't he think that a very
decrepit old centenarian who could
barely sign his name had no business
to be urging Compulsory Military
Service on others? I mean it would
seem rather an altruistic performance.”
“This isn't a petition for military
service, it's for-" I forget now, but
I know I didn't agree with it. “Do
sign; I've got two hundred and thirty-
seven names already."
I made one more attempt.

ment before I sign it. If I were to read
the preamble and all the two hundred
signatures now, I should never catch
my train. Some of the signatures, in
fact, I doubt if I could ever read at all.”
The entry of my hostess saved the
situation. I got up hastily, and rushed
at her.
“Good-bye,” I said, “I was just say-
ing that I must be off. Such a jolly
time !”
“Oh, must you go 2 So sorry.

and beautiful lady comes up and asks
for my signature then I take out my
own documents and smile at her.
“I will sign your petition for Uni-

“The first is in the cause of Uni-

wants all civilians to learn soldiering;
well, mine wants all soldiers to learn a

fair.”

POTTED PAPERS.

(New Style.)
IN THE House.
. . . With his keen sense of humour,
Sir Albert Blond could not resist
exploiting the comic aspect of the Bun-
galow tax. The House was sparsely
filled when he rose, but in two minutes
not a seat was untenanted. Beginning
piano in a delicate vein of raillery, Sir
Albert developed his theme with such
a prodigal wealth of ludicrous illustra-
tion that the House was soon convulsed
with merriment. Nor was the laughter
confined to the Ministerial benches;
Mr. BALFour rolled about in his seat,
and Colonel Lockwood actually fell on
to the floor in a spasm of hysterical
mirth and had to be carried out by Mr.
LYTTELTON and Mr. LoNG. But the
amusement of the Tories was but
short-lived. Suddenly changing his
note, Sir Albert Blond lashed the
Opposition for their unprincipled ac-
tion in invoking the support of CoRDEN
for what was essentially a Protective
policy. The Liberals cheered franti-
cally and the Tories listened in sullen
silence as he relentlessly drove home
his point. For luminous logic, scorn-
ful irony, exquisite elocution and sledge-
hammer force no speech heard in the
last fifty years has excelled this wonder-
ful effort. As an old Parliamentary
hand observed, it combined the noble
simplicity of BRIGHT with the trench-
ancy of CHAMBERLAIN and the wit of
BERNAL OSBoRNE.
IN THE SocIAL World.
Lady Blond gave a brilliantly suc-
cessful musical matinée at her beauti-
ful house in Belgrave Square on Friday
afternoon, the percentage of refusals
out of five hundred invitations being
only fractional. The beautiful apart-
ments were profusely decorated with
flowers from the famous gardens of
Golconda Grange, Sir Albert Blond's
historic place in Hampshire, and the
artistes were Madame Héloïse Petrar-
chini, the famous aerial soprano; Mr.
Hanusch Jokai, the Hungarian buffo,
and M. Menthol de Couac, who plays
the clarinet more like a bird than a
human being.
Lady Blond wore a superb dress of
mauve savarin ornamented with sap-
phire kibobs, a corsage bouquet of
priceless paprika, and a plastron of
black seed pearls tastefully arranged so
as to imitate a small sea of caviare.
Among the guests were Lord and
Lady Rumpelmayer, Wiscount Lisper,
the Bolivian Minister, Sir Benjamin
and Lady Truffel, the Duc and Duchesse
d'Ortolan, Madame Gloria Kümmel, the
Dowager Marchioness of Boodle and
the Hon. Ruby Bonanza.
NOTES OF THE DAY.
As usual The Morning Post is dis-
satisfied with our comments on the
Conference. We are sorry, in view of
the weight and prestige of our con-
temporary and the unique position
occupied by Mr. RICHARD JEBB as an
adviser of the Unionist leaders, to have
incurred its resentment; but after all,
facts are facts, and nothing can be
gained by refusing to face them. It
was once a commonplace of Unionist
speakers to point to the disintegrating
tendencies at work in the Liberal Party.
When we contemplate the dissensions
which have now honeycombed the
Opposition, we feel that Sir Albert
Blond was fully justified last night in
wittily reminding them of the old adage
about people who live in glass houses.
Nocturne.
Opal and amber veils
Drifting athwart the moon,
Gossamer jewels on argent sails,
Light the lagoon.
Hark! the Kingfisher flies,
Clad in his harlequin suit,
Cleaving the dim ambrosial skies—
An arrowy lute.
Mars by Venus pursued
Gleams with a hectic flush,
And over the universe seems to brood
A Cosmic hush !
The old convention which associated
dowdiness with philanthropy is happily
extinct. Nothing is more charming in
the present day than the way in which
our grandes dames contrive to enlist
high Art as the handmaid of charity.
Thus we note that at the matinée
organised by Princess Bobolinsky and
Lady Blond, for the Bathchairmen's
Orphan Asylum, to take place on
July 25th, there will be a repetition of
the Corot cotillon, which was so
successful at Lady Blond's last season.
A few £5 5s. tickets are still available.

THE ANALYST.
THE following passage recently ap-
peared in a review by HESTER BRAYNE
in The Literary Post:- . --
“Take the readers of a novelist, say Mr.
Arnold Bennett. From my observation, which
is fairly wide, they are ". nervous, with
a tendency to hysteria, essentially bourgeois in
taste, although consciously unconventional in
artistic, social, and religious matters; their
philosophic rationalism is but skin deep, re-
minding one of the blotches of free thought that
disfigure the novels of Mr. Eden Phillpotts
while endearing him to the members of the
Rationalist Press Association ; they possess the
artistic temperament, and are proud of that
dubious blessing."
: My ingenious friend Beechcroft, who
is always on the look-out for a new
diversion, was greatly taken with the
new HESTER BRAYNE division of
readers, and studied it until he had
made a science of it. I met him last
Sunday morning in Piccadilly.
“Come into the Park,” he said, “and
take a pew, and I'll tell you what the
people read.”
“How 2 " I asked; and he explained
! the art. “It's quite easy,” he said,
“after a little care; " and off we went.
He got to work at once. “Do you
see that thoughtful-looking woman,”
he said, “over there? The one with
the sage - green dress with scarlet
poppies on her breast, and a retriever.
She reads GALsworthy. They are all
like that, more or less. Serious, but
very human. Lovers of dogs. Friends of
Liberty. You can tell them a mile off."
I was surprised at his perspicacity.
“Go on,” I said. . .
“And this prematurely weary person
with the buttonhole of nightshade—of
course you spot him,” said Beechcroft.
“No,” I said. “I am no psychologist.”
“Why, HARDY's his hero, of course.
He reads HARDY's poems. It's written
all over him. But these are easy cases.
Now there's a more complex one coming
this way. That girl there, in the blue
dress. You see how impulsive she is
by her quick movements. Her blood
is good—notice her red lips. Her joy
of life is strong—notice her springy
step. Her defiance of trifling con-
vention is shown by her want of a left
glove, which also tells us, by revealing
her fingers, that she is engaged. Every-
thing points to one conclusion—she
reads HEwlFTT.”
I had said nothing while Beechcroft
was talking because I wanted to hear
the end. I was naturally interested in
what he was saying because the girl
happened to be my cousin and I knew
who her favourite authors were —
MARION CRAwFoRD and the WILLIAM-
sons. . But all I said was, “How
extraordinarily clever you are "
After, however, he had left me I
decided to test his divining powers a
little farther, so, taking my courage
in my hands, I went up to the weary
man with the nightshade in his but-
tonhole. “Excuse me,” I said very
nervously, “for doing what is apparently
a very rude thing, but would you mind
telling me if you are an admirer of
Mr. Thomas HARDy's poetry?”
“Poetry " he said. “Not much
I don't read poetry. JAcoBs is my
man.”
“The Vicar of St. Anne's and his wife were,
at a garden party, presented with a piano b
the members of the congregation of the Parish
Church, in celebration of their silver rose bowl
from the Sunday school teachers."—Manchester

The next thing to celebrate is the
piano. In fact, once get started, and
you can go on like this for ever.

MAKING UP A MIND.
WE were sitting in the smoking-room, and our friend,
the Member of Parliament for the Division, was holding
forth. Somebody had asked him whether he didn't find it
difficult to make up his mind how to vote on all the
important questions that came up in the House from time
to time. He laughed heartily. “Oh dear, no,” he said,
“not a bit—at least, not when it's a Party question, as it
is nine times out of ten. You see, the division bell rings
all over the House, and you troop up from the Terrace or
the Smoking-room or the Library, and when you get to
the door of the House you find the Whips there, and they
say “Aye" or “No " as the case may be; and you just
drop into the lobby they indicate. Then you pass along
and you're ticked off and counted, and that's all. It's the
simplest thing in the world. No, you needn't know what
you're voting about. Sometimes I try to find out, but as
a rule nobody can tell me. You've just got to trust the
Whips.
“Of course it's not so easy when it's a non-party
question, because they don't put on the regular Whips
either of the Government or of the Opposition, and so a
chap may often get into the wrong lobby. Then perhaps
he'll have to defend his vote afterwards in his constituency,
and he must mug up the arguments and find out why he
voted as he did. And even if he does happen to be present
during the debate he'll probably get so knocked about one
way and the other by the speeches that he won't know
whether he's standing on his head or his heels. That's
the worst of listening to speeches.
“For instance, last week we had the Second Reading of
the Widowed Charwomen's Protection Bill. There 's been
a frightful row about it, you know. The married Char-
women have formed a sort of Union and they won't let
the widows join. The widows won't stand this, because
they say it robs them of their living, so they've had this
Bill brought in to assert their rights and give 'em a free
run. How do I know all that? Well, if you'd had all
the letters I've had about it and heard all the speeches
you'd know something about it too. They've been fright-
fully keen about it in this constituency and I’ve been
regularly bombarded with letters and telegrams on both
sides. ‘The Wives' Charing League' made all their mem-
bers write to me to say that no Charwoman's husband
should ever work or vote for me again if I voted for the
Bill, and “The Widows' Amalgamated Charing Association’
threatened that if I didn't vote for it their male relations
meant to have my blood. It was a deuced awkward
situation, and I had serious thoughts of breaking a leg
and keeping out of it altogether. - - -
“However, I went to the debate with a perfectly open
mind. Members on both sides were at me as soon as I
got into the House, but I shook 'em all off—told 'em I
meant to listen to the arguments and vote according to my
conscience. That frightened 'em ; they don't like you
much when you talk about your conscience in the House.
Well, the proposer's speech did the trick for me. I hadn't
a doubt left at the end of it. No, you're wrong there.
He didn't persuade me to vote for his Bill—quite the
reverse. I never heard such silly reasons as he gave for it,
and I settled to vote against it. I wish I'd gone away
after that, but I stayed to hear the fellow who opposed it,
and he sent me bang the other way. By the time he'd
finished I was perfectly certain that if I didn't vote for the
blessed Bill I should never be able to hold up my head
again. - - -
“Then there came another chap who spoke against it,
and he really made me think that the Bill was a perfectly
monstrous and revolutionary proposal; and he was fol-
lowed by a supporter who proved quite conclusively that
justice and policy alike demanded the passage of the Bill.
So it went on the whole evening. Every time I made up"
my mind somebody came along and unmade it for me and
fixed me the other way. What did I do in the end ?, I'll
tell you. I took the frank and manly course of abstaining |
altogether from voting. And now the League and the
Association have both called upon me to explain my
absence from the division. That's what comes of bringing
up these non-party questions.”
MAGNI NOMINIS UMBRA.
DEAR MR. PUNch,--In the recent case of Smith v. A
Newspaper (recalling an earlier case of Jones v. A. News:
paper), in which damages for libel were obtained, Counsel
for the defence—Mr. F. E. SMITH, K.C.—cited Punch to
show that the generic names of Smith and Jones were
habitually taken in vain to illustrate types of various kinds;
and when his Lordship asked Counsel if he himself pro-
posed to bring an action he replied that he certainly would
do so if the present action succeeded. - - -
Without implying any reflection on the justice of the
verdicts in the above cases I foresee that, following the
lead of so eminent a Counsel as Mr. F. E. SMITH, many
owners of these historic names will spend their spare time
bringing libel actions of a speculative nature; and I protest
against the birth-accident which gave me a comparatively
unusual name, and thus prevents me from taking up so
engaging a career. I have indeed broken out into verse on
this tragic theme:–
A Jones can get damages, so can a Smith,
If the deeds of a Jones or a Smith be referred to:
Then Robinson he must be next reckoned with,
And Brown, if he's mentioned, will put in his word, too.
But I have no chance, Sir, though ransacking duly
All sheets for some hint that I'm bad and uncomely:
For me there's no verdict, for I am, Yours truly,

of language. Epithets for everything.
But we don't allow that, of course.
There's only one adjective for food, and
that's “nice,’ and no man gets our

the others. You may have noticed that

Sir, coming '-they have to practise
that for hours. And then the stock

of them are very quick and get the
whole vocabulary in a month or so
quite perfectly. Others take longer.

other big gatherings, “I’m just going

satisfactory, Sir," and such stimulating
phrases.

also a special class for pouring out
wine so as to spill a little. We are very
particular about that; and coffee too.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extract ED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 11.
— General cheer welcomed PRINCE
ARTHUR back to business after brief
illness. Also the SPEAKER again takes
the Chair after a wilful bicycle closured
his morning ride. SARK has interest-
ing story about the accident. It seems
that when the SPEAKER perceived immi-
nent danger of a fall he in peremptory
voice cried, “Order l order!” Usual
effect absolutely lacking. Over he
went, just as if he were an ordinary
Irish Member.
Approach to debate on Woman's
Suffrage Bill heralded by pleasing, as
it turned out, illusive incident. Two
messengers dressed like waiters entered
bearing in either hand what looked like
tea-trays. Ah! Here was evidence of
the thoughtfulness of woman, her
instinct of hospitality, her considera-
tion for unworthy man. Forthcoming
debate likely to be prolonged, not to
say tedious. A cup of tea, a slice of
brown bread and butter, peradventure
a buttered bun, would be exceptionally
welcome.
On closer inspection, what looked
like well-furnished tea-trays turned
out to be bundles of petitions.
SHACKLETON arose on front bench
below Gangway to move Second
Reading of Parliamentary Franchise
(Women) Bill, colloquially known as
“the Conciliation Bill,” because some
of its provisions offend habitual sup-
porters of the Cause, like LLoyd
GEORGE. Not proceeded far with his
speech when, as WILLIAM BLACK used
to say in now forgotten novels, lo! a
strange thing happened.
ANNAN BRYCE had given notice to
second motion for rejection of Bill,
an intention in due course fulfilled.
Entering the House while SHACKLE-
Ton was still wrestling with his exor-
dium, he was observed, first with
amazement, then with sickening sense
of horror, to be making his way
down the floor, passing between the
Member on his legs and the SPEAKER
in the Chair. With respect to other
breaches of order certain measure of
laxity is permitted. This is the un-
pardonable sin. When BRYCE's pur-
pose was discovered there went up from
both sides of crowded House a shout of
expostulation and execration, compara-
ble only with the roar heard in the
lion's den when the mid-day meal is
unduly delayed. BRyce pulled up just
in time. With ashen countenance and
shaking knees turned about and slunk
back.
Apart from just resentment of breach
“THE UNPARDONABLE SIN.”
Execration of Annan Bryce for laying Shackleton a stymie.
in order, the incident left behind un-
pleasant sense of suspicion. BRYoF's
opposition to the measure, his differ-
ence with the mover, were testified to
by notice on the paper. Of course, if
by any chance SHACKLEToN could be
put out of the way there would be
swift end of the controversy. It
was remembered that BRYCE had just
returned from the great continent be-
yond the Atlantic where bowie knives
are cheap and action free. “Mak
siccar” is a motto to this day proudly
borne on the crest of the descend-
ants of an amiable Scottish nobleman
(flourishing in the days when the Scots
had their own king) who, as history
recounts, took exceptional care that a
certain foeman of his sovereign should
not again be troublesome. ANNAN
BRYCE, himself a Scotsman, knows the
story.
It is in this connection, of course,
an idle reminiscence. Nevertheless
Members whisper to each other that
BRYCE has been too long a member
of the House inadvertently to outrage
its most cherished point of order.
Business done.—Second Reading of
Woman's Suffrage Bill moved.
Tuesday.-The meanness of man, his
constitutional shiftiness, brought into
strong light this evening. Well known
that if the fate of SHACKLEtoN's Bill
were decided by the ballot it would be
bundled off the premises by over-
whelming majority. Within the last
two years Members have had advan-
tage of close study of what is likely to
happen when lovely woman stoops to
the folly of playing at politics. The
HoME SECRETARY has had his face
slashed with a whip ; the PRIME
MINISTER’s windows have been smashed
in town and country; public meetings
have been broken up, and Parliamentary

proceedings interfered with by women
who either dash in from the doorway
or chain themselves to the grille of the
gallery.
These demonstrations of capacity
for control of . public affairs, while
strengthening opposition by old stagers,
have driven waverers into the hostile
camp. Nevertheless, for reasons partly
domestic, partly traceable to considera-
tion for constituents, 299 Members
voted for second reading, carrying the
stage by a majority of 109.
That, as little PETERKIN's interlo-
cutor more than once remarked, was a
famous victory. Exceeded the rush by
which Veto Resolutions were carried.
Next thing to do, in ordinary circum-
stances the automatic procedure under
new rules, was to send Bill to Grand
Committee, there to be discussed, pos-
sibly strengthened by amendment, and
come back, say a fortnight hence, to
be carried through remaining stages by
the impetus of this great force.
It was here that the frailities of
manhood, delicately alluded to, mani-
fested themselves. The alternative to
sending Bill to Grand Committee is
to refer it to Committee of the whole
House. By such arrangement it must
needs take its turn with other more
ressing and important measures.
All know that, in view of adjournment
within next three weeks, every
hour of ordinary sittings of
House is mortgaged. To refer
the Bill to Committee of whole
House was equivalent to chuck-
ing it out as far as present ses-
sion is concerned.
And that was what was done
by majority of 145. MAccHLA-
veLLI wasn't in it with sober-
minded, tall-hatted, church—or
chapel—going M.P.'s, who voted,
in some cases spoke, in favour
of the Bill and immediately after
threw in their lot, tongue in
cheek, with conspirators who
solemnly remitted it to an in-
accessible Committee. All very
well to asseverate their love;
but why did they kick it down-
stairs ? -

SUPPRESSIO VERI.
THE Theatre and Music-Hall Licens-
ing Committee of the L. C. C. sat last
Thursday and Friday to consider appli-
cations for leave to produce a number
of cinematograph performances repre-
senting scenes in the life of eminent
public men. The proceedings
were strictly private, but the
following condensed summary
of what took place has reached
us from a trustworthy source.
The first application related
to a realistic series of scenes
portraying the interviews be-
tween Mr.T. P. O'Connor, M.P.,
and various members of the
Cabinet when the idea of a Con-
ference was first mooted. In
these the Great Negotiator was
shown in a number of elegant
attitudes—patting the PREMIER
on the back, with his arm round
Mr. LULU HARcourt's neck,
singing “The Harp that once in
Tara's Halls” to the accom-
paniment of a Welsh harp played
by Mr. LLOYD GEORGE, and so
on. The series opened with
the entrance of Mr. T. P. O'Con-
Nor by the PREMIER's front hall
door, and closed with his exit
from the pantry window of
the CHANGELLOR of THE Ex-
CHEQUER's residence.
l Mr. T. HEALY, M.P., who
opposed the application on
behalf of the All-for-Ireland
League, argued that it was
entirely derogatory to the dig-
nity of a great Irish patriot-like
Mr. O'ConnoR to have him

exhibited to the cynical curiosity of a
Cockney mob as a “minowdhering,
minandhering and blandandhering pa-
laverer.” He felt sure, he added, that
the public exhibition of these scenes
would be extremely painful to Mr.
PATRick Ford and Mr. HARcourt.
The objection was maintained and
the application was withdrawn.
The proposed production of a Cine-
matograph and Gramophone Rccord of
a Recital by M. PAchMANN was next
discussed. -
In support of the application it was
argued that the performance would
tend to foster friendship with the
Russian nation, of which M. PACHMANN
was a distinguished representative.
Lord Robert CECIL, K.C., who ap-
peared for M. PADEREwski and Mr.
MARK HAMBourg, vigorously opposed
the application. He submitted that
the honourable status of the pianist
was likely to be seriously prejudiced if
the notion were allowed to prevail that
speeches, pantomimic action and danc-
ing formed an integral part of piano-
forte recitals.
The Committee unanimously rejected
the application.
“The Premier at Play” was the title
of the entertainment which next came
before the Committee. This proved to
be a bioscopophonic representation of
a foursome at golf, with Mr. Asquith
as one of the players. The application
was enthusiastically supported by the
Women's Social and Political Union
on the ground that one of the caddies
was a prominent Suffragette in disguise.
The Solicitor-GENERAL, who ap-
peared for the Anti-Objurgation Society,
opposed the application, maintaining
that it was contrary to the public
interest to give a public representation
of what was said as well as done in a
bunker from which the PREMIER took
seventeen strokes to extricate himself.
Ultimately a compromise was effected,
by which the bunker scene was cut out
and the PREMIER was never represented
in the act of hitting the ball.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR FISCAL COMMISSION IN
LONDON.
Mr. Punch, in his anxiety to create
a better feeling between England and
Germany, resolved to compensate the
Fatherland for the intrusion of English
Fiscal Commissioners, and instructed
typical German Free Traders and Pro-
tectionists to investigate London life.
In order that the inquirers should be
absolutely unprejudiced, Mr. Punch
chose persons who did not know a
word of English. The following is a
translation of their reports:–
I.—LoNDoN BY A GERMAN FREE-
TRADER. - -
On inquiring which was the most
typical London street, I was by num-
erous persons referred to Park Lane.
So I travelled thither by a motor-
bus—riding in the utmost luxury——
for ten pfennige. I was pleased
to observe how easily the work:
| men of Park Lane could travel
to and from their labours in
these comfortable vehicles. Park
Lane, where I expected to find
specimens of hungry toilers, is a
great street of fine houses look-
ing on a noble park, and com-
pares most favourably with our
blocks of workmen's dwellings
in Berlin. • -
Being anxious to secure.
accurate information, I made
inquiries from the constable on
duty in the neighbourhood.
Facts ascertained from a Govern-
ment official of conspicuous ex-
actness may certainly be relied
upon.
Average hours of labour of Park
II.-LoNDoN BY A GERMAN
PROTECTIONIST.
Perhaps the best known thorough-
fare in London, corresponding to our
Unter den Linden, is Petticoat Lane.
Therefore I resolved to take it as a
typical case. I was prepared for
misery, but the reality caused tears to
trickle down my cheeks. Let those
who disbelieve in the advantages of a
Protective Tariff look at these figures.
Percentage of out-of-works.-98 per
cent. Every man who accosted me
assured me that he was out of work.
Average hours worked when employed.
—18 per diem.
Average wage paid.—1s. 6d. per diem
(one mark fifty pfennige).
Food of populace.—All of whom I
made inquiry, declared that they had
not eaten for weeks, and besought
ANOTHER DASH For THE Pole.
ROOSEVELT AND THE RING.
By a strange coincidence (writes a
correspondent), on the very day on
which I read Mr. Roosevelt's state-
ment in the periodical which he helps
to edit, that he had himself appeared in
public boxing contests, and had a
number of prize-fighters among his
most valued friends, I chanced to meet
in a Fleet Street tea-shop one of his
old associates. He was a short, sturdily
built man, his iron-grey hair cropped
short, his nose flat, and he had one
scar over the right eye and another on
the clean-shaven lip. His little eyes
looked keenly at me as he drank out of
his saucer. By his check suit, red satin
necktie, and three diamond rings I knew
him to be just the kind of man one
would be proud to call a friend.
“Yus,” he said, “I’ve 'ad 'em on
with TEDDY, more than once
or twice.” . . . . . .
“He is known as a hard-
hitter; did you find him so?” I
asked; and I told the waitress
to bring the bruiser another
sponge-cake.
“See this — and this 2' he
said, significantly pointing to
his right eyebrow and his lip.
“Teddy-marks, they are. I've
'ad my bit of luck, with belts
and champi'nships, and what
not; but I never got the best of
'im ; ” and I thought his face
took on a sad expression as he
gazed far away towards the
plated urns. - - - -
“Was he then so good a
fighter?” I asked.
“Only mod'rit as a fighter.
Always in too much of an 'urry.
Lane residents.-Quarter of an
hour per day.
Average income of labourers. —
£100,000 (2,000,000 marks) per annum,
or £2,000 (40,000 marks) per week.
Food of labourers.-The constable
assured me from his personal know-
ledge of Park Laners' cooking that the
consumption of dog, horse, and goat
flesh is absolutely unknown.
Clothing of residents.-I was par-
ticularly impressed by the number of
white shirts worn. What is a luxury
in Berlin is a commonplace in London.
Employment.—Not a single resident
of this vast area has been registered as
unemployed at the local bureau.
General observations.—I was much
struck by the number of German resi-
dents. All had fled from the blight of
Protection at home to take refuge in
this blessed land of Free Trade. In
the second place I was impressed by
the overflowing wealth of the district.
What a city to plunder
charity. Surely black bread is better
than nothing. -
Clothing of populace.—I can declare
from ocular observation that no new
clothing is sold in London. Every-
thing is second-hand. As an instance
of the poverty of the community, I
saw a pair of trousers first offered by a
tradesman at 14s. 6d. and finally dis-
posed of for 10%d. -
General Observations.—The rapacity
of the starving populace is enormous.
During the hours that I spent in Petti-
coat Lane it was seldom that a hand
was out of my pockets. Happily I
had adopted the protective measure of
leaving my purse at the hotel.
I return to the Fatherland convinced
that nothing but the instant imposition
of food taxes can keep these starving
people from extinction. Certainly an
invasion is not worth while, until the
country has risen to prosperity again
under Protection.
No, not what I call a first-class
fighter.” -
“Then how did he manage ->
“Well, you see, 'e's a great 'un at
conversation, is TEDDY. . That's what
done me in every time—is conversa-
tion. 'E would talk; I never stood
up to 'im once but what e 'd either
be lecturin' me on physical genera-
tion or racing suicide, or else tellin'
me what 'igh old times he and 'is
mates used to 'ave out West. Very
interestin', very; but I'm only used to

the jaw work 'e used to put in. It
was w'en 'e was tellin' me of 'ow 'is
old friend Shootin' Ginger wrestled
with a blind ox that 'e give me this
one on the lip.”
“That was unfortunate,” I said, in
weak - sympathy. “And the other

that ?”
“He give me that,” he said, “just as

ENCOURAGING symptoms of the re-

day, July 14—let the date be duly
recorded—by The Daily Mirror, which
was taking a look round the streets of
London that afternoon. We read that
in Bond Street a well-turned-out, up-
to-date young Englishman was actually
seen talking to a lady with his hat in
his hand; that in the City a man who
was obviously rushing for a train
stopped to pick up an umbrella which

Other instances of a similar tendency
have been duly reported to Mr. Punch
within the last few days. At a public
meeting recently held at Queen's Hall
five Damsels-errant of the Purple Iris
variety, on uprising simultaneously and
shouting “Liar!” at a distinguished

speech, were most courteously helped
to sit down and generally soothed in
their hysterical condition by as many
Stewards of the meeting, who, we
noticed, were wearing white shirt-cuffs
and new shilling ties for the occasion.
On Monday afternoon a fourteen-
stone policeman, who had been trying
some jiujitsu experiments with a lady
in response to her appeal for male
collaboration, and found himself exe-
cuting a somersault in his eagerness to
please, remarked to the fair Britomart,
as he gathered up his helmet with an
old-world air, that he would always be
very glad (not 'arf, as he put it) to
break his neck in order to oblige a lady.
We look daily for further displays of
awakening gallantry due to the Shrink-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is no new thing to see the Spirit of Romance dragged
behind the chariot wheels of a Great Cause, but it still
gives me rather a shock when a really clever novelist does
it. There is quite enough of good plot and clear charac-
terisation—to say nothing of that kind of humour which
sometimes makes one laugh aloud, and (if one happens to
be in an omnibus) provokes the amazed compassion of
fellow-travellers—in A Splended Heritage (STANLEY PAUL),
by Mrs. STEPHEN BATson, to carry through the story with-
out any imported didactic interest; so when I came to pages
of Socialistic propaganda, all of which I had read many
times before, introduced under the thin screen of an argu-
ment between the hero and his friend (a clergyman and a
Tory), I felt rather as the cricketing reporters seem to do
when the stone-waller comes in.
sister trips off to meet the dramatist at Charing Cross
Station—which is to the beginning of the elopement of
fiction what big-game shooting is to the end of all unhappy
love-affairs. Luckily, however, for all parties, the dramatist
changes his mind and his plot at the last moment, and
fails to turn up at the booking-office. Otherwise he would
have been taking two tickets for the Continent just at the
moment when his Suffragist wife is done to death in a
street riot, the first martyr to the Cause. I expect the
book will be popular with those who like to know, you
know, all about the people who write in and are written
about in the newspapers. But personally I don't think
it's in the same street with The Street of Adventure.
I never seem to get over an old-fashioned prejudice in
favour of incident in a novel. Possibly the novelists of to:
day who are big enough to hold me without incident are not
enough to go round. At any rate I want rather more than
one brush with a frontier tribe
Mr. Richard Ferrier was the
adopted heir to a soap manu-
facturer's millions, and had large
schemes of social reform, but,
except for the dialogue referred
to, he gets no further with these
in the narrative, which is occu-
pied with his courtship (as a
poor man) of the widow, Marie
Sherwood, a figure not quite so
interesting, I think, as she was
meant to be. But incidentally
there is a delightful and very
good-humoured satire on the
society of a country village (you
must on no account miss Tom
Waller and Mrs. Tarberton) and
its whole-hearted devotion to
the chase of bird, beast and ball.
The author makes an excep-
tion, however, in favour of the
pastime of gardening, which is
contrasted with other games,
and notably golf, to the great
disadvantage of the latter. Pro-
bably the true Socialist feels,
as I have myself sometimes felt
after an off-day on the links, that
there is less waste of productive

In point of art, Intellectual Mansions, S.W. (CHAPMAN AND

enter two new-comers, an earnest country doctor and his
pretty, purposeless sister. Intoxicated by the atmosphere
of home-brewed coffee and shoppy slang, in which the
Intellectuals really shine, they are whirled into a sort of
square dance with a real live Court Theatre playwright
and his misunderstood wife, and quickly set to partners, or
rather to corners, earnest doctor to misunderstood wife,
and neurotic dramatist to pretty sister. The dance waxes
furiouser and furiouser, till at last the misunderstood wife
joins the ranks of the militant Suffragists and the pretty

sufficient blood for a book in which every man who counts
is a soldier.
The first part of Mr. Doug LAs SLADEN's Queer Things
about Egypt (HURST AND BLACKETT) is devoted — too
devoted, in my opinion—to “Anecdotes illustrating the
Egyptian character.” Many of these yarns are supplied
by Mrs. CROMwFLL RHoDEs, who is called Agenoria in the
book, and as this fancy name appears no fewer than twenty-
four times in one short chapter, I may perhaps be forgiven
for getting a little tired of it. The kindest thing I can find
to say of the stories is that there are plenty to choose
from. Whatever defects Mr. SLADEN may have as a writer
parsimony is not one of them. The second part—“On the
Nile, From Alexandria to Assuan "-is more to my taste,
though Mr. SLADEN does not make me palpitatingly eager
to visit the places which he describes. There is, however,
a delightful chapter called, “Abūkir and the Battle of the
Nile.” As a photographer Mr. SLADEN is again prolific,
and the quality of his illustrations is excellent.

a little. We were discussing the powers of the House of
Lords, I think—(refers to a paper)—yes, that was it. Of
course, it may be argued that the House of Commons,
ought to have a certain amount of legislative power left,

What I meant was that in financial matters it might

advisable to give the House of Commons the power to
initiate some legislation. -

able, but I'm not very sure that it would work well in
practice. - -
Mr. Lloyd George. Personally I see no great harm in
admitting that ; but, of course, the power must be rigidly
defined and limited, and in no case ought it to extend to
the Budget of the year. That's a point I feel bound to
insist on.
Mr. Birrell. Hear, hear !
Mr. Balfour (wearily). Really I don't know that there is
much use in prolonging these negotiations. We seem to
be drifting further and further away from one another. I
am almost tired of pointing out that it is perfectly useless
to expect a democratic body like the House of Commons
to submit to the inferiority involved in the PRIME MINISTER's
suggestions. I am a House of Commons man, and I object
to the exaltation of a Chamber which is based not merely
on a non-elective, but—and this is much worse—on a
hereditary principle. I hope I make myself plain.
Mr. Asquith. What do you say to that, LANsdowns?
Lord Lansdowne. I agree entirely. Indeed, I would go
even further. The House of Lords did what it could in
regard to last year's Finance Bill. We took a considerable
amount of time over it and had a most interesting debate,
but it was all useless. We can never hope to get such
favourable ground again, and for my part 1 am in favour
of bringing the whole thing to an end.
Mr. Lloyd George. Come, come, you can't expect us to
agree to the total abolition of the double-Chamber system
under which this country has become great and prosperous.
Independently of the terrible danger of rash, hasty and
impetuous legislation
Mr. Austen Chamberlain (breaking in). There you go
again, my dear GEORGE. I really thought we had knocked
that silly bogey on the head long ago. What we want is
the free play of a representative system. This constant
clamour for checks and balances shows, if I may say so,
that you are unwilling to trust the people. Why should
the people be baulked in their wishes by a parcel of irre-
sponsible gentlemen who vote merely for the protection of
their own pockets without a thought for the general welfare
of the nation 2

THE ORDEAL BY FIRE.
OUR Flame-flower, the Family Flame-
flower, is now plainly established in
the North-east corner of the pergola,
and flourishes exceedingly. There, or
| thereabouts, it will remain through
the generations to come—a cascade
of glory to the eye, a fountain of pride
to the soul. “Our fathers' fathers,”
the unborn will say of us, “performed
this thing; they toiled and suffered
that we might front the world with
confidence—a family secure in the
knowledge that it has been tried by
fire and not found wanting.” . .
The Atherleys' flame-flower,
glad to inform you, is dead.
-- º: :: +
We started the work five years ago.
I was young and ignorant then—I did
not understand. One day they led me
to an old apple-tree and showed me,
fenced in at its foot, two twigs and a
hint of leaf. “The flame-flower l’’
they said, with awe in their voices. I
was very young; I said that I didn't think
much of it. It was from that moment
that my education began . . .
Everyboly who came to see us had
to be shown the flame-flower. Visitors
were conducted to the apple-tree in
solemn procession, and presented.
They peered over the fence and said,
“A-ah!” just as if they knew all
about it. Perhaps some of them did.
Perhaps some of them had tried to
grow it in their own gardens.
As November came on and the air
grew cold, the question whether the
fame-flower should winter abroad be-
came insistent. After much thought it
was moved to the shrubbery on the
southern side of the house, where it
leant against a laburnum until April.
With the Spring it returned home,
seemingly stronger for the change; but
the thought of Winter was too much
for it, and in October it was ordered
south again.
For the next three years it was con-
stantly trying different climates and
testing various diets. Though it was
touch and go with it all this time our
faith was strong, our courage unshaken.
June, 1908, found it in the gravel-pit.
It seemed our only hope. . . .
And in the August of that year I
went and stayed with the Atherleys.
º: º: -- 2:
One morning at breakfast I chal-
lenged Miss Atherley to an immediate
game of tennis.
“Not directly after,” said Mrs.
Atherley, “it’s so bad for you. Besides,
we must just plant our flame-flower
first.”
I dropped my knife and fork and
gazed at her open-mouthed.
I am
“Plant your—what 2 " I managed
to say at last.
“Flame-flower. Do you know it?
John brought one down last night—it
looks so pretty growing up anything.”
“It won't take a moment,” said Miss
Atherley, “and then I'll beat you.”
“But—but you mustn't—you-you
mustn't talk like that about it,” I
stammered. “Th-that's not the way
to talk about a flame-flower.”
“Why, what's wrong?”
“You’re just going to plant it!
Before you play tennis It isn't a-a
buttercup ! You can't do it like that.”
“Oh, but do give us any hints—we
shall be only too grateful.”
“Hints' Just going to plant it !” I
repeated, getting more and more indig-
nant. “I—I suppose Sir CHRISTOPHER
WREN s-said to his wife at breakfast
one morning, ‘I’ve just got to d-design
St. Paul's Cathedral, dear, and then I'll
come and play tennis with you. If you
can give me any hints * * >
“Is it really so difficult 2" asked
Mrs. Atherley. “We’ve seen lots of
it in Scotland.”
“In Scotland, yes. Not in the South
of England.” I paused, and then
added, “WE have one.”
“What soil is yours? Do you plant
it very deep? Do they like a lot of
water 2 " These and other technical
points were put to me at once.
“Those are mere details of horti-
culture,” I said. “What I am pro-
testing against is the whole spirit in
which you approach the business—the
light-hearted way in which you assume
that you can support a flame-flower.
You have to be a very superior family
indeed to have a flame-flower growing
in your garden.”
They laughed. They thought I
joking.
“Well, we're going to plant it now,
anyhow,” said Miss Atherley. “Come
along and help us.”
We went out, six of us, Mrs. Atherley
carrying the precious thing; and we
gathered round an old tree trunk in
front of the house.
“It would look rather pretty here,”
said Mrs. Atherley. “Don't you think?”
I gave a great groan.
“You — you — you're all wrong
again,” I said in despair. “You don't
put a flame-flower in a place where
you think it will look pretty; you try
in all humility to find a favoured spot
where it will be pleased to grow.
There may be such a spot in your
garden or there may not. Until I
know you better I cannot say. But it
is extremely unlikely to be here, right
in front of the window.”
They laughed again, and began to

at the last moment some qualms of
doubt seized even them. They spoke
to me almost humbly.
“How would you plant it 7” they
asked.
It was my last chance of making
them realise their responsibility.
“I cannot say at this moment,” I
began, “exactly how the ceremony
should be performed, but I should
endeavour to think of something in
keeping with the solemnity of the
occasion. It may be that Mrs. Atherley
and I would take the flower and march
in procession round the fountain,
singing a suitable chant, while Bob
and Archie with shaven heads pros-
trated themselves before the sundial.
Miss Atherley might possibly dance the
Fire-dance upon the East lawn, while
Mr. Atherley stood upon one foot in
the middle of the herbaceous border
and played upon her with the gurden
hose. These or other symbolic rites
we should perform, before we planted
it in a place chosen by Chance.
Then leaving a saucer of new milk
for it lest it should thirst in the night
we would go away, and spend the rest
of the week in meditation.”
I paused for breath.
“That might do it,” I added, “ or it
might not. But at least that is the
sort of spirit that you want to show.”
Once more they laughed . . . . and
then they planted it.

These have been two difficult years
for me. There have been times when
I have almost lost faith, and not even
the glories of our own flame-flower
could cheer me. But at last the
news came. I was at home for the
week end and, after rather a tiring day
showing visitors the north-east end of
the pergola, I went indoors for a rest.
On the table there was a letter for me.
It was from Mrs. Atherley.
“By the way,” she wrote, “the flame-
flower is dead.”
“By the way”
But even if they had taken the
business seriously, even if they had
understood fully what a great thing it
was they were attempting—even then
I think they would have failed.
For, though I like the Atherleys very.

extremely jolly . . . yet—I doubt, you

THE CRICKET CHAMPIONSHIP.
My remarks upon the anomalies of
the new method of scoring in the
County Cricket Championship , have
called forth—as I rather expected they
would—several millions of letters from
all parts of the British Empire. It
will be understood that it is not pos-
sible for me to reproduce all these in
full, interesting though they are. They
evince a very wide-spread discontent
on the part of the public, and many of
them contain pithy suggestions for the
improvement of the present system.
It will be remembered that the position
of the leading four counties at the time
of the opening discussion was as
follows:—
- Per-
Pld. Won. Lost. Drm. Pts. cmtge.
Kent.......... . 15 11 1 3 11 73-33
Middlesex.... 12 6 2 4 6 50-00
Sussex........ 14 7 4 3 7 50-00
Hampshire... 15 7 6 2 7 46.66
“VILLAGE GREEN '' writes “What
are the little dots for? And how is it
that Sussex has only scored 5,000
runs in fourteen matches, while Kent
has scored 7,333 runs in fifteen 2
Seems to be something wrong.” I have
replied personally to Mr. Green, point-
ing out his error in mistaking the per-
centage table for the tally of runs, but
after all there is much in what he says.
“PEACE AT ANY PRICE '' expresses
great satisfaction that defeats are no
longer penalized. “This is the first
step,” he writes, “towards eliminating
the hateful spirit of rivalry from our
playing grounds. It is the earnest
wish of many humble citizens that the
M.C.C. may see their way to complete
the revolution by ignoring victories
also and allowing two points for a
draw and three for a game abandoned
through rain.”
On the other hand a somewhat con-
trary view is expressed by “PAvilion
STEPs,” who writes: “What we want
is sporting finishes; I should suggest
returning the gate-money in the event
of the match being unfinished, and
allowing ten points to both sides for a
tie.”
“FAIR PLAY' seems to have mis-
understood the point at issue. “If the
present hot weather continues,” he
writes, “I should be inclined to allow
two pints to every man on the winning
side, and three each to the Umpires.”
“MATHEMATICUs '' thinks that the
time has gone by when a satisfactory
result can be attained in mere figures.
He encloses a system of computation
by algebra, which I regret to say I am
not in a position to appreciate. But
as Derbyshire, in his table, ties with
Essex for the leading position, and
Lancashire is disqualified because the
number of matches they have drawn
cannot be deducted from those lost, I
can hardly believe it to be equitable.
I now put forward my own scheme
for the kindly criticism of the British
Public. I shall be happy to deal with
comments next week, and I may point
out that, by the courtesy of the Post
Office officials, a new pillar-box has
been erected in the Strand to prevent
dislocation of the ordinary mail service.
I hope my readers will avail themselves
of it.
In the first place I should take the
percentage of matches in which the
game is abandoned through rain after
the winning side has lost the toss. I
should divide these by the proportion
of those which have resulted in a draw
without the intervention of rain, but
only in the case of both sides having
declared their innings closed after the
fall of the tenth wicket. We must
have sporting finishes. I would then
add the number of points thus obtained
to the average of the batting averages
of the losing side. We must have all-
round men. At this point I borrow a
hint from “MATHEMATICUs" and call
our result so far c.
We now come to the consideration
of finished matches, and I may say at
once that I would ignore all finished
matches that do not result in a victory
or a tie. We must consider the
spectators. For matches won after
losing the toss against a county stand-
ing higher in the table of the previous
week than the winning county—you
take me?—I would allow four points,
less the number of inches of rain that
fall during the match. All other vic-
tories would count as defeats, except
ties. In the event of a tie I would
simply take the percentage of the pro-
portion of wickets, and double the
talent money. We must encourage
our professionals. Defeats after win-
ning the toss would be penalised in the
same proportion. We have now merely
to multiply the last result by w, and
we shall have the final position.
Let us see how it would work out, as
applied to the position given above.
As I anticipated, Kent would still be
top with the following record:—
Allot - Pro- Per- Divi-
ment. portion. centage. dend. Total.
Kent...23:17 –9, 1833 1:12345 14-c.
The Yorkshire Evening Post quotes
an old joke from The Windsor Magazine
thus:—
“Officer (to men who have been grumbling):
There is nothing whatever the matter with this
soap ; I’ve tasted it.
Private: That's just it, sir; but the cook
wants to call it collee.” -
Which makes it really quite funny again.
TRAINING THE MIND.
It is stated in The Times that Sir E
ARTHUR QUILLER Couch, Mr. MAX
PEMBERTON, and Mr. ARTHUR CROxTon
have been appointed adjudicators of
a novel competition devised by the
General Manager of the Great Western
Railway. The competition takes the
form of three sets of twelve questions
dealing with the country served by this
line.
By the exercise of that intelligent
anticipation for which he has long been
famous, Mr. Punch is in the happy
position of being able to lay before his .
readers a representative selection from
the lists of questions on which Sir
ARTHUR QUILLER Couch, Mr. MAx
PEMBERTON and Mr. ARTHUR CRoxton
have been called in to adjudicate.
1. Of whom was it said that “He’s
past ’ealing and on the road to 'an-
well ?” -
2. Is it true that WAGNER composed
his famous opera, Der Fliegende Hol-
länder, on the G. W. R. 2 If not, why
not 2 -
3. What high law officer sits for
Reading, and what Cabinet Minister ||
nearly lost him his seat 2
4. Differentiate between (a) bogie-
engine, (b) bogy-man, (c) Colonel Bogey.
5. Estimate the comparative soporific
effect of the novels of Sir ARTHUR
QUILLER Couch and Mr. MAx PEM-
BERTON as a means of inducing sleep
in the train, and compare the styles of,
“Q” and LE QUEUx. -
6. Give a complete list of the ingre-
dients employed in the baking of (a) a
Bath bun, (b) a Banbury cake, (c) a
Bath Oliver biscuit. Indicate the pro-
bable results of feeding three normally
constituted individuals for seven weeks.
on nothing but one or other of these
comestibles.
7. State why in your opinion corridor ||
soap is by far the best detergent to
employ for the scouring of the White
Horse. |
8. Write a brief history of the rise
and decline of the foot-warmer. Say
who invented the tea-basket, and what
is his present income? - :
9. Translate into ordinary English
the following:
Eeeenee Poime-e-e-r.
Account for the extraordinary pro-
nunciation of bookstall boys and rail-
way porters.
10. Distinguish between the musical
rhythm of the G. W. R. and the L. &
N. W. R., and explain why the Midland
always runs in triplets.
11. State by what route Mr. BRAM
StokFR tº. to Birmingham when
he interviews Sir OLIVER Lodge, and
explain the connection between the

12. Briefly elucidate the following:—
(a) “Playing billy with the labels,”
(b) “In the presence of the passen-
jare,”
(c) “Bad for the coo,”
(d) “Pretty Little Polly Perkins of
Paddington Green.”
13. What is the best way of dealing
with (a) a passenger who whistles in
the train, (b) a passenger who uses un-
parliamentary language in a Parlia-
mentary train, (c) a passenger who has
never heard of Mr. MAx PEMBERTON ?
14. “Oh, ever since the world began,
There never was and never can
Be such a very useful man
As the railway porter.”
Who wrote the above touching lyric 2
Explain why Sir ARTHUR QUILLER
Couch declined to include it in his
famous anthology of English verse.
15. Which is the more euphonious
title, Sir MAx PEMBERTON or Sir
ARTHUR CRoxton 2
16. What deductions are to be drawn
as to the quality of hotels from the fol-
lowing notices: (a) Hotel 'bus meets
trains, (b) boots meets trains, (c) hotel
porter meets trains, (d) hotel cabs meet
trains on request (free)?
17. When an Oxford undergraduate
says that he is going to Didder, Padder,
or Redder, what does he mean 2
18. Give the population, the leading
hotels, and the chief objects of local
interest of Little Kimble, Coalpit Heath,
Luxulyan and Preesgweene, and state
what is the par score of the Par golf
links.
19. Distinguish between (a) a luxu-
rious and (b) a luxuriant hotel. Is it
wise to patronise a hotel which adver-
tises a “smoke room '' instead of a
“smoking room"?
THE INSUFFERABLE.
BY all the floods that won't abate,

And steely ramrods struck the ground,
And said—but no, it shan’t transpire—
We'll say I simply said “Confound !
This weather would provoke an angel's
ire.”
And Jones—he smiled, the hound !

And, though he held a largish gamp,
It would not overstate the case -

And still he bore that smileupon his face,
The “footlight beauty” stamp.
I strove to speak him soft and bland,
As one whose mental state's amiss;
But naught could make him understand.
Immersed in ecstasies of bliss,
“By Jove,” he mused, “the water must
be grand;
I hope it keeps like this.”
It seemed by some infernal luck
The brute had fixed on late July
To give his task in town the chuck
And flog a mountain-pool with fly;
But Nemesis, ye gods !

With thunderbolts and die!

Where Jones expects to lure the trout,
Attend a poet's prayers, I crave;

And heave him down, like Hylas, to

Just now are bent on mastering secrets
of the Mother of Parliaments who
overlooks and guides the destinies
of considerable portion of the
globe. Accordingly here they are,
observant, alert, and (to begin with)
interested.
In anticipation of debate on
Territorial Forces, opened by that
warrior bold, Lord PortsMoUTH,
House rather fuller than usual.
But army must stand aside while
Diseases of Animals (No. 2) Bill
goes through Committee. This the
measure noted a fortnight ago in
hands of SAYE AND SELE. Nomi-
nally still in his charge. But
CARRINGTON and DERBY on Front
Benches on either side of the
Table have, after the manner of
Melancholy, marked it for their
own. Whilst reputed parent sits
silent on back bench, the Earls in
swift succession swoop down and
peck at his hapless progeny.
Lord Chairman of Committees,
BALFour of BURLEIGH, takes the
Chair, vice ONSLow, gone a-bathing
in Continental resorts. Supreme
achievement for LoRD CHAIRMAN,
highest mark of heaven-born capa-
city for the post, is to rattle through
amendments in briefest space of
time. In the Commons amend-
ments are sometimes debated.
Necessary, therefore, that they
should be submitted in articulate
form. In the Lords such prejudice l
is in most cases unknown. As an
aeroplane attempts to circle mea-
sured course in minimum of time, so
an ordinary Bill in charge of private
Member is rushed through Committee
in fewest moments possible. ONSLow
had long innings. BALFour of BUR-
LEIGH admits he did pretty well. Now
they should hear and see something.
What the Japs in the Gallery, audibly
indrawing their breath in excitement of
moment, saw and heard was after this
Inanner :
DERBY rises from front Opposition
bench and makes inaudible remark.
LoRD CHAIRMAN, as if touched by secret
spring, rises and utters the following
incantation. “Clause-1-Page-1-line-5-
after-accept-insert-as-in-this-Act-pro-
that-the-words-proposed-to-be-left-out-
stand-part-of-the-question-those-that-
“That warrior bold, Lord Portsmouth.”
are-of-that -opinion-say-content-the-
contrary-not-content-I-think-the-not-
contents-have-it.”
At this formula there is, by excep-
tion, some slight stir among noble
Lords. Fancy they catch in shibboleth
of Lord CHAIRMAN something that
sounds like “insert port.” That way
of putting it is certainly unusual. It
may be hospitably meant, but is a little
abrupt. Besides, it's rather early in
the afternoon for that sort of thing.
Moreover than which there are neither
decanters nor glasses on the table.
Evidently a misapprehension.
None about new clause inserted at
instance of CARRINGTON providing that
“In this Act the expression horse in-
cludes ass and mule.” That finished
Lord DERBY. Hitherto, with the author
of the Bill in the background SAYE-ing
nothing, ready to SELE anything, he
had run neck and neck with belted
earl opposite. But, you know, when
it comes to affirming in Act of Parlia-
ment that a horse is an ass, and eke a
mule, the limit is passed.
So DERBY gives in ; Bill through
Committee, and the five Japanese feel
their way out into the open air in
hopelessly dazed condition.
Business done. — Diseases of
Animals (No. 2) Bill through Com- |
mittee.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—
House up at three o'clock this
morning. Even then enthusiasts
in public service thought it unduly
early. Might as well sit another
hour or so. Pushed patriotic ob-
jection to point of division.
This sadly mismanaged. Rare
opportunity of illustrating fitness
of things ignored. In division list
circulated to-day names given of
49 voting in favour of ELIBANK's
motion for adjournment. Beneath
is set forth in tabular form the
solitary “No”—J. A. JAckson. It
is added “Tellers for the No Mr.
REM NANT and Viscount DAL-
RYMPLE.”
Of course JACKSON should have
been one of the Tellers, and REM-
NANT sole representative of Oppo-
sition. However, came to same
thing in end. There being only one
remnant found in “No” Lobby
SPEAKER declares “the Ayes” had
it and so home to bed.
Business done.—Supply closured.
Thursday.—Revolt of Scottish
Members. They demand head of
SECRETARY OF STATE, whether on
charger or not immaterial so
that they get it. DEwAR opened
attack alleging that condition of
affairs consequent on adminis-
tration of Scotch Office has
brought about what might have been
regarded as arithmetically impossible.
In South Uist parish rates amount to
23s. 4d. in the 20s. 0d." What hurt
Scotch Members even more than this
parochial puzzle was the fact that they
could not get at the SECRETARY OF
STATE in flesh and blood. Being a
Peer he is seated in what we call
“another place.”

of the pibroch in his voice as he
cried aloud, “What I want to know
is where is the SECRETARY FOR

inexorable CHAIRMAN. “That has no-
thing to do with this vote.”
“Cannot we,” pleaded ALPHEUs in
voice that would have moved the
sympathies of any but CHAIRMAN of
WAYS AND MEANs—“cannot we ask
somebody why the SECRETARY FOR
Scotland is not in the House of Com-
mons 2 " .
A practical-minded Scot suggested
that it was because he was in the
House of Lords; ALPHEUS CLEoPHAs
sat down to ponder over the matter
put in that way.
This made opening for TULLIBARDINE,
late of the Black Watch, one of the
forlorn hope of Scotch Unionists in
present House. Nuts for him to find
Radical pack of brither Scots in full
cry after a Secretary of State. Pound-
ing away on the same track TULLIBAR-
DINE paused a moment to remark, “The
mental photograph the people of Scot-
land will retain of the SECRETARY of
Scotland will be in close juxtaposition
to the nine of diamonds.”
This observation threw a gloom over
the company. Evidently
meant something. Pos-
sibly, even probably, it was
a joke. Anyhow, had effect
of paralysing the proceed-
ings, Committee gratefully

THE instances appearing in The
Times and The Westminster Gazette of
living people who form interesting
“links with the past" (writes a corres-

any reason not to doubt) can be added
to from my own experience. For I am
myself a link, and do not care to be
missing from this symposium.
I am a Welshman (with profound
apologies). A few days ago I stood on
the famous golf links at Aberllanstyd-
fairfechan. I was in the land of my
fathers, and on this very spot stood
one of the most illustrious of the Ap
Jenkinses in A.D. 842.
I held a club in my hand. So did
my dear old ancestor, the great Ap
Jenkins, in A.D. 842.
I swung the club above my shoulder;
and though this, be it remembered,
happened in the year A.D. 1910, a very
similar action on the part of old
Ap might have been observed by you

place in A.D. 842.

* man—a fair-haired, blue-
eyed Saxon, who was going
round in front of me. My
famous ancestor did much
the same thing with his
club, in A.D. 842. The
question of accident and
design does not affect the
remarkable coincidence.
The Saxon seized a
small lump of flint and
hurled it at me; just as
in the brave old days to
which I have already re-
ferred the Saxon threw a
small lump of flint at my
respected forefather.
And it would be a very
difficult thing to prove that
it was not the same piece of
flint that was used on both
occasions.
But here the parallel is
broken, for the Saxon of
old missed my forbear in
A.D. 842.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. FRANK T. BULLEN's latest book, Told in the Dog
Watches (SMITH, ELDER), is a miscellaneous collection of
essays and yarns, of which some idea can be gathered from
a few of the titles: “The Bengal Pilot Service,” “On
Robinson Crusoe,” “The Making of a Merchant Service
Officer,” “My Cats,” “The Last Haunt of Shanghaiing,”
“The Tightest Place I ever was in,” “On Unknown Seas.”
The subjects which these suggest will, I am sure, be
sufficiently alluring to readers who know Mr. BULLEN's
touch. To those who do not one may say that he has in
an exceptional degree that gift of spinning yarns which is
supposed to be the possession of all sailormen, but so
seldom stands, as his can, the test of pen and ink. The
essays in this volume are all, of course, the fruit of actual
experience, and I take it that the yarns are too. Certainly
they are almost too strange, some of them—and notably “The
Pentathlon Affair”—to
Messrs. Constable put The Duke's Price at six shillings.
Sir W. S. GILBERT once assessed the commodity at two a
penny, but Stephana Brennan, because prices are higher in
America and millionaires' daughters cannot reckon in half-
pence, was prepared to pay a few million dollars. By
this outlay and a ceremony or two she expected to buy
outright the body and soul of M. le duc de Longtour. If
this was bad finance, the duke was equally wrong in sup-
posing that in exchange for his title he was going to get
the heart as well as the hand of the beautiful lady in the
big hat, whose picture appears on the cover. Fortunately
there are always the authors, who will see that their
puppets don't get married unless it is good for them.
DEMETRA and KENNETH BRowN do not leave their com-
mercial couple at the church door to adjust accounts for
themselves. They arrange an engaging programme of
problematic events and introduce them to a lot of very
bright and unscrupulous worldlings, who do their best to
procure a separation, but only achieve a closer and less
sordid union. There is also in this book a good deal of
valuables information
make plausible fiction.
Others of them appear
to be pure invention—
and that of the best—
until one is pulled up
by some little paren-
thetic suggestion that
the author is writing
of people he has met.

prefer made-up stories
to true ones, because

volume are just those slight and intimate experiences, absurd
or tender, which it needs some moment of unusual confi-
dence to draw from their subject. I almost feel, indeed,
after hearing them, as though Miss MAYNE had unkindly
betrayed for my benefit eleven most interesting secrets.
Not but that “unkindly" is the last adjective to be applied
with propriety to her style of doing so. On the contrary,
the delicate sympathy of the book is its greatest charm;
it is all told in an undertone, a gentle whisper, between
smiles and pauses. I shall not tell you what the Things
are, because that you will enjoy ever so much more from
Miss MAYNE herself. Most of them are concerned, natu-
rally, with the emotions—a romance that came to nothing,
a personal problem that was never wholly solved, and the
like—the little secret memories of every life; and one is
a short ghost-tale that for quiet horror is worthy of any
of the acknowledged masters in this kind. Taken to-
gether, these Things That No One Tells form a collec-
tion of such unusual quality as to make me very glad
that Miss MAYNE has given the lie to her own label, and
told them.
very much alive, if
to no particular, purpose, in the troublous years round
1756. It will be some time before I forget Colonel
Yelverton, quixotic widower and stout Tory; his pretty
daughter Catherine, born to be loved by a better than
Francis the Quaker, who bound her by a secret engage-
ment but had not the pluck to go through with the
risks and responsibilities of marriage; Charlotte, adopted
daughter of the Colonel and suspect of the local scandal-
mongers; and Bassy Dunbar, sound, if mistaken, hero.
It will not be long, however, before I forget what became
of them all, and I shall never be quite clear whether
they occurred in my own life, or in history, or in the
novel that MARY HALLock Foote wrote. By that you
must judge the book. It is no crisp narrative directed
to any dramatic climax. It is just a slice out of life,
wherein you are often at a loss to understand the motives,
and never from first to last know which of the events
that are happening are going to be the decisive ones. For
myself I found the leisurely reading of it a cool, refreshing
draught. If it was a little long, this is not the season to
be complaining of the length of draughts, provided they be
good draughts.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-My father was born on April 1, 1661.
He was thus quite a small boy when the Great Fire of
London was raging, and I have often heard him tell how it
began at Pudding Lane and ended at the Monument,
which was (he said) at one time so surrounded by flames
that it was feared that at any moment it would fall. I
was born when my father was a hundred and sixty-three, in
1804, and I am now one hundred and six. The only draw-
back to this great age, for I have all my faculties, is the
congested state of the cake on my more recent birthdays,
few cakes being now made, such is the decadence of the
confectioner's art, to accommodate more than fifty or sixty
candles at the most. Yours, etc., DEBORAH TRIM.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I think you will be interested in
hearing that I was born as long ago as 1880, and it was, I
remember, on the day when I was twenty that the present

Oldham. Many persons seem wholly to have forgotten this
historic event. Yours, etc., MEMOR.

were made by a gimlet.”—The Times.
Not bad for an impromptu ; but wasn't it just a little
familiar of the Inspector-General 2
TAM HTAB.
MANY years have passed since first I met this individual,
and I have been brought into contact with him at fairly regu-
lar intervals ever since. I did not always come upon him in
the same place, but there was little variety in his habitations.
They were always small, and all of them, if one might
judge by their fittings, were reserved for a certain ritual
of a cleansing character. Tiles, enamel-paint, and handles
of polished metal were usually prominent in the scheme of
decoration; there were rough white cloths hung against
the walls; various detergents were to be found in con-
venient receptacles, and large lustral implements, apparently
destined for the absorption of moisture, were displayed
here and there. The individual of whom I have spoken
always lay prostrate on the floor in an attitude suggestive
both of repose and of humiliation. His garb was simple.
For my own part, I think I never saw him dressed other-
wise than in white, with his name stamped in bold red
letters across his body; but there are amongst my friends
some who assure me that they have seen him in red, with
a white name impressed upon him. I cannot satisfactorily
account for this change. I merely note it, with the sug-
gestion that a faint desire for variety, as a mitigation of
the rigours of his imprisonment, may have brought it about.
Possibly, however, my friends were mistaken.
There can be no doubt, I think, but that my friend—for
in that light I have come to regard him—is a native. His
first name, it is true, has a familiar, indeed an almost
Caledonian appearance. Those, however, who have studied
the customs of the Central African tribes assure me that
names like Ben and Bill and Dick are not infrequently
used both by chiefs and by the inferior classes of the
populace. There, seems, therefore, to be no reason why
Tam should not find its place in this system of nomen-
clature. The construction and the appearance of the name
Htab are to my mind conclusive. Its four letters breathe
the very spirit of the trackless forests and the dismal
swamps of the Dark Continent. There is in its sound
the authentic ring of barbarism.
My poor friend is, no doubt, a great sufferer. He lies
there as one who offers himself to be trampled upon, and
in my thoughtless Anglo-Saxon way I have not scrupled, I
regret to say, to take advantage of his mild and submissive
attitude. He bears the marks of many feet, yet no word
of complaint has ever been heard from him. Indeed, no
word of any kind has broken his silence, and I have been
led to infer that nature has afflicted him with dumbness,
since not even a shower of cold water has availed to make
him protest. Yet I have gathered from certain hints, from
slight changes of posture and the like, that there was once
a time when his name was clear and glorious, and that if
things could be other than they are—a difficult but not an
impossible hypothesis—if the dealings of man with him
could by some chance be reversed, we should understand
him better and be moved to a more appreciative pity of his
fate. In the meantime I can do nothing except to bring
before the public the story of his humility and his wrongs.

PALFREY'S TORTOISE.
PALFREY, the only man in the office
who does not play golf, and is not ad-
dicted to any form of exercise, except
with a paper-cutter, has acquired a
tortoise. He has been interviewed as
to his reasons for this rash act, and
has denied (1) that he wanted it to go
country walks with ; (2) that he wanted
something to love him unselfishly and
without any fuss; (3) that he confused
it with a mongoose, and thought it
would kill rats; (4) that he believed
tortoises moult every year, and had a
scheme to use its discarded shells,
silver-mounted, as wedding-presents.
Palfrey explained that he took the
tortoise home with him from motives
of humanity. It had escaped from a
shop, and had been arrested for loiter-
ing by a policeman who proposed to
send it to the Cat and Dog Home.
“Hardly a suitable place, constable,”
said Palfrey, mildly. “Don’t you think
it would feel lonely there?"
“It could share a cell with a tortoise-
shell cat,” said the constable.
“If I take charge of it and advertise
it, will that be all right 2"
So Palfrey became possessor of the
tortoise at the cost of a shilling to the
policeman and an eighteen-penny adver-
Mabel. “I'v E PLAYEi) rouſ RTEEN.

tisement, which nobody answered, that
if not claimed within six days the
animal would be sold to defray expenses.
This is Palfrey's account of the
transaction. But I have reason to
believe that he bought the tortoise,
spot cash, for a shilling, because he
had just taken up gardening and had
read somewhere that a tortoise is
almost indispensable to kill slugs. But
he has been no more fortunate than
the man who bought a quantity of a
much-advertised insect powder and put
it down for beetles. They finished
what he put down, and came back,
with more beetles, for a second helping.
The grocer who supplied the powder
seemed puzzled for a moment. Then
the true explanation occurred to him.
“You must have the wrong kind of
beetle in your house, Sir. That's how
it is.” Well, Palfrey has got the wrong
kind of tortoise, the kind that lives on
lettuces, sharing them amicably with
the slugs it should destroy. Having
omitted to obtain any warranty with
the tortoise, he has no remedy against
the previous proprietor. But, as I
pointed out to Palfrey, he has not had
the tortoise long enough to be certain
that it is a vegetarian.
“I have what amounts to proof.”
“As how 2 "
Basiſ. “Twei,V E."
“It doesn't smoke, or drink, is a
member of the Peace at Any Price
Party, and goes about bare-headed.
So it is almost certainly a vegetarian.
However, it's really very companion-
able. It comes down the road to meet
me on my way from the station.”
“Does it come far to meet you?”
“Not very far –-in distance. But
it's the spirit of the thing that counts.
You see it only starts to meet me in
the evening just after I leave in the
morning. And then it's slightly uphill.
Makes itself very useful about the
house, too. I put it down on a news-
paper in the garden, on Sunday, to
prevent the thing from blowing away,
and it kept it down for five hours.
In fact, it was so absorbed in its
work that I didn't like to take the
paper away for fear of hurting its
feelings.”
“What was the paper?”
“The Spectator.”
“Have you written to the editor
about it yet?”
“No. Should I?"
“Well, perhaps he could hardly use
it as a proof of intelligence in tortoises
that your one had gone to sleep over
The Spectator. What do you give it
to eat ''''
“Slugs,” said Palfrey shortly.

“I thought you said it ate lettuces,
instead of slugs.”
“That's quite true, but slugs are

lull them into a sense of false security
by pretending it is one of themselves.
But it is taking a long time in getting
to business.”
“Look here, Palfrey, I don't believe
you care twopence about tortoises.
Why did you buy this one?”
“Do you like gardening shop?”
Palfrey asked.
“Not a bit.” -
“Well, I don't care for golf shop,

time five days a week. So I got this
tortoise as a counter-irritant, and I

the first tea-rose to the trysting-arbour,

NEw OPERA.
THE scheme for the forthcoming
series of British Constitutional Con-
certs keeps to much the same lines as
in former years. Thus, while Monday
is reserved for the compositions of
STRAUss, and Tuesday is earmarked for
DEBUssy, Wednesday will be devoted
to the works of STRAUss and DEBUssy,
while Thursday will be consecrated to
those of DEBUssy, and STRAUss. On
Fridays the programme will be of a
miscellaneous character, being confined
to works by Russian, Maeso-Gothic,
Mingrelian, and Bessarabian com-
posers, while the Saturday programme
will be shared between representative
works of the Young Turkish, Podolion,
Neo-Celtic and Bantu schools. The
bâton will be wielded, as on former
occasions, by M. Joskin Narwhal.
Amongst the new works set down
for performance those of the Neo-
Celtic school naturally claim especial
attention. Mr. Cyril Keltie is to the
fore with a new “Wee Free” Fantasia,
in which prominence is assigned to a
Pibroch for four-and-twenty pipers.
Mr. Heinrich Oldbuck's novelties con-
sist of a set of 192 variations on,
“Merrily danced the Quaker's Wife,”
and a tragic scena, entitled “The Bath-
chairman's Credo,” based on Mr.
MEEK's poignant autobiography. The
Bantu composers will be well repre-
sented by Professor Bantock, who will
conduct his new Ethiopian Extrava-
ganza, “Ten Minutes in Tanganyika,”
and a comic symphonic poem called
“Moshesh and Mosilikatse.”
Several of the successes of the last
two seasons will be repeated, so that
the public will be in the fortu-
nate position of again hearing such
masterpieces as Sparchenpflug's
“Carburetta,” overture, Mr. Oldbuck's
“Clapham Junction” suite, and Mr.
G. H. Clutcham's incidental music to
“Belle and the Dragoon.” Room will
also be found for Mr. Donald Bovey's
monumental “Mammoth " pianoforte
concerto, which has never yet been
performed in less than 200 minutes,
and for Dr. Mordecai Jamrach's con-
certo for tuba, in which occurs the
momentous episode for four baker-
loons, an instrument in which Sir
EDGAR SPEYER takes a special interest.

“There is none of the terribilità of
Michelangelo in the libretto, and I
have not shirked the saucy flippancy
of the story, though never overstepping
the bounds of perfect propriety. The

pantry boy and the third footman in
the servants' hall takes the form of a
compact résumé of 69 motives from my
previous works. The part of the de-
mented Duke is specially written for

sesses an entirely original type of voice,
to which I have given the name of

large solo parts my little operetta con-

that I have already finished the first
seven Acts, and the remaining five have

SEASIDE FASHIONS.
IT is reported that hats will again be
conspicuous by their absence at the
most fashionable seaside resorts this
year, though a few of the most exclu-
'sive men will be wearing the colours of
the Household Brigade on straw hats.
'It is thought by those with the least
knowledge that only members of the
Guards' regiments should sport the
well-known colours, but this is an
entirely erroneous idea. Personally, we
think the most fashionable and gentle-
manly attire is a cycling suit of grey
cloth, with grey woollen sweater and
cloth cap—the latter decorated with a
nickel or plated silver badge of one of
the more select cycling clubs, such
as the Upper Camberwell Polytechnic
Rovers — and with this costume a
watch-chain with cycling medals is
indispensable. A “button” portrait of
a lady friend adds a pleasing touch
to the left lapel of the coat, or may be
worn in front of the cap. Grey stock-
ings and low cycling shoes complete a
very smart appearance.
A yachting costume, consisting of
white drill or flannel trousers, blue
reefer coat and yachting cap, with the
badge of any well-known yacht club,
will be in favour with many of those
desirous of prestige on “the prom.”
The wearer may not be connected with
any of the craft in the offing or at
anchor in the bay, but a good impres-
sion can be created by suitable Sartorial
suggestion.
For ladies also the cap of the R.Y.S.
is the most effective headgear and goes
well with a white Glory Quayle jersey.
Men's socks will be in the brightest
colours, “rainbows" being the most
likely to predominate, and the shoes—

For evening band parades, tweeds or

in colours ranging from green to
magenta. The one requisite is that
the coat must be cut with very tight-
fitting waist. Ample skirts, in which
the pockets must be placed diagonally,
are the “dernier cri.” The handker-
chief is always worn in the left sleeve,
and not less than three inches should
protrude. The trousers must be turned
up to show the socks, and the hat
should be set a little to the back of the
head. Woodbines or Toofers should
be worn with this costume, as they
lend a dashing air to the ensemble,
though a heavily silver-mounted briar
may be used on occasion if preferred.

WORDS IN SEASON.

A Forecast.
ALTHough yesterday was another wet
and sunless day, holiday-makers have
every reason to look forward to more
seasonable weather in the near future.
The anti-cyclonic depression to which
we called attention last week is now
veering towards the North-west, accom-
panied by a barometric disturbance of
considerable intensity. This pressure
in the ordinary way would spell rain,
but when taken into consideration
with the local area of the atmo-
spheric bar, and the calorific influence
of the Gulf Stream, its significance
cannot be neglected. A further point
in its favour is the absence of any
decided circular impression and the
increased volume of the trade winds.
Nor must the surcharged density of
the Newfoundland fog banks be mini-
mised, though this is largely counter-
acted by the added voltage. Fortu-
nately the dew-point remains steady.
Summing it up, then, we may say
that, as long as the thermometric
conditions are unaltered, there is every
indication of an improvement in the
prescribed area; the only thing to fear
now being a pronounced typhonic
activity from the North-east. This,
however, is unlikely.

THE PERSONAL POSTER.
WE understand that considerable stir
has been caused among electioneering
experts by an incident that occurred
in a recent by-election. As reported
in the Press an aged citizen of one
hundred and four was driven to the
polling station in a wagonette decorated
with a placard bearing the words: “The
oldest voter in England converted to
Tariff Reform.” There seems to be
little doubt that this suggestive device
will be much in evidence at the next
general election. The idea has been
adopted with enthusiasm by the agents
of both sides.
Our representative called yesterday
evening upon the senior partner of a
firm of printers which makes a speciality
of this sort of work, and had a chat with
him upon the situation. We regret
that we are not at liberty to publish
his name, and we feel that it would be
best not to give any clue whatever as
to his identity.
“Yes,” he remarked, in answer to a
singularly pertinent query on the part
of our representative, “the last elec-
tion was remarkable for the develop-
ment of the poster. You may take my
word for it that in the next the most
powerful political weapon in the field
will be the vehicular placard—if I may
so call it. - -
“Yes”—our representative had inter-
jected another telling observation —
“we are already overwhelmed with
orders. Voters are being asked to
report any little peculiarity they may
possess to head-quarters, and these are
being embodied in terse and striking
phrases. It begins to look as if almost
every conveyance that comes up to the
poll will carry a placard, and the effect
of this personal touch—if I may call
it so—is bound to be enormous.” He
lifted a large square of cardboard that
had been propped up against the desk.
“Here is an example,” he went on,
“from Worcestershire. What do you
think of it 2 '' - -
The placard bore the words, in mas-
sive purple characters, “A NATURALISED
GERMAN wants EIGHT AND won't
wAIT.” The printer began to turn over
a pile of boards at his elbow.
“Here is one from Scotland, very
striking in its way—‘THE ONLY NEGRO
IN KIRKCALDY votes For Home RULE.'
And here are several others — ‘THE
TALLEst MAN IN KENT MEANS To
HAVE A SMALL Holding ; ' ' A RE-
TIRED SMUGGLER converted to FREE
TRADE '; 'A PROFESSIONAL Sword
Swallow ER DISAPPRoves of Food
TAxes”; “A DEAF STONE - BREAKER
welcom Es THE MotoR TAx’; ‘Dis-
TINGUISHED AIRMAN SUPPORTS THE
NEw LAND TAxEs.’”
“And this 2'"
“Ah, that comes from Lancashire.
I think it would be hardly fair to tell
you which party it was ordered by,
but you will agree with me that it is
bound to have its effect—“THE VILLAGE
IDIOT supports THE VETO.'”
As our representative turned to go
he stumbled over a placard in the form
of sandwich boards.
“Is this one of them 2'' he asked,
turning it over.
“Well, no, not exactly. That is a
private order. It does not come from
either political party.” Our
sentative read:—
“THE ONLY SELF-RESPECTING MAN
LEFT IN THE DIvision PREFERs to
WALK.”

LAST week we intelligently antici-
pated some of the questions in the
examination which the Great Western
Railway is conducting with the idea of
testing the competitor's knowledge of
the country served by that line. We
are fortunate to secure a few more
questions from a paper dealing ex-
clusively with the resemblance between
Cornwall and Italy, as suggested by
the well-known poster of the G. W. R.
1. What proofs can you give in
support of the theory that the Phoeni-
cians did not visit Cornwall in search
of tin (as generally supposed), but came
with messages of reproach from Dido
to AEneas, mistaking the shores of the
Duchy for Italy on account of the
similarity of shape?
2. Compare the character and history
of King MARK of Cornwall with those
of MARCUs AURELIUs.
3. What claims have (a) Falmouth
to be considered the Venice, (b) Bod-
min the Florence, and (c) Truro the
Rome cf the West Country?
4. Write a short philological treatise
on the distinction (if any) between
Scilly and Sicily.
5. Contrast (a) The Logan Stone with
the Leaning Tower of Pisa, (b) Bishop
TRELAwNEY with Pope Pius IX., (c) A
Cornish pasty with a Bologna sausage.
7. Translate into Italian “Do 'ee
belong to be zizicling 2" and give some
comparative account of the literary
labours of Sir A. T. QUILLER-Couch
(Fowey) and VIRGIL (Mantua).

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 25.
—As a rule attendance slack on Mon-
days, more especially during earlier
hours of sitting. Members dutifully
follow enticing example of PRINCE
ARTHUR, who stretches his week-end
holiday as far as it will safely go.
Marked difference in appearance of
House to-day. Men flock to it from
far and near. PREMIER has pro-
mised to make statement on engrossing
question of the Conference. At his
request three questions put down by
as many Members were postponed till
to-day. Here they stand on the paper
in everybody's hand. There, below
Gangway on Ministerial side, sit the
inquisitorial Trio, blushing at their
personal prominence.
House suffers with impatience stream
of preliminary queries, including a
Shorter Catechism by permission of
SPEAKER administered to PRESIDENT
of BoARD of TRADE with intent to
egg him on to action in matter of Law
Guarantee business. All eyes fixed on
PREMIER as he sits on Treasury Bench
toying with sheaf of notes. Fancy
he is feeling a little nervous, mood
foreign to his habit. Certainly his
hand seems to shake as he turns over
the folios which doubtless contain text
of momentous statement.
Those seated near note that the
questions have been cut out and for
greater convenience of reply pasted on
top of separate sheets of foolscap.
No. 45 stands in name of Joseph
KING; 46 is WEDGwood's; 47 bears
the honoured name of BYLES OF BRAD-
Ford, still tarrying with us in Commons,
while old chums like CAUSTON and
WALTER FostER have gone to “an-
other place.”
Varying slightly in phrase, all
demand information as to present
state of affairs in the Conference and
as to immediate prospect. PREMIER
notoriously a hard man to “draw "at
Question time. Too heavy a load for
one horse; so three are harnessed to do
the job.
“That'll fetch him,” murmurs WIN-
TERTON under his breath, regarding
scene from over the way with intense
interest.
Question 44 put and answered. “Mr.
KING,” cried the SPEAKER.
KING Joseph rose with solemnity
fitting to occasion. In voice in which
surging emotion was hardly suppressed
he said, “I beg to ask the PRIME
MINISTER Question 45.”
With slow action, the reluctance of
a man brought to face a grave crisis,
“WIIY shou LD A RADICAL WEA R A will ITE
11AT : ”
Why not a coronet, for instance, like Com-
rades Causton and Foster
(Lord Byles of Bradford.)
up gat the PREMIER stood by the
brass-bound box, bringing his sheaves
with him in shape of folios with
the portentous questions pasted at
top. There followed a pause while he
readjusted his papers. But for the

(Mr. Joseph King of North Somerset.)
matting on the floor (a faulty conductor
of sound) you might have heard a pin
drop if one had chanced to fall.
“I will,” said the PREMIER, “answer
the three questions together.”
Another pause, less perceptible in
length, blood-curdling in intensity of
emotion.
“I hope to be able to make a state-
ment on the subject referred to * -
Here another pause of greater dura-
tion. Something like a suppressed cry of
“Ah!” ran along the crowded benches
as Members drew themselves together,
straining their ears to catch the momen-
tous words.
“—during the course of this week.” -
Gathering up his precious folios he
turned and resumed his seat.
There followed a moment of amazed
silence. KING Joseph dreamily put his
hand his head with action suggestive
of intent to cast down his golden crown
around the glassy sea. WEDGwood
stared about as if looking for some
priceless vase, hoary with age of the
renowned founder of his family, suitable
for smashing. As for BYLEs of BRAD-
Ford he made up his mind that the
House of Commons is no longer a
place for him. Happily there is
another.
Then there broke forth a roar of
laughter rising peal on peal.
The House saw the PREMIER's little
joke and enjoyed it immensely.
Business done.--Budget Bill brought
in and read a first time.
Tuesday. — SPEAKER in mellowest
mood. Whether in surcease of pain
or pleased anticipation of near holi-
day who shall say. Urbanity takes
form of tender consideration for welfare
and personal comfort of Members.
RoNALDSHAY first to evoke the senti-
ment. Noble Earl, brought up in the
Vice-regal court at Calcutta what time
GEORGE CURzoN represented his sove-
reign, has acquired something of the
grace of manner and charm of speech
native to his chief. Seconding an
amendment designed to bestow pre-
ferential duties upon Empire-grown
tea, memories of sojourn on banks of
Ganges flooded his ingenuous mind.
Proposed to treat House to disquisition
on state of political affairs in India.
“Order! order ' " said the SPEAKER.
“That line of argument will be more
suitable to-morrow when the Indian
Budget will be considered.”
Then, fearing he might have wounded
the sensibilities of a still young Member,
he added in sweetest tones, “The noble
lord must not exhaust himself.”
Taking the hint, RoNALDSHAY sat
down.
Later, Mr. HINDLE, who distin-
guished himself at the General Election

Mr. Bonar Law (aside to Mr. Alfred Lyttelton.) “These disguises don't seem to work, some-
how, Alfred ; it's really very disheartening ' "
by recapturing Darwen long held by
Unionists, drew upon himself a fresh
flash of kindly light. Was proposing
to deliver lecture illustrating injury that
would be inflicted on the cotton
industry by institution of Colonial pre-
ference. Got through his exordium
when SPEAKER again interposed.
“The question before the House,”
he remarked, “has no reference to the
cotton industry, and I must ask the
hon. gentleman to come back to tea.”
HINDLE's honest face glowed with
pleasure. RoNALDSHAY, heir to a mar-
quisate, was merely besought not to
wear himself out by untimely labour.
He, a mere country solicitor, publicly
asked out to tea by the First Commoner
of the land.
Business done.—Indian Budget ex-
pounded by Most AGU in excellent
speech, a model of perspicuity.
Wednesday, August 3.—Adjournment
of both Houses for Recess. Meat again
with the fogs in November. PREMIER
and PRINCE ARTHUR, shaking hands,
heartily echo each other's “Au revoir.”
“Taking it all in all,” says PRINCE
ARTHUR, “with special reference to the
latter half, this one of the pleasantest
sessions I remember. You did a clever
thing (I won't forget it when I take your
place) by combining Easter and Whit-
sun holidays, giving us a decent time
for recreation instead of two inconveni-
ent scraps. Then came the Truce,
when you and I of our helmets made
hives for bees. No longer need for
close attendance at Question time or
later. Come when you like, go when
you please. Why can't we always
carry on business in this fashion ?”
“Wait and see what November
brings forth,” said the ever - wary
PREMIER.
Business done.—Eaceunt omnes.
“Apparently the mother-in-law joke is not
dead yet. From ‘the other side' comes the
statement that two well-known managers have
received a petition, signed by many members of
the gentle sex in Boston, urging them to sup-
press in future all allusions to mothers-in-law,
on the ground that they are for the most part
vulgar and immoral.” — Manchester Evening
Chronicle.
At the risk of prolonging the joke for
one more week we protest against
this attack on mothers-in-law.

[The Editor of Punch cannot hold himself

SIR,-May I draw your attention
to a holiday-maker's grievance 2 The
Mayor, Corporation and Burgesses of
| Southpool deliberately and with malice
aforethought attracted me to their town
by the following devices—(a) Poster
inscribed “Come unto these yellow
sands,” and depicting mixed bathing in
the airiest costumes on a yellow beach,
in a blue sea, and under a cloudless
sky; (b) poster showing aviation meet-
ing—same sky, sands, and sea, only
deliciously shaded by the passing of
| flying machines; (c) a pamphlet stating
that the average temperature of South-
pool in July and August is 81° in the
shade, and that the town is universally
known as the British Naples.
When I arrived at this health resort
I found that the sands, sea and sky
were all grey, instead of yellow and
blue, as per sample; that north-eastern
winds caused the abandonment of the
flying meet; and that the only amuse-
ment in its place was a Free Trade
orator suffering from a cold in his head.
Nor did I hear a single resident or
visitor allude to Southpool as Naples.
I am claiming damages from the
Corporation for misrepresentation, and
I intend in court to prove special
damage as follows:—Three bottles of
cough mixture at 2s. 9d.; carriage of
fur coat from London, 3s. 6d.
Yours truly, NUDA VERITAs.
SIR,-May I indicate to parents and
guardians a cheap amusement for
children kept at home this summer ?
Construct a rain-gauge in the garden.
Most gardens contain a useless
sun-dial, and a mason will chip out a
rain-gauge on it in a few hours. I was
cheered and delighted this morning
when my six-year-old boy ran into the
house and said, “1.25 inch of rain
last night, Daddy, and The Daily Mail
says there's another depression coming
—we'll beat the record yet.”
Yours truly,
A Thoughtful, PARENt.
P.S.—By a slight alteration of the
motto on my sun-dial I have made it ap-
plicable to a rain-gauge. It now runs:—
“Horas non numero nisi madentes "
(The only hours I record are the dripping ones.)
SIR,-Since it is admitted that
electricity has much to do with the
weather, may I draw your attention to
the following facts? I have carefully
noted the places where depressions
originate, and I find that they all
come from Protectionist countries.
Not a single depression is mentioned as
originating in Turkey—the only other
Free Trade country in Europe. Is it
not likely that our present weather is
caused by the electrical devices of
foreign manufacturers ? If a fifty-per-
cent, duty were instantly placed on
imported macintoshes and umbrellas,
it would no longer pay our rivals to
create depressions artificially. Then,
Sir, we should get back to the good old
days when the thermometer always
stood at 80° in the shade, and corn at
80s. per quarter.
Yours truly, ANti-Cobden.

things which I was going to
say to Mrs. LockHART LANG in the way of gentle criticism
of her story, Bubbles and Troubles (ALston Rivers), but
I have resolved now not to say them. The chief reason
for this decision is that I have quite forgotten what the
little things were, and can only recall that my final impres-
sion was of a book full of charm and gay spirits. If I had
any points of difference with the author, they must have
been very small points; well, let them go. A writer of
Mrs. LANG's sex who is gifted with a touch as light as this
and a humour as irresponsible is best taken as you find
her. Wit and irony women have often exploited success-
fully in books; but this happy irrelevancy seems to me to
be something new. So I take off my hat to Mrs. LANG and
to the delightful Peter, and I beg her to give him another
show in her next book. I must have some more of
Peter, and that very quickly.

and Mr. A. F. J. Ford, we get more than mere opinions on
the game: we get history too. This book enables one
(a little like GoLDSMith's warrior) to shoulder a thousand
bats and show how fights were won.
'ear (STANLEY PAUL) brings off a double event, for it
strikes “a new note in fiction,” and me with the horrors.
In these short stories I am told, by the publishers, that
“Miss Nesbit exhibits remarkable powers of imagination
and insight into the psychology of the emotions,” and I
am not inclined to dispute the accuracy of that statement.
Nevertheless, when I remember the delightful books which
she has written, I admit that this exhibition of her
versatility leaves me exceedingly depressed. It is a relief
to add that there is one story which strikes an old note
and a happy one. In “The Followers” no one, to borrow.
a picturesque phrase from America, is “scared stiff,” and,
although two people do jump into a river, they could swim
quite nicely, and before even changing their clothes they
decided to marry each other. But if you prefer something
really grisly and gruesome, I recommend “John Charring-
ton's Wedding.”

THE President of the Ancient Order

first-rate actors, and some perhaps
musicians.” This letter, we hear, has
caused considerable offence in stage
circles, where it is denied that the
paucity of first-rate actors on the
boards is due to the fact that so many
of them are away in prison.

GODIVA AND THE DOLLS.
[Under the Australian tariff, dolls are only admitted free if they are
wearing no clothes whatever. A mere ribbon renders a doll liable to
pay 25 per cent. on her value.]
OFTEN, when I am asked to say
(Touching the Female Right to Vote)
If women hold their own to-day
With heroines out of times remote,
Try as I will, I cannot trace
Among the ladies now alive a
Strict parallel to match the case
Of Coventry's sublime GoDiv.A.
BoADICEAs and JoANs of ARC.
I've seen them, gowned in modern guise,
Answer the war-cry, “To the Park 1"
Under the street's indifferent eyes;
In tailored garments seen them go,
Or blouses open to the weather,
But never one GoDivA, no,
In the ungarnished “altogether.”
That was indeed a noble dame!
Altruist to the finger-tips,
For others' sake she let her shame
Suffer a short but sharp eclipse;
To stop the super-tax decree
That gnawed their vitals like a dragon,
Contrary to her custom she
Rode through the town without a rag on.
Where is the Suffragette, I ask,
... Who, with a greater goal to win,
Would undertake so high a task
And sally out in just her skin 2
Where is the Suffragist would ride
Up Downing Street (or even toddle)
In the exact costume supplied
To that superb equestrian model?
Such exhibitions might be made
The object of remark, no doubt,
But then they've always said it paid
To have the Movement talked about ;
Till they perform this feat and fail,
Elet none contend (the old evasion)
That they have tried, without avail,
All modes of peaceable persuasion.
This thought occurs to me because
I hear of puppets who elude
Australia's tricky Tariff-laws
By simply landing in the nude;
Types of the Sex—in wax and bran;
For poupées, even in the dim age
Of prime and prehistoric Man,
Were mostly made in Woman's image.
Madam, I won't commend a coup
Which Modesty might well deplore;
I merely cite what dolls can do,
I state the bare facts, nothing more;
They show that, if you'd ſain defy
A monstrous man-made legislature,
Your fairest hopes would seem to lie
In a return to artless nature.

Intelligent Anticipation.
“Geneva, August 1. –It is hoped that the June and July storms
have ceased.”—Times, August 4, 1910.
THE SANGUEDUCT.
I AM an eighteen handicap man at golf, but most erratic.
On rare occasions I do a rather decent round.
To do a round under ninety I would sacrifice more than
anyone would believe.
Yesterday I did the first seventeen holes in eighty-six
I didn't cheat; my luck was uncanny.
The last hole is a three bogey, and the only hazard in
it is a small artificial watercourse guarding the green.
This hazard is my bâte noire. I lead a continually growing
agitation amongst members of the club for its removal.
It is a very difficult carry from the eighteenth tee.
I got a good drive, but there was a head wind. There
is a gentle undulation between the tee and the water-
course, so until I actually reached the hazard I was igno-
rant of whether my ball was safe or not.
My opponent and marker was a clergyman.
My ball was in the ditch floating under some abutting
earth. -
Many could not have analysed their feelings then as I
did (aloud), as follows. N.B.-After the lapse of time I
withdraw nothing.
“Come here. I want to show you something. There—
do you see it? That misshapen little lump of what they
do the Congo atrocities for? There it is, floating about.
(Witches float too, you know—the devil never allows his
own to drown.) Yes, that's what they do; excel the
horrors of the Inquisition in order to get the india-rubber
to make a little swine of a ball like that. That's its
origin, Sir, so one cannot be surprised at its behaviour.
And I'll tell you something else. It looks white, and so |
it is—outside. That's just a coating of paint. But do
you know what colour it is inside? It's black—black to ||
the core—the colour of sin, and of the miserable race of
slaves who were tortured so that it might be manufactured. |
And what does it do if you put it on the fire? Why,
it smells abominably.
“Gone up sixpence in price, too, it has, because of the
rubber boom. That's what they call irony. However,
we'll leave that. The ball's not important. What I really
want to commend to your attention is this ditch—I'll call
it what other people call it, so as to make myself under-
stood. This absolutely unnecessary watercourse. Every-
thing in creation, however foul, however pernicious, has
some useful function to fulfil; in some way fits into the
scheme of the universe—save only this watercourse. I
don't know why I say watercourse. ‘Sangueduct ' is, of
course, its proper description. This ditch, I happen to
know, was commenced on All Hallows Eve. Colonel
Bulleigh, R.E., whose casting vote was responsible for its
origin, has won a medal and five sweepstakes on this last
green, through his opponent faring as I have done. What
does this show, pray 2 That, like his rival, Colonel Bogey
(also of the Sappers), he is in league with the Evil One /
“Boy, will you kindly break my clubs into small pieces
and put the pieces one by one into this pretty drain which
I have just been describing? They're good company for
the ball, and fit occupants for the place.
“No, leave the ball there. I shall not complete the
round to get a rotten 92. I shan't play golf any more.

Inscription on Rufus' Stone, New Forest.]
The RE's a word left out, there's a word left out,
There's a word left out, there are possibly two;
That something's omitted admits no doubt;
It's as plain to me as it is to you.
Whatever it is it's enough to vex
The turbulent soul of RUFUs Rex.
A dirty old woman stood close by,
And a dirty old man stood close to her;
They looked at me with a friendly eye,
And the hag advanced and addressed me: “Sir”—
In short, she hinted at RUFUs' ghost,
And offered me cards for the halfpenny post.
The man had a bundle of clumsy sticks;
He showed me three and he showed me four:
“I'm a fair old dealer,” he said. “No tricks;
I made 'em myself, though I'm only pore.”
And the end of the eloquent words he spoke
Was an offer to sell a stick of oak.
I waved them away, and thus began—
They were far from clean and as far from neat—
“Lord D. was not a grammatical man,
For the sense of his words is incomplete.
There's a valde deflendus hiatus here"—

So I left them alone and thought about
The growing tree which the Lord had seen
When he wrote the words and he left one out :-
“The word is ‘happened,’” I cried. “Why seek a
More plausible word? It's that. Eureka!”
But still it's queer that a man should write
A faulty sentence on lasting stone,
To be read as long as the sun gives light
By thousands, and not by himself alone—
A fact of which, I presume, Lord DELAwaite,
When he wrote the inscription, was perfectly well aware.

Describing the Autumn Manoeuvres in the East of Scot-

“A steam launch from the Thetis called at Leith for provisions, and
this fact is taken by some to indicate that Edinburgh and Leith have
fallen into the hands of the enemy.”
We understand that Edinburgh and Leith take the sanguine
view that the launch may have called for provisions at
Leith because the crew of the Thetis wanted something to eat.

#ammy,
SAMMY-as we all called LINLEY SAMBourne, and as we
all thought of him and always shall think of him to the
end—SAMMY has left us. He had not been to the Table
for some weeks, and not since last autumn had he been
his old bright twinkling self; yet, though we knew early
that he was very ill, and latterly that it was unlikely he
would ever be at work among us again, we had not with
any thoroughness foreseen our loss.
SAMMY is dead, and the Table can never be the same again.
He was both our greatest pride and our greatest pleasure.
His genius as an artist—his delicacy and his strength,
his fantasy and his realism, the solidity of his work and
But to
its aerial grace—that, of course, was our pride.
this he added as a cartoon-
ist and weekly adviser the
pictorial vision in its most
highly developed form, see-
ing in pictures where most
of us saw only in words or
ideas, and knowing instantly
not only what could be
done, but—more important
perhaps—what could not be
done. And to this he added
an astounding memory of
the public events of his own
lifetime, with no little know-
ledge of universal history
and a vast store of out-of-
the-way information, all of
which was exact. It was
these qualifications that
made him, beyond his mas-
tery of his medium, our
pride. Others of us could
remember that TENNIEL, say,
had once used a certain fable
in a cartoon, but it was
SAMMY who would remark,
“If you turn to March,
1863, you will find it.”
Others might fancy that
they knew what, say, a
German forage cap was like;
it was SAMMY who, with
a few strokes of his pencil,
set it down accurately for the guidance of the junior
cartoonist. For he was the kindest of helpers: the fruit
of years of the closest observation was at the disposal of
any who asked him.
These, then, were our pride—this treasury of fact, this
vivid fancy, this creative eye, this generosity of mind. And
our pleasure! Ah, that is not so easy to describe; impos-
sible indeed with a hand that does not tremble a little.
The SAMMY of our delight was inimitable, unique, a
creature of drollery and mischief, shrewd yet naive, good
talker, good listener, and most admirable laugher, Never
again will the leg of Toby, M.P., be pulled as only SAMMY
could pull it; never again shall we hear the story of the
Gnome King told in perfection. And SAMMY was our
delight no less because he was also something of a butt.
Next to making a joke himself, which he always signalled
by an upward wave of his hand, he enjoyed a joke against
himself. Age could not wither nor custom stale the body
of myth which had gathered about him during his nine-and-
thirty years at the Table; and every time any of these
But now we know.
LINLEY SAM bour.NE AT THE Roux D TABLE.
|legends were re-told—that one describing his adventures in
Paris, for example, when the staff of the paper went over
together in 1889; or that of his boasted friendship with an
imaginary warrior, “General Stores,”—every time these
ancient fables were re-told, always with new apocryphal
garnish, SAMMY was the most delighted listener.
In the
grip of laughter his eyes danced, glistened and disappeared.
Best of his own jokes were his curious malapropisms,
whether consciously artificial or unconsciously blurted, no
one quite knows. But that they were genuine we shall all
of us continue to hope. “It was so still you could have
picked up a pin,” is an excellent example; and again, “He
hadn't a rag to stand upon;” and again, of a burden under
which some public person-
age was suffering, “It's a
White Elephant round the
man's neck” — surely the
finest compound image of
embarrassment ever im-
agined
None of the photographs
do SAMMY justice, for they
omit animation. His expres-
sion was capable of extreme
vivacity and his eyes were
quick and bright. In repose
his face latterly was worn
and tired; but once you got
him interested—and in good
health he had always been
as quickly interested as a
child: in fact, to a great
extent he was a child, and
it is absurd to write of his
age as sixty-five—once you
got him interested, he was,
almost to the end, instantly
gay and spirited once more.
Nor do the portraits bring
out a curious likeness to Sir
WALTER Scott which had
been increasing in late years.
Not only was the conforma-
tion of his head akin, but
at his place next the Editor,
at the top of the Table, with
a window at his side and back, the light, on summer
Wednesdays, before the blinds were drawn, used to touch
his silvered hair with a radiance such as more than one
painting of Scott exhibits. -
But SAMMY is dead, Never again will any of us receive
any of his cheery little notes addressed in two inks, red
and black, often with a design around the stamp and
usually containing some diverting drawing within, the
fruit of his lavish invention; never again will he inquire
of Toby, M.P., with a twinkle, how the pineapples are
doing under the Hythe glass; never again will he recount
his triumphs on the grouse moors or in the coverts; never
again will he dash off a little sketch on the back of his
menu. All of us have one or more of these treasures, done
with a freedom and openness and brio that make quite
clear what poor PHIL MAY meant when he once said,
“Everything I know I learnt from SAMMY." Never again,
in short, will the Table be what it was. SAMMY is dead,
and, while Art has lost a noble, sincere and devoted servant,
we have lost our merriest friend.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOUSE - KEEPING.
I. The Declaration.
BILL and I share a flat. Bill
arranges the flowers and I arrange the
meals. There is, of course, Mrs.
Cripps, but she does what she is told.
This all started a week ago. On the
Monday I ordered chops; on Tuesday,
steak; on Wednesday, a leg of lamb;
on Thursday, the same, cold; on Friday,
a round of beef; on Saturday, the same,
cold; on Sunday, the same, colder still.
It now became necessary to order
another Monday's dinner. -
“Bill, my dear fellow,” I said, “I
have done all the thinking for a week.
Suppose you thought of something for
a change.” -
Mrs. Cripps gathered round, waiting
greedily for orders. Bill pondered
silently and long. - -
“Why not a couple of chops,” he
said at last, trying to look inspired; “or
a steak 2" -
“We have had them already,” I said,
severely. -
“I know we eat a lot,” he answered,
“but do you think we eat them quite
all 2 There may be some more in
London, somewhere.”
Food is not a matter to jest about.
I said so.
“I can think of nothing else that we
have not had,” he said, sadly. “After
all, there is only mutton or beef,
whether you call it chop or steak or
lamb or a la maitre d'hôtel. Let's
leave the declaration to dummy. Let
Mrs. Cripps make trumps.” -
“Mrs. Cripps,” said I, “we leave it.
The declaration is up to you. What
are you going to make it 2"
Mrs. Cripps is a brilliant woman.
“What about a nice little chicken 2''
she said. Then she departed, and Bill
sighed heavily, as a man who had been
through a severe mental strain. He
had been thinking of no trumps.
“Suppose,” said he, “only suppose
she had said: “We'll go without " ' "
II. Economy.
After all, Bill did not stay in to wel-
come the chicken. The orders had
been given at breakfast (how one meal
leads to another!), but some time dur-
ing the day Bill was telephoned for to
feed with the Watsons. I found him
dressing when I returned.
“Sorry, old man,” he said, “but I
thought I had better go.”
“Keep your sorrow for yourself,” I
answered. “If you suppose that by
getting out of the flat you are going to
get out of paying for your half of the
chicken, you show that you don't under-
stand the elements of house-keeping.”
There was a little silence after that.
Bill began to wonder if it was too late
to put the Watsons off. . Then he
brightened a little. “After all,” he said,
“I can have my half grilled for break-
fast to-morrow morning.”
“I shouldn't count too much on that,”
said I; “I cannot guarantee anything,
when I am left by myself.”
Bill made some private arrangement
with Mrs. Cripps, and started out.
“Hope you have a good dinner,” I said.
“Tell the Watsons I am sorry I
couldn't come.” -
“But they never asked you,” said
Bill.
“Tell them that is why I couldn't
come. And don't forget to keep the
interests of the larder before your mind.
If you can come by anything solid for
the store-room, do so. Anyhow, drop
a hint to the Watsons in future to ask
both or neither of us. To ask one, does
not help the poultry bill and will only
lead to unpleasantness at breakfast.”

When Bill returned, he was very
pleased about something. “Don’t say
you have come away with half a
chicken, to make matters square for
breakfast?” I said hopefully. He
shook his head.
“The Watsons are very mean about
that sort of thing. But I have collected
a lot of knowledge off Mrs. Watson.
You were wrong about the beef and
mutton; there are other things.”
“It was you who said there weren't,”
I retorted. “I always knew there were
chickens.”
“There are veal, rabbits, hares, part-
ridges, ducks, oysters, pork, haricot . . .”
“Haricots may not be shot out of
the season,” I corrected.
“To say nothing of fish: turbot, cod,
sole, filets of sole, sole a la portugatse,
sole a la française, sole . . .”
“Enough,” said I. “What shall we
have for dinner to-night?”
“Fish is hardly nourishing enough,”
said Bill.
“Haricots,” I said, “might be any-
thing. They invite fraud.”
“Partridges and oysters are out of

THE OPTIMIST.
LET others ply the scurril dart,
To every virtue blind,
Mine is the nobler, gentler part
To glorify mankind.
Unstirred by spite, unmoved by qualms,
I live laborious days
In ladling out my precious balms
Of superfatted praise.
In strident tones I love to greet
Each multi-millionaire;
I see kind hearts in Curzon Street,
Pure souls in Belgrave Square.
The simple homes of new-made lords
With ecstasy I paint,
And every actress on the boards
I welcome as a saint.
I cheer the rare secluded soul
With gross unwelcome lauds;
With equal fervour I extol
The worthies and the frauds.
And no self-advertising ass
Who deals in brag and bluff
Is too preposterously crass
To miss my weekly puff.
'Tis so with letters as with life:
Good authors may go free
Of Bludyer's lacerating knife;
They cannot 'scape from me.
But whether they be great or small,
Or superman or sub.,
I lavish butter on them all
From my exhaustless tub.
Nor is it solely on the quick
That I my praises shed,
In liberal measure, slab and thick,
I heap them on the dead;
Till heroes of the spacious days
Of great ELIZA's reign
Assume the bright and winning ways
Of WINSTON and HALL CAINE.
The paladin of high romance,
The martyr and the sage,
Join in a never-ending dance
Across my chatty page;
And queens and beauties, who of yore
Made empires clash and fall,
I bring in human guise before
The modern servants' hall.
What matter if some squeamish folk
A rare resentment feel,
If jaundiced critics growl and croak
Of mercenary zeal;
No irony, however fierce,
Can mortify my pride;
No spear is sharp enough to pierce
The thickness of my hide.

A T. P.-CAL REVIEW.
A REFORMER's REM.INIsceXCES.”
It has ever been one of the regrets
of my life that I never met Joshua
Tackaberry, and my regret is all the
more poignant because I missed my
opportunity by so little. He was to
| open an agricultural show in Brixville,
| and I, then a raw lad from Athlone,
| had been deputed to report his speech;
but, owing to some misunderstanding,
I missed my train and only arrived just
after he had left. Fate never threw us
together again in later life, but I con-
tinued an ardent admirer of the man
to the day of his death. It is, there-
fore, with pleasure that I pen these
few words of appreciation of this
pioneer agriculturalist.

It goes without saying that this great
movement was not without its enemies.
The squireens were up in arms at once,
and by bribes, threats and petty tyran-
nies endeavoured to thwart it. It is
instructive to read Tackaberry's de-
scription of his first reception in
Market Plumboro’, and one gets some
idea of the depths to which the
squirearchy stooped. He says:
[About three hundred words.]
IV.
Such, then, were the enemies with
whom he had to contend. Being essen-
tially a fighter, Tackaberry willingly
accepted the challenge. In a letter to
a life-long friend, Josiah Baggs, he
writes:

But the struggle was not of long
duration. Backed as he was by the
vast majority of turnip-growers, he

TWO IS COMPANY–
I HAD asked my old friend Coysegame
to stay with me at Frambridge for the
week-end, and I could see from his
face when he arrived that something
unpleasant must have happened to him
recently. But, as he said nothing at
| the time, I maturally asked no questions.
However, after dinner, as we were
smoking on the lawn, he told me the
whole story:—
“I really can't remember when I've
had a more trying journey,” said
Coysegame. “If I'd only travelled
third-class, as I’d intended, I should
have been comfortable enough. But,
though I'd taken a third-class ticket,
I found there was only one smoking
compartment in my part of the train
and all the corner seats in that were
occupied. So I decided to go first-
class and pay the difference at the
other end. There was another man in
the first-class carriage I got into, but
he was absorbed in The Spectator, and
was a quiet, reserved-looking person
who did not seem at all likely to be
conversational. Which suited me
exactly, for I hate having to talk in a
train. He sat in the farther corner,
and I took the seat by the window next
to the platform. We were just about
to start, when the seat opposite mine
was taken by a new-comer who struck
me unfavourably from the first. He
was big and uncouth, with rugged,
battered features, narrow, deep-set eyes,
and a shock of grizzled hair; he wore a rather seedy
blue serge suit, a tweed cap of a violent pattern, and a
green-and-yellow tie, and above his boots there was a
liberal display of purple socks. A vacuous youth was
seeing him off with scarcely disguised relief, as he gave
mysteriously in pressive instructions in a slightly Trans-
Atlantic accent. ‘Then you go and see that party and get
the business fixed up right away,’ he said; “mind, don't
you tell him anything. But be straight.” He held on to
the vacuous youth's reluctant hand as the train moved out,
repeating, ‘That's all you have to do—be straight !” Then
he produced a cigar of unpromising exterior, and asked
me if I could oblige him with a match. I did, though in a
manner which I hoped would make it quite clear that this
was to be the beginning and the end of our intercourse.
But after a minute or so he asked me for another match.
“Funny thing,' he remarked, “but I’ve lit my cigar wrong
end. That don' marrer,’ he added, as he reversed it and
lighted up once more, ‘I shan't notice it after a puff or
two. I gave up smoking lil' time ago—burri've come
back to it again. I like a good cigar. A bad cigar—well,
a bad cigar is rorren l’ I agreed with him, though I had
reason to think that his taste in brands was less fastidious
than he implied. “Sent a box to a fren' o' mine the other
day,’ he continued; “he wrote me he'd never smoked any-
thing like 'em in all his life. That's what he tole me.’
I could quite believe it, but I did not say so. The cause
of his unreserve was fairly obvious by this time, and I
shielded myself behind my evening paper from any further
advances. Or rather I thought I had—till he looked
round the corner of it and inquired how I liked our noo

KING 2 The least sensitive rhinoceros would have been
rebuffed by the curtness with which I answered the query,
but it had no effect on him. He merely pushed a six-
penny magazine under my journal and told me that the
cover was a portrait of His Majesty, and I could read all
about him inside. I said I had seen it—which was
only a surface truth—and he lumbered across to the other
man and offered the magazine to him. The other man
thanked him politely but distantly, and explained that he
was already reading something else. My hope was that
this would serve as a conversational opening between them
and that I should be left in peace. But the battered-
looking person appeared to decide on reflection that I was
the more sympathetic and responsive of the two, so he
returned to me. ‘Bought it at bookstall coming 'long,' he
explained muzzily, ‘I don’ know why Igorrit. I'm goin'

my paper, but I could not help wondering whether the
thorough gentleman might not regret before long that he
had been so pressing. ''Scuse me,’ he began again, but

lady this evenin'," he went on, 'ver' pretty young lady, too,
so I'm boun' smarren myself up a bit, haven' I ?' My
sympathies were all with the young lady, but I remained
silent—which was more than he did. “These things you

see me in now ain' much,' he informed me, “burr I've got
good clothes if I like to purrem on. I'm a gerrilman
— very near millionaire. This is my name.’ And he
brought out a dingy envelope and tried to force it on me.
“If you was to read what's in that letter,’ he remarked,
‘it 'd upset you—no, it 'd upset me—but never min', you
can read it if you want to ' ' My disclaimer of all curi-
osity on the subject seemed for the first time to give him a
faint impression that, after all, I was not the bosom friend
he had supposed me, and for a moment he sat and scowled
at me with dark suspicion. But either he came to the
conclusion that this was mere fancy on his part, or decided
to make one more effort to conquer my affection. “I’m
rough,' he said, “burr I'm good sort. C'nadian I am.
Wherever I go, everybody likes me. Everybody loves me!'
I could have told him of at least one exception to this
general rule, but I refrained. I was determined not to give
him the least en-
couragement. The
quiet man in the
other corner went
on reading The
Spectator, but I
could see that I
had his sympathy.

Fortunately, he not only accepted my explanation and gave
me a receipt for the excess fare, but persuaded my champion
that he would get to Chelmchester all the sooner if he took
a carriage nearer the engine.
But I hadn't seen the last of him, even then. When we
reached Chelmchester he appeared at the window. “I tole

A THEORY OF TAILs.
The Zoo was suffocating in the rays of the afternoon
sun. I paused for a moment to watch a monkey with a
pathetic face absent-mindedly, almost sadly, clutch the tail
of a sleeping relative above. The sleeping relative awoke
on the floor very talkative and thrilled, but the originator of
the pleasantry was out of reach and with the face of one
on the verge of tears.
“Wot a pity they 'ave tails,” said a voice beside me.
He was a little scrubby man with a soiled collar, a
straw hat, and a faded frock coat.
I paid no attention.
... He looked about him rapidly, then came closer, and in
a hoarse whisper:
“I say, guv'nor, d' you know wot I calls it? Why, it's
a tragedy.". * .
“Ah,” I returned vaguely.
“Yus, a tragedy, becorse why?
parents neither— ain't that so 2 "
I endeavoured to convey that I was prepared to swear
that my father, once a K.C., had never within my know-
ledge mentioned the fact in my hearing.
He assumed the attitude of a modest man caught in the
right. “There y' are,” he said. -
There was a pause. A series of shrill screams in a
distant. part of the room suggested another stroke of
humour on even more ambitious lines.
The little scrubby man smiled knowingly.
“There y' are again—tryin' to sit on their tails and 'ide
their feelin's.” -
I was a little perplexed.
“Talk of the Fall,” he snorted with considerable scorn.
“When we lorst our tails we became deceitful. And
why? Becorse we 'ad nothin' to give us away. They
know it; look at 'em. They'd give anythin' to get rid of
'em. It 's like carrying a truth-gauge on your waistkit.”
He came closer and stared triumphantly up into my face.
He was in a glow with eloquence. He tapped me playfully
on the chest.
“Imagine it—your thoughts, 'opes, most sacred feelin's
at the mercy of a cruel gloatin' world just becorse you
'ave a tail. For instance, you're proposin' to the parents
of your young lady. Why, your tail would be between
your legs trying to get out o' sight. An' what 's 'the
effect on their tails? Curlin' like ’oops. They'd know
you 'aven't a brass farthin' at once.”
“You have no reason to suppose—” I began hotly.
“No 'arm meant, mister,” he interposed, soothingly.
“Then think of 'avin’ to attend funerals and sichlike.
No matter 'ow gloomy your countenance, wot if your tail
was waggin' like a rip-rap through pure light-'eartedness?”
I admitted the prospect was worthy of thought.
“Or in business, 'ow could you name a price with any
confidence if your tail was on the floor and 'ad all the air
of a wrong 'un ?” - *
The sun had sunk at last. Shadows crept over the room.
In the corner opposite a silent baboon stood statuesque
against the evening sky.
“Of corse I'm not denyin' there would be advantages.
I'm no dorg-in-the-manger. I'm willin' to come out and
share and share alike, be it argyment or anythin'. You'll
be sayin' wot satisfaction to the orator to 'ear the thump
of approvin' tails; or the actor in the scene where the
'eroine carsts her 'elpless babe into the racin' mill-stream—
why, it would be easy to jump in after a glance at the
droopin' tails in the stalls.”
I nodded thoughtfully.

For a moment I wished that he had worn a tail that
might have betrayed something of his purpose, which
seemed to me rather obscure. Then I dropped him out of
my mind and began to wonder how late it was. But

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PUNISHMENT THAT
FITTED THE CRIME. -
IT may as well be explained at the
beginning as at the end that it was
only a dream; you would have guessed
it anyhow.
One morning, after a criminally reck-
less supper, the Leading Actor found him-
self in a police court, and in the dock.
How he came there he did not know,
but what concerned him most at the
time was the distressing fact that he
was clothed only in his pyjamas. All
at once he became aware that the
magistrate was addressing him.
“You are charged,” he was saying,
“with an offence under the Publicity
Act, 1910. One of the provisions of
that Act, I may remind you, makes it
a misdemeanour for any man, woman,
or child resident in the United King-
dom to be interviewed for the Press
more frequently than once a month ;
and in prescribing the appropriate
penalty the Act directs that such inci-
dents as photographs, bons-mots, and
domestic touches shall be held to con-
stitute an aggravation of the offence.
Now it has been proved against you
that you have caused or allowed inter-
views with yourself to appear in no
fewer than five different papers during
the past week. In one of these, which
I single out as providing the most
flagrant breach of the Act, you are
shown pictorially in various attitudes

your garden, in your motor-car, and so
forth. I have no doubt in my own

to make an example of your case and
to inflict the maximum penalty the law

Take him.away.” -
He was led from the dock by a
couple of vicious policemen, but in-
stead of being conducted to the cells,
as he had expected, he was pushed
with much unnecessary violence into
the street. Once outside the court, he
did not stay to speculate upon the
meaning of his apparent liberty, but
rushed towards his home, pursued all
the way by a jeering crowd that found
infinite satisfaction and food for wit in
the composition of his limited attire.
And above the shouting of the mob
he could hear, as he ran, a curious
buzzing noise, bringing back vague
recollections which he could not track
to their source. - -
How he finally arrived home and
got through the business of the day,
he could not afterwards remember.
But he was conscious that whatever
he did and wherever he went there
was still that elusive buzzing, and
... occasionally a blinding light that filled
him with nameless terror. In the
evening the two vicious policemen
called for him again and intimated
that he must accompany them. This
time the entire town seemed to have
turned out to witness his humiliating
progress through the streets; and still
that buzzing noise, and again that
blinding light . . . - - -
He found himself seated in the
centre of a large and crowded place of
entertainment, evidently a music-hall.
A couple of comic acrobats were just
finishing their turn, and then the lights
suddenly went out and a cinematograph
performance began. But in place of
the customary pictures of winter sports
in Switzerland or racing motor-boats
there appeared on the screen a crowd
gathered expectantly outside a sombre-
looking building. Presently the doors
of the building opened, and two dark-
coated figures were seen gripping a mise-
rable, flimsily-clad— Great Heavens,
it was himself A sweat of agony broke
over him as he saw the scene of the
morning enacted again — the panic
flight, the scanty garb, the jeering mob.
But worse followed. Upon the screen
was thrown the legend, “Scenes from
the Home Life of an Actor,” and there
he saw himself playing the leading
part in a succession of intimately
domestic episodes. In one he was
quarrelling with his wife, in another he
was having his hair waved, in a third
he was being fitted with a pair of
corsets. ... And then he remembered
and understood the sentence that the
magistrate had passed upon him, and
with a further shock he realised that
it still had six days to run. He stood
up and blasphemed. Instantly lights
were flashed from all parts of the
house, and upon his wild gesticulations
was turned the lens of a huge cinema-
tographic camera. He sought to cover
up his face, but rough hands . . . .
He awoke to find that a light was
actually being flashed in his eyes.
Fresh from his terror, and believing
his dream to have been real, he cried
out, “Don’t take me again ſº I'll give
you anything, but don't take me
again!” -
“I ain't come to take yer,” replied a
hoarse voice; “I’ve come to take yer
vallybles. Where j'er keep 'em 2"
“Then you're not the cinematograph
man? Thank Heaven | Take what
you like.” And from sheer relief he
fainted. - - * * * , • *
A few days later the Leading Actor
delivered his presidential address at
the annual meeting of the Stage Im-
provement Association. He chose as
his theme, “The Evils of Publicity,”
and afterwards gave interviews on the
subject to three newspaper representa-
tives. . .

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PRIVATE NOTE.
| MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I wonder if
you have ever guessed the real reason
of the matinée hat, or if, like the rest
of your silly sex, you think we wear
them from vanity, or just to spite you.
A glance at the Society columns of a
daily paper might give you the clue,
but to save you trouble I will put you
on the right track, though please
remember this is just between you and
| me and The Morning Post.
Has it never occurred to you that
there is a connection between the
growth of matinée hat-brims and the
matrimonial alliances of actresses
with the aristocracy? Can you not
sympathise with depressed débutantes
and their mammas, when their eligibles
are snapped up by footlight ladies 2
Do you wonder that we formed a
league for our protection, the object of
which was effectually to blanket the
stage and draw man's attention, willy
nilly, to ourselves? That is why
matinée hats are always huge, even
when passing fashion ordains tiny
toques for out-of-doors, and why, at
evening performances, coiffures are
dressed with plumes, bows and aigrettes,
not worn at home.
In spite of bitter and offensive oppo-
sition our League has carried on its
noble work with a persistence deservedly
crowned with success, for, though
there have been one or two set-backs,
it is a well-known fact that actresses
have taken to marrying actors again,
while there has lately been a notable
increase in Society weddings.
Yours sincerely,
BROAD BRIMMER.
SOME NEW DANCES.
As a result of the recent conference
of dancing-masters' delegates held in
London, a number of new and cha-
racteristic dances have been composed
by prominent musicians to meet the
special requirements of the moment.
Amongst these, special attention is
claimed by the following:—
The North Polka.-This charming
dance, which is peculiarly adapted
to the rigours of the British climate,
is dedicated to Admiral PEARY. Price,
with patent igloo complete, 4s.
The Russian Two - Steppe. — This
graceful dance, redolent of the charm
of the Don Cossacks, is sure to be ex-
ceedingly popular in view of the furore
created by the Muscovite ballerine at
the Hippodrome and other theatres.
Price, with balalaika, samovar, and two
bottles of the finest vodka, £3 3s.
The Barn Storm Dance.—This fan-
tastic and exhilarating measure, which

COME ABOARD OF ITSELF soon.”
recalls the Tempête, so popular in the
days of our grandparents, is admirably
adapted for theatrical fancy balls.
The Angel Cake Walk.-This ex-
quisite piece, written by the famous
composer, Mons. Cake Walkley, and
dedicated by him to Mlle. PAvLovA, is
probably the most palatable supper
dance in existence.
The Danse Microbe. —This extra-
ordinarily hygienic dance, written by
the Bulgarian prima donna, Madame
Milka Sauer-Massolette, is specially
recommended to all dyspeptic dancers.
“The Rev. F. H. Gillingham . . . made his
50 in an hour and 35 minutes with a fine square-
leg hit off Woolley, and at the same time sent
up the 100.”
Those muscular Christians!
More Injustice to Ireland.
“Compensation for malicious injuries by
county court judges at the last two quarter
sessions in Ireland amounted to £4,217.”
Pall Mall Gazette.
Surely this is going too far. Better
merely make jokes, as in England.
“Handsome sable and white Collie Dog, with
beautiful long fine head, good ears, eyes, level
mouth, lovely frill over distemper.”
Sidmouth Herald.
We fancy this kind of collie. It sounds
like a cutlet.
From an American magazine:–
“They were discussing Theodore Roosevelt—
three º Fnglishman, beef-red as to visage
and pink as to pate, as they ate their mutton
with great wedges of ‘bubble-and-squeak” and
drank their port wine in the comfortable dining-
room of the Club.”
A very vivid and life-like picture.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Intimate Society Letters of the Eighteenth Century
(STANLEY PAUL) are, appropriately enough, considering
their parentage and the country whence the majority of
them are dated, something in the way of a literary haggis.
They provide some fine confused feeding. ...The Editor,
the Duke of ARGYLL, is so intimately familiar with the
personality of his forbears that he forgets the hapless
Southron is not equally endowed with knowledge. Reading
the letters of successive Dukes, with here and there a Marquis
of Lorne and a whole clan of CAMPBELLs, one is not always
certain who is writing or being written of. This little
grumble uttered, there remains nothing but praise and thank-
fulness for the peep into the past opened up by these two
portly volumes. They form an invaluable adjunct to
the history of the social life of the eighteenth century. . In
August, 1773, we have Miss BURGoyNE writing from Kensing-
ton Palace telling how “Mrs. L. has been rob'd.” She was
going home between F-
one and two in the
morning when two
highwaymen stopped
her coach at Kensing-
ton Gore, presented
pistols at the head of
footman and coachman,
and cleared out the Lº
pockets of their mis- ºf
tress. “She was so ºf
excessively , frighten’d
that she has never
dared to come back
again at night and has
had a Bed constantly
at L. Spencer's.” Also,
“It is too true that
Miss P. lost in one
night £500 and the next gº
£1,500, and paid it all Nº
the next day.” On a
night in August, 1779,

with tender fingers, touched the buds upon the trees. A
million tiny blades of grass were piercing the tumid earth
awakened after the long, rejuvenating sleep of winter. In
every living thing the sap was flowing.” And here is
an example of something more actively disquieting :
“David's genius, if beguiled from higher to lower things,
would build upon shifting sand instead of solid rock . . .
David, in short, was afloat upon a high tide, with every
stitch of canvas set to a spanking breeze"; or, again:
“We behold him, like the weed on Lethe's wharf, ‘rotting
at ease ' on the Tom Tiddler's ground of a facile success.”
Nobody could possibly mistake this for literature; and the
treatment, however admirable, of a psychic problem which
no fellow can understand hardly compensates for such
defects in those matters of art that are within the com-
prehension of a reader of average intelligence. All the
same, the sincerity of Mr. WACHELL's purpose makes one a
little ashamed of criticising details of manner. Apart
from its speculative features, the book has inspiring quali-
ties, and makes for a healthy discontent with cheap or
vicious standards of social taste.
- (ſ - If, as I shrewdly sus-
pect, A Corn of Wheat
(HEINEMANN) is a first
novel, I beg to tender
my congratulations to
E. H. YoUNG upon a
literary début of very
considerable promise.
I do this the more sin-
cerely because, for the
story itself, apart from
the telling of it, I must
confess to a whole-
hearted dislike. Judith,
the heroine, was the
unmarried sister of the
Vicar of Mornington,
with whom she lived.
She was a lady of

at the Admiralty with
an account that the combined fleet of France and Spain
had blocked up Plymouth Harbour.” In February, 1803,
Lord JoHN CAMPBELL, making the grand tour, was pre-
sented to First CoNsul, “in his palace of the Thuillieries.”
Writing to his father, he gives a vivid picture of the great
man. These are plums picked at random. The reader
will find plenty more on the tree.
In The Other Side (NELsoN) Mr. HoRACE WAChELL has
attempted the difficult and unremunerative task of giving
the adventures of a soul that returns to a dead body. Of
the psychic value of his treatment of this problem I am
not competent to speak from personal experience. But I
am competent to guess that the effort of dealing with it
has exhausted too much of Mr. VACHELL’s virtue and that
the ordinary human part of the story has suffered from the
strain. Certainly, though a good enough story in itself, it
shows a curious lack of distinction both in language and
observation. For the most part the phraseology is fluently
commonplace, and only arrests attention by the strange-
ness of its occasional lapses from probability. Here is an
example of the obvious manner: “The sun had sunk be-
neath the horizon, but the glow still lingered. Spring,
ing over the fields at
day-break in a dressing-gown; her views on matrimony
also were, to say the least of it, original — and alto-
gether one feels that she must have been more than a
bit of a worry to the Vicar. I shall not repeat for you
Judith's subsequent career in detail (I am not sure that
I should quite like to do so); it is enough to say that
those who can overcome their distaste for certain incidents
in it will be rewarded by others that are told with quite
astonishing mastery and skill. For nature, E. H. YoUNG
has clearly the pen of an enthusiast; it might be said of
his story that in it every prospect pleases, and only Judith
is peculiar. I have, indeed, the feeling about her that she
is just one of those characters whom, in a book, one is
supposed to find original, stimulating, and attractive, but
who would be, in real life, detestable. My sympathies in
the case of Judith v. the Social Conventions have unfortu-
nately been roused for what the author clearly meant me
to consider the wrong side. But that doesn't make the
author's work any less clever.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TELEPIANO.
VIEws of LEADING PLANIsts.
ExPERIMENTs with the new Lepel
system of wireless telegraphy, by which
the transmission of the melody of
the National Anthem from Slough to
Brussels and Paris has been success-
fully carried out, are described in detail
in The Daily Mail.
We are in a position to state that
further developments of the wireless
octave have been triumphantly carried
out by the great firm of Blüthstein.
The opinions of some of the leading
Kings of the Keyboard on the new
“telepiano” will be read with interest.
Mr. MARK BAMBERGER, who was in-
terviewed by our representative on his
arrival in London from a protracted
tour extending from Sikkim to Tierra
del Fuego, expressed himself as an
uncompromising opponent of the new
system. “As an exemplification of the
influence of applied science on art,”
observed Mr. BAMBERGER, “the new in-
vention is not without interest. But
if it were extensively employed by
pianists the results would be disastrous.
Travel enriches the intellect and de-
| velops sympathy. Home-keeping artists
are apt to become insular, and even pa-
rochial, and the exclusive use of the
telepiano would undoubtedly tend to
root the virtuoso in one spot and pro-
mote a sedentary and immobile exist-
ence. Why should he go to Buenos
Ayres or the Klondyke, he will argue,
when all that is necessary is for him to
sit comfortably at home and discourse
| wireless music to expectant auditors at
the uttermost ends of the earth 2 I,
for one, could never bear to exchange
the life of the travelling virtuoso, so
richly fraught with adventure and
emotion, for this lethargic and hum-
drum existence. A man is not only a
better man, but an infinitely more ex-
hilarating performer, for having ex-
perienced a typhoon in the China seas,
witnessed a war dance of Amazons in
Dahomey, grappled single-handed with
a gang of Nihilists in Nijni-Novgorod,
or crossed the Grand Sahara on the
ship of the desert. Besides, it is not
enough for an audience to listen to the
tones of a piano. Unless the artist is
present before them, the performance
loses more than half its virtue. Capil-
lary attraction, gesture, play of facial
expression, costume—all are eliminated
by the telepiano.” Mrs. BAMBERGER,
who during the interview sat at the
feet of her illustrious husband on a
richly decorated Japanese footstool,
cordially endorsed his views.
M. PADEREwski, on the other hand,
professes himself a warm supporter of
the telepiano. He writes from Schloss
Manru, Poland, to say that it has
solved a problem which for long has
greatly exercised his mind—how to
give pleasure to the world without in-
curring the risk of being mobbed and
almost torn to pieces by his fanatical
admirers. “At my last recital at
Chicago,” writes M. PADEREwski,
“several tufts were forcibly removed
from my chevelure, the little finger of
my right hand was dislocated, and my
best butterfly tie torn from my neck.
This beneficent invention will hence-
forth enable me to continue my
pianistic career without danger to life,
limb and beauty.”
M. PACHMANN is even more bitterly
opposed to long distance wireless piano-
playing than Mr. BAMBERGER. “To
expect people to listen to a pianist
without seeing his face is the most
preposterous notion that ever emanated
from a lunatic asylum. It is like an
omelette without eggs. But what can
you expect from a firm with the name
of Blüthstein 2 You cannot get blood
from a stone.”
Finally, Madame Sophie MENTER
objects to the new system because
every auditor has to put on a hearing
cap, the effect of which is most un-
becoming.
MULL.
TELL me not of Grecian isles
And a charm that's olden,
Brooding on the turquoise blue
That the Argo's oar-banks knew,
Where a sun-steeped ease beguiles,
Far away, and golden
There's a Western isle I know,
Where the last land merges
In the grey and outer seas,
Southward from the Hebrides,
And through old sea-caverns go
Old Atlantic dirges!
Grey it is, and very still
In the August weather;
Grey the basking seals that flock
On their jaggéd lift of rock;
Starkly heaves a waste of hill
Grey, untouched of heather'
Grey streams go by cliff and hag,
Black their pools and quiet;
There the great grey sea-trout rise
Somewhat shortly at your flies
(If you want to make a bag,
Worm's their favourite diet).
That's the place where I would be,
Where the winds blow purely;
For I hear, by Fancy blest,
All the Fairies of the West
Sound their silver pipes for me—

yesterday. Unfortunately, however, in
descending her propeller was smashed.
It is expected now that she will not
reach The Daily Letter garage on Wan-

Wanstead Flats before quarter-day.
The Daily Letter has spared no ex-
pense in equipping its magnificent
garage, and thousands of people visit
it every day.
Desert (near Cairo), Mch. 31, 1911.
The “Demmit-Bayloud XII,” which
is to fly to The Daily Letter garage on
Wanstead Flats, met with an unfortu-
nate accident to-day, which may delay
her flight to The Daily Letter garage.
From causes which are at present
unknown, her envelope burst just as
she was settling down after a magnifi-
cent flight of two hundred yards.
As soon as the repairs are effected,
however, the airship will fly to The
Daily Letter garage on Wanstead Flats.

The airship“Demmit-Bayloud XII.,”
which is to fly from Cairo to The Daily

It has transpired that Smith has
erected stands on Wanstead Flats

It is possible that the flight of the

[AUGUST 17, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LORD OF LANGUAGE.
I HAVE had in my head for some
days the words “Scale and drop,” and
I cannot get them out. “Scale and
drop.” What do they convey to you,
reader? Nothing? Ah, that merely
shows that you are not a military
expert. If you were, you would realise
at once that an offensive operation was
going forward—assault and battery in
the making.
But I will tell you. I live in the
country, in a district that was recently
the theatre of war. Mimic war, it
is true, but earnest and serious, if
rather self-conscious, war, none the
less. Regiments marched up and down
our hill, not only by day, but by night.
Tired men in khaki, with the skin half
off their faces and wholly off their noses,
rested under our trees, consuming end-
less cigarettes and much chocolate, and
leaving the wrappers of both behind.
Yeomanry galloped over all the sur-
rounding fields, except where notices
said “Out of bounds.” Now and then
we were asked for water, not only for
men but for beasts. In short, we knew
something of what war meant.
And then at last, after days of silent
manoeuvres, came a battle with blank
cartridges, so close that our house
became a centre of headache. It was
in the midst of this engagement that
I walked out into the garden and stood
in the doorway leading to the orchard
to watch the fray. In fact we all did :
old and young, the whole household.
Now this orchard is surrounded by a
wall which in places may be four feet
high, but for the most part is three
feet high ; so insignificant that last
week a cow in the next meadow placed
her head against it, pushed a sufficient
gap through it, and was found con-
suming our fruit trees. I had since
then ceased to think of it as a wall at all:
merely a symbol of ownership, privacy.
Judge, then, of my amazement, and
indeed pride, when, all the blank cart-
ridges having been expended, the com-
mander issued to his men the sten-
torian order, “Scale and drop!”
While we were still glowing at the
employment of such noble words, the
whole troop, a few of them with a half
glance of confusion towards us, ran
simultaneously to the wall and got
over it. I knew they would. I knew that
scaling was as impossible as dropping.
It was a case of lifting the legs one
after the other; but the life-blood of
the army — not less the Territorials
than the Regulars—is precision, not
only of deed but word, and “getting
over walls '' is unknown there. Quite
right, too; and I applauded the officer
for his fidelity both to the spirit and
the letter. His command remains in
my mind an example of sublimity.
HOW A GREAT AUTHOR WORKS.
[“In wild surroundings man can but realise
himself to be a trivial part of the great whole,
while in the more formal environment of a
garden he is free to deal with questions which
arise from artistic creation.”—Daily Paper.]
I vowed (intrepid youth !) to go
Where Nature's wildest
arrayed
A soil which had not felt the hoe
Nor scraped acquaintance with the
spade.
There I determined I would dwell;
The Muse and I, with none to stop us,
Would hold communion for a spell
And perpetrate a magnum opus.
blooms
But mid the wondrous wildness came
The thought that man is very slight.
The world would go on just the same
Were I a maggot or a mite.
My work would mingle with the dust,
And what renown I gathered from it
Would be distinctly less robust
Than was the tail of Halley's comet.
Such candid self-communion brought
All hope of working to an end;
So I returned forthwith, and sought
A sympathetic lady friend,
Within whose trim-kept garden I
Told how, to morbid thoughts a
martyr,
I'd found the source of music dry
And Pegasus a rank non-starter.
And, just as she seemed like to melt
In tears at my unhappy state,
With thrills of ecstasy I felt
The artist's longing to create.
That garden struck a chord in me;
A flood of melody came rushing,
As when one deals the rubber tree
The blow that sets its sap a-gushing.
Of travelling I've had enough,
It tends to baulk the poet's aim ;
The sight of Nature in the rough
Makes man's affairs seem very tame.
But put me where the pansy grows,
And kindred blossoms even neater,
And, gazing on their ordered rows,
At once I mould my thoughts in
metre.
-:
“A mile out of Shrivnal a picked escort met
the women, making a gallant show of blue and
red and gold, the sunshine flashing on the regi-
mental colours, on sword-scabbards and steel
shoulder chains, on serried rows of medals lying
on gallant breasts.”—“ Daily Mirror” Serial.
They always do wear full-dress uniform
and carry colours on the North-West
Frontier of India. But why wasn't
the band playing?
or Fainting Aristocrats.
THE SEAMY SIDE OF HEROISM,
A CRISIS is suddenly come upon me.
I sit in my office in Lincoln's Inn
Fields, looking out from my window
upon it and wondering whether I am
going out to avert public disaster, or
am going to sit quietly within, pretend-
ing that I have not noticed anything,
When I set myself to dream of heroic
opportunities, I had my eye on Fires,
rownings, Riots, Wrecked Expresses
My offer to
Providence was that it should arrange
a mise-en-scène including one of the
above catastrophes and not omitting
a large and appreciative crowd of on-
lookers. There was to be a first-rate
disaster imminent, cowardice and panic
rampant, and nothing wanted but a
man to come along and do the manly
thing. I was to be that man. I was
to arrive, godlike, at the psychological
moment, save everybody and every-
thing from the worst, and then attempt
a modest retirement, which, I trusted,
would be prevented by the crowd,
frenzied with admiration. Publicity
and due reward, possibly even cash,
should be forced upon me then and
there, and a short, depreciatory speech
extracted from my unwilling lips.
Though I made known my preference
for a fire in a theatre, with myself
clambering on to the stage and thence
directing the safe exit of a panic-
stricken mob, I left the actual choice
of catastrophes to Providence, and this
is the best it can do.
For nearly an hour a private carriage
has stood by the curb, opposite the
door next to my own. There is no
one inside; there is no one on the box.
No one shows any sign of ownership,
interim possession or desire to control.
You say this is impossible. Why?
Cannot the coachman have had a
parcel to deliver on the top floor, and
quite unintentionally have fallen down
four flights of stairs? May it not be
that . . . Anyhow, there is the phe-
nomenon. A policeman has looked at
it, stroked the horse's head, wondered
what (if anything) he ought to do, and
gone his ways. An errand-boy on a
box-tricycle has enquired leisurely into
the matter. He has looked carefully
inside and on the box of the carriage.
He has started to ride away and has
returned to look underneath. Finding
nothing there, he has scratched his
head. He has scratched the horse's
head and looked up at the neighbour-
ing windows. With a little more head-
scratching, he too has gone his ways.
That was nearly half-an-hour ago,
and there the thing is, still unclaimed.
Yet you do not believe. I, who am
now watching it happen in the most

natural way in the world, begin to lose
patience, and so does the horse. After
a short prelude of restlessness, the ill-
used creature has decided that it will
wait no longer. An hour was just per-
missible; more it is unreasonable to
expect of an active horse. He moves
off at a slow walk. In a minute he will
be trotting into Kingsway; in three,
galloping driverless down Oxford Street.
He is only just starting, has in fact
stopped for a moment of his own
accord. Before he goes on again, I can
easily secure him and lead him back,
awkwardly, and unheroically, to his
proper place. I shall endeavour to
leave him and he will start off again.
So I shall have to stay there and hold
him until some owner does appear.
If any crowd gathers, it will only be to
ridicule a corpulent but eminently
respectable old gentleman with a bald
head, holding an apparently amused
horse inefficiently. When the owner
comes, will he shower praise and reward
upon me? Not he. At the best he
will give me twopence to get myself a
drink. At the worst he will ask me
what the something I am doing with
his horse, and will accuse me of theft
on an original and ambitious scale.
The horse, I tell you, has paused in
its progress, showing that its move-
ment was originally intended as a
practical protest, expected to bring the
driver quickly about his business. But
the driver not appearing, and the horse
having tasted the pleasure of indepen-
dent motion, the longer and fatal
journey is now contemplated. In a
word, the pause is ended and the horse
is walking off to do his worst. Ah,
well ! I suppose there is nothing for
it. I shall have to go.
Really, Providence, don't you know
the difference between a Hero and a
Busybody?

IT was not that I wished to go away,
To leave my tasks undone, and wander free;
My noble spirit chafed at the delay,
For work (whatever my detractors say)
Is meat and drink to me.
The joys of idleniss allured me not ;
Indeed, I felt considerable pain
At being torn, uprooted from the spot
Where I might work, and give full vent to what
I wildly call my brain.
I did but seek the somewhat flagging power
Of that tremendous engine to restore;
I said, I will be idle for an hour,
Give it, in fact, a kind of thorough scour,
That I may work the more.
It was in that fine hope that I took wing,
For that I laid my well-loved labours by:
And, faring forth, I grew the sunniest thing;
I was a figure of incarnate Spring;
None bonnier than I.
Where'er I moved I carolled like a lark;
On lake, on links, the music of my mirth
Became the theme of general remark;
Yet ever, tho' I strove to keep it dark
From men of lighter worth,
In mind I sought that fuller time ahead
When I should leave ignoble rest behind
And tackle that dear work for which I bled
(Being, Ifancy I've already said,
Blest with that sort of mind).
So the days passed. And so the glad dawn broke
That haled me to the labour of my Art.
With joy I came; with joy resumed the yoke;
And up till now I haven't done a stroke—
I cannot even start.

That deeply creaks in unaccustomed ruts
(A pretty figure'); struggles are in vain;
And, as for what I madly call my brain,
It doesn't work for nuts.

MARGATE AGAIN 1
“ENGLAND HAs A LARGE MARITIME PopULATION, of who M she is JUSTLY PROUD.”
AN UNCONVENTIONAL PICNIC.
Monks DoRMING, as my sister Lavinia and I often say,
has been simply a different place since Mrs. Rippentrop
came to live at Sunny Bank. She keeps us all alive—such
an energetic person, and so full of animal spirits and new
ideas for social enjoyment' So we were quite excited when
she called to ask us to join a picnic party she was getting
up on some plan she had seen in a daily paper and was
carrying out with additions of her own. “You really must
come, dear Miss Priscilla; it won't be complete without
you and Miss Miniver,” she said, in that pretty way of
hers. And, having no other engagement, we were of course
only too delighted to accept. All we were told was that
we were to send in such provisions as we liked to con-
tribute, the evening before, and meet on the appointed day
at Sunny Bank to receive further instructions.
When we arrived, the first thing we all had to do was
to dress ourselves up in various articles that we found
provided for us, exactly as if it was Charades. Colonel
Potter looked extremely quaint in a pink bath-gown and a
grey slouch hat with a blue woollen feather; as did Mr.
Dillwater, our new Curate, in Indian shawls and a lilac
sunbonnet—but both seemed just a teeny bit put out when
we learnt that the picnic was to take place in Balmyside
Woods, and that we were to drive there just as we were.
Indeed, if they had not both been such devoted admirers of
Mrs. Rippentrop, I almost doubt whether they would have
consented to come at all. But she had thoughtfully
engaged the station omnibus from the “Falcon,” so we
were comparatively unobserved.
We got out at the nearest gate to the wood, where
Mrs. Rippentrop made us all put on half-masks of black
paper before we went any further. Then we proceeded on
our way, and hadn't got far when we were challenged by
Mr. Wibberley, Miss Ingpen (who wrote a detective story
for our Parish Magazine, which the Rector said was
remarkably clever, but unsuitable), and Imogen Turk, with
her small brother Bobbie. They had gone on in advance,
and were supposed to be Scouts guarding the food, and,
before we could pass, we each had to make up a plausible
tale, and, if we escaped being recognised, the Scouts lost a
point. Colonel Potter's story was brief, and not very
plausible; Lavinia and I couldn't think of any story at all;
Mr. Stodgeleigh (who is writing an important book on the
History and Antiquities of Monks Dorming) told a very
good tale indeed, though he took rather a long time
over it. However, though we were so capitally disguised,
we were all recognised; so we should never have got to the
picnic at all if Mrs. Rippentrop hadn't persuaded them to
let us pass, in spite of the rules. When we reached the
picnicking ground another surprise was in store for us.
This was Mrs. Rippentrop's own idea. The Scouts had been
directed to hide the comestibles away in secret places, and
we had to hunt them all out before the meal could be
begun. To assist us in this Mr. Wibberley gave us a
cryptograph, with rows of little dancing men, which he had
imitated from a story of CoNAN Doyle's, and we all

puzzled over it for quite half-an-hour before we were com-
pelled to give it up. As it was already past two, the Scouts
were permitted by Mrs. Rippentrop to give us hints as to
the most likely spots. I must say the concealment had
been most ingeniously contrived.
For instance, Lavinia's meat patties and my own jam
puffs were so completely hidden under layers of bracken
that dear old Mrs. Thudichum only discovered them by
noticing the state her boots were in. And, although we
observed a cork with a tiny flag floating in a dear little
mossy pool, we had no idea, till we were told, that it marked
the spot where Colonel Potter's contribution—a lobster
salad—had been submerged in a tin fish-can. The water
kept the lobster beautifully cool, but unfortunately some
rotifers and other pond-dwellers had gained admittance
through the holes in the top of the tin, so we thought it
more prudent, on the whole, not to partake of the lobster
hiding an article in the most conspicuous place from a tale
of EDGAR ALLAN PoE's. Nothing could have been more
successful, but Mr. Stodgeleigh, for so great a philosopher
as he is, all but lost his temper over it.
The bus was to have met us at five o'clock, but we were
considerably behind our time, and as it had to go back to
the station for the 6.15, we returned on foot. Colonel
Potter was a little peevish at having to walk through the
village in his disguise, and Mr. Dillwater openly dreaded
lest he should encounter his Rector—which I regret to say
he did. But there are never many persons about in Monks
Dorming, and those we did meet made but few comments on
our costumes. Altogether, as I said to dear little Mrs.
Rippentrop, we were indebted to her for a most successful
and delightful expedition. Still, somehow or other, she
has not seen quite so much as she used to of either
salad.
We then had a great search
for a couple of cold chickens
which Mr. Dillwater said should
be somewhere about, and Mr.
Wibberley advised us to try the
bank of a charming rivulet close
by—and sure enough, there were
the chickens! They would have
been welcomed, as we were
getting really hungry by this
time, but some animal—Mr.
Stodgeleigh thought a water-rat
—had evidently found them be-
fore us, so we went without
them, which I fancy was rather
a disappointment to poor Mr.
Dillwater. In compassion for
our feelings Imogen Turk then
informed us where she had
concealed a cold tongue. We
should certainly never have
found it out for ourselves, as
the dear child had dropped it
into a hollow tree, from which,
though we tried for at least
twenty minutes, it proved im-
possible to extract it. And the
currant and raspberry tart—
well, I must say that whoever
secreted it in the undergrowth

INSURANCE FO3 CRICKETERS.
The Daily Chronicle having
announced the completion of its
scheme for the insurance of
footballers, Mr. Punch begs to
state that he also has made
arrangements of a somewhat
similar nature for the insurance
of cricketers. The Chronicle's
project insures against accident,
fatal or otherwise. Cricketers,
however, are less liable to death
than dishonour, and to injured
limbs than to injured feelings.
Mr. Punch's efforts are therefore
directed to compensation for
spiritual rather than bodily hurt.

was ill-advised in putting it so
near an ant's nest. Indeed, matters had reached such a
pitch that I really thought it wiser, after coming upon
Mrs. Thudichum's calves-foot jelly in the midst of a bed
of rushes, to refrain from mentioning that, when I first
saw it, a large speckly frog was seated panting on the top.
Luckily, there had not been time to think of a really
clever hiding-place for the ham, and we found some bread
and a jam-pot full of butter down a rabbit-hole, and not so
very sandy considering, so with these and the jelly (which
I did not touch myself) we managed to satisfy our appe-
tites. There was not much to drink, because we only
exhumed one bottle of claret and another of milk, poor
little Bobbie being unable to remember where he had
buried the others—or the tumblers. Still, paper funnels
make quite passable substitutes for drinking-glasses, and
after all, as Mrs. Rippentrop brightly observed, half the fun
of a picnic consists in these little contretemps.
It was perhaps a pity that Miss Ingpen did not recollect
until we had all done that there was a large pigeon pie
perched in the fork of a tree directly over our heads. She

A TU BE PROPOSAL.
I HAD been expecting the proposal
for weeks, so often had he been on the
verge and so often had I tactfully
piloted him back to safe ground again,
but when he ran me to earth, so to
speak, in the Tube, and led me stag-
geringly down the train to the dim and
deserted far end, I set my teeth grimly
for I knew I was in for it. He is quite
a nice boy and the juvenile lead of our
*Amateur Dramatic Society; but, though
my heart may not be another's, it is
certainly not his.
He began at once, fixing his pas-
sionate eyes on mine, and speaking
in a voice of emotional entreaty. I
was heartily sorry for him, for the
Tube is an awful place to propose in ;
the roar and rattle drowned his best
points, and I only caught a few words
here and there, such as-“Katharine "
(he was too moved to call me “Kitty”),
“carry you by storm,” “wife,” “win
you in the end.” Then he came to a full
stop and, seizing my hand, he faltered—
“Will you—oh, do say you will !”
“I wish I could,” I sighed, giving
his hand a sisterly little squeeze before
I withdrew mine, “but it's impossible.”
As I spoke the noise and clatter were
worse than ever, and, to my horror and
annoyance, I saw, from the sudden
rapture in his face, that he had mis-
understood me, and, probably only
catching my first words, had mistaken
“I wish ’’ for “I will.”
His joy was so frank that for the
first moment I simply hadn't the heart
to undeceive him ; the next, the train
slowed up at our station, and we were
| obliged to perform a combined cake-
walk down the oscillating compart-
ment. I had no opportunity to correct
his illusion on the platform or in the
crowded liſt, and I waited till we got
outside, when he at once began gaily—
“You don't know how horribly
nervous I felt before I asked, but I
feel I can face any music now I am
sure of you.”
“I’m dreadfully sorry,” I said bravely,
“but there's been a mistake. You
thought I said 'Yes' in the Tube, didn't
you?” He nodded and looked down
quickly and apprehensively in my face.
“Well, as a matter of fact, I said
‘No,'” I answered as gently as I could.
He turned very pale and did not speak
for a few moments. Then he demanded
in a hard voice—
“Why not? Are you engaged 2"
I shook my head and averted my
eyes.
“Then why won't you?” .
“Because I don't want to,” I blurted
out, feeling truth was best.
There was a long pause.
“Oh, very well,” he said quietly,
“then I shall ask Cynthia Platt.”
I own I was a little shocked at this;
not piqued, but a little shocked. How-
ever, I exclaimed heartily, “That's
very sensible of you. She's heaps
better than I am.”
“Well,” he replied in a meditative
voice, “of course she's taller and she's
good-looking. But she’s a bit too
strong; she's got such a magnificent
physique, you know.”
“Why, surely that's all the better,”
I said.
“Oh, no,” he replied. “You’re a
much more suitable size for me to chase
round with a whip.”
I gasped, and he smiled a little sadly
at my expression.
“Oh, you needn't look alarmed,”
he said; “I shouldn't have-actually
touched you with it; my idea was just
to rattle you along and crack it behind
ou.”
“Well,” I said, “if that's your idea
of domestic happiness I consider it 's
an insult for you to have asked me to
marry you.” -
He pulled up short and stared at me.
“I never asked you to marry me,”
he exclaimed. -
“What l” I cried.

“Never,” he said emphatically. “I
told you they had cast me for Petruchio
in The Taming of the Shrew, and I
asked you to be Katharine, my wife in
the play, don't you know.”
I didn't speak; I couldn't ; it was
all I could do to choke back my tears
of mortification, and we walked in a
horrible embarrassed silence till I
reached my gate. Then I glanced up
and saw that his face wore a mingled
expression of nervousness, amusement,
and pity.
“I’m awfully sorry,” he stammered,
“but that beastly Tube makes such a
row, no wonder—” . .
“Yes, doesn't it,” I said quickly;
“my mistake was almost excusable.
And in any case,” I added over my
shoulder as I went in, “you won't
forget I said 'No,' will you?”

UNEXPECTED ATHLETES.
ENCOURAGED by the stimulating ex- |
ample of Lord KITCHENER, several
other eminent public men have decided
to enter the athletic arena.
Lord FISHER, O.M., played his first
game of golf at Sheringham on Friday
last. The results were decidedly pro-
mising, though the gallant admiral occa-
sionally gave vent to such marine
exclamations as “Avast there !” on
missing the globe. At the eighth hole,
where he took a full swing with his
Dreadnought driver, Lord Fisher hit
the roof of the Lifeboat Station such a
prodigious ponk that the ball flew off
into the North Sea and was never seen
again. At the tenth, Lord FishBR ran
down a 6 in. putt in fine style, and at
the thirteenth he cleverly sliced his
drive into the tee-box, a thing which
has never been done before... Johnny
WALKER, who coached the illustrious
neophyte, expressed keen satisfaction
with his pupil's progress. “Man,” he
exclaimed on one occasion, “yon's the
biggest divot I ever saw.”
Lord RosBBERY's unexpected appear-
ance at the Highland Games at Strath-
peffer has been quite the event of the
week in Scotland. His lordship entered
for several events, and carried off the
veterans' 100 yards' handicap from the
30-yard mark in the fine time of
24 seconds. Lord Rosebery was also
honourably mentioned in the egg and
spoon race. -
The announcement that Sir OLIVER
LoDGE would take part in a game of
water polo in the Edgbaston Baths
attracted a large and influential crowd
to that fashionable resort on Saturday
afternoon. The illustrious savant, who
was tastefully clad in plum-coloured
satinette, presented a truly noble ap-
pearance on plunging into the bath,
and was the life and soul of the game.
Playing centre wing forward with extra-
ordinary gusto, Sir OLIVER again and
again foiled the attack of the opposing
scrimmagers. One magnificent run
along the bottom of the bath aroused
such enthusiasm that Mr. RAYMOND
BLATHwayt, though fully dressed in
the height of the fashion, leapt into the
liquid and was with difficulty rescued
from a watery grave. Mr. HAROLD
BEGBIE was reduced to tears of ecstasy,
and Mr. BRAM StokeR, who was re-
porting the match for P. A. P., broke
into paeans of delight. As he put it in
one happy phrase, “Since the days of
Roncesvalles there has never been such
an OLIVER as ours.” At the close the
aquatic hero was earried home shoulder
high, preceded by the drum and fife
band of the Edgbaston Telepathic
Scouts. . . - --

THE great Australian liner with the
eminent Paragraph on board was
already overdue as I stood waiting.
Many well-known Pars were on the
quay to meet their confrère.
The GLADSTONE twenty - six bites
mastication story was standing next
to an iron-haired anecdote about
DisrAELI's first speech, while two dis-
tinguished Pars who had, I found,
both seen the light years ago in
P. U.P., stood and recalled old times.
They had not met for years. The one
about Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL's
resignation had gone out to South
Africa at the time of the appointment
of his son, Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL,
to be Under-Secretary to the Colonies,
and had returned when he went to the
Board of Trade. The other, about
BoyLE Roche's rat that was nipped
in the bud, had only just concluded a
tour of Japan and the Far East. At
this moment the great ship hove in
sight, and in a few minutes, amidst
loud cheers, the venerable Par came
ashore. I succeeded in getting a few
words.
“You have been round the world 2 ”
I asked.
“Completely,” answered the genial
old anecdote. “I have appeared in
550 newspapers, magazines and re-
views. When I came out in The
Honolulu Weekly Whisper the paper
went out of print. I leave again to-
morrow by the thin paper edition of
Glad Bits, en route for Chicago and the
Far West, where I have a round of
engagements booked. You mustn't keep
me any longer. Pip! Pip !”
“Pip ! Pip !” I responded; “see you
in Glad Bits to-morrow !”
“I recall a remarkable incident in that
innings very early on. A ball—bowled, if my
memory serves, by Mr. F. S. Jackson—beat Mr.
Spooner, and struck his leg stump so hard that
it travelled to the boundary—yet the bails were
undisturbed.”—“Old Ebor ’’ in “The Yorks.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Of the many novelists who can write with a semblance
of extreme accuracy about a period which they never saw,
most, I think, make the mistake of importing a far too
modern conception of romantic sentiment into the hearts
of their heroes and heroines. Mr. Ford MADox HUEFFER
has no use for this sort of thing: he feels, I suppose, that
a time of artificial graces and studied manners exercised a
constricting influence over the emotions of the people who
lived in it. Thus, if you expect to find in the two principal
figures of The Portrait (METHUEN), who flourished in the
early part of the eighteenth century, a Victorian attitude
of mind, you will be grievously disappointed. For myself
I was more than pleased. Squire Bettesworth, of Winter-
bourne, Wilts, took a rash bet (amounting to £20,000) with
So they married—and I resist the temptation to wonder
whether Eric ever thought wistfully about the silent past.
The novel, of which this is the plot, is called Kilmeny of
the Qrchard (PITMAN). Although this kind of thing may
make, indeed frequently has made, an acceptable short
story, the allowance is rather.small for a complete six-
shilling volume. The author, L. M. Montgomery, seems
to have said, “Hang it all, they want another novel by
me, so, as this is all there is in the house at present, it
will just have to go round !” I am a little sorry for this,
since earlier work by the same hand was evidently of
better quality. Kilmeny of the Orchard, even enriched by
four quite charming illustrations in colour, strikes me as
not altogether fair value for the price.
I want to express such an opinion of The Brassbounder

rather humbled in the
process. The minute-

it is no perfume at all. But with perfume or the lack of

this, sure, is quarrel enough for any gallant man.” Like
the Earl of Pembroke, who was present, I cordially agree.
Eric Marshall fell in love with a girl whom he had
heard playing the violin in an orchard. She was unfortu-
nately dumb, not through any vocal defect, but because
her deceased mother had refused to talk for many years,
and had been appropriately punished by the birth of a speech-
less daughter. The probability of this seems to me a little
dubious; but no matter. Kilmeny used to meet Eric in
the orchard pretty often ; till, one evening, a former suitor,
being naturally irritated at the affair, came behind Eric
with his little hatchet, and proposed to end things abruptly.
Kilmeny, however, saw his approach, and, recovering what
her mother had lost, spoke and warned her favoured lover.

There are illustrations by the author–careful, suggestive

these are very good indeed. -

following question was put :—“Explain
the context of the passage: “This
would never have happened if Oliver
had been alive.” One answer was as
follows:–" This was said when they
dug up the body of Oliver Cromwell
after the Restoration.”
The electric ventilating fan on the
wall of the restaurant was whizzing
round. A gentleman who had dined
extremely well sat looking at it for
some time. “Waiter,” he complained
at last, “that clock's fast !”
A contemporary publishes an article
on “Curious Collections.” Some per-
sons are very eccentric in this respect.
We know a man who collects rates.
Seaside Pierrots are indignantly
denying the charge that the ditties they
sing are unfit for children to hear. We
must confess that our experience is that
most of their songs are just about suit-
able for babes.
A safe remedy for want of sleep,”
says a medical journal, “is the eating
of onions.” We should have thought
the noise of the smell would have kept
one awake.

THE Two HolidAYS.
“Look here, upon this picture, and on this."—Hamlet.
[Mr. Lloyd GEORGE, who is responsible for the complicated inquisi-
tion on Land Values which is now ruining our holidays, is off, according
to The Daily Chronicle, on a motor trip through Germany, Switzerland,
and Italy, and will not return till the second week in September, when
he proposes to assist at the Welsh Eisteddfod. By another report, golf
is the main objective of his Continental tour.]
So you are off to see the sights,
To taste an unofficial beano
Full of the keen and pure delights
Which none but those with conscience free know ;
And Heaven, you hope, is sure
To bless your German-Swiss-Italian tour !
And yet that pilgrimage must be
Funereal in its opening section,
For it will hurt your heart to see
A people ravaged by Protection,
Who live on underdone
Horses and dachshunds; this should spoil your fun.
IIere it were well to go incog.,
Lest in those Tariff-ridden regions
The well-fed working-man should dog
Your wheels and cry in lusty legions,
“Potz-tausend Teufel ! That's
The man that says we live on food for cats!”
But, once in Switzerland, you'll drop
Blond wig and alias; soon your road 'll
Take you to where on Rigi's kop
The Fatherlander yearns to yodel,
And you will bare your scalp
To all the winds that wash that noted Alp.
From German trippers swilling beer
In streams that nothing ever staunches
Southward you'll fly in full career
(Eluding latent avalanches),
And find—the same old story—
More Germans swilling beer all round Maggiore.
Go where you will you're on their trace;
They Teutonise from Spain to Turkey—
This Tariff-busted pauper race,
Incorrigibly fat and perky,
The recognised invaders. - -
Of scenes once sacred to the best Free-Traders.
Be not on their account depressed;
They know which side their black bread's buttered;
But, since your joys might gain in zest
If Pity 'neath your waistcoat fluttered,
Please be a little sad
For us in England. We are going mad.
We, too, had hoped to take our ease
In spots renowned for natural beauties,
But have, instead, to grind at these
Condemnable Land-Value-Duties;
Yes, while you romp about
We've got to work your silly puzzles out.
By flowery routes you lightly bound,
But we, our holidays all rotted,
Await a fine of fifty pound
In case the answers can't be spotted;
And how to find the clue
We have no notion any more than you.
Within a space of thirty days -
(In this the month for gathering roses)
We've got to solve the sinuous maze
Or pay your minions through our noses;
While you at your sweet will
Go round and gambol with a rubber pill.
Well, pluck the hour; enjoy your jaunts;
Leave to its day the curse that's coming;
But, when you reach your native haunts
In time to hear the Druids humming,
Beware the ways of men,
For we shall all be gibbering mad by then. O. S.

He. It's quite true.
She. I know it is. I can see you with the naked eye.
He. I mean it's quite true about dining with Harry
Talbot. -
She. Then why aren't you dining with him?
He. Fact is, poor old Harry got a very sudden tele-
rann
g She. It 's a way telegrams have.
He. Well, this one was more sudden than most. It said
that Harry's uncle had broken his leg in two places, and
as he's eighty they think it pretty serious, and Harry had
to dash off to London to get away North to-night. So I
came back.
She. I'm sorry for Harry Talbot, and I'm sorrier for
his old uncle, but I’m sorriest for you.
He. Oh, come, I say, I'm all right. Instead of dining
out I shall dine at home.
She. Dine ! -
He. Yes, dine. , You don't seem overwhelmed with joy
at gettin me back.
She. Yes, I am—simply crushed. But what do you
think you'd like for dinner?
He. Oh, anything. Let's dine quite simply. Soup and
a bit of fish; a cutlet with some peas, and a tart, or some
jelly. I don't care what it is.

dress clothes.

The American “Comedian.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-One would have thought that the
theory of a “Britisher's" slowness at seeing a joke was
too old and discredited a wheeze even for an American
humorist. Yet the other night I was at the Palace Theatre
and was compelled, between two entertaining turns, to
listen to a gentleman, calling himself an “American Tramp
Comedian,” who smiled patiently at what he took to be the
thick-headedness of his audience, and told them to “take
their time.” Well, most of his jokes, which were largely
concerned with that vulgar and depressing theme, the fat
woman, appeared to me to be as palpable as a porpoise
(I missed one allusion, but that, I find, was through innocence
and not dulness); but very few of them seemed worth
troubling to laugh at. Idare say that his New York audiences
grin readily enough at this kind of thing; but then I do not
pretend to share their tastes. I recommend this Comedian
to return to the place where he gets the most spontaneous
appreciation. Yours faithfully, FRONT Row.

- PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 24, 1910.
HOLIDAY TIME.
I.—THE ORDEAL BY WATER.
“WE will now bathe,” said a voice
at the back of my neck.
I gave a grunt and went on with
my dream. It was a jolly dream, and
nobody got up early in it.
“We will now bathe,” repeated
Archie.
“Go away,” I said distinctly.
Archie sat down on my knees and
put his damp towel on my face.
“When my wife and I took this
commodious residence for six weeks,”
he said, “and engaged the sea at great
expense to come up to its doors twice
a day, it was on the distinct under-
standing that our guests should plunge
into it punctually at seven o'clock
every morning.”
“Don’t be silly, it's about three
now. And I wish you'd get off my
knees.”
“It's a quarter-past seven.”
“Then there you are, we've missed
it. Well, we must see what we can
do for you to-morrow. Good night.”
Aichie pulled all the clothes off me
and walked with them to the window.
“Jove, what a day!” he said. “And
can't you smell the sea?”
“I can. Let that suffice. I say,
what's happened to my blanket? I
must have swallowed it in my sleep.”
“Where's his sponge?” I heard him
murmuring to himself as he came away
from the window.
“No, no, I'm up,” I shouted, and I
sprang out of bed and put on a shirt
and a pair of trousers with great speed.
“Where do I take these off again 2"
I asked. “I seem to be giving myself
a lot of trouble.”
“There is a tent.” -
“Won't the ladies want it? Because
if so I can easily have my bathe later
on.”
“The ladies think it's rather too
rough to-day.” -
“Perhaps they're right,” I said hope-
fully. “A woman's instinct— No,
I'm not a coward.”
It wasn't so bad outside—sun and
wind and a blue-and-white sky and
plenty of movement on the sea.
“Just the day for a swim,” said
Archie cheerily, as he led the way down
to the beach.
“I've nothing against the day; it's
the hour I object to. The Lancet says
you mustn't bathe within an hour of a
heavy meal. Well, I'm going to have
a very heavy meal within about twenty
minutes. That isn't right, you know.”
By the time I was ready, the wind
had got much colder. I looked out of
the tent and shivered.
“Isn't it jolly and fresh 7" said
Archie, determined to be helpful.
“There are points about the early
morning, after all.”
“There are plenty of points about
this morning. Where do they get all
the sharp stones from ? Look at that
one there—he's simply waiting for
me.” -
“You ought to have bought some
bathing shoes. I got this pair in the
village.”
“Why didn't you tell me so last
night?”
“It was too late last night.”
“Well, it's much too early this
morning. If you were a gentleman
you'd lend me one of yours, and we'd
hop down together.”
Å. being no gentleman, he
walked and I hobbled to the edge, and
there we sat down while he took off
his shoes.
“I should like to take this last
opportunity,” I said, “of telling you
that up till now I haven't enjoyed this
early morning bathe one little bit. I
suppose there will be a notable moment
when the ecstasy actually begins, but
at present I can't see it coming at all.
The only thing I look forward to with
any pleasure is the telling Dahlia and
Myra at breakfast what I think of
their cowardice. That and the break-
fast itself. Good-bye.”
I got up and waded into the surf.
“One last word,” I said as I looked
back at him. “In my whole career I
shall never know a more absolutely
beastly and miserable moment than
this.” Then a wave knocked me down,
and I saw that I had spoken to
hastily. -
The world may be divided into two
classes—those who drink when they
swim and those who don't. I am one
of the drinkers. For this reason I
prefer river bathing to sea bathing.
“It’s about time we came out,” I
shouted to Archie after the third pint.
“I’m exceeding my allowance.”
“Aren't you glad now you came?”
he cried from the top of a wave.
“Very,” I said from inside it.
But I really did feel glad ten minutes
later, as I sat on the beach in the sun
and smoked a cigarette, and threw
pebbles lazily into the sea.
“Holbein, how brave of you!” cried
a voice behind me.
“Good morning. I'm not at all sure
that I ought to speak to you.”
“Have you really been taking the sea
so early,” said Myra as she sat down
between us, “ or did you rumple each
other's hair so as to deceive me?”
“I have been taking the sea,” I
confessed. “What you observe out
there now is what I left.”
“Oh, but that 's what I do. That's
why I didn't come to-day—because
I had so much yesterday.” -
“I’m a three-bottle man. I can go
on and on and on. And after all these
years I have the most sensitive palate
of any man living. For instance, I can
distinguish between Scarborough and
Llandudno quite easily with my eyes
shut. Speaking as an expert, I may
say that there is nothing to beat a
small Cromer and seltzer; though some
prefer a Ventnor and dash. Ilfracombe ||
with a slice of lemon is popular, but
hardly appeals to the fastidious.”
“Do you know,” said Archie, “that ||
you are talking drivel? Nobody ought
to drivel before breakfast. It isn't
decent. What does Dahlia want to do
to-day, Myra 2"
“Mr. Simpson is coming by the one-
thilty.”
“Good; then we'll have a slack day.
The strain of meeting Simpson will be
sufficient for us. I do hope he comes
in a yachting cap—we'll send him back
if he doesn't.”
“I told him to bring one,” said Myra.
“I put a P.S. in Dahlia's letter—please
bring your telescope and yachting cap.
She thought we could have a good
day's sailing to-morrow, if you'd kindly
arrange about the wind.”
“I’ll talk to the crew about it and
see what he can do. If we get be-
calmed we can always throw Simpson
overboard, of course. Well, I must go
in and finish my toilet.”
We got up and climbed slowly back
to the house.
“And then,” I said, “then for the
heavy meal.” A. A. M.
The Untimely Bag.
“Cruel was the hand and murd’rous eye
That glanced the rifle stem.”
So says the author of “The Twelfth :
Ode to a Dying Partridge” in the
Dunfermline Press, and he ought to
know.
“You may think that your own car is doing
very well, for example, if it does 46 miles an
hour maximum speed on the flat, yet, without
changing anything, even in the way of the
gears, a skilled tuner-up would be . to get
anything up to ten miles an hour out of it if he
had it at Brooklands."—The Observer.
The offer leaves us cold.
“In the ‘Atlantic' appears an unpublished
poem by Thackeray which has lately been dis-
covered by Mrs. Anna Thackeray Ritchie. It
is a nearly perfect rendering of Beranger's
famous verses:
Advertise in ‘The Bulletin' if you want
boarders or roomers.”—Philadelphia Evening
Bulletin.
Not even THAcKERAY could ever get
the lilt of these two famous opening
lines of BERANGER's.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 24, 1910. ,
RAILWAY AMENITIES.
Out of an enormous quantity of
luminous letters that have reached us
dealing with this burning question we
select the following:— -
BATHs on THE UNDERGROUND.
SIR,-The suggestions for promoting
the amenities of travelling that have
appeared in The Times seem to be
lamentably wanting in actuality. So far
as I have seen no one has yet ventured
to propose a reform which would meet
a crying want—I mean the installation
of a swimming bath on every train on
the underground. If this were done,
instead of arriving at his destination in
a grimy and dusty condition, the
passenger would emerge, like Venus
Anadyomené, in a state of sleek and
radiant bloom. -
I am, yours faithfully, K. C. B.
CoRRIDOR CRICKET.
SIR,-Cricket on board ship has
proved an admirable means of speeding
the passage of the slow hours. Surely
it should be possible to have a pitch in
every corridor carriage. To avoid mis-
haps netting should of course be rigged
up and passengers only allowed to
leavé their compartments when over
was called. Another excellent idea
that occurs to me is the establishment
of winter gardens on the roof of the
carriages, where the passengers might
enjoy the air amid gay parterres,
fountains, clumps of rhododendrons
and other horticultural delights.
Yours obediently, ToPIAR1st.
THE WAIL of A VEGETARIAN.
SIR, -The staff of our railways,
excellent in many ways, admits of
enlargement in a variety of directions.
There is one train on which a nurse is
always in attendance, but I am not
aware of any system which provides
the services of a barber, a conjurer, a
professional palmist, or a crystal gazer.
Another point, which touches me
keenly, is the inadequacy of railway
cuisine. I have been a vegetarian
from infancy, but have never seen a
nut cutlet in the menu of the best of
our restaurant cars.
I am, Sir, yours respectfully,
CASPAR Worple,
President of the Twickenham
Isosceles League.
How To BRIGHTEN our TUNNELs.
SIR, - Until aerial locomotion be-
comes universal we shall never be able
to dispense with tunnels, and tunnels
to persons of a nervous temperament
are always a source of apprehension
and alarm. But this discomfort could
|
be greatly alleviated if a photographic
camera were installed in every com-
partment for the purpose of taking
flashlight pictures during the passage
of the train through all long tunnels.
It should thus be possible for passen-
gers at the end of their journey to
- acquire albums of their fellow-travellers,
and so to imprint on the tablets of
memory agreeable impressions which
might otherwise lapse into the limbo
of oblivion. Yours faithfully,
MARMADUKE Poddle.
* TRAIN BANDs.
SIR,-We live in a musical age; we
boast of our orchestral concerts, our
various operatic companies, the Young
British School, and so forth. Yet
nothing has been done to enliven the
monotony of railway travelling by pro-
viding concerts of classical and roman-
tic music on board our trains. Imagine
the pleasure of listening to Elektra on
an electric railway, or BERLIoz's “De-
scent to the Abyss" (from his Faust)
while racing down Shap Fell ! I com-
mend the idea to the energetic and
enterprising Mr. BEECHAM.
Yours faithfully,
PAGANINI Junior.
AIDs To SLUMBER.
SIR,--I have only two suggestions to
offer for the improvement of railway
travelling, but they are of vital im-
portance. Pillows are already provided,
but their soporific quality would be
greatly enhanced if they were stuffed
with hops. Again, travelling on Sunday
would be rendered far more decorous
if volumes of sermons were provided in
each compartment. I feel sure, also,
that if organs were placed in trains,
Mr. CARNEGIE would bear half the cost
of this amenity. Yours faithfully,
AMANDA PINKERTON.
“It is not every day that a vessel is launched
at Troon on a Friday."—Local /*per.
That's where Troon's luck comes in ;
they don't have seven unlucky days
per week.
“Alfred Williams said he was a spectator of
the trouble. He saw Ah Shack, one of the
accused, hit Ah Saw in the eye with a knuckle-
duster.”—Daily Mail.
With a name like that, AH SAw was
simply asking for it.
Ménage à Trois.
“Bachelor (42), moderate position, desirous
of residing in country, Wishes to Meet with a
Domesticated Lady, similarly disposed, 28-35,
view to Matrimony ; sound health and amiable
disposition essential ; farmer's daughter would
be entertained.”—Advt. in “Birminghaun Daily
Post.”
“THE CHILD is FATHER OF THE MAN."
“Maxima debetur pueris reverentia.” . .
DEAR Mr. PUNCH, - I'm only a
schoolboy, but I hope you’ll read what
I'm going to tell you about the Pater
and Mater, because I'm sure you'll
sympathise; of course, if I was the
only chap that ever saw it, it would be
all right, but sometimes the servants
do too, and other people who are
here, so I just thought I'd write
to you. - t
First of all, when Mater comes down
to breakfast, she creeps in on tiptoe and
kisses Pater on the forehead ; Pater's
always down early to read his letters,
and he's beginning to go quite bald
now except round his neck and the
back of his ears, where the Mater never
kisses him, and Mater says, “Good
morning, darling; ” and it's so silly,
because she's had lots of time to say
everything upstairs. It's just as bad
at lunch too; only it's Pater generally
that kisses Mater's forehead then, and
when she puts her hand on the table-
cloth Pater puts his on the top of it; and
I think it's simply rotten, don't you ?
This has been going on ever since
I can remember; but the awful part
was when Smith Maximus came to
stay with me a few days ago. Smith
Max. is nearly two years older than
me, and much higher up, but we're
quite chummy, and he's very sweet
on my sister Sibyl. I knew some-
thing awful would happen because on
the very first day of his visit Pater
and Mater were much worse than
usual. I frowned hard at Pater to try
to remind him that Smith Max. was
looking, but Pater just told me not to
pull faces, with that stale old joke
about what would happen if the wind
changed, so I just had to sit there and
bear it all through lunch. In the
afternoon, we had tea in the garden and
when Mater began pouring out she
found there was a cup short, so Smith
Max., who's awfully polite, offered to
go indoors and ring the bell; but Father
said it would be all right and no need
to bother as he 'd drink out of Mater's
cup when she'd done with it.
I didn't dare to look at Smith Max.,
but I know what he must have
thought, and I've never felt so blushy
and ashamed in all my life. Of
course I apologised for them to Smith
Max. afterwards, and he was awfully
nice about it, and quoted some poetry
about how much better it would be
if we could only see ourselves as
others see us, but I just couldn't stand
it any longer, so I went off to the Pater
and told him straight out. Pater roared
with laughter and called the Mater, and
she laughed too and kissed me, though

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I told them I didn't see anything funny
about it as Smith Max. is in the Upper
Fifth, but that only made them laugh
all the more.
I think you'll see how awkward it
is for me, as I simply can't ask any
chaps down to stay with me ; and I
don't know what Smith Max. will say
about Pater and Mater when we get
back to School next term. I wonder if
you could write to the Pater about it
and explain, or perhaps you could put
something in Punch next week, as
Pater always reads Punch, and he'd
be sure to see it. Hoping you will be
able to do something,
Yours truly,
(Later.)
It's all right about Smith Max., as I
caught him just now in the pantry with
Sibyl eating honey out of the same
spoon, but I still want you to put some-
thing in Punch to stop the Pater in case
| I want to ask any other chaps who
aren't spoony with Sibyl to come and
stay here. Yours truly, T. B.

CRICKET NOTES.
THE following account of a meeting
reported to have been held at the Albert
Hall by delegates from the non-cham-
pion counties has been forwarded to
us –
Sir A. HAZLERigg (Leicestershire),
having taken the chair, said that the
time had come for the non-champion
counties to make a stand (Laughter—
easily quenched) so that they might
become champions. The only fair
system was that losses should be
ignored, draws be disregarded, and no
attention paid to wins. By such means
all the counties would be placed on an
equality. (Cheers, in which the repre-
sentatives of Glamorgan loudly partici-
pated.)
Mr. SAMUEL Woods (Somersetshire)
announced that any batsman over forty
years of age ought to start at least
twenty runs up. Unless this was done
the control of the game would fall into
the hands of babes and ducklings.
Mr. P. F. WARNER (Greater Britain)
said that on all matters connected with
cricket he thought Imperially.
Mr. H. S. Goodwin (Warwickshire)
stated that this was a democratic age.
He was all in favour of one man one
run. Under his system extras would
be the most important item in the
SCOre.
Mr. J. CHAPMAN (Derbyshire) stated
that Mr. Goodwin seemed to have con-
fused a score-sheet with an hotel-bill.
Under such a system batsmen would
be kicking out in all directions.

J. T. TYLDESLEY (supported on all
sides by his relatives) remarked that he
represented Literature. He begged the
meeting to consider the Press and not
the crowd. No one, he continued em-
phatically, watched cricket nowadays,
but everyone read about it. The future
of the game was perfectly safe in the
hands of The Daily Mail.
DENToN (Yorkshire) said that he
had come to protest against his name
being used by the Northamptonshire
Twins. The law of copyright ought to
protect him. How, he asked, in an
impassioned voice, would GAUKRoDGER
like it if twin GAUKRoDGERs turned up
and played for Derbs?
CHIDGEY (Somerset) wished to draw
attention to the fact that he was
present. He objected to this discussion
about names. (Sympathetic applause.)
DIPPER (Gloucestershire) cordially
agreed with the last speaker. He would
like Mr. Woods to know that a water-
ousel was a very different thing from a
duckling.
At this point Glamorgan, speaking
through a megaphone, demanded justice
for Wales, and the meeting closed
at once without having formulated any
definite propaganda. |

Innocent Wife (walking round with her husband, who, after several futile strokes in the bunker guarding the first green, has miraculously
played out into the hole). “My word, HAnity, You'll, in Ave. A Job to get out of That --
in sight of Port.
It may be, as the dinghy left the haven,
I laughed aloud and said a foolish word:
Some idle sneer at Smith, whose heart was craven,
Mayhap the gods on high Olympus heard ;
But, if to leftward croaked a warning raven,
I must have missed the bird.
We started when the morn was fair, and waxen
The sails that sported on the brine ad lib.;
Beneath my vest there rose the Anglo-Saxon,
From time to time I smacked a brass-bound rib ;
I liked it when we went about and Jackson
Did something with the jib.
But ruthless is the nurse that rocks and pillows
The Viking on her lap—the unplumbed main ;
Too soon I cried, “Ah fortunatos illos,
Who stopped at home!" too soon I cursed the pain
Of ever climbing up the climbing billows
And barging down again.
Yet still unscathed—and all the while those asses
Kept jeering at a soul about to die,
I fought to fix my mind on mountain passes,
On meadow scenes and orchards near the Wye,
Gluing my optics to a pair of glasses
To make the land look nigh;
Till now—as when the long dissevered lover
Returns to find his mistress yet alive,
t
As when the panting roebuck flees to cover,
As when the go fer makes a splendid drive,
And two long brassies, and is sure to shove her
Down in a well-played five—
I saw the spindrift on the harbour breaking,
I saw (and now admired) the Norman church,
I saw the happy peasant pubwards making,
When lo! there came that last tremendous lurch;
The seagod took his toll !—but griefs so aching
It were not well to search. Evoe.

I said all that I had to say and
waited for Aspodestera to respond.
“All right,” she said at last, and there
followed the usual formalities proper
to the occasion. After a little while,
“Don’t you think that you are a very
lucky man 2" said she.
“Ye—es,” I answered, after a little
hesitation, “though of course I cannot
help thinking that you too . . . After
all, money isn't everything.”
Aspodestera regarded herself long
and carefully in the glass over the
mantel-piece and gave the matter full
consideration. Then she looked criti-
luck. When so many explanations
become necessary they are impossible,
so “It is a mere stereotyped form,” I
said loftily, and tried to carry it off
like that.
“Never mind, dear,” said Aspodes-
tera, “I think you are very clever . . .”
I unbent a little. We were getting
to the truth at last.
“. . . very clever,” she continued, “to

using only such an amount of gum as
will just uniformly moisten the surface
without leaving any obvious excess to

at being that of a gummed postage

We consider these instructions terse,
but perhaps hardly adequate. Not
a word is said, for instance, about the
condition of a gummed postage stamp,

would be quicker at seeing things.

accumulated a formidable batch of

PIFFLE ABOUT PENMEN.
Of the writing of books (by Mr.
Bellairy Hillock, M.P.) there is no end.
: If any one ventured to ask him when
he proposed to stop, he would probably
answer, “Mais pourquoi 2" and go on
writing. A treatise on “Cosmic Eco-
nomics,” from his indefatigable pen is
just out, and now a volume of “Terrible
| Triolets" is announced by Messrs.
Duckweed. Some one once observed
that politics and poetry were irrecon-
cilable, but it has been reserved for
Mr. Hillock in this, as in so many other
departments, to achieve the impossible
—on his head.
Mr. Wilhelm Le Quill has written his
reminiscences; but this, one devoutly
hopes, does not mean that he has
ceased to write novels. The Empire
could not easily acquiesce in such a
deprivation. Mr. Le Quill is of Cana-
dian extraction, having been born on
Goose Island, in the St. Lawrence,
though he has long since made his
home in London. We can count there-
fore on finding a characteristic sub-
| Arctic flavour in his volume, which
bears the engaging title, “From Log
Cabin to Carlton House Terrace.”
Madame Sahara Grandison has a
new novel—her 37th—appearing next
month, called “Martha with the Game
Leg,” which, she thinks, surpasses her
best previous achievements. The leg-
less hero—to say nothing of the head-
less horseman—is not unknown in the
annals of fiction, but this is, we believe,
the first novel with a lame heroine, un-
less, indeed, Tom Hood's “Miss Kil-
mansegg and her Golden Leg" may be
said to fill that bill. However, the
heroine of Madame Grandison's story,
it may be explained, does not rely on
any artificial substitute, and in the end
regains complete use of the defective
limb.
Sir Philibert Barker's new novel,
“The Mystification of Sir Galahad,”
will be published by Messrs. Greener

“That 's ALL 1:10. HT, MY MAN.

and Greener some time during the

to this romance in view of the fact that
the author's first cousin, Mrs. Verulam
Gammon, was recently robbed of
£25,000 worth of jewels while she was
on a lion-hunting trip in Somaliland.
The Macmurdo Fivepenny series for
this Autumn will include a long novel,
“The Governor of Tipperusalem,” by
Mr. Otis de Soto, and “Tales of Men
and Monkeys,” by Mrs. Stanleyette
Norton. No two Transatlantic authors
attract us more than Mrs. Norton, the
Ouida of Chicago, and Mr. Otis de Soto,
the A. C. Benson of Oklahoma.

Runnymede can be voluble in fifteen.

BRONZE WHILE YOU WAIT.
A TANNED face, we learn from The
Lancet, is not necessarily an index of
acquired health, as nowadays the mere
pigmentary effect of the sun upon the
skin can be readily imitated by em-
ploying the chemical or ultra-violet
rays of the electric light, and in par-
ticular the rays of the quartz mercury
lamp. A bronzed complexion can there-
fore be obtained in the space of minutes
instead of at the cost of a holiday at
the seaside extended over weeks.
Still, we are not altogether obliged to
our contemporary for thus giving the
show away, or, at any rate, if the revela-
tion had to be made, for not doing so
earlier. Here we have been toiling down
to Margate for several week-ends in suc-
cession, and spending shillings in the
attempt to develop a cherished set of
freckles in some extremely fugitive
sunshine, and it seems we might all
the while have been bronzed during
the lunch-hour at the local electrician's
or the beauty shop round the corner.
We shall now accept with reservation
the Continental alibis of Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL and Mr. LLoyd GEORGE.
The travellers' tales of the more brazen-
faced of our fellow club-members, rein-
forced with the foreign hotel-labels
obtainable in Soho, shall henceforward
be capped, and inexpensively. We
commend the idea, too, to those of
our weekly Territorials who have not
acquired sufficient pigmentation during
their recent brief campaign. Mr.
HALDANE should see to it that a
travelling clinic is attached to the
manoeuvres, with arrangements for
leaving the upper part of the patient's
forehead, and a narrow strip down
the cheek (where the strap ought to
go) satisfactorily untanned, in contrast
with the mahogany field of the rest
of the features. The period assigned to
the training of our fencibles can then
be still further reduced. .
Altogether this home - colouration
scheme ought to save a lot of civil and
military mobilisation during the holiday
weeks, and at any rate we hope it will
lower the price of excursion tickets.
We propose to start forthwith a Quartz
Mercury Touring Club for Londoners
compelled to remain behind the blinds
of their town houses.

MY FIRST JUMP.
I was riding with Gertie and Dick;
The morning was cloudy and cool;
Unsampled sensations came thick,
For I'd only just learnt in a school,
And, though keener than mustard, not
easily flustered,
I still felt a bit of a fool.
I could canter without holding on,
And the painful, inelegant bump
From my trot, so they told me, had
gone, -
But my heart all at once gave a
thump,
For, while crossing the meadow, Dick
suddenly said, “Oh,
Look, Joan | Here's a nice little
jump!” -
A ditch cut the meadow in twain ;
I guessed I must let the mare go;
Resistance from me would be vain,
It was clear that she wouldn't take
“ No.”
Though my “hands” might be wooden,
I gripped like a good 'un,
Sat down in my saddle—and lo!—
We were over as easy as pie.
Twang the lyre 1 Beat the drum !
Blow the trump 1
My heart was as high as the sky.
Never more shall I suffer from
hump.
Now for me there's no rational bar to
the “National; ”
Hooray! for I've had my first jump.

(Latest London Style.)
“Doctor,” he said, “I want bucking
up. A real tonic. Something that
will fill me with courage and deter-
mination.”
“But, my dear Sir,” said the physi-
cian, “that 's not my function. I am
here to look into your general health,
not prescribe for sudden emergencies.
What you want is not a doctor but an
American bar-tender. ‘Leave it to
Charley' was invented for such cases
as yours.”
“But surely the pharmacopoeia con-
tains something that imparts resolution
and address 2" said the trembling man.
“I particularly don't want to take
alcohol. There might be trouble, and
my chances of carrying the thing
through would be ruined if it could be
proved I had just come from a bar.
No, doctor, I implore you to give me
something. I can't do it without.”
“But what is it you have to do?
Tell me that first.”
The patient clutched at his heart.
“It's terrible,” he said. “I hardly know
how to say it. I belong to a club—a
new club—formed to deal with taxis.
We are pledged not to take a cab unless
the driver promises not to smoke. That
is one thing. That is not so hard, but
difficult enough to a retiring man like
myself.”
“Yes,” said the doctor. “Yes. What
next 2 '' - -
“Ah!” groaned his visitor. “Next?
That is much more serious. We are
pledged not to tip the drivers. It seems
that they get 25 per cent. of their
earnings, and we think it's enough.
So we took a terrible oath, and sealed !
it in a loving cup of petrol, never to tip
them again.”
“Well, and what has happened?” .
the physician inquired.
“Nothing yet,” replied the shaking
man; “we only begin to-day. We
drew lots who should act first, and the
lot fell to me. To me! I am pledged
to take a taxi this morning at 12 o'clock,
and first tell the man I won't have him
if he smokes, and then, at the end of
the journey, give him only as much as
is marked on the meter. Doctor, it's
a quarter to twelve. I implore you to
give me something powerful—some-
thing that will make a hero of me.
My heart is going 200 to the minute.”
From a catalogue of books:
“For ‘Lalla Rookh' Moore got £3,000. . . .
He was so small that his writing could hardly

From a letter in The Times:
“There is no delay whatever in claiming
luggage at a foreign destination. You present
your registration ticket and a porter at once

That settles the bother about the ticket
all right, but there still remains the
question of the luggage.

(4 suggested sequel to “Letters to my Son.”)
June 1, 1931.
DEAR MoTHER,-That book of yours
was rather a bloomer, wasn't it? Fancy
going to all that trouble to make up
a budget of anecdote and good counsel
for your unborn son and then his turn-
ing out to be a girl after all! I'm
really sorry for you, although I may
not sound like it, for I know how fright-
fully you wanted to be an author, and
how excited you were to have hit on
a really new idea and one so calculated
to appeal to the messier kind of reader,
who loves obstetrics or the suggestion
of them. It is hard lines that you
never had a son after all, especially as
I have not, I know, been a comfort
to you. But really it was your own
fault. If you had not written that
foolish book you would never have
filled your head with notions about a
boy at all, and how he would grow up,
and play cricket, and all the rest of it;
and then you would not have been so
disappointed when I was born.
And now that I am being so frank
(and I have waited till my twenty-first
birthday to be so) I will tell you that
Oliver, as you call father, never really
cared about that book of yours at all.
He thought not only that it was silly
in itself, but that it made him and you
silly too; but he was too kind and
weak to say so. But he has told me
so, many times, during our long walks
together. For though you have always
looked on me as an interloper he and
I have always been tremendous friends.
Your not too happy DAUGHTERKIN.
The Prince and the Principality.
Cardiff and Carnarvon are not the
only claimants to be the scene of the
proposed Investiture of the PRINCE of
WALES.
Emulous of the slashing yet erudite
style of the Mayor of Cardiff's appeal
in the Press, the Mayor of Llandrindod
Wells writes:—“History be hanged.
Give the lad fresh air and plenty of
fun, when he is invested, and see that
the crowds who come to witness the
ceremony are properly accommodated
in some of the most comfortable and
reasonable boarding-houses and hydros
in the Principality. This talk about
the Castles of Cardiff and Carnarvon,
and OweN GLYNDwr and HENRY THE
SEVENTH, is all bosh and nonsense. Our
golf-links and town band are the best
in Wales.”
The head-waiter of the restaurant at
the top of Snowdon writes: “It would
be highly appropriate to have the
ceremony on this ancient mountain,
which stood here some years before
either Cardiff or Carnarvon existed.”
The Mayor of a town whose name
contains upwards of two-score letters
writes: “What about our town 2. Its
name has been longer before the public
than that of any other town, indeed.”
The Mayor of Trefeglwys writes a
letter of six sheets, beginning: “Y
cwmllan bettws yniog, ap pwnllyth
yffryn?"—and we gather from the gist
of it that he would not personally
recommendeither Cardiff or Carnarvon.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN I hazard the opinion that Vocation (John MURRAY)
will appeal more to women than to men, I do not intend
to speak disparagingly of Miss GRANT DUFF's novel.
From the many confidential chats of the Misses Demerley
(there were three of them, but only two mattered), although
they prattled to some purpose, I got the feeling that their
heart-to-heart talks were a little overdone. Having, how-
ever, uttered this plaint, I hasten to add that Miss GRANT
DUFF seems to know everything there is to know about
women, and that psychologically her book is intensely
interesting. Lizzie Demerley, struggling to be just to her
hypochondriacal mother and at the same time to devote
her life to art, is not the only brilliant portrait; and indeed,
were it not for Dr. Headstone, I should have nothing but
to “call-pages.” It took me quite a long time to think
what these could be.
I don't know whether M. P. Wilcocks means me to
sympathise altogether with her hero, Michael, in The Way
Up (John LANE), but if she does I am afraid I am not on
the side of the angels. This young man refused the assist-
ance of his uncle's wealth (from conscientious objections
to capitalism), and entered the Phoenix Iron Foundry as a
common hand; then, falling in love with Elise Lesurier
(butterfly), he married her and wished her to live in
poverty while he used her money to start a scheme of
co-partnership in the works. She left him after a while
and went to London, to become—no, not a prima donna
this time, but a fairly talented actress, whilst Michael, his
love dying out, found a kindred spirit in Philippa Halliday,
his typist and secretary, who shared his enthusiasm for
co-operative schemes. To remove the only obstacle to
their union Elise in the end
praise for the characters.
This doctor (of ominous
name) appears to be pitch-
forked into the book so that
he might marry Lizzie's
selfish mamma; but such a
buffoon might with advan-
tage have been omitted, even
if Mrs. Demerley had to
remain a widow. Besides, I
do not believe that a lady of
so many nerves would ever
have consented to be called
Mrs. Headstone. Neverthe-
less, the merits of Vocation
are infinitely greater than its
defects, and if I have em-
phasised the latter my excuse
is that the former cmphasise
themselves.
One small point that
struck me about The Girl
from His Town (MILLs AND
Boon) was that, although
only the hero and heroine of
MARIE vaN Vorst's story are
supposed to be American,
their expressive idiom is

drowned herself; but, as I
did not care twopence for
Philippa, and would have
given a good deal to see Elise
sadly inconsolable. As be-
fore, this authoress shows a
marvellous facility for meta-
phor, and has drawn her
characters boldly and well.
I particularly like Louis
Aviolet, the novelist, and Mrs.
St rode, Michael's mother,
who is called a “Rabelais in

still two entirely different
countries, and that The
the English aristocrats to
whom they seem intended by the author to supply a refresh-
ing contrast. This is a pity; but, apart from it, the story
itself is a mildly entertaining one, about a Millionaire, and a
Duchess, and a Star-of-Musical-Comedy, and other such
Super-beings as the ordinary man loves to read about,
especially in hot weather, when he likes fiction that does
not very much matter. The Duchess wants to marry the
Millionaire for his dollars—the Duke, of course, being
already deceased—but the Millionaire prefers the Star;
chiefly, I gathered, because she also was from the States,
and had served him with an iced drink in the days of their
comparatively humble childhood. Eventually he marries
her, and they all live happy ever after. Practically every-
body in the tale is either supremely beautiful or supremely
rich, and in some cases both. They all stay at the Carlton
or the Savoy, and consume quantities of the most expensive
suppers. Altogether it is very pleasant. I should, how-
ever, have had more faith in the English atmosphere of it
all, but for those exotic touches of dialogue, mentioned
above; and the frequent reference, in the theatrical scenes,
Dragon Painter (STANLEY
PAUL) is a story about the other one. At any rate, Mr.
SIDNEY McCALL has written it as though he were describ-
ing things he has seen, and yet I have found nothing at all
like it at Shepherd's Bush. There are dragons at
Shepherd's Bush, of course, but these (if you ignore notices)
you can touch and make sure they are really there, whereas
the pictures of the Dragon Painter of the story contain
monsters which are invisible, even to one of his own race
and craft. This part of the book, I am bound to say, is
a little beyond me, and the illustrations don't help much,
but there is a love-tale which is pretty—particularly the
feminine part of it, for the painter loves rather furiously—
and that I can grasp readily enough. Indeed, the majority
of the few characters, apart from the young artist, are very
human and understandable, and there is a glamour about
this Japan which the other seems to be losing.

According to Mlle. BADET, the dancer
who is appearing at the Palace, every
word spoken by a woman “should be
accompanied by a gesture and expres-

“The Liberal Party,’” says The

as if one of them would have to go

As annual occupiers.

Where mermaids trill in liquid trebles,
No curious scribe will ask you for
The beach’s “Mineral Value " or
What party “works” the pebbles.

And hear the niggers sing inept tunes,
Or use at will your “Right of Way,”
In case you care to go and play
Next door, at Father Neptune's.

Or practise other harmless orgies;

Imbibing Pierrot's limpid jokes,
Unvexed of LLoyds and GEORGES.

“WELL,” said Dahlia, giving up the
tiller with a sigh, “if this is all that you
and Joe can do in the way of a breeze,
you needn't have worried.”
“Don’t blame the crew,” said Archie
nobly, “he did his best. He sat up all
night whistling.”
“Are we moving?” asked Myra,
from a horizontal position on the shady
side of the mainsail.
- “We are not,” I said, from a similar
| position on the sunny side. “Let's get
Simpson took off his yachting cap
and fanned himself with a nautical
almanac. “How far are we from
anywhere?” he asked cheerfully.
“Miles,” said Archie. “To be more
accurate, we are five miles from a public-
house, six from a church, four from a
post-office, and three from the spacious
walled-in kitchen-garden and tennis-
court. On the other hand, we are quite
close to the sea.”
“You will never see your friends
again, Simpson. They will miss you
. . . at first . . . . perhaps ; but
they will soon forget. The circulation
of the papers that you wrote for will
go up, the brindled bull-pup will be fed
by another and a smaller hand, but
otherwise all will be as it was before.”
My voice choked, and at the same
moment something whizzed past me
into the sea.
| “Yachting cap overboard'
cried Myra.
“You aren't in The Spectator office
| now, Simpson,” said Archie severely,
as he fished with the boat-hook.
“There is a time for ballyragging. By
the way, I suppose you do want it
back again 2"
“It's my fault,” I confessed remorse-
| fully; “I told him yesterday I didn't
like it.”
“Myra and I do like it, Mr. Simpson.
Please save it, Archie.”
Archie let it drip from the nd of
the boat-hook for a minute, and then
brought it in.
“Morning, Sir Thomas,” I said,
saluting it as it came on board.
“Lovely day for a sail. We 've got
the new topmast up, but her Grace
had the last of the potted-meat for
lunch yesterday.”
Simpson took his cap and stroked it
tenderly. “Thirteen and ninepence in
the Buckingham Palace Road,” he
murmured. “Thanks, old chap.”

land was hazy in the distance; hazy
in the distance was public - house,
church, post-office, walled-in kitchen-
garden and tennis-court. But in the
little cabin Joe was making a pleasant
noise with plates. . . .
“Splendid,” said Archie, putting
down his glass and taking out his pipe.
“Now what shall we do? I feel full
of energy.”
“Then you and Simpson can get
the dinghy out and tow,” I suggested.
“I’ll coach from the Armadillo.”
“We might go for a long bicycle
ride,” said Myra; “ or call on the Vicar-
age girls.”
“There isn't really very much to
do, is there?” said Dahlia gently.
“I’m sorry.”
Simpson leapt excitedly into the
breach.
“I’ll tell you what I’ll do—I'll
teach you all the different knots and
things. I learnt them coming down
in the train. Everybody ought to
know them. Archie, old man, can you
let me have a piece of rope?”
“Certainly. Take any piece you
like. Only spare the main-sheet.”
Simpson went forward to consult Joe,
and came back with enough to hang
himself with. He sat down opposite
to us, wrapped the rope once round his
waist, and then beamed at us over his
spectacles.
“Now supposing you had fallen
down a well,” he began, “and I let
this rope down to you, what would you
do with your end?”
We thought deeply for a moment.
“I should wait until you were look-
ing over the edge, and then give it a
sharp jerk,” said Archie.
“One must have company in a well,”
I agreed.
“They're being silly again,” apolo-
gised Myra. “Tell me, Mr. Simpson'
I should love to know—I’m always
falling down wells.”
“Well, you tie it round you like
this. Through there—and over there
—and then back under there. You
see, it simply can't slip. Then I should
pull you up.”
“But how nice of you. Let me
try. . . . Oh yes, that's easy.”
“Well, then there's the hangman's
knot.”
Archie and I looked at each other.
“The predicaments in which Simp-
son finds himself are extraordinarily
varied,” I said.
“One of these days he'll be in a
well, and we shall let down a rope to
him, and he'll hang himself by mis-
take.”
“That would look very determined.
On the other hand there must be
annoying occasions when he starts out
to strangle somebody and finds that
he's pulling him out of the cistern.”
“Why, how delightful, Mr. Simpson,”
said Myra. “Do show us some more.”
“Those are the most important ones.
Then there are one or two fancy ones.
Do you know the Monkey's Claw 2°
“Don’t touch it,” said Archie
solemnly. “It’s poison.”
“Oh, I must show you that.”
Joe showed me the Monkey's Claw
afterwards, and it is a beautiful thing,
but it was not a bit like Simpson's.
Simpson must have started badly, and
I think he used too much rope. After
about twenty minutes there was hardly
any of him visible at all.
“Take your time, Houdini,” said
Archie, “take your time. Just let us
know when you're ready to be put
into the safe, that's all.”
“You would hardly think, to look at
him now,” I said a minute later, “that
one day he'll be a dear little butterfly.”
“Where's the sealing wax, Maria 2
You know, I'm certain he'll never go
for threepence.”
“What I say is, it's simply hypnotic
suggestion. There's no rope there at
all, really.”
An anxious silence followed.
“No,” said Simpson suddenly, “I’m
doing it wrong.”
:: :: 2: +
“From to-night,” said Archie after
tea, “you will be put on rations. One
cobnut and a thimbleful of sherry wine
per diem. I hope somebody's brought
a thimble.”
“There really isn't so very much
left,” said Dahlia.
“Then we shall have to draw lots
who is to be eaten.”
“Don’t we eat our boots and things
first 2" asked Myra. -
“If Simpson starts off on his yachting
cap there'll be no holding him.”
“After all, there's always the dinghy,”
said Archie. “If we put in a tin of
corned beef and a compass and a keg
of gunpowder, somebody might easily
row in and post the letters. Personally,
as captain, I must stick to my ship.”
“There 's another way I've just
thought of,” I said. “Let's sail in.”
I pointed out to sea, and there,
unmistakably, was the least little
breeze coming over the waters. A
minute later and our pennant flapped
once. Simpson moistened a finger and
held it up.
The sprint for home had begun.

BEAUTIFUL WORDS.
THE catalogues of beautiful words
that have helped to fill the columns of
The Westminster Gazette during this
dull season do not include all. - - -
How beautiful is the word “Yes”
when used with an appropriate context.
Soft lights, distant music, the seclusion
of a scented conservatory, the radiant
moon peeping in through the roof–and
“Yes” murmured between coral lips
and pearly teeth, with blush and hung
head complete. Did SHAKSPEARE him-
self ever write a word more beautiful?
Or when, in conversation with a friend
of means, through the weather, the
view, the new Land Taxes, and the
weather once more, you approach the
subject of a small loan, what sweeter
sound could caress your ear than a
gentle “Yes." Even “Ja” sounds
beautiful in such a connection.
Take again the word “No." There
is something that a Briton cannot
fail to admire in the sturdy sound of
its nasal consonant allied to the honest
open vowel; and who has not felt the
thrill of this word in responding to the
classical question, “Are we down-
hearted?” The author of this question
is unknown; but his genius must ever
live if only because he has brought
home to the English-speaking people the
deep beauty of the little word “No”
—when used in the right context, of
course. Despite the habit of the per-
tinacious, there are times when it is
well to take “No” for an answer.
The little word “And " has never
received a due acknowledgment of its
beauty. It has, of course, the added
merit of utility; and indeed where is
the beauty of a thing, however beauti-
ful, that is not useful? Very well,
then. This was quite a favourite
word with SPENSER, SHARspEARE, and
MILTON in days gone by, and is still
regarded as the best of its kind by
Messrs. HALL CAINE, LE QUEUx, and
ALFRED AUSTIN in the present day.
Another word not rightly valued is
“Enough.” What could be more
beautiful in its appropriate place than
“Enough"? “Enough" is as good as a
feast. - . .
(Let's try it here and see how it looks.
Enough l—Ed.)
“The Government are making a road to
Porcupine Lake, using about fifty convicts for
the purpose."—The Record.
This may not be the best kind of road,
but it is better than if they had made
one to Convict Lake, using fifty por-
cupines for the purpose.
From a penny novelette:–
“‘Miss Saxe is a client of mine, Clare,' John
explained. ‘Her boxes have gone astray. She
is anyout " size—your figure, I mean—can
you lend her some things?' I know there is a
dress-suit of mine up in my old 1.com.'
Dinner was rather late that night. Possibly
Miss Saxe and Clare had been talking together;
but when they came into the room John felt he
was compensated for the delay.”
It must have been worth waiting for.
Two extracts from one issue of The
Daily Mail:
“The Orion is 545ft. long and has a dis-
placement of 22,500 tons.”
“With her engines and armament her ton-
nage will be nearly 24,000. She is 684ft. in
length.”
The worst of The Daily Mail is that it
is so up-to-date that as soon as you
'get on to a new page the old page
becomes obsolete.

[August 31, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A Tax on THE IMAGINATION.
PROPERLY speaking, the only build-
ing I actually possess is a henhouse.
The manifest disadvantage of allowing
fowls to scratch in the garden impelled
me to buy one rod, pole, or perch of
land across the road, upon which was
presently upreared a meat and unpre-
tentious structure, painted a pleasant
“art " shade, somewhere between blue
and green, and with a tarned felt roof.
I am pardonably proud of it; and, when
I received a brochure that has been
distributed gratis among the great land-
owners of this realm, the first problem
in it that caught my eye was this:–
“Hypothetical cost of removing the
buildings.” ! . -
Angelina, finding me busy with
figures, accused me roundly of wasting
the morning in working out bridge
problems. ! . . . .
“On the contrary,” I explained, “I
am trying to work out the hypothetical
cost of removing the henhouse.”
“Remove it? Why should you want
to ?” she asked. :
“I don't want to,” I replied, “but it
seems that I am obliged, under heavy
penalties, to suppose that its removal
is required, and to arrive at an estimate
of the cost of such removal. It's a
new system of taxation,” I continued
airily, “which it would be useless to
attempt to explain to a woman.
the whole realm of hypothesis open to
me, what ought I to spend on removing
With
the henhouse 2"
“Where to ?” asked Angelina in
bewilderment. -
“I'm afraid,” I said, after five minutes'
study of the monumental work before
me, “that point has been overlooked.
We will assume it has just got to
be removed—demolished. Now, whom
should I employ on the job?”
“You generally have Thomas Shadd.
If he was doing no work at the Simsons'
that week, I expect he would spin it
out as hong as possible. And he would
want beer,” remarked Angelina.
“There it is,” I said. “These
doctrinaire financiers are so unpractical.
They never take human nature into
account. Thomas's thirst varies in
degree. But fancy is free, and we will
assume, without unduly straining proba-
bilities, that Thomas is very thirsty.
A week at three shillings a day, with
beer, would come to twenty-four
shillings.”
Angelina, who is of frugal mind,
looked troubled.
“You might get Harold Bly,” she
said, “but he is so independent.”
“All the same, Harold comes within ||
the wide regions of hypothesis,” I said,
noting down his name, “and so, for
that matter, do I. I might do the work
myself.” -
Angelina smiled. -- -
“Fancy is free,” I repeated sternly.
“It is quite within the bounds of suppo-
sition that I should myself remove the
henhouse.”
“Wouldn't it need a hammer ?”
asked Angelina. “You know you
always hammer your thumb.”
“Very well,” I said, “we will allow
for that, and for lockjaw and complica-
tions supervening. Then I should be
ordered a rest-cure or a sea-voyage.
Hypothesis,” I said, warming to the
work, “can pile the cost up to any
amount. Now let us suppose I give
the job to contractors, to Williams
and Clark, for instance.”
“I can't suppose you would do any-
thing so silly, after the muddle they
made over the kitchen-boiler,” replied
Angelina.
“My love,” I urged gently, “it is, no
doubt, a little difficult to imagine any
lapse on my part from a high level of
sanity; but with a penalty of fifty
pounds threatening and with a full
appreciation of the duties of citizenship,
it is necessary to suppose even this;
and Williams and Clark would send in a
bill for two pounds seventeen shillings
and sixpence—on hypothesis.
“Hypothesis also allows removal by
gunpowder,” I continued, entering into
the spirit of the thing. “I expect a
shilling's worth would be effective;
and cordite might be even cheaper.
There is also fire to be considered; but
perhaps the justest way of arriving
at an estimate would be to take
the average cost of all practicable
methods.”
It worked out like this:–
To T. Shadd, for removing
henhouse (with beer) . .
To Harold Bly, for do.
(without beer) . - -
Williams and Clark

accidents with hammers

Roughly speaking, therefore, the cost
of removing the building might be set
down at twenty-two pounds one and
eightpence halfpenny.
“But,” said Angelina, “are you sure
the question applies to henhouses 2 ”
“That,” I said, readjusting a wet
towel about my brows, and patting the
printed work in front of me, “is what ||
I have to discover from this. All I
know for certain is that, with the
Broadening of the Basis of Taxation,
a tax has been placed upon my
imagination.”
“After all,” I concluded sombrely,
“it was about the only thing left that
was not taxed already.”
ECCENTRIC APPETITES.
A correspondeNt, in a letter to our
esteemed contemporary, The Scotsman,
describes the discovery of a needle an
inch and a half long inside a hen's egg.
By the courtesy of the editor of The
Dictator we are enabled to publish a
selection of letters describing similar
discoveries which will appear in the
next issue of that journal:—
Ex AFRICA SEMPER.
DEAR SIR, - When I was visiting
Pietermaritzburg early in this year, the
Curator of the Zoological Gardens told
me of a curious incident that recently
came under his observation. A valu-
able semi-Bombay Duck (Anas incredi-
bilis) suddenly fell ill and died, and
the post-mortem revealed the extraordi-
nary fact that the bird had swallowed
a pocket aneroid which had been inad-
vertently dropped into its cage by an
absent - minded visitor. Curiously
enough, the aneroid pointed to stormy,
although the weather at the time was
remarkably still and fine.
I am, Sir, very truly yours,
VERAx.
[Africa is indeed the home of marvels.
With regard to the indication of the
aneroid, may we not assume that this
pointed to a local disturbance in the
interior 2–ED. Dictator.]
STRANGE CoNDUCT or AN EEL.
DEAR SIR,-My son, a Balliol under-
graduate, was recently playing golf at
Nairn and, duffing his approach at the
fourteenth hole, sent the ball into the
burn. His caddie failed to find it, but
while looking in the burn scooped out
a fine eel of about two feet in length.
Noticing a curious protuberance in its
body, he cut the eel in two with his
pocket-knife, and found the ball, which
is now preserved in the town museum.
Yours faithfully,
ALFRED DAVITT.
[The voracity of eels is, we believe,
something quite exceptional. But
surely a humaner method of making
the eel disgorge the golf ball might
have been adopted by the caddie.
We fear that Caledonia is still, in some
respects, “stern and wild.”—ED. Dic-
tator.]

REcovery of AN Ostrich.
DEAR SIR,-For many years I have
kept a pet ostrich in my garden at
Tulse Hill. The bird, which is of a
most affectionate disposition, lives
chiefly on hardware—old sardine tins,
marmalade jars, and disused safety-
razor blades. As a rule it enjoys
robust health, but last winter it con-
tracted influenza and pined away until
I grew seriously alarmed. In fact, I
was almost in despair when, at the
advice of a vet, I decided to try feed-
ing Oliver—for that is his name—on
the works of an old grandfather's clock,
a set of croquet balls, and a small
mowing machine. The diet worked
like magic, and in less than a week
the dear creature was quite himself
again. Yours most truly,
- DECIMUs PHIBBs.
[It would be interesting to know
whether the emu and the cassowary
share the predilection of the ostrich
for hardware. In regard to the choice
! of a medical adviser for ailing ostriches,
it seems to us that our correspondent
ought to have consulted a bird-doctor
rather than a “vet.” And yet, if we
remember aright, ARIstoph ANEs calls
the ostrichirmaxexrpvöv.–ED. Dictator.]
Wonders of THE SHORE.
# DEAR SIR,-Last month, while I was
on the beach at Weston-super-mare,
! I noticed a ring-tailed sand-pipit flying
about near the water-line. Suddenly
it swooped down and remained on the
'sand uttering short, sharp cries of dis-
tress. Hastily rushing to the spot I
discovered, to my amazement, that the
bird had been caught by an oyster.
The bivalve had opened to enjoy the
sun, but when the bird swooped down
had closed on the intruder like a vice.
Being unable to free the pipit I carried
it, with its captor, to my house, and
was operating on the crustacean with
champagne nippers when my tame
porbeagle jumped through the window
and unceremoniously devoured both bird
and oyster at a single gulp. I have
only to add that I am a Commissioner
for Oaths, a lifelong Free-Trader, and
a confirmed believer in the Referendum.
Faithfully yours,
A. LEGGE PULLAR.
[We are delighted to publish Mr.
LEGGE PULLAR's well-authenticated
communication. Our only regret is
that he should have omitted to state
whether his porteagle suffered any un-
toward consequences from his strange
meal. But an animalso quaintly named
is capable de tout.—Ed. Dictator.]
A Touching APPEAL.
DEAR SIR,-Can any of your readers
tell me the best diet for a viviparous
Nervous Passenger (during fog). “BUT suitely You 'RE NOT LEAVING THE BRIDGE, ARE
You, OFFICER }”
Officer (who has just been relieved). “Oh, YES.

mumps? I have tried it with Cam-
bridge sausages, truffles, cold boiled
pork and quince jelly, but no appre-
ciable improvement is yet noticeable.
Yours anxiously,
(Mrs.) TARA DIDDLE.
[We deeply sympathise with Mrs.
Diddle in her distress, and gladly give
the publicity of our columns to her
appeal for information. We have the
liveliest recollection of the discomfort
of mumps, and sincerely trust that her
interesting pet will soon recover its
normal health.-E.D. Dictator.]

Mr. Punch, for all
the blackguards' bully-
ing and blustering,
there can be no depth
of human vileness
which deserves the
punishment of quite so
snubbed and abject a
condition as Johnson
depicts. At the end of
every narrative I have
felt I must go and
comfort the man, wrong
one though he is, and
make the last remain-
ing days of his existence
peaceful and painless,
if they can never be
actually happy. And,
observe, it isn't only
Johnson. All my re-
lations, all my friends,
all my acquaintances,
all the people I have
ever seen and overheard
in the street—all seem
thus to have treated
someone, nay, every-
one who dared to cross
their path and to ad-
minister unjust blame
and unmerited rebuke.
Children and parents,
pupils and pastors,
curates and vicars,
young barristers and
judges, men and officers,
clerks and employers,
loafers and policemen,
servants and mistresses
—the contest is always
raging, the cool retort
always prevails: “I
said nothing. I just
looked him straight in
the eyes, and then said
quite quietly . . .” and
that ended it. Virtue
is, on its own showing,
triumphant. The op-
pressor is pulverised,
It was he who
showed me my métier. Johnson is
not the mild, milk-and-water young
man, you might, from your per-
sonal observation, suppose him to
be. He-I have it from his own
lips—is full of fire; he is not to be sat
upon. You start saying nasty, rude
things to Johnson, and you will very
soon find that you have come to the
wrong shop. No one, Johnson tells

with all the unbiassed accuracy of de-
tachment, “I just looked at him,
waited till he had finished, and then
said quite quietly . . .” and, whatever
it was that Johnson said, his antagonist
was reduced instantly to pulp, blushed
to the roots of his hair with the blush
of conscious shame, fell upon his knees

triumphant concludes, “you should

Inasmuch as this thing goes on daily,

“ DO I SLEEP 2 DO I DREAM 2"
A LITTLE book has just been pub-
lished, advocating self-suggestion as a
| cure for sufferers from head-ache, tooth-
ache, nervousness, sleeplessness and
kindred ills. For instance, the pro-
gramme to be gone through in cases of
insomnia (as quoted in The Earpress of
August 25) is as follows:–
| Repeat the subjoined exercises:–
Twice to yourself aloud: I am lying
| down to sleep and to sleep only.
Four times softly: I am feeling
sleepy.
Twice softly: I am falling asleep.
Mentally a few times: I am asleep.
Mentally: I sleep, I sleep; and con-
tinue until you know no more.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
, THE ELUSIVE BLACKS.
THE monstrous allegation having
been made that seaside niggers include
, in their hoary repertories songs which
are not, to put it mildly, the best
intellectual food for the young, all the
Brother Bones's and Massa Johnsons
of the littoral are up in arms. Mr.
Punch, whose instincts are to be on the
side both of the young and of the
entertainer, at once sent one of his
young men to investigate at first hand.
He made three visits—one to Ventnor,
one to Brighton and one to Margate—
and he spent much time and some
pence in the company of the Ethiopian
inhabitants of each town. At Ventnor
he found them singing a song entitled,
“I don't care if there's a girl there,” to
an enraptured audience chiefly of the
penniless class, using “penniless” not
as meaning generally destitute but at
its more exact sense of being without a
penny. In other words, the audience
was composed chiefly of children.
That section of the entertainment
having come to an end, our representa-
tive drew aside the singer and asked
him for his views on the ditty.
“What's the matter with it?” asked
the burnt-corkian. “It’s a good tune,
isn't it 2 ”
“Yes,” said the young man.
“It's funny, isn't it?”
“Not very,” our young man hazarded.
“It always goes very well,” said the
seaside Othellc
“Yes,” said our young man.
the children 2 ” -
“Don't you see them there?” asked
the Moor of Ventnor sarcastically, “in
their scores?”
“True,” said our young man.
“Very well, then,” said the dusky
baritone. . . .
There being no reply to this, our
young man gave in.
At Brighton, the serenaders were at
work with a ditty entitled “Boiled
Beef and Carrots.” The song told
how this dish was the favourite food of
the singer: — -
Boiled beef and carrots,
Boiled beef and carrots, - -
That's the stuff for your Darby Kell,
Makes you fat and keeps you well.
Don't be vegetarians,
Food they give to parrots;
Blow out your pants,
While you've the chance,
On boiled beef and carrots.
Such was the chorus, and from the
way the children joined in there was
no doubt that they appreciated it. Yet
the moral influence 2
A later verse told how the singer
was so much under the dominion of
this regimen that, when his wife pre-
sented him with twins (as the wives of
44 But,
sit down comfortably again
comic singers always do), and they
were taken to be christened, he replied
to the parson who enquired what their
names were to be, “Boiled beef and
carrots.” At this the children screamed
with delight. Our young man antici-
pated no success when he tackled the
singer on the subject, and he obtained
In One.
“Didn't you hear 'em laugh?” asked
the son of grate polish.
Our young man admitted that he
did. -
“Well,” said the nigritudinous
warbler, “don’t that satisfy you?”
At Margate, the favourite song was
called “For months, and months, and
months.” It told of a number of
disasters; how the singer had taken a
girl to skate, and how she had fallen
so badly that she would not be able to
“for
months, and months, and months,”
and so on. Everyone was as pleased
as could be, and the children sang it
with gusto.
Our young man asked the singer if
he had heard of the aspersion on two
of his fellow-niggers' good taste. He
said that he had. It was a crying
shame. He had been singing comic
songs for twenty years, and never
before had he been attacked. No one
loved and honoured children more than
he, he had children of his own, and he
therefore surely ought to know what
they should like and should not like.
Our young man agreed. .
“What songs do you want us to
sing?” the ebony cantillator con-
tinued. “We get all the best comics
as soon as they’re out. All GEORGE
RoBEY's. All T. E. DUNVILLE's. We
never spare any expense, and the
papers come along and attack us like
that. It’s a shame, that's what it is.
Fathers of families as we are, too. But
I must get back to work now,” he
added, and at once joined his company
in order to take the solo part in
“Archibald, certainly not l”
Mr. Punch, left to come to a decision
on the question, is inclined to the
| opinion that niggers will be niggers
and that children fortunately don't
understand all they hear.
In some professions the difficulty of
making a correct return of one's income
is more acute than in others. The
losses in the burglary at the Shepherd's

timated at £3,000 by The Daily Mail,
£2,000 by The Daily Mirror, and

OUR silly SEASON CORRESPONDENCE,
THE NEW COINAGE. :
To the Editor of “Punch.”
DEAR SIR,--I desire to put before
the public my views on the reverse
side of the penny. The warlike—I
might go so far as to say the hector-
ing, truculent attitude of Britannia as
there depicted is surely calculated to
give offence to another Friendly Power.
In these days of mutual good-will the
trident and the shield can only be re-
garded as a barbarous anachronism. I
trust that they will disappear in the
new issue and we shall find Britannia
surrounded by the arts of Peace. I |
would suggest that on those coins
which bear the date of 1910 an umbrella
might be substituted for the trident.
I am, yours, etc., PAx.

DEAR SIR,--I am looking forward to
the issue of the new coins with the
liveliest interest. Already there are
many curious aspects of our currency
which are often overlooked. Are you
aware, Sir, that it is impossible to put
two three-penny bits on the face of
a half-crown without their overlapping
at the edge? How many pennies do
you think one would have to pile one
above another to make a column as
high as a single penny set on edge 2

about six or eight. Can you find the

DEAR SIR,-If the Government could
see their way to call in all three-penny
bits, so that sixpence would be the
smallest silver coin, I am convinced
that we should soon be able, by means
of church collections, to wipe out the
debt which still hangs over our new
organ. I am, yours, etc.,

DEAR SIR,--Let us have notampering

will show that the gravest distress
would be caused throughout the country
by any interference with the vast volume

size of the penny were altered florins
would be used to any marked degree in
their place. I am, yours, etc.,

DEAR SIR,-In connection with the
issue of the new coinage, may I make
a very earnest appeal through your
columns to those with whom the
decision rests 2 The alteration which
I suggest is a very slight one, but it
would bring about a revolution in the
morals of the masses by removing from
them a temptation which continually
besets them. Let as have both sides

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Veronica Hewson is one of the most human and under-
standable heroines that I have met for some time. The
book in which she moves is Kinsmen's Clay (METHUEN),
where you find her, at the beginning, a romantic child,
living with her aunt, the housekeeper at an always empty
great house in Ireland. You hear also that Veronica's
father is reported to be “doing well" in soap. That brings
the curtain down on the prologue; when it rises again, the
father has already done so well as to be rich beyond the
dreams of reasonable ava- -
rice, and Veronica herself
is hesitating between the
offers of a soiled duke and || ||
a hypochondriac earl. This
is my one complaint against ||
Miss MARY CRosBIE, whose
novel has given me a great
deal of pleasure — that I
should like to have been
told rather more of Veronica
in her intermediate stages.
She decides on the earl—
hypochondria, eucalyptus
and all; and, having mar-
ried him, promptly dis-
covers her real love for
someone else. The scenes'
between these two seemed
to me quite exquisitely
written ; full of real feeling
and depth, without ever
being melodramatic. Un-
fortunately the Destined
Lover was quite obvious
from a very early page in
the book; and I could not
help feeling that, had
Veronica seen things as
clearly as I did, she
might have saved herself
a lot of worry. But, after
all, poor Lord Steynham
dies at last, and thus al-
lows Veronica to marry
the object of her second
thoughts, and a delightful
tale to reach its expected
ending.

[SEPTEMBER 7, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ELDEST SON.
WHEN I arrived in the day-nursery at 6.15 P.M. I was
a mere casual intruder, knowing nothing of the glories that
awaited me. To be sure there had been during the after-
noon certain hints which the observant might have inter-
preted correctly. Florence (aged eleven) had more than
once said “Hush" in a mysterious tone; Gertrude (aged
nine) had had several giggling fits in a corner, from which she
had been extracted flushed and breathless, but resolutely
secretive; and Maud (aged seven) had turned a good many
sudden somersaults on the floor or on the lawn, that being
| her method of expressing uncontrollable excitement. At
the moment, however, these portents had not struck me.
All I noticed was that at six o'clock the lower regions of
the house were uncommonly quiet, and I went upstairs
and into the nursery to discover what had happened to its
tumultuous population. Without the least warning I
found myself plunged into the midst of a theatrical
performance.
The room had been divided by a large screen which—
somewhat imperfectly—represented a curtain. In front
of this the audience, consisting of all the female
servants of the house, was ranged on chairs. Behind it
the actors were preparing for the Second Act. I gathered,
not from the attitude of the audience, which was one of
resignation rather than of hilarity, but from what the
Queen herself told me, that the First Act had consisted of
a banquet and a revelry to celebrate the home-coming of
the Queen's eldest son, who had been to the wars and
might now be expected to arrive at any moment. He had
not, however, arrived in time for the First Act, but the
festivities had not been in the least impaired by his absence,
Prince John in particular having consumed a whole ox,
served with French beans, roasted potatoes, and vegetable
marrow, while the Lady Lavinia had held the company
enthralled by the delicacy of her wit. The Queen, I ought
perhaps to add, was Florence, robed majestically in a bed-
spread of variegated colours, and having her head bound
round with a band of yellow-and-black silk which was
always coming off. The Lady Lavinia was acted by
Gertrude in a gauzy silvery dress with a pair of wings (the
remains of a Christmas entertainment), while the important
part of Prince John found a minute but brilliant repre-
sentative in Maud, who wore with great courage a white
sweater, a pair of quasi-Turkish knickerbockers, gaudy
Roman stockings, and a green knitted cap. I was informed
that the date of the play was “Once upon a Time,” as,
indeed, the dresses sufficiently indicated. The programme,
neatly written by Gertrude, promised the following enter-
tainment:—
A Fairy Play,
Dances,
Drammatik Event,
The Queen's Farewell to her Ladies.
The play itself, however, appeared to possess a power of
internal development which made the programme quite
irrelevant and useless, except to the servants, who never
failed to consult it with great solemnity as the action
proceeded.
All was now ready for the Second and, as it proved, the
final Act.
“Let the curtain now go up,” said the Queen, the screen
being accordingly removed by the nurse, who then promptly
resumed her place in the front row of the stalls. The
Queen was thereupon revealed sitting on her chintz-
covered throne, with the Lady Lavinia standing airily
beside her, and Prince John sitting at her feet in an attitude
expressive of devotion.
“There ought to be a crash of martial music,” continued
the Queen, “but the musical box won't work properly.
You must imagine it. (Aside) Gerty, give the old box
another turn and shake it.” This having been done, the
box at last consented to wheeze out “The Blue Bells of
Scotland,” and the Queen proceeded.
“Prince John,” she said, “will now tread a measure.
Bother this silk band; it's coming off again. Quick,
Prince John, show your paces, as you used to in the happy
days of twenty years ago. The Lady Lavinia will be
your partner. I will watch you and think of my unhappy
lot. Do put your shoes on, Gerty, or we shall never get
started. What ho! Let there be revelry.”
She then composed herself on her throne, and Prince
John, assisted by the Lady Lavinia, trod a measure,
#. the musical box drifted on and on with the “Blue
ells.”
A dreadful event then took place. It appeared that
whilst all this was going on the Queen's eldest son—
though no information of this had been given to the
audience—was engaged in fighting desperately without.
As soon therefore as the dance came to an end the
following dialogue took place:–
The Queen. Go, Prince John, and learn how my eldest
son is getting on, for he is fighting his best against many
foes.
Prince John. I will, your Majesty. Your hair's coming
down again.
[Erit hurriedly through the door while the Queen
adjusts her hair.
The Queen. I am afraid they will defeat him.
Prince John (re-enters jauntily). Your Majesty's eldest
son has just been killed.
The Queen thereupon gave a loud yell and fainted on the
floor, and desperate attempts were made to revive her by
means of brandy administered from a clothes-brush by
Prince John. This proving ineffectual, the Prince and the
Lady Lavinia blew very hard on every part of the
Queen's face, who then raised herself into a sitting posture
and ordered Lady Lavinia to go to the window and
gather further details. Lady Lavinia accordingly danced
lightly to the window, gazed through it into the sky, and
declared in a perfectly matter-of-fact tone that the eldest
son was alive. “It was the other one,” she added, leaving
us to infer that some other son had, in fact, succumbed.
All was now rejoicing, and so remained until the Queen,
still struggling with her hair-band, commanded Lady
Lavinia to tell her what that noise was.
Lady Lavinia. Your Majesty, it is a gun.
The Queen. What is it doing?
Lady L. It's shooting, your Majesty.
The Queen. Is it shooting at a far distant country, or at
this lonely old castle 2
Lady L. At this castle, your Majesty.
Prince John (with decision). Then I'm off.
[Eacit accordingly.
Apparently overcome by this cruel desertion the Queen
then declared the drama at an end, the screen was cere-
moniously replaced, and we never set eyes on the eldest
son after all.

III.-A DAY AsHoRE.
“WELL, which is it to be 2'' asked
Archie.
“Just whichever you like,” said
Dahlia, “only make up your minds.”
“Well, I can do you a very good
line in either. I've got a lot of sea in
the front of the house, and there's the
Armadillo straining at the leash; and
I've had some land put down at the
back of the house, and there 's the
Silent-Knight eating her carburettor
off in the kennels.”
“Oh, what can ail thee, Silent-Knight,
alone and palely loitering?” asked
Simpson. “KEATs,” he added kindly.
“Ass (SHAKSPEARE),” I said.
“Of course, if we sailed,” Simpson
went on eagerly, “and we got becalmed
again, I could teach you chaps sig-
nalling.”
Archie looked from one to the other
of us.
“I think that settles it,” he said,
and went off to see about the motor.
“Little Chagford,” said Archie, as
he slowed down. “Where are we
going to, by the way?”
“I thought we'd just go on until we
found a nice place for lunch.”
“And then on again till we found a
nice place for tea,” added Myra.
“And so home to dinner,” I con-
cluded.
“Speaking for myself
Simpson.
“Oh, go on.”
“I should like to see a church where
IXATHARINE of ARAGON or somebody
was buried.”

“Wait till we get back to London,
and I'll take you to Madame Tussaud's,
Mr. Simpson.”
“Well, I think he's quite right,”
said Dahlia. “There is an old Norman
church, I believe, and we ought to go
and see it. The Philistines needn't
come in if they don't want to.”
“Philistines ' " I said indignantly.
“Well, I'm * *
“Agagged,” suggested Archie. “Oh
mo, he was an Amalekite.”
“You’ve lived in the same country
as this famous old Norman church for
years and years and years, and you care
so little about it that you've never
been to see it and aren't sure whether it
was KATHARINE of ARAGON or Alice-
for-short who was buried here, and now
that you have come across it by acci-
dent you want to drive up to it in
a brand-new 1910 motor car, with
Simpsº his 1910 gents' fancy vest
began
knocking out the ashes of his pipe
against the lych-gate as he goes in . .
And that 's what it is to be one of the
elect l’’
“Little Chagford's noted back-chat
comedians,” commented Archie. “Your
turn, Dahlia.”
“There was once a Prince who was
walking in a forest near his castle one
day—that's how all the nice stories
begin—and he suddenly came across a
beautiful maiden, and he said to him-
self, ‘I’ve lived here for years and years
and years, and I've never seen her
before, and I'm not sure whether her
name is Katharine or Alice, or where
her uncle was buried, and I've got a
new surcoat on which doesn't match
her wimple at all, so let's leave her and
go home to lunch. . . . And that 's
what it is to be one of the elect ' "
“Don’t go on too long,” said Archie.
“There are the performing seals to come
after you.”
I jumped out of the car and joined
her in the road.
“Dahlia, I apologise,” I said. “You
are quite right. We will visit this
little church together, and see who was
buried there.”
Myra looked up from the book she
had been studying, Jovial Jaunts
Round Jibmouth.
“There isn't a church at Little
Chagford,” she said. “At least there
wasn't two years ago, when this book
was published. So that looks as though
it can't be very early Norman.”
“Then let's go on,” said Archie,
after a deep silence.
We found a most delightful little
spot (which wasn't famous for any-
thing) for lunch, and had the baskets
out of the car in no time.
“Now are you going to help get
things ready,” asked Myra, “or are you
going to take advantage of your sex
and watch Dahlia and me do all the
work 2''
“I thought women always liked to
keep the food jobs for themselves,” I
said. “I know I'm never allowed in
the kitchen at home. Besides, I've got
more important work to do—I’m going
to make the fire.”
“What fire 2''
“You can't really lead the simple life
and feel at home with Nature until you
have laid a fire of twigs and branches,
rubbed two sticks together to procure
a flame, and placed in the ashes the
pemmican or whatever it is that falls
to your rifle.”
“Well, I did go out to look for pem-
mican this morning, but there were
none rising.”
“Then I shall have my ham sand-
wich hot.”
“Bread, butter, cheese, eggs, sand-
wiches, fruit,” catalogued Dahlia, as she
..] took them out; “what else do you |
want?” t
“I’m waiting here for cake,” I said.
“Bother, I forgot the cake.” -
“Look here, this picnic isn't going
with the swing that one had looked
for. No pemmican, no cake, no early
Norman church. We might almost as
well be back in the Cromwell Road.”
“Does your whole happiness depend
on cake?” asked Myra scornfully.
“Very nearly. Very nearly indeed.
Archie,” I called out, “there's no cake.”
Archie stopped patting the car and
came over to us. “Good. Let's begin,”
he said; “I’m hungry.”
“You didn’t hear. I said there
wasn't any cake—on the contrary, there
is an entire absence of it, a shortage,
a vacuum, not to say a lacuna. In the
place where it should be there is an
aching void or mere hard-boiled eggs
or something of that sort. I say,
doesn't anybody mind, except me?”
Apparently nobody did, so that it
was useless to think of sending Archie
back for it. Instead, I did a little
wrist-work with the corkscrew. . . .
“Now,” said Archie, after lunch,
“before you all go off with your butter-
fly nets, I'd better say that we shall
be moving on at half-past three about.
That is, unless one of you has dis-
covered the slot of a Large Cabbage
White just about then, and is following
up the trail very keenly.”
“I know what I'm going to do,” I
said, “if the flies will let me alone.”
“Tell me quickly before I guess,”
begged Myra.
“I’m going to lie on my baek and
think about Simpson.”
“Well, wake up by half-past three,
that 's all.”
“Are you sure,” asked Simpson,
“that you wouldn't like me to show
you that signalling now 2 "
I closed my eyes. You know, I
wonder sometimes what it is that
makes a picnic so pleasant. Because
all the important things, the eating and
the sleeping, one can do anywhere.

[SEPTEMBER 7, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ENGLAND FOR THE ENGLISH.
To THE EDITOR OF “PUNCH.”
SIR,--Superintending as you do,
with your traditional perspicacity, the
processes involved in the manufacture
of History, you cannot have failed to
notice the Manifesto recently issued by
the group of Caledonian gentlemen who
style themselves “The Committee to
Promote National Self-Government for
Scotland.” But, engrossed as you are
in guiding the trend of more funda-
mental issues, you may have omitted
to put to yourself, as I and doubtless
many other Englishmen have done,
the joyous interrogation which that
Manifesto carries in its wake.
My pen trembles. Seldom have I
taken that instrument in hand with a
weightier sense of the importance of
the occasion. The temporary weak-
ness is excusable. I am no Stoic, no
stern-faced Gael or unresponsive Celt,
but a Saxon, with all the emotional
weakness of his race.
If I am capable of drawing a logical
inference from a given proposition (and
I have hinted, Sir, that I am English),
I venture to say that we seem to be
approaching a time—I hope I am not
unduly optimistic—when this country
will be left entirely in the possession
of those who own it by right of national
title. If this be not the case, what
other conclusion can we draw from all
these symptoms of Gaelic nostalgia,
these outbreaks of Celtic Zionism,
these homesick yearnings of the tribes
who have so long made our laws,
stampeded our Parliamentary division
lobbies, and robbed our poultry dormi-
tories 2
Is Ireland about to secede 2 Well!
well! Erin-go-Bragh ! Let them see
that the process of government is
properly carried on under Queens-
berry rules. And must Wales follow
her? Tut, tut! but—Cymru am Byth !
They were ever a cantankerous lot.
But Scotland, Sir, Scotland / What 1
relax the age-old grip on the fleshpots
of England 2 renounce the Southern
right of way so hardily won at Bannock-
burn ? restore to the Saxon his privi-
leges of place and power 2 Sir, hoping
with all my heart that it may be so, I
scarcely dare to believe it. England
Scot-freel England de-Picted again
as in the frescoes of HADRIAN's Villa
Beats there the true English heart that
can contain itself on hearing this glad
news?
It behoves us, however, to be
cautious. The resources of Gaelic
humour are infinite, and I vaguely fear
that Mr. MUNRO - FERGUson and his
fellow-committeemen are attempting
to pull the Saxon's leg. Political
manifestoes issued during the dog-days
sometimes have a certain savour of
fishiness. Have you lately noticed an
odour, a passing reek — dear, dear,
there it goes again l—of red herring 2
I am, Sir, Yours, etc.,
AN ENGLISH HoME-RULER.
THE COMPLETE LAND TAXER.
(A Guide to the Duties of a Citizen.)
To assist owners of land who may
be confused by the returns for Duties
on Land Values demanded by the
Commissioners of Inland Revenue the
following notes have been compiled,
giving more complete information,
especially as regards the penalties,
than the meagre “Instructions" only
covering two pages of foolscap.
It is well first to define “land,”
which the Commissioners describe as
an “expression.” By ignorant per-
sons it is thought to be solid earth.
For the purposes of the Duties on
Land Values — see Instruction 199
(viii), (x) (y) (z), 27, 385, Paragraph 95
(k) (xxxvi)—it also appears to include
buildings which are not structures and
structures which are not buildings,
likewise caravans, tents, aeroplanes,
trees, shrubs, weeds, cows, pigs, poultry,
rats, mice, snails, slugs, birds and but-
terflies thereon, and all minerals, brick-
bats, potatoes, broken bottles, flint
implements, chalybeate springs, trea-
sure trove and earthworms on, in or
under the surface. For further parti-
culars of the component parts of
“land ” see Instruction 73, 948 B.
Part 369, Sections 51, Air; 52, Fire,
and 53, Water.
Having thus a clear idea of the
nature of “land,” the next duty of the
owner is to read all the instructions,
with the Notes, Sub-notes, Marginal
References, Parenthetical Alternatives
and Appendices. Penalty for not un-
derstanding all of them, £50. By
devoting sixteen hours a day, with
the assistance of a solicitor, licensed
valuer, licensed victualler, thought-
reader and puzzle-editor of any periodi-
cal, these Instructions could be mas-
tered in four weeks, leaving two days
for answering the questions, Penalty
for not answering them, £50.
Before entering on these solemn
duties of citizenship, the landowner
should practise on a small subject,
such as his dog-kennel, which is a
structure and therefore “land,” for
which a separate form must be filled
up. He must give his own name.
Penalty for any confused owner writing
“Not known" in this space, £50. He
must also carefully state the Name of
the Parish, of the Occupier (“Spot” or
“Jack,” as the case may be), the De-
scription of the Land, the Extent of it
(say, one square yard—no perches), the
Amounts of Rent, Land Tax, Tithe,
Improvement Rate, Repairs and In-
surance; whether there are Public
Rights of Way through the Dog-
kennel; if allowed by tenant; or Public
Rights of User of it, or Rights of
Common over it, giving full particulars
in every case in the space of a single |
line two inches long (penalty for going
beyond this space, £50), and also the
Particulars of the last Sale of it. -
At this point there is a sort of
breathing-space, with a blank for “Ob- |
servations.” They are probably best
indicated by a blank, though a dash
might be allowed. There is then a
space for the name and address of any
person to whom the landowner might
desire similar interesting communica-
tions to be sent. Obviously someone
against whom he has a grudge. Per-
haps “Lloyd George, Wales” would
do. Penalty for writing “Old Nick"
or any similar name in this space, £50.
Finally, he must state whether the
minerals, brickbats, bones, etc., under
the Dog-kennel are comprised in a
mining lease, or worked by the pro-
prietor, or scratched up by the tenant.
He need not even stop then, for he
can go on to give Additional Particu-
lars “if desired,” as clearly set forth in
Instruction 121 (MCC) (i), (o), (u), and
Instruction 926, 731 (cc), (o), (i), (c).
Penalty for giving the particulars, if
not desired, £50. Penalty for desiring
to give but not giving them, £50.
When the beginner has mastered
this first exercise he will go on to a
cow-shed, a motor-garage, an hotel, a
gasometer, a swimming-bath, a fish-
pond, and other sorts of “land.” He
will then do well to take a holiday on
the sea, which, according to some old-
fashioned authorities, is not “land,” and
give his brain a complete rest.
Finally the advanced student will be
able to answer the most abstruse ques-
tions, such as:—
(i) What is the full site value of the
Bank of England, if divested of the
Bank of England, together with all
growing timber, fruit trees, fruit bushes
and other things growing thereon 2
(ii) What would be the full site
value of the present garden of the
Bank, if occupied by (a) an orange
grove, (b) a vineyard, º a golf links,
(d) two shrubs and six blades of grass,
(e) an American sky-scraper, and (f)
nothing?
(iii) What was the full site value of
the Bank of England on April 1st,
1909 )
(iv) What was the full site value in

[In the annual report of the Meteorological office it is stated that on
only five occasions during the past, twelve months was the department
tempted to forecast a spell of two days' fine weather. On October 1 the
Office is to have a new chief, and at the same time will be moved from
its present dingy quarters in Victoria Street to what the }. describe
as a “palatial” new building erected in Imperial Institute Road, South
Kensington. The following lines of earnest exhortation are addressed to
Mr. LEMPFERT, the new Clerk of the Weather.]
SIR, you are called upon to rule a roast -
That's like to prove a tough affair; but still it is
A noble task, and brimful of the most
Glorious possibilities.
Your predecessor did his best, it's true;
And, if 'twas mostly evil that he prophesied,
What could one have expected him to do
When he his dingy office eyed?
He did his work according to his lights,
But they were far from brilliant; and I guess he missed
The Sun so badly that his days seemed nights,
And he became a pessimist.
No man could hope by methods such as these
To woo the weather-gods, however well he meant;
With tactful flattery he should appease
Each unpropitious element.
You, Sir, with your as yet unblemished slate,
Have no occasion for the least propensity
To dark forebodings, which but aggravate
The atmospheric density.
For you we've built a palace which a king
Might eye with envy; there we will not suffer you
To lack for aught; the best of everything
Will scarce be good enough for you.
From fleshly cravings thus completely weaned,
Look to it lest your character degenerate;
Be brisk and bright—and have your windows cleaned
Once every month, at any rate.
Then, should the Sun-god chance to pass your way
(You know by now what a capricious god is he),
He'll look you up, and see what you've to say
About his latest Odyssey;
And, if your stuff and style do not offend
His fancy, he may be disposed to pleasure ours.
And in our grateful company to spend
A portion of his leisure hours.
So give your oracles a cheerful turn;
Whatever doubts you harbour, don't exhibit 'em ;
And, if the trick comes off, be sure you'll earn
Your country's thanks ad libitum.
Social and Personal. |

“The Standards commenced the second half in brilliant fashion and
making tracks for equalise, the play of the opposing forward line was
safeguarded by good watchfull back divisions, namely Kalie, F. Charles
º and C. M. Arumugam, and the play being betwin G. B. Ward,
C. P. Tommy, I. Timothy, and W. C. Harry, little to be desired, wile
in this positions Standards did remarkably well and got to the Stars
quarter, this young lad Albert, now playing left out with his capital
efence d.º.d a good shooting which Moon nicley saved in goal. How-
ever C. P. Tommy was on his own play waiting for the ball theire comes
the ball after a good save here heads Tommy and resulted 1 goal within 8
yards and been sure for his mark, and this event was soon followed by
another one similary organised by the Stars, thus Stars 2 goals,
Standards 1 goal. Now the game bacome to be faster than what it was.
However, F. Charles the unselfesh (captain) remarked play up my Lads,
we ill reach the Post, and whont be long, Yet the Lads pressed well for
all they could, C. P. Tommy with good movement made a splendid dive
an ended up a brilliant work by scoring in the end.”

AT THE PLAY.
“ HENRY VIII.”
Nobody can accuse Sir HERBERT
TREE this time of having spoilt a good
drama by excess of embroidery. Henry
VIII. is too bad a play for that. It
has, of course, its detached passages,
full of dignity and pathos, and one
great dramatic scene—in the Hall at
Blackfriars—but for the rest it is a
matter of pageantry and little else.
| Character and motive, in the persons
of King and Cardinal, remain obscure;
BuckINGHAM's tragedy, coming before
we have had time to take any interest
in him, leaves us unmoved; and the
final scene (happily omitted at His
Majesty's) of the christening of baby
Elizabeth was the consummation of
a courtier rather than a dramatist.
Again, any study of HENRY was bound
to be imperfect which only shows us a
brace of his wives, and gives no hint of
that habit of re-marrying which be-
came an obsession with him; though I
admit that the introduction of the King
in his private box at Westminster Abbey,
watching the Coronation of . Queen
No. 2, does perhaps offer a suggestion
that this kind of thing was likely to
recur from time to time as a form
of . operatic entertainment peculiarly
adapted to his tastes.
And, since a poor play needs all
the accessories that it can get, we
must gratefully recognise that in their
illustrations of the manners, costumes
and architecture of the period, the
management has done all of us (not
excluding the author) a very true service.
Extraordinary pains have been taken
over the smallest detail, even down
to the lettering, T. C., which figures º º
on the livery of the urchins and other |\, .
menials in the retinue of the Cardinal.
(I am assured that T. C. stands for
Thomas, Cardinal, and not for TREE's

Sir HERBERT, in his crimson robe
that trailed half across the wide stage,
was a pageant in himself. Freed from
the managerial burdens of a first night,
he will do himself a finer justice; but
already his Cardinal's personality im-
poses itself. Miss VioleT WANBRUGH,
a splendid figure as QUEEN KATHARINE,
gave their full value to her lines,
and in the trial scene at Blackfriars
(an interior even more impressive
and dignified than that of our present
Divorce Court) touched a very high
level of dramatic force; but she had
begun, in the Council Chamber, on
rather too loud a note, and once or
twice made one think a little of her
namesake, the Shrew. To the tedious
scene of her final decline from power

you won't need to have them marked again.”
and health and happiness the old habit
of the irrepressible smile lent a faint
note of insincerity. Still, altogether, it
was a notable performance.
The most intriguing figure was that
of Mr. BourCHIER's HENRY VIII. I

public has been sufficiently tickled in
the gossip of the press, and just say

that the realism of his make-up was
amazing. His postures, too, were
astonishingly in the picture. And if
he left us a little in doubt how far his
hypocrisy went, and how much weak-
ness of purpose was hidden under his
bluff and masterful exterior, that, also,
was perhaps part of the game.
Mr. HENRY AINLEY, an obvious
choice for the rôle of BUCKINGHAM, did
not touch me very greatly, in part for
the reason, already given, that we have
no time to get into sympathy with him.
I was glad, for his sake, that he got off
so early; and disappointed, for his
sake again, to find that he had felt it
his duty to remain behind the scenes,
in his trappings of woe, so as to assist
at the final bow before the curtain.
Miss LAURA CowIE was an extremely
pretty and piquante ANNE BULLEN (sic,
please). I thought she used her glances
too freely at her first meeting with the
amorous Monarch; but I learn from
Sir HERBERT TREE's instructive little
brochure, Henry VIII. and his Court,
that in real life “she had the beckoning
eve.”
Finally, to Mr. Louis PARKER, Garter
King of Pageants, to Mr. PERCY MAC-
QUOID, specialist in antiquities, to Mr.
Edward GERMAN and his late Majesty
King HENRY VIII., who made the

difficult scenery, to Miss MARGARET

dance she arranged for the Banquet
Scene), and to SIR HERBERT TREE,
Moving Spirit and Overseer of All
Things, I give my warmest praise and
thanks. If I had had to choose
between dumb show with their de-
corative assistance, and all the talk
without it, I should not have hesitated
to say, “Cut the cackle and come to
the pageant l” O. S.
“THE ETERNAL QUESTION.”
AT the tense moment in the second
scene of the First Act, when David
Rossi (Hero and Leader of the Socialist
Party in the Italian Chamber of Depu-
ties) tells Donna Itoma Volonna the
romantic secret of his birth, I looked
down the list of runners in my pro-
gramme and tried to guess which one
of them would turn out to be his
missing father. There appeared to be
only two actual starters—Baron Bonelli

in the first scene, Roma announced her
intention of revenging herself on Rossi
by making him fall in love with her and
then spurning him (“Within a week
he will lie as tamely to my hand as a
ripe apple on a wall”), I knew she
would end by falling in love with him
herself. When Bruno Rocco took his
seven-year-old son to a mass meeting
of Socialists at the Coliseum (“Trust
me to take care of him, Sir. He 's the
apple of my eye”), I knew that Little
Joseph would be shot by the soldiers.
When, at the trial of Rossi for causing
a riot, a dagger was left carelessly on
the table within reach of the witness
| Bruno, I knew that he would kill
| somebody with it. He killed himself;
| and perhaps this was a little surprise,
for I was by way of marking down
Minghelli, the Secret Service agent,
| as the man we should lose. But at
moments like this one cannot think of
| everything—don't let us blame Bruno.
But I must tell you more about
Rossi. First, then, although he was
| the leader of the Socialist Party, he
had never been photographed. (What
| are the Roman ha'penny papers doing?)
| So when the police wanted him they
had no portrait to “despatch to the
Governor of every province in the
kingdom.” Stay ! The bust of him
which Donna Roma had been sculping !
“Never!” cries Roma, the woman
triumphing over the artist, and with
one blow of the mallet she breaks it
into fragments.

Good-bye (or, rather, “Addio") to Roma
after this, and goes away leaving his
cloak behind him (a thing one is always
doing), she says to Rossi, who has just
turned up, “Look—the Baron's cloak.
He was here and left it behind him,
and it's the very thing to see you
through the streets.” So Rossi effects
a complete disguise by putting it on,
and escapes at leisure. But the habit
grows on him. When Roma is in
prison charged with murdering the
Baron (he had threatened IRossi
with a pistol, and Rossi had knocked
his arm up and the pistol had gone
off–I suppose at the wrong end
—and killed the Baron), then Rossi
puts on the cloak of Father Pifferi,
deceives everybody again, and joins her.
So they are condemned (or acquitted—

FISH FOR ALL.
GREAT DEMONSTRATION.
A MonstER public meeting was held
on Friday at Fishmongers' Hall to pro-
mote the Consumption of Cheap Fish.
The Chair was taken by Mr. C. B. FRY,
who said that they were brought
together by a common devotion to a
great cause—a crusade on behalf of
Cheap Fish—in response to the clarion
call of Sir J. CRICHToN-BRowNE. It
might be remembered that not so long
ago that great hygienist had proclaimed
himself a whole-hearted believer in the
efficacy of chops. They were proud to
welcome him as a convert to and pro-
tagonist of the piscivorous propaganda.
The task before them was twofold.
They must first break down the snobbish
cult of expensive fish, notably the
salmon, the sole and the turbot, and
secondly they must strive to dispel the
foolish prejudice which had restricted
the consumption of equally nutritive
but less fashionable members of the
finny tribe, such as skate and conger-
eels.
Mr. GLUCKSTEIN, rising in the body
of the hall, protested against the per-
sonal tone of the Chairman's remarks,
but was promptly ruled out of order.
The Chairman having invited sug-
gestions from the audience, Mr. HAROLD
BEGBIE said that there was a great
deal in the movement that appealed to
him, especially the dethronement of the
salmon (renewed protests from Mr.
GLUCKSTEIN), that emblem of sybaritic
plutocracy, from its pride of place.
Further, as a convinced democrat he
wished to register his protest against
the continued use of the phrase, “Silly
kipper.” Kippers were not silly. They
were the wholesome food of the poor
but honest artisan, who, again, was the
backbone of the nation.
Mr. BRAM StokeR said that it was
impossible to write stories about Wam-
pires on a fish diet. He had tried it
when he was engaged on Dracula,
but was obliged to return instanter
to a carnivorous regimen. (Cries of
“Shame.”). Professional contortionists,
he added irrelevantly, were partial to
a diet of eels. (Interruption.)
Mr. FRANK T. BULLEN said that he
wished to put in a plea on behalf
of the whale. The extermination of
whales was going on fast enough
already without resort to whale meat
as an article of diet. He begged to
move that this massive and magnifi-
cent monster should be regarded as an
historical monument and excluded from
the list of fish recommended for whole-
sale consumption by the proletariate.
(Cheers.)
Sir FREDERICK Pollock here favoured
the meeting with a fine rendering of
“Caller Herrin',” accompanied on the
tromba marina by Sir DAVID GILL.
Mr. PIKE PEASE cordially endorsed
Sir J. CRICHToN-BRowNE's eulogy of
fried fish shops; but they wanted
a great Ichthyophagic Restaurant to
serve as the central rendezvous of the
movement, where meals should be con-
ducted to the sound of sea trumpets
in sight of a magnificent aquarium,
and where lectures should be delivered
by expert pisciculturists all day long. |
Why should vegetarians monopolise
all the occult and esoteric creeds? Let
the Ichthyophagists show that they
also could swim in the mid-stream of
transcendental mysticism.
LA LoIE FULLER, who desired to
associate herself with the humane
remarks which had fallen from Mr.
BULLEN, expressed a hope that a
similar immunity would be extended
to the sea serpent. LA Loie FULLER
added with much energy that it was
quite untrue that she had ever thought
of introducing a dance called the
Conger Reel.
Sir ARTHUR CoNAN Doyle entirely
agreed with the last speaker. Their
enthusiasm for fish food should be
tempered with discrimination. The
fact that sharks occasionally devoured
men was no reason why men should
eat sharks. He appealed to his brother-
novelists to take up the cause. The
consumption of cod had been enor-
mously increased by Mr. KIPLING's
Captains Courageous. Why could not
Sir ARTHUR QUILLER Couch render a
similar service to the Cornish pilchard,
or Mr. HALL CAINE to the Manx Cat-
fish 2 They had all of them enjoyed
reading The Sorrows of Satan. He
suggested as a suitable pendant The
Delights of the Devil Fish.
Miss DAISY BUCKTRout was then
escorted to the platform by Mr. GEorge
HADDOCK, and played a transcription
of Schub ERT's Die Forelle amid loud
applause.
Mr. RICHARD WHITEING said that he
was convinced the movement would
advance by leaps and bounds if they
started a newspaper specially devoted
to its furtherance. He said that he
thought it would be a mistake to
confine themselves to a single fish,
otherwise The Daily Whale, or, better
still, The Daily Scale, would be an
excellent title.
The Chairman, in a brief concluding
speech, thanked the speakers for ther
luminous and instructive suggestions,
and a motion was unanimously passed
inaugurating the Ichthyophagic League
for the promotion of the Cheap Fish ||
Crusade. -

SAME TO YOU ’’
RENOVATED DRAMA.
THE action of Mr. HALL CAINE in
producing a modernised version of his
masterpiece, The Eternal City, with
the dialogue brought down to date by
the introduction of references to “the
Socialist movement and the Woman
question,” has not unnaturally roused
great interest in theatrical circles. We
understand, on the most questionable
authority, that various other classics
of our dramatic literature are shortly
to undergo similar renovations as
below:—
It is reported that a feature of special
interest, in the next revival of Hamlet
in the West End, will be the introduc-
tion of an entirely new and topical
character, to be sustained by the now
well-known actor, whom music-hall
managers have learnt to appreciate as
“Mr. GEORGE.” This gentleman will
play a part similar to the one with which
his name is already associated—that of
a common informer, who, at the in-
stigation of King Claudius, confronts
Hamlet during the Play Scene, and
charges him with the production of an
unlicensed dramatic entertainment.
The subsequent dialogue has been
specially composed by a member of the
Managerial Association, and is said to
put forth the views of that body on the
subject of Sketches and the Compro-
mise, in an exceptionally able and
dramatic fashion.
Should the curtain rise upon Mr.
SEYMoUR Hicks's long-threatened pro-
duction of Richard III., we are in-
formed that playgoers may look forward
to an altogether uncommon treat, in
the form of a blank-verse monologue
by the chief character on the subject
of Poor Law Reform. Those who have
hitherto known Mr. Hicks rather as a
comedian than a lecturer on social
problems will doubtless be astonished
at the power of his delivery of this
trenchantly dramatic and polemical
novelty. -
A tremendous success is anticipated
for that distinguished and go-ahead
tragedian, Mr. Barnes-Stormer, in his
forthcoming revival of The Lady of
Lyons; late-special edition. The scene
in Claude's cottage, including as it
does some exquisite and original lines
on the subject of small holdings and
the French system of intensive culture,
is stated to be a distinct and welcome
improvement on the play as hitherto
presented. The climax of emotional
interest, however, is now found in the
scene between the hero and the
ruffianly Land Valuers, which for com-
bined pathos, passion, and political
instruction is stated to be without its
equal on the modern stage.
Certain critics have long held that
the great drawback to The School for
Scandal as a paying proposition was
a lack of actuality in the subjects
discussed by the characters. We are
happy to learn that this defect is in
process of removal, and that for its
next revival at the Victoria. Theatre
SHE RIDAN's snappy little comedy
will be thoroughly brought into line
with modern requirements. It is
confidently expected that the scene in
Lady Sneerwell's drawing-room, the
dialogue of which has been entrusted
to the able hands of the editor of a
well-known sporting weekly and a
memoir-writing peeress, will draw all
London. Further details it would be
obviously unfair at this juncture to
disclose; but, when we mention that a
special department of the box office
has been instituted to deal with the
expected pressure of libel-writs and
injunctions, our readers will be assured
that the promised revival will be of a
thoroughly interesting and poignant
character.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
STEvenson said (or quoted somebody else as saying) of
WILLIAM BLACK's novels that they ought to be read three
times: once for the story, once for the fishing, and once
for the sunsets. How many times a novel by MEREDITH
should be read I would not dare to say : once for the
shining spirit which breathed life into it, and twice for
that, and three times—well, I only know that I have not
lived with Celt and Saron (CoNSTABLE) long enough yet
to appraise it rightly. It is only a fragment, little more
than a quarter, I should say, of what it was to be; but
there are chapters which it is like a home-coming to
meet. “The Dinner Party”—how often the bodily refresh-
ment of his characters has gone to the spiritual refresh-
ment of his readers; never more pleasantly than in
foil to a collection of the most charming people, among
whom, though he was a bit of a prig and on the heavy
side, we must include Sir George, if only because he
withdrew his objection just in time. And Mrs. CLIFFORD's
scenes are made as lovable as her characters. The
little village by the Italian lake, where nearly every-
body in the book occurs at one time or another, should be
the goal of many pilgrimages next season. Will she please
let us know the real address? We won't spoil the place,
but we should just like, between two boats, to take that
walk up to “the other country.” Meanwhile we are deep
in her debt for a clean, sweet story, good for all whose
hearts are young and their brains not too exigently analytic.
To contrast Belgravia with Whitechapel and do full
justice to both is a heavy responsibility; it has been a
little too much for Mr. ARTHUR APPLIN. But with White-
chapel he has been successful, and Bill, the Terror of
this chapter. “The Great Mr.
Bull”—dare I begin to quote
from that ? “Then with one
big bellow, the collapse of
pursiness, he abandons his
pedestal of universal critic;
prostrate he falls to the
foreigner; he is down, he is
roaring; he is washing his
hands of English performances,
lends ear to foreign airs,
patronises foreign actors,
browses on reports from camps
of foreign armies. He drops his
head like a smitten ox to all
great foreign names, moaning
‘Shakespeare!' internally for a

written thirty, forty years ago!
Well, just so many years ago
the story was given up; what
it would have been and why
given up are things now only
to wonder over. Would Adiante
have taken her place with
Clara and Carinthia, Dahlia
London, is worth knowing.
“They well forgot,” is his
own account of himself to the
Salvationists, “ter give me a
soul when they made me.
They only give me a halmighty
thirst.” Lady Letty Lumley,
on the other hand, was as
clever as she was beautiful, and
a little bit more virtuous still.
Every one adored her: and the
Whitechapelites, including Bill,
fell at her feet in a mass when
she went down to live and work
among them. She will leave
the average reader compara-
tively cold; a little virtue one
can stand, but her perfection is
intolerable. With the plot of
Rags (F. W. WHITE) I hardly
dare bore you. Suffice it that
there is pathos in excess when
the West goes forth to visit the
East, and a dastardly burglary
when the East returns the call.

with Philip 2 “‘Philip, I've

and so she just half swoons, enough to show how the dear
angel looks in her sleep: a trick of kindness these heavenly
women have that we heathen may get a peep of their
secret rose-enfolded selves; and dream's no word, nor
drunken, for the blessed mischief it works with us.”
My sole objection to Sir George's Objection (NELSoN), by
Mrs. W. K. CLIFFoRD, is that the title is a little ponderous,
and that Sir George does not begin objecting till p. 382.
Otherwise I have nothing but praise for a book of great
charm and brightness, with just one long shadow thrown
by the past to give quality to its sunshine. Mrs. CLIFFord
does not trouble her nice head about any literary style in
particular; she simply goes straight on where her heart
and her good sense direct her, and never misses the way.
Of subtlety there is no pretence; but her characters and
her delightfully garrulous dialogues are the very duplicate
of life. The author's freshest study is that of a dépaysée
American who intrudes herself at every turn with the
happiest results. One lonely villain (female) has to serve as
and humorous in the book, that
you would be well advised to forgive the plot and Lady
Letty, and make yourself familiar with the worst side and
the best side of a London slum.

All others that were ever made;

A sympathy with such creations,
Can conjure up a limitless

It seems so very easy, yet
Most airship stories come to grief,
Because their authors quite forget
That there are bounds to one's belief;
So, since GEORGE GLENDON knows just where
Credulity may come a cropper,
I say The Emperor of the Air
(From METHUEN) is a real tip-topper.

TO AN UNKNOWN DEER
(SoMEwhere Above THE HEAD of Loch FYNE).
KING of the treeless forest, lo, I come!
This is to let you have the welcome news
That you will shortly hear my bullet's hum
Shatter Argyll amid her mountain-dews;
Will hear, from hill to hill, its rumour fly
To startle (if the wind be not contráry)
The tripper gathering picture-postcards by
The pier at Inveraray.
This is your funeral, my friend, not mine,
So play the game, for slackness I abhor;
Give me a broadside target, large and fine,
A hundred paces off—don't make it more;
If in a sitting posture when we meet,
You mustn't think of moving ; stay quite steady;
Or (better) rise, and standing on your feet
Wait there till I am ready.
Lurk not in hollows where you can't be found,
Or let the local colour mock my search ;
But take the sky-line; choose the sort of ground
That shows you up as obvious as a church ;
Don't skulk among your hinds, or use for scouts
The nimble progeny of last year's harem
To bring reports upon my whereabouts
In case I chance to scare 'em.
If I should perforate you in a place
Not strictly vital, but from that rude shock
Death must ensue, don't run and hide your face,
But let me ease you with another knock;
And if, by inadvertence, I contrive
Initially to miss you altogether,
Stand till I empty out my clip of five,
Or make you bite the heather.
As for your points, I take a snobbish view:
I dearly love a stag of Royal stuff;
But, if a dozen 's more than you can do,
Ten (of the best) will suit me well enough ;
As for your weight, I want a bulky beast,
That I may win a certain patron's benison,
Loading his board, to last a week at least,
With whiffy slabs of venison.
Finally, be a sportsman ; try to play
Your part in what should prove a big success;
Let me repeat—don't keep too far away;
My distance is a hundred yards (or less);
So, ere the eager gillies ope your maw,
I'll say, in tones to such occasions proper,
The while I drink your death in usquebagh,
“He is indeed a topper ' "
Nor shall that sentence be your sole reward;
Our mutual prowess in the fatal Glen
Your headpiece, stuffed and mounted, shall record
And be the cynosure of envious men;
And when they see that segment of the bag,
And want the tale again and I must tell it,
I'll say how stoutly, like a well-bred stag,
You stopped the soft-nosed pellet. O. S.

Quite right too.
H.I.M. THE EMPEROR OF AMERICA.
Ertracts from “The Times,” October 4, 1910.
(By Marconi Special Service from our own Correspondent.)
New York, October 3.
This morning Mr. Roosevelt, by a daring coup de
main, overturned the republican institutions under which
these States have existed for one hundred and thirty-four
years, possessed himself of the supreme executive power,
and was promptly proclaimed Emperor of America. This
astounding revolution has so far been unaccompanied by
any effusion of blood. The secret, though it must have
been known to hundreds of conspirators, had been well
kept, and the strong measures taken by his Imperial
Majesty and his friends paralysed any spirit of resistance
that might otherwise have manifested itself. At 5 a.m.
the White House was surrounded by a strong detachment
of Rough Riders, and Mr. TAFT and his family were
arrested in their beds. They were subsequeſtly conveyed
to an unknown destination. At the same time the Vice-
President and the members of the Cabinet were seized and
imprisoned. The chiefs of the Army and the Navy have
already sworn allegiance to the new Sovereign. At 10 a.m.,
his Majesty, attended by the Princes of the Imperial House
and accompanied by a brilliant staff, rode through the streets
of Washington amid deafening popular acclamations.
Halting before the Capitol, he made an impassioned speech,
calling on all those who valued stability of government
and believed in his policies to rally round his throne and
person. He had, he said, entrusted the preservation of
public order to the Editorial Board of The Outlook and
any complaints must be addressed to them, though for his
part he could not conceive that any loyal subject would
want to complain of anything. The great policy of Con-
servation would now be carried out. His Majesty concluded
by saying that he was having a bully time.
Later.
The New York American, in a special edition published
at mid-day, calls upon the people to rise against the
usurper. Mr. HEARST has been arrested, and will be tried
on a charge of treason. Mr. W. J. BRYAN, in an inter-
view, declares that he has suspected the EMPEROR from the
beginning. The triumph of the Democrats, he thinks, is
now assured. The Evening Post denounces the EMPEROR
as an unscrupulous prevaricator, and declares that no self-
respecting American can consent to bow the knee to Baal.
The office of the paper has since been destroyed by an
infuriated mob. Mr. RocKEFELLER has taken refuge in a
church and refuses to come out. The EMPEROR is now en-
gaged in composing a message of 100,000 words strongly
affirming both the Monroe Doctrine and his own right to
the Imperial crown. As soon as the message has been
delivered Congress is to adjourn for an indefinite period.
Seen at 3 o'clock, the EMPEROR said that if he had known
what a bully thing a revolution was he would have started
in much sooner. The order for the manufacture of the
Imperial crown has been entrusted to Messrs. TIFFANY. It
is to cost a million dollars, and is to be bigger and more
brilliant than any other crown in existence.
From “The Spectator,” October 8, 1910.
We cannot pretend to be surprised by the news which
has reached us from America this week. That Mr. Roose-
VELT (if we may be pardoned for speaking of him by a
name which is now merged in a more splendid and, we
believe, a more appropriate title) should have assumed the
Imperial purple cannot startle anyone who has made him-

self conversant, as we have endeavoured to do, with the
tendencies of American public life and the opinions of
American public men, especially of Mr. Roosevelt himself.
There can be no harm now in saying that during his recent
visit to this country Mr. Roosevelt (as he then was)
expressed to a few intimate friends his contempt for all
non-despotic systems of government. He thought that
when America managed to shake off Republican institu-
tions men of sense and honest capacity would come by
their own. That was his ideal, and he could not help
feeling—the expression was his own—that it was a bully
ideal.
We cordially congratulate his Imperial Majesty and his
loyal subjects on what has taken place. We are amongst
those who believe that his Majesty is, with perhaps the
exception of the Archbishop of CANTERBURY and Mr.
WILLIAM HIGGINBOTHAM, the greatest and strongest and
most statesmanlike man in existence. Since we need the
Archbishop for the work of the Church of England, and
since Mr. HIGGINBoth AM continues to devote himself ex-
clusively to the fight against Socialism in Balham, Mr.
Roosevelt was obviously the only man who was both
sufficiently just and sufficiently tenacious for the great
office of Emperor of AMERICA. It is just this quality of
tenacity (on the importance of which we have so fre-
quently insisted) that marks the latest Emperor off from
those who may well be proud to consider themselves his
fellow-men. We shall continue to watch his Majesty's
career with that benevolent and admiring interest which
is due to one whose purpose, we believe, will be to bind
the sister Empires of Great Britain and America in bonds
that cannot be torn asunder.
Things One Ought to have been Told Before.
“Yout First DANCE will be a genuine triumph if you attend the
function possessing a Set of Artificial Teeth designed by --. Man
ballroom devotees attribute their success to a visit to the -- Teeth
Depot.”
TO A FOX-CUB.
YoU stole through the hedgerow's high tangle of bramble,
You knew of the gap by the hazel-tree's trunk,
As sharp as a needle, as red as a CAMPBELL,
Surprised, very likely, but not in a funk;
Demure as a kitten, yet wise and hard-bitten,
You pricked a keen ear to the crash in the scrub,
Where Grateful and Glitter had stirred up the litter,
O bandit beginner—O cool little cub'
You went like a dream, yet an eye of cold yellow
You cocked in a crafty but confident glance,
As much as to tell me, “Now, be a good fellow,
Say nothing about it and give us a chance;
Those lashing white ladies can gallop like Hades,
They'd slate me—at present—in less than a mile;
I'm small, I'm a baby, sit quiet, and maybe
I'll live to reward you with something worth while !”
Discreetly I watched you dive under the double;
I moved not an eyelid, I give you my word;
If out of the belt by the ten-acre stubble
A jay screamed a menace, well, nobody heard;
For far in the whinnygreen depths of the spinney
A brother, ill-fated, was biting the mud,
Borne down in a flurry of furies that worry
And bristle and clamour for blood, and for blood!
And so it's a bargain, my boy, you'll remember;
Some day we shall ask you to settle the bill,
Some soft, misty day in a distant December,
When you, a great dog-fox, glide out down the hill:
They'll find you by noonlight, and run you till moonlight,
And I would be with them the whole of the day,
By brook and by village, by grass-land and tillage,
To lose you, or eat you, three counties away !

HOLIDAY TIME.
IV.—IN THE WET.
MYRA gazed out of the window upon
the driving rain and shook her head
at the weather.
“Ugh !” she said. “Ugly "
“Beast,” I added, in order that there
should be no doubt about what we
thought. “Utter and deliberate beast.”
We had arranged for a particularly
pleasant day. We were to have sailed
across to the mouth of the I always
forget its name, and then up the river
to the famous old castle of -of
No, it's gone again; but anyhow, there
was to have been a bathe in the river,
and lunch, and a little exploration in
the dinghy, and a lesson in the Morse
code from Simpson, and tea in the
woods with a real fire, and in the cool
of the evening a ripping run home
before the wind. But now the only
thing that seemed certain was the cool
of the evening.
“We'll light a fire and do something
indoors,” said Dahlia.
“This is an extraordinary house,”
said Archie. “There isn't a single
book in it, except a lot of Strand
Magazines for 1907. That must have
been a very wet year.”
“We can play games, dear.”
“True, darling. Let's do a charade.”
“The last time I played charades,”
I said, “I was HoRATIUs, the front part
of ELIZABETH's favourite palfrey, the
arrow which shot RUFUs, JonAH, the
two little Princes in the Tower, and
Mrs. PANKHURST.”
“Which was your favourite part 2"
asked Myra.
“The front part of the palfrey. But
I was very good as the two little
Princes.”
“It's no good doing charades, if
there's nobody to do them to.”
“Thomas is coming to-morrow,”
said Myra. “We could tell him all
about it.”
“Clumps is a jolly good game,”
suggested Simpson.
“The last time I was a clump,” I
said, “I was the first coin paid on
account of the last pair of boots,
sandals, or whatnot of the man who
laid the first stone of the house where
lived the prettiest aunt of the man who
reared the goose which laid the egg
from which came the goose which
provided the last quill pen used by the
third man SHAKSPEARE met on the
second Wednesday in June, 1595.”
“He mightn't have had an aunt,”
said Myra after a minute's profound
thought.
“He hadn't.”
“Well, anyhow, one way and another
you've had a very adventurous career,
my lad,” said Archie. “What hap-
pened the last time you played Ludo?”
“When I played clumps,” put in
Simpson, “I was the favourite spoke of
HALLCAINE’s first bicycle. They guessed
HALL CAINE and the bicycle and the
spoke very quickly, but nobody thought
of suggesting the favourite spoke.”
Myra went to the window again, and
came back with the news that it would
probably be a fine evening.
“Thank you,” we all said.
“But I wasn't just making conver-
sation. I have an idea.”
“Silence for Myra's idea.”
“Well, it's this. If we can’t do
anything without an audience, and if
the audience won't come to us, let's
go to them.”
“Be a little more lucid, there's a
dear. It isn't that we aren't trying.”
“Well then, let's serenade the other
houses about here to-night.”
There was a powerful silence while
everybody considered this. -
“Good,” said Archie at last. “We
Will.”
The rest of the morning and all the
afternoon were spent in preparations.
Archie and Myra were all right; one
plays the banjo and the other the
guitar. (It is a musical family, the
Mannerings.) Simpson keeps a cornet
which he generally puts in his bag,
but I cannot remember anyone asking
him to play it. If the question has
ever arisen, he was probably asked not
to play it. However, he would bring
it out to-night. In any case he has
a tolerable voice; while Dahlia has
always sung like an angel. In short,
I was the chief difficulty.
“I suppose there wouldn't be time to
learn the violin 2'' I asked.
“Why didn't they teach you some-
thing when you were a boy?” wondered
yra.
“They did. But my man forgot to
put it in my bag when he packed. He
put in two toothbrushes and left out
the triangle. Do you think there's a
triangle shop in the village 2 I gener-
ally play on an isosceles one, any two
sides of which are together greater than
the third. Likewise the angles which
are opposite to the adjacent sides, each
to each.”
“Well, you must take the yachting
cap round for the money.”
“I will. I forgot to say that my own
triangle at home, the Strad, is in the
chromatic scale of A, and has a splice.
It generally gets the chromatics very
badly in the winter.”
While the others practised their
songs, I practised taking the cap
round, and by tea-time we all knew
our parts perfectly. I had received
permission to join in the choruses, and
I was also to be allowed to do a little
dance with Myra. When you think
that I had charge of the financial
arrangements as well, you can under-
stand that I felt justified in considering
myself the leader of the troupe.
“In fact,” I said, “you ought to
black your faces so as to distinguish
yourselves from me.”
“We won't black our faces,” said
Dahlia, “but we’ll wear masks; and
we might each carry a little board
explaining why we're doing this.”
“Right,” said Archie; and he sat
down and wrote a notice for himself:
“I am an orphan. So are the others,
but they are not so orphan as I am. I
am eactremely frequent.”
Dahlia said:
“We are doing this for an advertise-
ment. If you like us, send a shilling for
a free sample concert, mentioning this
paper. Your money back if we are not
satisfied with it.”
Simpson announced:
“World's Long Distance Cornetist.
Holder of the Oboe Record on Grass.
Runner-up in the Ocarina Welter
Weights (strangle hold barred). Mired
Zither Champion (1907. Covered courts).
Myra said:
“Kind friends, help us. We were
wrecked this afternoon. The cornet was
sinking for the third time when it was
rescued, and had to be brought round by
artificial respiration. Can you spare
us a drink of water 2"
As for myself I had to hand the
Simpson yachting cap round, and my
notice said:
“We want your money. If you can-
not give us any, for Heaven's sake keep
the cap.”
We had an early dinner, so as to be
in time to serenade our victims when
they were finishing their own meal and
feeling friendly to the world. Then we
went upstairs and dressed. Dahlia
and Myra had kimonos, Simpson put
on his dressing-gown, in which he
fancies himself a good deal, and Archie
and I wore brilliantly coloured pyjamas
over our other clothes.
“Let’s see,” said Simpson, “I start
off with ‘The Minstrel Boy, don't I?
And then what do we do?”
“Then we help you to escape,” said
Archie. “After that, Dahlia sings
‘Santa Lucia, and Myra and I give
them a duet, and if you're back by
then with your false nose properly
fixed it might be safe for you to join
in the chorus of a coon song. Now
then, are we all ready ?”
“What's that?” said Myra.
We all listened . . . and then we
opened the door.
It was pouring. A. A. M.

“sigHTFUL" switzERLAND.
I HAD been reading KEATs, and a
desire to “sit upon an Alp as on a
throne” brought me to Switzerland
for a holiday.
The “throne,” so far, has been a
basket-chair in the glass verandah of
the “Kulm Hotel,” and it is surrounded
by other thrones of the kind, filled to
overflowing with people of German
persuasion. I have sat upon it now
for seven days—watching the falling
rain.
By now I am soul-sick of my throne
and these eternal “Ja, ja's,” and want a
change. I take up my Hotels und Berg-
bahnen der Schweiz—with an English
translation, “Hotels and Mountain Rail-
ways of the Switzerland,” and begin
my search. I have only turned a leaf
or two when I begin to be cheerful. I
even laugh as I go further to think of
all the delightful places there are in the
world. -
There is that hotel in Rheinfelden—
“On elevated terrace oft the town in
nice peasant, and from rough winds
protected situation, with friendly gar-
dens and shadowy parcs, Modernst
furnished it has the agreeable of a com-
fortable cure place. It contains 70
friendly noble fitted rooms and saloons
(the greatest part of it with wide sight
at the charming Rhine valley and the
Schwarzwald, many of these with
sightful balconies) comfortable accept-
ance for 100 guests. Pleasant resort
during day-heat offers the shadowy
linden-alley before the Hotel with great
stalactite grotto and beautiful garden-
grounds with garden hall and next to
it forest-park till to the Rhine. For
the youth are Play and Gymnase-
places, croquets, lawn-tennis and run
about. From June to October there
are concerts of the cure-music.” The
only drawback is that “Terms vary
after choice of rooms,” and I like to
know where I am at the time.
So perhaps I shall go to Aarau.
There “A game-parc with numerous
beasts in the utmost idillic small valley
is situated 15 minutes from the town,”
and I am so fond of beasts. But I am
also much interested in geology and
feel drawn to another place where
“The richdom of shapes of these
caverns is not to be thought greater.
Besides animal like forms as crocodile,
turtle, stone eagle and bear, there hang
tender fruits and plants as grapes,
sponges, moss and racine petrifica-
tions.”
Why, though, should I not be
diverted as well as instructed? Why
not go to Baden—which is “The centre
of amusing bath-life. In the best pos-
sible situation, free around, the Hotel
** FATHER."
“IT SAYS HERE, ‘A MAN Is KNowN by The company HE KEEPs.”
“YEs, YEs, YES.”
“WELL, FATHER, IF A Good MAN KEEPs company witH A BAD MAN, is the good MAN
BAD BECAUSE HE KEEPs company witH The BAD MAN, AND Is The BAD MAN Good BECAUSE
HE KEEPS COMPANY WITH THE GOOD MAN ?”
“WELL, what Is IT "
Is That so, FATHER!”
has an embracing sight at the charming
and by age honourable town of Bath
and the changing country.” Well, I
am unreasonably nervous, I suppose,
but I do like the country to be fixed
and not keep on changing.
Davos Dorf might be possible. “The
Hotel lies in finest and viewfullest
place opposite to the post office and
railway station. The newly built Westi-
bule with an artful wall of natural
wood, is worth to be seen and offers to
the guests an agreeable staying. The
hotel not being . adopted for health
resort of ills or phtisics, is only pre-
served for the sojourn of passengers,
tourists and sportsmen.”
I wish to see that artful wall of
natural wood; but here, in Ragatz, is
something more practically seductive:
“House of old renowned reputation
offers all desirable comfort. Large
dining and society - halls, extended
shadowy garden, 100 beautifully four-
nished foreigner-rooms, with 145 re-
nowned good beds. Excellent cooking
as well as only genuine wines.”
That takes me quite. I have no
idea where Ragatz is; but it seems to
contain all that man could sigh for.
No wine that isn't wine, renowned
good beds, and—before and beyond all
—“special rooms for foreigners!" I
shall go to Ragatz.

WHO WAS DICKENS 3
THE LATEST LITERARY SENSATION.
THE day having come when all think-
ing men are agreed that people have
had rather more than they want of the
problem as to the authorship of the
plays of SHAKSPEARE, we hasten to
put before the public a literary mystery
more in touch with modern times.
It will come as a surprise to many
to learn that the novels commonly
attributed to CHARLES DICKENs came
from no less a pen than that of SAMUEL
Johnson. At least we sincerely hope
it will.
The main difficulty in the search for
the real authorship of the “Dick ENs "
novels is that of deciding where to
begin, but a little thought will soon
overcome this. The Pickwick Papers,
as being different in form from any of
the other works, suggests itself as the
key to the mystery, and so, on investi-
gation, it proves.
The attentive reader of The Pickwick
Papers can hardly fail to be struck by
the fact that both Mr. Pickwick and
his servant have the same Christian
name. “Surely,” he will soliloquize,
“this is more than an example of the
adage, “Like master, like man,’” and
he will be right. It is more—much
more. We would even say very much
In Ore.
Supposing you write down the con-
sonants of the English alphabet in
a column and let B equal one, C
equal two, and so on. The consonants
in Pickwick will add up to a total of
fifty, and so, too, will those in Weller.
At once we see a design in this
apparent coincidence. We know that
we are working on the right lines, and
it is a reasonable assumption that the
author's real name will likewise add
up to fifty. Does DickFNs 2 It don't;
not even with CHARLEs thrown in.
But now let us go back to the
Christian name. Why “Samuel "?
Obviously because the author was fond
of the name. It cannot have been that
of his fiancée. We are therefore driven
to the conclusion that it was his own
name; in fact, that the real author
was called “Samuel.”
All that remains now is to find an
author whose name was “Samuel,”
and a glance at the dictionary at once
suggests JoHNSON. Now comes the
thrill ! J stands for seven, H for
six, N for eleven, and S for fifteen.
Total thirty-nine (loud groans). But
what about the second N ? Another
eleven and we have the magic number
fifty.
Having thus proved that Johnson
was “Dick ENs,” we find a confirma-
tion of the fact staring us right in the
face, thus proving once more that the
obvious is the best hiding-place. The
title-page of the key-book runs, “The
Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick
Club.” Johnson was undoubtedly
dead when it appeared, and the papers
were admittedly posthumous. You
thought it was the club that was dead.
King Arthur's Bounty.
“C596 now paid for triplets by Pear-
son's Weekly.”

passing of the street bylaw, that all vehicles
on Columbia street be required to keep to the
left going up and to the right going down.”—

ideas like this.

IF I allow myself twenty minutes to
dress for dinner, I am five minutes late.
If I allow myself half-an-hour, I am
ten minutes late. That is the maked
truth, though I cannot explain it. To-
night I allowed myself a good hour,
and there was every prospect of my
never getting to the Johnsons' at all.
It was partly the stud's fault and
partly Mr. CYRIL MAUDE's. You know
all about studs and very likely do not
wish to be reminded of their malice,
out of business hours.
You know all
about Mr. CYRIL MAUDE, but you have
never seen my imitation of him. No
one ever has. It is reserved for privacy
and my mirror, and I may tell you
that it is just about perfect. To-night,
I was starting upon a new stick of a
new sort of shaving soap, and the
directions said:—“This soap will pro-
duce a rich, creamy lather, if spoken
to nicely. In order to soften the beard
and secure a perfect shave, allow a
short interval to elapse between the
lathering and the application of the
razor.” I gave it its interval and
amused myself meanwhile with the
imitation. The rich, creamy lather on
my cheeks gave it just that touch of
humour and pathos needed to make it
perfect, and the performance, owing to
the frequent encores, took much longer
than it ought to have done. In fact,
when I had finished shaving there
were about 25% minutes in which
to complete my toilet and get to
Knightsbridge by eight o'clock; ten
minutes to finish dressing, five to get
to the Tube, five to Knightsbridge,
five to the Johnsons' flat (wherever
it was exactly), and half a minute for
general purposes. The thing could
just be done.
What with one thing (miscalcula-
tion) and another (further imitations,
full-dress rehearsal) it was five minutes
past eight when I got to the Tube.
“What I want,” I said, as I ap-
proached the booking-office, “is a good
excuse,” but they only gave me a ticket,
and left me to it. Whether it was the
ozone of the underworld or mere per-
sonal ability, it is not for me to say,
but I eventually found myself in the
higher regions of Knightsbridge, with
the most perfect excuse of modern times
at my fingers' ends. It ran as follows:—
“I am deeply Fº to be so late,
the more so as I am a man of the
strictest punctuality. Acting in ac-
cordance with my own insistent prin-
ciples, I started dressing in good time
this evening, and avoided with scru-
pulous care any digressions or distrac-
tions which might involve the least
risk of procrastination. Dressed and
prepared to start a quarter of an hour
before I needed, I set forth at once-in
this direction. I remember meeting a
clock which informed me that I was
vastly in advance of schedule time.
‘However,' I recollect saying to myself,
“it is better to be early than late or
never,’ and so I arrived at Knights-
bridge more than punctually. What
was my chagrin to discover that I had
left your letter of invitation at home,
on which alone I relied for your exact
address'
You will recall in my favour
that I have never been here before.”
(Here they were to be at liberty to
interrupt, and say something about
coming again.) “I knew you lived in
Knightsbridge, and I believed it was at
3, or 33, or 333, Rutland something.
But that was not good enough. There
was nothing for it but to return and
get the letter, and, blaming myself for
a slip for which, though it was perhaps
excusable, I could not excuse myself, I
did so return, and hence the delay.
Please do not apologise.”
After all, it was only 8.15, and that
seemed an excuse quite long enough for
the time involved. “So now,” I said,
feeling in my pockets for the all-impor-
tant letter, “now for their address.”
You are quite right. I had forgotten
the letter.

A WERY PROPER CRITICISM.
SIR,--I found in The Times the other day a letter signed
by a Toronto gentleman, asking for assistance in the
editing of the reminiscences of the late Professor GoLDw1N
SMITH. The writer particularly requires information con-
cerning a number of names, which he copies out, remarking
that his excuse must be that he is 3,000 miles from the
British Museum Reading Room and the Bodleian. Now,
Sir, these two institutions are some sixty miles apart, and
any place in the Western Hemisphere to be equidistant from
both would have to be much nearer the Equator than Toronto.
As a matter of fact, Toronto is practically in a line with them,
and thus, if it is 3,000 miles from Oxford it must be 3,060
miles from London, or if 3,000 miles from London it is only
2,940 from Oxford. Such looseness of phrase I cannot but
think extremely deplorable in any one proposing to superin-
tend the publication of Professor Goldwin SMITH's Memoirs.
I enclose my card, and am Yours, etc., North BRITON.

PALFREY'S TORTOISE.
(An Afterthought.—Concluded from p. 78.)
Synopsis of previous chapter. The characters
of the story are (1) the Tortoise; (2) Palfrey, of
whom very little is known except that he
worked hard to keep a roof over the tortoise
(except when it was in the garden) and that he
never took any exercise, except with a paper
knife; (3 to 5, both inclusive) Carsill, Dumbell
and Bewster, Golf maniacs in the same office as
Palfrey; (6) the Narrator, known as I or Me,
º, to his place in the sentence. Palfrey
at first led me to understand that he had taken
the Tortoise home as an act of
as Vernon has never shown any affec-
tion for me—"
“Why should he 2 " Carsill asked.
“What have you done for him 2"
“More than you know about,” Pal-
frey answered. “I spent eighteenpence
last week in recovering him from the
Cleansing Department. When I saw
him last on Monday night he was
asleep on a heap of rubbish. He did
not meet me as usual on my way from
the station on Tuesday evening, and,
showed no special attachment to me,
|and so I've got another tortoise to be
company for him.”
“Did they show any signs of anima-
tion when they first met 2" asked
Dumbell.
“Vernon did. As soon as Gertrude
came into his garden he ran at full
speed to the lettuce-bed—five yards in
twenty-five minutes. Gertrude turned
away, went slowly through the first
hoop on the croquet lawn, missed the
charity. Then he pretended that
he had acquired it to kill slugs,
with two hours off every day as a
paperweight ; but his real purpose
was to be able to talk Tortoise,
while Carsill, Dumbell and Bewster
talked Golf.
SUDDENLY the whole course
of Palfrey's existence was
altered by a circular from the
Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. It
must have read my former
chapter. It did not send him
a threatening letter or an
inspector, but just a nicely
printed circular emphasising
the fact that tortoises do not
eat beetles, or other insects,
and that they are natural
vegetarians, though without
any fads about Jaeger under-
vests. Palfrey read us pieces
from the circular, and seemed
a good deal upset by it.
“I hate to misjudge any-
body,” he explained. “Here
have I been blaming Vernon,
in my own mind, for not
killing beetles, slugs and |
other insects, and for taking
his whack of lettuces. And all
the time he was a vegetarian.
and knew insects were bad
for him, and would make
him unfit for his work.”
“His what? asked Bew-
ster.
“His work,” Palfrey an-
swered. “I don't quite know
what it is. The circular says
nothing on that point. But

second rather badly, and went

“You’ll get a lot of fun out
of their respective peculiar-
ities,” said Bewster, kindly.
“So I thought up to this
morning. I thought that
their idiosyncrasies would
afford me endless amuse-
ment, and might even enable
me to give the N.S.P.C.A.
some tips for a new circular.
But that can never be now.”
“Why not ? Have they
wiped one another out
already?”
“No,” said Palfrey, wist-
fully; “but I forgot to gum
a label on Gertrude before I
turned her loose, and now I
can't tell her from Vernon.”
Self Help.
“This season and several
others were run by Miss
THOMPson and Mr. MACKIN-

success,” writes a theatrical
correspondent to The Daily
Mail. We thought Mr.

to do with it; this season
must have been a roaring
success for him. But we
hope he won't try to run

for some purpose.”
“Nobody could afford to employ
him,” Bewster objected, “if he was
entitled to time - and - a - half for over-
time. And at piecework he would fall
below the living wage, and come on
the rates, with his wife and family.”
“That reminds me,” said Palfrey.
“I used to think him too reticent and
almost unsociable. And this circular
says that he is “capable of strong
feelings of attachment.’”
“What to ?” asked Dumbell.
“The circular does not explain. But
when I got home he had disappeared,
and so had the rubbish heap. I had
to hire six boys, at threepence a hour,
to go through all the stuff lifted by the
Cleansing Department that day.”
“They found him, I suppose 2"
Carsill asked.
“No, I found him under a large
flower-pot in the garden shed. No-
body had put him there. He must
either have crept in under one edge,
without upsetting the flower-pot, or
else got inside it when it stood upright,
and then swung the flower-pot over on
himself. But as I was saying, he

THE PUFF PRELIMINARY.
(With acknowledgments to the Press Agent of
the Beecham Opera Company.)
Forthcoming PRODUCTION OF HERR
PHILIBERT's “ToxiN.”
IT is now generally known that the
plot of Herr Philibert's Torin, which
will be heard for the first time in
London on November 9, is substantially
the same as that of Scalavaggio's
terrific melodrama, Tossico, performed
last year by the Calabrian players with
such cataclysmic results.
In Torin, as in Tossico, there are a
Prologue and two Acts. The scene of
the Prologue is laid amid the verdant
glades of the Apennines, where in the
small hours of the morning two young
chemist's assistants are discovered en-
gaged in pharmaceutical conversation.
Beppo, a genial young Hercules,
regrets his enslavement to the gallipots,
while Gian Galeazzo, a saturnine
cynic, dilates on the tremendous powers
which a knowledge of toxicology places
at their disposal.
Both the young men are in the
service of Malatesta Spaghetti, the
prosperous owner of a drug store in the
beautiful town of Polenta.
The Prologue closes with Gian
Galeazzo proposing to poison Malatesta
and forge a will leaving the business
to his two assistants.
In the First Act, the scene of which
is laid in the town of Polenta, Beppo's
marriage with Gemma, the widow of
Malatesta, has just taken place, and
the streets are gay with a profusion of
bunting. The townsfolk have all as-
sembled to celebrate the event; Gian
Galeazzo has been the best man, and
the wedding presents, upwards of four
hundred in number, have been both
costly and elegant.
The townsfolk depart. Night comes
on, and as Gemma and her husband
are sitting down to their supper Gian
Galeazzo enters the room stealthily and
stabs Beppo in the back. On Gemma's
asking him, in frantic accents, “Why
did you do that ?" he replies, “Be-
cause he poisoned your first husband.”
Gemma is at first staggered by this
awful news, but, rapidly recovering her-
self, fells the assassin with a flask of
Chianti and falls senseless, while a
number of the townsfolk sing a mocking
serenade to the bride and bridegroom.
The final Act is brief and soul-
shaking. Gemma has been imprisoned
on a charge of attempted murder,
while Gian Galeazzo and Beppo have
both recovered. Moreover Malatesta,
who was thought to have died, but

really came to life while in his coffin
and escaped without the knowledge of
anyone, returns from America with a
rich Bostonian wife. Disguised as a
tourist, he invites his former assistants
to dinner and poisons them both.
Then, terrified at his act and dreading
the retribution that must befall him if
the crime be discovered, he seizes his
wife, packs her in a large basket-bag,
lifts it on his shoulder, and when last
we see him he is in the distance, fleeing
with her to his bomb-proof bunga-
low in the vine-clad summits of the
Apennines.
Up to last April 1 this wonderful
opera had been sung on the Continent
no fewer than 1864 times. It was
performed for the first time at Moscow
during the Congress of Pharmaceutical
Chemists.
It has been translated into Bessara-
bian, Lithuanian, Vinolian, Basuto,
Esperanto, Catieuchlanian, and Manx.

libretto is by Mr. Derek Polperro, and
is described by Mr. Cecil Dozer as “a

tality.”

criminologist, is that all wickedness
| and misery are due to education and
the gregarious instinct, while ignorance
and isolation make for felicity. At
the same time the poet seeks to em-
phasize the value of the resources
which science places in the hands of
strong and self-assertive natures.
Briefly, Tossico is the last word on
the expression of individuality at all
costs, and this noble lesson is rein-
forced by the momentous score of Herr
Odón Philibert.
Herr Philibert, it will be remembered,
is of French extraction, but was born
in England. He subsequently became
a naturalised Hungarian, married a
Bohemian lady, and settled in Cracow.
Deeply versed in contrapuntal science,
he is also renowned for his prolificacy
as a composer and the superbly un-
bridled morality of his operas, which
are based on a profound study of CASA-

Obviously you would write long letters

she might love you still more. Now
suppose that she quarrelled with you
(for this or some other reason) and
threatened to expose you. What would
be the next step? Well, you would
look about in the poorer parts of the
city for somebody to steal the letters.
You find, we will say, an excellent man

flat and obtain the proofs of your
guilt. “No use,” you say. “I want
a man who can wear evening clothes
like a gentleman, make the lady fall in
love with him, murder her, and then
steal the letters.” The burglar replies
that he can get the letters quite easily
without murdering anybody; at the
same time, if murdering is in the bill,
he has no objection, and could probably
do it without making the lady fall in
love with him first. “No,” you repeat,
“I must have a gentleman for it.”
Now suppose that you are the gentle-
man—starving, and therefore easily
bought. Loathing the idea of murder,
you admit without argument that if the
letters are to be successfully stolen the
lady must be murdered. So you meet
her at a reception one midnight, make
love to her for twenty minutes, and
are taken home by her to supper. (Ak
quite proper, of course, just as if her
uncle were a Dean.) By this time you
are almost in love with her, for she is
extremely charming, reminding you, in
fact, more than a little of Miss IRENE
WANBRUGH. As you prepare to kill her,
she is attacked by a real burglar (the
one mentioned above, who wasn't quite
a gentleman). You defend her, fall
wholly in love with her, and confess
your fell purpose. She forgives you,
she pities you, she says that you may
have the letters—she never meant to
hurt anybody with them. A moment
afterwards the man who bought you
appears in the flat; you give him the
letters and tell him that you have
murdered the lady. He pays over the
blood-money to you in banknotes and
departs. The lady returns . . . .
Now then. Would you ask her if
you are to keep these notes? would you
hold them in your hand for some
seconds while you work the problem
out? and would you then, slowly and
melodramatically, as if doing something
heroic, set fire to them 2 . . . I wonder.
Anyhow, without being a forger or
a murderer, you can see of what
poor stuff is this play at the Duke
of York's “by TRISTAN BERNARD and
LFRED ATHIs; adapted by Cosmo
HAMILTON.” I expect TRISTAN and
ALFRED are the real culprits, but Mr.
HAMILTON and Mr. FROHMAN are
accessories after the fact, and cannot
be let off altogether. Indeed, in the
Second Act Mr. HAMILTON, unless I
have quite forgotten his touch, puts in
a little satire about the stage all on his
own. I am afraid he is not a born
satirist.
Mr. DENNIs EADIE and Miss IRENE
WANBRUGH were wasted on parts
which they could always play on their
heads (figuratively speaking). But Mr.
ARTHUR Wontner gave a very fine
performance indeed as the gentleman-
murderer. It made me wish that Mr.
FROHMAN had presented him and his
beautiful voice in the repertory plays,
where he could have played the part of
a real person. M.

IT is now, when Summer—as we are
constrained to call it, for want of a
better word—is merging into Autumn,
that the wise person begins to think
seriously about taking cold, and does
what he can to prevent it. You are a
wise person, so let us consider the
thing together. Many schemes are
recommended, but the most popular of
them is the hardening process. A new
development of the hardening process
scheme has just been proposed in the
daily Press, the inventor of which
urges people to accustom their skins to
the open air by sitting at the window
for twenty minutes night and morning
with nothing on, either reading or
writing, or drying very slowly after the
bath.
No doubt this counsellor has the
root of the matter in him. To harden
is the thing; and the more ways there
are of hardening, the better. Let us
try to think of a few.
Sitting wilfully in draughts is good.
It will also make you very popular.
“Are you in a draught?” you will say.
“I’m so sorry. But I love them. Do
change places with me.” Draughts, of
course, can be found only too easily at
any place of entertainment; but in the
daytime the mouths of the Tube lifts
are a sure hunting ground. A Tube
lift man either never has a cold or
never has anything else.
Going long motor rides in pyjamas
is also excellent.
And pomading the hair with ice cream
has had wonderful results.

having by chance fallen in love with a girl of superior
station, determines to carve out a career (“make good,”
he calls it) in literature. The scene is laid in Oaklands

the country houses of the neighbourhood. The burglar,
quite a smart young man in his way, decided that Skittle-
bury was a successful London doctor, and the old man was
so pleased with the dignity thus thrust upon him that he
decided to keep it till the end of the week. But when
“Dr.” Skittlebury took the Scotland Yard man by whom
the burglar was wanted for a famous novelist, and the
rightful owner of the borrowed pseudonym for the criminal,
things began to get rather mixed, and at last Scotland
Yard fixed its eye on the “Doctor” as a suspicious cha-
racter, and very nearly ran him in. “Instead of which "
he performed prodigies of valour—but I mustn't give away

others, from the Rev. Aloysius Kingdom downwards, are
all more or less familiar types. The exception is Maisie
Kingdom, an excellent and refreshing study of the youth-
ful female bounder. She deserves a better setting. The
device of keeping the lovers apart by means of a dropped
letter, which turns out to be a page from a manuscript
novel, is really too amateurish to be allowed to pass
without protest. I am sure, too, that Miss DIANA MEYRICK
is capable of better things; and I look to see her writing
them before long. The fact is that one is getting a little
tired of “studies of rural life.” These students are in
danger of outnumbering the models. If they would only

like to read the result.

“The House of Lords,” we read,
“is in the hands of the decorators and
builders, and the Peers will assemble
after the recess in what may be de-
scribed without exaggeration as the
most magnificent legislative chamber

be an attempt on the part of the Lords
to secure increased compensation in
the event of the abolition of their
House? ::: ::
It is, we trust, a hopeful augury that
the name of the place which Lord

Lieutenant HELM, it is stated in
Berlin, merely came to our country for
the purpose of studying the language.
He has already learnt that s-P-Y-I-N-G

that he realises now that a German
officer ought not to be caught mapping.
An official report just published
shows that during 1910 £20,000,000
will be paid in salaries alone in the
United States to ministers of the
gospel. The ugly feature of this is
that these gentlemen will largely earn
this money by working on the day of
rest. ... ...
The whale which was recently
washed up near Scarborough is to be

WINSTON DAY BY DAY.
September 10.—The yacht Honor is
successfully floated. The HoME SECRE-
TARY while watching the proceedings
falls overboard, but is successfully
hooked and landed by F. E. SMITH
with a porpoise line. “The first time,”
says “F. E.,” “I ever caught a 5,000
pounder.”
September 11.—Arrival at Beyrout.
Baron DE Forest insists on attend-
ing the Beyrout Festival. Intense dis-
appointment on discovering he has

feeling and horrible brio. Baron DE

September 12–The party travel by
train to Laodicea, where the HoME
SECRETARY enjoys a lukewarm bath
under the tank hose. Mr. HARRIs, of
The Times, astonishes the natives by
his tweeds. Mr. SMITH refuses to bathe.
“No tanks,” he says. Renewed col-
lapse of Baron DE Forest.
September 13.−Manchester Guardian
bursts into lyrical rapture over the
Home SECRETARY's holiday. “The
HoME SECRETARY's political foe,” it
wrote, “was no less abandomné in this
glorious holiday, and ‘FRED' did what
‘WINSTON' did. Time and place were
ignored, all social trammels flung aside,
and the whole party, oblivious of the
“gallery,’ enjoyed their holiday like
‘troutlets in a stream.” Panic among
Manchester Liberals.
September 14.—The HoME SECRE-
TARY and F. E. SMITH arrive at Ephesus
on the cowcatcher of the engine.
Ephesians endeavour to capture Baron
DE For EST to make new sleepers. F. E.
SMITH repels them with innuendoes.

Soutledge. F. E. accidentally pours
the contents of both barrels into the
HoME SECRETARY's legs. “No doing
things by halves about me,” he explains.

extracted. Mr. HARRIs of The Times
obtains services of an elderly Minor
Asiatic nurse named Gamp to attend
him. F. E. develops wonderful bedside
manner. Reads De Forest Lovers to
the sick man.
September 17. – Recovery of the
HoME SECRETARY, who, landing at
Rhodes, and finding that the Colossus
no longer exists, offers to stand there in
its stead. “Do,” says F. E., “and
teach me how to do it. I'll be your
Rhodes scholar.” The Honor again
runs aground.
September 18.-The HoME SECRE-
TARY leaves for Constantinople, leaving
the rest of the party on their Honor.
He is personally shown over the
Treasury by Pegwel Bey. “Do you
have Tammany methods here?” he
asks. “No,” says the Bey, pointing
to the water, “we know better: this is
the Bosphorus.” Home SECRETARY in
convulsions.

No. 1.--THE Actor-MANAGER's.
DEAR MR. WILMINGTON, I really
must write to tell you how perfectly
sweet you looked as the hero in The
Strong Right Arm, and how noble ! I
was in the third row of the upper circle
last night—did you see me? I was
next to Papa. All the girls at school
are mad about you, and we have got
up a sweepstake on your age. I have
chosen 26, and I do hope it is right. I
feel it must be. Please tell us!
Your admiring friend,
DULCIE HoPE.
(Answer: Mr. Wilmington regrets to
say he is a grandfather.)
DEAR SIR,--I have never seen a
finer performance in my life than yours
in The Strong Right Arm. The strength,
the virility, the grip in it was tremen-
dous. It electrified me. I have seen
GARRICK, KEAN, MACREADY and all the
great actors, but they cannot touch
you, Sir, in dramatic power. I feel
you are precisely the right actor to
play the title-róle in my five-act drama
in blank verse, Rameses the Great.
Probably you read this when it ap-
peared in the columns of the Toodleham
Guardian in 1876. It was most favour-
ably commented on in Toodleham and
district. Believe me, Sir,
Your sincere admirer,
JonAs GoLDsworthy
(Retired District Councillor).
(Answer: Mr. Wilmington is unfor-
tunately not a constant reader of the
Toodleham Guardian. He fears that,
owing to the political situation, it
would be unwise to stage a drama
dealing with Egypt just at present.)
MY DEAR WILMINGTON, You are
absolutely great in the comic scenes of
The Strong Right Arm. I laughed till
my sides ached. It reminded me of
the good old times when we played to-
gether on tour in A Trip to Margate.
You remember I always said you had
the makings of a first-class comedian
in you. Just now, dear boy, I am
meeting with a streak of rotten luck.
To be quite frank, I haven't a fiver to
my name, and I owe more than that
for rent. Of course it would be only
a temporary loan—next week I hope
to be straight again.
Your old pal,
MARMADUKE DE MonTMoRENCY.
(Answer: Mr. Wilmington has never
played in A Trip to Margate. He en-
closes cheque for one guinea, and hopes
it will help Mr. de Montmorency to
become straight.) -
DEAR MR. WILMINGTON, I am so
afraid you will think it forward on my
part, but I can't keep my feelings back
any longer. You must have guessed
when you saw me in the pit night after
night—I could see you were trying to
look away so that people wouldn't sus-
pect. Dear Mr. Wilmington, you are
the lover of my dreams, my ideal of
the man who should one day make me
his wife. Please let me know how you
feel about this.
Yours only, MABEL BINKs.
(Answer: Mr. Wilmington, while
appreciating the honour, regrets that
he is married at present, and engaged
three deep beyond that.)
SIR,--I have just been to see The
Strong Right Arm, and I find it diffi-
cult to give adequate expression to
my indignation. Do you realise, Sir,
that your play is lifted bodily from an
unpublished drama of mine entitled
The Life and Times of Henry of
Navarre & Do you understand, Sir,
that your play is the most unblushing,
the most dastardly piece of plagiarism
that has ever disgraced the British
stage 2 Are you aware, Sir, that in
this country the thief is punished, and
punished severely, by the Law, and
that a theft more deliberate, more
scoundrelly, more—words fail me.
Sir, I await your explanation 1
JNo. THos. Jon Es.
(Answer: Mr. Wilmington has added
Mr. Jones's name to his list of claimants
to the authorship of The Strong Right
Arm. Mr. Jones comes seventh on
the list, and his claim will in due
course receive every attention.)
“It would be cruel to inquire too closely into
the exact validity of the stories connecting
Edward II. with the Castle of Carnarvon.
None the less, the connection undoubtedly
exists, and the fortress at the mouth of the
Conway has only obtained its historic rights.”—
Observer.
It would be still more cruel to inquire
into the geography of the editor, and
the exact validity of the story connect-
ing the Castle with the mouth of the
Conway.

“The whole gallery would go out

“I’m not used to the Morse system

easily the first to reach the shore. He
got up quickly, however, apologized,
and helped the ladies and the hampers
out. Thereafter he was busy for some
time, making the dinghy fast with a
knot peculiarly his own.
“The first thing to do is to build a
palisade to keep the savages off,” said
Archie, and he stuck the boathook into
the ground. “After which you are

down rather luckily with the ricochet.”
“But how funny; they all look just

“That is Nature's plan of protective

Simpson begged to be
allowed to show us how to
light a fire, and we hadn't
the heart to refuse him. It
was, he said, the way they
lit fires on the veldt (and
other places where they
wanted fires), and it went
out the first time because
the wind must have
changed round after he
had begun to lay the wood.
He got the draught in
the right place the next
time, and for a moment we
thought we should have to
take to the boats; but the
ting up; “only in another part of the
boat.”
We gave up our seats to the ladies
(even in a boat one should be polite)
and from a position in the stern waited
with turned-up coat - collars for the
water to come on board.
“We might have sailed up a little
higher,” remarked Simpson. “It's
all right, I'm not a bit wet, thanks.”
“It's too shallow, except at high
tide,” said Myra. “The Armadillo
would have gone aground and lost all
her—her shell. Do armadilloes have
shells, or what?”
“Feathers.”
“Well, we're a pretty good bank-
holiday crowd for the dinghy,” said
Archie. “Simpson, if we upset, save
the milk and the sandwiches; my wife
can swim.”
The woods were now beginning to
come down to the river on both sides,
but on the right a grassy slope broke
them at the water's edge for some fifty

bag of nails.”
“As you're going,” said Myra, un-
packing, “you might get the sugar as
well. We've forgotten it.” -
“Now you've spoilt my whole holi-
day. It was bad enough with the cake
last week, but this is far, far worse. I
shall go into the wood and eat berries.”
“It's all right, here it is. Now
you're happy again. I wish, if you
aren't too busy, you'd go into the wood
and collect sticks for the fire.
“I am unusually busy,” I said, “and
there is a long queue of clients waiting
for me in the ante-room. An extremely
long queue—almost a half-butt in fact.”
I wandered into the wood alone.

“Oh, Samuel,” cried Myra, “tell us
how you tracked the mules that after-

May I have some more tea, Miss Man-

It was Thomas who changed the
subject so abruptly. -
“I suppose the tide comes as far as
this?” he said.
“It does, captain.”
“Then that would account for the

“That and Simpson's special knot."
I said, keeping calm for the sake of the
women and children.
Archie jumped up with a shout.
The boat was about twenty yards from
the shore, going very slowly up-

“It's very bad to bathe just after a
heavy meal,” I reminded him.
“I'm not sure that I'm going to,
but I'm quite sure that one of us will
have to."
“Walk up the river with it,” said
Myra, “while Dahlia and I pack, and

IT'S SO SIMPLE |
WE gather from the report of the
Whitehall Conference, held last Wed-
mesday, on Land Valuation Form 4,
that Mr. LLoyd GEORGE still persists
in considering its language to be intel-
ligible to the merest child. As, for
instance, the following paragraph from
the “instructions” defining “site
value”:-, -
“The full site value of land means the amount
which remains after deducting from the gross
value of the land the difference (if any) between
that value and the value which the fee simple
of the land, if sold at the time in the open
market by a willing seller, might be expected
to realise if the land were iºd of any
buildings, and of any other structures (in-
cluding fixed or attached machinery) on, in or
under the surface, which are appurtenant to, or
used in commection with, any such buildings,
and of all growing timber, fruit trees, fruit
bushes, and other things growing thereon.”
It is, of course, quite admirably
pointed and terse; but still we have a
feeling that the fourth-form boy, or,
for that matter, the average house-
holder, would better appreciate the full
beauty of the passage if it were ren-
dered in a more familiar dialect, and
fortunately there is an available model
at hand, as somewhat thus:—
This is the Site that LLoyd GEORGE
taxed.
--
(We omit the crescendo.)
This is the Piffling Amount at command
By which the Gross Value, to wit, of
the Land
One fine day exceeded its fee simple's
Worth
Attached at the time to that same Plot
of earth,
Which the Seller, impelled by dictates
of his heart,
Converted and turned into cash in the
Mart
(The same being open–I quote from
Form IV.).
That divested the Plot of the Buildings
it bore,
Not to speak of the Structures and
other things fixed,
Such as pigstyes and barns and ma-
chinery mixed,
On, in, even under the Landscape in
view,
And connected therewith and pertain-
ing thereto,
That embraced growing timber, fruit
bushes and trees,
And any removable thing you could
seize
On the Trumpery Site that LLoyd
GEORGE taxed ZigZAG.

Motto for Mr. LLOYD GEORGE's Land
Valuation Scheme: “Small profits,
quick returns.”
GUIDE TO BILLIARDS.
Attitude.—For ordinary strokes it
will be found by practical experience
that the best results are produced by
placing the feet on the floor—not on
the table—in an easy, natural manner.
If this is done calmly and without
premeditation the feet will spon-
taneously adopt an angle of 45 degrees
to each other. This angle is called the
“natural angle,” a thorough knowledge
of which is the basis of all good
billiards. Ft is essential that the feet
should be, as mearly as possible, a pair.
The weight of the body is now taken
off the cushion rail, upon which it has
hitherto been resting, and placed upon
the legs. The body is then gently
inclined towards the table, care being
taken that the chim is not allowed to
rest upon the bed. -
While the stroke is being made the
feet must be planted firmly on the floor.
Should they show signs of mobilisation
it is advisable to place a heavy weight
upon them until the stroke is played.
In clubs and public rooms the marker
will be delighted to sit on the player's
feet if necessary.
Holding the Cue. — In making an
ordinary stroke the cue should never
be held by more than one person at a
time. Some players hold the cue
loosely in the hand, a few inches from
the butt-end. Others grasp it firmly
at a point a few inches from the middle.
The former arrangement is better suited
to the Spring-Tip cue, which is rapidly
ousting the old-fashioned article. The
cue-arm is generally bent at the elbow,
but splendid results in all-round can-
nons have been achieved with swing-
ing shoulder shots.
Many good patent cues are now on
the market. For weak people the
Percussion Cap Cue or the Spring-Tip
Cue may be recommended. The latter
is an ingenious arrangement, which
saves the player a lot of trouble. You
merely take aim at the ball and press
with the thumb a button in the butt.
This action releases a coil spring
behind the tip, which flies out in the
direction aimed at, hits the ball, and
returns to its place in a flash. Most
people have found it impossible to
acquire that steady, straight, piston-
rod action which is desirable in good
billiards. The Spring-Tip Cue dis-
penses with the necessity for studying
this feature of the game. We under-
stand from Messrs. Worroughes and
Batts, the patentees, that it is impos-
sible to cut the cloth with this cue.
The Telescope or Guest-Cue--for long
or short players—is very suitable for
private house purposes.
The Bridge. —The bridge is built
about nine inches from the ball to be
played, and may be constructed in the
old Roman style or on the cantilever
principle. For people with long thumbs :
the latter is perhaps most suitable.
Nervous players should not make
bridges. They are advised to lay a
piece of billiard chalk on the cloth
about a foot from the ball, place the
patent Spring-Tip Cue across it, take
aim, and fire.
Addressing the Ball.—In addressing
the ball the point is to make your
remarks about your opponent's style
of play and the position he has left for
you as sarcastic and cutting as you
can. During the address, if you happen
to touch the ball with your cue, it
counts one to your opponent.
Taking aim.—When tipping a cue
the marker invariably leaves parts of
the tip ragged and untrimmed. This
is to assure correct alignment for the
player when he looks along the cue—
the untrimmed part of the tip forming
the front sight, and the bridge pro-
viding the back sight. When taking
aim it is not necessary for the beginner
to know where the balls will ultimately
settle, if he should succeed in striking
them; this knowledge comes in the
fulness of time.
Striking the Ball.—This is the most
important feature of the whole game.
Indeed, some authorities hold that if
the balls were not struck now and
again it would be almost impossible to
play billiards.
What more than anything else dis-
tinguishes a good player is the cor-
rect contact of his cue tip with the
ball. That contact which emits a crisp,
clicking noise as the tip touches the
ball is correct. And this crisp noise
may be produced by slightly toasting
the tip before fixing it to the cue.
Players of a “soft” game use buttered
tips, but plain toasted tips, when
brought into contact with nicely
warmed balls, produce the crispest
noise.
Never give your ball a hint of the
exact spot upon which you intend to
strike it. Make a few feints before
you hit out—so as to put it off. If, for
instance, you wish to screw back, you
must pretend you are really trying for
a follow through; aim to hit your ball
on the scalp, and then, before he has
time to recover his guard, jab him hard
in the belt. Always act quickly. Ivory
balls are very tricky and suspicious.
Touch and Tome.—A good ear can be
cultivated only with the aid of ivory
balls. “I tried for a B-flat cannon,
and got a losing hazard in G-sharp,”
is a common wail of those who play
with composition. - - t

Two furious rows of gleaming teeth,

My track on the lawn with a two-pronged lance.
I prod with might and I stab with main
The deep-set root of the tough plantain;
And then with a heave and a groan I prize,
And out, but never quite out, he flies;
He leaves an eighth of an inch or so
And immediately sets to work to grow.
Sometimes he fights, as a plantain can
When he rallies his strength against a man;
I settle the lance-head deep and true,
And it's up—come up ! But the leaves slip through.
Then I set my jaws and I dig and dig,
While the earth flies out and the hole gets big,
And the gardener, watching the work, looks blue in
His gardening clothes, and the lawn's a ruin.
I was never a man to work by snatches,
So I stick to my task till the lawn's all patches,
And the weeds attest in a heaped-up hill
My dauntless force and my deadly skill.
But, oh, when after a week I come
To the scene of the fight my heart is glum,
For every patch where a plantain grew .
Is alive with a new one, some with two !
So I set my jaws, and I set them tight,
And I stab with main and I prod with might,
And, although I own that I cannot see an
Advance in my more than Sisyphean
Self-set task as a plantain-spitter,
I won't give up, for I'm not a quitter.
I shall die some day, for such labours pith me,
And then you must bury a plantain with me.

ANOTHER OPEN LETTER TO
MR, LLOYD GEORGE.
THE subjoined would appear, from
internal evidence, to have reached our
| office in mistake for that of a dis-
tinguished contemporary. Mr. Punch,
however, whose politics are above
question or party, has pleasure in pub-
lishing it, with the usual reservations,
as a striking instance of
(a) Yet another once-flourishing in-
dustry ruined by the most predatory
Government of modern times: or
(b) The grumbling of a discredited
Tory minority (according to the taste
and fancy of the reader).
SIR,-Permit me respectfully to call
your attention to an especially sad case ||
(my own) whose present unfortunate|
position is directly due to the iniquitous
measure associated with your name;
though so far it has not, I believe,
received even the consolation of pub-
licity. Know then, Sir, that, as an
occasionally literary man, it has been my
custom, for many successive Augusts,
to address, at the beginning of that
month, some signed communication
of general interest to the hospitable
columns of a morning journal, which
it would be superfluous for me, in this
place, further to particularize. As these
communications are invariably of such
a nature as to evoke sufficient replies to
last, with care, for two pages daily
throughout the entire vacation, I have
been in the habit of receiving, at its
conclusion, a generous pecuniary reward
from the grateful editor whom it has
thus been my pleasure to serve. For
this autumn, helped perhaps by the
recent spells of wet weather, so con-
ducive to composition, I had prepared
a selection of topics of an exceptionally
promising and provocative character,
ranging in extent from queries such as
“Should Women Aviate 2'' to “Is
Food Dangerous?” In short, I had
every reason to look forward to a re-
munerative season; and my small but
deserving family, whose annual holiday
by the sea is in great measure financed
by my productive pen, were already
anticipating the delights of salubrious
Southend, when what, Sir, do I find 2
That paper to which I have already
referred, whose chivalrous welcome was
ever (in August) extended to the down-
trodden and the verbose, is already
filled, well-nigh from cover to cover,
with real letters from real people on a
real grievance. Sir, I need say no
more. “You take away the means by
which I live” (SHARspeARE). For
this year at least, an indignant family
must go without their ozone, because
the money to provide it remains un-

tion scheme has done for
Yours despairingly, A SIDE-VICTIM.

And turns his organ's handle round,
While blatant ditties from the Halls
Throughout this tenement resound.
His garb and trade appear to be
Twin proofs of grinding poverty.
And I have cursed him well at
times.
His music clothes with added pain
The painful task of wrenching rhymes
Out of a none too fertile brain;
I weep to think how often “Yip-
-i-addy”'s given me the pip.
But now my anger waxes dim;
He stands quite high in my regard,
Since I can recognize in him
A kindred soul, a brother bard.
To-morrow, when he comes, I think
I'll go and offer him a drink.

HINTS ON YACHTING.
To own a yacht—think of it! A
yacht of your very own, riding proudly
at anchor in Mudsea Bay—tugging at
her headstall, as it were, waiting for
you to mount and, spurning the angry
waves, to round the Nore on her, and
be as ill as you like. If you are a true
Briton, the call of the sea will come
one morning in your life—on a Thurs-
day, perhaps—and you will calmly
inform your wife at breakfast that you
are thinking of buying a small yacht.
Having chosen the kind of craft you
can afford, you should pay for it, and
immediately splice the main brace—
but don't overdo it. Splice it once,
splendid exercise, all contests being
under B. of T. rules. (See also Spars.)
Spanker.—On second thoughts, don't
bother about this. She is probably
doing her best, and isn't used to cook-
ing over a slush lamp.

halyards!

peak halyards. Take plenty of them.
Fill your pockets with them.

soled canvas shoes on, this should not

got off, landed, gone ashore or other-
wise disembarked, as lawyers would
say. This being so, and an immediate
start for the station being imperative,
the yacht is left to herself and the
ceremony is complete. The subsequent
transference of the Saucy Susan or the
Pretty Polly to her former owner at
half-price is another story.
AN ELEMENT OF DISCORD.
It was a big crowd. Any Cabinet
Minister would have been proud to
address it. I stood on the outskirts
near a young man with a cigarette, a
buttonhole, and a flexible cane, also a
girl next to the cane. Near me was a
stout person with

In Commission.
—This ceremony
need not deter the
ardent yachtsman.
It can be performed
on, say, the first
fine Saturday after-
noon. Of course,
you are going to
make a week-end
of it, and you can
take the Boun-
derbys with you—
if they will go.

his head triumph-

looking sternly at

º !
They will; so with
your new yachting cap at the coveted
angle, one hand upon the tiller and
the other at your mouth, you shout,
“Let go that painter, Bounderby 1"
and, hey presto! the thing is done—
providing Bounderby knows what you
mean, and does it. Then with a “Yo,
heave ho!” your craft slips over the
shining waters, and Mudsea, flashing
like a jewel in the sun, lies under your
lee. The call of the sea has now got
thoroughly into your blood, and you
don't care if it snows.
Setting the Dog Watch.--This expres-
sion seems to have got warped with
age. But the dogs must be set to
watch, as there are a lot of tramps
knocking around at sea. Turn this
job over to Bounderby, and sleep till
eight bells, or when your wife says
breakfast is ready. Avoid hot ham.
Boring the Compass. – This is
Cleats.-These are her (the yacht's)
hairpins, and will be found all over the
place, after the manner of these femi-
nine necessaries.
Becalmed.—If this should happen
on Monday morning, it will be deucedly
awkward, especially if you are five
miles from anywhere, and simply must
catch the next train to town, which
leaves Mudsea in fourteen minutes.
There are two alternatives, so aptly
expressed by Sir Peter Peary, the great
amateur yachtsman, in five words,
“Get on, or get out.” As, obviously,
it is impossible to get on, you must get
out and push the silly thing.
Putting the Yacht out of Commis-
sion.—This is the easiest possible
matter. You will probably not be on
speaking terms with the Bounderbys
by the time you have warped up at
Mudsea, or have rowed ashore, or have
who look like butlers or butlers who
are mistaken by romantic and foolish
people for Prime Ministers, which is
hard on the butlers. -
“Had him there,” said the dignified
gentleman, with the air of a man who
has foreseen the inevitable, and hopes
he does not appear wiser than his
fellows. -
The young man with the cane
smiled confidentially, and sent a cloud
of smoke down his nostrils, showing
very clearly how little the argument
weighed with him.
“Wot d'yer say?" asked a simple-
looking little man in a dirty frock coat
and soiled collar.
The dignified gentleman stared at
him coldly. -
“I said—he-had—him—there," he
repeated slowly and turned away. It
was very decisive. . . . . . . .”

The orator turned helplessly upon
him. We all waited expectantly.
“It's ideas yer want,” screamed the
new-comer triumphantly; and as rats
are said to forsake a sinking ship so
the throng began to melt away and
disappear.
The sun was setting, grey shadows
crept over the Park. The orator un-
folded his stand in a moody silence.
I looked for the new-comer. He
was nowhere to be seen. Then in the
distance, I heard his shrill, plaintive
voice. As I passed another gathering,
homeward bound, I caught a glimpse
of an authority on Tariff Reform shak-
ing his fist in the direction of the new-
comer, whose face wore the look of a
man craving for the truth.

PUNCH,

A SON OF MARS.
THE Colonel is a scarred, chipped
veteran and, properly speaking, he be-
longs to our reserves. James and I
purchase three shining beautiful new
balls apiece every day, but they do not
take kindly to actual service condi-
tions, and sooner or later one of us is
certain to call the grand old fellow
out, and send him, as far as is possible,
to the front. I have sometimes sug-
gested that we should score, not by
holes, but by number of balls up at the
end of the round; there are so many
places on this course where a young
feather-brained article is apt to lose its
head and go wrong. Of these places,
the two worst, I think, are the oat-
field at the third, whose proprietor I
suspect of holding rubber shares, and
the coppice at the ninth (it is called a
coppice on the map at the club-house,
but James and I have found quite a lot
of other names for it). At any rate, it
is at these two holes that we have sunk
most capital; I, because of the strong
sea wind and the disgusting lies —
herbal inexactitudes, I mean—of the
course; James through his rank bad
play. The Colonel, however, though
he has roughed it such a lot and
knows almost every blade of grass on
the links, has somehow survived, and
yesterday he achieved the crowning
triumph of his career. I was unusu-
ally unlucky, and pulled my tee-shot
at the third into the oat-field and my
brassy at the ninth into the coppice.
Later on, at the sixteenth I hit a very
fine long cleek shot just over the brow
of the cliff. This a very difficult thing
to do against the wind. My caddy
and I both ran to the spot instantly,
and heard a piteous squeaking that
proceeded from a clump of gorse. This,
however, turned out to be, not (as we
had fondly hoped) the lamentations of
my ball, but those of a young rabbit
which was being butchered by a stoat.
So the Colonel was requisitioned
once again on the seventeenth tee.
He deployed rapidly to the right at
first, and then, after a brief recon-
naissance in the heather, entrenched
himself strongly behind the bunker
guarding the green. I lost that hole
and was one down. The eighteenth
demands a straight high drive of about
150 yards over a nasty patch of furze,
and always into a head wind. James
played a nice straight shot along the
carpet that gallantly skirted the ladies'
sand-box and went light-heartedly on
into the undergrowth. “This,” I said
to the Colonel as I put him in station
and gave him his sealed orders, “will
certainly be your last campaign.”
Then I swung. The Colonel soared

up straight and high, and passed
rapidly beyond what poets would have
called our ken. We searched high and
low for him to left and right of the
green, and even beyond it, where there
is a fatuous and unprintable briar-bed.
Then by chance James's caddy went
up to the hole and looked into it—and
there the grand old warrior lay lite-
rally clasping the flag to his breast.
He did a lot of pedestrian work (for
a Colonel) while he served with the
colours, but now that he has retired,
James and I are going to have him
mounted. He was always something
more than an ordinary Colonel, and
we speak of him reverently now as
The Nut.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HATE to have to confess it, but I am afraid that when
Mr. FINBERG's book, Turner's Sketches and Drawings
(METHUEN), came to me it must have felt rather con-
temptuous. Mr. FINBERG has used these masterpieces of
TURNER's as the starting points of many valuable and
interesting journeys of conjecture, based on “the problem
of the relation between form and content, between treat-
ment and subject, between portrayal and portrayed.” On
most of these journeys I followed him happily enough,
though at times it was heavy going; but at length I came
upon this sentence: “If the work of art as operative is
nothing but a connection of content, it can rely upon no
other driving force than that of systematic rationality.”
When I read that, I realised that the book must have been
laughing at me in its sleeve. I seemed to hear it saying,
“Thought you knew something about TURNER, did you?”
Well, I'm certain I'm not the only one. However, even if
that sentence, and others similar, did not add much to the
genuine enjoyment I
are thwarted; in India and Scotland men see mysterious
things which are not there; in England and Wales the
course of love, after some hitches and a little delay, runs
smoothly enough; in Cairo and elsewhere practical jokes
are played in comical disguises. When so wide an area is
covered, it would need the perfect cosmopolitan to check
the accuracy of all the local detail, but even I know that
“coolees” are generally spelt with an “i,” and that “sir-
names " are not worn among the educated classes. Of
Miss Violet JAcoB the old schoolmasters of my past would
have reported that “she shows considerable ability but
lacks application.” I appropriate their phrase, and add ||
that if she will take more trouble in future, will give less
play to her easy knack of writing conventional short
stories and more work to her good observation and imagi-
nation, she may count me in advance among her regular
readers. -
Verity Lads (WERNER LAURIE) professes to be a series
of letters written by a Yorkshire boy of eleven, the son of
a small shopkeeper, and somehow that gives it for me an
air of unreality. Boys of eleven, though they may have
- - all the mischief and
ingenuity and ingenu-
got from the book, it
will be very useful to
me in other ways. It
will be priceless next
winter when airmen
are weather-bound and
table-talk flags.
Alfred Allington, the
hero of The Lost Halo
(METHUEN) and the
son of a small boot-
maker, was, at the age
of twenty or so, preach-
ing to the Bible Inde-
pendents of Little
ousness and imagina-
tion of young Harry
Verity, are not gene-
rally so capable of
putting these things on
paper. Still, perhaps
in Yorkshire—my ex-
perience is limited—
the young idea shoots
earlier than elsewhere
into phraseology of an
undeniable quaintness
and descriptive value.
If you can accept
this as a hypothesis

Nearness to God,” and

(and, after all, why
shouldn't you?) I
can recommend Mr.
danger and sin of hypo-
crisy. So far Alf’s halo may be said to have been too
large for his head, but after he had written a book—which
he wished to call “I and my God"—I am sorry to say
that his head was too swollen for his halo. Indeed so
suddenly did he lapse that, already an epicure in emotions,
he became also an epicure in wine. In these days even
his materially-minded sister was shocked at him ; but on
recovering from his excesses (and very little was too much
for him) he started on such a desperate game of Hunt-
the-Halo that he upset many plans and people. We leave
him on the way to join “a religious body with monastic
aims,” and as nothing except champagne inclined him to
matrimony, I think that perhaps it was time for him to
withdraw from ordinary society. Mr. PERCY WHITE is not
at the top of his form in this novel, but he has drawn his
characters with so much sympathy that I almost wish
that there had been a final election to a Haloship. Alf,
however, had to be less bibulous before he could be really
biblical.
The Fortune Hunters (MURRAY) and the twelve short
stories included in the same volume, having for the most
part appeared already, might better have been allowed now
for the most part to disappear. Their easy style and rare
touches of very happy humour do not justify their repro-
duction. In Venice knaves compete to marry money and

WHEN we used to straggle all acrorst the way
(Same as droves o' sheep and pigs and cattle go),
Till the orficers called, “Hi!
Let that motor-car go by,”
You might 'oot an' 'oot, but 'ad to run dead slow.
But now we keeps so careful to the left,
That you're able on your “Third " to thunder by,
Showerin' dust when it is 'ot,
Scatterin' mud when it is not—
Which is bad for our complexions, wet or dry.
So when we go foot-sloggin', toe and 'eel,
When we leg it, tramp, tramp, trampin' down the road,
If you'll keep your gear to “First"
You'll be blest instead o' cursed,
And 'ave done a bit to ease the soldier's load.

WHEN life seems drear and hollow,
When Fortune wears a frown,
I haste to the Apollo
And plank my money down.
Outside the tempest vollies
Against uplifted brollies;
I care not, for the Follies
Are back in London town.
PéLIssier, prince of “potters,”
You earn our grateful thanks—
You and your fellow plotters,
Co-partners in your pranks—
For slating smart inanity,
Or Fashion's last insanity,
Or histrionic vanity,
Or madness d la Manx.
At times you're Corybantic,
Then for a change you choose
To illustrate romantic
Or sentimental views,
Till pipes grow esoteric,
Potatoes atmospheric,
And haggises hysteric,
When bidden by your Muse.
From introspective thinking
In any minor key,
Good SYDNEY, grimly blinking,
You set my spirit free.
If laughing makes one fatter,
Then list'ning to your chatter,
O very harebrained hatter,
Has added pounds to me.
Nor must my brief laudations
Omit the genial DAN ;
Or HARVEY's imitations,
Framed on a novel plan ;
Or BEN, that priceless super,
Moustachioed like a trooper,
Who plays like MARGARET Cooper
Were she a superman.
'Twould need the fire of Uriel
To hymn your female stars,
For MURIEL's most Mercurial,
And GwenNIE's surnamed MARs.
O Gwen NIE, you're a miracle
Of mimicry satirical,
Yet, when your mood is lyrical,
There's not a note that jars.
There's ETHEL, quick and clever,
With laughter all afroth,
And EFFIE, cook who never
Spoiled anybody's broth.
And all these stars who sprinkle
The dome of Folly, twinkle
With ev'ry knowing wrinkle
To lure the human moth.
Hail, merriest of mummers 1–
When drearily resigned
To ever-dripping summers
And life's unceasing grind—
When worried by the wrecker
Who rules o'er the Exchequer,
You only raise my pecker
And mollify my mind.

HOLIDAY TIME.
VI.-A Little CRICKET For AN
ENDING.
WE came back from a “Men Only ”
sail to find Myra bubbling over with
excitement.
“I’ve got some news for you,” she
said, “but I'm not going to tell you till
dinner. Be quick and change.”
“Bother, she's going to get married,”
I murmured.
Myra gurgled and drove us off.
“Put on all your medals and orders,
Thomas,” she called up the stairs;
“and, Archie, it's a champagne night.”
“I believe, old fellow,” said Simp-
son, “she's married already.”
Half an hour later we were all
ready for the news.
“Just a moment, Myra,” said Archie.
“I'd better warn you that we're ex-
pecting a good deal, and that if you
don't live up to the excitement you've
created you'll be stood in the corner
for the rest of dinner.”
“She's quite safe,” said Dahlia.
“Of course I am. Well, now I'm
going to begin. This morning, about
eleven, I went and had a bathe, and
I met another girl in the sea.”
“Horribly crowded the sea is getting
nowadays,” commented Archie.
“And she began to talk about what
a jolly day it was and so on, and I
gave her my card—I mean I said,
‘I'm Myra Mannering.' And she
said, ‘I’m sure you're keen on
cricket.’” -
“I like the way girls talk in the sea,”
said Archie. “So direct.”
“What is there about our Myra,” I
asked, “that stamps her as a cricketer,
even when she's only got her head
above water?”
“She'd seen me on land, silly.
Well, we went on talking, and at last
she said, ‘Will you play us at mixed
cricket on Saturday 2' And a big
wave came along and went inside me
just as I was saying yes.”
“Hooray! Myra, your health.”
“We’re only six, though,” added
Archie. “Didn't you swim up against
anybody else who looked like a cricketer
and might play for us?”
“But we can easily pick up five
people by Saturday,” said Myra confi-
dently. “And oh, I do hope we're in
form; we haven't played for years.”
º: º: -- **
We lost the toss, and Myra led her
team out on to the field. The last five
places in the eleven had been filled
with care: a preparatory school-boy
and his little sister (found by Dahlia
on the beach), Miss Debenham (found
by Simpson on the road with a punc-
by Archie at the station and re-dis-
covered by Myra in the Channel), and
Sarah, a jolly girl of sixteen (found by
me and Thomas in the tobacconist's,
where she was buying The Sportsman).
“Where would you all like to field 2"
asked the captain.
“Let's stand round in groups, just
at the start, and then see where we're
wanted. Who's going to bowl?”
“Me and Samuel. I wonder if I
dare bowl overhand.”
“I’m going to,” said Simpson.
“You can't, not with your left hand.”
“Why not? HIRST does.”
“Then I shan't field point,” said
Thomas with decision.
However, as it happened, it was
short leg who received the first two
balls, beautiful swerving wides, while
the next two were well caught and
returned by third man. Simpson's
range being thus established, he made
a determined attack on the over proper
with lobs, and managed to wipe off
half of it. Encouraged by this, he
returned with such success to over-
hand that the very next ball got into
the analysis, the batsman reaching out
and hitting it over the hedge for six.
Two more range-finders followed before
Simpson scored another dot with a
sneak; and then, at what should have
been the last ball, a tragedy occurred.
“Wide,” said the umpire.
“But—but I was b-bowling under-
hand,” stammered Simpson.
“Now you've nothing to fall back
on,” I pointed out.
Simpson considered the new situa-
tion. “Then you chaps can't mind if
I go on with overhand,” he said joy-
fully, and he played his twelfth.
It was the batsman's own fault.
Like a true gentleman he went after
the ball, caught it up near point, and
hit it hard in the direction of cover.
Sarah shot up a hand unconcernedly.
“One for six,” said Simpson, and
went over to Miss Debenham to
explain how he did it.
“He must come off,” said Archie.
“We have a reputation to keep up.
It's his left hand, of course, but we
can't go round to all the spectators
and explain that he can really bowl
quite decent long hops with his right.”
In the next over nothing much
happened, except that Miss Debenham
missed a sitter. Subsequently Simp-
son caught her eye from another part
of the field, and explained telegraphic-
ally to her how she should have drawn
her hands in to receive the ball. The
third over was entrusted to Sarah.
“So far,” said Dahlia half an hour
later, “the Rabbits have not shone.
Sarah is doing it all.”
“Hang it, Dahlia, Thomas and I
discovered the child. Give the credit
where it is due.”
“Well, why don't you put my Bobby
on, then 2 Boys are allowed to play
right-handed, you know.”
So Bobby went on, and with Sarah's
help finished off the innings.
“Jolly good rot,” he said to Simpson,
“you're having to bowl left-handed.”
“My dear Robert,” I said, “Mr.
Simpson is a natural base-ball pitcher,
he has an acquired swerve at bandy,
and he is a lepidopterist of considerable
charm. But he can't bowl with
either hand.”
“Coo!” said Bobby.
The allies came out even more
strongly when we went in to bat. I
was the only Rabbit who made ten,
and my whole innings was played in
an atmosphere of suspicion very trying
to a sensitive man. Mrs. Oakley was
in when I took guard, and I played out
the over with great care, being morally
bowled by every ball. At the end of
it a horrible thought occurred to me:
I had been batting right-handed !
Naturally I changed round for my next
ball. (Movements of surprise.)
“Hallo,” said the wicket-keeper, “I
thought you were left-handed; why
aren't you playing right 2"
“No, I'm really right-handed,” I
said. “I played that way by mistake
just now. Sorry.”
He grunted sceptically, and the
bowler came up to have things
explained to her. The next ball I hit
left-handed for six. (Loud mutters.)
“Is he really right-handed ?” the
bowler asked Mrs. Oakley.
“I don't know,” she said, “I’ve
never seen him before.” (Sensation.)
“I think, if you don't mind, we'd
rather you played right-handed.”
“Certainly.” The next ball was a
full pitch, and I took a right-handed
six. There was an awful hush. I
looked round at the field and prepared
to run for it. I felt that they suspected
me of all the undiscovered crimes of
the year.
“Look here,” I said, nearly crying,
“I’ll play any way you like—sideways,
or upside down, or hanging on to the
branch of a tree, or
The atmosphere was too much for
me. I trod on my wickets, burst into
tears, and bolted to the tent.
::: ::: ::
“Well,” said Dahlia, “we won.”
“Yes,” we all agreed, “we won.”
“Even if we didn't do much of it
ourselves,” Simpson pointed out, “we’
had jolly good fun.”
“We always have that,” said Myra.

A LYING SPIRIT ABROAD,
Iw vino veritas : but then, you see,
George, James and I are teetotalers.
“I remember,” said George, though
1 begged him to forget, “I remember
what a narrow shave my brother
Thomas once had of getting married.
“Whether it was done for a jest,”
George continued, “ or because he did
not know what else to talk about as they
were sitting out between the dances, I
don't know, but there is no doubt that
Tom said things that might be con-
strued, with a little ingenuity, into an
offer of marriage. I should say that
Miss Bickerstaff, who had more years
than money and whose name (through
no fault of her own) was Jane, did not
get many opportunities. Anyhow, she
took this one, and in a couple of
months Tom found himself in church
saying all sorts of things he didn't
mean. Fortunately for the moment,
he found, when they got to the im-
portant part, that he had forgotten the
ring, so the ceremony had to be put
off.”
“But . . .” I interrupted.
“No,” George shouted me down,
“they all thought of that at once, but
found it to be impracticable. Besides,
there were not any curtains in that
church. Anyhow, in another month
she made Tom have another try, but
this time he was so busy remembering
the ring that he forgot all about a parson
to officiate, so another adjournment
was found necessary. Jane Bickerstaff
was determined to go through with it
and said she would make one last
attempt, this time herself looking after
things. And so at the next date every-
| thing was in order half-an-hour before
time, with ring and parson complete
and some spare sections in the vestry
in case of accidents. But it was not
to be. Old Tom's carelessness was one
too many for them, for this time—would
you believe it?—he actually went and
forgot himself.”
“That is a remarkable story,” said
I, “but it seems to me to want
developing in parts. I didn't know
you ever had a brother.”
“Now I come to think of it,” said
George, “I don't believe I ever had.”
James, who had but recently woken
up, now began to open his mouth.
“If it is going to be a yawn,” I said,
“yawn it by all means. If not, tell
us what talking about Jane reminds
you of, and let's get through with it.”
“I don't suppose either of you fellows,”
said James, “have ever tried to come
up to town from St. Albans by the
9.27 train 2 ”
“But surely it's name wasn't Jane?”
I said, reaching for the Bradshaw.

“I admit that its real name was
Mondays Only, but whatever George
had said, it was going to remind me of
that train. Whether it was the af-
fected art shade of its boiler or because
it had once blown a lot of smoke into
his signal-box, Henry de la Touche,
the signalman at St. Pancras, took
a violent dislike to the engine, and
nothing would induce him to let it
poke its funnel into St. Pancras sta-
tion. Week by week it used to run up
as far as the signal-box, but it never
got any further. The engine - driver
used to offer de la Touche a couple of
nice bits of coal and as much hot
water as he wanted, and the guard
used to offer him a nice new green flag
to play with, if only he would let them
through that once. But, no : de la
Touche, who, mark you, was as fond
of a green flag as any of us, would
never give in and as regular as clock-
work that poor old train had to turn
round and go dismally back to St.
Albans.”
“But surely,” said I, “that tale,
though as homely and as pathetic and
in its way as poignant as any 1 ever
heard, cannot be true?”
“Ah, well!” said James, closing his
eyes again, “if it cannot be true, it
probably isn't.”

learn that two such liars as George and

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
OF STAGS AND othER GAME.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-Here I am,
putting in a lovely time, with Bosh
and Wee-Wee, deer-stalking. My own
friend, it's the game of games, the
sport of sports' You've never lived,
my Daphne, if you've never stalked 1–
bien entendu, of course, that you're one
of the few women who look really
fetching in a sporting rig, that your
complexion is windproof, and that
you've a nice, amusing partner. I
don't say I've even seen a deer yet
(this is in confidence), but stalking
them is divine.
Lulu Mainwaring and I take cover
behind some bushes or something on
the hillside or somewhere, you know,
he holds both the rifles because I find
mine a bit of a bore in more ways than
one,—and sometimes we peep round
the bushes to look for the game, and
sometimes we forget to, and we talk
all sorts of absurdities in whispers (it's
de riqueur to whisper when you're
stalking, or the deer will hear you).
Lulu is such a funny boy; so de-
liciously hopeless about himself and
everybody else; so lively in a melan-
choly way, and so melancholy in a lively
way; and so grateful to me for taking
any trouble with him " I find him
quite an interesting study. Then his
eyes are just a little bit remarkable. I
don't know even now whether they're
grey or brown At lunch we all talk
deer—how far they can see and hear
and sniff, how to manage the wind,
and how to get near the beasts. Norty
said he should adopt the Indian method,
so as to get close up to the game, and
disguise himself as an animal they're
not afraid of. He says he shall come
out to-morrow on all fours, got up as a
sheep. “Why not come as an ass?”
said Lulu. “No good,” said Norty;
“there's one of those on the premises
already 1"
Josiah has been going on in the old
sweet way, forbidding everything and
disapproving of everything else. You'd
hardly believe, my dearest, how many
‘nots' an hour he 's capable of. Just
now his idea is to form a collection of
pictures, and he's on a tour through
some of the great continental galleries
“to form his taste!” Isn't that lovely?
He positively wanted me to go with
him. There's no limit to what these
men expect of one. Wasn't it enough
that in my innocent youth I was
dragged through those galleries, a help-
less victim, by my educational pastors
and masters!
I gave him, however, a few hints as
to how he might recognise some of the
best known masters without the trouble
of consulting a guide, printed or other-
wise. “If the picture is a woman
horribly in need of corsets and pearl-
powder,” I told him, “it’s RUBENs.
If it's cows, it's CUYP ; and if there's
so much sunset light that you can't see
what it is, it's CLAUDE. If it's a man
in a flopping hat or a woman dressed
in cardboard, it's VANDYCK. If it's
boys with grimy faces and too much
teeth, it's MURILLO. If it's hares and
poultry standing on their heads among
fruit and vegetables, it's WEENix. If
it's so big that you have to walk back-
wards through several rooms before you
can make it out, it's either PAUL
VERONESE, TINtoRETTo, or SALVATOR
Rosa. And if you see a group of
people with their mouths wide open
and no speculation in their eyes, it's a
dead cert they're looking at a RAPHAEL
or a TITIAN ''
Did I tell you of the sly trick that
little cousin of mine, Rosemary, has
played on us all? You remember she
was with me in town in the summer,
and I sent her home thoroughly well
engaged. Jack Muschamp is a better
match than she could have ever hoped
for;-one of the Monmouthshire Mus-
champs, with a house in Grosvenor
Square and two places in the country.
His temper may be a weeny bit pecu-
liar, but he only wanted managing;
and, as to what people say about mad-
ness in the Muschamp family, a great
many families have madness in them.
Norty was saying the other day that
we're all mad; the only difference is that
some can hide it better than others'
And then when everything was going
on quite nicely, the day fixed, and the
presents beginning to come in, the
child gave them the slip at home and
she's “o'er the border and awa’ ” with
that young strolling artist who had
been making love to her before her
people asked me to have her. I'd a
long rigmarole from her last week, try-
ing to excuse her runaway match, and
raving about their happiness and about
love in a cottage, and all sorts of bàtises
of that kind. “You absurd little
idiot!” I wrote back. “What do you
mean by writing me all that ricky stuff
about love in a cottage 2 The 20th
century knows nothing about love in a
cottage. That cottage fell down ages
and ages ago, child, and they've built a
block of flats on the site, and, I sup-
pose, even you will hardly have the
face to gush about love in a cheap
flat "
I'm just an ittey bit horribly envious
of the coup Beryl Clarges has succeeded
in bringing off. She positively per-
suaded the powers that be to let her
have James Parkinson and Ada Batts,
the chief figures in the Forest Hill
murder trial, down at Clarges Park
for a week-end. She'd a big crowd
to meet them, and everything went
with a snap. I'm whipping my
brains to think how I can get even
with her. ‘. . - -
Apropos de Beryl, I hear that, during
a flying visit to town lately, for shop-
ping, she was waiting for her car one
day outside Fallalérie's, wearing one of
the straight, waistless gowns in the
new red, and several people came up to
her and tried to post letters—in her
mouth, I suppose: it's quite wide
enough Ever thine, BLANCHE.

DEAR MR. WALENTINE,--I quite went
into raptures over your charming Songs
of the East when I came across the
poems yesterday at my bookseller's.
Really, I was almost tempted to buy a
copy. What a great poet you are ' I
think people ought to know more about
you, so I want you to come and
give a recitation to us at my Penny
Reading on Saturday evening. Do
come ! It is quite easy to get here—
you only have to change at York and
at Morton Peveril, and then a motor-bus
runs you from Haddon Bridge to within
two miles of the rectory.
I think something light and amusing
would be best for the recitation—our
people always like that kind of thing,

can make your forch. Terms mod.

that his songs would provide but poor
material for Mr. Dawkins' talents.)
THE POET's PARADISE.
THERE was a time I feared the poet's
bays
Were not for me, since rhymes were
very coy,
And many an hour of wearisome
employ
Left me still searching for the proper
phrase.
Blank verse I viewed with reverent
amaze,
Too modest to attempt the minstrel
bo
In ºn a metre, lest I might destroy
The pleasure I derived from SHAK-
SPEARE's plays.
But now my doubts have all been put
to rest.
My Muse and I from half-past ten
to five
Labour together daily, unoppressed
By details of technique, for we con-
trive
Verses that need not rhyme nor scan
at all; -
We're writing lyrics for the Music
Hall.

SARAH IN OUR “COLI.”
Who would ever have thought to
find SARAH in a London music-hall 2
No one, ten years ago, or even five
years ago perhaps — but to-day there
is nothing strange about it: nothing
“bizarre,” as Little Tich, one of the
most illustrious of her new colleagues,
says of the gas meter in the bath-room.
Everything is changing (except SARAH
herself), and the Halls are changing most
of all. “Indignity” has passed from
the actors' dictionary—and a very good
thing too—and it is now considered as
desirable to delight or thrill an audience
that smokes as an audience that (by
order of the Lord CHAMBERLAIN) may
not. But it was left for SARAH –
supreme as ever—to put the crown on
the new movement: to supply the
Halls with their apotheosis. In spite
of the passage of time SARAH is still
the greatest star in the Thespian
firmament, and SARAH is doing her
“turn" at the Coliseum, amid variety
performers, twice daily, and filling the
house more consistently than it can
ever have been filled before. She gives
the Second Act of L'Aiglon, where the
WILD LIFE ON THE MOORS.
Even IF IT will, APPEAR IN ALL THE PAPERs I can't keep Like This
little Duke of Reichstadt plays with
the wooden soldiers. It would be too
much to say that SARAH is a realistic
youth, but even if she is not altogether
la guerre, she is magnifique, and the
audience remains spellbound. And
they have had to endure something
too before the Great Attraction arrives
—at about 4 o'clock and 9.30 o'clock—
for if one excepts the Balalaika
orchestra, it must be admitted that
nothing but some very small minnows
have been engaged as programme-asso-
ciates of the great Tritoness.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE MAN FROM THE SEA.”
MR. Locke struck the wrong note
for me in the First Act, when he per-
suaded Ruth and Daisy to skip into
the Dean's garden at Durdleham,
announce with a swing of the racquet
that they were about to play a set,
and then skip out again. There
are certain stage conventions which I
am just learning to overlook; as, for
instance, that every man who has read
a letter taps it before he puts it back
in his pocket; or that it is impossible
for a man to tell the time without
extending his watch in the palm of his
left hand and supporting both with his
right. But when a stage lawn-tennis
player skips into no matter how
realistic a drama, then, as far as I
am concerned, the illusion goes. Ruth,
I am sorry to say, was always skipping
about the stage. The impression this
creates of youth and high spirits and
happiness is not a lasting one.
Mr. Locke himself was as con-
ventional. When one character said to
another, “I wonder who Mrs. Averill
really is. Nobody seems to have heard
of her before she came here "; when
Mrs. A verill and Marion Lee discussed
the case of a village girl who had fallen,
and the former was very tender and
forgiving, and the latter said in a loud
voice that she could never forgive any-
one—anyone—who sinned in that way;
when the Dean mentioned that his
brother-in-law, Jan Redlander, was just
coming back from Australia, and Mrs.
Averill, (in the front of the stage)
started and pressed her hand to her
heart; well, well, well, Mr. LoCKE
knows how to get the creak of the
machinery across the footlights.
It was a pity that he couldn't get to
work upon his theme—the struggle of
a good woman's heart with her con-
science—without all this business.
The problem Marion Lee had to solve
was whether she should tell the Dean
(put like that, it always made me smile
—I suppose because I cannot imagine
a dean being told anything serious)
the story of Daphne Averill's past.
Daphne had been married to a villain
in Australia; he left her to go to prison,
and she came away to live in Durdleham
with Dr. Averill. Marion's conscience
tells her that she must denounce this ;
Daphne makes the old, old plea that it
is a “special case.” Marion was
true to her conscience until the last
moment, when her love for Jan Red-
lander made her true to her heart.
That is the idea of the play, but
there is really lots more plot than that.
How Pontifer Pye overheard a private
conversation between Jan and Daphne;
how he found a letter in Marion's
blotter addressed to the Dean and
delivered it; how Jan pretended he
was married to a lunatic; how a tele-
gram came saying Daphne's convict
husband was dead—a pageant of real
life on the stage is presented to you in
pictures like these. --
Mr. Robert LorAINE and Miss NINA
Boucic AULT did their best—a very good
best—with the parts of Jan and Marion.
The author did not seem quite certain
whether the breezy rover who had
looked beneath the veiled curtain of the
eyes of savages was himself or Jan.
Perhaps Redlander was a great reader
of the modern novel. At any rate he
MR. Robert Lobaix E (Jan Redlander). “Do
you hear the sea calling in the shell!"
Miss NINA Boucicault (Marion Lee).
“Well, really it's rather difficult to hear any-
thing while you are on the stage. If you'd stop
talking for one second I might have a chance.”
recited several pretty little pieces by
Mr. Locke (notably one about a shell),
which he must have learnt by heart
in the silence of the South Seas. And
somehow I found it hard to believe in
Marion; it seemed impossible that
Jan could have fallen in love with her
or she in love with anyone. But
Daphne I accepted thoroughly, and I
offer my thanks to Miss BERYL FABER

HE was sitting on one of the seats on
Primrose Hill reading a review of the
cricket season, and now and then he
sighed and glanced at me. At last he
spoke. “It's a hard thing,” he said,
“to have seven dull months before you.”
I agreed.
“No fun in life for me,” he went on,
“until next May.”
“I’m very sorry,” I said. “Are you
ill?” -
“No, not ill,” he said; “merely
without any motive, any real interest.”
“But winter has plenty of entertain-
ment,” I suggested. - * -
“Not for me,” he said. “Cricket's
my game. I care for nothing else.”
“Oh,” I said, “I see. Do you play
much 2". - - -
“No, I don't play at all,” he replied,
“I look on. I never miss a match at
Lord's, and if there's nothing at Lord's
I go to the Oval. I have a kind of
semi-official position.”
“Indeed,” I said.
may I ask?” -
“It's not paid, of course,” he
answered. “And the M.C.C. have
nothing to do with it. As a matter of
fact, I lead the applause on both
grounds.” .
“That must keep you busy,” I said.
“Oh, I don't mean all the applause,”
he explained. “I don't clap every-
thing. The applause that I lead is
not for strokes, but for heroism.
“I don't quite understand,” I said.
“Well,” he continued, “you must
often have seen a batsman get a nasty
knock from the ball? Yes? Well,
then you have noticed that he stops a
moment or two to rub his leg, or stamp,
while very often the wicket-keeper pats
him on the back?”
“Yes.” - -
“Very well, then, when he has done
and resumes batting, there is a ripple
of applause round the ring, isn't there?
I lead that.”
I congratulated him. -
“Yes. I felt that such courage and
endurance ought to be recognised,
especially after attending a match or
two where no notice was taken of it;
so I took up the thing seriously.”
I congratulated him again.
“But this has been a bad summer,”
he said. “Too wet. The ball rarely
rose. A dry summer is the time ! But
it's all over now, anyway. No fun till
next May.”
“What about football?”
“That's full of injuries.”
“Oh, I can't stand football,” he said.
“It's too cold. Besides, injuries are
part of the game. No, I'm a cricketer
all through, that's what I am."
“What is that,

DIFFIDENCE AT DINNER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am profoundly
perplexed over certain problems raised
in my mind by an article, printed in a
recent number of The Spectator, on
“The Shyness of the Superior.” Per-
sonally, being a shy man, I found the
article extremely soothing; indeed it
offers an explanation for my shyness
which I myself had hitherto been too
shy to formulate. “Now and then,”
says the author of the article, “stupi-
dity has a terrific effect in inspiring
shyness. To be obliged to spend a
given amount of time—say, the length
of a dinner—in company with some
one upon whom it is our duty to leave
a fairly agreeable impression, and who
is evidently very stupid, is enough to
turn one to stone.” How heartily do
I echo this valuable remark It has
occurred to me, nevertheless, that though
in my own case—may I say, in our own
cases, Mr. Punch * – this particular
form of prandial petrifaction could
never be confused with that induced
by other causes, the diagnosis might,
with some people, be less obvious. I
suggest, therefore, that you should

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN I took up The Lantern Bearers (METHUEN) it was
with a glow of pleasant anticipation; partly because I had
been waiting this great while for somebody to call a novel
by that very title, and partly because Mrs. ALFRED Sipowick,
who has now done it, is a writer for whose work I enter-
tain the highest regard. But I am bound to admit that
the result is just a little bit disappointing. You know, of
course, who the original lantern bearers were; the boys of
STEvenson's delightful memory, who went about with
lighted bull's-eyes beneath their buttoned coats, spiritually
upheld by the smell of blistered tin and the consciousness
of the hidden flame. Mrs. Sidgwick's lantern bearers are
her hero and heroine; and the light they carry is the fact
shared with me a conviction that her latest creations were
by no means so human.
The County Coast Series (FishBR UNwiN), to which The
Cornwall Coast is the latest addition, merits a cordial
greeting. The reader—be he bent on motoring, cycling,
pedestrianism, or even on learning something of a country
of which he knows little—is in no danger of indigestion
from the information provided for him. To Mr. SALMoN's
book on the Cornish Coast I give an especial word of praise,
and even if he had not done his work so well I should have
found it difficult to criticise an author whose point of view
is so admirable. Mr. SALMoN has a tender regard for Corn-
wall; and while pointing out its beauties is at pains to
show that they can be easily damaged. Until, however, a
change sweeps over the Duchy it is no place for the tourist
who delights in brass-bands, and who marks his devastating

that they have been secretly married. Helga Bryne was
the daughter of a German mother and a father who had
been ruined by an unscrupulous partner named Ashley.
The Brynes were very poor, so much so that, till she was
nineteen, and the story began, Helga had never even been
to a party. But she goes to one in the third chapter, and,
having been warned all her life to avoid all intercourse
with the hated Ashleys, the very first young man she
meets, and promptly falls in love with, is-who do you
think? Quite right. So Clive Ashley and Helga are united
by the registrar, despairing of their parents' consent.
Which was wise, as far as it went, because shortly after-
wards old Mr. Bryne hit Mr. Ashley on the head in public,
and there was a lot of trouble. And then, just when
matters were nicely involved, and I was thoroughly in-
terested, the whole thing comes to an abrupt end, with
everybody blessing everybody else, and preparing to live
happy ever after. Much as I enjoyed the story, I protest
emphatically against Mrs. Sidgwick (of all people') letting
me down with so abrupt and inartistic a jar. I incline to
think, indeed, that the author of those adorable Severins
course by a litter of paper ard banana-skins. Clearly we
see that Cornwall remains the land for those who wish to
spend their holidays free from meretricious accompani-
ments, and that to take away its restfulness is to take away
a large part of its charm. But I am at variance with the
author when he suggests that such a custom as the Helston
Furry dance “might as well be decently buried.” For
although it is true that the country-people smile at these
ceremonies they love them all the same, and there are less
drastic ways of treating ancient customs than by abolishing
them. Excellent photographs add to the attractions of the
book, and I hope that this particular SALMoN will not be
out of season for many a year.

THE SPEAKER has been elected per-
manent Master of the Blencathra Fox-
hounds. We congratulate him on this
graceful tribute to the way in which he
has managed the House of Commons.
Speaking at the Church Congress,
the Bishop of BRISTOL expressed the
view that motoring had done much for
the Church. Yes, but not so much as
it has done for the Churchyard.
At a meeting of the Yarmouth Guar-
dians, it was stated that an inmate of
the workhouse had received a land
valuation form to fill up. This is but
a foretaste of the time when all land-
tax forms will have to be addressed to
the workhouse.
“Do not lose courage,” said Mr.
KEIR HARDIE to the Egyptian Na-
tionalist Congress. “The Young
Egyptians will one day see the statues
of MUSTAFA KAMEL and FARID BEY in
the streets of Cairo.” Well, they will
need all their courage if the statues
should be anything like the majority
| of those one sees in the streets of
London. -
One of the most interesting revela-
tions made at the Congress was the
name of MUSTAFA KAMEL's brother.
It is ALI BEY JAHMY KAMEL. He
sounds a rollicking fellow, and we are
prepared to like him.
In a race across the Atlantic the
North German Lloyd liner, George
Washington, beat her competitors by
five hours, and the captain, on being
interviewed, stated that he had not
forced his ship unduly. We should
like to hear the ship's own view about
this. If there is anything in a name,
we ought to get at the facts.
Leicester has lately been en fête to
welcome her home - coming citizens.
Now Colchester is preparing to give
a banquet in honour of the return of
her natives. -
Lady Dorothy NEvill, in her new
book mentions the case of the Duchess
of CLEVELAND who was so proud of
| her small feet that she went to extra-
vagant lengths in her endeavours to
attract attention to them. This re-
minds us of the Irish lady who was
similarly gifted. She used to wear
extra big shoes in order to compel
people to notice the smallness of her
feet.
It is really rather thoughtless of
“Now the N, Mistri: Threk-A-PENNY, wot D'YER MEAN BY KNockin' The BOTTOM

Miss GERTRUDE KINGSTON. The names
of the authors of the pieces she pro-
duces at her Little Theatre are not to
be divulged until after their premiéres.
This means that many critics will not
know until it is too late whether the
plays are good or not.
The suggestion of Mr. HENRY ARTHUR
Jon Es that “a candid person should
make out a list of the sayings and
doings that provoke the loudest laugh-
ter at the theatres he visits" has been
acted on by The Erpress, which sent a
representative round the play-houses to
take notes of the current jokes. Even
outside the ranks of War Correspon-
dents there are brave men on our
Press. . .
Meanwhile Mr. Jon Es has suggested,
as a result of the journalist's revela-
tions, a tax on foolish and banal jests
in theatres. It might be called the
Undeveloped Brain Tax.
We are glad it is not dying out, for
it is such a quaint, picturesque old
custom. A Peer wedded an Actress

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO SUMMER.
[Probably off by the time these lines appear.]
WELCOME, Stranger, though your face
Looks a little out of place
In the order of the dancing Seasons' cycle;
Though you've missed the last cuckoo,
And there's only left a few
Of the fatted geese beloved of Holy Michael.
Never mind the gathered sheaves
Or the lisp of falling leaves;
Don't you fret about the narrowing hours of daytime;
Try and fancy, just for fun,
That your race is yet to run,
That you're starting, bright and punctual, with the Maytime.
If you could arrange to stay,
We could keep you fairly gay
With the kinds of sport you seldom take a part in ;
Very rare those visits are
When you dodge the calendar
And illuminate the Mass of good St. Martin.
Can't your flitting be deferred
Till the driven partridge-bird
Drops like manna on the stark October stubble 2
Won't you smile on Reynard's track
Till the parched and tongueless pack
Deems the game is really hardly worth the trouble?
Won't you melt the morning rime
Till the Long-tail in his prime
Leaves his feathers round the wistful jaws of Rover ?
Won't you please—it's getting near—
Stay and warm our Christmas cheer 2
Won't you kindly wait, in fact, till Winter's over ? O. S.
THE STAY-AT-HOME.
I.
I HAVE some depressing news for you. Your old friend
| George is become intolerable.
In a way it may be said that James began it, but I am
loth to attach any of the blame to him, because James
happens in real life to be myself. Speaking then from an
entirely unbiassed point of view, George's behaviour in the
matter is despicable, and James's patience and forbearance
throughout is most praiseworthy. Let us praise James and
despise George.
The burning question was that of travelling abroad.
James in the beginning of things had shown considerate
and kindly solicitude for George in this respect. “George,
old boy,” he had said, “you ought to travel a bit. Your
mind wants broadening. You want to get out of your own
country and see a little of the Continent.” Was George
grateful ? Not in the least. Indeed, he behaved in a
manner as childish as it was disgusting, and certainly un-
worthy even of him. He refrained from asking James's
advice as to what countries he should visit, though he well
knew that James was only too willing once more to describe
to him every foreign journey he had made. In fact, he did
so in spite of George's pettiness, and it is only one more
proof of his magnanimity . . . but you grant all that.
It appears that James had been to the South of France,
Switzerland and the Isle of Wight. The last he had visited
on a half-day trip, at his own expense, the other two places
in the capacity of a paid tutor. The general impression,
however, left on the mind of those who were fortunate
enough to catch sight of the tutor and the tutored en route
was distinctly that James was not only standing every-
thing, but was also sole lessee and manager of the countries
visited. I should perhaps not have mentioned that last
fact, but forgot in the excitement of writing who James is
in real life.
“You have never been abroad, have you, George 2"
pursued he on this occasion.
“Oh, yes,” said George, without conviction, “lots of
times.”
“I had a delightful chat with your father last night,”
continued James irrelevantly. “All about you. We
started at the cradle and ended at the end of last week.
We hardly left a day unaccounted for. Tell me, apart
from Ireland, have you ever really been abroad 2"
George did not answer.
“And have you even been to Ireland more than once?”
Still the pigheaded George did not answer.
“Really, George, you ought to go abroad. You are
becoming insular and narrow. You ought to go and see a
little of Europe. I don't want to boast . . .”
“Then don't,” said George briefly.
II.
George is an evil-disposed person, full of the worst guile.
I will not have James abused in any way, but I do think
he was a little weak to be deceived by George's polite
manner when, about a month later, he approached him
again on the same subject. With a little alertness he might
have discovered that George had got a job out of England.
“James,” he said sweetly, “I want a few tips from you
about travelling.” James nodded graciously.
“It is awfully nice of you to be so awfully nice. I am
sure you will tell me all I want to know about the world.
It is a real pleasure to talk to a cosmopolitan like you,
not one of those self-satisfied, conceited, narrow-minded
braggarts who have never been outside Europe. I am
going abroad.”
James gathered up his face into a businesslike frowth.
“My dear boy,” he said, “it will be the making of you.”
Then he dealt at length with the South of France and
Switzerland. Since he had heard of George's Ireland he
had dropped his own Isle of Wight.
“That is all very interesting,” commented George, “but
I was talking about the world and travelling. Have you
ever been to Rio de Janeiro 2"
“Have I ever been to Rio 2" said James, ridiculing the
question and hoping for the best.
“Yes. And where exactly is it?” pursued the obstinate
George.
“Where is it?” said James, hard put to it to gain time.
“Why don't you go to some place with an easier name, to
begin with ?”
“I have always wanted to go to Africa,” he answered
with a most deceptive expression.
“You might do worse. I almost wish I was coming
back to the old place with you.”
“Rio 2 But where exactly is it?”
“In the more Eastern part of Africa,” said James, plung-
ing. “I could show it you in a minute if I had a map.”
“When I looked at the map this morning,” said George
slowly, “it was in South America. Tell me, have you
ever been there really 2 What Is it possible that you
have never been outside Europe? Really you ought to
travel a bit. You tend to become very continental and
confined. To see something of the world would make
quite a man of you. Now I . . .”
“At times,” James said to himself, but not so quietly
that he might not be overheard, “at times old George's
face seems to be almost repulsive.”

THE CULT OF THE GROWNUP.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-For a holiday
task we had to write a essay on any
subject we liked. I chose “The Cult
of the Grownup " because in a maga-
zine there was a prize essay on “The
Cult of the Child'' with bites out of
poets and poeple and I only had to
change it a little to make the things
fit. It isnt cheeting because I had to
change it and I left out a lot and I
made up the end myself. I hope I
shall get the Prize for my essay and if
you put it in the London Charivari you
will have to send me some money. I
copied all the stops from the other
essay. I put Notes like in Literature
for you to understand.
With love and kisses

children who say they can't bear grown-
ups, they can't be bothered with them,
they are so quiet and tiresome. Oh,
the hard hearts! Strange indeed that
children, who will have to be grown-
up themselves, should have so little
patience—so little feeling for the beauty
of the dear old lives | And then their
aloofness!” How often when you are
talking to them their eyes take on a
dreamy, far-away look and you know

THE tremendous success alleged to
have been achieved by the terrier Tim
in Mr. HALL CAINE’s drama, The
Bishop's Son, is likely to lead to far-
reaching results in the casting of old
and the construction of new plays.
Already we understand that Mr.
GALsworth Y is hard at work on a
dramatised version of his novel, The
Country House, in which the central
rôle will be allotted to the dog John.
Mr. CYRIL MAUDE is said to be con-
sidering a military drama written by
at Stonehenge in the most distressing
circumstances.
who presents The Worst Bloodhound in
the World, is notoriously tenderhearted,
the author has consented to replace
this harrowing scene by one in which
the Major's bloodhounds are seen
caressing the fugitives outside Salis-
bury Cathedral. -
An unusually strong cast has been
retained by Mr. HUBERT FRENch for
the production of The Brown Dog at
his Repertory Theatre. It includes
Mr. Robert Dingo, Mr. George Griffon,
Mrs. Brown-Chow, Miss Airedale, Mlle.
Schipperke, and Master D. Dinmont.

to mention their eager-

Finally, by the exer-

faculty for which Mr.
Punch has long been
celebrated, we are
enabled to present our
readers with the follow-
ing interesting article
from The Spectator of
April 1, 1911:—
Though we only oc-
casionally notice plays
in our columns, the
performance of Hamlet
at the Sirius Theatre
last Saturday, in which
the title rôle was as-
sumed for the first
time by a Great Dane,
is so exceptional an
event as to warrant
our offering a few
words of heartfelt con-
gratulation to the hero
of the moment. Since
SALVINI no actor has
appeared more richly
endowed for the inter-
pretation of heroic and
tragic rôles than Mr.
Woof. His presence is
dignified, his counten-
ance is instinct with a

Grownups are not all the same.
Some are nice and some are no better
than toads. I like the nice ones. All
grownups are cross sometimes and then
they think it is us. That is their
natyer. They want their own way.
They are a lesson to us all.

“Mamet, after a careful survey of the clouds,
when appealed to by a “Burton Daily Mail
representative, declared that he would ascend
at ‘trois heures,' meaning, doubtless, 3 p.m.”
Why couldn't he have said so like an
honest man 2 -
an officer of the Welsh Fusiliers, in
which the part of hero is allotted to
the famous goat which accompanies
that regiment on the march.
That ardent Baconian, Sir Edwin
DURNING-LAwrence, Bart., is, we are
assured, engaged on a sensational
melodrama entitled The Great Impostor.
By a happy inspiration the part of the
good genius of the plot is assigned to a
learned pig.
Major FRANK RICHARDson's remark-
able drama, The Worst Bloodhound in
the World, is now finished, and will
shortly be produced at the Cynodrome.
The scene is laid on Salisbury Plain,
and the last Act in Major FRANK
RICHARDson's original version culmi-
nated in the capture of the fugitives
noble melancholy, and
his voice is at once deep and pene-
trating. The scenes with Ophelia were
rendered with a touching devotion;
but it was in the final dogastrophe
that the canine histrion reached the
full measure of his artistic stature—
he stands nearly four feet high—and
brought down the house by a display
of pathos that was nothing short of
soul-shaking. The part of Ophelia
was charmingly played by Miss Mimi
Catterwall, who imparted into her
impersonation a feline charm which
was all her own. We sincerely hope
that readers of The Spectator will
avail themselves of the opportunity
presented by the engagement of Mr.
Woof and Miss Catterwall, which only
lasts for a fortnight.

HE was sitting forlornly on the shore

'I'm merely pondering on the illusion
that England is the abode of freedom.”
“But isn't it 2 " I asked.

“What's wrong?" I said.
He jerked his thumb towards the
stone globe which is to Swanage what
THoRwaldsen's Lion is to Lucerne, or
the Sphinx to the desert.
“Well?” I said. -
“Have you seen the tablets?” he
asked. -
“No,” I said.
“They've put up two tablets,” he
explained, “with a request that any
one wishing to cut or write his name
should do it there rather than on the
globe.”
“Very sensible,” I said.
: “Sensible 2 " he echoed. “Sensible?
But what's the use of cutting: your
name on a place set apart for the pur-

saying so. Sarcasm has been de-

“But why do you want to cut your
name 2 " I asked.
He opened his eyes to their widest.
“Why? What's the use of going any-
where if you don't 2" he retorted.
“You’ll find my name all over England
—on trees at Burnham Beeches, on
windows at Chatsworth, on stone walls
at Kenilworth, on whitewash at Strat-
ford-on-Avon, in the turf of Chancton-
bury. You'll find it in belfries and
on seats. I should be ashamed of
myself if I didn't inscribe it—and per-
manently, too. But this is too much
for me. I came here only because I
heard about the stone globe; and then
to find those tablets! But I haven't
wasted my time,” he continued. “I
went over to the New Forest the other

“That's no good,” I said. -
“No good? Why, I've bought a
new chisel on purpose for it. I'm told
the stone's very hard.”
“You won't be able to do it,” I said.
“It's enclosed now, and guarded.”
He buried his face in his hands.
“Everything's against me,” he groaned.
“The country's going to the dogs.”
“But surely you'll visit Stonehenge

“Why?” he asked.

LITTLE CONVERSATIONS.
ONE of the accusations which the
older generation is in the habit of
bringing against the younger is that the
art of conversation is being allowed to
die out in England, owing to the fact
that the youth of to-day is unable to
express itself clearly. After a careful
study of the subject we have come to
the conclusion that our elders are (as
usual) unduly pessimistic. The dia-
logues below, selected at random from
those in which an average man might
participate in the course of a single day
(a Monday, for example), seem to
show that even in this hustling age
numerous opportunities are seized for
the free interchange of thought.
I.—WITH AN EARLY-MoRNING CALLER.
“Your hot-water, Sir.”
“Honk.” -
“It's eight o'clock, Sir.”
“Honk.”
II.--WITH A Tick ET Collector.
“But do I look like a main who
would travel without a ticket 2 ''
“Can't help that, Sir.”
“Neither could I—it's the way I
was born, I suppose . . . . I've told
you why I can't give you my ticket.
It was a week-end one, and the return
half is in a waistcoat pocket at the
bottom of my bag. A thing that might
happen to anybody.”
“Must have a ticket.”
“Well, what do you want me to do?
I can't undress my bag on a public
platform; it's very indelicate of you
to suggest such a thing.”
“You might feel in your pockets
again.”
“But I tell you I had a different
waistcoat on when I went down on
Saturday. If you would only bring
your brain to bear on the subject you
would remember that it was a much
colder day, and naturally I was wear-
ing something with flannel at the back.
To-day being quite hot . . . . Oh, here
it is in the ticket pocket of my coat.
No, don't apologise.”
III.--WITH A TAxic ABMAN.
“Have you change for a shilling?”
“ No.”
“Then I shall have to give you
eightpence.”
“'Ow much do you want?”
“Fourpence.”
“Look 'ere, are you trying to be
ſunny ?”
“Not just now. I will try if you
like. We'll both try.”
“If I start making you look funny,
my lord, you'll be sorry I began.”
“Enoagn. Here is your fare—
eightpence, and because you mistook
me for a peer, which I am not, here is
another penny for a bar of chocolate.
Good morning.”
IV.-WITH A “KROM ESKI A LA RUSSE.”
“Well, I'll try another bite if you
like; but I wish I knew who you were.
Why this impenetrable secrecy 2 Tell
me of your past life in Russia—how
did you spend your days before they
shot you? Did you float lazily over
the gleaming minarets of Moscow, or
did you gallop madly along the wild
steppes of Siberia 2 Or were you a
fish 2 Be open with me; I am your
friend. . . . Ah, now I remember you.
Sir, you're an impostor. You've
never been in Russia in your life. We
have met before; you were in muſti
then, and I knew you for the common
rissole that you are. Waiter lead this
away and bring me some cheese.”
W.—WITH A PolicEMAN.
“Name and address, if you please,
Sil’.” - * *
“Hang it all, I was barely moving.”
“A furlong in eleven seconds and a
fifth, Sir.” -
“Look here, you can't expect me to
work that out. How much an hour
does it come to ?”
“About forty miles.”
“Oh, well, there you are; now
you've given yourself away. I can
prove you're wrong. Because this car
can't go more than fifteen miles an
hour. I've had it specially tested.”
“P'raps it's hungry or something
to-day, Sir. Eleven seconds and a
fifth.”
“Yes, that part may be all right, but
you've probably worked the sum out
wrong; getting furlongs into miles is
very tricky work. I quite understand,
because I was never any good at
algebra and things myself. Rather
lucky my spotting the mistake, though.
If I hadn't had the car specially x -
“Hurry up, Sir, please. I
stand here all day.”

A LOVE SONG.
Oh, my love, my love! Would you know what sort of
person my love is 2
Very fair is my love. Her face is like the full moon on a
fine night.
Her features are as rarest verse, perfect in expression
and form;
Her eyes shame the Mediterranean blue on a picture post-
card; she is of medium height;
And her hair is of a rich auburn, so vivid as almost to be
Warm.
My love lises in the morning, and the sun immediately
becomes dim ;
She moves in her garden, and the female rose hangs in
shame upon her stalk;
She trills as she goes, and the blackbird gloomily confesses
that it's one too many for him,
While the peacock may be observed in a secluded corner
trying to copy her walk.
How dainty are the feet of my love—she tells me that she
takes small three's ;
Which (vide the peacock) does not interfere with the
unembarrassed freedom of her gait;
Her arms are like roseate marble, delicately veined in a
manner suggestive of a new stilton cheese;
Her le But I do not wish to be indelicate.
My love's breath is a breeze laden with all spices of Araby
except muskiness
(Oh, my love, my love, would I could inhale the fragrance
of your sighs');
Her voice I regard as the entire limit—sympathy without
huskiness—
She can say “Boh!” in a manner to draw tears from
your eyes.
Now that my love is away, I am become a subject to the
gravest apprehension; - - -
I droop as a lily; I wilt visibly; I am as melancholy as
a Gibraltar cat;
As for my appetite, I have nothing of the kind about me
worthy of mention,
For fear partly that something may happen to her, partly
that she may meet one comelier than I (I'm always
afraid of that).
But when my love returns (catastrophe barred) I shall
grow giddy, I shall stagger like one overcome with
strong drink;
And, if she allows me (as I devoutly hope she will) to
fortify myself with an affectionate and elaborate kiss,
Then will I fall before her little pink toes (at least, I
suppose they're pink)
And I will recite to her these verses; and that will
indeed be bliss. DUM-DUM.
“Mr. Richard Burdon Haldane, Secretary of State for War, is well

pounds' weight.”—Liverpool Daily Post.

Round the old Inn table they sat, talking fish. The
Man in the Waterproof Cap spoke of the rainbow trout
that he had killed, and the salmon he might have killed
but for the fact that he did not kill them. The Man in
the Old Norfolk explained that the trout referred to could
not have been rainbow, and that no salmon ever lived in the
Man with the Waterproof Cap's river. Having, given his
reasons, he passed on to the split cane rod, averring that no
good fish could be killed with any other. Bottle Nose, in a
wordy argument, refuted this, and told them allabout perch.
With him the Man in the Waterproof Cap joined-issue.
They had been doing this for hours, and might have
gone on doing it for more hours, but for the Quiet Man
in the Corner. In every Inn there is a corner, and in
every corner a quiet man. He is never interested in fish,
and his patience, if long, is finite. -
“Excuse me interrupting, gentlemen,” said this one,
politely, “but during the last two and a half hours I have
learnt all that can be learnt about fish save one thing.
You are, I take it, experts in the matter?” -
There was a modest chorus of “No, no,” but if ever a
“No, no " meant “Yes, yes,” this one did. It was plain
that they were jointly and severally willing and ready to
reveal all the known facts and many of the unknown con-
cerning all the trout, salmon, perch, pike, chub, minnow,

[October 5, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“D'ARcy of THE GUARDs.”
I HAVE been trying to fathom the
mind of Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER. I
have asked myself very curiously why
he should have dragged out from its
dusty pigeon-hole a play so thin in
dialogue, so mechanical in stage de-
vices, so ancient and obvious in design
as D'Arcy of the Guards. . It could
never have been just because it provided
him with a picturesque uniform and
an Irish brogue. That would be to
insult his own dignity and the intelli-
gence of an audience nurtured on the
problems of a PINERO, the subtleties of
a SUTRo. No, we must look deeper
than this for his purpose.
Without consulting him, I think I
have discovered that the clue to it lies
in the character of Pamela Townshend,
as brought out by the most remarkable
feature of the play, namely, the way
in which document after document of
the gravest importance kept falling on
the ground to be picked up by the
wrong person. They fell like leaves in
Wallombrosa, like the constant dropping
| of water that makes for petrifaction.
There was the letter announcing that
| Captain Townshend of the Philadelphia
Dragoons proposed to break through
the British lines in disguise and visit
his sweetheart and sister in the house
where D'Arcy, of His Majesty's Foot
Guards, was quartered. This gets on
to the floor and so into the hands of
D'Arcy. Then there was the document
which set forth the plans of a secret
night attack upon WASHINGTON's lines
at Valley Forge. This gets on to the
same floor and so into the hands of
that charming rebel, Miss Townshend.
In the former case D'Arcy, who is a
gentleman first and an officer after-
wards (if ever), declines to peruse the
missive; and, when its contents become
known to him through no fault of his
own, in a spasm of gallantry saves
the enemy from being captured and
hanged for a spy, so placing that
enemy's sister under a deathless obli-
gation. In the latter case, this very
lady, defying all the laws of honour
and gratitude, determines to take full
advantage of her discovery of the secret
plan of assault, and, when caught with
it in her hands, pours the contents of
a pistol into the body of D'Arcy; and
while he lies there apparently a corpse
(I thought he was dead till I remem-
bered that there was another Act to
come, and no Actor - manager ever
misses the finale) despatches her
nigger-servant to warn the army of
WASHINGTON. As for the damage done
to the gentleman, she sets herself
heartily to repair this by five weeks
of assiduous nursing, followed by a
nuptial engagement; but in the matter
of the document she never entertains
a suspicion that her honour has suffered
any sort of taint. And this is the sex
that demands the vote!
You perceive now the intention of
Mr. ALEXANDER in producing D'Arcy of
the Guards. Under the guise of a simple
costume-play there lurks a serious
purpose. It is the latest and most
brilliant move—the more subtle for its
atmosphere of vacuous innocence—in
the crusade against Women's Suffrage.
The shortness of the play did not
save it from tedium, especially in the
dialogues between D'Arcy and that
good crony, the Doctor of his regi-
ment, who always had the air of say:
ing good things and hardly ever said
them; nor were the passages between
D'Arcy and Pamela Townshend much
|

more entertaining, though Miss EvelyN
D'ALRoy always gave charm and dis-
tinction to her scenes. Mr. ALEXANDER,
in a part that needed at times a little
more of the manner of Mr. CYRIL
MAUDE, played perhaps in rather too
subdued a key for an Irish officer with
the reputation of a dashing dandy.
Miss MARGERY MAUDE was very sweet
and natural.
As for the gentlemen of the Foot
Guards, they carried very bravely their
picturesque uniforms, which seemed to
have incurred no speck of dust or soil
in the course of this bloody campaign;
but the secret Council of War, held
uproariously in a house inhabited by
at least four rebels, recalled to me the
pathetic observation of Lord North,
when a list of officers was submitted
to him for the command in America:
“I know not,” he said, “what effect
these names may have on the enemy,
but I know they make me tremblé.”
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER.
“The Bishop's Son.”
Can it be that the cult of Mr. HALL
CAINE is in decline 2 Not, surely, for
lack of stimulus on the part of the
god himself. Yet it was only the
other day that he was putting to us
The Eternal Question (“Am I not the
double of SHARsPEARE”) and already
it seems to have been answered in
the negative. Anyhow, that rechauffé
has been replaced at the Garrick
by another of his melodramas, The
Bishop's Son. This, his “latest play,”
as the programme says (it is really, of
course, his old Deemster in a fresh
disguise”), was being offered on its
second night to indifferent and very
thinly populated stalls. Mr. BEVERIDGE
acted well. He is just my idea of a
really good Bishop of Sodor and Man
struggling with adversity. Also there
was a nice part for a fairly intelligent
rough-haired terrier. I liked him. He
said nothing that made me laugh in
the wrong place. O. S
*Mr. HALI, CAINF, anxious to save me from
error, writes as follows:– “I could wish to tell
you that the statement made in many news-
papers that it [The Bishop's Son] is a revised
version of my earlier play called Ben-my-Chree
is entirely without foundation. Whatever the
faults of The Bishop's Son, it is at all events
a new drama, founded on my novel, The
Deemster, from which a portion of the earlier
play was taken, but having no other resem-
blance to it, whether in scene or in dialogue."
This authoritative statement relieves Ben-
mu-Chree of a good deal of responsibility.
The Egyptian Gazette publishes the
following weather report for Alexan-
dria, straight from the Kom-el-Nadoura

He must have known he was getting
warm, between those two alternatives.

“JUST our luck. Here it's the finest
afternoon of all the holidays, and we've
got to stay indoors,” said Norman,
kicking dents in the mahogany legs of
the landlady's chair.
“And whose fault
Margaret.
“If Peter hadn't come and told us
is it 2" asked
| the niggers had begun we shouldn't
have thought of leaving the man until
we had unburied him,” said Norman.
“It's beastly unfair to drag me into
it,” said Peter angrily. “I told Mother
so. You know very well I didn't put
a spadeful on him. All I did was to
try to do you a good turn by telling
you about the niggers. How should I
# know you'd buried a man? And yet
| I have to suffer for your—your—”
“Misdemeanours is a good word,
“But
really, Norman, it wasn't Peter's fault.”
“It was, partly,” protested Norman.
“And yours as well. Who did his feet,
and who said, “Put it on gently, so as
not to wake him 2'.”
“Ah, but who really began it? Who
said, ‘Here's an old blighter asleep—
let's bury him for fun?'" asked Mar-
garet.
“You're both to blame,” said Peter,
“and it isn't fair that I should be kept
in. I had no more to do with it than
Joan–yet she's jolly well enjoying
herself on the sands, while I have to
suffocate in this rotten room... I'm
going to get out of the window.”
“Although you may be as little to
blame as darling Joan, Peter, that's no
reason why you should break your
little neck getting out of a first-floor
window,” said Margaret. “I expect
Joan is enjoying herself, bless her in-
nocent heart 1" she added, looking
dreamily at a white cloud passing across
the deep blue sky.
“How should we know the tide was
on the turn,” said Norman. “We’re
not clerks of the weather, nor yet met-
metropologists. And he wasn't in
any real danger—he only shouted once
or twice when the water touched his
neck, and the boatmen ran to him at
once. He was hardly even damp.”
“I wonder,” said Margaret musingly,
“whether it would have mattered much
if he had been drowned—I mean, he
didn't look to me as if many people
could love him.”
“You’d have been hanged, that's all
—and a jolly good thing, too,” said
Peter. “As it is, you'll very likely
have to go to prison, for I heard father
say he was Mayor of some place.”
“Ah,” exclaimed Norman, with some
bitterness, “ that 's why they're so
severe on us! Snobbery!"
Peter rolled off the sofa and lounged
sulkily over to a corner, where he
rummaged among some sailing boats
and sand-shoes. “I say, who's sneaked
my crab? It was here on Tuesday.”
“Dear little Joan took it out this
morning,” said Margaret; “she thought
it would like a swim, but she tells me
that she dropped it somewhere on the
way, and never saw it again. I won-
der,” she added pensively, on a sudden
suspicion, “if that can possibly be the
same crab that they found in the
Mayor's pocket when they were un-
burying him 2 "

This is ridiculous! Hildebrand is my

would not hurt a fly. He has a
beautiful and studious disposition.
Kindly itemise aſc, and oblige
Yours faithfully,

DEAR SIR,--I feel the time has
arrived when I ought to take dear
Leslie away from his governess and
put him into a public school, but I
have heard such dreadful accounts of
them and I want to be perfectly sure
that if he were entered at North Close
he would be as carefully looked after
as if he were under my own eye and
kept out of draughts and protected
from all the nasty rough bullying-boys
and have his companions very carefully
chosen for him. Can you satisfy me
about this, and also see that he uses
a toothbrush twice daily and that he
changes his socks whenever he comes
in from a walk? And I should be happier
in mind if I knew that he was care-
fully watched and not allowed to over-
study and that he was only to speak
French at mealtimes with the other
boys. .
Of course I should not dream of
allowing him to play football, but in
the summer term I could let him play
rounders or take part in cricket if a
soft ball were used. Please satisfy me
on these points, because dear Leslie is
so sensitive and so delicately consti-
tuted, and I am certain that he is a
genius. Yours very truly,
ALIci A EFFINGHAM.
(Answer: Mr. Calthrop greatly regrets
that a stringent house rule prevents
him from taking geniuses into North
Close.)
DEAR SIR or MADAM, During the
last week we find that we have des-
patched no less than forty-three sample
packets of our Lemonade Powder, as
advertised, to (presumably) guests at
your house sending in coupons. To-
day's post brings us twelve more enquiries
for free samples from your address.
We are pleased to get answers to our
advertisements, but each sample costs
us threepence, and we feel that this
kind of thing is not business. Can
you, in confidence, kindly explain
same? We are, dear Sir or Madam,
Your obedient servants,
Oson Ice E, LTD.
(Answer: Mr. Calthrop's guests ex-
press great satisfaction at the quality
of the lemonade powder, and have very
reluctantly contributed 10s. 9d., which
Mr. Calthrop encloses.)
DEAR SIR,--I must say that I am
highly dissatisfied with Reginald's last
half-term report. I cannot understand
how you could possibly allow him to
obtain only four marks out of a hundred
in the Scripture History examination,
and only five out of two hundred and
fifty in the English Essay. When I
placed Reginald in your care I par-
ticularly told you that I should require
you to devote special attention to these
two subjects, as I desire my dear boy
to follow his father's footsteps in the
Church. He has splendid brains, like
his father, but he is very sensitive and
requires constant attention to bring
out the best that is in him. So I wish
you to take him under your charge
during the summer holiday and give
him thorough coaching in his two weak
subjects. I think a bracing seaside
resort, such as Herne Bay, will be most
suitable; and I should like you to teach
him also swimming, elocution and the
violoncello, as these make nice accom-
plishments for a curate. - :
Yours truly, MILDRED MURBY.
(Answer: Mr. Calthrop regrets that
during the summer holiday he takes a
holiday.)
DEAR SIR,-We are anxious to enlist
the sympathy and influence of pro-
minent educationalists for the great
work of our National Co-education
League, and should very much like to
include your name in our list of patrons.
We are sure, Sir, that your long ex-
perience will have led you to the con-
clusion that the system of co-education
must inevitably be for the welfare of
boys and girls alike, and also for the
satisfaction of those whose noble priv-
ilege it is to direct and control the
minds of the young.

you believe it, some of my constituents are
actually, making themselves nasty, about my
trip with WINSTON and you ! : Really people.
are getting ridiculously fastidious nowadays. I
think of replying to Liverpool in the classie
words:– “. . . . . . . !
“I could not love thee, dear, so much, :
Loved I not Honor more.” - º
Yours ever, . FRED. . 1/6
TREE, Sir HERBERT BEERBohm, A.L.S., i
to Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER.
ME DEAR Bhoy, - Shure I'm tould that
your Oirish accent in D'Arcy of the Guards is:
almost as good as me own in The O'Flynn.
What a pity. TAY PAY went off to America!
without hearing you ! Couldn't you manage i
to take the piece over to Ireland and play it
at Dundalk the next time TIM HEALY speaks;
there? Yours affectionately, HERE. 1/3

“An epicurean correspondent writes:–In
connection with the Chilian centenary celebra;
tions referred to by you in a recent issue, I did
not notice any mention of the national Chilian
dish at the shipboard dinners. Perhaps you
are not aware that there is such a thing as a
cazvela, which is looked upon as the Chilian
national dish, the same as the olla podida'
(English version) or cocido (Spanish name) is
the Spanish national dish.”—Journal of Com-

“THE NEW ARM,” AND HOW TO ELUDE IT.
ForM FLOWERs 1
THE REVENGE OF THE MOWER.
HAve you ever heard of the Mowing Machine
Which once got up in the twinkling light
Of a star or two in the dead of night,
With its steely knives all sharp and clean,
And its box—I think it was painted green—
And crossing the lawn alone, alone,
With its whirr subdued to a muffled tone,
Arrived—but stay, I must tell you first
What was the curious personal reason
That caused a machine like that to burst
Out of its shed
When the night was dead,
And so mysteriously to pass
On its muted wheels across the grass,
Like a burglar crawling his hands and knees on,
Intent in the dull October weather
To break a house and the law together.
This Mower had come from far away;
It was made, in fact, in the U.S.A.
Though Fate had sent it to go and roam
To a wretchedly starless, stripeless home,
To live its life in a giddy whirl
Of Duke and Marquis and belted Earl,
Still in its every thought and deed
It stuck to its old New England creed;
And though it was forced to be a server
In a British garden, it kept its fervour
Unmixed and strong (but I don't say blatant)
As a patriotic American patent.
Now there came to the house one day a man
Who was made on a spruce and tidy plan.
He owned a moustache and a rose-pink fair skin;
Had a decent amount of luck at cards,
It chanced that day that the conversation
Dealt with the great American nation,
And Algy (shortened from Algernon),
This Guardsman, tidy and neat and trim,
Great Scott, how he went and carried on 1
Some demon certainly prompted him.
He wondered how talking through the nose felt;
He said he didn't like oyster-stew;
He didn't think much of Colonel Roosevel.T.;
He didn't love Yankee girls (I do),
Because, he observed, they always knew
As much as, usually more than, you.
Their men, he stated, were badly dressed,
With a most deplorable taste in collars;
He hated the silly way they “guessed,”
And loathed their habit of piling dollars.
He didn't leave them a single virtue:
Their manners pained and their language hurt you;
In all their pursuits they were far too keen—
And every stupid and wounding word
Being said in the garden was overheard
By the angry American Mowing Machine.
So that's why the Mower rose at night
With its wheels well oiled and its blades all bright;
And that's why Algernon's soldier-valet,
When he went next morning to wake his master
With some tea and toast to tickle his palate,
Recoiled in awe
From the proof he saw
Of the Yankee-hater's deserved disaster.
For the Mowing Machine had chawed the pup,
Had chopped him small and had mowed him up;
And had left, for Algernon's form and face,
A tuft of grass on the pillow-case!
“But some beautiful hats, in which black and white are solely used,
will be worn, though at the moment they are preferably of white and
black.”—Birmingham Daily Post.
Just the sort of little difference which distinguishes a
real lady.
And sometimes honoured the Coldstream Guards
By wearing a scarlet coat and bearskin.
His manner of speech was something slow,
With its “Yaas, bai Jove,” and its “Dontcherknow ; ”
And his wits were certainly not too witty;
But you don't want wits when you look so pretty—
In short, he was neither more nor less
Than a frivolous lad in faultless dress.
“Barbara dropped her embroidery. Her dark eyes swept the
porch absently.”—Penny Magazine.
The best of these long lashes.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE are certain amateur critics (we have all met them)
who are quite hurt if an author dares to write two con-
secutive books in one style. His individual manner of
expressing himself they recognize now as a mere mannerism,
and they have a vague feeling that he is doing it on pur-
pose, in order to annoy them. So SHARSPEARE must have
had critics who said, with each new play, “Same old blank
verse"; so Mr. WILLIAM DE MoRGAN must have had critics
who said, “Vieux jeu " to his fourth book and proceeded
to explode him as a slave to his mid-Victorian style.
Whereat (alas!) Mr. DE MoRGAN girded up his loins, and
said, “Very well, then, I'll just show 'em,” and produced
this remarkable tour de force, An Affair of Dishonour
(HEINEMANN). Perhaps, though, I am wrong; perhaps
Mr. DE MoRGAN was tired of himself, and wanted a holi-
day. Well, he has had it—a few gloomy months in the
on page 221 of Mr. W. H. Hudson's new and beautiful ||
book, A Shepherd's Life (METHUEN), it is written, “Some
friends of mine whom I went to visit over the border in
Dorset told me of an enthusiast . . . who had recently
died in the village. ‘What a pity you did not come sooner,'
they said. Alas! it is nearly always so; on first coming
to stay at a village one is told that it has but just lost its
oldest and most interesting inhabitant.” This passage
expresses also the feeling of Mr. HUDson's readers. They
too regret that he has not always been wandering about
this green England, from earliest times, eliciting memories
and sentiments, shrewd, poignant, and entertaining, from
the sons and daughters of its soil. No one has ever done
it so well. In reading A Shepherd's Life and the series of
other wayfaring, observing, gossiping books that have pre-
ceded it, one thinks of Mr. Hudson as the finest patriot, in
the best sense of the word, that we have. No one so un-
derstands and loves his fellow-men and his native land ;
and no one writes a more limpid and melodious English.

Thus, I. A. R. WYLIE assumes that I regard the Teuton
as an egregious monster, and, hoping to bring us nearer
together, describes him as a paragon of all the virtues. Things
are so much better ordered in his country that even his
servant class, out courting, refrains from “exuberant signals
of affection,” lest “a blot be cast on the landscape.”
To make the praise conclusive old England is constantly, if
unconsciously, belittled. To take the least instance, our
idea of celebrating Christmas appears to this author to
consist of nothing but quite enough church and much too
much plum pudding. Had My German Year (MILLS AND
Boon) been confined to its interesting facts and pleasant
illustrations, I should not be complaining. It is written
from competent observation and with descriptive powers
of an attractive and humorous order. But as an essay in
criticism it so fails as almost to irritate. Were I to take
its judgment as final I might be content, for the prosperity
of Germany, that the Germans are there, but should rejoice
exceedingly, for my own gregarious pleasures, that they
are not here.

MOTOR MEMS.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Erpert.)
AUTUMN is advancing and there can no longer be any
doubt that the days are beginning to draw in, making
lighting-up time almost startling in the earliness of its
incidence. The cautious motorist, however, will find no
difficulty in adapting himself to the daily change of hour
and in avoiding the attentions of the police, whose only
idea would seem to be to earn promotion by piling up a
long list of fines secured from those who, though they do
happen to drive cars, are yet entitled to the ordinary cour-
tesies generally extended by one human creature to another.
Motorists are a long-suffering race, and there is among
them too great a tendency to endure the policeman's scorn,
the magistrate's contumely; but some day the breaking-
point will be reached, and then there will be a rude
awakening for Dogberry and Verges and all the rest who
have attempted to trample motorists under the iron heel of
self-sufficient authority. In the meantime, however, every
driver of a car should provide himself with the ingenious
little machine supplied by the Self-Adjusting Automatic
Lighting Syndicate, of London, Paris and Berlin. It would
not be fair to describe all the details of the patent. Suffice
it to say, that by an entirely novel application of the
Marconi system the machine is kept in permanent wireless
relation with the sun, so that at one hour after sundown
precisely the six tiny ignition-semaphores are set working
and the light thus generated is communicated to the lamps
of the car. The machine takes up very little room; it is
made out of the new Compressed Pumper-Nickel material,
and can be fixed on the steering-wheel. It is said that it
sometimes explodes in a thick fog, but the patentees point
out that the e is a distinct advantage in possessing a porta-
ble fog-signal, and that so far no motorist has been killed
by such an explosion, even if it has occurred, which they
strongly deny.
A NEw CAR.
I had an opportunity the other day, by the courtesy of
the All-British Red-Map Imperial Auto-Car Company, of
inspecting their new 1911 type of car. Mr. Blosenheim
and Mr. Isidor Dollarstein, the courteous and genial Manag-
ing Directors of this magnificent concern, were good enough
to attend at the chief works and to show me everything
that was to be seen. The Air-Cleaver, as the car has been
christened, is made of consolidated zinco-copperine, all the
joints being strengthened with bar-gold imported for this
purpose from the Company's mine on the Rand. The
engine of course has a sliding sleeve with detachable silver
cuffs grooved in concentric rings. A universal spring-
shackle acts by means of a worm-drive constructed on the
mono-bloc system, and the carburetter, being fitted with
six pistons and five sparking plugs, transmits energy in a
straight line to the propeller-shaft right through the gear-
box to the live axle. At the North-East corner of the
splendid chassis there are twelve self-supporting troughs
raised or lowered in synchronism with the opening of the
throttle, thus securing a perfected petrol-electric all-metal
exhaust. The wheels are of the hay-cart type, first brought
into notice by this firm. There are four clutches in a line
and the brake-pedals are placed on the rear of the frame,
thus avoiding the confusion inseparable from the ordinary
type. The flow of the petrol is regulated by a formula
which assumes that
- y” – 7,4 2
J. = V(...) (r” + (l),
where r is, of course, equivalent to the friction given off at
top speed. The price of this car, with Maharajah body
complete, is only £2,000, and I can highly recommend it to
my readers.
THE INCOMPLETE BACHELOR.
I woxDER what it is, this subtle Something
That other men possess, and I do not!
This hidden charm, this lure, this really rum thing
That casts a spell where I but cast a blot
'Tis not the sunny smile you see them wearing;
No glamour of a chin set firm and fine;
No trick indeed of form or manly bearing—
For glance at Brown's, then feast your eyes on mine !
Yes, gaze at Brown the promenade patrolling;
The seaside nymphs look round with rosy cheeks;
With sparkling eyes they watch their hero strolling—
A distant nod will haunt their dreams for weeks
Full credit would I give, not seek to dim it—
- But no, the tailor's skill it cannot be;
For look at Jones' his waistcoat is the limit!
Those trousers, too, all baggy at the knee!
And yet observe him where the many muster;
The women sigh, you hear their young hearts beat!
Why, Jones, the centre of a radiant cluster,
Might be the Curate at the local Treat
And what of me? I mingle with the others,
Hither and thither hustled, jostled, shoved;
Plain, homely clay—no use to eager mothers.

was no stint of floral decorations—asphodel and so on.

Morning Post, or The Times, or Lord CHARLEs BERESFORD,

ground with an indignant sandal. “They mean ‘untrue.”

she blushed slightly)—“when Apollo laid that curse upon

dead they use my name as a synonym for a liar. It's too
bad. Could you not publish a short history of the Trojan
war for the benefit of Liberal journalists, or at least ask

His Proud Wife. “Now TELL THEM YoU it other story, DEA it."
A WICARIOUS REVENGE.
“IT looks,” said my wife, who is
sometimes unnecessarily observant, “as
if Punch had rejected you again.”
“Well, well,” I said with a sigh, “of
course, if the editor deliberately chooses
to discourage genius and pander to the
depraved taste of the mob, that is not
my affair. I can scarcely be respon-
sible for the consequences to him and
his paper. But I am afraid—sorely
afraid—that it means that Archibald
will have to forego his long-promised
visit to the dentist this year. That's
all. It seems hard that he should
have to suffer; but still ” I made
a gesture expressive of resignation.
“Perhaps, dear, if you wrote to the
editor and told him ” said my
wife.
“What?" I exclaimed, with a glow
of noble warmth, “throw myself on his
charity after this?”—here I brought
my fist down with a thump on my
saucer and flooded the tablecloth with
coffee—“Never ! I would rather send
my literary work to the , or even
the than that | But who's the
other from ?”
“Mr. Gubbins, I think, dear,” was
the reply from my wife, who was
gathering up the coffee in a napkin;
“and I do wish you'd be more care-
ful.”
“H'm,” said I (and few know what
a world of savage scorn that simple
ejaculation can convey), “Mr. Gubbins
shall receive our most attentive con-
sideration. Let me see the MS.”
My wife opened the envelope and
handed me the contents. The com-
position certainly had the quality of
length. “Evidently a case of sustained
effort,” I observed, “and from the
arrangement of the lines I should pre-
sume it to be in verse. Let us consider
it in detail.”
The opening lines ran as follows:
Jan. 11. 1 lb. g. s'rup ... 5
* * Bkg. powd.... ... 6#
* * Blkg, br. ... ... 1 4}
“Apparently a dialect poem,” said I.
“Can you suggest any intelligible
interpretation ?”
“This mean treacle, dear,” said my
wife, “and that's baking powder. The
other's blacking brushes, though what
on earth cook's been doing with the
perfectly good new ones I got her in
October I can't think.”
“An unpromising theme,” I mur-
mured. “Still, in the hands of a
master of realism, much can be done
even with such rude materials. The
metre, too, seems to be a trifle irregular.
Possibly Pindaric. However, let us
see how he develops the subject.”
The next lines were:—
Jan. 12. 2 pkt. carbolic sp. 1 2),
* > 1 tin s'dines. ... 6
“He is wandering from the point,”
I said sorrowfully. “Now if only he
had made some attempt to stick to the
treacle—”
I read some more, but failed to detect
any coherent narrative running through
the lines. The style was monotonous,
the scansion faulty, and there was no
trace of any discrimination in the
choice of expressions, or of that “criti-
cism of life” which, we are told, is the
essence of true literature.
“This composition,” I said, sighing
and shaking my head, “seems to me
to be absolutely devoid of merit. Give
me a sheet of note-paper, a pen, some
ink and some blotting-paper.
Then I wrote as follows:—
“[NOTE.-A stamped and addressed
envelope or wrapper must accompany
all communications which may require
an answer.]
Mr. presents his compliments,
and regrets that he is unable to accept
the enclosed contribution.”
After that I felt better.

[October 12, 1910.
OUR WATERING-PLACE.
At a meeting on Monday of the Town Council of
Southwestborough, Councillor Hadd, in an emotional
speech, declared that the close of the holiday season had
shown them that their position as a seaside watering-
place was now practically untenable. Owing to the
gradual slope of their shore the sea had always been
distant, but it had lately receded and was now two or
three miles away. (Groans.) They never got anywhere
near it. No one in the place could swim. Most of them
had never been in a boat in their lives.
Tourists were attracted here by their advertisements of
witching waves, silver sands and beach picnics, and then
were furious to find nothing except a stretch of sea bog
covered with seaweed and decaying shell-fish. When the
tide was out they could see the water only through a
telescope. Legally the name Southwestborough-on-Sea
amounted to embezzlement.
Councillor Tisdall proposed carting away an acre or two
of the rubbish on the Front and making an artificial strand
of some sort. They could contract with a London builder
for a few tons of sand and bed out some rocks and fossils
and things—anything to make the place look natural.
Then they might have some fresh fish sent down from
town every morning. They would have to engage a
fishwife, of course. He knew of a most respectable
person who had been a charwoman and who could easily
| be taught the proper cries. For instance, he suggested,
“All alive, O!” which he believed was the technical
term used when selling fish. (Cries of “Fresh cra-a-ab '''
“Mackril—nice mackril 1") He moved a farthing rate for
the purchase of shrimps and sea anemones. (Murmurs.)
The Chairman begged to support this forward movement.
He would have water pumped up from the sea to the pro-
| posed strand every morning for maritime purposes, and a
char-à-banc run twice a day to take tourists down to the
shore. He suggested building a wreck or two and engag-
ing a tame mermaid on trial. And could not something be
done to the atmosphere? Invalids were supposed to come
down for the air, but at present they couldn't get near
the ozone. And why not a regatta? (Loud and astonished
cheers.) They might hire some craft from some watering-
place where there was some sea, and engage a professional
swimmer down from London. The yachting didn't matter,
he thought; no one ever looked at that at a regatta.
They only wanted good fireworks in the evening—no one
cared for more than that. Just put a few cutters or yawls,
or whatever you call them, out in the offing, and let them
hang about there all day; that was all—except firing off
a gun occasionally. Guns were, for some reason or other,
always fired off at a regatta. Personally he hated the sea,
but they might put him down as commodore, if they liked
—anything to give the thing a lift. (Loud cheers.)
Councillor Snell applauded this sportsmanlike and plucky
offer. He had an idea. (Murmurs of surprise.) Why not
have a local man to attempt to swim the Channel next
year from Southwestborough 2 . (Emotion.) It was no
use objecting—he knew that the town was nowhere near
the coast of France, and that nobody in the place could
swim—but how would the publig find that out 2 And
what was wrong with a projected aeroplane flight to
America? Look at the advertisement it would give the
town' It would bring in thousands of tourists, even if
not an aviator on the ground flew a yard. (Sensation.)
Councillor Hickie announced himself as an out-and-out
Progressive in this matter. He thought a move might be
made by building an island, or something of that sort,
and letting it out by the hour to trippers—anything
picturesque; though it would be much better really to
have a wall built round the coast; the sea was a hideous
object about there. Then they ought to have a shipwreck
now and then, with a gallant rescue—something the Press
could write up. And they wanted some old sea salts to
amuse the visitors. They could stand around in the streets
and hitch up their trousers.
The purchase of a fog siren and a fully-equipped flag-
staff having been moved,
The mesting adjourned to the “Three Jolly Seadogs.”
A PLEA FOR UNSELFISHNESS.
THIck as the leaves in autumn down they flutter,
Two at a blow by one dark morning's post:
Missives that make me weep into the butter,
And shed from nerveless hands the untasted toast;
Letters to say some poor good fellow
Has fallen into “the sere and yellow,”
Has got engaged—has given up the ghost.
A melancholy train—like carts of coke hauled
Up to the hymeneal pyre they go :
Was there some magic in the summer (so-called)
That made them pop like that ? I do not know.
But anyhow the fools are bottled,
Caught by the neck and fairly throttled,
And o'er their graves the orange-flower shall blow.
Not that I blame them wholly—men are mortal:
And who shall say what loveliness, what wiles,
Have made them dare the irrevocable portal
And set their feet towards the blessed aisles?
But what I do complain of, demme,
Is when they paint their Blanche or Emmie :
Their lack of human feeling—that's what riles.
As if 'twere not enough to lose in toto
A fairly decent friend (for all his faults),
When some young thing (oh yes, I've seen her photo)
Has haled him to the matrimonial vaults:
As though 'twere bliss, or even pleasant
To have to buy a wedding present
Here in the hourly hail of duns' assaults;
That then on top of this they'd have me listen–
Well read, at any rate—meander through,
Till tears of boredom on my eyelash glisten,
Their raptures on the radiant object who,
Since ADAM first commenced his farming,
Is “quite the most divinely charming,”
They all say that—of course it must be true.
And (not a hint of care nor trouble taken
To have the sorrow of our parting eased)
They hurl their bombshell in my eggs and bacon,
They tell me how their hearts to heaven are seized
(He scarcely knows, does poor dear Simpson
If life in other spheres yet limpson),
And then, ye gods, they ask me to be pleased.
No, no, my comrades, this is rather too much :
If ye have dared to tread the bridal track
Into the jaws of death, the Stygian gloom-hutch,
Think of the souls on earth who cry “Alack 1"
When next my breakfast table bristles
With these funereal epistles,
Let them be short at least and edged with black.

“Oh,” said Miss Middleton, “you've

I glanced at the bulky-looking en-

“Take it. Your need is the greater.
Besides, I get it every Monday.”

“I don't. They go for me. At
least, that one does. I've had it for
months and months, and every week-
end I say to myself: “Why didn't I
bring it down with me? I might have
done it this week-end.’ And then I tele-
graph to London for it, and it comes
down, and on Tuesday I take it back
with me. That's all. It follows me
about of its own accord now.”
“Write in it this morning, and I'll
help you.”
“You mean you'll criticise me.”
“Well, I'll sort of sit on the table
and tell you what words rhyme.”
I groaned, and asked for the mar-
malade. ; : -
“Very well,” I said; “we’ll do it.”
“That, 's

“Now then,” I said after breakfast,
as I sharpened a pencil, “I’ve had an
idea in my head for a long time, and it
is this. I am going to give a list of all
the things I can do, and end up by
saying that the one thing I can't do is
to write in autograph books. Do you
see 2''
Miss Middleton was extremely silent.
“Do say something,” I begged; “if
it's only an expression of contempt.”
“I was thinking of all the things
you can do.”
“They will transpire. The idea may
sound rather bald, but wait and see
how it works out. Now then, let's
begin.”
“With which of your numerous
accomplishments shall we open 2"
“Yes, that 's the trouble. Well,
suppose we start like this:
I can ride, I can low, I can 'ski.’”
“Can you ride 2" interrupted Miss
Middleton.
“Very badly. I can never get away
from the thought that I should be much
safer underneath the horse than on the
top of him. Do you know that feeling?”
“Can you ski’?”
“No . . Well, then we go on. I
can–I can—yes, that's got it:
I can ride, I can row, I can 'ski'
I can dance and play football and fight.”
“Can you yodel 2 ” asked Miss Mid-
dleton with great interest.
“Look here,” I said in some annoy-
ance, “when I say I ‘can’ do these
things I mean that I don't mind trying
to do them. But I do mind trying to
write in albums. And what I mind
most of all is when a person says she's
going to help me, and then finds fault
with everything I do.”.
“Oh, I am sorry. I didn't mean to
do that. Now I really will help. . . I

She looked at me thoughtfully. I
went on writing.
“How's this?” I said—
“I can ride, I can row, I can “ski,'
I can dance, and play football, and ſight:
If I once get a hint of the key,
I can join (if desired) in a glee :
I can play little pieces at sight;
I can sew and make d'oyleys and cook—
But I do draw the line at attempting to write
In your autograph book.”
Miss Middleton listened with her
head on one side.
“That's very nice indeed. Only I
wish I had known before that you
were so fond of trying to make d'oyleys
and join in glees.”
“It’s like this,” I explained once
again. “There are a whole lot of
things I can do which won't rhyme
with anything, like picking a pin out
of the back of a chair with my teeth,
and so I can't get those in ; so it's only
fair to make up for them by putting
in a few things which I do.'t do, but
which do rhyme. If you like I’ll put
an asterisk against some of them, and
say “Liar' down below.”
“Sorry,” said Miss Middleton. “Now
the second verse.”
“The second verse might strike a
different note. We might explain how
we had remained quite calm through
many terrifying adventures, but how
that even we were appalled at the
sight of an autograph book.”
“But that 's lovely, because then we
can really let ourselves go—
I have heard the rhinoceros roar.”
“That's the spirit,” I said, and went
On—
“I was once introduced to a Dean.”
“This is sheer vulgar pride,” said
Miss Middleton. “Now all you want
is something about an infernal machine
and a wild boar, and there you are.”
There, as she said, we were. It took
a little longer than that, however; but
when finished the verse went like this:
I have heard the rhinoceros roar;
1 was once introduced to a Dean :
When I'm savagely charged by a boar,
I make no exclamation but ‘‘Lor’ſ ’’
I have faced an infernal machine,
I was calm when all Sicily shook—
But I blench at the pages of yellow and green
In your autograph book. º
“There !” I said proudly. “I think
that was worth doing.”
“How well do you know the lady ?”
“Oh, quite well. Why?”
“Then she knows that it isn't—isn't
—quite—”
“Whoever tells the truth in an auto-
graph book?”
“It would be rather fun to do it for
once,” said Miss Middleton. -
“You call this helping, but you're
doing your best to hamper me. Very
well then, we'll have a third verse.”
This was the third verse:–
Just a word—do not ask, if you're wise,
Whether all of my statements are true;
If you do you will learn with surprise
That it's all of it—all ºf it—lies;
Yet I doubt if that matters to you,
You have got what you wanted—why, look

“I hope that satisfies you,” I said
to Miss Middleton, and I opened the
book and wrote the verses in care-

THE MAKING OF A JOURNALIST.
MR. LLOYD GEORGE's RETorT courTEou's To
T. P.'s ARTICLE IN “THE MUNSEY.”
AN “intimate study " of the famous
and self-sacrificing patriot journalist
forms the most attractive feature of the
October number of Bindell's Magazine.
“T. P. O'Connor,” it says, “is not
merely an individual, but a type and a
world-force. He embodies the cri de
coeur of a nation in chronic revolt. And
yet by a tragic irony almost too deep
for tears this Celt of Celts lives in per-
manent exile in the heart of cruel
London.
“His early days, however, were spent
amid the green hills of Erin, where he
was the life and soul of every gather-
ing, social, political and athletic. At
the national game of hurly, at all
meetings held by the votaries of terpsi-
chore, ‘T. P.' shone conspicuous by his
indefatigable and resilient energy. Yet
the cult of athletics never interfered
with his literary studies. At the age
of ten he had committed all the poly-
syllabic epithets in JoHNsoN's Diction-
ary to memory, and modelled his style
on that of the great monarch of the
florid quill, GEORGE AUGUSTU's SALA.
“Gravitating to London in the early
‘seventies,’ he soon leaped to eminence
by the wonderful skill with which he
combined a truculent patriotism with
the keenest appreciation of the noble
qualities of the English aristocracy.
“This heroic tolerance he carries to
such miraculous lengths that he has
actually been known to shake hands
with a Tory peer and to drink tea in the
same room with a duchess.
“His early environment was narrow
and strait-laced, but by a great effort
he has so far emancipated himself
from these cramping influences that he
occasionally visits the theatre and has
been known to admit an acquaintance
with the works of GEORGES OHNET.
“One of the most beautiful traits in
his character is his ability to enjoy or
even make a joke at his own expense.
Thus, once when I asked him to what
quality he attributed his marvellous
success, he replied with a joyous
twinkle in his eye, 'Sure, me friends
call it bonhomie; GoLDw1N SMITH called
it “heartfelt flummery;” but I call it
blatherskite.’
“When he is among his intimates—
and their name is i...". often
bursts forth into song and dance. I
am not a musical critic, but I have
never heard a richer or more ingra-
tiating baritone than ‘T. P.’s.’

I remember expressing my surprise
that a people like the Irish could con-

sent to PARNELL's dictatorship. ‘Och,
why wouldn't they?’ was the imme-
diate response. ‘Sure, the Irish love a
Dictator. That's why they love me,
for I've been dictating everything for
the last twenty years.’
“Until he took to motoring, ‘T. P.”
was a fearless bicyclist. TIM HEALY
wants him to take to aeroplaning, but
so far he has resisted the temptation.
His favourite drink is barley-water,
and he smokes Irish cigarettes with

WILD DELIGHTS.
A LADY's paper suggests the diversion of “throwing
the cap” as remedy for the bored. It appears that “you
divide the guests into two sides and choose a leader, who
stands in the middle and tosses a cap. If it falls the right
side up, the people on one side laugh as heartily as they can
[the italics are all our º Any one on the other side
seen to smile has to join the laughing side. When the
cap falls wrong side up, it is the other side's turn to laugh
and win the people over.”
In case the guests at country house-parties prove recal-
citrant or irresponsive to cap-throwing, there are some
variations to fall back upon, perhaps equally intellectual
and adapted to adults. For instance, a Horse-collar Drive
should be highly effective where these articles of harness
can still be requisitioned and the coachman is not yet ousted
by the chauffeur. You persuade the lady or gentleman with
the most obvious countenance to stand on the hearthrug
and make a face through the horse-collar, until some one
of the party grins in sympathy. The person who does so
must relieve the first performer, and so on in turn, the
winner being the one whose grimace is provocative in
the shortest time.
Another invaluable stand-by, needing no accessories, is
the Progressive Yawn. A pointless story must be told by
the worst raconteur of the company. The people on one
side will then yawn as cavernously as they can, and capture
those of their opponents involuntarily gaping.
We expect no reward for inventing these relaxations for
the long autumn evenings, beyond the conviction that we
have added to the list of national pastimes that have gone
far to make Britain Great.

Do not quiet your anxiety by giving me a diet,
Or by base resort to vi et armis fold me to your arms,
And let no suspicious tremor violate your wonted phlegm, or
Any fear that Harold's memory is faithless to your charms.
For my passion as I dash on in that disconcerting fashion
Is as ardently irrational as when we forged the link,
When you gave your little hand away to me, my own Amanda,
And we sat in the verandah till the stars began to wink.
And I am in such a famine when your beauty I examine,
That it lures me as the jam invites a hungry little brat,
But I fancy that, at any rate, I'd rather waste a penny
Than be spitted by the many pins that bristlefrom your hat.

TheRE are two tortoises (we have

Well, they both got off the mark

the time AEschylus had been tempted

impression that tortoises confine
their sporting fixtures to encoun-
ters with hares; but this is an
error. James was at a college
where they keep a pet tortoise in
the Fellows' garden, and he has
satisfactorily disproved the accu-
sations sometimes levelled at our
great educational centres by dis-
covering its fondness for dande-
lions. Almost any yellow flower
will do, but it takes a dandelion
to arouse real enthusiasm in the
breasts of these strong, silent
animals; and by placing this
lure in front of AEschylus and
Araminta (after the manner of a
donkey with a carrot) we have
frequently caused them to develop
a rare turn of speed. We had
some discussion at first as to
whether it should be a bumping
race or not (James rowed in his
second Torpid), but Araminta is

Joe is the gardener, and I gathered,
from one or two remarks which he let

Meanwhile, AEschylus was forging

those brilliant inspirations that come

I sent Henry indoors for his bagpipes
(he is about one-sixteenth Scotch, and
carries these weapons with him wher-
ever he goes). AEschylus was very
nearly eight lengths ahead when Henry
returned and at my earnest request
struck up “The Flowers of the Forest.”
The effect was magical (as the cricket re-
porters say) and instantaneous. AEschy-
lus swerved violently from the course,
and made for the shelter of a rhodo-
dendron bush; but Araminta thrust

Sir David David,

RESPECTED SIR,-Reading in Happy
Homeland as how you dont know how
to spend your money quick enough not
having so very long to live, I beg to
say as how I should be very pleased to
help you and will come down to Wales
to-morrow if you like. Dont think its
any trouble for me because it isn't.
Your respectful servant, my Lord,

(Answer: Sir David David presents
his compliments to the Editor of
Happy Homeland, and requests him
to refrain from publishing any further
unauthorised paragraphs relative to
Sir David's wealth. It may interest
the Editor to know that the paragraph
in the current issue has inspired 527
letters by this morning's post alone.)
DEAR SIR DAVID,-You and I are
both business men, so I won't waste
words. In the enclosed prospectus
of the Anglo-Patagonian Development
Finance Corporation, Ltd., there is
only one thing missing—the name of
the Chairman. It carries 5,000 shares
with it, and of course there will be
juicy pickings from the subsidiaries we
shall float. Patagonia is a fine place
for a boom—it's so far away.
Are you on ?
Yours for business,
MoNTY SNIDERVITCH.
(Answer: Sir David David is off.)
SIR,-You are a loathsome blood-
sucker! A mean, contemptible hound
wallowing in the lap of luxury on
the filthy money you wring out of
your sweated shop assistants. In your
Edgware Road shop they are kept at it
night after night until ten and eleven
o'clock at sale time, presumably by
your orders. In the name of the
Brotherhood of Man I demand your
explanation ' If you keep silent we
shall take it as an admission of guilt
and adopt MEASUREs accordingly.
For such slave-driving there can be
no decent explanation, but we shall be
interested to hear how you wriggle out
of it. Slimy worm
Yours, BARTHoLoMEw MIGGs.
(Answer: Sir David David regrets to
disappoint Mr. Miggs, but he is in no
way connected with Messrs. David &
Co., of Edgware Road.)
DERE SIR,--I am only a little girl of
six. My dere mummie tells me to
pray for you every mite becos you are
so good and kind. We are 17 and
none of us is old enuſ to work, so pore
mummie has to work for us. Oh dere
kind Sir, wont you send us money to
give mummie a holiday in the country?
Dere Sir, you will never feel the loss
of a few pounds, and I will always
remember to bless you. . - * *
Your loving little friend, DoRIs.
(Answer: Sir David David has
already contributed several times to
the same handwriting with various
signatures.) . . . *
DEAR SIR DAVID,-For a long time
our people have been wondering why
you have not come forward into politics.
Will you allow me to say that you are
the very man for the purpose—a keen
business man, level-headed, influential,
and of course unhampered by pecuniary
worries. In fact, I may tell you in
absolute confidence that a certain
Cabinet Minister said to me the other
day, “Ah, if we only had a few men
such as David in the Lords !”
The next General Election will be a
splendid time to make a debut if you
will honour us by contesting a seat in
our interests. In a South Wales con-
stituency your name should sweep the
poll. Will you let me have your views
on the matter 2
Yours very sincerely,
CHIPPENHAM.
P.S.—Our war-chest for the General
Election is in rather an unsatisfactory
state. We are trying to get £100,000
together, and to date are over £25,000
short of it. - - - -

tion, but I am a plain business man
and have had a similar offer from

MUSIC.
Interview with the Conductor of the
Speckled Band.
By a happy chance Mr. Punch's re-
presentative caught M. Joska Molkar,
the conductor of the famous Speckled
Band, between two engagements, and
in the course of a brief interview ex-
tracted from him the following exclusive
information. • * -
“Yes,” said M. Molkar, “this is our
first visit to England. We come, as
you know, from Dalmatia, the land of
the Green Dalmatian Mountains. It is
a beautiful country, though the Bora
is occasionally rather trying.”
“I hope,” queried our representative,
“that you are pleased with your recep-
tion.” -
“Oh, yes,” responded M. MolkAR,
“the English public has taken to us
wonderfully, and we are already known
as ‘The Dotted Spogs.”
“You have a large band 2"
“Immense. But we rely more upon
quality than quantity. The tone of
our triangles is unique — pyramidal.
And we are the only band in the world
with a quartet of dappled pom-poms.”
“Your repertory is, I understand,
rather extensive 2 '' ... -- - - - - - - -
“Extensive is not the word. We
play all the newest music; but in our
version every note is dotted, which
gives it a peculiar lilt or ‘tittup, as you
English call it. Sousa, I believe, did
something of the sort, but the Speckled
Band can knock spots off Sousa.” .
“Can you tell me the names of some
of your pieces?” . . . . . . . .
“Certainly. The overture to Maras-
chimo–one of the staple products of
Dalmatia—is perhaps our favourite
morceau. It is a luscious composition,
lavishly scored, and contains a brilliant
solo for the angelica, played by M.
Goracucchi. Another very popular piece
is Camera Lethalis, or ‘The Doom of
the Plum-pudding Dog.’” * --
“Your uniform is a special feature,
is it not 2 ''
“Oh, yes. There is nothing like it
in the musical world. We wear raw-
hide sandals, spiral open-work puttees
of green serge fastened with amethyst
kibobs, a pink satin fustanella trimmed
with magenta frilling, and then the
historic speckled mainsook jacket orna-
mented with frogs of violet velvet. The
tout ensemble is surmounted by a small
pork-pie forage cap rakishly set over
the left ear. We wear side whiskers
and a chin tuft, but no moustache.
But I am afraid you must excuse me:
now, as I am due in ten minutes to
conduct my new “Spot Cash’ Fantasia
at a Matinée at Messrs. Garridge's.”

YoU ’D BETTER Ask HIM To DINNER.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
LADY DoROTHY NEVILL is a legacy graciously bequeathed
by the Nineteenth Century to the Twentieth. She has
lived Under Five Reigns, and in a portly volume published
by METHUEN pleasantly gossips of remembered faces,
things seen and heard. It is a continuation of one pub-
lished four years ago, but it does not overlap its predecessor.
Lady DoRothy's range of experience has been so wide and
varied that her second note-book is as fresh as the first.
Among other charms the work has that of style. She does
not laboriously indite. She pleasantly chats as she might
(and indeed does) in the circle of intimate friends. Crammed
with good things, the book readily lends itself to quota-
tion. The Jack Horners amongst reviewers have yielded
to temptation and have picked out most of the plums in
the way of anecdote. There remains much for the honest
reader in the way of discursive writing too lengthy for
quotation. Of such are the chapters picturing social life in
England in mid-Victorian days. Especially interesting
are notes of travel in Germany and Italy, when Lady
DoRothy, escorted by her parents, went on tour in what
she lightly alludes to as “the early forties of the last
century.” She knew most people worth knowing during
the last sixty years. The catholicity of her taste is indi-
cated by the fact that in early life devoted to DISRAELI—
with whom she was always “dearest Dorothy"—in these
latter days she presents herself in a photograph with smiling
countenance leaning on the arm of John BURNs, to whom
a white plumed hat, a trusty blade belted round a coat of
military cut adorned with gold-laced sleeves, add sugges-
tion of recent return from the tented field. The book is so
delightful one hopes for more.
Barker's were publishers plodding and slow,
Early-Victorian, lacking in go,
Till young Mr. Fairfax decided to come
And make things (if I may express it so) hum.
Young Mr. Fairfax was brainy and bright;
He jumped to success when he started to write;
But Barker's did not make a similar jump;
They met (in a manner of speaking) a slump.
Thing went very badly, though F. and the rest
Of the principal shareholders all did their best,
And Cupid himself lent a zest to their toil
By keeping the lot (so to say) on the boil.
But Barker's (the book which describes their distress)
Should bring a deal more that its namesake's success
To the author, E. H. LACON WATson, to wit,
And also to MURRAY, who publishes it.
If, in haste to find out what happens, you skim The
Doctor's Lass (GRANT RICHARDs), you will be ill-advised,
for nothing of much consequence does happen, and the
charm of the book lies almost completely in the way in
which it is written. Again and again Mr. Edward Booth
reminds me of Mr. DE MoRGAN ; he seems to regard his
characters with the same kind of wistful tenderness, and
he has also the same habit of delaying the action of the
story while he relates some trifling—but delightful—inci-
dent. What little plot there is concerns itself with a doctor
who takes into his house the daughter of a woman who

had jilted him, and in course of time marries her. A few
complications occur, but one is never really anxious about
the issue. Mr. Booth's first book, The Cliff End, delighted
me, and I am now his confirmed admirer. Prolixity is,
however, his cardinal fault (he takes 469 pages to tell this
tale), and I believe that he would gain a thousand or so
more readers if he would make his book a hundred pages
or so shorter. -
To those who would like Mr. PETT RIDGE to produce a
Mord Em'iy every time he writes a book, Nine to Sir-
Thirty (METHUEN) will probably be a disappointment.
There is very little of Mord in Barbara Harrison, the young
lady who for two hundred and eighty-five of the three
hundred and forty-four pages works almost incessantly
during the hours indicated in the title. Her outlook
on life is clear and uncomplicated. “You can supply
us with money,” she says, discussing the question of
women workers, “and keep us tied up to the fender, and
we'll be mild, obedient slaves; or, you can keep us without
money and educate
us and turn us out to
earn our living. But
you mustn't expect
the world won't
harden us, as it
hardens you; you
mustn't assume we
are going to preserve
what folk call—what
was it? — the mid-
Victorian charm, and
at the same time earn
money to save some
man the trouble of
earning money for
us.” Certainly I de-
tected very little mid-
Victorian charm, or,
indeed, any other sort
of charm, about Bar-
bara. On page 244 a
minor character calls
her “a hard woman."
The compliment, says
our author, induced
her to smile at Blooms- - -
bury on the way home. If Mr. PETT RIDGE should come to
me for advice on his literary career, I should say to him,
“RIDGE" (or possibly PETT), “old man, I know you want
to show people that you are no mere irresponsible jester;
but do, in future, leave bitterness to the other fellows. You
have done it very well, but I look to you to persuade me
that the world is not such a bad sort of place after all. If
you start trying to show that it is a festering welter of
rogues, swindlers, back-biters and down-treaders of the
poor, where are we?" To which Mr. RIDGE would, I hope,
reply, “You are perfectly right. The fact is, my dear
fellow, I had been reading Ann Veronica, and I thought I
ought to have a shot at that sort of thing. It shan’t occur
again.” |
IMPROBABLE
THE NATIONAL Sport ING CLUB PAYS
I was asked the other day by a young Rhodes scholar if
I could recommend him a good guide-book to English as
she is spoken in the Shires. He can talk golf and cricket
and shooting as to the manner born, but not coming of a
hunting stock was rather nervous about a prospective visit
to the neighbourhood of Melton. Luckily I had something
better than a mere glossary to give him in the shape of the
latest of the pleasant hunting yarns which Miss R. RAMSAY
spins so easily and so well. For she knows the dialect
from start to finish, from find to kill, so that her covert-side
prattle seems altogether more real and less slangy than that
of most sporting novels. Of the plot of Barnaby (Hutchin-
soN) I am not quite so certain. Miss RAMSAY gives us
several rattling good runs for our money (so that in reading
it I feel like a carpet-bagger who has not subscribed to the
hunt), but I am bound to confess that some of the fences
seem to me rather artificial. Still she succeeds in her
primary object, which is to make one sympathise with and
love a young American actress who comes to England and
poses as the widow of Barnaby, the darling of the Shires,
who is supposed to be dead and buried in the Far West.
When Barnaby comes to life and England, Home and
Beauty once more, the impostor is obviously in rather a
tight corner, as he has never even heard of her existence
till she is introduced to him as his wife by his adoring
mother. But Miss RAMSAY has foreseen and ingeniously
provided against all possible objections, including a previous
— American marriage
which turns out to
have been invalid, and
out of these materials
has constructed a
really pretty love-
story. There are
chapters in the book
which seem to show
that she might some
day fly at higher game
than foxes and their
hunters.
Easy as Mr. Eben
PHILLPotts finds it
to write fresh tales of
Dartmoor, I confess
that the task of say-
ing anything fresh
about them is too
much for me. There
are more misfortunes
than getting into a
groove if the groove
happens to fit you,
and as no novelist is
more satisfactorily fitted than Mr. PHILLPoTTs, it seems an
impertinence to invite him to give Dartmoor a holiday.
Nevertheless I cannot help regretting the groove, even if I
hesitate to ask him to leave it. For although, like a golfer
whose local knowledge makes him hard to beat on his own
course, he gets great advantages from Dartmoor, it is pos-
sible that some of his readers may be getting a little tired
of witnessing his performances on the same ground. The
stories in Tales of the Tenements (MURRAY) are all good,
and one of them—“A Mother for Heroes"—is excellent.
Indeed the book is just what I have come to expect from its
author, and if it is not likely to make many new Phill-
pottians it certainly ought not to disappoint the old ones.

PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARI.
[October 19, 1910.
TO A “FRENCHMAN.”
[Resident on the coast of Norfolk.]
HARD by the old-time haunt of Danish galleys,
Down wind you came against the marshland lights,
And on your legs the tint that marks a ballet's
Integuments (or tights).
Breast-high you flew, and every moment fleeter;
I could have floored you then with facile art,
But should most probably have couched a beater
Also within the cart.
And while I wondered whether I would chance it,
Risking a deed not readily unwrought,
You had arrived, and your immediate transit
Disturbed this train of thought.
Then as you grazed the hedge (and nearly slew me,
Missing by inches my averted nose)
A thrill from your exotic legs ran through me—
Legs like the pink, pink rose.
And ere your tail had cleared the zone of danger
The voice of Hospitality cried “No 1
He is a Frenchman, in your gates a stranger,
You must not lay him low!”
I thought of England's record, high and splendid,
For housing aliens from off the foam ;
How to the immigrant her arms extended
A furnished home from home.
Like Huguenots, I saw your fathers landing
Within the asylum of your kin and kind;
Would it enhance the Cordial Understanding
To hit you from behind 2
Such a discourtesy I calmly scouted,
And, as across the distant hedge you swung,
“Soyez tranquille, mon brave ami / " I shouted
(Using your own fair tongue).
And when I saw that you had safely quitted
The scene of carnage, settling in the roots,
I raised my restive muzzle and emitted
A brace of loud salutes.
You heard me from your cover, lying perdu ?

OLD CLOTHES.
SCENE–A Dressing - room. TIME-11.30 A.M. A large
wardrobe stands open with all its drawers pulled out.
All other drawers in other articles of furniture in the
room are also pulled out. Little heaps of clothes, shirts,
underwear, etc., cover the floor, the bed, the chairs and
the table. She is standing in the midst of the ruin.
He enters suddenly.
He. Oh, you're here, are you ? I've been hunting for
you all over the I say, by Jove, what have you been
up to with my clothes?
She. I'm just looking through them.
He. But I never asked you to look through them.
She. No, Charles, you didn't. There are lots of things I
do without being asked. Who gets the buttons sewed on
to your shirts? Who has the naughty holes in your socks
mended ? Who- but, of course, if you want me not to
I'll never do it again, no never. - -
He. But this isn't a button-sewing business. There are
no holes in my coats and waistcoats, and if there were you
couldn't mend them. Come, what's your game?
She. In the first place, you've no right to be here at all.
He. What " Not in my own dressing-room 2 Isn't that

He. I haven't gone. Changed my mind.
She. A man has no business to change his mind. For
all practical purposes I consider you are in London. You
don't exist here. ... I don't acknowledge you. Go away,
person. I've nothing for you.
He. I'll soon show you if I'm here or not.
[He seizes a heap of clothes and is about to restore them
to the wardrobe.
She, Stop! Those clothes are mine.
He. Yours / My old shooting suit!
She. Yes, mine. My dear Charles, you simply can't
wear them any more. They're falling to pieces, and what's
left of them is inches deep in dirt. I claim them.
He. Well, you're not going to have them. They're the
only really comfortable shooting things I’ve ever had.
She. Charles, it shall never be said that I wasn't reason-
able. You shall keep your dear old oily shooting things,
but you must give me this brown suit instead. It's a
sacrifice, but for your sake I'll make it.
He. But what in thunder do you want the clothes for 2
You can't wear them.
She. And how do you expect Mrs. Bradish's eldest boy
to get a place as under footman if he hasn't got a decent
suit to his back 2
He. I never had any expectations of any kind about him.
I don't know him. I don't know Mrs. Bradish.

clothes-stealing.
She. Pooh
He. What would you say if I were to have a turn
amongst your clothes, and bag some of your frocks and
things?

AN EMPTY SADDLE,
Down the hill path echo the hoof-beats hollow;
The empty saddle sways;
Sadly the road that weary feet must follow
Winds through the darkling braes'
Soft fall the clansman voices, hushed, complete in
A pathos worse than woe;
Meet tongue indeed to murmur of defeat in—
The Gaelic, gentle, low !
Up in the cliffs the raven cries for slaughter,
The caustic croaking mocks
A beaten man whose heart is in the water
That squelches in his socks.
Bird of ill omen, sombre and accurst one,
Be still upon your crag,
You surely don't suppose that I'm the first one
Who's missed a rotten stag?
“Duncan, as usual, carried the bunker guarding the first green
with his second shot, but Sherlock was trapped and lost the hole.
However, he drew level at the second and took the lead at the fourth,
where Duncan found a bunker, and never lost it to the end of the
match.”—Daily Mail.
Terrible handicap to a man to be saddled all day with a
bunker which he can't get rid of.

[October 19, 1910.
AN ENGLISHWOMAN'S GENSORED PLAY.
MR. FLORENCE HousMAID's long-
threatened reading of his great histori-
cal drama, Brocks and Benefits, occurred
yesterday in the Caxton Hall before
what was at the start a crowded and
enthusiastic audience.
The history of Brocks and Benefits,
although only too familiar to all readers
of The Times and Votes for Women, may
be briefly stated. On its subjection to
the Lord Chamberlain's office, in ac-
cordance with the rules of the game,
the play was returned without a licence.
No reasons were given, nor have any
since been vouchsafed to the author,
although a vast correspondence, marked
“Private and Confidential,” has passed
between Mr. REDFord and the lady who
was to produce the great work. Mr.
Housmaid is, however, under the im-
pression that the official objection to
the play is that among the characters
are Old King Cole and his cruelly ill-
used divorced wife, Queen Lemmevote;
he believes that it is because to show
English royalty in any light but that
of heroism and grandeur is, in a living
dramatist, unseemly, that the Censor
has been forced to take action. In
order to emphasise the anomaly which
permits an author to recite his own
sedition, indecency, slander, or what-
ever it may be, in a Town Hall, but does
not allow others to speak the same
words in a theatre, Mr. Housmaid
decided to give this reading. Such is
the history of yesterday's momentous
gathering. -
The Caxton Hall, never so home-like
as when English women are gathered
together there, was found to have been
newly furnished against the autumn
campaign. Carte blanche to make the
place at once cosy and durable had
been given to the Thames Iron Works,
and the result is all that can be desired.
The chairs are now wholly of good-
tempered steel, firmly bolted to the
floor, while the chairwoman's table is a
solid mass of Aberdeen granite.
For yesterday's function banners had
been prepared bearing such inflamma-
tory but necessary and, under the
circumstances, moderate, legends as
“Down with the Censor " " A bas
Earl SPEN C E R ' ' “Vive Rob ERT
HARCOURT!” “Unshackle the Drama '''
and so forth.
The early doors were besieged by a
long queue before the morn was grey.
Fortified with camp-stools, sandwiches
and the last number of Votes for Women,
the gallant band endured through the
long interval, not a little cheered by the
encouragement given them by errand
boys and the more conversational
members of the unemployed. By two
o'clock, when the doors were opened,
the concourse was so great that the
police had to be called in to regulate
it; and many were the greetings that
passed between the two bodies of
old friends. No unpleasantness marred
the proceedings and the hall filled up
as quietly and happily as it used to do
in the days of Merrie England, when
the good Caxton gave public readings
there from the Golden Legend.
The chair was taken by Mrs. PANK-
HURST, surrounded by some of the
principal dramatists and Suffragettes of
the day. One looked in vain for Mrs.
HUMPHRY WARD, but Mrs. PETHICK
LAwRENCE caught the eye wherever one
turned. At three o'clock precisely
Mr. Housmaid entered with a roll of
MS. in his hand, and the vast audience
rose to their feet, waved their handker-
chiefs and sang the National Anthem.
Silence being secured, the chairwoman
read a number of letters regretting
the absence of their writers, among
these being Sir ARTHUR PINERo, Sir W.
S. GILBERT, Sir A. CoNAN Doyle, and
Mr. HALL CAINE, and Mrs. PANKHURST
then delivered a brief address, intro-
ducing the dramatist to the company as
the most distinguished Englishwoman
on their roster (loud cheers), and not
only an Englishwoman, but one of the
most deserving of modern martyrs.
What LATIMER and RIDLEY, she said,
were to BLooDY MARY (sensation), so
was Mr. Housmaid to Earl SPENCER.
(Hear, hear.) She would not however
detain the meeting any longer.
Three groans having then been given
for the Censor and three cheers for the
other Cause, Mr. Housmaid, amid
thunders of applause, began to read.
Obviously a full report is impossible
here, but a brief précis may be at-
tempted. In the First Act King Cole
is seen wooing Lemmevote. She is
reluctant; he is ardent. She exacts
conditions; he promises everything.
They are betrothed.
In the Second Act he begins to tire,
and his ennui is only increased by her
insisting that his pledges shall be ful-
filled. What are these pledges? The
extension of the suffrage to every
woman. (Great enthusiasm.) The King
repudiates the suggestion and leaves for
Brighton, where he has a private Tivoli.
In the Third Act the Queen is seen
in her retirement leading a life of
studious seclusion, writing a political
pamphlet now and then, or soliloquising
at some length on the injustice done to
her sex.
In the Fourth Act we see the King
conspiring to be rid of Queen Lemmevote.
(Cries of “Shame.”) He arranges with
his creatures to accuse her of infidelity.
(Sensation.)
In the Fifth Act we see the trial
scene, in which the speeches of the
counsel for the defence are given in full.
Since the advocate was the famous
Long-wind Broom this Act takes three
hours to read. The Queen is, however,
found guilty, and the marriage annulled.
In the last Act Queen Lemmevote
repudiates man and all his works in an
impassioned peroration calculated to
bring the blush of triumph to the cheek
of every Suffragette, and the curtain
falls.
As it was now nearly midnight the
audience was not so crowded as at first,
but she clapped the reader very heartily
and they went out arm-in-arm.
A STRIKE AMONG THE POETS.
[Conspicuous among the few British indus-
tries that have not “come out” recently are the
Ballad-makers. But there are signs of trouble
even there.]
IN his chamber, weak and dying,
While the Norman Baron lay,
Loud, without, his men were crying,
“Shorter hours and better pay.”
Know you why the ploughman, fretting,
Homeward plods his weary way
Ere his time 2 He's after getting
Shorter hours and better pay.
See the Hesperus is swinging
Idle in the wintry bay,
And the Skipper's daughter's singing,
“Shorter hours and better pay.”
Where's the minstrel boy? I've found
him
Joining in the labour fray
With his placards slung around him,
“Shorter hours and better pay.”
Oh, young Lochinvar is coming;
Though his hair is getting grey
Yet I'm glad to hear him humming,
“Shorter hours and better pay.”
E’en the boy upon the burning
Deck has got a word to say,
Something rather cross concerning
Shorter hours and better pay.
Lives of great men all remind us
We can make as much as they.
Work no more, until they find us
Shorter hours and better pay.
Hail to thee, blithe spirit ! (SHELLEY)
Wilt thou be a blackleg 2 Nay.
Soaring, sing above the mélée,
“Shorter hours and better pay.”
-
“People differ so much in their tastes and in
their habits, that what would seem very nice to
one man makes another woman merely turn up
her nose.”—A Fruitarian Dietary.
Yes, yes; but what would she do if she
were another man 2

SOCKS AND THE MAN.
[“The reign of the passionate sock is over," says The Express in an
article on autumn fashions for men. But in handkerchiefs, it adds, a
man may “let himself go.”]
So we must part, belovéd socks
(Or, as the hosiers have it, “footwear");
Contemned your hues, run down your clocks,
'Tis now ordained you shall be put where
One puts one's left-off gear
(E.g., the bowler-hat of yesteryear).
I call to mind the day when first
You caught me in your silken meshes,
When on my dazzled gaze you burst
And proved how wayward human flesh is ;
You cost three bob a pair,
And I bought seven, and lunched that week on air.
I wore a different pair each day,
Each pair a different scheme of colour;
And when the wash called you away
The world seemed infinitely duller.
Through you I understood
How to express myself in every mood.
Did I aspire to paint the town,
My feet were cased in something ruddy,
Which peacefully gave place to brown
Whene'er my thoughts inclined to study;
And once I wore the green
While Tompkins flirted with my Angeline.
A thread of gold supplied the clue
When my ambitions turned to Mammon;
Down in the dumps, I sported blue,
And, when I felt erotic, salmon;
While for a Sunday shade
I fancied mauve to go with Church Parade.
Now all is done 'twixt you and me;
You're banished to a dark exile hence
By that imperative decree
Which dooms our socks henceforth to silence.
There is a power, my friends,
That disciplines our loud-hued nether ends.
Farewell! No more may I proclaim
Upon my feet each vagrant passion;
And yet I'm not disposed to blame
That very fickle goddess Fashion,
By whose indulgent leave
I'll wear my heart in future up my sleeve.
A Brilliant Finale.

ended."—Graphic.

TRACKING DOWN A ROMANCE.
“WATson,” said George, coming into
my chamber at five o'clock on Friday,
October 7th, “are you prepared? Put
your revolver in your pocket, pull your
hat over your eyes and face the new
problem.” -
“I am at your service, Holmes,” I
answered, thrusting away the work |.

getting my things together. “What is

“Call me George, and come along
and solve the mystery of the Stage
Romance. I have heard a paper-boy
shouting, and we must know the details
at once.”
We walked out of the Temple into
Fleet Street. “Surely,” I asked him,
“you are not going to sink so low as to
buy an evening paper. Is that playing
the game?”
“Buy a paper? Certainly not. What
are you thinking of 2 We must eluci-
date this dark affair from what the
posters tell us for nothing. Hist?” he
whispered, pointing to the first of them.
“Do you see it?
STAGE ROMANCE.
That means that there has been a
romance on the stage.” - -
“George,” I said, “you are positively
wonderful.”
“This is not a mere play, but some-
thing real, appallingly genuine. At
first I suspected another Peer and
another Chorus Girl. But I dismiss
that, for the poster would have put
more emphasis on the bridegroom and
less on the bride. It cannot be a
Peeress in her own right and a Chorus
Man, or they would have been more
explicit. Let us proceed.”
We turned our steps westward, and
at the corner of Wellington Street we
got our second clue.
ROMANCE OF POPULAR ACTRESS.
“That clears the field a little,” said
George. “We are left with four
possibilities—a marriage, a divorce,
theft of jewels or a sprained ankle.
Romance, with the press, is an elastic
term. We must get her name.”
“But will they tell us, unless we buy
a paper?”
“They must. They cannot help them-
selves. These posters simply cannot
keep a secret. They try every evening,
but invariably fail. The temptation
for each to go one better than the last
is irresistible. After all, a poster is
only human.”
At the corner of St. Martin's Lane
we found, as we expected, more expan-
siveness.
PopULAR Actricss's ENGAGEMENT.
CIVIL WAR IN POJ: TUGAL.
“Ignore the latter part,” said George,
“it is only a blind. We may now, I
think, eliminate all the popular actresses
who are securely married. There re-
main the Misses DARE, but they would
not have appeared anonymously even
on a poster. There also remains . . .
MARIE LöHR ENGAGED.
. . MARIE Löhr Ah, I suspected
as much.”
We had to walk to the further end of
Piccadilly Circus for more enlighten-
ment, and even that left us with much
to learn.
MARIE LöHR ENGAGED
TO A
POPULAR ACTOR.
There the matter seemed to end.
Search as we would, we could not
induce that secretive fiancé to emerge
into the light of publicity. Up and
down Piccadilly we walked, but we
could not find him out. “Obviously,”
remarked George, “a very retiring
fellow. Tell me the names of some
popular actors who are retiring.”
I thought hard. “No,” said I, “I
cannot do it. I can only think of popu-
lar actors I should like to see retiring.”
Depressed by the vain chase, we got
on to a bus going Kensingtonwards.
Though we kept our eyes wide open,
we could not get forward with it.
Rather we went backwards, back to
MARIE LöHR engaged, back to the mere
unnamed engagement, back even to the
stage romance. In despair we alighted
at South Kensington Station and turned
into a side street, and there, where we
least expected it, we got our climax.
ROBERT LORAINE ENGAGED
TO A
POPULAR ACTRESS.
George was all for going on with it.
“Turn back now, when we are just
getting to the details? My dear
James, with perseverance we may yet
find out how he worded the question;
whether she remarked on the suddenness
of it; how much the ring cost.”
But I insisted on withdrawing from
the affair. “If we go on with our
search, they will have to go on with
another climax. We cannot expect
them to get married this evening, and
we may force them into a disaster.”
George turned round. “You are
right,” he said reluctantly. “Perhaps
I ask too much. We are too fond of
Miss LöHR and Mr. LoRAINE to run any
risks with their happiness. It would
be a pity indeed if we were the inno-
cent cause of their breaking it off.”
So to be on the safe side we went
home by the Underground, sedulously
avoiding all placarded matter, save the
more familiar advertisements.
NoveLists As REFoRTERs. 1.
A contemporary has lately been
lamenting that the outlook for the
fiction-market is one of increasing
gloom. It is even suggested that
many of our leading novelists might
with more advantage employ their
pens in practical journalism.
We venture to submit below a few
sample extracts from the sort of thing
that might be expected should this
bright suggestion take effect:
I. THE EVENT.
During yesterday's severe storm, an
elderly gentleman named Jones was
knocked down by a motor-bus in Lud-
gate Circus, but fortunately escaped
without serious injury.
II. Its TREATMENT.
(a) By Mr. H. G. Wells.
“One of the most difficult and em-
barrassing features about this matter
of Jones is that one possesses no pre-
vious knowledge upon which to base a
definite and communicable idea of the
man . . . He just comes at one, as it
were, out of the murk of that afternoon, 1.
already a completed entity; Jones . . .
You picture him, a little, rotund
figure, pathetically bewildered, hesi-
tating in a blind, meaningless way
upon the edge of the curb. . . . All
round him, vague, storm-lashed shapes |
. . . distorted, unhuman things; police-
men, umbrellas, Fabians (ugh!) and the
like. And everywhere, noise . . .
“I might do it,” he said to himself, ſ
“with luck . . .”
“Now,” he said, “now . .
decided to chance it.
And then, you know, there was the
motor-bus. Quite suddenly it came,
a confused impression of more noise,
--
grown all at once ever so much more
insistent, overwhelming ... Hi, woosh!
“Mind' " cried Mr. Jones, “mind!”
He became amazedly conscious of
himself, stable in the midst of a
tumultuously whirling universe, the
centre of all kinds of bewildering
phenomena. Also that his nose, in
some unaccountable way, was bleeding.
“Damn !” he said . . .
(b) By Mr. William de Morgan.
Never tell us it was the driver's fault.
We know better. So also, for the
matter of that, does Lizeran herself, for
all she was running away, and, anyhow,
never no nearer the drattid thing than
the side of the pivement over agin the
Lud's Ed public. No, nor it wasn't
the Old Gentleman's fault neither. It
was, first and last, the storm's fault
entirely. So, at least, Mr. Ammond
said; and bless us! we suppose it will

be conceded that he ought to know
Mr. Ammond (this is what Lizeran
always called him—not for many years
to come will she suspect the absence of
that missing aspirate) was the guard of
the bus in question, and as kind and
veracious a man as ever drew breath.
He drew it with some difficulty that
afternoon, by reason of the same storm,
as aforesaid. Storm indeed, we should
rather think so; a regular oner, and no
mistake about it. They told each other,
down in the City, that there hadn't been
such wind- and rain between the days
of Ebenezer Scrooge and those of
Joseph Vance—and we leave you to
calculate what an interval that was
There was no possibility of escaping it.
It tore round corners, did that wind, at
Badness knows how many miles an
hour; whistling through keyholes, and
plucking slates off house roofs, as if on
purpose to make an opening for its ally
the rain. Bemuddling old gentlemen
was child's play to it. As Lizeran's
own daddy remarked, when he looked
out through the little window of the
jug-and-bottle entrance * >

About a quarter to five o'clock, on a
warm Saturday afternooninthelatesum-
mer of 1865 (a year notable for its fine
Saturdays), a small boy named David
Jones was standing in the bay window
of a large red-brick house in the High
Street of Bursley. He wore a jacket,
vest, and “knickers” of gray tweed, the
lining and buttons of which bore the
name of Brown and Son, the largest
retail haberdashers in the Five Towns,
whose shop stood at the upper end of
High Street, on the site at present
occupied by the Mechanics' Institute.
It was close upon half-a-century since
Brown, Sen., the head of the firm, had
established—[EDITOR. Has he anything
to do with the story 3 AUTHOR. Only
indirectly; it's all atmosphere. EDITor.
Cut it..] The boy's apparent costume
was completed by a pair of black
knitted stockings, and the same num-
ber of boots, rather small for their age.
Really, of course, he had other “things”
on, but I have no time to describe them.
He was thinking, very slowly and
comprehensively, about a large number
of subjects. He did it slowly, because
all action, whether mental or physical,
was notoriously deliberate in the Five
Towns at this period. Even a school-
bºy had been known to occupy twenty
pages of description in the simple pro-
cess of coming home to dinner.

He thought about Bursley, its history,
and the economic welfare of its in-
habitants for generations. Suddenly
the sight of his father coming along the
street caused him to smile happily.
He had discovered the subject for a
fresh digression.

Almost the first thing that John
Jones, David's father, could recollect,
was one winter morning when his aged
grandmother

However, to return to the small boy
who was looking out of the window.
After about two hours, David began to
be aware of subdued clattering sounds
coming from the direction of the
kitchen. He knew that these indicated
tea, and even very possibly gooseberry
jam. David's mother always made her
own gooseberry jam ; had done so, in-
deed, ever since one memorable July

[“One of the finest effects accomplished by the Gramophone has been

ONCE in the dear dead days for ever gone,
When after-dinner songsters were in boom,
First of our local bachelors I shone
The vocal star of many a drawing-room.
My life was fair, my lot was well-contented;
Raised to a mellow status all my own,
I was admired, till somebody invented
- That ruinous machine, the Gramophone.
Yes, in those flush and prospering times of yore
Oft'ner than not I had my victuals free, -
Dined rarely at my own expense—what's more,
Could frequently economise in tea.
The empty stomach loved of men of leading
I waived without a murmur; for my part,
I sang my finest after hearty feeding,
But mine was nature, theirs was only art.
Yet think not that I scrupled to enlist
Art to my needs; I had, when I began,
Twelve lessons from our local organist
(And twelve should be enough for any man);
'Twas he indeed that gave me skill to render
Shop-ballads with apparent grace and ease;
Sad songs, with a refrain to make them tender,
And published, as a rule, in several keys.
Ah, blessed songs! I sang them by the sheet;
Sang them in fullest measure, as implored
By many a dame whose feast was incomplete
Save for this voice which all her friends adored.
Bright was the present, and the future sunny;
Indeed, had things continued as they were,
It was supposed that I should marry money,
So popular was I among the fair.
But now, alas, how dark is my eclipse;
My ample jaws are sealed, and in their place
Yawns a colossal trumpet, from whose lips
Stentorian tenor vies with bull-voiced bass.
Bleating like goats or bellowing like thunder,
Now that in every home the echoes ring
With discy records of the great, what wonder
That amateurs are not allowed to sing?
And thus my social vogue has gone. To-day
Rarely the hostess bids me to the feast;
The local maidens pass me on the way
As tho' they'd never loved me in the least;
And—heaviest pang of all—when, after dinner,
I take my lonely stroll, or sit alone,
Borne on the breeze I hear, as I'm a sinner,
My own shop-ballads—on a Gramophone.

LAST week's correspondence in The

“listless demeanour of a great number
of those who visit and wander aim-
lessly about our museums” is about to
bear fruit shortly, and there should be
no further complaints about the “atmo-
sphere of mystery” and “lack of enter-
tainment" in these institutions. To
begin with, the British Museum, we
understand, is going to be White-City-
fied and generally livened up for the
Coronation year under the capable
management of Mr. IMRE KIRALFY as
Commissioner-General, assisted (under
protest) by the Director and Principal
Librarian, Dr. KENYoN, and by the
Keepers of Printed Books, Oriental
Manuscripts, Egyptian Antiquities, and
Mediaeval Ethnography, and the Heads
of the other departments.
The existing plainness and severity
of the fore-court, at present given over
to the gambols of pigeons, are to be
relieved by a Babylonian band-stand,
where classical renderings of music of
the time of DANIEL will be given on
the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery

“But surely,” queried the
indefatigable journalist, “it
is true that you were up at
Balliol with Mr. Asquith.”
“Well,” replied Mr. Bar-
becue, with some heat, “if
you must have the truth,
here it is. I went up to
matriculate at Balliol when
Mr. Asquith was there, but
failed, and subsequently went
to Durham.”
“Perhaps Mrs. Barbecue
might favour me with some
recollections of her distin-
guished relative.” ...
“She might have,” was the
rejoinder, “if she were alive,
but as she died fifteen years
ago, and as the present Mrs.
Barbecue is my third wife
and is not interested in
politics, I am afraid that I
cannot assist you in this
matter."
“What do you think Mrs.
Barbecue—I mean your first
wife—would have thought of

At this point Mr. Barbecue
assumed so menacing an

of The Inquisitor hastily
withdrew through an open

SPECTACULAR GOLF.
(Suggested by a recent contest.)
At the first hole Miss Beach's tee
shot hit a perambulator containing
twins, but unfortunately no casualty
occurred, though the occupants of the
perambulator were vocal in expressing
their indignation. Mr. Bilton, how-
ever, had better luck with his second—
a full iron shot against the wind which
struck on the right temple an aviator
who was hovering above the green
and brought him to earth like a stone.
To the general disappointment of the
crowd the airman only broke several
ribs and after a few minutes was able
to walk to the club-house without
assistance. Starting one down at the
second Miss Beach deliberately hooked
her drive into the crowd and a loud
yell from an elderly gentleman in a
check suit proclaimed the welcome
news that her shot had taken effect.
The victim, who seemed to be in great
agony, was removed on a stretcher by
the Bulliondale Golf Club Ambulance
Corps to the Cottage Hospital, but
rallied in the course of a few hours and
was able to proceed to his home in a
bath-chair. -
Meantime Mr. Bilton had not been
idle. His tee shot was a blank, but
with his second, a long raking brassie-
shot, he felled a sheep which had inad-
vertently strayed on to the course.
The hole was accordingly halved amid
great enthusiasm. No casualties oc-
curred at either the third or the fourth
hole and the crowd were beginning to
get somewhat impatient when Miss
Beach, with a masterly half-topped
drive from the fifth tee, hit and killed
on the spot a Pekinese spaniel which
had got inside the ropes. The specta-
tors were almost delirious with excite-
ment at this magnificent shot and
several minutes elapsed before the game
could be resumed.
Mr. Bilton was
evidently rather unnerved by this de-
monstration and, determining at all
hazards to hit something, sliced his
ball into his caddie. As by the new
rules such casualties do not count,
Mr. Bilton lost the hole. He reasserted
himself splendidly at the next hole.
Both the drives were blank, and Mr.
Bilton's second landed him in the deep
bunker guarding the green. Taking
his bull-dog niblick he made a splendid
recovery, laying the ball dead on the
nose of an intrusive spectator who was
craning eagerly over the ropes.
Later.—Result: Miss Beach won by
4 kills, 5 seriously wounded, 6 slightly
injured, to Mr. Bilton's 3 kills, 4 seri-
ously wounded, 8 slightly wounded.

No. V.--THE M.P.'s.
To Samuel Soames, Esq., M.P.,
The House of Commons.
DEAR MR. SoAMEs, On Thursday
evening next the motion to give facili-
ties for the Women's Franchise Bill
will be before the House. The Bill
must pass. We intend it to pass. We
have said so, and we are taking steps
to ensure it. To speak quite frankly,
we intend to make life unendurable for
those who are pusillanimous enough to
vote against the Bill. -
I am taking you into my confidence,
dear Mr. Soames, because I am quite
sure you are going to use your vote
and your very great influence on our
side. No sensible man could do other-
wise after studying the literature I
enclose, which sets out a few of our
main arguments. Please sign and
return to me your promise to vote for
the Bill. Yours for the Cause,
C. P.K.L. CYNTHIA PERKINs

(Answer: Mr. Soames has always
had the best interests of women deeply
at heart, and hopes to be in his place
on Thursday evening to record his vote
on the right side.)
DEAR MR. SoAMEs, Of course that
ridiculous Women's Franchise Bill
must be killed, and we are relying on
you to help in the good work. No
really nice woman wants the vote, and
no man who looks into the future with
the eye of a statesman would ever
jeopardise the safety of the Empire by
granting it. - - - - -- - - -
To vote for the Bill would mean ruin
to any man's political future, and we
are quite sure that you are clear-sighted
enough to see this. However, I am
enclosing a few pamphlets to help you
in your decision. Will you please sign
the promise to vote against the Bill?
Yours very truly,

(Answer: Mr. Soames has always
had the best interests of women deeply
at heart, and hopes to be in his place
on Thursday evening to record his vote
on the right side.)
DEAR SIR,--In case you have not
yet read my book, “The Scarlet Peril,”
I am enclosing a signed copy, with
compliments. You, I am certain, will
at once grasp its tremendous import to
the nation. As one of your consti-
tuents—I think I may say without
boasting, one of your most influential
constituents – I should be greatly
obliged if you would table the following
question in the House:— -
“To ask the Secretary of State for
War if he has read “The Scarlet Peril,'
by Captain Boffington Bulger, obtain-
able from all booksellers at 4s. 6d.
net, or direct from the author, ‘The
Banyans,” Diddlehampton, for 5s. 0d.
post free; and, if so, what steps he
proposes to take in view of the very
grave state of affairs divulged in the
said book.”
I hope, Sir, that you will not allow
this question to be burked or shelved,
but will press it before the House with
the utmost vigour.
Yours faithfully,
BoFFINGTON BULGER
(Late Captain the Diddlesex
- Volunteers).
(Answer: Mr. Soames has already
seen “The Scarlet Peril" on the book-
stalls, and would congratulate the
author on having brought the question
so vividly to the notice of the nation.
Mr. Soames has always had the matter
deeply at heart, and would gladly urge
it forward did not the interests of Party
discipline forbid. As a military man,
Captain Bulger will be the first to
appreciate the force of this objection.)
DEAR SIR,-No doubt you already
know the merits of our Five Star Bun-
dersleigh Nettle-Beer, but I am taking
the liberty of sending to your private
address a case of same for you to sample
at your leisure.
I am writing this to ask you if you
will please urge the Catering Committee
of the House of Commons to stock and
push this brand. Believe me, ours is
THE BEST. As our motto states, it is
“The King of Nettle-Beers and the
Nettle-Beer of Kings.” . . . . -
. . . Yours faithfully,
EBENEzER WILRs.
(Answer: Mr. Soames has always
had deeply at heart the fostering of
local industries. He proposes to for-
ward the sample case so kindly sup-
plied by Mr. Wilks to the Catering
Committee of the House of Commons,
where he hopes it will meet with the
treatment it so richly deserves.)
Dean Sin-of course you know that
I induced my uncle to vote for you at
the last Election, because I felt you
had such a beautiful outlook on the
Prevention of Cruelty to Rabbits Bill.
So now I am going to ask you a small
favour in return.
My dear boy, Gussie, has really
splendid abilities, but somehow he has
never seemed to find the proper scope
for them. You probably know that
he had to give up the Civil Service and
the Bar because of his dislike of the
ridiculous questions they set in the
examinations, and he never seemed
happy in schoolmastering, fruit-farm- |
ing in California, estate - managing,
journalism, tea - broking, pursing or
debt-collecting. The very post for him
would be by the side of some strong,
noble character, and that is why I
want you to take my dear boy as your
assistant private secretary and really
look after him and bring out the best
that is in him.
I have his boxes all packed and can
send him to you at a moment's notice.
Yours very truly, t
MADELINE LINDEN.

afraid my private secretary is terribly
cantankerous and difficult to get on
with.

have something or other deeply at

IT is idle to say that magic is no more, for a magician is
still among us and his name is Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING.
For that is the impression left upon one after reading
Rewards and Fairies (MACMILLAN): that its author is a
wizard. Certainly no such imaginative and vivid recon-
struction of old England has ever been accomplished as
you find here and in the first volume of the work—Puck of
Pook's Hill. I don't say the new volume is perfect. It
has nothing as remarkable and thrilling as “Dymchurch
Flit” in its predecessor; there are faults of vagueness, chiefly
the result of a leaping mind; the new verse is rarely
inspired and is often slovenly. But when one considers
the quality of Mr. KIPLING's invention, the piety of his
patriotism, the freshness and vigour of his style, and his
astounding understanding of men and movements, why
one forgets all about these little trifling defects and again
murmurs, “Wizard.” HAZLITT said of KEAN's acting that
it was like reading SHAKSPEARE by lightning. One might
adapt this to Mr. KIPLING, and say that these two whim-
sical illuminating books are like reading English History
by the light of the Will-o'-the-wisp.
Prester John (NELsoN) was a sort of Ethiopian Napoleon
of the fifteenth century who left behind him a kingdom, a
tradition, and a collar of rubies, which were all equally fine
and large. In these degenerate days his mantle and his
rubies fell upon the swarthy shoulders and encircled the
ebon neck of the Rev. John Laputa, in this country a
Christian minister and the darling of Exeter Hall, in his
own a splendid specimen of the noble savage and the head
of a great Kaffir rising which must have swept the English
out of South Africa into the sea if David Crawfurd, a
young Scots storekeeper at Blaauwildebeestefontein, had
not nipped the conspiracy in the bud. Davie was wise
and brave beyond his years, and the story of his hair-
breadth escapes and adventures is as thrilling as anything
I have read since the golden hour in my undergraduate
days when the opening chapters of Treasure Island first
enthralled me. Our wee Davie and the boy - hero of
Treasure Island are like each other in many ways. They
both draw maps of the scene of their adventures, both
overhear important conversations, both do many brave
things and at least one foolish one—which turns out for
the best—and the female element is religiously excluded
from both their books. But I cannot carp at this resem-
blance (not to speak of the dash of King Solomon's Mines
which I find in Prester John), because in spite of it Mr.
John BUCHAN is himself all the time and no copyist, and
has shown me that I am still boy enough to revel in trea-
sure-hunting and the splendid deeds of youth quite as much
as in reading reports of league football matches or the
ineffectual struggles of my middle-aged friends against
Colonel Bogey. And I believe that the colonel and his
victims would all agree with me and become boys again if
they would only take my advice and read Prester John.

advantage of living seventy years ago must have been that

nobody could write jolly books about the manners and
customs of the period; for there is no doubt that our
grandfathers and grandmothers had very little idea how
eccentric they were. This being so, when we boast of our
advance in science and engineering, of our improved taste
in furniture, and the triumphs of the Daily Press, let us
ask ourselves if we are doing our duty (as drolls) to the
literature of posterity, and, if not, feel slightly ashamed.
Early Victorian (SMITH, ELDER) purports to be a series of
sketches of the principal inhabitants of Basset in the pre-
railway epoch, but S. G. TALLENTYRE has enlivened it with
enough plot for the makings of a genuine novel. With Pollie
Latimer, with the two doctors of Basset, with Parson Grant
and with Rachel Pilkington you ought certainly to become
acquainted, for their habits form very delectable reading.
“Mrs. Benet . . . after some cogitation purchased the
wedding present—a large china lady clad in a short but
not indecent pink skirt, and listening attentively to a shell.
The Doctor and Maggie were both
well told has all the makings of a popular success—the
point is one that might with advantage be elucidated.
Meanwhile I content myself with saying that I read every
word of it.
When I read a story of mysterious and sinister murder,
of elaborate but inevitable detection, I insist upon knowing
the murderer from the start, hobnobbing intimately with
him, but never for a moment suspecting that he is the
guilty party. I am, I feel, entitled to my complete sur-
prise, certainly to my strain of perpetual excitement. In
The Mummy Moves (WERNER LAURIE) I got neither.
Alfred Eastman was murdered in his lonely flat. I knew
at once, though the others had their doubts, that his nephew
Fabian was not responsible. To confirm that surmise,
Fabian got murdered himself, and the double suspicion
then pointed to Edward Steward. “Don't you believe it,”
said I, but Detective Dodson, being less shrewd, still needed
conviction, and Edward's throat also
was fatally slit. After that I gave
called into the clammy closeness of
the parlour to inspect this offering.
Maggie said “Lor!' and declared
herself that glad she was not going
to have the dusting of it. ‘Very
unique indeed, Jeannie, I should say
—very unique,' was the doctor's
observation; and seeing the word
Miranda at the lady's base, he added
that it had escaped him for the mo-
ment who Miranda was. “That's
for them to find out,' said Mrs.
Benet, as if she were setting the
bridal pair a conundrum.” The
author has shown a rare vein of
sympathy for those homely virtues
which our ancestors did possess, and
I can only hope that if we do after
all appear amusing to the writer of
1980 we shall be treated as leniently
as this.

Simply the name of a murderer was

The ultimate incrimination of a

tempted to account for the whole
affair thus. A friend of Mrs. MARY

assuming himself to be a childless widower, proposes
to the heroine, and, in the very moment of acceptance,
meets an infant who mentions a secretive mother, and
has eyes that remind him of the past—well, most of
Mrs. CoMYNs CARR's readers will know what to expect.
Nor will they be disappointed. Even to the death of
the superfluous wife in the last chapter, all the familiar
thrills are provided ; but what is more surprising is that
they do quite genuinely thrill; which I take to be a singular
testimony to the writer's craft. I confess myself baffled,
however, to account for the startling change by which
Mrs. CoMYNs CARR, having located her earlier scenes at
Dover, suddenly begins to speak of them as happening at
Folkestone. This confused me frightfully; especially as
the wife was at that moment escaping to France, and the
ambiguity appeared likely to extend itself to the other side,
both Calais and Boulogne being mentioned as her destina-
tion. When I remind you gently of the title of the book
you will appreciate the humour which I could expend upon
this, and do not. Still, I think that should other editions be
called for—as they almost certainly will be, since a tale so
Bengalee :—
“Owing to the drizzling rain which fell all day, the programme of
the contest was much affected though no sooner the rain ceased, all
the parties went out barring the Canal Sporting Club, who were much
lº by a few of their men taking to the Football field and were
obliged to abandon the contest, and joined Mr. K. D., Ghosh's party
and spent, an enjoyable evening by watching the beautiful sceneries of
the embankment. Lovely songs were sung with great gusto at intervals.
“It being settled that the contest should start from the Railway
Bridge to White Bridge or New Bridge, and vice rersa, Mukherjee's team
crossed first with the guidance of their skilful helmsman Mr. M. N. Bose,
leading by 5 yds. and was declared winners, Mr. Mitter's team who fought
keenly all along cleverly turned back and reached the starting point first
spreading the news that they were the winners. Then Mr. G. N. Dutt's
team without giving the least notice of their start to Mukherjee's team,
who were then taking their refreshment and preparing themselves for the
fresh fight, crossed and reached the starting point. Lastly, Mr. Mukherjee's
team being stunned at the unsporting spirit shown against them,
returned home, leisurely but sadly being last on this occasion.
“However, judging the game from the above, the contest was unde-
cided as all the three teams claimed to be the winners. It is sad that no
decision could be arrived at mutually, and unless some rules are framed,
it seems almost certain that nothing satisfactory will be arrived at, a
thing much to be avoided in the interest of sport and all concerned.”
Mr. Punch, who is also greatly concerned, has pleasure
in offering his best aquatic sympathies to all the various
winners of this historic contest.

POLITICS FOR THE PULPIT.
[“I find it rather difficult during this period of conferring (laughter)
without doing some mischief to engage in an ordinary political con-
troversy.”—ºpening of Mr. Lloyd George's recent sermon at the City
Temple.]
THE following little speech is intended as a guide to any
Radical politician who may have the good fortune to
secure a place of divine worship for his next electioneering
campaign. Veneration for his surroundings will very
properly put a check upon the more violent methods of the
secular hustings. But under the guise of an unprejudiced
reformer he may do a lot of quiet party work by sug-
gesting that the conduct of certain classes, which chiefly
belong to the Other Side, are at the root of our national
evils, and that if His Side were given a free hand England
would soon be turned into a Garden of Eden.
My beloved Brethren, Heaven forbid that I should
profane this sacred edifice—designed, as it is, for religious
worship—by introducing any element of political partisan-
ship into my discourse; but I do say that, if we wish to
correct the social evils which we all deplore, we must seek
some likelier cure for them than Tariff Reform. . .
A wave of revolutionary feeling is sweeping over the
countries of the earth. You trace it even in Britain, where,
under the blessings of our present fiscal system, the poorest
enjoy Free Food; you can therefore imagine what it must
be like in countries that labour under the curse of Protec-
tion. . . .
Charity is the first of Christian virtues, and I will there-
fore give his due to the dev–to the inventor, that is, of
Tariff Reform—and say that it was Mr. CHAMBERLAIN who
forced our attention upon the poverty in our midst, at the
time when he published his raging and tearing propaganda.
But he failed to lay his finger upon the cause of the disease.
Where lies that cause? It lies, my Brethren, with the
IDLE RICH.
Standing here, a preacher in the House of God, I will
not speak of them as bloated Tories, but you know very
well what I mean. There are myriads of them on the free
list—practically a charge upon the State, just like Old Age
Pensioners. -
And how do they spend their unearned leisure, these
landed loafers? They spend it on golf courses; they spend
it in motors, invariably exceeding the speed limit. Not that
I condemn these pastimes as heinous in themselves, so long
as they are used, as in my case, merely to recharge the
nerve-cells exhausted by devotion to altruistic labour.
But there are bloodier sports than these (I do not,
of course, refer to the pursuit of rabbits, the sole relaxa-
tion left to the poor down-trodden agricultural classes).
And here let me quote from the inspired words that fell
from the lips of one of our greatest divines, Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE, in the course of that sermon in the City Temple
for which its pastor, the Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL, prognos-
ticated immortality: “Among the many contrasts,” said the
preacher, “which a rich country like ours presents between
the condition of rich and poor, there is none more striking
than the profligate extravagance with which land by the
square mile is thrown away upon stags and pheasants and
partridges, as compared with the miserly greed with which
it is doled out for the habitations of men, women and
children.”
Thank God, I have never spilt the blood of innocent
bird or beast. But I have seen fertile tilths laid bare as
the arid wastes of Sahara, and their struggling tenants
forced into urban slums, just that the land might serve as
a better breeding-ground for partridges. I have seen the
everlasting hills of Argyll and Inverness, once the thriving
centres of the white-heather industry, swept clean of their
teening population, that my lord might get a clearer view
of the stag whose blood he wants. Always blood–blood
where there should be bloom ; the people's good sacrificed
to A. gore.
nd this is the class that makes so loud a fuss about
Form IV.
Dearly beloved Liberals—fellow-worshippers, I should
Y|say—I will forbear to traverse the argument that to this
same class we have always owed the highest unpaid
service in Parliament and elsewhere; I will ignore the
allegation that upon their capital, invested in numberless
enterprises, the people depend for their employment, not
less than upon earned wealth; I will refrain from answer-
ing those who pretend that our present fiscal system may
have contributed something to the decline of agriculture
and the resulting congestion of our towns. All this would
mean a discussion of political and economic facts for
which the pulpit is no place.
That restraining thought further precludes me from
suggesting any scheme by which the wealth of the country
might be increased. I am permitted merely to remind you
how it is written: “The Earth is the People's and the
fulness thereof"; and to show that by concentrating upon
its usurpers those weapons of taxation which Heaven has
placed in our hands we may yet see it restored to its
rightful owners for purposes of redistribution.
My brethren, with the eye of faith I look forward, like
Moses upon the peak of Pisgah, to a day when the hoot of
the profligate's motor shall be heard no more in the land;
when the niblick of the idle plutocrat shall be turned into
a ploughshare; when every son of toil shall be free to sit
under his own vine and fig-tree, feeding his own tame
partridge. Then, and not till then, and only by our agency
(acting under Providence), shall these isles of Britain
become like a little Heaven below. Amen. O. S.

MISUNDERSTOOD.
THE thing has become a scandal,
and it is time to tell the truth about it.
Henry informs me that I have been
cxpelled from the Athenaeum and
the Supper Club, and that I am to be
asked to resign from the Muswell Hill
Choral Society. Mrs. Rogers cut me
in Sloane Street yesterday, and Miss
Hurlingham now signs herself, “I am,
yours sincerely,” instead of “Believe
me, yours most sincerely.” In short a

Blake, who has announced publicly
that he will never play Bridge with
me again.
Blake is the worst Bridge player I
have ever seen. I should say that
hate it.” And the conversation was
changed for the moment.
Henry drew Blake that cvening.
Blake went no-trumps on a strongish
hand, and Henry put down his cards
and went upstairs for his pipe. Charles
and I settled down to lose.
It was clear at once that Blake was
in slightly worse form than usual.
Charles accordingly weighed in with
two revokes, and I assisted with one.
To our horror Blake never noticed
them. Charles tried to call attention
to his by leading out the cards which
he should have played before, and

“Oh, I don't know,” said Henry
modestly. “One gets into the way of it.”
“Let’s have a new pack,” I said, as
I swept the cards hastily together.
“There's a mark on one of these.”
“Yes, I noticed it too,” said Henry.
“The two of clubs, wasn't it? There's
a new pack in the drawer.”
Charles dealt with the other old
pack. He had the ace, king, queen,
knave, ten, seven, and two of hearts.
So he left it to me. I had a very
strong hand in clubs, spades, and
diamonds—but I only had three little
hearts. So I went them.

But the four of us were

game at Bridge. Worse
than that, he insisted
on playing for money—

pound or so which I had acquired was
not money to be proud of in these
particular circumstances, and that I
was blessed if I would take any more
from him. And Charles and Henry
felt the same.
“There's only one thing for it,”
said Charles. “We must lose to-
night.”
“What's the good of saying that ?”
I said; “we try every night.”
“We don't try hard enough. We
try not to win, but that's not the same
as trying to lose. Anyone can lose
anything if he really tries.” -

table, looking at them sadly and wait-

came. I took out a pencil and wrote
on the two of clubs, “Charles has
revoked twice, and I have revoked once.
I shall probably revoke again. We
look to you to claim them,” and I put
the card on Henry's chair.
If he hadn't come in then I don't
know what would have happened, but
just as Blake was leading he appeared.
“Hallo,” he said, “what—” and then
I gave him a terrific kick. “Conf

having read my message, sat down and
began to rub his ankle. “The rest are
yours,” I said, throwing down my
cards, and then Henry spoke up like a
man rather than a dummy.
Suddenly I caught Charles's eye.
He looked at me with an expression of
agony. Then he leant back in his
chair and gazed up at the ceiling and
gave a deep sigh. . . . .And then all at
once he began to giggle hopelessly.
We won the odd. We couldn't help
it. At the end of the game Blake said
very calmly to Charles: “Let me see,
you had seven hearts, hadn't you, and
all the honours ?”
“Awfully lucky, wasn't it?” said
Charles, looking rather foolish. “Your

[A newspaper for children is the latest Car-
melite enterprise. “Only the broader issues

scheme is similar.]
THE OUTLook.
AN IRISH IMBROGLIO.
THE sad case of Little John NIE
REDMoND and the pea-shooter should
be a lesson to all of us to say what we
mean and mean what we say. Little
John NIE has for years and years been
crying for a real gun, which his kind
grandfather, Mr. Bull, refused to give
him. One day, to every one's surprise,
John NIE turned round and said he did
not want a gun any more. All he
wanted was a pea-shooter. This Mr.
Bull very likely would have given him,
but all of a sudden Little John NIE
denied that he said it, and again stated
that he must have a gun or nothing.
It is thought that another little boy,
John NIE DILLON, may have screwed
his arm till he said this, but anyway
it is now quite likely that he will get
nothing. Remember from this that
one should know one's own mind and
stick to it. -

MECHANICAL Toys.

Paris, Oct. 25.
Our Paris correspondent, telegraphing
last night, states that from inquiries
that he has made he learns that the
supply of new mechanical toys for the
coming season is likely to be greater
than ever. The aeroplane will probably
continue to be the favourite, but a toy
submarine (for deep baths) is also pro-
mised.

Academy to abolish irregular verbs and
make every noun the same sex has
failed utterly.—Reuter.
THE GREAT BEAR.
(From Our Own Correspondent.)
Washington, Oct. 25.
It is now practically decided that the
toy opossum which was invented as a
compliment to President TAFT is a
failure. The Teddy Bear was too
strong for it. I let you know this
at the earliest opportunity so that
bear-lovers may be reassured of the
supremacy of their favourite animal.

The supply of Spanish chestnuts,
both for icing and for roasting, is
excellent. Shipments to England are
being made daily.

The Roman Candle factories were
never busier than at present, so that a
successful Fifth of November may be
counted upon, provided always that the
weather is favourable. A new kind,
containing as many as twenty-four
stars of all colours, is to be the novelty
of the 1910 season. English parents
should order early as the demand is
expected to be enormous.

“It is neither profitable nor interesting to
attempt to reconcile his [Mr. REDMond's] con-
tradictory statements. The only noteworthy
thing is that he has been induced to send up

Wallondessai, however, is so clever
an aviator—he comes about next to
PAULHAN and was lately betrothed to
Mlle. Dorgère, the famous actress—that
he will probably descend safely.
“Upon the River Committee reporting that
they could not recommend the adoption of the
Surveyor's estimate of £26 for re-facing the

TRYING THE COUNSEL.
CoNTEMPTUous IMPREssions of A
CAUSE CELEBRE.
(With acknowledgments to “The
Daily Chronicle.”)
It is ten o'clock on a cold and raw
morning as I make my way into the
court, and at once experience a bitter
disappointment with the stage setting of
the great criminal trial I have been com-
missioned to report. The court is too
new to be impressive and too ugly to
be interesting. One feels that it would
be better filled for a mothers' meeting
than a cause célèbre, but having come
I am bound to make the best of it.
Some one says, “That's Bungay,”
and we all look at the Counsel for the
Treasury who has just arrived and is
talking-to Sir Jonas Bulteel. In the
excessive corpulence of his person and
the portentous gravity of his beefy face
Bungay for the Treasury looks like
a gormandising archdeacon. Shortly
after a diversion occurs among the
knowing ones. Mandible, K.C., has
arrived. I am told that Mandible, K.C.,
has made a great reputation on the
Eastern Circuit, but we all know what
is the level of intelligence in Silly
Suffolk. Mandible, K.C., is a slim man
with features reminding one of an old-
fashioned latchkey: a ridiculous little
mouth and a voice like a dissipated
buzz-saw.
Sir George Alexander arrives and
talks with Lord Martin Harvey.
Modish women fill the public seats.
Sir Gulliver Stodge, with his splendid
dome-shaped head, engages me in con-
versation on eschatological problems.
At last the jury file in, the court rises
and the judge enters .

might imagine a penguin delivering
a lecture or a pelican addressing
a wilderness of idiotic deaf mutes.
I close my eyes. . . . It is one o'clock
and Bungay is still droning on. Thank
heaven the luncheon interval will soon
be here.
After lunch come the witnesses, and
the day becomes a little brighter.
Bungay examines with exasperating
calm. Mandible, K.C., cross-examines
with epileptic vigour. And gradually
one perceives a new factor in the
problem, a new aspect of the drama.
The prisoner is already forgotten; more
and more is it clear that the real
interest of the case lies in this gro-
tesque duel between these two pre-
posterous counsel, the bulky Bungay

and the cadaverous Mandible. Sir
Sloman Boyle, the famous novelist, can
scarcely smother his smiles. Lord
Martin Harvey wears an expression of
wearied urbanity, and Sir Wilkie Bard
is openly guffawing. To me the scene
is full of exquisite significance. . . .
Bungay puts up Haskett-Tomkins to
conduct the examination of the witness
Giddy. Giddy is like a lugubrious
comedian, and Haskett-Tomkins like a
dishevelled cockatoo. Amid the public
seats the great dome of Sir Gulliver
Stodge's head, with which I have so
many and so deep conversations, shines
out like the cupola of some mighty
mosque. . . .
At 5 o'clock, when I come out into
the rainy lamplit streets, I have for-
gotten the very name of the prisoner
on trial for his life. I can only think
of the portly Bungay, the emaciated
Mandible, and the famous and illus-
trious men who have conferred dignity
on the proceedings by their stimulating
presence—Sir Sloman Boyle, Sir Gil-
bert Pinutro, the Baron de Silva, Lord
Aubrey Blond, and my old friend Sir
Gulliver Stodge. In spite of moments
of discouragement one feels that there
never can be a miscarriage of justice
when such men are present in Court.

ALTHOUGH perhaps it is a little early
to embark on the Christmas-Boxing
campaign, the wise woman will do well
to pause before the counter of the
furriery department. The firm of
Torrey and Bunting have been singu-
larly fortunate in securing the services
of the specialist who presides over the
domain of high-class peltries. A man
of dignified appearance and archi-
diaconal deportment, he inspires in all
his subordinates a reverential attitude
towards the wares which it is his high
prerogative to bring together. A talk
with him is a lesson not only in the
of light on the psychology of fashion.
To descend from generalities to the
concrete instance, one may note a
lovely little bascule jacket orchestrated
with blandamer and angelica, a de-
lightfully macabre effect being achieved
at the back by the application of
lozenge-shaped motifs in shrimp pink
caracule, the chic and style whereof is
undeniably good and exclusive. But
the full effect of the bascule jacket
cannot be attained without its accom-

Among other notable offerings in
these sumptuous show-rooms let me
mention an authentic Yehonala evening
toilette of crimson crash, in which the
corsage, resting on a soft fold of grey
transparency, has an imprévu touch
introduced in a soupçon of vieuw
bleu stockinette. But the pièce de
résistance are the machicolated kimono
sleeves of snow-white ermine. Only
an artist replete with moral courage
would have ventured on so exalted a
contrast.
In conclusion, one notes the signifi-
tessitura of furriery, but throws a flood cant amount of space accorded to old-
world berthes, a fact that testifies more
eloquently than any words of mine the
admirable eralté enterprise maintained
throughout this department.

states that Señor Canalejas, the Spanish
Premier, “has been called the Lloyd
George of Spain.” And The West-
minster Gazette, after stating that the
French Premier is “armed with a
strong but flexible conscience,” goes on
to remark that “in a general way it
may be said that M. BRIAND seems
most nearly to suggest Mr. LLoyd

what they say in Spain and France
respectively on these matters. It is |
noticeable that in Lancashire they
speak of Naples as the Blackpool of |
Italy, but that Italians do not generally |
endorse this comparison.

THOSE MISERABLE SINNERS WHO HAPPEN
OUR LEADERS DAY BY DAY.
November 1.—In a general letter to
the Press Mr. F. E. SMITH declares
himself in favour of the Payment of
Members, Universal Suffrage, and the
Endowment of Fatherhood.
Rapture of The Morning Post, which
announces that these three points are
essential developments of the policy of
Tariff Reform.
November 2.—MR. WANKLYN proposes
a scheme of Home Rule involving
separate Parliaments for England,
Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Isle
of Wight.
The Standard says: “This spirited
proposal of Mr. WANKLYN, who so long
and ably represented Bradford as a
Unionist, is obviously in the interests
of Tariff Reform. Why should Ireland,
which is essentially a Tariff Reform
country, have to wait till the obfuscated
Cobdenites of industrial Lancashire
have ruined the trade of Great Britain
and Ireland alike 2 ” .
November 3. —In another general
letter to the Press Mr. F. E. SMITH
announces that he has been gradually
driven to the conclusion that the aboli-
tion of the House of Lords is not only
desirable but inevitable.
In a spirited article The Globe points
out that Unionists now have a straight
lead on this important question whilst
the Radicals are still wallowing in a
quagmire of indecision.
November 4. — Earl WINTERTON
writes to the press that after much
careful thought he has come to the
conclusion that the Osborne judgment
must result not only in the payment
of members but in the payment of can-
didates. In this and Tariff Reform he
sees the doom of unemployment.
Excitement of Mr. LEO MAxSE who
in a letter to The Evening Standard,
headed “A Lead for our Mandarins,”
enthusiastically endorses the noble
Earl's proposal.
November 5. — The Morning Post
warns Mr. BALFour that unless he
gives a clear and definite lead to the
party in his speech at Glasgow that
night the consequences will be disas-
trous in the extreme.
Speaking at Glasgow Mr. BALFour
devotes forty-five minutes of his speech
to an exhaustive examination of the
Education question and concludes by
saying, “As for the questions of Pay-
ment of Members, Universal Suffrage,
Tariff Reform, Home Rule, and the
House of Lords, our policy has been
always so clearly defined that it is un-
necessary for me to dwell upon them
here. No one can doubt that when
these important questions are solved,
as solved in time they will be, the
solution will rest in the hands of the
Unionist Party.”
November 7.-For the twentieth time
The Morning Post warns Mr. BALFour
that this will never do.
An enthusiastic leader in The Daily
Telegraph begins “Foolish babblers on
Radical platforms have alleged that
Mr. BALFour is mentally incapable of
giving a definite lead to his party. To
these his Glasgow speech must come
as a crushing surprise. Not since the
days of BEAconsfield has the Con-
servative party rejoiced in such a clear
and definite statement of its case.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[October 26, 1910.
AT THE PLAY.
“GRACE.”
At the start we find her, this Grace
Insole, thoroughly bored with her hus-
band, who was too dull, and the view
from her windows, which was too rural.
Ten years ago, a town-bred girl of the
middle-classes, she had married (nobody
knows why) into a stodgy county
family of mid-Victorian manners most
uncongenial. Out of curiosity and
ennui, she had sought diversion in a
rather insipid intrigue, to which her
heart was never committed ; and of
this too she is sick. Still she contrives
a sort of cynical gaiety, and has a
habit of saying anything that occurs
to her without regard to anybody's
feelings. Her husband adores her by
mere infatuation, and it is
quite clear that she hasn't a
soul to speak of and is incap-
able of any deep feeling.
Well, by the end we see
her racked with an excru-
ciating remorse and passion-
ately in love with her husband,
body and soul. How to ac-
count for this staggering
change? Three things have
happened in the interval: (1)
The keeper's daughter has
“got into trouble” and been
warned off the place. This is
the silly “law of the estate";
and, further, Claude Insole
is under the impression that
she might contaminate the
atmosphere imbibed by his
wife. The girl kills herself,
and Grace takes on the re-
sponsibility for this act on
the ground that her husband
would never have been so hard on her if
he had known that his own wife was
beyond contamination. (2) The keeper,
having relieved his grief with alcohol,
threatens his master with a loaded gun.
Insole exhibits a sangfroid so consider-
able that it moves his wife to admira-
tion. (3) A Miss Vernon of Foley, an
eligible member of a neighbouring
county family, informs Grace that she
has always been in love with Insole,
thus throwing fresh light on that
gentleman's virtues.
The first of these influences may
help to explain the wife's new-found
remorse; but not one of them, nor all
three put together, can even begin to
explain her volte-face from indifference
and boredom to passionate adoration,
physical and spiritual. And here lies
the weakness of a strong play.
A very interesting problem is raised
when Grace takes counsel with herself
and others on the matter of confession.
Her own natural instincts incline her
Claude Insole ...
Gann ... ---
Grace Insole
to this course. Her brother-in-law,
the Reverend Archibald Insole, quotes
Scripture in its favour. But Miss Ver-
mon of Foley, chiefly concerned for the
man she loves, says that confession
would be an act of pure selfishness,
certain to ruin the husband's life. Let
Grace show her repentance by bearing
alone the purgatory of her secret. To
live under the shadow of the constant
memory of her unfaithfulness to the
man she now adores would furnish an
ample means of redemption.
The curtain falls on Grace heroically
determined to follow the lady's advice.
Meanwhile, though the Coroner's
jury had given the husband a warm
time, no one had so much as hinted of
any contribution on his part towards
his wife's infidelity; no one had had

the wit to suggest that he was re-
sponsible for the environment which
had choked her, and that he might well
have borne his share of the purging.
The play was relieved by a good
deal of humour not quite of the highest
class. It was chiefly done by rude-
ness. Cobbet, the second-rate lover,
was incredibly ill-mannered to the
mother-in-law. And the old lady, in
turn, got most of her effects by stamp-
ing insufferably on people's toes. Her
callousness over the news of the death
of the keeper's daughter was really
painful. “Chattering like that,” says
somebody, “when the poor girl's lying
dead!” “That's life,” says another.
But, of course, it isn't life or any-
thing like it.
The lighter part of the breakfast-
scene was charmingly stage-managed,
but the trouble with Insole's house was
that there was no visible library in
which he could interview his keeper,
so he had to receive him in the draw-

ing-room, gun and all. That isn't
“life" either. -
I have cavilled at the inconsequence
of Grace's character, but Miss IRENE
WANBRUGH, who interpreted it, played
with the greatest distinction in a part
that strained her nervous energy almost
to the snapping-point. I was not de-
ceived into supposing that Mr. DENNIs
EADIE was actually the head of an
ancient family of country gentlemen;
but Insole was no ordinary squire, and
Mr. EADIE very cleverly succeeded in
making him that rare thing, a sympa-
thetic prig.
Lady TREE gave an admirable study
in the antique, though Mrs. CALVERT
would have played the part of old
Mrs. Insole with less accentuation of
its points.
Mr. GweNN perhaps under-
rates the status of a game-
keeper, but he got every
ounce out of the stuff of his
situations and still kept some
reserve of force in hand.
As for Miss LILLAH
McCARTHY, when I first saw
her representing an alleged
specimen of a crusted county
family, I couldn't conceive
what she was doing there;
but I understood later on,
when she threw off her dis-
guise and attacked a moral
problem in the right VE-
DRENNE-BARKER manner.

There was a problem here, too. How
is a Huguenot lady who, to save her
lover's skin, is forced into marrying
a Catholic swashbuckler whom she
loathes — how is she to get to
adore him 2 Well, she does, but I
never found out why. It was not
his courage, for she was painfully
aware of that to start with ; nor his
manners, which were of the worst all
through. It couldn't have been merely
because he smacked her on the face
with his glove, for he did this as soon
as they were married, and besides she
wasn't really a Shrew to be tamed that
way. I got no help from the study of
Miss LILY BRAYTON's features, which
up to the last minute preserved a
fairly stolid expression of hopeless
misery. Perhaps the lady's mind got
unhinged. Anyhow the workings of
her conscience were most erratic. At
one moment she refused to allow a

IT's such
Huguenot minister to steal the king's
despatch ordering a massacre in Angers;
at the next she was quite ready to
pinch it herself from under her hus-
band's pillow. Of course I know that
when your husband deserts his own
side and disobeys his king's commands
all for love of you, it is a kind of com-
pliment. But even so . . .
However, one does not look for too
much probability in this kind of play.
The knockabout business is the thing,
and that part of it went amazingly
well. I must say I love to watch Mr.
OscAR Asche striding about in clatter-
ing armour with pistols in his belt and
a sword at his side, and a dagger lashed
to what was once the small of his back.
And the audience was simply fascinated
by the brutality of his methods. But
I was sorry for that sterling actor,
Mr. BEN WEBSTER, who was a little
overborne by the enemy's bulk in his
thankless part of a Huguenot aristocrat
who doesn't mind fighting like a gentle-
man (he and Mr. Asche were admirable
in their duel), but has a prejudice against
the more irregular forms of death.
Mr. DoRAN as a Protestant minister
played soundly, and I liked the manner
of that stout henchman and soldier of
fortune, Badelon (Mr. Athol, FoRDE).
The scenery was most effective; the
crowds did good work both on and off
the stage; and the whole thing went
flowingly. Mr. and Mrs. OscAR Asche
received an extremely cordial welcome
on their return from the other side of
the earth, and the former in a brief
speech said how glad he was to have it.

A Bull Toasted Whole.
It is interesting to learn from the
report of the West London Observer
that at the dinner celebrating the ex-
tension of the Hammersmith Consti-
tutional Club premises the toast of
“The Conservative and Unionist Party,
coupled with the name of Sir William
Bull, M.P.” was heartily received and
suitably responded to by Sir WILLIAM
BULL.
Mr. Oswald HANson next proposed
the toast of “The Hammersmith
Constitutional Club, coupled with the
name of our Member, Sir WILLIAM
BULL,” to which again Sir WILLIAM
responded.
Then in fitting terms Mr. Scolding
proposed the health of Sir WILLIAM
BULL, to which also Sir WILLIAM suit-
ably responded.
“Always Merry and Bright.”
“Never, it is reported, since operations
started at Tobermory for the recovery of the
Spanish ‘treasure' ship have prospects been so
bright. . . . On Monday the suction pump drew

Henry Caldwell, Esq.,
Paradise Mansions Estate Office,
Hampstead, N.W.
SIR,-Unless you can change the
character of the other tenants at
Paradise Mansions, my wife and I
leave at quarter-day. I cannot under-
stand how you can possibly allow such
persons to occupy your flats. Next
door to us is a person who calls him-
self “Lieut. McKenzie, R.N., Retired ''
—retired compulsorily, I should think,
if he ever was in the Navy | His
snoring is so terrible that we positively
cannot play bridge in comfort when we
have a few friends in of an evening.
But this is not the worst; the other
day I discovered by accident that this
person, his “wife" or his se vant, had
been making clandestine and illicit use
of the front-door pull which you in-
stalled, partly at my expense, for the
personal convenience of my household!
Could impudence go further?
I request instant action on your
part
Yours faithfully,
NAPOLEoN BULLINGDON
(Vice-President, The Society for
the Promotion of International
Amity). -
(Answer: Mr. Caldwell is exceedingly
sorry that such unpleasantness should
have arisen. He is taking up the
matter most energetically with Lieut.
McKenzie, and in order to abate the
noise of the snoring has given im-
mediate orders that another layer of
wall-paper shall be added to the thick-
ness of the party-wall.)
SIR,-When my wife and I were
considering the question of renting one
of your flats at Paradise Mansions we
inquired most particularly from you as
to the character and status of the other
tenants. Only on receiving the most
positive assurances from you on this
score did we consent to take up
residence.
Now, Sir, to-day I received from a
Mr. Bullingdon, one of your tenants, a
most outrageously impertinent letter in
which he alleged that I or my wife had
made illicit use of his front-door pull.
Never in my life has such a term been
applied to my actions ! Note that
word “illicit"—it is designedly insult-
ing in the highest degree. My wife
was positively made ill by it. I refuse
to communicate with this Mr. Bulling-
don, either verbally or by letter, and
I request that you will take instant
steps to ensure a most complete and
ample apology from him for the use
of such a grossly insolent term as
“illicit.”
Further, Sir, are you aware that this
Mr. Bullingdon indulges in midnight
gambling orgies with company of most
dubious character and most outrageous
continental behaviour in connection
with some so-called “society" of his 2
His morals I will not concern myself
with, but I demand that the noise be
immediately abated. At present it is
impossible for my wife or myself to
obtain a proper night's rest.
Yours truly, ANGUs McKENZIE
(Lieut. R.N. Retired).
(Answer: Mr. Caldwell is exceedingly
sorry that such unpleasantness should
have arisen. He is taking up the
matter most emergetically with Mr.
Bullingdom, and in order to abate the
noise of the meetings has given imme-
diate orders that another layer of wall-
paper shall be added to the thickness
of the party-wall.)
DEAR SIR,-If you can't stop McKen-
zie and Bullingdon blackguarding one
another on the stairs all day long I
shall have to call in an Inspector of
Nuisances. I can't hear myself com-
pose. Yours (what's left of me),
G. H. STRAUss.
P.S. Be careful with my initials—
don't mix me up with the other fellows.
(Answer: Mr. Caldwell has the very
deepest sympathy with Mr. G. H.
Strauss, and takes this opportunity of
reminding him that his last quarter's
rent is still unpaid.)
DEAR Sir, We beg the favour of
your kind attention for the novel forms
of insurance described in the accom-
panying booklet enclosed herewith. On
perusing same you will note that we
beg to offer you protection against col-
lapse of party-walls, floors or ceilings,

THEY live 'neath the curtain
Of fir woods and heather,
And never take hurt in
The wildest of weather,
But best they love Autumn—she's
brown as themselves—
And they are the brownest of all the
brown elves;
When loud sings the West Wind,
The bravest and best wind,
And puddles are shining in all the cart
ruts,
They turn up the dead leaves,
The russet and red leaves,
Where squirrels have taught them to
look out for nuts! . .
The hedge-cutters hear them
Where berries are glowing, ‘
The scythe circles near them
At time of the mowing,
But most they love woodlands when
Autumn winds pipe,
And all through the cover the beech-
nuts are ripe, -
And great spikey chestnuts,
The biggest and best nuts,
Blown down in the ditches, fair wind-
falls lie cast,
And no tree begrudges
The little Puk-Wudjies
A pocket of acorns, a handful of mast!
So should you be roaming
Where branches are sighing,
When up in the gloaming
The moon-wrack is flying,
And hear through the darkness, again
and again,
What's neither the wind nor the
spatter of rain—
A ſlutter, a ſlurry,
A scuffle, a scurry,
A tap like the rabbits' that bump on
the ground,
A patter, a bustle
Of small things that rustle,
You'll know the Puk-Wudjies are
somewhere around !

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I LEARN from Miss MAY SINCLAIR's new novel, The
Creators (CoNSTABLE), that she knows of at least four
writers of supreme genius in one small set in London. I
am glad to hear it. I had no idea there were so many in
all England put together. These “creators” discuss their
respective geniuses with a detachment so perfect that it
disarms the suspicion of immodesty; they regard them
as something between a St. Vitus's Dance (for which
you can't be held responsible) and a proprietary demon
them implacable, and so remained single, to the great benefit
of her genius. With men we are to understand that
marriage is not so damaging. To Tanqueray, who for some
obscure reason took to wife the crude little niece of his
lodging-house keeper, it was simply an episode. He just
married, and then, after a little, forgot all about it, except
when she and his genius were in his room at the same
time, and then he showed that he recognised her presence
by being rude to her.
The Creators is without question a great book. At one
point it promises even better things, but it runs on too
discursively by all sorts of delightful turns, and when
it does stop it is not because it has got to the end,
that wants your blood and will have it if you don't keep but just that you must stop somewhere. And I feel a

I gather that the main purpose of Miss SINCLAIR's
book is to show that a woman's genius prefers her to
remain virgin. Jane Holland married a publisher, with
confident that the author loved most of all her characters,
I confess that I loved only one, and that was Laura, who
had a genius—the only kind, thank Heaven, that she
possessed, though she could write nice paragraphs—for
always sacrificing herself for somebody else.

of tackling the complete trilogy, even in annual stages,
may appear as formidable as a Marathon race. But for
my part, having completed a third of the course, I hope,
all being well, to win to Shepherd's Bush in 1912. For
in spite of its huge length (and the terrible sentence on
page 573 about the olive skin), Clayhanger is a remark-
able book. I feel as if I know Edwin and Hilda au fond,
even without Parts II. and III., thanks to the extra-
ordinary detail with which Mr. BENNETT has described
them and their surroundings. And I like his mind and his
sense of humour and pathos which help him to make a
dramatic story out of such unpromising material as every-
day life in Bursley.
The critics are as tired of saying that Mr. E. F. BENsoN
overwrites himself as he must be of hearing it. He would, |
therefore, be saying everybody trouble if he would spend his
time writing the one masterpiece, of which he is clearly
capable, instead of the dozen novels which fifty men might
have written as well. No one, however, who reads his books,
is a young person
who, beginning life inauspiciously as the orphaned daughter
of a Human Eel (“a contortionist,” she is careful to explain
later, “not a freak"), conquers circumstance and her
husband and his mistrustful family by simple happiness of
disposition. The thing has been done before, you will
remember, in another medium. There is indeed much of
the high spirit of Pippa in this Euphrosyne, who will
probably prove as irresistible to most readers of the book
as she is to the other characters in it. Many of these, too,
are excellently drawn; in particular Miss Sapio, a very
lifelike study of a certain stage-type, and her quaint
Bohemian circle; and the whole thing is written with an
easy good-humour that is bound to be popular; though
the author has yet, I fancy, to learn what is essential to a
story and what not. Her theatrical knowledge, however,
is certainly above the average; it was refreshing to find a
novelist's heroine appearing as an untried Turn at the
beginning of a music-hall programme, without being told
that the house was “packed from floor to ceiling.” Still,
Phosie succeeds here as everywhere else; and deserves to,
as quite one of the most charming débutantes of the season.

THE FAKER OF ODES.
[Mr. Roosev ELT is reported to have appealed to all his literary friends
to come to the front and demand fair play for him. “I have engaged,
he says, “two minor poets—one a nature-faker—to defend me.” A
brand of poet closely related to the genus here so picturesquely named
is familiar to us on this side of the Atlantic.]
TREAD gently. 'Tis the poet's pitch;
'Tis here that he contrives to fashion
Those rare effects that make us itch
To know the actual scenes from which
He wrings his wealth of literary passion.
Go softly. It is sacred ground.
From ten to four (excluding luncheon)
Here his infatuate footsteps pound
Steadily round and round and round,
Wearing a hollow in the stones they crunch on.
He does not want to preen his wings
In solitude among the curlews;
He must be near the heart of things,
Where he can “place” the stuff he sings,
He must be near the ballad-mongers' purlºeus.
In this repellent cockney square,
Where you and I no trace of Pan see,
He tracks the goat-god to his lair,
And reconstructs the trancéd air
Proper to oaten pipes—all done by fancy!
Yon arid clump of sooty trees—
To this his rapt and rolling eye adds
A hint of gardens where at ease
Loll the supine Hesperides, -
Or groves the haunt of dreamy Hamadryads.
A sparrow twitters in the mud;
Instinctively he seems to feel a
Sense of the lark's ascending flood
Of spiral music thrill his blood, -
Or else the sad, sad plaint of Philomela.

Her hair is limp, her skirts are sloppy;
At once he gets inside his head
A dream of women, dear and dead,
Their temples wreathed with amaranth and poppy.

Exchanges chaff with Alf or Ikey;
He sees the better in the worse,
And tells, in reminiscent verse,
The shadowed loves of Eros and his Psyche.

VAPOURINGS IN THE VOID.
[IV.ith acknowledgments to Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson.]
By the courtesy of the Editor of Maunder's Weekly we
are enabled to quote the following extract from its weekly
causerie.
“With the main principles of modern financial legisla-
tion of course it is impossible not to be in agreement, for,
though I should not personally like it, if the State were to
say, ‘We demand nineteen shillings out of every pound of
your income,' I should not question the right of the State to
demand it. If there is one thing that I do earnestly desire
it is that as I grow older I should not come to cling, in an
aggrieved spirit, to what I have got, if the State demands
it from me—whether it be my motor-car or my college
window, my thread of gold or my altar fire.
“I cannot help feeling that great harm has been done of
late by the outcry of the wealthy at the increased taxes.
At the same time it is extremely inconvenient if you have
calculated your expenditure on one basis to have to reduce
it suddenly. Personally I feel a little sore at having to sell
one of my isles of sunset, and the prospect of having to
surrender my hill of trouble to be cut up into allotments
fills me with unmitigated sadness. It is certainly a weak
point about the new taxes that they have been claimed
with special emphasis from owners of land, although land-
owners have developed a far more sensitive conscience with
regard to the welfare of their tenants than was the case,
say, in the time of the Wars of the Roses.
“Literary men, too, like myself, who have acquired landed
property out of money professionally earned, naturally resent
being held up to scorn as guilty persons who have com-
mitted a sort of crime against society. In my own case
nothing could be more unjust. In evidence I have only to
mention the catholic appreciation of all schools of literature
that I have displayed in my introspective outpourings during
the last fifteen years. My veneration for HoMER, MILTON,
and SHAKSPEARE does not prevent my admiring the vivid
and vital work of Mr. HARCLD BEGBIE and Mr. FRANcis
GRIBBLE, Mr. TITTERTON and Lord WINTERTON. The
difference between the lowest circle of DANTE's Inferno
and the Abyss which Mr. T. P. O'Connor describes in his
new magazine is only one of degree. I have never said a
hard word of anyone. On the contrary, for a great
many years I have provided the reading public with a
constant supply of absolutely amiable and wholesome men-
tal pabulum, as digestible and as nutritive as blanc-
mange. That with such a record I should now be con-
founded with greedy, selfish and useless persons who
rush along country roads at a dangerous speed or
slaughter innocent pheasants out of the mere lust of
blood, is a sad injustice. I have no wish to kill any-
thing. My wants are simple. Four typewriters and four
amanuenses, so that by working them in shifts of two
hours each I can dictate for eight hours a day; congenial
surroundings; an outlook on smooth-shaven lawns and
immemorial elms—and I am content.
“Unfortunately there are too many people who prefer in-
flammatory talking to sedative writing, and these are the
people who engender discontent. I cannot help thinking
that if, by a system of contributory State insurance, every-
body was able to secure the possession of a typewriter by the
age of twenty-five, and then set him or herself down to the
task of introspective reminiscence, a great deal of the ferment
and unrest of modern life would be dissolved in a flood of
innocuous self-revelation. There have been poets who
were content with only writing ten lines, or say 120 words,
a day; but with the aid of a shorthand-writer or a
typewriter it is quite possible, as I have proved by the

an afternoon, 24,000 words in a week of six days, or
1,248,000 words in a year. Even if the result is never
published, there is something extraordinarily soothing in
the mere sense of achievement which a steady output
produces. Nor must we forget the immense power which
volume and reiteration exert on the average mind. As
DISRAELI remarks in one of his most illuminating phrases,
‘Few ideas are correct ones, and what are correct no one
can ascertain; but with words we govern men.'"
LINES TO MR. CHILVER.
OUR paths in life are not the same;
I know not what thou art;
I have not learned thy Christian name,
Nor where thou hast a part;
Yet would I clamour to the sun,
Ay, carve on every tree,
In poignant phrase, beloved one,
How dear thou art to me.
ſt is not for thy virtue. Nay;
If thou hast aught of such,
I bless thee, but I'm bound to say
It would not move me much ;
Not for the glories of thy brain
(If any) art thou dear;
Nor should I mind if thou wert plain,
Thou thing without a peer.
For oh, thou art a sweet surprise;
The rarest, blithest spark
That ever leapt to mortal eyes
That searched where all was dark.
Vainly to find thee, late and long
We laboured, all and each ;
We scaled the starry heights of song,
And plumbed the deeps of speech;
Thou wouldst not hear us thro' the past;
Vain was the toil we brought;
We gave thee up; and now, at last,
Lo, thou art here unsought;
And mine it is—ah, happy hour!—
Mine, mine, and mine alone,
To give to all the fairest flower
That poesie has known.
And henceforth, while the spheres applaud,
To many a throbbing lute
• Thy happy Name shall ring abroad,
Wherever it may suit;
And all the bards that bay the moon
Will bless thee, Mr. Chilver,
For this thy pure and steadfast boon,
A perfect rhyme to silver. DUM-DUM.
The Status of Editors.
In referring to young DisrAELI's mission to Edinburgh
to persuade LockHART to take the editorship of a new
London daily, The Representative, a reviewer of the Life
of Disraeli writes: “There was only one hitch. To be
the editor of a daily paper was in those days deemed
beneath the dignity of a man of letters.” But that was,
of course, before the CRIPPEN trial.

DEAREST DAPHNE,--I'm staying here

than the five previous ones. The
Prince is quite a nice fellow, and she's

Numbers of people one knows are at
their places here. Every woman who
counts has her palace on the
Grand Canal or the Lido and
her flat in Paris, and I think
it's just a little bit too bad
that I haven't. I've said so
often to Josiah, and he says
he's quite willing to rent a
palace here and an apparte-
ment in Paris—for both of us !
It's of no use my telling him
that's not the idea. He
simply won't see it.
The Pizzicato Palace is

embarking upon a hazardous adventure
is complete unless attended by a mascot
in the shape of some unfortunate
animal—generally a kitten. A speci-
men, for instance, was taken by Mr.
WELLMAN on board the America, but
it did not ensure the success of his
undertaking. Other mascots, whether
carried by the Shamrock or competitors
in GoRDON-BENNETT motor races, have
proved similarly unavailing. Even toy
Teddy bears have failed to propitiate
the goddess Fortune. It is high time
to put the whole matter on a more
scientific basis, not to speak of a
business footing, when so many dollars
are involved.
We contemplate, therefore, request-
ing two of our leading occultists, Sir
OLIVER Lodge, and Mr. W. T. STEAD,
to straighten things out. We look to
these authorities on the subliminal and
supra-normal to discover and put on
the market a thoroughly up-to-date
and reliable mascot. It must be
durable, portable, able to withstand
sudden shocks and emergencies, not
susceptible to weather changes, easily
put into operation, prompt in action,
of a reasonable price, and suitable to
the most varied exploits. It may be
wanted by an intending Derby winner,
a commencing theatre-manager, a can-

attacking the foe, or a client adventur-

PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A COLD WORLD.
HERBERT is a man who knows all
about railway tickets, and packing,
and being in time for trains, and things
like that. But I fancy I have taught
him a lesson at last. He won’t talk
quite so much about tickets in future.
I was just thinking about getting up
when he came into my room. He
looked at me in horror.
“My dear fellow !” he said. “And
you haven't even packed! ...You'll be
late. Here, get up, and I'll pack for
you while you dress.”
“Do,” I said briefly.
“First of all, what clothes are you
going to travel in 2"
There was no help for it.
in bed and directed operations.
“Right,” said Herbert. “Now what
about your return ticket 2 You mustn't
forget that.”
“You remind me of a little story,”
I said. “I’ll tell it you while you pack
—that will be nice for you. Once upon
a time I lost my return ticket, and I had
to pay two pounds for another. And
a month afterwards I met a man—a
man like you who knows all about
tickets—and he said, ‘You could have
got the money back if you had applied
at once.’ So I said, ‘Give me a cigar-
ette now, and I'll transfer all my rights
in the business to you.’ And he gave
me a cigarette; but unfortunately—”
“It was too late 2 ”
“No. Unfortunately it wasn't. He
got the two pounds. The most expen-
sive cigarette I’ve ever smoked.”
“Well, that just shows you,'
Herbert. “Here's your ticket.
it in your waistcoat pocket now.”
“But I haven't got a waistcoat on,
silly.”
“Which one are you going to
put on ?” -
“I don't know yet. This is a
matter which requires thought. Give
me time, give me air.”
“Well, I shall put the ticket here on
the dressing-table, and then you can't
miss it.” He looked at his watch.
“And the trap starts in half an hour.”
“Help!” I cried, and I leapt out of
bed.
Half an hour later I was saying
good-bye to Herbert. -
“I’ve had an awfully jolly time,” I
said, “and I'll come again.”
“You’ve got the ticket all right?”
“Rather!” and I drove away amidst
cheers. Cheers of sorrow.
It was half-an-hour's drive to the
station. For the first five minutes I
thought how sickening it was to be
leaving the country; then I had a
slight shock; and for the next twenty-
five minutes I tried to remember how

Put
much a third single to the nearest part
of London cost. Because I had left my
ticket on the dressing-table after all.
I gave my luggage to a porter and
went off to the station-master.
“I wonder if you can help me,” 1
said. “I’ve left my return ticket on
the dress Well, we needn't worry
about that, I’ve left it at home.”
He didn't seem intensely excited.
“What did you think of doing?” he
asked. -
“I had rather hoped that you would
do something.” -
“You can buy another ticket, and
get the money back afterwards.”
“Yes, yes; but can I? I’ve only
got about one pound six.”
“The fare to London is one pound
five and tenpence ha'penny.”
“Ah; well, that leaves a penny ha'-
penny to be divided between the porter
this end, lunch, tea, the porter the
other end, and the cab. I don't believe
it’s enough. Even if I gave it all to
the porter here, think how reproach-
fully he would look at you ever after-
wards. It would haunt you.”
The station-master was evidently
moved. He thought for a moment,
and then asked if I knew anybody who
would vouch for me. I mentioned
Herbert reluctantly. He had never
even heard of Herbert.
“I’ve got a tie-pin,” I said (station-
masters have a weakness for tie-pins),
“and a watch and a cigarette case. I
shall be happy to lend you any of
those.”
The idea didn't appeal to him.
“The best thing you can do,” he said,
“is to take a ticket to the next station
and talk to them there. This is only a
branch line, and I have no power to
give you a pass.”
So that was what I had to do. I
began to see myself taking a ticket at
every stop and appealing to the station-
master at the next. Well, the money
would last longer that way, but unless
I could overcome quickly the distrust
which I seemed to inspire in station-
masters there would not be much left
for lunch. I gave the porter all I
could afford—a ha'penny, mentioned
apologetically that I was coming back,
and stepped into the train.
At the junction I jumped out quickly
and dived into the sacred office.
“I’ve left my ticket on the dress-
ing—that is to say I forgot—well, any-
how I haven't got it,” I began, and we
plunged into explanations once more.
This station-master was even more
unemotional than the last. He asked
me if I knew anybody who could
vouch for me—I mentioned Herbert
diffidently. He had never even heard
of Herbert. I showed him my gold
watch, my silver cigarette case, and
my emerald and diamond tie-pin—that
was the sort of man I was. -
“The best thing you can do,” he
said, walking with me to the door, “is
to take a ticket to Plymouth, and speak
to the station-master there * -
“This is a most interesting game,”
I said bitterly. “What is ‘home'?
When you speak to the station-master
at London, I suppose? I've a good
mind to say “Snap!’” -
Extremely annoyed I strode out,
and bumped into—you'll never guess
—Herbert 1
“Ah, here you are,” he panted; “I
rode after you—the train was just
going—jumped into it—been looking
all over the station for you.”
“It’s awfully nice of you, Herbert.
Didn't I say good-bye?”
“Your ticket.” He produced it.
“Left it on the dressing-table.” He
took a deep breath. “I told you you
would.” :
“Bless you,” I said, as I got happily
into my train. “You’ve saved my life.
I've had an awful time. I say, do you
know, I’ve met two station-masters
already this morning who've never
even heard of you. You must enquire
into it.” -
At that moment a porter came up.
“Did you give up your ticket, Sir?”
he asked Herbert.
“I hadn't time to get one,” said
Herbert, quite at his ease. “I’ll pay
now,” and he began to feel in his
pockets. . . . The train moved out
of the station.
A look of horror came over Herbert's
face. I knew what it meant. He
hadn't any money on him. “Hi!”
he shouted to me, and then we swung
round a bend out of sight. . . .
Well, well, he'll have to get home
somehow. His watch is only nickel and
his cigarette case leather, but luckily
that sort of thing doesn't weigh
much with station-masters. What they
want is a well-known name as a refer-
ence. Herbert is better off than I
was: he can give them my name. It
will be idle for them to pretend that
they have never heard of me.

“I Don't claim,” he said, “that it’s
indispensable; but I do say that it
fills what is a long-felt and sometimes
an acutely-felt want.”
He drew from his pocket a little
morocco-bound book and handed it
to me.
“You see,” he continued, “that the

tions for each letter of the alphabet,

But the peculiarity is that the alpha-

second, for their presents. Thus, sup-
pose your uncle Aleck gives you a
dinner-gong; you will enter him first
as ‘Aleck, Uncle' under the A's, and
against his name you will put the
word, or words, ‘Dinner-gong.' And
again under G you will have ‘Gong,
dinner,’ and against it the name of the
generous donor. Do you see?”
“Yes,” I said, “I see; but I don’t
follow you when you insist on the im-
portance of the work.”
“Ah!” he said. “Ah! But you will.

“More or less,” I said.
“And you know whom they are all
from ?”
“Great heavens ! no,” I replied.
He smiled his triumphant smile.
“That's the whole point,” he said.
“Because some day, when you are
nicely settled, you will begin to be
visited by those said friends and rela-
tions who have been so generous—some
perhaps with wills to make and money
to leave, eh?”
He looked profoundly cunning.
“Very well then,” he continued.
“You will like each to think that his
or her present is the one you really
cherish. In order to do this you must
have it en évidence, as our lively neigh-
bours say. But, if you have forgotten
which is which, how can you do so,

went on. “I have a friend with

WHO Is "PACIFICUs"?
[So much curiosity has been excited by the
letters signed “Pacificus” in The Times that
Mr. Punch feels compelled to open his columns
to the speculations of correspondents.]
SIR,-The identity of “Pacificus” is
obvious. He is certainly a person of
great authority in the Unionist Party.
Who is the only such person in the
Unionist Party to-day? Who dictates
its policy every Sunday? Who con-
trols The Observer, and through The
Observer, The Daily Mail and the
Conference? Mr. J. L. GARVIN, of
course! Is it not, therefore, evident
that he is “Pacificus "?
Yours truly, ANother Observer.
(Mr. Punch fears that his esteemed
correspondent is mistaken. The letters
of “Pacificus” only fill just over a
column of large type.)
SIR,--It is certain that “Pacificus"
is a famous politician. It is certain
also that he is distinguished amongst
politicians as the possessor of that rare
quality, modesty—else why should he
conceal his identity? I incline to think
that he is either Mr. F. E. SMITH or
Mr. WINstoN CHURCHILL.
Yours truly,
A GUESSER AT TRUTH.
(Mr. Punch wonders that it has not
occurred to his clever correspondent to
suggest that the letters of “Pacificus”
may be the work of both these gentle-
men in collaboration.)
SIR,--To my mind there is one dis-
tinctive feature in the writings of
“Pacificus." The author is anxious
to get the Home Rule question set-
tled in order to pave the way for
Tariff Reform. Now no member of
the Unionist party, whatever his ulti-
mate aims, could contemplate tampering
with the Union. Therefore the writer
is a Tariff Reformer without any of
the traditional party ties. The name
of Mr. J. ELLIs BARRER will spring to
every one's lips. His associations with
the German National Liberal Party
would certainly not prejudice him
against Home Rule.
Yours truly,
ENGLAND For THE IRIsh.
(Unfortunately Mr. ELzEBAchER is
at present engaged in investigating
unemployment in the States on behalf
of the British democracy; therefore
Mr. Punch fears that this solution is
impossible.)
SIR,--The letters of “Pacificus” are
those of a pretentious, pompous and
futile person. I am only acquainted
with one person in whom pretentious-
ness, pomposity and futility are com-
bined. Mr. J. St. Lor STRACHEY is
“Pacificus.” Yours truly, FoRM IV.
(Whilst obliged to his correspondent
for his interesting communication, from
which, however, he dissents in every
particular, Mr. Punch protests in the
public interest against any letters
being sent him on official Treasury
notepaper.)
An anonymous postcard bearing the
Berlin postmark says, “Why does
not Lord Esher keep to the improve-
ment of Windsor Castle drain-pipes
instead of trying to improve the
British constitution by letters to The

sarily for publication but as a guarantee

“The change from France was extraordinary; the great unenclosed
plains gave place to little fields shut in by hedges that seemed too
small to support even a single cow."
(2) From M. HENRI Julliot:
“Once the sea was crossed I recognised by the character of the
country that we were no longer in France. A French landscape seen from
an airship looks something like a chess-board, the land being so sub-
divided owing to the prevailing system of cultivation ‘called the
petite culture. In England, however, one passes over vast estates with
tall hedgerows almost like rows of trees.”

A GERMAN BATH.
PARKER, Wilks and I had been
“doing” Germany on the cheap, and
I don't know which of us enjoyed it
least.
Parker grumbled the most, but
then he always did, and though Wilks
and I tried to look on the humorous
side of things we lost flesh over
it.
We had happened upon a heat wave
and swallowed a tremendous lot
of
dust and flies, thrown in gratis, cheap
though our tariff was. But we couldn't
swallow the foreign titles that cropped
up around us, we had too much
British pride for that; and, as luck
would have it, at the last town of
our tour we were quartered on the
top floor of a hotel where a German
Prince occupied a suite of rooms.
In our opinion, three English tourists
were worth more than thirty Ger-
man Princes, and we dropped our
boots on the floor at night in the
vain hope that he was underneath.
But, alas! his suite was on the first
floor, and we never even caught a
glimpse of him, though once we
heard his high-pitched, arrogant,
penetrating voice, and the oozy
fulsome rejoinders of his valet, both
articulating a language which Parker
contemptuously described as “the
limit.”
It was the last morning of our stay.
Parker and I had come back to
the hotel to pack our bags before
departing for the station. The
weather was hotter and dustier than
ever, and Wilks, always energetic,
had gone to the public bathing
place on the river in search of a
Swlin.
Parker wandered round the hotel to
kill time. Presently he thrust his
face in at the door; it had lost its
familiar lowering look and wore a
bright and alert expression.
“I say,” he ejaculated myste-
riously, almost under his breath,
“I've just found a bath-room in
this blighted hole–bath full of tepid
I had a letter to write, and
water, with a thermometer in it—clean,
warmed towels on the rail—and all that.
What shall I do?”
“Do!” I replied; “get into it, man!
And let me know when you've finished.”
He wasn't long, and came back
looking wonderfully young and clean.
The mail had just arrived and I had
spent a few minutes over my letters
before I also found the bath - room,
following his directions.
It was with-
out exception the best I have ever
been in-and, to my surprise, the bi
porcelain bath was half-full of tepid
water, and a set of clean, newly-
warmed towels hung on the rail.
I

no questions, but I wanted more cold
water and experimented unsuccessfully
with various levers in the wall. As a
last hope I attacked a cart-wheel affair
on the floor, and after a stiff struggle
managed to turn it. A flood of cold
water gushed in along one side of the
bath, and it was all I could do to
wrench the wheel round and stop the
flow. As I did so, light came upon
me in a flash—this was the Prince's
bath, prepared for him a second time
by his obsequious valet ! It was the

made me enjoy that bath as I have
never enjoyed a bath before or since.
The cheap English tourists were one
up on his Serene Highness, after all.
Still I admit, when I had finished
tubbing, I lost no time in getting back
to the fourth floor again. I told Parker
the great news, and we were just dis-
cussing it with rapture when Wilks
came in, looking supremely dejected
for the first time on the tour.
“The bathing place isn't open,”
he snarled. “Had all the fag of
going there for nothing. What dirty
beggars they are ' "
“Not all of them,” I replied. “Don’t
you worry, old chap;" and I described
“It turned on all right,” said
Wilks, “but I couldn't turn it off.”
“What did you do?" we asked
together.
“I left it,” he answered simply.
“What time are we due at the
station ?” said Parker.
“Now!” I replied—and we took
our bags and went.
As we descended the stairs with
studied calmness, we heard electric
bells continuously tingling on the
first floor; a high-pitched arrogant
voice raised in anger; oozy, servile
tones answering imploringly. We
came upon the proprietor leaping
up the stairs and a stream of water
leaping down them; and a couple
of hours afterwards we crossed the
border, with the secret satisfaction
that we had “done” Germany at
last.

DEAR SIR,-We have thought of an
excellent idea of mutual advantage,
which we beg to lay before you. We
want advertisement; you no doubt are
open to increase your income. If you
will arrange that all press notices of
your flights contain words such as
“The intrepid airman alighted un-
scathed, coolly smoking a “Rameses'
cigarette,” or “Before starting the im-
perturbable birdman put to his lips
one of his inseparable companions, the
famous “Rameses' cigarettes,” we are
prepared to pay you a royalty of £5
per insertion in any high-class journal.
Yours faithfully,
THE PHARAoH TobAcco Co.
(Answer: Mr. Swayle leaves all these
details to his press agent. He under-
stands that an offer of £1,000 a year
certain has already been made for the
same privilege.)
DEAR MR. Swayle, It is very diffi-
cult for me to begin this letter. I have
already torn up—oh, acres of writing-
paper. Ever since your daring flight
from Margate to Southend, I have been
thrilled every time I have seen your
photograph or your name in the papers.
Perhaps you will guess now what is in
my heart. You will remember how
you came to see The Girl from Jericho
and the whole house rose to cheer you;
but I wonder if you will remember the
little girl who took the part of Fifi and
sang her heart out to you that night?
Yours always, MYRTLE VANDELEUR.
(Answer: Mr. Swayle leaves all these
details to his press agent. Please fix up
an appointment with him, when the
matter will receive due consideration.)
DEAR SIR,-We have commissioned
one of the foremost dramatists of the
day to write us a bioscope drama which
will centre round the rescue of an im-
prisoned heroine by aeroplane and a sup-
posed flight from the Isle of Man to the
coast of England. We shall be pleased
to cast you for the leading part in this
drama if you will sign the enclosed
contract note. Yours faithfully,
THE NEw DRAMA TRADING Co., LTD.
(Answer: Mr. Swaylereturns the con-
tract note with some suggested altera-
tions. A minimum edition of 5,000
films should be printed and gramophone
records arranged to go with them.)
DEAR MR. SwayLE,-Have you ever
considered the possibilities of the poli-
tical career which lies within your
grasp? For a young man who can
carry votes with him there are under-
secretaryships and even higher posts
waiting, and we are confident that at
the next General Election your national
popularity would prove a most valuable
asset to our party. In my own mind I
can foresee a seat on the Committee of
National Defence being offered to you
later on. Yours very truly,
GERVASE LANGDALE.
(Answer: Dear Lord Gervase,_My
press agent reports favourably on your
suggestion, and I shall be pleased to
discuss the matter with you in person
if you will call on me at 9.15 a.m.
punctually on Thursday week.)
DEAR SWAYLE,-Turn us in a column
of your views on the Bacon-Shakspeare

and I will tell my Editor to try and
keep space for it in The Daily Truth.
Yours, BEN BUDGEN.
(Answer by ea press messenger: Dear
Sir Benjamin, Delighted! I am sup-
posed to be the guest of the evening
to-night at the Royal Society dinner,
but I will throw that over and write

THE POET IN THE HOUSE.
OF all the germs that infest and fill us
And change our being, we can't say how,
The worst is surely the verse-bacillus—
You didn't know that? Well, you know it now.
But since you are still inclined to doubt it
I'll tell you a tale I've heard about it.
Within the memory of men alive
And likely to live on for many years,
Last year, in fact, there dwelt in Shepherd's Bush
One Richard Hugglestone, a stock-broker.
He from the Bush each morn at half-past nine
Forth issuing took the tube, and so was borne,
Replete with breakfast, puffing at his pipe,
Unto his office in Threadneedle Street;
And there he broked—not always there, of course;
But sometimes in the very House itself,
Chaffing the jobbers, he would ease his mind,
And being chaffed and chaffing back again.
He knew the ways of shares; he knew, he knew
Debenture Bonds and all that they imply.
Contangoes he had faced and overcome ;
Matched against backwardations had prevailed—
In fact he was a perfect business-man,
Wrapped up in markets, down on Socialists,
Loathing LLoyd GEORGE, and paying little heed,
Outside his shop, to anything but golf,
A game of bridge, and, every now and then,
His pair of nicely browned ejector guns.
Jorrocks he knew ; he sometimes scanned the Field,
But as to poets and the stuff they write,
He took no sort of stock in them or it.
One cheerful summer morning, at something after eight,
Without the least foreboding he came upon his fate.
It was the hour of breakfast: the table had been spread
With sausages and bacon, with muffins, toast and bread;
With golden finnan-haddocks, whose steam as it arose
In puffs of keen aroma was waſted to his nose;
And several other dishes with which a man may sport
Who likes his breakfast British and cannot bear it short.
He tried them all, did Richard, for he was nobly geared
For feats of breakfast-daring: a haddock disappeared;
With strips of streaky bacon our hero followed on;
A fat split sausage went the way the other things had gone.
And in between he greatly strove to eat a muffin whole,
And filled some chinks with tongue and ham and others
with a roll; - - -
Which having done he took and drained his coffee to the
dregs, - -
And, last, attacked a glowing dish of highly buttered eggs.
Now, as it chanced, the butter with which this dish was
made -
In certain paper-wrappings to the house had been conveyed.
One lot—they did not use it—had nestled in The Times;
The rest in sheets of Walker, his lericon of rhymes.
And so the dish of buttered eggs, though Richard did
not know it, - -
Was full of all the deadly germs that make a man a poet.
Without a thought he finished the dish:
And swift in his blood a tingling started
As of fiery stars that circled and darted
About and about without his wish.
His brain became
Like a ball of flame;
And “Apollo!” he shouted, “I’m out for ſame.”
And so for the City he departed.
(All this was done by the Rhymococcus,
Which works in a way that well may shock us:
It pales your cheeks and furrows your brows and
Lays its eggs by the thousand thousand
All over your bones and sinews and muscles,
And in every one of your blood corpuscles;
And turns you from sober to moonstruck-silly,
And makes you a poet willy-nilly.)
I can't recount the dreadful tale—some things are better
hid— ” - -
Of all the mad poetic things the wretched Richard did.
On every casual broker's clerk a ballad he bestowed;
He scared his partners pink and blue by mouthing them
an ode.
His favourite jobbers fled from him :
told a friend,
“He’s given us all an awful turn and frightened us no end |
By spouting yards and yards of rhymes.” But what was
really worse,
He would insist on making out his contract-notes in verse.
The Stock Exchange Committee met—the thing required
dispatch— -
And packed the poet off that day by car to Colney Hatch.
So of all the germs that infest and fill us,
And change our being, we can't say how,
The worst, I repeat, is the verse-bacillus—
You didn't know that 2 Well, you know it now!

A BITTER ALOE.
PETER put out his tongue at the closing door.
Norman, flinging his book into the coal-box, said, “I
don't want to see the blooming aloe!” -
“Oo!” exclaimed Joan, “you naughty!—you swored!"
“I didn't swear, silly!” said Norman. -
“It's very vulgar !” said Margaret, with a grown-up air.
“It's perſectly all right,” said Norman petulantly. “If
you'd listened to Aunt Florence you'd have heard that
the aloe only blossoms once and then dies, and that it is
now in bloom, and therefore it's a blooming aloe.”
“And it's a blooming nuisance,” remarked Peter.
“You're both vulgar. Joan, we won't have anything to
do with them. I think it is very sweet of Aunt Florence
to take us to the Zoo to see the blossoming aloe; we might
never see such a thing again. Besides, we shall be able
to see the dear old owls and the elephant, Joan, and the
camels and monkeys; we want to go and see the aloe at
the Zoo, at any rate, don't we, Joan darling?”
“Let's go now,” said Joan, her eyes big circles of glitter-
ing excitement. .
“No, dear, not now; next Saturday, Aunt Florence said."
“Idiot!” said Norman. “Can't you see it's a plant?"
“I shall next Saturday,” said Margaret, adding with
some dignity, “I never did consider a blossoming aloe to
be either an animal or a mineral.”
“I spose you don't know what next Saturday is,” said
Peter from the window, with a sneer.
“The day Joan and I go with dear Aunt Florence to the
Zoo, of course,” replied Margaret sweetly.
“If you hadn't been idiot enough to let that squib off in
your hair last year, and catch a cold as well, Margaret,"
said Norman savagely, “it would have been all right. But
now the little dears must be kept out of danger, and taken
to the Zoo for the afternoon and get home too late to do any-
thing. What about our five bobs' worth of fireworks in the
potting-shed, and the bonfire we've been collecting? Aloe"

POPULAR SAYINGS ILLUSTRATED.
“TAKING his Pleasu REs SADLY.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. W. B. MAxwell, whose work is never less than
interesting, has written in The Rest Cure (METHUEN) a
story as clever and powerful as anything he has done yet,
though it possibly will not rival his earlier books in popu-
larity. It is a tale entirely of one man, John Barnard, the
strong, self-made hero of a hundred triumphs, who, at the
climax of his devastating progress through finance and
politics to an assured peerage, is struck down by the
collapse of heart and brain, and condemned to the torture
of a “rest cure,” to which only death can put an end.
Not, you perceive, exactly a cheerful theme; yet there is
more entertainment in it than might be suspected, especially
in the earlier half, which tells of the meteoric rise of
Barnard, his capture of the rubber market, and his marriage
into the delightfully human family of Lord Rathkeale. It
is after the break-down that my personal complaint against
the author begins. The physical circumstances of Bar-
mard's end are given us in altogether too painful detail.
There exists to-day a school of clever writers whose
apparent aim it is to bring the very odour of the chloroform
into their pages; and I am sorry to find that Mr. MAxwell,
whose power as a story-teller is in need of no such
questionable assistance, is here guilty of this lack of good
taste, or, more politely, this lack of pathologic reticence.
That the thing is, of course, supremely well done only
makes my dislike for it the greater. As I say, however,
the beginning of the story is excellent, the Rathkeales
wholly charming, and the part about the genesis of the
rubber-boom gives a touch of historic interest which should
have for many readers a wistful fascination.
You will admit that it was vexing for Jeannie, the heroine
of The Sins of the Children (MILLS AND BooN), who had
married above her, and was enjoying her first dinner-party
with her husband's people, when her low-born father sud-
denly dashed into the room on all-fours, having mistaken
the house for the one next door, where there was a
children's gathering. It was a bit disturbing for me, too,
because I had been so long familiar with the original of
this anecdote (about SoTHERN, wasn't it?) that its re-
appearance as the crisis of Mr. HoRACE W. C. NEWTE's
story rather shook my faith in his creations. This was
the more a pity because he has written about them in a
style which would otherwise carry a good deal of convic-
tion. Jeannie, as I have told you, married into a superior
social plane, and as a consequence somewhat neglected
her nice old father. That is part one. In part two
Jeannie, now a widow, has a growing-up son who treats
her in precisely the same fashion. When some reference
was made to the future behaviour of this son's children, I
began to ask myself where the book was likely to stop.
However it ends, a trifle abruptly, by Jeannie's surrender
to the arms of an old lover, who is the real hero of the
tale—a strong Imperialist, with some pronounced views

unusual piece of work which, but for the incident recorded
above and some apparently very careless proof-reading,

In taking the love-affairs and adventures of Sir Harry
Frankland and Agnes Surriage, and altering them to suit
his requirements, Q. has placed another point to his credit

of his Cornish tales may regret that Lady-Good-For-
Nothing (NELsoN) is but mildly reminiscent of the Duchy.
I doubt, however, if he has ever drawn a finer character
than Ruth Josselin, and I am sure that the irregularities
of life have never been treated with a greater tenderness
and sympathy. In her childhood Ruth—a poor servant-
girl—was a victim to the cruel spirit of New England
Sabbatarianism, and while paying the penalty for a trifling

It is some time since I first read a book by Mr. REGINALD
TURNER, but I well remember thinking that, if he were not
actually among the big men, he was at least working on
the right lines, and I had him marked down as worth
watching. Consequently, when Count Florio and Phyllis K.
(CHAPMAN AND HALL) came along, I anticipated, in spite of
the obvious struggle for a smile in the title, that I should
be able to report progress made. I am sorry to say that I
cannot. Mr. TURNER seems to me to have turned back.
He tells the story of the marriage of an Italian nobleman
of ancient family with an American heiress. There are a
few complications, some Yankee slang, and, very near the
end, two surprises, one mild and the other ingenious though

he loved her—was
admirably generous
and restrained, and
his lack of delicacy
was not really dis-

agreed to marry him.

IN MEMORIAM.
§illiam 3 guttu.
- Bors, 1825. DIED, OCTOBER 31, 1910.
LoNG had we missed you from your wonted place,
Missed from our Table what we held most dear,
The warm hand's lingering clasp, the kindly face,
The voice of genial cheer.
Now Death brings back the touch of filial ties,
The grace that set our younger hearts at ease,
The hours together under summer skies,
Afloat on summer seas.
For so we knew you, host and gentle friend:
And still you kept, by absence unestranged,
Through age and weakness, even to the end,
- The charm that never changed.
But who shall say what closer memory clings
- About the home where grief to-day is guest
Now you are gone who loved all lovely things,
But children's love the best 2 O. S.
THE death of WILLIAM AGNEw leaves a void in an
exceptionally wide circle of friends and of acquaintances
made in divers avenues of life. The loss is most acutely
felt round the “Old Mahogany Tree” where for more than
thirty years the genial presence of WILLIAM AGNEW
beamed from the end of the table facing the editor's
chair. Among his guests at the Round Table during the
greater part of the time were TENNIEL, DU MAURIER,
CHARLEs KEENE and LINLEY SAMBourNE, whose footsteps
towards the silent land WILLIAM AGNEw followed at so
brief an interval. Of the literary staff were FRANK BURNAND,
whose name is imperishably connected with I’unch ;
MILLIKEN, the prolific versifier; gentle GII, A"BECKETT,
his brother ARTHUR, “Toby, M.P.,” and the Professor,
relic of an earlier age, for awhile right-hand man of
SHIRLEY BRooks during his editorship. Of these only one
now fills his accustomed chair. But many other members
of the present staff sat for shorter periods at the Table
with the host whose loss we mourn to-day.
WILLIAM AGNEw had a dual character, each side strongly
marked. He was an exceedingly shrewd man of business,
and, withal, he had the gentleness, in some aspects the
simplicity, of a little child. No patron of the arts in
modern times has exceeded his range. Among his
trouvailles was the wondrous boy, FRED WALKER,
who, like CHATTERTON, died too soon. He was loth
to part with some of the treasures purchased from the
young painter. They hang to-day on the walls of his
darkened house. It was characteristic of his generosity
that seventeen years ago he presented to the National
Gallery one of the best, “The Harbour of Refuge.”
Picture buying and selling was his business, and he did it
superlatively well; but he also loved art for its own sake
with an unstinted devotion. Nothing delighted him more
than to induce others to share the pleasure with which
he looked at a masterpiece. One of the prettiest sights
of the London season in days gone by was to see him
personally conducting his old friend Mr. GLADSTONE through
the rooms of the Royal Academy on the morning of the
Private View Day, the great statesman listening attentively
to the dicta of the master of an art other than politics.
But better than pictures WILLIAM AGNEw loved children.
It was delightful to see him with a brood of grandchildren
at his knee. Their company compensated for, and brought
forgetfulness of, any worries of business or any signs of
failing health that might beset him. His love of little ones
was not confined to the circle of his own family. He went
further afield, taking to his arms waifs and strays homed
in the Children's Hospital at Manchester, and in the
other in Great Ormond Street, London. Of one he was
President, of the other Vice-President; to the funds of
both a liberal contributor.
From early manhood he took a strong interest in politics,
serving for many years as President of the Salford Liberal
Association and of the Manchester Reform Club. When
the rising tide brought Mr. GLADSTONE back to power in
1880, WILLIAM AGNEw came in on the crest of the wave,
winning a seat in South-East Lancashire. In 1885 he was
returned for the Stretford Division of the county. When
in the following year Mr. GLADstoNE mailed the Home Rule
flag to the Liberal masthead, the Member for Stretford,
with hundreds of other Liberal Members, had to decide
the momentous question—should they serve under it?
WILLIAM AGNEw was not the man to desert what he
regarded as a just cause, more especially when it was
advocated by an old leader. He declared for Home Rule,
was beaten at the poll, and never more sat in the House of
Commons. Tardy recognition of political and public service
was rendered when in 1895 he was created a Baronet.
His long life, for the greater part absorbed with
strenuous labour, had in it comparatively little of sorrow.
It was darkened by the death of the sweet and gracious
lady who for more than 40 years was the companion and
light of his home. But he was happy and fortunate in the
legacy of her children. For some years he dwelt in retire-
ment, taking pleasure in his yacht and his pictures, and
an abiding interest in public affairs.
After a few days' illness death came to him gently.
He passed away without pain—a tired body settling itself
to sleep. He was dowered with all that should accompany
old age, as honour, love, obedience, troops of friends.
- H. L.
THE TRUE ARISTOCRATS.
THERE is not, I believe, an illustrated Debrett, and, there-
fore, one does not know what peers look like: one has
no opportunity of passing them all in review and acquiring
a composite concept. This surely is an omission, although
as to whether it is better for the chances of the House of
Lords, or worse, I would not care to hazard an opinion.
But, although Debrett and the camera fail us among the
salt of our own kind, Miss L. C. SMYTHE and the camera
show no such timidity with the salt of another kind; and
the result is that in a little shilling book called The
Pekingese which has wandered my way I am provided
with a portrait gallery of lazy, insolent, capricious,
imperious noblemen and noblewomen, beside which the
sons of a thousand kings would appear anxious and
plebeian. Page after page it is the same : always the
commanding superciliousness of the patrician. Now and
then it rises to a superb and almost terrifying height, as in
Champion Chu-erh of Alderbourne, and Champion Broadoak
Beetle, and Heitzu of Tisbury, and Garnons Luchu, and
Tuan of Blacklands, and Peiching Pu-yi, and Nan-Tye
of Newnham, and Como Muh Sing, and Puck of Alder-
bourne, and Champion Chin Lu, and Cupid of Eppingdale.
These, one instinctively feels, are tyrants one and all.
Their moods are law. No such array of mere men and
women could be possible; for even the handsomest and
loveliest of us have a defect somewhere.

LET others from the feathered brood
Which through the garden seeks its food
Pick out for a commending word
Each one his own peculiar bird;
Hail the plump tit, or fitly sing
The finch's crest and flashing wing;
Exalt the rook's black satin dress-coat,
The thrush's speckled fancy waistcoat;
Or praise the robin, meek but sly,
For breast and tail and friendly eye—

The sparrow owns the larger part,
And, for no virtues, rules in it,
My reckless cheerful favourite!
Friend sparrow, let the world contemn
Your ways and make a mock of them,
And dub you, if it has a mind,
Low, quarrelsome, and unrefined;
And let it, if it will, pursue
With harsh abuse the troops of you
Who through the orchard and the field
Their busy bills in mischief wield;
Who strip the tilth and bare the tree,
And make the gardener's face to be
Expressive of the words he could,
But must not, utter, though he would

Whate'er they do, in weal or woe,
Through every chance of life retain
Their ancient Puritanic strain;
Tried by the weather they control
Each day their angry human soul,
And, by the sparrow teased, may tear
Their careworn locks, but never swear).
Let us admit—alas, 'tis true—
You are not adequately few ;
That half your little life is spent
In furious strife or argument;
Still, though your wickedness must harrow
All feeling souls, I love my sparrow;
Still, though I oft and gravely doubt you,
I really could not do without you.
Your pluck, your wit, your nonchalance,
Your cheerful confidence in chance,
Your darting flight, your bouts of play,
Your chirp, so sociable and gay—
These, and no beauty soft or striking,
Make up your passport to my liking;
And for your faults I'll still defend you,
My little sparrow, and befriend you. .

MUSIC AND MUSCLE.
THE interesting information about
Mr. CoATEs's physical strength com-
municated to the public by the Press
agent of the Beecham Opera Company,
has opened the eyes of many un-
thinking persons who have hitherto
confounded art with effeminacy. As a
matter of fact, the day of the weakling
virtuoso is long past, and singers,
instrumentalists, composers and con-
ductors now vie with each
other in their devotion to
field sports and athletic
pastimes.
Mr. CoATEs's speciality|º
is that of weight-lifting.
In the last Act of Tiefland
he shoulders the heroine
and starts off for the
mountains at the double.
But this is nothing to
what Mr. CoATEs can do
when pressed. On one
occasion, when Mr. MARK
HAMBourg was playing
the pianoforte in his house,
Mr. CoATEs, in a fit of
absent-mindedness, seized
the instrument by the left
hind leg and liſted it seven
feet into the air, The ex-
traordinary part of the
performance, however,
was that Mr. MARK HAM-
Bourg, by a supreme act
of unconscious levitation,
went on playing all the
time until his Herculean
host had lowered the
pianoforte to its pristine
position.
M. PADEREwski is ad-
dicted to punching the ball,
pole jumping, and high
diving. Sir FREDERICK
BRIDGE can throw a fly
further than any other
Mus. Doc. within the four
seas—no small achieve-
ment as any one who has
able implement, or skimming across
the Round Pond in his hydroplane.
Mr. HENRY Wood attributes his success
as a conductor largely to his proficiency
in “flag-wagging,” which dates back
to the time when he was attached as
honorary signaller to the Cossacks of
the Ukraine during their manoeuvres
in the Caucasus. Mr. WooD also excels
in Graeco-Roman wrestling, ski-ing,
and throwing the hammer. On one
memorable occasion, when a refractory
sabres, disarmed him at the first en-
counter, and secured his consent to the
marriage before leaving the field of
honour. Since then he has wrestled
with rogue elephants in the Mofussil,
he has fought single-handed with twenty
terrorists in Nijni Novgorod, he has
swum the rapids at Niagara, he has
ridden snapping turtles in the swamps
of Florida, and been interviewed by
Mr. RAYMOND BLATHWAYT.

tried it will readily admit. In his youth
Sir HUBERT PARRY was a redoubtable
cricket player, and on one occasion hit
the ball so hard that it broke in two,
one portion being caught by cover-point,
while the other went to the boundary.
The umpire, when appealed to, was so
bewildered that he called “no ball,”
and shortly afterwards went into the
wine trade.
Sir CHARLEs STANFord of late years
has taken to tossing the caber and
may sometimes be seen practising in
Kensington Gardens with this formid-
violin player refused to obey his orders,
he seized the rebel by the scruff of the
neck and hurled him clean through the
bass drum, which was standing some
twenty feet off. -
It is perhaps needless to remark that
the strongest of all our musical strong
men is Mr. MAx BAMBERGER. From
earliest childhood he was famed for his
pugilistic prowess, and when Sir
Pompey Macmurdo declined to enter-
tain Mr. BAMBERGER's suit for his
daughter's hand, the intrepid violinist
challenged him to a duel with cavalry
mirably represented on
the spindle side of the
profession. Madame
|MELBA, who spent her
early years in the bush,
acquired a skill in throw-
|ing the boomerang which
has on more than one
occasion stood her in good

some gaucho indulged in
cat-calls in the gallery.

vain to silence or remove
him. At last Madame

allowed to deal with him
herself, and with one
beautifully aimed shot,
which struck the offender
full on the nose, completely
saved the situation. As
the gaucho afterwards ob-
served in the picturesque
dialect of his kind : “It
was the finest slosh on

A MAN like the Reverend Percival
Hayward ought not to be allowed to
exist, not at least without a licence.
Every time he produces one of his
mathematical problems at the dinner-
table the licence ought to be en-
dorsed, and when the licence has been
endorsed three times it ought to be
cancelled, and the Reverend Percival
Hayward cancelled with it. As it is,
in the present lax state of the law, he
is allowed to run about loose, inflicting
grievous mental harm among his fellow-
men. It is only every now and then
that he is baffled by people like George.
“It is very odd,” he began his last
offence, “it is very odd how deceptive
figures are.”
“We will take your word for that,” I
answered. “Get along with the problem
you want us to guess wrong about.”
“Take, for instance,” he continued,
unabashed, “the case of the worm and
the four volumes of the Encyclopædia
placed side by side. There were five
hundred pages in each volume, and the
worm besides in Volume I.”
“A sort of bonus for the purchaser,”
suggested Henry, “instead of the usual
five per cent. discount for cash 2 ”
“The worm started at page 1 of
Volume I., took its time and worked
through to page 500 of Volume IV.
There it stopped. How many pages
in all did the worm pass through 2"
There was a short interval of silent
and dark suspicion, while we engaged
in rapid calculations.
“Four times five hundred is two
thousand,” said Henry, gazing at the
Reverend Percival Hayward with dis-
trust. “You want us to guess two
thousand. Obviously it was two thou-
sand, but we are not going to guess
that. Try twenty.”
The Reverend Percival turned to me,
a little disappointed. “It was not two
thousand,” he said, as one who has a
grievance, “but to say twenty is absurd.”
I took my turn. “Don't let's spoil
the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar,” said I,
recklessly; “I guess two million.”
The searcher for information turned
away in disgust. “It is your turn,
George,” he muttered, “and you, at
any rate, have reached years of dis-
cretion. What do you think about it?”
“You say there were four volumes?”
asked he.
“Yes,” answered the Reverend Per-
cival, brightening a little.
“And five hundred pages in each 2"
“Yes.”
George stared stolidly and solemnly
at him and gave the matter full conside-
ration. “For my part,” he announced
at last, “I don't believe the worm ever
did it.”
“With this book Mr. Forster seems to us to

NoT TO SAY “AD NAUSEAM.”
(Being ea tracts from to-morrow's issue.)
Foreign NEws.
THE invasion of Germany by the
allied forces of Montenegro and Iceland
commenced yesterday, the negotiations
for peace, which, it will be remembered,
were all but brought to a successful
conclusion on lines drawn up by The
Daily Mail, having suddenly broken
down. The Commander-in-Chief of
the allied armies telegraphs to The
Daily Mail:—
“DAILY MAIL, London: We advance
on Berlin to-night. The spirit of the
troops is excellent, and they are much
encouraged by the interest which The
Daily Mail is taking in their cause.”
In Berlin equal enthusiasm prevails.
Asked for a message to The Daily Mail,
the KAISER said:—
“The men are eagerly reading the
Continental Edition of The Daily Mail
for news of the enemy. Germany will
not disappoint The Daily Mail.” .
The Daily Mail will publish a special
mid-day edition, while the war lasts,
containing the daily messages from the
opposing generals, kings, foreign sec-
retaries, chancellors, etc., etc., to The
Daily Mail.
The revolution in China was success-
fully accomplished yesterday morning,
as forecasted in The Daily Mail on
Monday last, and recorded in the later
editions of The Daily Mail of Wednes-
day. The President of the new republic
cables to The Daily Mail:—
“DAILY MAIL, London.—I rejoice
to announce to the world through The
Daily Mail the final triumph of liberty
and justice in my country. The Daily
Mail has always been the friend of
China, and the new China is grateful
to it to-day.” -
A long message from the exiled
emperor to The Daily Mail is unfortu-
nately crowded out, but will appear in
to-morrow's Daily Mail.
The Daily Mail's great feat of an-
nouncing the accession of King GEORGE
to all the rulers of the Great Powers
simultaneously is still talked of in
diplomatic circles. The Daily Mail
cable, it will be remembered, ran thus:
“The Daily Mail has the honour to
inform you on behalf of English people
of accession of his Majesty King
GEORGE W.-DAILY MAIL.”
The Daily Mail's message forestalled
by many weeks the official announce-
ments to the different courts, and was
but one more instance of the prominent
part played by the press (represented
in this case by The Daily Mail) in
modern politics.
THE ColoniEs.
The opening of the first parliament
in the Straits Settlements was per-
formed yesterday amid manifestations
of intense loyalty; expressions of
gratitude to The Daily Mail, which
had insisted on this form of govern-
ment, being heard on every hand. The
ceremony was a simple one, messages
to The Daily Mail from all the Ministers
being read, and the parliament being
then declared open.
The Daily Mail has received official
notification from the Colonial Office of
the resignation of a certain well-known
Governor, and the name of his successor.
The Daily Mail refuses at all times to
circulate rumours lacking definite con-
firmation, and this particular rumour
seems to be altogether without founda-
tion, no messages to The Daily Mail
having come through to The Daily Mail
office from either the Governor or his
alleged successor.
SocIAL AND PERSONAL.
Themarriage between Sir Julius Bupp
and Lady Mary Milberry was solemn-
ised yesterday at St. George's, Hanover
Square, before a large and fashionable
congregation. Asked during the service
for a message to The Daily Mail the
bride said: “I think it is going off
splendidly.” The clergyman who
officiated, the bridegroom, and the best
man also added a few words for publi-
cation in The Daily Mail.
A son was born to the Countess of
Pimlico last night at Cadogan Square.
Up to the time of going to press no
message to The Daily Mail had been
received from either the future earl or
his mother.
ScIENCE.
Communication with Mars has at
last been established, Professor Omoto
getting the first message through
shortly after three o'clock, before a
large company, including the repre-
sentative of The Daily Mail. The
opening message was one of greeting
from The Daily Mail, as representing
this planet, to the inhabitants of Mars,
and ran thus:–
“DAILY MAIL, London, to Mars:
The Daily Mail sends greeting from
Earth to Mars.-DAILY MAIL.”
It is anticipated that this message
from The Daily Mail will be posted on
the banks of all the canals throughout
the planet.
NEws FROM THE PROVINCEs.
The Great Earwig War in East
Sussex, to which The Daily Mail was
the first to give prominence, is arous-
ing such widespread interest that The
Daily Mail has telegraphed to some
five hundred well-known people, asking
for their views on the advisability of
instituting a similar campaign against
other noxious animals. We print some
of their replies to The Daily Mail:—
“Think Daily Mail's suggestion very
good.—SELFRIDGE.”
“The Daily Mail's suggestion is
most valuable.—GAMAGE.”
“I am entirely with The Daily Mail
in this matter.—SANDow.”
Other replies to The Daily Mail from
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the First
Sea Lord, the Lord Chamberlain, the
President of the Royal Academy, the
Prime Minister, the Leader of the
Opposition and several royalties are
unfortunately crowded out.
STOP PRESS NEWS.
An extraordinary case is reported
from Hertfordshire this morning. A
representative of The Daily Mail called
upon a gentleman, who shall remain
nameless (though he has a certain
reputation as a writer), and asked him
for a message to The Daily Mail in
regard to his forthcoming book. He
replied that he would be — that, in fact,
he had no message to give The Daily
Mail; that (as far as our representative
could make out) he did not like The
Daily Mail; that he could get on per-
ſectly well without The Daily Mail;
and that if ever he did want to com-
municate with the world through the
press he would avail himself of the
columns of some other paper than The
Daily Mail. His relatives are extremely
anxious about his condition, and a
mental specialist has been summoned.
- A. A. M.
The Dundee Courier informs us that
“at a recent Suffragette social one of
the fair workers in the cause of woman's
freedom was heard to remark:—“You
see, I cannot speak in public . . . But
I always go out at night when a
meeting is about to be held and chalk
motices on the pavement with my hus-
band.’” It seems a clumsy way. Why
not do it with an ordinary piece of

THE OLD G.P.O.
l ST. MARTINS-LE-GRAND stands deso-
ate.
I love the old place, for I've done
business there for many years. I re-
member once being greatly touched
when an official behind the counter—
whether by accident or not, I cannot
say—said “Thank you!" to me. From
the day, in my early boyhood, when I
asked at the counter for a free supply
of stamp-edging (of which I was a keen
collector at the time) to only last
Thursday, when I cashed a postal
order for 3s.6d., which I had received
from one of our great dailies for a little
effort from my pen, I have only once
failed to obtain there what I asked for,
and that was on the former of the
two occasions I have mentioned.
In my early years I learnt that one
could always rely on obtaining one's
postage stamps quite fresh at St.
Martins-le-Grand, and the flavour of
the gum was superior; and, just as
we always get our provisions from the
Stores, we always get our stamps
and postal orders from the General
Post Office. As my wife has so
truly put it, when talking of this
rule of ours, “the best is good enough
for us.”
It is natural to feel more confidence
in dealing with headquarters than with
branches, and the trust I have placed
in the G.P.O. has rarely been betrayed.
How prompt and accurate they are
there. MSS. posted at the G.P.O.,
I find, come back with astonishing
celerity. True, a letter I posted in '86
to a friend in Brussels was delivered
in November, 1908, to a person of
similar name in Aberdeen; but I do not
complain of that. I made £1 2s. 7d.
by paragraphing the incident for the
press, so I have no grievance.
I shall not feel so happy in the new
building, I know. If my friends do not
hear from me very often in future, I
hope they will understand. And will
editors kindly note that payment by
cheque will henceforth give me less
heartache than by postal order?
THE CALL.
How nobly on that pious aſternoon
I started forth, how splendidly :
arrayed
In silken hat and patent leather shoon,i
And creases sharp on either pantaloon,
And robe befringed with braid,
To call on Mrs. Thompson, 92
Carnarvon Terrace (terraces be
blowed 1);
I happened on a bus of pleasing hue,
And travelling on its top admired the
view
And reached Carnarvon Road.
There first of all a faint forgetfulness
(Born of the dying leaves that fringed
the path)
Took me of Mrs. Thompson's true
address; -
“What was the actual site?” I mur-
mured, “Bless!
I had it in my bath.
“I knew it all the morning; 1 could
SWeal’
I nursed it when I started, unforgot;
Yonder is 92 Carnarvon Square,
A fine commodious house; she might
live there.”
She might, but she did not.
I flushed Carnarvon Avenue, I clomb
Carnarvon Hill, I ventured to ex-
plore
Carnarvon Flats, imperious pleasure
dome,
Where Alf, the sacred porter, stood at
home
Behind his burnished door.
So hour by hour Itrod the mazy round,
And mild policemen watched com-
passionate
As gravel sweep on gravel sweep I
ground,
And servants bade me bootlessly re-
bound
From gate to clanging gate.
On half a score of bells I smote amain,
From half a score of mansions
turned to flee;
Where'er Carnarvon wove its winding
bane
(Except Carnarvon Terrace), racked
with pain
I trumpeted for tea.
This was a month agone, and time
does fly;
Therefore I've penned these verses
of regret,
Hoping that, if they chance to catch
her eye,
They may explain to Mrs. Thompson
wh
I have not called there yet.

MESSRs. Boomer & Boomer have
pleasure in presenting a tabloid version
of their £125 Prize Mystery Novel, by
Mr. “Guy Cliffe-Warwick,” a young
author hitherto unknown to fame. It
will be observed by the extracts from
reviews which they quote that no
author of recent years has received a
heartier welcome from the Press. When
their representative called on Mr.
Cliffe-Warwick at his combined room
near Battersea Park, to inform him of
the result of the competition, the young
novelist expressed himself with the
engaging terseness that seems to be
the peculiar attribute of great men.
“This is a bit of all right,” he said,
“for I was just on my uppers. Please
don't cross the cheque.” We predict
a triumphant career for the latest
comer in successful fiction.

A Mystery Novel by Guy Cliffe-Warwick.
CHAPTER THE FIRST.
The Light in the Studio.
Hermia. Hemstitch passed quickly
out of Hampstead Town Hall, and
without a moment's hesitation directed
her steps towards Frognal Gardens.
Her home did not lie there, but to-
night she was mad—mad! The blood
burned in her veins. She was sick of
the subscription dance, sick of the
young clerks in made-up ties who
asked her if she rinked. She thought
nothing of the youth to whom she had
promised the fourth extra. Pah!
(“The style is brisk and exhilarating.”
—Daily Telegraph.)
Turning into Frognal Gardens, she
stopped. A mischievous gleam came
into her eyes. Was not that the studio
of Dedrick Dauber, the youthful R.A.”
There was a light in it. Ah! Running
swiftly down the gravel path, she
knocked at the door. A rattle of bolts
and chains, and it was opened by
Dedrick himself, a fair-haired giant of
twenty-one, if as much. Squarely built,
he still found time to play three-quarter-
back for the Corinthians—a man in-
deed! (“Full of grip and go.”—The
Gentlewoman.)
“Oh, if you please,” said Hermia,
dropping a coy curtsey, “I’m the new
model.” And without waiting for a
reply she brushed past him and entered
the studio.
For a moment the athlete-artist
stood amazed. Then a happy smile
crept up from under his golden
moustache.
“This is it !” he said. “The face
I have been waiting for for years.
Little star,” and he gazed up into the
blue dome of the heavens, “I thank

like more than his heroine, it is his

CHAPTER THE SEconD.
“Who steals my purse steals trash."
Coming back from the subscription
ball at 2 p.m., Mrs. Cateye-Smith, with
the Misses Cateye-Smith, those plain
and elderly virgins, were passing
through Frognal Gardens when Letitia
Cateye-Smith grasped her mother's
tulle sleeve. “Mother ' " she gasped.
“My dear—how you frightened me!”
“Look!”
Too late, they went to find Dauber.|ting part of the evidence: Why did
He had vanished, and a large To LET
board leaned drunkenly over his garden
railings. But Hermia had been seen,
and late that night two heavily-built
men called at her residence and enclosed
her wrists in bracelets of the kind that
harbour no jewels and rarely find their
way to Attenborough's. (“Abounds in
picturesque touches.”—Standard.)
CHAPTER THE LAST.
The Verdict.
The Old Bailey was crowded to re-
Hermia Hemstitch visit Dedrick Dau-
ber at midnight? We have heard that
she was seen to leave his studio at two
in the morning. What was she doing
there? Gentlemen, I will now dismiss
you to consider your verdict.”
But at that moment a shout rang
through the court. “Hear me. I will
be heard ' " Stalwart policemen,
boxers most of them, fell back like
corn before the sickle, and a strange
figure burst on the vision of judge,
jury and spectators. “Hear me, my
lord ' I am Dedrick Dauber!”
All three looked. There,
coming along the gravel path
of Dedrick Dauber's residence,
was a well-known figure—that
of Hermia Hemstitch, the girl
all the men were mad about.
They held their breath. Hermia,
on reaching the pavement,
picked up her skirts and ran.
She had not seen them. The
three ladies looked at each
other. Oh, what a scandal for
Hampstead! Chuckling with
glee, they hurried home. (“The
frailties of human nature are
laid bare on his canvas with
an unsparing brush.”—Church
Times.)

White as death, unkempt
and with bloodshot eyes, the
young artist was assisted into
the witness-box. “Now,” said
the judge, “what have you to
say, Mr. Dauber?” :
“I will tell you.” He pulled
at his collar. “Tell you.”. He
gazed round the court. His eyes
met Hermia's. “Remember my
reputation,” hers seemed to say.
(“You must read this book,
dear.”—“Madge” in Truth.)
“My lord, I had been work-
ing late, finishing one of my
Academy pictures, when there
came a knock at my studio
door. I opened it. There stood
Miss Hemstitch. (“Thrills you.”
—Southport Visitor.) “Come!'
she cried. “Something has
happened!' I followed her.
On the pavement without lay
the body of a man, bleeding
and insensible. ‘Stanch the
blood,' I said to Miss Hem-
stitch, handing her my hand-
kerchief, ‘and wait here,' and
I ran up the road to fetch a
doctor. Hardly had I turned
the corner when I was seized,
bound, drugged, and placed in
Bigboots. By the corpse lay' -–
a handkerchief. He examined it. It
bore the name of “Dauber.” “Now,”
said P.C. Bigboots, “what would
'Olmes do?” He considered. “Say
nothing.” He put the handkerchief
in his pocket, blew his whistle, and
with the help of two other constables
conveyed the body to the mortuary.
Still saying nothing, P.C. Bigboots
retired to rest. After a day or two
he began to have misgivings about
his silence. London was in a fever
about the murder. Who could have
done it? At length, slowly, almost re-
luctantly, P.C. Bigboots produced the
incriminating handkerchief—and was
promptly dismissed from the Force.

in yellow masses overhead. The air

In the dock, pale but composed, sat
Hermia Hemstitch. (“I love, oh, I
love, how I love the girl!"—JAMEs

was just concluding his summing-up.
“And now, gentlemen,” he said,

to-day, when I managed to escape by

“Who could have been guilty of
this gross outrage on an unoffending
man?” exclaimed the judge.
“That,” said Dauber, with emotion,
“may be shown anon. A successful
man always has enemies.”
“True, true,” said the judge; “I
have some myself.” (Laughter.)

|Better than the diary are the young
“DIzzY.”
“GENTLEMEN, if there be anything
on which I pique myself it is my
consistency.”
Thus young DISRAELI opened his
address to the electors of Taunton,
coming out in Tory colours, having
thrice essayed to win his way to the
House of Commons as a Radical. The
assertion is delightfully Disraelian in
its audacity. Any other man in similar
circumstances would have evaded the
topic. Dizzy seized it by the neck,
dragged it into the very front of the fray,
and of what his adversaries trumpeted
as his chief delinquency made his
especial merit.
In the Life of Disraeli (John
MURRAY), Mr. MonyPENNY rescues from
contemporary record a vivid picture of
the Candidate. “His face was lividly
pale, and from beneath two finely
arched eyebrows blazed a pair of in-
tensely black eyes. His physiognomy
was strictly Jewish. Over a broad
high forehead were ringlets of coal-
black glossy hair, which, combed away
from his right temple, fell in luxuriant
clusters or bunches over his left cheek
and ear, which it entirely concealed
from view. He was very showily attired
in a dark bottle-green frock-coat, a
waistcoat of a most extravagant pat-
tern, the front almost covered with
glittering chains, and in fancy-pattern
pantaloons.”
Such was the wondrous boy who
descended upon London society and
political life in the third decade of the
nineteenth century, and, unaided by
family connection, unendowed with
wealth, handicapped by alien birth,
won his way to the inner circle of one
and the premier place in the ranks of
the other. Dealing with this epoch of
his hero's life, Mr. MosyPENNY has not
much in the way of new or exclusive
information to proffer. With the ex-
ception of quotations from a diary fit-
fully kept, he is chiefly dependent upon
material long ago given to the public.
But by skilful arrangement he pre-
sents a picture of DisrAELI in the
extravagance of his youth, the budding
power of his manhood, that goes far
beyond anything hitherto accessible.

in which, confident of his audience,
he prattled about his conquests with

When, on their publication, I read
these, I wondered whether it were
possible that with his waistcoats, his
chains, his curls and his cane, Dizzy did
really make the favourable impression
upon acquaintances and onlookers he
taught his fond sister to believe. At

POPULAR SAYINGS ll_LUSTRATED.—II.
“Those who DANCE MUST PAY THE TIPER.”
Malta, for example, whither he went,
after bringing garrison society at
Gibraltar to his feet, he writes to his
father, “They [certain officers] have
been long expecting your worship's
offspring and have gained great fame
in repeating his third-rate stories at
second-hand. We [himself and CLAY,
a fellow passenger] are both equally
popular.” He tells an inane story of
how, a racket-ball falling at his feet as
he watched the game, he picked it up,
and, “observing a young rifleman ex-
cessively stiff, humbly requested him
to forward its passing into the court
as I really had never thrown a ball
in my life.” “This incident,” he adds,
“has been the general subject of con-
versation at all the messes to-day.”
What they really said may be
guessed from an extract from Sir
WILLIAM GREGoRY's autobiography
quoted by Mr. MonyPENNY. “He
made himself so hateful to the officers'
mess that while they welcomed CLAY
they ceased to invite that damned
bumptious Jew boy.”
Sister “Sa” and the fond parent
never heard of this particular incident
in the triumphal progress to Con-
stantinople, where the young Sybarite
“courted the air in a carved caique
by shores which are a perpetual scene,
finding no exertion greater than a canter
on a barb.”
This is the puppet Dizzy, a disguise
deliberately assumed in deference to
the observation that “affectation tells
even better than wit.” Beneath the
oiled and curled mask this book enables
us to see at work the real DisrAELI,
conscious of genius, consumed by am-
bition, ever labouring to achieve an
end determined upon whilst still a
stripling. “What do you want?” asked
a powerful friend interested in his
personality, ready to assist him with
some small patronage. “I want to
be Prime Minister,” said the youth.
Prostrated by illness, overwhelmed
with debt, fearing to go out to dinner
lest he might be “nabbed” by sheriff's
officers, he kept this goal ever in view,
and in time—a long time—won it.
Mr. Mony PENNY's narrative does not
bring DisBAELI into the House of Com-
mons. It leaves him standing on the
threshold, just returned for Maidstone.
The prelude to the story presented by
this masterly volume succeeds in invest-
ing with fresh interest the most fasci-
nating figure in the political life of the
nineteenth century.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Finer Grain (METHUEN) is a volume for which I
have been, these many years, hoping against hope—a
volume of new short stories by Mr. HENRY JAMEs. If the
bare announcement of this fact is not of itself enough to
send you flying hot-footed to the booksellers, I will add
that the stories (there are five of them) are every one
entirely worthy of the JAMEs of the best period. Person-
ally, out of the five, I should select, as having given me
most pleasure, The Velvet Glove and A Round of Visits
(hark to the very sound of them Have they not, these
titles, the true Jacobean ring 2) Of course no one will
expect the contents of the book to be “stories” at all, in
the ordinary acceptance of the term, though in at least one
of them something, disconcertingly, does happen; the
adventures they recount are always rather of the mind
than the body. The meaning, indeed, of The Finer Grain
is explained by the author himself, in a phrase that gives
the clue to the whole, as implying “a peculiar accessibility
to surprise, to curiosity, to mystification, or attraction,” in
short, and comprehensively, the precise HENRY JAMEs
attitude towards life. It is exactly this which gives the
book its own delicate and subtle charm; which, moreover,
makes detailed criticism of it a blundering and impossible
thing. I can only record the rare pleasure that it has
given me; and my congratulations to author and public.
. When Fiction conceives a little kingdom of its own, it
is not infrequently carried away by its conceit. Credit is
therefore due to Mr. J. C. SNAITH for having created a
monarchy and yet, in dealing with the royal personages of
his imagination, maintained an excellent sense of propor-
tion and the ridiculous. In “Illyria” there were three
strong wills, which clashed. There was the king, who
was for monarchy in general and the enthronement of his
daughter in particular. There was the daughter, who
agreed with the abstract principle but opposed the concrete
instance. There was the people, who demanded a republic.
But there is more here than the alarums and excursions
of a smaller European state, so familiar in latter-day novels
as almost to be wearisome. The trouble begins when the
Princess, morganatically married to the English commoner
of her choice, rides incognita over English hounds and
resents with imperial completeness the chastisement of
the M.F.H. Of the domestic upheaval among the followers
of that pack and the international complications caused
by “Illyrian" developments, you can have no idea unless
you read Mrs. Fitz (SMITH, ELDER). You will be well
advised in resorting to that authority. It is not denied
that the book has its faults of detail, but, if it is faults
you are after, you must find them for yourself. By the
time you have finished your search you will discover only
that you have forgotten the object of it.
Get On or Get Out,

school, but he felt he wasn't learning enough, so, with wonderful force
of character, he set about earning small sums, which he set aside to

THE SURVIVAL OF THE THICKEST.
[Mr. Rudy ARD Kipling, in a recent speech at Brighton, has been
recalling the early days when politicians were in the habit of going for
one another with a lethal weapon.]
O GoLDEN times long gathered to the grave,
When for your wild game there was no close season,
When, if you differed from another knave,
You never had recourse to rhyme or reason ;
You simply took a large and hefty axe
And felled him in his tracks.
You used no arguments obscure and dull,
Made no attempt to clear his mental vision,
But got your point of view inside his skull
By processes of surgical incision ;
You did not wait to bandy logic, but
Just nicked him on the nut.
Our politicians, these degenerate days,
Have buried deep the bloodier kind of hatchet,
But at a pinch they still contrive to raise
Weapons of moral suasiveness to match it:—
Slander and slush, abuse and gutter-pies,
And posters stiff with lies.
I find the old way better; here at least
You were not asked to eat your allegations;
You had no further trouble with deceased,
No aſter-crop of loud recriminations;
For, where you dropped him, there a corpse lay he,
Making no repartee.
And if, through something faulty in the blow,
By inadvertence he survived your battery,
He brought no claim for damages, oh no
But, keeping proudly silent on the matter, he
Just bode his hour to pay you back in kind—
Probably from behind.
And so the thing went on, from clout to clout,
Till one (or both) of you was dead as mutton;
This cleared the slate, and no one fussed about
An episode the lid of earth had shut on.
(There is a good deal to be said for blood
In place of ink and mud).
To-day our champions play a softer game;
Each on his own they grind their little axes,
But not for carving skulls; yet all the same
Seldom we see that Nature's hand relaxes
That law on which primeval races thrive:–
The thickest heads survive /
O. S.
THE LITERARY MILLENNIUM.
[Notes of a speech recently delivered by the Rev. Sir Nicholson
Roberts at a dinner of the Inkslingers' Club.]
WHEN I look back on the quarter of a century which has
elapsed since I took up my abode in the Mecca of pen-people,
I cannot help marvelling at the gigantic amelioration of the
world of journalism and letters. When I arrived in London
Mr. Harmson was still at Winchester, Sir William de
Quiller had not yet arrived, and journalists with ideas were
as rare as black swans. Now they are as plentiful as black-
berries. Again, the attitude of the publisher towards the
author was patronising and supercilious, not to say suspicious.
Aspiring talent was snubbed or sniffcd at, and masterpieces
went a-begging in Paternoster Row. Now the chief anxiety
of every publisher who can tell chalk from cheese is to secure
an author of power and verve. In fact, it is impossible for
genius to be neglected nowadays. For this salutary revolu-
tion we are first and foremost indebted to the appearance of
the literary agents. It is the fashion in some quarters to
belittle this class as destroying the old personal relations that
existed between authors and publishers. I cannot subscribe
to this view. There may be untrustworthy agents, but I
have never met them. On the contrary, all whom I am
acquainted with show a liberality that is only equalled by
their flair. My friend Mr. Huxter, for example, is a scholar
and a gentleman in the highest sense of the word, and to be
entertained by him at his club, to be taken for a drive in his
motor, or to walk arm-in-arm with him down Fleet Street is
an honour that might well make any man proud.
Again, take the case of the magazines. In the middle
“eighties” the magazine world was in a depressed and
declining condition. The old-established monthlies were
still unemancipated from the thraldom of seriousness, and
were steadily sagging in sale. Editors and proprietors still
stubbornly refused to give their readers what they wanted.
There was hardly any condescension to the public taste, and
an extravagant deference was paid to the demands of a
leisurely and fastidious culture. The cry of the democracy
was unheeded, opportunism was scouted and the camera
tabooed. Thank Heaven, we have changed all that. Now
no self-respecting magazine-proprietor would dare to pub-
lish a periodical without a picture on every page. But, even
so, our magazines hardly keep pace with the requirements
of the masses. I cannot resist the conclusion that before
very long the progress of applied science will enable copies
of magazines to be supplied in the form of gramophone
records and cinematographic films, so that the best thought
and art of the hour will be brought in a dramatic and
audible form within the reach of every household.
I must close these rambling remarks with a reiterated
declaration of my unshaken optimism. When I came up to
London from Drumnadrochit, authors were “sair hadden
doon.” Now I know at least twenty-five novelists who pos-
sess motor cars. Could more conclusive evidence be desired
of the onward and upward trend of this influential class?
But their motoring and golfing is not an end in itself, as in
the case of the idle rich. They resort to these pastimes
simply as a tonic to recharge the exhausted cells of their
teeming and beneficent brains. The output of novels, most of
them superb works of genius, now runs into thousands every
year, and this quantity immensely tends to better the rela-
tions between authors and critics. Criticism is beggared by
this stupendous fertility and is now swallowed up in unstinted
eulogy. Authors not only want but deserve praise—alike by
their ability, their industry and their uniformly high charac-
ter. Mutual admiration has become an agreeable necessity.
Bludyer's occupation is gone, and our best reviewers are those
who least often deviate from an attitude of unconquerable
affability.
“The return of Henry III. and his army from the
Battle of Agincourt " was one of the scenes in the Lord
Mayor's show, says The Manchester Evening Chronicle,
and endeavours to hush up the meeting of Wolfe and
BLüchER at Malplaquet.
From the Mayor's “open letter to every householder in
Weymouth":-
“King George V. will (after 105 years) be glad to hear news from
Weymouth, the result of his relative's visit, Princess Henry of Batten-
burg. Why is she coming to Weymouth You might well ask."
It is a long time to have to wait for news from Weymouth
—even if it is as doubtful a place as the last sentence hints.

seconds, then squinted down his nose
and prepared to sleep.
At this point he became aware that
something was wrong. First it was
but a whisper of uneasiness and he
looked to make sure that he had
eliminated the tickle-tassels of the
quilt. He had eliminated them. With
growing perturbation he felt his legs
to see whether his trousers intervened

No ; he had taken them off all right.
Then he inquired blankly, “What is

that something was wrong, something

THE SECRET HISTORY OF
THE CONFERENCE.
[AUthon's NoTE:—Somebody will have to
make this up, so it may as well be me.]
THE first meeting of the Conference
was held upon June 17th, and June
17th was a Friday. If the eight could
have managed to wait till Saturday,
the superstitious will say, the results
might have been different.
As soon as they had all assembled in
the PRIME MINISTER’s room, seated
themselves, and tried the
pens provided for them, Mr.
Asquith rose.
“Gentlemen,” he began—
“One moment,” said CAw-
DoR ; “I’ve got a crossed
nib.”
He was provided with a
new one, and the Conference
went on.
“Well, gentlemen,” said
Asquith, “you know what
we're here for. It is for the
purpose of coming to some
agreement upon the Con-
stitutional Question. Per-
haps it would simplify
matters if I restated my own
position. I said these words
last November: “We shall
not assume office, neither
shall we hold office—'”

There was a long silence.

will only last as long as the Conference
sits; so, you see, we must simply sit
for a month or two.”
BALFour looked thoughtfully at him
and then returned to his seat. “True,”
he said; and, taking a little book out
of his pocket, he began to read.
The meetings after that went on
regularly. Sometimes they would
bring down novels with them; some-
times they would chat and read the

“Well,” said CREw E, at
the end of July, “you might

“Hear, hear,” said Lloyd
GEORGE, who had done the
coal-scuttle in five and the
ink-pot in nineteen, and held
the record for the course.
“No, no, no,” said BAL-
“That, though expressed with un-
necessary abruptness, is, in fact, our
case,” agreed Asquith. “Perhaps it
would help us to some agreement if
we were now to hear your side of the
matter.”
“The Veto must go,” wrote CAwDoR
on the foolscap in front of him.
BALFour uncoiled his legs from the
back of his chair and spoke languidly.
“The Veto,” he said, “must remain.”
“Ah!” said Asquith. “Then that,
apparently, is where we differ.”
“Quite so,” said AUSTEN.
“The Veto must remain,” wrote CAw-
DoR carefully with his head on one
“Well, we knew that before.”
“Perhaps; but I wasn't quite sure if
you were serious about it. One some-
times says things in speeches which—
well, we all know that.” He got up
and went across to LANSDown E. “Ap-
parently we feel more deeply about
this. Are you coming my way, LANs-

There was a shuffling of chairs as the
statesmen rose to go. Only Asquith
remained seated—a look of perplexity
on his face. Suddenly he spoke.
“Look here,” he said, “we can’t
break up like this. However much we
disagree, we agree on one thing. The

means, but we must meet again in
October.” He had ordered a new loft-

for a month, and felt certain that with
this he could wrest the championship ||

“Just as you like,” said Asquith.
He was bunkered in the fender at the
moment, and spoke rather testily.
The Conference was adjourned.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VAGABOND.
It was deadly cold in Danbury town
One terrible night in mid November,
A night that the Danbury folk remember
For the sleety wind that hammered them down,
That chilled their faces and chapped their skin,
And froze their fingers and bit their feet,
And made them ice to the heart within,
And spattered and scattered
And shattered and battered
Their shivering bodies about the street;
And the fact is most of them didn't roam
In the face of the storm, but stayed at home;
While here and there a policeman, stamping
To keep himself warm or sedately tramping
Hither and thither, paced his beat;
Or peered where out of the blizzard's welter
Some wretched being had crept to shelter,
And now, drenched through by the sleet, a muddled
Blur of a man and his rags, lay huddled.
But one there was who didn't care,
Whatever the furious storm might dare,
A wonderful, hook-nosed bright-eyed fellow
In a thin brown cape and a cap of yellow
That perched on his dripping coal-black hair.
A red scarf set off his throat and bound him,
Crossing his breast, and, winding round him,
Flapped at his flank
In a red streak dank;
And his hose were red, with a purple sheen
From his tunic's blue, and his shoes were green.
He was most outlandishly patched together
With ribbons of silk and tags of leather,
And chains of silver and buttons of stone,
And knobs of amber and polished bone,
And a turquoise brooch and a collar of jade,
And a belt and a pouch of rich brocade,
And a gleaming dagger with inlaid blade
And jewelled handle of burnished gold
Rakishly stuck in the red scarf's fold—
A dress, in short, that might suit a wizard
On a calm warm day
In the month of May,
But was hardly fit for an autumn blizzard.
Whence had he come there? Who could say,
As he swung through Danbury town that day,
With a friendly light in his deep-set eyes,
And his free wild gait and his upright bearing,
And his air that nothing could well surprise,
So bright it was and so bold and daring?
He might have troubled the slothful ease
Of the Great Mogul in a warlike fever;
He might have bled for the Maccabees,
Or risen, spurred
By the Prophet's word,
And swooped on the hosts of the unbeliever.
Whatever his birth and his nomenclature,
Something he seemed to have, some knowledge
That never was taught at school or college,
But was part of his very being's nature:
Some ingrained lore that wanderers show
As over the earth they come and go,
Though they hardly know what it is they know.
And so with his head upheld he walked,
And ever the rain drove down;
And now and again to himself he talked
In the streets of Danbury town.
And now and again he'd stop and troll
A stave of music that seemed to roll
From the inmost depths of his ardent soul;
But the wind took hold of the notes and tossed them
And the few who chanced to be near him lost them.
(To be concluded.)
CORNI CON MOTO.
Who says that the English are an unmusical nation ?
He will be speedily confuted by a wonderful motor horn
now on exhibition, which plays “God Save the King.”
It is further stated that the time may not be far distant
when motorists will be able to amuse themselves by
playing grand opera on their warning apparatus. That
being so, a recognised code of melodies will have to be
adopted for the regulation of wayſaring etiquette. We
may perhaps offer a few suggestions.
At the moment of starting, the well-instructed chauffeur
—now, of course, operatically re-named calfattore or
scaldatore robusto—will announce the fact by Beck-
messer's recitative “Inconvinciam '''
As he gathers speed, the way will be clearel with a
fortissimo rendering—we beg pardon, rondition—of “Batti,
batti" from Don Giovanni, or a prestissimo execution of
MARTINI's “Wadasi via di qua / "
Should a collision unfortunately occur, a few bars of
“Ah, perdona 1" from MozART will effectually mitigate the
situation, before he applies first aid—or disappears round
the corner. -
Motorists who are confidentially inclined and disposed to
inform the public as to their destination may casily rise to
the occasion. “Ai nostri monti ritorneremo,” for instance,
will, of course, show that they are off for a bit of dear-
stalking in the Highlands. Or the same easily recognisable
air might usefully be employed to delude the police-trap
when, after all, Brighton is really the objective.
In case of a break-down, nothing can be more appropriate
than “Non piú andrai" given out maestoso and rallentando.
The quiet dignity and pathos of this well-known aria will
go far to disarm the satire of the gaping crowd of villagers |
by the wayside.
If the motorists are in more serious trouble—say, in
danger of being run away with over a precipice—the tactful |
driver will at once turn on “Ah che la morte,” molto agitato,
or, at any rate, to a different time from that with which he
rendered “Ai nostri monti " a few moments before.
diverted.
On arriving home safely, we have an excerpt ready to
hand in “Salve, dimora !”
We commend these hints to Mr. LANDoN RoNALD, the
newly-appointed Director of the Guildhall School of Music, .
as there is great scope here for a really useful, as well as
artistic, application of leit-motifs and motetts. A properly
trained student should easily be able to earn his three
guineas a week out in the open air.
Dr. RICHTER, also, and Mr. THOMAS BEECHAM, or who- |
ever handles Wagnerian opera in the future, should take
note of this new musical development. For instance, the
Ride of the Valkyries will only be adequately treated when
the aerial chauffeuses utter their war-song on the horns of
practicable Blériots, while the trumpets in the Einführungs-
marsch in Tannhäuser will naturally be replaced by the
now harmonious hooters, manipulated by correctly-
uniformed joy-drivers of the Automobile Club. Zigzag.

MORE STATESMEN AT PLAY.
THE success of the political party
| on the mono-rail has led to a number
of Ministerial excursions, all of them
yielding both pleasure and wit. -
On Thursday, for example, Mr.
AsquitH, Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, Mr.
CHURCHILL, and a number of their
friends visited the Coliseum to see
Mr. SEYMoUR HICKS as Richard III.
By a remarkable coincidence, just as
they were entering the building a
newsboy selling The Evening Mail went
by. The PREMIER stopped to watch
the portent, raising his hat as he did so.
Everyone was delighted with the
galvanic SEYMoUR's Shakspearean per-
formance. “It goes well, doesn't it?”
remarked Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL to
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE. “So unlike your
Budget.”
“Yes,” said the CHANCELLOR sadly;
“but,” he added, with one of his en-
gaging twinkles, “people will soon
have to Seymour of it than ever.”
On the same day Mr. John BURNs,
Mr. RUNCIMAN, Mr. MASTERMAN, and a
number of friends were at one of the
leading cinematoscope theatres. Mr.
BURNs chanced, on entering, to kick
against something on the ground, and
to his astonishment it was a copy of
The Daily Flail. “Even the floor
takes it in,” he remarked in awe-
struck tones, as he removed his historic
bowler. - - -
The company were intensely delighted
by the various pictures flashed on the
screen, but it was something of a shock
when the lights first went out. “Why,”
said Mr. RUNCIMAN, “we’re in the
dark.”
“Yes,” said one of the ladies, “as
the country was for so long about the
Conference.”
Mr. SYDNEY Buxton's party to see
GEORGE GRAY play billiards was a
great success. Sir Edward GREY
(who, it may not be generally known,
is the marvellous boy's first cousin),
Mr. BIRRELL and Mr. SAMUEL were
among the guests. Just outside the
hall the Foreign SECRETARY, chancing
to look up, observed a trolley drawn by
four horses and bearing a huge load
of paper cylinders labelled, “Paper for
The Daily Furor.” “What enterprise!”
he murmured, as he slowly removed his
green Tyrolean headgear.
The accuracy of the youth's losing
hazards provoked continual applause
from the statesmen and their friends.
“He never misses,” said one of the
-ladies to Mr. BIRRELL. “How different
from you when you were at the Educa-
tion Office.”
“Alas, yes!” said Mr. BIRRELL. “He
ought to be called Off-red the Great.”

This sally bringing down the House,

missed the pocket, thus giving his
opponent his first look in for some
days.
On Saturday afternoon a recherché
party, consisting of Mr. “LULU" HAR-
court, Lord CREwe, the Master of
ELIBANK and Lord BEECHAM, attended
the matinée performance of Elektra at
Covent Garden. Lord BEECHAM, who
is a near relative of the famous con-
ductor, sat in a guinea box, while the
other members of the party were ac-
commodated with seats in Form 4 of
the stalls. The Ministers followed the
score with rapt attention, the “slippery
blood” motive making a painful im-
pression on the ColoniaL SECRETARY.
Cheerfulness, however, was restored by
a brilliant sally from the Master of
AEgisthus. “You ought to be enjoying
yourself,” he remarked to Lord MoR-
LEY's successor at the India Office.
“Why?” rashly queried Lord Rose-
BERY's gifted son-in-law. “Because
this is such a thoroughly Crewel work,”
rejoined the Scottish statesman in an
arch whisper, which convulsed the
representative of The Daily Terror, who
was sitting close by.

THE OPPORTUNIST.
CHEER UP!
To the Editor of “Punch.”
SIR,-The art of cheering is sadly
dormant in this country. Not only
have the grand old British “Hip !”
and “Hurrah!” (three Hips to every
Hurrah) fallen into desuetude, but our
people do not know what to cheer. |
Could not our polytechnics and our
elementary schools do something to
give right instruction on the subject?
At the Lord Mayor's show last week
I witnessed a lamentable display of
vocal indifference. The gallant Yeo-
manry, ready to do or die, caused my
heart to swell with emotion, but I
listened in vain for an appreciative
cheer. One of the crowd spoke, but
only to urge the riders to hold on with
both hands.
Similarly, when those brave fellows,
our firemen, came by, the crowd was
strangely silent. Again but one voice
was heard, that of a youth who called
“Go it, old Globe Polish ' " Though
there was a tone of encouragement in
the voice, a rousing cheer would have
been better.
I could not contain myself when
the Boy Scouts swung into view, but
cried, “Bravo, little patriots, bravo!”
I received no support, however. A
labouring man looked round and inti-
mated that if I couldn't speak English
I had better keep my mouth shut.
Yet when Falstaff and his reprobate
followers passed, what a welcome was
given ' A cheer in the wrong place, if
ever there was one ! I was grieved,
nay saddened. -
Aroused from my bitter musings by
the arrival of that wondrous coach,
with the good and loyal citizen within
it, a sudden ambition to be the leader of
the cheer which must now surely come
possessed me, and in bell-like tones I
cried, “Hip ! hip ! hip !” Nobody
rallied to the cry; there was cold
silence, broken only by the labouring
man who asked me what I was doing
playing at motor cars at my time of life.
The British public seems to have
lost the qualities which made us what
we used to be.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DICKENS TESTIMONIAL STAMP.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
DEAR SIR,--I notice in a letter to the
Press a suggestion that the Dickens
stamp should be used for affixing to
our letters as well as to volumes of
his novels. In the opinion of the
writer this would “doubtless mean a
larger sale.” She estimates that the
number of Dickens' Books we each
have in our possession seldom runs to
more than fifteen or sixteen,
on having one on every Christmas
card. I should put them on receipts
and make it legal so that the other
fellow could say he never got the
money if it wasn't there. It only
wants a little enthusiasm to make the
thing go.
Then there are railway tickets and
theatre tickets and picture post-cards.
I feel that if we really put our heart
into the thing we can have the place
so blistered with them that you simply
tomed to living in a world that simply
reeks of the Dickens stamp we shall
be ready, then and not till then, for
the forthcoming issue of the SHAKE-
SPEARE MEDAL, the WALTER Scott
BUTTON, and the CoRELLI HAT-PIN.
Yours, A LovER of GENIUS.
A New Record.
“Purchased out of the profits of the recent
flying week, the Mayoress of Burton-on-Trent
was invested with a gold chain of office, the
design of which includes a mono-
while our letters “would
number that at least per
week.” I have heard that
some people do have an
enormous correspondence,
and, if these statistics are
reliable, one must admit that
the sale would be materially
increased. But, Mr. Editor,
let us not stop there. It is
my belief—and I simply give
it to you for what it is worth
—that, if we were to affix a
Dickens stamp to each
cigarette that we smoke,
“doubtless it would mean a
larger sale.” Don't you think
I'm right? I see that in
the letter I refer to it is
pointed out that if the stamp
is large it could be put on
the back of the envelope. By
all means. But my plan is
quite equal to that emer-
gency. If the stamp is large
it could be used as a cigarette
paper. It might mix up the
flavour a bit, but perhaps the
publishers could be induced
to bring out a special issue
made of rice-paper. You
see, that would mean with
each of us from fifteen to
sixteen a day. It mounts up.
Now, Sir, I appeal to
you. Can't we all work to-
gether to make this thing a
success? Let newspaper
proprietors affix one to
Sportsman (having emptied both barrels at a rabbit). “TheBE, JAcob,
I'm suite I hit That on E!”

Extract from a testimo-
nial:—
“My wife, especially during the
winter, has been a misery to me.”
We do not like these tales out
of school.
The Bristol Times quotes
each number of their papers;
that would mean a lot. Let us have
them on every match-box; let us have
them on every bottle. Let's mark our
clothes with them, printed on silk.
Let's have them on every knife and
fork; yes, and floating in finger-bowls.
Let's stick 'em on the soles of our
boots. ... Why shouldn't we plaster
them all over the mantelpiece, and put
one on every white key of the piano?
I think, myself, the thing would look
jolly well on a boiled egg, and it might
have the date on it. Unfortunately
we have let the Fifth of November
slip by, or we could have had one on
every firework, but we can still insist
can't get away from them. I should
suggest their being taken up by our
hospitals to be used for cuts and bruises
in place of the customary stamp paper,
and that a fund should be raised to
paper the walls of the air-ship garage
at Wormwood Scrubbs with them.
That would be a pretty big thing, and
should increase the sale, as the lady
says in her letter.
But my object in writing to you is
twofold. Of course I want to make
the Dickens stamp a success. But I
also want to prepare the public mind
by these means for what is to follow.
When we have once become accus-
Dr. FREEMAN as saying that
Wrington Church can claim the “finest
square towel" in all England. Our own
towel is oblong or we should have
entered it.
The Star devoutly hoped the other
day that “even at the fifty-ninth
second of the twelfth hour,” the Con-
ference would come to an agreement.
That would still have left them fifty-
nine minutes and one second for any
odd jobs.

Saturday were home teams."

Anything for a change.

A LITTLE ROMANCE.
IT is considerably more than a year
ago since I first met Miss Robinson.
She is not so strikingly beautiful, I
think I may fairly say, as to compel a
life-long adoration at first sight, and
the same remark, my friends insist,
applies with even greater force to my-
self. The room in which we were
introduced was very hot and very
crowded, and the following tensely dra-
matic dialogue took place between us:—
I. “May I get you some coffee?”
She. “Please do.”
I plunged into the vortex, but when
I returned, spilling the grateful fluid
to right and left, I observed that Miss
Robinson was already holding a cup
in her hand. So I fell back and, to
prevent further jettison, satisfied my
own thirst. Here the idyll might have
ended, but as luck would have it three
days afterwards I met Miss Robinson
in the road, and, as the authorities
upon etiquette very properly prescribe,
she bowed, I raised my hat, and we
passed on. Seven times during the
| next three months this incident re-
peated itself, and each time her bow
grew slightly more distant, like the
nods of a china mandaria. Then it
struck us both, I suppºse, that the
thing was getting rather silly, and upon
the next occasion we pretended a pro-
found interest in the autumnal foliage,
and failed to see each other. After
that we became entire strangers.
The weeks went by (as they say in
the books), and about six months later
I found myself suddenly re-introduced
to Miss Robinson in another very hot
and very crowded room. With every
sign of embarrassment and guilty con-
fusion we bowed, and I said hoarsely,
“The weather is simply too terrible, is
it not?” and she replied (like one in a
dream), “Yes, but I am almost getting
used to it now.” Then some one
else claimed her attention, and we
drifted apart once more on the eddying
tide. . . . Eight times since that day
we have passed each other on the
opposite sides of the same road. She
has bowed; I have removed my hat.
But I have a feeling that our friend-
ship cannot last. Sooner or later the
bond must be severed, we must dis-
appear out of each other's life, and
meet without recognition; it must all
be as though it had never happened.
And then probably we shall get
introduced again. So strangely may
the strands of two human destinies be
interwoven and snapt and interwoven
and—so forth.
“My Dear Watson” surpasses himself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“A SINGLE MAN.”
THIS is one of those plays which
make me marvel why everybody cannot
be a successful dramatist like Mr.
HUBERT HENRY DAVIES. It looks so
simple. I suppose there must be some
art concealed about it. Anyhow, I am
sure that it needed a very good com-
pany to play it, and I am also sure
that, with one exception, it had what
it wanted. The disturbing element
was provided by Miss NANCY PRICE,
who was much too sinister a siren,
and brought the savour of Drury Lane
into The Playhouse.
After seeing him last in that silly
play, Tantalising Tommy, whose suc-
cess made me despair of British
audiences, I was delighted
to find Mr. CYRIL MAUDE
in a part that gave scope
for his versatile intelli-
gence. He was even mole
excellent in his serious woo-
ing of the right woman for
his years than in his light-
hearted abandonment to
the lure of youth and
spring-time. Sentiment,
however, was never allowed
to weigh upon us; for we
were always secure in the
knowledge that Robin
Worthington's pleasant pre-
occupation with his own
tastes would save us from
excesses in this direction.
For all the seriousness and
apparent altruism of his at-
titude towards Miss Hesel-
time one felt that thepathetic
narrative of her sombre past
was not of absorbing in-
terest to him; and when
he intervened with the suggestion that
she should take a little more cham-
pagne one was conscious that the
balance of emotions was being tactfully
adjusted. Indeed, throughout the play
there was an admirable sense of propor-
tion, as between sentiment and pure fun.
And the fun was always spontaneous,
from the primitive episode of Bertha's
finger and the jam (so typical, as Lady
Cottrell says, of British humour) to
the charming phrase, “A man can
only be middle-aged once.”
The device of consulting a woman
about your love-affairs in language, so
ambiguous that she is led to imagine
herself to be the object of your atten-
tions must be a little threadbare by
now. But for the rest, the play is very
fresh, even if its originality is only that
of a nice April day.
I wish Miss HILDA TREvelyAN had
been allowed a larger share in the
humour of the play. Humour may not
be becoming in a typist, but her man-
ner, with its slight touch of angularity
and abruptness, lends itself less easily to
serious sentiment, though here, too, she
is always irreproachably sincere.
Miss MARY JERRold, the match-
maker who introduced the siren into her
brother-in-law's house, and then couldn't
get her out under several weeks, was
quite excellent. Miss DULCIE GREAT-
wich played very naturally, but seemed
to be a few years under her proper age;
however, it was her business to be
boisterously young, and I don't com-
plain. As for Miss FLORENCE HAYDON,
playing an old lady who knew what she
knew—her dry humour was of course,
as always, a thing of absolute beauty.

“Just To GET MARRIED.”
Miss CICELY HAMILTON's play is
announced to begin at nine, but does
not. I arrived at nine, and found
myself in the middle of a curtain-
raiser of positively startling dulness.
A gentleman, called Basil of the Iron
Hand, was delivering, in an assumed
voice, a series of speeches of intermin-
able length, from which I gathered
that he was in love with his first
wife's sister, while his second wife
was in love with his nephew. It was
an awkward situation, and the iron-
handed one decided to go off on a
pilgrimage, which was perhaps best.
Just to Get Married is a protest
against that view of life which regards
marriage as the whole end of woman.
It is a sermon which has been preached
by Miss HAMILTON before; it is so
pleasantly preached on this occasion
that I should like to think of it as doing
good; but I am puzzled as to what
audience it is which Miss HAMILTON
is trying to convert. Her heroine,
Georgina Vicary, is twenty-nine, and a
spinster. In a last endeavour to “get
Georgina off,” Aunt Catherine invites
Adam Lankester, a shy bachelor, to the
house. Georgina, aided and abetted
by her aunt, pursues Adam in the most
open way, and finally wins a proposal
from him. She does not care for him,
she is doing it, just to get married.
But on the eve of the wedding her
conscience begins to work; Adam's
adoration is too wonderful, a thing to
be played with. So, confessing that
she has lied about her love, she refuses
to go on with the marriage, and runs
away from the house to escape her
aunt's wrath. The happy ending made
possible by the fact of her
meeting Adam unexpectedly
at the station, and finding
that in the last hour she
had grown to love him, is
intelligible, though it does
not assist the sermon.
Now to whom is that
sermon addressed ? Not to
men, surely. For Adam,
anyhow, was guiltless; Geor-
gina's uncle was extremely
uncomfortable about the
whole thing; and Cousin
Tod, insufferable puppy as
he was, stood up for Geor-
gina when she had broken
off her engagement. On the
other hand, who recognised
callously that marriage was
a trade to be carried through
at the cost of honour?
Georgina. Who brought
her up to this belief, and
was the leading spirit in
putting it into action? Lady
Catherine. Miss HAMILTON is obviously
preaching to women. Well, I am ex-
tremely glad of it. Here, anyhow (I
played
sigh thankfully), is something for which
she does not hold my sex responsible.
Votes for Men -
The dialogue is extraordinarily
natural; this and the excellent acting
gave the play, in the First and Third
Acts, a quite unusual air of reality.
The Second Act was a little too serious
for Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE, and though
Miss GERTRUDE KINGSTON tried hard
she could not carry it through by her-
self. Mr. TEARLE is never quite happy
unless he is smiling; in this Act he
smiled a good deal when he couldn't
have been happy. Two delightful per-
formances by Mr. Thomas SIDNEY and
Mr. EveRARD WANDERLIP (as the
worried uncle and the unlicked cub
respectively) must be mentioned as
being uniformly good. M.

“J. ST. LOE STRACHEY.”
Here we have the beginning of a new
line in abuse: the ironical inversion,
the polite censure, the wolf in sheep's
clothing. Thus, one can imagine the
chairman of a discontented share-
holders' meeting referring to the pro-
moter of the company:-"I will not
animadvert on Mr. Brassbound's high-
mindedness or business-sagacity. I
will say that in bringing him to book
it will probably be necessary to repeat
the proverbial counsel, “Set an honest
man to catch an honest man.’ ” Or
again, when one Member of Parliament
has occasion in the future to reflect
upon the mendacity of another Mem-
ber—as so often has happened in the
crude past—he will say that the inci-
dent reminded him of the old definition
of untruth-tellers as “liars, d liars,
and the souls of honour,” adding that
never was there a soul of honour whiter
than that of his honourable friend.
At present the only speaker unlikely
to avail himself of the new periphrasis
is Mr. LLoyd GEORGE himself. But
even he may come into line. “There
is no Editor of The Spectator like an
old Editor of The Spectator,” one can
perhaps see him saying, with infinite
benevolence, or “An Editor of The
Spectator and his money are soon
parted,” or “Editors of The Spectator
rush in, as you know, gentlemen,
where angels fear to tread.”
Anyway we look confidently to the
reports of speeches in the near future
for a diverting harvest from the seed
sown by our ingenious ST. LOE.
The Seeing Hand.
“The Duke himself, in grand military uni-
form, gave the word for the commencement of
the overture, standing up all the time, beating
time with one hand and watching the orchestra
through an immense glass with the other."—
From “The Life of Benjamin Disraeli,” p. 51.
From a catalogue:—
“This machine has given ample evidences of
its superiority over its rivals, and will satisfy
the demands of even the most facetious.”
We don't know what other facetious
people may expect of it, but we want
to see it run over a Bishop.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN John Redmond (HURST AND BLACKETT) Mr. REDMoND-
HowARD presents an interesting narrative of Irish politics
covering the period during which the present leader of the
Irish Nationalist Party has sojourned in the Parliamentary
field. There is a certain monotony about it, since it is
necessarily a record of continuous wrangling. “An Irish
leader,” Mr. REDMoND-Howard sagely remarks, “has two
battles to fight, one with political parties in the House of
Commons, the other with public opinion outside it.” There
is a third, more fatal in weakening the national crusade.
It is the daily fight with revolting sections of the Party,
led by men who were once loyal colleagues. To-day we
have Mr. WILLIAM O'BRIEN and Mr. TIM HEALY spitting
fire at Mr. REDMoN D and Mr. DILLON, who, to do them
justice, are not lacking in reprisals in kind. 'Twas ever
One thing I noticed about The Glad Heart (METHUEN)
was that the character whose nature gives its title to
Madame ALBANESI's quite delightful tale makes but a
very fleeting and occasional appearance in it. To say this
is really to mention the only fault that can be found with
the book; the range of it is so wide and the canvas so
crowded that we have hardly time for more than a nodding
acquaintance with two-thirds of the interesting persons
whom it presents to us. “The glad heart” was owned
by Peggy Mariller, a novelist, with an artist husband,
many debts, and three entrancing children; and her only
connection with the story is that her brother, Dick Framley,
eventually marries its heroine, Ellen Milner. Naturally,
however, heaps of things happen before that. Ellen,
whose fox-hunting father had left her very badly off, goes as
companion to Lady Norchester, the beautiful village-girl
whose husband and his noble family were uniting to cold-
shoulder her, after what was, to them, a regrettable
misalliance. The picture of this woman, with her fierce

cleverest and most de-
tailed in the book. The
whole atmosphere of the
life at Wynch Castle,
under its unhappy mis-
tress, seemed to me to
be excellently well con-
veyed. Of course, Nor-
chester falls in love with
Ellen ; and at one time,
so impetuous was his
wooing, I thought that,
with his wife out of the
way, he was going to
prove the favoured
suitor. But in novels
this is still the day of
the middle-aged; and,
after all, Dick Framley,
the paternal, romped
latest novel, Harmen
Pols. The hero of this
book (published by ~-------
METHUEN) is a young Dutch peasant who, on the
top of the grief that comes to him, when he finds his
ancestral farm must be sold, gradually realises, through a
number of rather Ibsenesque allusions, that he is not the son
of his supposed father, but of a former friend of his mother's,
Govert Blass. Later on he falls in love with Govert Blass's
ward and so-called niece, only to learn from a servant of
hers that the girl is really his daughter. The curious thing
about these two “horrible revelations” is that neither of
them is true, the latter being a superfluous lie, and the
former suggested by the neurotic conscientiousness of his
mother, who had always been in love with Govert Blass,
and therefore felt that she was living a life of deceit with
Steven Pols. The story is full of acute strokes of charac-
terisation and fine flashes of philosophy (as anyone might
guess from reading the author's name), and the romantic
passages between Harmen and Greta are very pretty
indeed. But when I turn back to the notice on the paper
cover and learn that the result of the hero's emotional
trials is to make him realise that the two supreme things
in life are pity and love, I feel inclined to urge a strong
plea for yet another supreme boon, namely accuracy of
information.

It was necessary to Mar (HUTchinson) that Ned Blake,
a quick-tempered, slow-witted seeker after love, should
be extraordinarily lacking in discernment. The trouble,
however, really is that the reader knows all about Mar,
and cannot help wondering at Ned's stupidity. To watch
him floundering on and not guessing to which sex Mar—
in spite of trousers, etc.—belonged, is like watching the
performance of a simple trick which you know yourself and
therefore cannot imagine how anyone can be deluded by it.
But if you can swallow the accommodating blindness of
poor old Ned, you will find Mrs. THURStoN's story very
enlightening. Here she treats Bohemian Paris frankly,
the highly-strung temperament, and her book is especially
to be recommended to those revolutionary spirits who think
that the obligations of sex can easily be avoided.

course there are butts among us still,
and that 's where Mr. REDMond's fun

Mr. O'Connor also told the repre-

though we have always demanded
Home Rule for Ireland, we have never
excluded Home Rule for Scotland and
Wales, and England as well, and what
we ask for ourselves we are quite ready
to concede to these.” There speaks a
generous heart.
“The sum collected,” said Mr.
O'Connor, referring to the result of his
tour, “is the largest we have ever got,
except during the palmiest days of Mr.
PARNELL.” “Palmiest" seems a good
word in connection with the out-
stretched hand.
With reference to the two English-

they protested against being allowed

just a suggestion of mourning in the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SINGLE-CHAMBER MAN.
“For the future,” said Julian, addressing the rest of
the Octopus Club, “I will ask you to regard me as a
Single-Chamber man.” -
Our party, including the one who had dealt this sudden
blow, numbered eight—four Liberal Conservatives and four
Conservative Liberals—who were in the habit of dining
once a week in unison, drawn together by a common love
of good food and a common detestation of political
extremes. The dining part of the idea (I will not disclose
the restaurant, or you would all come and then they'd
start a band) was thought to be original; but its conver-
sational features were traceable to the late Conference. The
failure of the other Eight had not shattered our belief in
the ultimate triumph of moderate counsels; and when
Herbert (who could cite poetry to his purpose) once referred
to Britain as -
“A lard of settled Government,
A land of just and old renown,
Where Freedom slowly broadens down
From precedent to precedent,” :
we had all agreed in looking forward to, and assisting
the advent of, the time when these admirable words would
once again be found to have some relation to the facts.
And now Julian had given us notice that for the future
we were to regard him as a Single-Chamber man
If a bolt had fallen from the blue, the shock would have
been slighter; for indeed the imagery of the less expensive
journals had tended to familiarise us with this heavenly
phenomenon. A painful silence ensued. Had Julian, we
asked ourselves, mislaid his sanity ? Strange mental dis-
turbances had before now been produced by the imminence
of a General Election. Clearly it was a case for sympa-
thetic treatment; a harsh phrase might permanently
disfigure his reason.
After a considerate pause I stepped into the hiatus.
“My dear Julian,” I began, “we naturally appreciate the
fundamental principles which have moved you to declare
in favour of a Single-Chamber policy. All of us—Liberal
Conservatives and Conservative Liberals alike—desire on
any given point to see the better judgment of the People
prevail. But how do you expect them to arrive at a clear
and cool vision of any problem in the blinding heat of a
General Election, with its bitter partisanship, its variegated
issues, and its gaudy appeals to ignorance and greed 2"
“I don't expect anything of the sort,” said Julian; “and
I abhor General Elections. Especially two in one year.”
“Yet,” I resumed, “you would apparently allow those
who are elected under these conditions to make hay of the
country's best traditions with no one to put a check upon
their orgies! What, pray, would this lead to ?”
“Red ruin and the breaking-up of laws,” said Herbert,
in inverted commas.
“I stigmatise the present constitution of the Second
Chamber as rotten,” remarked Julian.
“But why not reform it?” interposed Archibald. “Why
not arrange for a round half of it to be elected by decently-
qualified voters; others to be nominated, like the Privy
Council, for services to the State, or for proved experience
in business or statecraft (a good proportion of these would
be drawn, by right of personal distinction, from the Peerage);
a few others, perhaps, for the sake of tradition, to be
selected from among the Peers by their own body; one-
third of the whole to retire in rotation, say, every three
years; and the referendum to be employed in cases where
the majority on any vital question falls below a fixed pro-
portion of those present and voting’”
“That,” said Julian, “is approximately my own notion
of an ideal House of Lords.” . - -
“Then would you propose,” said Oliver, “to exterminate
the existing Chamber before or after reform 2'"
“Much,” said Julian, “as I admire the alleged modera-
tion of Sir Edward GREY, I would not share the humour
of his attitude when he advocates a reformed Second
Chamber, and meanwhile goes hand-in-hand with those
who clamour for its practical extermination. I would
insist upon the House of Lords being reformed on some
such lines as those indicated by Archibald; and then no
honest politician would ask for its extermination.”
“But,” said I, “you are an honest politician, yet just
now you declared yourself to be a Single-Chamber man.”
“So I am,” said Julian.
It was then that Henry, who was a mathematician,
intervened. - -
“How,” he asked, “can you reduce Two Chambers to a
Single Chamber without eliminating one of them 2"
“You can't,” said Julian.
“But,” said the lot of us, “if you are going to retain an
amended House of Lords, how can you call yourself a
Single-Chamber man 2" -
“Easily,” said Julian.
::: :: * ::: ::: *
The club-doctor, at our request, has examined Julian's
mind, and pronounced him absolutely sane. Julian, in
turn, has now commissioned him to investigate the mental
condition of us others, and was very anxious about the
result.
A GOOD EXAMPLE.
AN actress of the Comédie Française, who recently
announced in an interview with the representative of a
Paris paper that an English peer had asked her to marry
him—“To be or not to be an English Duchess, that is
the question”—caused it to be known the same evening
that she “was very sorry these statements had been
printed, and that she was exceedingly desirous not to be
talked about.”
The force of example is notorious, and we understand
that a well-known Cabinet Minister. in an interview with
a representative of The Westminster Gazette, remarked with
genuine feeling that he would cut off his right hand if so he
could obliterate the unfortunate impression created by his
premature Manifesto. It was a deplorable document,
vitiated by false sentiment, exaggeration and prolixity.
Worse than all, he had put his admirable chief, the PRIME
MINISTER, in a false position, since he had usurped the
pivilege, which belonged to his Leader, of issuing the first
Manifesto in the campaign. The Cabinet Minister, who
was now shedding tears, exclaimed in a broken voice:
“After all, I am young enough to learn by this painful
lesson. I can only say that 1 am bitterly sorry that my
letter was ever printed, and that I am sincerely anxious
not to be talked about, even by my best friends, but to do
my duty quietly, firmly, and without any illegitimate
appeals to publicity.”
“The debate in the House of Lords lasted from half-past four till
ten minutes to six. In that brief hour and fifty minutes the Peers
presented a spectacle of undisguised panic.”—Daily News.
The briefest hour and fifty minutes that we remember to
have come across.
“DERN socialism. IN Its HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT,” says
an advertisement in The Scotsman ; and most people will
endorse the epithet. - .. - -

WHEN the Unionist Party was starvin'
For lack of a spicier fare,
There uprose a young genius named
GARVIN,
Who gave them a Benjamin's share.
His mien was tremendously solemn,
His style was alert and alive,
And what others could say in one
column
He swelled into five.
Though his past had been partially
tarnished
By views that good Ulstermen shock,
He had swept and attractively gar-
nished
His mind with an up-to-date stock.
It was vain to be harsh or censorious,
For he carried the Party by storm,
With his faith so sublime and so
glorious
In Tariff Reform.
Home-Rule? He religiously shunned it,
As under the ominous name
Of “Calchas,” oracular pundit,
He reaped an anonymous fame.
Or in prose that was gay as a gala
And deep as the roar of the sea,
He bettered the exploits of SALA
Upon the D.T.
He lent to The Outlook its lustre,
The National sat at his feet;
No intimate Tariffite muster
Without him was counted complete.
His sayings were constantly quoted,
His portrait appeared in The Mail,
And his censure, the Suffragettes noted,
Made Asquith turn pale.
By MAxse acclaimed as a wiser
Political thinker than BURKE,
He blended the pomp of a KAISER
With the strength of a Terrible Turk.
He was closeted daily with leaders,
Awarding them praise or rebukes,
And among his most diligent readers
Were all of the Dukes.
At the height of his patriot fervour
He kindly consented to come
To the aid of the ancient Observer,
And made it amazingly hum ,
For his leaders assumed a more strident
And ultra-pontifical tone,
Till it seemed that the Spear and the
Trident
Were GARVIN's alone.
For a season he ruled as Dictator,
Till all of a sudden the rôle
Of National pacificator
Appealed to his sensitive soul.
So, having empow'red a Commission
Of eight to consider the means,
The realm he resolved to partition
In four smithereens.
Alas for the tragical sequel!
Alas for the frailty of man!
The zeal of his friends proved unequal
To working the Federal plan.
They owned he'd the pen of a
PETRARCH,
But they wounded his pride to the
quick
By saying that REDMond the Tetrarch
Was rather too thick.
The Downward Ascent.
The Daily Chronicle's Special
Humorist at Nottingham reports that,
when Mr. BALFour spoke of the deter-
mination of the Unionist party to
fight for a strong navy he “rose to
shrieking bathos." He soared, in fact,
into the deeps.

ment of a fee of oile guilea (English money)].
GENTLEMEN, it is my duty as an
Englishman to explain to you clearly
the nature of the crisis with which we
are at this moment faced. This duty
is the more necessary because, for
reasons of their own, certain so-called
Englishmen are already at their old
game of obscuring the issue, are once
again trailing their red her-
—it is for them to say if they will be
bought with foreign gold.
Two hundred thousand dollars /
Think of it ! For what purpose has
the Dictator made this unprecedented
journey to a foreign land and collected
this stupendous, this unheard-of sum
(£40,000 in our money) from the sworn
enemies of England, such as Sir WIL-
FRID LAURIER 2 For what purpose, I
ask. Ah, we know well that there is
only one purpose which can demand
so colossal, so staggering an amount—
votes of freeborn Englishmen. But we
are aware of one fact. The Dictator is
here with his dollars | Tell it in the
public-houses -
With an amazing effrontery charac-
'teristic of him Mr. REDMond does not
seek to hide the sources of his ill-got-
ten gains. He actually publishes a list
full of outlandish foreign names, like
O'Leary and O'Flanagan. How dif-
ferent from the modesty of our own
English Tariff Reform League, which
publishes no balance sheets, although
we know that the familiar
rings invitingly for their
opponents to tread on. I
for one shall not tread on
them. I shall not be led away
to discuss such academic
questions as Tariff Reform,
the Navy, and the abolition
of the Veto. These ques-
tions, important as they are
in their proper time, sink to
insignificance before the
dominant question of the
day—Are we to be bought and
sold by American dollars 3
The Dictator is here ! He
has arrived on these shores,
the shores of this happy land,
this England, set in a silver
sea, his pockets bulging with
foreign gold, his trunks
crammed with the ill-gotten
dollars with which the ene-
mies of this country (many of
them Canadians) have loaded
him. He has come to buy up
our England, to offer the gold
of the foreigner in exchange
for the liberties which our
forefathers won for us. When
once that fact is understan-
ded of the people, is there
one patriot who will not
writhe in shame, is there one
Englishman, however lowly,
who will not strike his breast
and say, “While I have a

man, of Naselheim would

Luckily there are still some
Englishmen left who are not
afraid to stand up to the
Dictator. Mr. BALFour has
once again put the case in a
nutshull. He has taken in
the situation at a glance and
summed it up in these noble
words (spoken at Notting-
ham): -
“I appeal to every man
whatever be his tradition or
position to say that Great
Britain shall manage the
affairs of Great Britain.”
Our hearts beat quicker as
we read this, and learn that
the Duke of Port LAND leapt
to his feet and waved his
programme. An Irishman
might say that this is pre-
cisely what his country has
been asking for—for the last
twenty years; but that is an
uncivilised retort such as
no gentleman would make.
What Mr. BALFour meant
is plain : Are we to be bought

Dollars! Not honest British pounds;
not gay French francs; neither the
unstable Indian rupee nor the un-
emotional German mark; not doubloons,
nor sestertii, nor pieces of eight. Had
he come to buy us with Russian
roubles even, our shame had not been
so deep. But it is with dollars that
his pockets bulge, with American (and
Canadian) dollars that his portmanteau
is stuffed. Tell it out among the
counties, tell it out among the boroughs
an amount nearly as much as some of
our Dukes can earn in a whole year!

As yet we do not know how the

are not settled ; the exact proportion
to be given to the Cabinet, the blood-
money of the junior members of the
Ministry, the difference between WEDG-
wood BENN's bribe and the price
demanded by Earl BEAUCHAMP for his
share in the conspiracy—these matters
are of minor importance. We do not
even know yet how much will be

these are nothing compared with the
one great question before the country
to-day: Are we to be bought by American
dollars? At other times and other H
elections we have asked you if you
wished to be ruled by Germany—we
shall ask you that question again at
future elections. But for the moment
Germany sinks into the background.
The question to be decided to-day is
this :

Gentlemen, I can trust you, as lovers
of your country (by which I mean
England, other than Wales, and parts
of Scotland), to decide this question in
a true and patriotic spirit. A. A. M.

Terrible as the toadyism of this gathering of delegates of
the National Union of Conservative Associations must
appear to all right-thinking persons (every man in the
audience having his eye on some Household appointment
in the next Unionist Ministry), there is something to be
said for these hangers-on of the aristocracy. After all, let
us concede in their favour that the man they were just
then hanging-on to is not strictly an aristocrat, since he
does not possess “even a courtesy title,” and therefore has
no claim to the highest place of honour in The Daily
Chronicle's “Social and Personal” column.
From a story in The Church Family Newspaper (we
always hide our copy when the ladies come into the room):
“Mrs. Fairfax professed a polite interest in the house that had come
to Lovel with his uncle's death, whilst she nursed one of the King Charles's
spaniels and occasionally addressed that petted animal in a kind of
baby talk, listening to his replies with an obviously wandering attention."
Spaniel. “Why don't you listen? For Heaven's sake

Post - IMPREssionisT PROBLEMs.
(A SKETCH AT THE GRAfton GALLERIES.)
TIME–Saturday afternoon. Visitors discovered, some
making irreverent remarks, but the majority conscien-
tiously endeavouring to understand if not admire works
which they have been assured by the only people who
know represent the Apotheosis of French Art, and,
incidentally, the annihilation of all previous artistic
standards. -
Miss Pamela Sleyd (a young Art Student, who has not
get “found herself,” to Mr. Dryden Prewin, a painter who
has long since found himself, but has not, as yet, been dis-
covered by anyone else—as they inspect MANET's Portrait
of Mlle. Lemonnier). I like the modelling of the nose, but
do you know (with some hope of impressing him by her
anatomical knowledge), I can't help feeling that her right
sleeve has no arm inside it.
Mr. Prewin (languidly). And why should it have?
MANET, whatever may be said against him, was perhaps
the first to introduce the principle of eliminating all detail
that is not absolutely essential. -
Miss P. S. But isn't a right arm an essential detail?
Mr. P. Not if it doesn't happen to appeal to the painter.
In that case he simply ignores it. -
Miss P. S. I feel that must be right. (As they pass on
to MANET’s “Un Bar auw Folies-Bergère.”). Now this I
really do like. Those oranges and the still-life on the
counter are quite marvellously real! It isn't possible to
put more truth into bottles than MANET has into all those,
is it 2 -- * -
Mr. P. (pained). Possibly not. And it is just that
realistic treatment that we Synthesists are in revolt against.
It is too hopelessly out of date nowadays. . We have got
so far beyond MANET now ! - -
Miss P. S. (an assimilative young person). Ah, poor dear!
Perhaps he was just a little—er—early Victorian |
Mr. Ellis Dee (a young City man with advanced views
on Art, to Miss Nebula Mistley). You may like this new
style of painting, or you may not ; but I can tell you this :
it's like the motor-car, it's come to stay. You'll see—
everybody'll be doing it in a year or two
Miss Mistley (dubiously). I wonder. A good many people
don't seem to see anything in it at all. - *
Mr. E. D. No more they did in TURNER or WHISTLER
and all those chaps. And look where they are now !
Miss M. I wish I knew someone who could tell me about
these pictures'
Mr. E. D. (hurt). That's just what I am doing. Why,
there are fellows in Johannesburg—fellows who know, you
know—buying everything they can get hold of. And prices
simply bounding up.
Miss M. (impressed).
something in it !
Miss Sleyd (before “Calypso" by M. Maurice Denis). r
love that. I do really 1 The colour-effect of those warm
pink rocks against the green sea is too charming !
Mr. Prewin (drily). Much. These attempts to represent
Nature under a pleasing aspect are unspeakably offensive
to the eye of all the more advanced Synthesists.
Miss S. (feeling sorry she spoke). Oh, I quite see that.
And of course, as Art, a thing like this is simply nowhere !
Mrs. Molesey (to Mr. Rumbell Wetheram, an eminent Art
Critic, before some of M. Gaugoin's Tahitian studies). Yes,
Mr. Wetheram, I do feel the rhythm and the emotional
significance and all that, but I should like to know why
some of the figures are drawn with such hard black outlines.
Really 2 Then there must be
no attempt to draw what the eye perceives, but—ah—aims
at putting a line round a mental conception of the object.
Mrs. M. I see. And they're Tahitians, too—so interest-
ing ! I must get a book about Tahiti and read it up.
(She stops in some stupefaction before a landscape in
which the foliage is represented by irregular polygons of
Indian red, chrome-green, salmon-pink, and Prussian-blue,
edged with ochre rims). Now really, Mr. Wetheram,
I can't quite see why he should paint all his trees such
odd shapes and colours!
Mr. R. W. That, dear Mrs. Molesey, is purely a matter of
technique, which, let me remind you, is entirely the Artist's
own affair. The Public has no right whatever to dictate
to a painter how he should render the “tree-ness” of
a tree. *
Mrs. M. You mean he must be allowed to paint trees as
he thinks they ought to be?
Mr. R. W. Precisely. And Synthesists have passed from
the complexity of the appearance of things to the geomet-
rical simplicity which design demands.
Mrs. M. I see. Then of course it's all right.
Miss Platt (a matter-of-fact young woman, to Miss Dobbs,
another). “Le Postier.” But why have they given him a
green beard?
Miss Dobbs. Perhaps he'd been dyeing it just before he
was taken. (They pass on to a study of a black bottle and
a chamber candlestick). “Le Bougeoir '' Fancy giving it
a title like that 1
Miss Platt (tolerantly). Oh, well, they had to call it
something.
A Wife (to her husband, with enthusiasm). Oh, George,
how I envy the possessors of these glorious things! Don't
wou ?
$/ George. Well, not particularly. They may have 'em for
all I care. But I tell you what, Laura, if you're so keen
on 'em I don't mind giving you one for your birthday
present. Only mind, you must hang it in your own room.
Laura. It's ever so sweet of you, dear—but I can't let
you be so extravagant. You shall give me that sealskin
and chinchilla coat I told you about, instead.
Mr. Askelon Gathborne (a frank Philistine, to Mr. Prewin,
who has been trying in vain to erade him). No, but I say—
just look at that picture of a donkey there. Why, it's
more like a wooden animal than a live one !
Mr. Prewin. Possibly; but, as the introduction to the
Catalogue very justly observes, “A good rocking-horse
often has more of the true horse about it than an instanta-
neous photograph of a Derby winner.”
Mr. A. G. Has it 2 I should be sorry to back it for a
place, all the same!
Mr. Prewin. My dear fellow, that's entirely beside the
point. But, of course, if you only come here to jeer
Mr. A. G. Not a bit of it, dear old man. This has
opened my eyes, I do assure you. I quite see from the
way all this has caught on that there's only one set of
men whose work is going to count in this country.
Mr. Prewin. I hardly expected you would say so, but
you are perfectly right. If English Art is ever to be
rescued from its present state of utter degradation, it will
be by us Post-Impressionists.
Mr. A. G. I wasn't thinking of you, old fellow. I meant
those chaps who exhibit on the pavement. But perhaps
I'm wrong. Some of 'em do seem to have learnt to draw
a bit !
[Mr. Prewin is about to reply that, to the Synthesist,
Drawing is entirely unimportant in solving the p oblem:

Mr. R. W. Because, my dear lady, Primitive Art makes

Notes and aueries.
Several correspondents have asked if
they may call our attention (and we
freely give them permission) to our
comment on a Daily Mail cutting in
last week's issue. They point out that,
if you count all the sharps and flats
(which we should never dream of doing)
there are twelve notes in an octave,
and they want to know what we have
to say to that. We have to say:
1) That, if there are, there oughtn't
to be, because the whole point of call-
ing it an octave is thus lost.
(2) That for the sake of our readers
in America, where the colour ques-
tion is so strong, we were purposely
ignoring the black notes.
(3) That, even if we weren't, we
always count an octave “from C to C "
(as KIPLING says), and that this gives
you thirteen.
An Electrical Shock.
From an advertisement of Memphis
(U.S.A.) in The Saturday Evening
Post: -
“BRING The World To MEMphis is the
slogan of the City and it exactly expresses the
intense desire of every man, woman and child
in Memphis. . This sentiment is backed up and
given practical effect by the great Business
Men's Club of Memphis, embracing 1,800
progressive citizens. }. occupy their own
$250,000 Club House . . . Every man of
them is a live wire . . .

The italics are ours, but there our
interest ceases. We do not propose to
grasp the glad hand of a live wire.
“But, whatever the sandwich used, the
hostess should endeavour to make it distinctive
of herself.”—Daily Chronicle.
There is, however, a right way and a
wrong way of doing this, and the
thumb-mark way is the wrong one.

really no business of ours at all) The
Western Morning News heads this

pointments as Labour. Adviser to the Home

effect entirely upon the way they are

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Exth ACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, Nov. 15.
—Something sublime about affectation
of indifference assumed by House of
Commons at critical epochs. Reas-
sembled to-day amid intense public
interest, testified to by unwonted
crowd at gates of Palace Yard watch-
ing arrival of Members, arbiters of des-
tinies of the Empire. When SPEAKER
took the Chair every seat on floor was
occupied. Late comers overflowed
into side galleries. The menaced Peers
were in the dock—I mean the Gallery
over the Clock. Behind them serried
rows of Strangers. To their
right a line of Foreign Minis-
ters and other distinguished
personages. Buzz of eager
conversation filled the
Chamber. |
The Conference had broken :
up, admitting failure. There
had been going and coming
between Downing Street and
Sandringham. What did it
portend ? Immediate dis-
solution, or further parley-
ing with Peers over the Veto
Resolutions 2 Members
crowded to Westminster to
hear the promised answer to
portentous question. All the
world listened at the door.
And what do you suppose
was the business the House
straightway took in hand
and proceeded to deal with in
deliberate, prosaic fashion as
if the political crisis everyone
was talking about had its local 1.
habitation in the planet
Saturn ? Why, it was con- (Always
sideration of Gas Companies Lot.)
(Standard Burner) (No. 1)
Bill, a measure which seems to have
escaped ruthless hand of the Lords
and reached the Commons intact.
Anyhow there it lay upon the Table,
with intimation that it had come on
from the other House. What it was
all about only nine Members, including
the CHAIRMAN of WAYS AND MEANs,
had slightest idea. Of these, eight
filled five folios of the Orders of the
Day with notices of motion referring
to it.
Thus it came to pass that, whilst the
thronged House curbed its impatience,
the Gas Companies (Standard Burner)
(No. 1) Bill was understood to be dimly
threading its way to the Statute Book.
This disposed of, surely we should
have eagerly expected statement. Not
a bit of it, as DoN'T KEIR HARDIE
said to himself. May be true that
HARDIE Don't Keir for some of the
impulses and observances common
in certain grades of social and public
life; but he does greatly keir' for an
opportunity of advertising himself.
Here was one fashioned with lavish
hand. He seized it by the hair, as
the French say. Proceeded to cross-
examine SECRETARY of STATE For WAR
with respect to despatch of troops to
protect life and property in disturbed
colliery districts of South Wales. Nine
times he rose to reiterate in slightly
varied form enquiry already answered
with Napoleonic curtness modified by
Haldanean courtesy.
House looked on with ill-disguised
impatience at surprising clemency of
JACK-IN-THE-Box REEs.
a delightful counter-irritant to the Precious-Little-Empire
(Sir J. D. Rees.)
the SPEAKER. The letter and the spirit
of procedure strictly limit number and
range of Supplementary Questions.
And here was KEIR HARDIE having his
fling unrestrained and unrebuked.
Too much for JACK-IN-THE-Box REEs.
Is accustomed to keep watchful eye
over irregularities at Question time.
Now, with that unexpectedness that
suggests the mechanical toy, he leaped
to his feet and submitted point of Order,
designed to put down KEIR HARDIE.
“That is not a point of order,” the
SPEAKER interrupted.
JACK-IN-THE-Box not to be shut up
so suddenly.
“With great respect, Mr. SPEAKER,”
he said, “I venture to think * >
“The views of hon. Members,” in-
terrupted the SPEAKER icily, “do not
concern me.”
Then, there was heard something
resembling the click of a closing box.
Members, looking towards spot where
REEs lately stood, found he had dis-
appeared.
Up again presently. This time cer-
tainly scored. To long list of interro-
gations addressed to urbanely smiling
NAPOLEON B. HALDANE, Don't KEIR
HARDIE, commencing new column of
advertisement, propounded long, argu-
mentative conundrum addressed to
WINSOME WINSTON. Came once more
whirring sound from second bench
below Gangway. JACK - IN - THE - Box
REES out again, fearlessly fronting
the Chair. Distantly alluding to him-
self as “the hon. Member for Mont-
gomery" he asked whether
KEIR HARDIE's views ex-
pressed in short speech put
in form of Question were
| more in order than those that
earlier brought upon himself
rebuke from the Chair?
General cheer approved point
of enquiry. SPEAKER did not
reply.
| At last to business. PRIME
MINISTER significantly ab-
sent. Understood to be in
further conference with His
MAJESTY on momentous
issue at stake. In his ab-
sence CHANCELLOR of Ex-
CHEQUER, in halting accents,
with timid manner unfa-
miliar at Limehouse, ex-
plained that eagerly expected
statement would not be made
to-day, nor even to-morrow.
On Thursday it should be
forthcoming from lips of
J PREMIER. Turned out that
PRINCE ARTHUR engaged in
country on that day. Finally
settled that full. disclosure
shall be made on Friday.

could the drift of his remarks be guessed
at. RoseBERY is another of the few
Peers who can be heard in the Gallery.
He also collapsed. Contemplation of
growing iniquity of the Government,
of increasing danger to the Empire,
affected not only his spirits but his
voice. - -
As for CREWE, barely audible at the
best of times, he was excruciating.
What made it worse for lookers-on
from the Gallery was the aggravation
of his manner. One could guess from
the action of his hands, the gleam of
genius on his countenance,
that he was making an elo-
quent, probably a convincing
speech, of which only here
and there was caught frag-
ment of a sentence.
Climax reached at close of
CREwe's reply to what was
understood to have been
LANSDowne's speech. Rose-
BERY, quitting Cross Bench,
stood at Table facing Minis-
ters. I made verbatim note
of what followed as far as it

Happily one gleam of light shone
through the mirk. On Orders of Day
appeared Resolution in name of Lord

Business done. — Generally under-
stood that Veto Bill was read first time.
House of Commons, Friday.—Domi-
nance of the unexpected kept up to
last. Prevailed even in detail of Ques-
tions. Through the session Ministers
enjoy on Fridays immunity from
interrogation. To-day, the House
thronged to fullest capacity with
audience eager to know what the
PREMIER had to announce on political
crisis, an interval of a full hour was occu-
pied with questions put and answered
amid murmur of conversation along
. . . the benches.
Another surprise was the excessive
tameness of the proceedings. Here
was climax of situation whose growth
had occupied men's minds for a full fort-
night. Reasonable to look for scene
of seething excitement, passion finding
outlet in bursts of cheers and counter-
cheering. That the impulse was there
was testified to by the ringing cheer
from Opposition that greeted entrance
of PRINCE ARTHUR, a demonstration
lustily responded to from Ministerial
side when, five minutes
7 later, the PREMIER entered
; from behind the SPEAKER's
chair.
Evidently there was plenty
of gunpowder strewn about
the floor. A match care-
lessly or designedly dropped
would lead to explosion
shaking the roof.
At the outset the artful
| PREMIER sprinkled cold water
over the gunpowder. He
was solely concerned in
getting business through.
Fireworks we might, if we
pleased, have in another place
on another occasion. Strik-
ing a conversational note,
avoiding incitement to party
feeling, in the space of
twenty minutes—one-third of
the time wasted on Ques-
tions—he announced that
dissolution will be decreed on
Monday the 28th. In the
meantime business of ses-
sion will be quietly wound up.
“A master of precise
statement,” PRINCE ARTHUR
hailed the PREMIER, and
taking time and tune from
him delivered equally brief
speech, also free from appeal
to party passion.
It was not magnificent
but it avoided futile fury and
consequent waste of time.
Business done. — Dissolution an-
nounced.
“So the Asquithian coup de main fails in the
nerveless arm of the Prime Minister, and the
bottom falls out of the overflowing cup."
Pall Mall Gazette.
Horrible thought ! Can the writer
have translated “coup" by “cup"?
“Two hundred inmates of the Belfast County
Gaol enjoyed a variety entertainment on Satur-
day, and listened to organ solos played by the
prison governor.”—Manchester Evening News.
It is a nice distinction, and we appre-
ciate the tact with which it is made.

As good as sudden death to rats.”

put hot water in their bottles; for
nothing is more depressing than a cold
water-bottle. Let their fires out, or
don't have them laid at all. Leave
the windows open. Shut the dog or
cat up in the room. -
That is one way. Another way is
to have dinners later and later, so that
there is no time for cards for any one.
Don't sit down till ten and then serve
slowly, so that the table is not finally left
till midnight. This will break up the
evening very pleasantly, and no one is
likely to want to sit up much later.
Another way is to find you are out
of cards. “Of course you'd like Bridge,
wouldn't you ?” you can say quite
naturally (practise this before a phono-
grapl.), “but unfortunately I can't put
my hand on our packs. We have such
lots, but I'm afraid one of our new maids
has been lighting the fire with them—
she's Irish, you know!” or “The boys
had a paper-chase yesterday and the
little rascals used all our squeezers—
how droll of them!” or “My husband's
aunt, you know, she's very strict—
quite an Anabaptist I call her!—she
hates cards, so that I'm afraid she
destroyed them. She left only this
morning.” Say something like this,
gaily and humorously, and then sug-
gest your alternative attraction, what-
ever it is—Spillikins, or Squails, or
Consequences, or Charades.
But if all these devices fail and you
are driven back on the conclusion that
most of your friends actually do come
to stay with you for the sake of Bridge,
why then you must sacrifice those who
don't. Nothing is so uncomfortable as
to have friends who hate gambling.
Don't ask them any more. Perhaps
this is simplest.

6 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VAGABOND.
(Concluded.)
So, moving on where his fancy listed,
He came to a street that turned and twisted;
And there by a shop-front dimly lighted
He suddenly stopped as though affrighted,
Stopped and stared with his deep gaze centred
On something seen, like a dream's illusion, -
Through the streaming glass, mid the queer confusion
Of objects littered on shelf and floor,
And about the counter and by the door—
And then with his lips set tight he entered.
There were rusty daggers and battered breastplates,
And jugs of pewter and carved oak cases,
And china monsters with hideous faces,
And cracked old plates that had once been best plates;
And needle-covers and such old-wivery;
Wonderful chess-men made from ivory;
Cut-glass bottles for wines and brandies,
Sticks once flourished by bucks and dandies;
Deep old glasses they drank enough in,
And golden boxes they took their snuff in:
Rings that flashed on a gallant's knuckles,
Seals and lockets and shining buckles;
Watches sadly in need of menders,
Blackened firedogs and dinted fenders;
Prints and pictures and quaint knick-knackery,
Rare old silver and mere gimcrackery—
Such was the shop, and in its middle
Stood an old man holding a dusty fiddle.
The Vagabond bowed and the old man bowed,
And then the Vagabond spoke aloud.
“Sir,” he said, “we are two of a trade,
Each for the other planned and made,
And so we shall come to a fair agreement,
Since I am for you and you're for me meant.
And I, having travelled hither from far, gain
You yourself as my life's best bargain.
But I am one
Who chaffers for fun,
Who when he perceives such stores of beauty
Outspread conceives it to be his duty
To buy of his visit a slight memento:
Some curious gem of the quattrocento,
Or something equally rare and priceless,
Though its outward fashions perhaps entice less:
A Sultan's slipper, a Bishop's mitre,
Or the helmet owned by a Roundhead fighter,
Or an old buff coat by the years worn thin,
Or—what do you say to the violin 2 -
I'll wager you've many, so you can't miss one,
And I–well, I have a mind for this one,
This which was made, as you must know,
Three hundred years and a year ago
By one who dwelt in Cremona city
For me—but I lost it, more 's the pity,
Sixty years back in a wild disorder
That flamed to a fight on the Afghan border;
And, whatever it costs, I am bound to win it,
For I left the half of my full soul in it.”
And now as he spoke his eyes began
To shiver the heart of the grey old man;
And the old man stuttered,
And “Sir,” he muttered,
“The words you speak are the merest riddle,
But—five pounds down, and you own the fiddle!
And I'll choose for your hand, while the pounds you
dole out,
A bow with which you may pick that soul out.”
So said so done, and our friend again
Was out in the raging wind and rain.
Swift through the twisting street he passed
And came to the Market Square at last,
And climbed and stood
On a block of wood
Where a pent-house, leant to a wall, gave shelter
From the brunt of the blizzard's helter-skelter,
And, waving his bow, he cried, “Ahoy! --
Now steady your hearts for an hour of joy!”
And so to his cheek and jutting chin
Straight he fitted the violin,
And, rounding his arm in a movement gay,
Touched the strings and began to play.
There hasn't been heard since the world spun round
Such a marvellous blend of thrilling sound.
It streamed, it flamed, it rippled and blazed,
And now it reproached and now it praised,
And the liquid notes of it wove a scheme
That was one-half life and one-half a dream.
And again it scaled in a rush of fire
The glittering peaks of high desire;
Now, foiled and shattered, it rose again
And plucked at the souls and hearts of men;
And still as it rose the sleet came down
In the Market Square of Danbury town.
And now from hundreds of opened doors,
With quiet paces
And happy faces,
In ones and twos and threes and fours,
A crowd pressed out to the Market Square
And stood in the storm and listened there.
And, oh, with what a solemn tender strain
The long-drawn music eased their hearts of pain; ,
And gave them visions of divine content;
Green fields and happy valleys far away,
And rippling streams and sunshine and the scent
Of bursting buds and flowers that come in May.
And one spoke in a rapt and gentle voice,
And bade his friends rejoice,
“For now,” he said, “I see, I see once more .
My little lass upon a pleasant shore -** , ,
Standing, as long ago she used to stand,
And beckoning to me with her dimpled hand.
As in the vanished years,
So I behold her and forget my tears.”
And each one had his private joy, his own,
All the old happy things he once had known,
Renewed and from the prisoning past set free,
And mixed with hope and happy things to be.
So for a magic hour the music gushed,
Then faded to a close, and all was hushed,
And the tranced people woke and looked about,
And fell to wondering what had brought them out
On such a night of wind and piercing sleet,
Exposed with hatless heads and thin-shod feet.
Something, they knew, had chased their heavy sadness;
And for the years to come they still may keep,
As from a morning sleep,
Some broken gleam of half-remembered gladness.
But the wild fiddler on his feet of flame
Vanished and went the secret way he came.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I suppose that what Miss S. MACNAUGHTAN doesn't
know about Scotch country life isn't worth knowing, or at
least making a book about. Her latest story, The Andersons
(MURRAY), is just as good as those that have gone before;
and there are many people who will recognize this for
very high praise indeed. Though I have just finished
reading it with a great deal of pleasure, I doubt if I could
tell you accurately what The Andersons is about, except
that it is about the Andersons—and they are a family to
whom nothing very out-of-the-way happens, from one end
of the book to the other. In fact, when, about halfway
through, they moved from Clydebank to Kensington, and
appeared anxious to involve themselves in the complications
of an ordinary novel, I was quite sorry. Because, frankly,
I do not think “plot" is Miss MACNAUGHTAN's strong
point, and, indeed, the episode of Maggie and the cheque
struck me as so artificial as to be silly, and certainly quite
out of place. I like the Andersons ever so much better
when they are content to remain just ordinary and human
types, and to reveal themselves as such, through the art of
Miss MACNAUGHTAN, and with that exceedingly dry humour
of which she alone of women appears to know the secret.
Old Mathew Anderson, the shipbuilder; Beatrice, with her
that matter of the cheque-heroics); and the practical
Flora—all these hold the attention as only living characters
can. For these alone the book is excellently worth
buying. And the storm that ends it is a quite tremendous
piece of descriptive writing; I know of no wind in fiction
(except perhaps the one in Ravenshoe) that has left me
feeling so buffeted and breathless.
If I am to have my highwayman endowed with most of
the Christian virtues, and only indulging his besetting
foible at the expense of unrighteous attorneys and the like,
I think I prefer the author to go the whole hog, and make
him marry the heroine at the end. Take, for instance,
Jemmy Abercraw (METHUEN), who is Mr. BERNARD CAPES's
ideal night-rider. Most of his escapades were undertaken
in a spirit of pure frolic humour; he never had to shoot a
man (because people knew he could hit bats on the wing),
and when, from want of funds and in the hope of securing
some hidden treasure, he was led to impersonate the
Young Pretender, thus imposing on those ardent Jacobites
Lady Drummond and her charming niece, he backed out
as soon as he discovered that the girl's honour was in ſ
danger of being compromised. Finally he saved this
young lady's life and that of her more respectable but not
nearly so attractive suitor, Lord Denville. And for all this
virtue and gallantry how does Mr. BERNARD CAPEs reward
him 2 Why, with a dastardly shot in the back on

noble life. For the rest there is some very pretty writing
in this novel, and the author has managed his final and
most thrilling situation with extreme skill; also he has
introduced a couple of delightfully villainous desperadoes
as a foil to the stainless chivalry of his young gentleman
of the road. But why not have made Jemmy Abercraw a
duke in disguise? And he could easily have built a
hospital or a free library to atone for the trifling errors of
his past.

THE POWER OF THOUGHT.
A CASE of PossEssion.
Bow Street, Nov. 25.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--Dr. JULIA SETON SEARs, M.D., the
founder of the New Thought Church and School, U.S.A.,
is over here on a crusade. She expounded her views at a
“small parlour audience” yesterday afternoon to a select
few disciples and others. She holds that if you want a
thing badly enough you get it. All you have to do is to
concentrate your thoughts, visualise whatever you want
to occur, and “see yourself in instant possession.”
Fortified with this simple programme of procedure I
determined to put it into practice at the earliest opportunity.
It occurred to me this morning, while strolling through
the National Gallery, that I badly wanted RomNEY's
portrait of Lady HAMILTON.
I concentrated hard for forty seconds, and visualised the
occurrence most successfully.
No sooner thought than done. .
I lifted the picture off its hook and walked away with
the precious acquisition under my arm, feeling really
immensely grateful to Dr. SEARS. I was, however,
observed by an officious attendant. -
The next moment I was practically “in instant posses.
sion" of the police, and am now waiting to be bailed out.
Will the leader of the New Thought kindly think me out 2
The case is urgent—or rather, it is proceeding, and it will
soon be too late.

Speed and smell are lords of the road.
Welcome, I ween, are the boons you offer,
Norfolk, to those who eschew repose:
Sporting links for the red-faced goller
Flaunting his florid hose;
Sands for the matutinal dippers;
Surf where they tumble and shout and sprawl;
Sea fronts blackened with cockney trippers,
Raucous with strains of the music-hall.
Here, no matter what hour you waken,
London papers are out on sale,
Here no hamlet, however forsaken,
Is free from the Daily Mail.
Here of yore was the home of the bustard;
Here were the Peggotty chapters planned;
Here to-day is the Mecca of mustard;
Here is the centre of Bloaterland.

I was so startled that I upset the

are awful, I'm afraid—in fact my family
always refers to them as my stable
manners. But that's so like a family.

If he does he starts at once. That,” I
added, indicating the third from the
end, “is a nice brown one.”

“I wonder. I'm afraid I shan't be
able to help. I say, isn't the weather
being rotten ?”
“You don't mean to tell me you're
a Radical ?” she said in horror.
“I most certainly didn't mean to tell
you. All I meant to say just then
was that I hadn't got a vote this
election; there isn't going to be a
contest in my division. Wasn't that
an awful fog the other night?”
“I suppose the Radicals are afraid
of fighting it,” she said scornfully.

“I meant honest in their convictions.”

“Perhaps they aren't gentlemen,

much nowadays. Top-hats are so
cheap, thanks to Free Trade—I mean
they will be so cheap when Tariff
Reform comes in—I say, let's have
another almond.”
I had an almond, and she had some-
thing more substantial, and then we
returned to the all-important subject.
“Did you read the leading article in
The Observer last Sunday?” she asked.
“Well, I did begin it after break-
fast,” I said, “but I had to go out to
supper, and I didn't have time to finish
it. I often wonder how these writing
fellows think of the things to say.
Don't you?”
“How anybody after reading that
could pretend to be in any doubt as to
which way he ought to vote——”
“Exactly; even by the end of the ninth
column or so I was in no doubt at all.
But unluckily I shan't have a vote at
this election. Do you know, until I
heard that you had read a whole leading
article in The Observer right through,
I wasn't really in favour of Women's
Suffrage. I should like to offer you
my vote, as it's no good to me.” .
She was very honest about it. “I
didn't really read it right through,”
she confessed. “Father quoted bits at
breakfast.”
“Ah, I thought perhaps that was it.
In instinct you women have the better
of us—but in stamina, no.”
“They speak of a woman's tact,
too,” she said, forgetting for a moment
the dangerous condition of the Empire.
“I often wonder about that. For
instance, if by some awful chance I
had been a Radical, this evening's con-
versation would have been singularly
embarrassing for me. But I suppose
your instinct --
“Of course ! I knew you couldn't be.
I take it for granted that all nice people
are Unionists.”
“Yes, but you don't really know
that I'm nice. That's the point. Quite
a short time ago I spilt the pepper
over you. And I’ve got an elbow on
the table now. Besides—”
She looked at me with wide-open
eyes. I could see that she was trying
to remember all that we had said.
“You’re not really,” she began in
amazement—
Somebody at the opposite end of the
room put in the reverse, and the con-
versation swung round. The man on
her other side eagerly claimed her
attention. The lady on my other side
turned to me.

“BUT we must have a General—all

the General.”
“ General what ? General Post
Office?” asked Margaret.
“I’ll be General KITCHENER."
“An' I'll be Gen'al Lekshun,” said
Joan, marching round with Peter's gun
on her shoulder.
“I say,” said Norman, popping up
from behind the sofa, where he had
been waiting to be attacked, “I quite
forgot to tell you; I heard father say
at breakfast that there is to be an
election, and before Christmas.”
“Get down—don't spoil the game.”
“Peter, dear, we'll put off the game;
Norman has introduced something far
more important,” said Margaret.
“He’s afraid of getting licked, that's
what it is,” said Peter ungraciously.
“It may not matter to you whether
Uncle Bob forgets us again this Christ-
mas,” said Norman, “but it jolly well
does to me.”
“To say nothing of the ladies,”
murmured Margaret.
“If people must put up for Parlia-
ment they ought not to make their
families suffer for it.”
“You mean relations,” said Margaret.
“Uncle Bob hasn't any families—he
isn't married, you must remember.”
“Well, you know quite well what I
mean, and if he was so busy last year
that he forgot us, he 'll be busier than
ever this year and he'll forget us again,
unless we do something.”
“But what can we do?” said Peter,
tossing his sword away.
A heated discussion followed. Nor-
man was for a deputation; Peter advo-
cated what he called a Red Robin ;
Joan was in favour of anything that
would settle it quickly and allow them
to return to the field of battle.
“No,” said Margaret, “it is rude to
ask for Christmas presents. I will
write him a letter.” And she wrote:
“DEAREST UNCLE Bob, We are all
so glad you are putting up for Sling-
hampton again, and we hope you get in.
It seems ages since we saw you—it must
be two Christmases ago. Poor Peter
has had such an accident—his model
steam-engine has been smashed to bits.
Norman is very well. He is very keen
on a model aeroplane and talks of
trying to make one after Christmas if
necessary. I am giving up foreign

taking to painting in a month or two,
if possible. Those paints in little tubes

PiCTURES OF LOVE.
My Bella is a charming maid,
One of the fairest of earth's creatures,
Brown eyes, brown hair, a trifle staid,
Well off, and with attractive features;
She is a thing without a taint:
The one fly in my pot of honey
Is that she thinks that she can paint ;
It's very funny.
Truth is an attribute I prize;
But in the processes of wooing,
When she displayed to my shocked eyes
Some dreadful daub that she was
doing,
I praised it warmly on the spot ;
I called it great—but meant to flatter;
It was a lie, but I did not
Think it would matter.
Nor did it then. But ever since
We told our love (with some emotion)
Fate has inspired her to evince
The breadth and depth of her devo-
tion
With gifts—not goods of silver, gold,
And such—not even an umbrella—
But pictures, awful to behold;
Oh, Arabella |
I have a “Spring" which makes one
creep,
“Autumn” (the trees alone are muddy),
Some things which I believe are sheep,
And something which she calls a
“Study,”
“Dawn on the sands” in fleshly pink,
A pair of blue seas and a green one,
And a weird cow, which makes you
think
She's never seen one.
My humble walls were once bedight
With works of some artistic merit;
Some bought, because they pleased the
sight;
Some, I was lucky to inherit;
Those well-loved friends have vanished
now ; -
Others, with strange and startling
faces,
Headed by that infernal cow,
Usurp their places.
It may be, as my friends declare,
I err in being too fastidious,
But can the eye that holds her fair
See that her work is aught but
hideous 2
And, tho' I try to bear in mind
The thought that love is blind, or
should be,
I am not blind—I can't be blind—
I wish I could be.
And yet, when Bella roams unchecked
About the room where hang those
pictures,
And stands, admiring the effect,
I clean forget my private strictures;
The simple fact that she is nigh
Seems to improve their aspect vastly;
It's when the artist isn't by
That they're so ghastly.
DUM-DUM.
THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY
OF PLASTERER PAINTERS.
(A further notice, in the manner of the gusher-
critics of the Post-Impressionist School.)
This delightful exposition might be
described as a salon de franctireurs
which has declared a guerre au mort
against draughtsmanship. Here, at
last, we can revel in all the nuances
of an art untrammelled by the impedi-
menta of academicity. Most of the
craftsmen have cut themselves free
from the worship of reality, and the
sapient amateur, therefore, can revel
in a Gargantuan banquet of artistic
hors d'oeuvre and decadent entremets.
I was particularly bouleversé by one
novelty, the absence of frames, the
necessity for which up to the present
has been an idée fire with the pot-
boilers. This mouveauté, with the
triangularity of nearly all the canvases,
added greatly to the charm of the
collection.
238. “Fog in a Coal Mine,” by A.
D'Aubergne, though catalogued as an
esquisse, almost possesses the attri-
butes of the grande machine. Marked
by frank reticence and well-considered
tonality, the peinture gives forth a
satisfactory colour appeal; the two
coal trucks glooming through the murk
are full of pendulous limpidity.
29. “Madame de B– and Daughters,”
by M. Fou, a capo di opera in this
master's best vein, is replete with subtle
feminality and clairvoyant coquetry.
The central figure, la mére, asserts
itself by the masterly way in which
her eau de Nil cheveur are touched in.
With one bejewelled hand (I think it is
a hand) resting on the head of her
daughters, she combines the sweltes
attraits of the greyhound with the
more ruminating maternity of the
vache. The chiaroscuro is well con-
sidered, and the essayage strikes the
juste milieu between decadence and art.
349. “Bethnal Green in Flood Time,”
by Miss Slade, is not so serieuse a
symphony as one would expect from
her brush. The reverberations of the
chimney stacks in the overflow from
the gas works are void of colour music
and are also too full of nervous line,
and the fact that, for some occult
reason, the picture has been hung a
l'envers obliges one to view it from a
somewhat inconvenient pose.
268. “The Model's Siesta,” by Herr
Johann, is a daring étude full of subtle
appas, by the pioneer of the tessellated
school. The recumbent figure posed
in front of the lectern is imagined
with audacity, and the dislocations of
the right shoulder admirably fore-
shortened. The flesh tints, though,
are not sufficiently grisaille, which,
added to the fact that the drawing of
the hands is indicated, fills me with
the misgiving that Herr Johann is
becoming a renegade and is pandering
to the uncultured taste of the many
who demand reality in art.

A SUPER-DIAMOND WEDDING.
[M. FERDINAND DUGUK, who wrote plays
produced between 1835 and 1875, and Mme.
DUGUE have just celebrated in Paris the
seventieth anniversary of their wedding day.
M. Dugu E is ninety-five years of age and his
wife ninety-two. The Petit Journal has invented
the expression “radium wedding” to denote
this unusual occurrence. To silver, golden and
diamond weddings, presents in those respective
metals are appropriate, but here we must draw
the line.]
A RADIUM Wedding's the latest
advance—
It hails from the home of marital
rolinance
And twentieth-century science—that's
France.
O the radiant smiles, we can guess
how they play -
Round the features of M. and Mme.
DUGUE
Faisant noce in their nonagenarian
way.
But one little protest we'd like to
make known
To persistent and elderly friends of
Our OWn
Who are trying to match such a Darby
and Joan | *
We can't—times are harder than ever
—present
Any radium tribute to mark the event,
As our last ready million was long
ago spent.
Chronological Inexactitude.
Mr. Punch finds that a series of
misprints which appeared in his last
issue under the heading “Hot Effort by
The Weekly Times” ought to have been
credited to The Evening Times. He
hopes that both papers will please par-
don him.
Reading that Bournemouth is sub-
stituting the over-head for the conduit
system of electric trams, a pedestrian
over whom a Panhard passed the other
day writes to suggest that a still more
pressing desideratum is an efficient
substitute for over-head motor cars.

MUSIC AND POLITICS.
THE political crisis and the pending
election are variously regarded by
singers, instrumentalists, and concert-
givers. Some take a pessimistic view
of the situation and resign themselves
to a period of inactivity, while others
evince a laudable desire to rise to the
occasion and turn their talents to party
or patriotic uses. Thus Mr. Otho
Dithers has composed a song cycle
entitled “Rec Dollarosus,” with which
he intends to tour in the Unionist
interest, while Mr. Widgery Biffin, an
ardent and uncompromising Radical,
has written a striking ballad entitled
“The Idle Plutocrat,” of which the
first verse runs as follows:–
“Meet, O meet me in the gloaming
When the bloom is in my blood,
When the salt sea waves are foaming
And the Lords are in the mud.”
Another extremely interesting musical
product of the crisis is an illuminated
symphony which Mr. Josef Quarter-
burn has composed and dedicated to
Lord LANsdowne. The “programme”
is furnished by the formula which
appeared in last Friday's Westminster
Gazette, and may be here repro-
duced:—
“The Lansdowne policy may best be stated
in a mathematical formula in which the various
letters represent the unknown quantities:
Let h = hereditary peer,
h' = hereditary peer ex: officio,
p = person chosen from outside,
m = n:ember of House of Commons.
Then
Horse of Lords (New Style) = x h + y h’ + zp.
If the two Houses differ, then a joint Session is
to le held, the members of which would be :
xh + y M +zp + 670m
a b
where a and b are indeterminate and unknown
divisors.”
Each of the quantities will be repre-
sented by a separate motive, while the
Joint Session will be treated as a Presto
strepitoso with a grand coda typifying
the Referendum. Mr. Quarterburn has
already completed the opening section,
maestoso assai, in which the motive of
the hereditary peer is assigned to a
muted trombone.
Finally Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE, inspired
by his conversation with Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE on the “national peril" of
Tory snobbishness, is to rewrite the
old topical song, “The Galloping Snob,”
under the title of “The Motoring Snob.”
The same gifted lyrist will also furnish
a new song called “Free Trade in a
Tea-cup,” dedicated to Lord DEvoN-
PORT.
“Even the best friends of the R.A.C. can
hardly refrain from saying that the club Jour-
mal’ has from first to last been as dry as
ditchwater.”—The Westminster Gazette.
Water, water everywhere
And never a drop of wet !
“Seventy guests lunched at Leicester round
one of the dials of the great clock which is
being built for the Royal Liver Insurance Com-
pany's new offices.”—Eastern Daily Press.
On such an occasion the most dyspeptic
guest could safely let himself go.

The partisan shouts and the bellicose trumps,
On whose weary shoulders this plaguy Election
Has superimposed the most heavy of humps—

You're losing your trade—so am I.
Time was when my Pegasus soared in a flighty
Career that confounded the aeroplane;
But now, overcome by a taedium vitae,
He sticks to the earth and won't flutter again.
It isn't caprice or an obstinate mood;
It's simply a question of food.
In those happy days, now regrettably ended,
When statesmen were shorn of their freedom of speech,
Consigned to quiescence while eight supermen did
Their best to repair the political breach,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extract ED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, Nov. 21.-
No one observing LANSDownB entering
the House this afternoon would suspect
him of having a card up his sleeve,
much less a dirk in his hose. Well
groomed, smiling, courteous, he took
his seat as if things were
likely to go forward in cus-
tomary humdrum style. Re-
viewing events by light of
final conflagration one recalls
a swift look from under
lowered eyelids comprehend- .
ing His Majesty's Ministers
on bench opposite, all un-
conscious of coming doom.
House crowded in every
quarter. Unionist Peers find-
ing no room on their own
side crossed floor, redressing
the balance between Minis-
terialists and the Opposition.
Gave the ordinarily desolate
quarter quite a comfortable
appearance. From the gal-
leries, on this occasion re-
served exclusively for Peer-
esses, bright eyes rained
influence. Some wives from
whom no secrets are hid
probably knew that mischief |
was afloat. Came down to |
see it launched. Black frocks
imposed by Lord CHAMBER-
LAIN's edict gave funereal
appearance to a portion of
the stately Chamber which
at other times blossoms like
the rose.
For a while business went |
forward on ordered lines.
Last week Opposition in-
sisted upon having what is
officially known as the Parlia-
ment Bill, more popularly
the Veto Bill, brought in.
Expected Government would
refuse, on ground that since
Dissolution is fixed for the
28th there would be no time
to debate so important a
measure. Possibly that had
been original intention. By
afterthought Cabinetdecided Billshould
forthwith be brought in, read a first time,
second reading taken this week. This
embarrassing for Opposition. Elec-
tioneering purposes much better served
if able to say a tyrannical Government
had withheld from House of Lords
opportunity of discussing measure
proposing to revolutionise its consti-
tution.
Noble Lords on Front Opposition
Bench were not born yesterday, or even
the day before. For the game of tactics
they number among them some of our
oldest, ablest parliamentary hands. It
would never do to throw out on second
reading a Bill introduced at their urgent
request. Introducing it CREwe stipu-
lated that, since there would be no
time for amending it before came the
Dissolution with exigent shears and
slit the thin-spun thread of the life of
OH ! (MR.) LAw !
Mrs. Tariff Reformer. “What Not to go out to-day, either Oh,
Bonar ! I believe YoU ’RE AshAMED of ME! You said I should have
such a lovely time in Manchester—“taxes everywhere,'—and here I am
cooped up in this miserable hotel and hardly allowed out at all !”
Mr. Bonar Law. “Well, you know, it really isn't my fault Look
here, I'll tell you what, I'll try and let you out after the declaration
of the Poll //"
lude customary conclusion by motion
for its rejection. Whilst this was
awaited, LANSDown E, literally stiffen-
ing his back, raising his voice,
quickening his utterance, moved ad-
journment of debate till Wednesday,
when, he announced, he would submit
a series of Resolutions.
These, subsequently read, were found
to embody alternative scheme of reform
of the Second Chamber in
º substitution of that provided
by Government measure.
Not even in succession of
surprises that has marked
growth of crisis since Parlia-
ment resumed its sittings
has there been anything so
dramatic as this. CREWE
actually gasped for breath.
Good KING GEORGE, con-
fronted by the mystery of
the apple enclosed in the
seamless dumpling, was not
more taken aback.
Almost expected to hear
the flustered inquiry reported
by PETER PINDAR, “What's
this 2 What's this 2 What ?
What 2 ”
Instinctively observing par-
liamentary formula, CREwe
falteringly said, “I do not
rise to oppose the noble
Marquis, but I do not under-
stand the nature of the pro-
ceeding he contemplates.”
“What I propose to do
this evening,” LANSDownB
replied, with curtness foreign
to his habit, “is to move the
adjournment of the debate.”
Which he forthwith did,
and so shunted into space
the Veto Bill.
Business done. — Lord
LANSDownB prepares little
surprise for His Majesty's
Ministers.
House of Commons, Tues-

that the Bill be read a second time.
Here was opportunity, and LANs-
Downe suddenly, unexpectedly leaping
aside from the track along which he
had jogged for half-an-hour, seized it.
CREwB moved second reading in

them about. For the rest their hearts
are with their constituents, their hearts
are not here. They want to be out
and about, telling it in the boroughs,
telling it in the counties, telling it in
Tottenham Court Road.
Only ButchER (J. G.) rises above
influence of tyrant circumstance. Re-
mains to make one last protest against
conduct of iniquitous Government.
Has discovered that Form IV., fallen
like a hailstone on English homesteads,
is withheld from hapless Ireland.
“Why should this be?” he sternly
asks, with glittering eye fixed on
trembling CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER.
Here is a Government professedly
sympathetic with Ireland, insistent
that its people shall in all respects be
treated on footing of equality with the
Saxon. Of course, what really is the
case is that Ministry blench at the
nod of their Master just back from
the United States, shudder in their
shoes when they hear the jingle of his
many dollars. Any way you like to
put it here is the unmistakable fact:
whilst Form IV. is lavishly distributed
throughout pampered England, Ireland,
Cinderella of the Empire, is deliberately
ignored.
“Why should Ireland wait?” ex-
claims BUTCHER, a tear of sympathy

BY TRICKS.
[A modest attempt at the sincerest flattery of
Mr. SEYMoUR Hicks.] -
LookING back on my strange mer-
curial life the most striking thing is
the extraordinary number of men I
have known, all of whom had at once
the wittiest tongues in England and
were my very dearest friends. Try as I
might I have never succeeded in know-
ing a dull man or disliking anyone.
As everyone knows—since one must
either get on or get out, and one can
get on only by advertising—I am a
man whose pores work very easily.
The other day I was lunching with my
dear old friend Plantagin, the dramatist.
He noticed me wipe my brow several
times, and then he remarked, “Tricks,
old boy, you ought to re-name yourself
Lieutenant Sudor.”
It was about this time that I first
met that prince of good fellows and
author of some of the most delightful
bons mots, Charlie Wintry, the comedian,
now my closest pal. He was the mad-
dest wit and the joy of the Paregoric
Club, to which I had just been elected.
Seeing me enter its hospitable portals
one day, he said, “Hullo, Tricks, old
boy, it's all over the town " “What
is?” I inquired. “The sky,” he re-
plied. He was always saying brilliant
things like that, to the discomfiture of
matter-of-fact people who did not think
in lightning flashes, as he does.
Apropos of good stories, I remember
an irascible pork butcher who had by
some means got into the Pullman car
in which ToolE, IRVING, GARRICK, Mrs.
BRACEGIRDLE, BURBAGE, I and some
others were going down to Brighton
one Sunday not so long since. That
type of man always excited BURBAGE
to do his best, and he tipped us the
wink. “Good morning, Sir,” he said.
“I have just been informed by the
guard that there is no stop before we
reach the Queen of Watering Places.”
“Of course there isn't,” said the stolid
merchant. “Why should there be?
This is a non-stopping express.” “Do
you know why?” BURBAGE asked, with
the same incomparable gravity. “No”
Then I'll tell you: Because there's a
‘b’ in ‘both "I" By this time we were
all convulsed; but not so the pork
butcher, who moved angrily into the
next car.
Sam Boaker, the manager, is, I am
proud to say, one of my very best of
friends, and has been ever since we
first met. The wittiest of men, I never
heard anything fall from his lips but
delightful sentiments and the finest
thoughts. I remember once that we
were walking on the Brighton Front.
It was just after the police had had to
be called in to his theatre owing to a
row in the pit; I forget about what.
He had suffered accordingly, and was
not a little sore about it. When, there-
fore, a beggar stopped him and asked
if he could spare a copper there is no
wonder that he replied: “Spare a
copper, my good man! Why, I could
spare the whole Forcel ” which was, I
think, one of the neatest répliques on
record.
What my future plans may be I
cannot at this moment state, but the
public is hardly likely to be long in
doubt. Meanwhile there is a little
lawsuit trouble about Richard III., so
I think I'll stop this autobiographical
caper and attend to it.

evening was eagerly viewed here. In a per-

AT THE PLAY.
“EcCENTRIC LoRD CoMBERDEN.E.”
At the end of the First Act it was
darkly whispered by one or two critics,
enjoying privileged information, that
Mr. CARTON was giving us a travesty
of a shilling shocker. In the interval
after the Second Act the secret was in
the possession of quite a number of
people, and the fear was generally ex-
pressed that the ruder intelligences
would fail to grasp the subtlety of it
all. What the average man could
make out unaided was this: That here
was a play with a rather improbable
and loosely-woven plot (not an un-
common thing in the legitimate drama);
with a lot of secret conversation liable
to be overheard (also a not un-
usual feature of the ordinary play);
and with some very refreshing
wit in the less lurid sections of
the dialogue. If these are the
right characteristics of a shilling
shocker, then Mr. CARTON is an
excellent parodist. But, of course,
the only resemblance lay in the
absurdity of the construction, and,
perhaps, in one or two trifling eccen-
tricities in the character of Lord
Comberdene, who served as a
kind of showman to point out the
author's intentions.
I should have thought that if
you are going to burlesque a
novelette you should try and bur-
lesque it all through. You can't
combine a plot out of The Family
Herald with dialogue of the first
water. “Has he a wife?” “Not
one of his own.” Is this the sort
of thing you look for in melodrama
from across the bridges? And, to
increase the inconsistency, some
of the characters who were asked
to do the most farcical things were
possible as a criminal, was altogether
probable and consistent as a hotel
conversation - fiend. I really think
that the people who enjoyed the
play best were those who took it as
pure melodrama, and did not worry
themselves about the author's scheme.
Certainly the enthusiasm was most
spontaneous at the point where the
hero outwits the villains and locks
them up in the room they had meant
to burgle.
All the same, I have a sneaking
admiration for Mr. CARTon’s enter-
prise. Anything for a fresh idea, if it
only means the revival of an art long
lost to the regular stage.
Mr. GEorge ALExANDER as Lord
Comberdene was very happily suited,
and seemed to enjoy himself. But
GETTING THE MAIN SHEET INTO A K
perfectly reasonable between times; Lord Cºmberdene
for example, Joseph Radburn, im- Lºu Gº”y
then he had known all the time what
the author was trying to get at. He
was too generous to keep the knowledge
to himself, and confided now and again
to our dull ears that he was supposed to
have the makings of a melodramatic hero.
Miss CoMPTON was irresistibly solid, but
I wish she had been given a few more
good things on which to employ her
captivating drawl. Miss RITA Jolivet
was clever and piquante as a Grand
Duchess masquerading as a maid, and
Mr. LYSTON LYLE in the part of Joseph
Radburn, arch-criminal, was so ad-
mirable when he assumed the disguise
of a harmless prattler that Irecommend

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. EDEN PHILLPoTTs is so accomplished and versatile
a writer that sooner or later one knew he would write a
fairy story for children. I must confess, however, to being
a little disappointed by the result—The Flint Heart (SMITH
ELDER)—for it has faults both of matter and of manner;
and those of manner I had most fervently hoped were
obsolete. I refer to the clever sophisticated asides of the
author, in a story that ought to be wholly and single-
heartedly addressed to the young. Mr. PHILLPotts should
be peculiarly able to resist this temptation since he has
such a large purely grown-up public. As for the faults of
matter, they are chiefly due to a complex rather than
a simple scheme, and extend even to the creation of a pixy
named Thomas de Quincey, and to an imbroglio in the
domain of frogs not too unlike our own political crisis.
But the first part of the book and the controlling idea is
excellent, and I wish that no fairy had ever been let in,
Mr. PHILLPoTTs being so peculiarly a writer about human
beings.
I think that Violet PEARN was ill advised to introduce a
cricket match so early into Separate Stars (MURRAy),
especially as it has so little to do with the plot of the book.
“As he spoke Roger lifted his bat” (this was how the
game ended), “the ball smashed through the air over the
fielders' ducking heads; it was the third six of a magnifi-
cent innings. The match was won for the Gunners with
two wickets and thirty seconds to spare.” After that I
should, if I had been the printer, have placed a whole row
of stars. But as a matter of fact the contest which forms
the theme of the novel is that of Art v. Love in the soul of
a woman prevented by circumstances from realising her
own considerable talent. Joan Pellew marries a gay officer
(the JEssop alluded to above) and when he dies still hopes
to see her ambition fulfilled in the genius of her son.
When he turns out to be a painter of brilliant technique
but no grandeur of inspiration, she sets to work in despair
to learn again the craft she has almost forgotten. Both
the matter of the story and the manner of its telling
improve considerably in the later stages, and the childhood
of Maurice and the characters of Lady Julia Hardcastle,
with whom he falls in love, and of the artist who falls in
love with his mother in her widowhood, make up for the
rather wooden portraiture and style with which the book
begins. But I am glad that Maurice did not take to
cricket like his father, and cut sixes through the shrinking
chests of third man and second slip.
It all depends on whether you have outgrown your taste
for Polperro Rock. You remember the stuff? Made by

Uncle Polperro (FISHER UNwiN). Anyhow, it was a sort
of illustrated sweetmeat (“Bite where you like and there's
always a picture in the middle,” as Mr. ALPHONSE
CourLANDER takes care to remind you), made of a com-
bination of three simple ingredients, boiled sugar, gelatine,
and liquorice. What is more, this ingenuous Rock
enabled Mr. Polperro to retire from business and purchase
the title-deeds of Bongoland from a kind of confidence-
trick man, by name M. Jemairien, and if you study that
name closely you will realise to the full the trustfulness of
Mr. Polperro's character. By his successful manufacture of
confectionery Mr. Polperro brought happiness to thousands
of children without impairing their digestion; and his
failure to become the self-
mately wax rich and multiply, while suicide disposes of
Mandevil, and Carfar reports himself in debt and “in a
beastly thirty-pound-a-year villa in Tottenham ” — it
emphasises the danger of being either a criminal or a cad.
When an author, still more when an authoress, sets about
to tell a pretty story of rustic love in a rose-garden, of
white cottages, of sunny orchards, and of a fairy god-
mother in modern dress, it is always a matter of touch
and go whether the written word be one of sweet
simplicity or laboured affectation. Once, indeed, ANNIE E.
Holdsworth (Mrs. LEE-HAMILTON, that is) touched and
went, for she told the critic
made President of the Re-
public of Bongoland spells
bliss, I gather, to those two
other children, Jennifer, his
niece, and Charles Hastable,
his hard-up medical nephew.
More than a third of the
book is occupied with an
account of the voyaging of
the would - be Republicans
from London to Bongoland
on board the Dje-mi-méh (so
readily does Mr. CourLANDER
appreciate the humour of
names), and the vessel is com-
manded by Captain Snack,
the most saccharine sea-dog
who ever conducted a mutiny,
and a gelatine mutiny at
that. As a make - weight
Lord Aveling is thrown in.
He is a peer who takes un-
conventional holidays. “In
London,” he says, “do you
think I could go into a cheap
restaurant without losing half
my friends?" And it is in
the disguise of a mate that
he ships under the unsuspect-
ing Snack. There is no lack
of boiled sugar in this story,
but I was not in the least
fed up.

little sorry for Carfar, into

that through the open door
of a church “the scent of
newly mown hay wandered
in hand in hand with the
summer day,” and the critic
laughed at the idea of it. For
the rest, when he laughed,
he laughed with her at the
quaintness of the country
carrier and the town-bred
smartness of Mrs. Pratt-
Thompson ; and, when the
loves of pretty Ruth and
proud Roger did not go well
for all the legacies of Miss
Madden, the sentiment was
very touching and the pathos
never too pathetic. There
were, moreover, Mrs. Cart-
wright, stern mother of Roger
and outspoken old gossip,
and some other village bodies,
happy protégées of Ruth :
there were the amiable gen-
try, even an intellectual or
two, and on the whole the
critic has no reason or desire
to suggest that, for delicacy
of taste and lightness of
touch, the substance of the
book is a whit inferior to its
title, The Little Company of
Ruth (METHUEN).

When I was about ten I
narrowly missed a black eye
from a youth of eleven be-
cause I gave away the plot
story, The Little Gray Man
(ARNoLD), because he suffered from such inefficient
stage - management that—to get the information which
his rôle required—he was everlastingly hiding in cup-
boards, dodging round corners, and placing his ear to
keyholes. Still, I am not concerned to say that either my
excuses, or those which he made so lavishly for himself,
leave him a desirable creature. In the race for the iniquity-
stakes, however, he was a very bad second to Mandevil,
who was so incredibly vicious that I regarded him more as
a globule of concentrated wickedness than as a human
being. Possibly the author gains some piquancy from
the way in which he has chosen to tell his tale; never-
theless, should any budding novelist be thinking of writing
in the first person, I do not hesitate to recommend this
book as a warning. Let me add that it also contains
several distinct thrills, and that—since the innocent ulti-
of a Henty before the excited
young pugilist had had time to read it. I am not, there-
fore, going to let the cat out of the bag in respect of Mr.
HERBERT STRANG's book, The Adventures of Dick Treranion
(FRowde AND Hodder AND Stoughton). I will say merely
that there are smugglers in it, and excisemen, and caves,
and privateers, two young heroes, a first-class villain, and
regular top-hole adventures. Let those take note who are
prospecting for Christmas gifts.
The Western Morning News prints Mr. F. E. Smith
as follows: -
“Little fleas have smaller flets upon their backs to bith them :
Smaller fleas had lesses fleas, and so on ad infinitum. (Laughter.)"
This is hard on Mr. SMITH, but it is also unfair to the big
flea, who gets left out altogether.

THE DETACHMENT OF PRENDERBY.
THE PEOPLE v. THE CoMMONs.
IN times of great stress and heat I am always glad to
avail myself of the atmosphere of temperate calm which
pervades the presence of Prenderby. As a General Election
approaches he grows more and more detached, till he
almost disappears from sight. Of course I only take an
academic interest in his points of view, and would never
let him persuade me to adopt an attitude even of semi-
detachment. And, to do him justice, he never tries to
convert me. He says he would not wish to sacrifice
any source of quiet entertainment.
“Well, what about the Referendum ?” I asked.
“I hold no brief for that Alpine device,” said Prenderby,
“for I have never mistaken the people's voice for the
voice of a god. But I retain the right to be surprised and
shocked when I see that the very party which has always
vouched for the divinity of Demos now protests against
the idea of directly consulting its own beloved oracle on
matters of grave doubt.”
“Our contention,” said I, coming fresh and fortified from
a study of Lord MoRLEY's great speech in favour of main-
taining the Constitution intact, “is that our country's system
is a representative system, and that the Referendum would
disfigure the authority of the people's representatives.”
“If,” said Prenderby, as though reading my thoughts,
“you allude to Lord MoRLEY, for whom I entertain a
profound respect, I should think more of his Conser-
vative arguments if he himself were not in favour of
a Radical Bill for breaking up the Constitution by
means of what he facetiously calls an “adjustment of
the relations between the two Houses on an amic-
able basis.” However, I sympathise with you—for
the moment. I have always held that, in an ideal
democracy, the people's representatives, once elected,
should be given a free hand to do their best for the
country during the natural term of Parliament. But then
I would have our representatives chosen on a principle
very different from that which is in use. I would choose
—Liberals or Unionists—men of the highest intelligence,
experience and patriotism, on whose judgment I could rely
even for the handling of questions on which my opinion
had never been consulted. But how and why do we actually
elect our Members? Not, except in rare cases, on their
personal merits; not as thinking men; but just as speci-
mens of one or other party, foisted on us by a caucus. And
there they sit in the House with instructions to surrender
their private judgment (if any) and act as voting automata
at the bidding of the party whip. What guarantee can we
have that on any given question, possibly not even contem-
plated among the variegated issues at a General Election,
our dummy really ‘represents us? Unless we make a
change in our methods, I see no solution of a rotten state
of things except through the Referendum.”
“Its introduction as a party cry,” I said, “at the last
moment justifies our humorists in describing it as a red-
herring-endum.”
“True wit delights me,” said Prenderby, on a note of
discouragement. “But what, after all, is the matter with
a good red herring 2 It is an excellent thing for dragging
across the trail when the field is on the scent of a hare
that 's got the plague. But to return to this piercing outcry
against the notion of going over the heads of the people's
representatives to consult the people themselves. Have
you observed lately what a deal of talk there is about the
dignity and authority of the House of Commons? It
seems to have assumed an importance far exceeding that of
the men who elect it. And, curiously enough, it is with
the steady decline in the personal weight and influence
of its Members (since only a dozen or so on each side are
allowed to count as anything more than mere Ayes or
Noes), and with its gradual humiliation under the pressure
of party machinery, that we find the House of Commons
developing this habit of self-complacency. And I recognise
in the Referendum the best available corrective for such a
state of swelled head. If I am not inviting you to betray
a party secret, what, may I ask, is your objection to it.”
“If,” I said, “the people's verdict were unfavourable it
would mean a General Election every time. No self-
respecting Government could survive the rebuff to its
prestige.”
“I doubt it,” said Prenderby cheerfully. “I have too
firm a confidence in the tenacity of most Ministries.
They would sit tight and try something else. But, in all
probability, they would seldom or never incur such a rebuff.
They would guard their dignity by so moderating their
proposals as to ensure their acceptance by the country.”
“Well, anyhow,” said I, “it was only a tactical move of
the Tories at the eleventh hour.” .
“My dear fellow,” said Prenderby, with a touch of com-
passion, “the peculiality of the eleventh hour is not only
that it comes just before the twelfth, but also that it comes
just after the tenth. Late tactics have to be answered by
tactics later still. Black at an advanced stage makes a
forward move which exposes one of his own pieces. White
steps in and snaps it up. “Aha!” says Black, ‘why didn't
you think of that before ? You've committed an after-
thought.’ Or else he shouts, ‘White Flag l' just because
his opponent deliberately sacrifices a pawn or two to save
his King.”
“If you're going to drag in the Crown,” I said—
“I drag in nothing,” said Prenderby, “not even a red
herring. As I said before, I hold no brief for the
Referendum. I am not a good enough democrat. But I
may permit myself to be politely amused when I find the
Conservative party more democratic than your democrats
themselves; stealing the Radical thunder and going one
better with it. I may permit myself this recreation and
yet remain detached from party.” -
“Like Lord RosBBERY at Manchester,” I said wither-
ingly. “I see that in his ‘non-party' speech he referred
to the American dollars, though I noticed that he said
nothing of Sir WILFRID LAURIER's contribution.”
“If you must drag in the Prime Minister of Canada,”
said Prenderby, “let me say that I have a particular regard
for him which is not increased by his interference in the
matter of Home Rule. What would you and Canada think
of Mr. AsquitH if, while Premier of England, he openly
subscribed to the funds of one of the parties in a Canadian
election ? As for Lord RoseBERY, I resemble him, very
modestly, in this—that we are both enamoured of moderate
counsels; he as a member of the despised peerage, I as an
ornament of the down-trodden middle-classes. I look
forward to the day of moderate men; to the coming of a
National party which shall combine the best of both sides.”
“Meanwhile,” said I, for I shrank from flirting with this
rather seductive prospect, “meanwhile the polls begin to-
morrow, and we shall soon know whether the people
accept or reject the idea of a Referendum.”
“Whether, in fact,” said Prenderby, “they prefer to put
their trust in their representatives or in themselves.”
“We shall see,” said I.
“We shall see,” said Prenderby.
At last we had touched a point of agreement, and I
seized the opportunity to shift my ground to domestic
woods and pastures uncontroversial. - O. S.

THE NEW PLANK AT WORK.
IN the year 19— the Referendum
was in full swing. Mr. Bilberry's seven
years' rule had just come to an end,
with the result that he had been com-
pelled to ask for a dissolution of Parlia-
ment; and he and Mr. Aston were now
appealing to the country.
The position of affairs at this time
may be described in a few words.
Switzerland, flattered that the greatest
nation in the world should re-model its
Constitution upon the lines of hers,
had returned the compliment by laying
down a naval programme which altered
entirely the whole European situation,
and called for a renewed effort on the
part of England. For this effort more
taxes were necessary, and it was upon
the method of raising these taxes that
the Election would turn.
Mr. Aston was for getting the new
taxes from the Rich.
Mr. Bilberry was for getting them
from the Others.
Mr. Aston appealed to the Working
Man for support. He said: “The
situation is simply this: We must have
this money. Shall we get it from the
Rich or from the Others?”
* Man for support.
The Working Man thought pro-
foundly, and then said, “What you
mean is, would I rather you got it
from 'im or from me 2"
“Exactly,” said Mr. Aston.
“Right you are,” said the working
man. “Then I says from 'im.”
Mr. Bilberry appealed to the Working
He said: “The
situation is simply this: we must have
this money. Mr. Aston proposes to
tax the Rich. I need hardly point out
to you what a calamity that would be
to the working classes. It is folly to
suppose that you can take money from
the Rich without hurting the poor. In
a thousand indirect ways it would affect
you. Now my tax would only have the
effect of stimulating you slightly.”
“Wot O !” said the Working Man,
and left it at that.
To the Middle Classes Mr. Bilberry
said, “The nation is in Deadly Peril
of Socialism. When the nation is in
Deadly Peril there is only one party
for which an Englishman can vote.”
And some of them, who had read of the
Deadly Peril in which the nation had
stood when the Abolition of the Death
Penalty for Larceny was first sug-
gested, were not greatly alarmed. But
others him their
votes.
To the Upper Classes Mr. Bilberry
said: “What do you think of this 2"
There were many other questions
brought forward during the election,
but the surprising unanimity of the
rival candidates on the more important
ones prevented them from having any
considerable bearing on the result.
For whenever an Astonite said: “Once
again I advocate this and this,” the
Bilberryite would say hastily: “Why,
my dear fellow, of course / That's what
I've been saying for weeks / If any-
thing, I should go even further, and do
that and that.”
Mr. Aston was returned by a small
majority. His Bill for taxing the Rich
was immediately drawn up, discussed
in the House of Commons, and sub-
mitted to a Referendum.
Those who had previously voted for
Mr. Bilberry, having no use for Mr.
Aston, answered “No."
Of those who had voted for Mr.
Aston —
The Working Man said, “O' course,
if it's a choice between me and 'im,

then I say ‘No,' becos 'e'll only take

The Middle Classes said, “Our second
cousin by marriage tells us that he'll
be ruined if this Bill passes; and those
nice people who asked Phyllis down
for Christmas are in a terrible way
about it. Of course, we should never
dream of voting for Mr. Bilberry, but
this really goes a little too far.”
The Upper Classes said: “Frankly,
old man, you're asking rather too
much, you know. I voted for you at the
last election and I’ll vote for you again
at the next. If you say bluntly to me:
‘Ought we to tax the Rich or the
Others ?’ well, I answer “The Rich';
and if now I had to decide whether I
or the poor man should pay, of course
I'd pay up like a shot. But I haven't
got to decide that. You're pledged
not to tax the Others any more, and the
only question for me is whether I like
your Bill. Well, you can't blame me,
old man, if I say that I don't.”
Mr. Aston's Bill was rejected by
the People. He resigned. Mr. Bil.
berry accepted office and advised a
Dissolution.
At the General Election Mr. Bilberry
pointed out that the Astonites had |
shown themselves absolutely impotent
to deal with the extremely critical
situation, the threatened danger from
the Swiss programme not having been
met by any of the necessary financial
provisions. He also pointed out that
this election had been forced upon the
country at an extremely inconvenient
time for shopkeepers. Mr. Bilberry was
returned. -
Mr. Bilberry's Bill for taxing the
Others was immediately drawn up, dis-
cussed in the House of Commons, and
submitted to a Referendum.
Those who had voted for Mr.
Aston, having no use for Mr. Bilberry,
answered “No.”
Of those who had voted for Mr.
Bilberry:-
The Upper Classes said, “I say, old
man, what? I mean—well—I shall
have to think it over. I didn't know
it was going to be like this 1 Of course,
I'd sooner shoot myself than do any-
thing to put Aston in, but— You
know, even if this went against you,
you needn't resign, need you?”
The Middle Classes said: “Of course,
it is a time of national peril, and one
is prepared to make sacrifices. But
they must be reasonable sacrifices.
I don't think I should be justified,
as a family man, in voting for this.
It isn't a question of what we want,
but what we can afford. I have just
worked it out, and I see that I shall
have to pay—well, I mean, it's absurd."
The Working Man said: “Well,
lorblimey, do I want it? Do I look as
if I wanted it 2 I may 'ave been a
mug at the election, but 'eaven bless
your dear innercent face if you think
you'll catch little Willie again.”
Mr. Bilberry's Bill was rejected by
the People.
I forget whether Mr. Bilberry re-
signed.

And nothing had been done about

You will understand, then, how it
was that some years later, when a Bill
for remodelling the Constitution on
its old lines of Parliamentary Govern:
ment was brought in, it was approved
by the People amidst scenes of the
greatest excitement. An additional
reason for celebration was the fact that
it was the first Bill which had survived
the Referendum. A. A. M.

IN PRAISE OF WINTER ELECTIONS.
At the season of chills, when the breath of the vapours |
Is hardened to delicate rime,
You have heard, Mr. Asquith, no doubt, from the papers
That polls are a crime.
Let it cheer you to know, in the midst of their curses,
Whoe'er may be moaning his lot,
That the writer of these irresponsible verses
- Is not.
For, whether in winter or whether in summer,
The farce of electoral throbs
Interferes with the odes of a lyrical thrummer,
And bores him to sobs;
But I think, on the whole, that the moon of the holly
Is best for the madness to fall,
If we must have º moments of imbecile folly
t all.
For out in the streets there are hundreds of posters
The eye of the artist to vex;
There is thumping of tubs and a legion of boasters
That bark through their necks.
Is it there that Apollo is like to exhort us,
Or lead his melodious choir 2
Shall the voice of the turtle be there or the tortoise-
-shell lyre 2
Not much : but within, for the brethren of Orpheus,
Is comfort and wassail and ease,
Undisturbed by the insolent argot of wharf-use—
The words of bargees.
It is well that a time when the demagogues prosy
Are drowning the harp with their roars
Should be also a time when it's deucedly cosy
Indoors.
When the vulgar are crowding, with faces that tingle,
To booths where the hurricanes whizz,
I shall sleep by the fire, in the nook of the ingle
(Whatever that is),
And be glad that the polls have come round in December,
When (warm with the winter's good cheer)
The bard can most easily fail to remember
They're here. Flvoe.
From an Indian paper:

near Darjeeling, as a Boarding House and Piggery.”

attended by Lord CROMER, Lord BALFour of BURLEIGH,
Mr. ARTHUR ELLIOT, Mr. St. Loe: STRACHEY, Lord
Robert CECIL, Lord HUGH CECIL, and others, Lord
CRoMER being in the Chair. After delivering many impas-
sioned speeches in defence of Free Trade, they decide to
reorganise themselves and to offer a determined resistance
to Tariff Reform. The meeting separates amid great
enthusiasm, punctuated by patriotic songs. +
March 3.——Introduction and first reading of Government
Bill for the Nationalisation of Motor-Cars.
March 4.—The Times, in a leading article, declares that
to nationalise motor-cars is to ruin the nation. The Daily
Mail publishes an article by Mr. LEO MAXSE declaring
that all members of the Government, including the Junior
Lords of the Treasury (unpaid), are outside the pale of
humanity and must be shot at sight. The Daily News
denounces opposition to the Bill as factious and interested.
March 5 (if March 5 falls on a Sunday).-Mr. J. L.
GARVIN publishes in The Observer a leading article twelve
columns in length. He demands the impeachment of
Mr. AsquitH and the immediate execution of all Irish
Nationalist Members on Tower Hill. “Only thus,” he
concludes, “can we avenge the dastardly insult which has
been offered to our English manhood. Only thus can we
remove the ineffaceable stain which has been smeared in
lurid and degrading colours over our escutcheon.”
March 6.-Formation of Motor Nationalisation League.
March 7.—Establishment of Anti-Nationalisation of
Motors League. - - - -
March 8.-Each League calls on the other to publish a
list of its subscribers. - -
March 12.-Mr. J. L. GARVIN declares in a leading
article of nineteen columns that he is not now a Home
Ruler.
March 17.-Lord Rose BERY makes his three-hundredth
non-party speech against the Government at a great non-
party meeting held in the City of London under the chair-
manship of Mr. A. J. BALFour.
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE addresses a meeting at Plaistow.
He threatens the House of Lords with extinction, and com-
pares their lordships to rats fed on red herrings.
March 20.—In a long and carefully reasoned letter to
The Times Sir HENRY Howorth points out that, whatever
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's own diet may be, he (Sir HENRY) has
never yet known a member of the House of Lords who
cared to eat a red herring.
March 21.-Mr. F. E. SMITH, in a great speech at Chel-
tenham, calls Mr. LLoyd GEORGE the Red Herring King.
March 22.-Mr. WINstoN CHURCHILL, in a great speech at
Sevenoaks, denounces Mr. F. E. SMITH as impish, impudent
and impossible.
March 23. — Mr. F. E. SMITH and Mr.
CHURCHILL dine together.
March 24.—Lord RoseBERY makes his three-hundred-
and-first non-party speech against the Government at a
great non-party meeting in Birmingham under the chair-
manship of Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN. He shows that
the nationalisation of motor cars leads straight to the
nationalisation of clocks and watches, spoons and forks
and small change of all sorts, and that from this to the
destruction of religion, family life, marriage and Sunday
beer is but a step.
April 3. –The Unionist Free Traders at a great and
enthusiastic meeting declare that if Mr. BALFOUR will agree
WINSTON
to postpone Tariff Reform they will be prepared to vote for
Tariff Reformers.
April 4.—Mr. BALFour says he is willing to postpone

great non-party meeting held in Belfast under the chair-
manship of Sir Edward CARson.

that Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL is a disgraced disseminator
of dishonour.
April 11.—Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL at a meeting in
Deptford declares that Mr. F. E. SMITH always prefers
mendacity to men and stupidity to statesmanship. -

Sent his shipping for such as these—
Peacocks flaunt like an opal necklace,
Figurey almug's fair and fleckless,
Ivory's smooth and white and speckless
(Tusks on a plinth of gold);
And the little grey monkeys, so wrinkled wise,
Little grey apes with the twinkling eyes,
Puckered, brown and cold,
'Spite of their lightsome ways and reckless,
Know the wisdom of gods of old !
SoLoMon sat by his garden palaces
Seeking wisdom of earth and air;
Little grey apes, full of mocks and malices,
Chipped and chattered around his chair;
Chipped and chattered and made grimaces,
Rubbed their backs and their wrinkled faces,
Swung themselves with a score of graces
Through the cedar trees;
But never their knowledge could SoLoMon catch,
For, if he asked them, they'd only scratch,
Stop and scratch for fleas;
Then they'd rocket away in races,
Ruffling, scuffling, in twos and threes'
So SoLoMon sent for HIRAM, King o' Tyre;
HIRAM strode 'neath the budding leaf,
Purple vesture and golden ring, attire
Fit indeed for a merchant chief;
He bade him watch the monkeys slipping
Through the pomegranate branches dipping
Over the fountains ferned and dripping,
Green and clear and cold;
And “'Tis excellent knowledge,” King HIRAM said,
“That keeps its learning inside its head;
That's your monkey's gold—
That's the reason that sets them skipping—
That's their wisdom of gods of old !”

| FANTASY.
THERE is no truth in the following
account. It is based solely on the
unconfirmed report of the central
figure. That central figure is I, and I
have just stated that there is no truth
in it. It is not the truth, part of the
truth, or anything like the truth. It
is the invention of one miserable,
downtrodden Junior; the outpourings
of a soul clamouring for freedom and
self-expansion. Let me pretend, just
for once, that I am not the most per-
manently rebuked person in the world,
who may not even say “Boo!” to an
usher without being told that I am
frivolous, vexatious, and an abuse of
the process of the Court. Let me
pretend all that. Will you?
Counsel for the Plaintiff said what
he had to say, and all eyes were fixed
on me. You see, I was Counsel for
the Defendant, and there we all were
sitting in the High Court and making
a day of it.
“Forgive me,” I said, “but I did not
quite follow what you were saying. I
was thinking of something else. Start
at the beginning and say it all over
again.” Then I closed my eyes and
put my feet up on the K.C.’s bench in
front of me, not, as I assured them, to
go to sleep, but because I could hear
better in that position. When at last
they insisted on a few words from me,
I, seeing that there was no way out of
it, got up and addressed them.
“Look here, Judge, old man,” I said,
“it is all very fine for t'other fellow to
talk about vendors and purchasers and
estoppels (what is an estoppel, any-
way?) and all that rot. It is all very
fine for him to go burbling on about
statutes and cases, but the cold truth
is that he wants my client to pay his
client hundreds and hundreds of pounds,
and my client ain't going to do no such
thing. He has the best reasons for
refusing, but I am not at liberty to
divulge them. At least I have forgotten
most of them, and I never could under-
stand the rest. I can promise you
that they are first-class reasons, if a
bit complicated in parts, and I can
promise you that my client is a man in
a thousand.”
Mr. Justice What's-his-name, who I
really don't think can have been listen-
ing, bestirred himself to ask me what
about the Sale of Goods Act. But I
told him that I was not going to
answer that question, because I knew
there was a catch in it somewhere.
Besides, I told him that I knew nothing
about the Law, and cared less.
“Ignorantia juris haud excusat,” he
muttered, and while the court rocked

with subservient and hilarious laughter
I took my pipe out of my pocket and
lit it.
“Tell me when I'm due to laugh,”
said I between the puffs, “and I'll do
my best for you. Now, if you are quite
sure you have finished being funny, I
will go on with the case. My dear old
Lud, what is the use of all this chin-
wagging? The fact is that my client
wants all his money for himself, and
if he finds, when he comes to do his
accounts at the end of the year, that
he has got a little over, you may bet
your wig that he is not going to give
that little to a man with a face like
the Plaintiff's. Do we admit liability,
you ask? We admit any old thing
you like, for a little peace. More than
that, if you will all come across to the
Cock Tavern, Plaintiff, Plaintiff's coun-
sel, Plaintiff's solicitor, clerks, ushers,
court-loafers, and even your bonny old
self, we'll stand the drinks if you'll
let bygones be bygones. There !”
I sat down, humming a popular
melody to show that I bore no malice,
and the Judge said something bitter
about “Judgment for the Plaintiff in
the full amount of his claim and costs.”
As for me I went up to where the old
fellow sat on his perch and cooed,
“Bench, dear boy, you are not cross
with me, are you?” and, arm-in-arm
with my client and his solicitor, strolled
out of court as happy as a sandboy.

OPERATIC INTELLIGENCE.
ExPENSIVE PRODUCTION OF
“TorqueMADA.”
(Special.)
THE music of Torquemada, as all
intelligent amateurs are doubtless well
aware, has been more extravagantly
praised and abused than any which
has ever been composed since the days
of Orpheus. Herr Boboloff, the famous
St. Petersburg critic, has described it
as a musical Reign of Terror; while
Signor Puppo Stecchi, of Milan, calls
it the “me plus ultra of cosmic ecstasy.”
The same eminent authority also calls
attention to the extraordinary way in
which Herr Cassowar combines deep
spirituality with a cynical freakish-
ness. “Scenes of an outrageous inde-
corum,” he writes, “are handled with
the utmost solemnity, while those
passages in the drama which touch on
the deepest mysteries of religion are
treated with a hearty irreverence which
recalls the most splendidly ghastly
orgies of the cult of Reason in the
French Revolution. Herr Cassowar is
as cruel as Nature, as brutal as death
—in short, a genius of the deepest dye,
and in Torquemada he has found a
theme which gives his gorgeous inhu-
manity superlative scope.” It will be
readily understood that music of this
quality is extremely expensive to com-
pose and produce, and no apology is
needed for the announcement that, on
the occasion of the performance of this
epoch-making work, the price for hiring
opera-glasses will be raised from six-
pence to ten shillings.
The rôle of Dolores will be under-
taken by the famous American prima
donna, Madame Poppaea Scarlett, who
created it on the occasion of the original
production at Widdin. As Madame
Scarlett holds the record for the highest
fee ever paid to a prima donna for a
single performance—viz., £10,000—the
prices will be raised on this and all
occasions on which she will appear.
All the reserved seats have already
been taken, with the exception of a few
extra stalls attached by pulleys to the
central electrolier. These can be had
for 50 guineas apiece.
The orchestra will be increased from
85 to 170 performers for the production
of Torquemada, as the scoring for the
instruments of percussion is unusually
rich, the drums being often divided
into as many as twenty genuine parts,
while extra instruments of peculiar
sonority, including the Schreckhorn,
are employed in the torture scenes in
order to drown the shrieks of the
victims. The immense extra expense
to which the management has been
put in order to meet these require-
ments has involved a revision of the
refreshment tariff, and on the nights on
which Torquemada is performed the
charge for coffee will be 2s. 6d. a cup,
and for ices 15s. each.
The scenery, which has been specially
hand-painted for the production, is of
special magnificence, many thousand
tubes of the choicest paint having been
exhausted on the superb canvases pro-
vided by the artists, MM. van Dorb
and Karameloff. In consequence of
this terrific outlay, running into several
thousands of pounds, the management
have been reluctantly obliged to raise
the prices of the programmes and books
of the words, which will be supplied at
5s. and £1 1s. respectively.
The Ballet of Inquisitors is of alto-
gether unusual size, and the strain
imposed upon them in the Dance of the
Seventy Thumbscrews is so exacting
that a special honorarium has been
added to their usual salary. In view
of this fact the management respectfully
beg to announce that the cloak-room
fees will be increased on Torquemada
nights from 3d. to 4}d.
It is only right to add that, in spite
of all these enhanced charges, the
management expect to lose at least
£20,000 on the production.
CoMFoRTING REFLECTION AT THE
Post-IMPRESSIONISTs'.—Things, after
all, are not so bad as they're painted.

EITHER HUNTIN' or shootin’ or GoLFIN' DoN'T You sometimes GET FEARFULLY Bon Ed 1"
Hostess (feelingly). “YEs, I Do.”
THE BISHOP'S MOVE.
[In a recent number of his Diocesan Magazine
the Bishop of WorcestER lays down a rule that
men ordained by him are “not to contract
matrimonial engagements” during their Dia-
conate. “In the event,” he adds, “of this not
being observed, I should feel it my duty to
remove the young man to another curacy, if
the lady were a resident in the district.”]
WHEN Strephon wooed, I showed im-
Inense
Reciprocal devotion,
Although, to speak without pretence,
I'd not the slightest notion
That love's unwelcome consequence
Would be perpetual motion.
As we surveyed the placid sea
It showed no warning beacon;
We clean forgot the penalty
Our Bishop vowed to wreak on
The rebel who presumed to be
Affianced while a deacon.
“The man who dares to disobey
His Bishop comes a cropper”
(His Lordship wrote); “I beg to say
Your conduct is improper.
I hope you'll choose the easier way—
Which is, of course, to drop her.
“Else you, who show me disrespect,
Must be severely dropped on ;
You'll quit your post (I fear neglect
Of duty if you stopped on)
And undertake, as I direct,
The curacy of Plopton.”
“D'you think,” I cried, while Strephon
stood
Irresolute, “I’ll swallow
Defeat like this? What hardihood
To utter threats so hollow !
You go to Plopton 2 Well and good—
Mother and I will follow !”
He went—and we went. In a week
The Bishop, who had thirsted
For vengeance, finding, so to speak,
His machinations worsted,
Bade Strephon move again, to seek
The curacy of Burstead.
From Burstead on to Newton Leas,
From Newton Leas to Keating,
Still an astonished Diocese
Beholds my lover fleeting;
But, try his lordship as he please,
He can't prevent us meeting !
Poor Bishop | By-and-by he'll gain
The sorrowful conviction
That here his threats are all in vain,
His rule an empty fiction,
And that young ladies yet remain
Beyond his jurisdiction
Mr. BonAR LAw as reported in The
Scotsman :
“Surely it was the most unreasonable of
propositions to assert that we could not have
a greator moral right to ask equality of treat-
ment on the Indian market when we gave to
them advantages in our market which were not
given to other people than we had that right
now, when we gave her no advantage which
was not enjoyed by every other country in the
world so much as it was by India. (Cheers.)”
Even Mr. LAw's bitterest opponent
could hardly have forborne to cheer so
exciting a finish.
Extract from the letter of a Baboo,
who, after much correspondence with
the postal officials over some small
grievance, at length breaks into poetry
and sums up the case against red tape
as follows:
“The bell of death is ever ring,
Over the poor and over the king.
The world is ever tit for tat,
Over the thin and over the fat."

A QUESTION OF DEGREE.
GREAT confusion having arisen in
the papers with regard to the PRESI-
DENT of THE LOCAL GoverNMENT
BoARD, some referring to him always as
Dr. BURNs, in recognition of a degree
recently conferred upon him by Liver-
pool University, and others still adher-
ing to Mr. BURNs, a public meeting
was called to decide upon some united
course of action. The Mayor of BAT-
TERSEA was in the Chair, and many
prominent journalists and public men
were present. -
Mr. BUCKLE, of The Times, said that
he was averse from conferring such
titles. . Take, for example, the case of
the head of the Salvation Army. The
Times, it is true, called him “General,”
but only between inverted ---
commas. He would admit *
that Mr. BURNs's degree º
was not, like the General's,
self-imposed. The †:

however, would continue
to call him Mr., and

Mr. JAMES BRYCE, the
British Ambassador
Washington, said that no T
one, he believed, possessed
so many honorary degrees | -
as himself; but he had |
never called himself Dr.
BRYCE, and never should, -

pied part of his leisure in

CoNSTITUTION
Journal said that he objected to the
term Doctor for any but medical men.
There should be no such thing as
Doctors of Laws or Divinity. Doctors
should mean medical practitioners or
consulting physicians. He could foresee
great confusion in Battersea if Mr.
BURNs were called Dr. BURNs. All
kinds of people who were taken ill
would be sending for him.
Dr. MACNAMARA said that he was
called Doctor because he had been
made an hon. LL.D. of St. Andrew's.
He did not know that the title had
done him any harm.
he had occasionally been asked to
prescribe, and had always done
so, his one remedy for all ills being
ipecacuanha.

IF Folks 'UD on LY KEEP THEIR EYEs open, THEY 'I see THE BLOOMIN
BUT Tii EY DON'T ;
speak of Dr. KITCHENER and Dr.
CROMER.
Mr. J. ST. Loß STRACHEY, the Editor
of The Spectator, vigorously objected
to the question being decided by a
snap vote at a local meeting. This was
clearly a “question of great gravity,”
which should only be settled finally by
resort to the Referendum. The cost
of a Referendum had been grossly
exaggerated by Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,
who said it would involve an outlay of
£2,000,000. As a matter of fact, he
(Mr. STRACHEY) had convinced himself
by a careful inquiry that it would not
cost more than £250,000. In conclu-
sion he advocated this method of de-
ciding the question for the following
reasons:– - -
(1) Because he was a democrat and
wished the will of the
people to prevail.
- (2) Because he had sup-
| ported the Referendum for
fifteen years.
(3) Because Switzer-
land, the home of the
|Referendum, possessed the
|best system of universal
service in the world.
Sir Edwin DURNING-
LAWRENCE, Bart., pointed
out that the names BURNs
and BACON both contained
the same number of letters,
and that the aggregate
equalled the number
contained in the name
SHAksPEARE. The word
honorificabilitudimitatibus
clearly referred to an
honorary degree. On all
these grounds he cordially
supported Mr. BURNs's
assumption of the title
— “Doctor.”
Mr. MARLow E, of The
Daily Mail, said that he had given
instructions for Mr. BURNs to be called
Dr. BURNs in that paper. He, the
speaker, believed that when honours
were conferred they should be recog-
nised. If the KING were to confer
the title of knighthood, or even a
peerage, on himself, he should be
careful to make his name correspond
to the compliment.
Mr. DoNALD, of The Daily Chronicle,
said that his staff still called Mr. BURNS
Mr. He had noticed that The Daily
Mail, which he occasionally saw at his
club or on the seat of a railway compart-
ment, had adopted the Dr., and he
assumed that it did so for party reasons,
hoping that it might suggest ridicule.
For him, however, Mr. BURNs would
always remain plain honest John, in
no need for honorary degrees from
anyone, least of all from the enemy.
The Editor of The British Medical
entitled Doctor for many years, but had
never been called in to attend anyone
who was physically ill. Spiritually,
yes. He would be glad to attend
spiritually, or politically, anyone pre-
sent at that meeting at a moment's
notice. He considered that the prefix
ennobled a man. He strongly advised
Mr. BURNs to be known as Doctor.
Mr. EDMUND GossE, speaking on
behalf of the Encyclopædia Britannica,
said he was strongly in favour of what
he might call the doctorial differentia-
tion. By this means only could an end
be put to the confusion which had so
long existed between the Member for
Battersea and his namesake the poet,
who could never be accused of an
honorary degree.
Lord INVERCLYDE strongly protested
against the assumption of the prefix
Doctor on the strength of an honorary
degree. At that rate they ought to
Mr. FABIAN WARE, of The Morning
Post, said that he should continue to
refer to Mr. BURNS as Mr. BURNs
whenever it was impossible to avoid
mentioning him altogether.
Mr. SIDNEY LEE said that he also
was an honorary Doctor, three deep
at least. He had no fixed rule as to
style. Sometimes he used the term,
and sometimes not. In America" he
had used it, because the Americans
liked that kind of thing. He was
often called Professor in America, but
never, so far as he could remember,
Colonel or Judge.
The Chairman then put the question
to the meeting—Shall we call our old
friend JoHN BURNs Mr. or Dr. 2 The
result was an overwhelming majority
in favour of retaining the more modest
designation, and the company dis-
persed, singing the Battersea National
Anthem.

rival should secure the only available
ribbon, persuades her uxorious
husband to flirt with the wife of
the Minister who has the disposal

tulating, carries out her wishes too
generously, and the prize is hers
at the temporary cost of conjugal
security. That's all: except that
the rival ribbon-hunter turns out
to be a man writing under a female
mom de guerre. The revelation of
his identity is the one effective
episode in the play; but very little
was made of it. This was a pity,
as there was not enough stuff to go
quite round; and it had to be eked
out with fun of a farcical order, in
which Mr. HUNTLEY figured as a
devastating Adonis, and Miss DoRIS
KEANE was extremely sinuous and
susceptible. Miss HATTIE WIL-

done better in France, and perhaps
best not done at all.

STRENGTH AT THE HELM.
As everyone now knows, there is not
a German waiter or clerk in London or
England to-day that is not an active
spy and soldier in the service of
his Fatherland, only waiting for the
moment to rise and strike. The inter-
val that occurs between the ordering of
your chop at a restaurant and its
tardy appearance is due not to any
defect in the kitchen but to allow
time for the waiter to make a full
note for the Berlin War Office as to
your appearance and probable fight-
ing weight. So again with the Ger-
man clerk who receives you in the
City. Those constant entries in his
ledger have not, as it may seem,
any reference to your business, but to
yourself. Only in this way can Ger-
many be properly forewarned, and thus
forearmed. But, as any military
authority will tell you, it is no use
having a highly efficient and numerous
band of spies in the enemy's midst
unless they are under control. Who,
then, controls the myriad German spies
in London? We are in a position to
give the answer, and to give it for the
first time. The head of this gigantic
system is probably the last man you
would suspect, for, by a masterpiece of
Teutonic subtlety, he is notoriously a
builder-up of the English frame, a
maker of muscle, an apostle of fitness.
See the devilish cunning (Teufel-Schlau-
heit) of it. It is as though a poacher
were a gamekeeper, a burglar a detec-
tive, a lawyer a gentleman. Yet it is
this man whose name is in every paper
as a renovator of the Anglo-Saxon fibre
who is at the head of the German army
secreted in our midst. In other words,
it is the famous Muskel-Brust.
Nothing is wanting but Muskel-
Brust's word of command for every
German clerk in the country to convert
his pen into a poisoned bayonet, every
German waiter to drop hyoscine into
the food, every German barber to let
loose the tetra-chloride, and England
to be a conquered nation.
The main facts of the case are of
course known to every Teutophobe, yet
never before has the truth about Mus-
kel-Brust been told. But we have not
yet revealed all. For it has come to our
knowledge that Muskel-Brust himself
is a more masterful MACHIAVELLI even
than we have indicated. We are in a
position to state that his magnificent
development is not genuine. That
huge biceps standing from his arms like
Primrose Hill, those grand muscular
protuberances on his shoulders and
thighs, are in reality receptacles for the
deadliest form of concentrated explosive.
The man is a walking magazine of
terrific menace. He can carry about
with him enough cordite tabloids to
blow up all London. Divested of his
secret cargo he is a slight and hollow-
chested man of insignificant appear-
ance, such as might do the lock-step
down Regent Street. Verb. sap.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN point of solid literature this may be a mediocre age,
but now and then it does produce a short story worthy of
the laurel; and I would like to include the name of EDITH
WHART.on among the masters of that modern art. Tales
of Men and Ghosts (MACMILLAN) are the sort of which,
however late the hour, you must just read one more before
you go to bed. If the ghosts are few and not too ghastly,
the men are divers and many and very much alive. Better
than either are the ideas, of which there is at least one,
bright and sound and neatly pointed, to each of the ten
stories. The main theme is the littérateur at the top of his
success or in the depths of his failure, the artistic tem-
perament in embryo and apotheosis. There is also some
mention of love and a case of insanity. The general atmo-
sphere is one of cleverness which is never smart, and of
irony which is always gentle. The best of the stories are
“The Letters” and
The secret (if you care to know)
Which Mr. GARVICE has in keeping
Is that he has the sense to sow
Where there's the greatest chance of reaping;
He caters, so to say, for those
Who like a plot, not over gory,
Dressed up in unassuming prose—
In short, a plain straightforward story.
In such he does a roaring trade
Which one I've read from start to finish–
The Heart, he calls it, of a Maid
(Hodder AND SToughton)—won't diminish:
Candour and cunning, love and cash,
Fight the old fight for top-dog places,
With no confusing balderdash
Of literary arts and graces.
I dare say you think now that a book all about a
little girl at boarding-school is not likely to be particularly
interesting to the
“The Legend.” In
the latter Mrs. Bain
entertains the Ar-
tistically Superior

sion of the latest

here is an incident'
of real life not very efficiently reported. You have no
doubt that Mark Rennard, of the Indian Civil, existed
in the flesh. You do not suspect that his being jilted
by an English miss and married, in the off moments
following, by a half-caste widow, of beautiful exterior but
vulgar origin, is all make-believe. Accepting these as facts
of life, you are pleasantly curious to see what happens when
he has to go through with his folly under the gaze of the

you could find out from the people concerned what they
felt about it, instead of having to take Miss ALICE PERRIN's
account. If you are an inquisitive person you may even be
tempted to go to Koranabad to enquire how it all ended, for
you are by no means definitely informed; or, failing that
journey, you may ask at Scotland Yard if anything has
been heard of Mark's stepson, Alaric, alias Junksie, a child
of marked and mischievous promise, who ran away to
England halfway through the book and was not referred to
again. Certainly, if you begin the story you will finish it,
partly in the vain hope of finding out who the pretty lady
on the cover may be, more because you will be interested
in a remarkable, if melancholy, affair.

for the story itself I have no words but those of sincert
admiration. The study it gives of the development of *
single character is really amazingly clever. Laura's co"
panions, too, are all made to live; indeed, though I wº
never myself an inmate of a girls' school, I feel cert”
that life there must be precisely what the book describes
it. Needless to say, Laura has little in common with the
virtuous protagonists of the school stories of an earlie
generation. The wisdom she gets is not all of it what
would be called desirable; and the various stages of her
progress are shown with a realism that is wholly modern.
This it is, of course, that makes the history so absorbing.
Laura is, and remains to the end, an entirely hu"
creation; the fact that, at a crisis in her career she is
allowed to cheat flagrantly, and is neither found out "
remorseful, completed my admiration for her historian.

[DECEMBER 14, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“SALOME.”
A DREss REHEARSAL.
A YELLow moon, reeking with
presage, looked down upon the terrace
of the Tetrarch. Beyond the Syrian
landscape, the smoke of what I took
to be passing trains drifted across
an immovable cloud-wrack. Through
the palace - entrances shone three
great parallelograms of red light, like
the slabs of colour you see on a poll-
screen when a Conservative victory
is about to be recorded. On the terrace
stood a well-head, a familiar do-
mestic feature which used to give
tone and character to the tetrarchal
terraces of those days. A young cap-
tain discussed the situation with the
page of Herodias (contralto). Every-
body was in the full dress of the period.
Suddenly there came a pause, and
the voice of the conductor (in short
sleeves) rang out. “Where is the Pro-
phet?” he cried in bell-like tones.
And the answer, as in the case of
DE QUINCEY's reporter, was “Non est
inventus.” The stage-manager rushed
on and peered down the well. The
soldiers joined him in the search. It
flashed upon me as just possible that
Truth, having fled to the bottom of the
well during these Elections (I can't get
the silly things out of my head), had left
no room for the Prophet. But I was in
error, for after a dreadful delay he was
reported to have arrived—by one of
those lower entrances which habitually
occur in Syrian wells—and to have
sent up word that he couldn't see to
read his score, the lighting arrange-
ments at the bottom of a well being
almost always inadequate. Meanwhile
the curtain was dropped, and eventually
we began all over again; and once
more, at the same point, there was the
same hitch, and once more the voice of
Mr. BEECHAM rang out, “Where is the
Prophet?” At last the notes of Mr.
WHITEHILL's magnificent organ came
filtering up, and the great tragedy
moved forward.
Our next shock was when the lithe
figure of Salome ran on from the halls
of festivity in a white blouse and dark
skirt, looking extraordinarily occi-
dental, and quite different from the
Salome of the preliminary boom-photo-
graphs. No doubt the local colour
was to be there all right on the night,
but this afternoon she was saving her-
self and giving nothing away. As for
her voice, she opened her mouth at the
proper places, but made no attempt—
and I don't blame her—to compete with
the noisy cacophonies of the orchestra.
Hearing Mr. WHITEHILL's voice com-
ing from the cistern, she thought she
would like to make his closer ac-
quaintance, and ordered him to be
brought up. Greatly attracted by his
appearance, she insisted upon kissing
him. Mr. WHITEHILL, however, very
properly resisted her advances, and
after a while withdrew back into the
cistern; but not till the young captain,
in a spasm of jealousy, had killed him-
self—an episode in which neither Salome
nor the Prophet took the faintest inte-
rest.
Presently Herod emerged in a pea-
jacket and trousers to match, accom-
panied by Herodias in ordinary after-
noon dress, but without a hat. The
Tetrarch was in a fractious mood,
and barked out his words like a German
officer on early-morning parade. His
temper was not improved by the corpse
of the captain, into whose blood he had
put his foot through an oversight. It
seems that the Tetrarch never cared
greatly for the sight of dead men unless
he had had a hand in their killing. As
the First Soldier, in the original text,
had previously remarked, knowing his
Herod: “Il faut faire transporter le
cadavre. Le tetrarque m'aime pas re-
garder les cadavres, sauf les cadavres
de ceux qu'il a tués lui - méme.” To
which the Second Soldier, knowing his
OLLENDoRFF, had replied: “Vous avez
raison; il faut cacher le cadavre. Il
me faut pas que le tétrarque le voie.”
Another source of annoyance to the
fretful potentate was the way in which
a lot of Hebrew sceptics would keep
on talking to him all at once about the
Prophet. Mr. BEECHAM didn't like it
either, and stopped to tell them that
they must pay attention to the beat;
this, in fact, being what the beat was
there for. So they tried again, and I
believe that this time they did what
he wanted, though I confess that I
noticed no difference, so terrible was
the mélée of jarring sounds.
Nothing, in the end, would content
Herod but that Salome should dance
before him ; but she was pensive and
not feeling at her best, and frankly
hinted that she would prefer to keep
still. However, a very large bribe
induced her to do the Seven-Veils dance.
Seven veils take some time to arrange,
and the orchestra seized their advan-
tage. Then Salome, who was a little
hampered by some of the supers, and
let them know it, went through a few
easy motions, dropping her veils from
time to time all round the place, and
strolling and lounging about in between,
till the music caught her up. The
Tetrarch seemed more satisfied with the
performance than I was, and it was a
bad set-back for him when he found
out what he was expected to pay for
it. But Herod was a man of his word,
and so a Nubian butcher, carrying a
large carving-knife at the salute, was
introduced into the cistern.
During the awful interval that en-
sued the orchestra let itself go. There
was one sound, painfully iterated, like
the chirrup of a sick hen, which, I
think, came from some part of a violin
which is usually left alone. From my
vantage in the stage box I had already
been intrigued by a sort of toy har-
monium, from which an acrobat was
extracting notes which had never yet
come within my experience of instru-
mental music. Something between the
click of muted bones and the smacking
of fat cheeks.
And now from the cistern emerged
the butcher's knife with a great blotch
of red paint smeared along the blade.
Salome seized and bore it aloft in
triumph; then, advancing to the foot-
lights, she complained to Mr. BEECHAM
that this would never do; it made her
fingers messy, and she quite wanted to
keep them clean. At this trying
moment a happy diversion was created
by the appearance of an official with
the glad news (so I gathered) that Mr.
REDFord had consented to the use of a
dish for the red paint. Or it may have
been that the thing had just arrived
from the dish-monger's. Anyhow, Mr.
BEECHAM and Salome were visibly
affected by the announcement, and the
latter wiped her soiled fingers first on a
piece of property and then on a spare
part of the robe of a super.
Back we went for a page or two, and
this time it was a pewter dish that was
handed up from the well—clearly a
great assistance to the imagination.
So Salome carried it to the front, and
put it on the floor and lavished en-
dearments on the head that wasn't
there.
And all might have ended happily
and smoothly with Herod's order to his
soldiers (he was now in a thoroughly
bad mood) to put her to death, if only the
military hadn't been mobilised a shade
too soon. “What in the name of —
are you doing 2 ” said Mr. BEECHAM :
“I’m not half through the opera yet!”
An overstatement, if pardonable; for
Salome had only a few more bars in
hand. These she now negotiated, and
the impatient soldiery was then free to
despatch her beneath their bucklers.
For those who propose to criticise
this opera, no vocabulary could be too
large or peculiar. I content myself
with complimenting Mr. BEECHAM on
the prodigies he performed with the
bâton, and I gratefully hope that he
will soon ask me to another dress
rehearsal of an opera: one, for choice,
in which Messrs. STRAUSs and CENSOR
shall have again collaborated.

THE POETRY OF MOTION.—LATEST
DEVELOPMENT : THE JUDY-WALK.
THE MASTIX.
[An attempt to preserve some record of the horror of the scene when
“Mastix,” a contributor to The Daily Chronicle, penned in the Radical
interest certain open letters in the manner of “JUNIU's" to Unionist:
statesmen who had the misfortune to incur his special displeasure.]
DEEP in a den whose outlet yawned betwixt two upas-trees,
Festooned with snakes and vampire bats and horrible things
like these—
Deep in a dark and awesome den where a cockatrice had died,
Slain by the glance of a basilisk who envied his place
inside—
Deep in a stifling sulphurous den, heavy with poisoned air,
Sitting on eighteenth-century eggs—the Mastix had his lair!
Ah, how the foam flew forth his lips, what dragon teeth he
gnashed,
What antediluvian odours rose from every egg he smashed!
With a passion for rage inherited from the cockatrice de-
ceased,
And a glare in the eye as full of bane as a basilisk's at least,
With a cry that had half of a hydra's hiss and all of a
griffin's roar,
And the pounce of a militant suffragette—the Mastix took
the floor
A spasm tore the universe, a shudder shook the vast,
The ghost of Swift was seen to walk and JUNIUs rose
aghast.
Louder, more shrill, the scolding shriek to topmost heaven
scaled,
Whilst Peers held on their coronets and politicians paled,
Till all the horrid tale was told, the criminals attainted—
The people staggered to the polls—and then the Mastix
fainted
HENRY SILVER.
MANY of Mr. Punch's oldest friends will share his pro-
found regret at the loss of a veteran member of his staff,
HENRY SILVER, who died on the 3rd of December, at the
age of eighty-two. His first contribution to the paper was
made in 1848, and he joined the Table in 1857, retiring in
1870 on the death of MARK LEMON. His contributions,
which were both in prose and verse, included “Punch's
History of Costume,” illustrated by John TENNIEL. Among
his closest friends was CHARLEs KEENE, whose earliest
drawings for Punch were of his devising, the first of these
being published in 1851. HENRY SILVER was the happy
possessor of a fine collection of KEENE's original work.
According to The Daily Mail a dairy manager explains
the shortage in milk thus:
‘One of the reasons was the hard weather of last month, and
another is the high price of beer."
How ignorant we laymen are—the second reason would
never have occurred to us.
“Clemency preferred not to think so; but Tring's criticism was apt
enough ; she had a boyish look, despite the broad-brimmed, fashionable
hat. The slim figure, the firm, olive column of the throat rising from
the plain silk skirt she wore, were essentially boyish.”—Daily Mirror.
She was wrong. High waists are no longer fashionable.
“The only way is to grow the plants on yourself from
cuttings. This will take a few years,” says Gardening
Illustrated in reply to a correspondent. If this is the
Japanese gardening, it would account for the chrysan-
themum in the Geisha's hair.

produce any sound but a mild “Whoo !'
from my natural one, a taxi will go
by with the flag up, but the driver
looking the other way with all the
intent earnestness of a statue.”
! “That reminds me,” said another
speaker. “What do you do when a
driver with his flag up sees you and
takes no notice? It's the most infu-
riating thing in the world. I don't
|know whether it has ever happened to
any of you?” - -
“It happens to me,” said the first
jman, “every day. I am accurst. And
another thing—when I am at haste in
a taxi it is always the first vehicle that
the policeman stops at a crossing. I
head the block. There I sit, no matter
what hurry I am in, and watch the
meter mounting. It always happens at
Wellington Street. Next time you pass
there and see the block in the Strand
flook in the first taxi and you'll find me.
“And finally—to get rid of the taxi
indictment—when the time comes to
pay the fare I can never get any change
out of the brutes. They keep their
money, to begin with, in some place
'compared with which a woman's pocket
is the height of accessibility; and then
they never have anything there but
gold and half-crowns when they find
it. So I am always parting with four-
ºpences and sixpences when all I want
to give extra is twopence.
“I tell you fellows honestly I long
for the dear old days, when cab-horses
crawled or fell down, and cab-drivers
called you foul names, and you didn't
know the worst till you got out. Life
was worth living then. - -
“The Tubes too,” he continued, “how
one's bad luck has been aggravated by
that draughty invention! When I go
by Tube the lift-man always bangs the
gate while I am getting my ticket, and
; when at last I reach the platform it is
just in time to see the tail light of
ithe train disappearing. Some day the
controllers of the Tube (if there are any)
will try to arrange a correspondence
between lifts and trains. The new
isystem will probably be inaugurated on
the day of my funeral. My funeral—
O happy thought!"
“Apparently,” said another speaker,
“your bad luck is associated wholly
with what are humorously called
London's increased traffic facilities.”
“Not at all !” said the unlucky
man. “I merely mentioned those first
because they are just now the most
conspicuous element in the scheme of
frustration called my life. I am un-
flucky in grain. If I go to a picture

in it, it has the section from pages 97
to 144 missing. If I send to the
library a list of four books that I want,
they return four books that I don't
want. If I am invited to a house
where really good dinners are served, I
am bound to have indigestion all that
day. If I dine at a restaurant, the
only bottle of wine that is corked
wanders to my table, and I am the
only guest to whom the manager is not
amenable under remonstrance. If you
ever meet a carefully-dressed man on
his way to a lunch party with a spot
of mud on his collar, it is me.”
“But these things can happen to
all of us,” said another man.
“Yes,” said the grumbler, “but with
me there are no exceptions. Some of
you occasionally attend a matinée and
see something. I attend matinées and
find myself always behind the largest
hat—always. When I buy evening
seats they either have a pillar right in
front of them or the particular man I
wanted to see is ill or away on a holiday.
“No,” he concluded. “I am un-
lucky. You are unwise to be in my
company. It's catching—bad luck is
—I'm certain of it. No shrewd man
ever has dealings with an unlucky one."

“I shall have to think that over by
myself,” I said after a pause. “There's
a lot in that which the untrained ob-
server might miss. Anyhow, it's not
at all the sort of thing that a young
girl ought to say at a dance.”
“I'm older than you think,” said
Miss Middleton. “Oh, bother, I forgot.
You know how old I am.”
“Perhaps you've been ageing lately.
I have. This election has added years
to my life. I came here to get young
| again.”
“I don't know anything about poli-
tics. Father does all the knowing in
our family.”
“He’s on the right side, isn't he?”
“I think he is. He says he is.”
“Oh, well, he ought to know . . .
Yes, the truth is I came here to be
liked again. People and I have been
saying awfully rude things to each
other lately.”
“Oh, why do you want to argue
about politics?”
“But I don't want to. It's a funny
thing, but nobody will believe me when
I say that.”
“I expect it's because you say it
after you've finished arguing, instead
of before.”
“Perhaps that's it.”
“I never argue with mother. I
simply tell her to do something, and
she tells me afterwards why she hasn't.”
“Really, I think Mrs. Middleton has
done wonderfully well, considering.
Some parents don't even tell you why
they haven't.”
“Oh, I'd recommend her any-
where,” said Miss Middleton confi-
dently.
We dropped into silence again.
Anyhow, it was my favourite waltz.
“You did say, didn't you, the first
dance we had together,” said Miss Mid-
dleton dreamily, “that you preferred
not to talk when you danced 2"
“Didn't I say that I should prefer
to do whatever you preferred 2 That
sounds more like me.”
“I don't think it does, a bit.”
“No, perhaps you're right. Besides,
I remember now what I did say. I
said that much as I enjoyed the
pleasant give and take of friendly con-
versation, dearly as I loved even the
irresponsible monologue or the biting
repartee, yet still more was I attached
to the silent worship of the valse's
mazy rhythm. “But,' I went on to say,
“but,' I added, with surprising origi- |
nality, “every rule has an exception.
You are the exception. May I have
two dances, and then we'll try one of
each 2 '''
“What did I say?”
“You said, 'Sir, something tells me
that we shall be great friends. I like
your face, and I like the way your tie
goes under your left ear. I cannot
give you all the dances on the pro-
gramme, because I have my mother
with me to-night, and you know what
mothers are. They notice. But any-
thing up to half-a-dozen, distributed at
such intervals that one's guardians will
think it's the same dance, you are
heartily welcome to. And if you care
to take me in to supper, there is—I
have the information straight from the
stable—a line in unbreakable meringues
which would well be worth our atten-
tion.' That's what you said.”
“But what a memory !”
“I can remember more than that.
I can remember the actual struggle.
I got my meringue down on the mat,
both shoulders touching, in one minute
forty-three seconds.” -
The band died slowly down until no
sound could be heard above the rustle
of frocks and suddenly every-
body realised that it had stopped.
“Bother,” said Miss Middleton.
“That's just like a band,” I said
bitterly.
“I’ll tell it to go on again; it's my
band.”
“It will be your devoted band if you
ask it prettily enough.”
Miss Middleton went away, and came
back to the sound of music, looking
rather pleased with herself.
“Did you give him the famous
smile 2 " I asked. “Yes, that one.”
“I said, ‘Would you mind playing
that one again, please ?' And then
“And then you looked as if you were
just going to cry, and at the last
moment you smiled and said, ‘Hooray.’
And he said, “Certainly, madam.’ Isn't
that right?”
“I believe you're cleverer than some
of us think,” said Miss Middleton a
trifle anxiously.
“I sometimes think so too. How-
ever, to get back to what we were
saying—I came here to recover my
usual calm, and I shan’t be at all calm
if I'm only going to get this one dance
from you. As an old friend of the
family, who has broken most of the
windows, I beg for another.”
“To get back to what I was saying
—I've simply got to do a lot of duty
dances. Can't you take me to the
Zoo or the Post-Impressionists
instead 2" -
“I’d rather do both.
three. No, I mean both.”
“Well, perhaps I would, too.”
“You know, I think you'd be doing
good. I've had a horrible week—can-
vassing, and standing in the streets,
and shouting, and reading leaders, and
arguing, and saying, ‘My point is per-
fectly simple,’ and—and—swearing,
and all sorts of things. It's awfully
jolly to—to feel that there's always–
well, all this,” and I looked round the
room, “to come back to.”
“Isn't that beautiful Miss Ellison
I introduced you to just now part of
“all this ’2 ”
“Oh, yes, it's all part; but—"
Miss Middleton sighed. -
“Then that nice young man with
the bald head will have to go without.
But I only said I'd see if I could give
him one. And I have seen, haven't I?"
The band really stopped this time,
and we found a comfortable corner.
“That's very jolly of you,” I said, as
I leant back lazily and happily. “Now
let's talk about Christmas.”

Owing to the prevailing floods no
voters appeared at Slushington, and the

At Azuregore a member of the idle

three footmen.
A great saving in pencils has been

LONDON CHARIVARI. 427
PUNCH, OR THE
RUY LOPEZ.
THERE were no almonds this year
on the almond tree over the way;
a great sorrow, if I picture the man
rightly, to the owner of the tree, an
incalculable benefit to the morals of
the district, and a spring of gentle
meditation to my landlady and myself.
Last year there was a fine crop, and
except during their hours of enforced
idleness in the schoolroom, the children
of the neighbourhood were busy with
them all day long. Infants who were
not old enough to hurl books and
brickbats and errand-baskets up into
the boughs were brought by their elders
to be shown what they might do in
time if they were good. It used to be
quite dangerous to walk on that side
of the road when the girls were holding
target practice with their arithmetics.
The proprietor of the tree made very
little effort to stop the looting, and I
think on the whole he rather liked it.
You see, the very possession of this
rarity marked him out as a man above
his neighbours on either side, who ran
to nothing better than a mere elder-
bush and a small horse chestnut ; it
gave him a kind of Byronic personality,
something of the glamour of the South;
and this constant pillaging only called
attention to it. At any rate, it was a
long time before he had the fruit picked,
and even that was a sort of simple
pageant in its way. The man-of-all-
work propped a ladder against the
trunk and went up it. Every five
minutes or so he would strike a branch
and knock down two or three of the
fruit, and then wait until a friend came
along. “Hullo! what you got there?”
the latter would say. “Wornuts?”
“Hammonds,” he would reply, expec-
torating with a sort of quiet dignity.
But for my landlady and me the
emotions stirred by this piece of vege-
tation were neither those of pride nor
gluttony, but the pleasures of a rumi-
native philosophy. It was our third
conversational gambit. That is why
(perhaps you wondered when I was
going to get to my title)—that is why
I have christened it Ruy Lopez; that
and a deference for its romantic
Southern origin.
For a long time the only two topics
which aroused a responsive thrill in
my landlady's heart when she brought
in the breakfast were the weather and
the latest tragedy or crime. Then one
morning I happened to mention the
almond tree, and in a moment I knew
that we had yet another enthusiasm in
common. The fact that the blossom
of this species arrives before its leaves,
the mystery of its exotic birth-place,
the size and colour of the fruit, the

ravages of the wind on its foliage,
evoked numberless profound and useful

Mind you, I never overdid it; but
when things had been very dull and
gloomy I would say to myself on
going to bed, “To-morrow shall be an
almond-tree morning,” and I woke up
with a sort of glow of pleasurable
excitement; and though it is now
winter and the leaves are gone, we still
remark from time to time on the
strange absence of fruitage this year
as contrasted with last, and remind
each other that the road was not nearly
so merry without the children. But I

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
A NEW MOVEMENT—THE LATEST CURE.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--I've started a
Movement 1 In these horrible times
of alarms and excursions and strikes
and elections and class hatreds and
all that sort of thing, I consider it the
duty of mous autres to try to bring all,
classes together, and do away with
bitterness, you know, and make those
poor, dear things see that we mean
kindly towards them and want to
soften their lots, and everything of
that kind. So I've founded the Smiling
League, and I believe it will have im-
mense results, and will do more towards
settling the country than any number
of Conferences or similar nonsensical
sweet enough to say it was immensely
well done. I was voted absolutely It
as an old-fashioned bisque doll, with
little dumpy curls all round my head,
a bunchy gauze skirt looped up with
roses, white stockings and bronze
boots. Babs, being literary, came as
a doll-penwiper, with a crinoline and
ever so many different-coloured gra-
duated skirts. Some of the other good
ones were Bosh and Wee-Wee as the
man and woman out of an old toy
farm (Wee-Wee's wooden figure and
skirt awfully well done!); Popsy, Lady
Ramsgate, as a Lord Fauntleroy boy-
doll; Beryl Clarges as a Dutch ditto,
and Norty as a golliwog. We kept up
the characters of dolls, winding each
other up, squeaking, and saying Pa-pa
and Ma-ma, and so on, and altogether
the fourth, on your back again, and so
you go on till you can dispose of twenty
or thirty of these eggs a day. The
result is that, if you're old, you grow
young; if you're young you never
grow old; and the complexion gets a
bloom, and the eyes a soft brightness
that only eggs with a long, long past
can give. There's just one little thing
that you must be careful about. You
must make every effort to banish
entirely the expression of face you had
while eating the eggs. For, of course,
it's not of much use having blooming
cheeks and bright eyes if, at the same
time, you've an expression of disgust

is what's happened to Beryl Clarges.

ANOTHER gain “for the Peers ” had
been shown on the screen, and the
young man with the mild and pro-
minent eyes lifted up his voice and
cheered, as if he represented in his own
commonplace person the last reserve
of England's chivalry.
“'Ray, 'Ra-ay, 'Ra-a-ay!” he shouted,
with the reckless abandon of one who
has put it to the touch to win or lose
everything in a last hot contest with
the growing forces of a new era.
A cross person, wedged at his elbow,
turned to him with a scowl, and said,
“What price Peckham 2"
The young man gave a quick, un-
interested glance at the speaker, settled
his head more comfortably into his
collar, and gazed up at the illuminated
screen again, his face radiant with a
happy expectancy.
It was a win “for the People” this
time.
Instantly his voice rose high, as if
he saw already with the Seer's pro-
phetic eye the passing of the dark
shadow of feudal tyranny and the
dawn of a glorious age of freedom at
last.
“'Ray, 'Ra-a-a-y!" he yelled—a long,
lingering cry of triumph, in which was
the making of many headaches.
“Enjoying yerself, ain't you?” said
the rude person in front of him, with
some asperity. “Wot you cheer 'em
both for 2 . Can't you keep to your own
side and give us a chance?”
“That's all right,” replied the young
man contentedly, “it’s quite all right

know what anybody's at. So I cheer
'em all, and get twice as much shoutin'
as ever I did before. Jolliest election

Again the magic-lantern spoke.
“Hi! Yi! Yoil 'Ra-a-ay!" he
bawled ecstatically; and I edged away
to the extreme limit of his sphere of
influence.
But I was glad to have seen him in
all his simple greatness—the one man
who had managed to extract content-
ment unalloyed out of the election
results of December 1910.

WORD FOR WORD.
Ertract from “The Ploughchester Advertiser,” December 3,
1910–A very successful meeting was brought to a close
by Mr. James Harbutt, C.C., who in his usual stirring
fashion proposed a vote of thanks to the Chairman. Mr.
Harbutt's reception showed that his great popularity has
been in no way impaired by the unfair attacks which have
been made upon him in connection with the Dilbury Gas-
works scheme.
From Mr. James Harbutt to the Editor of “The Plough-
chester Advertiser,” December 3, 1910. (Not for publi-
cation. -
SIR,--I think I have some rights to complain of the
manner in which my speeches are reported in your paper.
For instance, to-day you print the speeches of Mr. Burn-
castle and Captain Pilditch all but in full, but you don't
give a word of mine, which was the same length, and my
friends assure me it was quite as important. There must
be something behind this, but what it is I can't make out.
If my speech had been fairly reported I was ready to take
one hundred copies for distribution to my friends so as to
help the Cause. I shall be much obliged if you will see to
this, for if it is left as it is it cannot help your paper.
Yours fly, JAMES HARBUTT.
From the Editor of “The Ploughchester Advertiser” to
Mr. James Harbutt, December 5, 1910.
DEAR SIR,
Yours of December 3.
I regret to find that you are not satisfied with the
manner in which your speeches have been reported in the
columns of this paper. I might perhaps urge that con-
siderations of space do not always make it easy to give as
full a report of speeches as I should like. I have, how-
ever, issued instructions which will, I trust, make a repe-
tition of your complaint unnecessary. As you are billed to
speak at the Barlington Town Hall on Wednesday, may we
have the pleasure of booking your order for one hundred
copies? Faithfully yours,
HENRY SLIMMINGTON, Editor.
From Mr. James Harbutt to the Editor of “The Plough-
chester Advertiser,” December 6, 1910.
DEAR SIR,-Your letter is what I should have expected
from one in your position. Kindly arrange for one
hundred copies of next Saturday's Advertiser to be sent
direct from the office as per list of addresses enclosed
herewith. I also enclose P.O. for the required amount
including postages. Yrs fly, JAMES HARBUTT.
Extract from “The Ploughchester Advertiser,”
December 10, 1910.
The proceedings were brought to a close by a vote of

on (A Voice: “The gas.” Loud and long-continued laughter,
in the midst of which Mr. Harbutt was understood to more
the vote of thanks).
The audience then sang the National Anthem, all stand-
ing, and a very successful meeting ended at five minutes
before ten.
TO A DECEMBER GROUSE.
(Heard from the Smoking-room.)
NAY, is it now you'd have me take the hill,
Voice from the snow line, far away and mocking?
In August, well, you might have roused a thrill,
But now, when sleet showers drive and pines are rocking
In the keen north-east wind,
I find
The cheery hearth and a dry boot and stocking
More to my mind
Than the wet mountain and your wild cok-coking!
In August, yes, 'twas doubtless vastly well,
When butterflies and bees and guns together
Made holiday in dingle and in dell,
To seek you 'mid a charm of sky and weather,
With a fair interlude
For food,
In sunshine that could tan one's cheeks to leather,
Before I strewed
Again your youthful kind upon the heatherl
I know the game to-day—the snow, the blast
bowſ which the swinging packs will whirr and whizz
ard, - -
I'd hear your ramping pinions whistle past, -
And—I should miss you, nipped of nose and gizzard,
And drain the futile dram,
And dam
The braes, the bleakness, and the brutal blizzard,
For oh, I am
A chilly thing and “meagre as a lizard ”
I come not at your challenge, haughty bird
Let the more earnest and the harder bitten,
If they should choose to make themselves absurd,
Compass your end in mackintosh and mitten;
I find my sole desire
The fire,
And this great padded chair which now I sit on,
Nor shall I tire
Of pipes and papers and the Persian kitten l
We have often wished to take up musical criticism.
Literary criticism is a dull thing, for one can never really
let oneself go; but in the life of every musical critic there
come times when his art demands from him such things as
this:
“He cared not a jot for his audience, except that he valued the re-
sponsiveness he fetched out of them to himself to deepen and heighten
the heights and depths which he wanted to reach up and get down to.
Or, if the note of criticism must be sounded too, this:
“His solos were memorised, but not with that success which will
doubtless come in after years. If some phrases were omitted and others
somewhat mixed, we have no cause for surprise—they were due to the
impossibility of memory carrying too much at the stage of its develop.

To The Bury Times our compliments.

MISSING NUMBERS.
WHAT I want to know is—why do
not some of my favourite publications
issue Christmas numbers?
There's The Quarterly Review, for
instance. Same old cover every year,
and not even a verse or two by GEORGE
R. SIMs to introduce a touch of the
festive season. Where's its enter-
prise? Why shouldn't the autumn
number have a nice Christmassy
picture cover (a masked man with a
reddened dagger, or something of that
kind), and include an illustration or
two, such as Miss ZENA DARE, a group
of Waits with a howling dog in the
snow, and a Mother's Darling or His
First Trousers—something that the
children can understand and really
love. Add a complete novel by the
authoress of Her Massive Trans-
gression, arfd 32 pages of special
advertisements; then double the price
to 12s. net—and what more could
anybody want?
Then there's that old favourite, the
A.B.C., or Alphabetical Railway Guide.
It has never given a single coloured
plate away within my memory. Always
with the same yellow cover and full of
dull, uninteresting figures. Why
doesn't it issue its December number
at the beginning of November, like the
up-to-date monthlies, have it in the
shape of the outline of a railway
engine, and charge a shilling for it?
The proprietors would sell thousands
more if they brightened it up a bit.
Why not a competition, offering prizes
of ten shillings and five shillings to
the two readers who first discovered
mistakes in the information given
regarding fast trains to the North and
to the West Country? Or a real
guard's whistle to the child who was
first to send in the exact total, in
centuries, years, months, weeks, days,
hours and minutes, of all the times
mentioned in the book. It lacks vim,
you know.
And The Lancet—I am so fond of
The Lancet; but it never attempts to
meet the Christmas demand. Of
course I know that it has said that
Christmas fare is the most digestible
that can be eaten. But such a state-
ment is very inadequate at Christmas
time. Has not the time arrived when
it might give us coloured illustrations
to a popular article on the symptoms
and disorders of a healthy person who
by choice or in mistake has a chop, a
piece of cheese, and a cup of coffee for
his Christmas dinner ?

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I wonDER if the persons who illustrate popular novels
fully realise their responsibility. Here, for example, on the
cover of The Golden Silence (METHUEN) the artist would
have me believe that the heroine of C. N. and A. M.
WILLIAMSON's fascinating story was a plump flapper of a
type which, though it might possibly appeal to others, I
should myself find detestable. Fortunately, however, I
drew my idea of Victoria from the inside of the book, not
the outside; and I am ready to confess that I fell in love
with her before our friendship was more than a few pages
old. The scene of The Golden Silence is North Africa,
whither Victoria had come on a romantic quest after her
long-lost sister, who, years before, had married a native
and disappeared. Being the heroine of the tale, Victoria
naturally meets Stephen Knight, the hero, on the voyage
out. Less to be expected is her rather improbable conduct
in trusting herself to the guidance of a strange Arab chief,
who takes her (with I- -
Stephen Knight in
pursuit) many weeks'
journey into the de-
sert. Eventually
Saidee, the missing
one, is discovered,
but only as the centre
of a mystery, which
I shall not spoil your
pleasure by indicat-
ing, except to say
that her rescue is
a work of difficulty
and danger. At this
point, indeed, the
story, hitherto lei-
surely, works up to
some quite breath-
less chapters; but
| so tame that I regretted not having lingered over the
exciting parts.
A school story by the author of Godfrey Martin is some-
thing to look forward to each year. CHARLEs TURLEy's
latest book, A Scout's Son (NELSON), shows all those
qualities which have given him his special position in the
regard of boys and parents. Chief of these qualities is a
gift for characterisation which many workers in this field
are content to do without. Trumper, the Scout's son, is, I
think, a new figure in school-boy fiction. Born at Mafe-
king, and spending his early years in the wild places of
the world, he enters Rossborough at fourteen to find the
world of public school life something entirely mystify.
ing. For Beckenham major — a hero of the Eleven and
Fifteen, worshipped by the small boys — he feels not
the slightest reverence. The thought of this great man
(who is also Head of the House and a few other things
as well) inspires him with no fear; indeed, he openly
criticises him in (horrors') an American slang which
Rossborough does not use.
How he settles down gradu-
- ally into the school
ways, learning much
from his new friends
and in return open-
ing their eyes to
much which they
had formerly taken
for granted, is told
by Mr. TURLEY with
his accustomed ease
and humour. A
Scout's Son is a good
deal more than the
mere “gift-book"
which its cover pro-
claims it, and the
grown-up is there:
fore strongly advised
not to present it to
his boy without first

Stephen, who began the adventure engaged to someone
else; but this, like the love affairs of Mr. Toots, is “of no
consequence really,” and didn't worry me in the least, once
Victoria and he were restored to civilisation. An excellent
and almost motor-less tale, upon which I tender to C. N.
and A. M. my sincere congratulations.
Mr. C. J. CUTCLIFFE HYNE does not seem to me to have
made the most of his idea in Empire of the World (EveRETT).
He conceives an inventor who discovers a mysterious ray
which can annihilate iron. Whether the iron be in a
Dreadnought, or an Atlantic cable, or a printing press,
when once the ray is directed at it, from no matter what
distance, it slowly dissolves into nothing. Empire of the
world is an adequate description of what is within the reach
of the possessor of such a power; but Mr. HYNE's man,
while terrorising Germany as the anonymous proprietor,
can get nothing better for himself in his own name than a
job as fitter in an electrical tramway workshop. He does
in the end float a mine in Mexico and marry an heiress,
but the ray does not help him in either. The book is
interesting to read, and I wanted to get to the end
to see what happened, but when I was there it was
books which he
buys for himself and would not allow his boy to read.
My chief impression after reading Miss RHoDA BROUGH:
ToN's The Devil and the Deep Sea (MACMILLAN) is one of
regret that so much cleverness should be wasted upon such
unsatisfactory people. John Green or Bill Street or Tom
Rutland left Eton, Christ Church, and a “three-storey high
window” precipitately, and his last precipitation was so
abrupt that he took to a chaise longue and the Riviera.
There, as an interesting invalid, he lied wildly to Miss F.ield,
who also had “a screw loose.” If I am to read of a liar I
confess to a hope that he should lie well, but not even
this merit pleads in his favour, and I cannot imagine how
Miss Field could expect to be happy with him. It is true
that her father had appropriated trust-money, but that
does not seem a sufficient reason for marrying a confirmed
scamp. But perhaps she did not stick to him, for the book
ends by asking, “Did she, or did she not ?” For my own
part I was so little interested in both her actions and inten:
tions that I was even grateful for the incessant sincerity of
a vulgar girl from Australia. I must not, however, forget
that the book contains an excellent portrait of a prig, and
is written in the style we expect from its author.

THE FIVE HUNDRED.
[Five hundred individuals so impervious to ridicule that they would
accept a Peerage under a contract to vote for the immediate destruction
of the House of Peers (“Cut it down ; why cumber ºth it the ground . "
as Mr. BARNEs says) are yet to be found. Mr. GEORGE, however, has
been telling Romford that he can find them easily.]
UP stood the General, spur on heel,
And called for volunteers,
Five hundred men with hearts of steel
To pulverise the Peers;–
Men in whose orbs the light of death,
Of setting suns, superbly pink, shone ;
Ready with their ensuing breath
To undertake their own extinction.
“Now who will charge with thundering hoof
In one concerted rush,
And occupy from floor to roo
Yon shrine of gilded plush 2
And once inside—no quarter shown,
No time for parley, not a minute—
Using your weight (6,000 stone)
Bring down the House and all that's in it?
“A bloody end, I won't deny,
Yet not without reward;
Who volunteers to do (and die),
I'll have him made a lord;
His honoured corpse within the tomb
Shall wear its crown and robe of ermine,
If he contrive the common doom,
And perish with the other vermin.
“God for the People! Who will go
And try this simple cert 2
Who for the Cause will strike a blow,
And doesn't mind the dirt 2
Speak out—not all at once but speak!
Speak on the nail, I say, or never !”—
But from the stalwarts, tough as teak,
There issued no response whatever!
But murmurs rose of “Pish l’’ and “Tut!”
And even stronger terms;
“We may,” they said, “be thickish, but
Not quite such pachyderms
High courage through our bosom thrills,
But for our sons' sakes, coming after,
We fear the ridicule that kills,
We fear a nation's countless laughter!”
Then sent the Chieftain forth with bribes
To see if he could raise
Men for his need from out the tribes
That tramp the hedgerow ways;
But Weary Willie, with a jest
Of which I won't repeat the rumour,
Spat freely and declined the quest,
Having too strong a sense of humour.
Then said the Boss: “My total aid
From amateurs is none;
So I propose to have this raid
Professionally done;
Ho! Master CHURCHILL, have you got
Five hundred stout policemen handy,
The kind that saved our troops a lot
Of painful work at Tonypandy?” O. S.
THE CURSE OF EDUCATION.
SUPPose you let me get in a word or two. I've listened
to everything you've said, and I tell you honestly you
haven't convinced me. Mind, I'm not saying that education
isn't a good thing for some people, but you've got to pick
the right sort of people and give 'em the right sort of
education. If a boy's going to be an agricultural labourer
what's the use of stuffing him full of Greek verbs? and if a
girl's to be a housemaid is there any sºnse in teaching her
French and the piano 2 Much better let 'em run wild, and
then they won't get hold of any silly ideas that 'll make
'em too big for their boots. Let everybody keep their
proper stations and then we shall all be happier. How do
I know what's a man's proper station ? The station he's
been born to ought to be good enough for him all the time.
This talk about ambition and rising in life makes me tired.
Was I born to be a Bank manager? Well, I am a Bank
manager, and so I suppose I must have been. Besides,
what's the use of comparing agricul ural labourers and
Bank managers? They're as different as chalk from cheese.
However, I'll just tell you a bit of a story which 'll show
you what I mean. It's about a man I used to know in the
old days, a little chap called Widdowson. He'd a pot of
money left him by his father, so he hadn't got to do any-
thing—just lived by himself in a tidy little house and did
what he liked. No, he wasn't really much ot a fellow;
rather near with his money and awkward in his ways.
Not enough gumption to set up a cat, I should say, but
his dinners weren't too bad, and he rubbed along all right.
He’d got a whacking big St. Bernard dog. I suppose he
must have bought it to give himself an air, for I never
heard of his being particularly fond of dogs before he got
this one. Odin–that was the dog's name—was as big as
a pony, with a heavy orange-coloured coat and a great head
and huge teeth. I never saw such a monster. Widdowson
looked like a microbe beside him when they went out
walking together—too absurd for words. Everybody felt
inclined to laugh when they saw this great beast pacing
meekly along with his little spindle-legged whipper-snapper
of a master.
And the best fun of it was that Widdowson was always
showing off his power over the dog. He would make him
sit down in the street and wait till he gave him a sign to
come on, and if he didn't keep to heel he'd touch him up
with the dog-whip, and Odin would take it all as humbly
as if Widdowson was a fifty horse-power giant instead of
being one of the scrubbiest little pigeon-breasted dwarfs
you ever set your eyes on. No, he hadn't taught Odin any
ticks. He said it was no use educating a dog like that :
they couldn't learn things like poodles. Besides the dog
looked upon him as a sort of god, and that was good
enough for him, he said.
Well, it all went on right enough till Barker came along
as locum for our doctor one summer. Barker was a smart
fellow; stood six foot two, and put the weight for Oxford.
He'd done pretty well at Bart's too, and had got notions
of his own on psychology and things of that sort. He got
arguing with Widdowson one day about dogs. One of his
ideas was that the development of dogs had been arrested,
and if you only set about it in the right way you could
teach a dog to speak—at least he'd understand you and
answer you back in his own way—and in time he might be
able to read and even do a sort of writing with his paw.
There was no reason, he said, why dogs shouldn't be on the

same intellectual plane as human beings in time. Widdow-
son laughed at him, but the upshot was that when he
went away for a fortnight he lent Odin to Barker to be
educated in the new way and made a man of.
What Barker did with the dog I don't know, but I know
what happened when Widdowson came back. I was there
and saw it all. Barker brought Odin round to Widdowson's,
and Widdowson came out with the dog-whip as usual and
called the dog. Odin never stirred, but he whinnied once
or twice in the St. Bernard way, and Widdowson said,
“What's the matter with the dog?" Barker said, “He’s
telling you he isn't coming with you this morning. He's
got business of his own that he's got to attend to.” “Oh,
has he?” said Widdowson; “we 'll soon see about that,”
and he upped with his dog-whip and made for Odin. As
soon as the dog saw him coming he just gave a couple of
short barks, more like a laugh than anything else, and then
he rolled Widdowson over with one of his great paws, bent
over him, fixed his teeth in his waistband, lifted him up in
his mouth, and began trotting off. “It's no use, Widdow-
son,” said Barker, “he says he's had enough of you, and
now that he's been educated and knows what he's worth
he isn't going to obey you any longer.” Widdowson caved
in directly and the dog dropped him and went off full
gallop to Barker's house. Barker's got him still, I believe,
and they get on pretty well together. But there you are.
If that dog hadn't been educated he'd be Widdowson's
dog still. That shows you the danger of the thing. Better
off with Barker, is he? I don't know so much about that:
and, anyhow, Widdowson didn't think so, and he was the
dog's proper master.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PERPETUAL EMOTION.
(From “The Times” of December 20, 1960.)
THE series of spritely dinners given
by the proprietors of The Encyclopædia
Britannica to the contributors to the
eleventh edition is still in full swing,
the two hundred and fiftieth being held
last night. Sir Hugh CHISHolM took
the Chair as usual, habit having become
second nature with him ; and he made,
for a nonagenarian, a singularly lucid
speech, in which he once again ex-
plained the genesis of the Encyclopaedic
idea and its progress through the ages
until it reached perfection under his
own fostering care. Sir HUGH, who
spoke only for two hours instead of
his customary three, was at times but
imperfectly heard by the Press, but
a formidable array of ear-trumpets
absorbed his earlier words at the
table. -
Sir THOMAS BEECHAM, Mus.Doc., re-
sponding for the toast of the musical
contributors, indulged in some interest-
ing reminiscences of his early career. In
those days, as he reminded his hearers,
he was a paulo-post-Straussian. But
it proved only a case of sauter pour
mieux, reculer, and now he confessed
that he found it impossible to listen
with any satisfaction to music later
than that of MENDELssohn. After all,
melody, simple and unsophisticated,
was the basic factor in music, and an
abiding fame could never be built up
on the calculated pursuit of eccen-
tricity. - -
Lord Gosse, who entered and dined
in a wheeled chair, remarked incident-
ally that he had missed only seven out
of the two hundred and fifty dinners,
and then told some diverting if not too
novel anecdotes of his official connec-
tion with the Board of Trade and recited
a charming sonnet which he had com-
posed in honour of the Editor, the two
last lines running as follows:—
“Foe of excess, of anarchy and schism,
I liſt my brimming glass to thee, HUG II
CHIshoi.M.”
Few centenarians can ever have con-
tributed a more exhilarating addition
to an evening's excitement.
Dr. Hooper, late Master of Trinity
and ex-Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge
University, expressed his gratification
that his alma mater was indissolubly
associated with the great undertaking
which they were once more met to
celebrate in convivial conclave. Cam-
bridge was famous for its “Backs,”
and it had put its back into The
Encyclopædia Britannica. He hoped
that he might be spared to attend
their three hundredth meeting, with
Sir HUGH CHISHOLM as Autocrat of the
Dinner-Table.
A popular feature of these evenings
has become the reading of the list of
contributors who have died since the
last gathering. It is our melancholy
duty to record the death of one of the
most valued section-editors during Sir
HUGH's closing remarks. The old
gentleman expired so peacefully that
his immediate neighbours believed him
to be merely as fast asleep as them-
selves. He leaves a venerable but
mirthless widow and several tons of
MS. notes for the twelfth edition.
E-
OUR POET PEERS.
[“Lord Coleridge,” as we learn from The
Daily Mail of the 15th inst., “has composed a
song in praise of Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire,
with which place his family has long been
connected. Lord Coleridge also set the song to
music and sang it at the annual gathering of
the Old Otterian Society in London. The
chorus is as follows:–
Oh, Ottery dear, oh, Ottery fair,
My heart goes out to thee;
Thou art my home where'er I roam,
The West—the West for me.
The secretary of the society states that Lord
Coleridge's song will be sung by Otterians all
over the world.”]
This, however, is no isolated effort.
Encouraged by the success of their
party at the polls, a number of Liberal
Peers have recently burst into song.
The contribution of Lord PIRRIE,
K.P., to this literary renascence of the
Gilded Chamber takes the form of a
touching elegiac poem in which he
contrasts his stately Surrey mansion
with his former abode in Belfast :-
“Oh, Witley, charming Witley,
Haunt of my leisure hours,
To celebrate you fitly
Transcends my humble powers.
And yet I love that far land
Where once I had my home,
In the Company of HARLAND
And Wolf F, across the foam.”
Lord PIRRIE has set this poem in
the key of C sharp minor with a beau-
tiful arpeggio accompaniment. The
closing cadence is of extraordinary me-
lodic charm, and Lord PIRRIE’s secre-
tary states that it will be sung by all
the shipwrights of Belfast.
Lord Court.NEY OF PEN witH is an
accomplished littérateur, but he has
not before this courted the Muse, a
fact which lends peculiar interest to
his eulogy of Liskeard:—
“Oh, Liskeard, lovely Liskeard,
Ere I was fully whiskered
I doted on your grace.
Now though I’m coronetted
And properly Debretted
I never have regretted
That I'm of Cornish race.”
Lord CourtNEy's setting of his lyric
recalls the delicious flavour of the
ballads of twenty years ago, and has a
lilt that is worthy of STEPHEN ADAMs
at his best. The Manager of the Great
Western Railway states that the song
will be sung by Cornubians all over
the English Riviera.
Lord DEvoNPORT, as becomes a keen
yachtsman, has cast his new song in
the form of a “chanty,” the opening
verse being as follows:–
“If you want to go free and cheerly 0.
Get up in the morning early O !
It's the way to health
And fame and wealth
According to HUDsoN KEARLEY O !”
The score of this “chanty" is remark-
able for its simplicity, and the Secre-
tary of the Port of London Board co-
fidently predicts that it will be sung
by all the stevedores in the British
Empire.
Baron DE FoREST's musical talent
has long been notorious in the highest
circles. He has now given convincing
proofs of its high quality in a touch-
ing barcarolle dedicated to the HoME
SECRETARY:—
“Ye isles of Greece, ye isles of Greece,
Where Honor cruised in perfect peace,
Containing, like the gods of myth,
WINSTON and also F. E. S.Mith–
Ne'er shall the glories of that trip
From my retentive memory slip.”
The skipper of the Honor states that
Baron DE FoREST's song will be sung
by Free Foresters all over the world.
Lord DENMAN has devoted his dis-
tinguished talent to a spirited song in
praise of Balcombe, which runs as
follows:—
“O Balcombe, breezy Balcombe,
My heart goes out to thee
At breakfast and at luncheon,
At dinner and at tea.
They say the German foemen
Are coming o'er the sea
To trample down our yeomen
And place them “on the knee.’
But I say, ‘Let 'em all come,
So long as I'm at Balcombe
To keep old England free.’”
The Secretary of the Bachelors' Club
declares that this song, which the
author has wedded to a luscious air,
is already a favourite with Mr. GILLETT.
Lastly, Lord ABERDEEN has recently
succumbed to the divine afflatus with
the following exhilarating results:–
“O Dublin is a peerless town
As every Viceroy knows :
The Liffey, stained a lurid brown,
Through Dublin city flows;
And on its banks of verdant hue,
To quench the nation's drought,
The firm of GUINNEss loves to brew
The most refreshing stout.
Chorus.
O porter, you're a jewel !
O porter, you re a joy!
You're meat and drink and fuel
To every Irish boy 1"
The CHIEF SECRETARY states that Lord
ABERDEEN's song will be sung by every
porter-drinker in the Emerald Isle.

OUR AUTHORS IN POLITICS.
[Whilst the Press has paid much attention
to Mrs. HUM phity WA. D.'s political letters to
her neighbours the activity of other deserving
authors has been ignored.]
The feature of the West Wilts elec-
tion was the appearance of Mr. MAURIGE
HEwlºtt in complete armour on the
Liberal platform. It was asked that
all questions should be impaled on the
lance that Mr. HEwlett held out to
the meeting. It is considered rather
remarkable that throughout the cam-
paign not a single question was put to
the Radical candidate.
All hope of defeating the Lord Advo-
CATE vanished when Mr. CRoCKETT,
his zealous supporter, hinted that in
case of his defeat he was prepared to
lay the scene of his next romance in
Linlithgow. The defeated Conserva-
tive Candidate is taking counsel's
opinion as to whether this amounts to
intimidation.
Mr. G. K. Christºrton was most
rominent in the sharp contest in
orth Bucks. At the first meeting of
the campaign he sat on a Tory inter-
ruptor. After that, interruptions abso-
lutely ceased. It is expected that the
interrupter will leave the Cottage
Hospital early in the New Year.
The great triumph at Hastings is
universally attributed to the clever
topical leaflets issued by Mr. Coulson
KERNAHAN. “The Lion and the Leech,”
a striking comparison of Imperialism
and Socialism; “The Bee and the
Ballot,” a defence of the Industrious
Voter's right to the Referendum; “Pro-
vidence and the Peer,” a vindication of
the House of Lords—all thrilled the
hearts of the lodging-house keepers and
led to the famous Unionist victory.
Mr. Victor GRAYsoN wishes it to be
known that the prominent place he
occupied in the Kennington poll—only
four thousand short heads behind the
winner—was due to the support he
received from Mr. HILAIRE BELLoc.
Mr. BELLoc's exposures of the party
game — his revelations that Mr.
CHURCHILL was the real author of
Tariff Reform ; that Mr. URE, Mr.
BALFour's intimate friend, suggested
the policy of the Referendum, and that
Sir Edward CARson and Mr. LLoyd
GEoRGE exchange epithets for their
speeches — moved the electors im-
mensely. In fact, the Conservatives
were so disgusted that they voted for
the Radical candidate, and the Radicals
that they plumped for the Conserva-
tive. Hence Kennington should be
reckoned as a Unionist gain.
The eloquence of Mr. LE QUEux led
to the splendid Unionist victory at
Grimsby. One could have heard a pin
drop in the crowded halls as he detailed
conversations on Tariff Reform he had
held with the Prince of MonAco, the
Bey of TUNIs, Don CARLos, the Grand
Duke of BADEN, and the Chief of the
Italian Secret Police. His address to
the Primrose League on the Certainty
of a German Invasion—illustrated by
locks of hair belonging to Princesses
he had known—marked an epoch in
Grimsby's political history.
More Contempt of Court.
“The Lord Chief Justice occupied Canon
Scott Holland's stall, and took part in the
singing. As is stated in the fore part of the
service-paper the object of the service is not to
gratify the ear or the taste."—The Guardian.
Had this appeared in any other paper
we might have suspected something.
The subject for debate at a recent
meeting of the York Law Students'
Society was as follows:
“Mrs. Quiverfull, parent of Quinta (a child
of five), negligently allows Quinta to go out
unattended upon a road frequented by motors.
Owing to the negligence of the driver of ja
passing motor the child is injured. Can the
child recover ?"
Time alone can show.

THE WHOLE DUTY OF HOSTESSES.
LIFE is such a ticklish business at its best that it is
hard indeed that such accessory functions as dinner parties,
which all wise men would avoid if they could, should be a
means of adding to our difficulties. Yet don't they?
Who is there that has not now and then blundered with
his partner—who is there that has not now and then
blundered with her partner—before the entrée, simply
through insufficient information being given by the
hostess as to the name, standing, antecedents, relatives and
friends of the stranger?
As it is, what happens 2 “Oh, Mr.-er—Mr. Barr, I
want to introduce you to your partner for dinner, Mrs.
[here a mumble].” Mr. Barr says that he is delighted;
he is led to Mrs. [mumble]'s chair and they prepare
to descend the stairs, he in his usual doubt, owing to
total ignorance of precedential rites, as to the precise
moment when he,
daughter of a London magistrate. Sir Ferdinand is one
of the largest contributors to the Tariff Reform funds, and
a personal friend of Mr. CHAPLIN and AUSTEN. He has
the best English collection of Meissoniers, and won the
Porterhouse Stakes at Ascot this year. Lady Peters has
written two novels under the name of “Henry Stiles." She
collects fans, and has a home at Byfleet for orphaned
Suffragettes, but never appears at meetings or takes any
active part in the propaganda. She is a friend of the
TREEs and also HERBERT TRENCH. Her brother is on The
Times.” That is not, of course, a complete biography,
but no man with any brains should fail to make use of
such pointers. To have anything but an amicable meal
with such an assistance would argue one utterly tactless
and unworthy of his hostess's hospitality. -
For the ladies the hostess might write something like
this: “You will be taken in to dinner by Mr. Flitt. He
comes from Devonshire and is about twenty-eight. He

Post-Impressionists,
and Marie Claire—they
get to the staple of all
London conversation,

This is where trouble
is liable to begin, be-
cause one cannot dis-
cuss men and women
without expressing
opinions, and so small
is the world and so
mischievous is chance

has translated one of

couraging to do some
original work.” These
cases presuppose a
knowledge by the
hostess of her guests
—rather a large order.
When, as is more
likely, she knows
nothing of them, they
must furnish an auto-
biography. Where
they are really famous

to write, “You will

critical period of politics this risk is far greater, when feeling
runs high and dislikes are intensified; and during the
past few weeks some perfectly horrible things must have
happened at what should be festive and genial boards.
Now there are two protective courses which might be
pursued. (1) The guests might arrange to provide their
hostesses with a complete list of the subjects on which
they intend to talk and the names of prominent persons
that they will introduce. The hostess could then appor-
tion them according to Party and general temperament,
or if she had no ladies quite in tune return the list with a
few editorial suggestions, such as “Better not say anything
about WINSTON.” “Your partner is a great admirer of
STRAUss.” “They have a Gauguin on their staircase.”
The guest could then modify accordingly.
But perhaps a better way is to throw the whole burden
on the hostess, who, after all, must pay the price of giving
dinner parties. Let her (2) supply each guest, either on the
evening or, preferably, before, with a full account of his or
her partner, written very clearly. Thus: “You will take

held up one with apple cheeks and
bright blue eyes. “See, her eyes open

AT THE PLAY.
“THE PRINCESS CLEMENTINA.”
THIS is a pleasant and innocuous
blend of The Three Musketeers and The
Story of Rimini (Mr. H. B. IRVING
doubling the parts of Paolo and
D'Artagnan), with the difference that
Francesca and her proxy-husband do
nothing wrong, and the Three Muske-
teers do practically nothing at all. It
was perhaps a mistake to lay so much
stress at the beginning on the nation-
ality of the four Irish gallants, for there
wasn't a Celtic temperament among
the lot, and only one second-rate
brogue between them.
As for the Rimini part of the plot,
the extremely cold weather and the
rarefied altitudes of the Brenner frontier
may have contributed something to the
self-restraint of the lovers. I
cannot say what might have
happened if the time had been
nearer the vernal equinox, or
if Bologna (their destination)
had lain a little farther South.
As it was there were moments
of strong feeling on both sides.
In the man's case the struggle
was less between love of the
lady and loyalty to the King
whose bride she was to be,
than between a selfish passion
and a pure desire to save the
Princess for a higher destiny.
With her it was less easy, either
from the text or its interpreta-
tion, to follow motives. She
was really at the mercy of
Wogan : his, in fact, for the
at the Inn of The Green Cross—an
admirable scene — was particularly
happy) he added a touch of poetry and
fatalism. He made no pretence, how-
ever, to being an Irishman, but left the
Celtic element in his constitution to be
taken as read—in the original text, I
presume, of Mr. MASON's novel.
Miss STELLA PATRICK CAMPBELL, as
Clementina, was always fresh and de-
lightful to watch. It is little blame to
her that her youth was hardly equal
to the task of conveying some of the
stronger emotions demanded of the cha-
racter But she needs also a wider
range of vocal colour; her voice seldom
varied from its one sweet tone.
Miss DoRo THEA BAIRD's gifts were
wasted on the short, explosive part of
Jenny, and Mr. NIGEL PLAYFAIR as the
Prince of Baden had very little scope

set eyes on, who had never
even taken the trouble to come
and court her, but sent his servants to
fetch her (a king's daughter) across
half Europe on the hazy off-chance of
winning an English crown, could
scarcely have been an overwhelming
attraction. The reward of her pains was
to find him gone from the rendez-vous
at Bologna—gone to Cadiz (a bad place
for fidelity, as BYRON discovered) with the
idea of making an expedition to Scot-
land. He writes of it as if he were just
going stalking. He would be back
presently; had, indeed, hoped to be
in time to receive her. For the
unavoidable delay he consents to ex-
press his royal regrets. I am afraid
that the voices of some score of supers
º representing the multitudi-
nous welcome of Bologna, must have
afforded her an indifferent solace for
her wounded propriety.

The name, by the way, is in the air
just now ; it was only the other night
that I assisted at the “decorating ” of
another Clementine, now announced as
about to be taken off. I trust Mr.

happier sense: he certainly deserves
better luck than he has had. O. S.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
To glean in a field reaped by Mr. SPIELMANN, who
harvested the comprehensive History of Punch, is an
unpromising task. In his Douglas Jerrold and Punch
(MACMILLAN), Mr. WALTER JERRold judiciously confines
himself to the connection of his grandfather with the
paper, and brings into convenient compass matter which,
if not new, is always interesting. Douglas JERRold was
of the earliest camaraderie who started Punch. By the
present generation he is chiefly known as the creator of Mrs.
Caudle, the recorder of her Curtain Lectures. These did not
appear till 1845, when Mr. Punch gave his eighth volume to
an appreciative public. Four years earlier, writing over
the initial “Q,” Douglas JERRold was fiercely breasting
the sea of politics, making a pretty splash. To the reader
accustomed to the more restrained political writing of
to-day “Q’s" fierce attack on men and measures may
seem a little excessive. Absolutely fearless of conse-
quences, Douglas JERROLD took his walks abroad, bludgeon
in hand, and bashed the head of anyone met on the way
whom he regarded as advocating causes harmful to public
interests or oppressive to the poor. His vigorous diatribes
commanded attention from week to week not only at
home but abroad. Whilst suggestion was made by one
of his victims in the House that he should be indicted by
the ATToRNEY-GENERAL, an edict was issued by the Austrian
Government forbidding him to pass through their country
on his way to Rome. This sort of thing encouraged rather
than disheartened JERROLD, and he went on his way
rejoicing. In private life he could not resist the temptation
to say a witty thing because it might wound a friend
within hearing. Conscious of his infirmity and repentant,
he from his deathbed sent by HoRACE MAYHEw a
touching message to old companions at the Punch
Dinner Table. “Tell the dear boys,” he said, “that if
I've ever wounded any of them I've always loved
them.” To personal reminiscences of his grandfather,
gathered from various sources, Mr. WALTER JERROLD adds
reprints of some of his serials contributed to Punch,
making a portly and pleasant volume.
At the end of each chapter of Howard's End (ARNOLD) I
gave a sigh of pleasure, and then went on happily to the
next one. Mr. E. M. ForsTER has written a book which
may be classed with The Country House, The Old Wives'
Tale and Joseph Vance, to mention three of the great novels
of recent years. Perhaps he has most in common with the
author of The Country House, but he rises superior to Mr.
GALsworthy in this—that there is more humour and sym-
pathy behind his realism, something of the humour and
sympathy of Mr. DE MoRGAN. (Now I have found him his

godfathers.) There are faults of melodrama in the book—a
glaring coincidence, in connection with Mr. Wilcor's past,
such as would only be allowed on the stage; Helen's rela-
tions with Leonard Bast, which seem to me altogether
improbable—but anything can be forgiven an author who
introduces us to the great Wilcor family. What do they
know of England who do not Wilcor know? For the
Wilcores are England; they contain more of the essence
of England even than Sunday afternoon, or Lords, or Sir
WILLIAM BULL. The Schlegel family, Margaret and
Helen and Tibby, is equally true to life, and it is in the
contrast between Schlegels and Wilcores that the motif of
the book lies; for the Schlegels had had a foreign father.
(Surely not German, Mr. ForsTER, with so lively a pair of
daughters.) Howard's End is a book to buy and a book to
keep; I offer my heartiest congratulations to its author,
and beg him to take his time over the next one. I shall have
all his earlier books to read while waiting for it.
In his English Country Life (Foulis), Mr. WALTER
herself once or twice, I felt a new respect for it. It may
not be legitimate, it may even be a little hectic, but it
certainly is not maudlin. Treating the plot therefore with
silent awe, I recommend to you this witty treatise on the
folly of being overwise (especially in your love affairs),
presented in the form of a novel at least as readable as any
this writer has ever produced. Which is equivalent to
saying that The Wisdom of Folly is certainly to be read and
inevitably to be enjoyed, plot and all.
Mr. Punch once more gratefully acknowledges a number
of seasonable gifts, not perhaps strictly literary, but liable
to be of great assistance in the regulation and adornment
of the literary mind. Such are the diaries that come from
|Messrs. T. J. AND J. SMITH, very practical and business-
like, yet not disdaining the aid of artistry. Charming
diaries, too, and suitable for all pockets, emanate from the
establishment of Messrs. WALKER. Among the many solid
and serviceable devices that spring from the teeming brain
of Mr. CHARLEs LETTs is a “Ladies' Year Book,” excel-

WICK BURGHS: THE LAST PHASE.
(“Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle.”)
WE watched her keel across the bar go
From free wee Kirkwall town ;
We watched her skipper dump his cargo
Of ballot-boxes down ;
An Empire hung with pale complexions
Upon the tidings, tick by tick;
For Fate had left, in these Elections,
The final word with Wick.
Shetland, that old-established Thule,
Her bloodless fight had closed;
Had nominated, well and duly,
Her WAsoN unopposed;
The immemorial right she wielded
To play the last protracted trick—
That privilege she now had yielded,
Handing it on to Wick.
So ends the combat, loud and gory,
That cost a cool two million quid,
And leaves the rivals, Rad and Tory,
Standing (like Scotland) where they did;
And I, for one—I can't help saying,
As I review the dead and quick,
This futile game that we've been playing
Was hardly worth the wick.
OUR WONDERFUL WORLD.
“EveRY genuine Teddy Bear has a small button in the
ear.” Did you know that ? I didn't. Yet it is the sort
of thing one ought to know, otherwise one may be imposed
upon. Before the postman came this morning I shouldn't
have been aware of the awfulness of a Teddy Bear with-
out a button. Now that I have received The Xmas
Bazaar I feel that a buttonless Teddy Bear would be a
disgrace.
It is an entrancing volume, The Xmas Bazaar. Its roll
of Teddy Bears (each with a button in the ear) by no
means exhausts its interest. Were you aware, I wonder, that
London contains a Plush Jointed Dachshund? I wasn't
—not until I beheld him waddling across a page of The
Xuuas Bazaar. Would you like a Puddle Duck? Or an
Indestructible Stuffed Territorial 2 They are all in The
Aulas Bazaar. ... And, have you met Squinting Micky?
He (I quote) “flaps both ears, squints with both eyes,
and can also move his arms and mouth.” Many readers
of The Xmas Bazaar cannot flap either ear. . . . As
for Clockwork Foxy Grandpa-but he only costs tenpence-
halfpenny, so we shall not bother about him. I doubt
whether he has a button in his ear.
These, however, are, after all, mere toys for the young.
Their elders require more intellectual amusement. The
Xmas Bazaar has not overlooked the fact. Rightly,
indeed, do we speak of a merry Christmas. What Christ-
mas could be less than merry if you have taken the precau-
tion to provide yourself with a fivepenny packet of Beetles
in the Beer 2 What Never heard of Beetles in the
Beer?. Hear, then, and marvel. “The joker quietly drops
one of these beetles into his beer"—champagne would
perhaps do as well—" and then objects to drink it until
an offer, is made to exchange the liquor. However, on
second thoughts"—it is taken for granted that the joker
is a subtle comedian—“after removing the beetle he drinks
the beer. The company feel ill at the sickly sight. Great
joke to those in the secret.”
It made me rock with laughter even to read of it.
Unfortunately I am a teetotaler, so instead of Beetles in
the Beer I think I shall get The Ladies' Cigarette Box.
“This dainty box has a small ball in the cover. When
your lady friend presses the ball to obtain a cigarette, she
receives a spray of water on the nose.” Capitall And how
my lady friends will laugh
Concerning the Joke of the Season (price 6 d.) I am
less sure. The Xmas Bazaar seems to speak with a more
uncertain note on this subject: “Show your friend the
latest handy Flash Light, tell him coloured lights will
appear when the button is slightly pressed. Suggest he
goes under the table to get a good effect, which he does.
On his return you know how he has been sold. With
one of these jokes in your possession you will have endless
fun.” Quite so. But, well, how has he been sold 2 The
Xmas Bazaar is silent on this head. And suppose your
friend is too stupid to care about coloured lights, and
declines to accept your suggestion that he should go under
the table? The world is full of curmudgeons who protest
that they dislike going under tables. I shall not risk my
sixpence-halfpenny on The Joke of the Season.
Instead, I think I must buy The Scent Bottle Joke.
It costs threepence, and here again we have an opportunity
of delighting our dear ones. “When your friend"—it is
well to keep a large supply of friends—“removes the cork
to smell the perfume, the contents of bottle empties down
his sleeve.” Yes, it is certainly desirable to have a large
supply of friends.
And while you are about it you had better spend a
shilling on the really stunning humorous effect entitled,
“‘Oh! Oh!' she cried.” You might not guess it from
its price, but it is a jewel-case. Succinctly its virtues are
described: “Snake jumps out of Jewel Box. Creates
screams of laughter.”
Hark, too, to the virtues of The Crash Bang Joke.
They are simplicity itself. “A number of pieces of tuned
metal when thrown on ground give the sound of glass
smashing.” Here, plainly, we have the invention of an
acute psychologist. If The Crash Bang Joke does not
reach the heart of the British people, nothing will. It is
redolent of Yuletide's spirit of merriment.
Among the minor accessories of a happy Christmas, as
"pictured in this suggestive volume, are Imitation Cigar
Ends. “We have designed a perfect cigar end"—I can
almost see the great conclave at which the perfect cigar end
was worked out—“and are offering these at 1d. each."
And what, you ask (for your wits are working slowly, you
know), is the precise application of the perfect cigar end?
You would never guess, to look at it, that it was not to be
placed nicely in an ash-tray. No, it is to be thrown
into the middle of the billiard table—to give your host
a bad moment of fear for his cloth. They need waking
up, these Idle Rich. Please send me one dozen of your
perfect cigar ends. -
Another fellow who ought to have some of the conceit
taken out of him is the fussy Good Samaritan. For two-
pence you can cure him of his coddling ways by providing
yourself with The Finger Stall. It is a great notion, The
Finger Stall. “Your friend" (if you have any left by
now) “questions you about your cut finger, then ask him
to tie a piece of tape to keep the stall secure. Just as
he is about to tie a knot, you turn around, leaving the
stall in his possession. The poor fellow, thinking your
finger has come off, gives a shrieking yell. YoU MUST
HAVE ONE 1 '' Farceur !

[DECEMBER 28, 1910.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CINDERELLA’S DIARY.
(Picked up in a Provincial Theatre.)
Tuesday.—Sometimes I think I am
a very lucky girl, having two big
sisters to look after me. I expect there
are lots of young girls who have nobody
at all, and I think they must be so
lonely. There is always plenty of fun
going on in our house. Yesterday I
heard Sister Fred telling Sister Bert
something about her old man coming
home very late one night—I didn't
quite understand who the old man was,
or what it was all about, but I know
Sister Bert thought it was very funny,
and I seemed to hear a lot of people
laughing; perhaps it was the fairies.
And then whenever Sister Bert sits
down she always pulls her skirt right
up to her knees, so as people can see
lier stockings. I mean there's always
something amusing happening.
Of course I have a good deal of
work to do, and all the washing up,
but my sisters are so big and strong
that one can't expect them to bother
themselves with niggling little things
like that. Besides, they have so many
other things to do. Only this morn-
ing, when Sister Bert was just going to
sit down, Sister Fred pulled away her
chair, and she sat on the floor and her
legs went up in the air. She said it
was a “grand slam,” which some of us
thought very funny. I didn't laugh
myself because I never go out any-
where, and so I don't understand topical
remarks, but I do think it is nice to
live in such an amusing house.
(Later). — A wonderful thing has
happened Two messengers came from
the Prince an hour ago to invite us to
the ball to-night! I'd never seen a
messenger in my life, so I peeped out
of the chimney corner at them and
wondered if they would stay to tea.
But instead of that my sisters put up
what they call a “trapeze” (I never
knew we had one before), and the mes-
sengers did some ertraordinary things
on it, I thought they would kill them-
selves. After it was over, Sister Fred
| told them a lot of stories about the old
man, and altogether it was quite dif-
ferent from what I expected. Ours is
a funny house.
As soon as the messengers had gone,
my sisters began to get ready for the
ball. I knew I shouldn't be able to go,
because I haven't got a frock, and I
| simply couldn't wear anything of theirs,
they are so much bigger than I am.
| They finished dressing downstairs for
some reason, where anybody might
have seen them—they are so funny
about things like that—and we had a
lot of laughter about the clothes being
too tight and so on. I think anything
like that is so amusing. Then they
went off, and here I am all alone.
is getting dark, and so I am going to
cheer myself up by singing a little.
(Later).-I am going to the Ball !
My Fairy Godmother, whom I had often
heard about, suddenly came to see us.
I told her my sisters were out, and she
asked where they had gone, and
wouldn't I like to go too, so of course I
said I should love it. So I am going,
and she has got a frock for me and
everything. She is very kind, but not
quite so fairylike as I expected.
Wednesday. —I have had a lovely
time, and I think I am in love. I got
to the Ball just as the juggling and
the ventriloquism were over — it
must be a delightful Court to live in-
and there was such a sensation as I
appeared. The Prince singled me out
at once. He has the pinkest cheeks
and the reddest lips of any man I
know, and his voice is soft and
gentle, and oh! I love him. One
wants a man to be manly and a
woman to be womanly, and I don't
think I should love a man if he were at
all like Sister Fred or Sister Bert.
The Prince is quite different. We
were alone most of the time, and we
sang several songs together. My
sisters never recognised me; it was
most surprising. I heard Sister Fred
telling a very fine-looking gentleman
a story about a lodger (whatever that
is) who had a bit of a head; it sounded
very humorous. Wherever Sister Fred
goes there is sure to be ſun. I am
indeed a lucky girl to have two such
sisters and to be in love with a Prince.
Sister Bert sat down on the floor twice
—it was most amusing.
A terrible thing happened just as the
clock struck twelve. All my clothes
turned into rags, and I just ran out of
the room, I was so frightened. Then
I remembered what my Fairy God-
mother had said about leaving before
twelve o'clock. I suppose she knew
what would happen if I didn't. I'm
afraid I left a glass slipper behind—l
hope she won't mind about it.
Well, I've had a lovely time. Even
if I never see the Prince again, I shall
always have this to look back to. I
don't mind that happens now.
Thursday.—I am going to marry the
Prince / I can't believe it is true.
Perhaps it is only a dream, and I
shall wake up soon, but even if it's a
dream it's just as good as if it were
real. It was all because of the slip-
per I left behind. The Prince said
that he would marry the person
whom it fitted, because he had fallen
in love with the lady who wore it at
the ball (ºne (), and so everybody
tried it on. And they came to our

house, and Sister Bert tried it on.
then she couldn't get into it. And
couldn't. So I said, “Let metry,” and
they all laughed, but the Prince said I
s'sould, and of course it fitted at once.
Then they all recognised me, and the
Prince kissed me, and a whole lot of
people came into the house who had
never been invited, and we had the
trapeze out again, and there was
juggling and ventriloquism, and we
down suddenly on the floor.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OF LIGHT VERSE.
ANOTHER collection of the lighter and gayer sort of
poetry has just come into the world, and I make haste to
welcome it, not, indeed, as having read it through from
cover to cover, but as having used it aright by dipping into
it again and yet again. It is called A Book of Light Verse,
has been gathered together by Mr. R. M. LEONARD, and is
published by the Oxford University Press. Now that the
Cambridge Press has taken up The Encyclopædia Britannica,
with all its apparatus of Transatlantic booms and touting
circulars, it is pleasant to see the printers of Oxford
modestly putting forth this delightful edition of pretty
does it deal? It may be playful or tender, but it must not
be spiteful or mawkish. It may be humorous or regretful,
but the humour must not be mere buffoonery and the
regret must not become a bitter lamentation. It can sport
with the little grief of a child, but it has no concern with
the tragedy that ruins a man's life. It may invite a friend;
it can never denounce or trample on a foe. It can prick
folly as it flies, but it averts its gaze from vice. It may
recognise with a sigh the sense of tears in mortal things;
it may even shed a half-acknowledged tear; but its sorrow
is touched with resignation and with hope. It may play
lightly with the emotions, but it leaves to others barbarous
and elemental passions. It is refined without affectation,
immortalities. -
Mr. LEONARD has done his
work with skill and dis-
cretion. He gives us less
than six pages of preface,
and two of these are taken
up by a quotation of Mr.
LocKER-LAMPSON's famous
definition from the preface
to Lyra Elegantiarum. In
the body of the book he has
grouped his poems pleasantly
according to their subjects,
and has added a small body
of notes. Certainly he is
catholic in his taste, for,
though he includes no living
masters (they may still be
bought to their own profit
in their own volumes), he
ranges from CHAU crºr
through CAMPION, HERRick,
PRIor, LovELACE and all the
rest of them to J. K. STEPHEN.
I do not say that I agree
with him on every single
point of his selections or his
omissions, but I agree, and I
think most readers will agree,
in the vast majority of points,
and no anthologist can
properly ask or obtain more.
It is agreeable to find light
verse frankly recognised by
a great and learned univer-
sity. Too often there has
been more than a hint of
“Now, John NY, what was THE SERMon About !”
“WEREN'T You ListENING, Mother "
polite without servility; often
conventional, but never dull.
It may be serious in inten-
tion, but it must be sparkling
in manner. Even if it speaks
in the guise of a lover it
must be ready to laugh love
away with a jest. It ma
be as gay and gallant as the
ideal courtier, but a loyal
heart must beat beneath the
silks and laces even while
the pretty compliment is
being turned. Friendship it
delights in, and the cheerful
intercourse of men and all
that is pure and of good
report. It can smile with
you along the pleasant paths;
it can encourage you with
happy raillery or console
you with a song when the
ways are rough and thorny;
and through all and above
all it offers you a com-
panionship which is never
exacting, a learning which is
never pedantic, and a know-
ledge of life which is never
ponderous.
So much for what I may
call the spirit of light verse.
As to its execution much
might be said and many
examples might be given if
space permitted. Here f
must content myself with
saying that the language
patronage in the attitude of
the academic towards the airy sportiveness of the friendly
muse, as though we were to understand that the light
versifier must not presume to count himself a poet because
men had been beguiled by his efforts into a smile. Now,
however, all this is changed, no doubt owing to the
presence in Oxford of Mr. A. D. GoDLEY, a most witty poet
and a profoundly learned man. Let us agree, then, that
if a man is to write good light verse he must be a poet,
though he may consciously circumscribe his genius. He
may reſrain from those loftier flights in which a great poet
exercises his wings, but wings he must have, though they
never bear him beyond the pretty garden-flowers or out of
hearing of the pleasant conversation of his friends.
>: :::
>
What, then, is this kind of verse, and with what subjects
must be simple, natural,
and easy. The sentences must flow in a happy
sequence of the right words. There must be no rough
inversions tearing the words from their due order merely to
suit the exigencies of rhyme cr metre. This is to be the
abject slave of your rhymes, instead of their gallant master.
And as to the rhymes themselves, they must have the
appearance of being absolutely inevitable, as though, in
fact, they were the only words which enabled the writer
to express his thought adequately. Even those daring
acrobats of verse who dance on a tight-rope of three-
syllable rhymes must have a care to their feet, for a slip
may be fatal. And if anyone should dare to rhyme
“harder” with “Armada" and “grate” with “great” he
will be held doubly accursed, first as a Cockney and next as
a Frenchman—so far at least as his wretched rhymes are
concerned. R. C. L.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE BLUE BIRD.”
ON my second annual visit to Mr.
TRENCH's aviary in the Haymarket I
confess that I forfeited the Luxury-of-
Being-in-one's-Stall-at-the-Start in
favour of the more human Happiness-of-
Dining-in-Comfort. But I saw quite as
many beautiful things as I can ever take
in at one sitting. I did not however find
occasion to make any great change in
my opinion of M. MAETERLINCR's
work. I felt, as I felt before, that if he
chooses to represent the search for
Gentleman ºrith pear-shaped figure, to Tyltyl
(Master El;10 RAE). “I am the Luxury-of-
Owning-Land.”
Peer's Voice (from the Pit). “Then you must
have been overlooked by Lloyd George ' "
happiness symbolically in the concrete
shape of children looking about for a
Blue Bird, he should be logical with
his symbols and not make them behave
as they never would or could ; not
make his children hang about church-
yards at midnight, for instance, or in-
spect caverns full of noxious bogies.
In any work, too, of which the
decorative quality keeps the eye busily
employed, I protest that the spectator
ought not to be made to think too
furiously. The general scheme of this
allegory may be simple enough, but
over its details, often apparently arbi-
trary, one exhausts oneself in trying to
discover a meaning where I daresay
the author himself was at a loss to
know what he was driving at.
The new scenes, showing (1) a feast
of wanton and obese gourmands; (2)
the same as gibbering brown spectres
stripped of their external gauds and
internal adipose deposit; (3) a bevy
of higher Happinesses, did not help
much to remedy the inconsistency of the
author's original design. For here, to
judge by their nomenclature, we have
a host of abstractions—such as the
Happiness-of-Being-Well, and the Joy-
of-Walking-Barefoot-in-the-Dew—im-
ported into a play which sets out to
illustrate its ideas by symbolism. What
are these humanised abstractions doing
here? They ought to be birds. If you
start by symbolising your Happiness-
in-Chief as a Blue Pigeon then your
particular Happinesses should be
represented by . Blue Canaries and
..Green Thrushes and Purple Tomtits.
The fact is that M. MAETERLINCR has
strung loosely together some pretty
fancies and moral lessons, and that Mr.
TRENCH has given them an amazingly
beautiful setting; but to say that
The Blue Bird is a perfect work of
art, in any constructive sense, is to
talk through one's Gibus.
In the interval that followed these
novelties I own that I freely enjoyed
the Luxury-of-Not-Being-Preached-at.
What the boy Tyltyl thought of it
all I can't imagine; or how he con-
trived to escape the self-conscious-
ness which everybody was working
hard to instil into him. It is enor-
mously to the credit of his un-
defeatable innocence that he didn't
wake up next morning a confirmed
prig. It was no fault of the style of
instruction employed by his guides and
| councillors—Light and Night, and the
Caretaker of the Palace of Happiness—
from whose lips came a steady flow
of adult rhetoric like a dictation lesson.
What should a little child of nature
want to know, for example, of the
“ peerless joy of maternal love"? All
this kind of thing was really being shot
over his head at the larger intelligences
of stall and pit.
The play could well do with a little
more comic relief, though Mr. RIGBY,
as Bread, contributed some nice effects
in this line, and Tyltyl was funny
among the tombstones. Personally, I
never frequent churchyards at midnight
and cannot say whether jokes about
the dead are regarded as more seemly
at this hour than in broad daylight.
Master ERIC RAE was extraordinarily
good, and showed, I thought, a more
appreciative interest in the various
exhibits than the previous Tyltyl did.
I missed Miss INA PELLY as Water,
but she had had a hand in the charm-
ing dances, and her place was well filled
by Miss SEYLER.
The lighting (and darkening) was
admirably handled, notably in the
approach to the Land of Memory, but
the veiled movements of the white
draperies in the gloom of the forest
were too rapid, and gave the effect of a
pillow-fight. -
I should like to end by saying that,
after all traceable faults have been
found, The Blue Bird, if not taken too
seriously (as in some of the above
stodgy remarks), is a really delightful
entertainment. O. S.
“OUR LITTLE CINDERELLA.”
On another page I have made a
guess at the way in which modern
pantomime strikes Cinderella. Let me
say at once that I do not mean
Cinderella of the Playhouse, for Mr.
LEO TREvoB has made a gallant
attempt to escape from modern
pantomime. His “ugly sisters” are
women, his Prince is a man; for
this alone he deserves our thanks.
Moreover the story goes along straight-
forwardly, without any pauses for per-
forming seals and such, while the
lyrics have a real connection with the
plot, and never wander into irrelevant

And wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky.”

inquiries after Kelly. In fact, Mr.
TREvor gave himself every chance of
success, and then, alas! just missed it.
I first began to fear that he had
missed it when one of the sisters started
cutting short her words in the manner
of PHIL RAY. This method of conver-
sation, straight from the Tivoli, always
makes me laugh, but it also made me
wonder whether Mr. TREvoR meant to
borrow anything else from the music-
halls. And so when fun began to be
extracted from the fact that the Baron's

clothes smelt unpleasantly of Bloomer's
Beetle Powder, and when the Baron bent
down to the accompaniment of a loud
tearing noise, why then I knew that
we should have to wait till next year
for the real Cinderella.
But Our Little Cinderella will do to
go on with ; it is a step in the right
direction. HERMANN LöHR's music is
pretty, the play is beautifully staged,
and the lyrics of ARTHUR WIMPERIs
are well above the average. (One
verse, in a song called “The Captain,”
should be left out; decent theatres
don't sneer at the Territorials nowa-
days.) And if some of the “book" is
a little stuffy there is a good deal in it
that is fresh and charming. In fact, it
comes midway between Pinkie and
Pantomime; and the question is
whether its attempt to attract the
devotees of each will make a lasting
appeal to those of either. Luckily,
however, for the success of The Play-
house afternoons one hears a lot of the
“moderate man "just now.
Mr. CYRII, MAUDE as the Baron,
Ilord Punterfield, is as delightful in
this sort of play as he is in any other.
He, his servant Massenger (Mr. H. J.
Ford), and Hurlingham (Mr. Robert
AverELL) provided most of the fun, the
last-named being a real tower of strength
to the cast. Mr. HUBERT BROMILow
was an extremely handsome Prince,
but I don't think he ought to have made
eyes at the stalls. Both the sisters
were good; and Miss MARGERY MAUDE
was very sweet and simple and pretty
as Cinderella. I liked her best in her
old clothes and with her hair down,
and she too seemed more at home then.
To one dear little fairy, whom I take
to have been Miss RENFE MAYER, I
offer my humble tribute of thanks—

BUSINESS IS BUSINESS;

and is awake to its little games, as high
above party as poverty, and accustomed
to authority. I should not demand in
him any intimacy with Parliamentary
procedure; he could always be kept
right by legal advisers at his elbow.
What I do demand in him is commer-
cial imagination, the instinct for suc-
cess. Such a man, for example, as Sir
THoMAS LIPTON or Mr. Joseph Lyons
or Mr. GEORGE EdwardEs—men who
have worked their way to positions of
eminence and respect — men whose
names are familiar as household words
—men to whom failure is unknown
and unthinkable—men who have no
gift of spurious rhetoric, no mediaeval
superstitions, no patience with frippery,
no aptitude for marking time. Such a
man it would be a pleasure and privi-
lege to serve, and under him England
would rapidly recover her old commer-
cial prestige and gain a reputation for
mercantile ability that she has never
yet enjoyed.
This, Voters of , is my creed.
Return me as your Member and I will
do my best for you and for the country.
Your Friend.
THE REJECTED PHRASE.
THE poor old fellow groaned and
then rose wearily.
“Well, well,” he cried. “I suppos
I shall have to go on the rates. . . . "
“You don't understand? Perhaps
you don't know all the years I've been
employed, Sir. I have been employed
regularly. I have scarcely missed an
election; '68, '74, '80 ('85 I don't
count—I was out of work for such a
short time), '86, '92, '95. I had a fat
job on each occasion. All the papers
gave me space. But there's an end at
last.”
I nodded sympathetically, as if I
understood, which I didn't.
“When did you begin to suffer?" I
asked.
“1900,” he answered promptly;
“1900 was the beginning. I saw before
the election was three days old that
I'd get no work that time ! And I
didn't. However, 1906 cheered me up.
I had a thoroughly good run all the
election.”
“Then what has happened since?”
“The election of last January has
happened sincel This December elec-
tion has happened sincel The Liberals
have had a majority three times run-
ning. I had made quite certain of
regular employment by their Press this
time, but—”
“But who are you, anyhow 2" I
burst out.
“I? Surely you know me? I used
to be one of the best known election
phrases in England. I've had my
place in the leading article of nearly
every losing side since '68. But while
I managed to hang on in '85 and 1900,
I can't hang on any longer. I'm the
well-known Swing of THE PENDULUM!”

I can take care of all my customers."
The rush for places in this Cabinet in
hot weather is said to be terrific; even
Mr. Asquith has never experienced
anything like it.

As far back as the

Prince Alfonso, known
as the Trottore di
Globo, alluded to the
species of co-operative
contest known as
Skrimchanko, prac-
tised by the Pata-
gonian braves on the
borders of Tierra del
Fuego. From that
day until the visit of
Mr. HESKETH PRICH-

of Skrim, as it is
generally called, was
a jealously guarded

forbidden. The stance is remarkably
open, resembling the posture of a skater
executing the Mohawk. The various
refinements of the hipe, the swoggle,
and the dorsal portamento are all used
to good purpose by the Patagonian
expert. So also are the variants of
the spoop and the counter - spoop,
which involve a temporary declutch-
ing of the clavicular clinker-hold—
always a dangerous manoeuvre—but
they are seldom resorted to without
triumphant results by the best ex-
ponents of Skrimchanko.
--- - The costume of the
Patagonian wrestlers,
again, is quite un-
usual in its tessitura.
It consists of the
bastique, a sort of
kilt made of the un-
tanned hide of the
Giant Sloth; a steeple-
crowned sombrero;
and waterproof bus-
kins of porpeagle skin
laced with thongs of
raw mesquit. A close-
fitting vest of granu-
lated calabash com-
pletes the costume.
It should be added
that, unlike the Cum-

sing without inter-
mission during each

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
... (By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
You open The Private Life of Cecil Rhodes, by his Private
Secretary, with every hope of studying human greatness
apart from the delusive glare of the limelight. You think
to discover at last the Empire-maker's attitude to a
refractory stud, discover the genesis of an imperial idea
over the buttered egg. At any rate, you shall see for
yourself the true relations of those public schemes of which
you read with those domestic circumstances which you
have experienced. You close the book with a sense of
having learnt little more than that one CECIL RHODEs, a
plu ocrat, was most kind to his employés, and not, as has
apparently been alleged, in any way addicted to drink.
For the rest there is an interesting account of Kimberley
under siege, and a detailed programme of the great man's
funeral. I should have liked to say a word in favour of
Mr. John LANE's excellently upholstered publication, but
the dismal truth is that, whether from too little acquaint-
(CoNSTABLE), insists rather unnecessarily upon his youth,
for that, he is young in thought—whatever his years may
be—is abundantly evident. I am not, however, saying this
in a spirit of depreciation, because youthfulness gives a
charm to his book. I have great hopes for Mr. Wash-
BURN, since his complaint (if it is a complaint) is one
which can be cured. He is tº N rare anomaly, a delightful
platitudinarian; and to listen to him talking about love,
for instance, is as ingenuous an entertainment as can
possibly be desired. Nevertheless it would be unfair to
him if I failed to add that he does not confine himself
to platitudes. It may be superfluous for him to state (in
brackets) that “no sincere feeling is despicable,” but I can
congratulate him upon his observation when he says that
the Philistines “are at bottom the most sentimental of
creatures.” As for Paris, he has captured the elusive
spirit of that city, and when otherwise disengaged he
writes of his captive with genuine feeling. For Mr.
LESTER HoRNBY's illustrations I have nothing but praise.

SCENES.–IX.
That is what the heroine
of The Bride's Mirror (Hutchinson) does, and very
heavily she has to suffer for it; and to us at least her
rashness seems all the more surprising because MAR-
GARET BAILLIE SAUNDERs has penalised her with the
curiously cacophonous name of Sheila Sachster, which
anyone (I should have supposed) would have taken the
earliest opportunity to alter by legal ceremony; for
it was only after some time and earnest entreaty that
Hammeryard consented to marry her. All the figures
reflected in The Bride's Mirror are very clever and
very clearly defined, Sheila herself being a particularly
haunting image; the authoress too has a fine, if rather
bitter, sense of humour. “‘Oh, Adela . . . but Christian
charity, when things are made legal, and that—and I
believe she has suffered—forgives, doesn't it 2 After all, it
has to.” “I hope," said Adeliza cuttingly, “my principles
will never descend to expediency.’ ” But was it necessary to
add to Hammeryard's already colossal iniquities by making
him hereditarily in league with the Powers of Darkness?
If there be any ethics in novel-writing, it is the aristocrat
surely, not the self-made man, who should descend from
wicked and Rosicrucian forebears.

stupid Sylvia, the eldesu ;
Susan, the second, is equally in love with him; and the
third girl, Daphne, cares for nobody but her father. The
question which of them he will marry provides the plot
of the tale, and very well told and entertaining it is. But
when this was finally settled, and for some reason the book
was found to be not quite the right length, I rather fancy
that Baroness Won HUTTEN may have said to herself,
“Why not tack on an excellent idea I've got about a
husband who accidentally puts out the eye of his wife's
lover?” . Accordingly the whole thing is shifted off to
Malta, with a married Daphne as heroine, and a new set of
characters. Even the note of these last chapters is
different. The second story is exceedingly clever in its
own way; but I objected to it because it was so obviously
not the one we began with. Besides, I wanted to hear
what had become of all the nice people in the other.
“Correction.—P. Mitchelmore writes : “In my letter in Saturday's
Mercury there is a misprint. It should lead the old shipping port,
instead of “old higginſoot."'"
This having been satisfactorily explained, the local

more obscure passages of BRowNING. : -

ſº HE Tory Earl of Meadsbridge had given up his park to the Boy Scouts for a field-day. All the neighbourhood
was made free to come and look on. Like so many of his order and political persuasion, he had been at much
expense of money and pains to assist Mr. HALDANE in his Territorial Scheme, but his heart was even more deeply
engaged in the success of the Boy Scouts movement, which he regarded as the best thing that had happened to
Fººland within his memory. His youngest boy had joined them, and was at this moment manoeuvring beside his
urite comrade, the son of the local plumber. -
Tory by tradition, but very liberal in all matters that concerned his tenantry, the Earl himself had never taken
more than a desultory interest in party-politics, and was therefore classed among the “Wild Peers” or “Backwoods-
men" that go to make the gaiety of Limehouse. But his eldest son had stood for the neighbouring borough of
Meadsbridge and just been defeated by a Radical carpet-bagger from London–Blagden by name—who had rented a
villa in the neighbourhood in order to woo the constituency. He had lingered in the scenes of his triumph and was
among the spectators in the park this afternoon. I chanced to find myself beside him. On his other side, also by
chance, was Joynes, the plumber, watching his son at work with the Scouts. I think the new M.P. must-have
imagined Joynes to be one of his working-men supporters, for he opened speech with him on a note of affability.
“An excellent idea, these Boy Scouts,” he said, “if only it doesn't encourage the military spirit. Socially and
morally I am all in favour of the movement; brings all kinds together; helps to break down class-hatred.”
“Don't you let LLoyd GEORGE hear you saying things like that, Sir," said Joynes.
-- Blagden threw a quick glance of suspicion at his man. “If the CHANCELLoR,” he replied, “may seem at times
to say a few hard home-truths about the Peers, you ought not to blame him. It all comes of his passion for the Cause
of the People.”
“Well, I'm one of the People,” said Joynes, “but I voted Unionist.”
- “You voted for the Peers?” said Blagden, employing The Daily Chronicle's party-denomination. “But that's
very generous of you, and rather exceptional.”
“Why ‘exceptional'?” said Joynes. “A good half of England voted my way this election.”
“Ah, but those were the well-to-do, with their selfish interests—publicans and pluralists and so forth.”
“Don't you make any mistake about that, Sir,” said Joynes. “Lots of 'em were of my class, and thousands
and thousands more would have voted the same way if they could have got the idea of the Referendum into their
thick heads. But a week's notice wasn't enough. You want a whole Zoo-ful of parrots saying nothing else for a
couple of years on end. Then they begin to take it in, like ‘Your food will cost you more.' Give 'em time and I'd
bet you an even dollar that if they could have a Referendum on the Referendum they'd accept it."

“I do not take your bet,” said Blagden, “firstly because I am not a betting-man, and secondly because I think
I should lose my money. But it is our business as the People's Choice to save them, if necessary, from themselves.
‘Trust the People's Representatives,' is our watchword. Your Tory Candidates went about saying: “Don’t trust me;
trus; yourselves.' And the People took 'em at their word.”
It was at this point that I intervened in the cause of comity. “If I may venture to say so, you seem, Sir,
said I, “to assume that the Liberals will have a monopoly of Government for the remainder of Time. That is a
prospect which, as a cross-bencher, I should regard with abhorrence for its lack of variety. But supposing—
for such things have happened before—supposing the Tories came back one day; and supposing they passed a Bill so
violently curtailing the franchise as to ensure their party a continuance of power till the crack of doom—again a
prospect that I should deplore on the ground I have mentioned. Where would your party be then without the
Referendum, for which, in the plenitude of your strength, you have nothing but contempt?”
“There would be a Revolution,” said Blagden, sonorously. :
“Ah,” said Joynes, “if Revolutions are to be part of the game, perhaps we shan't have to wait till the
Unionists come back. What about Ulster?”
“Don’t let's talk of Revolutions,” said a quiet voice beside me. I looked and saw an oldish gentleman of a
very genial countenance. “Let's stick,” he said, “to the Referendum. I happen, though not a party-politician myself,
to be addicted to the habit of referring to my own constituency.” -
“And what may your constituency be?” said Blagden.
“The civilised world in general,” said the old gentleman calmly; then added, as if to correct an impression of
immodesty, “in particular, the British Empire.” - * * - -
I could see that Blagden thought he had to do with a soft-brained old crony who ought to be humoured.
“And how often,” said he, “do you use the Referendum ?” . - -
“Once a week, and, by way of confirmation, twice a year. It chances that I have at this moment, under my
arm, an example of the bulkier kind of Referendum.” !
“What's this about the Referendum ?” said Lord Meadsbridge as he strolled up and greeted the old gentleman
with a smile of protest. “No party-politics allowed within earshot of Boy Scouts, you know !”
“My dear host,” said the quiet voice, “there are other things besides party-politics that may be classed as
Referenda—in the sense that they need to be submitted for approval to the public intelligence. And such are the
contents of this parcel of which I propose to present a facsimile to each troop of the Boy Scouts at whose evolutions I
have to-day had the great pleasure of assisting. Had the political wisdom it contains been of a partisan colour I should
never have permitted myself to make this offering in such a quarter!” -
“My dear Mr. PUNCH,” said his lordship, “though I am only a Backwoods Peer” (here he bowed and smiled
to Blagden), “yet I have read your Epilogues for years and years, and I have wit enough to guess how this one is
going to end. You are about to say—” . -
“I am,” said Mr. PUNCH (for it seems that he had been correctly accosted); “I am about to say that I hope
to have the honour of presenting to each troop of your Boy Scouts an early specimen of my
One jumbrel and thirty-flinth volume.
